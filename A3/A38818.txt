To the Reader.
IT is reported of Theucydides, that he did not write much, nor soared high:
but that he stole away the palm from them that wrote a great deal more. What
is said of him, I may truly say of our Author, that he has written but a
little Book, but more usefully then they that have written great Volumes. It is
a tenet among the Moralists, that in the government of Commonwealths Examples
prevail more with the multitude then either Laws or Precepts: for that more
credit is given to the eye, then to the ear; Promptius intuitu sequimui quam
mente receptum. Ista per Idaeas, ill^ per acta probat.
What they see, they believe assuredly, but not what they hear; for that the
tongue is a dissembler, and same a liar. Wherefore in examples, and presidents
does our Author deal; he has set before our eyes, many lively patterns
borrowed out of the most classical Authors of such as have tasted of both
Fortunes, that for a time have bin most renowned of their sovereigns; yet
before they dyed became contemptible, and dyed miserable; the causes of their
risings and their ruins, together with a great deal of divine and wholesome
Counsel to such as attend the Courts of Princes, how to behave themselves that
they do not fall into the like miseries. Wherefore I have thought it no
needless or fruitless labor to dismantle our Author of his Pilgrims habit,
and to invest him in the Robes of an Englishman; rudely perhaps; what then?
shall we therefore neglect the man because his Tailor has neglected him? No;
have we not often tasted of pure liquor Multo ^ies v^num Samio va^ sculo,
multoties venenum e N^ronis Cape line ingurgitavimus. Saepenumero sub sordido
palliolo latet prudentia, saepenumero anguis in herba; unde poeta: saepe tegit
nucleum squallida testa bonum.
in an earthen Temple pot, and seen a fair habit under a frize Jerkin;
entertayne him then though he come to you like a Clown, in a rude and rustic
habit, he will acquaint you with occurrences that happened before your Fathers
were borne; in England, France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Swethland, and in
other parts of the Christian world: entertain him with his Companions,
Cornelius Tacitus, Philip Commines, Matthew Paris, Theucydides, and the rest,
whose aid he has implored in the building of this his Fabric. I dare commend
them to you with that Encomium, which Lipsius gives of Tacitus. Yet not upon
mine own knowledge so much as upon the knowledge of them who have known them
longer and better then I have done: who have given these Testimonials of them:
of Tacitus, quod nemo illo verius narrat, nemo brevius; nihil est in moribus
quod non tangit, in affectibus quod non revelat; mirabilis scripter qui serio
hoc ipsum agit, quod non agit; nec enim historia est sed hortus and seminarium
praeceptorum: nam ut ii qui vestes acu pingunt ingeniose gemmas inserunt sine
noxa formarum, sic ille passim sententias serie narrationis nihil omissa aut
laesa. No man writ more truly, no man more sententiously then Tacitus; there
is not any thing in morality that he has not glanced upon, in our affection
that he has not discovered, and which is strange, where he seems to be
most careless, he is most serious, so that his History is rather a
storehouse of Rules and Precepts, then a History, for that never Artizan did
more artificially insert gems and precious stones in a garment with his needle,
then he has done witty and pithy sentences into his History, without offering
the least wrong or violence unto them. Of Philip Commines, quod pater Historiae
nostro aevo, and ita laudabiliter scripsit ut nihil vereor componere eum cum
quovis antiquorum; Hoc autem laudem ejus auget quod tanta praestitit litterarum
omnino rudis, solo usu rerum peritus and naturali quadam judicii bonitate
indutus, that he is the Father of the Historians of our age, and which does
add much to his praise, that he writ so well having no more learning then he
had. Of Theucydides, quod nec multas nec magnas res scripsit, sed palmam
praeripuit omnibus qui and multas and magnas: elocutione gravis, sententiis
brevis, judiciis sanus, ad actiones vitamque dirigendam orationibus and
excursibus paene divinus: quem quo saepius legas plus auferas, and nunquam
tamen dimittet te sine siti: that he writ not much, nor soared high, but he got
the palm from them that writ much, and of great matters: that he was in his
speech grave, in his sentences short, in his judgment sound, and a Divine in
directing of men how to live; whom the more often you read, the more you will
desire to read, and still apprehend something which you did not before. Of
Matthew Paris, quod arts liberales accurate calluit; Poeta elegans, Orator
facundus, Dialecticus acutus, Philosophus subtilis, Mathematicus non
contemnendus, Historicus percelebris, Theologus solidus, and quod omnium caput
est, integritate and vitae innocentia, purus, simplex, candidus, that he was a
general Scholar, a fine Poet, an eloquent Orator, an acute Logician, a witty
Philosopher, well seen in the Mathematics, a famous Historian, a sound
Divine, and which is better then all, an honest man. These are the men I
acknowledge, who first acquainted me with the Author; for when I first saw
him, and beheld these men familiar with him, having been formerly acquainted
with them, I did conceive that the Companions of them must in some sort be
qualified like unto them; and I was not deceived; for if my judgment fail me
not, he is both useful and delightful, Et prodesse potest, and delectare
libellus.
and a fit Companion for a Prince, and such as serve him in any high place.
Entertain him then, ye to whom the Author has sent him, and the rather
because he is a stranger, and never appeared in the habit of an Englishman
till now. Entertain him I say again and again, and with no less respect
then Alexander did Homer, Scipio Panaetius and Polybius, Augustus Areus and
Athenodorus; and if you find my report of him to be true, ascribe the praise
as it is due to the Author, and afford me your loveing favor, who have made
him known unto you. Vale.

Acatius Evenkellius his Advertisement, to such as are in grace and favor with
their Princes.
WHen of late we met together, and had some conference of the present affairs
of the State, but specially of the fall of Philodoxos: you did seem to wonder
that I should be so confident that his end should be no other then it fell out
to be; and although I did confirm the same unto you, as well by Reason as by
Authority, taken out of the Histories both of ancient and modern times, yet
you were still of opinion that Philodoxos was so deeply scrued in his Princes
favor, that misfortune could not shake him; and did desire me to show you some
Presidents of such as had tasted of the like grace and favor as he did, and
that came to the like end as he did, and withal what the causes were why I
should be so confident that Ruin and Destruction must needs be the end of
him: of which your request or command rather, being ever mindful, I will first
show unto you out of the Treasuries of times both ancient and modern, some
Examples of such as have been highly honored by their Princes, how they ^egan,
how they went on, and how they ended. In the next place as you desired, I will
show you the causes of so sudden a change and alteration; and lastly play the
part of a Physician, prescribe remedies, both to Prince and People, that both
the one and the other, as far forth as lies in the power of man to do, may
avoid those dangers.

CHAP. I. Of Examples.
That I may begin with the Examples of the sacred Histories; 1 Ioab Davidis
regis in utraque fortuna individuus diu comes.
1 Ioab who was for a long time King David's bosom friend in both fortunes, the
Captain of his Guard, and one well seen as well in Military discipline as in
Civil government, and not ignorant of the fashion of the Court, by which
means, he grew gracious in the eyes of King and people; who to give the King
contentment put Vriah to death; having neither law nor reason for his warant;
and to the end he might endear himself more and more unto him, cunningly 2
Rabbathae Ammoniorum urbis captionem regi suo reservavit.
2 he ascribed the taking of Rabbath a City of the Ammonites unto him, by
reason of which his service he grew so infinitely proud that not considering
how odious such kind of persons are in the sight of God and men, he was so
bold 3 Absalonem contra expressum Regis mandatum confodit.
3 contrary to the express command of the King, to lay violent hands upon
Absalom the Kings son; in hostility he was with his Father, and by
consequence, by the laws of arms, worthy of death: yet he had no Warrant to
do what he did; and for that the King took his death very heavily, he was
so presumptuous as malepertly to upbraid him, and to stir up the people to
revolt and quit their allegiance; nay it so fell out that not long before by a
most barbarous treachery 4 Abnerem ducem Israelitarum and Amasam ducem Iudaeorum
per summam perfidiam occiderat.
4 he slew Abner a Captain of the Israelites, and Amasa, a Captain of the
Jews, that stood in competition with him, and were upon the point to be
admitted into his place by the King: to conclude, which is worthy of
observation, he seditiously 5 Adoniam juvat.
5 assisted Adonijah, the Kings son, to usurp his fathers territories, in his
life time; for the which 6 Iussu Regis interemptus.
6 by the Kings Command he was put to death by King Solomon his son before the
altar, Haman the son of Amadathus, of the tribe of Agge, Ahasuerus raised and
set above all the Pears of his Kingdom, and commanded that all his servants
should honor and reverence him; which gracious favor of his he abused to
satisfy his intolerable pride, and cruelty, when as 7 Toto^ gentem Iudaeorum
propter odium unius Mardochaei.
7 for the hatred he bare to, Mordochee, he obtained license of the King, that
he might sacrifice the whole Nation of the Jews; but fortune turning of her
wheel, as God would have it, he by the Kings command was hanged on the same
tree which he had prepared for Mordochee. To come unto the Roman Histories,
which will show unto us (which is strange) that the most flourishing times of
the Empire will afford us most Examples in this kind. I will begin with Aelius
Seianus, a notable pattern of humane frailty, he was come of a Noble house
and by his policy so wond himself into the favor of 8 Illum tam superbum tam
saevum, tam violentum impe^atorem
8 Tiberius Caesar, that proud licentious cruel, inconstant ambitions
Emperor, that though he were reserved and close unto all others, yet to him he
was open and free, he had a body indefatigable; a bold spirit, close in any
thing that concerned himself, but a deep searcher in other men's secrets,
openly modest and shamefast, but within full of flattery, pride and ambition;
and to accomplish his ambitious designs he did very often use briberie and
entertainments in excess, but more often Industry and vigilance; by his
Industry and cunni^g he insinuated himself into the affections of the
pretorian company, 9 Cohortibus praetoriis praefectus.
9 for he being Chief ^ommander of them he summoned them very often to come
together, and by coming amongst them and 10 Irrepere caepit, in milita^es
animos adeundo, appellando
10 calling them by their names he won their hearts, and the hearts of the
Centurions and Tribunes; neither did he forbear to come among the Senators,
and to gratify some with honors, others with authority; for Tiberius did so
much honor him that he made him not only privy to his Counsels, 11 Per
theatra effigies ejus inter Principes legionum coli statuit.
and actions, but upon all occasions graced him in the presence of the Elders,
and the people, 11 he suffered his statues to be adored in the Courts and
theater, among the statues of the Princes. Sejanus weighed all things
diligently and duly considered of things before they happened, and therefore
that he might not lose the power which he had with the multitude, and such as
daily did resort unto him, he never absented himself long from his own
house, but came home to entertain them, where he received them courteously,
ever showing his readiness to procure pardon for such as were delinquents; and
that he might the better bring to pass his designs 12 Vitam procul Roma
^maenis locis ducere persuasit.
12 he prevailed with Tiberius to leave Rome and to live far remote in the
country; for he thought Tiberius being grown in years, and retired into the
contry that he might with less opposition pass through those places which he
held; he provided likewise that none might have access to Tiberius, but by
him, and that he might have the scanning of all such letters as came to the
Emperor by the hands of the soldiers; but why Tiberius should so much favor
this man, no reason can be given, unless it were for that he once freed him
from a danger that was like to befall him when others forsook him; for it
happened upon a time 13 when Tiberius was feasted in a house called Spelunca,
13 Convivium celebratur in villa quae vocatur Spelunca.
the stones that lay at the mouth of the Cave, fell down and slew diverse
therein, which bred an astonishment in all, and caused them that celebrated the
feast, to run out to save themselves, whilst Sejanus staid with Tiberius,
hung upon his neck, and with all his might and power kept the stones that were
ready to fall upon him from him, as the Soldiers that came to assist him and
saw him hanging, related the matter; after this Sejanus grew greater and
greater, and had the ear of Tiberius ready to anything that he would say,
though it tended to the ruin of the commonwealth, in so much that he grew
into that height of pride and impudency that 14 Nuptias petebat a Livia.
14 he presumed to become a suitor to Li^ia the neice of Tiberius, first wife
to Caius Caesar, the son of Augustus, then to Drusus the son of Tiberius, whom
he had secretly poisoned; at last he took upon him the state of an Emperor,
and esteemed of Tiberius no otherwise then the Governor of a poor Island called
by the name of Capreas, so that all men's eyes and affections were fixed upon
Seianus, and happy did he think himself, that could be the first to be
admitted unto him, unhappy to be the last; who as he observed every thing very
diligently, so especially the words and very looks of the peers of Tiberius:
by which means he grew so gracious with the Senators end the common people,
that in every thing they gave the same honor unto him, as they did unto
Tiberius; their statues in brass were set up alike, their names in all
writings subscribed alike, and the Chariots which carried them unto the
Theaters adorned with gold alike; nay more, it was decreed that when they came
unto Rome, the Consuls whom they chose every fifth year, should meet the one
in as great state and solemnity as they did the other; and should offer the
like Sacrifices to the statues of the one as to the other: so that nothing
being now wanting to Sejanus, or rather the Emperor, (fo so indeed he was,
having got all power into his hands, and wanted nothing but the bare title of
the Emperor, to make him so;) Tiberius began to bethink himself of the danger
he was in; but because Sejanus had so glued to himself the affections of the
Pretorian Soldiers, the Senators and such as were near Tiberius, either with
rewards or with promises of rewards, that nothing could be said or done in
Court, whereof Sejanus had not presently notice: and nothing done abroad that
tended to the dishonor of Tiberius that came unto his ears; Tiberius wisely
by degrees, first secretly underhand, afterward more openly took a course to
ruin Sejanus, and to frustrate all his designs. Behold here a notable example
of humane frailty, and a singular pattern for such as are in grace and favor
with their Princes, to put them in mind the higher they are, the more
reverently and submissively to carry themselves; this man that was in the
morning attended upon like an Emperor, in the evening was thrown into prison
like a beggar; whom not long before the people adorned with Crowns of gold,
not long after they bound with fetters of iron; whom as their Lord they
honored, they beat as their slave: whom they adored and sacrificed unto as
unto a God, they reviled and dragd unto death most ignominiously like a rogue;
the same day that the Senate did him all the honor that they could, the people
would have carbonaded him, and have pulled him in pieces: this man that had so
much that he could not desire more, either of God or Man to make him happy
whilst he lived, before he dyed had so little that he had not wherewithal to
gratify the hangman; a notable pattern I say of humane frailty; yet more of
this kind will I show unto you; In the pulling down of Sejanus, Tiberius used
the assistance of Nevius Sertorius Macro, whom not long before he secretly
made Commander of the Praetorian Company: and the Senate conceived so well of
him, that by a decree they conferred all Sejanus his honors upon him; but he
being terrified by an example that was so fresh in memory, refused to accept
them; yet not long after it so happened that he became exceeding powerful,
and applied himself wholly to Caius Caligula, and studied how to make him
Emperor after Tiberius, insomuch that when Tiberius understood it, 15
Occidentem fugientem, orientalem persequentem solemn illum exprobravit.
15 he upbraided him for abandoning the setting, and adoring the rising Sun;
but Caligula in the end requited him for his good will, putting him together
with his wife to death with Claudius Coesar: the most powerful men were his
freed men, and amongst them Narcissus and Pallas, whom he used to several
purposes; the one as his Secretary to write his Letters, the other as his
Orator to make his speeches, whose services he requited by a decree of the
Senate, not only with infinite treasure, but with places of Authority and
Command: insomuch that upon a time inquiring what the reason was that his
Treasury was so empty: answer was made, that it would be full enough if that
the money that was taken forth of it by Narcissus and Pallas, were put into it;
with these men and their wives Claudius was so enamoured that he became rather
their Servant then their Sovereign: at their disposal were all Honors,
Armies, Pardons, and Punishments, insomuch that Sextus Aurelius was used to
call 16 Narcissum dominum domini appellat.
16 Narcissus the master of his master; for as Iuvenal says, unto Narcissus
Claudius denied nothing, nay spared not to kill his wife, being commanded by
him so to do; so that Dion affirms he was the most powerful Man of that age,
and of the age past, having a command over Princes, and Cities, and Possessions
amounting to more then four thousand Sesters. This man notwithstanding as
soon as Claudius was dead, Agrippina the wife of Claudius, and Neros Mother
put to death; so that though these kind of men may peradventure during the
lives of the Princes by whom they have been raised, live in grace, yet seldom
do they escape the hands of their successors. As touching Pallas, of whom we
have before spoken, who persuaded and procured Claudius incestuously to marry
Agrippina, his brothers daughter, and afterward to be his Concubine, though
he contracted with the Senate that for any offense past he should not be
questioned; yet Nero observing how proudly he carried himself, exceeding the
limits of a free man, grew in hatred with him, so that after that he had
removed him from all places of Authority which Claudius had conferred upon him,
having had indeed the Key of the Empire in his power, he was by Nero put to
death; the excessive pride of this man is remarkable in this one passage: he
being accused by Nero upon a time for words spoken, when he heard the
Libertines named that should be his accusers, answered, that at home he never
spoke word, but did all by signs and tokens; if the matter were short, he
expressed himself either by his nod or by his hand; if long, by writing. In the
next place, Tigellinus descended of mean Parentage, vicious in his youth,
vicious in his age, who having by his dishonest courses, wherein he grew so
notorious, that be surpassed all the men of his time, crept into Neros favor,
and attained diverse offices of Command and Authority, executed the same with
all kind of cruelty, rapine, and villainy, having corrupted Nero with all kind
of vices, being most inward with him; for when he was angry none except
himself and Pappea durst speak unto him, at length was so bold as to make
some attempt upon Nero himself, yea to forsake him and betray him. But when
Vitellius came to the Crown, the people petitioned him that he might be called
to an account for it, and so being condemned in the midst of his jollities
whilst he was revelling with his Whores, his jaws being first cut off with a
rasor, he 17 Infamem vitam infami exitu faedavit.
17 ended his ignominious life with as ignominious a death. So Vitellius being
promoted to the Empire, within four months after that he overcame Otho, 18
Asiaticum in favorem cepit
18 he took into his favor one Asiaticus a freed man of his, no way inferior
in all kind of villainy 19 Policletos and Patrob ios vetera odiorum nomina
aequabat.
19 to the Policleti and Patrobii the old detestable names amongst the Romans;
but immediately after the death of Vitellius, under Vespasian he received
condign punishment for abusing the power conferred upon him; Commodus the
Emperor had many of these men whom he raised and pulled down again, who after
the time that he fell into the hands of the Southsayers and Conjurers, never
showed himself in public, 20 Ne quicquam sibi annuntiari est passus nisi quod
Perrenius ante tractasset.
20 neither would endure to hear or be told of anything if it had not first
been made known unto Perrenius. This man therefore knowing the Emperors mind,
found out the way how to make himself powerful; he persuaded 21 Persuasit
Co^modo ut lipse deliciis vacaret, and ut curae illi demandarentur.
21 the Emperor to follow his delights, and leave the cares of the
Commonwealth to him: which motion of his the Emperor readily entertained; so
Perrenius is the only man that swayes the Empire, puts to death whom he will,
robbs and spoils whom he will, and all that he may make a prey out of every
thing, and enrich himself; but why did this man thus tyrannyse? did he think
that though he had power for a time, that it would continue for ever? no; for
as soon as he was made chief Commander of the Horse in the British war, his
villanyes being everywhere divulged, he was called by no other name then by the
name of the Enemy of the Armies, and was delivered over by the Soldiers to be
pulled in pieces; Herodian writes that because he did conspire with his son
to kill Commodus and usurp the Empire, they were both put to death. If either
of these were true, it serves well enough for our purpose. To succeed Perrenius
Commodus chose Cleander from amongst them that waited upon him in his bed
chamber, being a man of mean Parentage; this man so much abused the favor of
Commodus, that 22 Omnes praefecturas pro libitu vendit and distribuit.
22 he sold all offices of Command and Authority, disposed of them and took
them away again, at his will and pleasure, sent for such home as were in
exile, and preferred them to places of dignities, disannuld the decrees of the
Courts of Justice, and made havoc and sale of every thing, yea so bewitched the
Emperor that he procured Burrhus the Emperors brother in law, his own
Sisters husband with many others that stood out in his defense, to be put to
death, for no other cause as he could surmise, but for suspicion that he
desired to be Emperor; and this displeasure Cleander took against him, because
that Birrhus observing his unruly courses, freely reprehended him for them, and
made the Emperor acquainted with his actions; but these enormious offenses
escaped not unpunished, for in the end he smarted for them; Arrius Montanus
being by his plots and conspiracies put to death, for crimes laid to his charge
which he never did; It drew the Emperors wrath upon him, and occasioned deadly
hatred in the people, insomuch that they made an insurrection; for pacification
whereof (as Herodian and Dion observe,) the Emperor was compelled to send his
Soldiers amongst them; but until they saw the head of Cleander they would not
be pacified; wherefore the Emperor caused his head to be cut off, and to be
set upon a pole, which when they saw, there was an end of the business, all
parties were agreed. To succeed him were called Iulianus and Regillus, but they
continued not long in his favor.

Severus the Emperor raised Plautianus Afer from a very mean estate, to be
very potent and mighty by confiscated goods, which he conferred upon him, yet
kept from him all places of Command and Authority, whose gracious favor he so
much abused to the exercise of his cruelty, that he became more tyrannical
then any of the Princes of former times; for when Severus preferred in Marriage
Plautianus his Daughter to his Son Anthony against the will of Anthony, for
which he distasted both his Wife and Father, and threatened to kill them both,
and so to aspire to the Empire, Plautianus considering then what danger he was
in, and on the other side being spurred on with a desire of Sovereignty,
knowing well the age and weakness of the Emperor, and his own power, bethinks
himself how he might kill the Father and the Son, and so attain the
Empire, and avoid the danger he was like to fall into, if Anthonyes design
should take effect; the executioner being sent to do the deed when Plautianus
should give the word; the Treachery being discovered, 23 Convictus jussu
Antonii occisus est.
23 Plautianus was apprehended, and being convicted by the Command of Anthony
in the presence of Severus was put to death. Unto these Roman examples, I will
add one of the Graecians, with Philip of Macedon, the last King of that name.
There was a young man called Apelles that was so powerful that he might more
properly be called a King then a Favorite; for that every City in Greece more
observed and feared him then they did the King; the King therefore by the
advice of Aratus, taking it to heart that this man looked after nothing more
then the Empire, 24 Authoritatem omnem momento ademit.
24 on a sudden cast him off; whereupon he was thrown into Prison, and
shortly after put to death. Polybius writing this History, takes occasion to
show how happy and unhappy they that live in Princes Courts, may be in a very
moment of time; he compares them unto suffrages, which are accustomed to be
given in Common-councells; for as in Counsels says he, it is in the power of
the Senators to give Brass or Silver, so in the Courts of Princes, it is in
the power of the Prince to give honor or dishonor, to make their servants
either happy or miserable. Hiero King of Syracuse in Sicilie, when he dyed left
his Kingdom to Hieronymo, his Nephew; and for that he was a child, he
appointed fifteen to see him virtuously educated, amongst whom was Andronorus
his son in law; but the King was scant laid in his grave, but Andronorus
ambitious of Command, eased the rest of that office of trust which was
committed unto them, affirming that Hieronymo was old and able enough himself
to govern the Kingdom; but by waving of the office which to him with others
was jointly committed, he got all the power into his own hand, Hieronymo being
young and vitiously addicted, fell into all manner of evil courses, and
suddenly came to an untimely end. Upon whose death Andronorus possessed
himself of the Tower, and a great part of the City, and fortified it with
Garrisons, for he he thought it more safe to run with the current, and to yield
himself into the hands of the Senate, though his Wife the daughter of King
Hiero mad after Sovereignty, often put him in mind, to the end to encourage
him to proceed in the course he was in, of what Dionysius was used to say,
that a man needed not to saddle a horse to leave a Kingdom, he might do it
well enough on foot, intimating that it is an easy thing when a man will to
part with a fortune, but not easy to attain unto it; yet I say he thought it
more safe for the present to submit o the Senate, who made him one of their
pretors; but 25 Nulla quies in^st animo dominandi Iibidine capto.
5 his thoughts bein once possessed with a desire of Sovereignty, he could not
find contentment in any thing else, 29 Vxore illum praesertim instigante.
26 his wife principally animating him thereunto, t lling him that now is the
time (if ever) to stir in it, whilst the waters are troubled, whilst the
Soldiers are ready to accept of better pay then the Kings: and whilst
Hannibals Captains are there ready to further his design. Which persuasion so
prevailed with him that a second time he took it into consideration, how he
might attain to the Kingdom, which being discovered, he together with
Themistius to whom he had disclosed the whole matter, was in the Senate house
put to death.

We will pass from hence to the Historyes of other Countries and Ages.
Richard the first King of England, reposed so much trust in William Bishop of
Ely, as that he made him Chancellor of England, Keeper of his great seal,
and Lieuetenant of the Tower of London: at the same time he prevailed with the
Pope to make him Legate a Latere of England, France, and Jreland: and when he
was to pass the Seas to wage War with the Saracens, he left the Government of
the Kingdom wholly to him, and gave this charge to his Subjects, that as they
loved him and his Kingdom, and as they desired to live in peace and
prosperity, and to enjoy their Possessions in safety, that they would show
themselves obedient to his trusty and well-beloved Chancellor in all things
that he should direct them that did concern him, as if that he were personally
present; so this man is now the greatest man in all the Western parts, being in
the Kings absence the Metropolitan of all England; 27 Dignitates quas pretio
com paraverat immodetate exercuit.
27 he executed the Diginities which he purchased at dear rates, with
excessive cruelty, and oppression: and all respect of honesty set apart, bent
his thoughts only how he might fill the baggs again which he had emptied; to
attain unto them he turned Usurer, and executed the office of Legate a latere,
which cost him a thousand pound, with such cruelty, that he became a burden
and eyesore to all the clergy of England: he seldom rid with a less number
then fifteen hundred of the Clergy to attend him, and a band of Soldiers, as
if he had been a King, as my Author says, and not a Bishop; he was attended by
the Sons of the Nobility, whom he married to his kindred, and happy did he
think himself that could be gracious in his eyes,; there was no Land to be
sold which he bought not, no Church or Dignity void which he did not either
bestow upon his friends or himself; the keeping of all Castles and Towns by
one means or other he engrossed, and prevailed so by his power that he did
what he would, and no man durst once open his mouth to contradict him in any
thing. But it so happened that John Earl of Mortaigne, the Kings Brother,
calling the Peers together to consult of the affairs of the State, sent for
this man likewise, assuring him that he should safely come and go: but he
suspecting them, instead of coming unto them betook himself for refuge to the
Tower of London; whereupon it was agreed by the Lords, that he by whom the
Church of God and People had received so much detriment, should no longer
govern in the Kingdom. This Chancellor and his Adherents had so deceived the
Kingdom of the Treasury, that there was scarce any man that wore a girdle that
had any silver in it, any woman a chain, any Noble man a ring, or any Jew had
money, and indeed scarce any thing of worth was left in the Kingdom; The Kings
Treasury was emptied and nothing but the keys and empty vessels found there;
The State of the Kingdom standing thus, it was decreed that he should take an
oath to relinquish all the power he had, not to bear any sway any longer in
the Government of the Commonwealth, and to yield up all the Castles that were
committed to his charge, especially the Tower of London; These things he put
in pledges to perform, and left his Office of Legate a latere, which he
executed a year and a half to the great prejudice of the Church of England,
and the sea of Rome; at last he put off his accustomed habit, and in a woman's
apparel he determined to cross the Seas: but at Dover his dalliance with a
wench being discovered by a Mariner, he was hill at, beaten, and afterward
dragged through the streets to prison: from whence as soon as he was fully
delivered, he most ignominiously, and basely stole into Normandy; his end was
the more miserable, by how much his fortunes were the greater. Afterward there
28 Fuit quidam Comes Warwicensis qui a Rege E. 4. ^summam potestatem erectus
oral.
28 was an Earl of Warwick in the same Kingdom, that was raised to such a
height both of power and Estate by King Edward the fourth, that he was not
afraid to lay violent hands upon the Queens Father, and with many of his
children and nearest friends, to put him to death; he placed such Officers
about the King as he thought would do him best service, and in the end took him
Prisoner. But not long after the King escaping into Burgondy, being assisted
by Charles the then Duke, he returned home, overcame the Earl, and made him
fly for succor into France; the Earl thence returning being assisted with
diverse Attendants, put the King to the worst, and made him fly into Holland for
succor. A second time the King returning being assisted by the aforesaid Duke,
set upon him, overcame him and slew him with his Brother and many others.

In the Reign of King Henr^ the eighth, there was one named 29 Tho. Wols^us sub
H. 8.
29 Thomas Wolsey that was very great with the King, a man meanly descended,
but so proud and haughty, that he became an eyesore not only to the Peers and
Nobility, but even the King himself. By the Kings special grace and favor he
was promoted to the highest dignities, to be Arch-Bishoh of York, Bishop of
Winchester, to be a Cardinal, to be sent Ambassador, and indeed next to the
King, to bear the greatest sway in the Kingdom: but amongst other acts of his,
this was not the least that brought him in disgrace, when King Henry began to
distaste Queen Catherine, and to dote upon Anne of Boloyne, this man undertook
to procure a dispensation from the Pope, which taking not so well as the King
and he thought it would have done, by degrees he fell out of the Kings favor,
and being apprehended by Thomas Duke of Norfolk, was banished the Court, and
confined to his Bishopric of Winchester, which he taking to heart with very
grief dyed.

The Kingdom of France will afford us many Examples in this kind; and amongst
those, it is reported of the Earl of S. Paul, that having been advanced by
Lewis the eleventh to be Constable of France, and to many other honors, and
preferments, out of which he raised a very great revenue, that in the end he
so much forgate himself, that he studied how to make the King stand in awe of
him: and for that purpose 30 Mediocriter se gessit inter tres principes.
30 he ever carried himself indifferently between the King his Master, the
King of England, and the Duke of Burgondy, one while standing for the one,
another while for the other, ever desiring to keep them at variance, that so
the one or the other might still stand in need of him. And so it happened that
the King his Master desiring to speak with him, he would not come unto him,
but with a power able to withstand him if occasion were offered: he met him
upon a Bridge where he talked with him as sawsily as if he had been his equal,
and familiar, supposing that to be the way to preserve and increase the power
he had obtained; but he was deceived; for all men seeing his malepertnesse and
insolency, were offended at him, and studied how to pull him down. And it so
happened that coming to the Duke of Burgondy, upon safe conduct, the Duke
apprehended him, and sent him to the King his Master with all such Letters as
he had formerly written to him against the King. Upon which being araigned, as
also upon such Letters as he had written unto the King of England, was
thereupon condemned, his estate confiscated, and he put to death.

In the same Kingdom under Philip the fair, one Taggerrandus Marrianus
attained to so much power, that nothing was done in the Kingdom without his
approbation; 31 Peculatus accusatus suspendio affectus est.
31 yet this man for robbing the Kings Treasures was accused, condemned and
hanged. 32 Petrus Landaicus apud ducem Britaniae potens.
32 Peter Landais likewise with the Duke of Britain attained to the like
favor; yet by the violence of the multitude he was taken from the Duke, and
judicially condemned and hanged, as Paulus Aemilius in his History of France
relates the story.

To pass over into Spain; in the Kingdom of Castile, there was 33 Alvarus de
Luna.
33 Alvarus de Luna, borne in Arragon, of a Noble house, but a Bastard borne
out of Wedlock, that grew to such a height of power with King John, that no
man in the Kingdom was so powerful as he; he took arms against John King of
Navarre, and used all means to oppress Henry Knight of the order of Saint
James; but it so fell out that the Queen opposing him, by the assistance of the
second King of Navarre, and Henry Knight of the order, they surprised the King,
and compelled Alvarus to live upon his own possessions; and happy had he
been if he could have so contented himself; but he that once tasted of the
sweetness of Sovereignty, can hardly find contentment in a private life; he
begins then a second time to bethink himself how he might attain to his
former height, from which he was thrown down: he sets the King at liberty,
installs him in the Kingdom, sits at the stern, keeps under his Enemies, and
incenses the King against them; but this prosperity continued not, and brought
him to an untimely death; for, when as by the Kings special Commandment, one
of the Nobility delivered a message unto him which was not pleasing, he caused
the Messenger to be thrown out of the window, for the which the King did
afterward ever more hate him then he did formerly love him; for caused him to
be apprehended, and being judicially condemned, to be put to death.

Unto the former I will add the Example of a Germane out of the seventh book
of the Annals of Aventinus. With Rudolfe, Palsgrave of Rheyne, and Duke of
Bavaria, there was Ortho Crondorser in the greatest grace and favor; he came
of mean Parentage, and coming to Court, by his double diligence in readily
observing, and gravely executing whatsoever was committed to his charge, within
a very short time became very gracious in the eyes of the Prince; by little and
little he attained to Honor, and in the end became to be the Kings Vicegerent,
being the greatest officer in Court. This man now relying upon grace and favor
which he was in with Rudolphus, began to grow insolent, to talk wantonly of
Rudolphus, and his Mother, and to sow dissension between them, which drew the
hatred of them both upon him, and caused them to make him an Example; for by
Rudolphus he was taken and cast into Irons, and by his Mother his eyes were
pulled out, and his tongue that had talked so freely of her, was cut out of his
head.

The next Example is of Hungary, 34 Ludovicus primus porentissimus Rex
Hungariae.
34 Lewis, the first of that name, being the most powerful King of Hungary
left behind him one only daughter named Maria, whom by his last Will and
Testament, with the consent of his Counsel, he bequeatheth unto Sigismond
Marquess of Brandenburgh, the son of the Emperor Charles the fourth, being
but of tender years; yet so that until she came to full age she should not
marry him, but afterward should admit him her Companion in Sovereignty and
Conjugall society: but in the mean time she should be sole Commander, and
crowned with the title of King; in this time lived her Mother Elizabeth, the
Wife of King Lewis, who during her minority had a hand over her; with both whom
there was one Nicholas Gara, whom Lewis had formerly advanced to be a Count
Palatine, that was nobly descended, and exceeding rich, on whom both the Mother
and the Daughter so much relied, that what he said was a Law, they would do
nothing without him; he now attaining to such Grace and Favor, did many ill
offices, advised the young Queen not to suffer her Peers to grow too great, for
thereby she should diminish her own sovereignty, and give them encouragement
to attempt new designs; but so to handle them, that they might have no power
to hurt her: To take from such as were grown popular and potent all offices of
command and authority, and to bestow them on such as were men of known
Integrity. To conclude, he was a man gotten into so great favor with the
Queen, that what he spoke was a Law, and what he advised only was put in
execution; at which the Peers were highly offended, and did conceive unplacable
wrath, not only against Gara, but against the Queen, and laid their heads
together how they might take from him all government in the Commonwealth; for
that much troubled them that she should so much dote upon that one man, that to
give him contentment she should neglect and oppress all the rest of the
Nobility; whereupon they sent for 35 Carolus parvus.
35. Carolus Parvus out of Apuleia, and in the presence both of the Mother and
the Daughter, set the Crown upon his head, and proclaimed him King. But they
being greedy of Revenge, and thirsting to be restored again to the Kingdom,
by the council of Gara, they procured on Plasius Forgace de Chyines to kill
Charles in the conclave; and so by his means they attained their former
government; and this they did for the most part by the consent of the people:
for after that Charles was once crowned, the people fell from him, and repented
themselves of what they had done; but see what follows, the troubled waters
being well settled and they going for their recreation to see some of the lower
parts of the Kingdom, attended on by Gara and some others of the Court: Ilion
the governor of Croatia, a friend and favorour of Carolus parvus, who had
been formerly slain by Gara's procurement, desirous to revenge his untimely
death boldly set upon them, and whilst many run away, Gara stood stoutly to it,
and defended both himself and the Ladies; but in the end near unto their
Chariot was he vanquished and slain. Pippo or Pippus, alias Philippus
Florentinus as Aenaeas Sylvius says, of the family of the Strozzi, having
behaved himself oftentimes very bravely in the Wars, attained to such grace
and favor with Sigismond the Emperor of Hungary, that all men accounted him
the second, many men the first in the Kingdom; insomuch that Sigismond said,
that if Pippo will, it were an easy matter for him to send him with a staff
in his hand out of the Kingdom. Bonfinus writes That he prevailed twenty times
against the Turks: but afterward being made General in the Venetian War,
and having bravely there carried himself for a long time, was in the end by
the Venetians corrupted with Gold to quit the Country, and to return into
Hungary; which being discovered to Sigismond, he caused Gold to be melted, and
to be powered down his throat, and so he came to his death.

Ericus King of Sweden being ill advised, committed many cruel and enormous
offenses; he contracted Matrimony with Catherine his Concubine, and crowned her
equally with great solemnity; a principal furtherer of his wicked enterprises
was Georgius Peirus his Secretary, whom he had exceedingly enriched with the
confiscate goods of the Nobility, at which his proceedings John and Charles his
two Brothers being much offended, and assisted with many of the Peers of the
Nobility, raised Arms against him: besieged him, and would not be satisfied
until they had George delivered unto them: the King to pacify them yielded
unto their demand; who after they had cruelly tormented him, divided him into
four parts, and so he sustained condign punishment for his many offenses. I
might produce many Examples more; and as Iustus Lipsius says, I should never
make an end, if I shoud reckon up all Examples in this kind which every Age
does afford; for this one Age afford us many Examples of note, as Wolfgange
Rinuphius who was advanced by Rodolfe Caesar, M. Euzlius by Frederick Duke of
Wittinburgh in France, Charles Duke of Guyse, Biron, and of late years
Marquess D' Anchre.

CHAP. II. Of Causes.
IN the next place shall be showed the Causes wherefore the prosperity of these
men is but momentary; and why ruin is for the most part the end of them. The
causes wherefore they continue not in prosperity, that I may briefly sum them
up, are one or both of these. Either because they do obtain their greatness
by wicked practices and divises, or that having duly attained unto it, they do
dishonorably carry themselves in the execution of such offices as are committed
to their charge.

The Counsels of men, and the courses of their lives are different, and have
different success, according to the counsel of him that advises and
persuades: if he advises good things to a good end, the success is good; if
contrariwise, it is bad; so in the world there are diverse callings, according
to the diversity of degrees, sexes and professions, and every calling
different from another; some of us are men, some women; some are fathers,
others children; some Lords and free men, other servants and Ministers; some
rule and govern, others serve and obey; some are separate for the service of
God, others for secular employment. To conclude: 36 Quisque peculiari munere
devinctus est.
36 Every one is called to one calling or other, and we may not believe that
this comes to pass by chance, or by the will of man, but by the divine
providence of God, who has appointed to every one both noble and ignoble, rich
and poor, a certain calling before they were borne. David, Cyrus, Jeremy,
Saint Paul the Apostle, were all of them called by God in his appointed time to
a peculiar office; some to bear the office of a King, others of a Priest,
others to other offices. So God in the beginning by the eternal decree of his
divine providence made every one of us; first man, then woman; Then gave him a
charge to look to this or that Country; no man is free or called to be idle,
for we may not think that God so neglects any one as that he should not put
to a helping hand, and act his part upon the stage of the world, for the
public good; there is no man I say, no not the most contemptible man in the
world, on whom he has not imposed some charge or other, which although for a
time it may seem but mean, yet God oftentimes in the dust shows his power, and
omnipotency. David for many years was a poor shepherd, and lived in Exile,
yet at length became a king of kings. 37 Contemptus a fratribus.
37 Joseph was hated of his brethren, 38 Venditus in servitutem.
38 sold into bondage, 39 Conjectus in carcerem.
39 cast into Irons, at length made chief governor in Egypt. Seeing then that
there is nothing more certain then that every one is called by God in his
appointed time, we ought to attend his good will and pleasure, and not to run
before we are called of him. Therefore in what condition or state of life we
are, we ought to live to the glory of God and the good of our neighbors, which
if we neglect we labor in vain, to our own destruction; this is therefore
the first cause why those that thrust themselves into businesses out of their
calling, and take upon them things beyond their strength, incur the hatred
both of God and men; for those men never dream of God or goodness, but 40 Per
aequa and iniqua gratiam principis acquirere.
40 seek by fraud and bribery, calumnies and all other wicked practices to
attain to their ends.

First, how to procure their Princes favor, then how to attain the chiefest
place about him, by ruinating such as stand in their way. So did Tigellinus, as
Tacitus observes, by his lewd practices, in which only he did excel, serve
himself into the favor of Nero, and obtained from him rewards due to the best
deserving; So did Macro win the favor of Caius Caesar by relinquishing of
Tiberius, yea while he lived, and by standing for him to succeed in the Empire,
as the same Author reports; so did Perenius to make himself more powerful,
seduce Commodus to all manner of licentiousnes; so did William Bishop of Ely by
his bribery obtain the chiefest places of note both in the Church and common
weal; so did Seianus of whom we have spoken of before; amongst many other of
his wicked practices, that he might remove Densus his competitor, made love
unto his wife, lay with her, and what with promise of marriage, and in putting
her in hope to be his consort in the Empire, caused her to have a principal
hand in her husbands death. So did Pallas by his adultery win the love of
Agrippina the wife of Claudius Caesar and mother of Nero, and all to keep his
former greatness; It is a thing most odious and abominable in Courtiers, that
they should not think of any other means to purchase their Princes favor,
then by commending unto them the beauty and comely feature of men's wives and
Sisters, thereby to set their affections on fire, and bind him unto them; it
is an odious and abominable thing likewise, yet a common thing in this age, and
in all times has been, for such as follow the courts of Princes, to obtain or
retain their Princes favor, to put in execution any wicked act, if so be that
he command them: So did Ioab readily put in execution the command of King
David, and slew Vriah; so did Cardinal Woolsey allow of the divorce of King
Henry the eight, and Queen Katherine, and all that he might revenge the wrong
that he supposed was offered him by the Emperor. When Nero took distaste
against his sometimes beloved Octavia, his Courtiers presently, especially
those of the nobility, fearing their wives, they commended Acts unto him, and
in this business Annaeus Serenus a great acquaintance of Senacae's had a great
hand, he made love unto her, covered and took upon himself the extravagancies
of the young Prince, and such gifts as the Prince had bestowed upon her
secretly, he avouched to be his openly. But men that deal in businesses of this
kind, are for the most part false and perfidious; for when they have once
transgressed the bonds of modesty, their affections are inflamed and they are
never satisfied: Annaeus Seneca in other things most wise, was in this kind
faulty, when he with Byrrhus in an oration persuaded Nero to put his mother to
death, for that they supposed that if she lived, he could not; and although
afterward he made an Oration to extenuate his offense; yet that did rather
aggravate the same, then any way extenuate it. The reward and deserved wages of
these kind of men is for the most part sin and destruction, as Tacitus
observes of Tiberius: For as Princes would not have themselves to be
circumvented by others, so when they have their designs once effected, they
hate and punish the executioners, having Instruments ever ready to execute
their commands; 41 Graviorum facinorum ministri ut exprobra^tes aspiciuntur.
41 for Princes ever behold the instruments of villainy with threatening looks;
so Alexander the great beheld Parmenio whom he employed in the death of
Attalus, for the which 42 Exprobrat Hermolaus Alexandrum.
42 Hermolaus was not afraid to upbraid him as Curtius observes, saying, thou
usest miserable men to be thy instruments to take away the lives of men, and
anon after thou usest others to take away the lives of those instruments. 43
Sytacles and Cleander experti sunt.
43 This Sitacles and Cleander found by experience to be true, whom Alexander
had made the instruments to kill Parmenio, whose heinous offenses no death
could satisfy, as the same Curtius affirms, adding moreover that many of
Alexanders friends rejoicing to see that his anger was fallen upon the
instruments of his wrath, took not so much distaste against those instruments,
for all the enormous offenses that ever they committed, as they did for that
they had slain Parmenio, and with all adding this, that no power unduely
obtained can continue long.

It is a received opinion that they that attain to any command by unjust
means, by the same means and the like, they support their magnificence; for
none ever that rose unduely governed well, which is well manifested in Sejanus
and in some other, whom we have before remembered; whence it comes to pass
that by how much the longer they have continued in their lewd and wicked
courses of life, adding transgression unto transgression, by so much the more
they become more hateful both to God and man, and at last undergo deserved
punishment.

These men never take into their consideration the true end of which I have
before spoken, that is, The glory of God, and the good of the Commonwealth, but
bend their thoughts only how they may satisfy their pride, covetousness,
cruelty, and their carnal desires, whose condition Seneca has set forth in
his Tragedy, entitled, Hercules Oetaeus, Few hearts love Kings, not few their
Kingly might.
The glorious show of Courtly countenance
Bewitcheth many, where one sets his delight,
How next the King he may himself advance,
That through high streets he may as
lord of rule,
With lofty looks ride mounted on his Mule.
Another would his greedy hunger stanch
With gubs of gold, and though he it possess,
Rich Araby serves not to fill his pining paunch.
And a little after, Another fondling fancy thus does guide,
To fawn on Kings, and still in Court to bide:
As one disdaining now to be like Will,
An ingrain'd clown, the plow to follow still.
And though the dying swain daily keep
at home
A thousand drudges that his land do till,
Yet wants his will, and wishes wealth therefore,
Only to waste on other men the more.
Another claws and flattereth still the King,
That he his neighbor may to ruin bring.


It is ambition which makes a man a stranger to himself, that will not endure a
Superior or an equal, that will be Caesar or none, that possesses us with
this foolish conceit, to think it a disparagement to go in the common road,
and to be an honest man, that makes a man think himself (...) body, whilst he
sees another greater then he, and so dazeleth our eyes that if another go
before us, we will not believe it, but rather that he stands in our way, nay
it is an humor that has this property; that wheresoever it has once taken up
her lodging, it will never suffer a man to rest, until he has attained to the
end of his desires, which he shall never do, (for as Seneca says) 44 Non
patitur quem quam in mensura acquiescere.
44 This is that inconvenience which attends an ambitious humor that it never
suffers a man to rest satisfied though he has attained to the end of his
former wishes and desires; That makes him believe he can do that which is
impossible for him to do, because he is powerful. Wherefore these kind of men
are aptly compared to such as are sick of the dropsy, the more they drink, the
more they desire, as is manifested in Sejanus who being raised out of the dust
to the highest degree of honor, could not there content himself, but studied
how to make himself equal to Caesar; nay, how to displace him and sit in his
Throne. If these kind of men would at any time cast their eyes downwards and
behold from whence they came, it could not but give them much contentment, and
cause them to add some bounds to their unsatiable desires; but they seldom do
so, their eyes and thoughts are ever mounted aloft, for the mind of man is so
unsatiable, that it will not be persuaded but that it can do any thing, be it
never so difficult, or dangerous, if so be he had good success in his former
undertakings. Wherefore Eteocles in Euripides affirms, that if nature had given
to man wings, he would have ascended above the heavens; for so says he of
himself, if I had had ability, I would have tried the paths of the Sun, and
have descended into the Center of the Earth, that I might have ruled as the
Gods do there.

We have heard of Alvarus de Luna, before he tasted of both fortunes, who
though he were once brought upon his knees, he ascended on high again, and
then resolved rather to loose his life, then to change his fortune; therefore
it happened unto him as it does to certain little creatures, who having once
tasted of blood, will sooner break their bellies then quench their Thirst. Of
the fall of Sejanus and such as he was, Iuvenal in his 10. Satyr elegantly
says, That greatness makes many a man subject to the storms of envy and
malice, casts them down headlong into perdition, causes their Statues to be
demolished, brings them to untimely deaths, to the Gallows, and to have their
limbs broken upon the wheel.

Sejanus that not long ago carried a great port with him, and had his head
adorned with Bays and Cammomile, within a short time after had his head taken
from his shoulders to be made a pitcher to drink in, a basin to wash in, and a
platter or pan to fry meat in.

Pride is either the mother or daughter of Ambition, and the offspring of
immoderate prosperity, with the which Courtiers are infected, especially they
they that are most eminent in Court, and have attained to the greatest honors:
An example hereof we have in Pallas a freed man of Nero, who was used to say,
That he did never express himself at home to his servants, 45 Dominutu vel
manu servis suis loquebatur.
45 but either by nod or hand, That he sometimes made use of his pen, but
never of his tongue. We have spoken of the pride of Sejanus already, of whom
Marc. Terentius a Roman Knight was used to say, That he was accustomed to
tell his freed men and door keepers, that to nod was a badge of a Magnifico: 46
Fastus hic hodie maximo in usu est.
46 This kind of pride is come in fashion in our days, and is used by men of
mean rank and condition. Seneca excellently describes it, saying, That it is
the property of a superstitious proud man to stand much upon the going into his
house, he has an opinion that he does highly honor thee, if he suffer thee
to go into it before him; and it is observable that they which stand so much
upon terms of honor in this kind, are of this condition, That they will be
singular, look big, and never salute any man, speak, walk, or eat with any
man; their pride is to become like the man in Seneca, to make the pole
Antartick kiss their toe, and Cynthia to do homage to their Tail; they talk
of Kingdoms and their Fathers possessions, which being once attained, they
forget God, and all goodness; the same Seneca in his Tragedy entitled
Hercules Furens says, that God at every turn meets with the proud man.

Which saying as Philip Commines observes, Lewis the eleventh had often in his
mouth, where pride goes before, there shame follows at the heels: God
resists the proud, and pride goes before a fall; it is remarkable in the
proud man, that he ever hates one of his own condition, and omits no
opportunity to do him mischief; wherefore as at all times they are neglected
and despised by such as have any predominant power over them, so then
especially when they stand in competition for any honors and preferments; for
as they are insociable and care not for the love of any, unless it be to bring
to pass their own designs; so on the other side no man cares for them; so
that in times of adversity, the times of trial of true friendship, they find
the fruits of their folly and arrogance; men of this condition being put in
places of command, ever abuse the power committed unto them to satisfy their
greedy coveteousnesse, as we have seen in Sejanus, Narcissus, Pallas, the
Bishop of Ely, and some others, that they may pill and pole, and do what they
will, have ever opportunity; their friends being powerful, no request is denied
them; all men rescue them, all men observe and obey them; their followers and
attendants, are luxury, pride, pomp and prodigality, which ever add spurrs to
their greedy desires; for they must be maintained, and a little will not do it.
But if these were not, the mind of man is insatiable; for coveteousnesse is of
such a nature, that it will never rest content, full nor fasting, and therefore
is justly said to be the root of all evil, the thing that subverts honesty and
all square dealing between man and man; that occasions pride, cruelty, neglect
of Religion, and the sale and shipwreck of a good conscience, and as Salust
affirms 47 Avaritia bellua immanis, intoleranda.
47 it is a Beast insufferable in a well governed Commonwealth, it depopulates
Countries, Villages, private Families, takes away the good name and reputation
of a man, makes Religion a stalking horse to effect what it desires, and is of
that power and efficacy that no Power, or Bulwark, or Army, is able to
withstand it; it prevails with the Virgin to submit her thoughts to unchaste
desires; it prevails with the Father to withdraw his affections from his
Child, and with the Child to make him neglect his duty to his Father; it is a
fault, and a great one in a mean man, but it is more dangerous in him that is
powerful and mighty; wherefore Cicero says, that their is no vice more
hateful in Princes, and such as govern the Commonwealth, then
Coveteousnesse; for to make sale of the Commonwealth is not only
dishonorable, but wicked and unjust. Hence it is that these kind of men are
odious in the eyes both of Prince and People; who although they may tyrannise
and oppress the people, and by reason of their greatness no man dares once
open his lips against them: yet God that ever takes the quarrel of the poor
into his hands, and punishes wrong doers, will discover their devises and
bring them unto shame and dishonor: Their riches shall be made snares to
entrap them, and like sponges chrusht together shall they send forth the water
which they have so greedily sucked up. Another Vice which generally attends
greatness, is Cruelty, which they use to keep Inferiors in awe, that they
should not dare to do any thing that tends to the diminishing of their
greatness; their hatred is like Hamans, making of a Mountain a Molehill;
small offenses to be capital, and punishing them with utter ruin and
destruction; for these men having guilty Consciences, never dream of virtue or
honesty, but seek by punishments to keep men in awe: Yea, 48 Dicta in se
ulciscuntur.
48 they punish words against themselves in a high degree; a Prince by
forgiving of hasty words purchases to himself Fame and Renown; but they,
unless they take revenge of their Enemies, have a conceit that the people
conceive they are not in that grace and favor with their Princes as formerly
they were; for example in this kind we may produce Joab, who by treachery
slew Abner and Amasa, whose lives King David spared; but what befell to Haman
and Joab, no man is ignorant. Another ill quality that reigns for the most
part in great men, is, that they respecting more their own private then the
public good, lay heavy burdens upon the shoulders of the Subjects, and if
they find the Princes disposition so to do, they are ever putting him in
mind of it; if not, they will advise him to it; if the Prince require one
penny of the Subjects, they cry two; if he do but threaten, they cry hang him;
it is good they cry for a Prince to be terrible, inexorable, cruel; and for
men of mean rank to be mild, liberal, and familiar; it is a tenet amongst
them that is better to rule by fear, then by love; that it is lawful for a
Prince to do what he will; that every man's Estate is in his power; nay, with
Polinices in Seneca they cry, The Prince that fears disdainful hate
unwilling seems to reign,
The God that swayes the golden globe,
together has these twain
Conjoined and coupled, hate and rule;
and him do I suppose
To be a Noble King indeed, that can
supplant his foes,
And Subjects cancred hate suppress.


They enveigh against Parliaments, and use all means to bring the Prince out of
love with them, and study how to hinder them, ever buzzing in his ears, that
what is done there, is done for private ends, without any respect to the Common
good. If the Prince make any wise and discreet Judges, they must presently
become their creatures, do what they will have them, and keep nothing secret
which they will have made known; 59 Divisiones and factiones serunt.
49 they sow dissension, and maintain a Faction ever amongst the people,
supposing that there is no better means to keep them in obedience then this,
for that one Faction will be ever ready to assist the King to suppress the
other, and be an occasion to bring some grist to their Mill; so that while they
are busied about their private injuries, they conceive public wrongs which
concern the Common good will never be remembered, and so they themselves by
this means escape unpunished: by their good will they will never suffer
private quarrels to be taken up, or public grievances to be fully redressed,
that so occasion may be ministered of daily attendances at the Court, but
especially upon them, whereby they may show their power of suppressing the one,
and supporting the other, as they take affection; for which reason they will
not suffer the Prince to grant a pardon, but in special cases, to any
Delinquent, but upon condition. In all businesses between the King and his
People, where their Council is required, they speak ambiguously and subtly,
for they fear nothing more then that the people should suppose that they do
not stand indifferent between the Prince and them. Such Councillors had
Rehoboam King of the Jews, who when hls Subjects complained unto him of heavy
burdens laid upon them by his Father, by the advice of his Council, answered
them, that his little finger should lie more heavy upon them then all his
Fathers body; my Father chastned you with whips, but I will chasten you with
Scorpions: such a kind of fellow was Nicholas Gara, a Count Palatine of the
Kingdom of Hungary, who being exceeding powerful with Queen Mary the
daughter of Lewis the first, gave his Counsel that she should not suffer her
Peers to become too powerful, as we heard before; but how his Counsel took
effect, I have before remembered, and what befell to the Councillors of
Rehoboam, every one can tell: Sleidan reports that William Poyets the French
Kings Chancellor was by the Kings special command taken out of his bed and
cast into Prison, with the general applause of the people; for that during the
four years that he held his office he had offended all sorts of people. Such
is generally the end of these sort of people; for when the Prince is once fully
informed of their conditions, to satisfy the people, they punish them to their
ruin and destruction. Examples hereof we have in Cleander, Peter Lindais,
George Peiras, and others, concerning whom Philip Comines demands this queston,
and gives this answer; who dares, says he, enquire into the actions of these
Grandees? who dare call them in question? who dare be the Judge to execute
judgment upon them if they offend? the answer is, the inquisition will be the
lamentation and cries of the people, whom they have mercilesly oppressed and
trampled upon in every kind; the tears of the Widows and Orphans, whose
Husbands and Fathers they have put to death, and generally all they whom they
have persecuted either in their Bodies or Estates; these will bring in an
inquisition against them, and deliver them over to receive their doom of him
who is the only true judge, that will not peradvanture expect any other
evidence, but will punish them in this life: so much has Philip Comines, 50
Lex talionis.
50 the Law of Talio is justly inflicted upon them; It is good justice, that
they who have despised and contumeliously behaved themselves to wards others,
should be despised, and contumeliously handled by others; that they who proudly
insulted over others, should be reproachfully spoken of by others; that they
who by rapine and fraud have gotten the Estates of others, should suddenly
have their Estates by others taken from them; that they that showed no mercy,
should expect no mercy; that they that commanded others to be dragged to
execution, should be dragged themselves; that they that caused others that
stood for the Church to be put to death, should in the Church be put to death
themselves; that they that endeavored to deprive the Subject of his rights and
privileges, should not only lose the benefit of them, but the benefit of the
Law of Nations; that they that caused others to be put to death against the
Law, should before they be heard or accused, be put to death themselves; that
they which caused the rigor of the Law to be inflicted upon others, should
have the same measure measured unto them, as is reported of 51 Perillus.
51 Perillus, who was the first that felt the punishment of the torment that
he himself invented. These punishments do not only belong unto them that
attain unto their greatness by undue means, but likewise unto them who being
deservedly preferred, do in the due execution of their places misbehave
themselves; for 52 Non sufficet been coepisse.
52 it is not sufficient to begin well, but we must prosecute our good
beginnings with suitable proceedings, which is a very hard thing for him to do,
who has attained to a great fortune; for 53 Fortuna est coena and eos efficet
caecos quo^om plexa est.
53 fortune being blind her self, makes them blind likewise for the most part
whom she doteth upon and favors; for while we are lulled asleep in her lap,
we grow careless, and give occasion to such as love us not, to circumvent us;
so as when there is no other cause, yet too too great prosperity willl find in
it self sufficient cause to bring us to our graves with shame and ignorance.
Therefore it is no wonder if such as have power to do what they will, standing
in fear of none, become proud and insolent, and have their imperfections made
known unto the world; for being on high they can do nothing but notice is
taken of it, whereas if they lived in a mean rank, their faults would pass
unregarded; our nature is such; there is no good thing in the world but it
abuses, but most of all the prosperity and good fortunes we enjoy: And why?
because our wills being prone to all wickedness, our prosperity adds spurs unto
it, and does not only move, but continually administer occasion unto us to
satisfy our unbridled lusts and affections.

Such as have attained to the greatest favor with their Princes, by reason of
their daily familiarity with them, have in the end become most odious and
contemptible in their height. Sejanus, Tiberius only minion for the time, for
that he styled himself Emperor, and Tiberius governor of a poor Island,
Tiberius hated and detested; the servant that has been delicately brought up
from a Child will challenge to himself the privilege of a son at last,
says Solomon. For presuming upon the favor of their Princes, they make them
the subject of laughter, neglect their commands, vilify them, and mock them,
assuming the honor of what is done to themselves, attributing nothing to the
power of the Prince. So Joab slew Absalom the son of King David, with his
own hand of his own accord, without the Kings approbation: And though it was
told him when he was about to do the deed, that it was the Kings will to have
his life saved, and that he would call him to an account for it, yet he went
on grieving the perplexed King with most unbeseeming and unmannerly terms; but
such things as these Princes forget not, but keep them in a Register.

Tacitus reports how that Pallas through his pride exceeding the bounds of a
free man, drew hatred upon himself, and how that Narcissus for that he slew
Messalina, the Wife of Claudius without his consent, put Claudius into a kind
of a frenzy, and made him in passion say, that Narcissus durst never attempt
those things upon his Wife, though she had deserved it, unless that he had
first despised her Husband. Such another was the Earl of St. Paul that was
Constable of France, of whom I have spoken before, who upon all occasions
relying on the favor of the Duke of Burgondy, and the King of England, would
rise in rebellion against his Prince: and that his power and greatness might
still continue together with his stipends from the King which were exceeding
great, he ever labored to keep the King in War, that so he might be
beholding to him to assist him when occasion offered it self; for he together
with his associats did rather aim at their private good then the good of their
Country. But these and the like devises, as they are most ridiculous in
themselves, so they are to none more pernicious then to the Projectors, as is
manifested in the History of the Constable before mentioned, most exactly
written by Philip Commines, Nicholas Picunnes General of the Army of Philip
Duke of Millane, after that he had brought the Earl of Francisfort, and the
Army of his confederates into such a straight, that he was assured of the
victory, he broke forth into such a height of insolency, that forgetting
himself and the charge that was committed unto him, he calls to mind how long
he had served the Duke in the Wars, and that during all that time he had not
gotten so much land in his service as would cover his body when he was dead;
and therefore he began to expostulate what reward should be given for all his
services; and because it lay in his powet to deliver into the Dukes hands the
whole Conntrey of Lumbardy, and all those Enemies that did oppress him, he
required of the Duke as a reward for his service the City of Placentia: the
which unless he would grant, he plainly told him he would return home and
leave the field; this man's insolency so much offended the Duke, that rather
then he should have his will, he was content to leave an assured victory; so
suffered himself to be carried away with the insolency of this man, whom no
danger or fear of Enemies could ever move a jot: wherefore he concluded Peace
with the Earl, and commanded Pricinius with his Army to quit the Country,
accusing fortune as a step-dame, whereas there was no fault in her, but in
Pricinius insolency.

Tacitus reports of Lentulus Getulicus, being made General over the Army of
the upper part of Germany, and being suspected and accused by reason of the
inward familiarity between him and Sejanus, was so bold as to send Letters unto
Caesar, showing that the familiarity between him and Sejanus, was not
occasioned of his own head, but by the advice of Tiberius; and therefore it was
nor strange, but that he as well as Tiberius might be deceived; neither could
that be imputed unto him as an error of wilfulness, for that he ever carried
an honest heart to him, and resolved ever so to do, though he had been often
tempted to quit his allegiance, and could endure no more to hear that Sejanus
should succeed in the Empire, then he could endure to hear of his damnation.
But in conclusion, Tiberius and Getulicus made a League as it were that
Tiberius should enjoy his Dominions, and Getulicus his Province. Tacitus
affirms that the bold menacing Epistles which Getulicus writ unto Tiberius did
him no hurt at all; for Tiberius, wisely considering in what case he stood,
how he was grown old, and not beloved of his Subjects, and that he had not
power of himself, suffered him alone of all Sejanus his adherents to live in
peace and enjoy his favor. But without doubt this did much trouble Tiberius,
that was of a choleric disposition and a high spirit, and if he had lived
long, he would have called him to an account; but he considered that Getulicus
lived far from him, and what he writ proceeded from the bottom of a good
conscience, and out of an honest heart. There is another thing that does
commonly happen to such as are grown proud with prosperity, that the same
cruelty which they have without control executed upon their equals and
inferiors, in the end they execute upon their Sovereign. Experience hereof we
have in England in Richard Nevill Earl of Warwick, who being highly advanced
by the King after that he had compassed the death of the Queens Father, her
children and many others that were near and dear unto the King, at last was
not afraid to rise in Rebellion against the King; wherefore 54 Ne quempiam
suorum nimia potestate afficeret.
54 Moecaenas wisely counseled Augustus that he should not suffer any of his
Subjects to grow too great, least thereby they should grow so powerful as to
dare to attempt any thing against him. There are others that carry themselves
more moderately, and warily, that relinquish the service of their Prince that
reigns, and follow and adore the rising Sun, apply themselves to him that is
to succeed in the Empire, as Macro did; but these kind of people never
continue long in favor; for by their behavior to the former Prince, they are
deservedly had in suspicion by the later, and undergo the punishment in his
time which they deserved in his praedecessours; peradventure they which saucily
upbraid their Prince as Clytus did Alexander with what they have deserved, are
not so much to be condemned, as the former that abandon their service; yet it
is most distastefull to a Prince to be told of any such thing; for that they
are more pleased in hearing what rewards they have conferred, then in hearing
what any man has deserved.

The deserts of a Subject are so long acceptable to the Prince, as it is in the
Princes power when he will to come out of his debt; but when he thinks he
has deserved so much that he cannot well requite him, then does he requite
him with perpetual hatred; for this very cause did Adrianus Caesar remove
Tatianus and his fellow from their jurisdiction and government, to whom he was
indebted as much as his Empire came to, as Spartianus says; but it was imputed
to their popularity; and if there were no other cause to make a man hateful in
the eyes of his Prince, this alone were sufficient; for there is no Prince of
so poor a spirit, or slender capacity, that will endure such malepert
fellows; for it is naturally ingrafted into Princes, not to suffer an equal
or a competitor. And there is good cause why such men should be ever had in
suspicion, and be neglected by them; for that they are easily corrupted, and
drawn into Rebellion; and it is wonderful to see how that they who have
attained to the greatest favor with their Princes, are ever buzzing into their
ears, that they should not suffer their Subjects to grow too great, and how in
the mean time they so dote upon them, that they do not perceive that they
alone are the men, of whom they admonish the Prince to have an eye; but in the
end the Prince by one means or other being made sensible of the burden he
bears, and being weary of them, casts them down; and if there were no other
motive to induce them thereunto, the too much liberty those men do assume to
themselves, of doing what they will, and the fear they stand in by reason of
them, were sufficient to occasion their removal; and this was the cause why
Nero removed Seneca, of whom for a long time he stood in awe; he was used to
say, he knew not where to hide himself from Seneca, no not within his skin,
unless he did dispatch him out of the way. Councillors were not wanting that
did suggest unto him, that he being past a Child, grown to man's estate, he
should cast off his Master, having Senators at hand that could better advise
him; so Tiberius the Emperor for a long time, for the love that the Soldiers
and People bare unto Germanicus, reverenced him, insomuch that during all the
time that he was advised by him, he carried himself very moderately in the
Empire: yet in the end for the same cause he hated him, and secretly caused
him to be put to death. For the same cause likewise Nero caused Octavia his
beloved Wife who ever carried her self modestly and obediently toward him, to
be removed. So 55 Galfridus Iustitiarius Angliae sub Iohanne.
55 Jeffrey a Justiciary of En^land, that flourished in the days of King John,
being one that was well experienced in the Law, and by reason of his riches,
his allies and his honors* was become the most powerful man in the Kingdom,
was in the end more feared then beloved of the King, insomuch that when the
King heard of his death he brake out, and swore by the feet of God, that then
and not before was he King and Lord of England. Wherefore Alvarus Castro
persuaded Sebastian King of Lusitania, who died in Africa, that he was in some
sort oppressed by his Subjects, Martianus Gousalesius and his adherents, and
that they were the very King, and he bore but the shape and show of a King;
insomuch, that when his Secretary brought unto him a Charter of small
consequence to be signed by him: by the persuasion of Alvarus and his
associates he affirmed that he could do it safely without any scruple; for that
he made no doubt of his Sovereignty until he came to Lizborne. For the same
cause likewise, that is, because he challenged a kind of Sovereignty over his
fellows, was Duke Albinus hated of Charles the Emperor, but more of Philip,
although he observed them both, and did them faithful service from his
childe-hood to his old age, for the space of sixty years: wherefore it befalls
these en as Titus Livius reports of the Roman Empire, that arising out of the
dust it grew to such a greatness, that in the end it became a burden to it
self; for as our bodies when they grow and swell too much, as we have seen a
man in Luxenburgh, are burdens to themselves, unhealthfull, and subject to
diseases: So it happens with them that outstrip their fellows in
magnificence, their greatness is oftentimes the cause of their ruin and
destruction; as they which climb on high, whilst they cast their eyes always
upward, never downwards, are brought at length to such a straight, that they
cannot look down without being giddy, nor stand where they are in safety, nor
come down without danger; So it fares with them that s^rmount the ordinary
pitch of their fellows, being in as great danger as he that holds a Woolfe by
the ears, and as John Hannois, a Captain of the Gauntois was, who being
circumvented in a certain Temple by the Soldiers of the Earl of Flanders,
when they set fire on the Temple, he betook himself to the Steeple for
refuge; and when the fire came near him he was put to his choice, whether he
would dye upon the spear, or be burnt in the fire; and he chose (whereby we
may perceive how dangerously they which are on high do stand) to dye by the
spear; wherefore it is reported, that Maecenas should say unto Octavius Caesar
of Agrippa, whom he had preferred to the highest degree of honor, that thou
must make him thy son in Law, or put him to death: greatness is attained with
no less danger then Usurpers do attain a Kingdom, which to do is unjust,
to relinquish dangerous; wherefore Julius Caesar was used to say, that they
which have once attained to greatness, can never after endure to lead a
private life; which saying of his we shall find to be most true, if we
look into the lives of the best men, in whom their ^reatnesse has occasioned
their ruin and destruction; we may read of many that have been for a time
without exception for life and conversation, and by their good services have
purchased their Princes favor; yet in the end have been questioned for their
lives upon a small occasion, and feined suspicion. Example hereof we have in
Seneca; neither is it strange it should be so; for they that stand on high are
not only troubled with the vertigo in their heads, but with infirmities in
their legs; as they cannot stand without fear, so they cannot come down
without danger; so that Tacitus affirms, 55 Fatum potentiae est quod raro sit
sempiterna.
56 That is destinated unto greatness not to be of long continuance, and he
produces Maecenas for an example, where likewise he speaks of Salustius
Crispus, so long as Maecenas says he was but the second in the Empire, so long
he lived securely and happily; but when he came to be the chief man, even he
into whose bosom the Emperor did empty all his secrets, then he began to
decline and to loose the favor which he had formerly gained; so that what
Tacitus affirms of greatness, is most true, if it be not founded upon a sure
foundation.

Fortune is always fickle, and every thing that mortal men enjoy upon earth
uncertain, as it is in the Comaedian, and so much the more uncertain by how the
greater a man is; the greatest honors are attended with the greatest cares and
fears; neither is there any state more uncertain then the estate of great men;
wherefore they have need when they have attained their wished desires, to pray
to God to preserve them in the state which they have long desired and prayed
for.

A chief cause hereof is for that the favor of Princes is subject to
alteration, which Tacitus glanceth upon in the examples of Maecenas, and
Salustius before alleged, where he shows a twofold cause thereof: the one of
destiny of which we have spoken before, the other their own greatness and
fullness, when the Prince has given them so much, that he can give no more;
and they receive so much that they can crave no more; then does he ease them of
the burden (as Amiratus has at large dscovered) but the true cause thereof is
for that Princes are men, and subject to the infirmities of men: and the mind
of man is of a fiery nature and changeable upon every light occasion; for as
the imagination of man will in a short time well conceive a thousand several
things, pass over a thousand several places; so the mind of man will in a
moment be of a thousand several opinions; therefore it is truly said that the
mind of man delights in novelties. Wherefore the French Knig Lewis the
eleventh, after he changed his bedchamber, men and others, that waited upon
him, was used to answer all such as taxed him for it, that nature delighted in
novelties; many other causes may be added as the natural inclination and
disposition of man, and accidents which do often fall out, which do alter and
change the mind of the Prince: as Spartianus affirms, that Adrianus the
Emperor had an open ear to hear any thing that could be told him of them
unto whom he professed the greatest love; wherefore all those that he most
affected and advanced to the highest degree of Honor, in the end he esteemed
no better then enemies; so Henry the third King of England, esteemed of 57 Hugo
de Burgo pro to justi^iarius Angliae sub H. 3.
57 Hugo de Burgo chief Justice of England, being one that deserved well both
of King and Commonwealth, who for the love that he bore unto him, and to the
safty of the Realm, did incurr the displeasure of all the Nobility of the
Kingdom; for by instigation of Peter Bishop of Winchester he did not only
withdraw his affections from him, but deprived him of his office, and
persecuted him with all extremity.

But most memorable are the examples of the Earl Vlrick Cilensis and Vlrick
Eizingerus in the Country of Austria, when Ladislaus son of Alburt King of
Hungary and Bohemia, and Archduke of Austria, took upon him the Government of
the Kingdom; during his minority, both the King and Kingdom were in the power
of the Earl; who being an eyesore to many, especially to Vlricus Eizingerus a
man most powerful with the King, he privily acquainted him how odiour the
Earl was among many of the inhabitants of Austria, and unless he did take
some course with him, he did verily persuade himself they would rise in
rebellion: for that he injuriously took from them their money, pillaged the
Commonwealth, filled his own, emptied the Kings Treasury; and I may Boldly say
his power was so great, that he ruled as King, and did what he would; only he
left the bare title of King unto the King. There is nothing that makes us more
degenerate from our selves, and transgress the laws of God and men then
ambition; it was not enough for him to enjoy the second place of the Kingdom,
but he must covet after the first; neither is it a marvel that he that of late
would not endure an equal, should not now admit of a Superior; wherefote
Vlricus persuaded the King speedily to banish him the Court, who departed
thence with four Knights only, and left his place to Eizingerus, 58 Cum quatuor
tantum militibus insultante plebe and vix manibus temperante ex urbe
proficiscitur.
58 the people rejoicing thereat, and hardly forbearing to lay violent hands
upon him; But this Eizingerus not long after being complained of to the King by
Pancratius Plankenstanius, the King before the year came about, sent for the
Earl and honorably received him, and restored him to his former dignity.
Eizingerus left the Court with much grace and favor, wisely yielded unto the
times, and betook himself to live upon his own Possessions; and it is said
that the Earl did much applaud him for so doing: for that he had learned by
his own example, that the minds of Monarks are carried hither and thither in a
moment, which Gerardus de Roo taking into consideration, commended the saying
of him who compared the Minions of Princes unto counters with which we cast
account, which being removed from place to place, stand sometimes for much,
sometimes for little, and sometimes for nothing. A cause likewise wherefore
Princes do withdraw their affections from their Minions, is, to give their
Subjects satisfaction whom they have grieved and oppressed; examples whereof we
have before alleged, unto which we may add the example of Duke Borgio
Valentino, whom Nicholas Machivell has remembered, who after that he had
reduced Flaminia to his obedience, he made Remerus Orcus a cruel man and a
great undertaker governor thereof, who so carried the matter, that in a short
time he had every man at his beck: yet not without a great deal of cruelty,
which drew the hatred of all men upon him, insomuch that the Duke to winn their
hearts again, was feign to acquaint them that if any exorbitances were
committed in Flaminia by Orcus, it was done of his own accord without his
consent or approbation; and so he took that occasion early in the morning to
have his body divided into two parts, and girding a sword by his side, with a
wooden scabberd, exposed him to the view of the multitude in the market place;
which when the people saw, they went home every one well satisfied. Envy is
ever an attendant of such a man; and not undeservedly; for whosoever is
advanced by mere favor, without any desert of his own, or approbation of the
people, to have rule and authority over others of more worth, the people will
hate and despise; for the favor of a Prince is like unto a fair Virgin, whom
many affect, and will not endure that she should look more favorably, walk
or talk more frequently with any then with themselves; so that between men of
this condition there is seldom or never any true friendship or familiarity;
for upon every light occasion they study how to bring one another in disgrace.
Tully well says, there is no faith or friendship observed, when a Kingdom is
at stake; for whatsoever is of that nature, that many may contend for, yet but
one can enjoy. The contention is great, but faith and honesty little; he that
dotes upon one, seems to neglect all others. And he is a very bold Prince (as
Christopher Besoldus observes) that for the love of one will draw the hatred of
the multitude upon him. Examples hereof we have before alleged in Nicolas Gara
Count Palatine of Hungary, and in others: and during the reign of the French
King Henry the second in Amiralius Comestabilius, and the Chancellor, who
having attained to the chiefest degrees of honor, envied each others
prosperity. How incertaine the condition of mortal men is upon Earth, Sleidan
has sufficiently showed by his own example. And who is ignorant of the civil
Wars which have been in France, both in the days of our progenitors, and in
our own memories, for this cause only, that the government of the Kingdom
has been committed unto such, unto whom it did not belong? This Hanniball the
great Captain of the Carthaginians found to be true by woeful experience; for
he being forced to leave his Country, betook himself to Antiochus, King of
Asia; who so well behaved himself during the time that he was with him, that
within a very short time he became very gracious in his eyes; therefore when
the King made war against the Romans, he would have made him commander of
his fleet, had not Thoas A^tolus dissuaded him to the contrary, saying, it was
too much honor unto him to make him General of the Royal Fleet: that there
ought to be but one King, one chief Commander, and one Emperor; for admit it
should so fallout that Hannibal should lose the honor of the day, the damage
would redound unto the King; but if things should succeed prosperously the
honor thereof would redound unto Hannibal, and not unto Antiochus; and that if
fortune should so favor Hannibal to overcome the Romans, what hope could
Antiochus have to expect that this man would be true to him, that was false to
his Country? That it was safe for Antiochus to use him as a Counselor, but
not as a Commander in the War? By these persuasions, for that they were
grounded upon good reason, did Aetolus alienate the mind of Antiochus from
Hannibal, and occasioned him to lessen, if not to take away all power and
authority out of his hands. This befalls oftentimes where the Gentry and
Nobility be had in estimation, especially to such that from the dunghill are
raised to an extraordinary greatness, and want kindred and allies to support
them; for it is incident to humane nature to look upon men raised out of the
dust with sqiunt eyes, and to expect that they of all men, who not long before
were their equals and companions, should not insult and domineer over them:
therefore did Caius Sinlius of an ancient and noble Family, bitterly enveigh
against Seneca, and resolved rather to undergo any punishment then to submit
himself to his late purchased Gentry. These kind of men stand upon slippery
ground, and every man is ready to throw them down, and if they once fall, they
seldom or never rise again. Of the like condition are they that being borne
in another Kings dominion, aliens and strangers, attain to honor and
authority in a Country where they are mere strangers; for no men are more hated
then these men, 59 Inqui^^ni sui putant juris esse, ut sui generis hominibus
gubernacula reru^ committantur.
59 Every man thinking it to be a part of his Birthright to be governed by
men of his own Nation, and not by strangers: for this very cause have the
subjects of all Nations at one time or other rebelled against their
Sovereigns. When Albert, the first of that name, Duke of Austria, placed
nearest about him Eberhardus Henricus, and Vdalricus, the brethren of Waser
Hermanus, Handenburgins with others, and advanced them to the highest degrees
of honor, the native Inhabitants took it ill, that they who had quit their
own Countries, because they had not where withal to give them livelihood,
should come into the flourishing Country of Austria, and there enrich
themselves by marriages, whilst they being natives were neglected, and were not
permitted to open their mouths for the common good; so that they petitioned the
Prince, that he would be pleased to remove the Swedes from having any hand in
the managing of the affairs of the Commonwealth; for that they had those
amongst themselves, that better understood the state of the Commonwealth, and
could better manage the affairs thereof. Unto which, when the Prince would
not listen, nor remove from him the aforenamed person, the rich and powerful
men of Austria, especially the men of Vienna, joining their forces with their
neighbors, raised arms, thinking to remove them by force, which although it
took not that effect as they supposed it would have done, yet hence we learn
how hateful a thing it is to the natives of a Country to have strangers rule
over them; and as all strangers are odious, and stand upon slippery ground; so
especially they that quit their own and fly for refuge into an other Country,
and there as often it happens, do attain to any command and authority. This
Thoas Aetolus aforenamed objected against Hannibal, who being an exiled
Carthaginian, became so powerful with Antiochus King of Asia, that what with
his wit, and what with his power, within a short time he was able to alter the
Government; and therefore Polybius commended Xantippus a Lacedaemonian for this
that he having brought the Commonwealth of Carthage into a good order, he
left it and returned home into his own Country. Famous and worthy achievements
are ever attended with envy and malice, and it is the condition of the natives
of a Country by their friends and allies to vilify the acts of strangers, and
to study how to bring them into disgrace and danger.

To conclude, this one thing, that is to say, to take too great a burden upon
themselves, and presume with their own wit and judgment to manage and rule
whole principalities, does very much hurt these kind of people; for if that
one man though qualified with rare and admirable gifts of art and nature,
cannot so uprightly carry himself in the mannageing of a business of small
consequence, but that he shall deserve reprehension of the multitude, and
incur the displeasure of his Prince that laid that burden upon him: how is
it possible that one man should manage as he ought, the state of a Kingdom,
which will trouble the heads of many men laid together? This Tiberius Caesar
found to be true, who after that the Senate had settled him in the Empire,
considering the greatness thereof, and his own weakness, ingenuously
acknowledged, that the mind of Augustus only was capable of such a burden;
as for himself being called to bear but a part of it, he found by experience
how difficult and dangerous the burden of a Kingdom was, and how much subject
it was to change and alter. Therefore in a City where many able and deserving
men are, special care is to be had, that one man bear not the sway alone; for
that many heads together will with more ease and safety manage the state and
affairs thereof, which as it is most true, so I desire that they especially
take notice thereof, who dare of themselves undertake to bear so great a
burden; for it cannot be, but that these men which take so much upon them,
must neglect to do many things which they ought to do, and so deserve a just
reprehension; it is a common saying, that no man can serve two masters: Whence
Plato in his eighth Book of Laws, affirms, that it is a most difficult thing
for a man, be he of ever so good a wit and capacity, to excel in two several
arts; so that Diodorus Siculus says, with the Indians, it is not permitted for
any man to apply himself to two several studies. Assuredly these men, though
never so wise, vigilant, and industrious, being ever in the Sea, troubles and
turmoiles of the world, in the end must of necessity fall upon a Rock, and
though they forecast all things warily, and turn over every stone, provide
salves for every sore, and have ever instruments at hand to execute their
commands; yet in the end they must come down, and fall full low, as mariners,
be they ever so skillfull, if they continue on the Seas, when their tacklings
fail, must of necessity yield unto the waters; so it is with them; for it is
most true, Who so does headlong daily into dangers run,
Will hardly in the end those dangers shun.


He that has dealings in the world, finds that the wheel of fortune is ever
turning, and that she never dotes so upon any man as to satisfy his
expectation, and to give contentment to him in every thing; and I deny not, but
that these men may, during the reign of one King, continue in their greatness;
yet regularly 60 Plerumque isti atque omnes fere a successore evertuntur.
60 both they and all their adherents are ruinated by his successor, as the
Examples before alleged do sufficiently manifest unto unto us; These
therefore and the like causes sometimes reigning all together in one person,
sometimes but some of them, nay, sometimes but one of them, are the means to
strip them out of their magnificence, and to bring them upon their knees.

CHAP. III. Of Remedies.
SEeing then that all these things are grievous both to Prince and People, and
oftentimes the cause of the ruin of the one or the other, or both; in the next
place we must think of some antidote how we may prevent the disease before it
comes, rather then of a cure when it has once seized upon us; for this
purpose I will set down some few rules, not that I will prescribe unto Princes
a platform of government: far be it from me to think of any such thing,
being a thing beyond my capacity, and not within the compass of my profession,
but rather to refresh their memories, and the memories of their subjects with
such things as have come to my understanding, and the understanding of others
of my coat and profession, and to set before their eyes some lively patterns
and examples, that so they pursue those things that are profitable both to
themselves and the Commonwealth, and avoid those things which are hurtful both
in the beginning and the ending. Princes therefore in my opinion cannot think of
a better means to avoid the aforesaid inconveniences, then not to suffer any
one of their Subjects to grow too great, and to burden him with too much power
and authority; of this Moecaenas amongst many other things admonished Augustus
Casar, least such a man by reason of his power might attempt any thing against
him; of this opinion was John Bodyn, who out of his own experience found it to
be true that there is nothing more dangerous to a Prince, then to suffer any
one to come so near him as to be able at one step to step into the Royal
seat, and so far to excel others in authority that they must depend upon him;
and this he found to be so much the more dangerous when any one is permitted
to rule without an associate, and to enrich himself with the Treasure of the
Commonwealth; wherefore Adrianus Caesar would never acknowledge any of his
freed men in public, nor suffer himself to be led by them; he was used to
say that all his predecessors were too blame for listening so much unto them:
and if any one had vaunted of the power he had in former times, it was a
sufficient matter to condemn him; wherefore Princes ought to have in
perpe^uall remembrance the procedings of some of the Majors of the Court of
France, who rising by little and little, at length grew so great, that they
attempted to depose their Kings, and to sit in their Thrones; at first they had
no power but a ministerial office in the Kings house; but under Locharius the
second they began to usurp the title of the Goveroment of the Kingdom; under
which title whilst they did assume to themselves the defense of the rights of
the Kingdom, and drew all power and authority into their hands, the authority
of the King began to decline and fall away, for the Kings (whether by the
subtilty of the Majors, or their own fatal idleness it is hard to say) left
the care of the Kingdom and government thereof unto them, and gave themselves
wholly to their pleasures and delights; only once a year in the Calends of May
they showed themselves unto the people; in the meanetime the Majors took upon
them the Government of the Kingdom, summoned Parliaments, gave audience and
answers to Ambassadors, made Leagues with foreign Princes, promulged edicts
and decrees, and did all things as fully that did belong to the Kingly power as
if they had been Kings indeed; whence it came to pass, as the mind of man is
insatiable, that they began by degrees to make their way into the Kings Throne,
to set them at defiance, and to drive them like Captives and Children into
corners; and if the King had attempted to suppress them, they with all their
might and power had not been able to have done it; for they got the the whole
power of the Kingdom into their hands; and by the long connivency of the King,
they did seem to challenge the Government of right, and to allow unto the
Kings but the bare name and title of Kings.

Pippin the father of Charles the great, after that he had attained to the
Honor to be Major in King Childericks Court: first began to traduce the King,
to buzze into the ears of the people his sloth and simplicity, to extol
himself unto the clouds, and by all ways and means to winn the hearts of
the people; having laid this foundation, he knew there was no better way to
effect his design, 61 Nihil ad persuadendum hominum mentes efficacius
religione sciebat.
61 then to use Religion as a cloak; wherefore he sent unto Rome unto Pope
Zachery in the name of the people to know whether of the two were more fit to
reign, either he that took upon him the whole burden of the Kingdom, or he
that cared for nothing, gave himself wholly to idleness, and had no more
understanding then a Beast; who presently delivered his opinion for Pippin, and
absolved the people from their allegiance to Childerick, hopeing that Pippin
would assist him against the Lumbards; Childerick thereupon from a King became
a Mounk, and Pippin was crowned King of France.

Let all Princes take into their consideration, as well for their own safety as
the safety of their Posterity, this example of King Childerick, that the same
mischief may not fall upon them and theirs, as did upon Childerick and his
posterity; wherefore if a Prince shall at any time see any of his Subjects grow
too mighty and popular, let him always have an eye upon him, and clip his
wings in time; and if that will not do, yet if any just occasion be offered,
let him rid hi^ out of the way; for a Prince must know that it is with these
men, as it is with all other things, they come not to full maturity on a
sudden, but by degrees, by little and little, and no notice for the most part
is taken of them until they come to their full growth; wherefore he must be
watchful and use the remedy which I have before prescribed, and such others as
I shall now acquaint him withal. For this purpose the Counsel which Moecenas
gave unto Augustus Caesar, is not to be neglected touching his Officers, that
he might without danger to himself, or prejudice to the Commonwealth, suffer
such as had no power to hurt him, to hold their places in perpetuity: but not
such as had Command of Armies or Provinces; for when they shall consider that
within a short time they may be private men, they will be more careful how
they offer any wrong to any man; of whose opinion was Seneca, who affirms that
there is nothing so profitable to the Commonwealth as 62 Nihil tam utile
Reipub. qua^ brevem esse potestatem quae magna est.
62 that great offices should ever be at the disposal of the Prince; wherefore
Mumercus Aemylius being a dictator in the Roman Commonwealth, for that he
saw the Censors to continue in their places for the space of five years, and
not without prejudice to the whole Commonwealth, called a Council together to
advise, touching the liberty of the people, where he affirms that nothing was
so prejudicial to the Commonwealth as to permit Governors that had great
power committed unto them, to hold their places without any limitation of time;
that other officers hold their places but for a year, the Censors for five
years, during the greatest part of which time they gave themseluer wholly to
licentiousness: wherefore he thought it fit that the office of Dictator should
not continue for a longer time then a year and six Months; and so by a
general consent there was a Law made to that purpose; and that he himself
might be an example unto them, he spoke after this manner; that ye may know,
ye Noble Romans, how distasteful a thing it is unto me, to see Magistrates
continue long in their offices, I quit my self of my Dictatorship.

With Aemylius and the others before named, accords Nicholas Machiavell in
opinion, who positively affirms, that it is a most dangerous thing to suffer
any one to have a perpetuity in any great place, for that he has thereby
opportunity to effect his designs, and this was the cause why the 63 Decemviri
63 decemviri in Rome did abuse their authority, when being 64 Dictatores
64 Dictators they did not; because they had time enough to work their
designs; therefore he says, if we look diligently into the form of
government of the Roman Commonwealth, we shall see, that the chief cause of
the ruin of that famous Common Wealth, was by reason of the contention that
arose among the common people, concerning division of grounds, and prorogation
of magistracy; for although that few or none took notice that the prorogation
of magistracy was the cause of sedition in that Commonwealth; yet it is most
manifest, that they that continued any long time in magistracy, attained to so
much power, that it became fatal to the Commonwealth; it was this alone that
administered to Marius, to Sylla, to Caesar, to turn topsie turvy the state of
the Commonwealth. Wherefore we learn this of Caesar, who after that he had
ended the Wars in Africa, made a law, that no praetor should hold his office
above a year, or Consul above two years, having learned ad unguem, a lesson
which Dion has in his three and fourtieth book; and this he did by his own
example; for that he having had a Command in France for the space of many
years together, he found in himself an ambition to continue that commanding
power still; for the attaining of which swelling honor 65 Atheniensibus
inventus est Ostracismus.
65 among the Athenians the punishment of Ostracisme, and among the Syracusans,
the punishment of Petalisme was devised; which Aristotle and Diodorus Siculus
condemn as a remedy too violent and pernicious; 66 Syracusanis Petalismns.
for it is one thing to make a Law to keep a Subject within a mean, that he
get no further then the Prince will have him, and another thing to banish him
his Country for no reason but only for that he excells in virtue and riches;
therefore both in Prince and People the golden mean is ever requisite. Hence a
Prince may learn by the e^amples of the Majors in France, that if at any time
he shall be so far enamoured with any one man, as that he shall commit all
power into his hands, yet by 67 Periculosum est ut authoritas in filios
descendat.
67 no means to let that power descend and be hereditary to his Posterity; for
there is no such inducement to make a man forget himself, and to raise his
thoughts beyond the ordinary pitch, as the hope of propagating of honors by
his own wit and industry unto Posterity; therefore let a Prince ever use the
assistance of many in managing of his affairs, and not commit all things to
one, nor listen to that only which one man can tell him: for if any one of a
Kings Subjects shall be so great that all the rest shall stand in awe of him,
he indeed as Philip Commines observes, is very King and Lord; therefore 68
Necessarium est ut Princeps plures oculos, and plures manus sibi faciat.
68 Aristotle admonishes Princes to use many eyes and many hands in the
governing of their affairs, which they then do when they use many
Councillors; for therefore are Princes said to have long hands; not that their
hands are longer then other men's, but because they have many servants, by whose
help and assistance they can see and hear and manage the affairs in the most
remote places of their Dominions; for many eyes see more then one; and most
often that which one man understands not, another will, and many hands will
with more celerity and dexterity dispatch a business; wherefore Mecenas again
told Augustus, that it was the best course to use the help of many in the
mannageing of the affairs of the Commonwealth, that so the profit might
redound unto many, and many gain experience thereby, and be enabled to do him
service; by which means he should not only gain the good will of his
Subjects, but he should ever have able men at hand to do him service in every
kind. The self same counsel does James King of great Britain give unto his
son, that he should not rely wholly upon the counsel of any one man in every
thing; for such a man in the end will not only be a burden to his Lord and
Master, but be subject to the envy and displeasure of all men else, as is
before showed: again it is impossible for one man to be able to undergo all
businesses, as Scipio Amiratus has at large discovered, and before him
Aristotle, who affirms, 69 Possimum est unum plures magistratus obire.
69 that it is most inconvenient to suffer any one man to undergo diverse
offices, for that many men will sooner, and better, execute the same;
especially where the Country abounds with able and sufficient men; wherefore
bitterly does Waremund of Erenburgh deride certain Princes of Germany; as many
of the Nobility says he, do use one and the same horse, sometimes for the
Cart, sometimes for the Saddle, sometimes for the War, even as they did in
ancient time, the Delphian sword for diverse purposes, sometimes to sacrifice to
the Gods, and sometimes to punish malefactors; so do the Princes make choice
of the selfsame counsels, to assist them in all kind of businesses;
sometimes to plead causes, sometimes to sit as judges, sometimes to treat of
arms, sometimes to make laws, sometimes to play the part of Orators, nay,
sometimes of the Physician, Mathematician, and Artificer; whence it comes to
pass that they have neither good Soldiers nor good Counselors. It comes into
my mind, that not long ago I was told a strange story, that a certain Prince
writ that a Doctor of the law might be sent unto him, whom he would use as his
Counselor, and withal declared himself how he would have him qualified,
that he should have a head able to carry his cups well; but for mine own part
I had rather have a sober man to be my Counselor; and if my judgment fail
me not, I think there is no such plague unto Princes, as to have about them
these nimble undertakers, that dare adventure upon any employment, especially
if they be, as usually they are, boasters of themselves. For these
Polypragmons, for the most part, are never settled in any course, but are
always desirous to try conclusions, and as the wind and tide do serve, so
do they desist their former courses, and leave their masters. Yet Livy writes,
that Marcus Cato senior was so rarely qualified, that in what place soever he
had been in he would have raised a fortune out of it; in that he knew what
appertained to the duty of a private man, and the office of a public
magistrate; and that he was experienced as well in the affairs of the City, as
the Country: and whereas some raised themselves to honor by the law, some by
warre-like discipline, he was excellent in all, and whatsoever he undertook
he performed with that dexterity that a man would have thought that he had
been borne to do that only which he undertook; but such kind of wits are
very rare, and there is a great deal of difference between him and such as
seem to be like unto him; therefore does the same Livy write of Scipio
Africanus, that he was a man of great account among the Romans, and memorable
for many things; but yet that he was better experienced in military discipline
then in civil government; and this may serve as a motive to a Prince, never to
trust any man alone, but to join others in commission with him, that may
oversee him and observe his actions; so will he be more cautelous and wary to
do any thing that shall be prejudicial to the Commonwealth, when he shall
see others to be judges of his actions, and to be ready at hand to reprehend
him if he do amiss; wherefore Mecaenas again advised Augustus, that he would
appoint two ever to guard his person, that if the one should go about to
ensnare him, he might pray in aid of the other; so Tiberius Caesar sent
Germanicus into the Eastern Countries with a large commission, to compose the
differences there; but yet he joined Piso with him, that had a great wit and
spirit to curb him, and keep him a little under. As that mariner cannot be said
to be wise, that trusts only to one anchor; so that Prince that relies only
upon one man; for what can be the issue of it? admit this man should dye, or
should fall off from him, a thousand accidents may happen to occasion him to
detest the course he is in, and then the Prince should be left alone unarmed,
as it were, unless he had employed others in businesses of the like nature,
and thereby enabled them to do him service; therefore it is most fit that
Princes should use the same order in trayning up of Counselors, that huntsmen
do in their hounds; for as they enter their young whelps with their old dogs,
so 70 Hoc idem oportet principem observare circa consiliarios quod observant
venatores in v^narionibus.
70 Princes should ever with gray head Senators join discreet young gentlemen
to observe the manners and customs of those aged Fathers; but the most sure
and sovereign remedy of all other is, for a Prince ever to keep the reins of
the government of the Kingdom in his own power. Yet I do not speak to this
end, that I would have a Prince do every thing by himself; for that does
Tacitus reprove in Claudius Caesar, saying, that the Prince that takes upon him
the offices of judicature and magistracy has daily occasion administered him to
prey upon his people; wherefore Tiberius blamed the Senate for casting all the
care of the Empire upon him alone; which place of Tacitus, Scipio Amiratus
persues very far, saying, that to lay all the burden upon the head alone is
to make a confusion, and to deprive the rest of the members of the body of
their proper office; in this kind Bonfinus reports, that Matthias the first of
that name, and one of the wisest Kings of Hungary, was faulty, who was used to
say, that he was able to manage the affairs of his Kingdom of himself, and
to confute his Counselors when they would persuade him to any thing; and
further, that he often heard him say at Vienna before his death, that in the
government of his Kingdom he never used another man's advice; and that from the
beginning of his reign, he could not endure to hear the advice and direction
of a counselor for a year about; but what became of it? flatterers swarmed
in his court, and he run into many dangrrous and des^erate errors. Quintus
Curtius in his fourth book writes, that Alexander the great would seldom
listen to the Counsel of his friends, when he was in greatest danger; and
that Xerxes was more wilful then he, who intending to make War in Greece,
having called the Princes together, spoke in this manner unto them; I have
called you that I may not seem to do any thing of my own head; but yet
remember that it is your duty rather to obey then to persuade. I say, I do not
allow of this, for a Prince wholly to rely upon the strength of his own wit,
and to manage every thing of himself; but with Justus Lipsius I would have
him to impart the cares of his Kingdom unto others, to observe the golden
mean, not to sit idle, and lay the burden wholly upon others; but as the
Governor of a Ship allots to every Mariner a proper office, whilst he sets at
the stern and over-sees them; and as a General in the War does not always
fight, or take upon him the whole burden of the War, but commands and enjoynes
every one what he shall do: So I would have a Prince sit at the stern, cast
his eyes every way, that he may see and know what every Servant and Counselor
of his does, or at least, that they may believe that he sees them, and knows
what they do; the which, that Prince whosoever he be that shall perform,
though it cannot be that a Prince should see every thing, hear every thing,
and be present everywhere; yet the very conceit that he does see and hear
them, and is present with them, will make them to be more vigilant and
careful; and as the Son dispels the clouds, so will this conceit dispell many
ill thoughts out of their minds, and hinder them to put in execution many ill
counsels; therefore as the best and wariest Husbands are not always present
with their Servants and workmen, but are about other affairs in the world, yet
sometimes step in upon them on a sudden, as the master of the Family in the
Gospel did; so a Prince ought to do, when his servants think him safe enough,
far remote, recreating himself in his pleasures and delights, then to step
in upon them, and see how they behave themselves. But when I speak of
servants; I do not speak of servants that serve him in a low place, for they
have others which will over-see them, and if they do not as they should, will
punish them; but such as are near unto him, and serve him in high places, who
as they have the higher power, so they have the greater liberty to wrong and
oppress the people, whom none dare controull but he himself; especially if
they be more gracious then oaths in his eyes; wherefore upon them the Prince
ought to have a special eye; otherwise all those inconveniences which I have
before remembered may easily ensue. Of these men, as Popiscus reports,
Dioclesian the Emperor was used to say, that they meet four or five of them
together, and consult how to deceive the Emperor, and determine what shall
pass, or not pass; the Emperor they say keeps home close, understands not
the truth in any business, or what occurrences happen, unless that they do
impart them unto him; he makes such Judges as are not fit to be made, and
removes such as ought to be retained; what should I say, but as the same
Dioclesian said, the best, the most noble, and most cautelous Emperor is
bought and sold by them; wherefore the Counsel of Philip Commines is not to be
neglected, that 71 Princeps praeter co^siliarios alios debet audire.
71 a Prince ought oftentimes to converse with others besides his Counselors.
Neither are those Princes to be condemned that sometimes in a disguised habit
come among the multitude; for there they shall understand many things as well
touching themselves as their Officers, which otherwise they should never have
heard.

Alexander Severus the Emperor when he made any Governor of Provinces or
chief Officers, did usually send the names of them unto the multitude, to this
end that if they could justly accuse them of any crime, they should not
forbear to do it; but if they did wrongfully accuse them, that then they
should expect no other punishment then that which was capital; for he
conceived that it was as fit for Emperors by this means to examine the
integrity of the Governors of Provinces, in whose power the lives and estates
of many consisted, as it was for Christians and Jews in ancient times, to try
the integrity of them that were to take upon them the Order of Priesthood;
since then there is 72 Nihil dif. ficilius est, quam been imperare.
72 nothing more hard as Dioclesian was used to say, then to govern well;
Princes ought ever to be mindful of the great charge that is committed unto
them, and not to think that God has set them on high to do nothing else but
to follow their pleasures and delights: but they must know as he has set them
in degree above others, so their care must be greater then others, and that
one day they must give an account of their Stewardship, and of the people
committed to their charge; it is their vigilance that keeps subjects in safety;
their labor and travel that affords them ease and rest and delight; they like
stars in the firmament must ever be moving, yet not so much for their own good
as the good of others, as Homer has it in the second book of his Iliads.
Wherefore their thoughts ought sometimes to descend to men of the lowest rank:
for there is no man so mean in a Kingdom but in some kind may be able to do
him service; and in this shall they follow the example of their Creator, who
has numbered the very hairs of their heads; let them ever bear in mind the
saying of Vespasian the Emperor, that a Prince should dye standing.

Henry the Son of Frederick the Emperor was so intensive upon the affairs
of the Empire, that he scant allowed himself time to eat his meat; and when
he was desired to look to himself and have a care of his health, he said that
a private man had liberty to eat when he would, but a Prince that weighed the
heavy burden that lay upon him, had not so.

When the Emperor Rodolph saw certain young men that loved him, to be
sequestered from him, in some indignation, said, for Gods sake suffer them to
come unto me, for I am not therefore called to the Empire that I should be
kept close in a coffin. In this thing those two Noble Emperors Ferdinando and
Maxmilian, did not much swerve from him; for every day at a certain hour they
gave audience to the poor, and willingly accepted such country presents as
they were able to bring unto them. Of Ferdinando it is further reported that
he should say, when he saw one driving an old Woman from him, drive not away
the poor from us, for if we will not hear them, God will not hear us; the
same custom do the Princes of Austria observe, at this day. I was present
when a poor Woman accused one of the Barrons to his face before the Emperor
at the top of the stairs as he came from Church, I saw the Emperor hear her
complaints willingly, and heard him seriously enjoyne him to make her amends;
such Princes as these are worthy to be had in perpetual remembrance: but they
that give themselves wholly to delights, and leave all to their servants, they
must endure oftentimes to hear that of themselves which Claudius Caesar heard
of himself, that they are servants to their servants, because that he was
wholly led by his Wives and freed men, and did only as they would have him;
and therefore did not carry himself like a Prince, but like a servant: for at
their pleasure were all Honors, Armies, Pardons, Punishments, conferred and
infli ed; and indeed the things were almost incredible wherewith the Emperor
suffered himself to be deluded by them, and how they gloried that by their
subtility they had circumvented him; so we read that the Emperor 73 Galba
trium solummodo arbitrio res gerere solebat.
73 Galba was ruled by those only whom the Courtiers commonly called his three
Paedagogues: which occasioned Plinny the second to say, that many Princes being
the Commanders of Citizens, suffer themselves to be vassals of their freed men;
by their Counsels they are guided, by them they hear and speak, by them, nay
rather from them, Praetorships, Praelacies, and Consulships are sought. In
another manner does the same Plinny speak of Trajan, thou give respect to thy
freedmen, but still thou make them know themselves to be freed men, thou
think thou do abundantly favor them, if thou think them to be honest
men, thou know it adds a great luster to thy greatness not to suffer them
to be too great. Wherefore Isaacius an Emperor of the Greeks, may justly be
condemned, who received into his favor a man named Theodor Castamonita, who
led him hudwinkt as a poor servant, or rather as a slave, hither and thither
at his pleasure; for Isaacius put in execution whatsoever he commanded, who
dying, the said Isaacius as if he had been born rather to serve then to
command, received into his favor a young boy that newly came from School, and
preferred him to a very high place, who not only led the Emperor as the little
Fish called Propompes does the Whale whither he would, but whole Legions of
Soldiers besides; but it is no wrong unto such Princes so to be wronged and
dishonored, because they are accessory to the wrong, and consent dispenses
with and takes away an error; but the wrong indeed is as before has been
showed, that it opens a gapp to let in the dishonesty of such as are mischevous
into the Court, and administers an occasion to corrupt the manners of such as
are good, by means whereof the Commonwealth is miserably afflicted, justice
is trampled upon, and both present and future ages sustain loss by it, the
Prince bears the blame of all, for whatsoever is done in the Commonwealth be
it good or evil, it is laid upon him; and he is regularly thought to be of
that condition as they are, 74 Facta ministroru^ sive bona sive ma^a magistro
imputantur.
whom he does employ in the managing of his affairs, as Maecenas long ago told
Octavius Caesar: but this shall suffice touching the Prince. Now will we speak
of his followers, and enquire by what means they that have attained to any
greatness, by the mere favor of their Princes, or by any other means, may
preserve themselves in that state and condition; for as I have said in the
beginning, so I say still, and think it to be most true, that it is a most
difficult thing for him that has attained to any great state and magnificence,
to preserve himself in that state all his life time. Some examples we find
hereof in our histories, but very few; for we find that Joseph was preferred
by Pharoh, to the highest degree of honor in the Kingdom, that he had the
raigns of the government thereof in his own power, that Pharoh reserved to
himself only the bare name and title of King, that he continued in this
height for the space of eighty years without any crushes or crosses, even
until death, being an hundred and ten y^ares of Age when he died; another
example we have of M. Agrippa, who of all those that raised themselves by the
Civil Wars, Seneca thought to be most happy, and without doubt (as Dion Cass:
obs rves) 75 Omnium sua^ ^^ratis optimus.
75 he was one of the best men that lived in his time, he made use of
Augustus his favor for the sole good of the Emperor and the Commonwealth,
and look how much he did excel all others in virtue and goodness, so much
did he debase himself in respect of Augustus; he made use of his wisdom and
fortitude, his honors and preferments to no other end then to do him service,
and to deserve well of the Commonwealth; whence it came to pass, that he was
never offensive to Augustus, or the people, but established the government in
such a manner, that he could not wish to have it better, and so bound the
people unto him by good turns that he did for them, that he became the most
popular man of his time; insomuch, that when he beautified Rome with many
goodly ornaments, which was thought would have drawn the ill will of the people
upon him, he did not only keep their loves still, but he obtained great honor
from Augustus; for at such time as he would have placed in the Temple of the
gods which he built himself, the statue of Augustus, to preserve him in
perpetual memory, and would have written an inscription thereon to his name;
Augustus would not suffer him to do it, but caused him to put up the statue of
the precedent Emperor in the Temple, and his own, and Augustus in the entrance
unto it, which he did not do to any other end, but to manifest his fervent
love and affection to him, and the Commonwealth, which Augustus so accepted
and highly honored him for it; for in his absence he made him chief governor
of the City of Rome, and that he might still heap honor upon him, being
divorst from his wife, he gave him his Daughter in Law in marriage, unto which
he was induced partly for that Maecenas was used to speak thus unto him upon
good deliberation: Now thou have made Agrippa so great, that thou must either
make him thy son in law or he cannot live. These and many other kind
favors he conferred upon him, which he enjoyed all his life time, without any
manner of change or alteration; for after that he had conferred the office of
Tribune upon him from five years to five years, he sent him into Pannonia with
a larger Commission then ever any man had in Italy, and as soon as he heard
of his death, which happened immediately upon his return into Campania; he
came to see his dead corpse, and after a funeral oration made in praise and
honor of him, he caused it to be brought into the City, and to be buried in
his own Sepulcher; and whereas at his death he bequeathed unto the people a
Bath and Garden, where they mig^t freely wash and recreate themselves, which he
christened himself with a name, Augustus did not only confirm his gift, but
gave to every man in particular a doale, as if Agrippa himself had so desired
it; and it was no way prejudicial unto him throughout the whole course of his
life, that he descended not of a noble Family, but was made Noble; this is
another Example of one that continued in prosperity to his lives end, contrary
to the examples which I have before remembered; but because it is a rare one,
and not many of them to be found, I do not see wherefore I should swarve from
the rule I have set down. Tacitus likewise makes mention of Memmius Regulus
that was of so great renown, and authority, that setting aside the Emperor no
man was greater, insomuch that Nero being told, lying very sick, by certain
flatterres that waited upon him, that now the Empire was at an end, answered
that there was one Memmius alive that would have a care, that it should not fall
to the ground; this man afterward betook himse^fe to a private life, he was
not of any great estate, nor of an ancient house, as the same author reports;
this example of Regulus will give good contentment to them that leave all
authority, and in time betake themselves to live private lives; this man was
not so great for honors and estate, as many of them whom we have formerly
remembered, but his credit with his Prince, and his fame, raised by his virtuous
actions, was as great as the greatest in our time, we may remember
Granvillanus Vesontinus, who for the space of twenty years together held the
chief place of authority under Charles the fifth, and was only privy to his
secrets, and died in great grace and favor with him; the Emperor much
bewayling his death, as Sleidan reports, and which added somewhat to his
happiness, Anthony his Son Bishop of Artois succeeded him in his place, whom
his father in his absence did usually depute to manage the affairs of the
Commonwealth: here this is remarkable in this Prince, that he ever used one
man alone, that was more powerful then the rest, to manage the affairs of the
Empire; yet so, that he ever had an eye to the government himself, and to the
man: of the condition of this Prince, and how a Prince ought to behave
himself, that things may fall out successefully, I have already spoken. These
Examples although they be few do teach us, that it is not impossible for him
that has a great place in the Commonwealth under his Prince, to live happily
in it to his dying day, which how it may come to pass, and how such men ought
to carry themselves; I will set down some few documents and precepts, and the
scope of them shall be to advertise them that are on high to avoid those
rocks, that many of those whom we have formerly remembered have fallen upon; and
how it may be done, it will not be lost labor to search diligently into; the
first thing therefore as we have formerly noted is, that thou be sure of a
calling, and not thrust thy self into any place by bribery, or any indirect
means, before thou be called, for the fabric cannot stand, when the
foundation fails; if the beginning be evil, the end must needs be so;
wherefore whosoever thou art that have attained to any place by any indirect
means, it is thy best course to relinquish the same, and to betake thy self
to thy former accustomed course of life, for that it is impossible that thou
should enjoy it quietly, when thou come to it by such means; every
misfortune that befalls thee will pierce thee to the very heart, and trouble
thee, because that thou injuriously did intrude thy self into a place that
appertained not unto thee; for if our proper vocations duly attained admister
unto us many cares and troubles, much more those that are unduly gotten.
Tacitus reports of Brutidius Niger that executed the office of an Edile under
Tiberius Caesar, 76 Brutidius Nigerareibus hone^is cop^osus.
that he was well seen in many good Arts, and that if he had continued his
course, was like to have come to the greatest places in the Commonwealth, but
striving on a sudden to outstrip his equals, and superiors, nay, the the
very limits of his own hopes, he overthrew himself. The same Tacitus further
adds, that there have been diverse hopeful men in the Commonwealth, who
despising that which with little patience might have been had with security,
have hastened to that which being gotten before due time has bred their ruin
and destruction. Hieronimus Messanius seeing Alexander ab Alexandro, as he
writes of himself living in a mean estate and condition of life, blamed him
therefore and told him, though he had taken a great deal of pains, yet he had
not learned to be wise, and related unto him a story of a certain man that 77
Alegat exemplu^ cujusdam qui nullis artibus honestis praevalere potuit.
77 used all the lawful means that he could think of to attain to a
Bishopric, and could not prevail; insomuch that he bethought himself of
another course; he went and bought two or three tunns of the best wine he
could get for his money, and sent them to the Bishop; and not long after he
had what he desired; he spoke of others likewise that were the most
contemptible men in the Commonwealth, such as made it their trade to prey upon
the people, who having injuriously gotten into their hands the Estates of many,
put the same into the Treasury, and by this means became powerful and mighty;
he told him of many others that were of the most vile condition, that by their
wicked and abominable devises raised themsevles out of the dust to great
honors; but these examples of his prevailed not with Alexander, he said he
had rather live in a low degree with the freedom of a good conscience, then by
dishonest courses blemish his good name and reputation; Machiavell endeavors
to prove that 78 Plures fraud qua^ virtute ad honores ascendunt.
78 more men raise themselves to Honors and Estates by fraud then by worth and
merit; but that opinion of his, both Scipio Amiratus and others have at large
confuted by explaning the Presidents which he has alleged for the
confirmation of his opinion, and showed how he has no color for his conceit.
Endeavor therefore whosoever thou art to raise thy self by good means,
otherwise thou shall find; (and so the examples which I have before alleged
will manifest unto thee,) that though thou may flourish for a time, yet in
the end thou shall come to ruin and destruction; for it is not possible,
(which is the greatest misery that can befall them) for such men as raise
themselves by undue means, in future times to be honest; for having once
transgressed the bounds of justice and honesty, they are of necessity
constrained if they will continue their places to be dishonest still, and to
preserve themselves by the same means by the which they have been raised,
which in the end cannot be but fatal unto them; the favor of thy Prince will
do thee no good if it be not obtained by good means, for there is nothing
more uncertain of its own nature, especially when there is no ground for it,
for then thou have God thy enemy, in whose hands are the hearts of Princes;
whatsoever therefore thou do, have God ever in thy mind, so shall all
things that thou take in hand succeed well unto thee; and contrariwise if
thou do not. After thou have done this, in the next place, pray unto God for
grace, wisdom, and understanding, that thou may be able to undergo the
office committed to thy charge a right; and in this let King Solomon be a
pattern unto thee, who although he had a most sanctified man to his Father,
and a wise man to his Tutor, from whom he might learn, touching the Government
of his Kingdom as much as the wit of man could instruct him: yet he prayed to
God in this manner, O Lord God thou have placed me in the Throne of my Father
King David, that am a feeble person too weak for the understanding of thy
judgments and Laws: give me wisdom that I may be able to govern thy
people in judgment and righteousness. After thou have prayed in this manner
for such things as are needful for thee, 79 Exequere munus tuum sum cum cura.
79 then go on cheerfully in thy calling, and execute the same with all
diligence and integrity; meddle with that which belongs to thy self only, and
put not thy sickle in another man's harvest; so that no man may justly tax thee
that thou have omitted any thing which thou ought to have done, or that
another man could have performed the same with more care and diligence: which
that thou may do, thou must have a care that thou do not abuse the power
and authority committed unto thee to do any man wrong, for any private grudge
or malice conceived; neither for hatred nor affection to do any thing that
belongs not to thy calling: observe ever that rule that our Savior has given,
give unto every one that which is due unto him, unto Caesar that which is
Caesar's, and unto God that which is Gods, and that of the Apostle, it is better
to obey God then man: honor thy Prince ever and obey him, but so that thou
must know that above him there is a God, whom thou must more honor and obey:
have a care ever (which many do neglect) to say or do any thing to please him,
which is repugnant to the will of God, for though it be a difficult and
dangerous thing to oppose a Prince in any thing, and so to draw his anger and
displeasure upon thy head, yet know it for a certainty, that if thou shall
fear him more then God, by avoiding the smoke thou fallest into the fire;
cursed is he that with hope of impunity commits an offense, and though such a
man may escape for a time, yet in the end God will punish him with ruin and
destruction; for although God be long suffering and gentle, yet when his wrath
is once incensed, nothing will appease him; and be sure of this, that God whom
thou have served and obeyed, will so assist thee that though thou may for a
time incurr the displeasure of thy Prince, yet in the end thy innocence shall
be made known to thy praise and glory, so that the Prince shall not only thank
thee when he shall know thy integrity, but shall commend and applaud thee; and
this was Joseph's case, whom when his Master had made him Steward of his house,
and committed all things to his power and authority, being solicited by his
Mistress to lie with her, he would not consent, saying, how can I commit this
great offense and not sin against God? who though he was for a time by his
Mistress calumniations wrought out of favor with his Master and cast into
Prison; yer in the end by Gods assistance he was delivered, and where before he
had but the Command of a private Family, he was advanced to be the second man
in the Kingdom, and heard the saying of our Savior sounding in his ears, go
to good servant, thou have been faithful in a little, I have made thee ruler
over much, enter into thy Masters joy. So when the King of Egypt commanded
Sephora and Phua, the two midwives of the Hebrews to kill all the male children
of the Hebrews as soon as they were borne, they fearing God, did not obey his
Command, but kept them alive; for which God blessed them and built them houses.
So when Saul commanded his servants to kill the Priests with whom David
sojourned, his servants would not therein execute his Command; Ioab was not so
well-minded, for he presently upon the Command of King David, betrayed Vriah to
death, and though he dissuaded the King a little to number the people, yet
when he importuned him thereunto, he listened to his solicitation and obeyed
him: but it had been better for him that he had hazarded his displeasure for
the present, and so have escaped and turned aside the wrath of God and miseries
which ensued. Therefore let him as much as in him lies carry himself uprightly
toward all men, not so much to avoid the calumnies of the envious, and the
backbiter, or the displeasure of the Prince, as to keep himself in grace and
favor with God; for it is the greatest happiness to do no wrong to any. Let
him think with himself, that 80 Cogitor multa sibi non licere quae hominibus
in angulo jacentibus licent.
80 it is not lawful for him to do many things, which men of mean degree
living out of the rode in some corner of the Earth, may do without exception;
that a great fortune is a great burden, that all his actions are exposed to
the view of the world; that his thoughts are scarce secret to himself, because
that all men's eyes are fixed and fastened upon him; it is not lawful for him to
intend his profit, his studies, his pleasures, nor to addict himself wholly to
any thing, because he is not his own, but his Princes servant; therefore let
him eschew Pride, Coveteousnesse, Cruelty, and the like, wherewith they that
live in high places are usually tainted; let him cast his eyes behind him, and
see what he was, not what he is, and at no time behave himself violently, or
insolently toward any man; here the Council of Amuratus is religious, that 81
Non ob propriam virtutem.
81 thou should ever think that thou art raised to that degree of honor,
not for any worth or merit of thine own, but by the divine providence of God,
who has been pleased to work upon the affection of the Prince to favor, and
affect thee above other men; this if thou do duly consider, it must
necessarily follow, that thou will ever carry thy self respectively to thy
Prince, and be lowly in thine own eyes, giving the glory to God alone: thou will be gentle, merciful, and liberal, and spend and end thy days quietly in
the peace of a good conscience; and that thou may do here what Sophocles
says in Ajax Lorar, let these Examples move thee, that thou do not grow
proud, or speak irreverently of the name of God, if he has endowed thee with
better endowments, or a better fortune then others; for that when the sun is
at the highest it declines again, and reduces all humane things to that they
formerly wre, but the love of God co^tinues to the end to those that are good,
and his hatred to the wicked. He that is thus resolved will have a care never
to advise his Prince to proceed in any dishonorable action, but to do that
which tends to his honor, and the good of the Commonwealth. I deny not but
that many an honest man is put to a great strait oftentimes, in businesses of
this nature; for it is a difficult thing, for a man to go so equally between
honesty and justice that are strict and severe, and the licentious pleasures of
the Court, that he do not run himself aground either on the one side or
the other. The Examples of Burrhus and Seneca, the two worthy Counselors of
Nero, do manifest the same; they were governors during his minority, and
well agreeing, bare equal stroke in diverse faculties; Burrhus ruled in
military discipline, and in reforming abuses; Seneca in precepts of eloquence
and instructing him to carry himself courteously toward all men, helping one
the other in their charge, that they might with more ease bridle the youths
slippery age with honest and lawful pleasures, when they saw him falling into
exorbitant courses; his Mother was an eyesore unto him, being a woman of a
high spirit, and ambitious of government, of whom when Iturius and Calvisius
had reported, that he had made choice of Rubellius Plautus, a man by the
Mothers side as nearly allied unto Augustus, as Nero was to her husband, and so
to turn topsie-turvie the state of the Commonwealth, Nero understanding thereof,
being full fraught with wine grew fearful, and desirous to dispatch her out
of the way, delaid no time, until 82 Burrhus necem ejus promittebar.
82 Burrhus had promised him to do the deed; but notwithstanding he did not
perform it, but alleged for himself, that she had no accusers; but one that
lived in the house of her enemies, imputed what was done to ignorance and
rashness, and so deferred the doing thereof until night, (which was spent in
rioting,) was past, and the day was come; by this time the fear of Nero was
well assuaged; and when the morning came, Agrippina was heard first of Burrhus,
then of Nero himself, what she could say for her self, and she did not only
purge her self from the crimes laid to her charge, but had her accusers
punished, and satisfaction for them that stuck unto her in the cause; and
hitherto Burrhus carried himself noblly; but Nero still plotting her death,
found out an invention for the purpose, took a course that there might be a
gally made loose by art in the bottom, that should let her fall into the Sea,
when she suspected least; but whilst Nero expected Messengers, that his plot
had taken effect, news came that she had escaped the danger; at which Nero
being amazed, fearing that she would revenge her self out of hand of him,
advised with Burrhus and Seneca, what course was best for him to take, being
not certain whether they had any notice of his former design; they stood mute
for a time, and said nothing, fearing their Counsel should not take effect;
but in the end they agreed, that if Agrippina lived, Nero could not; then
Seneca, the forwarder hitherto of the two, cast his eyes upon Burrhus, as if
that he should have asked, whether that the Soldiers should be commanded to
execute the murder: but he answered, that the Guard being bound to all Caesar's
house, and so mindful of Germanicus, would not undertake so cruel an
enterprise against his progeny; and that it was better to use Anicetus in it,
who had undertaken to do it; Anicetus without any delay committed that bloody
fact, slew Agrippina the Mother of Nero; and here I do not think it strange,
that the actors of this Tragedy were beloved of Nero: but that they did well,
or deserved praise for it, no man shall ever persuade me. To omit to speak any
thing of the bloody fact, Nero being now freed from his Mother, he addicted
himself wholly to all licentious courses, and unlawful sports, and delights.
Burrhus and Seneca willingly connived at some of his imperfections, fearing
that if they should oppose him, he would run into more desperate courses; for
they hoped when he had been glutted with his delights, he would have became a
new man; but it fell out otherwise; for having once transgrest the bounds of
modesty, he grew worse and worse, so that sometimes in the public view of the
world, in the Vatican he would play the part of a Coachman, drive a Chariot,
sometimes of a Stage Player, and sometimes of a Harper, in the presence of his
familiars, among whom was Burrhus, who beheld him with a heavy heart, though he
durst not as Tacitus says, but applaud him; at length he came to that hight of
impiety, that 83 Templ^ per Asiam and Achaiam dispoliat.
83 he set fire on the City, and spoiled the Temples, not only there, but
throughout all Achaia, and Asia; therefore Seneca, that he might avoid the
displeasure of the multitude, and not be thought to be accessory to the said
misdemeanour, petitioned him, which he should have done long before, and so
have avoided his hatred, 84 Longinqui ruris secessum orat.
84 that he would give him leave to spend his days far remote in the Country;
which request being denied, he betook himself to a Chamber, and as a sick
man never went out of it. I must acknowledge they live in a miserable
condition, that take upon them the government of such beasts, whom all the
world can hardly parallel for brutishness; therefore very often as we have
heard, his vices prevailed over their virtues, their understanding and
consciences, and in the end overthrew them. Unto the former Examples, it will
not be impertinent to add the Example of Prexaspes, that so thou may see how
deerly they that are the Counselors of Princes do sometimes pay for giving
them good Counsel: Seneca who has written most excellently of that, has this
story, Prexaspes being gracious with Cambises, King of Persia, seeing him much
addicted to Wine, did advise him to drink more moderately, for that Ebriety was
an odious thing in a Prince, that should be the pattern of sobriety to his
people: unto whom he answered, that thou may know Prexaspes, that I never
forget my self, I will make it appear, that though I drink hard, mine eyes
and hands are able to do their proper office; whereupon he drank more
liberally in larger boules then he did at other times: and being full fraught
with Wine, he commanded Prexaspes son to go beyond the threshould of the
door, and to stand there, holding his left hand over his head; Cambises then
bent his bow and struck his arrow into his heart, which was the mark he shot
at; and having ripped up his body, showed Prexaspes his arrows head, sticking in
his sons heart, and looking back upon him, asked him whether his hand was not
steady enough, who answered, that Apollo himself could not have shot more
steadily. This might seem to deter the servant of a Prince from giving him
good Counsel. But this did nothing at all daunt Craesus, that was an eye
witness thereof; for not long after he being one that loved Prexaspes, was so
bold, as to tell Cambises of this and other his cruelties, insomuch that he
thought to dispatch him out of the way, as he did the other with his arrow:
and when he saved himself by flight, he commanded his servants to kill him;
whereupon they apprehended him, and kept him close prisoner, to this end, that
if the King would free him, he might, if not, they would execute his command;
but Cambises afterward repenting himself of what he intended, was glad to
hear that Craesus was safe and sound, and commanded the ministers that
apprehended him to be put to death; the innocence of this man kept him alive,
but I must confess not without a great deal of danger; but all Princes are
not of Cambises or Neros mind; nay, very few, which is a great blessing of
God, throughout the whole world; for I am of opinion that most of the Princes
will listen to any advice that tends to their honor, and welfare of their
people, and if not reward them that shall so advise them, yet not punish them,
or at least not punish them to their utter ruin and destruction. 85 Ars
Ministri est non importune no^ inte^pestive, non acerbe principi contradicere.
85 It is the wisdom of a servant, at no time to oppose and contradict his
Prince importunately, unseasonably, sharply, superfluously, without respect of
time, and place, but to take his opportunity, and with all reverence, and
respect, when they shall see him wandering, to bring him in the way again,
having no other aim or end in it, but only the good of the Prince, and the
welfare of the Commonwealth; for as Erasmus says in his Book of the Praise of
folly, that truth has ever in it self a certain natural inbred force to
delight the hearer, if there be nothing in it that may offend; therefore when
fools speak the truth they are heard with delight, which if wise men should
do, would be capital unto them; and the reason is because that fools speak
without the least suspicion of love or hatred, but so do not wise men that
know and understand the business they speak of. Therefore as far forth ss he
is able let a Servant approach the presence of his Prince with all dutiful
respect, and in a due time: and then let him make no doubt but truth will
prevayle, if it savor not of spleen or bitterness; an example hereof we have
of Augustus, with whom Maecenas was in special grace and favor, and not so
much for any thing else as for this, that when he was transported with choler
and fury beyond himself, Maecenas would undertake him and bring him to
himself again; as for example, when upon a time Augustus sat as judge
himself in person, and was minded to have condemned diverse to death, Maecenas
seeing what he was going about, and being not able to come unto him, he writ
these words in a Table, arise from thence executioner, and threw it unto him as
if it had contained some other matter: which as soon as he read, he arose and
condemned no man; and this passage of Maecenas did not offend Augustus, but he
was 86 Gaudebat se talem amicum habuisse.
86 glad that he had a friend that would put him in mind of that which was
not fit for him to do, which in his choler without observing a decorum he was
about to do; and it was remarkable of Maecenas, that though he did oppose
Augustus in his beloved sins, yet he was ever beloved of him, and commended by
the multitude; and let that Prince that does not follow the Example of this
Emperor, know assuredly that he does expose himself to imminent danger; for
those Princes whosoever they are that carry themselves so that their
Councillors shall not dare to tell them the truth, or any thing that is
distasteful unto them, let them assure themselves that no good can come
thereon; nay it is better for them to be without such Councillors then to
have them; for when a Prince shall understand the truth of things, he will
peradventure more seriously consider of them, and be more wary how to proceed
therein; but when no man shall dare to cross him, then what comes first into
his mind is approved of and consented unto as a thing done so well that no man
could do better, no not he himself.

This did much hurt Sebastian King of Lusitania, that dyed in Africa, of whom
Hieronymus Connestagius thus writes, In the mean time says he, King Sebastian
called his Captains and Peers together to advise concerning the removing of
their tents, and when he demanded of them what they conceived concerning the
matter, many were afraid to speak their minds freely; for although they thought
it most convenient to sail to Laraceen, yet because they saw the King was of
another other mind, they thought it safer for them against their consciences
to flatter him in his opinion, and so by councelling him ill to keep his love,
then by advising him well to purchase his displeasure.

Of Marcus Agrippa that was both powerful with Augustus, and beloved of the
people, we have heard of before, and of Byrrhus whom we have likewise
remembered, Tacitus affirms that he is beloved still in the City for his
virtues, which I would to God the Courtiers of our time would seek for; but
many of them have a certain foolish conceit, let them pardon me if I give them
a true Epithet, that then they do the offices of faithful servants, if they
can prevail with their Prince to oppose their Subjects and people in every
thing, if they can oppress them, afflict them, vex them, diminish their
privileges, and so bring all their estates if it were possible by one project
into the Princes Treasury, forgetting that by this means they make the Prince
but a private man, no better then a Merchant or Usurer in pilling and polling
the People committed to their charge, for whose good God has put all power and
authority into his hands; but who receives good by this? the Prince is noe way
enriched, or made more powerful by it; for there is no such fortress to a
Prince as the love of his Subjects: but this is done that they may divide the
spoil among themselves: and that those good men which staud for the
Commonwealth being brought to disgrace, they alone may bear the sw^y; let him
therefore whom we instruct have ever before his eyes, as the end of all his
actions, the common good and safety of the people, being the end and scope of
all Laws and Government, the which if he shall do, as Agrippa, Seneca,
Maecenas, Byrrhus, whom we have before remembered did, he will do his
uttermost endeavor to persuade the Prince above and before all things in the
world to look after that which tends to his own honor, and the good of the
Commonwealth; for as it is no way profitable to the stomach, if at one meal
it shall be so glutted, that it be ready to burst, or in a few days so much
meat be thrown into it as will serve for six months: so it is no way
profitable to a Prince at once to take all men's estates to himself and to care
more that he may have much then well to have gotten it, and to enjoy it long;
therefore if thou would well consider of it thou shall find that there are
none that do more endammage the Prince, then they that do advise him to intend
his own private good: and indeed if thou would search into it, thou shall see
that those men do not look so much after his private good as the good of
themselves; and therefore by all manner of means they seek his favor; but
they that seek not so much their own good, as the good of the Commonwealth,
have ever a care that as well the people as the Prince, without whom he is but
a single man, may flourish and prosper; for the head cannot be perfect, if the
other members of the body be impotent, and not able to perform their proper
office. Of this Seneca in his Tragedy entitled Octavia takes notice, saying,

87 Pulchrum est eminere interv^ros illustres.
87 It is a famous worthy thing,
Amidst renowned Lords alone to ring;
And wisely to care your Country for to save,
And well your self to captive folk behave.
From cruel brutish slaughter to abstain,
And void of mood to wreake your angry pain;
And to the world a quiet calm to give,
That all your age the people in peace may live:
This is a worthy praise without all crime,
This is the path to Heaven whereby we clime.
This then is the scope of all, that a Princes servant ought so indifferently
to carry himself between him and his people, that as he honors and loves the
Prince, so he should the people, yet not for their sakes, but for his;
therefore let him always be careful, that he may not justly be taxed, as
Seneca was, that he drew the hearts of the Citizens fron the Prince to
himself; for as it 88 Civilia in genia filiorum regnantibus displicent.
88 is distasteful to Princes to see their sons have popular wits; so it is
to see their servants; and this he shall be sure to do, and keep himself
from all suspicion, if he follow the Example of Agrippa, and so honor his
Prince, that he may be sure that he studies nothing more then his safety and
honor; and above all things, let him have a special care, that he do not
provoke him in word or deed; for 89 Pertinax memoria est verborum acerborum.
89 bitter words take a deep impression in the minds of great persons, and the
deeds which ensue thereupon, strike more deep into them: and though they do
not for the present either take notice of them, or at least revenge them; yet
when any small occasion is given, they are called to remembrance; and when they
little dream of it, they are severely punished for them. Joab slew Absalon,
contrary to the command of the King his father; and afterward seeing him
condole his death, sharply with menaces upbraided him, which the King took very
ill, and although he did not at that time inflict any punishment upon him; yet
upon his deathbed he commanded his son to punish him, and without doubt, for
that cause, though he did not then express it. The same does Alexander the
great confess in the case of Philotas; this man, says he, when I writ unto
him out of love, and familiarity, to acquaint him what fortune had befallen me
by the oracle of Jupiter Hammon; he was so bold as to answer my Letter, that he
was glad to hear that the gods had accepted me to be one of their company; but
yet I must have compassion of them that live under me; the gods do not as men
do; they give, and take nothing from any man: these are marks of a mind long
ago estranged from me, and of a man that envies to see my prosperity; which
grief, my Soldiers so long as they could for the love they bore unto
Philotas, prevailed with me to conceal. The very same thing does Chalchas
testify in Homer; now says he, does Jupiter give reins unto his power, and
now does he persecute with eagerness the man of low degree; and though for a
time he concealed his wrath, and made a fair show, yet afterward it returned
into his bosom again, and would not be satisfied, until it had revenged it
self. Therefore I say, he must have a special care, that he do not provoke
his Prince with any harsh language; especially that he do not carry himself
so, that his Prince shall stand in fear of him: which we have before observed
to be a great fault in the Earl of St. Paullont of Commines, and in Joab that
threatened the King, that unless he would observe him, the people would
renounce their Allegiance unto him; therefore Philip Commines says, that if
that he had a friend, he would advise him to carry himself so, that his Master
might love him, not fear him; for that he never knew man, of whom his Master
stood in fear, that sped not ill in the end: Examples whereof we have very
many. This presumtion oftentimes proceeds of the good service he has done;
for he thinks his experience so great, that he cannot be spared, and his
deserts such, that his Master ought to bear all things at his hands; but
Princes on the contrary side both say and think, that he is bound to do him
service, and desire nothing more then to be rid of such malepert fellows; and
he alleges a saying of the King his Master, that good servic^s sometimes
undo a man, and are recompensed with great ingratitude, not always by the
Masters forgetfulness, but sometimes by the servants own fault, who presuming
upon their good service behave themselves arrogantly, either toward their
Masters, or their fellows; and further touching those that come to court, this
was his opinion, that he is more hapier, that receives a benefit of the
Prince; he serves without any great desert, whereby he stands bound to his
Prince, then he that has done so great service, that his Prince seems
indebted to him: adding that he for his part loved those better that were
bound to him, then they to whom he was bound.

Again let not the servant of a Prince opprobriously be bragging, and boasting
of his own merits, nor in other affairs be troublesome to him, but let him
contain himself within the bounds of modesty, and assume rather too little,
then too much, unto himself. Quintus Curtius affirms, that it 90 Commemoratio
meritoru^ suorum in ministro gravis est principi.
90 was fatal unto Clitus and Philotas, that Alexander heard that they boasted
what they had done in his service, and therefore did suspect them both of
dishonesty and disloyalty to him.

Again, 91 Ne praemiorum petitione sit gravis.
91 let not a servant be ever craving and begging of his sovereign; for of such
kind of people a Prince desires to be freed, especially if they be proud with
all, or malepertly upbraid him for what they have done for him.

Again, 92 Injurias principis hilari valtu ferat.
92 if thy Prince shall offer thee any hard measure, as thou conceivest,
undergo it with all alacrity, and by no means mu^mur and repine at it; for as
Seneca well observes, they will do it again, if they conceive they have done
it before; for men of great fortunes have this property, that they will hardly
be reconciled; and whom they once distaste they will ever hate. The answer of
him is well known, who being demanded how he did continue til his old age so
gracious in Court, when many others were cast off, answered, by passing by and
taking no notice of injuries offered him; so Prexaspes whom we have before
remembered, being asked by Cambises King of Persia, that shot his Son to the
heart with an arrow, whether any man had a more steadfast hand then he,
answered, Apollo himself did not shoot more steadfastly; so Harpagus when the
King of Persia feasted him, being asked how he liked his entertainment,
answered that the Table of Princes is the mirour of mirth; so when
Christophorus sent Morus a special Ambassador after the death of Sebastian
King of Portugal, to congratulate with him that was to succeed in the Kingdom,
John Silvius that was Leiger Ambassador there before, seeing himself
neglected, and hearing diverse rumors raised of him, he interpreted all to the
best, and took it as a special favor, because he saw there was no remedy.
Wherefore whosoever thou art, if thou desire to be powerful thou must
patiently endure whatsoever befalls thee.

Again, if thy Prince has been beneficial unto thee, as it must needs be if
thou have served long in any high place, make it known unto to all the world,
and to himself when occasion is offered; so did Seneca speak of Nero, that
he had been exceeding gracious unto him in conferring upon him much Treasure;
so that he oftentimes took it into his consideration why he that descended not
of any noble Family, should be ranked among the Peers of the City.

Again let him be careful that he never assume the honor of any achievements
to himself, especially if they be of any great consequence; for so the most
prudent of all Nations have ever done; Ioab a General of King David's Army,
when he besieged Rabba a City of the Ammonites, and was upon point to have it
delivered unto him, he sent unto the King that he would be pleased to come in
Person thither, least the honor thereof might be attributed unto him; so did
Craterus a chief Commander under Alexander when he besieged Artacena, after
all Articles were agreed upon between them; he staid only the Kings coming,
(as i^ was fit) that he might have the honor of it. In the acting of this
part, Agrippa was most expert; for although he achieved many great and famous
enterprises, and obtained many glorious victories unto Augustus, yet never did
he assume the glory of them to himself; and whatsoever he bestowed upon him,
he employed it not to his own private profit, but for the good of Augustus
and the Commonwealth; when he had overcome the Cantabrians, he did not so much
as write to the Senate of it, or triumphed according to the Decree of Augustus;
he brought the water which is called Virginalis at his own charge into the
City, and named it Augusta, which Augustus took very kindly from him again,
when he returned home out of France, where he bravely quitted himself having
subdued his enemies; he forbear to ride in Triumph, because not long before
his Master had been in a fight at Sea by Sextus Pompey, and he thought it
would not become him to ride in Triumph, his Master having had such ill
success; for it is reported of him that he was used to say that very many
Princes will not endure that any man should be accounted more excellent then
themselves; and therefore they do usually go themselves in person upon
designs wherein there is small difficulty and danger: but upon desperate
attempts they ever put others: and if at any time they are compelled to commi^
the charge of any enterprise to others, wherein there is little danger, yet
they will not endure that they shouid have the Honor of the business: for as
they do not desire to ^eare of their ill success, so they will not have the
honor of the day to be ascribed ^o them. Antipater was well experienced in
this, and herefore when he obtained a famous victory against the Spartans and
their confederates, knowing the fame thereof would but draw envy upon him,
being greater then did belong to a General, and withal well knowing that
though Alexander had a desire to have his enemies vanquished, yet he would not
have Antipater to be the man to have the honor of it; for that he supposed it
would be derogotary to his honor; therefore I say Antipater well knowing the
mind of Alexander, would not presume to hazard the glory of the day upon his
own judgment, but advised with the Graecians what was best to be done; for he
thought it more safe to himself for a stranger to have the honor of it, then a
Citizen, because the Citizens would envy his greatness, and study how to
level it with the dust; the self same does Cornelius Tacitus commend in
Agricola, that he never gloried in any thing that he did, but as a servant
he ever ascribed the honor to the chief Captain and Commander: by which his
humble and modest carriage he lived without envy, but not without fame and
reputation. It is reported that after that he had obtained a famous victory
against the Britains, and thereby raised an immortal fame to himself, that
Domitian began to be jealous and afraid of him, that he being but a private
man, his glory and fame should be greater then the Emperors; whereupon
Agricola having delivered up his charge, returned home unto Rome; and that he
might avoid the concourse of the people and his friends that would have met
him, came secretly to the Emperors Palace in the night, as he was commanded,
where he was received with a short complement, and not so much as a word used
to any of his followers; and now being at home among peaceable men, unto whom
the name of a Soldier was distasteful, he so tempered his military virtues
with others 93 Otium penites auxit.
93 that as before he advanced War, so now he studied to increase and
advance Peace, and Tranquillity; he was in his apparel comely, in his speech
mild, and gentle, going, ever accompanied with one or two of his friends; so
that he that had seen Agricola, would not have judged him to have been a man
that had affected fame or popularity.

Again, let not a 94 Ne ^a^iliarem se nimispraebea^.
94 Princes servant make himself too familiar with him, by abusing his favor
and love unto him; for this has undone many a man, w^o by reason of their
familiarity have forgotten their duties, and have carried themselves toward
them as if they were equals and companions: an Example hereof we have in
Vestinus Cosse a Roman, that was slain by Nero. The displeasure that he
first took against him, did arise out of his overbold, and malepert behavior
toward him; for he being privy to Nero's imperfections, did oftentimes
scurrilously put jests upon him; which when soever they savor of truth, leave
a sting behind them; wherefore Nero fearing the fury of his f iend, took a
sudden course with him. So Dagobert the son of Clothar, the second King of
France, whipped Sadragsilius, and caused his beard to be shaved, having been
sometimes his tutor, though afterward preferred to be governor of Aquitane,
under the King, because he carried himself toward him as if he had been his
fellow and companion; for amongst many other passages of his, sitting once near
unto him at a solemn banquet, he was so saucy as to snatch the cup out of
Dagoberts hand, and to drink up all the drink, as if they had been fellows and
equals; wherefore though Clothar at first took it ill from his son, that he
did deal so with Sadragsilius, whom he had preferred to be governor, under
him, of a Country; yet in the end he forgave him, and punished Sadragsilius for
his malepertnes and saucy carriage of himself toward him.

The people of Arragon being destitute of a King, they by the Popes authority,
sent for one Ranimirus, a Bastard-sonne of Sancius, out of a Monastery, and put
the Crown upon his head; who intending War against the Moors, after the
Nobility had fitted him with a horse for that purpose, and had put a buckler in
his right hand, and a spear in his left, they reaching unto him the reins of
his bridle, he desired them that they would put that into his mouth, for that
his hands were full already; the Barons observing his simplicity, in that, and
other things, smiled, and derided him, whereupon setting aside his former
monastical simplicity, sent for eleven of the chiefest of them to Osea. and
caused their heads to be cut ^ff, telling them of a Spanish proverb, that the
Woolfe would not endure jests.

So that as I have said, and produced Philotas for an Example, who relying upon
the favor of Alexander spoke too freely unto him: let him never with offensive
words or deeds provoke his Prince, let him with all circumspection reflect his
thoughts upon himself, so shall he never run into this error; we read that
Anna Montemorant was very gracious with the French King, Henry the second, and
admitted to be his bedfellow; but who can say if the King had lived long,
that he would have continued his former favor unto her?

Again, let him be careful, that he do not as Sejanus, and Perennius did,
and as many do at this day, take 95 Ne princepem a rebus gerendis avertat
95 upon him to direct the Prince, and to divert him from his intended design,
but rather to do what he does, especially in businesses of consequence by the
Princes special command and authority; for by this means if the business
succeed not according to expectation, or if he be questioned for it, he may
easily answer it, and give satisfaction both to the Prince and People. 96 Caute
omnia agat.
96 let him be ever cautelous and wary, and think that every place he comes
into is beset with traps of Treachery, hatred and calumny for him; this does
Cicero elegantly prescribe in an Oration, which he has made in the behalf of
Flaccus, wherein he shows the unhappiness of such as are powerful and
mighty: O the miserable estate (says he) of them to whom the governments of
Provinces are committed, who if they be diligent they be hated, if they be
negligent reproached, if liberal un^ewarded, if they speak it is
misinterpreted, if they hear it is dangerous, upon whom all smile, when many
think full ill, being ever exposed to public and private displeasure; at their
first coming they are saluted, whilst they stay they are observed, but when
ehey depart they are neglected; therefore as much as lies in his power, let him
take heed of envy, the most general scourge to such as are in high places,
which as he may by diverse means prevent, so especially, if he lay this
foundation of which we have spoken before, that all his actions shall tend to
the good of his King and Country, and not to his own private profit, or to
satisfy his lusts and affections, 97 Sit modestus, humilis.
93 whosoever proposes this end to himself, will always be of an humble
lowly and temperate Spirit, and so stop all the passages of envy hatred and
calumnies which otherwise would have access unto him.

Again, the higher he is let him ever the more lowly and reverently esteem
of himself, and consider that the greatest fortunes have the least freedom,
and by how much the larger his Commission is, by so much his moderation should
be the more in the execution of it; let him fear the turning of the wheel:
for fortune never prefers a man but she threatens to bring him down again.

Whom dawne of day has seen to sit on high,
Him in the dust bath seen the evening sky.
Let none rejoice too much that good has got,
Let none despair too much that has it not.
For Clotho keeps both fortunes in her power,
And them full often changes in one hour.
98 Immo^icos honores fugiat.
98 Let him never desire to climb too high, but avoid those honors which make
him equal with his Sovereign, for that high places are subject to thunder and
lightning, and if Elpenor fall it is fatal unto him, when he that is below may
fall and rise again without any detriment: this did Macro do, whom we have
before remembered, and this did Clodius Albinius, who when Commodus Caesar for
his good service would have conferred upon him the Title of Caesar, and have
given him a power to grant Pensions, and invested him in a Princely robe,
refused his courtesies, saying, that Commodus sought to overthrow him. And as
great honors, 99 Immodicas opes declinet.
99 so great Possessions in my opinion are not to be desired; I am not
ignorant that in the judgment of many this that I say will seem to be a
paradox, because they co^ceive the more they enjoy, the more fortunate they
think themselves to be; they seldom consider that great estates are attended
with great hatred and envy, nay they are of Plautus mind, I had rather mine
enemies envy me then I them; for to be envied is a badge of prosperity, to
envy of adversity; the poor are envious, they that are envied have the world
at will: but whatsoever they say, this Counsel is not to be neglected, unless
they will minister unto themselves an occasion of ruin and destruction, as the
former examples do suffic ently teach us. I will not here produce any thing,
either out of the writings of the Philosophers or Theologians, which have
written very judiciously in contempt and derision of riches; neither will I
show that the great fortunes of many men are provocations unto them to carry
themselves proudly toward their inferiors, and insolently toward all men:
and so by abusing of them never attain their hopes and desires; for it is a
very difficult thing for a man to bridle his affections, when he has such
Instruments to spur him on, so that he that accused P. Anteius unto Nero,
told him the cause of his licentious course of life was his riches, which had
undone many a man; for he that has gotten the Estates of many rich men into
his hands, will easily be persuaded that he is a Prince; therefore I will put
them in mind of that which Seneca heard from his enemies, that upon many of
them that followed the Courts of Princes, their riches have drawn envy, upon
many ruin and destruction; what a massy Estate did Seneca raise under Nero by
his wit and learning within the space of four years? with what eagerness did
he search after Wills and Orphans at Rome? how did he drayne Italy, and the
Provinces adjoining with his excessive usury? how did he endeavor to winn the
love of the Citizens, and in his Gardens, and houses, to exceed, as if he had
been a Prince? The same thing, that is for that he did not add bounds to his
riches, but out of a Stoicall pride, which makes such as are active turbulent,
occasioned Plautus his death. The selfsame thing overthrew Valerius Asiaticus
under Claudius, of whom Sosibius, that brought up Germannicus, under a pretense
of friendship gave the Emperor a Caveat, affirming that estates too great in
subjects are prejudicial to Princes. Dion observes, that he refused to accept
the consulship a second time to the end, that he might enjoy his riches, and
free himself from envy, and danger; but that did him no good; his riches in
the end occasioned his ruin: many other Examples has Dion to that purpose;
and Scipio Amiratus evidently demonstrates, that great fortunes, and estates,
are as dangerous to great men, as extreme poverty is troublesome to poor men:
on the contrary side, as Tacitus observes, in extremity of sickness, Nero
thought Memmius Regulus newly raised to be a Gentleman addicted to Peace, and
Tranquillity, worthy of the Empire; his course of life was out of the compass
of danger; it nothing availed Valerius Asiaticus, as we have a little before
remembered, nor Seneca to do as they did to avoid danger; nay, Seneca had done
more warily, and wisely, if so be he had observed his own precepts, stopped the
passage of his immoderate desires, and forborne to have made that cold and poor
excuse that it was no good manners to refuse the courtesies of a Prince. A mean
therefore as well in this, as in every thing else, is to be preferred, and the
holy Prayer of King Solomon to be had in perpetual remembrance. Two things
have I required of thee, says he, before I die, deny me not them, remove from
me vanity, and lies, give me neither poverty, nor riches; feed me with food
convenient for me, lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord; or
lest I become poor, and steal, and take thy Name in vain. So that the same
our Seneca affirms our Patrimonies ought to be contracted into narrow rooms,
that so we may not be subject, and exposed to the spoils and sports of
fortune; those bodies that are low, and little, and may be contracted into
narrow rooms, are not so subject to the dangers of the Enemy, as those that
are high and mighty; he is the happiest man that is not in poverty, yet is a
neighbor unto it. Again, the same Seneca says, that in this Sea of the
World, there is such a vicissitude, and alteration of estates, that it cannot
be but that he that is full fraught, must be assaulted with many storms, and
tempests; therefore his Counsel is not to be neglected; let them reduce their
estates into a narrow room, that the weapons of envy and malice may do them
no harm; he that loves the golden mean, lives neither in a sordide Cottage,
or golden Palace.

Again, let such a man have a special care, 100 Ne publica praedia sibi
acquirat,
100 that he do not at any time make a prey of the Commrnwealth, which is a
thing too too common with many that are in grace and favor with their Princes;
for goods gotten by such means do like a moth, or canker usually consume goods
well gotten, and give occasion both to Prince, and people to envy their
estates; for although great estates, if well gotten, ought not to be hurtful,
and prejudicial to a man; yet a very little occasion will persuade a Prince,
that such estates joined with authority, may prove dangerous unto him; for
generally we do not prye into men's actions, and observe what they do, but
what they are able to do; but truly when I persuade a man to observe a mean
in the getting of an estate, that has opportunity to exceed a mean, I speak
to a man that has no ears; wherefore though he relish not what I say, yet
let him observe in the getting of his estate, the rule which Seneca prescribed
the Philosopher; if he have a desire to have abundance, let him satisfy his
desires, yet let him not raise himself by wronging, or ruinating of any, in
questioning them for their lives to gain their estates, or by any sordide or
base projects, and then no doubt they will continue with them and their
Posterity; and none will envy them but malignant spirits.

Again the Council that we have given to the Prince, the same do we give to
his servants, that he would not take upon himself the sole Government of the
Commonwealth, which many do seek with all eagerness, being of Gneius
Pompeius mind that would not end^re an equal, or that any man should bear
any rule but himself; but let the man we speak of, if he love his own
safety, desire that one may be joined in Commission with him, though the
Prince desire to repose the whole trust in him alone; and if the Prince do so
much favor him that he will have him to be the chief man still in power and
authority, which cannot be without exceeding great danger unto him, yet let
one or other be privy to all his actions with whom he may consult and be
assisted: so shall he with more ease and safety undergo businesses, and if
things succeed prosperously, he shall have the honor of them: if not, he has
ever a witness to clear him, upon whom if occasion be, he may lay part of
the blame; and this all wise men ever did, and do at this day; so did Diomedes
whom Homer has remembered, who being commanded in the night to take a survey of
his enemies, desired that one might go along with him, because that two heads
would be able to see and understand more then one, and with more boldness and
alacrity proceed: for one man may think of a thing that is profitable, and his
heart may faint, and fear occasion him not to proceed therein; but when two
are joined, their Courage and Counsels are more resolute and constant: whose
request being granted, he chose Ulysses for his Companion, saying with him he
did not fear to go through a band of armed men, through fire and water, and
to adventure upon any design were it never so dangerous; so Byrrhus and Seneca
were Neros governors during his minority, in equal authority, well agreeing,
and bare equal stroke in diverse faculties; but when Byrrhus dyed, Nero gave
himself to licentiousness, and Senecas authority began to decline, because he
wanted his friend to advise withal; but the examples of Publius Furius, and
Lucius Crassus two Noble Romans which are remembered by Valerius Maximus, are
most pertinent to this purpose: the one of them being chosen to go Ambassador
into Spain, being an employment which he much desired, compelled Q. Metellus,
and Q. Pompeius two consulary men, and his deadly professed enemies, to accompany
him; the other from a Consul attaining to be a governor in Gallia, Caius
Carbo whose Father he had condemned came thither to pry into his actions, who
was so far from removing him, that he assigned him the office of a Tribune, and
for no other cause, but that he might assist him with his Counsel and Advice.
These are famous examples, but they relish not with them that desire to have
all Dominion in their own power, howsoever they are insallible signs of
innocence, and without peril and danger.

Again I would advise the servant of a Prince to stand firm and constant unto
him in his allegiance to the end, and not for future hopes to adore the rising
Sun, and to decline the service of his present Sovereign: for as such a man
deserves punishment of his Prince, so the memory of him is hateful to his
successor, and upon the first occasion rhat is given he is ruinated; so it
sell out with Joab, who after that he had followed King David for a long time,
and performed all the duties of a faithful servant unto him, at length in his
old age he neglected him, and followed Adonijah that was to succeed him in the
Kingdom; so Macro forsook Tiberius while he lived, and applied himself to
Caius Caesar, which Tiberius perceiving, in some indignation told him how he
looked after the rising, and neglected the declining Emperor; so Tigellinus
that was most near and dear unto Nero at the first, at last fell of, and
became a Traitor unto him: but all of them received the deserved wages of
perfidious temporisers by the succeeding Princes, and were put to death as we
have before heard.

Above all things I would have the servant of a Prince take into consideration
the uncertainty of all humane things: but more especially the instability and
slippery estate of such as have attained to any great fortune, and in time seek
to prevent imminent dangers, or at least how they may undergo them without
vexation if they befall them; which how they may bring to pass many have read
excellent lessons unto us, but especially Seneca: they says he, whom Fortune
has set in slippery places, shall be more secure, 101 Super^ia^ fugiat.
101 if they banish pride and arrorogancy out of their thoughts, being incident
to great fortunes, and carry themselves as if they were private men; indeed
many that are on high must of necessity stick unto their places, for that they
cannot come down but they must fall; yet let them deserve this Testimony, that
it is their grief that they must be grievious unto others, and that they did
not intrude themselves but were placed there; let them arm themselves with
justice, mild and gentle behavior, and with liberality, that so they may
stand safe and secure.

Again, it will be very advantageous unto them if they know and believe what is
said in Titus Livius, that it is the part of a wise man, nay more, of a
fortunate man, to add bounds to his prosperity, and not to rely too much upon
the present times, or fortunes favors; for then is she most to be suspected
when she smiles most upon us; of this Sirach gives us a caveat in his first
Chapter; humble thy self that thou may not fall, and bring shame to thy
soul; and likewise Seneca; as when we are at Sea in a storm we desire the
Haven, so should we desire to ease our selves of the burden of our fortunes,
and not stay until we are eased of them. This Seneca himself would have
done, when after the death of Burrhus he saw his friends fail him, and his
enemies accuse him; therefore in that elegant Oration of his, which is extant
in Tacitus, in which he amongst other things acknowledges, that there was
nothing wanting to his felicity but that he could not contain himself, and
add bounds to his felicity; as being weary, says he, on the way by long
travells, I would desire rest; so being grown old, and not able to manage my
estate, and undergo these cares that attend it, I dedesire that you would take
it into your tuition, and command your Proctours, that they would have a care
of it for your benefit, and give me leave to spend the remainder of my days
in the Country with such allowance as will keep me from want; but Nero not
contented with this, cunningly dissembled his hatred in flattering terms;
Seneca gave him thanks, and began to change his former course of life,
forbidding any to come to visit him, but his followers; seldom came into the
City, kept his house, as if he had been sick, or a student in some faculty;
and when he saw he grew deboist, and to give himself to all kind of
wickedness, that he might be out of the reach of his envy, he desired his
leave that he might live far remote in the Country; which being denied, he
feined himself sick, and never came out of his Chamber; but how came it to
pass, that doing as he did, he did not avoid the displeasure of the Tyrant?
and may not the remedy now prescribed be said to be no remedy by the Example
of Seneca? truly I will not say any thing that may derogate from the
understanding of so wise a man, yet I must say what I think, that Seneca,
either 102 Tardius hoc usus est.
used the remedy too late, when Nero's anger was much incensed against him, or
that he took not so fit a time as he should have done, to move Nero in it; or
rather which I do most incline unto, that what was done may rather be imputed
to his beastly cruelty, from which the most innocent man in the world cannot be
safe, and against which no remedy may be prescribed; therefore as we cannot
find many Princes of the world like unto Nero, so by his Example the remedy
before prescibed is not to be neglected, or condemned; but do thou as Sylla
the dictator did, as Dioclesian, and Charles the fifth, and many other Noble
Princes of the World have done; who of their own accord, without any such cause
moving thereunto, in the declining times of their ages, laid down their
Scepters, and retired themselves. Do thou I say provide for thine own safety,
add bounds to thy prosperity, and expect not fortunes coming to ease thee of
thy burden. Historians affirm that Polycrates a Tyrant of the Samnites lived
happily, and enjoyed his honors and preferments without any manner of cross
all his life time; but Amasis King of Egypt did fear the end of him; for he
was of opinion, that where there is no intercourse, or change of fortune in the
whole course of life, that the end will be fatal; therefore his advice was,
that if a man has had no crosses all his lifetime, that he would afflict
himself, and depart from that thing which he most affects. This Counsel I
would give unto them that are in power and authority, that they would
voluntarily ease themselves of that burden; It is harsh I know, but yet it is
good and wholesome Counsel, and not to be neglected; and why? do we not see
that death is advantageous to many, whom she takes away in the midst of their
prosperity; for had they lived they might have survived their happiness;
wherefore Seneca advises, that they that are most fortunate, in the very
height of their fortunes should desire to dye, because there is nothing
certain in this World, but that what is past. And Lucan speaks thus, of
^neius Pompey, that 103 Destruit ingentes animos longius aevum.
103 long life is a dishonor to a man, when he survives his honor; and
Juvenal speaks of him and Ca. Marius; who had been ever more famous then
Marius, if he had died at Rome in the midst of his Army, when he returned out
of Germany? or then Pompey, if he had died of the fever which took him in
Campania? Titus Livius reports of Alexander, that he was happy in this, that
he dyed in the spring of his age in the height of his prosperity, before he
had tasted of both fortunes; on the other side says he, to omit many other
noble Princes Examples of humane frailty, what was it that gave occasion and
opportunity to fortune to work upon Cyrus that was so famous among the
Graecians, as also upon Pompey, but only long life? 104 Quod mors invito hoc
tu sponte fac
104 that cure therefore which death may do to thee against thy will, do thou
to thy self willingly, and without doubt it will administer solace and comfort
unto thee. These are almost all the means by which those that are powerful
with their Princes, may avoid the change of fortune, and descend without a
fall: yet to these in their own wisdoms and discretions, as they see the
state of the present times, they may add many more; some there are that think
themselves secure enough by reason of the sacred order they are entered into, as
Sleidan reports of G. Poyets Chancellor of France; others by reason of their
allies and kindred, as is reported of Duke Lerma in Spain; but unless their
supportors be better then these, as the Examples before do sufficiently
manifest unto us, they cannot stand; but do not thou my friend look so much
after these things, as that sovereign Antidote of the Christain Poet; he is a
happy man, says he, and most like a Saint, that relies not upon the fading
glory of the World, that delights not in pomp and pride, that lives in the
Country contented with a mean habit and estate without cares or fears, that
is secure which way soever the Scepter falls; that never fears the direful
menaces of the Planets, nor the prodigious prognostications of the Comets, or
that relies upon the frail and fickle favor of greatness, or is ever
distracted with ambitious thoughts; wherefore ^eneca wisely, beware of
ambition, for it is vain and windy, and never satisfied, nay, it is of so
troublesome a nature, that it will neither endure any one to go before it, nor
yet to com^ after it; it is ever attended with a double fear within and
without; for as it hates all men, so it is hated of all men, and therefore most
miserable; do thou not see how the houses of such as are powerful are
annoied with the brawlings and quarrellings of such as meet therein? 105 Multum

105 thou can not come into them withou reproach, nor stay there without
greater; and if thou chance to pass up the stayrs, they are so slippery that
thou can not stand there without danger of falling; wherefore apply thy self
unto wisdom, which will not only afford thee rest and tranquillity, but
riches in abundance; all the honors and preferments in the World, though they
are small, in respect of other things, yet they are hard to come by, and the
way unto them is tedious, and troublesome; and if fortune so favor thee, that
thou do attain to ^he top of them, thou shall see all those ways that did
seem unto thee when thou was below to be mountainous and steepie, to be
plain and easy, and that through that plain thou did ascend to that height.

Illustrations and Observations upon EVENKELIUS.
By Tho: Nash.
1. Joab fuit in utraque fortuna Davidis individuus diu comes.

Joab for a long time was in both fortunes David's only minion.

IOab was King David's Lieutenant-Generall in all his Wars, Jos. c. 7. de aut.
l. 6. yet Joab was not reckoned amongst King David's Worthies. David had
triginta fortes, tres fortiores, et tres fortissimos; thirty valiant men, three
more valiant then the thirty, and three more valiant then any of the thirty
three; in all he had thirty six Worthies, amongst whom, I say, Ioab was not
numbered, quia indignus haberetur ob mortem Abner and Amasae because he was
thought unworthy of the name of a Worthy, by reason of the murder which he
committed upon Abner and Amasa.

*2. Ioab Rabbathae urbis Ammonaorum captae gloriam callide Davidi Regi suo
reservavit.

Ioab ascribed the honor of the taking of Rabbathae, a City of the Ammonites,
cunningly unto his King, Ios. l. 7. de ant. Iud. c. 7. 2 Samuel c. 12.29.

*3. Absalonem contra expressum regis mandatum confodit.

Ioab contrary to the Kings express command slew Absolon. Ios. lib. 7, de ant.
Iud. 2 Samuel c. 18.14.

*4. Ioab Abnerem ducem Israelitarum, et Amasam ducem Iudaeorum occiderat.

Ioab slew Abner a Captain of the Israelites, and Amasa a Captain of the
Jews.

Abner was the General of Saul's Army, as Ioab was of David's, and was beloved
of the people, who for that he was reproved by Isbosheth for the keeping of
Rispa Saul's Concubine, revolted from him to King David, and used his best
endeavor to settle the Crown upon him; but Ioab fearing that if he should
come in favor with the King, his greatness would be eclipsed, buzzed into the
Kings ears, that what he did was in Policy, and that when he had his end, he
would revolt unto King Saul; and seeing he could not divert the affections of
the King from him, most treacherously under color of parle ran his sword
through him, and slew him. Ios. lib. 7. de ant. Iud. c. 11.

Amasa was a General whom Ioab slew, for no other cause, but because the King
had given the same power unto him, as he had done unto Ioab. Ios. lib. 7. de
ant. Iud. c. 10.

*5. Ioab Adoniam patre vivente regnum invadentem aperte juvat.

Ioab treacherously assisted Adonijah against the King.

Adonijah was the son of King David by his Wife Agge; for David had six
sons before the birth of Solomon, by six several women, Ammon by Achymas,
Daniel by Abigal, Absolon by Machima, Adonijah by Agge, and Gerthesa and Gala
by others: the chief men that did adhere unto Adonijah were Ioab, and Abiathar
the high Priest: the chief men that did oppose him, were Zadock the Priest,
Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the Captain of the Guard. Ios. lib. 7. de ant.
Iud. c. 11.

*6. Ioab jussu Davidis a Solomone ad ipsam aram interemptus est.

Ioab by the Kings command, by Solomon was put to death before the Altar.

Among other things King David gave this in charge unto Solomon at his death;
remember the iniquity of Ioab who through aemulation slew two good Generals,
Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Iethram. Ios. l. 7. c. 11.

*7. Haman totam gentem Iudaeorum propter unius Mardochaei odium excindere
parabat.

Haman for the hatred which he bore unto Mardochee, would have sacrificed the
whole Nation of the Jews.

In the days of Cyrus by the Graecians called Artaxerxes the whole Nation of
the Jews were in danger to be extirpated; for Haman being in favor with the
King obtained a decree, that all the Jews together with their Wives, on such a
day should be put to death, and for no other reason but because Mardechee the
Queens Uncle would not adore him as the Persians did; yet many other things
were buzzed into the Kings ears against the Jews, as that they were a
rebellious people, of corrupt manners, and enemies to all goodness; of which
decree Mardochee being given to understand, betook himself to fasting and
prayer: and it pleased God so to work upon the affection of the King, the
Queen mediating for the Jews, that the punishment intended to Mardochee was
inflicted upon Haman. Jos. lib. 11. de Ant. Iud.

*8. Tiberium illum tam superbum, tam vinolentum, tam crudelem Imperatorem.

That proud licentious and cruel Emperor.

It it is reported by Tac. l. 6. Annal.
Tacitus that the saying of Passienus the Orator went current of Tiberius:
neque meliorem unquam servum, neque deteriorem unquam dominum fuisse, that
there was never a better servant, nor a worse master then Tiberius; egregie
vixit privatus and insons, whilst he was a private man, yea and in the
beginning of his reign he carried himself Sue. in Tib. c. 27. Dion Cas. lib.
57 Tac. Annal. lib. 1.
very moderately; vetat Templa sibi erigi, erigique sibi statuam; multa
praeclara gessit de vest serica non utenda: de vasis aureis non adhibendis
nisi in sacris; he prohibited Temples to be dedicated to him, and his Statues
to be erected: he regulated the excess of superfluous apparel, and commanded
that vessels of gold should not be used, but only in the Temples; mox ubi
regna petivit totas vitiis laxavit habenas, but when he got the reins of the
Empire into his hands, Tac. lib. 6. Annal.
there was no vice that he was free from, cruel he was in a most barbarous
manner; omnis sexus, omnis aetas, illustres and ignobiles dispersi and
aggregati, Ille nec aetati tenerae nec parcit anili.
every sex, age, and degree, men and women, old and young, bond and free,
noble and ignoble tasted of his cruelty; and given to Wine he was in excess,
insomuch that instead of Suet. in Tiber.
Tiberius he was called Biberius, and of Nero Mero; certare peculis and
hilarescere vino erat illi quotidianum, it was a familiar thing with him to
spend two or three days together in Polyphagia and polypotia in gluttony and
drunknesse. Cum Pomponio Flocco and L. Pisone noctem biduumque epulando
potandoque consumpsit, jucundissimos omnium horarum amicos hos esse affirmans
with Floccus and Pyso he spent two whole days and a night in drinking,
affirming they were the best companions that ever he met withal. Historians
report, that his nurse was a great drinker of Wine, and that she ordinarily
whilst he was in his tender years fed him with sops dipped in wine; whence it
came to pass that when he came to full growth, he delighted in nothing more
then debosching and gurmondizing; the Italian says, that it is a rule
infallible, che de latte che poppianio nella infantia dependata tutta la salute
della vita nostra, that of the milk that we suck in whilst we are in our
cradles, depends our health and welfare all our life time; if that be
unwholesome, our bodies will be crasie and subject to diseases; and the reason
is because quod nova testa capit, inveterata sapit, the vessel will ever
relish of the liquour with which it is first seasoned. Titus the son of the
good Emperor Vespasian had all his life time a weak and crasy body, and no
other reason is given, che per haver poppato nella infantia latte di balla mal
sana; but because in his tender years he was nursed by a woman that was not
sound. The cruelty of Caligula is not imputed to Germanicus that begot him, or
to his Mother that brought him forth, but to the nurse that gave him suck, of
whom Dion says, that she had hair on her breasts, as thick as men have on
their beards. So likewise the inhumanity of Pyrrhus is imputed to a Tigre, of
whom Homer says that he was borne in Greece, bred up in Arcadia, and nursed by
a tigre, Durius had a daughter whose nurse fed upon nothing but venomous
things: whence it came to pass, che a capo di tree anni quando la fauciulla fu
dispoppata non mangiava se non animali venenosi, as soon as she was weaned,
she would digest an adder or serpent as familiarly as another would do the
brawn of a capon. Paleologus Emperor of Constantinople was so much troubled
with melancholy that for three parts of the year he was in a manner frantic;
for he that is in a deep melancholy, differs little from a mad man, as the
word signifies, being derived a (...) insanio: and this is attributed to his
nurse that did abound with that humor, of whom this tale passes, that the
empress meeting with an old woman discovered unto her her husbands infirmity,
who did advise her to chide him, and to fall foul upon him twice every week at
the least, because he that lulls a melancholy man asleep with music, does but
foster the humor; whose counseil the Empress taking into consideration, non
solo due volte di septimana (as my Author says,) may quattro volie il giorno
il dava qualche dispiacere, not only twice a week but four times a day vexed
and perplexed him, and in the end with her bitter potion cured him; thus the
nurse oftentimes causes the child to degenerate from the nature and
disposition of his Parents; whereof both the Romans and the Graecians taking
special notice in the days of old, used their best endeavors to regulate the
abuses in this kind. M. Portius that was so famous amongst the Romans, in a
speech which he made in the Senate house, bitterly enveighs against the
Senators for suffering their children to be delivered into the hands of
strangers, saying, O padri conscriti mi paere gran monstruosita vedere huomini
havere falconi nelle mane e vedere le do^ne creare caguolini nelle bracchie
l^asciando stare i propr^i figlivoli nelle altrui braccie; it seems to me a
monstrous thing in nature to see men carry hawks on their hands, and women dogs
between their arms, and to see them deliver over their children into the
hands and arms of others, crudeles certe parents they are cruel fathers and
mothers that mue up their hawks, and keep their dogs in their houses for their
delight, and cast their children out of the doors, whom they are bound by the
law of God and nature to keep at home; non pate l'honore, non lo promitte la
conscienza, non concedde la leg divina ne humana che Coloro che Jddio ha
fatta padri e madre di huomini divengono balie di falconi e cani (as says my
Author in some bitterness;) it is not allowed in point of honor, in point of
conscience, or by the laws of God or men, that they whom God has made the
fathers and mothers of children, should make themselves the nurses of hawks and
dogs; if we have a jewel which we do value, we will not willingly deliver
it out of our hands, and if we do, it shall be into the hands of such whom
we dare trust as boldly as ourselves; now what jewel can be compared to the
flesh of our flesh, and to the bone of our bone? and how careful ought we to
be into whose hands we commend them? not without cause therefore Plato gave in
charge to the Graecians, and Lycurgus to the Lacedaemonians, that every woman of
low degree should nurse all her children, and every woman of quality her first
begotten. Ortomistus the sixth King of the Lacedaemonians lest two sons behind
him at the time of his death, the youngest of which inherited his Possessions,
and for no other reason but because he was nursed by his mother, and his elder
brother by a stranger; whence arose a custom throughout all Asia, che il
figlivolo che non pappana il latte della madre non hereditassero la robba della
padre, that the son that sucked not the milk of his mother should not inherit
the Possessions of his father, giamai fu madre simile di delicatezza ne may
sara alla madre del redemtore nostro as my Author says. There was never so
delicate a creature in the world, nor ever will be, as was the Mother of our
Savior, who by her own example has taught us, that there is nothing more
natural then for a Mother to afford milk out of her own breasts to the issue
engendered of her own bowels: the naturalists send us to the Sow to school,
who though she bring forth many, yet nurseth them all; if children then
sometimes neglect their Parents in their age, it is no wonder, being they were
so careless of them in their minority. When the bastard brother of the two
famous Gracchi returned home from the Wars, he brought with him two girdles,
the one of gold, the other of silver; the golden girdle he gave to his nurse,
the silver one to his Mother: with which his Mother being offended, he spoke
thus unto her. Mother, marvel not at it, percioche tu mi portasti Solamente
nel ventre nove mese; e ella mi nutrico nella suo petto tree anni, e quando
esecudo io piccolo tu mi cacciasti da tuo occho, ella mi raccolse nella sue
braccie; because that you bare me but nine months in your belly, and she has
fed me three years with her breasts, and when you cast me from your eyes she
embraced me in her arms. Cornelius Scipio after his return home from the
Wars between him and Antiochus, condemned to dye two valiant Gentlemen nobly
descended, for that they had unadvisedly spoiled the Temple of the Vestall
Virgins, to whom his brother Scipio Africanus became an earnest suitor for
their pardon, but could not by any means prevail, whereupon they made use of
another, that was to Cornelius a foster-Sister, the Daughter of his Nurse, who
presently obtained their release, which Scipio taking to heart, Cornelius spoke
thus unto him; Sappi frtaello, che io reputa piui per madre colei che mi nutrie
non mi partori che colei che mi partori e poi mi abandono; know thou my Brother
that I think her rather to be my Mother that nursed me, and did not bear me,
t en she that bare me and after cast me off; as a Child has no excuse for his
disobedience, so a Parent has none for his neglect of him. Upon a time there
arose a great controversy betwee a Father and a Son, which was referred to
Solon to determine, before whom both parties appearing, the Son complained
that his Father had done him much wrong, in disinheriting him, being his only
Son; the Father answered, that he had done him none, for that he had not
only been a disobedient Child, but a cruel Enemy, opposing him in every
thing which he undertook, which gave him just occasion to deprive him of his
inheritance, and often to beg at the hands of God to cut off the thread of his
life, for that he thought him unworthy to breath upon the face of the earth,
that showed himself so disobedient to his Father, and told some that stood up
in his defense, that if they did but know how dear the love of a Father is to
his Son, they would rat^er compassionate the Fathers case, then the Sons,
because there is no Father in the World so cruel and hard-hearted, but will
sheath his sword up to the hilt in his own heart, before he will strike his
Son with the hilt of it; to wit, that is not more grieved that his Son
should give him an occasion to disinherite him, then his Son is with the loss
of his inheritance: the Son then replying, acknowledged his disobedience, and
wanton course of life, but imputed the cause thereof unto his Father; for that
when he was of tender years he cast him out of doors, and delivered him
into the hands of strangers, from whose breasts he sucked in the seeds of
disobedience and folly: Solon having heard both parties, delivered this
sentence, that the Father for that he had cast his Son out of doors as
soon as he came into the World, should be debarred of the rites of funeral,
and so dye without honor; that the Son for his disobedience should be
disinherited during his life, and that the Grandchild, in whom there was no
fault, after the death of his Grandfather should inherit the possessions,
because it would be injustice to disinherite the Son for the Fathers offense;
so the Grandfather was punished after his death, and the Son whilst he lived:
thus have I taken a liberty (occasioned by reason of the Nurse of Tiberius) to
condemn that liberty which parents assume, to turn their Children out of
doors as soon as they are borne, being a thing unnatural, and not used
amongst the brute Creatures. Suetonius has one remarkable passage of Tiberius;
upon a time Tiberius invited himself to an old fornicators house to supper,
whom Augustus had put to some shame and ignominy, and whom he himself not long
before had distasted upon this condition, ut nudis puellis ministrantibus
caenaretur, that the Symposiarchus who was the Steward of the Feast should
especially provide that he might be attended with some handsome young Wenches,
clad in no other habit then that wherewith Nature had first invested them.

Observations upon the changing of Tiberius his manners and honors.
There are four good Mothers that bring forth four abortive daughters; truth
hatred, security danger, familiarity contempt, and prosperity pride; the Priest
until he became a Cardinal was courteous and loving unto all, but being
advanced he forgate his old friend Michael, Stat foris ante fores Michael
dicens quod honores
Commutant mores, raro tamen in meliores.


So long as Alexanders horse was clad with his ordinary accouterment and
caparison, he would admit of any man to come upon his back, and to ride him;
at structus regiis phaleris neminem praeter regem admitteret, but when he had
the Saddle on which the King did usually ride on his back, then he would admit
of no man but the King; divitiae and honores (inquit Erasmus) peccandi quandam
necessitudinem secum ad ferunt; nam sicut difficile est colubrum in sinu alere,
and non morderi, ita difficillimum honoribus and divitiis abundantem vitiis non
contaminari, riches and honors do in a manner enforce a man (as Erasmus
says) to transgress; for as it is a hard thing for a man to carry a snake in
his bosom and not be stung* so it is more hard to abound in wealth and honor,
and not to abound in sin and transgression; the good fortune of many a man is
his utter ruin and destruction; for if it be not guided with reason and
discretion, it drives him as a tempest does a ship upon the sands of pride and
presumtion; but as a skillful horseman by his skill in riding will cover the
defects of his horse, so a wise man with his discretion will carry himself so
in both fortunes, that prosperity shall not make him proud, nor adversity sad.
Maude the Wife of King Henry the first is deservingly registered for the paragon
of her sex, because in both fortunes she was ever the same; prospera non
laetam fecere, nec aspera trisio^; Aspera risus ei, prospera terror erant:
prosperity never made her proud, or adversity sad, the one she scorned, the
other she feared, as Henry of Huntington has it in his seventh book. Cato
among all the noble Romans is preferred for his settled constancy. Senec. 104.
Nemo (inquit Seneca.) mutatum Catonem toties mutata republica unquam vidit;
eundem se in omni statu praestitit, in praetura, in repulsu, in co^ciou^, in
exercitu, in morte, cum alij ad Caesarem, alij ad Pompeium inclinabant, solus
Cato fecit reip. parts; no man ever saw Cato dismayed in the most troublesome
times of the Roman state, he was the same man in exile, as he was when he
was praetor, in the Army, as when he was giving the charge in the Senate house,
at his death, as at other times. Semper eadem was a Motto well beseeming a most
worthy princess; and semper^talis, talis erat ludeus epigrammata, talis seria
scribens, talis consiliarius, talis cancellarius, was a worthy Encomium of a
great officer of this Kingdom in the days of King Henry the Eight; and if
Tiberius had deserved the like, he could not have wanted an Encomiastick to
have given it him; but being he changed his manners with his honors, he is
regestred for a child of inconstancy, a changling, and the off spring of
immoderate desires.

*9 Cohortibus praetoriis praefectus, He being chief Commander of the
Praetorian Company. This office was sometimes executed by military men. Seius
Strabo held the same under Augustus, and Sejanus under Tiberius; but (as Bodin
in the third book of his Commonwealth observes) quia nemo nisi qui legum and
juris peritissimus erat, fungi poterat hoc munere; Imperatores pro ducibus
legionum, jurisconsultos provexerant; so as under Otho, Martian; under Severus,
Papinean; and under Alexander, Vlpian held the same, whose Commission was so
large that all men might appeal unto them, no man from them. In the days of
Romulus, (as Alciate observes,) they had not only a superintendency over the
Soldiers that guarded the Emperors Person and Palace, but also over them that
defended the Empire against his enemies; but when the Empire began to spread it
self, this Office was divided: there was praefectus militum, and praefestus
vigilum: the one was superintendent over the guard that attended the Emperor,
the other over the Soldiers that went against his enemies; so long as the
blood of the Emperors of Germany continued in the line of the Kings of France,
the Kings of France had the like Office; whom they called the Major of the
Kings Palace, or Master of the Kings house.

*10. Inrepere caepit militares animos adeundo, appellando.

Sejanus by calling them by their names won their hearts.

Affabilitas and comitas sunt nullius impendii, amicitias tamen magnas
conglutinant exhibitae, dissolvunt praetermissae, good words and kind and
courteous salutations cost little, but prevail much; whereas on the otherside
uncivil speeches, and rude rustic behavior draws much envy; affability is
a precious gemm when it is set in gold and silver, but in tinn and copper vile
and contemptible; in Titus it did appear like the Sun at the highest, but in
Sejanus like the Moon in the Eclipse; in virtuous and noble dispositions it is
a principal ornament, and gives a great luster unto them; but in evil
disposed persons it is of no better account then a ring of gold in a swines
snout, mere hypocrisy to dazzle the eyes of the simple, and to effect some
mischievous design; of Sejanus his affability, vid. Taci. l. 4. initio.

*11. Per theatra effigies ejus inter Principes legionum coli statuit.

He commanded his statues to be honored among the statues of the Princes.

Cum multos alios (inquit Dion) post mortem statui^ and publico funere
cohonestasset Tiberius, Sejani vivi statuam in theatro posuit; Dion l. 7.
it was accounted a special favor for the Emperor to allow of any man's
statue to be erected after his death, but to admit of the statue of a Subject
in his life time to be erected in the Theater among the statues of the
Emperors, was such an honor as before that time was not heard of to be allowed
to any Subject.

*12. Vitam procul Roma amaenis locis ducere persuasit.

Sejanus prevayled with Tiberius to leave Rome.

Tacitus in the fourth book of his Annals doubts, whether Sejanus were the
cause that Tiberius betook himself to Capreae, because that Caede ejus patrata
sex annos pari secreto convixit, after the death of Sejanus he continued there
six years; some are of opinion that he went thither to hide his deformity,
for being grown in years, praegracilis and incurva proceritas, nudus capillo
vertex, and ulcerosa facies, he had a lean body, a bald pate, and a malmsy
nose; but certain it is that he went thither to color and cover his
licentious course of life.

Observations upon Tiberius retyring himself in his old age to Capreas.
If Tiberius in the flourishing time of his age when his blood boiled hot
within him, had betaken himself to Capreas to keep correspondency with his
Concubines, he mighe have pleaded to extenuate his offense, his age, his
indiscretion, and how he was misled by evil Council; sed turpe senilis amor,
but being that he retired himself in his declining time, when age had furrowed
his forehead, and pulled the teeth out of his head, and when as his judgment
should have overruled his affections, he can plead no such plea; Again if
Tiberius had been a private man, he might have hoped his exorbitancies might
have died with him as to the World, and so his honor saved amongst the people;
but being a Prince cujus facta dictaque omnia etiam in loco areano veluti in
aedium culmine populo exposita sunt, whose thoughts are scant free unto
himself, and whose actions are rules and precepts to the multitude, he can
expect no such thing; Gnats are unnoted wheresoever they fly, but Eagles are
gazed upon with every eye; again if Tiberius had betaken himself to Capreas,
there to have sacrificed the remainder of his days in an humble confession and
hearty contrition, for his misspent youth, he might have deserved with
Maximinian and Dioclesian, and diverse other Noble Princes, who in their
declining times abandoned the world, to have had his History written with a pen
of iron to his eternal praise and commendation, and have had his place in the
Catalogue among the renowned Princes of the world; but being that he went
thither to cover his cruelty, and his lasciviousness, and made Religion a
Cloak for the same, pretending that he went to build a Temple at Capreas to
Jupiter, and at Nola to Augustus, he is deservedly branded for an ignominious
Prince to all succeeding ages; of his going to Capreas, vid. Tacit. lib. 4.
Annal. and how he behaved himself, vid. Suet. in Tiber.

*13. Convivium celebratur in Villa quae vocatur Spelunca.

Tiberius was feasted in a house called Spelunca.

According to Varro, there is Villa Rustica, and Villa Vrbana; Villa Rustica is
the house of a farmor appertaining to a manor. Villa Vrbana is the
mannor-house it self; and it is so called, because it is furnished and
accommodated like unto a house in the City, which is sometimes called
praetorium, the Country house of a Praetor, or a Princes Palace in the Country:
Suetonius terms this house where Tiberius was feasted praetorium, which kind
of houses the better sort in Rome did keep to recreate and retire themselves
upon all occasions: Lips. will have it to be called Spelunca, from a cave, quia
adjuncta Speluncae. vid. Lips. in lib. 4. Ann. Tac. and Suet. in Tiber.

*14. Nuptias petere audebat a Livia. Sejanus presumed to make love unto Livia
the Wife of Drusus.

Tacitus observes that Sejanus became a suitor unto Livia, not so much for the
love which he bore unto her, as the hatred unto Drusus; for Sejanus and Drusus
falling at variance, after some blows had past between them, Sejanus casts
about how he might ease himself of this man that stood in his way, and for
that purpose makes love unto Livia, obtaines his unchaste desires, and by
putting her in hope of being a Princess, persuades her to consent to the death
of her husband; a design is thought upon; Ligdus the Eunuke is made the
instrument, Drusus is poisoned. vid, Tacit. lib. 4. Annal.

*15. Occidentem ab illo deseri, orientem spectare exprobravit.

Tiberius upbraided Macro for abandoning the setting, and adoring the rising
Sun.

Hopeful plants have ever been cherished, and it is necessary they should ever
be for the benefit of posterity; it is verified in vegetative, in sensitive,
and reasonable creatures; we cherish the plant of a fruitful vine, because in
time it may yield nourishment to the body, and delight the palate; a colt of a
good race, because it may prove like the sire to do us service; the issue of a
noble family whose ancesters have triumphed in victory, and have been honored
for the good service done to their Countries; and if Macro in his affections
had followed Caligula in the second place, no man would or could have condemned
him; but for Macro to leave a bird in hand for a bird in the bush, a possession
for a possibility, was not only extreme folly, but extreme disloyalty; admit
Tiberius had his imperfections in a high degree, and justly deserved
reprehension; yet it had been Macro's duty, if he could not have reclamed him,
as far forth as in him lay, to have smothered them: but instead thereof to
conspire against him, was a villainy inexcusable, and such in the end do ever
receive the wages that is due unto them; for Princes are ever jealous of them,
knowing that upon all occasions they will be ready to revolt; and therefore in
the end requite them, as Alexander did Bessus, Vitellius Tigellinus, Caesar
Herodotus and Achillas, Caligula Macro. How Tiberius upbraided Macro for
adoring the rising, and turning his back to the setting Sunn, vid. Tacit. l. 6.
Annal.

*16. Narcissum dominum domini appellat.

Narcissus the master of his master.

(...), says Xenophon, there is nothing so requisite and necessary for the
continuance of humane society, as decency and order; for as it is in the
Caelesticall bodies, so it is in the Terrestiall; as in the natural, so in the
public body: rule and order is the cause of subsistence in all. In Heaven
there is an Hierarchy, Angels and Archangels, one Star differs from another
in greatness and glory, one Planet from another, each has his proper place;
the Sun was made to rule the day, and the Moon the night; in the sublunary
world the Elements have their proper stations; the place of the Earth is the
Center, of the Water to be next unto it, of the Air to it, and of the Fire to
it; and so long as they keep their stations, there is peace and tranquillity
below; but when the Air shall disorderly descend into the cranyes of the
Earth, it causes an Ague there; and when the earthy vapors shall ascend up to
the Skies, it causes a combustion there; and as it is in those natural
bodies, so it is in the politic; each man has his proper calling, one man is
called to one calling, another to another, one to be a Master, another to be a
Servant, and fo long as each member confineth himself to his proper calling,
so long the Commonwealth prospers; but when Claudius shall become servus
Narcissi, and Narcissus dominus Claudij, then the Commonwealth is out of order.
What power Narcissus and Pallas had with Claudius, vid. Suet. in Claud. and
Tac. l. 3. Annal.

*17. Infamem vitam foedavit infami exitu.

Tigellinus ended his ignominious life with as ignominious a death.

(...), Matthew. 7.
sed ut sementem feceris ita and metes, we gather not grapes of thorns, or
figs of thistles, but as we sow, so we reap; if in the spring we sow
virtue, we shall be sure at harvest to reap the fruits thereof: if
licentiousness and voluptuousness, we shall be sure likewise to reap the
fruits thereof; the spri g of our age is our youth, which being not well
husbanded will bring forth nothing but brambles and briars, vain and idle
imaginations, and crasy and decrepite bodies in our declining times; for it is
a rule infallible, quod libidinosa and intemperans adolescentia effoetum corpus
tradit senectuti, if we then poison our selves with carousing and drinking,
we can expect no other fruits then gouts and dropsies in our old age; if with
voluptuous, wanton and unchaste desires, nothing but boyles and ulcers, the
French disease, or the disease of Naples; for as fevers which break forth in
the spring, in the Summer and in the autumn, when Phoebus has mounted
himself on high, are engendered in the winter; Indomitae quae sunt delicta
juventae, Non ea cu^ fi^nt saecula saepe^ ^gravant: At collecta diu, cum lit
minus apta senectus s^a pati, canos sollicitare solent.
so the poison that breaks forth in our age is sucked in in our youth; for
though the strength of nature may suppress and keep under the malignant
quality for a time, yet when nature begins to fail in us, then does it insult
and show it self in botches and boyles, in gouts and dropsies, the deserve
dwages of wantonness and luxury; wherefore Seneca wisely, Senec. Ep. 51.
ante senectutem curavi ut been viverem, my chiefest care was, how to spend my
youth well; for youth is like to an untamed colt, which being not well broken
will be sure to put some jadish tricks upon the rider; and like unto a field
the more fertile the more unprofitable if it be not manured; nam ut terra
(says the Orator) quo melior est magis corrumpitur si negligatur, ita ingenia
quo faliciora in juventute, majoribus vitiis obducuntur in senectute, nisi
recte excolantur: so as it is a true rule qualis vita finis ita, as our youth
is so is our age; as we live so we dye; nam studiae adolescenciae tanquam in
herbis ostendunt quantae fruges in senectute sunt futurae, a virtuous youth
ever produces a reverend old age, and a quiet and peaceable death: a wanton
youth, a contemptible old age, and an ignominious and distracted death.
Tigellinus lived lewdly and dyed ignominiously, he ended his ignominious life
with as ignominious a death. Of Tigeilinus his life and death, see Tac. lib. 1.
Hist* of his lewd qualities, and how he wound himself into Neros favor, see
more in Tac. l. 14. Annal.

*18. Asiaticum in favorem cepit.

Vitellius took into his favor one Asiaticus.

(...) as it is in the Proverb, birds of a feather will flock together, one
Rook will find out another; Asiaticus was (as Tacitus terms him) mancipium
foedum, lerna sentinaque vitiorum, nam omnia prorsus ut in quandam canosam
latrinam in animum suum conflux ere vitiae, adeo ut ad caulam potius quam ad
aulam videretur natura produxisse; a very abject slave, the very sink of sin,
that had not one good condition, fitter to make a shepherd then a Courtier; it
is true (I find) that he had certain seeds and sparks of virtue in him: but
as the Courtiers of that time jested upon him, verisimile est in secreta
confessione imbibisse, nec fas erat apud alios proferre; nihil enim laud
dignum in illo invenimus, nisi quod in vaporario nemo vocalior, in praelio nemo
timidior; it seems he received them in confession, so as it was not lawful
for him to manifest them to the World: for that we can find nothing worthy of
praise in him, unless it were this, that no man would talk more in an
ale^house, or do less in the field; of him whilst he was a youth, Vitellius
made use to satisfy his bestiall appetite, but the boy being weary of that
course of life, runn from his master to Puteolus, where Vitellius finding him
amongst the hucksters selling of drink made with vinegar and water, laid him by
the heels, and sold him to a common fencer that went from market to market to
show his tricks; yet not long after got him again, made him his minion, and
primo imperii die (as says Suet.) made him a Knight, vid. Sueton in Vitel. and
Tac. l. 2. Hist.

*19. Polycletus and Patrobios aequabat.

No way inferior to the Polecleti and Patrobii, the most notorious villanes
amongst the Romans.

Polycletes was a notorious theife, depopulabatur and spoliabat quicquid
occurrebat, as says Dion, he spoiled whatsoever came in his way, he lived in
the days of Nero. vid. Dion Cas. l. 63. Patrobius was one of Neros freemen:
praefectus ludorum gladiatorum, the chief man amongst the hacksters and
fencers, who for the notorious villainies he committed in the days of Nero was
by Galba put to death. vid. Dion ibid.

*20. Nisi Perennis antea tractasset.

Commodus would not endure to hear of any thing, unless it had been first
told unto Perennis.

Qui statuit aliquid part inaudita altera, aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus
est, (says the heathen tragaedian in his Medaea) he that gives judgment
before he has heard both parties, though his judgment be just, yet he is
unjust; to hear well is a prime quality in a Prince; for by hearing all
parties, the truth comes to light; Alexander is commended in Plutar. in Alex.
Plutarch, for that he would never deliver his judgment before he had heard
all parties; gold is not discerned from Alchymy, but by the touch, or truth
from falsehood: judgment is the touchstone to try both, and hearing and seeing
are the lights by which it discerns; wherefore in those Commonwealths where
the general Counsels consist of three Estates, Monarchical, Aristocricall,
and Democricall, the Princes have ever been pleased to allow freedom of speech
to the Aristocricall and Democricall, reserving to themselves the power of
ratifying, or disallowing what they hear; and for that Commodus would not
endure to hear but by Perennis, he run himself upon a rock. vid. Lamprid.
Dion. Nic. and Herod. in Commodo.

*21. Persuasit Commodo ut deliciis vacret.

Perennis persuaded the Emperor to take his delights, and to leave the cares
of the Empire unto him.

It is incident to men of low degree to look upon great Persons with squint
eyes, especially upon such as are in most grace and favor with their Princes;
and if the Common Wealth flourish, they may perchance gain some honor and
reputation thereby; but if it do not, they are sure to bear the whole burden
of it. Dion Ca. lib. 72.
Milites quoties iis aliquid parum ex sententia eveniret, conjecta in Perennem
culpa graviter irascebantur; as often as any thing fell out among the soldiers
contrary to their expectation they were offended with Perennis, as if he had
been the only man that had been the cause thereof; Cum Comm odus cum tricentis
concubinis quas ex matronarum meretricum que delectu habuerat, trecentisque
aliis puberibus in palatio in convivio bacchabatur; when Commodus swilled
himself in pleasure with six hundred Concubines, Perenius must be the cause
of it, he persuaded him to take his pleasure and leave the cares of the Empire
unto him; cum Commodus sororem suam Lucillam compressisset, and postea occidit;
cum uni ex concubinis matris nomen imposuit and uxoris; cum deprehensam in
adulterio exegit, and exactam relegavit and occidit; when Commodus defloured
his Sister Lucilla, and after put her to death; when he familiarly called one
of his Concubines his mother and his wife, and after finding her to be false
unto him made her away, Perenius must still be the cause of all, he swayes
the Scepter, and puts to death whom he will. Perenius was guilty of many
crimes, I make no doubt; but whether he were guilty of all the crimes laid to
his charge, I make a great doubt.

*22. Prefecturas pro libitu vendit.

Cleander sold all Offices of Command.

Cleander (as Herodian observes) was a Phrygian by birth, being a Country of
that part of Asia that borders upon Bithynia, and became so gracious with
Commodus, that he had not only the command of him, but of the Soldiery and
the whole Empire; praetores a^ arbitrium Cleandr^ sunt retenti aut occi^; ad
cujus nutum etiam libertini in Senatum and patritios electi fuere; at his
disposal were all Praetorships, and places of honor; whom he affected were
chosen, and whom he distasted were kept back; and what became of him, vid.
Herod. l. 1. and Lamp. in Commodo.

*23. Convictus jussu Antonii. Plantianus being convicted, by the

Command of Antony was put to death.

The conviction was sudden; young Antony demands of him what he can say to
these two articles, venista ad Imperatorem minime accitus; deinde quid haec
lorica vult? quis ad coenam commessationemque armatus venit; Sir, you came to
the Emperor in an Evening before you were sent for, then you came armed to
him; do men use to come to the Emperors table armed? this was his charge, and
before he could give an answer, Anthony commands them that were present
strictis gladiis obtruncare, ut hostem manifestarium, who run their swords
through him, and after cast his body forth into the high way, ad vulgi
ludibrium vid. Herodia, lib. 3.

Observations upon the death of Plautianus.
It is observed by Bodin, that in a tyrannical government, the Princes Will is
a Law, stat pro ratione voluntas; Anthony commanded the people to kill
Plautianus, and they readily observed him; faciebant quod decebat, sed non
quomodo decebat, they paid him the wages that was due unto him, but not
according to the Law: in settled governments it favors of Barbarism to butcher
any man in times of Peace; wherefore Julian the Apostate, though a Tyrant in
other things, in this deserved commendation, that he would never condemn any
man before he had heard him what he could say for himself: Commines in his
fifth book (whom Lipsius commends for the most authentic writer) prefers the
government of England before the government of all the Kingdoms of the World.
We never hear in our coasts, for which we are bound to praise God, of any such
Barbarism; let the offender be never so great, or his offense so grievous; yet
he shall receive an honorable trial by men aequall to himself in every
degree, and receive his doom according to the Law.

*24. Authoritatem omnem momento adimit.

On a sudden Philip cast off Apelles.

^olib. ^.5. Histo.
Po ybius has one remarkable passage of Apelles, when he returned from
Challis, a City near unto Lesbos, of which he was governor to King Philips
Court, attended with a great train of the Nobility, thinking to have had
access to the King as he was used to have; janitor exspectare illum jussit,
dicens occupatum esse in praesentia regem; the Porter, was so bold as to tell
him, Sir you must stay, the King is busy; which when he heard to proceed from
the Porter, haesitabundus aliquando constitit moestus and inops consilii, stood
still, amazed for the time, as if he had been bereaft of his senses; his
followers forsaking him, as if they had never seen him or known him; after
which time (as says Polybius) ad Convivia aliquando, ad Consilia nunquam, he
came to Cour^ sometimes, but never sat in Council.

Observations upon the discarding of Apelles.
Natural est (inquit Iacobus nuper rex) ut populi simiarum more mores regis
imitentur; it is natural to the people to imitate their King in every thing,
what he affects they affect, and what he dislikes they dislike. Bodin has a
story of one of the Kings of France, who having received a wound in his head,
caused his hair to be cut short, and that immediately, omnes ordines capillos
de capite decuti curaverunt, men of all degrees wore short hair, whereas
before that time it was held a great dishonor in the French Court, for any man
of quality to wear short hair. Plutarch reports of Alexander the great, Plut.
in Alexand.
and Alphonsus King of Arragon, that being both of them wry-neckt, all their
Courtiers studied to imitate them; Regis ad Exemplu^ totus componitur orbis: If
Tiberius do distaste Sejanus, Silanus will esteem of him but as an exile and
forlorn man, and the common people will not honor him so much as to permit
him to fit amongst them; quot servi tot preditores, if Diana distaste Act^^on,
Et Dromus, and Canathe, Stricteque and Tigris and Alce dilacerant dominum falsi
sub imagine cervi, his own dogs will devour him; and if Philip of Macedon
casts off Apelles, the Porter that not long before would have thought it an
honor to him to have kissed the hem of his Garment, his Hand, his Toe, his etc.
will not stir his cap to him, but confront at the gate, and with a smiling
countenance in dirision tell him, he must stay, the King is busy; so are they
neglected whom the King neglects.

* 25 Nulla quies inest animo.

His thoughts being once possessed with a desire of sovereignty, he could never
rest contented.

Le chat qui vu fois a taste fromage, n' a jammais de repose qu'il n'ait
d'avantage, as the French have it; the Cat that once has had his nose in the
cream, will never rest till he come thither again; it is injust to usurp a
Kingdom, grievous to quit it again, he that once has been invested in the
Robes of Sovereignty, feasted, clad, attended, and lodged like an Emperor,
whose very looks and nods have been sufficient expressions of his mind to his
followers, will hardly ever endure to serve another, as he has been served;
the Child that has been clad from his childhood in auro and argento, and
holoseritis vestibus, in gold and silver, and fed with the costliest and
curious dishes, will hardly when he comes to man's estate ever be temperate, or
endure to wear decent and comely apparel (as Quintilian observes) it is
death unto greatness to descend ab equis ad asinos. Dionysius will tyrannise
over boys, when he cannot over men; and Caesar will rather be primus inter
ultimos, quam secundus inter primos, the first of the lowest rank, then the
second of the highest; for so says Plutarch of him: oppidulum in Alpibus
praetergrediens Caesar* mallem (inquit) apud hos primus esse quam Roma secundus.

* 26. Vxore illum praesertim instigante.

His Wife animating him thereunto.

The desire of sovereignty is a vanity which attends both sexes. The batchler
in King Arthurs Court being adjudged to die for deflowring a Virgin; having had
his pardon obtained by the Queen, was enjoined upon pain of death, that within
a year and a day he should inform her of the thing which all women most
desired; whereupon (as Chawcer says) he took his horse and rid far and
near, [but he ne couth arriven in no cost where he might find in this
mattiere two creatures according yfere, some said riches, some honors, some
jollines, some (to use his language) lust a bed, sometime often to be Widow and
wed, some to be flattered and ypraised, some to be accounted stable, and eke
secree] but meeting with an old wowan, she rounded him the ear and plainly
told him it was sovereignty, which being made known to the Queen at the end of
the year and day: There was neither Widow, Wife or Maid, that contraried what
he said; they all acknowledged it was place and precedencie which they most
affected. When the Ladies held a Council for the reformation of such abuses as
were crept into their Commonwealth; these grievances were opened, and a
reformation desired; First, they showed where in times past women were
distinquisht by their attire, the Noble from the Ignoble by habites rich and
plain, the married Wife and Widow from the Virgin by habites of gravity and
modesty; the case is now altered: it is a hard thing now to distinguish Ione
from my Lady, and the Noble from the Ignoble, or a Matron, Widow or Wife from a
Virgin; the Plebeians are grown to that height of pride, that they are not
ashamed to invest themselves in aureis, argenteis* florulentis, holosericis,
ungulatis and maeandratis vestibus, dum interim maritus domi consuat calceos,
in cloth of gold and silver, in silks, flowred, waved and imbroydered; whilst
in the mean time their husbands fit cobling of their shoos at home; sublatus
est pudor, adeo ut quidvis usurpet quaelibet, order which is the preserver of
honor is neglected, and the Plaebeians are grown lawless, and wear what
clothes they please. Again, they showed that in times past none were allowed
to have their Coaches adorned with silk and Ivory, but only Ladies and
Gentlewomen of quality; but now the Plaebeians and women of low degree presume
to have them so to the great wrong of the higher powers; nam si pilentis and
lecticis eboratis and bisso tectis vehuntur plabeiae, quid relictum est
Potentibus and Nobilibus? if a woman of low degree shall be permitted to have
her coach adorned with Silk and Ivory, what honor can it be to a Lady to have
it so? Again, they showed how that in times past none were allowed to have
their anteambulones and laterones, their Gentlemen-ushers, and yeomen, but
only women of quality; but now the woman of low degree will not stir forth
without her usher before her, and her yeoman after her. Lastly, (which is most
pertinent to our purpose) they showed how they had lost much of their honor
which did of right belong unto them by yiedling too much to the desires of the
masculine sex, how they were debarred from bearing all Offices of authority in
the Common Wealth, and desired to be satisfied why they should be allowed (as
it was due unto them,) pre-eminence at the Table, the right hand in the streets
and in all public places, and why they should be incapable of Magistracy,
contrary to their ancient Custom; but while they were thus parling, Misogynes
passing by, and hearing their discourse, rudely steps in to them, and wished
them to remember that they were not made to rule but to obey, that they were
inferior to men in every respect, that by reason of them men undergo all the
misery in the World, that they are of themselves unperfect Creatures, and for
that cause every woman desires to be a man; that they are cold and timorous,
and therefore not fit to undergo the offices of the Commonwealth; that if
they should be admitted to any places of Command, and should but once
transgress the bounds of chastity, they would dishonor themselves and their
places in perpetuity; when as the same offense in men is many times past by and
soon forgotten; that men accompanying them, become imperfect, and for that
cause hate them most that had their virginity, and that women accompanying men
become more perfect, and for that cause love them best that had theirs; which
Philogynes hearing began to grow in choler, and plainly told him he was in an
error, and that he would make it plainly appear unto him and all the World,
that women (according to the naturalists) are no way inferior unto men: for if
they be, (said he) it is either in respect of their substance or their
accidents; but in respect of their substance it cannot be, because they are
both of the same substance, and (according to the Logicians) are a species
comprehended under one and the same genus: and in respect of their accidents it
is not, because it must be either in respect of the accidents belonging to the
body, or the accidents belonging to the mind: if by reason of the accidents
belonging to the body, it is because men are more strong, more agile, and more
laborious then women; but that's no reason: for that among men the strongest are
not in most esteem, but the wisest; if by reason of the endowments belonging
to the mind, it is because men are more wise, more valiant, more temperate and
more just then women; but that is no reason, for that we may read of many
women that have governed Kingdoms with as great wisdom as men, to have been
as excellent Philosophers and Poets as men, to have led on Armies in the field
as courageously as men, to have decided controversies in the Courts of justice
as judiciously as men, and to have been as sober and temperate in the whole
course of their lives as men; yea which is more, if any pre-eminence be to be
given concerning the endowments of the mind, the woman is to have it, because
her flesh is more delicate and tender, and according to Philosophy, the more
delicate the constitution of the body is, the more excellent are the endowments
of the mind; for that the form follows the temperature of the body; and where
you allege that a woman is an imperfect creature without a man, you might as
well say a man is imperfect without a woman; for being that God made man and
woman to increase and multiply humane generation upon the face of the earth,
both are imperfect without each other; and to speak the truth the woman in
that case is the more perfect of the two, and is to have the pre-eminence, if
any pre-eminence be to be given, because that man engenders with delight
without any trouble, but the woman brings forth with sorrow, and not without
hazard of life: and where you allege that every woman desires to be a man,
to the end she may be more perfect, certainly you are deceived in the end; for
they do not desire it, to the end they may be more perfect, but to the end they
may avoid that tyranny which men have usurped over them: and where you say that
man is hot, and woman cold, and by how much heat is to be preferred before
cold, by so much is a man to be preferted before a woman; it is true, heat is
the more noble quality of the two, if we consider it in the elements as they
are simple, but consider it in the mixed bodies, there it is otherwise; for if
cold cause women to be timorous and fearful which is a defect, heat causes
men to be furious and frantic, which is an excess, and it cannot be
maintained that a man that is a fool, because he has more heat then a woman,
ought to be preferred, because a wary distrust in a woman which proceeds of
cold, is to be preferred before a rash and giddy forwardness in a man which
proceeds of heat; and where you say that had it not been for a woman man had
never tasted of misery, you might as well have remembered, had it not been for a
woman man had never tasted of felicity; and where you say, if women should be
advanced to any places of Command, and should but once transgress the bounds
of chastity, they would dishonor themselves and their places in perpetuity:
when men do often transgress in that kind, and no notice taken of it;
certainly that is the fault and folly of the times, that do not lay the
burden upon the right horse; the man deserves to be condemned and the woman
pitied; for being that the hardest stone is in time worn by the soft drops of
rain, the strongest fort with often batteries levelled with the dust, and the
gravest judge with bribes and flatteries corrupted; why should a poor weak
woman if after a long seige she yield her self captive, be condemned, and
not rather he that made the breach? and where you say, that man hates the woman
most that had his virginity, because thereby he becomes more imperfect; and
the woman loves the man best that had hers, because thereby she becomes most
perfect. I confess there is such a problem, but you are mistaken in the
reason of the problematist; it is not because the man becomes more imperfect,
and the women more perfect; but because the man is fickle, whom he loves to day
he hates to morrow, and the woman constant in her first love to her first
lover: and that I may fully stop your mouth, I will tell you of some women whom
you shall hardly find me men to parallel; there was one Mirte, the first Queen
of the Lydians, who was of so low a stature that she seemed to be a Dwarf,
yet of so great a spirit, that she led on Armies in the field, and decided
causes in courts of justice; insomuch that the Lydians thought it no dishonor
to them to give her the precedence amongst their Kings. Cornelia the Mother of
the Gracchi was more honored in Rome for the Lectures which she read, then her
sons were for the Victories which they obtained; of whom Cicero gave this
testimony, that he never knew out of so weak a body to proceed so strong a
wit: Arete the daughter of Aristippus read the Natural and Moral Philosophy
Lecture 35 years in Athens, whom the Athenians honored with this Epitaph, here
lies Arete, il splendore di Grecia, la quale hebbe la bellezza d' Helena
l'honesta di Tirma, la penna d' Aristippo, l'anima di Socrate, e la lingua di
Homero, the splendour of Greece, who had the beauty of Helena, the honesty of
Tirma, the pen of Aristippus, the spirit of Socrates, and the tongue of Homer.
Policrata the daughter of Pythagoras, was so wise and learned, that it is said
of her, che piu valeanole parole che ella diera parlando con la rocca e il
fuso, che la filosofia che suo padre leg geva nella Academia, that the words
which fell from her when she was at her spindle and distaffe, were more witty
and pithy, then the Lectures which her father read in the schools. Nicostrata
the Wife of King Evander, was so well versed in Poetry, that it was said, had
she lived in the days of Homer, il nome di Homero sarerbe gia devantato
oscuro, Homer would have been but an obscure man. Astemia and Assiotta, the two
scholars of Plato, were in such renown in their generations, that Plato did
more glory in the ready apprehension of the one, and the strong memory of the
other, then he did in all the Scholars that ever he read unto. In the
conspiracy against Nero, in which both men and women were engaged, when the men
by tortures discovered their brethren, friends, and kindred, Epichaira with all
the tortures that could be devised, could not be drawn to discover one; so
Leona for the like constancy was honored by the Athenians: in honor of whom
the portraiture of a Lioness without a tongue, was set up in brass before the
Capitol in Athens. The women of Lacedemon deserve perpetual memory, who when
their children had quit the field, and cowardly run away, their Mothers met
them, and in derision asked them: (...): whether they thought it possible for
them to receive them into their wombs again, and hide them from their Enemies;
(...), It is a most injust thing, and it will ever redound to your dishonor to
lose that Country, (...), which your forefathers enjoyed many generarions, and
left unto you as your just Inheritance: and so they returned and got the glory
of the day. The Persian Ladies are not to be forgotten, who never triumphed
more then when their Children died fighting, and were never more dejected, then
when they heard of their cowardice and running away. Unto these I might add the
three Daughters of Laelius, especially Sabina; the twenty Ladies that are so
often remembered in our Histories, whereof ten were of Greece, the other Roman
Ladies, who were all Crowned with Laurel, and had statues of brass with their
names inscribed upon them erected in perpetual memory of them. Admit them
(quoth Philogynes) that women have their imperfections, shall they therefore
be debarred of all rule and aurhority; for the same reason I may except
against all men, for that the most noble spirits of the world have not been
free from imperfections. We read of Plato, who for his incomparable
understanding was surnamed the Divine, that he was so besotted with the love
of his Archenasse, that he made many verses in the praise of her; of
Aristotle, who shined amoagst learned men as the Sun amongst the Stars,
that he was so enamored with a common lost woman, named Herpyllide (whom he
kept (...) until his death, as Atheneus has it in the 13 Book of his
Dipnon-sophists) that he consumed in the sight of all men, and became a
stranger to his study; of Pericles, that he was so besotttd with his Aspasia,
that his friends were ashamed of him: the like is reported of Demosthenes and
Isocrates, which gave just occasion to Lais a lost woman, to say, hearing some
highly commending them for their wisdom and learning; I know not well what
their wisdom and learning is, but this I know well, that am but a woman, and
never read in the schools at Athens, that they come often to my School, where
of learned men they become foolish lovers; the like is reported of many Noble
Princes; of Demetrius King of the Athenians it is said, that he was so taken
with a lost woman, named Lamye, that he lived but in her, and abandoned his
Wife Exoine for her sake, that he gave unto her eleven talents of Silver, which
the Athenians gave unto him to pay his Soldiers, and so much honored her at
her death, that he caused her to be buried before his window, to the end he
might not forget her. Of Pyrrhus King of the Epir^tes, that he was so much
taken with another lost woman, that he carried her along with him to the wars
in Italy; of great Manileus, that he spent more Money in the courting of
Flora, then in the conquest of his Enemies. Hereby you may know (Misogynes)
that as well men as women are subject to imperfections; so as if you will exempt
women from bearing of rule because of their imperfections, I may except against
men (as I have said) for the same reason; wherefore when you speak of women,
remember your Mother (Misogynes) and speak more moderately, lest the dogs eat
you as they did Euripides for the same crime. Philandrogynes hearing this hot
dispute between Philogynes and Misogynes, endeavors to moderate the business,
saying, though I do not attribute so much unto women as Philogynes does; yet I
may not derogate so much from them as Mysogynes does; but as they are species
comprehended under one Genus (as has been said) so I think it very fit that
according to the Laws of Lycurgus, they should bear equal authority, though
in a different manner, that is, that the man should rule abroad and the woman
at home; and to pacify the Ladies (whose thoughts could hardly be confined
within so narrow a room) he showed how Lucretia, that was so famous amongst
the Romans, was not so much commended for her Noble Parentage, Beauty,
chastity, or any thing else, as for this, that upon the return of her Husband
from the Wars, when other Ladies were from home feasting and dallying, her
Husband found her in her house spinning. How it was the constant custom of the
Roman Ladies to be either in the Temples praying, or in their houses sowing;
as it was of the Roman Lords, to be either in the fields fighting, or in their
studies reading^; and how that a good housewife will find all the delights in
her house, which may be found abroad; if she have a desire to make any visit,
at her door she may visit the poor, the lame and the blind; if she have a
desire to show her self in her bravery, whose approbation can give a better
luster to her attire then her Husbands? if to sport and play, she has her
Children to dally with; if to command, she has Servants, who are bound to obey
her. So the assembly broke up, the Ladies went home well satisfied, and
Philogynes and Misogynes were reconciled. It is said that Gabalo set up this
assembly which the Graecians called (...), to this end to keep the Ladies from
idleness, the seminary of all wickedness.

*27. Dignitates immoderate exercuit.

He exercised the dignities which he purchased with excessive usury.

It is a principle amongst hucksters, and such as have dealings in the World,
that they that buy dear must sell dear. It holds in spiritual preferments,
he that emptieth his bags in buying of dignities, will fill them again in
selling of Benefices, and poling of under Officers; it was so in the days of
Richard the First, when William Longshampe Bishop of Ely lived, and long before
him in the days of William Rufus when the munke of Malmsbury exclaimed, proh
dolor, Ecclesiae nummis venduntur and aere, and it will ever be so. Aristotle
seems to uphold the trade, Consentaneum est (says he) ut ij qui emunt
magistratus quaestui habere assuescant remp. cum ^d eos largitionibus
ascenderunt; it is good reason that he that buys authority, should make some
profit of his authority; but let us take heed how we follow Aristotle's
consentaneum, lest we partake of the Bishop of Ely his supplicium. Of the
excessive pride and oppression, and of the fall of the Bishop of Ely, vid. Mat.

*28, Quidam comes Warwicensis ab Ed. 4

An Earl of Warwick raised to such a height of power by King Edw. the 4.

This is the great Earl of Warwick that set up and pulled down Kings. Richard
Nevill the son of Richard Nevill, Lord Chancellor, and Earl of Salisbury, he
was Lord high Chamberlain, Constable of Dover Castle, Lord Warden of the
Cinque^orts, and Admiral, and indeed had the whole power of the Kingdom in
his hands; I may well say the whole power; for he had not only the command of
the Ports and Navy, but he had the command of the hearts of the people,
insomuch that they that knew him say, quocunque ille inclinaret, populus aut
saltem major pars populi inclinabat; which way soever he went, as a torrent
he drew the people along with him; and to give him his due, fuit vere nobilis
quasi prae aliis notabilis; nam ab ineunte aetate (as Historians report of him)
non solum veris virtutibus mirabilis, sed etiam art^ quadam in ostentatione
earum virtutum compositus; he was truly noble, for from his childhood he had
not only rare and admirable gifts of nature, but he had art and eloquence to
express them; by means whereof he grew gracious in the sight of the people;
amongst other his virtues he had two most eminent: Magnanimity and Liberality,
which will win the heart of an enemy: his Liberality he daily showed in his
hospitality, his Magnanimity and valor as at diverse other times, so especially
at the first battle at St. Albons Anno. 1455. ubi ille primus omnium regios
milites praelio lacessit, as my Author says, where he himself made the
first assault against the Kings Army, and after a doubtful warlike dispute
which continued for the space of three or four hours, prevailed, and slew
Henry Lord Piercy the second Earl of Northumberland, the Lord Clifford, and
the Duke of Sommerset; Edmond Beauford that Duke of Somerset, qui tot annos pro
patria stren^e pugnasset adversus Francos, that adventured himself many years
against the French in the behalf of his Country; miserabile sane spectaculum
quod a suis civibus occideretur, as that Author says; a sad spectacle, that
he that so often adventured himself for his country should be killed by his
country men: but in abattell when all parties are in the higth of fury there is
no distinction; the Earl buried him nobly, which was as much honor as he
could do to one that fought against him; the Earl married Anne the Sister and
Heir of Henry Duke of Warwick, King of the Isle of Wight, and the favorite of
King Henry the sixth, (who dyed at Hanly where he was borne; being now the
Inheritance of the Sir John Russel of Strencham was Mr. of the Horse to Rich.

this I say, that I cannot find, others peradventure may, any family of that
name more ancient, I will not except the most eminent) in whose right he was
Earl of Warwick, and had a massy estate; by her he had issue two daughters,
Isabell and Ann whom he married into the Royal blood, Isabell to George Duke
of Clarence the brother of King Edward the fourth, the eldest son of King
Henry the sixth, who was slain after the battle at Tewxbury: and afterward to
Richard This honor is aptly compared to Sejanus his horse. Tho. of Woodst.
Duke of Gloucest. was strangled at Callis An. 1397. Tho. L. Spencer Earl of
Gloucest. was beeheaded at Bristoll An. 1400. Humfrey Duke of Gloucest. was
strangled in the Abbey of St Edinbury An. 1446. Richard Duke of Glou. was slain
at Bosw. an. 1485.
Duke of Gloucester who was slain at Bosworth; this man notwithstanding he
had been thus advanced, fell off from the King, and the cause of his revolt was
for that he being sent into France to treat of a marriage for the King, the
King in the mean while married with the Lady Gray, which the Earl taking to
heart conceiving it to be a great wrong unto him to be so deluded,
confederated with George Duke of Clarence his son in law to set King Henry
the sixth at liberty, being then in the Tower of London; but it is conceived
that this was but a pretense, and that their intention was to settle the Crown
upon the Duke; for it is not probable or credible that the Duke would ever
agree to settle the Crown out of his own house upon the house of Lancaster;
and hereupon there was a bloody battle fought at Danes-moore not far from
Banbury, and was called Edgcote field, where the Kings Army was defeated, and
not long after the King taken prisoner at Wolney a village near to
Northampton, and conveyed to Warwick Castle, and from thence to Middlenam
Castle in Yorkshire, out of which he escaped, gathered new forces, and at
Stamford in Lincolneshire encountered and overcame the Earl, and made him fly
for succor into France; but not long after the Earl returned, and having
assistance from the King of France, put the King to the worst, made him forsake
the Kingdom and fly for relief to the Duke of Burgondy: which Commines imputes
to the Kings credulity in relying too much upon the Marquess Mountacute, who
when he had most need of him revolted to his brother; but not long after the
King returned, and upon an Easter day after a bloody fight at Barnet, the King
prevailed and slew both the brothers, the Earl and the Marquess, which ended
the controversy; and as the loss of the other battle was the revolting of the
Marquess Mountacute from the King to his brother, so the loss of this was the
revolt of the Duke of Clarence the Earl to the King his brother. Some say that
after the battle was ended, Richard then Duke of Gloucester slew King Henry
the sixth in the field with his own hands; but that is a mistaking; for Richard
Duke of Gloucester did not kill Henry the sixth after the battle at Barnet,
but he killed Edward the fifth his eldest son after the battle at Tewxbury
with his own hands; for without doubt Henry the sixth was murdered in the Tower
of London, whose death was much lamented, for he was a good man though not so
good a King, fuit vir miti and simplici ingenio, qui pacem bello and honestum
utili anteponebat, quo nemo probius, nemo castius, nemo sanctius vixit, non
inhiabat opes, nec sitiebat honores, ast animae tantum saluti studebat; he was
a plain dealing man, one that preferred peac^ before war, and honesty before
profit, that was honest, chaste, and religious beyond comparison, that was
neither coveteous or ambitious, but addicted himself wholly to the study of
Divinity, as the Historians that write of those times say, but in another
manner do they speak of his Wife, they say that she was bello metuenda virago
as Ovid speaks of Pallas, foemina virilium operum plena, and gloria appetens,
that she had a manly courage, and was thirsty after sovereignty that she was
the cause of all her husbands troubles, that she was taken at the battle at
Teuxbury, that she was ransomed by her Father, and dyed in her own Country
beyond the Seas. vid. Commin. lib. 3. and Polid. lib. 23.

*29. Wolsaeus apud Henricum octavum

Tho. Wolsey very gracious with the King.

Thomas Wolsey was the son of a mean man in Ipswich in the County of
Suffolk, ubi magnificae structurae fundamentae postea locavit; he was bred up
in Magdalen College in Oxon, and was a Schoolmasters after of the School
there, who having the Tutelage of three of the Marquess Dorsets Sons, the
Marquess gratified him with the Benefice of Lymminghton, which was his first
preferment; afterward he made in to The posterity of Sir Richard Namphant,
remains to this day in Worcestershire. The family quarters. 5. Coats. The
First, Sables a Cheveron Ermine between three dexter-wings argent. The Second
argent, 3. Foxes passant a zure. The Third Checkie or and Sables, a chief
argent Gutty. The Fourth argent, a Lion Rampant Gules, between a bordure Sables
Besanty. The Fifth parted per Pale, Argent and Gules by the name of Fleet.
Sir Richard Nanphant, then Treasurer of Callis, a man in great account with
King Henry the seventh, and became his Chaplain, who finding his abilities,
being grown in years, committed a great part of the burden of his office to
his care, and at last for the good service that he did him, preferred him to be
one of the Kings Chaplains; not long after by means of the Lord Lovell and
Doctor Fox then Bishop of Winchester who were the most potent men with the
King, he was sent Ambassador into Flanders to Maximilian the Emperor: in
which Embassage he behaved himself so discreetly, that the King at his return
rewarded him with the Deanery of Lincoln, and afterward made him his Almoner,
which were (as I conceive) all the preferments that he had in the days of King
Henry the Seventh; but soon after in the days of King Henry the Eighth, he
became to be one of the Privy Council, and to be so gracious with him, that
he sent him twice into Flanders upon Embassages, to Charles the Fifth, and once
into France, to Francis the First. After he made him Bishop of Turney, Bishop
of Lincoln, Archbishop of York, Abbot of Saint Albones, Chancellor of
England, and the receiver of the profits of the Bishopric of Bathe and Wels,
Worcester and Hereford; and as if all these preferments had not been sufficient
to support the magnificence of a Priest, he being legate a latere, by express
Authority from the Pope, got into his hands, opes and praedia quadraginta
monasteriorum, ut eorum emolumenta in collegiis extruendis impenderet: of which
the King took advantage; for seeing the Crows were gone, corvorum nidos
penitus distruendos esse curavit, ne iterum ad cohabitandum convolent; he took
care to have their nests thrown down, that they might never come thither
again to take up their residence, and so pulled down the monasteries, which
might have stood a great deale' longer, had not the Pope and Cardinal opened
that gap, and showed the King the way; by which mean, which Polydore terms
singular nefas, he obtained so great a revennue, that they which were most
intimate with him, and best knew his estate, report, quod annui proventus
plures fuerant quam fi omnes hujus regni Episcoporum atque etiam Decanorum
possessiones hodiernae in unum aliquem conferrentur, that his yearly commings
in did amount unto more then the revennues of all the Bishoprics and Deaneries
in England; but how did he employ this great revennue? he was no miser or
hoorder, nec erat tam studiosus in rebus comparandis quam liberalis in
clargiendis; neither was he so careful to get, as willing to disburse; for
having got this immense estate into his hands, immediately his thoughts run how
to dispose of it; and first the Muses came into his mind the advancement of
Learning, and therefore his first design was to build two famous Colleges,
one in Ipswick, the other in Oxford; the one being the place where he was
borne, the other where he was bred; he aid the foundation, but (I know not
why) he was prevented, so that he could not finish them; the one continues, the
other is demolisht. That in Oxford he Christened with his own name, and named
it the Cardinals College; but that name continued not long, but it received
another name, and was called Regium Collegium, Kings College; yet that name
continued not long; for the King not willing to assume the honor to himself,
to be the founder of a College which was founded by another, entitled it
Aedes Christi, Christ Church, which name it still retains. This the Cardinal
intended to have made a College beyond comparison; for had he had his liberty
to have gone on, and finished the other parts of it proportionable to the
Kitching (which rather resembles, Vnde fuit quod quidam satyrice^ scripsit,
quod animus erat in patinis, popinam ^^erfecit, Collegium incoepit.
dinastae habitationem quam obsonatorum apothecam) there is no College in
Christendom that would have been comparable to it for magnificence; but one
thing unhappily fell out; upon the Tower in the great Quadrangle, where the
Ensigns both of the King and Cardinal were engraven in stone, the Cardinals
had the precedencie as Founder, which did not a little move the King, but that
I impute to the workmen; by reason that in a window not much distant, the
Cardinal to manifest to the World his original, and that whatsoever he had,
he had received by the gracious favor of his Prince, Non ignoro quod aliqui
sunt qui hoc esse factum in contumeliam suam volunt, sicut in Gallia, in
caenaculo suo insculpsere g^lerum Cardin litum cum p^tibulo supra.
caused above his Ensign to be lively pourtraited for his crest, Molossum
ovinam scapulam arrodendem, a Mastivedog knawing of a shoulder of mutton,
because that those kind of dogs are most commonly kept by Butchers, erat enim
lanii filius, and he was not ashamed of it, and therein he showed not only a
great deal of humility, but a great deal of worth and wisdom; for it is no
dishonor to descend from mean Parentage, by reason the greatest Rivers have
their beginnings from little Springs, and the greatest Families from mean
beginnings; but if he had set up the Crest of any great Lord or Prince, that
would have been a dishonor unto him, and showed a great deal of arrogance in
disclaiming his father that begot him; Neither did the Cardinals thoughts rest
here upon these foundations, but he raised them a great deal higher; for if
not at the same time that he laid these foundations, yet not long after, quasi
natus ad splendida tecta erigenda, he built those two Princely Palaces of
White Hall and Hampton Court, Novam regiam quae nunc a splendore aula candida
dicta, etc.
which do exceed all other the Kings houses; the one for entertainment, the
other for magnificence, which indeed did a little exceed the degree of a
Priest; I might add a Subject; for that in all the Histories that I have read,
I do not find any Subject to have done so great things, unless it were Cosmo
de Medicis, a Citizen of Florence, who built two Churches in the City, and a
Monastery, and three Monasteries in the Country, and an Hospital at Jerusalem
for Pilgrims, and endowed them all, and for himself a house in Florence,
admired for architecture by the best Architects, and in the Country not far
remote from the City four stately Palaces; yet lived as a Citizen, married his
Daughters to Citizens of his own rank, and dyed a Citizen, about the year of
our Lord 1464, without any title of honor; but his Posterity was abundantly
rewarded for his good works; for the Florentines out of his Family chose their
Dukes, which do continue Dukes of Florence, and are named afther his name of
the house of Medicis; but to come to the Cardinal, the retinue of this
Cardinal, fidem superat; and for mine own part I cannot believe the report
which is given of it; it is repotted, quod assiduo famulitii obsequio aderant
Comes unus, barons novem and multo plurimi equites and armige^i; that an
Earl, nine Barons, and many more Knights, and Esquires were Servants in
ordinary to him; it may be they might daily resort to his Table, quasi
famulitii, as duly as if they had been his domestique Servants, which they
might do without disparagement of themselves; for being that he was quicquid
esse voluit, whatsoever he would be, and obtained quodcunque voluerit,
whatsoever he asked, and non domi tantum, sed and foris, for the King himself
acknowledged, and se and regem Galliae a Wolsaeo regi, I could not blame the
Nobility to make in unto him, both for their own good, and the good of their
friends; but that they should stoop so low, as to become famulitii quotidiani,
daily waiters upon him, whose beginning was so fresh in memory, cannot enter
into my thoughts. This Cardinal that was so great to day in honors, in
possessions, in attendants, I cannot say in treasure, for that went out as fast
as it came in, the next day, or within few days after became so mean, ut non
modo supellectilem, sed etiam pecuniam under aleretur ab amicis sumere necessum
habuerit; that he was enforced to be beholding to his friends, not only for
Money, but also for necessaries, which gave occasion to his Enemies thus (but
without cause) to descant upon him.

Vilia qui quondam miseris alinenta negavit,
Nunc mendicato pascitur ille cibo.
It is reported, that upon the Message which the King sent unto him, by the
Dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, to retire to Asher in Surrey, being a house
belonging to the Bishopric of Winchester, and not far from Hampton Court,
that he continued there with his Family twenty days, without either beds,
sheets, table-clothes, or dishes to eat his meat; which report I do not
believe; and if it be true, yet I conceive it was his own desire to have it
so; for being that he wanted no kind of Provision for his Table, as is
acknowledged by the same reporter, he could not have wanted those necessaries,
if he had desired them of his Servants, being persons of quili^y and estate,
and such as did adhere unto him in both fortunes; as namely Sir William
Gaescoigne his Treasureur, Sadler the Clerk of his Kitching, (as I take it),
afterward Sir Ralph Sadler, who left a fair estate in Worcestershire, and
Cromwell his receiver, especially of Cromwell, of whom the greatest Enemies to
the Cardinal gave this testimony, quod nemo erat Caerdinalitam infensus quin
Cromwelli fidelitatem summis laudibus extolleret, quod dominum suum in summa
calamitate non deseruit, sed totis viribus defendere conatus est; that there
was no man so much offended with the Cardinal, but highly commended Cromwell
for his fidelity to his Lord and Master in his greatest extremity: in few words
all his Servants loved him, and adhered to him to the last; and not without
cause; for as he wa^ a good Steward to his Master, so he was a better Master
to his Stewards and his followers; thinking upon nothing more then how to
advance them; he was twice accused of Treason, but what that Treason was, we
shall know apud Graecas Calendas, for he was never attainted or convicted,
only he submitted to a praemunire brought against him in Parliament, by which
his estate was confiscate; (...), he dyed of a Flux in the Abbey of Leicester,
and was buried. Diverse are the votes that are given of this Cardinal; Polydore
condemns him in every thing; but Polydore was a stranger, an Italian; and had
his errors, as they that are familiar with him, know better then I; but
Cavendish that was his Gentleman Usher, and wrote his life, and knew him better
then Polydore, in most things speaks in another manner of him; and for mine
own part I am of his opinion that says, si ingenii dotes tam habuisset
temperatas quam habuit illustres, quantum fortunae habuit and gloriae cupiit,
tantum and meruisset, if he had not strained his thoughts unto too high a
pitch, but had confined himself within a mean, if one man might have deserved
so much as he had, he might have deserved it; for that I cannot find that
ever he reflected his thoughts upon himself, to raise any house of his name,
but ever sent forth his Treasure in handfulls, that came in in spoonesulls, and
what he had, the King knew, the Kingdom knew, because he exposed it daily to
view; he that diligently reads this story will find that the King from the
beginning used the Cardinal but as a sponge. vid. Godw. de Epis. Angl. G.

*30 Inter tres Principes.

He carried himself indifferently between the King his Master, the King of
England, and the Duke of Burgondy.

Never did the Kingdom of France produce a more turbulent spirit then this
Constable; he was the only Incendiary between the King his Master, the King of
England, and the Duke of Burgondy, and his ambition ever was rather to be
feared then loved, for which he grew Odimus accipitrem qui semper vivit in
armis.
contemptible, and his death often threatened before it happened. Commines
writing of the tumultuous broils that happened between these Princes, shows that
there were two principal motives that occasioned the Constable and the Duke of
Guyen to kindle the fire; one was their own safety; for they did conceive if
there were a peace concluded, that either the one or the other would fall foul
upon them; the other was to compel the Duke of Burgondy by a War, if they
could not otherwise prevail, to marry his daughter, being his daughter and
heir, to the Duke of Guyen; and these designs were manifested to the Duke of
Burgondy upon the delivering up of St. Quintins, and Amiens to the King; for
the Duke beeng much troubled for the loss of these towns, in a friendly
manner writ unto the Constable not to press a War, being that there was no
defiance offered; unto whom the Constable perceiving that he stood in fear of
him, which was the thing he aimed at, returned a peremptory answer to this
effect, that there was but one way for him to help himself, which was to
bestow his daughter upon the Duke of Guyen; which if he would do, not only
the said Duke but diverse other Lords would declare themselves for him against
the King, and he would redeliver St. Quintins and Amiens unto him, and assist
him with all his power, otherwise he would pursue the War; which answer the
Duke having received, resolved to undergo any misery rather then to have his
daughter taken from him in that way; and thereupon forthwith acquainted the
King with those and the like letters which he had sent to the King of England,
who immediately revived the agreement made at Bonvines concerning the death of
the Constable. Of the letters which the Constable sent to the Duke of Burgondy,
and the King of England, see Commines lib. 4. c. how the agreement at Bonvines
was afterward ratified, and he delivered by the Duke of Burgondy coming to
him upon safe conduct, see Commin. lib. 4. See more of the Constable in the
general History of France in Lewis the 11.

*31. Peculasus accusatus, suspendio affectus.

Enguerrande for robbing the Kings Treasure was accused, and hanged.

Enguerrande was Earl of Longuevill, and Superintendent of the Treasure under
Philip the fourth called the fair, and did him good service; but Charles the
Kings brother conceiving inplacable hatred against him in the beginning of the
reign of Lewis Hutin accused him for robbing the Kings Treasure, and gave this
in evidence against him; rerum vires nervusque pecunia est; te interrogo
Enguerran^ cujusnam pecunia arcaque recondita clausaque cupiditati tuae fuerit?
non interrogo quam amplum patrimonium relictam tibi a Parentibus fuit; tu te
creasti, tu te genuisti; ingredere fiscum Regis, inopiam invenies, ingredere
aedes istius gurgitis, gazam Persicam invenies; an virtute parta? quae virtus
in tali monstro potest esse? and upon this evidence prevailed to have him
hanged upon a gallows set up at Mountfalcon. See Paul. Aemil. lib. 8.

*32. Petrus Laudoicus apud ducem Britaniae.

Peter Landais was in the like favor with the Duke of Britain.

Peter Landais was the son of a very mean man of Vitry in Britanny, and came
to the Court very poor, whom the Duke at the first employed to carry his
amorous Letters to his Ladies, after made him the Master of his Wardresse, then
his Treasurer, and in the end his power was so great that he did in a manner
what he would; he was the man that caused the Duke to suffer Chauvin his
Chancellor to dye miserably in prison of hunger and cold, which so incensed
the Nobility that they resolved to ease the Duke of him; whereupon John of
Chalon Prince of Orange, and son to one of the Dukes Sisters, and John of Rieux
Marshall of Britanny, and one of the greatest men in Court, together with the
Nobility resolved to surprise him in the Castle of Na^^s, or wheresoever they
could find him, though in the Dukes presence; which they performed; And so
Peter was arraigned, condemned, and hanged, priusquam causam sciret dux, as
Paulus Aemilius has it. Vid Paul. Aemil. l. 10. c. 8. and supplem. ad lib. 6.

Observations.
There is no man so vile and contemptible in the world but is good to some
body; this Peter that was thus hanged, did one of the greatest courtesies to
King Hen. the 7th that ever was done to him. When King Edw. the Fourth sent
unto Francis Duke of Brittany, Doctor Stillington with others-laden with Gold,
to request him to deliver unto them the Earl of Richmond being his Prisoner,
upon pretense to unite the two houses by an alliance; the Duke conceiving that
he intended to marry Elizabeth his Eldest Daughter unto him, without any
scruple took their Gold, and delivered him; but being informed afterward by
Peter his favorite, that it was but a pretense, and that he meant to cut off
his head, sent him post after them; who finding them at Saint Mallo staying for
a wind, took a course to have the Earl conveyed into the Sanctuary there; yet
possessed the Doctor and his fellows that he had no hand in it, but that he
escaped of himself; and when they pressed to have him redelivered, he told them
it could not be without his Masters consent, and that they should very speedily
know his mind therein; So Peter sent to the Duke, and the Duke sent a
peremptory answer that he had once delivered him, and being that through their
negligence they had suffered him to take Sanctuary, he would not take him out,
but would keep him there or in his own Palace for them, so Peter cosened them
of their money and adventure (as he had cosened his Master all his life time,)
and sent them home without either.

*33, Alvarus de luna jussu Regis.

Alvarus de luna was by the Kings Command put to death.

Aeneas Sylvius in the forty seventh book of his History of Europe, speaking of
the manner of the death of Alvarus, says, non ignavus occubuit, non lachrymans
aut ejulans, sed alacri vultu and quasi ad epulas invitatus numeratis suis in
Regem ^egnumque meritis cervicem gladio praebuit; he dyed not a child weeping
and wailing, but relating the good service he had done for his King and
Country, chearefully submitted to the sentence of the Law.

*34. Ludovicus potentissimus Rex.

Lewis the powerful King of Hungary.

It is worthy our labor to enquire wherein his power did consist; was it in
the extent of his dominions? no; for they were no other then were left him; was
it in the multitude of his people, or in the abundance of his Treasures? no,
for many of his predecessors did equalize him and exceed him in them; Caetera
vi aut fraud pertumpas; h^^c arx inaccessa, hoc inexpugnabile munimentum Cicer.
but it was in the true and hearty affections of his people; for never Prince
did more affect his Subjects, nor ever a people more affect a Prince, as was
manifested by the inconceivable sorrow that was expressed for him, both in the
time of his sickness, at his death and after his death. Bonsinius writing his
History, says, that when the people heard of his sickness, ita vulgo
trepidari caeptum est, ut suae quisque vitae timere videretur; every one began
to fear and tremble as if they had been in danger of death; public prayers
were made for his recovery, and the people in every town and Village went to
Church to beg of God not to take him from them; moerent juvenesque senesque,
and when they heard of his death,

omnia luctus,
Omnia solliciti plena timoris erant.
Quocunque aspicies gemitus luctusque
sonabant,
Formaque non taciti funeris instar erat.
There was nothing heard but lamentations and mourning; the mothers with their
children came out of every place to bewail his death with pitiful cries and
lamentations as if they had lost the dearest friend in the world; some cried
they had lost the most indulgent father, others the most sweet Prince, some
the best master, others the best Governor; there was no praelate or Peer to
be seen with dry eyes, universa Hungaria vest pulla triennio luctum
regionatim celebrabat; nusquam risus, sonus, jocus, chorea, aut aliquod
festivitatis genus spectatum est, by a public decree it was commanded that for
the space of three years every one should mourn, and all sports should be
laid aside: so as in the Prince and People were those old Verses verified,
Totum est unus homo Regnum,
Rex caput est, Populus caetera membra gerit.


*35. Carolum parvum ex Apuleia accersunt.

They sent for Carolus parvus out of Apuleia.

The man that was employed in the business was a Bishop named Zagabriensis,
who upon his arrival into Apuleia saluted the King with an eloquent Oration,
to this effect etc. The sacred memory of your most Noble Progenitors never to
be forgotten, who have ever governed our Kingdom with the greatest Wisdom,
has invited us to come unto you, hoping that in th^se our extremities you will
not forsake us; we are not ignorant most Noble Prince that you are the next
Heir to the Crown, and that the government of the Kingdom of right belongs
unto you; wherefore I am sent unto you by the most powerful Peers of the
Kingdom to entreat you to take into your consideration our distressed estate,
and not to prefer an usurpt new authority before the ancient right of the
Crown of Hungary; how just our cause, is I shall briefly declare unto you.
After the death of our Noble King, who deserved well not only of us, but of all
the Christian World, for his sake we elected his only daughter Maria to be our
King, and commanded that she should be styled by no other name then by the
name of King, and caused her to be Crowned with such an applause, that there
was not more sorrow conceived at the death of her Father then there was joy at
her Coronation. But it so happened that the Queen Mother assuming to her self
the Government of the State during the Minority of the young Queen, took into
her Counsel one Count Gara, and what he advises only is put in execution;
the Counsel of the rest of the Nobility being wholly neglected, so that
neither our Queen Maria nor the Queen Mother, but the Count only governes the
Kingdom; he advances whom he will, and deposes whom he will, at which the
Peers and People are so much offended, that setting aside law, justice and
honesty, many robberies are committed, many Towns burnt, many men's cattle
driven away, civil discord arises between the Peers, and many other enormous
outrages have been and are committed among the people; for reformation whereof
I am now sent to your Excellency to entreat you with as much expedition as you
can to come into Hungary, and to take into your Possession the Kingdom not
delivered unto you by us, but of right belonging unto you as your ancient
Inheritance, which you cannot refuse to do without incurring the most
ignominious blurs of sloth and pusillanimity; after the delivery of this speech
(which Bonsinius has most exactly written in Latin) Zagabriensis delivered
unto the King the Letters of diverse of the Nobility of the Kingdom of Hungary,
whereby he assured him of their fidelity toward him, the King having read
them heartily thanked the Lords and Zagabriensis for their good will toward
him; and because it was a business of the greatest consequence, he took three
days respite to return an answer, and in the mean time commanded that
Zagabriensis should be honorably entertained; but before the three days were
expired he acquainted his Queen with the effect of the Embassage, who
thereupon fell into a great passion, and with tears cried out, O quam malis
hue auspiciis infausti ad nos legatiad-venere! O quam depravato cuncta judicio
(mi Carole) pensitasti! nescis, heu nescis quam gravis fuerit Vngaria malorum
omnium officina; how unhappily are these Ambassadors come unto us? O my
Charles how art thou mistaken in entertaining their Embassage? thou do no^
know, alas thou do not know how Hungary has been the storehouse of all
manner of wickedness: how there is nothing but fraud and dissimulation to be
found there? how they never speak what they think, and change their minds ten
times in an hour: wherefore my sweet husband, O my sweet husband, believe not
their fair promises, if you desire the safety of you and yours; let the
remembrance of King Lewis your noble friend that deserved so well of you and
your father never depart out of your memory; call to mind I pray you how not
long before his death he sent with you into Italy a Troop of Horse, and how
you enjoy by his means the Kingdom of Apuleia; you have enough if you can
content your self in Italy, here is your Kingdom, here is your Wife, here are
your Children, here in your Hungary, fight for this and defend this. O do not,
do not go about to violate the will of your Noble friend, who bequeathed
Hungary to his Daughter Maria, and her to Sigismond the son of Charles the
Emperor, and Apuleia unto you; assure your selve that if you do offer the
least wrong to this innocent, whom her Father has designed to sit in the
Throne, God will take the quarrel into his hands and be revenged of you; for
that he never suffers any wrong done to the innocent, especially to those of
the weaker sex, such as are Widows and Orphans, to go unpunished; and so
upon her knees did beseech him, per Deos, per Caelites, per Liberos, per
cunctaque humana and divina ne expeditionem hanc infaustam suscipiat; for Gods
sake, for his childrens sake, and as he desired to inherit heaven, and to
enjoy his Possession quietly on earth, not to take so great a burden upon him;
but notwithstanding all these persuasions and entreaties, the hope of a Kingdom
prevailed with him; so that at the end of the three days the King sent for
Zagabriensis, and signified unto him that he was resolved to pursue the
design, and if the business succeeded prosperously, he would not be
unmindefull of them that had been so mindful of him; whereupon Apuleia is
fortified with strong Garrisons, preparation is made for the voyage, the King
passes the Seas, landeth in Hungary, and is received with the greatest
applause that may be, every one promising his uttermost endeavor to settle
the Crown upon him. Elizabeth the Queene-Mother, and Maria the young Queen
being given to understand of all passages that fell out, Sigismond being at
that time in Hungary to learn the language of the Country, the marriage o^ a
sudden between him and Maria was solemnized; which being accomplished,
Sigismond betook himself to Bohemia, leaving Maria in Hungary, whereof when
Carolus was given to understand he was somewhat danted, knowing how potent an
enemy he had drawn upon him; shortly after the Queen Mother and the young
Queen sent a special messenger unto Carolus, to know the cause of his coming
into Hungary, and to signify unto him that if he came as a friend, he should
have the best entertainment that Hungary could afford him; Carolus dissembling
his intentions, sent them word that the cause of his coming was to settle
things in a right course in Hungary, he understood it was in a combustion, and
that for the love he bare to the deceased father of the young Queen, he
thought himself bound in duty to use his best endeavors to reconcile such as
were at variance, and rectify the things which were out of order; which answer
of his being made known to the Queen Mother, and the young Queen, and being
given to understand that he was coming toward Buda, in a chariot richly
adorned they met him, and with this complement saluted him; nemo satis
charitatem tuam (Carole) admirabitur, gratissimumque auimum dignis laudibus
persequetur, qui nostri gratia etc. Sir we cannot sufficiently express our
thankfulness unto you, who have for our sakes, and the memory you have of our
deceased husband, left your Kingdom, your Wife and Children, and past the seas
and mountains to visit us in these our extremities; you show your self now to
be a branch of that Royal stock of our deceased husband, in that you are not
unmindefull of those good offices which he when time was did for you and your
father; and although it lies not in our power to requite those your great
favors being poor women, yet assure your self that God will requite you for
them abundantly, and we shall ever think our selves much bound unto you.
Charles still protests, se magnanimi piique Ludovici beneficia nunquam
obliteraturum, that he will never forget those noble favors of King Lewis; but
notwithstanding his protestations he takes upon him the Title of Protector of
the young Queen, and under color of that takes possession of the Kings House,
and not long after the Title of King; and in the presence both of the
Queen Mother and the young Queen is Crowned; the poor Ladies being now
dispossessed of all kind of dignity, and living after a sort private lives have
no body to discover their discontents unto, but only to the count Palatine, who
taking into his consideration their miserable Estate, bethinks himself of a
course how to settle them in their former estates: and for that purpose agrees
with one Blasius Forgath to kill Carolus, promising him a great reward, and
withal to be a perpetual friend unto him; and for the better effecting
thereof he desires the Queen Mother to send unto the King, to do her so much
honor, as to come unto her on such a day, and pretend that she had received
letters from young Sigismond, and that she would acquaint him with the
contents of them; the Queen pursues the direction of the Palatine; the King at
the day comes accordingjy, and sitting between the Queen Mother, and the young
Queen, Forgath espying his opportunity, with his sword cleft his head down to
his eyes, of which wound he immediately dyed; Forgath for the present escaped,
but not long after both he and the Palatine were butchered in the same manner;
for Carolus being dead, and all things well settled in Hungary, the Queen
Mother, the young Queen, Gara, and Forgath, together with diverse others going
upon pleasure to see the lower parts of the Country; John the Governor of
Croatia, being one that wished well unto Carolus, upon a Saint James's day
provided a Troop of Horse to entertain them, who violently assaulted them, slew
Forgath and Gara, turned the Chariot over and over, ravished many of the
Ladies, surprised the young Queen, and brutishly dragged the Queen Mother by
the hair to the Governor, who upon her knees desired to have her life saved,
and the life of the young princess, and to impute the miscarriage of things to
the weakness of their Sex, who are not able like men to manage businesses of
so high a nature; but in vain; for that night the governor caused the
Queen Mother to be drowned, and imprisoned the young Queen, where she remained
for a time, yet at last he set her at liberty, and sent her unto Buda with a
Troop of Horse, where she was with much joy received.

But did this bloody minded Governor escape unpunisht't? no, for immediately
after the Coronation of Sigismond, which was in the fourth year after the
death of King Lewis, his Queen Maria did earnestly importune him to take
revenge of that bloody parricide, qui sacro cruore manus foedurat, who
thereupon raised an Army, pretending to go against the Turk into Bulgaria; but
being in a readiness he went against the Governor of Croatia, and within
short time took him Prisoner, caused his hands to be bound to hot irons, and
his flesh with burning pincers to be pulled from his body, and what remained
to be divided into four parts, and to be hanged upon the Gates of the City; the
rest that were accessaries to the Queens death he caused to be beheaded.

Observations upon the usurpation of Carolus.
Whatsoever is gotten by usurpation is never of any long continuance. Henry the
Fourth, King of England, and King Henry the fifth may peradventure for a time
enjoy the Scepter, but de male quaesiitis non gaudet tertius haeres, the
Grandchilde Henry the sixth shall never enjoy it quietly; Richard the third may
peradventure for a time flourish and prosper, but God in the end will release a
poor Prisoner out of Brittany to take revenge of the blood of his Nephews;
King Hen. the 7th was 15 years a Prisoner with the Duke of Brittany, Com. lib.
6.
Carolus of Apuleia may for a moment insult over the weaker Sex, and usurp
upon Maria, but in the end, (...) right will prevail; Leo minimarum avium
pabulum fiet, and the Crows shall prognosticate his destiny; ferunt enim (as
says Bonfinius) quod paulo post Coronationem Caroli innumera multitudo
Corvorum regiatecta circumvolabant, and tu^matim fenestras impetabant, and
veluti strangulati crocitabant, and nulla vi repellipotuissent, Bonf. lib. 3.
dec. 1.

CHAP. II.
*36. Quisque peculiari munere devinctus est.

Every one is called to one calling or other.

SAint Gregory condemns the vain conceit and presumption of those
Astrologers that attribute so much unto the Planets, that say, if a man be
borne under Jupiter he is destinated unto riches and honor; if under Mercury,
unto Wisdom and Knowledge; that give the reason wherefore seldom is the rich
man wise, or the wise man rich, for that these Planets are seldom in
conjunction, Jupiter being the slowest of the Planets, and not being able in a
less space then twelve years to compass the Earth, and Mercury being the
swiftest of them, every year going about it, so as they seldom meet, or if
they do they stay not long together; this foolish conceit every Christian
ought to reject, for that we are taught, that there is nothing done in the
World without the divine providence of the Omnipotent; the World is a Stage,
and every one that comes into it has his part to act assigned him from
Heaven; to one the part of a King, to another of a Subject; to one of a Priest,
to another of a Prophet; to one this, to another that; David, Cyrus, Paul,
Jeremy had their several parts, David had his, dixit Dominus Prophetae, surge
unge hunc, hic est ille, the Lord said unto Samuel, rise up, anoint him, for
this is the man; Cyrus had his, propter servum Iacobum and Isralitum electum
meum, propterea me vocasti de nomine tuo, cognominavi te quamvis ignores me;
Saint Paul had his, Paulus apostolus non ab hominibus neque per hominem, sed
per Iesum Christum ac Deum patrem qui suscitavit eum ^^ mortuis; and the
Prophet Jeremy had his, cum nondum formavissem te in utero matris agnovi te,
and cum non prodiisses e vulva sanctificavi te, and Prophetam ipsis gentibus
constitui te. There is no man so mean and contemptible, but has his part
assigned him, and though in the first or second scene he may personate some
fisherman, shepherd, or heardsman, yet oftentimes in these poor men does God
show his power and omnipotency. Da^id was for many years (...), a poor
shepherd, forlorn and neglected, and not esteemed as one of the sons of
less, for when the Prophet came unto Bethlem, and invited less with his
Sons to a Banqu^t, David was not amongst them; Sala and Nathaniel, Rael and
Asam were there, but as for David he was in the fields with his flocks; and
when as the Prophet would have anointed one of them, because they were fair
and of comely countenances, the spirit of God sharply reproved him, saying, God
judges not as men do by the outward lineaments of the body, but by the inward
perfections of the mind, and that the man that he looked after was not there,
the Prophet then enquiring what other Sons he had, David was then made know
unto him, and of him he said, hic est ille, and thereupon

Vngitur Iessaides qui regia sceptra gubernat, David was anointed.

*37. Contemptus inter fratres.

Joseph was hated of his Brethren.

He was hated even unto death; for had not Ruben stickled for him, and showed
them how abominable a thing it was to murder a Brother, an innocent Brother of
tender years, whose years required their tuition; and for no other cause, but
because of the blessings which God had bestowed upon him, of which they might
be partakers, by reason of their neernesse in blood unto him, they had killed
him.

*38. Venditus in servitutem.

Joseph was sold into bondage.

The Merchants that bought him were cer aine Merchants of Arabia, that carried
Spices from the Country of Galedena into Egypt, who sold him again to
Potiphar the Steward of King Pharoh his house, in whose service he behaved
himself so well, that his Mistress fell in love with him, and because he
would not yield to her amorous encounters, she accused him to her Husband,
that he attempted to solicit her Chastity, and to defile his bed.

*39. Conjectus in Carcerem.

Joseph was cast into prison.

Upon the false accusation of his Mistress he was cast into prison, where he
remained for the space of two years; but in the end God delivers him, and
verifies the vision which he saw in his dream, that his Brothers sheafes of
Corn worshipped his, and that the Sun, Moon, and Eleven Stars humbled
themselves before him, Exodus 37.

*40. Per aequa and iniqua gratiam Principis qu^runt.

They seek by fraud, bribery, and all other unlawful means to attain their
ends.

Nemo unquam imperium flagitio quaesitum bonis artibus exercuit, says Tacitus,
with whom agrees Josephus in his seventh Book of the antiquity of the Jews,
saying, that he that has attained to any honors and preferments by undue
means, will not stick to use means more pernicious to continue the same. So
did Ioab (as we have said before) to support his magnificence murder Abner and
Amasa; so did Sejanus to support his greatness make love unto Livia the Wife
of Drusus, and procured her to be accessory to her husbands death, as Tacitus
has it in the fourth Book of his Annalls. So did Tigellinus by his wicked
practices, wherein only he did excel, oblige Nero unto him. Tacitus lib. 14.
So did Perennis advise Commodus to take his pleasure in the Country. Dion Cas.
lib. 72.

*41 Ministri facinorum ut exprobrantes aspiciuntur.

Princes ever behold the instruments of villainy with threatening looks.

Antigonus was used to say, Proditores tantisper amo dum produnt, ast ubi
prodiderunt odi, that he loved the Traitor until he had done his work, but
then he hated him; Princes will not endure to look upon such villanes but with
threatening looks; so Nero beheld Anicetus that slew his Mother, as we may read
in the fourteenth book of the Annals of Tacitus; so David beheld the Amalekite
that killed King Saul, and Ioab that slew Abner and Amasa, as we may likewise
read in the beginning of the seventh Book of Josephus of the antiquity of the
Jews, and in the second of Samuel the first chap. so Caesar Herotodus and
Achillas that presented him with the head of Pompey, as Plutarch has it in
Pomp. so Clodovaeus them that betrayed Cannacarius unto him, as Paul. Amilius
has it in Clodov. Quintus Curtins in his fifth and seventh Book of the gests
of Alexander, says, that it was one of the last requests that Darius made unto
Alexander, ut ultionem sceleris erga se perpetrati non negligeret, that he
would not forget to punish the villain that betrayed him, but make him an
example to the ages to come; yet not so much for the wrong done unto him, as
for the safety of Princes, and the terror of such as should dare to lift up
their hands against their sovereigns; and as the some Author says, Alexander
was not unmindefull of him, for after that he had delivered him into the hands
of Oraxes the Brother of Darius to the end to cut off his ears, his nose, and
to torture him, he caused him o be put to death, and rewarded the Soldiers
that brought him unto him.

*42. Exprobrat Hermolaus Alexandrum.

Hermolaus was not afraid to upbraid Alexander.

Ex desperatione crescit audatia, and cum spei nihil est sumit armaformido;
libenter cupit commori qui sinc dubio scit se moriturum, he that is out of all
hope to live will not be afraid to speak his mind freely. Hermolaus being
resolved to dye, upbraided Alexander so far that his aged father Persepolis
was ashamed to hear him, called him Traitor, and would have stopped his mouth;
but Alexander desirous to hear what he would say, suffered him to speak;
whereupon he spoke thus (as Curtius in his eighth Book has it) quota pars
Macedonum saevitiae tuae superest, small is the number of the Macedonians
remaining that have escaped your cruelty. Attalus Philotas, Parmenio,
Lincestes, and Clitus are now dead, they were the men when time was, that
exposed themselves to dangers that you might ride in triumph before your
enemies, and you have well rewarded them; with the blood of some of them you
have besprinkled your table, and not suffered some others of them to dye a
simple death; thus the Captains of your people have you tortured, a pleasant
sight indeed to their enemies the Persians to behold; Paermenio by whom you
slew your servant Attalus, was put to death without judgment, and thus you use
the hands of us poor men to kill one another; and such as even now you
employed to torment others, straightway you command to be tormented by others.

*43. Experti sunt Sytalcles and Cleander.

Sytalcles and Cleander found by experience that Princes will not endure the
instruments of villainy,

When Sytalcles and Cleander, Agathon and Heracleon who by the Kings
appointment had put Parmenio to death, returned from the Province, whereof they
had the government, accusers of all conditions followed them; the Priests
accused them that they had made spoil of every thing, not abstaining from the
Temples and the sacred things; the Virgins and the Ladies of the Province
accused them that they had laid violent hands upon them and ravished them,
especially Cleander, who after he had ravished a Virgin of a Noble Family,
servo suo ut pellicem dederat, gave her to his slave to use as his Concubine,
lib. 10-
yet (says Curtius) the foulness of these enormous offenses did not make them
so odious in the sight of the people, as the killing of Parmenio.

*44. Non patitur quenquam etc.

It is an inconvenience which attends ambition that it never suffers any man to
rest satisfied.

Sensit Alexander testa cum vidit in illa
Magnum habitorem, luv. Sat. 14.
quanto faelicior hic qui
Nil cuperet, quam qui totum sibi posceret orbem.
When Alexander beheld the Cynick in his Tub, he envyed his happiness, saying,
happier is he that looks after nothing then he that desires to have the world
at will; non qui parum habet, sed qui plus cupit, pauper est, says the wise
Heathen, Sen. Ep. 2.
he is not poor that lives in a cottage with content, Cui satis est quod
habet, satis illum constat habere. Cui nihil est quod habet satis illum constat
egere.
but he is poor that possesses the whole world and is not content; what can
he enjoy that is possessed with an unclean spirit? ambitious thoughts are
like so many furies torturing of Orestes, O si pateant pectora ditum, quantus
intus sublimis agit fortuna metusque, says Senec* in Hercule Oetae^, if the
mi^ds of ambitious men were laid open, a man should see them rent in sunder;
for as the body with stripes, so is the mind with ambitious thoughts tortured
and tormented; si cogitationes ejus essent venti, desideria ejus aquae, multo
periculosius esset in animo ejus navigare quam in alto mari, if his thoughts
were wind, and his desires water, it were safer by many degrees to sail in
the Ocean then in his tempestuous stomach, as says Gueverra; one while he
inclines to the cape of the good hope, where being arrived in safety, he
desires to go ultra Sauromatas and glacialem Oceanum, and is as far from his
journeys end as he was at hi^ first setting forth; nunquid enim improbae spei
satis est: eo majora cupiunt quo majora venerant, the greedy minded man is
never satisfied, the more he has the more he desires; wherefore Erasmus
wittily, long periculosior est ebrietas ambitionis quam vini; nam Cyrus
temulentus in comaedia postquam obdormivit sobrie loquutus est; at animus
ambitione ebrius raro aut nunquam expergisci aut resipiscere solet; it is far
more dangerous to surfeit with ambition then wine, for that he that has
surfeited with the one, after he has slept may recover himself, but seldom
or never does the other become himself again. In Titii jecore, in Tantali
fame, in Ixionis rota, and in Sisiphi saxo misera ambitiosorum conditio site
demonstratur per Poetam.

*45 Nutu aut manu loquebatur.

He never expressed himself at home but either by nod or hand.

Our Author out of Tacitus does observe it to be a badge of pride in Pallas
that he never did express himself at home but either by nod or hand; but I
am more charitable, I think it a high point of wisdom in him.

Dum tacet indoctus, poterit cordatus haberi,
Is morbos animi namque tacendo tegit.
This Cosmo de medicis knew well, who being asked by a great Burgomaster, how
he should carry himself in his place, answered, Vesti di rosato e parla poco,
put thy self into the habit of a Senator, and say little; and this the old
Romans knew well at that time when they desired of the Gr^cians a transcript
of their Laws; upon a time the Romans became earnest suitors to the Graecians
to send them a transcript of their laws, which the Graecians taking into
consideration, after a long debate resolved to yield unto their request, and to
send one of the wisest men amongst them with it, with a Commission to deliver
it, if he found them learned and capable of them; if ignorant, then to bring
them back again; of which their resolution the Romans having notice, having no
man within their Dominion that was able to compare in learning with the wise
man of Greece, they resolved to attire a fool in the habit of a Senator to
encounter him, and gave it in charge to him, that he should look gravely, and
say nothing, for that they thought it would be no dishonor to their Nation to
have the wisest man in Greece to gravel and put to a nonplus the veriest fool
in Rome; whereas if they should employ one of their wisemen, and he should be
foiled, it would be a great dishonor to them; the wiseman of Greece arriving
at Rome, the fool in his Senators habit with a low congy salutes him: the
wiseman thereupon held up one of his fingers, intimating thereby that he was
sent by God the Father, which the fool misconstruing, conceiving that he
intended to put out one of his eyes with his finger, held up three of his
fingers, intimating unto him that if he went about with his one finger to put
out one of his eyes, he would with two of his fingers pUt out both his, and
with the third disfigure his face: which the Grecian interpreted that he was
sent by the three Persons in the Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost; the Grecian then opened his hand, intimating thereby that
God being the fountain of goodness had sent him with their laws unto them,
which the fool misconstruing, thinking that by the opening of his hand he
meant to give him a blow on the ear, clutcht his fist intending to requite him
with a bloody nose, which the Grecian interpreted that he meant that God in
his hand was able to hold the universe; and so esteeming of the Romans by the
gestures of the fool to be a wise generation, he left his transcript with
them; Ecco, (says my Author) come questo savio filosofo Greeeo futacendo
vinto da un pazzo Romano, behold how a wise man of Greece was deceived by a
fool of Rome that held his peace. Silence by the ancients has ever been held
a commendable virtue; and therefore did they oftentimes express themselves in
silent and dumb shows. Sartorius having a desire to disanimate the Portugals
from fighting with the Romans whilst their Army was united, caused to be
delivered to a weak old man a stout and warlike horse, and to a lusty young man
a poor weak jade, commanding them both to pull off their tails; the young man
pulled and pulled, and pulled again, and often pulled down the jade, yet could
not pull off his tail; the old man took another course, he did not attempt to
pull off his tail at once, but pelo a pelo, hair by hair, by little and
little he pulled it off: intimating unto them that it was but lost labor to
set upon the Romans whilst their Army was united, but if they could divide it,
they might do some good upon them; the like is reported of Scilurus, King of
the Scythians, who drawing near unto his end, called for his quiver of
arrows, and in the presence of his Sons, being eighty in number, he caused
one of his servants to try whether he could break them in the quiver or no,
who made many attempts but in vain; then he commanded him to take them out
one by one, and then he broke them without any difficulty; thereby intimating
unto them, that so long as they were united, and lived in Peace one with
another, no power was able to hurt them; but if they fell to discord, they
would all by degrees come to nothing. In like manner did Tarquine discover
himself to his son Sextus; Sextus having taken many captives, sent to his
Father to know what he should do with them, who not willing to discover
himself by his speech to the Messenger, took him aside into his Garden, and
with his knife cut off the tops of the herbs, and cast them on the ground,
whereby he gathered that Tarquin would either have them banished or put to
death; in the same manner did Agesilaus reprove the Sophister. Agesilaus upon a
time hearing a Sophister making a great flourish in a business of small
consequence, showed him a great shoe and a little foot; thereby intimating
unto him how unseemly it was for a man to exceed a mean. Thus did the Ancients
oftentimes by signs and mutes express themselves; non tacuisse nocet, nocet
esse loquutum, says the Poet, the overflowing of the tongue does often bring
shame and dishonor to a man, but seldom does the ebbing any harm; wherefore
the wiseman in Apelles shop was pictured with his finger on his mouth, and with
wide ears, to show that a man should hear much and say little.

* 46. Fastus hujus species maxim hodie usitata.

This kind of Pride is come into fashion in our days.

Solomon in the first of Ecclesiastes asks this question, estne aliquid de
quo dicitur aspice hoc novum est, is there any new thing under the Sun? is
there any thing now that has not been in times past, or was there any thing in
times past that shall not be again in time to come? ut pedem primo intra
domum ponas, as Seneca has it in his sixth Book de benefici^s, the wall and the
first entrance into the house was much stood upon in the days of old, and is
it not come again in fashion in our days? stellarum decursus quicquid
praeteriit repetit; observa orbem rerum (says he in his 36 Epistle) in se
remeantium, and videbis nihil extingui, sed vicibus descendere acresurgere,
there is a kind of revolution of things in the World, and no fashion now that
has not been in the days of old.

*47. Avaritia bellua immanis, intolleranda.

Avarice is a Beast insufferable.

The naturalists do distinguish the Beasts of the field to be either Beasts of
prey, or mild and gentle Beasts; if they are Beasts of prey, they are of a
ravenous nature, live upon the spoil of harmless creatures, and are
unprofitable both in life and death, as Vipers, Tigres, Woolfes, Foxes, and the
like; if they are mild and gentle Beasts, then they are of a sociable nature,
live upon such things as the earth naturally brings forth, and are profitable
both in life and death, as the Sheep, the Dear, the Conies, and the like; dum
vivit vipera mordet and veneno enecat, and post mortem odore sanieque inficit;
dum vivit ovis lacte untrit, lana vestit, and cum moritur utile corium praebet,
totaque esculenta est; the Coveteous man is a Beast of prey, a ravenous Beast,
who whilst he lives morsu vipereo by his cut-throate dealing spoils and
depopulates wheresoever he comes: and when he dies venenato exemplo by his
ill example poisons and infects all that are near him. Rablais has a tale of
a Mare, which Phaio King of Numidia sent out of Africa, who coming into a Wood
near Orleans, containing in length 35 miles, and in breadth 37, with her very
tail in a moment hewed it down, par-mi par-la comme un fae^cher fait d'
herbs, as the Author says, as a mower would do a handful of grass with
the sithe. I cannot compare our Beast here to any thing more aptly then to this
Mare, who by an Art which he has, is able to throw down Towns and Steeples,
and like another Circe turn the Inhabitants into stones, having eaten them up.
Seneca in his 60 Epistle admires the nature of the Beast, and makes an enquiry,
why nature gave him so little a body, and so great a belly; Taurus (inquit)
paucissimis jugerum pascuis impletur, una silva elephantis plurimis sufficit;
homo and terra pascitur and mari; quid ergo tam insatiabilem nobis natura alvum
dedit, cum tam modica corpora dedisset, ut vastissimormm ed^^issimorumque
animalium aviditatem vinceremus? minime. The bull (says he) is satisfied with
a few Pastures, one Wood will suffice many Elephants, but Sea and Land will not
suffice this Creature; why has nature given us so little bodies and so great
bellies, that we should surpass the most devouring Creatures? no certainly;
the son of Syrack demands qui sibi ipsi malus est, cuinam erit bonus? to whom
will he be good that is not good to himself? certainly he will be a good
prey for his Prince, a good Mark for a thief to shoot at, and a good
companion for Judas to have his habitation in the air, (...).

*48. Dicta in seulciscuntur.

They punish words spoken against themselves in a high degree.

Our Author notes it to be a badge of cruelty in Pallas, to take advantage of
words, and to prosecute the speakers with severity; and indeed it is so, if
they be spoken in heat and choler; for though the giving of the lie (as Paulus
Aemylius observes) makes a deeper impression in a noble mind then any wound;
yet in point of honor if the party shall acknowledge his offense, and
withal, that he is sorry for it, it is a sufficient satisfaction: but I make
a great difference between words hastily spoken, and words spoken out of rancor
and malice upon some injuries conceived to have been done; as if it shall fall
out, that between two Merchants that have traded together, some differences
have grown, and the one shall maliciously give out of the other, that he will
be a bankerupt within such a time, and general notice is taken of it; no
private acknowledgement can be a satiafaction for this public wrong. So in
point of judgment if a man has had a cause depending before a judge in the
consistory, who has given sentence against him, and he shall maliciously give
forth that the judge is corrupt, of which public notice is taken, no private
acknowledgement can satisfy this public wrong; so in the case of a Peer of
the Realm, if any one shall give forth, that he is a sower of Sedition, and a
disturber of the Peace of the Commonwealth, though he will in private
acknowledge his offense, yet it is not sufficient to satisfy the wrong which
he has done; for public scandals ought to receive exemplary punishment.

*49. Divisiones serunt and alunt.

They sow Sedition, and maintain a Faction amongst the people.

Some have been of opinion, that a Faction is necessary in a Commonwealth, by
reason that if one side should mutiny, the other would be ready to suppress
them; again by this means a Prince should have intelligence of all things
that pass; but the most judicious are of opinion that there is nothing more
dangerous to the safety of a Prince; for that men being naturally fickle, and
desirous of changes and alterations, will be ever ready to revolt, and turn to
the contrary faction; again a Prince cannot carry himself so equally and
indifferently, but one of the factions will conceive that he is against them,
and then to fortify themselves will have correspondence with his Enemy;
wherefore when the King of France sent one of his Governors to pacify a
tumult, which was occasioned by reason of a Faction, the Governor told them,
that it would be very distasteful to his Master to hear of a Faction within
his Dominion, though the Faction did incline to himself; for where there is a
Faction, there must be an adverse part; and his Master would have all such as
lived under him to be his friends; of whose opinion was Commines, as appears
in his first and sixth book, where he will not allow of a faction in a settled
government, unless among the Ladies of the Court, or the servants of a private
family, to the end the one might have an eye to the other in the masters
absence; and to that end did Marcus Cato ever maintain such a faction in his
family, of whom Plutarch says, quod inimi^itias saepe inter servos familiae
suae conserere solebat.

*50. Lex Talionis.

The law of Talio.

This Law was induced by the Pythagoreans, by the Authority of Rhadamantus (as
Aristotle has it in the fifth book of his Ethics) (...) it is approved by the
Turks, Alcor. Azo.
and was executed upon the Bishop of Verdom by Lewis the eleventh as Commines
has it in his sixth book; and certainly a more just Law cannot be then to
punish the projector, and him that induces innovations into the Commonwealth
in Perillus his bull, then to squize the extortioner, and to swill the
blood-sucker in blood.

Nam si quis quod fecit patiatur justissima lex est.

* 51 Perilli taurus.

Perillus first felt the punishment of his new inventions.

Perillus an artificer found out a kind of torment to punish Delinquents which
was never heard of before, being a Bull of brass, into which burning fiery hot
they were to be thrown; which being given by him to Phalaris, he caused him
as a just reward for his innovation first to season it.

Artibus ipse suis tauri fabricator aheni,
Primus inexpertum Siculo cogente tyranno,
Sensit opus. --
* 52. Non sufficit been caepisse.

It is not sufficient to begin well.

If he that plants a vineyard be not as careful to hedge it in as he was to
plant it, he shall receive but little fruit of his labor; if he that builds a
ship be not as careful to furnish it with tacklings as he was to build it,
his ship will do him but little service; if he that wins a Castle, be not as
provident in the keeping of it as he was in the getting, it had been better
for him in the beginning to have sat still and done nothing; in vain do we
plow, sow, reap, thrash, winnowe, and bring our corn unto the mill, if the
mill be out of order, and shall spoil it after so much pains taken; finis
coronat opus; if Nero his last days had been like to his quinquennium, he had
been one of the most renowned Princes of the world; if Tiberius had ended his
reign as he began, he had excelled Augustus: but because they desisted the
ways of virtue, their faults were more conspicuous, and it had been better for
them never to have known them, then having known them to abandon them again,
so as it is not sufficient to begin well.

* 53. Fortuna caeca nos efficit caecos.

Fortune being blind, blinds them whom she doteth upon.

The Heathens of old time deified fortune, (under which name they comprehended
worldly prosperity) for a blind Goddess, that sits at the door of felicity
and keeps out mortals from coming to the tables of the Gods, Improba non novit
leges fortunae; illa odit plerumque bonos blanditur iniquis.
that rules upon earth without reason and understanding, that makes fools her
favorites and wisemen her vassals, that is as variable as the Moon, and whom at
first she most affects, at last she most neglects, that begets children
like herself, mad, and blind, and brutish, lifts them up to the clouds,
where she suffers them for a time to domineere over the inferior bodies, and
afterward to make her self merry, throws them down with a vengeance, and
sits laughing at them.

Ridendo fallere novi, Sub risus specie deprimo quem que mei.

*54. Ne quenquam suorum.

Mecenas counseled Augustus not to suffer any of his Peers to grow too great.

It has been a custom amongst the Turks (as we may read in their general
History in the reign of Amurath the third) for the Princes as soon as they have
been Crowned, to put to death their younger brethren, that so the eyes of their
Subjects may wholly be fixed upon them; in other Countries it has been a
custom to oppress and keep under the Nobility for fear of Rebellion; but
these bloody and barbarous customs have been used only amongst barbarous men,
and in debellatis regionibus, and in Countries that have been conquered; but in
every Christian settled Commonwealth the Peers are to the Prince as the stars
to the firmament, their greatness is his glory; for the greater they are, the
greater must he needs be that commands them; it was the common saying of
Ptolomy King of Egypt, quod regalius est super divites dominari quam divitem
fore; when Maximilian the Emperor would at any time set forth the glory and
magnificence of the Roman Empire, he was used to say, that the Emperor of
Germany was Rex regum, for that he had a superintendency over such as had
power to make laws, raise Soldiers, and coin money, whereas other Princes had
not so; when a controversy grew between two great Lords upon this occasion,
quod alter altero potiorem se esse dixisset, that the one should say he was a
better man then the other, it was thus decided, that the one should acknowledge
that the other commanded better men then he. The wise King says, in
multitudine populi consistit dignitas Regis, in the multitude of Subjects
consists the glory of a Prince; Huc valde pertinet illud Castilionis; si
Circe aliqua Gallos omnes in feras commutaret, nonne Gallorum Regem Principem
despicatissimum diceres, etiamsi imperium in tot belluas haberet? e cont^ a si
omnia armenta quae in montibus circumvagantur in potentes and sapientes
transfererntu^, nonne pastores harum belluarum tanquam dominos po^entissimos
aestimares?
it is as true, in magnitudine populi, in the greatness of Subjects consists
the glory of a Prince; every mean cotrager has pira and cerasa, Pears and
Cherryes in his Orchard; but every mean Cottager has not Palmas and Cedros,
Palm and Cedar trees; every mean Gentleman has his horses and dogs, but no^
his Pumiliones, Leones, and Tigres, his Dwarfs, Lions, and Tigers; Animalia
rara apud principes olim in pretio fuere. Dicitur de Ludovico, ii quod valde
operosus erat in raris animalibus comparandis; e Britannia canes grandi pecunia
summa comparabat, ex Sicilia mulos, a Neapoli spetiosos equos, ab Africa genus
parvulorum leonum. Com. lib. 9.
these rarityes are ensigns of greatness, and provided for Princes an great
personages. Every petty Prince and mean Lord has the command of macellarios,
usurarios and ferrarios, of Butchers, Brookers and Braziers; but every mean
Lord has not a command of a loyal gentry and prudent nobility; Renegathoes
are fit attendants for Turks and Tyrants, but for Christian Princes Potentes
and Nobiles; Ier. 1. Lam. 15.
wherefore the Prophet Jeremy does not complain in his lamentations, that God
took from him his macellrios vel usurarios, sed abstulit magnificos meos de
medio mei, he took his nobles from him; but yet as it is in the natural body,
if the foot shall swell and equalize the head in greatness, there is a
depravation of nature, and a deformity in the body; so it is in the politic;
if any one of the Peers shall so far outstrip his fellows in magnificence
that the rest must depend upon him, here are two Suns in the Firmament, and
this body is out of order; wherefore Maecenas wisely councelled Augustus that
he should not suffer any of his Peers to grow too great; what inconveniences
have grown by suffering of Peers to grow too great, see Com. lib. 3. of the
Earl of Warwick, lib. 4. Of the Constable of France, Iean du Seres. Of the
Majors of the Kings Palace in Clotaire. Clovis 2. Thiarry 2. Childerick 5. and
in Pippin, and Dion. Case. of Sejan. lib. 57 and 59.

* 55. Galfridus Iustitiarius Angliae.

Geffry a Iustitiary of England by reason of his allies was more feared then
beloved of the King.

Offenses are sometimes taken, not given; Matthew Paris speaking of this
Iustitiary gives this Encomium of him that he was firmissima regni columna,
and that after his death the Kingdom was quasi navis sine gubernaculo, Mat.
Paris. in Ioh, An. 1213.

* 56. Fatum potentiae est quod raro sempiterna.

It is destinated unto greatness not to be of long continuance.

The world by the ancients is aptly termed a game of inconstancy, wherein there
is nothing but shufling and cutting; the Card that now is on the top, anon is
in the bottom, anon discarded. Tib who whilome ruled as Commanders, the next
dealing, if trump withdraw his Colors, are of no better esteem then a common
Card; vix horae momentum nonnunquam inter est inter solium and solitudinem
(says Seneca) heur and malheur se suivent tour a tour, good luck and bad
follow each other turn by turn; O dii boni (says the Orator) quid est in
hominis vita diu! O good God what is there of any continuance in the World!
(...), such as are most powerful with their Princes are aptly compared to
counters which now stand for a ^ound, anon for a Cipher; every mortal thing is
fading, fleeting and transitory; De Ludovico iidicitur quod dicere solebat
natural hominis novitate delectari, ideoque crebro mutasse cubicularios. Com.
lib. 9.
The minds of men are desirous of changes and alterations, and those whom we
now most affect, anon after we most neglect. Besides the many examples which
our author has set forth, see one memorable one in the general History of the
Turks, in the reign of Solomon the magnificent of Abrahem, the Vizier Basse
President of the Council.

* 57. Hugo de Burgo proto-justitiarius Angliae.

Hugh de Burge chief Justice of England.

Invidia virtutis comes; besides the testimony which our Author has given of
Hugh de Burgh, Matthew Paris goes further, and says, that he was miles
strenuus and fidelis, Constable of Dover Castle, which he stoutly defended
against Lewis of France and the Barons of England, in the behalf of the King;
who when Lewis sent unto him after the Kings death, Mat. Par. in Ioh. An. 1213.
to have him deliver up the Castle, with large promises that he would make him
one of his Council, and confer upon him many honors, returned this answer,
though the King be dead, yet he has left behind him filios and filias qui ei
debent succedere, and that to the uttermost of his power he would in their
behalf defend and keep it, Mat. Par. in H. 3. initio.
ne illud turpiter reddendo notam proditionis incurreret: yet notwithstanding
by the instigation of Peter Bishop of Winchester, the King did not only
withdraw his affections from him, and deprive him of his Offices, but
prosecuted him with all severity.

* 58. Plebe vix manibus temperante.

The people hardly forbearing to lay hands upon him.

Demosthenes being banished Athens, lifting up his hands toward the City, made
a bitter invective against it, saying, (...) (...); O Minerva that have the
government of the City committed unto thee, why do thou harbor within thee
three most insufferable beasts, the Nightbird, the Dragon, and the
Common People? he ranks the multitude in Athens with the most unlucky
creatures; and not without cause; (...); for the common sort of people in
Athens are a most ungrateful and barborous kind of people, persecuting them
most, that have most deserved of them; nullum fretum, nullus Euripus, tantas,
tam varias habet agitationes fluctuum; the Sea does not so often ebb and flow,
as the unstable multitude change their minds; if one sheep transgress the
bounds of the pasture, all the rest will follow after, and for no other reason,
but because he went before.

When Earl Vlrick Ciliensis was banished by Ladislaus, the peoples hatred was
such unto him, that had not the Marquess of Brandenburgh brought him to the
Gates of Vienna, the people would have stoned him; yet when the King the next
year received him into favor again, Aeneas Sil. Hist. Europ. c. 22.
eadem plebs (as Aeneas Sylvius observes) quae paulo ante l^tum and lapides in
fugientem jactare tentavit sternere viam floribus qua redeunti transitus fuit,
non dubitavit; the very same people that threw dirt in his face the year
before, strowed flowers in his way the year after When the Nobility of Hungary
deposed Maria, and set up Carolus Parvus, the common people cried, susus and
colus sunt arma mulierum, and imperium mulieri non aliter quam clitella bovi
convenit; down with her, down with her, for that it is against the Law of
nature, that men should be subject unto women; Spindles and Distaffes do
better become women then Scepters: yet not long after, as soon as ever he was
Crowned, Bons. dec. 3. lib. 1. ^eru^ Hungar.
they fell off from him, and quem inique (as says Bonfinius) imprudenterque
multitudo affectavit, mutatis subinde animis oderit, whom not long before they
so much affected without any reason, within a short time after they hated and
neglected; cum fortuna statque caditque fides populi.

* 59 Inquilini sui putant juris esse.

Natives think it their Birth right to be governed by men of their own Nation.

Some have been of opinion, that there is no better way to advance the good of
a City then to open the gates to let in strangers into it; for that thereby the
City is empeopled, which is the glory of a City; but these men neither took
into their consideration either that of Eunius, Moribus antiquis res stat
Romana, virisque, that thereby the foundation of the City, the ancient Laws
and Customs are endangered, for that strangers desire to be governed by their
own Laws; or the seditious and tumultuous Insurrections which thereby usually
are occasioned, for that Natives will not endure that strangers should carry
away the fat and sweetness of their Country; or the Laws of Lycurgus, who by
his Laws; advenas in urbe residentes abegit ne alieujus noxae doctores forent;
others have gone further, and have thought it a special means to advance the
good of a City to suffer strangers to execute places of authority there,
because thereby correspondency is kept with Foreign Nations; but King James
utterly opposes it, and therefore amongst many other things which he gives
in charge to Prince Henry in his (...), he gives him this Caveat, cavendum
est ut ne peregrino homini publicum mupus committas; and Lipsius shows the
inconveniences; thereby (says he) the Prince draws much hatred upon himself;
for when the Natives of a Country, where many able men are to be found, do
perceive the Prince to prefer strangers before others, they do alien their
affections from them, and oftentimes betake themselves to the service of
Foreign Princes; Again, the Commonwealth cannot be well governed, for that it
is impossible that strangers should know the manners and conditions of the
people, or the state of the Commonwealth in any degree like unto Natives; or
if they did, yet generally they fail in fidelity and true affection; nam qui
potest in alienam remp. been agere, in qua illud semper cogitant, mihi istis
nec seritur nec metitur? how is it possible that they should advance the good
of a Commonwealth, that have always in their mouths, we neither sow or mow
there, win or lose, whither it flourish or decline? Again the Counsels of
strangers have been ever fatal to all Commonwealths. Alexander male audire
caepit, cum Persas audivit, Alexander then began to fall into exorbitant
courses when he listened to the Counsel of the Persians; and then did the
Roman States begin to decline, when the Graecians and other strangers bore the
sway there; it is observed that as soon as ever Charles the Eighth, King of
France, placed Frenchmen to rule over the Neapolitans, by whose assistance he
had driven the Spaniards out of Naples, the Neapolitans suddenly revolted; and
that as soon as William King of Sicily had made a Frenchman his Chancellor,
the Nobility of Sicily conspired together, and in one night slew all the
Frenchmen in the Country; wherefore take this for a rule (says one) as it is a
certain sign of a funeral cum vespilones, when they that are appointed to
carry the dead come into a house, so it is a certain sign of a declining
state, when strangers are preferred to sit at the stern, and to govern the
Commonwealth.

*60. Plerumque isti atque omnes etc.

Both they and their adherents are ruinated.

It is fabled of Perseus, that when he went to wage war with Medusa as
against the Common Enemy, all the Gods lent him a helping hand; Apollo
furnished him with a headpiece, gave him wisdom and understanding to consult,
Mercury with wings speedily to execute what deliberately was agreed upon: and
the other Gods furnish him with other arms fit for a Soldier; and so being
armed Cape a Pee, he adventured upon her, and overcame her; a Traitor in a
state is like Medusa in Hiberia, hateful both to God and men; he may flourish
for a time, but on a sudden he shall perish as if he had never been. In the
first and second Scene of the Tragedy, Sejanus may have his statue erected
among the Princes of the Nations, may be courted and honored as a Prince,
have solemn prayers made for him, Dion Cas. lib. 7.
and the day of his Nativity celebrated, but in the end of it we shall see his
statue demolisht, the day of his Execution proclaimed holy day, Dion Ca^. lib.
58.
and the people villifying him and insulting over him; nay, more we shall see
his children dragd to Execution and thrown into the Gemonyes; Tac. lib 2. Arnal.
his beloved daughter, ( cui forma eximia fama integra, habilitas corporis, and
ingenium tali corpore dignum; so excellently adorned and proportioned both in
the outward lineaments of her body, and the inward endowments of her mind that
nature could not have framed a more perfect creature) crying, ob quod delictum,
and quo traheretur, neque facturum ultra, alas, what have I done, whether will
you carry me, forgive me this one time, I will never do so again; nay, more
we shall see this beautiful Lady, who by reason of her years was scant
sensible of the punishment, not to be permitted to die a simple death; for it
being inauditum among the Romans to strangle a Virgin, she must be delivered
to the common hangman to be deflowred, and then strangled, and cast into the
common jakes; nay we shall not only see Sejanus and his children, but his
friends and adherents suffer for his sake; for as Dion observes, Dion. Cas.
lib. 58.
si nullum aliud crimen objici poterat, satis erat ad erogandam poenam quod
amicus Sejani fuit, it was a sufficient cause to question any man for his life
that he was a friend to Sejanus; and so much is specified in that Pithy
Apology of M. Terentius in Tacitus. Tac. lib. 6. Annal.
M. Terent. a Roman knight, being indicted and arraigned for that he was a
friend to Sejanus, confesses and avoideth, fateor (says he) me amicum fuisse
Sejano, and ut essem expetisse, and postquam adeptus eram laetatum; I confess
I was Sejanus his friend, and desired so to be, and was glad I had obtained
his friendship; for I saw, ut quisque Sejano intimus, ita ad Caesaris amicitiam
validus: contra, quibus offensus erat, metu ac sordibus afflictabantur; as
every one was inward with Sejanus, so was he graced by Caesar; contrariwise
such as were neglected by him, lived in fear and were oppressed; admit Sejanus
was advanced without desert, what is that to us? non est nostrum inquirere
quibus de causis super cateros tu quempiam extollis; tibi summm judicium dii
dedere, nobis obsequii gloria relicta est; aspicimus cui plurima juvandi
nocendique potentia datur, quam Sejanum habuisse nemo negavit; It belongs not
unto us to censure him whom thou do advance above other men, nor to enquire
for what cause: judgment belongs unto thee, to us obedience; we look who has
most power to do us good or harm, which Sejanus to have had no man will deny;
this was a part of his plea; but had he gone no further, he had suffered as
many others did; but he goes on, now (my Lords of the Senate) I shall desire
your Lordships to take into your considerations not Sejanus his ultimum diem,
but his sexdecem annos; if Sejanus became an enemy to the Commonwealth, and
plotted Treason in his latter time, let them suffer that did adhere unto him in
those his conspiracies; but if Sejanus during the sixteen years that I
followed him, carried himself loyally to Tiberius, I hope your Lordships will
not confound the times past with the times present, and include me in the
number of them that did adhere unto him in his conspiracy because I was once
his friend; and so wisely distinguishing of the times he saved his life; yet
hence we learn with what difficulty they escape that have any dependency upon
such as are Enemies to the Common Wealth.

'61. Nihil efficacius Religione sciebat.

He knew there was no better way to effect his design then to make religion
the cloak.

It has been a saying of old, that the whole world consists of fools, and
that they are the most notorious fools, that think themselves the wisest men;
but it is most certain, universum agere histrioniam, which the Graecians call
(...), that the whole world consists of dissemblers, and that he that will be
free from them must seek an habitation (as Aeneas Sylvius observes) ultra
Saurom^tas and glacialem Oceanum under the North Pole; perpauci, immo nulli,
qui non aliud externe, aliud interne, aliud vestitu, aliud vna praedicant;
there are few or none to be found that do intend what they speak, or practice
what they profess: all are dissemblers. intonsum caput, circumtorta barba,
torva supercilies, multoties tegunt animum evangelicum; econtra cucullus and
pallium, vestis cineritia and zona coriacea animum diabolicum; under a rude and
rustic vale is couched oftentimes a great deal of honesty, and under the the
vale of simplicity and sanctity a great deal of villainy; there are diverse
degrees of hypocrites in the world, but amongst them the last that I have
mentioned is the chiefest; for without doubt there are none so abominable as
they whom our Savior compares to the Scribes and Pharisees, crepantes Christum
Christum and Templum domini, that make religion a vale to cover their villainy;
an open enemy is easily avoided: but a white Devil, Arsenick infused into
Nectar and Ambrosia, an enemy that fights under the banner of love and
familiarity, and dissimulation gilded over with sanctity, is hardly avoided,
Pippin used religion as a cloak to effect his design; see Du. Seres in
Childer. in fine.

*62. Nihil tam utile quam brevem esse potestatem.

There is nothing so requisite as that great offices should not be of long
continuance.

It has been a question amongst such as have written of Commonwealths,
whether it be better for the CommonWealthe to have Magistrates perpetual or
changeable; and without question it is better both for Prince and People to
have them changeable; for if they have any command of Provinces and Armies, and
are mischeivously disposed, they have opportunity to effect their designs
having a perpetuity in their places; and the very conceit that they may within
a short time be private men, will deterr them from committing diverse
exorbitances; yet without doubt it is not good for the CommonWealth for the
Prince often to change them, and that for diverse reasons; first, the
Commonwealth would suffer much prejudice by it, haud pareit populo regnum
breve; for knowing their time to be but short, they would like the evil
spirit in the Gospel go about seeking whom they might devour, and make a prey
of every thing; and therefore Tiberius being asked, quare ministris diutissime
utebatur, adeo ut plerique iisdem muneribus consuescerent, why he would suffer
his officers to continue their places until they came to be old men, gave
them this answer, Tac. lib 1. Annal.
hirudines quae multo sanguine rumpuntur, quiescere solent, recentium vero
morsus sunc acerrimi; he that is once full will like the leech that is glutted
fall off of himself, but if he should often change them, they would like new
leeches suck out the very marrow of their bones; to which purpose the answer of
the fox in the Apologue is very pertinent, who being taken in a gin, and being
much annoied by the flies, was asked by a goose whether he should drive them
away: but the crafty fox answered, deh non far par dio, for Gods sake let them
alone; for if you should drive away those, others would come in their places
that will more annoy me; again the Commonwealth would in a short time be
turned up side down; for that there being as many several minds in men as
there are men in the world, innovations would daily be induced, for that new
Lords would ever be devising of new laws; again ars imperandi being ars
difficillima, there must be time to learn this art, which being attained
unto, then to remove them were to remove a master, to induce his scholar;
again able men would not be found to execute those places, for when they know
that within a short time they shall be removed, they will not forgo the course
of life which they are in for an uncertain preferment; again no sedition
(which is the principal cause why the Prorogation of Magistracy is cried down)
is hence occasioned; for when deserving men attain to dignities per gradum, no
man will repine at them as Quicquid subito inclarescit obnoxium est invidiae,
unde vox odiosa (...) apud Graecos, apud Romanos novorum hominum Cognomen, apud
utrosque t^rrae filiorum and e Caelo delapsorum.
they usually do at such as attain unto them per saltum and for money only; so
that where the Writers of Commonwealths cry down Prorogation of
Magistracies, they do intend ^o other then such as in the Persian Dominion was
the office of Chiliarchus, in Naples of the Demarchus, among the Turks the
President of the Council, whom they called the Vizier Bassa, in France the
Majors of the Kings Palace, and among the Romans the Dictators.

*63. Decemviri.

The Decemviri were ten select men chosen out of the Nobility that did govern
the Roman state until such time as the laws of the twelve Tables, which they
had gathered out of the ancient Greek Laws, were confirmed amongst them, they
held their places without limitation of time, and during their Government, the
authority of the Senators, Consuls and Tribunes were in suspense.

*64. Dictatores.

The Dictators among the Romans had rigidam and regiam potestatem, a royal
power in their hands for the time, and were never chosen but upon special
occasion, and continued no longer then for the space of six months, at which
time they were tied under a great penalty to yield up their places; according
to Livy they were set up in the year 253. after the building of Rome, to the
end to suppress the sudden insurrections and tumultuous rebellions which
were frequent about that time among the common people; the Graecians called him
that held the office of Dictatorship (...) quasi duplicem Consulem or bis
Consulem, because he had fraenum Reip. the whole power of the Commonwealth in
his hand; he had power to proclaim peace and war, and in his power were the
lives and estates of the Citizens; when he went abroad, four and twenty
torches, and as many axes, as ensigns of his power, threatening vengeance^ to
such as should oppose that, were carried before him, and whatsoever he decreed,
pro numine habebatur.

* 65 Ostracismus inventus est Atheniensibus.

Amongst the Athenians the punishment of Ostracisme.

The punishment of Ostracisme was a banishment for ten years (as Aristotle
has it) and it was first invented by Chlisthenes (as appears in Sigonius) he
manner whereof was thus; Arist. lib. 3. polit. c. 9.
Sig. lib. 1. Athenien.
on a certain day every Plebean brought a Shell to the Market place, where the
Archontes who were the chief Officers of the City met them, Diod. Sic. lib.
11. Bibleoth.
and took an account first of the number of the persons that brought the
shells; for if they were not full six thousand, there was no sentence given;
that being done, they received the Shells of every one; and if the name of any
man was found in the greater part of the shells, he was forthwith by the sound
of a Trumpet pronounced to be banished. This punishment Aristides underwent,
Plu^. in Aristid.
for that there being some difference between him and Themistocles,
Themistocles prevailed with the people, for that he was grown popular by
reason of his justice and integrity, to have him banished by the sentence of
Ostracisme. Plutarch has a pretty Tale of a Countryman who going to Market
with his shell, met with Aristides, and not knowing him, wished him to write
down Aristides name upon it. Aristides then demanding of him, whether the man
whose name he would have written down ever did him wrong, answered, no; Neque
est mihi notus, verum valde stomachor, quod passim justum dici audiam. Neither
is he known unto me, but it troubles me much that he is a most just man. This
punishment was not inflicted upon Malefactors, but upon such as were grown
popular by reason of their virtues: Plut. in Pericle and Nicea.
Cymon underwent it, that had so often enricht Athens with the spoils of their
enemies, and because it was inflicted upon so mean a man as Hiperbolus, to
whom it was accounted rather an honor then a punishment; it was utterly
aoblisht in the Athenian Commonwealth.

* 66 Syracusanis Petalismus.

Among the Syracusans the punishment of Petalisme.

Petalisme was a banishment for five years, which was first induced into the
City of Syracuse upon this occasion; Plut. in Dionys.
the government being Aristocraticall, there was one Tyndaris, that endeavored
to reduce the power into his own hands, which the other Lords perceiving made
this Law, that if any one should attempt to make himself absolute Lord of the
City, that his name should be written in an Olive Leaf, and delivered unto
him, and without any other Ceremony he should be banished for five years; by
which means the Government in time came to be changed: the Lords banished one
another, and the Common people came to be Governors: So the Commonwealth from
an Aristocratie became a Democratie: Nam destitutis bonis viris rep. pessimus
quisque sibi Magistratus poscere caepit.

*67. Periculosum est ut authoritas in filios descendat.

It is a dangerous thing to suffer authority to descend.

It is a Maxim in the Law, that if a man do enter into another man's
possessions, and hold them peaceably all his lifetime, and dye seized, of them,
that the true owner cannot regain them by his entry, but must bring his action,
and in a legal way recover them, because by the continuance of possession
without interruption, and the dying seized, the Law does suppose (until the
contrary do appear) that he has a right due to them. In Eclesiasticall cases
nothing is more frequent, then for Parishioners to plead a Prescription per
modum decimandi, after two or three Successions, and so debar the present
Incumbent to demand his Tithes in kind, whereas the Composition in the
beginning was voluntary. It holds in Cases of Honors and Dignities; if a
Prince shall graciously confer any great office upon any of his Peers during
his life, and after suffer his heir to enjoy it during his, the next heir
will not stick to claim it, as his inheritance; so did the Majors of the Kings
Palace in France to the utter extirpation of the Royal blood; wherefore Q.
Fabius Maximus, whose Father, Grandfather, and great Grandfather had been
consuls, and he himself five times, seeing the Senate fully determined to
confer that honor upon his Son, (tendering more the welfare of the
Commonwealth then his own private family) earnestly desired them, us Fabiae
genti consulatus non amplius deferretur, that they would not settle that honor
upon his house, or make choice of his son; not because he thought him
unworthy, or less deserving, then any of his ancesters, but because he
thought it a thing of dangerous consequence, ut summum imperium in una domo
continuaretur: Nobile quidem dictum, and tali viro dignum; utinam Germani
imperatores summum imperium tanquam jus haereditarum sibi vindicantes illud in
memoriam revocent.

*68. Necessarium est ut princeps plures oculos, etc.

Aristotle admonishes Princes to use many eyes and hands, etc.

It is fabled of Juno that in revenge of the wrong which Jupiter did her, in
bringing forth Pallas without her assistance, she petitioned the Gods that
she might conceive and bring forth a Child without him, and that the gods
granted her request, and she brought forth the Monster Typhon, who unnaturally
rebelled against Jupiter; such as seek with the strength of their own brain
to manage the affairs of a State, bring forth Children like unto Typhon, that
disturb the peace and tranquillity thereof.

(...), the burden of a Kingdom is too heavy for one man to bear: Tiberius
being tendered it, at the first modestly refused it, Tacit. l. 1. Annal.
because of the weight of it: if Thales himself (says Livy) were King, Live.
l. 44.
and would undertake to manage all affairs with the strength of his own
brain, superbum potius quam sapientem judicarem, I should judge him rather to
be presumptuous then wise. Moses the wise Lawgiver, Numb. 11.
considering the weakness of humane frailty and his own infirmity
acknowledged, non possum solus sustinere hunc populum, quia gravis est mihi.
Pericles is commended because he ever used the assistance of skillful men in
the mannaging of the affairs committed to his charge; Amirat. l. 5. dissect.
polit.
in rebus forensibus, the assistance of Maenippus, in rebus domesticis, of
Esialtes. Metiochus is condemned, and the fiddlers sang it every where,
Metiochus est dux, aedilis, omnia, pereat; wherefore as that Merchant cannot
be said to be provident, that adventures his whole estate in one bottom; so
he shall never deserve those attributes that have been given to the most
renowned Princes, that relies wholly upon his own brain, or the judgment of
any one else.

Quid gravis Antenor, Prianus quid
suadeat ipse,
Consule, queis aetas long a magistra fuit,
Is good Council, and not to be neglected by such as sit at the stern, and
govern the Commonwealth; magna negotia magnis adjutoribus indigent, many
weighty affairs do need the assestance of many ablemen; let a man search into
all ages, and he shall find that great States did ever use diverse
Councillors; one man may see some few things; at esse debent (as Xenophon has
it) (...), Princes ought to use many eyes. King James in his (...) to the
Prince gives him this advertisement; ne uno eodemque homine in omnibus negotiis
utaris: Xenoph. l. 8. de Paedia.
and Xenophon gives this testimony of Cyrus, quod numerando and honorando, that
by his liberality, and heaping of honors on such as did him faithful service,
he purchased to himself many eyes and ears, so as nothing could be said or
done that tended to his dishonor, or the hurt of the State, but he had
suddenly notice of it; Arist. l. 3. pol. c. 12.
wherefore Aristotle wisely admonishes Princes to use many eyes and ears.

*69. Pessimum est unum magistratus plurimos obire.

It is most inconvenient to suffer one to undergo many Offices.

Aristotle condemns the Lawgivers in Carthage, Arist. l. 2. c. 9.
that they did not make a Law to prohibit that one man should be and tibieen
and suitor, a fiddler and a cobbler; for as in Military discipline, both by Sea
and Land, every one has a proper office assigned him, so should it be in
Civil Government: vitiosum est enim eundem multos magistratus gerere. Plato in
the second book of his Commonwealth, where he induces Socrates and Adimantus
debating what persons are most necessary in a Commonwealth, after a long
debate, concludes, the husbandman, the architect, the textor, and the tailor,
to be the most necessary; then Socrates puts this case; is the husbandman
bound to spend his whole time in tillage, and communicate the fruits of his
labors to the other three, or may he spend the fourth part of his time in
husbandry, and the other three in building, weaving and making of shoes; he
gives the answer himself, non per Iovem; nam sicut bos ad aratrum, equus ad
cursum, canis ad venatum, ita quisquam debet eam artem exercere quam didicit,
for as the ox is ordained for the plow, the horse for the race, and the dog to
hunt; so is every man to follow that vocation which he has learnt, and in
which he has been bred, neque moleste ferat quispiam, quod non est excellens
in omnibus; nam sicut impossible est, ut idem sit and leo montanus and
Melitaea Catella; aut quod vinea ferat at ficus, aut olea botros; ita
impossible est, ut unus excellat in omnibus; neither let it trouble him, that
he is not excellent in every thing; for as it is impossible, that one and the
same thing should be a Lion upon the Mountains, and a little Dog of Melitum,
or that the vine should bring forth figs, or the olive grapes; so it is
impossible that any one should excel in every thing. The same Plato in
Timaeus, where he brings in the Egyptian Priest talking with Solon,
concerning the antiquity and government of Athens, says, that the Egyptian
laws and the laws of Athens are in some sort alike; the Artificers in Athens
use their trades as they do in Egypt, severally, and not confusedly, every
one confining himself to his own trade, and so do the shepherds and
husbandmen; and if at any time they transgress their bounds, they are severely
punished, by which means, it happens that the husbandmen, shepherds and
artificers of those places are more skillfull in their professions, then the
people of all other Nations.

*70. Teneriores cum vetulis.

Princes should ever join with grave Senators young Gentlemen.

Examples profit more then precepts; the Senate house and the places of
public meetings were the Schools, wherein the Senators did train up their
Children. Plutarch in Lycurgo.
It was a custom amongst the Lacedaemonians (as Plutarch observes) for the
Fathers to bring their Children to their solemn feasts and public meetings,
as to public Schools, to hear their grave discourses, and to observe their
gestures and behavior; that so when they grew in years they might be able to
tell their Children what they had learnt from their Fathers, when they were
Children, concerning matter of state and government; yet ever at those meetings
the grave Senior, the eldest of the company, did show the door to the rest,
thereby intimating unto them, that that which had been spoken of there, must
not go out at the door, and be made public to the multitude, but be locked
up close in their own bosoms.

*71. Princeps interdum alios praeter Consiliarios debet audire.

A Prince ought sometimes to converse with others besides his Counselors.

Every general rule has an exception; the golden mean is nor always to be
preferred, as in the case where truth is searched after; verissime dicitur
(says Erasmus) quod mediocritas saepenumero locum non habet; nam ut inter
Cantores vbi voluptas quaetur, nemo magis placet quam qui insigniter been
cecinit aut egregie male; ita ubi veritas quaeritur aut insigniter honesti, aut
egregie stolidi sunt praeferendi; it is fabled of Luna that she would
sometimes set apart her Majesticall Robes, and vouchafe to come upon the earth
and converse with the shepherds, especially with Endymion whom she favored
above the rest. Children and fools speak truth (which the French thus
express, les fols and les infants prophetisent souvent, and the Graecians
thus, (...)) and whatsoever proceeds from them is well taken, which if it
should proceed from wise men, would sometimes be capital; the vulgar in
respect of the wise are no other, into whose company Princes have thought it no
disparagement to come sometimes in disguised habits, where they have heard
those things of themselves and of others which they should never have heard
elsewhere; for the Colliar when he comes near unto Croydon, having his
carcass well lined with Northdowne Ale will talk as familiarly of the King and
the Council, and the Lord Major and his brethren, as Hermolaus did of
Alexander at his death. Commines amongst the virtues of Lewis the eleventh
accounts this not the least, quod diligenter de singulis rebus percontabatur,
and cupide audiebat omnes, never Prince (says he) gave audience to so many
men; never Prince was so inquisitive after occurrences, or desirous to be
acquainted with so many strangers: whereby he knew all that were in authority,
in England, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Seigniories of Burgondy and
Brittanny, as well as his own Subjects; wherefore as it stands not with the
Majesty of a Prince to expose himself to the view of the multitude every day,
Perch (as says Castil.) non e al mondo cosa tanto eccellente, nelle quale gli
igneranti non si satiano, e non tengono poco couto vedendole spesso; because
there is nothing so rare and excellent in the World, but the multitude will
undervalue it, and vilify it if they see it frequently; so it stands not with
the wisdom of a Prince so to mue up himself as the Kings of the East Indyes
in times past did, who never were seen of their Subjects, but spoke unto them
arundine ori admota, in a reed or cane through a wall; or as the Kings of
France in times past did, who never showed themselves to their Subjects but
once a year, leaving the managing of the affairs, of the Commonwealth wholly
to the Majors of their Palace, (as Cedrenus has it) but upon every good
occasion to give audience to men of the meanest rank.

*72. Nihil difficilius est quam been imperare.

There is nothing more hard then to govern well.

Aeneas Sylvius amongst his choice sentences (which he calls Nomologias) says,
that to govern well is the art of arts: to obey well is a hard thing, sed been
imperare difficillimum, but to govern well is the hardest thing. Socrates upon
a time hearing some country fellows talking what they would do if they were
Kings and Consuls, wished that there were a law to punish such as should presume
to take into their mouths things of so high a nature, being out of the reach
of their vulgar capacity. See the fable of Phaeton in the second Book of Ovids
Metamorphosis, how Phaeton was punished for taking upon him a matter wherein he
had no skill; in which is showed quod repellendi sunt a gubernaculo Reip. qui
nullam habent rerum experientiam.

*73. Galba trium arbitrio regi solebat.

Galba was governed by his three Paedagouges.

Galba his Paedagouges, were Titus Junius his Leiuetnnant in Spain, Cornelius
Laco the Captain of the guard, and Icelus one of his freed men, whom he
honored with the degree of Knighthood; the first was basely covetous, the
second was intolerably proud, the third as bad as either of them.

*74. Talis ipse judicatur.

He is thought to be of that condition as they are whom he does use in the
managing of his affairs.

Chara est formicae formica, cicada cicadae.

The Greek Orator in his Oration unto Nicocles King of Sicion advises him in
the administration and government of the affairs of the Commonwealth, never to
make use of any ignorant or infamous person, (...), because that all such as
are strangers unto thee, will judge of thee by them whom thou usest in the
managing of thy affairs; the Italian says, la molta famigliarita col cativo
fa suspettosa la vita di buono, who so does make a knave his mate, though he
be good, encurrs much hate, and the Poet says, Qui juxta claudos habitat
subclaudicat idem, Admistusque malis di itur esse malus, he that is a
companion of unworthy men, or that uses such men in the managing of his
affairs, will be thought to be of their condition; wherefore Lipsius says,
nullum majus judicium bonae mentis Princes potest ostendere, quam ut adjungat
sibi and familiariter utatur viris honestis, and fama candidis, that a Prince
cannot show a more manifest token of a Noble mind, then by courteously
entertaining and receiving into his service worthy and deserving men; it was an
observation long ago that the Commonwealth does not suffer so much detriment
in this, that the Prince is effeminate and given to his delights, as it does in
his neglect in choosing worthy men to manage his affairs.

Plutarch in an Epistle which he wrote unto Trajan the Emperor, says, that
it did much rejoice him to hear all men say that there was nothing in him that
deserved dispraise; but was sorry to hear them say, that there was nothing in
his officers that deserved praise; and that he should more gladly have heard,
that which was spoken of his officers to have been spoken of him; and that
which was spoken of him, to have been spoken of them: because the people can
easily brook the imperfections of their Prince, but not the exorbitances of his
officers. Seneca in an Epistle which he wrote unto Lucilius, told him, that
he took it for a special favor, that he should make a journey to Rome, of
purpose to visit him; but if by reason of his absence his officers should make
a prey of the people, he should have been better pleased if he had staid at
home. It is a true rule that Commonwealths flourish or decline according to the
dispositions and inclinations of the Irenarchae, and of such as are in
Authority under Princes; if an injust Censor be a Superintendent in a City, the
City declines; if a just one, it prospers. Aelius Spartianus in the life of
Antonius Pius reports, that he upon a time taking a progress to enquire of
the behavior of his Censors, coming into Capua, one of the Town told him,
that upon his knowledge the Censor that was set over them was a most unjust
man; for that when time was he being importuned by a friend, requested of him
four things, having no desire to have him grant them, because he knew he
could not do it by the rule of justice, yet without making any scruple he
granted them all; and he verily thought if he had been his familiar friend, as
he was a stranger unto him, he might as well have had four hundred things, as
four: Of such Officers Princes ought to take heed, because it is most
inconvenient that they should have power to condemn, that ought to be
condemned: but in another manner does Cicero speak of M. Cato, happy wast thou
O Cato (says he) unto whom no man durst once open his mouth in an injust
cause; he was used to say, that it is not enough for a censor to be just in
his judgments, but that he should be of such esteem amongst the people for
his integrity, that no man wittingly should dare to open his mouth to him in an
unjust cause. Not without just cause therefore does Commines conclude it to be
the greatest part of wisdom in a Prince, to make choice of honest men to
serve him, quia aliena haec fama valde ad suam famam pertinet, because that
their good report redounds to his honor, in making such a choice; and as it is
a point of the greatest wisdom in a Prince to make choice of such men to
manage his affairs, so it is the greatest happiness that can befall unto a
nation, if God so dispose of the affections of the Prince, as to settle them
upon such men, as tender nothing more then his safety, and the welfare of his
people; and the greatest misery when he suffers the Prince for the sins of
the people to dote upon unworthy men. During Ner'os Quinquennium whilst Byrrhus
and Seneca sat at the stern, all things succeeded prosperously in the Empire;
but when Tigellinus had a predominant power, all the miseries that could be
imagined fell upon it; wherefore the daily prayers of the people of all nations
should be, that God would so dispose of the affections of Princes, as to
settle them upon honest men; tales enim talem in ipsos principes potestatem
habent, qualem ipse princeps in caeteros; his se totos fere trudunt, arcana
omnia communicans, and eorum arbitratu and rem familiarem and remp.
administrant (as says Muretus) for these men generally have the same power
over the Prince, as he has over other men; into their breasts he freely
emptieth his seorets, and commends as well the managing of his private affairs,
as the affairs of the Commonwealth.

*75. Omnium suae aetatis optimus.

He was one of the best men of his time.

Vt pupilla in oculo, and anima in corpore, ita Agrippa in rep. oui nemo par,
nemo secundus; as the apple in the eye, and the soul in the body, so was
Agrippa in the Commonwealth, having no equal, or any that came near in
goodness to him. Augustus had two special favorites, M. Agrippa, and C.
Maecenas; Agrippa he so much honored, that he advanced him to the highest
degree of honor, from so mean a place that he was ashamed to speak of; made
him twice Consul, and Agrippa first married Marcella; but Augustus desirous to
do him all honor, procured a divorce, and married his daughter Livia to him.
married his daughter to him, and it is said, that Augustus never did himself
more honor then in advancing him; for that in all his victories he ascribed
the honor still to Augustus. After that he had overcome Pompey, in which
victory heee deserved navalem Coronam and vexillum caeruleum: and whenas
Anthony told Augustus, that he was of a heavy and sleepy constitution; for that
before he could get out of his bed in the morning, Agrippa had vanquished his
Enemies: Agrippa assumed nothing to himself, but gave the honor thereof to
Augustus, by which his sober and temperate carriage he won not only the
heart of Augustus, but of the Soldiers and Common people, and was accounted
the best man of his time.

*76. Brutidius Niger artibus honestis copiosus.

Brutidius well seen in many good Arts.

Brutidius Niger was a Rhetorician, an Orator, and an Historian. Senec. lib. 2.
Controvers. and Lips. in annotat. in lib. 2. Annal. Tac.

*77. Allegat exemplum cujusdam.

He told him a Story of a certain man that used all lawful means and could
not prevail.

Ingens telum necessitas, and apud Platonem non minus egestas quam opulentia
morbus animi appellatur, it is often seen that extremes in both fortunes turn
topsy turvy the very frame and fabric of nature; that honors and preferments
make men swell and occasion pride, cruelty, and oppression, that wants and
necessities drive men into desperate courses, and occasion mutinies,
insurrections, and rebellions; for as the patient that has no means to advise
with the Physician, applies himself to the Emperick: and the Client that wants
a purse to retain a Counselor or Advocate, makes unto the Attorney and
Proctor; so the poor man that wants ability to make in to the best, is of
necessity compelled to take up his lodging with the worst, who by (buzzing into
his ears this enchauntment, Aude aliquid brevibus giris, Iuven. Sat.
and
carcere dignum,
Si vis esse aliquid; probitas laudatur
and alget;


If thou desire to thrive, do what deserves imprisonment, for honesty is
little esteemed) corrupts his manners, and in the end makes him become like
himself; for as love neglected turns into hatred, so virtue into vice and
villainy, nam ubi nullus honos virtuti est, extrema experiri necessitas cogit.
Alex. ab Alex. lib. c. 16.
Alexander ab Alexandro has a Story of one that was well versed both in the
Greek and Latin tongue, and a man beyond exception in his conversation; nihil
tamen praesidii ad degendum parare potuit, yet could not get clothes for his
back or meat for his belly, who when he saw there was no way to preferment by
virtuous and honest courses, eo vesaniae processit, ut obscaenis and libero
homine indignis artibus vacaret, de quibus non licet dicere ita faedae and
pudenda sunt, betook himself being in want, to so base a course of life that
he was ashamed to speak of it.

*78. Plures fraud quam virtute.

More raise themselves by fraud then by virtue.

This tenet Machivell Secretary to the Duke of Florence in the second Book of
his Commentary upon Livy, sets down for a Principle: but without doubt it is a
Paradox; for greatness is no greatness that is not founded upon goodness;
Horat.
Aesops crow is no crow, moveat cornicula risum, furtivis nudata coloribus, and
a blazing starr is no starr, it appears and vanishes like the lightning and
the Morning dew. Sejanus, Cleander, Tigellinus and Asiaticus may peradventure
for a time be mounted aloft; but to what end? certainly to none other, then
malefactors are lifted up at their death, ut lapsu graviore ruant, that their
shame may be the greater; yet this position may in some times carry a show and
shadow of truth; it is true that under Tiberius, Commodus, Nero, and Vitellius,
more were advanced to a show of greatness by vicious courses then by virtuous;
under Tiberius (as Tacitus observes) nemo consulatum imp^trare potuit nisi per
Sejanum, neque Fuit aulica nubes Excludens reliquos and melius meritos: Vt
neque virtutes, nec Mars, nec musa, nec arts, a radiis regis quae meruere
ferant.
Sejani benevolentia nisi scelere obtineri potuit, no man could attain to any
place of honors and reputation but by Sejanus, neither was his favor to be
obtained but by wicked and unjust ways; under Commodus no man was raised but
by Cleander, during all the time that he was in favor, ad arbitrium Cleandri
praetores aut retenti aut oc^isi, and libertini in Senatum electi; at his
disposal were all honors and preferments, Lamp. in Commod.
and in his power were the lives and estates of the Senators and Governors,
neither was Cleanders favor to be obtained but by doing of mischief; Tac.
lib. 2. Annal.
under Nero no man was preferred but by Tigellinus during all the time that he
was in favor, he by his lewd devises had so scrued himself into Neros bosom,
that he would do nothing without him; under Vitellius, unum ad potentiam iter,
scilicet prodigis epulis, Tac. lib. 2. Annal.
saginaque satiare inexplebiles Vitelli libidines; there was but one way to
honor and preferment, which was to gluttonise and carouse with him. Again in
the time of war more may peradventure raise themselves by fraud, then by open
and plain dealing; for that which is fraud in time of peace; is wisdom in the
time of war; to circumvent an enemy, is no fraud, but wisdom; quod leonina
pellis non potest, vulpina potest, was the saying of Lysander (as Plutarch has
it in Lysander) upon whom the Poet thus discanted: Vbi vincere aperte
Non datur, insidias armaque tecta parat.


Vid. Supplem. ad Commin post. lib. 6. in principio.
In time of war ars decipiendi est ars necessariae; the Lacedaemonians allowed
it, and Lewis 11th often read that lesson to his Son; but in times of Peace
in settled Governments for a man to raise himself by such juggling devises, is
to be raised to no other end then to fall again.

Non habet eventus sordida praeda bonos.

Nam male parta, male dilabuntur.

* 79. Exequere munus tuum diligenter.

In thy calling go on cheerfully.

The Polypragmon is cried down both by sacred Scripture, and all profane
writers generally; qua vocatione vocatus, in ea ambula, says St. Paul, in the
first to the Thessal. the fourth. item, sitis quieti, agite propria, 2.
Ecclesiast. 22. item quae mandata sunt cogita sancte. item, Spartam nactus hanc
orna.

*80. Cogitet multa sibi non licere.

It is not lawful for him to do many things.

Omnia non pariter rerum sunt omnibus apta, says the Poet, Prop. lib. 3.


Non omnia omnibus decora (as says the Orator)

As there are several Estates and degrees in the world, so there are several
and particular actions incident to each degree; and those things which may be
done by men of one degree with praise and commendation, cannot be done by men
of another degree without disparagement. When the Duke of Orleans Lewis the 12.
came to be King of France, Ami^at. lib. 5 polit. disse^t.
certain ill-disposed Courtiers told him that now he had opportunity to
revenge the many wrongs which were done unto him when he was Duke of Orleans,
to whom he most Princely answered, non decet Gallo^um Regem injurias ducis
Aureliensum vin^icare, that it was not fit for the King of France to revenge
the wrongs done to the Duke of Orleans. When as Aristides sat as judge between
two, Plut. in Aristides
one of the parties to incense him against his adversary, told him that he had
not only wronged him but Aristides also; to whom Aristides like himself
answered, that he came not thither to revenge any wrong done to himself, but
to do him right. When Parmenio would have had Alexander to have done something
which was more fit for a private man to do then a Prince, he gave him this
answer, ego id agerem si essem Parmenio, I would do it if I were Parmenio, but
being that I am Alexander it stands not with my honor to do it. Plut. in
praecept. polit.
Themistocles after that he had obtained a famous victory against his enemies,
walking up and down amongst the dead corpse, espied a chain of gold about one
of their necks, and wished him that was not Themistocles to take it of;
Polybius being in a dump, Seneca to rouse up his spirits set upon him thus:
remember your self I pray you, do not show your self so indiscreete as to
hurt your self to no purpose; quid tam humile aut tam muliebre quam dolor
consumere? Senec. ad Polib.
it is sufficient that you loved your friend whilst he lived, and performed
all friendly offices for him, and expressed as much at his death; the World has
a great opinion of you for you worth and valor, and exspects that you should
show your self more manly; a common Soldier may quit the field, having
received but a scar, and no notice taken of him; but for you to show your self
so pusillanimous for so light a wound will be a great dishonor to you; nam
multa tibi non licent quae hominibus in angulo jacentibus licent.

*81. Non ob propriam virtutem.

Thou should never think that thou art raised for any worth of thine.

When the Painter saw a Fantastic admiring his own Picture, and preferring
the workmanship thereof before the workmanship of all his other pictures, told
him that he did much wonder that it being so excellent a piece did not sell
better; that Alexanders picture did usually bring him so much money, Hectors so
much, Ajax so much, but as for his, no man would give any thing for it; there
is nothing so prejudicial to the servants of Princes as an over weaning
opinion of their own worth; nam quantum sibi ipsissimi videntur, tantum a Rege
vilissimi tenentur, for the more highly they do esteem of themselves, the
more vilely do they appear in their Princes eyes: for that they generally (as
Commines has it) do more affect them on whom they have conferred honors
without any desert, then they who having deserved well think them bound to
reward them. Lewis the eleventh took great delight to make himself merry with
these kind of men, who having at one time received a great Sum of money, was
pleased (to the end to stir them up) to ask what he should do with all that
money, and where are now all my servants and followers to whom I owe any thing?
it were good for them to come whilst I have it in my Treasury; of which his
words (the alarm being given) the Courtiers came in as the hawk to the lure,
every one hoping to get something; and when the King beheld one above the rest
max me hiautem and quasi oculis pecuniam devorantem, looking upon his money as
if he would have devoured it with his eyes, asked him, what have thou to say?
Sir, an't please you (quoth he) I have been your Falchoner so long, and the
hawks that have been commended to my charge have been as good as any Prince in
Christendom ever had, but they cost me a great deal of money, and a great
deal of pains; another showed what service he had done, and a third what he
had done, extolling themselves to the highest; the King having heard them all,
his Chancellor standing by him, asked him, what say thou my Chancellor?
truly Sir, (quoth he) plus recepi quam promeruerim, nec ulla de re magis
sollicitus sum, quam ut regiae tuae munificentiae responderem, I have received
more of your highness then I have deserved, neither does any thing in the
World more trouble me then that I cannot tell how to deserve so much as I have
received; well (quoth the King) do thou take the money; as for these fellows,
erit alia exspectanda occasio, they shall stay until another time. Here we
find that verified in the fable of Narcissus, who admiring his own shadow
pined away; wherefore Amiratus most religiously admonishes them upon whom the
Prince has cast a more gracious aspect then upon their fellows, never to
ascribe any thing to themselves or their own merit, but to the providence of
God, who has been pleased to incline the affections of the Prince more toward
them then toward other men.

*82. Tametsi Burrhus

Though Burrhus had promised, yet he did not perform.

Melius est vota stultae promissionis non implere quam crimen admittere; though
Nero had commanded, and Burrhus had promised to kill Agrippina, yet he did not
perform; Castilio puts the case whether a servant be bound to obey his Master
in all his commands; and the answer is negative, cum jubet ea quae in prima
tabula vetat deus, aut vetat ea, quaejubet deus, non est observandus, if he
commands those things which by the law of God are prohibited, or prohibit
those things which by the law of God are commanded, he is not to be obeyed;
so did the Mid wives refuse to kill the Children of the Hebrews according to
the command of King Pharaoh Exodus the 1. so did the three children refuse to
worship the golden Image which Nebuchadnezar had set up; so did Obadiah refuse
to obey the Command of Jezabell in killing of the Prophets; 1, Kings 18. and so
did Mathias refuse to obey the command of Antioch in offering up of Sacrifices
to the Idols. Joseph. lib. 1. de bell. Jud. Cap. 1, *83, Templa per Asiam and
Achaiam.

He defaced the Temples in Asia and Achaia.



It is a fault for the poor to trespass upon the rich, a greater for the rich
to make pillage of the poor, but the greatest of all for either of them to
invade the Temples and Holy Places; the Temples are the places of Gods
habitation, and to trespass upon them is to rob God of his honor; of this
foul offense Julian the Apostate, Dionysius the Tyrant, and Nero the
blood-sucker have been foul guilty, and for it have been branded with infamy
to all succeeding ages.

Of Neros cruelty how he spoiled the Temples both in Asia add Africa, how he
set Rome on fire, and accused the Christians with the fact, how he caused them
to be clad in the skins of wild beasts, and to be torn in pieces with dogs,
how in the day time he fastened them to crosses, and when night came burnt them
for lamps to give light; how he made ascents in his garden, to behold those
bloody prospects; See Tacit. lib. 15. Annal. and Suet. in Nerone.

*84. Longinqui ruris secessum orat.

He desired leave to spend his days in the Country.

Hippolitus being resolved to wear out his days in a single life in the
Country, it so happened, that Phaedra the wife of King Theseus fell in love
with him; and that she might divert him from that course, prevailed with a
Baud thus to assail him, Sense in Hip.
cur tu tot viduas misere teris, o teris horas? why do you lie languishing
like a woman that lately buried her husband, and suffer your golden days to
pass away without taking any comfort in them? consult with nature, and she
will tell you, quod laetitia juvenem, frons decet tristis senem, that mirth is
as proper to youth, as gravity unto gray hairs; and that if all Creatures
should tread in your steps, orbis jacebit squallido turpis fitu, vacuum sine
piscibus stabit mare, alesque coelo deerit, there would be a general
desolation in the world; there would be no birds flying in the Air, no fishes
floating in the Sea, no sesitive or reasonable Creatures upon the land. Omnibus
est eadem vitae via, non tamen unus Est vitae cunctis exitiique modus. there is
but one way to come into the World, but diverse ways to go out of it, and we
dye daily, and if this defect be not supplied, there must needs follow a
vacuum; wherefore rouse up your spirits, and shake off this solitary humor,
and come and revell it with us in the City; to whom Hippolitus shaped a sharp
answer dii te fecere mulierem, and tu te facis cloacam publicam, in quam se
evacuant impuri cujuscunque generis, qui non habent te pro amica, sed pro
matula; follow you your wanton course of life, and give me leave I beseech you
to follow mine; for although the course of life that I lead, seem taedious and
irksome to you, yet certainly, non alia est magis libera and vitio carens vita,
there is no life more free and angelical, or comes more near to the most
innocent and happiest times of our forefathers then the Country life, non torta
clausas fregerit saxo balista portas, non hominum strepitus, audit, non ille
rotarum, he never hears the sad alarums of the cannon beating at his gate, or
the clamorous complaints of the poor at his doors, or the wheels of the
Chariots grating on his ear; the chirping of the birds are the sounds whereof
he is most sensible; which course of life though it seem tedious, I say unto
you yet, I prefer it before the delights of my fathers Court, In hac noverca
verificatur etymologia. Noverca quasi novus Orcus, unde poeta in versu plusquam
argenteo; Lurida terribiles miscent aconita novercae. Ovid. lib. 1. Metam.
or the love of the Queen my Stepmother. Seneca in his declining time used his
best Rhetoric to persuade Nero to give him leave to spend the remainder of his
days in this course of life. See an eloquent oration of his in the 15 Book of
Tacitus to that purpose, wherein he acknowledges the many favors that he had
received from Nero, and that now being grown in years, and not able to wield
so great a burden as he had in charge, desires him after the example of
Augustus his great Grandfather, who licenced Murcus Agrippa, and Caius Mecenas
in their declining times to retire themselves, to give him leave to lead a
private life.

*85. Ars ministri.

It is the wisdom of a Servant at no time to oppose his Prince importunately,
unseasonably, without respect of time and place.

Cum inter omnes est observanda quaedam dexteritas, tum praecipue quando cum
principe agendum est, quod si fit comiter and dextre, paulo post plus habent
gratiae qui obstitere quam qui obsecundarunt; quod enim cupiditati placet,
temporarium est, at quod recta ratione geritur perpetuo laudatur, (says
Erasmus) As in all our dealings with men of our own degree, there is a
certain kind of dexterity to be used; so more especially when we have any
thing to do with our Prince, which if we duly observe in the carriage of our
selves soberly and discreetly toward him, we shall have more thanks of him in
the end, though we do sometimes oppose him in his desires, then they shall
have that do second him; because what pleases his fantasy is but temporary
and vanishes, but what is grounded upon reason, is of continuance and abides.
It is reported of Cassandra, that she did ever truly foretell the people of
the event of things, yet they never gave any credit to any she said. The
Councels of servants, which unseasonably admonish their masters, are like unto
the counsels of Cassandra; whatsoever they say it is not regarded; wherefore
Aristotle when he commended Calisthenes his Scholar, and Kinsman unto
Alexander did advertise him, that by all means he should have a care of his
tongue, quia nonnunquam unica vox temere excidens, nonnunquam jocus
intempestivus est maxim nocivus, because that a word spoken unseasonably, or a
jest broken is fatal many times; that he should speak unto him but seldom,
quia difficillimum est simul, and multa, and opportuna loqui; and when he did
speak unto him it should be without sharpness: but Calisthenes forgetting
what Aristotle had taught him, ^un himself upon a rock, quod debebat dicebat,
sed non quomodo debebat, he spoke no more then what was fitting, but because
he did not observe a decorum in his speech, he drew the wrath of the King
upon him. Princes are not to be reformed like other men by telling them
plainly of their errors and imperfections; bluntly to direct a Prince what
course he should pursue (says Pliny) savours of arrogance, Plut. lib. 3. Ep.
Ep. 18.
laudare vero opimum principem, ac per hoc posteris veluti e specula lumen quod
sequantur ostendere, multu utilitatis habet, arrogantiae nihil. Phalerus being
requested by Ptolomy to put him in mind when he did amiss, answered, that he
was of a slow speech, and had not the gift of utterance, but that he would
prefer unto him, a Councellor meaning a Chronicle of his own Kingdom, that
should do it to the purpose. When Nathan the Prophet reproved King David for
killing of Vriah, and commiting Adultery with his wife, he told him a tale,
how there was a rich man that had multa armenta and greges, 2. Sam. 12.
and a poor man that had but agnam unam quae de frusto ejus comedebat, de
^nculo ejus hibebat, in sinu ejus cubabat, and erat illi tanquam filia; and
that when a stranger came to this rich man, he spared his own, and took the
poor man's Lamb to entertain him; the King not dreaming that he meant him by
the rich man, and Vriah by the poor man, gave this sentence, that he should
dye the death, and restore the Lamb fourfold, and so condemned himself in the
person of another. This is the way to reform the errors of Princes, that is,
by condemning their errors in others, or by commending the contrary in them,
without seeming to glance or reflect upon them; which though it be the further
way about, yet it is the surer and safer way; see somewhat to this purpose in
the sixth book of Commines, of Oliver the Harbor, who forgetting that reproves
should be used in private without bitterness, and praises in public without
flatteries, is much blamed for his irreverent behavior toward Lewis the
eleventh.

*86. Gaudebat talem amicum habuisse.

He was glad he had such a friend.

Petrach l. 7. Ep. 18.
It was Petracks request to his friend Hieronymo, that he would deal freely
with him, and rather personate Juvenal then Horace, a Satyrist then a harper.
Every Garden can bring forth Heliotropium, Aulici Gnathones assimilantur
Heliotropo eo quod cum sole flectit acumen.
but not laurum, Marigolds, not Bays; every Age can produce a Clio and an Agis
that will make Alexander believe he is a god, but not a Scythian Ambassador,
to put him in mind of his mortality; every Age can produce smooth
Rhetoritians, and temporising orators to lull Augustus asleep in security, but
not a Maecenas to put him in the right way when he is wandering out of it; such
friends are hard to be found, and Augustus was glad he had such a friend.

*87. Pulchrum est eminere inter viros Illustres.

It is a famous thing amongst renowned Lords to ring.

It is reported of Aemilius Secretary to Nero, that having built a stately
house in Rome, he had a great desire to have Seneca to see it; and for that
end one morning invited him to a breakfast, and whilst it was providing took
the opportunity to show him his house, and withal, acquainted him how he had
disposed of the several rooms and lodgings therein, how such and such rooms
were provided for lodgings for strangers, such for entertainment of Ladies,
such for negotiations with Suitors, such for his domestique Servants* and such
and such were for other offices: Seneca having viewed them, highly commended
the plot, the architecture, and the convenience of every lodging, being framed
alike in all dimensions; Aemilius then took him into his dyning room, where
after they had refresht themselves, Seneca t ok his leave; and going to his
horse, he looked upon the house as if he had never seen it; and demanded of
Aemilius, dichi e questa Casa, whose house that was? Aemilius wondering that he
should ask such a question, with a smile answered, Sir, did I not invite you
to a short repast, and did I not tell you I would show you my house, and have I
not been as good as my word? and do you ask me whose house it is? excuse me I
beseech you (quoth Seneca) it is true I confess, you told me you would show me
your house, and you brought me where you showed me lodgings for strangers,
ritramenti per done, retiring places for Ladies, places for negotiations with
Suitors, lodgings for your domestique Servants, and stables for your horses, but
you showed me never a room which you said was yours; and therefore being that
you built it for strangers, and for your friends, I conceive that you have the
least interest in it; Sir, between you and me there have been and are many
engagements; we are fellow servants of one Master, and besides the kind
entertainment which I have now received, I am engaged unto you for many noble
favors, and therefore suffer me to open my self freely unto you; Guests are
accustomed to pay money for what they receive, Parasites requite courtesies
with flatteries, Buffones with making sport, but friends with mutual love and
advice; and therefore as to my loving friend and fellow I speak it, I would
have you, Piu tofto con buone e virtuose opere doppo morte acquistar fama, che
con edefitii che il tempo consumano, rather with virtuous actions to eternize
your memory after your death, then by building of houses subject to ruin and
destruction; for whatsoever is wrought by the hand of man, time turns topsie
turvie, (...), (as the Greek Orator has it in his Oration to Demonicus,) but
the praise of virtue endures for ever; wherefore amongst the many learned
Lectures which Mecaenas read unto Augustus, this was one, Dion cas^ lib. 59.
That he should not seek for fame and renown by erecting statues of gold and
silver, for that they would require a great deal of pains and expense, and to
no purpose; for being not founded upon worth and virtue, they would rather be
Trophaea maliciae and monumenta injustitiae quam honoris and gloriae, and the
longer they stood, the greater dishonor they would be unto him; but that he
should with Argonautaru^ expeditio admonet generosos homines ut illustribus
rebus agendis gloriam quaererent; ferunt Carolum ducem Burgundiae mirifice
delectarum fuisse lasosonis fabula, ejusque exemplo incensum flagrasse
maximarum rerum agendarum desiderio ideoq instituisse societatem aurei velleris.
Jason, seek for praise and renown in the performance of Noble atchievments.
Sic universa terra erit templum, pro delubris omnes urbes, omnes homines pro
statuis, quorum in animis semper cum gloria insidebit: So in every corner of
his dominion he should have a Temple dedicated to his name, in every man that
he met he should find his portraicture and effigies; in every City that he
past through, he should hear the Heralds blaze his Arms: one generation
should tell another, and there should be no end of his greatness; of which
Cyrus was not ignorant, when he gave that in charge to his sons upon his
deathbed, to undertake noble achievements, and thereby erect to themselves
Monuments more durable then the iron and adamant. Pulchrum est eminere inter
viros illustres.

*88. Displicent civilia ingenia filiorum.

That is distasteful to Princes to see their sons have popular wits.

As the greatness of Subjects is the Glory of Princes, so popularity in
Subjects is distasteful to them: When the people began to honor Sejanus in the
same degree as they did Tiberius, then did Tiberius abhor Sejanus; the glory
of the Sun is not eclipsed by the Moons being in her Complement, but by her
Interposition; the greatness of Subjects is no eclipse of Sovereignty: but
when the Subject shall stand between the Prince and the people, and divert the
affections of the people from him, that causes an eclipse; wherefore it is
distasteful to Princes to see their sons have popular wits.

*89. Pertinax memoria verborum acerborum.

Bitter words make a deep impression in the minds of great persons.

The use of speech and reason is proper unto mankind only; other Creatures
express themselves in confused sounds; the Lion roares, the Horse neighes, the
Dear brayes, the Cow lowes; man only being endued with reason, either
delights the hearer with the melody of his speech, or offends him with the
harshnesse of it: Speech by the Graecians, is aptly termed (...), the light of
the mind; for as by the light of the Sun which they call (...), the light of
life, we see the superficies of the earth; So by the light of our words are
our intellectualls discerned; If they are mild and gentle, they are Ensigns
of contentment in the mind, and prevail much; if bitter and harsh, they are
Ensigns of coffeehouse in the mind, and provoke much. Johannes
Salisburiensis has a Tale of a Lion, lib. 5. c. 17.
who being set apart to devour Andronicus, instead of devouring him, licked
and kissed him; and why? because he spoke mild unto him, and when time was,
pulled a Thorn out of his foot; this Appion says he saw amongst other sights
which he saw at Rome. As courteous entertainments allay the fury of great
spirits, so sharp reproves kindle and inflame them; and though for a time they
may seem to bury the fire in the ashes of oblivion, yet in the end it will
break forth and burn the incendiaries; witness those bold speeches of Gallus
to Tiberius, Tac. lib. 1. Annal.
when the Senate was pleased in all humility after the death of Augustus, to
entreat Tiberius to take upon him the charge of the Empire; and when as he
modestly answered, that the charge of the whole would be too great a burden to
him, and that he would willingly accept of any one part of it: Gallus
malepertly and sawcily stands up, and would needs know of him, quam partem
reip. mandari voluit; of which, though Tiberius took no notice for the present,
yet he conceived implacable hatred against him; and although afterward Gallus
would have excused it, and magnified Tiberius for the noble acts which he did
in the days of Augustus, Gallus verificatum invenit illud Virgilii Iudicium
Paridis ma^et alta mente repostum; and proverbum, facilius est evocare daemone^
qua abigere.
yet he could never win his favor again. Witness likewise those speeches
which the Constable of France used to the Earl of Embercourt, when the
Ambassadors of the King of France and the Duke of Burgundy met together to
conclude a peace between them, the Constable with others being assigned for the
King, and the Chancellor of Burgundy and the Earl of Embercourt for the Duke;
it fell out that in the parley the Constable gave the Earl of Embercourt the
lie, which (as Comines says) Summam and extremam perniciem ei attulit; for
when the Duke of Burgundy had notice of it, taking it (as it was ndeed) as a
wrong done to himself, the Earl representing his person, he revived the
agreement at Bonvines concerning the death of the Constable, and put that in
execution: witness likewise those speeches which Enguerande gave to Charles
the brother of Philip the fair; there being some difference between two Peers
of France, Enguerande standing for the one, and Charles for the other, in
debating of the matter, both being in the height of choler, Enguerande gave
Charles the lie; which (as Paulus Aemilius says) Nobilitati omni vulnere
gravius, and which in the days of Lewis Hutin, cost him his life; for though
that was not urged against him, yet that did incense Charles, and occasioned
him to accuse him de crimine peculatus; wherefore Comines gives this Caveat,
Lib. 3. lib. 5.
Qui sunt in magno loco apud principem, cavere debent ne quid atrocius dicant:
And Lipsius this, Cavete vos caniculae, periculosum est leonem vellicare;
beware how ye awake a sleeping Lion, especially ye that serve your Prince in
any high places.

*90. Commemoratio meritorum gravis. It was fatal to Clitus and Philotas, that
Alexander heard that they boasted of the good service which they had done him.

It is observed of young children, quo celerius loquuntur, tardius gradiuntur,
that the sooner their speech comes to them, the longer it is before they go:
And of the Cedars, quo magis florent; eo minus fructus ferunt, that the more
gloriously they appear to the eye, the less fruit they bear: (the Frenchman
says) les grand diseurs sont sovent les petit faisours, the greatest praters
are for the most part the least actors, as the greatest barkers are the worst
biters.

Dolia plena cient nullum pulsata fragorem,
At digito tactum vas quod inane sonat.
The emptiest vessels and shallowest currents make the greatest noise. The
Mousecatcher with his traps, Altissima flumina minimo sono labu^tur. Curt.
and the Carman with his coals, will make the streets ring of them, when the
Merchant deals in silence without any noise. Wise men do and say little,
Fools brag and babble and do little. Ostentatio est certum signum levitatis
and stultitiae; nam quo quisque minus valet, magis se dilatat ostentatione.
Cicero.
Res ipsa loquatur nobis tacentibus (says Seneca) a servant of a Prince should
be no Rodomontado; for by talking too much he loses the honor due unto him.
What a shame was it to Terentius Varro, to give forth at the Battle of Cannas,
that the same day that he displayed his Ensign against the Carthaginians, he
would utterly defeat them, and to suffer himself to be shamefully beaten by
them? Live. lib. 2. dec. 3.
(as Livy has it) And what a dishonor was it to the Lord Tremoile, to write
unto Lewis the 12. that he would deliver Maximilian la Sforza into his hands,
as before he had delivered Ludovick his Father, and in the end to be beaten by
him with the loss of two and twenty pieces of his great Artillery? Guicciard
lib. 1^.
(as Guicciardine has it) It had been a great deal more honor unto him to
have said and written less, and to have done more: Laus in proprio ore
sordescit, Qui sese laudat, laudis se munere fraudat, ideo non inutile
consilium, Non sua laudabit studia aut aliena reprendet. Hor. Castil. lib, 1.
the praises which are an honor to a man, when they proceed out of the mouths
of strangers, are a dishonor when they proceed out of a man's own mouth; The
people pitied the Soldier when they beheld the many wounds which he had
received in the field; but when they heard him foolishly babbling that those
many wounds seemed to him but as so many flea-bitings, then they laughed at
him. The Ladies likewise thought it an honor to their Festivals, Castil. ib.
to have them honored with the presence of him that had been a General in
the Field, but when as being requested to dance with them, he began to talk of
his Arms, and how many men he had killed, then they wished that he might be
hanged up in his Arms until there were use of him, and were afraid that he
would have killed them. In the account of Philotheos, Gnatho and Thraso, a
Rodomantado and a Philauto are numbered amongst the most vile and contemptible
sort of men: When Philotheos and Philocompos that had been bred together in
their minority, accidentally met, having not seen each other for the space of
many years before, they both stood amazed, each viewing and beholding the
other; Philocompos wondered that Philotheos, being old, should seem to be so
young; and Philotheos on the other side wondered that Philocompos, being young,
should seem to be so old, and desired each other to give an account what
course of life they had pursued. Philotheos began, showing, that after he had
left the Grammar School, he betook himself to the University, where after
that he had spent some few years, he returned home and married a wife, (...),
like to himself in every degree, equal in parentage, equal in portion, and
not differing in condition, that he had spent a great part of his time in the
study of the seven Liberal Sciences, In the morning searching into the deepest
mysteries, Horis matutinis homo tetus est homo dum omnia mentis organasunt
tranquilla; post prandium vix semi homines sumus, cum animus cibis ^onustus
gravatur.
in the afternoon into matters of less difficulty, that he ever associated
such as were of approved integrity, especially Philagatho, and abandoned the
company of Gnatho and Thraso, and their Associates, as carefully as Ulysses,
did the charms of the Syrenes, and in this course of life had spent his time.
Philocompos then began and showed how he had followed another course of life,
how as soon as he had left the Grammar School, he betook himself wholly to
his delights, that he ever hated the name of a wife, because he could never
endure to be confined to one woman; that he had studied 27. Arts; but the Art
wherein he took most delight, was the Art of Whoring, and to satisfy his
desires he had crossed the Seas, and had spent many years in France and Italy,
where he ever spent the morning in his bed, studying what Mistress he should
visit in the afternoon; that he visited none so often of the feminine Sex, as
Dalila, Flora, Lais, Lamy, Archenasse, and Aspatia; and of the Masculine, as
Gnatho, and Thraso, the Policleti and Patrobii, and their Associates, and in
this course had he spent his time: Philotheos having heard him, made no wonder
then to see him so decrepit, and so poor in fortune, but wondered to see him
alive, and repented that he had taken notice of him, fearing that in future
times he would he a burden to him, and so took his leave of him, with a
desire never to see him again; in this account we see in what account with
wise men a Philauto and Selfprayser is.

*91. Ne praemiorum petitione sit gravis.

Let not a servant be ever craving and begging.

Castilio gives this advertisement to such as are attendants on the Courts of
Princes, Lib. 2.
ut rarissime a principe mendicarent, and if they do at any time move him in
the behalf of any man, to be sure that his cause be honest, to the end that
if his request be denied, it may be no disparagement to him; if granted, the
Prince may have no cause to repent himself. It is reported of Lewis the
Eleventh, and Maximilian the Emperor, that they did usually sport themselves
with the hungry Courtier. Of Lewis it is said, that during the time that he
made his abode in the Duke of Burgundies Court, after his hunting he did
usually retire himself to the house of Conon, who did for the most part
entertain him with a dish of Raspes; that afterward when he came to be
settled in his Kingdom, this Conon by the solicitation of his friends, brought
him a present of the same fruit; but being pinched with hunger upon the way,
he did eat them all, except one of an extraordinary bigness, which he
presented to the King with great alacrity, and the King received it with
greater, and commanded that it should be deposited inter ea que habebat
Charissima, and that he should have for a reward a thousand Crowns; the fame
whereof being spread abroad, and coming to the understanding of a greedy
Courtier, he forthwith presents the King with a fair Gelding, thinking with
himself, si sic pensavit rapam donatam a rustico, quanto munificentius
pensaturus est equum donatum ab aulico? if the King so liberally rewarded a
Countryman that presented him with a Raspe, how much more munificently will he
reward a Courtier that presents him with a horse? the King perceiving how he
went a fishing with a silver hook, casts about how to reward him, and at last
bethinking himself of the Raspe which Conon had given him, caused it to be
brought unto him, and with his own hands delivered it to the Courtier, telling
him withal, quod beue pensatus est equus Cimelio quod sibi constitisset mill
coronatis; that he was sufficiently recompensed: for that the jewel which he
gave him stood him in a thousand Crowns, and so the fisher was taken in his
own net, and became the subject of laughter. The like is reported of Maximilian
the Emperor, who having a desire to advance a youg Gentleman, sent to the
Citizens of a certain City to borrow of them a sum of money, intending it or
the greatest part of it to the Gentleman: who prevailing in his suite, knowing
the Emperors mind, returned part to the Emperor, and retained part to
himself, whereof the Emperors Officers being given to understand, forthwith
acquainted the Emperor, plus aceeptum fuisse quam exhibitum, that he had
received a great deal more then he had paid in, and importuned the Emperor
to call him to an account for it; the Emperor seeming not to understand how
the matter had been carried, sent to the Gentleman to have him to come to an
account; the Gentleman came accordingly and expressed his willingness to
perform the Emperors commands, but notwithstanding departed without doing any
thing; whereupon the Emperor sent to him a second time to bring in his
account, who as before expressed his willingness, yet departed without doing
any thing; the Officers then began to be incensed, and pla^nly told the
Emperor, non esse ferendum quod ille tam palam illuderit Caesari, it was not
to be endured that he should so palpably deceive him; whereupon the Emperor a
third time sent unto him, and told him that without any further delay he must
bring in his account, assidebant Officiarii paratis adio codicillis, nec
diutius tergiversandi locus, he would be dallied with no longer, his Officers
were there ready to take his account; the Gentleman then plainly told him that
he was a young man and never had been versed in the art of accounts, that the
Gentlemen that stood by him were well experienced in it, and if they would but
show him some of their Presidents, they should find him to be an apt
scholar, and did not doubt but to learn to account as well they did, nimirum
ut bona pecuniae portio penes ipsum remaneret; the Emperor smiling at the
ingenuity of the young gentleman told his Officers that he demanded no more
then was reason, and so dismissed both the one and the other: so do Princes
oftentimes reward importunate suitors with neglect and derision.

*92. Hilari vultu injuriae ferendae.

If thy Prince do offer thee any hard measure, undergo it with all alacrity.

(...) says Hesiod, a fool is he that will contend with one whose power does
his transcend; obsequendo and obtemperando, was the answer of an old Courtier
to one questioning him how he continued so long so gracious in Court; there is
no sacrifice so acceptable to Princes, as is the sacrifice of obedience and
observance, nor any thing so distasteful unto them, as to have their words
retorted upon them with an Dictum est de Olympia matre Alexand. quod p^^^icum
habuit, quae acceptam vocem septi^s redderet, quam oppidani Heptaphonon
vocaba^t, qua reptehendebant veteres objurgarores qui soleba^t convitiu^ unu^
convitiis multis remunerari.
Heptaphonon. Philip of Macedon by his own Example taught his followers how to
carry themselves in the affairs of the Court, who being most contumeliously
reproached by an Athenian Ambassador, desired no other satisfaction of the
Athenians for the wrong done unto him, but that they would be indifferent
judges, which of the two deserved more praise, he that had a patient ear to
hear those opprobrious speeches, or he that had a tongue to deliver them;
posse and nolle nobile; as it is a badge of clemency and of a Princely
disposition in a Superior to connive at wrongs, and to construe things ever in
the best sense; so it is a high point of wis^dome in an inferior; wherefore
Erasmus wisely, as they deserve the name of fools, qui pro ictu apum mel
relinquunt, that for a little stinging of the ^^ees will quit the honey in the
hives: so they deserve no better attributes, who upon every slight occasion
will take an offense, and quit the service of their Master; injuriae spraetae
vilescunt (says Tacitus in the fourth of his Annals) injuries neglected pass
for naught, and vanish with the smoke. cum Lentulus sputum and purulentiam in
os Catonis injecit, when Lentulus spit or spued rather in Cato's mouth, Cato
put it of merrily, saying, if any man in future times shall make a doubt
whether Lentulus have a mouth, let him come to me, and I will resolve him; and
when Xantippe washed her husband, having before shaved him with words keener
then a rasor, he good man said no more then post^tonitrua imbres, after
thunder he looked for rain; vincit qui patitur, there is no such weapon to
encounter potency as patience, and no Mediators like unto petitions and
supplications.

*93. Otium penitus auxit.

As before he advanced war, so now he studied to advance Peace.

Castilio in his second Book says, that it is the property of a wise Courtier
to avoid envy and malice which is ever an attendant on such as serve their
Prince in any high place; to frame and fashion his behavior to the fashion of
the Country where he lives; and his discourse to the capacity of the people
with whom he converseth, ever having a respect to their age and condition; Apud
Italos osculo ^alutant viri viros, apud Germanos si facis. absurdum; ibi pro
osculo dextram porrigunt, in Anglia viri salutant mulieres etiam in templo; in
Italia flagitium habetur; in Anglia porrigere poculum in convivio civilitatis
est, in Gallia contumeliae.
Apud Italos salutare more Italorum, apud Germanos Germanorum, apud Gallos
Gallorum, and apud Anglos Anglorum; with the Italian to salute after the manner
of Italy, with the German of Germany, with the French of France, and with the
English of England; toward old Men and Matrones to carry himself graviter,
applying his discourse to the times wherein they flourished toward young men
and maidens comiter, Senes gaudent ea memorari quae multorum fugiunt memoriam,
admiratores temporum in quibus ipsi floruerunt- Matronis dulce est refricare
memoriam ejus temporis cum a procis ambirentur.
De sua cuique art grata est confabulio.
in the Country to advance husbandry, in the City mechanical trades and
occupations, in times of war military discipline, in times of peace civil
government; briefly in all companies and in all places to behave himself so, ut
fines rationis non transiret, that he never transgress ^he bounds of honesty
and civility.

94. Ne familiarem se nimis.

Let not a Princes servant make himself too familiar with him.

Ignorant vulpes cum quo ludit; the Lion, the Fox, and the Ass as it is in the
Apologue meeting together, agreed to go seek their fortune, and what they got
to put into a joint stock, and to share it equally and indifferently; who after
they had wandered long about the wood met with a prey, and it fell to the Asses
lot to make the division, who like a silly creature divided it into three
equal shares, and presented it to the Lion to make his election, Luc^^. l. 1^
who finding his presumption, fell upon him and devoured him; omnis potestas
impatiens consortis erit, as the old Poet has it. Princes expect to be
reverenced afarr off, and will not endure to have their servants come so near
as to tread upon their heels; Caesar will not endure a Superior, nor Pompey
an aequall.

*95. Ne Principem a rebus ^erendis.

Let a Princes servant be careful that he do not take upon him to direct him.

Cu^t. l. 7.
The saying of Cobbaris to Bessus in Curtius is observable, Servo utilius est
parere dicto quam afferre consilium, it is more safe for a servant to obey then
to direct: for if things fall out succesfully, he may perchance have thanks for
his labor; if otherwise, it is fatal unto him; V. alerius Maximus, and Aulut
Gellius have a Story of Posthumus Tubertus, who for that his Son his eldest
and beloved Son fought with his enemy of his own accord contrary to his
command, though hee^ overcame him; cut off his head; for it is a thing of
dangerous consequence, that a servant should neglect the precepts of his
Master, a Soldier of his General, and a Subject of his Sovereign. Castilio
debates the question, whether it be lawful for a servant to transgress the
bounds of his Commission upon a supposition that what is enjoined him may be
better effected another way, and he holds the negative, and produces two
severalll Praesidents; the one of the Son of M. Torquatus, for that he
executed his Fathers Commission in fighting of a duel, suffered for it, though
he had the glory of the day; the other of a certain Engineere, to whom Mutianus
sent to have the greatest of the two shipmasts which he had seen sometimes in
Athens, to be sent unto him to make him a ram to batter the walls of a City
which he had besieged in Asia, to whom the Engineere sent the lesser, knowing
it to be the better for that purpose; sed quia consilium dare potius quam
obtemperare maluerat, Mutianus committed him to Prison, and caused some
corporal punishment to be inflicted upon him.

96. Caute omnia faciat.

Let a Princes servant be ever cautelous.

The Council which is given by the Son of Syrack is not to be neglected;
separate thy self from thine enemies, and have an eye unto thy friends; for
there be many that will sit at thy table, and eat of thy meat, and in
secundis tuis erint tanquam tu, which in adversity will fall from thee, and
discover what they can to defame thee; let him be cautelous therefore and
wary. When the Sultan of Babylon demanded of Melchisedeck the rich Jew of
Alexandria, quale de la tree leg colui reputa la vera'ce o la Giudaica, o la
saracena, o la christiana, which of the three laws he thought to be the true
law, either the law of the Jews, the Saracens, or the Christians, thinking by
his answer to have entrapt him, the Jew merrily answered him with a tale of a
ring, and told him how there was a certain man which had a ring which he highly
valued, and gave it out that he to whom he gave that ring, at his death, should
be his Heir and inherit his Possessions; that it fell out accordingly that
he was his Heir that had the ring bequeathed unto him; that this custom
continued in the family for many discents, the Heir of the house being
generally known by having the ring; that in the end it so happened that he that
was Heir, had three Sons, whom he so entirely loved that he intended to
make them all joint-Heires of his Possessions, and to that end caused two other
rings to be made so like unto the first, that Argus with his hundred eyes
could not distinguish them; which being given to his Sons upon his death bed,
there grew a great contention between them after his death about his
Possessions, each pretending to have the right ring; and this was all that the
Sultan could get out of the Jew, reserving the interpretation to himself. When
the high Priests and Elders set upon our Savior, and would needs know of him,
(...) by what authority he did those things, he answered them, (...), the
Baptism of John whence was it of heaven or men? Mat. 21.25
When the two shepherds met together, and the one would needs know of the
other quibus in terris Tres pateat Coeli spatium nou^ amplius ulnas, Alii hoc
aenigma de quodam profundo puteo volunt intelligi, in cujus imo si quis fuerit,
tantum Coeli spatium conspiciet, quantum sola latitudo putei fuerit.
the other answered, Alterum aenigma exponunt ut Hyacinthum significet, in quo
flore flebilis illa Graecorum vox (...) inscripta invenitur, ut Naso Poeta
lepidissime narrat.
dic quibus in terris in scripti nomina regum Nascantur flores. Virg. Ecl. 3.
To answer an insinuating Sophister with an aenigma or a dilemma, and a curious
inquisitor with an impertinent answer, is a point of wisdom; a wary distrust
is requisite in every one, but more especially in them to whom any office of
trust is committed, they are as eyes to the body, and as sentinels to an Army,
and should (as Erasmus says) confidere paucis, quamvis arridenti, ^omplexanti,
immo dejeranti.

*97. Sit modestus and humilis.

He will always be of a lowly spirit, and so stop the passages of envy.

It is reported of Cato, Plu. in M. Catone
that he was forty times accused, yet ever came off with credit, to the shame
of his accusers: There is no better way to allay the fury of malignant spirits,
then an honest and virtuous life.

Vivendum rect^ tunc propter plurima, Iuv. at. 9.
tunc his
Precipue causis, ut linguas mancipiorum Contemnas,
As says the Satyrist; for whosoever he is that can say with Gracchus when he
returned out of Sardinia, I have served my Prince so many years, and if during
that time I have taken, or was privy to the taking of a bribe of any man to
the value of a halfe-penny, Omnium nationum nequissimum existimatote, let me be
the chiefest knave in Poneropolis, and accounted the veriest villain that goes
on the earth; he needs not fear the displeasure of any. Prove. 10.9.
Qui ambulat simpliciter, ambulat confidenter, says the Wiseman; he that
walks uprightly, walks safely: Conseia men's recti famae mendacia ridet, for
he that knows himself to be innocent, cares not what men say, neither fears
greatness or power.

*98. Immodicos honores fugiat.

Let him never desire to climb too high.

When Icarus was to cross the Seas with his waxen wings, his Father did advise
him to fly neither too high, nor too low: Nam si dimissior ibis, Vnda gravet
pennas; si celsior, ignis adurat; but to keep the middle rode, lest on the one
side the Sun should send forth his beams, and burn him; or on the other
side, the water her vapors, and make his wings flag; but he neglecting what
his Father had warned him of, perished in the waters. Mediocria firma,
superflua nocent; Sen. Ep. 39
sic segetem nimia sternit ubertas, sic rami onere franguntur, sic ad
maturitatem non venit nimia foecunditas, says the wise Heathen; the Golden
Mean is to be preferred; the House that is situated neither upon a hill, nor
in a dale, but between both, is freest from winds and waters. A Ship cannot
sail in a storm, or in a calm: Foelices quibus obtigit sor^ ne^ summa, nec
infima, sed sane modica: The man that lives between supereminencie and
baseness, is freest from scorn and envy; wherefore the counsel that
Daedalus gave his son, is not to be neglected by the Servants of Princes;
for if honor be a burden, great honors must needs be a great burden; and if
a man do over-burthen himself, he may perchance break his back.

*99. Immodicas opes fugiat.

As great honors, so great possessions are not to be desired.

Iuv. Sat. 10. Opuleutia ebrii ausi sunt (...) contra stimulos calcitrare,
con^ra torrentes niri, donec in exitia sunt educti. Tac. lib. 3. Annal.
Quamplures nimia congesta pecunia cura, strangulat, says the Satyrist, when
the sponge it is full, it is crushed; Cum saginati sues mactantur in coenam
domini: When the Hog is fully fatted, he is destinated for the Shambles; Great
Fortunes and Estates are attended with great envy; when one man shall gain the
estates of many men to himself, it cannot but draw the envy of many men upon
him. When Seneca began to be exceeding rich, then, and not before, did Suilius
begin to upbraid him, how he was an enemy to Claudius friends, and was
deservingly banished by him, how he wrought upon the weakness of young
Gentlemen, and by his subtle devices within the space of four years had
gotten infinite Treasure; how at Rome he beguiled Legataries of their Legacies,
and drained Italy and the Provinces adjoining with excessive usury. When Italy
abounded with treasure, then did the Italian complain how his Country, Tutta
via e prae a ^sposta a genti strane per le motle richezze di chi e piena, was
always exposed as a prey to strange Nations, by reason of the exceeding great
riches wherewith it did abound. When Sophocles grew rich, his own sons, to
gain his estate, accused him before the Judges pro deliro and ^fatuo quasi qui
rem familiarem temere profunderet, and opus habere videretur curatore, that he
was grown childish and needed a Guardian to manage his estate; whereof Sophocles
being given to understand in his old age, wrote that elaborate Tragedy,
entitled Oedipus Colonaeus, and acted it to the life before the Judges, which
when they heard, they asked his sons, Number illud carmen videretur esse carmen
delirantis, whether fools did use to make such Verses, and so with much
difficulty freed himself; yet hence we learn, how the estates of some men
draw their own houses upon their heads, and make their children to neglect
them.

*103 Ne publica praedia sibi acquirat.

Let him be careful, that he do not make a prey of the Commonwealth.

It is fabled of the Crow, that being stung by the Adder, cried out, (...), woe
is me that have made such a purchase as will be my ruin, who in the extremity
of sickness desired his mother to pray for him: but she asked, (...), which of
the gods (my son) will compassionate thy case, being that thou have bin an
enemy to the Commonwealth all thy life time? for where is he whom thou have
not trespassed upon in the stealing of his Corn, by reason whereof thou art
esteemed no better then an enemy to the Commonwealth, and art hated of God and
men? It was a constant custom among the Romans, as often as the Senate met
together, to consult of the affairs of the State, to give this in charge, Vt
caverent ne resp. aliquid detrimenti caperet. As often as Caesar sent any
Letters abroad to his Ambassadors or Agents, he ever added Si reip. commodo
fieri potest; when he wrote unto Labienus and Tribonius, Vt ad certum diem
adessent, he adds this, Si reipublicae commodo fieri potest. King James says,
that in all cases which concern the Commonwealth, it behooves a Prince to be
strict and severe: but in cases which concern his own private affairs, to be
easily entreated: Nam quaedam scelera (as he says) sine scelere condonaeri non
possunt, for that there are certain offenses which cannot be pardoned without
offense, as Murder, Incest, Witchcraft, Poisoning, and the Sodomiticall sin,
which the Grecians call (...), of which abominable Sodomiticall sin the
Apostle speaks in the 1. to the Romans, saying, (...); in which cases a
Prince should be very circumspect how he grants any pardon, because it is more
consonant to reason, and more pleasing both in the sight of God and man that
one suffer, then that the Commonwealth suffer. Friends are dear, and kindred
are dear, and Parents are dear, and children are dear, Sedomnes omnium
charitates patria una complexa est, pro qua quis bonus dubitat mortem appetere
(as says the Orator.)

*101. Si superbiam fugiant.

If they banish pride.

As there is no virtue that gives a greater luster unto greatness, then
affability and courtesy; so there is no vice that does more eclipse it, then
pride and arrogancy, Insuaves enim sunt ad omnem vitae consuetudinem
superciliosi and caperatafronte magistri.

*102. Tardius hoc usus est.

He used the remedy too late.

Sero sapiunt Phryges, sero ga^eatus ab armis; when the Soldier has received
his presse-money, it is too late for him then, Palinediam canere: When Seneca
has enricht himself by the service of his Master, and incurred his
displeasure, it is too late for him then to desire to retire himself. Castilio
puts the case, whether a man being once admitted into the service of a Master,
may without prejudice leave his service; the case is controverted; on the one
side it is said that he may, especially if he see him running into exorbitant
courses, for that he will be thought to be accessory to his exorbitancies: For
as the Astrologers report of Mercury (whom the Poets feign to be the servant of
the Gods) that it is a Planet indifferent, and good or bad as it is in
conjunction with other Planets; if it be joined with Sol, Jupiter, or Venus, it
produces good effects; if with Saturn or Mars, evil: So are servan^^
regularly reputed to be as their Master^ are. On the other side it is said,
Exorandus est Deus ut bonos nobis Magistros concedat, utcunque tolerandi sunt;
that we must pray to God to send us good Mast^rs, for when we are once
admitted into their service, we must take them with all their faults, and for
many respects not to quit their service; for as it is a hard thing to get up,
so it is dangerous to come down, for that the most just man in the world
cannot carry himself so upright, but he shall commit many slips, which every
Plebeian will be ready to take hold of, when he sees him stand by himself:
wherefore Seneca should either in the beginning, or not at all, have quit his
Masters service.

*103. Destruit ingentes animos longius aevum.

Long life is a dishonor to a man when he survives his honor.

Philodoxos ambitious of fame, came to his friend to know what he should do to
get him a name, who gave him this answer, Non ignoro, honestum illum (...)
(quem vulgo Sergeant votamus) multum contum^liae perpessum.
Imitare Erostratum qui incendit templum Dianae, aut Zoilum qui laceravit
Homerum; imitate Erostratus that burnt the Temple of Diana, or Zoilus that tore
Wild in pieces. O but (quoth Philodoxos) I would not be known by doing of
villainies, but by the performance of noble achievements; why then (said his
friend) pursue the ways of honor, and look not after honor, for it is the
nature of it to fly from those that follow it, and follow those that fl^e from
it; imitate Aristides, Phocion, Socrates, both the Catoes, all which deserved
well of their Countries in their Generations: O but their fame was attended
with envy, Aristides was banished, Phocion and Socrates poisoned, Cato senior
was forty times accused, Cato Vticensis was guilty of his own death; and I
would have honor, but not attended with envy; why then you must (said his
Friend) with Codrus and Decius perform some Noble work, and in the very acting
thereof desire of God to take you unto him; for if you survive it, envy will
follow you as the shadow does the body, and long life will redound to your
dishonor. How many may we call to mind that in their declining times have
been most unfortunate, who in the flower of their youth were most fortunate?
Let us behold Priamus who lived to see not only the destruction of his
Kingdom, but of his hopeful children; Let us admire Dionysius who being
driven from Syracuse where he had reigned a long time, became a poor
Schoolmasters in Corinth, and got his living by teaching of children. ^et us
behold Croesus, Xerxes, Polycrates, M^thridates, Pompey, Longshampe, Wolsey,
who if they could now rise out of their graves, would tell us that our lives
are prolonged for the most part, rather to add to our afflictions, then for
our content; if Priamus had dyed before he had seen the destruction of his
Kingdom and children; if Dionysius, whilst he was King of Sicily; if Wolsey
and Warwick in the height of their fortunes, how advantageous had Death been
unto them? The Historians then in future ages would have had no cause to have
styled them Ludibria Fortunae. The Thracians never lamented the death of their
children and friends, for that it did disingage them of many miseries, but
their Nativities, and when they were in the world to see them survive their
senses and reputations; Non ego, quos ra^uit mors, defleo, defleo vivos quos
uru^t longo fata futura metu (says the ^pigrammatist) there is no such torture
as to anatomize a living man, he that survives his reputation is anatomized
whilst he lives, and long life is a dishonor to him.

*104. Quod mors invito, hoe tu sponte fac.

That which death does against thy will, do thou thy self willingly.

The Iustitiaries hold that there is a twofold death, a natural and a civil
death; the one is when our days are run out according to the course of nature,
the other when we abandon the world and the delights thereof; this kind of
death does Evenkelius persuade the servants of Princes in the height of their
fortunes to undergo, to prevent future mischiefs.

*105. Multum habent contumeliarum ut intres.

Thou can not come into them without reproach.

They were discreet and wise answers which a Physician gave once to his
Patient; a Patient being troubled in his eyes, in his ears, in his stomach, in
his estate, and in his mind, came to a Physician to seek for remedy, who
prescribed him for his eyes a Meretricibus abstinere, to forbear the company
of lewd women, for that there is nothing so offensive unto them as those kind
of Cattle; for his ears, Balnea, vina, Venus, valde nocent oculis.
that he should have a special care how he married Rixosam foeminam, Quidam
jocosus de quadam foemina quae fuit valde formosa, sed valde rixosa taliter
jocose scripsit, Tacta places, oculisque places,
and dum taciturnaes,
Tota places, neutro non
taciturna places.
Aliter alter de altera foemina quae ^uit admodum prudens and modesta, sed
valde incurva and deformis.

Tacta places, audita places;
si non videare,
Tota places; neutro si videare places.

nam ut fumus est oculis, ita faemina procax est auribus, for that the smok is
not so offensive to the eyes as a scolding wife is to the ears; For his
stomach, that he should abstain a Cardinalis mensa; Nam nihil magis sanitatem
impedit quam ciborum varietas. Destruit ingentes stomachos confusio pastus,
Quisi sit simplex nausea nulla foret, for that there is nothing so offensive to
it, as variety of meats; for his estate, (although that did not lie within the
compass of his profession, yet he would tell him freely what he thought) Quod
a Judaeo mutuum non acciperet, that he should never have any thing to do with
a Jew about matter of money; And for his mind that he should carry himself
so toward all men, Vt aulas dominantium non ingrediatur, that he might have
no occasion to attend the Courts of Justice, or the houses of great men; Quia
multum habent contumeliarum ut intres, plus cum intraveris, because thou can
not come into them without reproach, or stay there without greater.

Epilogus.
When Panurge consulted with the multitude concerning his marri^ge, (...)
Friar John utterly dissuaded him from it, and why? because the bells sounded
forth nothing else, but marie point, marie point, point point, point point, si
tu te marie, tu t'en repentiras, tiras, iras coqu seras, marry not, marry not,
not not, not not, if you do, you will repent, pent pent, for you will be a
Cuckhold; which put Panurge into such an agony that he never durst adventure
upon a wife by reason of the sound of the Bells. We read of a people living in
Vtopia that have seven tongues, and every tongue divided into seven parts, and
every part speaking seven several languages, that praise and disprayse without
reason or sense, and judge according to phansy as the Bells direct them, whom
Plato resembles to a monster with seven heads whom we call the multitude; from
this kind of people I wash my hands, I dare not meddle with them, they have
too many tongues for me to deal withal; it is not for them that I provided
this service, it is too hard for their disgestion; but for you my friends
wheresoever you are, either in the Academyes or in the City, to whom God has
given two ears, and but one tongue. And for no other reason, but because (as I
have said in the beginning) I conceive it to be both useful and delightful;
for as he that travailes into Italy having never been there before, has need
of a guide and an interpreter, otherwise he may perchance fall into the hands
of the Banditi before he is aware; and as he that is to cross the Seas has
need of a Pilot if he have no skill in navigation, otherwise he may fall into
Scylla and Charybidis; so it is with them that converse in the Courts of
Princes, which are in the body politic as the heart in the natural body, and
as the center in the circumference where all the lines meet; they have need of
Intelligencers, Interpreters, Councillors, and all little enough; and because
I conceive this stranger to be an excellent truchman, and to be able to show
unto you on the one side the dangerous ways of dishonor, that you may avoid
them by the examples of such as have perished in them, and on the otherside the
ways of honor, to the end that you may pursue them by the examples of such as
have lived and dyed in grace and favor with God and men; I have here made him
speak unto you, (to the end you might be acquainted with him) in your own
language; who could with more ease have acted my part (by saving the
transcribing of it) in the Authors own language, desiring you to be advised
by him, and for no fading, momentary, windy profit, pleasure, or honor to
neglect his advice.

AFter I had past over this little treatise, and considered how they that had
obtained the greatest honors and preferments, have come to the most untimely
and unfortunate ends; the saying of the Psalmist came often into my mind, man
that is in honor and understands not, is like the beast that perishes,
Psalm. 49.12. which occasioned this short meditation.

(...): you know not what you ask: Mar. 10.38
was the answer of our Savior to the sons of Zebedee that desired to be
preferred before their fellows. When the Hawk is full gorged she flies from her
Keeper, and the Prodigal in prosperity runs from his father, but hunger and
adversity reclaimes them and brings them home to the lure again; the school
of affliction is the school of instruction and humiliation, and in this
school does Christ train up his scholars; here are read Lectures of divinity
and humanity, and here we learn our duties both toward God and our
Neighbors; affliction gives underderstanding, and the rod brings wisdom
says the wise man, and whosoever will be a fellow with Christ in heaven, P^o
2^.15.
must first be a probationer in this school; through many tribulations we
must enter into the Kingdom of heaven; the pleasu^es and vain delights of the
world like strong wine dazzle our senses; and lead us hudwinke to destruction;
but by crosses and tribulations as a tender mother with sour t'hings weanes
the child from the dug, does Christ weane us from the world, and brings us
home to himself; in my trouble (says the good Prophet) I called upon thee,
but in my prosperity I said I shall never be removed. Sol and Boreas the Sun
and Wind upon a time conspired to try their power in disarming a travailer of
the weapon (being his cloak) which did defend him against them, and by consent
the wind was to make the first assault, who in the morning early went forth to
seek his prey, and meeting with the travailer upon the rode, in a furious
manner set upon him, but he holding his weapon in his hand stoutly withstood
his first encounter; anon after he set upon him again, and so violently that
he gave him a blow which made him reele and stagger, yet the travailer stoutly
still held his weapon; a third time like a Lion enraged he set upon him more
furiously then before, and so far prevailed notwithstanding he lay cauteously
at a close ward, that he came within him and strok up his heels, thinking
then certainly to have disarmed him; but the poor man stoutly ^^ill held his
weapon, and would not yield it upon any conditions; the Wind then being out of
all hope to prevail, betook himself to his wings, and in a great rage flew
away; the Sun standing by and observing the valor and magnanimity of the
poor man, and that in a rigorous way there was no dealing with him, in the
afternoon set upon him in another manner; he came not like a Lion, but like a
Fox, not as an enemy, but as a friend, and in a friendly manner by his
delightful beams insinuated himself so into his bosom, that within a short
time he made him lay down not only his cloak but his coat also; the
blustering winds of adversity make us more vigilant and cautelous, but the
delightful beams of prosperity dazzle our eyes and deceive us; whilst the
Prodigal was in prosperity, swilling himself in pleasure with his Mistresses
he never dreamt of his father: but when he once tasted of adversity, then he
cried out; (...), Luke 15.18.
I have sinned against Heaven, and against thee, and am not worthy to be
called thy son, suffer me to be one of thy hired servants; the dearest of
gods children have been over-taken with the foolish delights of this vain
world, and they whom the storms of adversity could never move a jot, have been
allu^ed in times of prosperity to do those things which a modest ear would
blush to hear; as David in the case of Vriah; he that in adversity preserved
the life of his Enemy, 1 Samuel 26, 9
in prosperity took away the life of his friend that fought in his behalf; but
thou, 2 Samuel 11.
O thou Bersheba, wast the cause of all; beauty, riches, honors, pleasure,
profit and promotion, which Saint John in his first Epistle set forth by the
concupiscence of the flesh, (...). Ioh. 2.16.
concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, bewich us; beauty whose
fuel is gluttony, whose flame is ignominy, whose ashes and end is beggary,
like Judas, with a kiss betrays us; riches with their cares and fears consume
us, as a moth does the garment, and the rust the iron; honors and preferments
transport us beyond our selves, and whilst they set us up on high, and make us
known to the world, they make us forget our selves, our neighbors, and our
Savior; yet these are esteemed the chiefest and choysest commodities in the
great fair of the world, which indeed make a glorious show to the eye, but
being touched and weighed they prove not Gold but Alchymy, mear frippery and
vanity, (as the wise King, who was a great dealer in them has sufficiently
showed out of his own experience) he that kept for his pleasure 700 Wives,
and 300 Concubines, that had the rarest Musicians of both sexes, 1 Reg. 10.^^1.
that had his Vineyards, gardens, orchards, fishponds, and whatsoever else
could be thought upon to please the senses in a most exquisite manner, that had
an Estate that exceeded all the Princes of that Age, 2 C^ron. ^
having his very footsteps made of beaten Gold, by whom silver by reason of the
abundance of it, was esteemed no better then Stones, that was honored a d
sought unto by all the Princes of the earth for his wisdom and magnificence,
delivers this opinion of these so choice and much desired commodities;
Ecclesiastes, 1.2.
vanity of vanities, and all is vanity. Saint Paul values them according to
their worth, I have not esteemed (says he) the riches of the world better then
(...), Phil. 3.8.
dung, dung indeed they are, or very little better if we duly consider of what
materials those merchandises that are so highly prized are composed; what are
the precious stones of which there is so great an opinion, but the froth and
superfluity of the Sea coagulated, esteemed only for rarity, and of no use,
nor in the eye of our law valuable; and what is Gold and Silver but earth
refined? what are Silks and Velvets but the excrements of worms woven and
knit together by poor laboring men? what are those rich furs of Martins,
Sables and Ermines, but the skins of little beasts esteemed only for rarity,
and in no degree so useful as are the skins of sheep and oxen? what is the
finest Scarlet Cloth but the woole of sheep, painted over with an artifitiall
dye to please the eye only? what are the sumptuous buildings of the world, but
heaps of wood and stone, laid together by a company of poor laboring men, set
apart in the Commonwealth to gather sticks and stones, and to pile them
handsomely together? what is beauty but a flower, subject to the blasting of
every wind, and to be defaced by the scratch of a hand or pin? and what is
honor without virtue but a puff, a smoke, a bubble, a nothing? Saint Austin
desirous to suppress the market where these Commodities are uttered, in some
indignation thus informs against it; O vile and miserable world, whose
vexations are certain, whose pleasures uncertain, whose troubles are durable,
whose joys momentary, whose torments insufferable, whose gifts contemptible,
whose promises prodigal, whose performances base and miserable, who despisest
them that love thee, and beguilest them that trust thee! It is extreme folly
for a man to dote upon a woman that has neither portion or proportion, nor yet
any good quality or condition in her; but for a man to settle his affections
upon earth and stones, upon dung and excrements, and upon things of the like
nature is extreme madness; God has given dominion unto man over all the
sublunary Creatures, and has placed him in degree little inferior to the
Angels, to the end that he should look upwards, and settle his affections upon
heavenly things; (...), Quia sursu oculos tollit
and for him to lose that sovereignty which God has given him, by making
himself too familiar with these base earthly commodities savours of
brutishness and pusilanimity. Love is of a transcendent nature, and is cast
away where it cannot be requited with love again; love thy Lord thy God, and
thy Neighbor as thy self because they are able to render unto thee love for
love, like for like; but despise the world and the vanities thereof, because
they are trash and dung, and cannot in any degree recompense compence thy love.
There were upon a time two Gentlemen that much frequented one Inn upon the
rode; the one was very prodigal in his expenses, the other provident, and it
fell out at last, that he that was so profuse fell into poverty, and coming
to his Inn, he enquired for his old host, who being told by his servants who
he was, and having notice before that he was in wants, came unto him, but
looked upon him as strangely as Nabal did upon King David's Servants; the
Gentleman wondering at it, asked him whether he did not know him? 1 Samuel 25.10.
truly Sir (quoth the host) I think I have seen you, but where and when, I
cannot call to mind; I have been an old guest to your house replied the
Gentleman; it may be so (quoth the host) many honest Gentlemen frequent my
house whom I know not; the Gentleman desirous to make himself known unto him,
asked him whether he did not know such a one; yes very well, he is an honest
stout Gentleman, and whenever he comes to my house he brings money in his
purse and paies well; I marvel (said the Gentleman) that you should so well
remember him and forget me; for we two often met here together, and were
merry; now the truth is, he had good cause to remember the other, for
whenever he found him false in his bills, he would send for him and cudgel
him handsomely; and at one time above the rest finding the totals to exceed the
particulars in his bills he broke his pate, and cut his nose into the bargain,
which gave him just occasion to remember him, and to commend him for an honest
stout Gentleman, and that he paid him well; if the other had paid him after the
same manner, he would not so soon have forgotten him; non est hic habitandi
locus sed commorandi diversorium (says the orator) there is no place for us
here to settle our selves, but as an Inn to rest for a short space; so the
Apostle, Heb. 13.14: Psalm. 39.14.
(...) we have here no continuing City, but we seek for one to come; so the
Prophet David, (...) I am a Sojourner as all my fathers were; the life of man
is a mere pilgrimage, from the womb to the tomb we take our journey; the
world is our Inn where as Pilgrims we take up our lodging for a few days, and
then come to our long home: Now if in this our pilgrimage we spend our days in
pleasure and vain delights, as soon as we are gone we are forgotten; but if
we husband our time well, and manfully subdue our unruly affections, by
withdrawing our eyes from those allurements and tickling delights, which
Dalilae our hostess presents unto us, and suffer her not by her flatteries and
enchantments to deceive us, then shall we be remembered with praise and
commendation in our Inn, at our journeys end, and ever after: Oingnes vilain
il vous poindra poindrez vilain, il vouz oindra (says Rab.) anoint a
villain, and he will annoy and sting thee; but sting and annoy him, and he
will anoint thee; the way to make a knave know himself, is to neglect him;
and the way to have honor in the world, is to trample upon the world, and to
neglect it; especially that frothy windy honor which consists in popular
applause. Who have been more renowned in all ages since their time, throughout
the Christian world, then the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Evangelists, and then
they who when they were in the world, were not of the world, but lived (...),
in Deserts, Heb. 11.38
in Mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth? who are at this day more
honored throughout the Christian world then S. Peter and S. Paul? the way unto
honor is humility; (...), He that humbles himself shall be exalted; Luke 18.14
and he that out of the pride of his heart, thinks himself worthy of honor,
for that very reason he is not, (...), he that exalts himlsefe shall be
brought low. Who more humble then old Father Abraham, the Father of the
Faithful? then S. Paul, one of the chief Apostles? then the Prophet David, a
man after Gods own heart? then S, John? Shall I (says that good old Father)
speak unto my Lord that am but dust and ashes? Genesis 18, 27
S. Paul of himself acknowledges, 1 Cor. 15.9
(...), he that was not worthy to be called an Apostle: David not worthy to be
a doore-keeper in the house of God; Luke 3.16.
S. John (...), I am not worthy to loose the shoe latchet of my S^viour: Yet
of these men that were so lowly in their own eyes, the Christian world has
taken more notice then of all the Nobles of the earth; God in the dust shows
his power and Majesty; he ever preferres the humble before the proud, the
youngest oftentimes before the eldest; he raised Abel above Cain his elder
brother, Isaac above Ismael, Jacob above Esau, Joseph above his brethren, and
David above his, because they were more humble, because they were more worthy,
because they were more virtuous in their conversations then their elder
brethren; the same stock that brings forth the Rose, bring forth the Bryar, the
same Father that begot Abel, begot Cain; both were alike nobly-descended; but
because the one pursued the ways of honor, and the other desisted it,
therefore was the one enobled, and the other a runnagate upon the face of the
earth; honor is the reward of virtue, and he that will be honorable must
first be virtuous; that is the foundation, and if that fail, the Fabric
cannot stand; there may be a resemblance and an imaginary honor without it,
but no true honor. Thersites may peradventure act the part of Achilles in a
Comedy, an ignoble man of a noble, but it is but honos titulo tenus, an honor
that extends no further then the bare title; for when the Comedy is ended, he
is Thersites still, and no better a man then he was before it began. I have
seen (says the Prophet David) the wicked in great prosperity flourishing and
spreading himself like a green Bay tree, Psa. 3^.3^.
but he suddenly vanished, and I sought him, but he could not be found.

Baruc 3.16, 17, 18.
Baruck makes an enquiry, where are the Princes of the people that took so
much pleasure in hunting after the beasts of the earth? Where are they that
spent their time in hawking after the birds of the air? And where are they
that hoarded up gold and silver? Deleti sunt and in sepulchrum descenderunt,
they are in the dust and clean forgotten: The memory of the licentious man is
like unto ashes (as Job says) and unto chafe (as the Prophet David says)
which the wind drives from the face of the earth; Job. 13.12.
Psalm. 1.4.
but the memory of Josias shall be tanquam mel in ore and instrumenta musica in
convivio, Eccl. 49.1.
Psalm. 11^.6.
as a sweet perfume in an Apothecaries shop, as Honey in the mouth, and as
Music at a Banquet. The just shall be had in perpetual remembrance; the
means then to have thy memory to smell sweetly in the nostrils of posterity,
is to live justly in this present world; this is that one thing that is
necessary; direct the Compass of thy affections to this port, here thou shall
find true honor, and here thou shall find wisdom and knowledge, that will
so temper and regulate thy prosperity and worldly blessings which God has
given thee, that though they be instruments of shame and confusion (as the
Wiseman says) to the fool, Pro. 1.32.
yet to thee they shall be instruments of honor, of praise, and of glory:
Beauty which is to him a stumbling block and a means to lead captive silly
women, Gratior est virtus veniens e corpore pulchro
shall make thy virtues more transparent, through which as through Crystal
they shall appear more gloriously to the world: Riches which to him are like
the plague of Flies to the Egyptians, to thee shall be servants and handmaids
and instruments of Charity and Hospitality: Honor, which is to him as a
phrenzie to make him run hither and thither, he knows not whither like a mad
man, to thee shall be quasi Chiara lampa che manifesta l'opere buone, as the
Italian says, as a Lamp to show others the way to virtue; and as his shame
shall be the greater by how much he has been the occasion by his example to
lead others unto ruin and destruction, so thy honor shall be the greater, by
how much thou by thy good example have been the means to show others the way
to virtue; pursue then the ways of honor ye whom God has honored, and set
above your brethren, and spend that short time that is allotted you in that
way: so shall you have your Coats of Arms beautified and adorned with
additaments of Honor, and smell like Josias in the nostrils of posterity;
otherwise you must expect to hear that of your selves which I have before
remembered out of the nine and fortieth Psalm, and to have your arms defaced
by posterity with gores and gussets, Posteritas suum cuique rependet, Ta^. l.
4. Ann.
which diminutions and abatements incident to such as addict themselves to
dishonorable courses. So now being at a period, I must needs acknowledge with
the holy Father Saint Bernard, (who was used to say, Se nullos habuisse
magistros praeter quercus and fagos, intimating, that by prayer and meditation
among the Trees in the Desert he composed the greatest part of his Works)
that this Meditation of mine upon this Psalm was hatched amongst his Masters in
the Park of the good old Gentlewoman my worthy Aunt by alliance Mistress Anne
Fleet, (...): whose great Grandfather was High-Sheriffe of the County of
Warwick, Anno 1485. and was slain at the Battle at Bosworth that year.
