The Kings Majesty's Speech to the six Heads, concerning the Queens going into
Holland.
MY Lords, and Gentlemen; nothing but exstream necessity shall make me willing
at this time for to give consent unto the Queens going out of the Land; and I
shall be very sorry if the case stand so, that she should be forced to go to
preserve her health, and I give unto both Houses many thanks, for the care they
have of my Wives health and contentment: therefore I desire there may be a
Committee of both Houses here to morrow, at three a clock, to attend my Wife,
with these Reasons which have now been read to me.

The Queens Majesty's Speech to a Committee of both Houses at Whitehall,
touching Her going into Holland.
MY Lords, and Gentlemen of the House of Commons, I am thankful to both
Houses of Parliament, for the great care they have of my health; and for their
affections to me, hoping that I shall see the effect of it: Truly nothing but
my life could move me to this consideration, and if I thought I could serve the
King, and Kingdom with the hazard of my life, I would do it willingly, and I
hope you do believe, I am so much interested in the good and welfare of this
Kingdom, that I shall never in my life wish or desire any thing that may prove
to the prejudice of it.

July 20. Printed Anno Dom. 1641.
