A PROCLAMATION For Proroguing the Parliament till the Eleventh of November
next.
CHARLES R.

Whereas the Parliament has been Prorogued until the Six and twentieth day of
January next, We, for many weighty Reasons, have thought fit, and resolved to
make a further Prorogation of the Parliament until the Eleventh day of November
next ensuing the Date hereof: And therefore do by this Our Royal Proclamation
Publish, Notify and Declare, That the Parliament shall be Prorogued upon and
from the said Six and twentieth day of January, until the Eleventh day of
November next: Whereof the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Knights,
Citizens, and Burgesses, and all others whom it may concern, may hereby take
notice, and order their Affairs accordingly, We letting them know, that We will
not at the said Six and twentieth day of January expect the attendance of any,
but only such as being in or about the City of London, and Westminster, may
attend the making the said Prorogation, as heretofore in like cases has been
accustomed.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Eleventh day of December, in the One and
thirtieth year of Our Reign.
