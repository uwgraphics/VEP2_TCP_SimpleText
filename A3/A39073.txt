AN EXPLANATION OF THE Terms, Order, and Usefulness OF THE LITURGY OF THE
Church of ENGLAND.
Q WHY is the Liturgy of the Church of Englandcalled Common Prayer?

A. It is not to be understood, as common signifies a thing of little value,
but it denotes a form of Prayer, in which we have all a common interest, as our
Savior is styled the Common Savior, a Form in which all of the same Communion
are to join.

Q What is the meaning of the word Liturgy?

A. It signifies the Public Ministry, it being derived from the Greek word
(...), Publicus, and (...) O^u^

A. An useful enumeration of the Months, Weeks and Days of the Year, together
with an account of the Lessons to be read daily throughout the Year.

Service?

A. 1. The better to prepare peoples hearts to the performance of those holy
duties following with devotion. 2. To mind us of our own misery, and God's
mercy.


Q Of what use is the Exhortation?

A. Therein the Minister exhorts the people, in an Apostolical style to confess
their sins humbly to the Lord, who is able to hear because Almighty, and
willing to help, because most merciful.

Q. Why does the Church begin her Service with Confession of Sins?

A. 1. Because our sins make a separation betwixt God and us, hinder our
Prayers from ascending, and God's blessings from descending. 2. Because it was
the practice of God's own people the Jews, and of the Primitive Church of
Christ so to begin, and to do it in this manner as our Church pre^ (...)


Q. Why is the Confession to be made of all the People after the Minister?

A. Because the Minister is the peoples mouth to God, both in going before, and
in instructing them.

Q. Why is this Confession, and our Prayers to be made kneeling?

A. 1. That the lowliness of our bodies may express the humbleness of our
minds. 2. Because it is the fittest posture for Penitents.


Q. Why is the Absolution to be pronounced by the Minister alone?

A. Because it is a branch of his Ministerial Function; and because it is an
act of authority, his manner is to do it standing.

Q. Why are the People to answer, Amen?

A. because it is a signification of their assent to the procedeing Prayer.

Q. Why is the Priest to begin the Lord's Prayer with an audible voice?

A. 1. That the Congregation may the better hear, and join with the Minister in
that most Excellent part of service. 2. To show how boldly, and yet humbly too,
we may pray to the Father, when we use his Son's both Name and Word.


Q. Why is the Lord's Prayer so frequently used in our Liturgy?

A. 1. Because it is the pattern of Prayer. 2. Because it is the most absolute
and perfect Form, and gives perfection to all the rest. 3. In imitation of our
Savior, who often repeated the same words.


Q What are the following Verses with their Responds?

A. Canonical Scripture sorted out for this place.

Q. Why do we Pray by way of Respond?

Devotion. 2. To strengthen Affection. 3. To oblige the Worshippers to greater
Attention and Intention,


Q Why is Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, so
often used? And why at the end of every Psalm, and why standing?

A. 1. Because it is of ancient use, by which we avouch our Doctrine and Faith
of the Trinity against all opposers. 2. That we may reduce that to practice,
which is the scope of every Psalm; and that is, to give Glory to God. 3. We
stand to show our cheerfulness in giving glory to God, and how resolved we are
to stand fast in the Faith of the Holy Trinity.


Q Why is, As it was in the beginning, added?

A. Against the Arrians, who had introduced a new form of Doxology to the
dishonor of Christ.

A. To be as an impression invitatory to the following Psalms; and let us pray;
is usually premised to incite intention to an ensuing Prayer.

Q. Why do Psalms immediately follow?

A. Because it was the Ancient Mode.

Q. Why do we begin with Psalm 95.

A. Because it is the fittest in all the Service Book to conform us to the
right use of all the rest, and to furnish out the service of God in all due
reverence.

Q Why are the Psalms ordered to be read over monthly, and why was it the use
for the Priest to read one verse, and the people another:

A. That they may be made the more familiar to the people, for they are of all
Scripture the fullest of Devotion; besides it was the ancient practice so to
read them: And the Reasons why they were thus read by way of Response, are
these, 1. That we may thus strive who should serve God most affectionately,
which is pleasing to God. 2. That by relieving one another, we may not grow
weary of God's Service.


Q. Why were the Psalms read standing?

A. That the Erection of the Body might express the Elevation of the Mind.

Q. Why after the Psalms are two Lessons appointed to be read, one out of the
Old Testament first, and then another out of the New?

Agreement of both Testaments, that we may see that fulfilled in the one, which
was foreshewed in the other.


Q. Why are Hymns appointed to be read after the First and Second Lesson?

A. St. Paul presses the use of Hymns, and Christ practiced it, and it became
the practice of the Church.

Q What is the proper posture for Hymns?

A. Standing. 1. To show our cheerfulness in it. 2. It being a proper gesture
for praise, which is a part of God's Worship.


Q. Why is the 100. Psalm joined with the Song of Zachary?

A. Because they parallel one another, both being Thanksgivings unto God,
enforced with the same Reasons and Arguments.

parallel.

Scripture?

A. Because this standing, or stationary posture implies a resolution to stand
fast in that Faith which we profess.

Q. Why is it called the Creed?

A. Because it contains the Credenda, i.e. Matters to be believed: The word
being derived from the Verb Credo, which signifies to believe. It being a short
sum of Christian Doctrine, containing all things necessary to be believed in
order to salvation.

Q. Why is it called the Apostles Creed?

gathered out of their Writings, and so theirs for the matter.

Q. What are the following Prayers?

A. Short Prayers selected out of the Scriptures, full of piety and devotion:
wherein observe, 1. The Priest's salutation to the people, and then the peoples
re-saluting the Priest out of the Scriptures. 2. The Priests or Ministers
stirring up the people, which is frequently used when we are to enter upon any
new part of service, because we are apt to grow dull in our devotions.


Q. Why is, Lord have mercy upon us, twice repeated? And why before the Lord's
Prayer?

A. 1. To notify the Trinity we pray to, is it thrice repeated. 2. Before the
Lord's Prayer, because it is expedient we implore God's mercy before we use
that Prayer.


Q. What are the fol^owing Verses with their Responds? The Minister, as a
sinner kneels with the People in all Confessions of Sins, and Penitential
Prayers: as a Priest, he stands in other Offices, to signify his Office and
Authority, which Office relates to God, and so is he in God's stead, ^ Cor.
5.20. to the people, Heb. 5.1. and in the peoples stead to Godward.


A. Short, agreeable to Scripture, St. Mat. 8.1, 24.
Short Prayers of divine extraction most what taken out of the Psalms, and
therefore is the Minister to pronounce them standing.

People?

Question and Answer.

are open to God. 2. To show us, that without the gracious assistance of God's

that is good, which drives us to Christ, who can strengthen us to all things,
