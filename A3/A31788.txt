THE KINGS MAJESTY'S ANSWER, To a late Petition presented unto him by the hands
of Mr. ALEXANDER HENDERSON, from the COMMISSIONERS of the General ASSEMBLY of
the Kirk of SCOTLAND.

WITH Their humble REMONSTRANCE and renewed PETITION to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty, from their meeting at EDINBURGH, June 2. 1643.

EDINBURGH, Printed by ROBERT BRYSON. 1643.

His Majesty's Answer to a late Petition presented unto him by the hands of
Mr. ALEXANDER HENDERSON, from the Commissioners of the general Assembly of
the Church of SCOTLAND.
WE received lately a Petition from you, by the hands of Mr. Alexander
Henderson, To the which we intended to have given an answer, as soon as we had
transacted the business with the other Commissioners addressed to us from the
Conservators of the Treaty of that our Kingdom. But finding the same to be
published in Print, and to be dispersed throughout Our Kingdom, to the great
danger of Scandalling of Our well-affected Subjects, who may interpret the
bitterness and sharpness of some expressions not to be so agreeable to that
regard and reverence which is due to our Person, and the matter it self to be
reproachful to the honor and constitution of this Kingdom, we have been
compelled the more strictly to examine as well the Authority of the
Petitioners, as the matter of the petition it self, and to publish our opinion
of both, that our Subjects of both Kingdoms may see how equally, just, and
sensible we are of the Laws and honor of both Our Kingdoms.

And first, upon perusal of the Petition, We required to see the Commission by
which the messenger who brought this Petition, or the persons who sent him, are
qualified to intermedle in Affairs so foreign to their jurisdiction, and of
so great concernement to this our Kingdom of England. Upon examination
whereof, and in defense of the Laws and Government of this our Kingdom, which
we are trusted and sworn to defend, We must profess that the Petitioners, or
the general Assembly of Our Church of Scotland have not the least Authority or
power to intermeddle or interpose in the affairs of this Kingdom or Church,
which are settled and established by the proper laws of this Land, and till they
be altered by the same competent power, cannot be enveighed against without a
due sense of Us and this Nation, much less can they present any advice or
declaration to Our Houses of Parliament against the same, or to that purpose to
send any letters, as they have now done, to any Minister of Our Church here,
who by the Laws of this land cannot correspond against the same. Therefore we
do believe that the Petitioners, when they shall consider how unwarranted it is
by the Laws of that Kingdom, and how contrary it is to the Laws of this, to
the professions they have made to each other, and how unbecomming in it self
for them to require the ancient, happy and established government of the
Church of England to be altered, and conformed to the laws and constitutions
of another Church, will find themselves misled by the information of some
factious persons here, who would willingly engage the Petitioners to foment a
difference and division between the two Kingdoms, which we have with so much
care and industry endeavored to prevent, not having labored more to quench
the combustion in this Kingdom, then we have to hinder the like from either
devouring Ireland, or entering into Scotland, which if all others will equally
labor, will undoubtedly be avoided. But we cannot so easily pass over the
mention of Ireland, being moved to it by scandalous aspersions, that have bin
often cast upon us upon that subject, and the use that has been made of the
woeful distractions of that Kingdom, as of a Seminary of fears and jealousies
to beget the like distraction in this, and (which lest they may have farther
influence) We are the more willing to make Our innocence appear in that
particular.

When first that horrid Rebellion began, We were in Our Kingdom of Scotland,
and the sense we had then of it, the expressions we made concerning it, the
Commissions (together with some other assistance) we sent immediately into that
Kingdom, and the instant Recommendation we made of it to both Our Houses of
Parliament in England, are known to all persons of quality there and then
about Us. After Our return into England, Our ready concurring to all the
desires of both Houses that might most speedily repress that horrible
Rebellion, by passing the Bill of pressing, and in it a clause which quitted a
right challenged by all, and enjoyed by many of Our Predecessors, by parting
with Our Rights in the lands escheated to Us by that rebellion, for the
encouragement of adventures, by emptying of Our Magazines of Arms and
Ammunition for that service (which we have since needed for our necessary
defense and preservation) by consenting to all Bills for the raising of money
for the same, though containing unusual clauses, which trusted both Houses
without Us with the matter of disposing it, Our often pressing both Houses, not
to neglect that Kingdom, by being diverted by considerations and disputes
less concerning both Kingdoms, Our offer of raising 10000. Volunteers to be
sent thither, and Our several Offers to engage Our own Royal person in the
suppression of that horrid rebellion are no less known to all this Nation,
then Our perpetual earnestness by our Foreign Ministers to keep all manner
of supplies from being transported for the relief of the Rebels, is known to
several neighboring Princes. Which if all Our Subjects will consider, and
withal how many of the men, and how much of the money raised for that end, and
how much time, care, and industry have been diverted from that employment, and
employed in this unnatural war against Us, (the true cause of the present
misery and want which Our British armies there do now endure) they will soon
free us from all those imputations so scandalously and groundlesly laid upon
us, and impute the continuance of the Combustion of that miserable Kingdom,
the danger it may bring upon our Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and the
beginning of this doleful desolation, to those who are truly guilty of it.

For unity in Religion: which is desired, We cannot but answer, That we much
apprehend lest the Papists may make some advantage of that expression, by
continuing that scandal with more authority, which they have ever heretofore
used to cast upon the Reformation, by interpreting all the differences in
Ceremony, Government, or indifferent opinions between several Protestant
Churches, to be differences in Religion; And lest our good subjects of
England, who have ever esteemed themselves of the same Religion with you,
should suspect themselves to be esteemed by you to be of a contrary. And that
religion which they and their ancestors have held ever since the blessed
reformation, and in and for which they are resolved to dye, is taxed and
branded of falsehood or insufficiency, by such a desire.

For uniformity in Church Government, We conceived the answer formerly given by
us to the former petition in this argument, would have satisfied the
petitioners, and is so full, that we can add little to it. viZ. That the
government here established by the laws, has so near a relation and
intermixture with the Civil State (which may be unknown to the petitioners)
that til a composed disgested form be presented to us, upon a free debate of
both Houses in a Parliamentary way, whereby the consert and approbation of this
whole Kingdom may be had, and We and all our subjects may discern, what is to
be left in, or brought in, as well as what is to be taken away, We know not how
to consent to any alteration, other wise then to such an act for the ease of
tender consciences in the matter of Ceremonies, as We have often offered and
that this, and any thing else that may concern the peace of the Church, and
the advancement of Gods true Religion may be soberly discussed, and happily
effected, We have formerly offered, and are still willing that debates of that
nature may be entered into by a Syned of godly and learned Divines, to be
regularly chosen according to the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom. To which
we shall be willing that some learned Divines of our Church of Scotland be
likewise sent, to be present and offer and debate their Reasons. With this
answer the petitioners had great reason to acquiesce without enlarging the
matter of their former petition only with bitter expressions against the
established government and laws of their neighbor Nation, (as if it were
contrary to the word of God) with whom they have so lately entered into a strict
amity and friendship.

But we cannot enough wonder, that the petitioners should interpose themselves,
not only as fit directors and judges between Us and Our two Houses of
Parliament, in business so wholly concerning the peace and government of this
our kingdom, and in a matter so absolutely entrusted to us, as what new laws
to consent or not to consent to, But should assume and publish, That the desire
of reformation in this kingdom is in a peaceable and Parliamentary way, When
all the world may know, That the proceedings here, have been and are not only
contrary to all the rules and precedents of former Parliaments, but destructive
to the freedom, privilege, and dignity of Parliaments themselves: that we
were first driven by tumults, for the safety of our life, from our cities of
London and Westminster, and have been since pursued, fought withal, and are
now kept from thence by an army raised, as is pretended, by the two Houses,
which consist not of the fourth part of the number they ought to do, the rest
being either driven from thence by the same violence, or expelled or imprisoned
for not consenting to the treasons and unheard of Insolences practiced against
us, And if the petitioners could believe these proceedings to be in a peaceable
Parliamentary way, they were very unacquainted with the order and constitution
of this Kingdom, and not so fit instruments to promote that reformation and
peace: they seem to desire.

We cannot believe the intermixture of the present Ecclesiastical government
with the Civil State, to be other then a very good reason, and that the
government of the Church should be by the rules of humane policy, to be other
then a very good rule, unless some other government were as well proved as
pretended to be better warranted by God.

Of any bills offered us for reformation, we shall not now speak, they being a
part of those articles upon which we have offered and expect to treats but
cannot but wonder by what authority you prejudge our judgment herein, by
denouncing Gods anger upon us, and our hazard of the loss of the hearts of all
our good Subjects, if we consent not unto them. The influence of so many
blessings from heaven upon the reigns of Queen Elizabeth, and our father of
blessed memory, and the acknowledgement of them by all Protestant Churches to
have been careful nurses to the Church of Christ and to have excellently
discharged their duties in the custody and vindication of religion, and the
affection of their Subjects to them, do sufficiently assure Us, that we should
neither stop the influence of such blessings, nor grieve the hearts of all the
godly, nor hazard the loss of the hearts of our good Subjects, although we
still maintain in this Kingdom the same established Ecclesiastical
government, which flourisht in their times, and under their special protection.

We doubt not but our Subjects of Scotland will rest abundantly satisfied with
such alterations in their own Church as we have assented unto, and not be
persuaded by a mere assertion, that there is no hope of the continuance of what
is there settled by law, unless that be likewise altered which is settled here,
And our Subjects of England will never depart from their dutiful affection to
Us, for not consenting to new laws, which by the law of the land, they know, We
may as justly reject if we approve not of them, as either house has power to
prepare for, or both to propound to us. Nor are you a little mistaken if either
you believe the generality of this Nation to desire a change of
Church Government, or that most of those who desire it, desire by it to
introduce that which you only esteem a reformation, but are as unwilling to
what you call the yoke of Christ and obedience to the Gospel, as those whom
you call profane and worldly men, and so equally averse both to Episcopacy and
Presbytery, that if they should prevail in this particular, the abolition of
the one would be no inlet to the other, nor would your hearts be less
grieved, your expectations less frustrated, your hopes less ashamed, or your
reformation more secured. And the petitioners, upon due consideration, will not
find themselves less mistaken in the government of all the reformed Churches,
which they say is by Assemblies, then they are in the best way of a
reformation, which sure is best to be in a common and ordinary way, where the
passion or interest of particular men may not impose upon the public, but
alteration be then only made, when, upon calmed debates, and evident and
clear Reason and convenience, the same shall be generally consented to for the
peace and security of the people, and those who are trusted by the Law with
such debates, are not divested of that trust upon a general charge of
corruptions pretended to have entered by that way, and of being the persons to
be reformed, and so unfit to be Reformers And certainly the like Logic with
the like charges and pretenses might be used to make the Parliament it self an
incapable Judge of any Reformation either in Church or State.

For the general expressions in the Petition against Papists, in which the
petitioners may be understood to charge Us with compliance and favor even to
their opinions, We have taken all occasion to publish to the world Our
practice and resolution in the true protestant Reformed Religion, and we are
verily persuaded there is no one Subject in either of our Dominions, who at all
knows Us, and has observed our Life; but is in his soul satisfied of our Zeal
and unremoveable Affection to that Religion, and of our true dislike of, and
hearty oposition to popery, And as we willingly consented, at our being in
Scotland, to all acts proposed to Us, for the discountenancing and Reforming
the Papists in that our Kingdom, so by our Proclamations for the putting of
all Laws severally in execution against Recusants, and by not refusing any one
Bill presented to Us to that purpose in this Kingdom, and by our perpetual
and public professions of Readiness with the advice of Our two Houses of
Parliament prepared for Us in a deliberate and orderly way, to find some
expedition to perfect so good a work, or conceived we had not left it
possible for any man to believe Us guilty of tolerating any part of the Romish
Tyranny or Superstition, or to suspect that the Conversion of our dearest
Consort, was not so much our desire, that the Accession of as many Crowns, as
God has already bestowed upon us, would be more welcome to us then that day: A
blessing which it is Our daily prayer to the almighty to bestow upon Us.

But we might well have expected from the Petitioners, who have in their
solemn National Covenant literally sworn so much Care and safety of Our
Person, and cannot but know in how much danger that has bin and still is by
the power and threats of Rebellious Arms, that they would as well have
remembered the 23 of October, as the 5 of November, and as well have taken
notice of the Army raised and led against Us by the Earl of Essex, which has
actually assaulted and endeavored to murder Us, which we know to abound in
Brownists, Anabaptists, and other sectaries, and in which we have reason (by
the prisoners we have taken, and the evidence they have given) to believe there
are many more Papists (and many of those forraigners) then in all our army, as
have advised Us to disband out of the army of the Earl of New castle, which is
raised for Our defense, the Papists in that Army, who are known to be no such
number as to endanger their obtaining any power of building their Babell, and
setting up their Idolatry, and whose loyalty he has reason to commend
(though he was never suspected for favoring their Religion) not before that of
Protestants, but of such as rebel under that Title; And whose assistance is as
due to us by the law of God, and man, to rescue Us from domestic Rebellion, as
to defend us from foreign invasion, which we think no man denies to be
lawful for them to do. But we do solemnly declare and protest, That God shall
no sooner free us from the desperate and rebellious arms taken up against Us,
but we shall endeavor to free our selves and King dome from any fear of danger
from the other, by disarming them according to the laws of this Land, as we
shall not fail to send our Commissioner to the Assembly at the time appointed
for it by the laws of Scotland.

To conclude, We desire and require the Petitioners (as becomes good and pious
Preachers of the Gospel) to use their utmost endeavors to compose any
distraction in opinions, or misunderstandings, which may by the faction of some
turbulent persons, be raised in the minds of Our good Subjects of that Our
Kingdom, and to infuse into them a true sense of Charity, Obedience, and
Humility, the great principles of Christian Religion; That they may not suffer
themselves to be transported with things they do not understand, or think
themselves concerned in the Government of another Kingdom, because it is not
according to the customs of that in which they live; But that they dispose
themselves with modesty and devotion to the service of Almighty God, with duty
and affection to the obedience of us and our laws (remembering the singular
Grace, Favor and Benignity We have always expressed to that Our Native
Kingdom) and with brother-therly and christian charity one toward another;
And We doubt not but God in his mercy to Us and them will make us instruments
of his blessings upon each others, and both of us a great measure of happiness
and prosperity to the whole nation.

FINIS.
To the Kings most excellent Majesty. The bumble Remonstrance and renewed
Petition of the Commissioners of the General Assembly of the Kirk of
SCOTLAND, from their meeting at Edinburgh the 2. day of June. 1643.
AS the manifold and pressing necessity of the duty of our place and trust
did constrain us, in these distempered and dangerous times, in most humble
manner, To direct our earnest supplication to your Majesty, for such remedies
as we conceive to be most fit for us to propone, And being applied by your
Majesty's own hand, might both for cure and prevention prove most effectual:
So are we enforced by the same necessity growing daily to the greatest
extremity; In all humility and earnestness, To renew not only our prayers to
God, but our Petitions to your Majesty. For Sions sake can we not hold our
peace, and for Jerusalems sake we will not rest, until the righteousness
thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as alamp that
burns. But because in your Majesty's answer to our former Petition we meet
with a multitude of prejudices and exceptions against us and our humble
desires, we will crave leave, first to remove these out of the way:
Acknowledging the full expression of them by your Majesty to be no small
favor, and being confident, after we have expressed our selves in the truth
and integrity of our hearts, both to give unto and to receive from your
Majesty's Justice and goodness the greater satisfaction.

And first, although there be good reason for printing of Answers and Replies,
the Petition being before printed, yet we acknowledge that your Majesty has
just cause to find fault with that publishing of our Petition in print (which
is mentioned in the introduction to your Majesty's answer) And if it had been
done by our Commandment, counsel or knowledge, we had not only given your
Majesty just provocation, and fallen in an error contrary to the nature of a
Petition, and to the right disposition of Petitioners, but also had used means
contrary to our own ends, in publishing a programme of our diffidence of
obtaining our desires, or in giving a public testimony that we were aiming at
some other thing then what we professed to seek, And therefore we are so far
from excusing that form of doing, that we judge our selves to be wronged
thereby.

Another fault much more intolerable is objected against us: The bitterness
and sharpness of some expressions which may be interpreted by your Majesty's
well affected Subjects not to be so agreeable to that regard and reverence
which is due to your Majesty's person, and the matter it self to be
reproachful to the honor and constitution of that your Majesty's Kingdom.
Whether the matter of the Petition be reproachful shall afterward in the
particulars appear: But for the expressions we have examined the whole Petition
and can find no word of that kind. We rather did fear the censure of
fauning and flattering words, which your Majesty may remember were sometime
put upon our supplications. Our desire was to keep within the bounds of that
liberty which beseems the Ministers of Christ, and if any word have escaped
us which we cannot see, it was contrary to our intention: for we know that we
should neither speak evil of dignities nor unreverently unto them. The like
report has been made to your Mejestie of our preaching and prayers, but when
the de. lators are tried, they will be found either malicious against us for
reproving their faults; Or having no other way of insinuation, too officious to
your Majesty, or to others whom they desire to please, or so blinded with
self-love, that they think Preachers should speak like Parasites; or so
undiscerning, that when we profess our desire to the reformation of Religion
in England and Ireland, we are fansied by them to preach or pray against the
King and his royal authority. We fear God, and honor the King, And have
learned not only to put a difference betwixt God and the King, but also
(against the old sophistication now revived) betwixt the pictures of the
Emperor and the images of the false gods, craftily insert into them, and know
the way how to honor the King without such a mixture and confusion. Slownesse
to believe an evil report and the constructing of things doubtful is one of
your Majesty's royal praises, of which the faithful Ministers of this Kirk
desire, against slanders and suspicions to have the experience: which will
prove profitable for your Majesty's honor and obedience, and our peace and
quietness. As the north wind drives away rain: So does an angry countenance
a back biting tongue. Righteous lips are the delight of Kings: and they love
him that speaks right.

Concerning the interposing of the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland,
and our intermedling by commission from them in the affairs of the Kirk of
England, We humbly entreat your Majesty, to consider of the reasons of this
our doing. 1. Although the Kirks of one Nation be distant in place from the
Kirks of another Nation, yet are they united in heart and spirit, and are
generally but one body and Kirk and must as Sisters of one Mother keep the
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace: whence arises the communion of all
Gods graces and blessings amongst the Kirks, that they may not only help,
comfort and refresh: but advise, admonish, exhort, warn and reprove one
another, so far as need requires and their Christian love and ability
reaches. Yet avoiding both ambition and confusion: there being a coordination
between Kirkes of diverse Nations, but no subordination: We have not presumed
to pass the limits of this Christian communion: having proceeded by way of
charity, and in a ministerial or rather brotherly manner, not by authority or
Magisterially: by way of humble supplication to your Majesty, Declaration to
the house of Parliament, and advice and exhortation to such of our brethren of
the Ministry as were best known unto us: very far from usurpation or
jurisdiction. 2. Our humble petition to your Majesty and our Declaration to
the Parliament, were nothing else, but a prosecution of the demand made by the
Commissioners of this Kingdom, and a pressing of the answer given by your
Majesty and the Parliament, in the last treaty; which filled us with hope of
what was then demanded, since followed by diverse Declarations and now again
desired. 3. The experience of the sufferings of this Kirk from the doctrine,
for me of worship and government of the Kirk of England, Does beget fears of
the like hereafter, which makes our petition to be unto us a necessare mean
of self preservation. 4. Our encouragements from your Majesty's Letter to the
General Assembly and the Declaration of the house of Parliament desiring them
to concur in petitioning your Majesty for settling one confession of Faith, one
directorie of the public worship and one Catechism in all the three Kingdoms
as a mean to advance the honor and service of God, enlarge the greatness
power and glory of the King, confirm the peace, security and prosperity of
all his good Subjects, make way to the relief and deliverance of the poor
afflicted Kirks abroad and to the total abolishing of the usurpation and
tyranny of Rome. 5 The pattern we have of this Christian duty both by word
and writing in the Kirk at Jerusalem and the Kirk at Antioch, which was first
crowned with the name of Christians, The one of which were Jews, and the other
Gentiles; And in diverse other Kirks recorded in Scripture. many Precedents
also in antiquity before the Kirks did contend for primacy, or knew any
pre-eminence one over another Many examples of other reformed Kirks; And the
practice of the Kirk of Scotland diverse times after the Reformation writing
into England against the ceremonies and for union against the Papists and their
confederats banded together by the bloody league of Trent. These and the like
reasons we conceive did sufficiently authorize us in all that we have done,
not as Directors or Judges but as supplicants and humble advisers. In that day
shall there be a high way one of Egypt into Assyria (from one Kirk and Nation
of the Gentiles to another) And the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians,
whom the Lord of Hosts shall bless.

Upon this and the like grounds, have letters been sent professedly, between
some godly loyal and peaceable Ministers of the Kirk of England and the
General Assembly here, and their Commissioners: One of the means intended for
the good of Religion in both Kingdoms against Sects and Shismes, admitted and
approven by your Majesty's Commissioners, in the General Assembly, and which
for the form of doing is innocent and may be profitable, unless the matter
be nocent and hurtful and thereby deserves censure. We wish we were able by
our Letters, Declarations, or Petitions; To reduce all the reformed Kirks to a
perfect conformity, to suppress all the Heresy, Superstition and Tyranny of
Papists, and the Paganism of Turks and Insidels, and would not doubt of your
Majesty's Roy all approbation not withstanding all the Laws standing to the
contrary, and plea's, could be made for their antiquity, happiness and
stabilitie, Common arguments and colors pretended for every Religion, and of
late answered to the full in the point of Episcopal government, from the
verity of Scripture which is true antiquity and the only solid ground of the
happiness and stabilitie of Religion and government of the Kirk.

The Petitioners were far from laying upon your Majesty any Imputation of the
Irish-rebellion beseeching God to manisest your Sacred Majesty's innocence to
all the world. They made mention of the miseries of Ireland for no other end,
but to represent the danger of your Majesty's Kingdoms through the prevailing
power of the Popish faction, The British Papists at this time being animated by
the same spirit, working upon the same principles, enraged with the same
furies, breathing out the same threatenings and slaughter, aiming at the same
ends, and emboldened with the same presumptions, with the Papists of Ireland,
their confederates. And withal to present our earnest desires for a
pacification, that both the armies may be sent against that horride rebellion,
and peace restored to all your Majesty's Dominions.

The expression in our Petition of Unity in Religion, we have borrowed from
the Article in the Treaty accorded unto by your Majesty; from the
Declarations of the Parliament; and from the General Assembly: By which is
meaned no other thing but one Confession of Faith, one common directorie for
worship, and one Gate chisme. The Papists may know that the true Kirk in all
ages has been troubled with differences and contentions as great as any now
against the reformed Kirks, which many of the godly have lamented and studied
to compose, and (as it was written of some heretics of old) They themselves
sacrifice in schism and dissension, and greet the world with the name of
peace, whom they drive from the peace of their salvation. They therefore cannot
hence authorize their scandal against the reformation: yet the smallest
differences of practice and diversity of the expressions, are matter of strife
to the contentious, of hinderance of edification to the ignorant, of stumbling
to the weak, and of grief to the godly, when thereby they see against
religious Unity and Christian love, the bowels of the Kirk rent assunder, and
people scandalously divided in some parts of the worship of God: All which
evil, might be perfectly cured in all your Majesty's dominions the mouths of
Papists scopped, schism and separation hereafter prevented, and the face of
the Kirk filled with true beauty and splendour to your Majesty's greater glory
and the greater terror of all your enemies, by this blessed and never enough
desired Unity in Religion: Without which tender consciences being freed from
constrain may be in some degree eased by your Majesty, but shall never have
rest and be satisfied; nor shall the rent of the Kirk arising from different or
contrary practices be cured, but shall from time to time increase.

Concerning uniformity in Kirk government, our hopes thereof and of the unity
of Religion grounded upon the Article of the Treaty, made this Kirk and
Kingdom to enter into the more strict amity and friendship with England. And
that the amity and friendship builded upon such a foundation might be the more
firm and durable, they have since pressed the same by their Petitions and
Declarations, in all humility and love without any bitterness of expression:
Only they have declared the government of the Kirk by Assemblies in their
strong and beautiful order and subordination to be by divine right, and that
as Prelacie is confessed in this your Majesty's answer to be by the rule of
humane policy, so to be almost universally acknowledged by the Prelates
themselves and their adherents to be but a humane institution, introduced by
humane reason, and settled by humane law and custom, for supposed conveniencie;
which therefore by humane authority, without wronging any man's conscience, may
be altered and abolished upon so great a necessity, as is, a hearty
conjunction of all the reformed Kirks, a firm and well grounded peace between
the two Kingdoms, formerly divided in themselves and betwixt themselves by
this partition wall, and a perfect Union of the two Kirks in the two Nations;
which although by the providence of God in one Island, and under one Monarch,
yet ever since the Reformation have been at greater difference in the point of
Kirk government (which in all places has a powerful influence upon all the
parts of Religion) then any other reformed Kirks, although in nations at
greatest distance and under diverse Princes. Papacy is the greatest cause of
schism in the Christian Kirk, and Episcopacie devised by man to be a cure,
the greatest cause of schism in the reformed Kirks.

As the mutual relation and conjunction of true Ecclestasticall and Civil
government is a corroboration of both, so do we conceive that both are much
weakened in their proper functions by that intermixture of the Ecclesiastical
government with the Civil State. And as we know the principles of Prelacie to
be Popish, and contrary to the principles of Reformation: So have we reason to
believe, That such an intermixture is not for your Majesty's honor, while they
maintain and profess that Monarchy cannot subsist without Prelacie: And that
Prelacie had not been cast out of the Parliament if it had been profitable
there; And thought fit to be altogether abolished, if it had not been an
unprofitable burden to the Kingdom, and pernicious to the civil State and
common wealth, As is contained more fully in the Declaration of both Houses of
Parliament to the General Assembly.

The following of humane inventions, without and against Scripture and the
ambition and covetousness of Kirkmen were observed of old to be the
corruptions which made many to call upon the Pope and the chief guides of the
Kirk at that time for a reformation: but all in vain, for that had been their
own ruin, to which in humane reason, they would never willingly have
consented. That upon the same causes and corruptions there is a necessity of
the reformation of the Kirk of England, Is as unanimously confessed, as it is
universally acknowledged, that it is unlikely if not impossible; to be obtained
in the regulate and ordinary way: Upon the reason expressed afterward in your
Majesty's answer. Because in the common and ordinary way the passion or
interest of particular men will impose upon the publict: For what greater
private interest then benefits and dignities? Who more interessed in these then
Bishops, Deans, Arch. deacons and such ordinary members of the convocation? And
ho can be more sueyed and by assed with passion then such as have this
interest? Whether this be applyable to the Parliament whose places and
dignities are uncontroverted and unquestionable, it is not for us to judge: but
this we know when the corruptions of the Kirk are grown to such an height, that
she can neither bear her diseases, nor endure the remedies, it is the duty of
the magistrate and civil authority, by the advice of the more sound and
sincere part of the Kirk and Ministry, to endeavoure a reformation, since no
reformation, worthy of that name, can be expected from the corrupt Clergy,
nor has at any time Religion been that way in any tolerable measure reformed:
When the evils are extraordinary, the remedies must be other then ordinary.
Scripture, reason and experience of the Kirk teach in such an exigence of
reformation and extreamitie of debates and contentions, to call a Synod of the
best Divines, best acquainted with the will of God in Scripture freest of
humane inventions and innovations, and farrest from pride and avarice; which
are the evils to be purged out, and for afterward prevented; And who against
all Sects and Shismes unfainedly seek the peace and unity of the Kirk which
by all good means both for it self and for the truths sake is to be
procured and preserved. When by this remedy faithfully applied and accompanied
with prayers and tears of repentance; the worship of God and the government of
the Kirk are settled, not after the rules of humane policy but according to
Scripture, there is hope that God will end his contraversie with England and
bliss the treaties of peace betwixt your Majesty and your Parliament; which
is now our humble desire and when it comes to pass shall be the universal
rejoicing of all your good people.

We should be not only unchristian but disloyal and unnatural, if we were
not affected and afflicted with your Majesty's many sufferings and the troubles
of your Kingdoms, and did not heartily wish that your Majesty were present in
your parliam. assembled in the most peaceable and Parliamentary way, to your
Ma. greater glory and their greater strengthening for the good of the Kingdom.
For the present the houses of Parliament have professed in their Declaration to
the General Assembly, their desires and willingness to settle such a
reformation of the Kirk; as shall be most agreeable to the word of God, and
most apt to procure and conserve an happy union with the Kirk of Scotland in a
peaceable and Parliamentary way; And have passed their bills in both houses
without contradiction against Episcopal government, and offered them to your
Majesty for obtaining your Royal consent This is the peaceable and
Parliamentary way meant by us and mentioned in our Petition, which we trust can
give your Majesty no just offense.

Although the Ministers of the Gospel have authority in some cases to preach
and write not only exhortations and blessings but also threats and sentences of
judgment against Kings and Kingdoms, which howsoever they be bitter and
unpleasant for the present (and therefore seldom ministered to Princes) may
prove very profitable and cordial afterward: Many had perished in their sins
if it had not been told them that they were to perish; faithful are the wounds
of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful: and he that rebukes,
afterward shall find more favor then he that flattereth with the tongue Yet
upon good reason have we abstained from this strain of denuncing of judgment
against your Majesty, having only from the conscience of our duty in anguish
of our souls, faithfully represented the duty and danger with our earnest
deprecation of the wrath not only now incumbent, but yet seven times more
imminent to your Kingdoms, which we daily more and more apprehend; shall
ensue, unles by a through reformation of Religion and manners it be timeously
prevented. By this our liberty we have delivered our own souls and endeavored
to deliver your Majesty and your Dominions from the present and future
judgments, which both love and fear constrain us now again; To entreat your
Majesty to hearken unto.

As we cannot deny, but do reverently acknowledge the influence of many and
great blessings from heaven upon the reign of Queen Elizabeth and your
Majesty's father of blessed memory: So do we not doubt but your Majesty in
your Christian and Royal wisdom will consider: that the supreme providence
which has set your Majesty after them upon the throne, has appointed a time
for every action. A wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment, and
where it is not discerned, the misery of man, wrestling with invincible
providence, is great upon him. The many blessings upon the Kings of Egypt,
Babylon and other Princes, were interrupted in the time of their successors,
which opposed the deliverance of the people of God from the Egyptian bondage,
the Babylonian captivity, the foolishness of Paganism and the tyranny of
Popery, when the time of their deliverance was come. Many of the godly before
your Majesty's reign have desired and supplicated the Parliament for a
reformation but the desires were never so universal as now; Prelacie never so
insolent nor the evils thereof so well known and so deeply felt; nor was it
ever voted out of the Parliament, nor agreed in Parliament to be abolished in
the Kirk; nor stood merely upon the Royal consent of the King, till this time.
Arminianisme has entered, Papistrie has increased, Sectaries have multiplied,
sufferings have abounded, Tender consciences disquieted with old and new
ceremonies, much more of late then before that all eyes may see how many things
concur now to make a necessity of reformation. It is the never dying honor
of your Majesty's late Progenitors above others that were before them that they
did begin, continue and preserve reformation, and shall be your Majesty's
greatest and immortal glory to perfect it, with Josiah leaving nothing to
imped or obscure the glory of God: An happiness which the people of God in
this Island have long waited for, which God calls for at your hands and we
trust has reserved for our times, as a special and incomparable honor to
your Majesty above the best princes, and matter of joy to your people above
all other in former ages.

As the continual comfort and daily sense of the inestimable benefit of the
reformation of this Kirk in worship and government should stir up our hearts,
to the love of God, whose hand principally did bring it about, in a way full of
marvels and full of mercies, And thankfulness to your Majesty whom we look
upon not as a naked assenter unto alterations, but as a prime instrument of
settling a blessed reformation in this Kirk; So does the same comfort and
sense excite in us a fear to loss that which we so much love in a way wherein
it has rune hazard before. Our fears are not counterfeit to bring any design
of our own, nor politic or created in us by the authority of any assertion of
others to bring any design of theirs to pass, nor panick or maginarie to
torment our selves without cause; But are true and real, grounded upon reason
which teaches to beware of contagion in so near a vicinitie and where there is
so frequent commerce and conversing, upon by past experience of evils from
English Prelacie ever since the beginning of reformation and upon present and
daily tasting of the fruits which partly of its own corrupt nature, and partly
through the corruptions of men, It has brought forth and fomented. And though
the Petitioners cannot judge nor should intermedle with questions about your
Majesty's and the Parliaments power, yet may they well profess from that which
every one may understand that the denying of the people their earnest desires
may quench that fervor of affection which is due from a people to their Prince.

Whether the generality of the Nation desires a change of Kirk government,
cannot be better known then by the desires and Propositions of the
representative hodie of the Kingdom, nor can it be better defyned what
gogovernment shall be established than in a Synod of learned and godly Divines.
Our part is to wish the pattern is Scripture and the example of the best
Reformed Kirks to be followed, and to pray that God by his Spirit may lead them
into all truth: being confident that reformation having begun by your Majesty's
authority at the head and chiefest parts, all sectaries, and all the inferior
members may be quickly by a Synod brought to such order as may consist with
truth and with the peace of the Kirk.

It was far from our intentions by the general expressions of our Petition
against Papists, To charge your Ma. with compliance and favor to their
opinions. We do from our hearts bless God for all that your Majesty has done
both here and in England against them, and for so free and ample a testimony
of your Majesty's desires of the Queens conversion. Jealousies of that kind,
and hopes in the hearts of such as are popishly affected, of their prevailing
power, proceed from the power of Papists in Ireland, the present posture of
Papists armed about your Majesty in this dangerous time of combustion in
England, and that for so long a time through the connivence or compliance of
the Ministers of estate, laws, have not been execute against them, nor any
means at all used for the Queens conversion. A necessary and essential duty,
from which no oath to the contrary can more give dispensation, then any oath of
old or late, public or private, can bind your Majesty to maintain
Episcopacie or any corruption in the worship of God, or government of the
Kirk, when God by his word gives light and by his providence calls for a
Reformation. All which had need to be seriously and tymously considered. And if
the Papists be not speedily disarmed, the danger is that both in their own
project, and upon the hearing of your Majesty's Declaration to disarme them,
when there shall be no more use of their service, they band together and bend
all their wits against a Pacification, till by their gathering and growing to
greater strength, they be able to plead in equal terms for themselves, for
their share in the places and honors of the Kingdom, at lest for peace and
tolleration, as a reward of all their pains, charges and hazards, pretended to
be for your Majesty's honor and safety, but really intended for themselves
and their superstition. We cannot conceive that loyalty can be without
allegiance, or that Papists refusing to take the oath of allegiance, do fight
in loyalty and allegiance to your Majesty, but for their own ends, nor can it
be safe for Protestants to trust them upon the principles of their profession,
in any whether intestine or foreign war. In the time of the greatest
foreign invasion year 88. It was not thought safe to arm the Papists in
defense of the Kingdom. We did not take notice of Papists in the other army,
in our Petition to your Majesty, but did in our Declaration to the Parliament,
that although they had professed in their Declarations that they had no known
Papists in their Army, yet if any were found to be, we desired they might in
like manner be disbanded. Brownists, Anabaptists, and other sectaries which are
the fruits of Prelacie one way as Papists are another, are neither so easily
known as Papists nor so much to be feared: and although they be enemies to
Religion and to the peace of the Kirk, we know not whether they have been so
considerable that the law has taken so far notice of them as to disarme them.

We have so sincerely and from the inward of our spirits, with our hearts and
hands lifted up to the most high God the searcher of hearts, sworn the care of
the safty of your Majesty's person, and of your greatness and authority,
which we have also witnessed in our Declarations to the Houses of Parliament,
that our hearts within us were wounded when we did hear of the danger your
Majesty's person was in the 23 of October. And as we do with the Houses of
Parliament (as is expressed in their Declaration) rejoice and heartily praise
God for your safety, So do we not cease to pray for your Majesty's preservation
in the midst of so many dangers, and for a speedy deliverance by a happy
peace, which we trust shall bury that black and unnatural day so unhappie and
dangerous both to you: Majesty and your people in eternal oblivion, And
therefore not to be paralelled by us with the unparalelled plot of the 5 of
Novem. never to be forgoten.

We have detained your Majesty longer then your great affairs of governing
Kingdoms in the time of war could well permit, but not so long as the charge
committed to us by the General Assembly, and the importance of our Petition,
which is of religious and public concernment does require. The cry me of
bitterness and want of reverence to your Majesty, the challenge of
usurpation, the aspersion of so much and manifold mistaking, we would bear the
more patiently if we were to be considered as private and particular persons,
and not as Commissioners of public trust: And yet do bear the more patiently,
because we take them (and in this no man shall persuade us that we are
mistaken) to proceed from the pen of the writer, and not from your Majesty's
justice and goodness, unto which we are bold to appeall from his unjust
censure, and from such slanderous tongues and pens as by traducing the
preaching and prayers of the ministry here of disloyalty or sedition, do much
wrong us, your Majesty much more, and truth and peace most of all. Your
Majesty in your wisdom will consider what such Sycophants are seeking, and
in your justice will rather believe our public testimony, in things best
known to our selves and to our ordinary hearers, then any private information
flowing from the malice of some, or the weakness of others. And now in your
royal goodness will be graciously pleased to suffer us your Majesty's most
humble and faithful Subjects to fall down at your feet, and with all
earnestness to renew our Petition, especially that of Unity in Religion, and
uniformitie of Kirk Government in all your Majesty's Dominions, which we
conceive to be principally intended by divine Providence in these unhappie
distractions and troubles of your Majesty's Kingdoms; And to this effect for
such an Ecclesiastical Assembly, as has been formerly described and desired:
A mean so pious, so just and so ordinary in such cases as malice itself can
have no color to object against your Majesty for using it. And which shall
speedily bring on a firm and well grounded peace, and with peace all other
blessings spiritual and temporal upon your Majesty and your Kingdoms.
