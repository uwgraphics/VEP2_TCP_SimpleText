The Art of ANGLING.

WHEREIN Are discovered many rare Secrets, very necessary to be known by all
that delight in that Recreation.

LONDON, Printed in the Year 1653.

The Art of Angling.
REader: I will complement, and put a case to you. I met with a man, and upon
our Discourse he fell out with me: this man having a good weapon, having
neither wit, stomach, nor skill; I say this man may come home by
Totnam-high-Cross, and cause the Clerk to tole his knell: It is the very like
case with the Gentleman Angler that goes to the River for his pleasure: this
Angler has neither judgment, knowledge, nor experience; he may come home
light laden at his pleasure.

A man that goes to the River for his pleasure, must understand, when he
comes there, to set forth his Tackles. The first thing he must do, is to
observe the Sun, the Wind, the Moon, the Stars, and the Wanes of the Air; to
set forth his Tackles according to the times and seasons; to go for his
pleasure, and some profit.

As for example, the Sun proves cloudy; then must he set forth either his
ground Bait or Tackles, and of the brightest of his Flies. If the Sun prove
bright, then must he put on some of the darkest of his flies. Thus must you go
to work with your Flies, light for darkness, and dark for lightness, with the
wind in the South, then that blows the Fly in the Trouts mouth. Though I set
down the wind being in the South, if the weather be warm, I am indifferent
where the wind stands, either with ground Bait or Menow, so that I can cast
my Bait into the River. The very same observations is for night, as for day:
For if the Moon prove clear, or if the Stars glitter in the sky, there is as
ill Angling that night, as if it were at high noon in the midst of Summer, when
the Sun shines at the brightest, wherein there is no hopes of pleasure.

I will begin to Angle for the Trout, with the ground Baits with this quality.

The first thing you must gain, must be a neat taper Rod, light before, with a
tender hazell top, which is very gentle. If you desire to attain my way of
Angling, (for I have Angled these forty years) with a single hair of five
lengths, one tied to another for the bottom of my Line, and a Line of three
haired links for the uppermost part; and so you may kill the greatest Trout
that swims, with Sea-room.

He that Angles with a Line, made of three haired links at the bottom, and more
at the top, may kill Fish: but he that Angles with one hair shall kill five
Trouts to the others one; for the Trout is very quick sighted; therefore the
best way for night or day, is to keep out of the sight. You must Angle always
with the point of your Rod down the stream; for a Fish has not the quickness
of sight so perfect up the stream, as opposite against him, observing
seasonable times; as for example, we begin to Angle in March; If it prove
cloudie, you may Angle with the ground Baits all day long: but if it prove
bright and clear, you must take the morning and evening, or else you are not
like to do any good; so the times must be observed, and truly understood; for
when an Angler comes to the River for his pleasure that does not understand
to set forth his Tackles fit for the time, it is as good keep them in the bag,
as set them forth.

I am determined to Angle with the ground Baits and set my Tackles to my Rod,
and go to my pleasure: I begin at the uppermost part of the stream, carrying
my Line with an upright hand, feeling the Plummet running on the ground some
ten inches from the hook, plumming my Line according to the swiftness of the
stream you Angle in; for one plummet will not serve for all streams; for the
true Angling is that the plummet runs on the ground.

For the Bait. The red knotted worm is very good where Brandlins are not to be
had, but Brandlins are better: now that you may bring these Brandlings sit to
Angle with, that they may live long on the hook, which causes the best sport.
When you have gathered your worms out of the dunghill, you must gain the
greenest Moss you can find, then wash the earth very clean out of it, then
provide an earthen pot, so put your Moss into the pot, then put the worms to
the Moss into the pot; within two days you shall find your worms so poor, that
if you bait some of them on your hook, you shall see that with throwing of them
two or three times into the water, they will dye and grow white: now the skill
is, when these worms be grown poor, you must feed them up to make them fat and
lusty, that they may live long on the hook; that is the chiefest point.

To make them lusty and fat, you must take the yolke of an Egg, some eight or
ten spoonful of the top of new milk, beaten well together in a Porringer, warm
it a little, until you see it curdle; then take it off the fire, and set it to
cool; when it is cold, take a spoonful and drop it upon your Moss into the
pot, every drop about the bigness of a green Pea, shifting your Moss twice in
the week in the Summer, and once in the winter: thus doing, you shall feed your
worms fat, and make them lusty, that they will live a long time on the hook;
so you may keep them all the year long. This is my true experience for the
ground Baits, for the running Line for the Trout.

The Angling with a Menow, called in some places Pencks for a Trout, is a
pleasant sport, and kills the greatest Fish; he comes boldly to the Bait,
as if it were a Mastive Dog at a Bear: you may Angle with greater Tackles, and
stronger, and be no prejudice to you in your Angling: a Line made of three
silks and three hairs twisted for the uppermost part of the Line, and two
silks and two hairs twisted for the bottom next your hook, with a Swivel
nigh the middle of your Line, with an indifferent large hook.

To bait your hook with a Menow, you must put your hook through the lowermost
part of his mouth, so draw your hook through, then put the hook in at the mouth
again, let the point of the hook come out at the hindmost Fin, then draw your
Line, and the Menowes mouth will close, that no water will get into its belly;
you must always be Angling with the point of your Rod down the stream, with
drawing the Menow up the stream by little and little, nigh the top of the
water; the Trout seeing the bait, comes at it most fiercely, so give a little
time before you strike: This is the true way, without Lead; for many times I
have had them come at the Lead and forsake the Menow, so he that tries shall
prove it in time: let us go to Angling with a Fly, which is a delightful
sport.

The Rod must be light and tender, if you can fit your self with an Hazell,
either of one piece or two set together in the most convenient manner, light
and gentle: set your Line to the Rod; for the uppermost part, you may use your
own discretion; for the lower part, next your Fly, must be of three or four
haired links. If you can attain to Angle with one hair, you shall have the
more rises, and kill more fish; be sure you do not over-load your self with
the length of your Line: before you begin to Angle, make a trial, having the
wind in your back, to see at what length you can cast your Fly, that the Fly
light first into the water, and no longer; for if any of the Line falls into
the water before the Fly, it is better unthrowne then thrown: be sure you be
casting always down the stream, with the Wind behind you, and the Sun
before; it is a special point to have the Sun and Moon before you; for the
very motion of the Rod drives all the pleasure from you, either by day or night
in all your Angings, both for Worms and Flies; so there must be a great care
of that.

Let us begin to Angle in March with the Fly: If the weather prove Windy, or
Cloudie, there are several kinds of Palmers that are good for that time.

First, a black Palmer ribbed with silver: the second, a black Palmer with an
Orange-tauny body: thirdly, a black Palmer, with the body made all of black:
fourthly, a red Palmer ribbed with gold, and a red hackle mixed with Orange
cruel; these Flies serve all the year long morning and evening, windy and
cloudie. Then if the Air prove bright and clear, you must imitate the
Hauthorn Fly, which is all black and very small, and the smaller the better.
In May take the May-flie: imitate that, which is made several ways; some make
them with a shammy body, ribbed with a black hair: another way made with
Sandy-Hogges wool, ribbed with black silk, and winged with a Mallards
feather, according to the fancy of the Angler. There is another called the
Oak-Flie, which is made of Orange color Cruel and black, with a brown wing;
imitate that: Another Fly, the body made with the strain of a Pea-Cocks
feather, which is very good in a bright day: The Grasse-hopper which is green,
imitate that; the smaller the Flies be made, and of indifferent small hooks,
they are the better; these sorts I have set down, will serve all the year
long, observing the times and seasons: Note, the lightest of your Flies for
cloudy and darkness, and the darkest of your Flies for lightness, and the
rest for indifferent times; that a man's own Judgment, with some experience
and discretion must guide him: If he mean to kill Fish, he must alter his Flies
according to these directions. Now, of late, I have found, that Hogs-wooll, of
several colors, makes good grounds; and the wool of a red Heyfer makes a
good body: And Bears wool makes a good ground; so I now work much of them, and
it procures very much sport.

The natural Fly is sure Angling, and will kill great store of Trouts with
much pleasure: As for the May-Flie, you shall have them always playing at the
River side, especially against Rain. The Oake-Flie is to be had on the butt
of an Oak, or an Ash, from the beginning of May to the end of August: it is a
brownish Fly, and stands always with his head toward the root of the tree,
very easy to be found: The small black Fly is to be had on every Hawthorn
Bush, after the buds be come forth: Your Grasse-hopper, which is green, is to
be had in any Meadow of Grass in June or July: with these Flies, you must Angle
with such a Rod as you Angle with the ground Bait; the Line must not be so long
as the Rod: with drawing your fly, as you find convenient in your Angling.
When you come to deep waters that stand somewhat still, make your Line some two
yards long, or thereabout, and dop your Fly behind a a Bush, which Angling I
have had good sport at; we call it doping.

A Lord lately sent to me at Sun going down, to provide him a good dish of
Trouts against the next morning by six of the Clock: I went to the door to see
how the wains of the Air were like to prove, and returned answer, that I
doubted not but to be provided (God willing) at my time appointed. I went
presently to the River, and it proved very dark; I drew out a Line of three
silks and three hairs twisted for the uppermost part, and a Line of two silks
and two hairs twisted for the lowermost part, with a good large hook: I baited
my hook with two Lob-worms, the four ends hanging as meet as I could guess
them in the dark: I fell to Angle; it proved very dark, that I had good sport,
Angling with the Lob-worms, as I do with the Fly, at the top of the water;
you shall hear the Fish rise at the top of the water, then you must loose a
slack Line down to the bottom, as nigh as you can guess, then hold a straight
Line; feeling the Fish bite, give time, there is no doubt of losing the Fish;
for there is not one among twenty, but does gorge the Bait: the least stroke
you can strike to fasten the hook, makes the fish sure, and then you may take
the fish up with your hands: The night began to alter and grew somewhat
lighter; I took off the Lob-worms, and set to my Rod a white Palmer Fly, made
of a large hook, I had sport for the time, till it grew lighter: then I put on
my red Palmer, I had sport for the time, until it grew very light; then I set
on my black Palmer, had good sport, made up my dish of fish, put up my Tackles,
and was at my time appointed for the service. For these three Flies, with the
help of the Lob-worms, serve to Angle all the year long, observing the times,
as I have showed in this nights work: a light Fly for darkness, the red Fly in
medio, and a dark Fly for lightness: This is my experiment for this kind of
Angling, which is the surest Angling of all, and kills the greatest Fish:
your Lines may be strong, but must be no longer then the Rod.

To take a Carp either in Pond or River, if you mean to have sport with some
profit, you must take a peck of Ale-graines, and a good quantity of any blood,
and mix the blood and grains together, and cast it in the places where you
mean to Angle; this feed will gather the seal Fish together, as Carp, Tench,
Roach, Dace, and Bream; the next morning be at your sport very early, plum your
ground: you may Angle for the Carp with a strong Line; the Bait must be either
a red knotted worm, or Paste: there is no doubt of sport.

To take Perch. The Perch feeds well, if you light where they be, and bites
very free: My opinion is, (with some experience) to bait with Lob-worms, chopped
in pieces over night; so come in the morning, betimes, plum your ground, gage
your line, bait your hook with a red knotted worm; but I hold a Menow better:
put the hook in at the back of the Menow, betwixt the fish and the skin, that
the Menow may swim up and down alive, being boyed up with a Cork or Quill, that
the Menow may have liberty to swim a foot off the the ground: there is no
doubt of sport with profit.

I will show, a little, my opinion of floating for scale Fish in the River or
Pond: The feed brings the Fish together, as the sheep to the Pen: There is
nothing better in all your Anglings, for feed, then Blood and Grains; I hold it
better then Paste: then plumming your ground, Angling with fine Tackles, as
single hair for half the Line next the hook, round and small plumed,
according to your float: For the Bait, there is a small red worm, with a yellow
tip on his tail, is very good; Brandlins, Gentles, Paste, or Cadice, which we
call Cod-bait, they lie in a gravelly husk under stones in the River: these be
the special Baits for these kind of Fish.

One of my name was the best Trouler, for a Pike, in this Realm: he laid a
wager, that he would take a Pike of four foot long, of Fish, within the space
of one Month, with his Trouling-Rod; so he Trouled three weeks and odd days,
and took many great Pikes, nigh the length, but did not reach the full length,
till within the space of three days of the time; then he took one, and won the
wager. The manner of his Trouling was, with a Hazell Rod of twelve foot long,
with a Ring of Wyre in the the top of his Rod, for his Line to run through:
within two foot of the bottom of the Rod there was a hole made, for to put in
a wind, to turn with a barrel, to gather up his Line, and loose at his
pleasure; this was his manner of Trouling: But I will pawn my credit, that I
will show a way, either in Mayor, Pond, or River, that shall take more Pikes
than any Trouler with his Rod: And thus it is. First, take forked stick, a Line
of twelve yards long wound upon it, at the upper end, leave about a yard,
either to tie a bunch of Sags, or a Bladder, to Boy up the Fish, and to carry
it from the ground: the Bait must be a live Fish, either Dace, or Gudgin, or
Roach, or a small Trout: the forked stick must have a slit in the one side of
the fork to put in the Line, that you may set your live Fish to swim at a
gage, that when the Pike takes the Bait, he may have the full liberty of the
Line for his feed.

You may turn these loose, either in Pond or River: in the Pond with the wind
all day long, the more the better: at night set some small weight, as may stay
the Boy, as a Ship lies at Anchor, till the Fish takes. For the River, you
must turn all loose with the stream; two or three be sufficient to show
pleasure, gaged at such a depth as they will go current down the River; there
is no doubt of sport, if there be Pikes: for the hooks, they must be doubled
hooks, the shanks should be somewhat shorter then ordinary: my reason is, the
shorter the hook is of the shank, it will hurt the live Fish the less, and
must be armed with small wyre well softened; but I hold a hook armed with
twisted silk to be better, for it will hurt the live Fish least.

If you arm your hook with wyre, the neeld must be made with a small hook at
the one end thereof. If you arm with silk, the neeld must be made with an
eye: then must you take one of those Baits alive (which you can get) and with
one of your neelds enter within a strawes breadth of the Gill of the Fish, so
put the neeld betwixt the skin and the Fish; then pull the neeld out at the
hindmost sin, and draw the arming through the Fish, until the hook come to
lie close to the Fishes body: But I hold for those that be armed with wyre to
take off the hook, and put the neeld in the hindmost sin and so to come forth
at the Gill; then put on the hook drawn close to the body, 'twill hurt the live
Fsh the less, so knit the arming with the live Fish to the Line; then put off
either in Mayor or Pond, with the wind, in the River with the stream: The more
you put off in Mayor or Pond, you are like to have the more pleasure: For the
River I have showed you before.

There is a time when Pikes go a Frogging Ditches, and in the River to Sun
them, as in May, June and July, there is a speedy way to take them, and not to
miss scarce one in twenty.

You must take a Line of six or eight foot long, arm a large hook, of the
largest size that is made; arm it to your Line, lead the shank of your hook
very handsome, that it may be of such a weight as you may guide the hook at your
pleasure: you may strike the Pike, you see, with the bare hook where you
please: this Line and hook does far exceed snaring.

The principal sport to take a Pike, is to take a Goose or Gander, or Duck:
take one of the Pike Lines I have showed you before: tie the Line under the
left wing, and over the right wing, about the body, as a man wears his Belt:
turn the Goose off into a Pond, where Pikes are, there is no doubt of sport,
with great pleasure, betwixt the Goose and the Pike: It is the greatest sport
and pleasure that a noble Gentleman in Shropshire does give his friends
entertainment with.

The way to make the best paste is, Take a reasonable quantity of fresh Butter,
as much fresh sheeps Suet, a reasonable quantity of the strongest Cheese you
can get, with the soft of an old stale white loaf; beat all this in a Mortar
till it come to perfect paste; put as much on your hook as a green pease.

There are many ways to take Eeles: I will show you a good way to take a dish
of Eeles. When you stay a night or two Angling, take four or five Lines, such
as be laid for Pikes, of fourteen or fifteen yards long, and at every two yards
make a noose, to hang a hook armed either to double thread, or silk twist; for
it is better then wyre: Bait your Hooks with Millors-thumbs, Loaches, Menowes,
or Gudgins: tie to every noose a Line baited: these Lines must be laid cross
the River in the deepest places, either with stones, or pegged, so the Line lie
in the bottom of the river, there is no doubt of taking a dish of Eeles; you
must have a small neeld with an eye, to bait your hooks.

Now to show how to make Flies: learn to make two Flies, and make all: that is,
the Palmer ribbed with silver or gold, and the May-flie: these are the ground
of all Flies.

We will begin to make the Palmer Fly: You must arm your Line on the inside
of the hook; take your Scisers, and cut so much of the brown of the Mallards
feather, as in your own reason shall make the wings, then lay the outmost part
of the feather next the hook, and the point of the feather toward the shanke
of the hook, then whip it three or four times about the hook with the same silk
you armed the hook: then make your silk fast: then you must take the hackle of
the neck of a Cock or Capon, or a Plovers top, which is the best, take off the
one side of the feather, then you must take the hackle silk, or cruel, gold or
silver thread; make all these fast at the bent of the hook, then you must begin
with Cruel, and Silver, or Gold, and work it up to the wings, every bout
shifting your fingers, and making a stop, then the gold will fall right, then
make fast: then work up the hackle to the same place, then make the hackle
fast: then you must take the hook betwixt your finger and thumb, in the left
hand, with a neeld or pin, part the wings in two: then with the arming silk, as
you have fastened all hitherto, whip about as it falls cross betwixt the
wings, then with your thumb you must turn the point of the feather toward the
bent of the hook, then work three or four times about the shank, so fasten,
then view the proportion.

For the other Flies: If you make the grounds of Hogs-wooll, sandy, black, or
white; or the wool of a Bear, or of a two year old red Bullock: you must work
al these grounds upon a waxed silk, then you must arm and set on the wings, as
I have showed before: For the May-flie, you work the body with some of these
grounds, which is very good, ribbed with a black hair; you may work the body
with Cruels, imitating the Color, or with Silver, with suiting the wings. For
the Oak-flie, you must make him with Orange-tauny and black, for the body, and
the brown of the Mallards feather for the wings. If you do after my directions,
they will kill fish, observing the times fitting, and follow my former
Directions.

If any worthy or honest Angler cannot hit of these my Directions, let him come
to me, he shall read and I will work, he shall see all things done according to
my foresaid Directions: So I conclude for the Flies having showed you my true
Experiments, with the Rod, I will set all laboring sports aside:

And now I am waiting on my Lord with a great Dish of Trouts, who meeting with
company, commanded me to turn Scullion, and dress a Dinner of the Trouts we
had taken: whereupon I gave my Lord this Bill of fare, which I did furnish his
Table with, according as it was furnished with flesh. Trouts in broth, which is
restorative: Trouts broyled, cut and filled with sweet Herbs chopped: Trouts
calvored hot with Antchovaes sauce: Trouts boiled; out of which Kettle I make
three Dishes; the one for a Soused Dish, another for a Stewed Dish, the third
for a hot Dish: the Sauce is Butter, Vinegar, beaten Cinnamon, with the juice of
a Lemmon, beaten very well together, that the Sauce is white and thick, or else
it is no Sauce for a great man's Table: Trouts fried, which must be done, and
not put into the Pan, until the Suet boil very high, and kept with stirring
all the time they are frying, being flowr'd first. Trouts stewed: Trouts close,
boiled with the calvored Trouts, all in one Kettle and the same liquor: Trouts
buttered with Eggs: Trouts roasted: Trouts baked: these are for the first
course, before the Salt.

And these are for the latter course. Trouts calvored cold: Trouts flat cold:
Baked Trouts: Trouts marilled, that will eat perfect and sweet three months in
the heat of Summer: if I did say, for the whole year about, I would make it
good.

For the dressing of four or five of the Dishes, I will show you how I did
perform them.

First, I will show you for the boiling and calvoring, that serves for hot and
cold, for first and latter course.

First, you must draw out the Intrails of the fish, cutting the fish two or
three times in the back; lay them in a Tray or Platter, put some Vinegar upon
them; you shall see the fish turn sanguine, if they be new, presently: you must
put so much water in the Kettle as you think will cover them, with a pint of
Vinegar, a handful of Salt, some Rosemary and Thyme and sweet Marjoram tied in
a bunch: then you must make this liquor boil with a fierce fire made of wood:
when the liquor has boiled very well, put in your fish by one and one, keeping
your liquor always boiling, until you have put all in: having provided a
cover for your Kettle, so put on the cover: you must have a pair of Bellows
to blow up the fire with speed, that the liquor may boil up to the top of the
Kettle; so the fierce boiling will make the Fish to calvor: provided, the fish
be new killed: you may let them boil nigh a quarter of an hour; when they are
cold, you may put them in a Tray or earthen Pan, until you have occasion to
use them: be sure they lie covered.

For your stewed Trouts, you must cut them on the side, as for broiling: there
are diverse ways of stewing; the English has one way, the French has another
way, the Italian has another way: I may speak this; for I have been admitted
into the Kitchins, to furnish men of most Nations, when they have been in
England.

We will begin with the English: He broyleth first upon a Charcoale fire: the
first thing that you must have a care of is, when your Grid-iron is hot you
must cool it with ruff Suet, then the skin of your Fish will not break, with
care of turning them: when they are nigh broyled, take them off the Grid-iron;
set on a Chafing Dish of coals in a Stew Pan, or Dish; put in a good quantity
of fresh Butter, so much Vinegar as will give the relish, a pennyworth of
beaten Cinnamon; then put in your broyled fish, and let them stew, about half
an hour will be sufficient, being turned: adorn your Dish with Sippets, take
the fish out of the stew pan, lay them for the service, be sure to squease a
Lemmon on them: I will warrant them good victual.

The Italian he stews upon a Chasing-dish of coals, with White Wind, Cloves,
and Mace, Nutmegs sliced, a little Ginger: you must understand when this fish
is stewed, the same liquor that the fish is stewed in, must be beaten with some
Butter and the juice of a Lemmon, before it is dish'd for the service. The
French do add to this a slice or two of Bacon.

I will show you the way to marrionate a Trout or other fish, that will keep a
quarter of a year in Summer, which is the Italians rarest Dish for fresh fish,
and will eat perfect and sweet.

You must take out the Intrailes as you do of other fish, and cut them
a-crosse the sides, as you do to broyle, washed clean, dried with a cloth, lay
them upon a Tray or board, sprinkle a little salt on them, and flower them as
to fry them, so take your Drying Pan with so much Suet, when it is melted, as
the Fish may lie to the midside in the liquor, and so fry them; and every time
you turn them, flower them again, until you find the fish fried sufficient:
when you think the fish is fried, take it out of the Pan, and lay it upon some
thing, that the liquor may draine out of it; when the fish is cold, you may
rear it an end.

You must have a close Vessel to keep this fish and liquor in, that no wind
comes in, according to the quantity you make trial of.

For the Liquor. First, you must take half Claret Wine, the other half
Vinegar, two or three Bay Leaves, so much Saffron as a Nut tied in a cloth,
with some Cloves and large Mace, some Nutmeg sliced; boil all these together
very well; when the liquor is cold, and the fish cold, put the fish and liquor
into the close Vessel, with three or four Lemmons sliced among the fish; make
all close that no wind can get into the Vessel; after eight or ten days you
may begin to eat of this fish; the Sauce must be some of the same liquor, with
some of a sliced Lemmon.

To dress a Pike. When the Pike comes into the Kitchen, kill it; then take a
handful of Salt, with water, and rub the fish very well to take the slime off,
draw out the Intrailes; wash the Pike clean, put a handful of Salt in the
Pikes Belly; then take so much water, with a pint of Vinegar: if the Pike be
any thing large, you must put in at least three handful of Salt, with a bunch
of Rosemary, Thyme, and sweet Marjoram, and two or three green Onyons; boil
your liquor very well with a high fire made of wood; then put in your Pike,
cover your Kettle, with your Bellows keep your Kettle boiling very high for
the space of half an hour or thereabouts: a Pike asks great boiling: for
the Sauce, it is sweet Butter well beaten with some of the top of the same
liquor, with two or three Antchovaes, the skin taken off, and the bones taken
out, a little Vinegar, so garnish your Dish: when your Pike is Dished, take the
juice of a Lemmon and put on the top of the fish: there is no doubt but it is
good victual.

I could set down as many ways to dress Eeles, as would furnish a Lords
Table: but I will relate but one.

Take off the skin whole, till you come within two inches of the tail,
beginning at the head: take out the Intrailes, wash the Eele clean, dry it
with a cloth, scotch it all along both the sides; take some Pepper and Salt,
mix them together, rub the Eele well with the Pepper, and Salt; draw the
skin on again whole; tie the skin about the head with a little thread
lapped round, broyled on a Charcoale fire, let your Grid-iron be hot, rub your
Grid-iron with some ruff Suet; the skin will not burn; this is good; but
take the skin off, and stew the Eele betwixt two Dishes, on a Chafing Dish of
Coals, with sweet Butter, Vinegar, and beaten Cinnamon, they will be better.

The boiling of a Carp is the very same way as I have showed for the Trout, the
scales on: no better Sauce can be made then the Antchovaes Sauce. The high
boiling is the way for all fresh water Fish: I have served seven times seven
years, to see the experiment.

If there be any Gentleman that lives adjoining to a River side, where Trouts
are; I will show the way to bring them to feed, that he may see them at his
pleasure; and to bring store to the place. Gather great Garden-Wormes, the
quantity of a pint, or a quart, chop them in pieces, and throw them where you
intend to have your pleasure; with feeding often, there is no doubt of their
coming; they will come as Sheep to the Pen: you must begin to feed with pieces
of worms, by hand, by one and one, until you see them eat; then you may feed
with Liver or Lights, so your desire will be effected. And thus I conclude this
short Treatise.

FINIS.
