THE METHOD OF GRACE, In bringing home the Eternal Redemption, Contrived by the
FATHER, and accomplished by the SON through the effectual application of the
Spirit unto GOD's Elect; being the Second Part of GOSPEL REDEMPTION: WHEREIN
The great mystery of our Union and Communion with Christ is opened and
applied, Unbelievers invited, False pretenders convicted, every man's claim to
Christ examined, and the misery of Christless persons discovered and bewailed.

Honored and Worthy Friends,
IT was a comfortable expression which Ambrose used in his Funeral Oration at
the death of Theodosius; Theodosius tantus imperator recessit a nobis, sed non
totus recessit; reliquit enim nobis liberos suos, in quibus debemus eum
agnoscere. Ambros. in obit. Theodos.
that though he were gone, yet he was not wholly gone; for he had left Honorius
with others of his Children behind him, in whom Theodosius still lived. Your
renowned and worthy Ancestors are gone, yet blessed be God, they are not wholly
gone; whilst the prudence, piety and publickness of their Spirits still lives
and flourishes in you, the topbranch of a renowned and religious Family. It Is a
great truth which Philo Judaeus recommends to the observation of all posterity
(...). Philo Judaeus (...), A Book fit for the hands of all Gentlemen,
translated by Laurentius Humphredus in his excellent Tract de nobilitate.
that it is not a natural descent from the most honorable and illustrious
progenitors, nor the greatest affluence of riches and pleasures that makes a
man either honorable or happy; but the inhabitation of God in his soul, as in
his Temple, though (says he) those that never tasted Religion nor have seen
its glory will not credit this assertion. The soul which is filled with God,
says (...). ^otinus.
Plotinus, and brings forth the beautiful fruits of righteousness, this is the
truly noble soul: our new birth makes us more honorable than our natural
birth, let our birthright dignities be what they will. The Children of Nobles
are by nature the Children of wrath even as others: omnis sanguis concolor, all
blood is of one color; it is all tainted in Adam, and mingled together in his
posterity: there is no King says Neminem regem non ex servis esse oriundu^,
neminem servum non ex regibus: omnia ista longa varietas miscuit, and sursum
deorsum fortuna versavit. Senec. Epist. 44.
Seneca, which rose not from a servant: there is no servant which rose not from
a King: these things have been blended and tossed to and fro, by a long variety.

But though the privileges of natural birth signify nothing as to eternal
salvation, yet in civil and political respects and considerations, those that
by birth, education or estate possess an higher station in the world, differ
from the vulgaras stars of greater magnitude and luster: their interest and
influence is great in these things, and the welfare of Kingdoms Qui (...) ma
tractant gubernacula, qui privatis, qui publicis rebus intersunt ac praesunt,
nisi viri summi ac nobiles? Quis in senatu praeit, in foro praesidet, domi,
foris imperat? Principes sane viri and nobiles: quis jubet, vetat, agit,
satagit, quis versat and volvit omnia, quis leges fingit, and refingit, quis in
pace rempublicam, contra hosts bella administrat; praeterquam magni viri and
nobiles? Nec mirum ei rerum summa committi, qui and virtute sua, and
commendatione majorum, ad hominum famam and existimationem dimanavit.
Laurentius Humphredus de nobilitate, page (mihi) 64.
greatly depends upon them.

It is therefore a great design of the enemy of mankind to corrupt persons of
eminent rank and quality both in religion and morality; and by their influence
and example to infect and poison the whole body politic: and his success
herein deserves to be greatly lamented and bewailed. Persons of eminency are
more especially In maxima fortuna, minima est licentia. Salust.
obliged to shun base and sordid actions. Hierom professed Nih^l aliud video in
nobilitate appetendum, nisi quod nobiles quadam necessitate constringuntur ne
ab antiquorum probitate degenerent. Hieron.
he saw nothing desirable in nobility except this, that such persons are bound
by a certain kind of necessity not to degenerate from the probity, or stain the
glory of their Ancestors. But alas! how many in our times have not only exposed
Christianity to contempt, but obscured Faxit Deus opt. max. ut eum finem
consequatur, quem mihi proposui, quo tandem aliquando vetus and veneranda
nobilitas r^deat, quae prudentiae and dectrin^ gloria, and factorum splendore,
majorum lauds obscuret, inustamque augusto nomini suo maculam tollat and
deleat. Humph. de Nob. p. 58.
the glory of their own families, and the Kingdom in which they had their birth
and breeding; so that if you will take right marks of your way to Heaven, you
will have little direction from those of your own rank, but as Eadem ratione
hanc vitae viam quaeri oportet, qua in alto iter navibus quaeritur; nisi
aliquid coeli lumen observent, incertis cursibus vagantur: quisquis rectum iter
vitae tenure nititur, non terram debet aspicere, sed coelum; and ut apertius
loquar, non hominem debet sequi sed Deum: itaque si oculos in coelum semper
intendas, and solemn qua oritur, observes, eumque habes vitae quasi navigii
ducem; sua sponte pedes inviam dirigentur, Lactan. lib. 6. c. 8.
Mariners take their direction at Sea, by looking up to the Heavens, so must
you. In this general corruption it is very hard to escape infection: many (as
Salvian complained) Mali esse coguntur ne viles habeantur. Salv. de Gubernat.
are compelled to be evil, lest they should be accounted vile: and incur the
offense of God, to avoid the slights and censures of men. Although there is no
more reason why they should be offended at the rational and religious
pleasures, you and other pious Gentlemen take in the ways of godliness, than
there is that you should envy the sinful pleasures they take in the ways of
wickedness. It was an excellent Apology that Tertullian made for the Christians
of his time against the Gentiles, Quo vos offendimus si alias praesumimus
voluptates? si oblectari nolumus, nostra injuria est: reprobamus quae placent
vobis, nec vos nostra delectant. Tertul. Apolog. adv. Gent.
Wherein (says he) do we offend you, if we believe there are other pleasures?
If we will not partake with you in your delights, it is only our own injury: we
reject your pleasures, and you are not delighted with ours.

But by how much the infection spreads and prevails among those of your Order,
by so much the more we have reason to value you, and all those that remain
sound and untainted both in religion and morality, as persons worthy of
singular respect and honor, and blessed be God there is yet a number of such
left.

Sir, It was a special happiness which Chrysostom earnestly recommended to
persons of quality, that they would so order their conversations, that their
Parents might rather glory in them, than they in their Parents; Melius est de
contemptibili fieri clarum, quam de claro genere contemptibilem esse.
Chrysostom in Mat. 4. Nec fieri potest quin hunc comitetur ignobilitas etiamsi
vel A^is, vel Proavis natus sit vita inculpatis, qui ab eorum studiis alienus
est, seque longissime tum dictis, tum factis a-nobilitate disjungit.
otherwise (says he) it is better to rise to honor from a contemptible
Parent, than to be contemptible from an honorable Parent: but blessed be God,
you and your worthy Ancestors mutually reflect honor upon each other.

Had God suffered you to degenerate, as many do, it would have been but a poor
consolation to have said, my Progenitors were men of honor, the love and
delight of their Country. This as Quid oculis capto ad visum profuerit
perspicax majorum acies, cum ea privatus est? Vel quid ad interpretandi
facultatem, impeditae linguae hominem juverit, parents vel avos fuisse
vocales? Pari ratione, nec injustis justi parents, nec luxu perditis,
temperantes: nec omnino boni malis quicquam utilitatis afferunt, etc. Philo.
(...).
one excellently expresses it, would be the same thing as if one that is blind
himself, should boast what a sharp and piercing sight his father had, or one
that is lame himself should glory in those feats of activity his Grandfather
performed: but God (to whose bounty therefore you are doubly obliged) has made
you the inheritor of their virtues, as well as of their lands, and therein
fulfilled many thousand prayers which have been poured out to God upon your
account. But I must forbear, lest I provoke others to envy, and draw upon 1 ^
my self the suspicion of flattery: what has been already said may serve for a
sufficient reason of this Dedication. I know the Quando bona audientis and
grata men's est, facile assentitur sermonibus veritatis. Chryso. Hom. 26. in Mat.
agreeableness of such discourses to the pious dispositions of your souls is of
it self sufficient to make it welcome to you. It is a Treatise of Christ, yea,
of the method of grace in the application of Christ; than which no subject can
be more necessary to study, or sweet to experience. (...). Plato.
All goodness is attractive, how powerfully attractive then must Jesus Christ
be who is the ocean of all goodness, from whom all streams of goodness are
derived, and into whom they all empty themselves? (...).
If Pindarus could say of the lovely Theoxenus, that whosoever saw that august
and comely face of his, and was not surprised with amazement and inflamed with
love, must have an heart of Adamant or Brass, what then shall we resemble that
man's heart unto that has no fervorous affections kindled in it by the
incomparable beauty of Christ! A beauty which excels in luster and brightness
that visible light which so dazels our eyes (...). Plato.
as that light does darkness it self, as Plato speaks of the divine light.
Christ is (...) an inexpressible beauty, and all other beauties are but (...),
an image, nay a shadow of his beauty. How was holy Ignatius ravished with
desires after Christ when (...). Ignatius Epist.
he cried out, O how I long to be thrown into the jaws of those Lions which I
hear roaring for me! and if they will not dispatch me the sooner, (...), I will
enforce them to it by violence, that I may enjoy the sight of my blessed Jesus.
O Cor meum quomodo non te evellis post tantum decorem? Niremberg. Vivere renuo,
ut Christo vivam.
O my heart (says another) how is it thou art not drawn up by the very root by
thy desires after Christ? The necessity and the trial of our union with, and
interest in this lovely Lord Jesus, is the main subject of this discourse:
without the personal application of Christ by faith, our hopes of Heaven are
but deluding dreams, Heb. 3. 11. I swear in my wrath (...), if they shall enter
into my rest: what then? Nay, there is all: but it is a dreadful Aposiopesis
(as one calls it) such a pause, as may justly shake every vein of the
unbelievers heart: if they shall enter, as if he had said, if ever they come
into my glory, then say I am no God, for I have sworn the contrary.

I will not be tiresom, but conclude all in few requests to you, and to God for
you both. That which I request of you is,

(1.) That you will search and try your own hearts by these truths, especially
now when so great trials are like to be made of every man's root and foundation
in Religion. Account that your first work, which Bellarmine calls the first
error of Protestants, to make sure your interest in Christ; Primus
haereticorun^ error est, posse fideles eam notitiam habere de sua gratia, ut
certa fide statuant sibi remissa esse peccata. Bellarm. de justific. lib. 3.
cap. 3.
every thing is as its foundation is: a true Diamond will endure the smartest
stroke of the Hammer, but a false one will fly.

(2.) That you be humble under all that dignity and honor which God has put
upon you: be ye clothed with humility. It was the glory of the Primitive
Christians, that they Non eloquimur magna, fed vivimus. Tertul. Apolog.
did not speak but live great things. Humility will be the luster of your other
excellencies: Estates and Honors are but appendants and fine trappings which
add not any real worth, yet Narrant Bucephalum quoties nudus esset, equisonem
admittere in tergum voluisse: sed regiis phaleris and bullis decoratum, neminem
praeter regem ipsum tulisse: ita sane-fit in novis hisce optimatibus, etc.
how are some vain minds puffed up with these things! but ye have not so
learned Christ.

(3.) That you steddily persevere in those good ways of God in which you have
walked, and beware of heart or life apostasy. You expect happiness whilst God
is in Heaven, and God expects holiness from you whilst you are on earth. It was
an excellent truth which Tossanus Obtestor etiam vos liberos, and generos
charissimos ne illius veritatis evangelicae unquam vos pudeat: potest enim
laborare, sed non vinci veritas: and non semel expertus sum Dominum Deum
mirabiliter adesse iis qui coram ipso ambulant, and in sua vocatione sedulo and
integre versantur; licet ad tempus, odiis, aut simultatibus, aut calumniis
agitentur. Melch. Adams in vita Tossani.
recommended to his posterity in his last Will and Testament from his own
experience. I beseech you, says he, my dear Children and Kindred, that you
never be ashamed of the truths of the Gospel, either by reason of scandals in
the Church, or persecutions upon it; truth may labor for a time but cannot be
conquered, and I have often found God to be wonderfully present with them that
walk before him in truth, though for a time they may be oppressed with troubles
and calumnies.

(4.) Lastly, That you keep a strict and constant watch over your own hearts,
lest they be ensnared by the tempting, charming and dangerous snares attending
a full and easy condition in the world. There are temptations suited to all
conditions: those that are poor and low in estate and reputation, are tempted
to cozen, cheat, lie and flatter; and all to get up to the mount of Riches and
honors: but those that were born upon that mount, though they be more free
from those temptations, yet lie exposed to others no less dangerous, and
therefore we find, not many mighty, not many noble are called, 1 Cor. 1. 26.
Many great and stately Ships, which spread much sail, and draw much water
perish in the storms, when small Barks creep along the shore under the wind,
and get safe into their Port. Never aim-at an higher station in this world than
that you are in: Lugebat moribundus Hermannus plus temporis operaeque se
palatio quam Templo impendisse; luxum and vitiae Aulae, quae corrigere
debuisset, adjuvasse, atque ita multo peccati dolor, trepida spe divinae
clementiae, plurimo astantium horrore, anceps sui, anima aeternitatem ingressa
est. Hist. Bohem. lib. 11.
some have wished in their dying hour they had been lower, but no wise man ever
wished himself at the top of honor at the brink of eternity.

I will conclude all with this hearty wish for you, that as God has set you in
a capacity of much service for him in your generation, so your hearts may be
enlarged for God accordingly; that you may be very instrumental for his glory
on earth, and may go safe, but late to Heaven. That the blessings of Heaven may
be multiplied upon you both, and your hopeful springing branches; and that you
may live to see your Childrens Children and peace upon Israel. In a word, that
God will follow these truths in your hands with the blessing of his spirit, and
that the manifold infirmities of him that ministers them, may be no prejudice
or bar to their success with you or any into whose hands they shall come, which
is the hearty desire of

Your most faithful friend and Servant in Christ,Jo. Flavel.

THE EPISTLE.
Christian Reader,
EVery Creature by the instinct of nature, or by the light of reason strives to
avoid danger, and get out of harms way. The Cattle in the fields presaging a
storm at hand, fly to the hedges and thickets for shelter. The Fowls of Heaven
by the same natural instinct, perceiving the approach of Winter, take their
timely flight to a warmer Climate. This Plin. l. 18. c. 35. Virg. Georg. l. 1.
Naturalists have observed of them, and their observation is confirmed by
Scripture testimony: of the Cattle it is said, Job 37. 6, 7, 8. He says to the
Snow, be thou on the earth, likewise the small rain, and the great rain of his
strength; then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places: And of the
Fowls of the air it is said, Jer. 8. 7. The Stork in the Heavens knows her
appointed times, and the Turtle and the Crane, and the Swallow observe the time
of their coming.

But man being a prudent and prospecting creature, has the advantage of all
other Creatures in his foreseeing faculty; For God has taught him more than
the beasts of the earth, and made him wiser than the fowls of Heaven, Job 35.
11. And a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment, Eccles. 8. 5. For
as there are natural signs of the change of weather, Mat. 16. 3. so there are
moral signs of the changes of time and providence: yet such is the supineness
and inexcusable regardlesness of most men, that they will not fear till they
feel; nor think any danger very considerable, till it become inevitable.

We of this Nation have long enjoyed the light of the glorious Gospel among us:
it has shone in much clearness upon this sinful Island for more than a whole
Century of happy years: but the longest day has an end, and we have cause to
fear our bright Sun is going down upon us; for the shadows in England are grown
greater than the substance which is one sign of approaching night, Jer. 6. 4.
The beasts of prey creep out of their dens and coverts, which is another sign
of night at hand, Psalm. 104. 20. and the workmen come home apace from their
labors, and go to rest; which is as sad a sign as any of the rest, Job 7. 1,
2. Isa. 57. 1, 2. Happy were it if in such a juncture as this, every man would
make it his work and business to secure himself in Christ, from the storm of
Gods indignation which is ready to fall upon these sinful Nations. It is said
of the Egyptians when the storm of hail was coming upon the land, Exodus 9. 20.
He that feared the word of the Lord, made his servants and cattle flee into the
houses. It Is but an odd sight to see the prudence of an Egyptian out-vying the
wisdom and circumspection of a Christian.

God who provides natural shelter and refuge for all creatures, has not left
his people unprovided and destitute of defense and security in the most
tempestuous times of national judgments. It is said, Mic. 5. 5. This man
(meaning the man Christ Jesus) shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come
into our land, and when he shall tread in our Palaces: and Isai. 26. 20. Come
my people, enter thou into thy Chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide
thy self as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast.

My Friends, let me speak as freely as I am sure I speak seasonably. A sound of
judgment is in our ears; the Lords voice cries unto the City, and the man of
wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod and who has appointed it, Mica. 6.
9. All things round about us seem to posture themselves for trouble and
distress. Where is the man of wisdom that does not foresee a shower of wrath
and indignation coming? We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear and not of
peace. Ask ye now and see whether a man does travel with child? Wherefore do I
see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces
are turned into paleness. Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it;
it is even the day of Jacobs trouble, but he shall be delivered out of it, Jer.
30. 5, 6, 7.

Many eyes are now opened to see the common danger, but some foresaw it long
ago; when they saw the general decay of godliness every where, the notorious
Prophanity and Atheism that overspread the Nations; the spirit of enmity and
bitterness against the power of godliness wherever it appeared: and though
there seemed to be a present calm and general quietness; yet those that were
wise in heart could not but discern distress of nations with great perplexity
in these seeds of judgment and calamity: but as the Epha fills more and more,
so the determined wrath grows more and more visible to every eye: and it is a
fond thing to dream of tranquillity in the mid^ of so much iniquity. Indeed, if
these Nations were once swept with the besom of reformation, we might hope God
would not sweep them with the besome of destruction: but what peace can be
expected whilst the highest provocations are continued?

It is therefore the great and present concernment of all to provide themselves
of a refuge before the storm overtake them: for as Augustine well observes, non
facile inveniuntur praesidia in adversitate, quae non fuerint in pace quaesita,
O take up your lodgings in the Attributes and Promises of God, before the night
overtake you: view them often by faith, and clear up your interest in them,
that you may be able to go to them in the dark, when the Ministers and
Ordinances of Christ have taken their leave of you, and bid you good night.

Whilst many are hasting on the wrath of God by profaneness, and many by
smiting their fellow Servants; and multitudes resolve if trouble come, to fish
in the troubled waters for safety and preferment; not doubting whenever the
overflowing flood comes, but they shall stand dry: O that you would be mourning
for their sins, and providing better for your own safety.

Reader, it is thy one thing necessary to get a cleared interest in Jesus
Christ: which being once obtained, thou may face the storm with boldness, and
say Come troubles and distresses, losses and trials, prisons and death; I am
provided for you; do your worst, you can do me no harm: let the winds roar, the
lightnings flesh, the rains and hail fall never so furiously, I have a good
roof over my head, a comfortable lodging provided for me: my place of defense
is the munition of rocks, where bread shall be given me, and my waters shall be
sure, Isa. 33. 16.

The design of the ensuing Treatise is to assist thee in this great work: and
though it was promised to the world many years past, yet providence has
reserved it for the fittest season, and brought it to thy hand in a time of
need.

It contains the method of grace in the application of the great redemption to
the souls of men, as the former part contains the method of grace in the
impetration thereof by Jesus Christ. The acceptance God has given the former
part, signified by the desires of many for the publication of this; has at
last prevailed with me, (notwithstanding the secret consciousness of my
inequality to so great an undertakement) to adventure this second part also
upon the ingenuity and candor of the Reader.

And I consent the more willingly to the publication of this, because the
design I first aimed at could not be entire and complete without it; but
especially the quality of the subject matter which through the blessing and
concurrence of the spirit may be useful both to rouse the drousie Consciences
of this sleepy generation, and to assist the upright in clearing the work of
the spirit upon their own souls. These considerations have prevailed with me
against all discouragements.

And now, Reader, it is impossible for me to speak particularly and distinctly
to the case of thy soul, which I am ignorant of, except the Lord shall direct
my discourse to it in some of the following suppositions.

If thou be one that have sincerely applied and received Jesus Christ by faith,
this discourse through the blessing of the Spirit may be useful to thee, to
clear and confirm thy evidences, to melt thy heart in the sense of thy mercies,
and to engage and quicken thee in the way of thy duties. Here thou will see
what great things the Lord has done for thy soul, and how these dignities as
thou art his Son or Daughter by the double title of regeneration and adoption,
do oblige thee to yield up thy self to God entirely, and to say from thy heart,
Lord whatever I am, I am for thee, whatever I can do, I will do for thee, and
whatever I can suffer, I will suffer for thee; and all that I am or have, all
that I can do or suffer, is nothing to what thou have done for my soul.

If thou be a stranger to regeneration and faith; a person that make a
powerless profession of Christ; that have a name to live but art dead: here
it is possible thou may meet something that will convince thee, how dangerous
a thing it is to be an old creature in the new creatures dress and habit: and
what it is that blinds thy judgment, and is likeliest to prove thyruine: a
seasonable and full conviction whereof will be the greatest mercy that can
befall thee in this world; if thereby at last God may help thee-to put on
Christ as well as the name-of Christ.

If thou be in darkness about the state of thy own soul, and willing to have it
faithfully and impartially tried by the rule of the word, which will not warp
to any man's humor or interest: here thou will find some weak assistance
offered thee, to clear and disintangle thy doubting thoughts, which through thy
prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, may lead thee to a
comfortable settlement, and inward peace.

If thou be a proud, conceited, presumptuous ^oul, who have too little
knowledge, and too much pride and self-love to admit any doubts or scruples of
thy state toward God; there are many things in this Treatise proper for thy
conviction and better information: for woe to thee, if thou should not fear,
till thou begin to feel thy misery; if thy troubles do not come on, till all
thy hopes are gone off.

I know all these things are performed by me with much infirmity: and that the
whole management is quite below the dignity of the subject. But when I consider
the success of Sermons and Books in the world, has but little relation to the
elegancy of Language or accuracy of method; and that many may be useful, who
cannot be excellent: I am willing in all humility and sincerity to commit it to
the direction of providence, and the blessing of the Spirit.

One thing I shall earnestly request of all the people of God, into whose hands
this shall fall; that now at last, they will be persuaded to end all their
unbrotherly quarrels and strifes among themselves; which have wasted so much
precious time, and decayed the vital spirits of Religion; hindered the
conversion of multitudes, and increased and confirmed the Atheism of the times:
and now at last opened a breach at which the common enemy is ready to enter,
and end the quarrel to our cost. O put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy,
and a spirit of charity and forbearance; if not for your own sakes, yet for the
Churches sake; Si non vis tibi parcere, parce Carthagini.

I remember it is noted in our English History as a very remarkable thing, that
when the Severn overflowed part of Somersetshire, it was observed that Dogs and
Hares, Cats and Rats, to avoid the common destruction, would swim to the next
rising ground, and abide quietly together in that common danger, without the
least discovery of their natural antipathy.

The story applies it self, and O that Christians would every where depose
their animosities; that the hearts of the Fathers might be turned to the
children, and the children to the Fathers; lest God come and smite the earth
with a curse.

O that you would dwell more in your Closets, and be more frequently and
fervently upon your knees. O that you would search your hearts more narrowly,
and sift them more thoroughly than ever; before the day pass as the chaff, and
the Lords fierce anger come upon you: look into your Bibles, then into your
hearts, and then to Heaven for a true discovery of your conditions; and if this
poor mite may contribute any thing to that end, it will be a great reward of
the unworthy labors of

Thy Servant in Christ, John Flavel.

The First SERMON. Sermon. 1.

1 COR. 1. 30. Opening the general nature of Effectual Application.
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us, wisdom, and
righteousness, sanctification and redemption.
HE that enquires what is the just value and worth of Christ, asks a question
which puts all the men on earth, and Angels in heaven to an everlasting
nonplus.

The highest attainment of our knowledge in this life, is to know that himself
and his love do pass knowledge, Ephesians. 3. 91.

But how excellent soever Christ is in himself, what treasures of righteousness
soever lie in his blood, and whatever joy, peace, and ravishing comforts spring
up to men out of his incarnation, humiliation, and exaltation; they all give
down their distinct benefits and comforts to them in the way of Effectual
application.

For never was any wound hea^ed by a prepared, but unapplied plaster. Never
any body warmed by the most costly garment made, but not put on: Never any
heart refreshed and comforted by the richest Cordial compounded, but not
received: nor from the (...) of the world was it ever known, that a poor
deceived, condemned, polluted miserable sinner was actually delivered out of
that woeful state, until of God Christ was made unto him, wisdom and
righteousness, sanctification and redemption.

For look Parisiensis de causis, cur deus homo, cap. 9. Quemadm^dum non transit
Adae damnatio, nisi per generationem in carnaliter ex ^o generatos: Sic non
transit Christi gratia, and peccatorum remissio, nisi perregenerationem ad
spiritualiter per ipsum regeneratos. Sicut de^ictum Ade non nocet, nisi suis,
in eo quod sui sunt: Sic nec gratia Christi prodest, nisi suis, in eo quod sui
sunt.
as the Condemnation of the First Adam passes not to us, except (as by
generation) we are his; so grace and remission pass not from the Second Adam to
us, except as (by regeneration) we are his. Adams Sin hurts none but those that
are in him; and Christ's blood profits none but those that are in him: how great
a weight therefore does there hang upon the effectual application of Christ to
the Souls of men! and what is there in the whole world so awfully solemn, so
greatly important as this is! Such is the strong consolation resulting from it,
that the Apostle in this context offers it to the believing Corinthians, as a
superabundant recompense for the despicable meanness and baseness of their
outward condition in this world, of which he had just before spoken in ver. 27,
28. telling them though the world contemned them as vile, foolish, and weak,
yet of God Christ is made unto them wisdom and righteousness, sanctification
and redemption.

In which words we have an Enumeration of the chief privileges of believers,
and an Account of the method whereby they come to be invested with them.

First, Their privileges are enumerated, namely, wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption, mercies of 1. Quatuor Christo ^logia hic
adscribit, quae totam ejus virtutem, and quicquid ab ipso bonorum recipimus
complectuntur. Calv. in loc.
inestimable value in themselves; and such as respect a fourfold misery lying
upon sinful man^ viz. Ignorance, guilt* pollution, and the whole (...) of
miserable consequences and effects let in upon the nature of men, yea the best
and holiest of men by sin.

Lapsed man is not only in deep misery, but grossly ignorant both that he is
so, and how to recover himself from it: Sin has left him at once senseless of
his state, and at a perfect loss about the true remedy.

To cure this, Christ is made to him Wisdom, not only by improvement of those
treasures of wisdom that are in himself for the benefit of such souls as are
united to him, as an head consulting the good of his own members; but also by
imparting his wisdom to them by the Spirit of illumination, whereby they come
to discern both their sin and danger; as also the true way of their recovery
from both, through the application of Christ to their souls by faith.

But alas! Simple illumination does but increase our burden, and exasperate our
misery; as long as sin in the guilt of it is either imputed to our persons unto
condemnation, or reflected by our consciences in a way of accusation.

With design therefore to remedy and heal this sore evil, Christ is made of God
unto us righteousness, complete and perfect righteousness, whereby our
obligation to punishment is dissolved, and thereby a solid foundation for a
well settled peace of conscience firmly established.

Yea, but although the removing of guilt from our persons and consciences be an
inestimable mercy, yet alone it cannot make us completely happy: for though a
man should never be damned for sin, yet what is it less than an hell upon earth
to be under the dominion and pollution of every base lust? it is misery enough
to be daily defiled by sin, though a man should never be damned for it.

To complete therefore the happiness of the redeemed; Christ is not only made
of God unto them Wisdom, and righteousness, the one curing our ignorance, the
other our guilt; but he is made Sanctification also, to relieve us against the
dominion and pollution of our corruptions: he comes both by water and by blood,
not by blood only, but by water also: 1* Joh. 5. 6. purging as well as
pardoning: how complete and perfect a cure is Christ!

But yet something is required beyond all this to make our happiness perfect
and entire wanting nothing; and that is the removal of those doleful effects
and consequents of sin, which notwithstanding all the forementioned privileges
and mercies still lie upon the souls and bodies of illuminated, justified and
sanctified persons. For even upon the best and holiest of men, what swarms of
vanity, loads of deadness, and fits of unbelief do daily appear in and oppress
their souls! to the imbittering of all the comforts of life to them. And how
many diseases, deformities, pains oppress their bodies, which daily moulders
away by them, till they fall into the grave by death, even as the bodies of
other men do, who never received such privileges from Christ as they do. For
if Christ be in us (as the Apostle speaks Romans 8. 10.) the body is dead because
of sin: Sanctification exempts us not from mortality.

But from all these and whatsoever else the fruits and consequences of sin,
Christ is Redemption to his people also: this seals up the sum of mercies: this
so compleats the happiness of the Saints that it leaves nothing to desire.

These four, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption take up
amongst them all that is necessary or desirable to make a soul truly and
perfectly blessed.

Secondly, we have here the method and way by which the Elect come to be
invested with these excellent privileges: 2.
the account whereof the Apostle gives us in these words [Who of God is made
unto us] in which expression four things are remarkable.

First, That Christ and his benefits go inseparably and undividedly together:
it is Christ himself is made all this unto us: we can have no saving benefit
separate and apart from the person of Christ: many would willingly receive his
privileges, who will not receive his person; but it cannot be; if we will have
one, we must take the other too: yea, we must accept his person first and then
his benefits: as it is in the marriage Covenant, so it is here.

Secondly, That Christ with his benefits must be personally and particularly
applied to us before we can receive any actual saving privilege by him: he
must be [made unto us] (i. e.) particularly applied to us: as a sum of money
becomes or is made the ransom and liberty of a Captive when it is not only
promised but paid down in his name, and legally applied for that use and end:
when Christ dyed, the ransom was prepared, the sum laid down; but yet the
elect continue still in sin and misery notwithstanding, till by effectual
calling it be actually applied to their persons, and then they are made free,
Romans 5. 10, 11. reconciled by Christ's death by whom we have now received the
atonement.

Thirdly, That this application of Christ is the work of God, and not of man:
Of God he is made unto us: the same hand that prepared it, must also apply it,
or else we perish notwithstanding all that the father has done in contriving
and appointing, and all that the son has done in executing and accomplishing
the design thus far. And this actual application is the work of the Spirit by a
singular appropriation.

Fourthly and Lastly, This expression imports the suitableness of Christ to the
necessities of Sinners: What they want, he is made to them: and indeed as money
answers all things, and is convertible into meat, drink, raiment, physic, or
what else our bodily necessities do require; so Christ is virtually and
eminently all that the necessities of our souls require: bread to the hungry
soul, and clothing to the naked soul. In a word, God prepared and furnished
him on purpose to answer all our wants, which fully hits the Apostles sense,
when he says, Who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness,
sanctification and redemption. The sum of all is

Doct. Doct.

That the Lord Jesus Christ with all his precious benefits becomes ours by Gods
special and effectual Application.

There is a twofold Application of our redemption, one Primary, the other
Secondary: the former is the Act of God the Father, applying it to Christ our
Surety, and virtually to us in him; the later is the Act of the holy Spirit,
personally and actually applying it to us in the work of conversion: the former
has the respect and relation of an example, model, or pattern to this, and
this is produced and wrought by the virtue of that. What was done upon the
person of Christ, was not only virtually done upon us, considered in him as a
common public representative person, in which sense we are said to dye with
him and live with him, to be crucified with him and buried with him: but it was
also intended for a platform or Idea of what is to be done by the Spirit
actually upon our souls and bodies in our single persons. As he dyed for sin,
so the Spirit applying his death to us in the work of mortification causes us
to dye to sin, by the virtue of his death: and as he was quickened by the Spirit
and raised unto life, so the Spirit applying unto us the life of Christ causes
us to live, by spiritual vivification. Now this personal, secondary and actual
application of redemption to us by the Spirit in his sanctifying work is that
which I am engaged here to discuss and open: Which I shall do in these
following Propositions.

Propos. 1.
The Application of Christ to us is not only Comprehensive of our
Justification, but of all those works of the Spirit which are known Propos. 1.
to us in Scripture by the names of regeneration, vocation, sanctification and
conversion.

Though all these terms have some small respective differences among
themselves; yet they are all included in this general, the applying, and
putting on of Christ, Romans 13. 14. Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.

Regeneration expresses those supernatural, divine, new qualities infused by
the Spirit into the Soul, which are the principles of all holy actions.

Vocation expresses the terms from which, and to which the soul moves, when
the Spirit works savingly upon it under the Gospel call.

Sanctification notes that holy dedication of heart and life to God: our
becoming the Temples of the living God, separate from all profane, sinful
practices, to the Lords only use and service.

Conversion denotes the great change it self which the Spirit causes upon the
soul, turning it by a sweet irresistible efficacy from the power of Sin and
Satan to God in Christ.

Now all these are imported in, and done by the Application of Christ to our
souls: for when once the efficacy of Christ's death and the virtue of his
resurrection come to take place upon the heart of any man, he cannot but turn
from Sin to God, and become a new creature, living and acting by new principles
and rules. So the Apostle observes 1 These. 1. 5, 6. speaking of the effect of
this work of the Spirit upon that people, Our Gospel (says he) came not to you
in word only, but in power; and in the Holy Ghost: there was the effectual
application of Christ to them. And you became followers of us and of the Lord,
ver. 6. there was their effectual call. And ye turned from dumb Idols to serve
the living and true God, ver. 9. there was their conversion. So that ye were
ensamples to all that believe, ver. 7. there was their life of Sanctification
or dedication to God. So that all these are comprehended in effectual
application.

Propos. 2.
The Application of Christ to the souls of men is that great project Propos. 2.
and design of God in this world, for the accomplishment whereof all the
Ordinances and all the officers of the Gospel are appointed and continued in
the world.

This the Gospel expressly declared to be its direct and great end, and the
great business of all its officers, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12. And he gave some Apostles,
and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some pastors and teachers: till we
all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God; to a
perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, (i. e.)
the great aim and scope of all Christ's Ordinances and officers is to bring men
into Union with Christ, and so build them up to perfection in him: or to unite
them to, and confirm them in Christ: and when it shall have finished this
design, then shall the whole frame of Gospel Ordinances be taken down, and all
its officers disbanded. The Kingdom (i. e. this present economy, manner and
form of Government) shall be delivered up, 1 Cor. 15. 24. what are Ministers,
but the Bridegrooms friends, Ambassadors for God to beseech men to be
reconciled? when therefore all the elect are brought home in a reconciled state
to Christ, when the marriage of the Lamb is come, our work and office expire
together.

Propos. 3.
Such is the Importance and great concernment of the personal application of
Christ to us by the Spirit, that whatsoever the father has Propos. 3.
done in the contrivement, or the Son has done in the accomplishment of our
Redemption, is all inavailable and ineffectual to our Salvation without this.

It is confessedly true, that Gods good pleasure appointing us from eternity to
Salvation, is in its kind a most full and sufficient Impulsive cause of our
Salvation, and every way able (for so much as it is concerned) to produce its
effect. And Christ's humiliation and sufferings are a most complete and
sufficient meritorious cause of our Salvation, to which nothing can be added to
make it more apt and able to procure our Salvation, than it already is: yet
neither the one or other can actually save any Soul without the Spirits
application of Christ to it: for where there are diverse social causes or
concauses necessary to produce one effect; there the effect cannot be produced
until the last cause have wrought: thus it is here, The Father has elected,
and the Son has redeemed; but until the Spirit (who is the last cause) have
wrought his part also, we cannot be saved. For he comes in the Fathers and in
the Sons name and authority to put the last hand to our Salvation work, by
bringing all the fruits of election and redemption home to our souls in this
work of effectual vocation: hence the Apostle 1 Pet. 1. 2. noting the order of
causes in their operations, for the bringing about of our Salvation, thus
states it: Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of
Jesus Christ: here you find Gods election and Christ's blood, the two great
causes of Salvation, and yet neither of these alone, nor both together can save
us; there must be added the Sanctification of the Spirit, by which Gods decree
is executed; and the sprinkling (i. e. the personal application of Christ's
blood) as well as the shedding of it, before we can have the saving benefit of
either of the former causes.

Propos. 4.
The application of Christ with his saving benefits, is exactly of the same
extent and latitude with the Fathers election, and the Sons intention Propos. 4.
in dying, and cannot possibly be extended to one soul farther.

Whom he did predestinate, them he also called, Romans 8. 30. And Acts 13. 48. as
many as were ordained to eternal life, believed; 2 Timothy 1. 9. who has saved
and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works; but according
to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
foundation of the world.

The Father, Son and Spirit (betwixt whom was the council of peace) work out
their design in a perfect harmony and consent: as there was no jarr in their
council, so there can be none in the execution of it: those whom the Father
before all time did choose; they, and they only are the persons whom the Son
when the fullness of time for the execution of that decree was come, dyed for,
John 17. 6. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave me out of
the world; thine they were, and thou gave them me: and ver. 19. for their
sakes I sanctify my self: (i. e.) consecrate, devote, or set my self apart for
a sacrifice for them. And those for whom Christ died, are the persons to whom
the Spirit effectually applys the benefits and purchases of his blood: (...)
comes* in the name of the Father and Son; but the world cannot receive him, for
it neither sees, nor knows him, Joh. 14. 17. they that are not of Christ's
sheep, believe not, Joh. 10. 26.

Christ has indeed a fullness of saving power, but the dispensation thereof is
limited by the Fathers will: therefore he tells us, Matthew. 20. 23. it is not
mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
father: in which words he no way denies his authority to give glory as well as
grace; only shows that in the dispensation proper to him as mediator, he was
limited by his Fathers will and counsel.

And thus also are the dispensations of grace by the Spirit in like manner
limited, both by the counsel and will of the Father and Son. For as he proceeds
from them, so he acts in the administration proper to him, by commission from
both. Joh. 14. 26. The Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name: and as
he comes forth into the world by this joint Commission, so his dispensations
are limited in his Commission: for it is said John 16. 13. he shall not speak of
himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: (i. e.) he shall in
all things act according to his Commission which the Father and I have given
him.

The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do, Joh. 5.
19. And the Spirit can do nothing of himself, but what he hears from the Father
and Son: and it is impossible it should be otherwise, considering not only the
Unity of their Nature, but also of their will and design. So that you see the
applications of Christ and benefits by the Spirit are commensurable with the
Fathers secret counsel, and the Sons design in dying, which are the rule, model
and pattern of the Spirits working.

Propos. 5.
The Application of Christ to Souls by the regenerating work of the Spirit is
that which makes the first internal difference and distinction Propos. 5.
among men.

It is very true, that in respect of Gods foreknowledge and purpose there was
a distinction betwixt one man and another, before any, man had a being, one was
taken, another left: and with respect to the death of Christ, there is a great
difference betwixt one and another: he laid down his life for the sheep, he
prayed for them and not for the world; but all this while as to any relative
change of state, or real change of temper, they are upon a level with the rest
of the miserable world. The Elect themselves are by nature children of wrath
even as others, Ephesians. 2. 3. and to the same purpose the Apostle tells. the
Corinthians 1 Cor. 6. 11. (when he had given in that black bill describing the
most Iewd profligate abominable wretches in the world, men whose practices did
stink in the very nostrils of nature, and were able to make the more sober
Heathens blush; after this he tells the Corinthians) And such were some of you,
but ye are washed, etc. q. d. look, these were your Companions once: as they
are, you lately were.

The work of the Spirit does not only evidence and manifest that difference
which Gods Election has made between man and man, as the Apostle speaks 1
These. 1. 4, 5. but it also makes a twofold difference it self, namely in state
and temper; whereby they visibly differ not only from other men, but also from
themselves: after this work, though a man be the who, yet not the what he was.
This work of the spirit makes us new creatures, namely for quality and temper:
2 Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are
past away, behold all things are become new.

Propos. 6.
The Application of Christ by the work of regeneration is that which yields
unto men all the sensible sweetness and refreshing comforts Propos. 6.
that they have in Christ, and in all that he has done, suffered, or purchased
for sinners.

An unsanctified person may relish the natural sweetness of the creature, as
well as he that is sanctified; he may also seem to relish and taste some
sweetness in the delicious promises and discoveries of the Gospel by a
misapplication of them to himself: but this is like the joy of a beggar
dreaming he is a King; but he awakes and finds himself a beggar still: but for
the rational, solid and genuine delights and comforts of religion, no man tastes
it, till this work of the Spirit have first past upon his soul: it is an
enclosed pleasure, a stranger intermeddles not with it. The white stone and the
new name, (denoting the pleasant results and fruits of Justification and
adoption) no man knows but he that receives it, Revel. 2. 7. there are all
those things wanting in the unsanctified (though Elect) soul that should
capacitate and enable it to relish the sweetness of Christ and Religion,
namely, propriety, evidence, and suitableness of Spirit.

Propriety is the sweetest part of any excellency, therefore Luther was wont to
say, that the sweetness of the Gospel lay mostly in pronouns, as me, my, thy,
etc. who loved [me] and gave himself for me, Gal. 2. 20. Christ Jesus [my]
Lord, Phil. 3. 18. so Matthew. 9. 2. Son be of good che^ [thy] sins are forgiven:
take away propriety and you de^ower the very Gospel of its beauty and
deliciousness: and as propriety, so

Evidence is requisite to joy and comfort, yea, so necessary, that even
interest and propriety afford no sensible sweetness without it. For as to
comfort, it is all one not to appear, and not to be. If I am registered in the
book of life, and know it not; what comfort can my name there afford me?
besides, to capacitate a soul for the sweetness and comfort of Christ, there is
also an agreeable temper of Spirit required; for how can Christ be sweet to
that man's soul, whose thoughts reluctate, decline, or nauseate so holy and pure
an object? Now, all these requisites being the proper effects and fruits of the
Spirits sanctifying operations upon us, it is beyond controversy that the
consolations of Christ cannot be tasted, until the application of Christ be
first made.

Propos. 7.
The Application of Christ to the soul effectually, though it be so far wrought
in the first saving work of the Spirit, as truly to entitle Propos. 7.
the soul to Christ, and save it from the danger of perishing; yet is it a work
gradually advancing in the believers soul, whilst it abides on this side heaven
and glory.

It Is true indeed, that Christ is perfectly and completely applied Nullos
proprie dict^s gradus admittit, sed unico actu simul ac semel existit perfecta,
quamvis quoad manifestationem, sensum, and effecta; varios habet gradus. Ames.
to the soul in the first act for righteousness. Justification being a relative
change properly admits no degrees, but is perfected together and at once, in
one only act; though as to its manifestation and sense it has various degrees:
but the application of Christ to us for wisdom and sanctification is not
perfected in one single act, but rises by many and slow degrees to its just
perfection.

And though we are truly said to be come to Christ when we first believe, Joh.
6. 35. yet the soul after that is still coming to him by farther acts of faith:
1 P^t. 2. 4. to whom [coming] as unto a living stone: the participle notes a
continued motion, by which the soul gains ground, and still gets nearer and
nearer to Christ: growing still more inwardly acquainted with him, the
knowledge of Christ grows upon the soul as the morning light, from its first
spring, to the perfect day: Prove. 4. 18. every grace of the Spirit grows, if
not sensibly, yet really, for it is in discerning the growth of Sanctification,
as it is in discerning the growth of plants; which we perceive rather crevisse,
quam crescere: to have grown, than to grow. And as it thrives in the soul, by
deeper radications of the habits, and more promptitude and spirituality in the
actings; so Christ and the Soul proportionably close more and more inwardly and
efficaciously, till at last it be wholly swallowed up in Christ's full and
perfect enjoyment.

Propos. 8.
Lastly, Although the several privileges and benefits forementioned be all
truly and really bestowed with Christ upon believers, yet Propos. 8.
they are not communicated to them in one and the same way and manner; but
differently and diversely, as their particular and respective natures do require.

These four illustrious benefits are conveyed from Christ to us in three
different ways and methods: his righteousness is made ours by imputation: his
wisdom and sanctification by renovation: his redemption, by our glorification.

I know the Communication of Christ's righteousness to us by imputation, is not
only denied, but * scoffed at by Papists; who own no righteousness, but what is
(at least) confounded Spectrum ^crebri Lutherani. Stapleton.
with that which is inherent in us: and for imputative (blasphemously styled by
them putative) righteousness; they flatly deny it; and look upon it as a most
absurd doctrine, every where endeavoring to load it with these and such like
absurdities. That if God impute Christ's righteousness to the believer, and
accepts what Christ has performed for him; as if he had performed it himself:
then, we may be accounted as righteous as Christ. Then we may be the Redeemers
of the world. False and groundless consequences: as if a man should say, my
debt is paid by my surety, therefore I am as rich as he: when we say the
righteousness of Christ is made ours by imputation, we think not it is made ours
according to its universal value, but according to our particular necessity:
not to make others righteous, but to make us so: not that we have the formal
intrinsecal righteousness of Christin us, as it is in him; but a relative
righteousness, which makes us righteous even as he is righteous, not as to the
quantity but as to the truth of it: 1 John 3. 7.
nor is it imputed to us, as though Christ designed to make us the causes of
Salvation to others, but the Subjects of Salvation Non formali and intrinseca
justitia, sed relativa: non quoad quantitatem, sed veritatem: fit enim finita
applicatio infinitae justitiae; si aliter, eque justi essemus ut Christus, at
non: justitia Christi sit nostra, non quoad universalem valorem, sed
particularem necessitatem; and imputatur nobis, non ^t causis salvationis, sed
ut subjectis salvandis. Bradsh. de Justificat.
our selves; it is inhesively in him, communicatively it becomes ours: by
imputation the sin of the first Adam became ours, and the same way the
righteousness of the second Adam becomes ours: Romans 5. 17. This way the
Redeemer became sin for us, and this way we are made the righteousness of God
in him, 2 Cor. 5. 21. This way Abraham the Father of believers was justified,
therefore this way all believers, the children of Abraham must be justified
also, Romans 4. 22, 23. And thus is Christ's righteousness made ours.

But in conveying and communicating his wisdom and Sanctification he takes
another method, for this is not imputed, but really imparted to us, by the
illuminating, and regenerating work of the Spirit: these are graces really
inherent in us: our righteousness comes from Christ as a Surety, but our
holiness comes from him as a quickening head, sending vital influences into all
his members.

Now these gracious habits being subjected and seated in the souls of poor
imperfect creatures, whose corruptions abide and work in the very same
faculties where grace has its residence, it cannot be, that our Sanctification
should be so perfect and complete, as our Justification is, which inheres only
in Christ. See Gal. 5. 17. thus are righteousness and sanctification
communicated and made ours: but then

For Redemption, that is to say, absolute and plenary deliverance from all the
sad remains, effects and consequents of Sin, both upon soul and body: this is
made ours (or to keep to the terms) Christ is made redemption to us, by
glorification: then and not before are these miserable effects removed: we put
off these together with the body. So that look as Justification cures the guilt
of Sin, and Sanctification the dominion and power of Sin: so glorification
removes together with its existence and being, all those miseries which it let
in (as at a floodgate) upon our whole man. Ephesians. 5. 26, 27.

And thus of God Christ is made unto us wisdom and righteousness,
sauctification, and redemption: namely by imputation, regeneration, and
glorification.

I shall next improve the point in some useful Inferences.

Inference 1.
Learn from hence what a naked, destitute and empty thing a poor sinner is in
his natural and unregenerate state. Infer. 1.


He is one that naturally and inherently has neither wisdom, nor
righteousness, sanctification nor redemption: all Quin dicitur eum factum esse
nobis sapie^tiam, justitiam, sanctitatem and redemptionem, rursus and nostra
dignitas and meritum excluduntur: ex hoc etiam consequitur, ante perceptionem
ejus, nos fuisse slultos, injustos, profanos and diaboli ma^cipia. Muscul.
inloc.
these must come from without himself, even from Christ; who is made all this
to a sinner, or else he must eternally perish.

As no creature (in respect of external abilities) comes under more natural
weakness into the world than man, naked and empty, and more shiftless and
helpless than any other creature; so it is with his soul, yea, much more than
so: all our excellencies are borrowed excellencies, no reason therefore to be
proud of any of them: 1 Cor. 4. 7. What have thou, that thou have not received?
now if thou did receive it, why do thou glory as if thou had not received
it? q. d. what intolerable insolence, and vanity would it be for a man that
wears the rich and costly robe of Christ's righteousness, in which there is not
one thread of his own spinning; but all made by free grace, and not by free
will; to jett proudly up and down the world in it, as if himself had made it;
and he were beholding to none for it? O man! thine excellencies whatever they
are, are borrowed from Christ, they oblige thee to him, but he can be no more
obliged to thee who wearest them, than the Sun is obliged to him that borrows
its light, or the fountain to him that draws its water for his use and benefit.

And it has ever been the care of holy men, when they have viewed their own
gracious principles, or best performances; still to disclaim themselves, and
own free grace as the sole author of all. Thus holy Paul viewing the principles
of divine life in himself, (the richest gift bestowed upon man in this world by
Jesus Christ,) how does he renounce himself, and deny the least part of the
praise and glory as belonging to him, Gal. 2. 20. Now I live, yet not I; but
Christ lives in me: and so for the best duties that ever he performed for God
(and what mere man ever did more for God?) yet when in a just and necessary
defense he was constrained to mention them, 1 Cor. 15. 10. how carefully is the
like [Yet not I] presently added? I labored more abundantly than they all, yet
not I; but the grace of God which was with me.

Well then, let the sense of your own emptiness by nature humble and oblige you
the more to Christ from whom you receive all you have.

Inference 2.
Hence again we are informed, that none can claim benefit by impilted Infer. 2.
righteousness, but those only that live in the power of inherent holiness: to
whomsoever Christ is made righteousness, to him he is also made sanctification.

The Gospel has not the least favor for licentiousness: it is every way as
careful to press men to their duties, as to instruct them in their privileges,
Titus 3. 8. This is a faithful saying; and these things I will that thou affirm
constantly; That they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain
good works: It is a loose principle, divulged by Libertines to the reproach of
Christ and his Gospel, that sanctification is not the evidence of our
justification: and Christ is as much wronged by them who separate holiness from
righteousness (as if a sensual vile life were consistent with a justified
state) as he is in the contrary extreme by those who confound Christ's
righteousness with man's holiness, in the point of Justification: or that own no
other righteousness but what is inherent in themselves: the former opinion
makes him a cloak for sin, the later a needless sacrifice for sin.

It Is true, our Sanctification cannot justify us before God, but what then,
cannot it evidence our Justification before men? is there no necessity or use
for holiness, because it has no hand in our Justification? is the preparation
of the soul for heaven, by altering its frame and temper, nothing? is the
glorifying of our Redeemer by the exercises of grace in this world nothing?
does the work of Christ render the work of the Spirit needless? God forbid: he
came not by blood only, but by water also, 1 John 5. 6. And when the Apostle
says in Romans 4. 5. but unto him that works not, but believes on him that
justifies the ungodly; his faith is counted for righteousness: the scope of it
is neither to characterize and describe the justified person, as one that is
lazy and slothful and has no mind to work, or rebellious and refractory,
refusing obedience to the commands of God; but to represent him as an humbled
sinner, who is convinced of his inability to work out his own righteousness by
the Law, and sees all his endeavors to obey the Law fall short of
righteousness, and therefore is said in a Law sense not to work, because he
does not work so as to answer the purpose and end of the Law, which accepts of
nothing beneath perfect obedience.

And when (in the same Text) the ungodly are said to be Deus just^ impium
antecedenter, non consequenter. Pareus.
justified, that character describes not the temper and frame of their hearts
and lives after their justification, but what it was before, not as it leaves,
but as it found them.

Infer. 3.
How unreasonable and worse than brutish is the sin of infidelity by which the
Sinner rejects Christ, and with him all those mercies Infer. 3.
and benefits which alone can relieve and cure his misery!

He is by nature blind and ignorant, and yet refuses Christ, who comes to him
with heavenly light and wisdom: he is condemned by the terrible sentence of
the Law to eternal wrath, and yet rejects Christ who tenders to him complete
and perfect righteousness: he is wholly polluted and plunged into original and
actual pollutions of nature and practice, yet will have none of Christ, who
would become sanctification to him: he is oppressed in soul and body with the
deplorable effects and miseries sin has brought upon him, and yet is so in
love with his bondage that he will neither accept Christ, nor the redemption he
brings with him to sinners.

Oh what monsters! what beasts has sin turned its subjects into! you will not
come unto me that you may have life, Joh. 5. 40. sin has stabbed the sinner to
the heart, the wounds are all mortal, eternal death is in his face; Christ has
prepared the only plaster that can cure his wounds, but he will not suffer him
to apply it: he acts like one in love with death, and that judges it sweet to
perish. So Christ tells us, Prove. 8. 36. all they that hate me love death: Not
in it self, but in Non quod quisque ita insa^iat, ut sciens and volens diligat
mortem; quam omnes natura exhorrescimus: sed quia ista est fructus spretae
sapientiae Dei, ut mortem tandem afferat. Lavat. in loc.
its causes; with which it is inseparably connected: they are loath to burn, yet
willing to sin; though sin kindle those everlasting flames. So that in two
things the unbeliever shows himself worse than brutish, he cannot think of
damnation the effect of sin, without horror, and yet cannot think of sin the
cause of damnation, without pleasure: he is loath to perish to all eternity
without remedy, and yet refuses and declines Christ as if he were an enemy, who
only can and would deliver him from that eternal perdition.

How do men act therefore as if they were in love with their own ruin? many
poor wretches now in the way to Hell, what an hard shift do they make to cast
themselves away! Christ meets them many times in the Ordinances; where they
studiously shun him: many times checks them in their way by convictions, which
they make an hard shift to overcome, and conquer: oh how willing are they to
accept a cure, a benefit, aremedy for any thing but their Souls! You see then
that Sinners cannot, (should they study all their days to do themselves a
mischief) take a readier course to undo themselves, than by rejecting Christ in
his gracious offers.

Surely the sin of Sodom and Gomorrha is less than this sin, mercy it self is
exasperated by it, and the damnation of such as reject Christ (so prepared for
them, with whatever they need, and so seriously and frequently offered to them
upon the Knee of Gospel entreaty) is just, inevitable, and more intolerable
than any in the world beside them. It is just, for the sinner has but his own
option, or choice: he is but come to the end which he was often told his way
would bring him to. It is inevitable, for there is no other way to Salvation
but that which is rejected: and it will be more intolerable than the Damnation
of others, because neither Heathens nor Devils ever aggravated their sins by
such an horrid! circumstance, as the wilful refusing of such an apt, offered,
and only remedy.

Infer. 4.
What a tremendous Symptom of wrath, and sad Character of Death appears upon
that man's Soul to which no effectual application Infer. 4.
of Christ can be made by the Gospel!

Christ with his benefits is frequently tendered to them in the Gospel, they
have been beseeched once and again upon the Knee of importunity to accept him,
those entreaties and persuasions have been urged by the greatest arguments, The
Command of God, the love of Christ, the inconceiveable happiness or misery
which unavoidably follows the accepting or rejecting of those offers, and yet
nothing will stick: all their pleas for infidelity have been over and over
confuted, their reasons and consciences have stood convinced, they have been
Speechless as well as Christless: not one sound argument is found with them to
defend their infidelity: they confess in general, that such courses as theirs
is, lead to destruction: they will yield them to be happy souls that are in
Christ: and yet when it comes to the point, their own closing with him; nothing
will stick; all arguments, all entreaties return to us without success.

Lord! what is the reason of this unaccountable obstinacy! in other things it
is not so: if they be sick they are so far from rejecting a physician that
offers himself, that they will send and pray, and pay him too: if they be
arrested for debt, and any one will be a surety and, pay their debts for them;
words can hardly express the sense they have of such a kindness: but though
Christ would be both physician and surety, and what ever else their needs
require, they will rather perish to eternity than accept him: what may we fear
to be the reason of this, but because they are not of Christ's sheep, Joh. 10.
26. the Lord open the eyes of poor sinners to apprehend not only* how great a
sin, but how dreadful a sign this is.

Infer. 5.
If Christ with all his benefits be made ours by Gods special application;
Infer. 5.
what a day of mercies then is the day of conversion! What multitudes of choice
blessings visit the converted soul in that day!

This day (says Christ to Zacheus Luke 19. 9.) is Salvation come to this
house: in this day Christ comes into the soul, and he comes not empty; but
brings with him all his treasures of wisdom and righteousness, sanctification
and redemption. Troops of mercies, yea of the best of mercies come with him. It
is a day of singular gladness and joy to the heart of Christ when he is
Espoused to, and received by the believing soul: it is as a Coronation day to a
King. So you read Cant. 3. 11. Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold
King Solomon with the Crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
Espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

Where under the Type of Solomon in his greatest magnificence and glory, when
the royal Diadem was set upon his head, and the people shouted for joy, so that
the earth did ring again; is shadowed out the joy of Christ's heart, when poor
souls by their high estimation of him, and consent to his government, do as it
were Crown him with glory and honor, and make his heart glad.

Now if the day of our Espousals to Christ be the day of the gladness of his
heart, and he reckons himself thus honored, and glorified by us; what a day of
joy and gladness should it be to our hearts, and how should we be transported
with joy to see a King from heaven with all his treasures of grace and glory
bestowing himself freely and everlastingly upon us, as our portion! No wonder
Zacheus came down joyfully Luke 19. 6. That the Eunuch went home rejoicing,
Act. 8. 39. That the Jailer rejoiced, believing in God with all his household,
Act. 16. 34. That they that were converted did eat their meat with gladness,
praising God, Act. 2. 41. 46. That there was great joy among them of Samaria
when Christ came among them in the preaching of the Gospel, Acts 8. 5. 8. I say
it is no wonder, we read of such Joy accompanying Christ into the soul, when we
consider that in one day so many blessings meet together in it, the least of
which is not to be exchanged for all the Kingdoms of this world, and the glory
of them. Eternity it self will but suffice to bless God for the mercies of this
one day.

Infer. 6.
If Christ be made all this to every Soul unto whom he is effectually applied,
what cause then have those souls that are under the Infer. 6.
preparatory work of the spirit, and are come nigh to Christ and all his
benefits; to stretch out their hands with vehement desire to Christ, and give
him the most importunate invitation into their Souls!

The whole world is distinguishable into three classes or sorts of persons,
such as are far from Christ, such as are not far from Christ, and such as are
in Christ: they that are in Christ have heartily received him: such as are far
from Christ will not open to him; their hearts are fast barred by ignorance,
prejudice and unbelief against him; but those that arecome under the
preparatory workings of the spirit nigh to Christ, who see their own
indispensable necessity of him, and his suitableness to their necessities, in
whom also encouraging hopes begin to dawn, and their souls are waiting at the
foot of God for power to receive him, for an heart to close sincerely and
universally with him; oh what vehement desires! what strong pleas! what moving
arguments should such persons urge and plead to win Christ, and get possession
of him! they are in sight of their only remedy: Christ and Salvation are come
to their very doors: there wants but a few things to make them blessed for
ever: this is the day in which their souls are exercised greatly betwixt hopes
and fears: now they are much alone, and deep in thoughtfulness, they weep
andmake supplication for an heart to believe, and that against the great
discouragements with which they encounter.

Reader, if this be the case of thy soul; it will not be the least piece of
service I can do for thee, to suggest such pleas as in this case are proper to
be urged for the attainment of thy desires, and the closing of the match
betwixt Christ and thee.

First, Plead the absolute necessity which now drives thee to Christ: tell him
thy hope is utterly perished in all other refuges: thou art come like a
starving beggar to the last door of hope: tell him thou now beginnest to see
the absolute necessity of Christ: thy body has not so much need of bread,
water, or air, as thy soul has of Christ, and that wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption that are in him.

Secondly, Plead the Fathers gracious design in furnishing and sending him into
the world, and his own design in accepting the Fathers call. Lord Jesus, wast
thou not anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken
hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Isai. 16.
1, 2.
prison to them that are bound? behold an Object suitable to thine Office:
whilst I was ignorant of my condition, I had a proud rebellious heart, but
conviction and self-acquaintance have now meekned it: my heart was harder than
the nether millstone, and it was as easy to dissolve the obdurate rocks into
syrrup, as to thaw and melt my heart for sin; but now God has made my heart
soft, I sensibly feel the misery of my condition. I once thought my self at
perfect liberty, but now I see what I conceited to be perfect liberty, is
perfect bondage; and never did a poor prisoner sigh for deliverance more than
I. Since then thou have given me a soul thus qualified (though still unworthy)
for the exercise of thine office, and execution of thy commission: Lord Jesus,
be according to thy name a Jesus unto me.

Thirdly, Plead the unlimited and general invitations made to such souls as you
are, to come to Christ freely. Lord, thou have made open Proclamation; Ho every
one that thirsts come ye to the waters, Isai. 55. 1. and Revel. 22. 17. him
that is athirst come: in obedience to thy call Lo I come, had I not been
invited, my coming to thee (dear Lord Jesus) had been an act of presumption,
but this makes it an act of duty and obedience.

Fourthly, Plead the unprofitableness of thy blood to God. Lord there is no
profit in my blood, it will turn to no more advantage to thee to destroy than
it will to save me: if thou send me to hell (as the merit of my sin calls upon
thy Justice to do) I shall be there dishonouring thee to all eternity, and the
debt I owe thee never paid: but if thou apply thy Christ to me for
righteousness; satisfaction for all that I have done will be laid down in one
full round sum: indeed if the honor of thy Justice lay as a bar to my pardon,
it would stop my mouth; but when thy Justice as well as mercy shall both
rejoice together, and be glorified and pleased in the same act, what hinders
but that Christ be applied to my soul: since in so doing God can be no loser by
it?

Fifthly, Lastly, Plead thy compliance with the terms of the Gospel: tell him
Lord, my will complys fully and heartily to all thy gracious terms. I can now
subscribe a blank: let God offer his Christ on what terms he will, my heart is
ready to comply. I have no exception against any Article of the Gospel: and now
Lord I wholly refer my self to thy pleasure: do with me what seems good in
thine eyes: only give me an interest in Jesus Christ: as to all other concerns
I lie at thy feet in full resignation of all to thy pleasure. Never yet did any
perish in that posture and frame: and I hope I shall not be made the first
instance and example.

Inference 7. Infer. 7.

Lastly, If Christ with all his benefits, be made ours by special application;
how contented, thankful, comfortable and hopeful should believers be in every
condition which God casts them into in this world!

After such a mercy as this, let them never open their mouths any more to
repine and grudge at the outward inconveniences of their condition in this
world: what are the things you want, compared with the things you enjoy? what
is a little money, health or liberty, to wisdom, righteousness, sanctification
and redemption? all the Crowns and Scepters in the world sold to their full
value, are no price for the least of these mercies: but I will not insist here,
your duty lies much higher than contentment.

Be thankful as well as content in every state: blessed be God (says the
Apostle) the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all
[spiritual blessings] in heavenly places in Christ: O think what are men to
Angels; that Christ should pass by them to become a Savior to men! and what
art thou among men, that thou should be taken, and others left! and among all
the mercies of God, what mercies are comparable to these conferred upon thee? O
bless God in the lowest ebb of outward comforts, for such privileges as these.

And yet you will not come up to your Duty in all this, except you be joyful in
the Lord, and rejoice evermore after the receipt of such mercies as these:
Philip. 4. 4. Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous, and again I say rejoice: for
has not the poor Captive reason to rejoice, when he has recovered his
liberty: the Debtor to rejoice, when all scores are cleared and he owes
nothing: the weary traveller to rejoice, though he be not owner of a shilling,
when he is come almost home where all his wants shall be supplied? Why this is
your case, when Christ once becomes yours: you are the Lords freemen: your
debts to Justice are all satisfied by Christ: and you are within a little of
complete redemption from all the troubles and inconveniences of your present
state.

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The Second SERMON. Sermon. 2.

JOHN 17. 23. Wherein the believers Union with Christ is stated, and opened as
a principal part of Gospel Application.
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.
THE design and end of the Application of Christ to Sinners, is the
Communication of his benefits to them: but seeing all Communications of
benefits necessarily imply Communion, and all Communion as necessarily
presupposes Union with his person: I shall therefore in this place, and from
this Scripture treat of the Mystical Union betwixt Christ and believers: this
Union being the principal act wherein the Spirits application of Christ
consists; of which I spoke (as to its general nature) in the former Sermon.

In this Verse (omitting the Contexture) we find a threefold Union. One betwixt
the Father and Christ, a second betwixt Christ and believers: a third betwixt
believers themselves.

First, Thou in me: this is a glorious ineffable Union, and is fundamental to
the other two: the Father is not only in Christ, in respect of dear affection,
as one friend is in another who is as his own soul: nor only essentially, in
respect of the identity and sameness of nature and attributes; in which respect
Christ is the express Image of his person, Heb. 1. 3. but he is in Christ also
as Mediator, by communicating the fullness of the godhead which dwells in him as
God-man, in a transcendant and singular manner; so as it never dwelt, nor can
dwell in any other, Col. 2. 9.

Secondly, I in them, here is the Mystical Union betwixt Christ and the Saints:
q. d. thou and I are one essentially, they and I are one mystically: thou and I
are one by the communication of the Godhead, and singular fullness of the Spirit
to me as Mediator; and they and I are one, by my communication of the Spirit to
them in measure.

Thirdly, From hence results a third Union betwixt believers themselves: that
they may be made perfect in one: the same Spirit dwelling in them all, and
equally uniting them all to me, as living members to their head of influence,
there must needs be a dear and intimate Union betwixt themselves as fellow
members of the same body.

Now, my business at this time lying in the second branch, namely the Union
betwixt Christ and believers, I shall gather up the substance of it into this
Doctrinal proposition, to which I shall apply this discourse.

Doct.
That there is a strict and dear Union betwixt Christ and all true believers.

The Scriptures have borrowed from the book of Nature four elegant and lively
Metaphors to help the Nature of this Mystical Union with Christ into our
understandings; Namely, that of two pieces of timber, united by glue: that of a
graff taking hold of its stock; and making one tree: that of the husband and
wife, by the marriage Covenant becoming one flesh: and that of the members and
head animated by one soul, and so becoming one Natural body. Every one of these
is more lively and full than the other, and what is defective ^in one, is
supplied in the other; but yet, neither any of these singly, or all of them
jointly, can give us a full and complete account of this Mystery.

Not that of two pieces united by glue, 1 Cor. 6. 17. he that 1 Cor. 6. 17.
is joined to the Lord is one Spirit: (...), glewed to the Lord. For though
this cementeth, and strongly joins them in one; yet this is but a faint and
imperfect shadow of our Union with Christ: for though this Union by glue be
intimate, yet it is not vital; but so is that of the soul with Christ.

Nor that of the graff and stock mentioned Romans 6. 5. for Romans 6. 5.
thought it be there said that believers are (...), implanted, or ingraffed by
way of incision, and this Union betwixt it and the stock be vital; for it
partakes of the vital sap and juice of it; yet here also is a remarkable
defect, for the graff is of a more excellent kind and nature than the stock,
and upon that account the tree receives its denomination from it, as from the
more noble and excellent part; but Christ into whom believers are ingraffed, is
infinitely more excellent than they, and they are denominated from him.

Nor yet that Conjugal Union by marriage Covenant betwixt Ephesians. 6. 32.
a man and his wife; for though this be exceeding dear and intimate, so that a
man leaves father and mother, and cleaves to his wife, and they two become one
flesh: yet this Union is not indissolvable, but may and must be broken by
death; and then the relict lives alone without any Communion with, or relation
to the person that was once so dear: but this betwixt Christ and the soul can
never be dissolved by death, it abides to eternity.

Nor Lastly, That of the head and members united by one Ephesians. 4. 15, 16.
vital Spirit and so making one Physical body, mentioned Ephesians. 4. 15, 16. for
though one soul actuates every member, yet it does not knit every member alike
near to the head, but some are nearer, and others removed farther from it; but
here every member is alike nearly united with Christ the head, the weak are as
near to him as the strong.

Two things are necessary to be opened in the doctrinal part of this point.

1. The reality of this Union. 2. The quality

First, For the reality of it, I shall make it appear that there is such a
Union betwixt Christ and believers: it is no Ens rationis, 1.
empty notion, or cunningly devised fable; but a most certain demonstrable
truth, which appears,

First, From the Communion which is betwixt Christ and believers: in this the
Apostle is express, 1 John 1. 3. truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
with his son Jesus Christ: (...). It signifies such fellowship or Copartnership
as persons have by a joint interest in one and the same enjoyment, which is in
common betwixt them. So Heb. 3. 14. we are (...), Ipse venit in sortem nostrae
mortalitatis, ut in fortem nos adduceret suae immortalitatis: clarum autem est,
hic agi de consortibus unctionis; quales sunt omnes fideles qui unctionis
participes fiunt. Rivet.
partakers of Christ, and Psalm. 45. 7. (...) here the Saints are called the
companions, consorts, or fellows of Christ: and that not only in respect of his
assumption of our mortality, and investing us with his immortality; but it has
a special reference and respect to the Unction of the Holy Ghost, or graces of
the Spirit of which believers are partakers with him and through him. Now this
Communion of the Saints with Christ is entirely and necessarily dependant upon
their Union with him, even as much as the branches participation of the sap and
juice, depends upon its Union and coalition with the stock: take away Union,
and there can be no communion, or communications, which is clear from 1 Cor. 3.
22, 23. All is yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods: where you see how
all our participation of Christ's benefits, is built upon our Union with Christ's
person.

Secondly, The reality of the believers Union with Christ is evident from the
Imputation of Christ's righteousness to him for his Justification. That a
believer is justified before God by a righteousness without himself is
undeniable from Romans 3. 24. being justified freely by his grace, through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus: and that Christ's righteousness becomes ours
by Imputation, is as clear from Romans 4. 23, 24. but it can never be imputed to
us, except we be united to him, and become one with him: which is also plainly
asserted in 1 Con. 1. 30. But of him are ye (in Christ Jesus) who of God is
made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, sanctification and redemption: he
communicates his merits unto none but those that are in him: hence all those
vain cavils of the Papists disputing against our Justification by the
righteousness of Christ, and asserting it to be by inherent righteousness, are
solidly answered.

When they demand, how can we be justified by the righteousness of another? can
I be rich with another man's money, or preferred by another honors? Our answer
is, Yes, if that other be my surety or husband: indeed Peter cannot be
justified by the righteousness of Paul: but both may be justified by the
righteousness of Christ imputed to them; they being members jointly knit to one
common head: principal and surety are one in obligation, and construction of
Law: head and members are one body, branch and stock are one tree, and it is no
strange thing to see a graff live by the sap of another stock, when once it is
ingraffed into it.

Thirdly, The Sympathy that is betwixt Christ and believers proves a Union
betwixt them: Christ and the Saints smile and sigh together. St. Paul in Colos.
1. 2, 4. tells us that he did fill up that which is behind, (...) -- the
remainders of the sufferings of Christ in his Flesh: not as if Christ's
sufferings were imperfect, (for by one offering he has perfected for ever them
that are sanctified, Heb. 10. 14.) but in these two Scriptures Christ is
considered in a twofold capacity: he suffered once in Corpore proprio, in his
own person as mediator; these sufferings are complete and full, and in that
sense he suffers no more: he suffers also in Corpore m^tico, in his Church and
members, thus he still suffers in the sufferings of every Saint for his sake:
and though these sufferings in his Mystical body, are not equal to the other,
either pondere and mensura, in their weight and value, nor yet designed ex
officio, for the same use and purpose, to satisfy by their proper merit
offended Justice; nevertheless they are truly reckoned the sufferings of
Christ, because the head suffers when the members do: and without this
supposition, that place, Acts 9. 5. is never to be understood, when Christ the
head in Heaven cries out, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? when the toe was
trod upon on earth: how does Christ sensibly feel our sufferings or we his, if
there be not a Mystical Union betwixt him and us?

Fourthly and Lastly, The way and manner in which the Saints shall be raised at
the last day, proves this Mystical Union betwixt Christ and them: for they are
not to be raised as others, by the naked power of God without them, but by the
virtue of Christ's resurrection as their head, sending forth vital quickening
influences into their dead bodies, which are united to him as well as their
souls. For so we find it, Romans 8. 11. But if the Spirit of him that raised up
Jesus from the dead, dwell in you: he that raised up Christ from the dead shall
also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you: even as it
is in our awakening out of natural sleep, first the animal spirits in the head
begin to rouse and play there, and then the senses and members are loosed
throughout the whole body.

Now it is impossible the Saints should be raised in the last resurrection, by
the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them; if that Spirit did not knit and unite
them to him, as members to their head. So then, by all this it is proved that
there is a real Union of the Saints with Christ.

Next I shall endeavor to open the quality and nature of this Union: and show
you what it is, according to the weak 2.
apprehensions we have of so sublime a Mystery: and this I shall do in a
General account of it. and Particular

First, More generally, it is an intimate conjunction of believers to Christ by
the imparting of his Spirit to them, whereby 1.
they are enabled to believe and live in him.

All divine Spiritual life is originally in the Father, and comes not to us
but by, and through the son; Joh. 5. 26. to him has the Father given to have
an (...) -- a quickening, enlivening power in himself: but the Son communicates
this life which is in him to none but by and through the Spirit, Romans 8. 2. the
Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the Law of sin
and death.

The Spirit must therefore first take hold of us, before we can live in Christ;
and when he does so, then we are enabled to exert that vital act of faith,
whereby we receive Christ: all this lies plain in that one Scripture, Joh. 6.
57. As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that
cateth me (that is by faith applys me) even he shall live by me. So that these
two, namely the Spirit on Christ's part, and Faith his work, on our part, are
the two ligaments by which we are knit to Christ.

So that the Spirits work in uniting or engrassing a soul into Christ is like
the cutting off the graff from its native stock (which he does by his
illuminations and convictions) and closing it with the living stock when it is
thus prepared, and so enabling it (by the infusion of faith) to suck and draw
the vital sap, and thus it becomes one with it. Or as the many members in the
natural body, being all quickened and animated by the same vital Spirit, become
one body with the head which is the principal member: Ephesians. 4. 4. there is one
body, and one Spirit.

More particularly, we shall consider the properties of this 2.
Union, that so we may the better understand the nature of it. And here I shall
open the nature of it both negatively, and affirmatively.

First, Negatively, by removing all false notions and misapprehensions 1.
Negatively.
of it. And we say,

First, The Saints Union with Christ is not a mere mental 1.
Union, only in conceit and notion, but really exists extra mentem, whether we
conceit it or not. I know the atheistical world censures all these things as
fancies, and idle imaginations; but believers know the reality of them. Joh.
14. 20. At that day you shall know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I
in you. This doctrine is not fantastical, but scientifical.

Secondly, The Saints Union with Christ is not a Physical Union, such as is
betwixt the members of a natural body and 2.
the head: our Nature indeed is assumed into Union with the person of Christ,
but it is the singular honor of that blessed and holy flesh of Christ, to be
so united, as to make one person with him: that Union is hypostatical, this
only Mystical.

Thirdly, Nor is it an Essential Union, or Union with the divine nature, so as
our beings are thereby swallowed up and 3.
lost in the divine being.

Some there be indeed that talk at that wild rate, of being Godded into God,
and Christed into Christ: and those unwary expressions of Greg. Naz. (...), and
(...), do but too much countenance those daring Spirits: but oh there is an
infinite distance betwixt us and Christ in respect of nature and excellency
notwithstanding this Union.

Fourthly, The Union I here speak of, is not a foederal Union; or an Union by
Covenant only: such a Union indeed 4.
there is betwixt Christ and believers, but that is consequential to and wholly
dependent upon this.

Fifthly, and Lastly, It is not a mere Moral Union by love and affection: thus
we say, one soul is in two bodies, a friend 5.
is another self: the lover is in the person beloved: such a Union of hearts
and affections there is also betwixt Christ and the Saints, but this is of
another nature: that we call a Moral, this a Mystical Union: that only knits
our affections, but this knits our persons to Christ.

Secondly, Positively, and First, though this Union neither 2. Positively.
makes us one person, or essence with Christ, yet it knits our persons most
intimately and nearly to the person of Christ: 1.
the Church is Christ's body, Coloss. 1. 24. not his Natural, but his Mystical
body: that is to say, his body in a Mystery: because it is to him as his
natural body: the Saints stand to Christ in the same relation that the natural
members of the body stand to the head, and he stands in the same relation to
them, that the head stands in to the natural members: and consequently they
stand related to one another, as the members of a natural body do to each other.

Christ and the Saints are not one as the Oak and the Ivy that clasps it are
one; but as the graff and stock are one: it is not a Union by adhesion, but
incorporation. Husband and Wife are not so near, soul and body are not so near
as Christ and the believing soul are near to each other.

Secondly, The Mystical Union is wholly supernatural: wrought by the alone
power of God. So it is said 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2.
but of him are ye in Christ Jesus: we can no more unite our selves to Christ,
than a branch can incorporate it self into another stock: it is of him (i. e.)
of God, his proper and alone work.

There are only two ligaments or bands of Union betwixt Christ and the Soul,
viz. the Spirit on his part, and Faith on ours: but when we say faith is the
band of Union on our part, the meaning is not, that it is so our own act, as
that it springs naturally from us, or is educed from the power of our own
wills; no, for the Apostle expressly contradicts it, Ephesians. 2. 8. it is not of
your selves, it is the gift of God: but we are the subjects of it, and though
the act on that account be ours, yet the power enabling us to believe is God's.
Ephesians. 1. 19, 20.

Thirdly, the Mystical Union is an immediate Union: Immediate I say, not as
excluding means and instruments, for 3.
several means and many instruments are employed for the effecting of it: but
immediate as excluding degrees of nearness among the members of Christ's
mystical body.

Every member in the Natural body stands not as near to the head as another:
but so do all the mystical members of Christ's body to him; every member, the
smallest, as well as the greatest has an immediate coalition with Christ. 1
Cor. 1. 2. To the Church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
sanctified in Christ Jesus; called to be Saints: with all that in every place
call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs, and ours.

Among the factious in this Church at Corinth, those that said I am of Christ;
as arrogating Christ to themselves; were as much a faction, as those that said
I am of Paul, 1 Cor. 1. 30. to cure this he tells them, he is both theirs and
ours. Such enclosures are against law.

Fourthly, The Saints Mystical Union with Christ is a 4.
fundamental Union: it is fundamental by way of Sustentation: all our fruits of
obedience depend upon it. John 15. 4. As the branch cannot bear fruit except it
abide in the Vine, no more can ye^ except ye abide in me. It Is fundamental to
all our privileges and comfortable claims, 1 Cor. 3. ult. all is yours for ye
are Christ's. And it is fundamental to all our hopes, and expectations of glory;
for it is Christ in you the hope of glory, Col. 1. 27. So then destroy this
Union, and with it you destroy all our fruits, privileges and eternal hopes at
one stroke.

Fifthly, The Mystical Union is a most Efficacious Union, for through this
Union the divine power flows into our 5.
souls; both to quicken us with the life of Christ, and to conserve and secure
that life in us after it is so infused.

Without the Unition of the soul to Christ, which is to be conceived
efficiently as the Spirits act, there can be no Union formally considered; and
without these, no communications of life from Christ to us. Ephesians. 4. 16. And
when there is that (...) or effectual working of the spirit of life in every
part, which he there speaks of, (as who should say, the first bublings up of
the new life, a spiritual vitality diffused through the soul which ere while
was dead in sin) yet still this Union with Christ is as necessary to the
maintaining, as before it was to the producing of it.

For why is it that this life is not again extinguished and wholly suffocated
in us by so many deadly wounds as are given it by temptations and corruptions?
surely no reason can be assigned more satisfying than that which Christ himself
gives us in John 14. 19. because I live, ye shall live also. q. d. whilst there
is vital sap in me the root, you that are branches in me, cannot wither and dye.

Sixthly, The Mystical Union is an indissoluble Union: there is an everlasting
tie betwixt Christ and the believer: and herein also it is beyond all other
Unions in the world: death dissolves the dear Union betwixt the husband and
wife, friend and friend, yea betwixt soul and body; but not betwixt Christ and
the soul: the bands of this Union rot not in the grave: what shall separate us
from the love of Christ? says the Apostle Romans 8. 35, 38, 39. he bids defiance
to all enemies, and triumphs in the firmness of this Union over all hazards
that seem to threaten it. It is with Christ and us in respect of the Mystical
Union, as it was with Christ himself in respect of the hypostatical Union: that
was not dissolved by his death when the Natural Union betwixt his soul and body
was; nor can this mystical Union of our souls and bodies with Christ be
dissolved when the Unions betwixt us and our dearest relations, yea betwixt the
soul and body are dissolved by death. God* calls himself the God of Abraham,
long after his body was turned into dust.

Seventhly, It is an honorable Union, Apex, cap^t, and vertex ^obilitatis est
Christus, sine quo nibil est i^ toto ho^ sublunari orb terraru^ nobile, cujus
solium est coelum, and cujus scabellu^ est terra; terra ^nquam, in qua h^rum
omnis cognatio and nobilitas sita-est and collocata, divinis illius pedibus
substernitur. Laurent. Hum^redus de no^ilitate lib. 2. p. 176.
yea the highest honor 7.
that can be done unto men: the greatest honor that was ever done to our
common nature, was by its assumption into Unity with the second person
hypostatically, and the highest honor that was ever done to our single persons
was their Union with Christ mystically. To be a servant of Christ is a dignity
transcendent to the highest advancement among men; but to be a member of
Christ, how matchless and singular is the glory thereof! and yet such honor
have all the Saints, Ephesians. 5. 30. we are members of his body, of his flesh, and
of his bones.

Eighthly, It is a most Comfortable Union: yea, the ground 8.
of all solid comfort both in life and death: whatever troubles, wants, or
distresses befall such, in this is abundant relief and support. Christ is mine,
and I am his; what may not a soul make out of that! If I am Christ's, then let
him take care for me, and indeed in so doing, he does but care for his own: he
is my head, and to him it belongs to consult the safety and welfare of his own
members: Ephesians. 1. 22, 23. he is not only an head to his own by way of Influence,
but to all things else by way of dominion, for their good: how comfortably may
we repose our selves under that cheering consideration upon him at all times,
and in all difficult cases!

Ninthly, It is a fruitful Union: the immediate end of it is 9.
fruit: Romans 7. 4. we are married to Christ, that we should bring forth fruit
to God: all the fruit we bear before our ingrafture into Christ, is worse than
none: till the person be in Christ, the work cannot be Evangelically good, and
acceptable to God: we are made accepted in the beloved, Ephesians. 1. 6. Christ is a
fruitful root, and makes all the branches that live in him so too, Joh. 15. 8.

Tenthly and Lastly, It is an enriching Union: for by our 10.
Union with his person we are immediately interessed in all his riches, 1 Cor.
1. 30. how rich and great a person do the little arms of Faith clasp and
embrace! All is yours, 1 Cor. 3. 22. all that Christ has, becomes ours, either
by communication to us, or improvement for us: his Father, Joh. 20. 17. his
promises, 2 Cor. 1. 20. his providence, Romans 8. 28. his glory, Joh. 17. 24.
it is all ours by virtue of our Union with him.

Thus you see briefly what the Mystical Union is. Next we shall improve it.

Inference 1.
If there be such a Union betwixt Christ and believers, oh then what
transcendent dignity has God put upon believers! Infer. 1. Si vis vir virtutis
appellari, indue te Christum, qui est Dei virtus and sapientia; and in omnibus
adjung^ te domino, ita ut (...) c^ ^o spiritus fias, and tunc vir virtutis
essicieris. Orig. Hom. in Numb. 31.


Well might Constantine perfer the honor of being a member of the Church
before that of being head of the Empire: for it is not only above all earthly
dignities and honors; but in some respect above that honor which God has put
upon the Angels of glory.

Great is the dignity of the Angelical nature, they are the highest and most
honorable species of creatures: they also have the honor continually to
behold the face of God in Heaven, and yet in this one respect the Saints are
preferred to them, they have a Mystical Union with Christ as their head of
influence, by whom they are quickened with spiritual life, which the Angels have
not.

It is true, there is an (...) or gathering together of all in heaven and earth
under Christ as a common head: Ephesians. 1. 10.
he is the head of Angels, as well as Saints; but in different respects: to
Angels he is an head of dominion and government, but to Saints he is both an
head of dominion and vital influence too: they are his chief and most
honorable subjects, but not his Mystical members: they are as the Barons and
Nobels in his Kingdom, but the Saints as the dear Spouse and wife of his
bosom: this dignifies the believer above the greatest Angel. And as the Nobles
of the Kingdom think it a preferment and honor to serve the Queen, so the
glorious Angels think it no degradation or dishonor to them to serve the
Saints: for to this honorable office they are appointed, Heb. 1. 14. to be
ministering or serviceable spirits for the good of them that shall be heirs of
salvation: the chiefest servant disdains not to honor and serve the heir.

Some imperious Grandees would frown, should some of these persons but presume
to approach their presence, but God sets them before his face with delight, and
Angels delight to serve them.

Infer. 2.
If there be such a strict and inseparable Union betwixt Christ Infer. 2.
and believers, then the graces of believers can never totally fail:
immortality is the privilege of grace, because sanctified persons are
inseparably united to Christ the fountain of life: your life is bid with Christ
in God, Coloss. 3. 3. Whilst the sap of life is in the root, the branches live
by it: thus it is betwixt Christ and believers, Joh. 14. 19. because I live, ye
shall live also: see how Christ binds up their life in one bundle with his own,
plainly intimating it is as impossible for them to dye, as it is for himself,
he cannot live without them.

True it is, the spiritual life of believers is encountered by many strong and
fierce oppositions: it is also brought to a low ebb in some, but we are always
to remember there are some things which pertain to the essence of that life, in
which the very being of it lies, and some things that pertain only to its
well-being: all those things which belong to the well-being of the new
creature, as manifestations, joys, spiritual comforts, etc. may for a time
fail, yea and grace it self may suffer great losses and remissions in its
degrees notwithstanding our Union with Christ; but still the essence of it is
immortal, which is no small relief to gracious souls: when the means of grace
fail, as is threatened Amos 8. 11. whem temporary formal professors drop away
from Christ like withered leaves from the trees in a windy day, 2 Timothy 2. 18.
and when the natural Union of their souls and bodies are suffering a
dissolution from each other by death, when that Silver cord is loosed, this
Golden chain holds firm: 1 Cor. 3. 23.

Infer. 3.
Is the Union so intimate betwixt Christ and believers? how great Infer. 3.
and powerful a motive then is this, to make us open-handed and liberal in
relieving the necessities and wants of every gracious person! for in relieving
them we relieve Christ himself.

Christ personal is not the object of our pity and charity, Qui respectu
fratris in Ecclesia non movetur, vel Christi contemplatione moveatur; and qui
non cogitat in labor and egestate conservum, vel dominum cogitet in ipso illo
quem despicit, constitutum. Cyprian. de opere and eleemosynis.
he is at the fountain head of all the riches in glory; Ephesians. 4. v. 10. but
Christ mystical is exposed to necessities and wants, he feels hunger and
thirst, cold and pains in his body the Church: and he is refreshed, relieved
and comforted in their refreshments and comforts: Christ the Lord of heaven and
earth in this consideration is sometimes in need of a penny; he tells us his
wants and poverty, and how he is relieved, Mat. 25. 35, 40. A Text believed and
understood by very few, I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat. I was thirsty,
and ye gave me drink. I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Then shall the
righteous answer, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, etc. And the King shall
answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it
unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me.

It was the saying of a great Divine, that he thought scarce any man on earth
did fully understand and believe this truth, and he conceives so much hinted in
the very Text where the righteous themselves reply, Lord when saw we thee sick,
etc. intimating in the question, that they did not thoroughly understand the
nearness, yea, oneness of those persons with Christ, for whom they did these
things. And indeed, it is incredible that a Christian can be hard hearted, and
close handed, to that necessitous Christian, in refreshing and relieving of
whom he verily believes that he ministers refreshment to Christ himself.

O think again and again upon this Scripture, consider what forcible and mighty
Arguments are here laid together to engage relief to the wants of Christians.

Here you see their near relation to Christ: they are Mystically one person:
what you did to them, you did to me. Here you see also how kindly Christ takes
it at our hands: acknowledging all those kindnesses that were bestowed upon
him, even to a bit of bread: he is you see content to take it as a courtesy,
who might demand it by authority, and bereave you of all immediately upon
refusal.

Yea, here you see this one single branch or act of obedience, (our charity to
the Saints) is singled out from among all the duties of obedience, and made the
test and evidence of our sincerity in that great day, and men blessed or cursed
according to the love they have manifested this way to the Saints.

O then henceforth let none that understand the relation the Saints have to
Christ, as the members to the head, or the relation they have to each other
thereby as fellow members of the same body, from henceforth suffer Christ to
hunger, if they have bread to relieve him, or Christ to be thirsty, if they
have to refresh him; this Union betwixt Christ and the Saints affords an
Argument beyond all other arguments in the world to prevail with us: methinks a
little Rhetoric might persuade a Christian to part with any thing he has to
Christ, who parted with the glory of heaven, yea, and his heart blood to boot
for his sake.

Inference 4.
Do Christ and believers make but one Mystical person? how unnatural Infer. 4.
and absurd then are all those acts of unkindness whereby believers wound and
grieve Jesus Christ! this is as if the hand should wound its own head, from
which it receives life, sense, motion, and strength.

When Satan smites Christ by a wicked man, he then wounds him with the hand of
an enemy; but when his temptations prevail upon the Saints to sin, he wounds
him as it were* with his own hand: as the Eagle and Tree in the Fable
complained, the one that he was wounded by an Arrow winged with his own
Feathers, the other, that it was rived asunder by a wedge hewn out of its own
limbs.

Now the evil and disingenuity of such sins, is to be measured not only by the
near relation Christ sustains to believers as their head, but more
particularly, from the several benefits they receive from him as such: for in
wounding Christ by their sins,

First, They wound their head of influence, through whom they live, and without
whom they had still remained in the state of sin and death. Ephesians. 4. 16. Shall
Christ send life to us, and we return that which is as death to him? O how
absurd, how disingenuous is this!

Secondly, They wound their head of government. Christ is a guiding as well as
a quickening head, Col. 1. 18. the is your wisdom, he guides you by his
counsels to glory; but must he be thus requited for all his faithful conduct!
what do you when you sin against him, but rebel against his government,
refusing to sollow his counsels, and obeying in the mean time a deceiver rather
than him.

Thirdly, They wound their consulting head who cares, provides, and projects
for the welfare and safety of the body. Christians, you know your affairs below
have not been steered and managed by your own wisdom, but that orders have
been given from heaven for your security and supply from day to day. I know O
Lord (says the Prophet) that the way of man is not in himself, neither is it
in him that walks to direct his own steps. Jer. 10. 23.

It Is true, Christ is out of your sight, and you see him not; but he sees you,
and orders every thing that concerns you. And is this a due requital of all
that care he has taken for you? Do ye thus requite the Lord, for all his
benefits? what! recompense evil for good! O let shame cover you.

Fourthly and Lastly, They wound their head of honor. Christ your head, is the
fountain of honor to you: this is your glory that you relate to him as your
head: you are on this account (as before was noted) exalted above Angels.

Now then consider how vile a thing it is to reflect the least dishonor upon
him from whom you derive all your glory. O consider and bewail it.

Infer. 5.
Is there so strict and intimate a relation and Union betwixt Christ and the
Saints? then surely they can never want what is good for Infer. 5. Qui misit
filium, immisit spiritum, promisit vultum, quid tandem denegabit?
their souls or bodies.

Every one naturally cares and provides for his own, especially for his own
body; yet we can more easily violate the law of nature and be cruel to our own
flesh, than Christ can be so to his Mystical body. I know it is hard to rest
upon and rejoice in a promise, when necessities pinch, and we see not from
whence relief should arise: but oh what sweet satisfaction and comfort might a
necessitous believer find in these considerations, would he but keep them upon
his heart in such a day of straits!

First, Whatever my distresses are for quality, number, or degree, they are all
known even to the least circumstance by Christ my head: he looks down from
heaven upon all my afflictions, and understands them more fully than I that
feel them. Psalm. 38. 9. Lord all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is
not hid from thee.

Secondly, He not only knows them, but feels them, as well as knows them: we
have not an high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, Heb. 4. 15. in all your afflictions he is afflicted: tender
Sympathy cannot but flow from such intimate Union: therefore in Matthew. 25. 35.
he says, I was an hungered, and I was a thirst, and I was naked. For indeed his
Sympathy and tender compassion gave him as quick a resentment, and as tender a
sense of their wants, as if they had been his own: yea,

Thirdly, He not only knows and feels my wants, but has enough in his hand,
and much (...) enough to supply them all: for all things are delivered to him
by the Father, Luk: 10. 22. all the storehouses in heaven and earth are his,
Phil. 4. 19.

Fourthly, He bestows all earthly good things even to superfluity and
redundance upon his enemies, they have more than heart can wish, Psalm. 73. 7.
he is bountiful to strangers: he loads his very enemies with these things, and
can it be supposed he will in the mean while starve his own, and neglect those
whom he loves as his own flesh? it cannot be. Moreover

Fifthly, hitherto he has not suffered me to perish in any former straits:
when and where was it that he forsook me? this is not the first plunge of
trouble I have been in: have I not found him a God at a pinch? how often have I
seen him in the Mount of difficulties!

Sixthly, and Lastly, I have his promise and engagement that he will never
leave me nor forsake me, Heb. 13. 5. and Joh. 14. 18. a promise never cracked
since the hour it was first made. If then, the Lord Jesus knows and feels all
my wants, has enough and more than enough to supply them, if he gives even to
redundance unto his enemies, has not hitherto forsaken me, and has promised
he never will: why then is my soul thus disquieted in me? surely there is no
cause it should be so.

Infer. 6.
If the Saints are so nearly united to Christ, as the members to Infer. 6.
the head; O then how great a sin, and full of danger is it for any to wrong
and persecute the Saints! For in so doing, they must needs persecute Christ
himself.

Saul, Saul, (says Christ) why persecutest thou me? Acts Agesilaus dic^re
solitus est, se v^hementer admirari, eos non haberi in sacrilegorum numero qui
laederent eos qui Deo supplicarent vel Deum venerantur: quo i^nuit, eos non
tantum Sacrilegos esse qui deos ipsos, aut templorum ornatum spoliarent; sed
eos maxim qui deorum ministros, and praecones contumeliis afficiunt. Aemyl.
Prob.
9. 4. The righteous God holds himself obliged to vindicate oppressed innocence
though it be in the person of a wicked man, how much more when it is in a
member of Christ? He that touches you touches the Apple of mine eye, Zech. 2.
8. And is it to be imagined, that Christ will sit still, and suffer his enemies
to thrust out the very Apples of his eyes? no, no, He has ordained his arrrows
against the persecutors, Psalm. 7. 13.

O it were better thy hand should wither, and thine arm fall from thy shoulder,
than ever it should be lifted up against Christ in the poorest of his members.
Believe it Sirs, not only your violent actions, but your hard speeches are all
set down upon your doomes-days book; and you shall be brought to an account for
them in the great day, Jud. 15. Beware what arrows you shoot, and be sure of
your mark before you shoot them.

Infer. 7.
If there be such a Union betwixt Christ and the Saints as has been described,
upon what comfortable terms then, may believers Infer. 7.
part with their bodies at Death!

Christ your head is above water, therefore you cannot be lost: nay, he is not
only risen from the dead himself, but Templum Dei in quo spiritus inhabitat
patris and membr^ Christi non participare sa^utem, sed in perditionem redigi
dicere: quomodo non maximae est blasphemiae? Iren. lib. 5.
is also become the first fruits of them that sleep, 1 Cor. 15. 20. Believers
are his members, his fullness, he cannot therefore be complete without you: a
part of Christ cannot perish in the grave, much less burn in hell: remember
when you feel the Natural Union dissolving, that this Mystical Union can never
be dissolved: the pangs of death cannot break this tie: as there is a peculiar
excellency in the believers life, so there is a singular support and peculiar
comfort in his death, to me to live is Christ, and to dye is gain, Phil. 1. 21.

Infer. 8.
If there be such a Union betwixt Christ and believers, how does it concern
every man to try and examine his Estate, Infer. 8.
whether he be really united with Christ or not; by the natural and proper
effects which always flow from this Union? As

First, The real Communication of Christ's holiness to the soul: we cannot be
United with this root, and not partake of the vital sap of sanctification from
him: all that are planted into him, are planted into the likeness of his death
and of his resurrection, Romans 6. 5, 6. viz. by mortification, and vivification.

Secondly, They that are so nearly united to him as members to the head cannot
but love him and value him above their own lives: as we see in nature, the hand
and arm will interpose to save the head: the nearer the Union, the stronger
always is the affection.

Thirdly, The members are subject to the head: Dominion in the head must needs
infer subjection in the members, Ephesians. 5. 24. in vain do we claim Union with
Christ as our head, whilst we are governed by our own wills, and our Lusts give
us law.

Fourthly, All that are United to Christ, do bear fruit to God, Romans 7. 4.
fruitfulness is the next end of our Union: there are no barren branches growing
upon this fruitful root.

Infer. 9.
Lastly, how much are believers engaged to walk as the members Infer. 9.
of Christ, in the visible exercises of all those graces and duties which the
consideration of their near relation to him exacts from them! As

First, How contented and well pleased should we be with our outward lot,
however providence has cast it for us in this world. O do not repine, God has
dealt bountifully with you: upon others he has bestowed the good things of
this world, upon you himself in Christ.

Secondly, How humble and lowly in spirit should you be under your great
advancement! It Is true, God has magnified you greatly by this Union; but yet
don't swell, You bear not the root but the root you, Romans 11. 18. You shine,
but it is as the Stars, with a borrowed light.

Thirdly, How Zealous should you be to honor Christ, who has put so much
honor upon you! Be willing to give glory to Christ, though his glory should
rise out of your shame. Never reckon that glory that goes to Christ, to be lost
to you: when you lie at his feet in the most particular heartbreaking
confessions ofsin, yet let this please you, that therein you have given him
glory.

Fourthly, how exact and circumspect should you be in all your ways,
remembering whose you are, and whom you represent! Shall it be said that a
member of Christ was convicted of unrighteous and unholy actions! God forbid:
if we say we have fellowship with him, and walkin darkness we lie, 1 John 1. 6.
and he that says he abides in him, ought also himself to walk even as he
walked, 1 John 2. 6.

Fifthly, how studious should you be of peace among your selves who are all so
nearly united to such a head, and thereby are made fellow members in the same
body! The heathen world was never acquainted with such an Argument as the
Apostle urges for Unity in Ephesians. 4. 3, 4.

Sixthly and Lastly, how joyful and comfortable should you be, to whom Christ
with all his treasures and benefits is effectually applied in this blessed
Union of your souls with him! This brings him into your possession: oh how
great! how glorious a person do the little weak arms of your faith embrace!

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The Third SERMON. Sermon. 3.

2 Cor. 5. 20. Opening the nature and use of of the Gospel Ministry, as an
external means of applying Christ.
Now then, we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you, we
pray you in Christ's stead; be ye reconciled to God.
THe Effectual Application of Christ principally consists in our Union with
him, but (ordinarily) there can be no Union without a Gospel tender and
overture of him to our souls, for how shall they believe in him of whom they
have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? and how shall he
preach except he be sent? Romans 10. 14.

IF God be upon a design of marrying poor sinners to his Son, there must be a
treaty in order to it: that treaty requires interlocution betwixt both the
parties concerned in it: but such is our frailty, that should God speak
immediately to us himself, it would confound and overwhelm us: God therefore
graciously condescends and accommodates himself to our infirmity, in treating
with us in order to our Union with Christ by his Ambassadors, and these not
Angels whose converses we cannot bear, but men like our selves who are
commissionated for the effecting of this great business betwixt Christ and us.
Now then we are Ambassadors for God, etc. In which words you have

First, Christ's Ambassadors commissionated.

Secondly, Their Commission opened.

First, Christ's Ambassadors commissionated. Now then we are Ambassadors for
Christ. The Lord Jesus thought it not sufficient to print the law of grace, and
blessed terms of our Union with him in the scriptures, where men may read his
willingness to receive them, and see the just and gracious terms and conditions
upon which he offers to become theirs; but has also set up and established a
standing office in the Church to expound that Law, inculcate the precepts, and
urge the promises thereof: to woo and espouse souls to Christ, I have espoused
you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ, 2 Cor.
11. 20. and this not simply from their own affections and compassions to
miserable sinners, but also by virtue of their office and Commission whereby
they are authorized and appointed to that work. We then are Ambassadors for
Christ.

Secondly, Their Commission opened: wherein we find

1. Their work appointed. 2. Their Capacity described. 3. And the manner of
their acting in that Capacity prescribed.
First; The work whereunto the Ministers of the Gospel are appointed, is to
reconcile the world to God: to work these sinful, vain, rebellious hearts which
have a strong aversation from God naturally in them; to close with him
according to the Articles of peace contained in the Gospel; that thereby they
may be capable to receive the mercies and benefits purchased by the death of
Christ, which they cannot receive in the state of enmity and alienation.

Secondly, Their Capacity described, they act in Christ's stead as his
Vicegerents. He is no more in this world to treat personally with sinners as
once he did in the days of n^s flesh: but yet he still continues the treaty
with this lower world by his officers, requiring men to look upon them, and
obey them as they would himself if he were Corporally present, Luke 10. 16. He
that hears you, hears me, and he that despises you, despises me.

Thirdly, The manner of their acting in that Capacity prescribed: and that is
by humble, sweet, and condescending entreaties and beseechings: this best suits
that meek and Lamblike Savior whom they represent. Thus he dealt with poor
sinners himself when he conversed among them; he would not break a bruised reed
nor quench smoking flax, Isa. 42. 3. This is the way to allure and win the
souls of sinners to Christ.

From hence the Note is:

Doct.
That the preaching of the Gospel by Christ's Ambassadors is the Doct.
means appointed for the reconciling and bringing home of sinners to Christ.

This is clear from Romans 10. 14. 1 Cor. 1. 21. and many other Scriptures.

Here we shall take into Consideration these three things.

First, what is employed in Christ's treating with sinners by his Ambassadors or
Ministers.

Secondly, What the great Concernment they are to treat with sinners about is.

Thirdly, What and when is the Efficacy of preaching to bring sinners to Christ.

First, We will open what is employed and imported in Christ's treaty with
sinners by his Ambassadors or Ministers.

And here we find these six things implied.

First, it necessarily implies the defection and fall of man from his estate of
favor and friendship with God: if no war with heaven, what need of Ambassadors
of peace? the very office of the Ministry, is an argument of the fall. Gospel
Ordinances and Officers came in upon the fall, and expire with the Mediators
dispensatory Kingdom, 1 Cor. 15. 24, 25. Then shall he deliver up the Kingdom
to God even the Father: thenceforth no more Ordinances, no more Ministers; what
use can there be of them, when the treaty is ended? They have done and
accomplished all they were ever intended and designed for, when they shall have
reconciled to God all the number of his Elect that lay dispersed among the lost
and miserable posterity of Adam, and have brought them home to Christ in a
perfect state, Ephesians. 4. 12. etc.

Secondly, It implies the singular grace and admirable condescension of God to
sinful man. That God will admit any treaty with him at all is wonderful mercy,
it is more than he would do for the Angles that fell, Jude 6. they are reserved
in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Christ took not on him their nature, but suffered Myriads of them to perish,
and fills up their vacant places in glory with a number of sinful men and women
to whom the Law a warded the same punishment.

But that God will not only treat but entreat and beseech sinful men to be
reconciled is yet more wonderful. Barely to propound the terms of peace had
been an astonishing mercy, but to woo and beseech stubborn enemies to be at
peace and accept their pardon, Oh how unparalleled as this condescension!

Thirdly, It implies the great dignity and honor of the Inter illos qui regi
regum inserviunt, ^egatisumus: Dei Christique personam gerimus, ^ullus unquam
nos impu^e despicat^ habuit, quin in Deum Chri^umque idem injurius. Bowls
pr^fat ad past. Evang.
Gospel ministry. We are Ambassadors for Christ, Ambassadors represent and
personate the Prince that sends them: and the honors or contempts done to them
reflect upon, and are reckoned to the person of their Master, Luke 10. 16. he
that hears you, hears me; and he that despises you, despises me.

Neither their persons, nor parts are the proper ground and reason of our
respects to them; but their office and Commission from Jesus Christ.

We are fallen into the dreggs of time, wherein a vile contempt is poured not
only upon the persons but the very Office of the Ministry: and I could heartily
wish that Scripture, Mal. 2. 7, 8, 9. were thoroughly considered by us, possibly
it might inform us of the true cause and reason of this sore judgment: but
surely Christ's faithful Ministers deserve a better entertainment than they
ordinarily find in the world: and if we did but seriously bethink our selves,
in whose name they come, and in whose stead they stand, we should receive them
as the Galatians did Paul, Gal. 4. 14. as Angels of God, even as Christ Jesus.

Fourthly, Christ's treating with sinners by his Ministers, who are his
Ambassadors, implies the strict obligation they are under to be faithful in
their Ministerial employment. Christ counts upon their faithfulness whom he
puts into the Ministry, 1 Timothy 1. 12. They are accountable to him for all acts
of their office, Heb. 13. 17. If they be silent, they cannot be innocent:
necessity is laid upon them, and woe to them if they preach not the Gospel, 1
Cor. 9. 16.

Yea, necessity is not only laid upon them to preach, but to keep close to
their Commission in preaching the Gospel, 1 These. 2. 3, 4, 5. Our Exhortation
was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile, but as we were allowed of
God to be put in trust with the Gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men,
but God, which tries our hearts: the word is not to be corrupted to please
men, 2 Cor. 2. 17. their business is not to make them their disciples, but
Christ's, not to seek theirs but them, 2 Cor. 12. 14. to keep close to their
instructions, both in the matter, manner, and end of their Ministry. So did
Christ himself the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, yet being sent by God, he
says, Job. 7. 16. my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. And so he
expects and requires that his Ambassadors keep close to the Commission he has
given them; and be (according to their measure) faithful to their trust, as he
was to his. Paul is to deliver to the people, that which he also received from
the Lord, 1 Cor. 11. And Timothy must keep that which was committed to him, 2 Timothy 1. 14.

Fifthly, It implies the removal of the Gospel ministry to be a very great
judgment to the people. The remanding of Ambassadors, presages an ensuing War.
If the reconciling of souls to God be the greatest work, then the removal of
the means and instruments thereof must be the forest Judgment. Some account
the falling of the Salt upon the Table ominous, but surely the falling of them
whom Christ calls the Salt of the earth is so indeed.

What are those once famous and renowned places from whence Christ (as he
threatened) has removed the Candlestick, but magna latrocinia dens of Robbers,
and mountains of prey?

Sixthly and Lastly, It implies both the wisdom and condescension of God to
sinful men in carrying on a treaty of peace with them by such Ambassadors,
negotiating betwixt him and them: without a treaty there would be no
reconciliation; and no method to carry on such a treaty like this: for had the
Lord treated with sinners personally, and immediately, they had been
overwhelmed with such an awful Majesty. The app^ces of God confound the
creature, Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God (says Israel)
neither let me see this great fire any more, that I dye not: yea so terrible
was that sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake, Deuteronomy. 18. 16.
Heb. 12. 21.

Or had he Commissionated Angels for this employment, though they stand not at
such an infinite distance from us as God does, yet such is the excellence of
their glory (being the highest Species and order of creatures) that their
appearances would be more apt to astonish than persuade us: besides they being
creatures of another rank and kind, and not partaking with us either in the
misery of the fall, or benefit of the recovery by Christ, it is not to be
supposed they should speak to us so feelingly, and experimentally, as these his
Ministers do: they can open to you the mysteries of sin, feeling the workings
thereof daily in their own hearts: they can discover to you the conflicts of
the flesh and spirit, as being daily exercised in that warfare; and then being
men of the same mould and temper they can say to you as Elihu did to Job, Chap.
33. 6, 7. Behold, I am according to thy wish, in Gods stead, I also am formed
out of the clay: behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
hand be heavy upon thee.

So that in this appointment much of the Divine wisdom and condescension to
sinners is manifested: we have this treasure in ^arthen vessels, that the
excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us, 2 Cor. 4. 7. Gods glory
and man's advantage are both promoted in this dispensation.

Secondly, Next we are to consider that great Concernment 2.
about which these Ambassadors of Christ are to treat with sinners: and that
(as the Text informs us) is their reconciliation to God.

Now reconciliation with God, is the restoring of men to Reconciliarenihil
aliud est quam amicitiam offensione aliquagravi diremptam resarcire, and sic
inimicos in pristinam concordiam reducere. Daven. in (...) Col. 20.
that former frindship they had with God, which was broken by the fall, and is
still continued by our Enmity and aversation, whilst we continue in our
Natural, and unregenerate Estate. Now this is the greatest and most blessed
design that ever God had in the world: an astonishing and invaluable mercy to
men, as will clearly appear by considering these particulars following.

First, That God should be reconciled after such a dreadful breach as the fall
of man made, is wonderful: No sin, all things considered, was ever like to this
sin: other sins like a single bullet kill particular persons, but this like a
chain-shot cuts off multitudes, multitudes as the sand upon the sea shore which
no man can number.

If all the posterity of Adam in their several generations should do nothing
else but bewail and lament this sin of his whilst this world continues, yet
would it not be enough lamented: for a man so newly Created out of nothing, and
admitted the first moment into the highest order, Crowned a King over the works
of Gods hands, Psalm. 8. 5. a man perfect and upright, without the least
inordinate motion, or sinful inclination: A man whose mind was most clear,
bright and apprehensive of the will of God, whose will was free, and able to
have easily put by the strongest temptation: A man in a paradise of delights,
where nothing was left to desire for advancing the happiness of soul or body: A
man understanding himself to be a public complexive person, carrying not only
his own, but the happiness of the whole world in his hand: so soon, upon so
slight a temptation, to violate the Law of his God, and involve himself and all
his posterity with him in such a gulf of guilt and misery: all which he might
so easily have prevented! O wonderful amazing mercy, that ever God should think
of being reconciled, or have any purposes of peace toward so vile an Apostate
creature as man!

Secondly, That God should be reconciled to men and not to Angels, a more high
and excellent order of creatures, is yet more astonishing: when the Angels fell
they were lost irrecoverably: no hand of mercy was stretched out to save one of
those Myriads of excellent beings, but chains of darkness were immediately
clapped on them, to reserve them to the judgment of the great day, Jude v. 6.

That the milder attribute should be exercised to the inferior, and the
severer attribute to the more excellent Creature, is just matter for eternal
admiration: who would cast away vessels of gold, and save earthen potsherds!
Some indeed undertake to show us the reasons why the wisdom of God made no
provision for the recovery of Angels by a Mediator of reconciliation: partly
from the high degree of the malignity of their sin, who sinned in the light of
heaven, partly because it was decent that the first breach of the Divine Law
should be punished, to secure obedience for the future. And besides, the
Angelical nature was not entirely lost, Myriads of Angels still continuing in
their innocence and glory: whenas all mankind was lost in Adam.

But we must remember still the Law made no distinction, but awarded the same
punishment, and therefore it was mercy alone that made the difference, and
mercy for ever to be admired by men: how astonishing is the grace of God, that
moves in a way of reconciliation to us, out of design to fill up the vacant
places in heaven from which Angels fell, with such poor worms as we are! Angels
excluded, and men received. O stupendous mercy!

Thirdly, That God should be wholly and thoroughly reconciled to men, so that no
fury remains in him against us; according to that Scripture Isai. 27. 4. is
still matter of farther wonder.

The design he sends his Ambassadors to you about is not the allaying, and
mitigating of his wrath, (which yet would be matter of great joy to the damned)
but thoroughly to quench all his wrath, so that no degree thereof shall ever be
felt by you. O blessed Embassy! Beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of
them that bring such tidings. God offers you a full reconciliation, a plenary
remission.

Fourthly, That God should be freely reconciled to sinners and discharge them
without any the least satisfaction to his justice from them; is and for ever
will be mavelous in their eyes.

Oh what mercy would the damned account it if after a thousand years torments
in hell God would at last be reconciled to them, and put an end to their
misery! But believers are discharged without bearing any part of the curse, not
one farthing of that debt is levied upon them.

If you say, how can this be, when God stands upon full Object.
satisfaction to his Justice before any soul be discharged, and restored to
savor? freely reconciled, and yet fully satisfied, how can this be?

Very well, for this mercy comes freely to your hands, how Solut.
costly soever it proved to Christ: and that free remission, and full
satisfaction are not contradictory and inconsistent things, is plain enough
from that Scripture, Romans 3. 24. Being justified freely by his grace, through
the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: freely and yet in the way of redemption.

For though Christ your surety have made satisfaction in your name and stead,
yet it was his life, his blood, and not yours, that went for it, and this
surety was of Gods own appointment and providing without your contrivement or
thoughts. O blessed reconciliation, happy is the people that hear the joyful
sound of it.

Fifthly, and Lastly, That God should be finally reconciled to sinners, so that
never any new breach shall happen betwixt him and them any more, so as to
dissolve the League of friendship; is a most ravishing and transporting message.

Two things give Confirmation and full security to reconciled ones, viz. The
terms of the Covenant, and the intercession of the Mediator.

The Covenant of grace gives great security to believers against new breaches
betwixt God and them. It Is said Jer. 32. 40. And I will make an everlasting
Covenant with them that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I
will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me. The fear
of God is a choice preservative against second revolts, and therefore taken
into the Covenant. It is no hindrance, but a special guard to assurance.

There is no doubt of Gods faithfulness, that part of the promise is easily
believed, that he will not turn away from us to do us good, all the doubt is of
the inconstancy of our hearts with God, and against that danger this promise
makes provision.

Moreover the Intercession of Christ in heaven secures the Saints in their
reconciled state. 1 John 2. 1, 2. If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the
Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation: he continually
appears in heaven before the Father, as a Lamb that had been slain, Rev. 5. 6.
And as the bow in the clouds, Rev. 4. 3. So that as long as Christ thus appears
in the presence of God for us, it is not possible our state of Justification
and reconciliation can be again dissolved.

And this is that blessed Embassy Gospel Ministers are employed about: he has
committed to them the word of this reconciliation.

In the last place we are to enquire what and whence is this efficacy of
preaching, to reconcile and bring home sinners to 3.
Christ.

That its efficacy is great in convincing, humbling, and changing the hearts of
men is past all debate and question. The weapons of our warfare (says the
Apostle) are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong
holds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts it self
against the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. No heart so hard, no conscience so
stupid, but this sword can pierce and wound: in an instant it can cast down all
those vain reasonings, and fond imaginations which the Carnal heart has been
building all its life long, and open a fair passage for Convictions of sin, and
the fears and terrors of wrath to come into that heart that was never afraid of
these things before. So Acts 2. 37. When they heard this they were pricked to
the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren,
what shall we do?

What shall we do? is the doleful cry of men at their wits end: the voice of
one in deepest distress, and such outcries have been no rarities under the
preaching of the word: its power has been felt by persons of all orders and
conditions: the great and honorable of the earth, as well as the poor and
despicable. The learned and the ignorant, the civil and profane, the young and
the old, all have felt the heart-piercing efficacy of the Gospel.

If you ask whence has the word preached this mighty power? The answer must
be, Neither from it self, nor him that preaches it, but from the spirit of God
whose instrument it is, by whose blessing and concurrence with it, it produces
its blessed effects upon the hearts of men.

First, This Efficacy and wonderful power is not from the 1.
word it self: take it in an abstract notion, separated from the spirit, it can
do nothing: it is called the foolishness of preaching, 1 Cor. 1. 21.
foolishness not only because the world so accounts it, but because in it self
it is a weak and unsuitable, and therefore a very improbable way to reconcile
the world to God: that the stony heart of one man should be broken by the words
of another man, that one poor sinful Creature should be used to breath
spiritual life into another, this could never be if this sword were not managed
by an omnipotent hand.

And besides, we know what works Naturally, works necessarily: if this Efficacy
were inherent in the word, so that we should suppose it to work as other
Natural agents do, then it must need convert all to whom it is at any time
preached, except its effect were miraculously hindered, as the fire when it
could not burn the three Children: but alas thousands hear it, that never feel
the saving power of it, Isai. 53. 1. and 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.

Secondly, It derives not this Efficacy* from the Instrument 2.
by which it is ministered: let their gifts and abilities be what they will,
it is impossible that ever such effects should be produced from the strength of
their Natural or gracious abilities: 2 Cor. 4. 7. We have this treasure (says
the Apostle) in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of
God, and not of us.

This treasure of Gospel light is carried (...) in earthen vessels, as Gideon
and his men had their Lamps (...)
in earthen pitchers or in Oyster-shells, for so the word also signifies, the
Oyster-shell is a base and worthless thing in it self, however, there lies the
rich and precious Pearl of so great value: and why is this precious treasure
lodged in such weak worthless vessels? surely it is upon no other design but to
convince us of the truth I am here to prove, That the Excellency of the power
is of God, and not of us: as it follows in the next words. To the same purpose
speaks the same Apostle, 1 Cor. 3. 7. So then neither is he that planteth any
thing, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.

Not any thing! what can be more diminutively spoken of the Gospel preachers?
but we must not understand these words in a simple and absolute, but in a
comparative and relative sense: not as if they were not necessary and useful in
their place, but that how necessary soever they be, and what excellent gifts
soever God has furnished them with; yet it is neither in their power, nor
choice to make the word they preach effectual to men: if it were, then the
damnation of all that hear us must needs lie at our door: then also, many
thousands would have been reconciled to God, which are yet in the state of
enmity, but the effect of the Gospel is not in our power.

Thirdly, But whatever efficacy it has to reconcile men to God, it derives
from the spirit of God, whose Cooperation 3.
and blessing (which is arbitrarily dispensed) gives it all the fruit it has.

Ministers, says one Mr. Anthony Burges.
, are like Trumpets which make no sound, if breath be not breathed into them.
Or like Ezekiels wheels, which move not, unless the spirit move them: or like
Elisha's servant, whose presence does no good except Elisha's spirit be there
also: for want of the spirit of God, how many thousands of souls do find the
Ministry to be nothing to them? If it be something to the purpose to any soul,
it is the Lord that makes it so. This spirit is not limited by men's gifts or
parts: he concurrs not only with their labors who have excellent gifts, but
ostentimes blesses mean despicable gifts, with far greater success: beautiful
Rachel is barren, and blear-eyed Leah bears children. Ex duobus aetate jam
grandibus impiis; cur iste ita vocetu^ ut vocantem sequatur, ille autem non?
nolito judicare, si non vis errare: inscrutabilia sunt judica dei: cujus vult
mis^retur. Aug. de bono persec. Cap. 8.


Suppose, says Austin, there be two Conduits in a Town, one very plain and
homely, the other built of polished marble, and adorned with excellent Images,
as Eagles, Lions, Angels: the water refreshes as it is water, and not as it
comes from such or such a Conduit. It Is the spirit that gives the word all that
virtue it has: he is the Lord of all saving influences: he has dominion over
the word, over our souls, over the times and seasons of conversion: and if any
poor Creature attend the Ministry without benefit, if he go away as he came,
without fruit; surely we may say in this case as Martha said to Christ in
reference to her brother Lazarus, Lord, if thou had been here, my brother had
not died; so, Lord if thou had been in this prayer, in this Sermon, this poor
soul had not gone dead, and carnal from under it. And now what remains, but
that we apply this truth in those uses that it gives us?

First Use of Information.
Infer. 1.

Is the Preaching of the Gospel by Christ's Ambassadors the way which God takes
to reconcile sinners to himself? Then how inexcusable are all those that
continue in their state of enmity, though the Ambassadors of peace have been
with them all their lives long, wooing and beseeching them to be reconciled to
God?

O invincible, obstinate, incurable disease, which is aggravated by the only
proper remedy! has God been wooing and beseeching you by his Ambassadors so
many years to be reconciled to him, and will you not yield to any entreaties?
must he be made to speak in vain, to charm the deaf Adder? well, when the
milder Attributre has done with you, the seveer Attribute will take you in
hand.

The Lord has kept an account of every year and day of his patience toward
you, Luke 13. 7. These three years I came seeking fruit on this Fig Tree, and
find none, and Jer. 25. 3. These three and twenty years have I spoken unto you
rising early and speaking, but ye have not hearkened.

Well, be you assured, that God has both the glass of your time, and the vials
of his wrath by him: and so much of his abused patience as runs out of one, so
much of his incensed wrath runs into the other: there is a time when this
Treaty of peace will end, when the Master of the house will rise up, and the
doors be shut, Luke 13. 25. Then will you be left without hope and without
Apology.

We read indeed of some poor and ineffectual pleas that will be made by some at
the last day, so Matthew. 7. 22. We have Prophesied in thy name, etc. These pleas
will not avail, but as for you what will you plead? possibly many thousand
Idiots or poor weak-headed persons may perish, many young ones that had little
or no time in the world to acquaint themselves with matters of religion, or
understand the way of salvation: many Millions of heathens, that never heard
the name of Christ, nor came within the sound of Salvation; who will yet perish
and that justly.

Now whatsoever Apologies any of these will make for themselves in the last
day, to be sure you can make none. God has given you a Capacity, and competent
understanding: many of you are wise and subtle in all your other concernments,
and only show your folly in the great concernments of your Salvation: you
cannot plead want of time, some of you are grown gray headed under the Gospel:
you cannot plead want of means and opportunities, the Ordinances and Ministers
of Christ have been with you all your life long to this day: sure if you be
Christless now, you must also be speechless then.

Infer. 2.
Hence it also follows, That the world owes better entertainment Infer. 2.
than it gives to the Ministers of Christ. Christ's Ambassadors deserve a better
welcome than they find among men.

Your respects to them is founded upon their office and employment for you,
Heb. 13. 17. and 1 These. 5. 12. They watch for your souls, dare any of you
watch for their ruin? They bring glad tidings, shall they return with sad
tidings to him that sent them? They publish peace, shall they be rewarded with
trouble? O ungrateful world! We read in Ephesians. 6. 20. of an Ambassador in bonds,
and he no ordinary one neither; we read also a strange Challenge made by
another at his own death, Acts 7. 52. Which of all the prophets have not your
fathers persecuted? And they have slain them which showed before the coming of
the Just one. Some that break the bread of life to you might want bread to eat
for any regard you have to them. The office of the Ministry speaks the abundant
love of God to you, your Contempt and abuse of it speaks the abundant stupidity
or malignity of your hearts toward God: what a sad protestation does Jeremy
make against his ungrateful people, Jer. 18. 20. shall evil, says he, be
recompensed for good? for they have dug a pit for my soul; remember that I
stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.

Gods mercy is eminently discovered in the institution, and Satan's malice is
eminently discovered in the opposition of the Ministerial office. Satan is a
great and jealous Prince, and it is no wonder he should raise all the forces he
can to oppose Mr. G^rnals Christian Armor.
the Ambassadors of Christ: When, says one, the Gospel comes into his
dominions, it does as it were by sound of Trumpet and beat of drum proclaim
liberty to all his slaves and vassals if they will quit that Tyrant that has
so long held their souls in bondage, and come under the sweet and easy
government of Christ: and can the Devil endure this, think you? if Christ send
forth Ambassadors, no wonder if Satan send forth opposers: he certainly owes
them a spite, that undermine his government in the world.

Infer. 3.
Hence it follows, that it nearly concerns all Christ's Ambassadors Infer. 3.
to see that they be in a state of reconciliation with God themselves.

Shall we stand in Christ's stead by office, and yet not be in Christ by Union?
Shall we entreat men to be reconciled to God, and yet be at enmity with him our
selves? O let us take heed lest after we have preached to others, we our selves
be as cast-awayes, 1 Cor. 9. 27. Of all men living we are the most miserable if
we be Christless, and graceless: our Consciences will make more terrible
applications of our doctrine to us in hell, than ever we made to the vilest of
sinners on earth. O it is far easier to study and press a thousand truths upon
others, than to feel the power of one truth upon our own hearts: to teach
others facienda quam faciendo: duties to be done, than duties by doing them.

They are sad Dilamma's with which a learned Writer poses Gildas Salv. p. 15,
16.
such graceless Ministers: If Sin be evil, why do you live in it? If it be not,
why do you dissuade men from it? If it be dangerous, how dare you venture on
it? If it be not, why do you tell men so? If Gods threatenings be true; why
don't you fear them? If they be false, why do you trouble men needlessly with
them, and put them into such frights without a cause?

Take heed to your selves, lest you should cry down sin, and not overcome it;
lest while you seek to bring it down in others, you bow to it and become its
slaves your selves: it is easier to chide at sin, than to overcome i. That is a
smart question, Romans 2. 21. Thou that teach another, teach thou not thy
self? A profane Minister was Converted by reading that Text once, but how many
have read it as well as he, who never trembled at the consideration of it as he
did?

2. Use for Conviction.
Is this the method God uses to reconcile men to himself? O then examine your
selves whether yet the preaching of the 2. Use.
Gospel has reconciled you to God. It Is too manifest that many among us are in
the state of enmity unto this day: we may say with the Prophet Isaiah, 53. 1.
Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We
offer you peace upon Gospel terms and Articles, but our peace returns to us
again: enemies you were to God, and enemies you still continue. The Evidence is
undeniable; for

1. Evidence.
Many of you were never Convinced to this day of your state 1. Evid.
of enmity against God, and without Conviction of this, reconciliation is
impossible; without repentance there can be no reconciliation, and without
Conviction there can be no repentance: when we repent we lay down our Weapons,
Isai. 27. 4, 5. But how few have been brought to this? Alas! if a few poor cold
heartless, ineffectual confessions of sin may pass for a due Conviction, and
serious repentance, then have we been convinced, then have we repented: but you
will find if ever the Lord intend to reconcile you to himself, your Convictions
and humiliations for sin will be other manner of things: this will cost you
more than a few cheap words against sin. 2 Cor. 7. 11. In that ye sorrowed
after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
your selves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire,
yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge?

2. Evidence.
Many of us never treated seriously with the Lord about peace, and how then are
we reconciled to him? What, a 2. Evid.
peace without a treaty? Reconciliation without any consideration about it? it
can never be: When was the time, and where was the place, that you were found
in secret upon your knees, mourning over the sin of your Nature, and the evils
of your ways? Certainly you must be brought to this, you must with a broken
heart bewail your sin and misery.

Friend, that stony heart of thine must feel remorse and anguish for sin, it
will cost thee some sad days and sorrowful nights or ever thou can have peace
with God: it will cost thee many a groan, many a tear, many a hearty cry to
heaven; if ever the peace be made betwixt God and thee, thou must take with
thee words and turn to the Lord, saying, Take away all iniquity, and receive me
graciously. O for one smile, one token of love, one hint of favor! The child
of peace is not born without pangs, and agonies of Soul.

3. Evidence.
Many of us are not reconciled to the duties of religion, and ways of holiness,
and how then is it possible we should 3. Evid.
be reconciled to God? What, reconciled to God, and unreconciled to the ways of
God? By reconciliation we are made nigh: in duties of Communion we draw nigh;
and can we be made nigh to God, and have no heart to draw nigh to God? it can
never be.

Examine your hearts and say, is not the way of strictness a bondage to you?
had you not rather be at liberty to fulfill the desires of the flesh and of
the mind? Could you not wish that the Scriptures had not made some things else
your sins and other things your duties? do you delight in the Law of God after
the inner man, and esteem his Judgments concerning all things to be right? Do
you love secret prayer, and delight in duties of Communion with God; or rather
are they not an ungrateful burden, and irksome imposition? give Conscience
leave to speak plain.

4. Evidence.
Many of us are not Enemies to sin, and how then are we reconciled to God?
what, friends with God, and our Lusts 4. Eivd.
too? it cannot be. Psalm. 97. 10. Ye that love the Lord hate evil: the same
hour our reconciliation is made with God, there is an everlasting breach made
with sin: this is one of the Articles or Conditions of our peace with God,
Isai. 55. 7. Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts, and let him turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to
our God, and he will abundantly pardon.

But it is manifest in many of us that we are no enemies to sin, we secretly
indulge it, what bad names soever we call it by: we will commit ten sins to
cover one: we cannot endure the most serious faithful, seasonable, private,
tender, and necessary reproofs of Sin, but our hearts swell and rise at it:
sure we are not reconciled to God, whilst we embrace sin his enemy in our
bofoms.

5. Evidence.
We love not the Children of God, nor are reconciled to them that bear his
Image, and how then can we be reconciled 5. Evid.
to God? 1 John 5. 1. He that loves him that begat, loves them also that are
begotten: what, at peace with the father, and at War with the children! It
cannot be: do not some that hope they have made their peace with God, hate,
revile and persecute the Children of God? Surely in that day we are reconciled
to the Lord, we are reconciled to all his people: we shall then love a
Christian as a Christan, and by this we know we are passed from death to life.

6. Evidence.
Lastly, How can any man think himself to be reconciled to God, who never
closed heartily with Jesus Christ by 6. Evid.
faith, who is the only dayes-man, and peacemaker; the alone mediator of
reconciliation betwixt God and man.

This is a sure truth, that all whom God accepts into favor, are made accepted
in the beloved, Ephesians. 1. 6. If any man will make peace with God, he must take
hold of his strength, accept and close with Christ who is the power of God, or
he can never make peace, Isai. 27. He must be made nigh by the blood of Christ,
Ephesians. 2. 13. But alas, both Christ and faith are strangers to many souls who yet
persuade themselves to be at peace with God: O fatal mistake!

3. Use of Exhortation.
Lastly, This point deserves a close vigorous application 3. Use.
in a threefold exhortation.

First, To Christ's Ambassadors who treat with Souls in order to their
reconciliation with God

Secondly, To those that are yet in their enmity and unreconciled state.

Thirdly, to those that have embraced the terms of peace, and submitted to the
Gospel overtures.

First, To the Ambassadors of reconciliation. God has put a 1.
great deal of honor upon you in this high and noble employment: great is the
dignity of your office, to some you are the savor of death unto death, and to
others the savor of life unto life; and who is sufficient for these things? 2
Cor. 2. 16. But yet the Duty is no less than the dignity. O what manner of men
should we be for judgment, seriousness, affections, patience, and exemplary
holiness to whom the management of so great a Concern betwixt God and man is
committed!

First, for Judgment and prudence, how necessary is it in so weighty and
difficult a business as this! He had need be a man of wisdom that is to inform
the ignorant of the nature and necessity of this great work, and win over their
hearts to consent to the Articles of peace propounded in the Gospel: that has
so many subtle temptations to answer, and so many intricate cases of conscience
to resolve: There are many strong holds of Satan to be battered, and many stout
and obstinate resistances made by the hearts of sinners which must be overcome;
and he had need be no Novice in religion to whom so difficult a province is
committed.

Secondly, Let us be Serious in our work as well as judicious. Remember O ye
Ambassadors of Christ, you bring a message from the God of heaven of
everlasting consequence to the souls of men. The eternal decrees are executed
upon them in your Ministry: to some you are the savor of life unto life, and
to some the savor of death unto death, 2 Cor. 2. 16. Heaven and hell are
matters of most awful and solemn Consideration. O what an account have we also
shortly to give unto him that sent us!

These are matters of such deep Concernment as should swallow up our very
spirits, the least they can do is to compose our hearts unto seriousness in the
management of them.

Thirdly, Be filled with tender affections toward the souls Vide Bowls pastor
Evang. p. 136.
of men with whom you treat for reconciliation: you had need be men of bowels
as well as men of brains: you see a multitude of poor souls upon the brink of
eternal misery, and they know it not, but promise themselves peace, and fill
themselves with vain hopes of heaven: and is there a more moving, melting
spectacle in the world than this! O think with what bowels of Commiseration
Moses and Paul were filled, when the one desired rather to be blotted out of
Gods Book, and the other to be accursed from Christ, than that Israel should
not be saved, Exodus 32. 33. and Romans 9. 3. Think how the Bowels of Christ
yearned over Jerusalem, Matthew. 23. 37. and over the multitude, Matthew. 9. 36.
Let the same mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus.

Fourthly, Be patient and long-suffering toward sinners: such is the value of
one soul, that it is worth waiting all our days to save it at last: the servant
of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
in meekness instructing them that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will
give them repentance, 2 Timothy 2. 24, 25. The Lord waits with patience upon
sinners, and well may you. Consider your selves, how long was God treating with
you, ere you were won to him? Be not discouraged if success presently answer
not expectation.

Fifthly, and Lastly, be sure to back your Exhortations with drawing examples,
else you may preach out your last breath before you gain one soul to God. The
Devil and the Carnal hearts of your hearers will put hindrances enough in the
way of your labors, don't you put the greatest of all your selves. O study not
only to preach exactly, but to live exactly, let the misplacing of one action
in your lives trouble you more, than the misplacing of words in your
discourses: this is the way to succeed in your Embassy, and give up your
account with joy.

Secondly, The exhortation speaks to all those that are 2.
yet in a state of enmity and unreconciled to God unto this day. O that may
words might prevail, and that you would now be entreated to be reconciled to
God! The Ambassadors of peace are yet with you, the treaty is not yet ended,
the Master of the house is not yet risen up, nor the door of mercy and hope
finally shut: hitherto God has waited to be gracious, O that the
long-suffering of God might be your salvation: a day is hasting when God will
treat with you no more, when a gulf shall be fixed betwixt him and you for
ever, Luke 13. 25. O what will you do when the season of mercy and all hopes of
mercy shall end together! When God shall become inaccessible, inexorable and
unreconcilable to you for evermore.

O what will thou do when thou shall find thy self shut up under eternal wrath:
when thou shall feel that misery thou art now warned of! is this the place
where I must be, are these the torments I must endure, what for ever! Yea, for
ever: will not God be satisfied with the sufferings of a thousand years? No,
nor of Millions of years! Ah sinners, did you but clearly see the present and
future misery of unreconciled ones, and what that wrath of the great and
terrible God is which is coming as fast as the wings of time can bring it upon
you; it would certainly drive you to Christ, or drive you out of your wits. O
it is a dreadful thing to have God for your eternal enemy: to have the great and
terrible God setting on work his infinite power to avenge the abuse of his
grace and mercy.

Believe it friends, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
God: knowing the terrors of the Lord we persuade men: an eternal weight hangs
upon an inch of time. O that you did know the time of your visitation! That you
would not dare to adventure, and run the hazard of one day more in an
unreconciled state.

Thirdly, and Lastly, This point speaks to those who 3.
have believed our report, who have taken hold of Gods strength, and made peace
with him: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy: who once
were afar off, but now are made nigh by the blood of Christ: with you I would
leave a few words of exhortation, and I have done.

First, Admire and stand amazed at this mercy. I will praise thee O Lord,
(says the Church Isai. 12. 1.) though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is
turned away, and thou comfortest me. O how overwhelming a mercy is here before
you! God is at peace, at peace with you that were enemies in your minds by
wicked works, Colos. 1. 21. at peace with you, and at enmity with Millions as
good by nature as you: at peace with you that sought it not: at peace for ever,
no dissolving this friendship for evermore. O let this Consideration thaw your
hearts before the Lord and make you cry, What am I Lord that mercy should take
in me, and shut out fallen Angels, and millions of men and women as capable of
mercy as my self! O the riches! O the depths of the mercy and goodness of God!

Secondly, Beware of New breaches with God: God will speak peace to his people
and to his Saints, but let not them return any more to folly, Psalm. 85. 8. What
if this state of friendship can never be dissolved, yet it is a dreadful thing
to have it clouded: you may lose the sense of peace, and with it all the joy of
your hearts and comforts of your lives in this world.

Thirdly, Labor to reconcile others to God, Especially those that are endeared
to you by the bonds of Natural relation: When Paul was reconciled to God
himself, his heart was full of heaviness for others that were not reconciled,
for his brethren and kinsinen according to the flesh, Romans 9. 2, 3. When
Abraham was become Gods friend himself, then, O that Ishmael might live before
thee! Genesis 17. 18.

Fourthly and Lastly, let your reconciliation with God relieve you under all
burdens of affliction you shall meet with in your way to heaven: let them that
are at enmity with God droop under Crosses and afflictions, but don't you do
so. Tranquillus deus tranquillat omnia. Romans 5. 1, 2, 3. Let the peace of God
keep your hearts and minds. As nothing can comfort a man that must to Hell at
last, so nothing should deject a man that shall through many troubles win

The Fourth SERMON. Sermon. 4.

Joh. 6. 44. Explaining the work of the Spirit, as the internal and most
effectual means of the Application of Christ.
No man can come unto me, except the Father which has sent me, draw him.
OUR last discourse informed you of the usefulness and influence of the
preaching of the Gospel in order to the Application of Christ to the souls of
men: there must be (in Gods Ordinary way) the external ministerial offer of
Christ, before men can have Union with him.

But yet all the preaching in the world can never effect this Union with
Christ, in it self, and in its own virtue, except a supernatural and mighty
power go forth with it for that end and purpose. Let Boanerges and Barnabas try
their strength, let the Angels of heaven be the preachers; till God draw, the
soul cannot come to Christ.

No saving benefit is to be had by Christ without Union with his person, no
Union with his person without faith, no faith ordinarily wrought without the
preaching of the Gospel by Christ's Ambassadors, their preaching has no saving
efficacy without Gods drawings; as will evidently appear by considering these
words and the occasion of them.

The occasion of these words is found (as Learned Cameron well observes) in the
42. verse. And they said, Is not this Jesus Cameronis Myrothes. p. 139.
the son of Joseph, whose Father and Mother we know? Christ had been pressing
upon them in his ministry the great and necessary duty of faith, but
notwithstanding the Authority of the preacher, the holiness of his life, the
miracles by which he confirmed his doctrine, they still objected against him,
is not this the Carpenters. Son? from whence Christ takes the occasion of these
words: No man can come unto me except my Father which has sent me draw him: q.
d. In vain is the Authority of my person urged, in vain are all the miracles
wrought in your sight to confirm the doctrine preached to you, till that secret
almighty power of the Spirit be put forth upon your hearts, you will not, you
cannot come unto me.

The words are a Negative proposition.

In which the Author and powerful manner of divine operation in working faith
are contained: there must be drawing before believing, and that drawing must be
the drawing of God: every word has its weight, we will consider them in the
order they lie in the Text.

(...) -- No man] not one, let his Natural qualifications be what they will,
let his external advantages in respect of means and helps be never so great: it
is not in the power of any man: all persons in all ages need the same power of
God, one as well as another: every man is alike dead, impotent, and averse to
faith in his Natural Capacity. No man, or -- not one, among all the sons of men.

(...) -- Can] or is able: he speaks of impotency to special and saving
actions, such as believing in Christ is: no act that is saving can be done
without the concurrence of special grace. Other acts that have a remote
tendency to it, are performed by a more general concourse and common
assistance, so men may come to the word, and attend what is spoken, remember,
and consider what the word tells them; but as to believing or coming to Christ,
that no man can do of himself, or by a general and common assistance. No man can

(...), -- come unto me] (i. e.) believe in me unto Salvation. Coming to
Christ, and believing in him are terms aequipollent, and are indifferently used
to express the nature of saving faith, as is plain from ver. 35. he that comes
to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst: it
notes the terms from which, and to which the soul moves, and the voluntariness
of the motion, notwithstanding that divine power by which the will is drawn to
Christ.

(...) -- Except my Father] not excluding the other two persons, for every work
of God relating to the Creatures is common to all the three persons, nor only
to note that the Father is the first in order of working: but the reason is
hinted in the next words,

(...) -- who has sent me] God having entered into Covenant with the son and
sent him, stands obliged by that paction to bring the promised seed to him, and
that he does by drawing them to Christ by faith: so the next words tell us the
Father does

(...) -- draw him] that is powerfully and effectually incline his will to come
to Christ: not by a violent coaction, Non violenta coactio^mmediata, sed
voluntatis a deo aaversae henevola flectio. Glass. Rhet: Sacra. p. 2^6.
but by a benevolent bending of the will which was averse; and as it is not in
the way of force and compulsion, so neither is it by a simple moral suasion, by
the bare proposal of an object to the will, and so leaving the sinner to his
own election, but it is such a persuasion as has a mighty overcoming efficacy
accompanying it: of which more anon.

The words thus opened the Observation will be this:

Doct.
That it is utterly impossible for any man to come to Jesus Christ Doct.
unless he be drawn unto him by the special and mighty power of God.

No man is compelled to come to Christ against his will, he that comes, comes
willingly, but even that will and desire to come is the effect of grace: Phil.
2. 13. It is God that works in you both to will, and to do, of his own good
pleasure.

If we desire the help and assistance of grace (says Fulgentius) Ut ergo
desideremus adjutorium, hoc quoque est gratiae; ipsa namque incipit effundi, ut
incipiat posci. Fulgen. Epist. 6. ad Theod.
even the desire is of grace; grace must first be shed forth upon us before we
can begin to desire it: by grace are y^ saved through faith, and that not of
your selves, it is the gift of God, Ephesians. 2. 8. suppose the utmost degree of
natural ability, let a man be as much disposed and prepared as nature can
dispose or prepare him, and to all this add the proposal of the greatest
arguments and motives to induce him to come; let all these have the advantage
of the fittest season to work upon his heart; yet no man can come till God draw
him: we move as we are moved; as Christ's coming to us, so our coming to him are
the pure effects of grace.

Three things require Explication in this point before us. First, What the
drawing of the Father imports.
Secondly, In what manner he draws men to Christ.
Thirdly, How it appears that none can come till they be so drawn.


First, What the drawing of the Father imports.

To open this, let it be considered, that drawing is usually 1.
distinguished into Physical and Moral. The former is either by coaction, force,
and compulsion, or by a sweet congruous efficacy upon the will: as to violence
and compulsion it is none of Gods way and Method, it being both against the
nature of the will of man which cannot be forced, and against the will of Jesus
Christ who loves to reign over a free and willing people, Psalm. 110. 4. The
people shall be willing in the day of thy power: or as that word may be
rendered, they shall be voluntarinesses, as willing as willingness it self: it
is not then by a forcible coaction, but in a Moral way of persuasion that God
the Father draws men to Jesus Christ: he draws with the bands of a man, as they
are called, Hosea 11. 14. (i. e.) in a way of rational conviction of the mind
and Conscience, and effectual persuasion of the will.

But yet by Moral persuasion we must not understand a simple and bare proposal
or tender of Christ and grace, leaving it still at the sinners choice whether
he will comply with it or no, Non videmus deum concionautem, scribentem,
docentem, tamen ac si videmus, credimus, habet enim omn is veritas vim
inclinativam, and major, majorem; and maxima, maximam: sed cur ergo non omnes
credunt evangelio? Respondeo, quod non omnes trahuntur a deo. Baptist.
Mantuanus de patientia, lib. 3. cap. 2.
for though God do not force the will contrary to its nature, yet there is a
real internal efficiency employed in this drawing, or an immediate operation of
the Spirit upon the heart and will which in a way Congruous and suitable to its
nature takes away the rebellion and reluctance of it, and of unwilling makes it
willing to come to Christ: and in this respect we own a physical as well as a
Moral influence of the Spirit in this work: and so the Scripture expresses it,
Ephesians. 1. 19, 20. that we may know what is the exceeding greatness of his power
toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power which he
wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead: here is much more than a
naked proposal made to the will, there is a power as well as a tender,
greatness of power, and yet more, the exceeding greatness of his power; and
this power has an actual efficiency ascribed to it, he works upon our hearts
and wills according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in
Christ, when he raised him from the dead: thus he fulfills in us all the good
pleasure of his will, and the work of faith with power, 2 These. 1. 11.

And this is that which the Schools call gratia efficax, effectual grace, and
others victrix delectatio an overcoming conquering Coelestis qu edam and
ineffabilis suavitas. Jansenius Aug. Lib. 4. cap. 1.
delight: thus the work is carried on with a most efficacious sweetness. So
that the liberty of the will is not infringed, whilst the obstinacy of the will
is effectually subdued and overruled: for want of this there are so many
almost Christians in the world, hence are all those vanishing imperfect works
which come to nothing, called in Scripture a morning cloud, an early dew: had
this mighty power gone forth with the word, they had never vanished, or
perished like Embryos as they do: So then, God draws not only in a moral way by
proposing a suitable object to the will, but also in a physical way, or by
immediate powerful influence upon the will: not infringing the Liberty of it;
but yet infallibly and effectually persuading it to come to Christ.

Secondly, Next let us consider the mavelous way and 2.
manner in which the Lord draws the souls of poor sinners to Jesus Christ; and
you will find he does it 1. Gradually, 2. Congruously, 3. Powerfully, 4.
Effectually, and 5. Finally.


First, This blessed work is carried on by the Spirit gradually, bringing the
soul step by step in the due method and order of the Gospel to Christ:
illumination, conviction, compunction prepare the way to Christ; and then faith
unites the soul to him: without humiliation there can be no faith, Mat. 21. 32.
ye repented not, that ye might believe: it is the burdensome sense of sin that
brings the soul to Christ for rest, Mat. 11. 28. come unto me ye that are weary
and heavy laden: but without Conviction there can be no Compunction, no
humiliation; he that is not convinced of his sin and misery, never bewails it
nor mourns for it: never was there one tear of true repentance seen to drop
from the eye of an unconvinced sinner.

And without illumination there can be no Conviction, for what is Conviction
but the application of the light which is in the understanding or mind of a man
to his heart and Conscience? Acts 2. 37. In this order therefore the Spirit
(ordinarily) draws souls to Christ, he shines into their minds by illumination,
applys that light to their Consciences by effectual Conviction, breaks and
wounds their hearts for sin in Compunction, and then moves the will to embrace
and close with Christ in the way of Faith for life and salvation.

These several steps are more distinctly discerned in some Christians than in
others; they are more clearly to be seen in the Adult Convert, than those that
were drawn to Christ in their youth; in such as were drawn to him out of a
state of profaneness, than those that had the advantage of a pious education;
but in this order the work is carried on ordinarily in all, however it differ
in point of clearness in the one, and in the other.

Secondly, He draws sinners to Christ Congruously, and very agreeably to the
nature and way of man. So he speaks, Hosea 11. 4. I drew them with the cords of
a man, with bands Fu^ibus hominum (i. e.) humanis: n^ quibus trahi ac deduci
solent boves.
of love: not as beasts are drawn, but as men are inclined and wrought to
compliance by rational Conviction of their Judgments, and powerful persuasion
of their wills; the minds of sinners are naturally blinded by ignorance, 2 Cor.
4. 3, 4. and their affections bewitched to their Lusts, Gal. 3. 4. and whilst
it is thus, no arguments of entreaties can possibly prevail to bring them off
from the ways of sin to Christ.

The way therefore which the Lord takes to win and draw them to Christ, is by
rectifying their false apprehensions, and showing them infinitely more good in
Christ than in the Creature, and in their Lusts, yea, by satisfying their
understandings that there is goodness enough in Jesus Christ, to whom he is
drawing them,

First, To outbid all temporal good, which is to be denied for his sake.

Secondly, To preponderate all temporal evils which are to be suffered for his
sake.

First, That there is more good in Christ than in all temporal good things,
which we are to deny or forsake upon his account: this being once clearly and
convincingly discovered to the understanding, the will is thereby prepared to
quit all that which entangles and with holds it from coming to Christ: there is
no man that loves money so much, but he will willingly part with it for that
which is more worth to him than the sum he parts with to purchase it: Matthew.
13. 45, 46. The Kingdom of heaven is like to a Merchant man, seeking goodly
Pearls, who when he has found one Pearl of great price, goes and sells all
that he has and buyeth it.

Such an invaluable Pearl is Jesus Christ, infinitely more worth than all that
a poor sinner has to part with for him, and is a more real good than the
creature. These are but vain shadows, Prove. 23. 5. Christ is a solid
substantial good: yea, he is, and by Conviction appears to be a more suitable
good than the creature: the world cannot justify and save, but Christ can.
Christ is a more necessary good than the creature, this is for our temporal
Convenience, but he of eternal necessity. He is a more Durable good than any
creature comfort is or can be: the fashion of this world passes away, 1 Cor.
7. 31. but durable riches and righteousness are in him, Prove. 8. 17. Thus
Christ appears in the day of conviction infinitely more excellent than the
world, he out-bids all the offers that the world can make, and this gives the
main stroke to this work, of drawing a Soul to Jesus Christ.

Secondly, And then (to remove every block out of the way to Christ) God
discovers to the Soul enough in him to preponderate and much more than
recompense all the evils and sufferings it can endure for his sake.

It Is true, they that close with Christ, close with his cross also: they must
expect to save no more but their souls by him: he tells us what we must trust
to, Luke 14. 26, 27. If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother,
and wife and children, and brethren and sisters; yea, and his own life also; he
cannot be my disciple: and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me,
cannot be my disciple.

To read such a Text as this with such a Comment upon it as Satan and our own
flesh can make, is enough to scare a man from Christ for ever: nor is it
possible by all the arguments in the world to draw any soul to Christ upon such
terms as these, till the Lord convince it, that there is enough, and much more
than enough in Jesus Christ to recompense all these sufferings and losses we
endure for him.

But when the soul is satisfied that these sufferings are but external upon the
vile body, but the benefit that comes by Christ is internal in a mans-own soul,
These afflictions are but temporal, Romans 8. 18. but Christ and his benefits are
eternal: this must need prevail with the will to come over to Christ
notwithstanding all the evils of suffering that accompany him, when the reality
of all this is discovered by the Lord, and the power of God goes along with
these discoveries. Thus the Lord draws in our own way, by rational Convictions
of the understanding and allurements of the will.

And it is possible this may be the reason why some poor souls mis-judge the
workings of the Spirit of God upon them selves, thinking they never had that
wonderful and mighty power of God in conversion acting upon their hearts,
because they find all that is done upon their hearts that way, is done in the
ordinary course and method of Nature: they consider, compare, are convinced,
and then resolve to choose Christ and his ways; whereas they expect to feel
some strange operations that shall have the visible Characters of the immediate
power of God upon them, and such a power they might discern, if they would
consider it as working in this way and method: but they cannot distinguish Gods
acts from their own, and that puzzles them.

Thirdly, The drawings of the Father are very powerful. The arm of the Lord is
revealed in this work, Isa. 53. 1. It was a powerful word indeed that made the
light at first shine out of darkness, and no less power is required to make it
shine into our hearts, 2 Cor. 5. 14. That day in which the soul is made willing
to come to Christ, is called the day of his power, Psalm. 110. 3. The Scripture
expresses the work of conversion by a threefold Metaphor. viz.

That of a resurrection from the dead, Romans 6. 4.

That of Creation, Ephesians. 2. 10. And

That of Victory or Conquest, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. All these set forth the infinite
power of God in this work, for no less than almighty power is required to each
of them; and if you strictly examine the distinct notions, you shall find the
power of God more and more illustriously displayed in each of them.

To raise the dead is the effect of almighty power, but then there surrection
suppseth pre-existent matter. In the work of creation, there is no pre-existent
matter, but then there is no opposition: that which is not, rebels not against
the power that gives it being. But Victory and Conquest supposes opposition,
all the power of corrupt Nature arming it self and fighting against God, but
yet not able to frustrate his design.

Let the soul whom the father draws struggle and reluctate S^avis motus in
verbo, and sortis tractus in Deo. Est enim quaedam necessitas vuluntaria.
Moulin. Anat. Ar^in.
as much as it can, it shall come, yea, and come willingly too, when the
drawing power of God is upon it. O the self-conflicts, the contrary resolves
with which the soul finds it self distracted and rent asunder! the hopes and
fears, the encouragements and discouragements, they will, and they will not!
but victorious grace conquers all opposition at last. We find an excellent
example of this in blessed Augustine Ita due voluntates (...), una vetus, alia
nov^, illa carnalis, illa spiritualis confligibant inter se atque discordando
dissipabant animam medan. -- ibi enim magis jam non ego, quia ex magna part id
patiebar invitus, quod^ faciebam volens. Aug. confess. lib. 8. c. 5.
who speaks of this very work, the drawing of his soul to Christ, and how he
f^lt in that day two wills in himself, one old, the other ne^; one carnal, the
other spiritual, and how in these their contrary motions and conflicts he was
torn asunder in his own thoughts and resolutions, suffering that unwillingly,
which he did willingly. And certainly if we consider how deep the soul is
rooted by natural inclination, and long continued custom in sin, how extremely
averse it is to the ways of strict godliness and mortification, how Satan that
invidious enemy, that strong man armed fortifies the soul to defend his
possession against Christ, and intrenches himself in the understanding, will,
and affections; by deep rooted prejudices against Christ and holiness, it is
the wonder of wonders to see a soul quitting all its beloved lusts and fleshly
interests and endearments, and coming willingly under Christ's yoke.

Fourthly, The drawings of God are very effectual: there is indeed a Common and
ineffectual work upon hypocrites and Apostates, called in Scripture a morning
cloud, an early dew, Hosea 6. 4. these may believe for a time, and fall away at
last, Luke 8. 13. their wills may be half won, they may be drawn half way to
Christ, and return again. So it was with Agrippa, Acts 26. 28. (...), within a
very little Suadere est conantis, persuadere efficientis: suadet qui consulit,
persuadit qui quo vult inducit hominem. Erasm.
thou perswadest me to be a Christian: but in Gods elected ones it is
effectual: their wills are not only almost, but altogether persuaded to embrace
Christ, and quit the ways of sin, how pleasant, gainful and dear soever they
have been to them: the Lord not only draws, but draws home those souls to
Christ, Joh. 6. 37. all that the Father has given me, shall come to me.

It is confessed, that in the drawing home of the very elect to Christ, there
may be and frequently are many pauses, stands, and demurrs, they have
convictions, affections and resolutions stirring in them, which like early
blossoms seem to be nipt and dye away again. There is frequently (in young ones
especially) an hopeful appearance of grace, they make conscience of sins, and
duties: they have sometimes notable rouzings and awakenings under the word,
they are observed to affect retirements for meditation and prayer, and delight
to be in the company of Christians, and after all this, youthful lusts and
vanities are found to stifle and choke these hopeful beginnings, and the work
seems to stand (it may be some years) at a pause, however at last the Lord
makes it victorious over all opposition, and sets it home with power upon their
hearts.

Fifthly, To conclude, Those whom the Father draws to Christ he draws to him
finally and for ever. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance, Romans
11. 29. They are so as to God the giver, he never repents that he has called
his people into the fellowship of his Son Christ Jesus: and they are so on the
believers part, he is never sorry, whatever he afterward meets with, that he
is come to Christ.

There is a time when Christians are drawn to Christ, but there shall never be
a time in which they shall be drawn away from Christ, Joh. 10. 29. there is no
plucking them out of the Fathers hand. It was common to a Proverb in the
Primitive times; when they would express an impossibility, you may as soon draw
a Christian from Christ, as do it: when Christ asked that question of the
disciples, Will ye also go away? Lord (says Peter in the name of them all) to
whom shall we go? thou have the words of eternal life; Joh. 6. 68. They that
are thus drawn do with full purpose of heart cleave unto the Lord. And thus of
the manner and quality of effectual drawing.

Thirdly, In the last place, I am to evince the impossibility of coming to
Christ without the Fathers drawings: and this (...).
will evidently appear upon the consideration of these two particulars.

First, The difficulty of this work is above all the power of nature to
overcome.

Secondly, That little power and abili^y that nature has, it will never employ
to such a purpose as this, till the drawing power of God be upon the will of a
sinner.

First, If all the power of nature were employed in this design, yet such are
the difficulties of this work, that it surmounts all the abilities of nature:
this the Scripture roundly and plainly affirms, Ephesians. 2. 8. by grace are ye
saved through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God. To
think of Christ is easy, but to come to Christ is (to nature) impossible: to
send forth lazy and ineffectual wishes to Christ we may; but to bring Christ
and the soul together requires the almighty power of God, Ephesians. 1. 19. The grace
of faith by which we come to Christ, is as much the free gift of God, as Christ
himself who is the object of faith, Phil. 1. 29. to you it is freely given to
believe. And this will easily let it self into your understandings if you but
consider the Subject, of this work of faith or coming to Christ. Act, and
Enemies

First, Consider the Subject of faith in which it is wrought, or what it is
that is drawn to Christ: it is the heart of a sinner: 1.
which is naturally as indisposed to this work as the wood which Elijah laid in
order upon the Altar was to catch fire, when he had poured so much water upon
it as did not only wet the wood, but also filled up the trench round about it,
1. Kings 18. 33. For it is naturally a dark, blind, and ignorant heart, Job 11.
12. and such an heart can never believe, till he that commanded the light to
shine out of darkness, do shine into it, 2 Cor. 5. 14.

Nor will it avail any thing to say, though man be born in darkness and
ignorance, yet afterward he may acquire knowledge in the use of means, as we
see many natural men do in a very high degree: for this is not that light that
brings the soul to Christ, yea, this natural unsanctified light blinds the soul
and prejudices it more against Christ than ever it was before, 1 Cor. 1. 21, 26.

As it is a blind and ignorant heart, so it is a selfish heart by nature: all
its designs and aims terminate in Self: this is the Center and weight of the
soul, no righteousness but its own is sought after, that, or none, Romans 10. 3.
now for a soul to renounce and deny Self in all its forms, modes, and
interests, as every one does that comes to Christ; To disclaim and deny
natural, moral, and religious Self and come to Christ, as a poor, miserable,
wretched, empty creature; to live upon his righteousness for ever, is as
supernatural and wonderful, as to see the hills and mountains start from their
bases and Centres, and fly like wandering Atoms in the Air.

Nay this heart which is to come to Christ is not only dark and selfish, but
full of pride. O'tis a desperate proud heart by nature, it cannot submit to
come to Christ as Benhadads servants came to the King of Israel with sackcloath
on their loins, and ropes upon their heads. To take guilt, shame and confusion
of face to our selves, and acknowledge the righteousness of God in our eternal
damnation; to come to Christ naked and empty as one that justifies the ungodly;
I say nature left to it self, would as soon be damned as do this: the proud
heart can never come to this, till the Lord have humbled and broken it by his
power.

Secondly, Let us take the Act of faith into consideration also, as it is here
described, by the souls coming to Jes^s 2.
Christ, and you will find a necessity of the Fathers drawings, for this
evidently implies that which is against the stream and current of corrupt
nature, and that which is above the Sphere and capacity of the most refined and
accomplished nature.

First, It Is against the Stream and Current of our corrupt nature to come to
Christ. For let us but consider the Term from which the soul departs when it
comes to Christ. In that day it leaves all its lusts and ways of sin, how
pleasant, sweet and profitable soever they have been unto it. Isa. 55. 7. Let
the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him
return unto the Lord: way and thoughts, (i. e.) both the practice and delight
of sin, must be forsaken, the outward and inward man must be cleansed from it.
Now there are in the bosoms of unregenerate men such darling Lusts, that have
given them so much practical, and speculative pleasure, which have brought so
much profit to them, which have been born and bred up with them, and which upon
all these accounts are endeared to their souls to that degree; that it is easier
for them to dye, than to forsake them: yea, nothing is more common among such
men, than to venture eternal damnation, rather than suffer a separation from
their sins.

And which is yet much more difficult in coming to Christ, the soul forsakes
not only its sinful self, but its righteous self: (i. e.) not only its worst
sins, but its best performances, accomplishments, and excellencies. Now this is
one of the greatest straits that Nature can be put to: righteousness by works
was the first liquor that ever was put into the vessel, and it still retains
the tang and savor of it, and will to the end of the world. Romans 10. 3. For
they being ignorant os Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
(...), they have not submitted: to come naked and empty to Christ and receive
all from him as a free gift, is to proud corrupt nature, the greatest abasement
and submission in the world.

Let the gospel furnish its Table with the richest and costliest dainties that
ever the blood of Christ purchased, such is the pride of nature, that it
disdains to taste them; except it may also pay the reckoning. If the old Hive be
removed from the place where it was wont to stand, the Bees will come home to
the old place, yea, and many of them you shall find will dye there, rather than
go to the Hive though it stand in a far better place than it did before. Just
so stands the case with men. The Hive is removed, (i. e.) we are no more to
expect righteousness as Adam did, by obeying and working, but by believing, and
coming to Christ; but nature had as lieve be damned as do this: it still goes
about to establish its own righteousness.

Virtues, Duties, and Moral excellencies these are the Ornaments of nature,
here is Nature set off in its sumptuous attire and rich embellishments, and now
to renounce it, disclaim and contemn it as dross and dung in comparison of
Christ as believers do, Phil. 3. 8. this I say is against the grain of nature.
We reckon it the strange effect of self denial in Mahomet the Great, who being
so enamoured with his beautiful Irene, would be persuaded upon reasons of
Knowles History of the Turks.
State with his own hand to strike off her head, and that when she appeared in
all her rich ornaments before him, rather like such a Goddess as the Poets in
their ecstasies use to feign, than a mortal creature: and yet certainly this
nothing is to that self denial which is exercised in our coming to Christ.

Secondly, And if we look to the other Term to which the soul moves, we shall
find it acting as much above the Sphere and ability of improved Nature as here
it acts and moves against the stream and current of corrupted nature: for how
wonderful and supernatural an adventure is that which the soul makes in the day
that it comes to Jesus Christ!

Surely for any poor soul to venture it self for ever upon Jesus Christ whom it
never saw, nay, upon Christ whose very existence its own unbelief calls into
question whether he be, or no: and that when it is even weighed down to the dust
with the burdensome sense of its own vileness and total unworthiness, feeling
nothing in it self but sin and misery, the workings of death and fears of
wrath: to go to Christ of whose pardoning grace and mercy it never had any the
least experience, nor can find any ground of hope in it self that it shall be
accepted; this is as much above the power of nature, as it is for a stone to
rise from the earth and fix it self among the Stars: well might the Apostle
ascribe it to that almighty power which raised up Christ from the dead, Ephesians. 1.
19, 20. if the Lord draw not the Soul, and that with an omnipotent pull, it can
never come from it self to Christ. And yet farther,

Thirdly, The Natural impossibility of coming to Christ will more clearly
appear, if we consider the enemies to faith, or what blocks are rolled by Satan
and his instruments into the way to Christ: to mention (in this place) no more,
but our own carnal reason as it is armed and managed by the subtilty of Satan;
what a wonder is it that any soul should come to Christ?

These are the strong holds (mentioned 2 Cor. 10. 4.) out of which those
objections, fears and discouragements sally, by which the soul is fiercely
assaulted in the way to Christ.

Will thou forsake all thy pleasures, merry company, and sensible comforts to
live a sad, retired, pensive life? will thou beggar and undo thy self, let go
thy comforts in hand for an hope of that which thine eyes never saw, nor have
thou any certainty that it is any more than a fancy? will thou that have lived
in reputation and credit all thy life, now become the scorn and contempt of the
world? think thou thy self able to live such a strict, severe, mortified and
selfdenying a life, as the word of God requires? and what if persecution should
arise, (as thou must expect it will) can thou forsake father and mother, wife
and children, yea, and give up thine own life too to a cruel and bloody death?
be advised better before thou resolve in so important a matter: what think
thou of thy forefathers, that lived and dyed in that way thou art now leaving?
art thou wiser than they? do not the generality of men walk in the same paths
thou have hitherto walked in? if this way lead to hell as thou fear it may;
think then how many millions of men must perish as well as thy self, and is
such a supposition consistent with the gracious and merciful nature of God?
Besides, think what sort of people those are unto whom thou art about to join
thy self in this new way? are there not to be found among them many things to
discourage thee and cool thy zeal? they are generally of the lower and baser
sort of men, poor and despicable: see thou not though their profession be
holy, how earthly, carnal, proud, factious, and hypocritical many of them are
found to be! and doubtless the rest are like them, though their hypocrisy be
not yet discovered.

O what stands, and demurrs! what hesitations, and doubts is the soul clogged
with in its way to Christ! but yet none of these can withold and detain the
soul; when the Father draws: greater is he that is in us, than he that is in
the world: and thus you see the nature, manner, and efficacy of divine
drawings, and how impossible it is for any Soul to come to Christ without them.

The Inferences and Improvements of the point follow.

Infer. 1.
How deeply and thoroughly is the nature of man corrupted, and Infer. 1.
what an enemy is every man to his own happiness, that he must be drawn to it?
Joh. 5. 40. you will not come unto me that ye might have life.

Life is desirable in every man's eyes, and eternal is the most excellent life;
yet in this the world is agreed rather to dye and perish for ever than come to
Christ for life. Had Christ told us of Fields and Vineyards, Sheep and Oxen,
Gold and Silver, honors and sensual pleasures, who would not have come to him
for these? but to tell them of mortification, self-denial, strictness of life,
and sufferings for his sake, and all this for an happiness to be enjoyed in the
world to come, nature will never like such a proposition as this.

You see where it sticks, not in a simple inability to believe, but in an
inability complicated with enmity, they neither can come, nor will come to
Christ: it is true, all that do come to Christ come willingly, but thanks to the
grace of God that has freed and persuaded the will, else they had never been
willing to come: who ever found his own heart first stir and move toward
Christ? how long may we wait and expect before we shall feel our hearts
naturally burn with desires after, and love to Jesus Christ?

This aversation of the will and affections from God is one of the master roots
of original sin. No argument can prevail to bring the soul to Christ, till this
be mastered and overpowred by the Fathers drawings. In our motions to sin we
need trigging: but in all our motions to Christ we as much need drawing. He
that comes to heaven may say, Lord if I had had my own way and will I had never
come here: if thou had not drawn me I should never have come to thee. O the
riches of the grace of God! oh unparalled mercy and goodness! not only to
prepare such a glory as this for an unworthy soul, but to put forth the
exceeding greatness of thy power afterward to draw an unwilling soul to the
enjoyment of it!

Inference 2.
What enemies are they to God and the souls of men, that do all they can to
discourage and hinder the Conversion of men to Christ? Infer. 2.
God draws forward, and these do all that in them lies to draw backward, (i.
e.) to prejudice and discourage them from coming to Jesus Christ in the way of
faith: this is a direct opposition to God, and a plain Confederacy with the
Devil.

O how many have been thus discouraged in their way to Christ, by their carnal
relations, I cannot say friends! their greatest enemies have been the men of
their own house: these have pleaded (as if the Devil had hired and fee'd them)
against the everlasting welfare of their own flesh. O cruel parents, brethren,
and sisters; that jeer, frown, and threaten; where they should encourage,
assist and rejoice! such parents are the Devils children. Satan chooses such
instruments as you are above all others for this work: he knows that influence
and authority you have upon them, and over them: and what fear, love, and
dependence they have for you, and upon you: so that none in all the world are
like to manage the design of their damnation so effectually as you are like to
do it.

Will you neither come to Christ your selves, nor suffer your dear relations
that would? had you rather find them in the Alehouse, than in the Closet? did
you instrumentally give them their being, and will you now be the instruments
of ruining for ever those beings they had from you? did you so earnestly desire
children, so tenderly nurse and provide for them, take such delight in them,
and after all this do what in you lies to damn and destroy them? if these lines
shall fall into any such hands, O that God would set home the conviction and
sense of this horrid evil upon their hearts.

And no less guilty of this sin are scandalous and Ioose professors who serve
to furnish the Devil with the greatest arguments he has to dissuade men from
coming to Christ: it is your looseness and hypocrisy by which he hopes to scare
others from Christ. It Is said Cant. 2. 7. I charge you by the Roes and Hinds of
the field, that ye stir not up nor awake my beloved till he please.

Roes and Hinds (like young Converts, and comers toward Christ) are shy and
timorous Creatures that start at the least sound, or yelp of a dog; and fly
away: take heed what you do in this case, lest you go down to hell under the
guilt of damning more souls than your own.

supernatural effects that you behold and so admire in the Infer. 3.
world, as often as you see sinners for saking their pleasant profitable
corruptions and companions, and embracing the ways of Christ, godliness, and
mortification.

It is said 1 Pet. 4. 4. they think it strange that you run not with them into
the same excess of riot: the word is (...), they stand at a gaze as the hen
that has hatched Patridge eggs does, when she sees them take the wing and fly
away from her.

Beloved, it is the worlds wonder to see their Companions in sin forsake them:
those that were once as profane and vain as themselves, it may be more, to
forsake their society, retire into their Closets, mourn for sin, spend their
time in meditation and prayer, embrace the severest duties, and content to run
the greatest hazards in the world for Christ; but they see not that almighty
power that draws them, which is too strong for all the sinful ties and
engagements in the world to withold and detain them.

A man would have wondered to see Elisha leave the Oxen and run after Elijah
saying, Let me go I pray thee and kiss my Father and my Mother; and then I will
follow thee; when Elijah had said nothing to persuade him to follow him, only
as he past by him he cast his mantle on him, 1 Kings 10. 19, 20. Surely, that
soul whom God draws must needs leave all and follow Christ, for the power of
God rests on it: all carnal ties and engagements to sin break and give way
when the Father draws the soul to Christ in the day of his power.

Inference 4.
Is this the first spring of spiritual motion after Christ? learn then from
hence how it comes to pass that so many excellent Sermons and Infer. 4.
powerful persuasions are ineffectual, and cannot draw or win one soul to
Christ. Surely it is because ministers draw alone, and the special saving power
of God goes not forth at all times alike with their endeavors.

Paul was a chosen Vessel, filled with a greater measure of gifts and graces by
the Spirit than any that went before him, or followed after him; and as his
talents so his diligence in improving them was beyond any recorded example we
read of amongst men: he rather * flew like a Seraphim than traveled upon his
masters errand about the world. Apollo was an (...). Chrysostom.
eloquent preacher and mighty in the Scriptures, yet Paul is nothing, and
Apollo nothing; but God that gives the increase, 1 Cor. 3. 7. We are too apt to
admire men, yea, and the best men are but too apt to go forth in the strength
of their own parts and preparations; but God secures his own glory, and
magnifies his own power frequently in giving success to weaker endeavors, and
men of lower abilities, when he withholds it from men of more raised; refined,
and excellent gifts and abilities.

It is our great honor who are the ministers of the Gospel that we are (...)
workers together with God, 1 Cor. 3. 9. in his strength we can prevail, the
weapons of our warfare are mighty through God, 2 Cor. 10. 4. but if his
presence, blessing and assistance be not with us we are nothing, we can do
nothing.

If we prepare diligently; pray heartily, preach zealously, and our hearers go
as they came without any spiritual effects and fruits of our labors; what
shall we say, but as Martha said to Christ, Lord if thou had been here my
Brother had not dyed: had the Spirit of God gone forth with his especial
efficacy and blessing with this prayer, or that Sermon; these souls had not
departed dead and senseless from under it.

Infer. 5.
Does all success and efficacy depend upon the Fathers drawings? Infer. 5.
Let none then despair of their unregenerate and carnal relations, over whose
obstinacy they do, and have cause to mourn.

What if they have layen as many years under the preaching of the Gospel as
that poor man did at the pool of Bethesda, and hitherto to no purpose? a time
may come at last (as it did for him) when the Spirit of God may move upon the
waters, I mean, put a quickening and converting power into the means, and then
the desire of your souls for them shall be fulfilled.

It may be you have poured out many prayers and tears to the Lord for them, you
have cried for them as Abraham for his Son, O that Ishmael might live before
thee! O that this poor husband, wise, child, brother or sister might live in
thy sight, and still you see they contain at one rate, carnal, dead and
senseless: well, but yet give not up your hopes, nor cease your pious
endeavors, the time may come when the Father may draw as well as you, and then
you shall see them quit all and come to Christ, and nothing shall hinder them.
They are now drawn away of their own lusts, they are easily drawn away by their
sinful Companions, but when God draws, none of these shall withdraw them from
the Lord Jesus. What is their ignorance, obstinacy, and hardness of heart
before that mighty power that subdues all things to it self? Go therefore to
the Lord by prayer for them, and say, Lord I have labored for my poor
relations in vain, I have spent my exhortations to little purpose: the work is
too difficult for me, I can carry it no farther, but thou can; O let thy
power go forth, they shall be willing in the day of thy power.

Infer. 6.
If none can come to Christ except the Father draw them, then surely none can
be drawn from Christ except the Father leave Infer. 6.
them: that power which at first drew them to Christ, can secure and establish
them in Christ to the end. Joh. 10. 29. my Father which gave them me is greater
than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.

When the power of God at first draws us out of our natural state to Christ, it
sinds us not only impotent, but obstinate, not only unable but unwilling to
come; and yet this power of God prevails against all opposition: how much more
is it able to preserve and secure us, when his fear is put into our inward
parts, so that we dare ^t depart, we have no will to depart from him? Well
then, if the world say I will ensnare thee; if the Devil say I will destroy
thee, if the flesh say I will betray thee, yet thou art secure and safe as long
as God has said I will never leave thee nor for sake thee, Heb. 13. 5.

Infer. 7.
Let this engage you to a constant attendance upon the ordinances Infer. 7.
of God in which this drawing power of God is sometimes put forth upon the
hearts of men.

Beloved, there are certain seasons in which the Lord comes nigh to men in the
Ordinances and Duties of his worship, and we know not at what time the Lord
comes forth by his Spirit upon this design: he many times comes in an hour
when we look not for him, when we think not of him, I am found of them that
sought me not, Isa. 65. 1. it is good therefore to be found in the way of the
Spirit: had that poor man that lay so long at the pool of Bethesda reasoned
thus with himself, so long have I lain here in vain expecting a cure, it is to
no purpose to wait longer, and so had been absent at that very time when the
Angel came down, he had in all likelihood carried his disease to the grave with
him.

How do thou know but this very Sabbath, this Sermon, this prayer which thou
have no heart to attend, and art tempted to neglect; may be the season, and
instrument wherein the Lord may do that for thy soul which was never yet done
upon it?

Infer. 8.
To conclude, how are all the Saints engaged to put forth all the Infer. 8.
power and ability they have for God, who has put forth his infinite almighty
power to draw them to Christ!

God has done great things for your souls, he has drawn you out of the
miserable state of sin and wrath, and that when he let others go, by nature as
good as you, he has drawn you into Union with Christ, and Communion with his
glorious privileges. O that you would henceforth employ all the power you have
for God in duties of obedience, and in drawing others to Christ as much as in
you lies, and say continually with the Church, Draw me, we will run after thee.

The Fifth SERMON. Sermon. 5.

EPHESIANS. 2. 1. And you has he quickened who were dead in trespasses Opening
that work of the Spirit more particularly, by which the soul is enabled to
apply Christ.
and sins.
IN the former Sermons we have seen our Union with Christ in the general nature
of it, and the means by which it is effected, both external by the preaching of
the Gospel, and internal by the drawings of the Father. We are now to bring our
thoughts yet closer to this great mystery, and consider the bonds or ligaments
by which Christ and believers are knit together in a blessed oneness.

And if we heedfully observe the Scripture expressions, and ponder the nature
of this Union, we shall find there are two bands which knit Christ and the soul
together, viz.

1. The Spirit on Christ's part. 2. Faith on our part.
The Spirit on Christ's part, quickening us with spiritual life, whereby Christ
first takes hold of us, and faith on our part, when thus quickened, whereby we
take hold of Christ: accordingly this Union with the Lord Jesus is expressed in
Scripture sometimes by one, and sometimes by the other of these means or bonds
by which it is effected. Christ is sometimes said to be in us, so Col. 1. 27.
Christ in you the hope of glory: and Romans 8. 10. And if Christ be in you the
body is dead because of sin: and other times it is expressed by the other bond
on our part, as 1 John 5. 20. we are in him that is true, even in his son
Christ Jesus: and 2 Cor. 5. 17. if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

The difference betwixt both these is thus aptly expressed by a late Author,
Christ is in believers by his Spirit, 1 John 4. 13. the believer is in Christ
by faith, Joh. 1. 12. Christ Mount Pisga^. p. 22, 23.
is in the believer by inhabitation, Romans 3. 17. the believer is in Christ by
implantation, Romans 6. 35. Christ is in the believer as the head is in the body,
Col. 1. 18. as the root in the branches, Joh. 15. 5. believers are in Christ as
the members are in the head, Ephesians. 1. 23. or as the branches are in the root,
Joh. 15. 1, 7. Christ in the believer implies life and influence from Christ,
Col. 3. 4. the believer in Christ implies Communion, and fellowship with
Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 30. when Christ is said to be in the believer, we are to
understand it in reference to Sanctification; when the believer is said to be
in Christ it is in order to Justification.

Thus we apprehend, being our selves first apprehended by Jesus Christ, Phil.
3. 12. we cannot take hold of Christ, till first he take hold of us, no vital
act of faith can be exercised, till a vital principle be first inspired: of
both these bonds of Union we must speak distinctly, and first of the first,
Christ quickening us by his Spirit in order to our Union with him, of which we
have an account in the Scripture before us, You has he quickened who were dead
in trespasses and sins: in which words we find these two things noted, Viz.

1. The infusion of a vital principle of grace. 2. The total indisposedness of
the subject by nature.
First, The infusion of a vital principle of grace, you has he quickened.
These words [hath he quickened] are a supplement, 1.
made to clear the sense of the Apostle, which else would have been more
obscure by reason of that long Parenthesis betwixt the first and the fifth
verses, for as the Illud (...) regitur a (...). v. 5. est igitur hoc loco and
hyperbaton and synchysis and (...), quae est species (...), cujus quidem
anomaliae causa est (...) interjectio sententiae prolixioris. Piscator. Pooles
Synop.
learned observe, this word (...) you, is governed of the verb (...) has he
quickened, verse 5. so that here the words are transposed from the plain
grammatical order, by reason of the interjection of a long sentence, therefore
with good warrant our Translators have put the verb into this first verse,
which is repeated verse the fifth, and so keeping faithfully to the scope, have
excellently cleared the Syntax and order of the words. Now this verb (...) has
he quickened, imports the first vital act of the spirit of God, ^or his first
enlivening work upon the soul in order to its Union with Jesus Christ: for look
as the blood of Christ is the fountain of all merit, so the Spirit of Christ is
the fountain of all spiritual life: and until he quicken us, (i. e.) infuse the
principle of the divine life into our souls, we can put forth no hand, or vital
act of faith to lay hold upon Jesus Christ.

This his quickening work is therefore the first in order of nature to our
Union with Christ and fundamental to all other acts of grace done and performed
by us from our first closing with Christ throughout the whole course of our
obedience: and this quickening act is said, verse the fifth, to be together Ex
Christo conju^cto nobiscum ut capite cum membris profluunt in nos omnia
beneficia in quorum numero est vivificatio. Rolloc. in Loco.
with Christ: either noting (as some expound it) that it is the effect of the
same power by which Christ was raised from the dead, according to Ephesians. 1. 19.
or rather to be quickened together with Christ notes that new spiritual life
which is infused into our dead souls in the time of our Union with Christ: for
it is Christ to whom we are conjoined and united in our regeneration, out of
whom as a fountain all spiritual benefits flow to us, among which this
vivification or quickening is one, and a most sweet and precious one.

Zanchy, Bodius and many others; will have this quickening to comprize both our
justification and regeneration, and to stand opposed both to infernal and
spiritual death, and it may well be allowed; but it most properly imports our
regeneration, wherein the Spirit in an ineffable and mysterious way, makes the
soul to live to God; yea to live the life of God which was before dead in
trespassis and sins: in which words we have

Secondly, In the next place, the total indisposedness of 2.
the subjects by nature: for as it is well noted by a Non vocat hic semi
mortuos aut aegrotos ac infirmos, sed prorsus mortuos, omni fa ultatebene
cogitandi aut agendi destituti. Rolloc. in Loc.
learned man, The Apostle does not say of these Ephesians* that they were half
dead, or sick and infirm, but dead wholly, altogether dead, destitute of any
faculty or ability so much as to think one good thought, or perform one good
act: you were dead in respect of condemnation; being under the damning sentence
of the Law, and you were dead in respect of the privation of spiritual life,
dead in opposition to Justification, and dead in opposition to regeneration and
sanctification: and the fatal instrument by which their. Souls dyed is here
showed them, you were dead in or by trespasses and sins, this was the Sword
that killed your souls, and cut them off from God. Some do curiously
distinguish betwixt trespasses and sins, as if one pointed at original, the
other at actual sins; but I suppose they are promiscuously used here; and serve
to express the cause of their ruin, or means of their spiritual death and
destruction: this was their case when Christ came to quicken them, dead in sin,
and being so, they could not move themselves toward Union with Christ, but as
they were moved by the quickening Spirit of God.

Hence the observation will be this,

Doct.
That those Souls which have Union with Christ, are quickened with a
Supernatural principle of life by the Spirit of God in order Doct.
thereunto.

The Spirit of God is not only a living Spirit, formally considered, but he is
also the Spirit of life effectively or causally considered: and without his
breathing or infusing li^ into our souls, our Union with Christ is impossible.

It is the observation of learned Camero, that there must be Observandum est
unionem and unitionem inter se disserre: unio est rerum actus, qui formae
rationem habet, nempe actus rerum unitarum qua unitae sunt: unitio autem actus
significat caus^ efficientis, etc. Camero de Eccles. p. 222.
an Unition before there can be a Union with Christ. Unition is to be conceived
efficiently as the work of Gods Spirit, joining the believer to Christ, and
Union is to be conceived formally, the joining it self of the persons together:
we close with Christ by faith, but that faith being a vital act, presupposes a
principle of life communicated to us by the Spirit; therefore it is said Joh.
11. 26. whosoever lives and believes in me shall never dye: the vital act and
operation of faith springs from this quickening Spirit: so in Romans 8, 1, 2. the
Apostle having in the first verse opened the blessed estate of them that are in
Christ, shows us in the second verse how we come to be in him, The Spirit of
life (says he) which is in Christ Jesus has made me free from the Law of sin
and death.

There is indeed a quickening work of the Spirit, which is subsequent to
regeneration, consisting in his exciting, recovering, and actuating of his own
graces in us, and from hence is the liveliness of a Christian; and there is a
quickening act of the Spirit in our regeneration, and from hence is the first
spiritual life of a Christian, of this I am here to speak, and that I may speak
profitably to this point, I will in the Doctrinal part labor to open these
five particulars.

First, What this spiritual life is in its nature and properties. Secondly, In
what manner it is wrought or inspired into the Soul. Thirdly, For what end, or
with what design this life is so inspired. Fourthly, I shall show this work to
be wholly supernatural. And then fifthly, Why this quickening must be
antecedent to our actual closing with Christ by Faith.
First, We will enquire into the nature and properties of 1.
this life, and discover (as we are able) what it is. And we find it to consist
in that wonderful change which the Spirit of God makes upon the frame and
temper of the soul, by his infusing or implanting the principles of grace in
all the powers and faculties thereof.

A change it makes upon the soul, and that a mavelous one, no less than from
death to life, for though a man be physically a living man, (i. e.) his natural
soul has Union with his body, yet his soul having no Union with Christ, he is
Theologically a dead man, Luke 15. 24. and Col. 2. 13. alas it deserves not the
name of life, to have a soul serving only to season and preserve the body a
little while from stinking: to carry it up and down the world, and only enable
it to eat and drink and talk and laugh, and then dye: then do we begin to live,
when we begin to have Union with Christ the fountain of life by his Spirit
communicated to us: from this time we are to reckon our life Hic jacet Similis
cujus aetas multorum annorum fuit, ipse septem dumtaxat annos vixit.
as some have done: there be many changes made upon men besides this, many are
changed from profaneness to Civility, and from mere Civility to formality and
a shadow of Religion, who still remain in the state and power of spiritual
death notwithstanding; but when the Spirit of the Lord is poured out upon us to
quicken us with the new spiritual life, this is a wonderful change indeed: it
gives us an Esse supernaturale, a new supernatural being, which is therefore
called a new creature, the new man, the hidden man of the heart: the natural
essence and faculties of the soul remain still, but it is divested of the old
qualities, and endowed with new ones, 2 Cor. 5. 17. old things are past away,
behold all things are become new.

And this change is not made by altering and rectifying the disorders of the
life only, leaving the temper and frame of the heart still carnal; but by the
infusion of a supernatural permanent principle into the soul, Joh. 4. 14. it
shall be in him a well of water: principles are to a course of actions as
fountains or springs are to the streams and rivers that flow from them, and are
maintained by them: and hence is the evenness and constancy of renewed souls in
the course of godliness.

Nor is this principle or habit acquired by accustoming our selves to holy
actions, as natural habits are acquired by frequent acts, which beget a
disposition, and thence grow up to an habit or second nature; but it is infused
or implanted into the soul by the Spirit of God. So we read Ezekiel. 36. 25, 26. a
new heart also will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you: it
grows not up out of our Natures, but is put, or infused into us: as it is said
of the two witnesses, Rev. 11. 11. who lay dead in a Civil sense three days and
an half, that the Spirit of life from God entered into them; so it is here in a
spiritual sense, the spirit of life from God enters into the dead, carnal
heart: it is all by way of supernatural infusion.

Nor is it limited to this or that faculty of the soul, but grace or life is
poured into all the faculties: behold all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5. 17.
The understanding, will, thoughts, and affections are all renewed by it: the
whole inner man is changed, yea, the tongue and hand, the discourses and
actions, even all the ways and courses of the outward man are renewed by it.

But more particularly, we shall discern the nature of this spiritual life, by
considering the properties of it, among which these are very remarkable.

First, The soul that is joined to Christ, is quickened with a divine life, so
we read in 2 Pet. 1. 4. where believers are said to be partakers or consorts of
the divine nature: a very high expression, and warily to be understood.
Partakers of the divine nature, not essentially, so it is wholly incommunicable
to the Creature, nor yet Hypostatically and personally, so Christ only was a
partaker of it, but our participation of the Divine nature must be understood
in a way proper to believers, that is to say, we partake of it by the
inhabitation of the Spirit of God in us: according to 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17. know ye
not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwells in you?
the Spirit who is God by nature, dwells in and actuates the soul whom he
regenerates, and by sanctifying causes it to live a divine life: from this life
of God the unsanctified are said to be alienated, Ephesians. 4. 18. but believers are
partakers of it.

Secondly, And being divine, it must needs be the most excellent and
transcendent life that any creature does or can live in this world: it
surmounts the natural, rational, and moral life of the unsanctified, as much as
the Angelical life excels the life that flies and worms of the earth do live.

Some think it a rare life to live in sensual pleasures, but the Scripture will
not allow so much as the name of life to them; but tells us they are dead
whilst they live, 1 Timothy 5. 6. certainly it is a wonderful elevation of the
nature of man, to be quickened with such a life as this. There are two ways
wherein the blessed God has honored poor man above the very Angels of heaven.
One was by the Hypostatical Union of our nature in Christ, with the divine
nature; the other is by uniting our persons mystically to Christ, and thereby
communicating spiritual life to us: this later is a most glorious privilege,
and in one respect a more singular mercy than the former; for that honor which
is done to our Nature by the Hypostatical Union, is common to all good and bad,
even they that perish have yet that honor; but to be implanted into Christ by
regeneration, and live upon him as the branch does upon the Vine, this is a
peculiar privilege, a mercy hedged in from the world that is to perish, and
only communicated to Gods elect, who are to live eternally with him in heaven.

Thirdly, This life infused by the regenerating Spirit, is a most pleasant
life. All delights, all pleasures, all joys, which are not fantastic and
delusive, have their spring and origin here. Romans 8. 6. to be spiritually
minded is life and peace, (i. e.) a most serene placid life, such a soul
becomes, so far as it is influenced and sanctified by the Spirit, the very
region of life and peace: when one thing is thus predicated of another in casu
recto (says a learned man) it speaks their intimate Connection: peace is so
connatural to this life, that you may either call it a life that has peace in
it, or a peace that has life in it: yea it has its enclosed pleasures in it,
Such as a stranger intermeddles not with, Prove. 14. 10. Regeneration is the
term from which all true pleasure commences, you never live a merry day, till
you begin to live to God: therefore it is said Luke 15. 24. when the prodigal
son was returned to his Father and reconciled, then they began to be merry.

None can make another by any words to understand what that pleasure is which
the renewed soul feels diffused through all its faculties and affections in its
communion with the Lord, and in the sealings and witnessings of his Spirit.
That is a very apt and well known similitude which Peter Martyr used, and the
Lord blessed to the conversion of that Noble Marquess Galeacius: If, said he, a
man should see a company of people dancing upon the top of a remote hill, he
would be apt to conclude they were a company of wild distracted people; but if
he draw nearer and behold the excellent order, and hear the ravishing sweet
Music that is among them, he will quickly alter his opinion of them, and fall
a dancing himself with them.

All the delights in the sensual-life, all the pleasure that ever your lusts
gave you, are but as the putrid stinking waters of a corrupt pond, where Toads
lie croaking and spawning, to the Crystal streams of the most pure and pleasant
fountain.

Fourthly, This life of God with which the regenerate are quickened in their
Union with Christ as it is a pleasant, so it is also a growing increasing life.
Joh. 4. 14. It shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
life.

It is not in our Sanctification, as it is in our Justification, our
Justification is complete and perfect, no defect is found there, but the new
Creature labors under many defects: all believers are equally Justified, but
not equally Sanctified: therefore you read 2 Cor. 4. 16. that the inward man is
renewed day by day: and 2 Pet. 3. 18. Christians are exhorted to grow in grace,
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior: if this work were perfect and
finished at once as Justification is, there could be no renewing day by day,
nor growth in grace, perfectum est cui nihil deest, and cui nihil addi potest:
the Apostle indeed prays for the Thessalonians, that God would sanctify them
(...) -- wholly, perfectly, 1 These. 5. 23. and this is matter of prayer and
hope, for at last it will grow up to perfection; but this perfect holiness is
reserved for the perfect state in the world to come, and none but Perfectio
Sanctificationis in istha^ vil a non reperitur nisi in somniis quorundam
sanaticorum. (...).
deluded proud spirits boast of it here: but when that which is perfect is
come, then that which is in part shall be done away, 1 Cor. 13. 9, 10. and upon
the imperfection of the new Creature in every faculty, that warfare and daily
conflict spoken of Gal. 5. 17. and experienced by every Christian is grounded:
grace rises gradually in the soul as the Sun does in the heavens, which shines
more and more unto a perfect day, Prove. 4. 18.

Fifthly, To Conclude, this life with which the regenerate are quickened, is an
everlasting life. This is the record, that God has given us eternal life, and
this life is in his son, 1 John 5. 11. this principle of life, is the seed of
God, and that remains in the soul for ever, 1 John 3. 9. it is no transient
vanishing thing, but a fixed permanent principle, which abides in the soul for
ever; a man may lose his gifts, but grace abides: the soul may and must be
separated from the body, but grace cannot be separated from the soul: when all
forsake us, this sticks by us.

This infused principle is therefore vastly different both from the
extraordinary gifts of prophecy wherein the Spirit sometimes was said to come
upon men, under the old Testament, 1 Samuel 10. 6, 10. and from the common
vanishing effects he sometimes produces in the unregenerate, of which we have
frequent accounts in the new Testament, Heb. 6. 4. and Joh. 5. 35. it is one
thing for the Spirit to come upon a man in the way of present influence and
assistance, and another thing to dwell in a man as his Temple.

And thus of the nature and quality of this blessed work of the Spirit in
quickening us.

Secondly, Having seen the nature and properties of the spiritual life, we are
concerned in the next place to enquire 2.
into the way and manner in which it is wrought, and infused by the Spirit: and
here we must say,

First of all, That the work is wrought in the soul very mysteriously, so
Christ tells Nicodemus, Joh. 3. 8. The wind blows where it lists, and thou
hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it comes or whither it
goes, so is every one that is born of the Spirit: there be many opinions among
Philosophers about the original of winds, but we have no certain knowledge of
it: we deseribe it by its effects and properties, but know little of its
original: and if the works of God in nature be so abstruse and unsearchable,
how much more are these sublime and supernatural works of the Spirit so?

We are not able to solve the Phenomenon of nature, we can give no account of
our own formation in the womb, Eccles. 11. 5. who can exactly describe how the
parts of the body are formed and the soul infused? it is curiously wrought in
the lowest parts of the earth, as the Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 139. 16. but how
we know not. Basil says diverse questions may be moved about a Fly, which may
pose the greatest Philosopher: we know little of the forms and essences of
natural things, much less of these profound, and abstruse spiritual things.

Secondly, But though we cannot pry into these secrets by the eye of reason,
yet God has revealed this to us in his word, that it is wrought by his own
almighty power, Ephesians. 1. 19. The Apostle ascribes this work to the exceeding
greatness of the power of God: and this must needs be, if we consider, how the
Spirit of God expresses it in Scripture by a new Creation: (i. e.) a giving
being to something out of nothing, Ephesians. 2. 10. In this it differs from all the
effects of humane power, for man always works upon some pre-existent matter,
but here is no such matter: all that is in man, the Ab uno desuper principio
quod convenienter voluntati operatur dependent prima, secunda and tertia.
Quemadmodum minima pars ferri lapidis magnetis spiritu movetur, per multos
annulos ferreos extensi: ita etiam qui sunt virtute praediti, divino spiritu
attracti, cum prima mansione conjungantur, deinceps autem alii usque ad
postremam. Glem. Alexan. Strom. lib. 7.
subject of this work, is only a passive capacity or receptivity, but nothing
is found in him to contribute toward this work: this supernatural life is not,
nor can it be educed out of natural principles: this wholly transcends the
Sphere of all natural power: but of this more anon.

Thirdly, This also we may affirm of it, that this divine life is infused into
all the natural faculties and powers of the soul, not one exempted. 1 These. 5.
23. The whole soul and spirit is the recipient subject of it: and with respect
to this general infusion into all the faculties and powers of the soul, it is
called a new creature, a new man, having an integral perfection and fullness of
all its parts and members: it becomes light in the mind, Joh. 17. 3. obedience
in the will, 1 Pet. 1. 2. in the affections an heavenly temper and tenderness,
Col. 3. 1, 2. and so is variously denominated, even as the Sea is from the
several shores it washes, though it be one and the same Sea. And here we must
observe lies one main difference betwixt a regenerate soul, and an hypocrite;
the one is all of a piece, as I may say, the principle of spiritual life runs
into all and every faculty and affection; and sanctifies or renews the whole
man: whereas the change upon hypocrites is but partial and particular, he may
have new light, but no new love, a new tongue, but not a new heart: this or
that vice may be reformed, but the whole course of his life is not altered.

Fourthly, and lastly, This infusion of spiritual life is done instantaneously,
as all Creation work is: hence it is resembled to that plastic power, which in
a moment made the light to shine out of darkness, just so does God shine into
our hearts, 2 Cor. 4. 6.

It Is true, a soul may be a long time under the preparatory works of the
Spirit, he may be under Convictions and humiliations, purposes and resolutions
a long time, he may be waiting at the pool of Bethesda, attending the means and
ordinances, but when the Spirit comes once to quicken the soul, it is done in a
moment: even as it is in the infusion of the rational soul, the body is long
ere it be prepared and molded, but when once the Embryo or matter is ready,
it is quickened with the Spirit of life in an instant: so it is here: but O what
a blessed moment is this! upon which the whole weight of our eternal happiness
depends; for it is Christ in us, (i. e.) Christ formed in us, who is the hope
of glory, Col. 1. 27. and our Lord expressly tells us, Joh. 3. 3. that except
we be regenerate and born again, we cannot see the Kingdom of God. And thus of
the way and manner of its infusion.

Thirdly, Let the design and end of God in this his quickening work be next
considered: for what end, and with what 3.
design and aim this work is wrought. And if we consult the Scriptures in this
matter, we shall find this principle of life is infused in order to our
glorifying God in this world by a life of obedience, and our enjoying of God in
the world to come.

First, Spiritual life is infused in Order to a course of obedience in this
world, whereby God is glorified: so we read in Ephesians. 2. 10. Created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in
them: habits are to actions, as the root is to the fruit, it is for fruit sake
that we plant the roots, and ingraff the branches. So in Ezekiel. 36. 27. a new
spirit also will I put within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye
shall keep my judgments and do them. This is the next or immediate design and
end not only of the first infusion of the principle of life into the Soul, but
of all the exciting, actuating and assisting works of the Spirit afterward.
Now this principle of spiritual life infused has a twofold influence into
obedience.

First, This makes it sincere and true obedience, when it flows from an inward
vital principle of grace. The Hypocrite is moved by something ab extra, from
without, as the applause of men, the accommodation of fleshly interests, the
force of education, or if there be any thing from within that moves him, it is
but a self-interest, to quiet a grumbling Conscience, and support his vain
hopes of heaven: but he never acts from a new principle, a new nature inclining
him to holy actions. Sincerity mainly lies in the harmony and correspondency of
actions to their principles: from this infused principle it is, that men hunger
and thirst for God, and go to their Duties, as men do to their meals, when they
find an empty craving stomach.

O Reader, pause a little upon this ere thou pass on, ask thy heart whether it
be so with thee: are holy duties connatural to thee? does thy soul move and
work after God by a kind of supernatural instinct? this then will be to thee a
good evidence of thy integrity.

Secondly, From this infused principle of life, results the Excellency of our
obedience, as well as the sincerity of it: for by virtue and reason thereof, it
becomes free and voluntary, not forced and constrained, it drops like honey of
its own accord out of the Comb, Cant. 4. 11. without squeezing: or as waters
from the fountain without forcing, Joh. 4. 14. An unprincipled professor must
be squeezed by some weight of affliction, ere he will yield one tear, or pour
out a prayer, Psalm. 78. 34. when he slew them, then they sought him.

Now the freedom of obedience is the excellency of it, Gods eye is much upon
that, 1 Cor. 9. 17. yea, and the uniformity of our obedience, which is also a
special part of the beauty of it, results from hence: he that acts from a
principle acts ^uently and uniformly, there is a proportion betwixt the parts
of his Conversation: this is it which makes us holy (...), in all manner of
Conversation, or in every creek and turning of our Conversations, as that word
imports, 1 Pet. 1. 15. whereas, he that is moved by this or that
external-accidental motive must needs be up and down, off and on, very uneven,
like the legs of a lame man, as the expression is, Prove. 26. 7. which are not
equal: now a word of God, and then the discourse runs muddy and profane, or
carnal again: all that evenness and uniformity that is in the several parts of
a Christians life, is the effect of this infused principle of spiritual life.

Thirdly, Another aim and design of God in the infusion of this principle of
life, is thereby to prepare and qualify the soul for the enjoyment of himself
in heaven: except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God, Joh. 3.
3. all that shall possess that inheritance must be begotten again to it, as the
Apostle speaks 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4. this principle of grace is the very seed of that
glory, it is eternal life in the root and principle, Joh. 17. 3. by this the
soul is attempered and qualified for that state and employment: what is the
life of glory, but the vision of God, and the souls assimilation to God by that
vision? from both which results that unspeakable joy and delight which passes
understanding: but what vision of God, assimilation to God; or delight in God
can that soul have, which was never quickened with the supernatural principle
of grace? The temper of such souls is expressed in that sad Character, Zech.
11. 8. my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me: for want of this
vital principle it is that the very same duties and ordinances which are the
delights and highest pleasures of the Saints, are no better than a mere
drudgery and bondage to others, Man 1. 13. heaven would be no heaven to a dead
soul; this principle of life in its daily growth and improvement is our
meetness as well as our evidence for heaven: these are the main ends of its
infusion.

Fourthly, In the next place according to the method proposed I am obliged to
show you, that this quickening work is 4.
wholly supernatural, it is the sole and proper work of the Spirit of God. So
Christ himself expressly asserts it in Joh. 3. 6, 8. That which is born of the
flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit: the wind
blows where it lists, and thou hear the sound thereof, but can not
tell whence it comes nor whither it goes, so is every one that is born of the
Spirit.

Believers are the birth or offspring of the Spirit, who produces the new
creature in them in an unintelligible manner even to themselves. So far it is
above their own ability to produce, that it is above their capacity to
understand the way of its production: as if you should ask, do you know from
whence the wind comes? no: do you know whither it goes? no, but you hear and
feel it when it blows? yes, why so is every one that is born of the Spirit: he
feels the efficacy and discerns the effects of the Spirit on his own soul, but
cannot understand or describe the manner of its production: this is not only
above the carnal, but above the renewed mind to comprehend; we can contribute
nothing, I mean actively, to the production of this principle of life: we may
indeed be said to concur passively with the Spirit in it: that is, there is
found in us a capacity, aptness, or receptiveness of this principle of life:
our nature is endowed with such faculties and powers as are meet subjects to
receive, and instruments to act this spiritual life: God only quickens the
rational nature with spiritual life.

It is true also, that in the progress of Sanctification a man does actively
concur with the Spirit, but in the first production of this spiritual
principle he can do nothing: he can indeed perform those external duties that
have a remote tendency to it, but he cannot by the power of nature perform any
saving act, or contribute any thing more than a passive capacity to the
implantation of a new principle: as will appear by the following Arguments.

Argument 1.
He that actively concurrs to his own regeneration, makes himself to differ;
but this is denied to all regenerate men, 1 Cor. 4. 7. who makes thee to
differ from another? and what have thou that thou did not receive?

Arg. 2.
That to which the Scripture ascribes both impotency and enmity with respect to
grace, cannot actively and of it self concur to the production of it: But the
Scripture ascribes both impotency and enmity to Nature with respect to grace.
It denies to it a power to do anything of it self, Joh. 15. 5. and which is
less, it denies to it power to speak a good word, Matthew. 12. 34. and which is
least of all, it denies it power to think a good thought, 2 Cor. 3. 5. This
impotency if there were no more, cuts off all pretense of our active
concurrence, but then if we consider that it ascribes enmity to our natures as
well as impotency, how clear is the case! see Romans 8. 7. the carnal mind is
enmity against God: and Col. 1. 21. and you that were enemies in your minds by
wicked works. So then Nature is so far productive of this principle, as
impotency and enmity can enable it to be so.

Arg. 3.
That which is of natural production, must needs be subject to natural
dissolution, that which is born of the flesh, is flesh, a perishing thing, sor
everything is as its principle is, and there can be no more in the effect, than
there is in the cause: but this principle of spiritual life is not subject to
dissolution, it is the water that springs up into everlasting life, Joh. 4. 14.
the seed of God which remains in the regenerate soul, 1 John 3. 9. and all
this because it is born not of corruptible, but of incorruptible seed, 1 Pet. 1.
23.

Arg. 4.
If our new birth be our resurrection, a new creation, yea, a victory over
nature, then we cannot actively contribute to its production; but under all
these notions it is represented to us in the Scriptures. It Is our resurrection
from the dead, Ephesians. 5. 14. and you know the body is wholly passive in its
resurrection: but though it concurrs not, yet it gives preexistent matter:
therefore the metaphor is designedly varied, Ephesians. 4. 24. where it is called a
creation: in which there is neither active concurrence, nor pre-existent
matter: but though Creation excludes pre-existent matter, yet in pro^cing
something out of nothing there is no reluctance nor opposition; therefore to
show how purely supernatural this principle of life is, it is clothed and
presented to us in the notion of a victory, 2 Cor. 10. 4. and so leaves all to
grace.

Arg. 5.
If nature could produce, or but actively concur to the production of this
spiritual life, then the best natures would be soonest quickened with it; and
the worst natures not at all, or last and least of all: but contrarily we find
the worst natures often regenerated, and the best left in the state of
spiritual death: with how many sweet homilitical virtues was the young man
adorned? Mark 10. 21. yet graceless: and what a sink of sin was Mary Magdalen,
Luke 7. 37. yet sanctified: thus beautiful Rachel is barren, whilst blear-eyed
Leah bears children. And there is scarce any thing that affects and melts the
hearts of Christians more than this comparative consideration does: when they
consider vessels of Gold cast away, and leaden ones chosen for such noble uses.
So that it is plain enough to all wise and humble souls, that this new life is
wholly of supernatural production.

Fifthly, and lastly, I shall briefly represent the necessary antecedency of
this quickening work of the Spirit to our first closing with Christ by faith:
and this will easily let it self into your understandings if you but consider
the nature of the vital act of faith: which is the souls receiving of Christ
and resting upon him for pardon and salvation, in which two things are
necessarily included, viz.

1. The renouncing of all other hopes and dependencies. 2. The opening the
heart fully to Jesus Christ.
First, The renouncing of all other hopes and dependencies whatsoever. Self in
all its acceptations, natural, sinful, and moral, is now to be denied and
renounced for ever, else Christ can never be received, Romans 10. 3. not only
self in its vilest pollutions, but self in its richest ornaments, and
endowments: but this is as impossible to the unrenewed natural man, as it is
for rocks or mountains to start from their Center, and fly like wandering
Atoms in the air: nature will rather choose to run the hazard of everlasting
damnation, than escape it by a total renunciation of its beloved lusts, or
selfrighteousness: this supernatural work necessarily requires a supernatural
principle, Romans 8. 2.

Secondly, The opening the heart fully to Jesus Christ, without which Christ
can never be received, Rev. 3. 20. but 2.
this also is the effect of the quickening Spirit, the Spirit of life which is
in Christ Jesus: sooner may we expect to see the flowers and blossoms open
without the influence of the Sun, than the heart and will of a sinner open to
receive Christ, without a principle of spiritual life first derived from him:
and this will be past doubt to all that consider, not only the impotence of
nature, but the ignorance, prejudice, and aversations of nature by which the
door of the heart is barred and chained up against Christ, Joh. 5. 40. so that
nature has neither ability nor will, power or desire to come to Christ; if any
have an heart opened to receive him, it is the Lord that opens it, by his
almighty power; and that in the way of an infused principle of life
supernatural.

But here it may be doubted, and objected, against this position, Quest.
If we cannot believe till we are quickened with spiritual life, as you say,
and cannot be justified till we belive, as all say; then it will follow that a
regenerate soul may be in the state of condemnation for a time, and
consequently perish if death should befall him in that juncture.

To this I return, that when we speak of the priority of Sol.
this quickening work of the Spirit to our actual believing, we rather
understand it of the priority of nature, than of time: the nature and order of
the work requiring it to be so: a vital principle must in order of nature be
infused before a vital act can be exerted. First make the tree good, and then
the fruit good: and admit we should grant some priority in time also to this
quickening principle, before actual faith, yet the absurdity mentioned would be
no way consequent upon that concession: for as the vital act of faith quickly
follows the regenerating principle, so the soul is abundantly secured against
the danger objected; God never beginning any special work of grace upon the
soul, and then leaving it and the soul with it in hazard, but preserves both
to the finishing and completing of his gracious design, Phil. 1. 6.

First Use of Information.
Infer. 1.
If such be the nature and necessity of this principle of divine Infer. 1.
life, as you have heard it opened in the foregoing discourse, then hence it
follows, That unregenerate men are no better than dead men. So the Text
represents them, you has he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins:
(i. e.) spiritually dead though naturally alive, yea and lively too as any
other persons in the world. There is a threefold consideration of objects,

Viz. 1. Naturally. 2. Politically. 3. Theologically.

First, Naturally, to all those things that are natural, they are alive: they
can understand, reason, discourse, preject and contrive as well as others, they
can eat, drink, build, plant, and suck out the natural comfort of these things
as much as any others. So their life is described, Job 21. 12. They take the
Timbrel and Harp, and rejoice at the sound of the Organ: they spend their ^ays
in Wealth, etc. and James 5. 5. ye have lived in pleasure upon earth, as the
fish lives in the water its natural element, and yet ^is natural sensual life
is not allowed the name of life, 1 Timothy 5. 6. such persons are dead whilst they
live: it is a base and ignoble life, to have a soul only to salt the body, or to
enable a man for a few years to eat, and drink, and talk, and laugh, and then
dye.

Secondly, Objects may be considered Politically, and with respect to such
things they are alive also: they can buy and sell, and manage all their worldly
affairs with as much dexterity, skill, and policy as other men, yea, the
children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of
light, Luke 16. 8. The entire stream of their thoughts, projects and studies
running in that one Channel: having but one Liberet me deus, ab homine unius
tantum negotii. Bern.
design to manage, they must needs excel in worldly wisdom: but then

Thirdly, Theologically considered, they are dead; without life, sense or
motion toward God, and the things that are above: their understandings are
dead, 1 Cor. 2. 14. and cannot receive the things that are of God: their wills
are dead, and cannot move toward Jesus Christ, Joh. 6. 65. their affections
are dead, even to the most excellent and spiritual objects: and all their
duties are dead duties, without life or spirit. This is the sad case of the
unregenerate world.

Infer. 2.
This speaks encouragement to Ministers and parents to wait in hopes of success
at last, even upon those that yet give them Infer. 2.
little hope of conversion at the present: the work you see is the Lords, when
the Spirit of life comes upon their dead souls, they shall believe, and be made
willing; till then, we do but plough upon the rocks: yet let not our hand slack
in duty, pray for them and plead with them; you know not in which prayer or
exhortation the Spirit of life may breathe upon them: can these dry bones live?
yes, if the Spirit of life from God breathe upon them, they can, and shall
live: what though their dispositions be averse to all things that are spiritual
and serious? yet even such have been regenerated, when more sweet and promising
natures have been passed by and left under spiritual death.

It was the observation of Mr. Ward upon his Brother Mr. Daniel Rogers, (who
was a man of great gifts and eminent graces, yet of a very bad temper and
constitution) Though my Brother Rogers (said he) have grace enough for two men,
yet not half enough for himself.

It may be you have prayed and striven long with your relations and to little
purpose, yet be not discouraged. How often was Mr. John Rogers that famous
successful Divine, a grief of heart to his relations in his younger years,
proving a wild and lewd young man to the great discouragement of his pious
friends; yet at last, the Lord graciously changed him, so that Mr. Richard
Rogers would say, when he would exercise the utmost degree of charity or hope
for any that at present were vile and naught, I will never despair of any man
for John Rogers sake.

Infer. 3.
How honorable are Christians by their new birth! they are born not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of Infer. 3.
man, but of God, Joh. 1. 13. (i. e.) not in an impure, or mere natural way,
but in a most spiritual and supernatural manner: they are the offspring of
God, the children of the most high, as well by regeneration as by adoption:
which is the greatest advancement of the humane nature next to its hypostatical
union with the second person: Oh what honor is this for a poor sinful creature
to have the very life of God breathed into his soul! all other dignities of
nature are trifles compared with this: this makes a Christian a sacred hallowed
thing, the living temple of God, 1 Cor. 6. 19. the special object of his
delight.

Infer. 4.
How deplorable is the condition of the unregenerate world, in no better case
than dead men! Now to affect our hearts with the Infer. 4.
misery of such a condition, let ut consider and compare it in the following
particulars.

First, There is no beauty in the dead, all their loveliness goes away at
death; there is no spiritual beauty or loveliness in any that are unregenerate:
it is true, many of them have excellent moral homilitical virtues, which adorn
their conversations in the eyes of men; but what are all these, but so many
sweet flowers strewed over a dead Corpse?

Secondly, The dead have no pleasure nor delight: even so the unregenerate are
incapable of the delights of the Christian life: to be spiritually minded is
life and peace, Romans 8. 6. (i. e.) this is the only serene, placid, and
pleasant life: when the prodigal who was once dead, was alive, then he began to
be merry, Luke. 15. 24. they live in sensual pleasures, but this is to be dead
while alive in Scripture reckoning.

Thirdly, The dead have no heat, they are as cold as clay: so are all the
unregenerate toward God and things above: their lusts are hot, but their
affections to God cold and frozen: that which makes a gracious heart melt, will
not make an unregenerate heart move.

Fourthly, The dead must be buried, Genesis 23. 4. bury my dead out of my sight:
so must the unregenerate be buried out of Gods sight forever: buried in the
lowest hell, in the place of darkness for ever, Joh. 3. 3. Woe to the
unregenerate, good had it been sor them they had never been born.

Infer. 5.
How greatly are all men concerned to examine their condition Infer. 5.
with respect to spiritual life and death! It Is very common for men to presume
upon their Union with and interest in Christ: this privilege is by common
mistake extended generally to all that profess Christian religion, and practice
the external duties of it, when in truth no more are or can be united
Praesumendo sperant, and sperando pereunt. Ames.
to Christ than are quickened by the Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus,
Romans 8. 1, 2. O try your interest in Christ by this rule, if I am quickened by
Christ, I have Union with Christ. And

First, If there be spiritual sense in your souls, there is spiritual life in
them: there are (...) senses belonging to the spiritual, as well as to the
animal life, Heb. 5. 14. they can feel and sensibly groan under soul pressures,
and burdens of sin, Romans 7. 24. the dead feel not, moan not under the burdens
of sin, but the living do: they may be sensible indeed of the evil of sin with
respect to themselves, but not as against God, damnation may scare them, but
pollution does not; hell may fright them, but not the offense of God.

Secondly, If there be spiritual hunger and thirst, it is a sweet sign of
spiritual life; this sign agrees to Christians of a day old, 1 Pet. 2. 2. even
new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word: if spiritual life be in
you, you know how to expound that Scripture, Psalm. 42. 1. without any other
interpreter than your own experience: you will feel somewhat like the g^awing
of an empty stomach, making you restless during the interruption of your daily
communion with the Lord.

Thirdly, If there be spiritual conflicts with sin, there is spiritual life in
your soul, Gal. 5. 17. not only a combat betwixt light in the higher, and lust
in the lower faculties: nor only opposition to more gross external corruptions
that carry more infamy and horror with them than other sins do: but the same
faculty will be the seat of War; and the more inward, secret and spiritual any
lust is, by so much the more will it be opposed and mourned over.

In a word, the weakest Christian may upon impartial observation find such
signs of spiritual life in himself (if he will allow himself time to reflect
upon the bent and frame of his own heart) as desires after God, conscience of
duties, fears, cares, and sorrows about sin: delight in the society of heavenly
and spiritual men, a loathing and burden in the company of vain and carnal
persons.

O but I have a very dead heart to spiritual things.

The Sixth SERMON. Sermon. 6.

JOH. 1. 12. Describing that Act on our part by which we do actually and
effectually apply Christ to our own souls.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God;
even to them that believe on his name.
NO sooner is the soul quickened by the Spirit of God, but it answers in some
measure the end of God in that work, by its active reception of Jesus Christ,
in the way of believing: what this vital act of faith is, upon which so great a
weight depends, as our Interest in Christ and everlasting blessedness, this
Scripture before us will give you the best account of it: wherein (omitting the
Coherence and contexture of the words) we have three things to ponder.

First, The high and glorious privilege conferred, viz. power to become the
sons of God.

Secondly, The subject of this privilege described, As many as received him.

Thirdly, The description explained by way of Apposition, even as many as
believed on his name.

First, The privilege conferred is a very high and glorious 1.
one, than which no created being is capable of greater: power Beza, hoc jus:
Piscator, hanc dignitatem: Lightfoote, prarogativam. Heinsius, privilegium: nec
multo aliter v^ce (...) Hellenistae us^ videntur cum C^aldeorum (...)
expresserunt. Heins.
to become the sons of God: this word (...) is of large extent and
signification, and is by some rendered this right, by others this dignity, by
others this prerogative. This privilege or honor: it implys a title or right
to Adoption, not only with respect to the present benefits of it in this life,
but also to that blessed inheritance which is laid up in heaven for the sons of
God: and so Grotius rightly expounds it of our consummate sonship, consisting
in the actual enjoyment of blessedness, as well as that which is inchoate: not
only a right to pardon, favor and acceptance now, but to heaven, and the full
enjoyment of God hereafter. O what an honor, dignity, and privilege is this!

Secondly, The Subjects of this privilege are described: as many as received
him. This Text describes them by that 2.
very grace, Faith, which gives them their title and right to Christ and his
benefits; and by that very act of faith which primarily conferrs their right to
his person, and secondarily to his benefits, viz. receiving him: there be many
graces besides faith, but faith only is the grace that gives us right to
Christ: and there be many acts of faith besides receiving, but this receiving
or embracing of Christ is the justifying and saving act: as many as received
him, (...)] as many, be they of any nation, sex, age, or condition. For there
is neither Greek, nor Jew, Circumcision, nor Uncircumcision, Barbarian,
Scythian, Bond or Free: but Christ is all, and in all. Col. 3. 11.

Nothing but unbelief bars men from Christ and his benefits: as many as
received him] the word signifies to accept, take, or (as we fitly render) to
receive, assume or take to (...) and (...) idem est. Grot.
us, a word most aptly expressing the nature and office of faith, yea the very
justifying and saving act: and we are also heedfully to note its special
object, (...) him, the Text says not (...) his, but (...) him (i. e.) his
person, as he is clothed with his offices, and not only his benefits and
privileges. These are secondary and consequential things to our receiving him.
Oblatio est actio Dei, plerunque mediata facta in verbo; receptio est actio.
hominis, ita tamen ut simul quoque sit beneficium d^; nec enim homo posset
recipere mediatorem nisi fides, quae receptionis hujus est organon, (...) deo
daretur. Wendel.
So that it is a receiving, assuming or accepting the Lord Jesus Christ, which
must have respect to the tenders and proposals of the gospel, for therein is
the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, Romans 1. 17. therein is
Jesus Christ revealed, proposed, and offered unto sinners as the only way of
justification and salvation, which Gospel offer (as before was opened) is
therefore ordinarily necessary to believing, Romans 10. 11, 12, 13, etc.

Thirdly, This description is yet further explained, by this additional
exegetical clause, even to them that believe in his 3.
name] here the terms are varied, though the thing expressed in both be the same:
what he called receiving there, is called believing on his name here, to show
us that the very essence of saving faith consists in our receiving of Christ:
by his name, we are to understand Christ himself: it is usual to take these
two, believing in him, and believing in his name, as terms convertible and of
the same importance. (...) ipse est nomen suum, and nomen ejus ipse est: his
name Drusius.
is himself and himself is his name. So that here we have the true nature, and
precious benefits of saving faith excellently expressed in this Scripture: the
sum of which take in this proposition.

Doct.
That the receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ, is that saving and vital act of
faith, which gives the soul right both to his person and Doct.
benefits.

We cannot act spiritually, till we begin to live spiritually: therefore the
Spirit of life must first join himself to us in his quickening work, (as was
shown you in the last Sermon) which being done, we begin to act spiritually by
taking hold upon, or receiving Jesus Christ, which is the thing designed to be
opened in this Sermon.

The soul is the life of the body, faith is the life of the soul, and Christ is
the life of faith. There are several sorts of faith besides saving faith, and
in saving faith there are several acts besides the justifying or saving act;
but this receiving act which is to be our subject this day, is that upon which
both our righteousness and eternal happiness do depend. This as a form
differences saving faith from all other kinds or sorts of faith: by this it is
that we are justified and saved. To as many as received him, to them gave he
power to become the sons of God: Forma vel aliquid formae analogum ponitur
differentiae loco.
yet it does not justify and save us by reason of any proper dignity that is
found in this Act, but by reason of the object it receives and apprehends: the
same thing is often expressed in Scripture by other terms, as coming to Christ,
Joh. 6. 35. rolling or staying upon Christ, Isa. 50. 10. but whatever is found
in those expressions it is all comprehended in this, as will appear hereafter.
Now, the method into which I shall cast the discourse of this subject, that I
may handle it with as much perspicuity and profit as I can, shall be

First, To explain and open the nature of this receiving of Christ and show you
what it includes. 1.


Secondly, To prove that this is the justifying and saving act of faith. 2.


Thirdly, To show you the excellency of this act of Faith. 3.


Fourthly, To remove some mistakes, and give you the true account of the
dignity and excellency of this act. 4.


Fifthly, And then bring home all in a proper and close application. 5.


First, In the first place then, I will endeavor to explain (1.) There are
diverse other expressions by which the nature of saving faith is expressed in
Scripture, viz. eating Christ's flesh, and drinking his blood, Joh. 6. 40.
coming to Christ, Mat. 11. 28. Having the son, 1 John 5. 12. Trusting or
depending upon him, for which the Hebrew use th^ee emphatical wo^ds, (...) The
first signifies a firm and stable trust. The second to lean or depend with
security. The third to betake ones self to a sanctuary for protection: all
which is supposed or included in our receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ: in
eating and drinking we must receive meat and drink, coming to Christ is
necessarily supposed in receiving him, for there is no receiving at a distance:
Having the son, and receiving him are notions of the same importance; and for
trusting, relying with security, and betaking our selves to Christ for refuge,
they are all involved in the receiving act: for as God offers him to us as the
only prop of our hearts and hopes, so we receive hi^ o rely upon him: and as he
is held forth in the Gospel as the only Asylum or City of refuge, so we take or
receive him, and accordingly betake our souls to him for refuge.
and open the nature of this receiving of Christ, and show you what is employed
in it.

And indeed it involves many deep mysteries and things of greatest weight:
people are generally very ignorant and unacquainted with the importance of this
expression, they have very slight thoughts of faith, who never past under the
illuminating, convincing and humbling work of the Spirit: but we shall find
that saving faith is quite another thing, and differs in its whole kind and
nature from that tra^itional faith, and common assent, which is so fatally
mistaken for it in the world.

For First, It is evident, that no man can receive Jesus Christ in the darkness
of natural ignorance: we must understand and discern who and what he is, whom
we receive to be the Lord our righteousness. If we know not his person and his
offices, we do not take, but mistake Christ. It Is a good rule in the Civil Law,
non consentit qui non sentit: a mistake of the person invalidates the match: ^e
that takes Christ for a mere man, or denis the satisfaction of his blood, or
devests him of his humane nature, or denis any of his most glorious and
necessary offices, let them cry up as high as they will, his spirituality,
glory, and exemplary life and death; they can never receive Jesus Christ
aright: this is such a crack, such a flaw in the very foundation of faith, as
undoes and destroys all: ignorantis non est consensus: all saving faith is
founded in light and knowledge: and therefore it is called knowledge, Isa. 53.
11. and seeing is inseparably connected with believing, Joh. 6. 40. men must
hear and learn of the father before they can come to Christ, Joh. 6. 45. the
receiving act of faith is directed and guided by knowledge. I will not presume
to state the degree of knowledge, which is absolutely necessary to the
reception of Christ, I know the first of actings faith are in most Christians
accompanied with much darkness and confusion of understanding: but yet we must
say in the general, that where ever faith is, there is so much light as is
sufficient to discover to the soul, its own sins, dangers, and wants; and the
all sufficiency, suitableness, and necessity of Christ for the supply and
remedy of all; and without this Christ cannot be received. Come unto me ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, Mat. 11. 28.

Secondly, The receiving Christ necessarily implies the Assent of the
understanding to the truths of Christ revealed in the Gospel, viz. his person,
natures, offices, his incarnation, death and satisfaction; which assent, though
it be not in it self saving faith, yet is it the foundation and groundwork of
it: it being impossible the soul should receive and fiducially embrace, what
the mind does not assent unto as true and infallibly certain. Now there are
three degrees of assent, Vide Dr. Sclater in Romans 4. 3.
conjecture, opinion, and belief. Conjecture is but a slight, and weak
inclination to assent to the thing propounded, by reason of the weighty
objections that lie against it. Opinion is a more steady and fixed assent, when
a man is almost certain, though yet some fear of the contrary remains with him.
Belief is a more full and assured assent to the truth, to which the mind may be
brought four ways.

First, By the perfect intelligence of sense, not hindered or deceived. So I
believe the truth of these propositions, Fire is hot: water moist: honey is
sweet: gall is bitter.

Secondly, By the native clearness of self-evidencing principles. So I believe
the truth of these propositions, The whole is more than a part: the cause is
before the effect.

Thirdly, By discourse, and rational deduction* So I believe the truth of this
proposition, Where all the parts of a thing are, there is the whole.

Fourthly, By infallible Testimony, when any thing is witnessed or asserted, by
one whose truth is unquestionable: and of this sort is the assent of faith:
which is therefore Nec enim decebat ut cum deus ad homines loqueretur
argumentis assereret suas voces, tanquam aliter fides ei non haberetur: sed ut
oportuit est locutus, quasi rerum omnium maximus judex, cujus est non
argumentari, sed pronunciare verum, etc. Lactantius de falsa religione p.
(mihi) 179. Titubat fides ubi vacillat divinarum Scripturarum autoritas. Aug.
called our receiving the witness of God, 1 John 5. 9. our setting to our Seal
that God is true, Joh. 3. 33. This prima veritas, divine veracity is the very
formal object of faith: into this we resolve our faith. Thus says the Lord, is
that firm foundation upon which our assent is built: and thus we see good
reason to believe those profound mysteries of the incarnation of Christ, the
Hypostatical Union of the two natures in his wonderful person, the mystical
Union of Christ and believers, though we cannot understand these things by
reason of the darkness of our minds. It satisfies the soul to find these
mysteries in the written word, upon that foundation it firmly builds its
assent: and without such an assent of faith, there can be no embracing of
Christ: all acts of faith and religion without assent, are but as so many
Arrows shot at random into the open air, they signify nothing for want of a
fixed determinate object.

It is theresore the policy of Satan, by injecting or fomenting Atheistical
thoughts (with which young Converts use to find themselves greatly infested) to
undermine and destroy the whole work of faith: but God makes his people
victorious over them: yea, and even at that time they do assent to the truths
of the word, when they think they do not: as appears by their tenderness and
fear of sin, their diligence and care of duty: If I discern these things in a
Christians life, he must excuse me if I believe him not, when he says he does
not assent to the truths of the Gospel.

Thirdly, our receiving Christ necessarily implies our hearty approbation,
liking, and estimation, yea, the acquiescence of our very souls in Jesus
Christ, as the most excellent, suitable and complete remedy for all our wants,
sins and dangers that ever could be prepared by the wisdom and love of God for
them: we must receive him with such a frame of heart as rests upon him, trusts
to and relys upon him, if ever we receive him aright: to them that believe he
is precious, 1 Pet. 2. 7. this is the only sovereign plaster in all the world
that is large enough, and efficacious enough to cure our wounds: and therefore
as Christ is most highly esteemed, and heartily approved as the only remedy for
our souls, so the sovereign grace and wisdom of God are admired, and the way
and method he has taken to save poor lost souls by Jesus Christ most heartily
approved; as the most apt and excellent method, both for his glory and our
good, that ever could be taken: for it is a plain case, that none will espouse
themselves with conjugal affections to that person whom they esteem not as the
best for them that can be chosen: none will forsake and quit all for his sake,
except they account him as the spouse did, the chiefest of ten thousand, Cant.
5. 10.

There are two things in Christ which must gain the greatest approbation in the
soul of a poor convinced sinner, and bring it to rest upon Jesus Christ.

First, That it can find nothing in Christ that is distastful or unsuitable to
it, as it does experimentally find in the best creatures. In him is no weakness
but a fullness of all saving abilities; able to save to the uttermost: no Pride
causing him to scorn and contemn the most wretched soul that comes to him: no
inconstancy or levity, to cause him to cast off the soul whom he has once
received: no passion, but a Lamb for meekness and patience: there is not a spot
to be found in him, but he is altogether lovely, Cant. 5. 16.

Secondly, As the believer can find nothing in Christ that is distastful, so it
finds nothing wanting in Christ that is necessary or desirable: such is the
fullness of wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption that is in
Christ, that nothing is left to desire, but the full enjoyment of him. O says
the soul, how completely happy shall I be, if I can but win Christ! I would not
envy the Nobles of the earth, were I but in Christ. I am an hungry and a
thirst, and Christ is meat indeed, and drink indeed; this is the best thing in
all the world for me, because so necessary, and so suitable to the needs of a
soul ready to perish. I am a law-condemned, and a self-condemned sinner;
trembling for fear of the execution of the curse upon me every moment; in
Christ is complete righteousness to justify my soul; O there is nothing better
for me than Christ. I see my self plunged both in nature and practice into the
odious pollutions of sin, and in Christ is a fountain opened for sin and for
uncleanness: his blood is a fountain of merit, his spirit a fountain of
holiness and purity: none but Christ, none but Christ. O the manifold wisdom
and unsearchable love of God to prepare, and furnish such a Christ, so fully
answering all the needs, all the distresses, all the fears and burdens of a
poor sinner! Thus the believing soul approves of Christ as best for it. And
thus in believing it gives glory to God, Romans 4. 20.

Fourthly, Receiving Christ consists in the consent and choice of the will: and
this is the opening of the heart, the opening and stretching forth of the soul
to receive him: thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, Psalm. 110.
3.

It Is the great design and main scope of the Gospel to work over the wills of
poor sinners to this: and this was the great complaint of Christ against the
incredulous Jews, Joh. 5. 40. ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.

It is disputed by some whether faith can be seated in two distinct faculties,
as we seem to place it, when we say it involves both the approbation of the
judgment, and the consent of the will. I will not here entangle my discourse
with that fruitless dispute. I am of the same judgment with those Divines that
think Faith cannot be expressed fully by any one single habit or act of the
mind or will distinctly, for that (as one well notes) there are such
descriptions given of it in Scripture, Dr. Owen in his Doctrine of
Justification, p. 135. Consensus denotare videtur concursum voluntatis cum
intellectu, ad sentiendum idem quod intellectus sentit. 12 Q. 15. a. 1. Fides
non est virtus simplex, sed diversis constat partibus, notitia, assensu, and
fiducia, quae ad eandem potentiam non pertinent. Wendelini Theol. p. 450.
such things are proposed as the object of it; and such is the experience of
all that sincerely believe; as no one single act either of the mind or will can
answer unto: nor do I see any thing repugnant to Scripture or Philosophy, if we
place it in both faculties. Consent (says Vasquez) seems to denote the
concourse of the will with the understanding: but to leave that, it is most
certain, the saving justifying act of faith lies principally in the consent of
the will, which consent is the effect of the almighty power of God, Ephesians. 1. 19.
he allures and draws the will to Christ, and he draws with the cords of a man,
(i. e.) he prevails with it by rational Arguments: for the soul being prepared
by convictions of its lost and miserable estate by sin, and that there is but
one door of hope open to it for an escape from the wrath to come, and that is
Christ: being also satisfied of the fullness and compleatness of his saving
ability, and of his willingness to make it over for our salvation upon such
just and equal terms; this cannot but prevail with the will of a poor
distressed sinner, to consent and choose him.

Fifthly, and Lastly, The last and principal thing included in our receiving of
Christ, is the respect that this act of acceptance has, unto the terms upon
which Christ is tendered to us in the Gospel, to which it is most agreeable, 1
Cor. 15. 11. so we preach, and so ye believed: faith answers the Gospel offer
Romans 6. 17. (...). The will like melted metal is delivered into the Gospel
mould, where it receives the same form and figure that the mould gives.
as the impress upon the wax does the engravings in the Seal: and this is of
principal consideration, for there is no receiving Christ upon any other terms
but his own, proposed in the Gospel to us: he will never come lower, nor make
them easier than they are, for any man's sake in the world: we must either
receive him upon these, or part with him for ever as thousands do, who could be
content to agree to some Articles, but rather choose to be damned for ever,
than submit to all: this is the great controversy betwixt Christ and sinners:
upon this many thousands break off the Treaty, and part with Christ; because he
will not come to their terms: but every true believer receives him upon his
own, (i. e.) their acceptance of him by faith is in all things consentaneous to
the overtures made of him in the written word. So he tenders himself, and so
they receive him; as will be evident in the following particulars.

First, The Gospel offers Christ to us sincerely and really, and so the true
believer receives and accepts him: even with 1.
a faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1. 5. If ever the soul be serious and in earnest in
any thing, it it so in this: can we suppose the heart of him that flys for his
life to the refuge City, to be serious and in earnest to escape by flight the
Avenger of blood who pursues him, then is the heart of a convinced sinner
serious in this matter; for under that notion is the work of faith presented to
us, Heb. 6. 18.

Secondly, Christ is offered to us in the Gospel entirely and undividedly, as
clothed with all his offices, Priestly, Prophetical, 2.
and Regal: as Christ Jesus the Lord, Acts 16. 31. and so the true believer
receives him: the hypocrite like the harlot is for dividing, but the sincere
believer finds the need he has of every office of Christ, and knows not how to
want any thing that is in him.

His ignorance makes him necessary and desirable to him, as a Prophet: His
guilt makes him necessary as a Priest: His strong and powerful Lusts and
Corruptions makes him necessary as a King: and in truth he sees not any thing
in Christ that he can spare; he needs all that is in Christ, and admires the
infinite wisdom in nothing more than the investing Christ with all these
offices, which are so suited to the poor sinners wants and miseries. Look as
the three offices are undivided in Christ, so they are in the believers
acceptance: and before this trial, no hypocrite can stand, for all hypocrites
reject and quarrel with something in Christ: they like his pardon, better than
his government: they call him indeed Lord and master, but it is but an empty
Tite they bestow upon him; for let them ask their own hearts, if Christ be Lord
over their thoughts, as well as words: over their secret, as well as open
actions: over their darling Lusts, as well as others: let them ask, who will
appear to be Lord and master over them, when Christ and the world come in
competition? when the pleasures of sin shall stand upon one side, and
sufferings to death, and deepest points of self-denial upon the other side?
Surely it is the greatest affront that can be offered to the divine wisdom and
goodness to separate in our acceptance, what is so united in Christ for our
salvation and happiness. As without any one of these offices the work of our
salvation could not be completed, so without acceptance of Christ in them all,
our Union with him by faith cannot be completed.

The Gospel offer of Christ includes all his offices, and Gospel faith just so
receives him, to submit to him, as well as to be redeemed by him: to imitate
him in the holiness of his life, as well as to reap the purchases and fruits of
his death. It must be an entire receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Thirdly, Christ is offered to us in the Gospel exclusively, 3.
as the alone and only savior of sinners; with whose blood A man may as
lawfully join Saints or Angels in his mediation with Christ, as graces. It is
gross idolatry to make the works of God a God: and it is but a more subtle
Idolatry to make the works of Christ a Christ. Burges de Lege.
and intercession nothing is to be mixed: but the foul of a sinner is singly to
rely and depend on him and no other. Acts 4. 2. 1 Cor. 3. 11. and so faith
receives him, Psalm. 71. 16. I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of
thine only. Phil. 3. 9. And be found in him not having my own righteousness
which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ: to depend
partly upon Christ's righteousness, and partly upon our own, is to set one foot
upon a rock, and the other in a quick-sand: either Christ will be to us all in
all, or nothing at all in point of righteousness and salvation: he affects not
social honor: as he did the whole work, so he expects the sole praise: if he
be not able to save to the uttermost, why do we depend upon him at all? and if
he be, why do we lean upon any beside him?

Fourthly, The Gospel offers Christ freely to sinners as the gift, not the sale
of God, Joh. 4. 10. Isa. 55. 1. Rev. 22. 17. and even so faith receives him.
The believer comes to Christ with an empty hand, not only as an undeserving,
but as an hell deserving sinner: he comes to Christ as to one that justifies
the ungodly, Romans 4. 5. Unto him that works not, but believes in him that
justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness: where by him
that works not, he means a convinced humbled sinner, who finds himself
utterly unable to do the task the Law sets him (i. e.) perfectly to obey it;
and therefore in a Law sense is said not to work: for it is all one as to the
intent and purpose of the Law not to work and not to work perfectly: this he is
convinced of, and therefore comes to Christ as one that is in himself ungodly,
acknowledging the righteousness by which he alone can stand before God; is in
Christ, and not in himself, in whole, or in part: and by the way, let this
encourage poor souls that are scared and daunted for want of due
qualifications, from closing with and embracing Christ: there is nothing
qualifies any man for Christ more than a sense of his unworthiness of him, and
the want of all excellencies or ornaments that may commend him to divine
acceptance.

Fifthly, The Gospel offers Christ orderly to sinners, first his person, then
his privileges. God first gives his son, and then 5.
with him, or as a consequent of that gift; he gives us all things, Romans 8. 32.
In the same order must our faith receive him. The believer does not marry the
portion first, and then the person: but to be found in him is the first and
great care of a believer.

I deny not but it is lawful for any to have an eye to the benefits of Christ.
Salvation from wrath is, and lawfully may be intended and aimed at: look unto
me, and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth, Isa. 45. 22. Nor do I deny but
there are many poor souls who being in deep distress and fear, may and often do
look mostly to their own safety at first; and that there is much confusion as
well in the actings of their faith, as in their condition; but sure I am it is
the proper order in believing, first to accept the person of the Lord Jesus:
heaven is no doubt very desirable, but Christ is more: whom have I in heaven
but thee? Psalm. 73. 25. Union with Christ is in order of nature antecedent to
the Communication of his privileges, therefore so it ought to be in the order
and method of believing.

Sixthly, Christ is Advisedly offered in the Gospel to sinners, as the result
of Gods eternal counsel, a project of grace upon which his heart and thoughts
have been much set, Zech. 6. 13. 6.
The counsel of peace was betwixt the Father and Son. And so the believer
receives him, most deliberately weighing the matter in his most deep and
serious thoughts: for this is a time of much solitude and thoughtfulness. The
souls espousals are acts of judgment, Hosea 2. 19. on our part, as well as on
Gods: we are therefore bid to sit down and count the cost, Luke 14. 28. Faith,
or the actual receiving of Christ is the result of many previous debates in the
soul: the matter has been pondered over and over: the objections and
discouragements both from the self-denying terms of the Gospel, and our own
vileness and deep guilt have been ruminated, and lain upon our hearts day and
night, and after all things have been balanced in the most deep consideration,
the soul is determined to this conclusion, I must have Christ be the terms
never so hard, be my sins never so great and many, I will yet go to him and
venture my soul upon him; if I perish I peri^h. I have thought out all my
thoughts, and this is the result, union with Christ here, or separation from
God for ever must be my lot.

And thus does the Lord open the hearts of his elect, and win the consent of
their wills to receive Jesus Christ upon the deepest consideration, and debate
of the matter in their own most solemn thoughts: they understand and know that
they must deeply deny themselves, take up his cross and follow him, Matthew. 16.
24. renounce not only sinsul but religious self; these are hard and difficult
things, but yet the necessity and excellency of Christ makes them appear
eligible, and rational: by all which you see faith is another thing than what
the sound of that word (as it is generally understood) signifies to the
understandings of most men. This is that fiducial receiving of Christ here to
be opened.

Secondly, Our next work will be to evince this receiving 2.
of Christ as it has been opened, to be that special saving faith of Gods
elect: this is that faith of which such great and glorious things are spoken in
the Gospel, which whosoever has shall be saved, and he that has it not shall
be damned: and this I shall evidently prove by the following Arguments or
reasons.

Arg. 1.
First, That faith which gives the soul right and title to spiritual Adoption,
with all the privileges and benefits thereof, Arg. 1.
is true saving Faith.

But such a receiving of Christ as has been described, gives the soul right
and title to spiritual Adoption, with all the privileges and benefits thereof.

Therefore such a receiving of Christ as has been described, is true and
saving faith.

The Major proposition is undeniable, for our right and title to spiritual
Adoption and the privileges thereof rises from our Union with Jesus Christ; we
being united to the son of God, are by virtue of that Union reckoned or
accounted sons. Gal. 3. 26. You are all the children of God by faith in Jesus
Christ: the effect of saving faith is union with Christ's person, the consequent
of that Union is Adoption, or right to the inheritance.

The Minor is most plain in the Text: To as many as received him, to them gave
he power or right to become the sons of God: a false faith has no such
privileges annexed to it: no unbeliever is thus dignified: no stranger
entitled to this inheritance.

Arg. 2.
Secondly, That only is saving and justifying faith, which is in all true
believers, in none but true believers; and in all Arg. 2.
true believers at all times.

But such a receiving of Christ as has been described, is in all true
believers, in none but true believers; and in all true believers at all times.

Therefore such a receiving of Christ as has been described, is the only
saving and justifying faith.

The Major is undeniable, that must needs contain the essence of saving faith
which is proper to every true believer, at all times, and to no other.

The Minor will be as clear, for there is no other act of faith, but this of
fiducial receiving Christ as he is offered, that does agree to all true
believers, to none but true believers; and to all true believers at all times.

There be three Acts of faith, Assent, Acceptance, and Assurance. The Papists
generally give the essence of saving faith Actus fidei consistit in ass^^, quo
quis assentitur alicui propositioni a deo revelatae, propter authoritatem
revelantis. Becan. Theol. Schol. Tom. 3. cap. 8. Q. 4.
to the first, viz. Assent. The Lutherans and some of our own give it to the
last, viz. Assurance: but it can neither be so, nor so. Assent does not agree
only to true believers or justified persons. Assurance agrees to justified
persons, and them only, but not to all justified persons, and that at all times.

Assent is too low to contain the essence of saving faith, it is found in the
unregenerate as well as the regenerate: yea, in devils as well as men, Jam. 2.
19. it is supposed and included in justifying faith, but it is not the
justifying or saving act. Assurance is as much too high: being found only in
some eminent believers; Many newborn Christians live like the newborn babe:
vivit and est vitae nescius ipse suae: the whole stock of many a believer
consists in the bare direct acts of faith.
and in them too, but at some times: there is many a true believer to whom the
joy and comfort of assurance is denied: they may say of their Union with
Christ, as Paul said of his vision; whether in the body, or out of the body I
cannot tell: so they, whether in Christ, or out of Christ they cannot tell.

A true believer may walk in darkness, and see no light, Isa. 50. 10. nay, a
man must be a believer, before he know himself to be so: the direct act of
faith is before the reflex act: so that the justifying act of faith lies
neither in Assent, nor in Assurance. Assent says, I believe that Christ is,
and that he is the Savior of the elect. Assurance says, I believe and am sure
that Christ dyed for me, and that I shall be saved through him. So that Assent
widens the nature of faith too much, and Assurance upon the other hand
straitens it too much: but Acceptance, which says, I take Christ in all his
offices to be mine, this fits it exactly, and belongs to all true believers,
and to none but true believers; and to all true believers at all times: this
therefore must be the justifying and saving act of faith.

Arg. 3.
Thirdly, That and no other is the justifying and saving act of faith, to which
the properties and effects of saving faith do Arg. 3.
belong, or in which they are only found.

But in the fiducial receiving of Christ, are the properties and effects of
saving faith only found.

This therefore must be the justifying and saving act of faith.

First, By saving faith Christ is said to dwell in our hearts, Ephesians. 3. 17. but
it is neither by assent, nor assurance, but by acceptance, and receiving him
that he dwells in our hearts: not by assent, for then he would dwell in the
unregenerate; nor by assurance, for he must dwell in our hearts before we can
be assured of it; Therefore it is by acceptance.

Secondly, By faith we are justified, Romans 5. 1. but neither assent nor
assurance for the reasons above, do justify; therefore it must be by the
receiving act and no other.

Thirdly, The Scripture ascribes great difficulties to that faith by which we
are saved: as being most cross and opposite to the corrupt nature of man; but
of all the acts of faith none is clogged with like difficulties, or conflicts
with greater oppositions than the receiving act does: about this act hang the
greatest difficulties, fears, and deepest self-denial. In assent a man's reason
is convinced, and yields to the evidence of truth, so that he can do no other
but assent to the truth. In assurance there is nothing against a man's will or
comfort, but much for it; every one desires it: but it is not so in acceptance
of Christ upon the self-denying terms of the Gospel, as will hereafter be
evinced. We conclude therefore, that in this consists the nature and essence of
saving faith.

Thirdly, Having seen what the receiving of Jesus Christ 3.
is, and that it is the faith by which we are justified and saved: I next come
to open the Dignity and excellency of this faith, whose praises and Encomiums
are in all the Scriptures: there you find it renowned by the title of precious
faith, 2 Pet. 1. 7. enriching faith, Jam. 2. 5. the work of God, Joh. 6. 29.
the great mystery of Godliness, 1 Timothy 3. 16. with many more rich Epithets
throughout the Scriptures bestowed upon it.

Now faith may be considered two ways, viz. either Qualitatively or
Relatively.


Considered qualitatively, as a saving grace, it has the same excellency that
all other precious saving graces have: as it is the fruit of the Spirit it is
more precious than Gold, Prove. 8. 11, 19. and so are all other graces as well
as faith: in this sense they all shine with equal glory, and that a glory
transcending all the glory of this world: but then consider faith Relatively as
the instrument by which the righteousness of Christ is apprehended and made
ours, and in that consideration it excels all other graces.

This is the grace that is singled out from among all other graces, to receive
Christ, by which office it is dignified above all its fellows: as Moses was
honored above the many thousands of Israel, when God took him up into the
Mount, admitted him nearer to himself than any other of all the Tribes might
come; for they stood without the Rail, while Moses was received into the
special presence of God, and was admitted to such views as others must not
have: so faith is honored above all its fellow graces in being singled out,
and solemnly anointed to this high office in our Justification: this is that
precious eye that looks unto Christ as the stung Israelites did to the brazen
Serpent, and derives healing virtue from him to the soul. It is the grace which
instrumentally saves us, Ephesians. 2. 8. as it is Christ's glory to be the door of
salvation, so it is Faiths glory to be the golden key that opens that door.

What shall I say of Faith? it is the bond of Union, the instrument of
justification, the spring of spiritual peace and joy, the means of spiritual
livelihood and subsistence: and therefore the great scope and drift of the
Gospel, which aims at and presses nothing more than to bring men and women to
believe.

First, This is the bond of our Union with Christ: that Union is begun in our
vivification, and completed in our actual receiving of Christ: the first is a
bond of Union on the Spirits part, the second, a bond of Union on our part.
Christ dwells in our hearts by faith, Ephesians. 3. 17. and herein it is a door
opened to let in many rich blessings to the soul: for by uniting us to Christ,
it brings us into special favor and acceptance with God, Ephesians. 1. 6. makes us
the special objects of Christ's conjugal love and delight, Ephesians. 5. 29. draws
from his heart sympathy and tender sense of all our miseries and burdens, Heb.
4. 15.

Secondly, It Is the instrument of our justification, Romans 5. 1. till Christ be
received, (thus received by us) we are in our sins, under guilt and
condemnation; but when faith comes, then comes freedom: by him all that
believe are justified from all things, Acts 13. 38. Romans 8. 1. for it
apprehends or receives the pure and perfect righteousness of the Lord Jesus,
wherein the soul how guilty and sinful soever it be in it self, stands
faultless and spotless before the presence of God: all Inveniri in Christo
tacitam habet relationem ad dei judicium; in iis nullam invenit condemnationem,
quia justitia, qualem esse requirit (i. e.) perfecta accumulata exornatos nos
invenit; nempe justitia Christi per fidem nobis imputata. Bern. in Loc.
obligations to punishment are upon believing immediately dissolved: a full and
final pardon sealed. O precious faith, who can sufficiently value it!

What respect, Reader, would thou have to that hand that should bring thee a
Pardon when on the Ladder or Block! why, that pardon, which thou can not read
without tears of joy, is brought thee by the hand of faith. O inestimable
grace! that clothes the pure righteousness of Jesus upon our defiled souls: and
so causes us to become the righteousness of God in him, or as it is 1 John 3.
7. righteous as he is righteous: non formali and intrinseca Justitia, sed
relativa: not with a formal inherent righteousness of our own, but with a
relative imputed righteousness from another.

I know this most excellent and most comfortable doctrine of imputed
righteousness is not only denied but derided by Papists. Stapleton calls it
spectrum Cerebri Lutherani: the monstrous birth of Luthers brain: but blessed
be God this comfortable truth is well secured against all attempts of its
adversaries. Let their blasphemous mouths call it in derision as they do,
putative righteousness, (i. e.) a mere fancied or conceited righteousness: yet
we know assuredly Christ's righteousness is imputed to us, and that in the way
of faith. If Adams sin became ours by Imputation, then so does Christ's
righteousness also become ours by Imputation, Romans 5. 17. If Christ were made a
sinner by the imputation of our sins to him, who had no sin of his own; then we
are made righteous by the imputation of Christ's righteousness to us, who have
no righteousness of our own; according to 1 Cor. 5. 21. This was the way in
which Abraham the father of them that believe was justified, and therefore this
is the way in which all believers, the children of Abraham, must in like manner
be justified. Romans 4. 22, 23, 24. Who can express the worth of faith in this
one respect, if this were all it did for our souls?

But Thirdly, It is the spring of our spiritual peace and joy; and that as it
is the Instrument of our Justification. If it be an instrument of our
Justification, it cannot but be the spring of our consolation. Romans 5. 1. Being
justified by faith, we have peace with God: in uniting us with Christ, and
apprehending and applying his righteousness to us, it becomes the seed or root
of all the peace and joy of a Christians life. Joy the child of faith therefore
bears its name, Phil. 1. 25. the joy of faith. So 1 Pet. 1. 8, 9. Believing we
rejoice with joy unspeakable: we cannot forbear laughing when we are tickled,
nor can we forbear rejoicing while by faith we are brought to the sight and
knowledge of such a privileged state: when faith has first given, and then
cleared our title to Christ, Joy is no more under the souls command: we cannot
but rejoice, and that with Joy unspeakable.

Fourthly, It is the means of our spiritual livelihood and subsistence: all
other graces like birds in the nest depend upon what faith brings in to them:
take away faith, and all the graces languish and dye: joy, peace, hope,
patience, and all the rest depend upon faith, as the members of the natural
body do upon the vessels by which blood and spirits are conveyed to them. The
life which I now live (says the Apostle) is by the faith of the Son of God,
Gal. 2. 20. it provides our ordinary food, and extraordinary Cordials, Psalm.
27. 13. I had fainted unless I had believed. And seeing it is all this to our
souls,

Fifthly, In the last place it is no wonder that it is the main scope and drift
of the Gospel to press and bring souls to believing: it is the Gospels grand
design to bring up the hearts of men and women to faith. The urgent commands of
the Gospel aim at this, 1 John 3. 23. Mark 1. 14, 15. Joh. 12. 36. hither also
look the great promises and encouragements of the Gospel, Joh. 6. 35 and 37. so
Mark 16. 16. And the opposite sin of unbelief is every where fearfully
aggravated, and threatened, Joh. 16. 8, 9. Joh. 3. 18. 35. And this was the
third thing premised, namely, a discovery of the transcendant worth and
excellency of saving faith.

Fourthly, But lest we commit a mistake here, to the prejudice of Christ's
honor and glory, which must not be 4.
given to another, no not to faith it self, I promised you in the fourth place
to snew you upon what account faith is thus dignified and honored: that so we
may give unto faith, the things that are faiths; and to Christ, the things that
are Christ's.

And I find four opinions about the interest of faith in our Justification:
some will have it to justify us formally, not relatively: (i. e.) upon the
account of its own intrinsecal value and worth, and this is the Popish sense of
Justification by faith. Some affirm that though faith be not our perfect legal
righteousness considered as a work of ours, yet the act of believing is imputed
to us for righteousness (i. e.) God graciously accepts it instead of perfect
legal righteousness, and so in his esteem it is our evangelical righteousness.
And this is the Arminian sense of justification by faith.

Some there are also even among our reformed Divines that contend that faith
justifies and saves us as it is the Condition of the new Covenant. And Lastly,
others will have it to justify us as an Instrument apprehending or receiving
the righteousness of Christ; with which opinion I must close: when I consider
my Text calls it a receiving of Christ: most certain it is

That First, It does not justify in the Popish sense, upon the account of its
own proper worth and dignity: for then

First, Justification should be of debt, not of grace; contrary to Romans 3. 23,
24.

Secondly, This would frustrate the very scope and end of the death of Christ;
for if righteousness come by the Law, (i. e.) by the way of works and desert,
then is Christ dead in vain, Gal. 2. 21.

Thirdly, Then the way of our justification by faith would be so sar from
excluding, that it would establish boasting, expressly contrary to the Apostle,
Romans 3. 26, 27.

Fourthly, Then there should be no defects or imperfections in faith, for a
defective and imperfect thing can never be the matter of our Justification
before God: if it justify upon the account of its own worth and proper
dignity, it can have no flaw nor imperfection in it, contrary to the common
sense of all believers. Nay,

Fifthly, Then it is the same thing to be justified by faith, and to be
justified by works, which the Apostle so carefully distinguishes and opposes,
Phil. 3. 9. and Romans 4. 6. so that we conclude it does not justify in the
Popish sense, for any worth or proper excellency that is in it self.

Secondly, And it is as evident it does not justify us in the Arminian sense,
viz. as the (...) credere, the Act of believing is imputed, or accepted by God
as our Evangelical righteousness, instead of perfect legal righteousness. In
the former opinion you have the dreggs of Popery, and here you have refined
Popery. Let all Arminians know we have as high esteem for faith as any men in
the world can have, but yet we will not rob Christ to cloth faith: we cannot
embrace their opinion, because

First, We must then dethrone Christ, to exalt faith: we are willing to give it
all that is due to it, but we dare not despoyl Christ of his glory for faiths
sake: he is the Lord our righteousness, Jer. 23. we dare not set the servant
above the master: we acknowledge no righteousness but what the obedience and
satisfaction of Christ yields us: his blood, not our faith, his satisfaction,
not our believing it, is the matter of our justification before God.

Secondly, We dare not yield this point, lest we undermine all the comfort of
Christians by bottoming their pardon and peace upon a weak, imperfect work of
their own. Oh how tottering and unstable must their station be, that stand upon
such a bottom as this! what ups and downs are there in our faith, what mixtures
of unbelief at all times, and prevalency of unbelief at some times; and is this
a foundation to build our justification and hope upon? debile fundamentum
fallit opus: if we lay the stress here, we build upon very loose ground, and
must be at a continual loss both as to safety and comfort.

Thirdly, We dare not wrong the justice and truth of God at that rate, as to
affirm that he esteems and imputes our poor weak faith for perfect legal
righteousness: we know that the judgment of God is always according to truth:
if Ergo quia fides Christum justitiam nostram recipit and gratiae dei in
Christo omnia tribuit, ideo fidei tribuitur justificatio, maxim propter
Christum, and non ideo quia nostrum opus est. Confess. Helv. (...).
the justice of God requires full payment, sure it will not say it is fully
satisfied by any act of ours; when all that we can do amounts not to one mite
of the vast sum we owe to God. So that we deservedly reject this opinion also.

Thirdly, And for the third opinion that it justifies as the Condition of the
new Covenant, though some of great name and worth among our Protestant Divines
seem to go that way, yet I cannot see according to this opinion any reason why
repentance may not as properly be said to justify us as faith, for it is a
condition of the new Covenant as much as faith, and if faith justify as a
condition, then every other grace that is a condition must justify as well as
faith. I acknowledge faith to be a condition of the Covenant, but cannot allow
that it justifies as a condition. And therefore must profess my self best
satisfied in the last opinion, which speaks it an instrument in our
justification: it is the hand which receives the righteousness of Christ that
justifies us, and that gives it its value above all other graces: as when we
say a Diamond Ring is worth one hundred pounds, we mean not the Gold that
receives, but the stone that is set in it is worth so much: faith considered as
an habit is no more precious than other gracious habits are, but considered as
an instrument to receive Christ, and his righteousness; so it excels them all:
and this instrumentality of faith is noted in those phrases (...). Romans 3. 28.
and (...), Romans 3. 22. by faith and through faith. And thus much of the nature
and excellency of saving faith.

The Seventh SERMON. Sermon. 7.

JOH. 1. 12. Text.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God;
even to them that believe on his name.
THe Nature and Excellency of saving faith, together with its relation to
justification as an Instrument in receiving Christ and his righteousness,
having been discoursed doctrinally already, I now come to make application of
it according to the nature of this weighty and fruitful point.

And the Uses I shall make of it will be for our

1. Information. 2. Examination. 3. Exhortation. And. 4. Direction.
First Use of Information.
And in the first place this point yields us many and great 1. Use.
and useful truths for our Information: as,

Infer. 1.
Is the receiving of Christ the vital and saving act of faith Infer. 1.
which gives the soul right to the person and privileges of Christ: Then it
follows, That the rejecting of Christ by unbelief must needs be the damning and
soul-destroying sin, which cuts a man off from Christ and all the benefits
purchased by his blood. If there be life in receiving, there must needs be
death in rejecting Christ.

There is no grace more excellent than faith, no sin more execrable and
abominable than unbelief: faith is the saving grace, and unbelief is the
damning sin. Mark 16. 16. He that believes not shall be damned. See Joh. 3.
18, 36. and Joh. 8. 24.

And the reason why this sin of unbelief is the damning sin is this, because in
the justification of a sinner, there must be a cooperation of all the Concauses
that have a joint influence into that blessed effect: As there must be free
grace for an impulsive cause, The blood of Christ as the meritorious cause; so
of necessity there must be faith the Instrumental cause to receive and apply
what the free grace of God designed, and the blood of Christ purchased for us.
For where there are many social causes or concauses to produce one effect,
there the effect is not produced till the last cause be in Act.

To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever
believes in him shall receive remissions of sins, Acts 10. 43. Faith in its
place is as necessary as the blood of Christ in its place: it is Christ in you
the hope of glory, Col. 1. 27. not Christ in the womb, nor Christ in the grave,
nor Christ in heaven, except he be also Christ in you.

Though Christ be come in the flesh, though he dyed and rose again from the
dead; yet if you believe not, you must for all that, dye in your sins, Joh. 8.
24. and what a dreadful thing is this! better dye the death of a dog, better
dye in a ditch, than dye in your sins: if you dye in your sins, you will also
rise in your sins; and stand at the bar of Christ in your sins: you can never
receive remission till first you have received Christ. O cursed unbelief, which
damns the soul: dishonours God, 1 John 5. 10. sleights Jesus Christ the wisdom
of God, as if that glorious design of redemption by his blood, the triumph and
masterpiece of divine wisdom, were mere foolishness, 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.
frustrates the great design of the Gospel, Gal. 4. 11. and consequently it must
be the sin of sins: the worst and most dangerous of all sins: leaving a man
under the guilt of all his other sins.

Infer. 2.
If such a receiving of Christ as has been described, be saving and justifying
faith? Then faith is a work of greater difficulty Infer. 2.
than most men understand it to be, and there are but few sound believers in
the world.

Before Christ can be received the heart must be emptied and opened: but most
men's hearts are full of self righteousness, and vain confidence: this was the
case of the Jews, Romans 10. 3. being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going
about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God.

Man's righteousness was once in himself, and what liquor is first put into the
vessel, it ever afterward savours of it: it is with Adams posterity as with Bees
which have been accustomed to go their own hive, and carry all thither; if the
hive be removed to another place, they will still fly to the old place, hover
up and down about it, and rather dye there, than go to a new place. So it is
with most men. God has removed their righteousness from doing, to believing:
from themselves, to Christ; but who shall prevail with them to forsake self?
nature will venture to be damned rather than do it: there is much submission in
believing, and great self denial: a proud self-conceited heart will never stoop
to live upon the stock of another righteousness.

Besides, it is no easy thing to persuade men to receive Christ as their Lord
in all things, and submit their necks to his strict and holy precepts, though
it be a great truth that Christ's yoke does not gall, but grace and adorn the
neck that Jugum Christi non deterit, sed honestat colla. Bern.
bears it; that the truest and sweetest liberty is in our freedom from our
lusts, not in our fulfilling them: yet who shall persuade the carnal heart to
believe this? and much less will men ever be prevailed withal to forsake
father, mother, wife, children, inheritance, and life it self, to follow
Christ: and all this upon the account of spiritual and invisible things: and
yet this must be done by all that receive the Lord Jesus Christ upon Gospel
terms: yea, and before the soul has any encouraging experience of its own, to
balance the manifold discouragements of sense and carnal reason, improved by
the utmost craft of Satan to dismay it: for experience is the fruit and
consequent of believing. So that it may well be placed among the great
mysteries of godliliness, that Christ is believed on in the world, 1 Timothy 3. 16.

Infer. 3.
And then Thirdly, hence it will follow; that there may be more true and sound
believers in the world than know or dare conclude Infer. 3.
themselves to be such. For as many ruin their own souls by placing the
essence of saving faith in naked assent, so some rob themselves of their own
comfort by placing it in full assurance. Faith and sense of faith are two
distinct and separable mercies: you may have truly received Christ, and not
receive the knowledge or assurance of it, Isa. 50. 10. Some there be that say
thou art our God, of whom God never said you are my people: these have no
authority to be called the sons of God: others there are of whom God says,
these are my people, yet dare not call God their God: these have authority to
be called the sons of God, but know it not. They have received Christ, that is
their safety; but they have not yet received the knowledge and assurance of it,
that is their trouble: the Father owns his child in the Cradle, who yet knows
him not to be his Father.

Now there are two reasons why many believers who might argue themselves into
peace, do yet live without the comforts of their faith: and this may come to
pass either from

First, The inevidence of the premises.

Secondly, Or the weighty importance of the conclusion.

First, It may come to pass from the inevidence of the premises. Assurance is a
practical Syllogism, and it proceeds thus:

All that truly have received Christ Jesus, they are the children of God.

I have truly received Jesus Christ,

Therefore I am the child of God.

The Major proposition is found in the Scripture, and there can be no doubt of
that: the Assumption depends upon experience, or internal sense. I have truly
received Jesus Christ: here usually is the stumble, many great objections lie
against it, which they cannot clearly answer: as,

Light and knowledge are necessarily required to the right 1. Ob.
receiving of Christ, but I am dark and ignorant, many carnal unregenerate
persons know more than I do, and are more able to discourse of the mysteries of
Religion than I am.

But you ought to distinguish of the kinds and degrees of Sol.
knowledge, and then you would see that your bewailed ignorance is no bar to
your interest in Christ. There are two kinds of knowledge:

1. Natural. 2. Spiritual.
There is a natural knowledge even of spiritual objects, a spark of nature
blown up by an advantageous education, and though the objects of this knowledge
be spiritual things, yet the light in which they are discerned is but a mere
natural light.

And there is a spiritual knowledge of spiritual things, the teaching of the
anointing, as it is called 1 John 2. 27. (i. e.) the effect and fruit of the
Spirits sanctifying work upon our souls, when the experience of a man's own
heart informs and teaches his understanding, when by feeling the workings of
grace in our own souls, we come to understand its nature: this is spiritual
knowledge. Now a little of this knowledge is a better evidence of a man's
interest in Christ, than the most raised and excellent degree of natural
knowledge: as the Philosopher truly observes: praestat paucula de meliori
scientia degustasse, quam de ignobiliori multa: one dram of knowledge of the
best and most excellent things, is better than much knowledge of common things.
So it is here, a little spiritual knowledge of Jesus Christ, that has life and
savor in it, is more than all the natural sapless knowledge of the
unregenerate, which leaves the heart dead, carnal and barren: it is not the
quantity but the kind, not the measure but the savor: if you know so much of
the evil of sin as renders it the most bitter and burdensome thing in the world
to you, and so much of the necessity and excellency of Christ, as renders him
the most sweet and desirable thing in the world to you; though you may be
defective in many degrees of knowledge, yet this is enough to prove yours to be
the fruit of the Spirit: you may have a sanctified heart, though you have an
irregular or weak head: many that knew more than you are in hell, and some that
once knew as little as you are now in heaven: in absoluto and facili stat
aeternitas: God has not prepared heaven only for clear and subtle heads: a
little sanctifified and effectual knowledge of Christ's person, offices,
suitableness, and necessity may bring thee thither, when others with all their
curious speculations and notions may perish for ever.

But you tell me that Assent to the truths of the Gospel is 2. Ob.
necessarily included in saving faith, which though it be not the justifying
and saving act, yet it is presupposed and required to it: now I have many
staggerings and doubtings about the certainty and reality of these things: many
horrid atheistical thoughts, which shake the assenting act of faith in the very
foundation, and hence I doubt I do not believe.

There may be and often is a true and sincere assent found in the soul that is
assaulted with violent atheistical suggestions Sol.
from Satan; and thereupon questions the truth of it: and this is a very clear
evidence of the reality of our assent, that whatever doubts or contrary
suggestions there be, yet we dare not in our practice contradict or slight
those truths or duties which we are tempted to disbelieve. Ex. gr. we are
assaulted with atheistical thoughts, and tempted to slight and cast off all
fears of sin, and practice of religious duties, yet when it comes to the point
of practice, we dare not commit a known sin, the awe of God is upon us: we dare
not omit a known duty, the tie of conscience is found strong enough to hold us
close to it: in this case, it is plain, we do really assent, when we think we do
not. A man thinks he does not love his child, yet carefully provides for him in
health, and is full of grief and fears about him in sickness: why now, so long
as I see all fath rly duties performed, and affections to his child's welfare
manifested; let him say what he will as to the want of love to him, whilst I
see this, he must excuse me if I do not believe him, when he says he has no
love for him: Just so is it in this case, A man says I do not assent to the
being, necessity, or excellency of Jesus Christ: yet in the mean time his soul
is filled with cares and fears about securing his interest in him, he is found
panting and thirsting for him with vehement desires, there is nothing in all the
world would give him such joy, as to be well assured of an interest in him;
while it is thus with any man, let him say or think what he will of his assent,
it is manifest by this he does truly and heartily assent, and there can be no
better proof of it than these real effects produced by it.

Secondly, But if these, and other objections were never so fully answered for
the clearing of the assumption, yet it often falls out, that believers are
afraid to draw the conclusion, and that fear arises partly from

First, The weighty importance of the matter.

Secondly, The sense of the deceitfulness of their own hearts.

First, The conclusion is of infinite importance to them, it is the everlasting
happiness of their souls, than which nothing is or can be of greater weight
upon their spirits: things in which we are most deeply concerned are not
lightly and hastily received by us: it seems so great and so good, that we are
still apt (if there be any room for it) to suspect the truth and certainty
thereof, as never being sure enough.

Thus when the women that were the first messengers and witnesses of Christ's
resurrection, Luke 24. 10, 11. came and told the disciples those wonderful and
comfortable tidings, it is said, that their words seemed to them as idle tales,
and they believed them not: they thought it was too good to be true: too great
to be hastily received: so is it in this case.

Secondly, The sense they have of the deceitfulness of their own hearts, and
the daily workings of hypocrisy there, makes them afraid to conclude in so
great a point as this is.

They know that very many daily cozen and cheat themselves in this matter, they
know also that their own hearts are full of falseness and deceit, they find
them so in their daily observations of them, and what if they should prove so
in this? why then they are lost for ever! they also know there is not the like
danger in their fears and jealousies, that would be in their vain confidences
and presumptions: by the one they are only deprived of their present comfort,
but by the other they would be ruined for ever: and therefore choose rather to
dwell with their own fears, (though they be uncomfortable companions) than run
the danger of so great a mistake, which would be infinitely more fatal. And
this being the common case of most Christians, it follows that there must be
many more believers in the world than do think or dare conclude themselves to
be such.

Infer. 4.
If the right receiving of Jesus Christ be true saving and justifying faith,
then those that have the least and lowest degree and measure Infer. 4.
of saving faith, have cause for ever to admire the bounty and riches of the
grace of God to them therein.

If you have received never so little of his bounty by the hand of providence
in the good things of this life, yet if he have given you any measure of true
saving faith, he has dealt bountifully indeed with you: this mercy alone is
enough to balance all other wants and inconveniences of this life. Poor in
the world, rich in faith, James 2. 5. O let your hearts take in the full sense
of this bounty of God to you, say with the Apostle, Ephesians. 1. 3. blessed be the
God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: and you will in this one mercy
find matter enough of praise and thanksgiving, wonder and admiration to your
dying day, yea, to all eternity: for do but consider

First, The smallest measure of saving faith which is found in any of the
poople of God, receives Jesus Christ; and in receiving him what mercy is there
which the believing soul does not receive in him and with him? Romans 8. 32.

O believer, though the arms of thy faith be small and weak; yet they embrace a
great Christ, and receive the richest gift that ever God bestowed upon the
world: no sooner art thou become a believer, but Christ is in thee the hope of
glory: and thou have authority to become a son or daughter of God: thou have
the broad seal of heaven to confirm thy title and claim to the privileges of
Adoption, for to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God. To as many] be they strong, or be they weak; provided they really
receive Christ by faith; there is authority or power given, so that it is no act
of presumption in them to say God is our Father, heaven is our inheritance. Oh
precious faith! the treasures of ten thousand worlds cannot purchase such
privileges as these: all the Crowns and Scepters of the earth sold at their
full value, are no price for such mercies.

Secondly, The least degree of saving faith brings the soul into a state of
perfect and full Justification. For if it receives Jesus Christ, it must
therefore needs in him, and with him receive a free, full, and final pardon of
sin: the least measure of faith receives remission for the greatest sins. By
him all that believe are justified from all things, Acts 13. 39. it unites thy
soul with Christ, and then as the necessary consequent of that Union, there is
no condemnation, Romans 8. 1. (...) not one condemnation, how many soever our
sins have been.

Thirdly, The least measure or degree of saving faith is a greater mercy than
God has bestowed, or ever will bestow upon many that are far above you in
outward respects: all men have not faith: nay it is but a remnant among men that
believe. Few of the Nobles and Potentates of the world have such a gift as
this: they have houses and lands, yea, Crowns and Scepters, but no Faith, no
Christ, no pardon: they have authority to rule over men, but no authority to
become the sons of God, 1 Cor. 1. 26, 27.

Say therefore in thy most debased, straightened, afflicted condition, Return to
thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee.

Fourthly, The least degree of saving faith is more than all the power of
nature can produce: there must be a special revelation of the arm of the Lord
in that work, Isa. 53. 1. Believers are not born of flesh, nor of blood, nor of
the will of man, but of God, Joh. 1. 12, 13. all believing motions toward
Christ are the effects of the Fathers drawing, Joh. 6. 44. a glorious and
irresistible power goes forth from God to produce it, whence it is called the
faith of the operation of God, Col. 2. 12.

So then, Let not believers depise the day of small things: or overlook that
great and infinite mercy which is wrapped up in the least degree of saving faith.

Inference 5.
Learn hence the impossibility of their salvation who neither know the nature,
nor enjoy the means of saving faith. Infer. 5.


My soul pities and mourns over the infidel world. Ah what will become of the
millions of poor unbelievers! there is but one door of salvation, viz. Christ;
and but one Key of faith to open that door: and as that key was never given to
the heathen world, so it is laid aside, or taken away from the people by their
cruel guides, all over the Popish world: were you among them you should hear
nothing else pressed as necessary to your salvation but a blind implicit faith,
to believe as the Church believes, that is, to believe they know not what.

To believe as the Pope believes, that is, as an Infidel believes, for so they
confess he may be, Non enim fides interior Romani Po^tificis ecclesiae est
necessaria. Canus Loc. Theol. p. 344.
and though there be such a thing as an explicit faith sometimes spoken of
among them, yet it is very sparingly discoursed, very falsely described, and
exceedingly slighted by them, as the veriest trifle in the world.

First, It is but sparingly discoursed of: they love not to accustom the
peoples ears to such doctrine: one of themselves confesses that there is so
deep a silence of explicit particular faith in the Romish Church that you may
find many every where that believe no more of these things than heathen Navarr,
cap. 11. p. 142.
Philosophers.

Secondly, When it is preached or written of, it is falsely described: for they
place the whole nature and essence of justifying and saving faith in a naked
assent: which the Devils have as well as men, James 2. 19. no more than this is
pressed upon the people at any time, as necessary to their salvation.

Thirdly, And even this particular explicit faith when it is spoken or written
of is exceedingly slighted. I think if the Devil himself were in the Pulpit, he
could hardly tell how to bring men to a more low and slight esteem of faith; to
represent it as a verier trifle, and needless thing than these his Agents have
done. Some ( Petr. a S. Joseph. sum. Art. 1. p. 6.
) say, if a man believe with a particular explicit faith (i. e.) if he actually
assent to Scripture truths once in a year, it is enough. Yea, and others (
Bonacina Tom. 2. in 1. praecept.
) think it too much to oblige people to believe once in twelve months, and for
their ease tell them if they believe once in twelve years it is sufficient: and
lest this should be too great a task ( Jo. Sanc. Disp. 41. n. 32.
) others affirm that if it be done but once in their whole life, and that at
the point of death too, it is enough, especially for the rude and common
people. Good God! what doctrine is here! it was a saying long ago of Gregory
(as I remember) malus minister est nisus di^boli: a wicked minister is the
devils Gosshawk, that goes a birding for hell: and O what game have these hawks
of hell among such numerous flocks of people! O bless God while you live for
your deliverance from Popery: and see that you prize the Gospel and means of
grace you enjoy at an higher rate, lest God bring you once more under that
yoke, which neither you nor your Fathers could bear.

Second Use for Examination.
Does saving faith consist in a due and right receiving of the Lord Jesus
Christ, then let me persuade you to examine 2. Use.
your selves in this great point of faith. Reflect solemnly upon the
transactions that have been betwixt Christ and your souls: think close on this
subject of meditation.

If all you were worth in the world lay in one precious stone, and that stone
were to be tried by the skilful Lapidary, whether it were true or false,
whether it would fly or endure under the smart stroke of his Hammer, sure your
thoughts could not be unconcerned about the issue: why, all that you are worth
in both worlds depends upon the truth of your says, which is now to be tried.

O therefore read not these lines with a running careless eye, but seriously
ponder the matter before you: you would be loath to put to Sea, though it were
but to cross the channel, in a rotten leaky bottom: and will you dare to
venture into the ocean of eternity in a false rotten faith? God forbid: you
know the Lord is coming to try every man's faith as by fire, and that we must
stand or fall for ever with the sincerity or hypocrisy of our faith. Surely
you can never be too exact and careful about that on which your whole estate
depends, and that for ever.

Now there are three things upon which we should have a very tender and
watchful eye for the discovery of the sincerity of our faith, and they are The
Antecedents of Faith. Concomitants Consequents

As these are, so we must judge and reckon our faith to be. And accordingly
they furnish us with three general Marks or trials of faith.

First, If you would discern the sincerity of your faith examine 1. Mark.
whether those Antecedents and preparative works of the Spirit were ever found
in your souls, which use to introduce and usher it into the souls of Gods
Elect: such are illumination, conviction, self-despair, and earnest cries to God.

First, Illumination is a necessary antecedent to faith: you cannot believe
till God has opened your eyes to see your sin, your misery by sin, and your
remedy in Jesus Christ alone: you find this act of the Spirit to be the first
in order both of nature and time, and introductive to all the rest, Acts 26.
18. To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. As
faith without works (which must be a consequent to it) is dead, so faith
without light, which must be an Antecedent to it, is blind: faith is the hand
by which Christ is received, but knowledge is the eye by which that hand is
directed.

Well then, has God opened your eyes to see sin and misery in another manner
than ever you saw it before? for certainly if God have opened your eyes by
saving illumination, you will find as great a difference betwixt your former
and present apprehensions of sin and danger, as betwixt a painted Lion upon the
wall or sign post, and the real living Lion that meets you roaring in the way.

Secondly, Conviction is an Antecedent to believing: where this goes not
before, no faith can follow after: the Spirit first convinces of sin, then of
righteousness, Joh. 16. 8. So Mark 1. 15. repent ye, and believe the Gospel:
believe it O man, that breast of thine must be wounded, that vain and frothy
heart of thine must be pierced and stung with conviction, sense, and sorrow for
sin: thou must have some sick days and restless nights for sin, if ever thou
rightly close with Christ by faith: it is true, there is much difference found
in the strength, depth, and continuance of conviction and spiritual troubles in
converts, as there is in the labors and travailing pains of women, but sure it
is, the child of faith is not ordinarily born without some pangs. Conviction is
the application of that light which God makes to shine in our minds, to our
particular case and condition, by the conscience: and sure when men come to see
their miserable and sad estate by a true light, it cannot but wound them, and
that to the very heart.

Thirdly, Self-despair, or a total and absolute loss in our selves about
deliverance, and the way of escape, either by our selves, or any other mere
creature, does and must go before faith.

So it was with those believers, Acts 2. 37. men and brethren what shall we do?
they are the words of men at a total loss: it is the voice of poor distressed
souls that saw themselves in misery, but knew not, saw not, nor could devise
any way of escape from it, by any thing they could do for themselves, or any
other creature for them: and hence the Apostle uses that emphatical word, Gal.
3. 23. (...) (i. e.) shut up to the faith, (i. e.) as men besieged and
distressed in a garrison in time of a storm, when the enemy pours in upon them
through the breaches, and over-powers them: there is but one sally-port or gate
at which they can escape, and to that they all throng; as despairing of life if
they take any other course: Just so do men's convictions besiege them, distress
them, beat them off from all their holds and intrenchments; and bring them to a
pinching distress in themselves, shutting them up to Christ as the only way of
escape. Duties cannot save me, reformation cannot save me, nor Angels nor men
can save me; there is no way but one, Christ or Condemnation for evermore.

I thought once that a little repentance, reformation, restitution, and a
stricter life, might be a way to escape wrath to come; but I find the bed is
too short, and the covering too narrow: all is but loss, dung, dross, in
comparison with Jesus Christ: if I trust to those Egyptian reeds, they will
not only fail me, but pierce and wound me too. I see no hope within the whole
Horizon of sense.

Fourthly, Hence come vehement and earnest cries to God for faith, for Christ,
for help from heaven to transport the soul out of this dangerous condition, to
that strong rock of salvation: to bring it out of this farious stormy Sea of
trouble where it is ready to wreck every moment, into that safe and quiet
harbor Christ.

O when a man shall see his misery and danger, and no way of escape but Christ,
and that he has no ability in himself to come to Christ, to open his heart
thus to receive him, but that this work of faith is wholly supernatural, the
operation of God; How will the soul return again and again upon God with such
cries as that Mark 9. 24. Lord help my unbelief. Lord enable me to come to
Christ: give me Christ or I perish for ever: what profit is there in my blood?
why should I dye in the sight and presence of a Savior? O Lord it is thine own
work and a most glorious work: reveal thine arm in this work upon my soul, I
pray thee: give me Christ, if thou deny me bread: give me faith, if thou deny
me breath: it is more necessary that I believe, than that I live.

O Reader, reflect upon the days and nights that are past, the places where
thou have been conversant: where are the bed-sides, or the secret corners where
thou have besieged heaven with such cries? if God have thus enlightened,
convinced, distressed thy soul, and thus set thee a mourning after Christ, it
will be one good sign that faith is come into thy soul; for here are certainly
the Harbingers and fore runners of it, that ordinarily make way for faith into
the souls of men.

Secondly, If you would be satisfied of the sincerity and truth 2. Mark.
of your faith, then examine what Concomitants it is attended with in your
souls. I mean what frames and tempers your souls were in at that time when you
think you received Christ. For certainly in those that receive Christ
(excepting those into whose hearts God has in a more still and insensible way
infused faith betime, by his blessing upon pious education) such concomitant
frames of Spirit may be remarkt, as these following.

First, The heart is deeply serious, and as much in earnest in this matter, as
ever it was, or can be about any thing in the world. This you see in that
example of the Jailer, Acts 16. 29. he came in trembling and astonished: it is
the most solemn and important matter that ever the soul had before it in this
world, or ever shall, or can have: how much are the hearts of men affected in
their outward straits and distresses about the concernments of the body? their
hearts are not a little concerned in such questions as these, What shall I eat?
what shall I drink? where withal shall I and mine be fed and clothed? but
certainly the straits that souls are in about salvation, must be allowed to be
greater than these; and such questions as that of the Jaylors; Sirs! what must
I do to be saved? make deeper impressions upon the heart, than what shall I
eat, or drink? Some indeed have their thoughts sinking deeper into these things
than others: these thoughts lie with different degrees of weight upon men: but
all are most solemnly and awfully concerned about their condition: all
frothiness and frolicks are gone, and the heart settles it self in deepest
earnest about its eternal state.

Secondly, The heart that receives Jesus Christ is in a frame of deep
humiliation and self-abasement. O when a man begins to apprehend the first
approaches of grace, pardon and mercy ^y Jesus Christ to his soul: a soul
convinced of its utter unworthiness, and desert of hell; and can scarce expect
any thing else from the just and holy God but damnation; how do the first
dawnings of mercy melt and humble it! O Lord what am I that thou should feed
me and preserve me! that thou should but for a few years spare me, and
forbear me! but that ever Jesus Christ should love me and give himself for me,
that such a wretched sinner as I should obtain Union with his person, pardon,
peace and salvation by his blood! Lord whence is this to such a worm as I? and
will Christ indeed bestow himself upon me? shall so great a blessing as Christ
ever come within the arms of such a soul as mine? will God in very deed be
reconciled to me in his son? what to me! to such an enemy as I have been! shall
my sins which are so many, so horrid, so much aggravated beyond the sins of
most men, be forgiven me? O what am I vile dust, base wretch, that ever God
should do this for me! And now is that Scripture indeed fulfilled and made
good, Ezech. 16. 63. That thou may remember, and be confounded, and never
open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee
for all that thou have done, says the Lord God. Thus that poor brokenhearted
believer stood behind Christ weeping, and washing his feet with tears; as one
quite melted down and overcome with the sense of mercy to such a vile sinner,
Luke 7. 38.

Thirdly, The soul that receives Jesus Christ is in a weary Condition, restless
and full of disquietness, neither able to bear the burden of sin, nor knowing
how to be discharged from it; except Christ will give it ease, Matthew. 11. 28.
Come unto me, that is believe in me, you that are weary and heavy laden: if
they do not look into their own souls they know there is no safety, and if they
do, there is no comfort. O the burdensome sense of sin overweighs them: they are
ready to fail, to sink under it.

Fourthly, The soul that rightly receives Christ is not only in a weary, but in
a longing condition: never did the heart pant more earnestly for the
waterbrooks: never did the hireling desire the shadow, never did a condemned
person long for a pardon, more than the soul longs after Jesus Christ. O said
David, that one would give me of the waters of the well of Bethlehem to drink.
O says the poor humbled sinner, that one would give me of the opened fountain
of the blood of Christ to drink! O for one drop of that precious blood! O for
one encouraging smile from Christ! O now were ten thousand worlds at my
command, and Christ to be bought; how freely would I lay them all down to
purchase him! but he is the gift of God. O that God would give me Christ if I
should go in rags, and hunger and thirst all my days in this world!

Fifthly, The soul in the time of its closing with or receiving Christ is in a
state of conflict: it hangs betwixt hopes and fears, encouragements and
discouragements, which occasion many a sad stand and pause in the way to
Christ; sometimes the number and nature of its sins discourage it, then the
riches and freeness of the grace of Christ erects his hopes again: there is
little hope, says unbelief, nay it is utterly impossible says Satan, that ever
such a wretch as thou should find mercy; now the hands hang down. O but then
there is a necessity, an absolute necessity; I have not the choice of two, but
am shutup to one way of deliverance: others have found mercy, and the
invitation is to all that are weary, and to all that are athirst: he says he
that comes to him, he will in no wise castout; now new hopes inspire the soul,
and the hands that did hang down are again strengthened.

These are the Concomitant frames that accompany faith.

Lastly, Examine the Consequents and effects of Faith if you 3. Mark.
would be satisfied of the truth and sincerity of it: and such are

First, Evangelical meltings, and ingenuous thawings of the heart under the
apprehensions of grace and mercy: Zech. 12. 10. They shall look upon me whom
they have pierced, and shall mourn.

Secondly, Love to Christ, his ways and people. Gal. 5. 6. Faith works by
love, (i. e.) it represents the love of God, and then makes use of the
sweetness of it by way of argument to constrain the soul to all acts of
obedience, wherein it may testify the reality of its love to God and Christ.

Thirdly, Heart purity, Acts 15. 9. purifying their hearts by faith: it does
not only cleanse the hands but the heart: no principle in man besides faith can
do this: morality may hide corruption, but faith only purifies the heart from
it.

Fourthly, Obedience to the commands of Christ, Romans 16. 26. the very name of
faith is called upon obedience: for it accepts Christ as Lord, and urges upon
the soul the most powerful arguments in the world to draw it to obedience.

In a word, let the poor doubting believer that questions his faith, reflect
upon those things that are unquestionable in his own experience, which being
well considered will greatly tend to his satisfaction in this point.

It Is very doubtful to you whether you believe, but yet in the mean while, it
may be past doubt, (being a matter of clear experience) that you have been
deeply convinced of sin, struck off from all carnal props and refuges, made
willing to accept Jesus Christ upon what terms soever you might enjoy him: you
doubt whether Christ be yours, but it is past doubt that you have a most high
and precious esteem of Christ, that you heartily long for him, that you prize
and love all, whether persons or things, that bears his image: that nothing in
the world would please your hearts like a transformation into his likeness,
that you had rather your souls should be filled with his Spirit, than your
houses with Gold and Silver. It Is doubtful whether Christ be yours, but it is
past doubt that one smile from Christ, one token of his love, would do you more
good than all the honors and smiles of the world; and nothing so grieves you,
as your grieving him by sin does: you dare not say that you have received him,
nor can you deny but that you have had many sick days and nights for him: that
you have gone into many secret places with yearning bowels after him: whether
he be yours or not, you cannot tell; but that you are resolved to be his, that
you can tell: whether he will save you is a doubt, but that you resolve to lie
at his feet, and wait only on him, and never look to another for salvation, is
no doubt.

Well, well; poor pensive soul, if it be so, arise, lift up thy dejected head,
take thine own Christ into thy arms. These are undoubted signs of a real
closure with Christ: thou make thy self poor, and yet have great riches: such
things as these are not found in them that despise and reject Christ by
unbelief.

3. Use of Exhortation.
This point is likewise very improveable by way of Exhortation, 3. Use.
and that both to Unbelievers and Believers.


First, To unbelievers who from hence must be pressed, as ever they expect to see
the face of God in peace, to receive Jesus Christ as he is now offered to them
in the Gospel: this is the very scope of the Gospel, I shall therefore press it
by three great Considerations: viz.

First, What is in Christ whom you are to receive.

Secondly, What is in the offer of Christ by the Gospel.

Thirdly, What is in the rejecting of that offer.

First Motive.
First, Consider well what is in Christ whom I persuade you this day to
receive: did you know what is in Christ, you Motive 1.
would never neglect or reject him as you do: For

First, God is in Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 19. the Deity has chosen to dwell in his
flesh, he is God manifest in flesh, 1 Timothy 3. 16. a Godhead dwelling in flesh
is the worlds wonder: so that in receiving Christ, you receive God himself.

Secondly, The Authority of God is in Christ, Ex^ 23. 21. My name is in him:
him has God the father sealed, Joh. 6. 27. he has the Commission, the great
seal of heaven to redeem and save you: all power in heaven and earth is given
to him, Matthew. 28. 18. he comes in his Fathers name to you, as well as in his
own name.

Thirdly, The wisdom of God is in Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 24. Christ the wisdom of
God: yea, in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2. 3.
Never did the wisdom of God display it self before the eyes of Angels and men
as it has done in Christ. The Angels desire to look into it, 1 Pet. 1. 12. yet
they are not so much concerned in the project and design of this wisdom in
redemption as you are.

Fourthly, The fullness of the Spirit is in Christ: yea, it fills him so as it
never did nor will fill any creature, Joh. 3. 34. God gives not the Spirit by
measure to him: all others have their limits, stints, and measures; some more,
some less; but the Spirit is in Christ without measure. O h^w lovely and
desirable are those men that have a large measure of the Spirit in them! but he
is anointed with the Spirit of holiness above all his fellows, Psalm. 45. 2, 7.
Whatever grace is found in all the Saints which makes them desirable and
lovely, wisdom in one, faith in another, patience in a third; they all Center
in Christ as the rivers do in the Sea: quae faciunt divisa beatum, in hoc mixta
(...).

Fifthly, The righteousness of God is in Christ, by which only a poor guilty
sinner can be justified before God. 2 Cor. 5. 21. we are made the righteousness
of God in him: he is (...) the Lord our righteousness, Jer. 23. 6. (i. e.) the
(i. e.) Autorem justitiae nostrae. Calv. in Loc.
author of our righteousness, or the Lord who justifies us: by that name he
shall be known and called by his people, than which none can be sweeter.

Sixthly, The love of God is in Christ: yea, the very yearning bowels of divine
love are in him: what is Christ but the love of God wrapped up in flesh and
blood? 1 John 4. 9, 10. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, and
herein is love that God sent his Son: this is the highest (...) that ever
divine love made, and higher than this it (...) mount. O love, unparalleled and
admirable!

Seventhly, The mercies and compassions of Christ are all in Christ, Jude v.
21. Mercy is the thing that poor sinners want, it is that they cry for at the
last gasp, it is the only thing that can do them good. O what would they give to
find mercy in that great day? Why, if you receive Christ, you shall with him
receive mercy: but out of him there is no mercy to be expected from the hands
of God: for God will never exercise mercy to the prejudice of his Justice, and
it is in Christ that justice and mercy meet and embrace each other.

Eighthly, To Conclude, The salvations of God are in Christ. Acts 4. 12.
Neither is there salvation in any other. Christ is the d^r of salvation, and
Faith is the key that opens that door to men: if you therefore believe not, (i.
e.) if you so receive not Jesus Christ as God has offered him, you exclude
your selves from all hopes of salvation. The Devils have as much ground to
expect salvation as you: you see what is in Christ to induce you to receive him.

Motive 2.
Next, I beseech you confider what there is in the offer Motive 2.
of Christ to sinners, to induce you to receive him. Consider well to whom, and
how Christ is offered in the Gospel.

First, To whom he is offered: not to the fallen Angels but to you: they lie in
chains of darkness, Jude 6. as he took not their nature, so he designs not
their recovery; and therefore will have no treaty at all with them: but he is
offered to you, creatures of an inferior rank and order by nature: nor is he
offered to the damned, the treaty of peace is ended with them. Christ will
nevermake them another tender of salvation: nor is he offered to millions of
millions as good as you ^ow living in the word: the sound of Christ and
Salvation is not come to their ears; but he is offered to you by the special
favor and bounty of heaven: and will you not receive him? O then how will the
devils, the damned: and the heathens upbraid your folly! and say, had we had
one such tender of mercy of which you have had thousands, we would never have
been now in this place of torments.

Secondly, Consider how Christ is offered to you, and you shall find that he is
offered,

First, Freely, as the gift of God to your souls: you are not to purchase him,
but only to receive him, Isa. 55. 1. Ho, every one that thirsts come ye to
the waters, and he that has no money let him come, etc.

Secondly, Christ is offered importunately by repeated entreaties, 2 Cor. 5.
20. As though God did beseech you, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
reconciled to God. O what amazing condescension is here in the God of mercy!
God now beseeches you, will you not yield to the entreaties of your God? O then
what will thou say for thy self when God will not hear thee, when thou shall
entreat and cry for mercy? Which brings us to the

Motive 3.
Consider the sin and danger that there is in refusing or Motive 3.
neglecting the present offers of Christ in the Gospel, and surely there is
much sin in it: the very malignity of sin, and the sum of all misery lies
here: for in refusing Christ,

First, you put the greatest contempt and slight upon all the Attributes of God
that it is possible for a creature to do: God has made his justice, his mercy,
his wisdom, and all his attributes to shine in their brightest glory in
Christ: never was there such a display of the glory of God made to the world in
any other way.

O then, what is it to reject and despise Jesus Christ, but to offer the
greatest affront to the glory of God that it is possible for men to put upon
him?

Secondly, you hereby frustrate and evacuate the very design and importance of
the Gospel to your selves, you receive the grace of God in vain, 2 Cor. 6. 1.
as good, yea, better had it been for you, that Christ had never come into the
world, or if he had, that your lot had fallen in the dark places of the earth
where you had never heard his name: yea, good had it been for that man if he
had never been born.

Thirdly, hereby a man murders his own soul. I said therefore unto you that
you shall dye in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall dye in
your sins, Joh. 8. 24. unbelief is selfmurther: you are guilty of the blood of
your own souls: life and salvation was offered you, and you rejected it: yea,

Fourthly, The refusing of Christ by unbelief will aggravate your damnation,
above all others that perish in ignorance of Christ. O 'twill be more tolerable
for heathens than for you: the greatest measures of wrath are reserved to
punish the worst of sinners, and among sinners none will be found worse than
unbelievers.

Secondly, To Believers, this point is very useful to persuade 2.
them to diverse excellent duties: among which I shall single out two principal
ones.

Viz. 1. To bring up their faith of acceptance to the faith of assurance. 2. To
bring up their conversations to the principles and rules of faith.

First, You that have received Jesus Christ truly, give your selves no rest
till you are fully satisfied that you have done so: acceptance brings you to
heaven hereafter, but assurance will bring heaven into your souls now. O what a
life of delight and pleasure does the assured believer live! what pleasure is
it to him to look back and consider where once he was, and where now he is: to
look forward and consider where he now is! and where shortly he shall be! I was
in my sins, I am now in Christ, I am in Christ now, I shall be with Christ and
that for ever, after a few days. I was upon the very brink of hell, I am now
upon the very borders of heaven; I shall be in a little while among the
innumerable company of Angels and glorified Saints bearing part with them in
the Song of Moses and of the Lamb for evermore.

And why may not you that have received Christ, receive the comfort of your
union with him? there be all the grounds and helps to assurance furnished to
your hand: there is a real union Viget ap^d nos spei immobilis virtus and
firmitas. Cypr. Sermon de patientia.
betwixt Christ and your souls, which is the very groundwork of assurance: you
have the Scriptures before you which contain the signs of faith, and the very
things within you that answer those signs in the word. So you read, and so,
just so you might feel it in your own hearts, would you attend to your own
experience. The spirit of God is ready to seal you, it is his office and his
delight so to do: *O therefore give diligence to this work, attend the study of
the Scriptures, and of your own hearts more, and grieve not the holy Spirit of
God, and you may arrive to the very desire of your hearts.

Secondly, Bring up your conversations to the excellent principles and rules of
faith. As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, Col. 2. 6.
live as you believe: you received Christ sincerely in your first close with
him, O maintain the like seriousness and sincerity in all your ways to the end
of your lives: you received him entirely and undividedly at first, let there be
no exceptions against any of his commands afterward: you received him
exclusively to all others; see that you watch against all self-righteousness
and self-conceitedness now, and mingle nothing of your own with his blood,
whatever gifts or enlargements in duty God shall give you afterward.

You received him advisedly at first, weighing and considering the self-denying
terms upon which he was offered to you, O show that it was real, and that you
see no cause to repent the bargain, whatever you shall meet with in the ways of
Christ and duty afterward. Convince the world of your constancy and
cheerfulness in all your sufferings for Christ, that you are still of the same
mind you were, and that Christ with his cross, Christ with a prison, Christ
with the greatest afflictions is worthy of all acceptance: as you have
received him, so walk ye in him: let him be as sweet, as lovely, as precious to
you now, as he was the first moment you received him: yea, let your love to
him, delights in him, and self-denial for him, increase with your acquaintance
with him day by day.

4 Use of Direction. 4. Use.

Lastly, I will close all with a few words of direction to all that are made
willing to receive the Lord Jesus Christ: and sure it is but need that help
were given to poor Christians in this matter, it is a time of trouble, fear,
and great temptation: mistakes are easily made, and of dangerous consequence:
attend heedfully therefore to a few directions.

Direction 1.
First, In your receiving Christ beware you do not mistake Direct. 1.
the means, for the end: many do so, but see you do not: Prayer, Sermons,
Reformations are means to bring you to Christ, but they are not Christ: to
close with those duties is one thing, and to close with Christ is another
thing: if I go into a Boat, my design is not to dwell there, but to be carried
to the place whereon I desire to be landed. So it must be in this case, all
your Duties must land you upon Christ: they are but means to bring you to
Christ.

Direction 2.
Secondly, See that you receive not Christ for a present shift, Direct. 2.
but for your everlasting portion: many do so, they will enquire after Christ,
pray for Christ, cast themselves (in their way) upon Christ, and the
satisfaction of his blood; when the efficacy and terror of conscience is upon
them; and they feel the sting of guilt within them: but as soon as the storm is
over, and the rod that conscience shook over them laid by; there is no more
talk of Christ then: alas, it was not Christ but quietness that they sought:
beware of mistaking peace for Christ.

Direction 3.
Thirdly, In receiving Christ come empty handed unto him: believing in him that
justifies the ungodly, Romans 4. 5. and Direct. 3.
know that the deepest sense of your own vileness, emptiness, and unworthiness
is the best frame of heart that can accompany you to Christ: many persons stand
off from Christ for want of fit qualifications, they are not prepared for
Christ as they should be, (i. e.) they would not come naked, and empty, but
have something to commend them to the Lord Jesus for acceptance. O this is the
pride of men's hearts, and the snare of the Devil: let him that has no money
come: you are not to come to Christ because you are qualified, but that you may
be qualified with whatever you want, and the best qualification you can bring
with you, is a deep sense that you have no worth nor excellency at all in you.

Direction 4.
Fourthly, In receiving Christ, beware of dangerous delays. Direct. 4.
O follow on that work till it be finished: you read of some that are almost
persuaded, and others not far from the kingdom of God. O take heed of sticking
in the birth, Hosea 13. 13. delays here are full of danger, life is uncertain,
so are means of grace too: the manslayer needed no motives to quicken his
flight to the refuge City.

Direction 5.
Fifthly, See that you receive all Christ with all your heart: to receive all
Christ is to receive his person clothed with all Direct. 5.
his offices; and to receive him with all your heart, is to receive him into
your understanding, will, and all the affections, Acts 8. 37. As there is
nothing in Christ that may be refused, so there is nothing in you from which he
must be excluded.

Direction 6.
Lastly, Understand that the opening of your hearts to receive the Lord Jesus
Christ, is not a work done by Direct. 6.
any power of your own, but the arm of the Lord is revealed therein, Isa. 53.
1. It is therefore your duty and interest to be daily at the feet of God,
pouring out your souls to him in secret, for abilities to believe. And so much
as to our actual reception of Christ.

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The Eighth SERMON. Sermon. 8.

PSALM. 45. 7. -- Therefore God thy God, has anointed thee with Text. Setting
forth the Believers fellowship with Christ, the next end of his Application to
them.
-- the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
THe Method of grace in uniting souls with Jesus Christ, has been opened in
the former discourses, thus does the Spirit (whose office it is) make
application of Christ to Gods elect: The result and next fruit whereof is
Communion with Christ in his graces and benefits: our Mystical union is the
very groundwork and foundation of our sweet soul-enriching Communion, and
participation of spiritual privileges; we are first ingraffed into Christ, and
then suck the sap and fatness of that root: first married to the person of
Christ, then endowed and enstated in the privileges and benefits of Christ.
This is my proper work to open at this time, and from this Scripture.

The words read are a part of that excellent song of love, that heavenly
Epithalamium, wherein the spiritual espousals of Christ and the Church are
figuratively, and very elegantly Hic Psalmus propheticus est, continetque
Epithalamium quo Christi cum ecclesia nuptiae celebrantur, idemque habet
argumentum quod canticum canticorum, ejusque videtur esse Epitome. Coc. in Loc.
celebrated and shadowed. The subject matter of this Psalm is the very same
with the whole book of the Canticles: and in this Psalm under the figure of
King Solomon and the daughter of Egypt whom he espoused, the spiritual
espousals of Christ and the Church are set forth and represented to us. Among
many rapturous and elegant expressions in pra^e of this glorious bridegroom
Christ, this is one which you have before you. God thy God has anointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows: (i. e.) enriched and filled thee in
a singular and peculiar manner with the fullness of the Spirit, whereby thou art
consecrated to thy office; and by reason whereof thou out-shinest and excellest
all the Saints who are thy fellows or Copartners in these graces. So that in
these words you have two parts,

Viz. First, The Saints dignity, and Secondly, Christ's preeminency.

First, The Saints dignity which consists in this, that they are Christ's
fellows, the Hebrew word -- (...) is very full and 1. Consortes, participes,
sodales, socios.
copious, and is translated consorts, companions, copartners, partakers, or as
ours reads it, fellows, (i. e.) such as are partakers with him in the anointing
of the Spirit: who do Vox Hebr^ quodcunque societatis sive communionis genus
significat. Muis.
in their measure receive the same Spirit, every Christian being anointed, modo
sibi proportionato, with the same grace, and dignified with the same titles. 1 John 2. 27. Rev. 1. 6. Christ and the Saints are in common one with another:
does the Spirit of holiness dwell in him? so it does in them too: is Christ
King and Priest? why, so are they too by the grace of Union with him. He has
made us Kings and Priests to God, and his Father. This is the Saints dignity to
be Christ's fellows, consorts, or copartners: So that look whatever grace or
spiritual excellency is in Christ, it is not impropriated to himself, but they
do share with him; for indeed he was filled with the fullness of the Spirit for
their sakes and use: as the Sun is filled with light not to shine to it self,
but to others; so is Christ with grace: and therefore some translate the Text
not pr^ consortibus, above thy fellows, but propter consortes, for thy (...).
fellows: making Christ the first recepta^le of all grace, who first and
immediately is filled from the fountain the Godhead, but it is for his people
who receive and derive from him according to their proportion.

This is a great truth, and the dignity of the Saints lies chiefly in their
partnership with Christ, though our translation above thy fellows suits best
both with the importance of the word and scope of the place.

Secondly, But then whatever dignity is ascribed herein to the Saints, there is
and still must be a preeminency acknowledged 2.
in and ascribed to Christ: if they are anointed with the Spirit of grace, much
more abundantly is Christ: God, thy God has anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.

By the oil of gladness, understand the spirit of holiness: compared here with
oil, of which there was a double use Oleum ipsum est limpidum and pellucidum
and flammis fomentum and alimoniam suppeditat; inde sumpta metaphora ungere in
scriptura saepe significat spiritu sancto intus a^imum illustrare, and
accendere in eo veram-agnitionem dei and motus congruentes cum deo. Mollerus in
Loc.
under the Law, viz. a Civil, and a Sacred use: it had a sacred and solemn use
in the inauguration, and consecration of the Jewish Kings, and High Priests: it
had also a civil and common use, for the anointing their bodies to make their
limbs more agile, expedite and nimble: To make the face shine, for it gave a
luster, freshness, and liveliness to the countenance: it was also used in Lamps
to feed and maintain the fire, and give them light: these were the principal
uses of oil. Now, upon all these accounts it excellently expresses, and
figuratively represents to us the Spirit of grace poured forth upon Christ and
his people: For

First, By the spirit poured out upon him, he was prepared for and consecrated
to his offices, he was anointed with the holy Ghost and with power, Acts 10. 38.

Secondly, As this precious oil runs down from Christ the head to the borders
of his garments, I mean as it is shed upon believers, so it exceedingly
beautifies their faces, and makes them shine with glory.

Thirdly, It renders them apt, expedite and ready to every good work: non tar
dat unctarota.

Fourthly, It kindles and maintains the flame of divine love in their souls,
and like a lamp inlightens their minds in the knowledge of Spiritual things,
the anointing teaches them.

And this oil is here called the oil of gladness, because it is (...) dicitur
id quod causam dat summi gaudii. Grotin Heb. 1. v. 9. (...). OEcum.
the cause of all joy and gladness to them that are anointed with it: oil was
used (as you heard before) at the instalment of sovereign Princes, which was
the day of the gladness of their hearts: and among the common people it was
liberally used at all their festivals, but never upon their days of mourning:
whence it becomes excellently expressive of the nature and use of the Spirit of
grace, who is the cause and author of all joy in believers, Joh. 17. 13.

And with this oil of gladness is Christ said to be anointed above his fellows,
(i. e.) to have a far greater share of the Spirit of grace than they: for to
every one of the Saints is given grace according to the measure of the gift of
Christ, Ephesians. 4. 7. but to him the Spirit is not given by measure, Joh. 3. 34.
It has pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell, Col. 1. 19.
and of his fullness we all receive grace for grace, Joh. 1. 16. The Saints
partake with him, and through him in the same Spirit of grace, for which reason
they are his fellows, but all the grace poured out upon believers comes
exceeding short of that which God has poured out upon Jesus Christ. The words
being thus opened, give us this note.

Doct.
That all true believers have a real communion or fellowship with Doct.
the Lord Jesus Christ.

From the Saints Union with Christ, there does naturally and immediately result
a most sweet and blessed communion or fellowship with him in graces and
spiritual privileges, Ephesians. 1. 3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
places (or things) in Christ: in giving us his Son, he freely gives us all
things, Romans 8. 32. so in 1 Cor. 1. 30. of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of
God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption: and
once more, 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. all are yours, and ye are Christ's: what Christ is
and has is theirs by communication to them, or improvement for them: and this
is very evidently carried in all those excellent Scripture metaphors by which
our Union with Christ is figured and shadowed out to us: as the Marriage Union
betwixt a man and his wife, Ephesians. 5. 31, 32. You know that this conjugal union
^bi ego Cajus tu Caja. Uxor clarescit in radiis mariti.
gives the wife interest in the estate and honor of the husband, be she never
so meanly descended in her self: the natural Union betwixt the head and members
of the body, by which also the mystical union of Christ and believers is set
forth, 1 Cor. 12. 12. excellently illustrates this fellowship or communion
betwixt them: for from Christ the whole body fitly joined together, and
compacted, by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part makes increase of the body, as the
Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 4. 16. The Union betwixt the graffe and the stock which is
another emblem of our Union with Christ, Joh. 15. 1. imports in like manner
this communion or partnership betwixt Christ and the Saints. For no sooner does
the graffe take hold of the stock, but the vital sap of the stock is
communicated to the graffe, and both live by one and the same juice.

Now that the scope of this discourse be not mistaken, let the Reader know that
I am not here treating of the Saints communion or fellowship with God in
duties, as in prayer, hearing, Sacraments, etc. but of that interest which
believers have in the good things of Christ by virtue of the Mystical Union
betwixt them through faith: there is a twofold communion of the Saints with
Christ.

The first is an Act. The second is a State.
There is an actual fellowship or communion the Saints have with Christ in holy
duties: wherein Christians let forth their hearts to God by desires, and God
lets forth his comforts and refreshments again into their hearts: they open
their mouths wide, and he fills them: this communion with God is the joy and
comfort of a believers life: but I am not to speak of that here. It is not any
act of communion, but the State of communion, from which all acts of communion
flow, and upon which they all depend; that I am now to treat of: which is
nothing else but the joint interest that Christ and the Saints have in the same
things: as when a ship, an house, or estate is among many partners, or
joynt-heirs, every one of them has right to it, and interest in it, though
some of them have a greater and others a lesser part. So is it betwixt Christ
and his people: there is a (...) (i. e.) a fellowship or joint interest betwixt
them, upon which ground they are called coheirs with Christ, Romans 8. 17. This
communion or participation in Christ's benefits depends upon the Hypostatical
Union of our nature, and the mystical union of our persons with the Son of God:
in the first he partakes with us, in the second we partake with him; the former
is the remote, the later the next cause thereof.

In the explication of this point I shall speak to these four things, 1. What
are those things in which Christ and believers have fellowship. 2. By what
means they come to have such a fellowship with Christ. 3. How great a dignity
this is to have fellowship with Jesus Christ. 4. And then apply the whole in
diverse practical inferences.


First, What are those things in which Christ and believers 1.
have fellowship: to which I must speak both negatively and positively.

First, The Saints have no fellowship with Jesus Christ in Negatively.
those things that belong to him as God: such as his consubstantiality,
coequality, and coeternity with the father: it is the blasphemy of the wicked
Familists to talk of being Godded into God and Christed into Christ: neither
men or Angels partake in these things, they are the proper and incommunicable
Justitia Christi fit nostra, non quoad universalem valoremsed particularem
necessitatem, and imputatur nobis non ut causis salvationis, sed ut subjectis
salvandis. Bradshaw de justificatione.
glory of the Lord Jesus.

Secondlly, The Saints have no communion or fellowship in the honor and glory
of his mediatory works, viz. his satisfaction to God, or redemption of the
elect: it is true, we have the benefit and fruit of his mediation and
satisfaction, his righteousness also is imputed to us for our personal
justification, but we share not in the least with Christ in the glory of this
work: nor have we an inherent righteousness in us as Christ has, nor can we
justify and save others as Christ does: we have nothing to do with his
peculiar honor and praise in these things: though we have the benefit of being
saved, we may not pretend to the honor of being Saviors as Christ is to our
selves or others. Christ's righteousness is not made ours as to its universal
value, but as to our particular necessity: nor is it imputed to us as to so
many causes of salvation to others, but as to so many subjects to be saved by
it our selves.

Secondly, But then, there are many glorious and excellent Posi ively.
things which are in common betwixt Christ and believers, though in them all he
has the preeminence, he shines in the fullness of them as the Sun, and we with
a borrowed and lesser light, but of the same kind and nature as the Stars. Some
of these I shall particularly and briefly unfold in the following particulars.

First, Believers have communion with Christ in his names and titles: they are
called Christians from Christ, Ephesians. 3. 15. from him the whole family in heaven
and earth is named: this is that worthy name the Apostle speaks of, James 2. 7.
He is the son of God, and they also by their union with him have power or
authority to become the sons of God, Joh. 1. 12. He is the heir of all things,
and they are joint heirs with him, Romans 8. 17. He is both King and Priest, and
he has made them Kings and Priests, Rev. 1. 6. but they do not only partake in
the names and titles, but this communion consists in things as well as titles:
and therefore

Secondly, They have communion with him in his righteousness, (i. e.) the
righteousness of Christ is made theirs, 2 Cor. 5. 21. and he is the Lord our
righteousness, Jer. 23. 6. It Is true, the righteousness of Christ is not
inherent in us, as it is in him; but it is ours by imputation, Romans 4. 5. 11.
and our union with him is the ground of the imputation of his righteousness to
us, 2 Cor. 5. 21. we are made the righteousness of God in him, Phil. 3. 9. for
Christ and believers are considered as one person, in construction of Law; as a
man and his wife, a debtor and surety are one: and so his payment or
satisfaction is in our name, or upon our account.

Now this is a most inestimable privilege, the very ground of all our other
blessings and mercies. O what a benefit is this to a poor sinner, that owes to
God infinitely more than he is ever able to pay him, by doing or suffering; to
have such a rich treasure of merit as lies in the obedience of Christ, to
discharge in one entire payment all his debts to the least farthing? Surely
shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness, Isa. 45. 24. even as a poor
woman that owes more than she is worth, in one moment is discharged of all her
obligations, by her marriage to a wealthy man.

Thirdly, Believers have communion with Christ in his holiness or
Sanctification, for of God he is made unto them not only righteousness, but
Sanctification also: and as in the former privilege they have a stock of merit
in the blood of Christ to justify them, so here they have the Spirit of Christ
to sanctisie them, 1 Cor. 1. 30. and therefore we are said of his fullness to
receive grace for grace, Joh. 1. 16. (i. e.) say some, grace upon grace,
manifold graces or abundance of grace: or grace for grace, that is, grace
answerable to grace: as in the seal and wax, there is line for line, and cut
for cut exactly answerable to each other: or grace for grace, that is, say
others, the free grace of God in Christ for the sanctification or filling of
our souls with grace: be it in which sense it will, it shows the communion
believers have with Jesus Christ in grace and holiness. Now holiness is the
most precious thing in the world, it is the image of God, and chief excellency
of man: it is our evidence for glory, yea, and the first fruits of glory: in
Christ dwells the fullness of grace, and from him our head it is derived and
communicated to us: thus he that sanctifies and they that are sanctified are
all of one, Heb. 2. 11. You would think it no small privilege to have Baggs of
Gold to go to, and enrich your selves with, and yet that were but a very trifle
in comparison to have Christ's righteousness and holiness to go to for your
Justification and Sanctification. More particularly,

Fourthly, Believers have communion with Christ in his death: they dye with
him, Gal. 2. 20. I am crucified with Christ, (i. e.) the death of Christ has a
real killing and mortifying influence upon the lusts and corruptions of my
heart and nature: true it is he died for sin one way, and we dye to sin another
way: he dyed to expiate it, we dye to it when we mortify it: the death of
Christ is the death of sin in believers: and this is a very glorious
privilege: for the death of sin is the life of your souls: if sin do not dye
in you by mortification, you must dye for sin by eternal damnation: if Christ
had not dyed, the Spirit of God by which you now mortify the deeds of the
body, could not have been given unto you: then you must have lived Vassals to
your sins, and dyed at last in your sins: but the fruit, efficacy and benefit
of Christ's death is yours, for the killing those sins in you which else had
been your ruin.

Fifthly, Believers have Communion with Christ in his life and resurrection
from the dead: as he rose from the dead, so do they; and that by the power and
influence of his vivification and resurrection: it is the Spirit of life which
is in Christ Jesus that makes us free from the Law of sin and death, Romans 8. 2.
our spiritual life is from Christ, Ephesians. 2. 1. and you has he quickened who
were dead in trespasses and sins: and hence Christ is said to live in the
believer, Gal. 2. 20. Now I live, yet not I; but Christ lives in me: and it is
no small privilege to partake of the very life of Christ, which is the most
excellent life that ever any creature can live: yet such is the happiness of
all the Saints, the life of Christ is manifest in them, and such a life as
shall never see death.

Sixthly, To conclude, Believers have fellowship with Jesus Christ in his glory
which they shall enjoy in heaven with him: they shall be ever with the Lord, 1
These. 4. 17. and that is not all, (though as one says it were a kind of heaven
but to look through the keyhole, and have but a glimpse of Christ's blessed
face) but they shall partake of the glory which the father has given him, for
so he speaks Joh. 17. 22, 24. and more particularly they shall sit with him in
his throne, Rev. 3. 21. and when he comes to judge the world, he will come to
be glorified in the Saints, 2 These. 1. 10. So that you see what glorious and
inestimable things are and will be in common betwixt Christ and the Saints. His
Titles, his righteousness, his holiness, his death, his life, his glory. I do
not say that Christ will make any Saint equal with him in glory: that is
impossible: he will be known from all the Saints in heaven, as the Sun is
distinguished from the Stars: but they shall partake of his glory, and be
filled with his joy there: and thus you see what those things are that the
Saints have fellowship with Christ in.

Secondly, Next I would open the way and means by which 2.
we come to have fellowship with Jesus Christ in these excellent privileges;
and this I shall do briefly in the following Positions.

Position 1.
First, No man has fellowship with Christ in any special saving Position 1.
Soli vere fideles sunt membra Christi, idque non quatenus homines, sed quatenus
Christiani: nec secundum primam generationem, sed secundum reg nerationem.
Polanus Syntag. lib. 6. cap. 35.
privilege by nature, howsoever it be cultivated or improved; but only by
faith uniting him to the Lord Jesus Christ: it is not the privilege of our
first, but second birth. This is plain from Joh. 1. 12, 13. But to as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to as many
as believed on his name, who are born not of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the
will of man but of God. We are by nature children of wrath, Ephesians. 2. 3. we have
fellowship with Satan in sin, and misery: the wild branch has no communication
of the sweetness and fatness of a more noble and excellent root, until it be
ingraffed upon it, and have immediate Union and coalition with it, Joh. 15. 1,
2.

Position 2.
Believers themselves have not an equal share one with another in all the
benefits and privileges of their Union with Christ, but in Position 2.
some there is an equality, and in others an inequality: according to the
measure and gift of Christ, to every one.

In Justification they are all equal: the weak and the strong believer are
alike justified, because it is one and the same perfect righteousness of Christ
which is applied to the one and to the other, so that there are no different
degrees of Justification, but all that believe are justified from all things,
Acts 13. 39. and there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus,
Romans 8. 1. be they never so weak in faith, or defective in degrees of grace.
But there is apparent difference in the measures of their Sanctification, some
are strong men, and others are babes in Christ, 1 Cor. 3. 1. the faith of some
flourishes and grows exceedingly, 2 These. 1. 3. the things that are in others
are ready to dye, Rev. 3. 2. It Is a plain case, that there is great variety
sound in the degrees of grace and comfort among them that are jointly
interested in Christ, and equally justified by him.

Position 3.
The Saints have not fellowship and communion with Christ in the forementioned
benefits and privileges by one and the same medium, Position 3.
but by various mediums and ways according to the nature of the benefits in
which they participate.

For instance, they have partnership and communion with Christ (as has been
said) in his righteousness, holiness and glory: but they receive these distinct
blessings, by diverse mediums of communion: we have communion with Christ in his
righteousness by the way of Imputation: we partake of his holiness by the way
of infusion: and of his glory in heaven by the beatifical Vision. Our
Justification is a relative change, our sanctification a real change, our
glorification a perfect change by redemption from all the remains both of sin
and misery.

Thus has the Lord appointed several blessings for believers in Christ, and
several channels of conveying them from him to us: by imputed righteousness we
are freed from the guilt of sin, by imparted holiness we are freed from the
dominion of sin, and by our glorification with Christ we are freed from all the
relics and remains both of sin and misery let in by sin upon our natures.

Position 4.
That Jesus Christ imparts to all believers all the spiritual Position 4.
blessings that he is filled with, and withholds none from any that have Union
with him: be these blessings never so great, or they that receive them never so
weak, mean, and contemptible in outward respects. Gal. 3. 27. Ye are all the
children of God by faith in Jesus Christ. The salvation that comes by Christ is
styled the common salvation, Jude 3. and heaven the inheritance of the Saints
in light, Col. 1. 12. There is neither Greek nor Jew (says the Apostle)
Circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond or free; but Christ
is all and in all, Col. 3. 11. he means, there is no privilege in the one to
commend them to God, and no want of any thing in the other to debarr them from
God: let men have or want outward excellencies, as beauty, honor, riches,
nobility, gifts of the mind, sweetness of nature, and all such like ornaments:
what is that to God? he looks not at these things, but respects them, and
communicates his favor to them as they are in Christ: he is all, and in all.
The gifts and blessings of the Spirit are given to men as they are in Christ,
and without respect to any external differences made in this world among men:
hence we find excellent treasures of grace in mean and contemptible persons in
the world: poor in the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom: and as
all believers without difference receive from Christ, so they are not debarred
from any blessing that is in Christ: all is yours, for ye are Christ's, 1 Cor.
3. ult. with Christ God freely gives us all things, Romans 8. 32.

Position 5.
The Communion believers have with Christ in spiritual benefits Position 5.
is a very great mystery, far above the understanding of natural men. There are
no footsteps of this thing in all the works of creation, therefore the Apostle
calls it the unsearchable riches of Christ, Ephesians. 3. 8. (...): the word*
signifies that which has no footsteps to trace it by: yea, it is so deep a
mystery that the Angels themselves stoop down to look into it, 1 Pet. 1. 12.
Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the
things which God has prepared for them them that love him: but God has
revealed them unto us by his Spirit, 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10.

Thirdly and Lastly, I shall in a few particulars open the dignity and
excellency of this fruit of our Union with Christ, and show you, that a greater
glory and honor cannot be put upon man, than to be thus in fellowship with
Jesus Christ, Joh. 17. 22. The glory which thou gave me, I have given them;
that they may be one as we are one: and therefore more particularly let it be
considered

First, With whom we are associated, even the Son of God: with him that is over
all, God blessed for ever. Our association with Angels is an high advancement,
for Angels and Saints are fellow servants in the fame family, Rev. 19. 10. and
through Christ we are come to an innumerable company of Angels, Heb. 12. 22.
but what is all this to our fellowship with Jesus Christ himself; and that in
another manner than Angels have? for though Christ be to them an head of
dominion, yet not an head of vital influence as he is to his mystical body the
Church: this therefore is to them a great mystery, which they greatly affect to
study, and pry into.

Secondly, What we are that are dignified with this title, the fellows or
copartners with Jesus Christ: not only dust by nature, dust thou art, but
sinful dust; such wretched sinners as by nature, and the sentence of the Law
ought to be associated with devils, and partakers with them of the wrath of the
almighty God, to all eternity.

Thirdly, The benefits we are partakers of in and with the Lord Jesus Christ:
and indeed they are wonderful and astonishing things, so far as they do already
appear, but yet we see but little of them, comparatively to what we shall see,
1 John 3. 1, 2. Now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we
shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is. O what will that be! to see him as he is, and to be
transformed into his likeness.

Fourthly, The way and manner in which we are brought into this fellowship with
Christ, which is yet more admirable. The Apostle gives us a strange account of
it in 2 Cor. 8. 9. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though
he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through ^is poverty
might be rich: he empties himself of his glory, that we might be filled: he is
made a curse, that we might enjoy the blessing: he submits to be crowned with
thorns, that we might be crowned with glory and honor: he puts himself into
the number of worms, Psalm. 22. 6. that we might be made equal to the Angels; O
the unconceivable grace of Christ!

Fifthly, The reciprocal nature of that communion which is betwixt Christ and
believers: we do not only partake of what is his, but he partakes of what is
ours* he has fellowship with us in all our wants, sorrows, miseries, and
afflictions, and we have communion with him in his righteousness, grace,
sonship, and glory: he takes part of our misery and we take part of his
blessedness: our sufferings are his sufferings, Col. 1. 24. O what an honor is
it to thee, poor wretch, whom a great many would not turn aside to ask how thou
do, to have a King, yea, the Prince of all the Kings of the earth to pity,
relieve, sympathize, groan and bleed with thee, to sit by thee in all thy
troubles, and give thee his Cordials, to say thy troubles are my troubles, and
thy afflictions are my afflictions: whatever touches thee touches me also: O
what name shall we give unto such grace as this is?

Sixthly, and Lastly, Consider the perpetuity of this privilege: your
fellowship with Christ is interminable, and abides for ever. Christ and the
Saints shall be glorified together, Romans 8. 17. while he has any glory, they
shall partake with him. It Is said indeed 1 Cor. 15. 24. that there shall be a
time when Christ will deliver up the Kingdom to his father: but the meaning is
not that ever he will cease to be an head to his Saints, or they from being his
members: no, no, the relation never cease: Justification, Sanctification and
Adoption are everlasting things, and we can never be divested of them.

Infer. 1.
Are the Saints Christ's fellows, what honorable persons then are Infer. 1.
they! and how should they be esteemed and valued in the world! If a King who
is the fountain of honor, do but raise a man by his favor and dignifie him by
bestowing some honorable Title upon him, what respect and observance is
presently paid him by all persons? but what are all the vain and empty Titles
of honor to the glorious and substantial privileges with which believers are
dignified, and raised above all other men by Jesus Christ? he is the son of
God, and they are the sons of God also: he is the heir of all things, and they
are joynt-heirs with Christ. He reigns in glory, and they shall reign with him:
he sits upon the throne, and they shall sit with him in his throne. O that this
vile world did but know the dignity of believers, they would never slight,
hate, abuse, and persecute them as they do! and O that believers did but
understand their own happiness and privileges by Christ, they would never
droop and sink under every small trouble at t^t rate they do.

Infer. 2.
How abundantly has God provided for all the necessities and wants of
believers! Christ is a storehouse filled with blessings Infer. 2.
and mercies, and it is all for them: from him they receive abundance of grace,
and of the gift of righteousness, Romans 5. 17. of his fullness they all receive
grace for grace, Joh. 1. 16. all the fullness of Christ is made over to them for
the supply of their wants: my God shall supply all your need (says the
Apostle) according to his riches in glory by Jesus Christ, Phil. 4. 19. If all
the riches of God can supply your needs, then they shall be supplied. Say not
Christ is in the possession of consummate glory, and I am a poor creature
struggling with many difficulties, and toyling in the midst of many cares and
fears in the world; for care is taken for all thy needs: and orders given from
heaven for their supply: my God shall supply all your need. O say with a
melting heart, I have a full Christ, and he is filled for me. His pure and
perfect righteousness is to justify me, his holiness is to sanctify me, his
wisdom is to guide me, his comforts are to refresh me, his power is to protect
me, his all sufficiency is to supply me. O be cheerful, be thankful, you have
all your hearts can wish; and yet be humble, it is all from free grace to empty
and unworthy creatures.

Infer. 3.
How absurd, disingenuous and unworthy of a Christian is it to deny or
withold from Christ any thing he has, or by which he Infer. 3.
may be served or honored? Does Christ communicate all he has to you, and can
you withold any thing from Christ? On Christ's part it is not mine, and thine;
but ours, or mine and yours, Joh. 20. 17. I ascend to my Father, and your
father, to my God and your God. But O this cursed Idol Self! which impropriates
all to its own designs and uses. How liberal is Christ! and how penurious are
we to him! Some will not part with their credit for Christ, when yet Christ
abased himself unspeakably for them. Some will not part with a drop of blood
for Christ, when Christ spent the whole treasure of his blood freely for us:
yea, how loath are we to part with a shilling for Christ to relieve him in his
distressed members, when as yet we know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his
poverty might be rich! O ungrateful return! O base* and disingenuous Spirits!
The things Christ gives us are great, the things we deny to him are small: he
parts with the greatest, and yet is denied the least. The things he
communicates to us are none of ours, we have no right nor title by nature or
any desert of ours to them, the things we deny or grudge to Christ are by all
titles his own, and he has the fullest and most unquestionable title to them
all: what he gives to us he gives to them that never deserved it; what we
withold from him, we withold from one that has deserved that and
infinitely more from us, than we have, or are.

He interested you freely in all his riches when you were enemies, you stand
upon trifles with him, and yet call him your best and dearest friend: he gave
himself and all he has to you, when you could claim nothing from him, you deny
to part with these things to Christ, who may not only claim them upon the
highest title his own sovereignty, and absolute property, but by your own act,
who profess to have given all in Covenant to him: what he gives you returns no
profit to him, but what you give or part with for him, is your greatest
advantage. O that the consideration of these things might shame and humble our
souls.

Infer. 4.
Then certainly no man is or can be supposed to be a loser by conversion,
seeing from that day whatever Christ is or has becomes Infer. 4.
his.

O what an inheritance are men possessed of by their new birth! Some men cry
out, Religion will undo you, but with what eyes do these men see? surely you
could never so reckon, except your souls were so incarnated as to reckon
pardon, peace, adoption, holiness and heaven for nothing: that invisibles are
non-entities, and temporals the only realities. It Is true, the converted soul
may lose his estate, his liberty, yea, his life for Christ: but what then? are
they losers that exchange Brass for Gold? or part with their present comforts
for an hundredfold advantage, Mark 10. 29. So that none need scare at religion
for the losses that attend it, whilst Christ and heaven is gained by it: they
that count religion their loss, have their portion in this life.

Inference 5.
How securely is the Saints inheritance settled upon them, seeing they are in
commons with Jesus Christ? Christ and his Saints Infer. 5.
are joynt-heirs, and the inheritance cannot be alienated but by his consent,
he must lose his interest, if you lose yours: indeed Adams inheritance was by a
single title, and moreover, it was in his own hand, and so he might, (as indeed
he soon did) divest himself and his posterity of it: but it is not so betwixt
Christ and believers, we are secured in our inheritance by Christ our coheir,
who will never alienate it: and therefore it was truly observed by the Father,
Foelicior Job in sterquilinio, quam Adamus in Paradiso: Job was happier upon
the Dunghill, than Adam was in Paradise. The covenant of grace is certainly the
best tenure: as it has the best mercies, so it gives the fullest security to
enjoy them.

Infer. 6.
How rich and full is Jesus Christ, who communicates abundantly to all the
Saints, and yet has more still in himself than is Infer. 6.
communicated to them, although all they receive were brought into one heap!

Take all the faith of Abraham, all the meekness of Moses, all the patience of
Job, all the wisdom of Solomon, all the zeal of David, all the industry of
Paul, and all the tenderheartedness of Josiah: add to this all the grace that
is poured (though in lesser measure) into all the elect vessels in the world,
yet still it is far short of that which remains in Christ, he is anointed with
the oil of gladness above his fellows: and in all things he has, and must ever
have the preeminence: there be many thousand Stars glittering above your heads,
and one star differs from another star in glory, yet there is more light and
glory in one Sun, than in the many thousand Stars: grace beautifies the
children of men exceedingly, but still that is true of Christ, Psalm. 45. 2.
Thou art fairer than the children of men, grace is poured into thy lips: for
all grace is secondarily and derivatively in the Saints, but it is primitively,
and originally in Christ, Joh. 5. 26. Grace is imperfect and defective in them
but in him it is in its most absolute perfection and fullness, Col. 1. 19. In
the Saints it is mixed with abundance of corruption, but in Christ it is
altogether unmixed and exclusive of its opposite, Heb. 7. 26. So that as the
heathen said of moral virtue, I may much more say of Christ, That were he to be
seen with mortal eyes, he would compel love and admiration from all men, for he
is altogether lovely, Cant. 5. 16.

Infer. 7.
What delight and singular advantage must needs be in the communion of the
Saints, who have communion with Jesus Christ in all Infer. 7.
his graces and benefits!

That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have
fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his
Son Jesus Christ, 1 John 1. 3. O it is sweet to have fellowship with those that
have fellowship with God in Jesus Christ. Christ has communicated to the
Saints varieties of graces in different measures and degrees: and as they all
receive from Christ the fountain, so it is sweet and most delightful to be
improving themselves by spiritual communion one with another: yea, for that end
one is furnished with one grace more eminently than another, that the weak may
be assisted by the strong: as a Modern Divine well observes: Athanasius was
prudent and active, Basil of an heavenly Mr. Tors^ell.
sweet temper, Chrysostom laborious without affectation, Ambrose resolved and
grave, Luther courageous, and Calvin acute and judicious: thus every one has
his proper gift from Christ, the fountain of gifts and graces, 1 Cor. 7. 7. One
has quickness of parts, another solidity of judgment, but not ready and
presential; one is zealous, but ungrounded, another well principled but
timorous; one is wary, and prudent; another open, and plain; one is trembling,
and melting; another cheerful, and joyous; one must impart his light, another
his heat: the Eye, the knowing man, cannot say to the Hand, the active man, I
have no need of thee. And O how sweet would it be if gifts, graces, and
experiences were frequently, and humbly imparted: but idle notions,
earthly-mindedness, self-interests, and want of more communion with Christ,
have almost destroyed the comfort of Christian fellowship every where in the
world.

Infer. 8.
In a word, those only have ground to claim interest in Infer. 8.
Christ who do really participate of his graces, and in whom are found the
effects and fruits of their Union and communion with him.

If you have interest in Christ, you have communion in his graces and benefits,
and if you have such communion it will appear in your maintaining daily actual
communion with God in duties, whereby will be produced,

First, The increase of your Sanctification, by fresh participations from the
Fountain: as Cloth which is often dipped into the Fat receives the deeper dye,
and livelier tincture; so will your souls by assiduous communion with God. It
will also be discerned,

Secondly, In your deeper humiliation and spiritual sense of your own vileness:
the more any man partakes of God, and is acquainted with him, and assimilated
to him; the more base and vile in his own sight he still grows, Job 42. 5, 6.
Isa. 6. 5.

Thirdly, It will appear in your more vehement longings after the full
enjoyment of God in heaven, 1 Pet. 1. 8. and Romans 8. 23. you that have the
first fruits, will groan within your selves after the full harvest, and
satisfying fruition: you will not be so taken with things below, as to be
content with the best lot on earth for your everlasting portion. O if hese
communicated drops be so sweet, what is there in Christ the fountain?

And thus I have opened the method of grace in bringing home Christ and his
benefits to Gods elect by Union in order to communion with him.

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The Ninth SERMON. Sermon. 9.

MATTHEW. 11. 28. Text. Containing the first general use of Exhortation, inviting
all men to apply Jesus Christ.
Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden; and I will give you
rest.
THe Impetration of our Redemption by Jesus Christ, being finished in the first
part, and the way and means by which Christ is applied to sinners in the
foregoing part of this Treatise, I am now orderly come to the general Use of
the whole; which in the first place shall be by way of Exhortation to invite
and persuade all men to come unto Christ, who in all the former Sermons has
been represented in his garments of salvation, red in his apparel, prepared and
offered to sinners as their all-sufficient and only remedy: and in the
following Sermons will be represented in his perfumed garments coming out of
his Ivory Palaces, Psalm. 45. 8. to allure and draw all men unto him.

For a general head to this Use which will be large, I have chosen this
Scripture, Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest.

These words are the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, in which there is
a vital ravishing sound: it is your mercy to have such a joyful sound in your
ears this day: and in them I will consider their dependence, parts and scope.

As to their dependence it is manifest they have an immediate relation to the
foregoing verse, wherein Christ opens his Commission and declares the fullness
of his authority and saving power, and the impossibility of coming to God any
other way: all things are delivered to me of my Eather, and no man knows the
Son but the Father: neither knows any man the Father save the Son, and he to
whomsoever the Son will reveal him, v. 27.

This 28 verse is brought in proleptically to obviate the discouragements of
any poor convinced and humbled soul, who might thus object, Lord, I am fully
satisfied of the fullness of thy saving power, but greatly doubt whether ever I
shall have the benefit thereof. For I see so much sin and guilt in my self, so
great vileness, andutter unworthiness, that I am over-weighed and even sink
under the burden of it: my soul is discouraged because of sin. This objection
is prevented in the words of my Text, Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, Q. d. let not the sense of your sin and misery drive you from your
only remedy: be your sins never so many, and the sense and burden of them
never so heavy; yet for all that, come unto me: you are the persons whom I
invite and call. I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.

In the words three things are especially remarkable.

1. The souls spiritual distress and burden: weary and heavy laden. 2. Its
invitation to Christ under that barthen, come unto me. 3. Its encouragement to
that great duty, I will give you rest.
First, The souls spiritual distress and burden, expressed in 1. (...) qui
laboratis, scil. ad defatigationem usque hac enim Emphasi differt To (...) a
verbo (...) quod in genere significat laborare. Piscator in Loc. (i. e.) Qui
sentitis ^nus peccatorum and sub illo tant^ non succumbitis. Chrysostomus
intelligit oneratos legalib^ oneribus, nos vero in genere intelligimus
universos eos qui peccatorum pondere, naturaeque corruptae malitia quam
sentiunt pressi, ad ejiciendam pravitatem and assequendam justitiam lucta t ur.
Mu^ c^lus in Loc.
two very Emphatical words, (...), ye that labor and are heavy laden: the word
which we translate labor signifies a laboring even to faintness and tiring,
to the consumption and wast of the spirits: and the other word signifies such a
pressure by a burden that is too heavy to be born that we do even sink down
under it.

There is some difference among expositors about the quality of this burden.
Chrysostom. and some others after him expound it of burden of the legal rites and
Ceremonies, which was a heavy burden indeed such as neither they, nor their
fathers could bear: under the task and burden of these legal observances they
did sweat and toil to obtain a righteousness to justify them before God, and
all in vain; and this is a pious sense, but others expound it of the burden of
sin in general; the corruption of nature, and evils of practice, which souls
are convinced have brought them under the curse, and will bring them to hell,
and therefore labor and strive all that in them lies, by repentance and
reformation to clear themselves from it, but all in vain; whilst they strive
in their own strength. Such are they that are here called to come to Christ,
which is the second thing, namely

Secondly, The Invitation of burdened souls to Christ. Come unto me all ye
that labor, and are heavy laden: come unto me, (i. e.) believe in me, lean and
rest your burdened souls upon me. I am able to ease all your burdens, in me
is that righteousness and peace which you seek in vain in all the legal rites
and Ceremonies: or in your repentance, reformations and duties, but it will
give you no ease, 'twill be no benefit to you except you come unto me. Faith is
often expressed under this notion, see Joh. 6. 37. and Joh. 7. 37. 2.
and it is to be further noted that [all] burdened souls are invited to come.
All ye that labor: whatever your sin or guilt has been, whatever your fears
or discouragements are, yet come (i. e.) believe in me.

Thirdly, Here is the encouragement Christ gives to this duty, And I will give
you rest: (...) -- I will refresh you, 3. Quid alibi quaeritis, quod non licet
invenire? ego is sum qui possum vos juvare solus. Musc. in Loc.
I will give you rest from your labor, your Consciences shall be pacified,
your heart at rest and quiet in that pardon, peace and favor of God which I
will procure for you by my death. But here it must be heedfully noted, that
this promise of rest in Christ is not made to men simply as they are sinners,
nor yet as they are burdened, and heavy laden sinners: but as they come to
Christ, (i. e.) as they are believers. For let a man break his heart with sin,
let him weep out his eyes for sin, let him mourn as a dove, and shed as many
tears for sin (if it were possible) as ever there fell drops of rain upon the
ground, yet if he come not to Christ by faith, his repentance shall not save
him, nor all his sorrows bring him to true rest.

Hence Note,

Doct. 1. That some souls are heavy laden with the burdensome sense of sin.
Doct. 1.
Doct. 2. That all burdened souls are solemnly invited to come to Christ.
Doct. 2.
Doct. 3. That there is rest in Christ for all that come to him under the heavy
burden of sin. Doct. 3.

Doct. 1.
Some souls are heavy laden with the burdensome sense of sin.

I Do not say all are so, for fools make a mock of sin, Prove. Doct. 1.
14. 9. it is so far from being burdensome to some, that it is a sport to them,
Prove. 10. 23. but when a man's eyes are opened to see the evil that is in sin,
and the eternal misery that follows it, (sin and hell being linkt together with
such strong chains as nothing but the blood of Christ can loose) then no
burden is like that of sin: a wounded conscience who can bear? Prove. 18. 14.
For let us but consider the efficacy that the Law of God has upon the
consciences of men, when it comes in the spirituality and power of it to
convince and humble the soul of a sinner. For then

First, The memory of sin long since committed is refresht and revived as if it
had been but yesterday: there are fresh recognitions 1. What inward troubles
for sin are.
of sin long since acted, and forgotten, as if they had never been: what was
done in our youth is fetched back again, and by a new impression of fear and
horror set home upon the trembling conscience. Job 13. 26. Thou writest bitter
things against me, and make me to possess the sins of my youth. Conscience
can call back the days that are past, and draw up a new charge upon the score
of old sins, Genesis 42. 21. all that ever we did is recorded and entered into the
book of Conscience, and now is the time to open that book, when the Lord will
convince and awaken sinners: we read in Job 14. 17. of sealing up iniquities in
a bag, which is an allusion to the Clerk of the Assizes, that takes all the
indictments that are made against persons at the Assizes, and seals them up in
a bag, in order to a Trial. This is the first office and work of conscience,
upon which

The second, namely its Accusations, do depend: these accusations of Conscience
are terrible things, who can stand 2.
before them? they are full, they are clear, and all of them referring to the
approaching Judgment of the great and terrible God.

Conscience dives into all sins, secret as well as open, and Prima est haec
ultio, quod se judice, nemo uocens absolvitur.
into all the circumstances and aggravations of sin, as being committed against
light, against mercy, against the strivings, warnings, and regretts of
conscience. So that we may say of the efficacy of conscience as it is said
Psalm. 19. 6. of the influence of the Sun, nothing is hid from the heat or power
thereof. Come (says the woman of Samaria) see a man that has told me all that
ever I did, Joh. 4. 29, Christ convinced her but of one sin by that discourse,
but conscience by that one fetched in and charged all the rest upon her. And as
the accusations of conscience are full, so they are clear, and undeniable: a
man becomes self-convinced, and there remains no shift, excuse, or plea to
defend himself: a thousand witnesses cannot prove any point more clearly than
one testimony of conscience does, Matthew. 22. 12. the man was speechless, (...)
and ille capistratus er at.
a mute; muzzled (as the word signifies) by the clear testimony of his own
conscience: these accusations are the second work or office of conscience, and
they make way for the third, namely,

Thirdly, The sentence and condemnation of Conscience: and truly this is an
insupportable burden: the condemnation 3.
of conscience is nothing else but its application of the condemning sentence
of the Law to a man's person: the Law curses every one that transgresses it,
Gal. 3. 10. conscience applys this curse to the guilty sinner. So that it
sentences the sinner in Gods name and authority, from which there is no appeal:
the voice of conscience is the voice of God, and what it pronounces in Gods
name and authority, he will confirm and ratify, 1 John 3. 20. if our hearts
(i. e.) our consciences, condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and
knows all things: this is that torment which no man can endure. See the
effects of it in Cain, in Judas, and in Spira, it is a real foretast of hell
torments: this is that worm that never dies, Mark 9. 44. For look as a worm in
the body is bred of the corruption that is there, so the accusations and
condemnations of conscience are bred in the soul by the corruption and guilt
that is there: as the worm in the body preys and bites upon the tender sensible
inward parts, so does conscience touch the very quick. This is its third effect
or work to sentence and condemn, and this also makes way for a fourth, namely,

Fourthly, To upbraid and reproach the sinner under his misery: 4.
and this makes a man a very terror to himself: to be pitied in misery is
some relief, but to be upbraided and reproached doubles our affliction: you
know it was one of the aggravations of Christ's sufferings, to be reproached by
the tongue of his enemies, whilst he hanged in torments upon the cursed tree:
but all the scoffs and reproaches, the bitter jeers and Sarcas^s in the world
are nothing to these of a man's own conscience: this will cut to the very bone.

O when a man's conscience shall say to him in a day of trouble, as Reuben to
his afflicted brethren, Genesis 42. 22. Spoke I not unto you saying, do not sin
against the child: and ye would not hear, therefore behold also his blood is
required. So conscience, Did I not warn you, threaten you, persuade you in time
against these evils? but you would not hearken to me, therefore behold now you
must suffer to all eternity for it: the wrath of God is kindled against thy
soul for it: this is the fruit of thy own wilful madness and obstinacy. Now
thou shall know the price of sinning against God, against light, and
conscience. O this is terrible! every bite of conscience makes a poor soul to
startle, and in a terrible fright to cry, Oh the worm! Oh the bitter foretast
of Hell! a wounded spirit who can bear?

This is a fourth wound of conscience, and it makes way for a fifth, for here
it is as in the pouring out of the vials, and the sounding of those
woe-trumpets in the Revelation, one woe is past, and another comes. After all
these deadly blows of conscience upon the very heart of a sinner, comes another
as dreadful as any that is yet named, and that is,

Fifthly, The fearful expectations of wrath to come which 5.
it begets in the soul of a guilty sinner: of this you read Heb. 10. 27. a
fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery indignation: and this makes the
stoutest sinner quail and faint under the burden of sin. For the tongue of man
cannot declare what it is to lie down and rise with those fearful expectations:
the case of such sinners is somewhat like that which is described in Deuteronomy. 28.
65, 66, 67. The Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of
eyes, and sorrow of mind, and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and
thou shall fear day and night, and shall have no assurance of thy life: in the
morning thou shall say Would God it were evening, and at even thou shall say
Would God it were morning, for the fear of thine heart, wherewith thou shall
fear, etc. Only in this it differs, in this Scripture you have the terrors of
those described, whose temporal life hangs in doubtful suspense, but in the
persons I am speaking of it is a trembling under the apprehensions and
expectations of the vengeance of eternal fire.

Believe it Friends, words cannot express what those poor creatures feel, that
lie down and rise under these fears and frights of conscience. Lord what will
become of me! I am free among the dead, yea, among the damned. I hang by the
frail thread of a momentany life, which will and must break shortly, and may
break the next moment, over the everlasting burnings: no pleasant bread is
eaten in these days, but what is like the bread of condemned men.

And thus you see what the burden of sin is, when God makes it to bear upon the
consciences of men, no burden of affliction is like it: losses of dearest
relations: sorrows for an only son are not so pungent, and penetrating as
these, For

First, No creature enjoyment is pleasant under these inward troubles: in other
troubles they may signify something to a man's relief, but here they are
nothing, the wound is too deep to be healed by any thing but the blood of Jesus
Christ: Conscience requires as much to satisfy it, as God requires to satisfy
him. When God is at peace with thee (says Conscience) then will I be at peace
with thee too; but till then, expect no rest nor peace from me: all the
pleasures and diversions in the world shall never stop my mouth: go where thou will, I will follow thee like thy shadow: be thy portion in the world as sweet
as it will, I will drop in Gall and Wormwood into thy cup, that thou shall taste
no sweetness in any thing, till thou have got thy pardon.

These inward troubles for sin, alienate the mind from all former pleasures and
delights, there is no more taste or savor in them, than in the white of an Egg.
Music is out of tune, all instruments jarr and groan. Ornaments have no
beauty, what heart has a poor creature to deck that body, in which dwells such
a miserable soul! to feed and pamper that carcass that has been the souls
inducement to, and instrument in sin, and must be its companion in everlasting
misery.

Secondly, These inward troubles for sin, put a dread into death beyond
whatever the soul saw in it before. Now it looks like the King of terrors
indeed: you read in Heb. 2. 15. of some that through fear of death are all
their life long subject to bondage. O what a lively comment is a soul in this
case able to make upon such a Text? they would not scare at the pale horse, nor
at him that sits on him though his name be called death, if it were not for
what follows him, Rev. 6. 8. but when they consider that hell follows, they
tremble at the very name, or thoughts of death.

Thirdly, Such is the nature of these inward troubles of spirit that they
swallow up the sense of all other outward troubles: alas these are all lost in
the deeps of soul sorrows as the little rivulets are in the vast Sea: he that
is wounded at the heart, will not cry Oh at the bite of a Flea: and surely no
greater is the proportion betwixt outward and inward sorrows: a small matter
formerly would discompose a man, and put him into a fret, now ten thousand
outward troubles are lighter than a feather. For, says he, why does the living
man complain? am I yet on this side eternal burnings? O let me not complain
then, whatever my condition be: have I losses in the world, or pains upon my
body? alas these are not to be named with the loss of God, and the feeling of
his wrath and indignation for evermore. Thus you see what troubles inward
troubles for sin be.

Secondly, If you ask in the second place, how it comes 2. How souls are
supported under such troubles.
to pass that any soul is supported under such strong troubles of Spirit that
all that feel them do not sink under them; that all that go down into these
deep waters of sorrow, are not drowned in them: The Answer is,

First, Though this be a very sad time with the soul (much like that of Adam,
betwixt the breach of the first Covenant, and the first promise of Christ made
to him) yet the souls that are thus heavy laden do not sink, because God has a
most tender care over them, and regard to them: underneath them are the
everlasting arms, and thence it is they sink not: were they left to grapple
with these troubles in their own strength, they could never stand: but God
takes care of these mourners that their Spirits do not fail before him, and the
souls that he has made, I mean those of his Elect whom he is this way
preparing for, and bringing unto Christ.

Secondly, The Lord is pleased to nourish still some hope in the soul under the
greatest fears and troubles of Spirit: though it have no comfort or joy, yet it
has some hope in the bottom and that keeps up the heart: the afflicted soul
does in this case as the afflicted Church, Lam. 3. 29. he puts his mouth in
the dust if yet there may be hope: he says, its good for a man to hope, and
quietly to wait for the salvation of God: there are usually some glimmerings or
dawnings of mercy through Christ in the midnight darkness of inward troubles:
non dantur purae tenebrae, in hell indeed there is no hope to enlighten the
darkness, but it is not so upon earth.

Thirdly, The experiences of others who have been in the same deeps of trouble
are also of great use to keep up the soul (...) ut and (...) est primum
picturae lineamentum: sumitur hic pro exemplo, ut viderent quid sibi sp^randum
sit (...) domino: gratiam esse uberiorem ac potentiorem peccato^ quis qui
credit diffidereti sibi paratam esse veniam. Poli Synops. in Loc.
above water. The experience of another is of great use to prop up a desponding
mind, whilst as yet it has none of its own: and indeed for the support of
souls in such cases they were recorded 1 Timothy 1. 16. For this cause I obtained
mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long suffering for a
pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting: for
an encouraging pattern, an eminent precedent to all poor sinners that were to
come after him: that none might absolutely despair of finding mercy through
Christ. You know if a man be taken sick, and none can tell what the disease is,
none can say that ever they heard of such a disease before, it is exceeding
frightful; but if one and another, it may be twenty, come to the sick man's
bedside and tell him, Sir, be not afraid, I have been in the very same case
that you now are, and so have many more, and all did well at last, why this is
half a cure to the sick man. So it is here a great support to hear the
experiences of other Saints.

Fourthly, As the experiences of others support the soul under these burdens,
so the riches of free grace through Jesus Christ uphold it: it is rich and
abundant, Psalm. 130. ult. plenteous redemption, and it is free and to the worst
of sinners, Isa. 1. 18. and under these troubles it finds it self in the way
and proper method of mercy, for so my Text (a Text that has upheld many
thousand drooping hearts) states it: all this gives hope, and encouragement
under trouble.

Fifthly, Lastly, Though the state of the soul be sad and sinking, yet Jesus
Christ usually makes haste in the extremity of the trouble to relieve it, by
sweet and seasonable discoveries of his grace: cum duplicantur lateres, venit
Moses: in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen. It is with Christ as it was
with Joseph whose bowels yearned toward his brethren, and he was in pain till
he had told them I am Joseph your brother. This is sweetly exhibited to us in
that excellent parable of the Prodigal, Luke 15. when his Father saw him, being
yet a great way off, he ran and fell upon his neck and kissed him: mercy runs
nimbly to help when souls are ready to fail under the pressure of sin. And thus
you see both how they are burdened, and how upheld under the burden.

Thirdly, If it be enquired in the last place, why God makes the burden of sin
press so heavy upon the hearts of poor 3. Why does God make the burden of sin
lie so heavy upon the souls of some sinners.
sinners, it is answered,

First, He does it to divorce their hearts from sin, by giving them an
experimental taste of the bitterness and evil that is in sin: men's hearts are
naturally glewed with delight to their sinful courses: all the persuasions and
arguments in the world are too weak to separate them and their beloved lusts.
The morsels of sin go down smoothly and sweetly: they roll them with much
delectation under their tongues; and it is but need that such bitter potions as
these should be administered to make their stomachs rise against sin, as that
word used by the Apostle in 2 Cor. 7. 11. signifies, in that ye (...)
indignatio, stomochatio. Leigh's Critica, in verb.
sorrowed after a godly sort, what indignation it wrought: it notes the rising
of the stomach with rage, a being angry even unto sickness, and this is the
way, the best and most effectual way to separate the soul of a sinner from his
Lusts: for in these troubles conscience says, as it is in Jer. 4. 18. Thy way
and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness,
because it is great, because it reaches unto thy heart.

Secondly, The Lord does this, to make Jesus Christ most welcome and desirable
to the soul. Christ is not sweet, till sin be made bitter to us. Matthew. 9. 12.
They that be whole need not a Physician, but they that be sick. If once God
wound the heart of a sinner with the stinging sense of sin, then nothing in the
world is so precious, so necessary, so vehemently desired, and panted for, as
Jesus Christ. O that I had Christ, if I did go in rags, if I did feed upon no
other food all my days, but the bread and water of affliction! This is the
language of a soul filled with the sense of the evil of sin.

Thirdly, The Lord does this to advance the riches of his free grace in the
eyes of sinners. Grace never appears Grace, till sin appear to be sin. The
deeper our sense of the evil of sin is, the deeper our apprehensions of the
free grace of God in Christ will be. The louder our groans have been under the
burden of sin, the louder will our acclamations and praises be for our
salvation from it by Jesus Christ. To me (says Paul) the chiefest of sinners
was this grace given, 1 Timothy 1. 15. Never does the grace of a Prince melt the
heart of a Traitor, as when Trial, Sentence, and all preparations for his
execution have past, before his unexpected pardon comes.

Fourthly, The Lord does this to prevent relapses into sin: In that ye sorrowed
after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought! 2 Cor. 2. 7. The burnt Child
dreads the fire; the Bird that is delivered out of the Tallons of the Hawk,
trembles afterward at the noise of his Bells. After such a deliverance as this,
should we again break thy Commandments? Ezra 9. 13, 14. Ask a poor penitent
soul, that has been in the deeps of sorrow for sin, Will you return to your
former course of sin again? and it sounds in his ears, as if you should ask
him, Will you run into the fire, will you go to the Rack again? No^o tanti
emere poenitentiam.
O no: it has cost him dear already.

Fifthly, Lastly, This the Lord does, to make them both skilful and
compassionate in relieving others that are under like inward troubles. None can
speak so judiciously, so pertinently, so feelingly to another case, as he that
has been in the Haud ignara mali, miseris ^currere disco. Dido.
same case himself: this furnishes them with the tongue of the learned, to
speak a word in season to the weary soul: By this means they are able to
comfort others with the same comforts wherewith they themselves have been
comforted of God, 2 Cor. 1. 4.

Thus you have had a brief account, what the burden of sin is, how souls are
supported under that burden, and why the Lord causes sin to lie so heavy upon
the souls of some sinners. The improvement of all will be in a double Use: viz.

of Information, and Direction.

First Use for Insormation.
Inference 1. Use.

Is there such a load and burden in sin? What then was the Inference 1.
burden that our Lord Jesus Christ felt and bare for us, upon whom the dead
weight of all the sins of all Gods elect lay! Isa. 53. 6. He has made the
iniquities of us all to meet on him. Our burden is heavy, but nothing to
Christ. O there is a vast difference betwixt that which Christ bare, and that
which we bear. We feel but the single weight of our own sins. Christ felt the
whole weight of all our sins. You do not feel the whole weight that is in any
one sin: alas, it would sink you, if God should let it bear in all its
aggravations and effects upon you, Psalm. 130. 2, 3. If thou Lord should mark
iniquity, O Lord who shall stand! You would quail and sink presently: you can
no more stand under it, than under the weight of a mighty Mountain. But Christ
bare all the burden upon himself: his understanding was deep and large: he knew
the extent of its evil, which we do not: we have many reliefs and helps under
our burden, he had none: we have friends to counsel, comfort and pity us; all
his friends and familiars forsook him and fled in the day of his trouble: we
have comforts from heaven, he had frowns from heaven: My God, my God (says he
in that doleful day) why have thou forsaken me? there is no compare betwixt our
load and Christ's.

Inference 2.
If there be such a burden in sin, Then certainly sinners will pay Inscrence 2.
dear for all the pleasure they find in sin in the days of their vanity. What
one says of crafty counl^s, we may say of Consilia callida prima specie laeta;
tractatu dura; aventu tristia. Livy.
all sins; though they seem pleasant in their first appearance, they will be
found sad in the event: they are honey in the mouth, but the gall of Asps in
the belly: they tickle the fancy, but rend the conscience. O sinner, thy mirth
will certainly be turned into mourning, as sure as thou live, that vain and
frothy breast of thine shall be wounded: thou shall feel the s^ing and pain, as
well as relish the sweet and pleasure of sin. O that thou would but give thy
self the leisure seriously to ponder those Scriptures in the Margent: Prove. 20.
7. Prove. 23. 31, 32. Job 20. 12, 13, 14. James 1. 15. Romans 6. 21.
me thinks they should have the same effect that the handwriting upon the
plaster of the wall had upon that Jovial King in the height of a frolic, Dan.
5. 5. Reason thus with thine own heart, and thou will find the conclusion
unavoidable: Either I shall repent for sin, or I shall not: if I shall not,
then must I howl under the wrath of God for sin in the lowest Hell for
evermore. If I shall, then by what I have now read of the throbs and wounds of
conscience, I see what this heart of mine, this vain heart of mine must feel in
this world. O how much wiser was the choice that Moses made, Heb. 11. 25. the
worst of sufferings, rather than the best of sin, the pleasures of sin which
are but for a season!

Inference 3.
Is there such a burden in sin, Then the most tender compassion Inference 3.
is due debt to souls afflicted and heavy laden with sin. Their condition cries
for pity, whatever their tongues do: they seem to call upon you, as Job upon
his friends, Have pity, have pity upon me, O ye my friends, for the hand of God
has touched me, Job 19. 21. and O let all that have felt the wounds and
anguish of an afflicted conscience themselves, learn from their own experience
tenderly to pity and help others, (...), luxata membra in suum locum restituere.
Gal. 6. 1. You that are spiritually minded restore (or set him in joint again)
in the spirit of meekness, considering thy self.

Israel was commanded to be kind to strangers, for says God, you know the
heart of a stranger: and surely if any case in the world require help, pity and
all compassionate tenderness, this does: and yet how do some slight spiritual
troubles upon others? Parents slight them in their own children, Masters in
their servants; the more brutish and wicked they. O had you but felt your
selves what they feel, you would never handle them as you do. But let this
comfort such poor creatures, Christ has felt them, and will pity and help
them; yea, he therefore would feel them himself, that he might have compassion
upon you. If men will not, God will pity you: if men be so cruel to persecute
him whom God has smitten, God will be so kind, to pour balm into the wounds
that sin has made: if they pull away the shoulder from you, and will not be
concerned about your troubles, except it be to aggravate them, God will not
serve you so: but certainly you that have past through the same difficulties,
you cannot be without compassion to them that are now grapling with them.

Inference 4.
How unexpressibly dreadful is the state of the damned, who must bear the
burden of all their sins upon themselves without relief or Inference 4.
hope of deliverance! Mark 9. 44. where their worm dies not, and the fire is
not quenched.

O if sin upon the soul that is coming to Christ for deliverance be so
burdensome, what is it upon the soul that is shut out from Christ, and all
hopes of deliverance for ever! For do but ponder these differences betwixt
these two burdens.

First, No soul is so capacious now, to take in the fullness of the evil and
misery of sin, as they are, who are gone down to the place of torments. Even as
the joys of Gods face above are much unknown to them that have the foretastes
and first fruits of them here by faith; so the misery of the damned is much
unknown, even to them that have in their consciences now the bitterest taste
and sense of sin in this world: as we have the visions of heaven, so we have
the visions of hell also but darkly through a glass.

Secondly, No burden of sin presses so continually upon the soul here, as it
does there: afflicted souls on earth have intermissions and breathing times;
but in hell there are no Lucid intervals: the wrath of God there is still
flowing: it is in fluxu continu^, Isa. 30. 33. a stream of brimstone.

Thirdly, No burden of sin lies upon any of Gods elect so long, as the damned
do and must bear it: our troubles about sin are but short, though they should
run parallel with the line of life; but the troubles of the damned are parallel
with the endless line of eternity.

Fourthly, Under these troubles the soul has hope, but there all hope is cut
off: all the Gospel is full of hope; it breathes nothing but hope to sinners
that are moving Christward under their troubles: but in hell the pangs of
desperation rend their consciences for ever. So that upon all accounts the
state of the damned is inexpressibly dreadful.

Inference 5.
If the burden os sin be so heavy, how sweet then must the Inference 5.
pardon of sin be to a sin-burdened soul! Is it a refreshment to a prisoner, to
have his chains knocked off? a comfort to a debtor, to have his debts paid, and
obligations cancelled? What joy must it then be to a sin-burthened soul, to
hear the voice of pardon and peace in his trembling conscience? Is the light of
the morning pleasant to a man after a weary tiresome night? the Spring of the
year pleasant after a hard and tedious Winter? they are so indeed; but nothing
so sweet, as the favor, peace and pardon of God to a soul that has been long
restless and anxious under the terrors and fears of conscience: for though
after pardon and peace a man remembers sin still, yet it is as one that
remembers the dangerous pits and deep waters from which he has been
wonderfully delivered, and had a narrow escape. O the unconceivable sweetness
of a pardon! Who can read it, and not wet it with tears of joy? Are we glad
when the grinding pain of the Stone, or racking fits of the Colic are over?
and shall we not be transported, when the accusations and condemnations of
conscience are over? Tongue cannot express what these things are; this joy is
something that no words can convey to the understanding of another, that never
felt the anguish of sin.

Inference 6.
Lastly, In how sad a case are those that never felt any burden in Inference 6.
sin, that never were kept waking and restless one night for sin?

There is a burdened conscience, and there is a benumbed conscience. The first
is more painful, but the last more dangerous. O it is a fearful blow of God upon
a man's soul, to strike it senseless and stupid, so that though mountains of
guilt lie upon it, it feels no pain or pressure: and this is so much the more
sad, because it incapacitates the soul for Christ, and is a presage and
forerunner of hell. It would grieve the heart of a man, to see a delirious
person in the rage and height of a fevor, to laugh at those that are weeping
for him, call them fools, and telling them, he is as well as any of them: much
so is the case of many thousand souls, the God of mercy pity them.

Second Use for Counsel.
The only further Use I shall make of this Point here, shall Use 2.
be to direct and counsel souls that are weary and heavy laden with the burden
of sin, in order to their obtaining true rest and peace. And first,

do so, but it is never the near. I grant it is lawful in spiritual distresses to
complain to men; yea, and it is a great mercy if we have any near us in times
of trouble, that are judicious, tender and faithful, into whose bosoms we may
pour out our troubles: but to rest in this short of Christ, is no better than a
snare of the Devil to destroy us. Is there not a God to go to in trouble? The
best of men in the neglect of Christ are but Physicians of no value. Be wise
and wary in your choice of Christian friends to whom you open your complaints:
some are not clear themselves in the doctrine of Christ and faith, others are
of a dark and troubled spirit as you are, and will but entangle you more. As
for me (says Job) is my complaint to man, and if it were so, why should not my
spirit be troubled? Job 21. 4. One hour betwixt Christ and thy soul in secret,
will do more to thy true relief, than all other counselors and comforters in
the world can do.

Second Counsel.
Beware of a false peace, which is more dangerous than your trouble for sin can

but I think they have more cause to fear their peace a great deal. There is a
twofold peace that ruins most men. Peace in sin, and peace with sin. O how
glad are some persons when their troubles are gone, but I dare not rejoice with
them: It Is like him that rejoices his Ague is gone, though it has left him in
a deep Consumption. You are got rid of your troubles, but God knows how you
have left them: your wounds are skinn'd over, better they were kept open.
There Is no wise woman would desire to have her pains and throes cease till the

delusions, healing the hurt of souls slightly, by crying peace, peace, when
there is no peace. The false peace you beget in them, will be a real trouble to
your selves in the issue, Jer. 6. 14.

drawing desperate conclusions against themselves and the final state of their
own souls. Though your case be sad, it is not desperate: though the night be
troublesome and tedious, keep on in the way to Christ, and light will spring
up. To mourn for sin is your duty; to conclude there is no hope for you in
Christ, is your sin. You have wronged God enough already, do'nt add a farther
and greater abuse to all the rest, by an absolute despair of mercy. 'Twas your
sin formerly to presume beyond any promise, it is your sin now to despair
against many commands. I would say as the Apostle in another case, I would not
have you mourn as men that have no hope: your condition is sad as it is, but
yet it is much better than once it was: you were once full of sin, and void of
sense; now you have the sense of sin which is no small mercy: you were once
quite out of the way and method of mercy, now you are in that very path wherein
mercy meets the elect of God. Keep hope therefore at the bottom of all your
troubles.

Fourth Counsel.
Observe whether your troubles for sin produce such fruits and effects in your

everlasting peace.

First, One that is truly burdened with sin, will not allow himself to live in
the secret practice of sin: either your trouble will put an end to your course
of sinning, or your sinning will put an end to your troubles. Consult 2 Cor. 7.
11.

Secondly, True sorrow for sin will give you very low and vile thoughts of your
selves: as you were covered with pride before, so you will be covered with
shame after God has convinced and humbled you, Romans 6. 21.

Thirdly, A soul really burdened with sin, will never stand in his own
justification before God, nor extenuate and mince it in his confessions to him,
Psalm. 51. 3, 4.

Fourthly, The burdens of sin will make a man set light by all other burdens of
affliction, Lam. 3. 22. Mic. 7. 9. The more you feel sin, the less you feel
affliction.

Fifthly, A soul truly burdened for sin, will take no hearty joy or comfort in
any outward enjoyment of this world, till Christ come and speak peace to the
soul, Lam. 3. 28. Just so the soul sits alone and keeps silence; merry
company is a burden, and music is but howling to him.

Beware of those things that make your troubles longer than they 5. Counsel.
ought to be. There be several errors and mistakes that hold poor souls much
longer in their fears and terrors than else they might be: And such are,

First, Ignorance of the nature of saving faith, and the necessity of it: till
you come to believe, you cannot have peace, and while you mistake the nature,
or apprehend not the necessity of faith, you are not like to fall into that
path of peace.

Secondly, Laboring to heal the wounds that the Law has made upon your
consciences by a more strict obedience to it for the future, in the neglect of
Christ and his righteousness.

Thirdly, Inobservance of what God has already done for you, in these
preparatory works of the Law in order to your salvation by Jesus Christ. O if
you would but compare what you now are, with what you lately were, it would
give some relief: but the last and principal thing is this:

Sixth Counsel.
Hasten to Christ in the way of faith, and you shall find rest; and till then

you transact with Christ in the way of faith, the sooner you shall be at
peace, and enter into his rest: for those that believe, do now enter into rest.
You may tugg and strive, look this way and that, but all in vain; Christ and
peace come together. No sooner do you come to him, and roll your burden on him,
receive him as he offers himself, but the soul feels it self eased on a
sudden, being justified by faith we have peace with God, Romans 5. 1. And thus
in finishing the first, we are brought home to the second Observation.

Doct. 2. Doct. 2.

That Sin-burdened souls are solemnly invited to come to Christ.

THIS Point sounds sweetly in the ear of a distressed sinner, it is the most
joyful voice that ever the soul heard; the voice of blessing from Mount
Gerezim, the ravishing voice from Mount Sion, Ye are come to Jesus the
Mediator. In opening of it I will show,

1. What it is to come to Christ. 2. How Christ invites men to come to him. 3.
Why his invitation is directed to burdened souls.
First, We will enquire what it is to come to Christ, and 1.
how many things are involved in it.

In general, To come to Christ, is a phrase aequipollent, or of the same amount
with believing in Christ. It is an expression that carries the nature and
necessity of faith in it, and is reciprocated with believing, John 6. 35. He
that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes in me shall never
thirst. Coming to Christ, is believing in Christ; and believing in Christ, is
coming to Christ: they are Synonyma's, and import the self same thing: only in
this notion of faith there are many rich and excellent things hinted to us,
which no other word can so aptly convey to our minds: as,

First, It hints this to us, That the souls of convinced and burdened sinners,
do not only discern the reality of Christ, or that he is; but also the
necessity of applying Christ, and that their eternal life is in their union
with him: for this is most certain, that the object of faith must be
determinate and fixed; the soul must believe that Christ is, or else there can
be no emotions of the soul after him: all coming presupposes a fixed term to
which we come, Heb. 11. 6. He that comes to God, must believe that God is.
Take away this, and all motion after Christ presently stops. No wonder then
that souls in their first motions to Christ find themselves clogged with so
many atheistical temptations, shaking their assent to the truth of the Gospel
at the very root and foundation of it: but they that come to Christ do see that
he is, and that their life and happiness lies in their union with him; else
they would never come to him upon such terms as they do.

Secondly, Coming to Christ, implies the souls despair of salvation any other
way: the way of faith is a supernatural way, and souls will not attempt it,
until they have tried all natural ways to help and save themselves, and find
it all in vain: therefore the Text describes these Comers to Christ as weary
persons, that have been tugging and striving all other ways for rest, but can
find none; and so are forced to relinquish all their fond expectations of
salvation in any other way, and come to Christ as their last and only remedy.

Thirdly, Coming to Christ, notes a supernatural and almighty power acting the
soul quite above its own natural abilities in this motion, John 6. 44. No man
can come to me except my father which has sent me draw him. It is as possible
for the ponderous mountains to start from their Bases and Centres, mount
themselves aloft into the air, and there fly like wandering Atoms hither and
thither; as it is for any man of himself, (i. e.) by a pure natural power of
his own, to come to Christ: it was not a stranger thing for Peter to come to
Christ walking upon the Waves of the Sea, than for his or any man's soul to come
to Christ in the way of faith.

Fourthly, Coming to Christ, notes the voluntariness of the soul in its motion
to Christ. It Is true, there is no coming without the Fathers drawing; but that
drawing has nothing of co-action in it; it does not destroy, but powerfully,
and with an overcoming sweetness persuade the will. It Is not forced or driven,
but it comes: being made willing in the day of Gods power, Psalm. 110. 3. Ask a
poor distressed sinner in that season, Are you willing to come to Christ? O
rather than live. Life is not so necessary as Christ is. O with all my heart,
ten thousand worlds for Jesus Christ if he could be purchased, were nothing
answerable to his value in mine eyes. The souls motion to Christ is free and
voluntary, it is coming.

Fifthly, It implies this in it, That no duties or Ordinances (which are but
the ways or means by which we come to Christ) are or ought to be Central and
terminative to the soul: (i. e.) the soul of a believer is not to sit down and
rest in them; but to come by them, or through them to Jesus Christ, and take up
his rest in him only. No duties, no reformations, no Ordinances of God how
excellent soever these things are in themselves, and how necessary soever they
are in their proper place and use, can give rest to the weary and heavy laden
soul: it cannot center in any of them; and you may see it cannot, because it
still gravitates, and inclines to another thing, even Christ; and cannot
terminate its motion till it be come to him. Christ is the term to which a
believer moves; and therefore cannot sit down by the way as well satisfied, as
if he were at his journeys end. Ordinances and duties have the nature and use
of means to bring us to Christ, but not to be to any man instead of Christ.

Sixthly, Coming to Christ, implies an hope or expectation Venite ad me, (i.
e.) affectibus fidei, and spei religiosae, and desiderii. Burgensis in loc.
from Christ in the coming soul. If it have no hope, why does it move forward?
as good sit still, and resolve to perish where it is, as come to Christ, if
there be no ground to expect salvation by him. Hope is the spring of motion and
industry: if you cut off hope, you hamstring faith: it cannot move to Christ,
except it be satisfied at least of the possibility of mercy and salvation by
him. Hence it is, that when comers to Christ are struggling with the doubts and
fears of the issue, the Lord is pleased to enliven their faint hopes, by
setting on such Scriptures as that John 6. 37. He that comes to me, I will in
no wise cast out: and Heb. 7. 25. He is able to save to the uttermost all that
come unto God by him. This puts life into hope, and hope puts life into
industry and motion.

Seventhly, Coming to Christ for rest, implies that believers have, and
lawfully may have an eye to their own happiness in closing with the Lord Jesus
Christ. The poor soul comes for rest: it comes for salvation: its eye and aim
is upon it: and this aim of the soul at its own good is legitimated and allowed
by that expression of Christ, John 5. 40. Ye will not come unto me that ye may
have life. If Christ blame them for not coming to him that they might have
life, sure he would not blame them, had they come to him for life.

Eighthly, But Lastly, and which is the principal thing carried in this
expression, Coming to Christ, notes the all sufficiency of Christ to answer all
the needs and wants of distressed souls, and their betaking themselves
accordingly to him only for relief, being content to come to Christ for
whatever they need, and live upon that fullness that is in him. If there were
not an all sufficiency in Christ, no soul would come to him: for this is the
very ground upon which men come, Heb. 7. 25. he is able to save to the
uttermost, all that come to God by him: (...), to the uttermost: in the
greatest plunges, difficulties and dangers: he has a fullness of saving power
in him; and this encourages souls to come unto him. One beggar uses not to wait
at the door of another, but all at the doors of them they conceive able to
relieve them. And as this notes the fullness of Christ as a Savior, so it must
needs note the emptiness and humility of the soul as a comer to him. This is
called submission in Romans 10. 3. Proud nature must be deeply distressed,
humbled and molded into another temper, before it will be persuaded to live
upon those terms, to come to Christ for every thing it wants, to live upon
Christ's fullness in the way of grace and favor, and have no stock of its own
to live upon. O this is hard, but it is the way of faith.

Secondly, In the next place let us see how Christ invites 2.
men to come unto him, and you shall find the means employed in this work, are
either internal and principal, namely the Spirit of God, who is Christ's
Vicegerent, and comes to us in his name and room to persuade us to believe,
Joh. 15. 26. or external, namely the preaching of the Gospel by Commissionated
Ambassadors, who in Christ's stead beseech men to be reconciled to God: (i. e.)
to come to Christ by faith in order to their reconciliation and peace with God.
But all means and instruments employed in this work of bringing men to Christ,
entirely depend upon the blessing and concurrence of the Spirit of God, without
whom they signify nothing: how long may Ministers preach, before one soul come
to Christ, except the Spirit cooperate in that work? Now as to the manner in
which men are persuaded, and their wills wrought upon to come to Christ, I will
briefly note several acts of the Spirit in order thereunto.

First, There is an illustrating work of the Spirit upon the minds of sinners,
opening their eyes to see their danger and misery. Till this be discovered, no
man stirs from his place: it is sense of danger that rouzes the secure sinner,
that distresses him and makes him look about for deliverance, crying, What
shall I do to be saved? and it is the discovery of Christ's ability to save,
which is the ground and reason, (as was observed above) of its motion to
Christ. Hence, seeing the Son, is joined with believing or coming to him, in
John 6. 40.

Secondly, There is the Authoritative call, or commanding voice of the Spirit
in the Word; a voice that is full of awful majesty and power, 1 John 3. 23. This
is his Commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.
This call of the Spirit to come to Christ rolls one great block, namely the
fear of presumption, out of the souls way to Christ, and instead of presumption
in coming, makes it rebellion, and inexcusable obstinacy to refuse to come.
This answers all pleas against coming to Christ from our unworthiness and deep
guilt, and mightily encourages the soul to come to Christ, whatever it has
been or done.

Thirdly, There are soul-encouraging conditional promises to all that do come
to Christ in obedience to the Command. Such is that in my Text, I will give you
rest: and that in John 6. 37. Him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast
out: and these breathe life and encouragement into poor souls that hang back
and are daunted through their own unworthiness.

Fourthly, There are dreadful threatenings denounced by the Spirit in the Word
against all that refuse or neglect to come to Christ, which are of great use to
engage and quicken souls in their way to Christ, Mark 16. 16. He that believes
not, shall be damned. Dye in his sins, John 8. 24. The wrath of God shall
remain on him, John 3. ult. Which is as if the Lord had said, Sinners don't
dally with my Christ: don't be always treating and never concluding or
resolving: for if there be Justice in heaven, or Fire in hell, every soul that
comes not to Christ, must and shall perish to all eternity: upon your own heads
let the blood and destruction of your own souls be for ever, if you will not
come unto him.

Fifthly, There are moving and working examples set before souls in the Word,
to prevail with them to come, alluring and encouraging Examples of such as have
come to Christ under deepest guilt and discouragement, and yet found mercy, 1 Timothy 1. 15, 16. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief: howbeit
(or nevertheless) for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should
hereafter believe in him to life everlasting. Who would not come to Christ
after such an example as this? And if this will not prevail, there are dreadful
examples recorded in the Word setting before us the miserable condition of all
such as refuse the calls of the Word to come to Christ, 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20. By
which also he went and preached to the spirits which are in prison, which
sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the
days of Noah. The meaning is, the sinners that lived before the Flood, but now
are in hell, clapped up into that prison, had the offers of grace made them, but
despised them, and now lie for their disobedience in prison, under the wrath of
God for it, in the lowest hell.

Sixthly and Lastly, There is an effectual persuading, overcoming and
victorious work of the Spirit upon the hearts and wills of sinners, under which
they come to Jesus Christ. Of this I have spoken at large before in the fourth
Sermon, and therefore shall not add any thing more here. This is the way and
manner, in which souls are prevailed with to come to Jesus Christ.

Thirdly, In the last place, if you enquire why Christ makes his invitations to
weary and heavy laden souls, and to 3.
no other: the answer is briefly this:

First, Because in so doing, he follows the Commission which he received from
his Father; for so you will find it runs in Isa. 61. 1. The Spirit of the Lord
is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the
meek, he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the
Captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. You see here
how Christ's Commission binds him up: his Father sent him to poor broken hearted
sinners, and he will keep close to his Commission. He came not to call the
righteous, but sinners (i. e. sensible burdened sinners) to repentance, Matthew.
9. 13. I am not sent (says he) but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Thus his Instructions and Commission from the Father, limit him only to
sensible and burdened souls, and he will be faithful to his Commission.

Secondly, The very order of the Spirits work in bringing men to Christ, shows
us to whom the invitations and offers of grace in Christ are to be made. For
none are convinced of righteousness, (i. e.) of the complete and perfect
righteousness which is in Christ for their Justification, until first they be
convinced of sin; and consequently, no man will or can come to Christ by faith,
till convictions of sin have awakened and distressed them, John 16. 8, 9. This
being the due order of the Spirits operation, the same order must be observed
in Gospel offers and invitations.

Thirdly, It behooves, that Christ should provide for his own glory as well as
for our safety, and not expose that, to secure this; but save us in that way
which will bring him most honor and praise. And certainly such a way is this,
by first convincing, humbling and burthening the souls of men, and then
bringing them to rest in himself.

Alas! Let those that never saw or felt the evil of sin, be told of rest, peace
and pardon in Christ, they will but despise it, as a thing of no value, Luke 5.
31. The whole need not a Physician, but those that are sick. Bid a man that
thinks himself sound and whole, go to the Physician, and he will but laugh at
the motion. If you offer him the richest composition, he will refuse it, slight
it, and it may be spill it upon the ground: ay, but if the same man did once
feel an acute disease, and were made to sweat and groan under strong pains, if
ever he come to know what sick days and restless nights are, and to apprehend
his life to be in eminent hazard; then messengers are sent one after another in
post-haste to the Physician; then he begs him with tears to do what in him lies
for his relief; he thankfully takes the bitterest potions, and praises the care
and skill of his Physician with tears of joy; and so the Patients safety and
the Physicians honor are both secured. So is it in this method of grace. The
Uses follow.

Inference 1. Use.

If sin-burthened souls are solemnly invited to come to Inference 1.
Christ, Then it follows, that whatever guilt lie upon the Conscience of a poor
humbled sinner, it is no presumption, but his duty to come to Christ
notwithstanding his own apprehended vileness and great unworthiness.

Let it be carefully observed how happily that universal particle all is
inserted in Christ's invitation for the encouragement of sinners. Come unto me
[All] ye that labor: q. d. let no brokenhearted sinner exclude himself,
whenas he is not by me excluded from mercy: my grace is my own, I may bestow it
where I will, and upon whom I will. It Is not I, but Satan that impales and
incloses my mercy from humbled souls that are made willing to come unto me: he
calls that your presumption, which my invitation makes your Duty.

But I doubt my case is excepted by Christ himself in Matthew. Object. 1.
12. 31. where blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is exempted from pardon: and I
have had many horrid blasphemous thoughts injected into my soul.

Art thou a burdened and heavy laden soul? If so, thy case is not in that, or
any other Scripture exempted from mercy: Sol.
for the unpardonable sin is always found in an impenitent heart: as that sin
finds no pardon with God, so neither is it followed with contrition and sorrow
in the soul that commits it.

But if I am not guilty of that sin, I am certainly guilty of many Object. 2.
great and heinous abominations of another kind, too great for me to expect
mercy for, and therefore I dare not go to Christ.

The greater your sins have been, the more need you have to go to Jesus Christ.
Let not a Motive to Christ, be made Sol.
an Obstacle in your way to him. Great sinners are expressly called Isa. 1. 18.
great sinners have come to Christ and found mercy, 1 Cor. 6. 7. And to
conclude, it is an high reproach and dishonor to the blood of Christ, and mercy
of God which flows so freely through him, to object the greatness of sin to
either of them. Certainly you have not sinned beyond the extent of mercy, or
beyond the efficacy of the blood of of Christ: but pardon and peace may be had,
if you will thus come to Christ for it.

Oh but it is now too late; I have had many thousand calls by the Gospel, and
refused them; many purposes in my heart 3. Obj.
to go to Christ, and quenched them: my time therefore is past, and now it is to
no purpose.

If the time of grace be past, and God intends no mercy for thee, how comes it
to pass thy soul is now filled with trouble Sol.
and distress for sin? Is this the frame of a man's heart that is past hope? Do
such signs as these appear in men that are hopeless? Beside, the time of grace
is a secret hid in the breast of God; but coming to Christ is a duty plainly
revealed in the Text: and why will you object a thing that is secret and
uncertain, against a duty that is so plain and evident? Nor do you your selves
believe what you object: for at the same time that you say your seasons are
over, it is too late; you are notwithstanding found repenting, mourning,
praying and striving to come to Christ. Certainly if you knew it were too late,
you would not be found laboring in the use of means. Go on therefore, and the
Lord be with you. It Is not presumption but obedience, to come when Christ
calls; as here he does, Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden:

Inference 2.
Hence it follows, That none have cause to be troubled, when God makes the
souls of their friends or relations sick with the Inference 2.
sense of sin. It was the saying (as I remember) of Hierom to Sabinian, Nothing
(said he) makes my heart sadder, than that nothing can make thy heart sad. It Is
matter of joy to all that rightly understand the matter, when God smites the
heart of any man with the painful sense of sin; of such sickness it may be
said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God. Yet how do
many carnal relations lament and bewail this as a misery, as an undoing to
their friends and acquaintance; as if then they must be reckoned lost, and
never till then that Christ is finding and saving them. O if your hearts were
spiritual and wise, their groans for sin, would be as music in your ears. When
they go alone to bewail their sin, you would go alone also to bless God for
such a mercy; that ever you should live to such a happy day: you would say, now
is my friend in the blessed pangs of the new birth: now is he in the very way
of mercy: never in so hopeful a condition as now. I had rather he should groan
now at the feet of Christ, than groan hereafter under the wrath of God for
ever. O Parents, beware as you love the souls of your Children, that you don't
damp and discourage them, tempt or threaten them, divert or hinder them in such
cases as this; lest you bring the blood of their souls upon your own heads.

Inference 3.
It also follows from hence, That those to whom sin was never Inference 3.
any burden, are not yet come to Christ, nor have they any interest in him. We
may as well suppose a Child to be born without any pangs or throes, as a soul
to be born again, and united to Christ without any sense or sorrow for sin. I
know many have great frights of conscience, that never were made duly sensible
of the evil of sin: many are afraid of burning, that never were afraid of
sinning. Slight and transient troubles some have had, but it is vanished like an
early cloud, lickt up like a morning dew. Few men are without checks and throbs
of conscience at one time or other, but instead of going to the Closet, they
run to the Ale house or Tavern for a cure: If their sorrow for sin had been
right, nothing but the sprinkling of the blood of Christ could have appeased
their consciences, Heb. 10. 22. How cold should the consideration of this thing
strike to the hearts of such persons! Methinks Reader, if this be thy case, it
should send thee away with an aching heart: Thou have not yet tasted the
bitterness of sin, and if thou do not, then shall thou never taste the
sweetness of Christ, his pardons and peace.

Inference 4.
How great a mercy is it for sin-burthened souls, to be within the Inference 4.
sound and call of Christ in the Gospel!

There be many thousands in the Pagan and Popish parts of the world, that
labor under distresses of conscience as well as we, but have no such reliefs
or means of peace and comfort as we have that live within the joyful sound of
the Gospel. If the conscience of a Papist be burdened with guilt, all the
relief he has, is to afflict his body to quiet his soul: a penance or
pilgrimage is all the relief they have. If a Pagan be in trouble for sin, he
has no knowledge of Christ, nor notion of a satisfaction made by him. The
voice of nature is, Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit
of my body for the sin of my soul? The damned endure the terrible blows and
wounds of conscience for sin, they roar under that terrible lash, but no voice
of peace or pardon is heard among them. It is not, come unto me ye that labor
and are heavy laden, but depart from me ye cursed.

Blessed are your ears, for you hear the voice of peace, you are come to Jesus
the Mediator, and to the blood of sprinkling. O you can never set a due value
upon this privilege.

Inference 5.
How sweet and unspeakably relieving is the closing of a burdened Inference 5.
soul with Jesus Christ by faith! It Is rest to the weary soul.

Soul troubles are spending and wasting troubles. The pains of a distressed
conscience are the most acute pains. A poor soul would fain be at rest, but
knows not where: he tryes this duty and that, but finds none: at last he falls
into the way of believing; he casts himself with his burden of guilt and fear
upon Christ, and there is the rest his soul desired. Christ and rest come
together: till faith bring you to the bosom of Jesus, you can find no true
rest; the soul is rolling and tossing, sick and weary upon the billows of its
own guilt and fears. Now the soul is come like a Ship tossed with storms and
tempests, out of a raging Ocean into the quiet harbor, or like a lost Sheep
that has been wandering in weariness, hunger and danger, into the fold. Is a
soft bed in a quiet chamber sweet to one that is spent and tired with travel?
Is the sight of a shore sweet to the shipwrackt Mariner that looks for nothing
but death? much more sweet is Christ to a soul that comes to him pressed in
conscience, and broken in spirit under the sinking weight of sin.

How did the Italians rejoice after a long and dangerous voyage to see Italy
again! Crying with loud and united voices which made the very heavens ring
again, Italy, Italy! But no shore is so sweet to the weather-beaten passenger,
as Christ is to a Italiam, Italiam, l^to clamore salutant. Virg.
brokenhearted sinner: this brings the soul to a sweet repose, Heb. 4. 3. We
which have believed, do enter into rest: and this endears the way of faith to
their souls ever after.

Inference 6.
Learn hence the usefulness of the Law, to bring souls to Jesus Inference 6.
Christ. It Is utterly useless as a Covenant to justify us, but exceeding
useful to convince and humble us. It cannot relieve or ease us, but it can and
does awaken and rouse us: it is a fair glass to show us the face of sin; and
till we have seen that, we cannot see the face of Jesus Christ.

The Law like the Fiery Serpents smites, stings and torments the conscience:
this drives us to the Lord Jesus lifted up in the Gospel, like the Brazen
Serpent in the Wilderness to heal us. The use of the Law, is to make us feel
our sickness; this makes us look out for a Physician. I was alive once without
the Law (says Paul) but when the Commandment came sin revived, and I dyed,
Romans 7. 9. The hard, vain, proud hearts of men require such an hammer to break
them to pieces.

Inference 7.
It Is the immediate duty of weary and heavy laden sinners to Inference 7.
come to Christ by faith, and not stand off from Christ, or delay to accept him
upon any pretense whatsoever.

Christ invites and commands such to come unto him, it is therefore your sin to
neglect, draw back, or deferr, whatever seeming reasons and pretenses there may
be to the contrary. When the Jailer was brought (where I suppose thee now to
be) to a pinching distress that made him cry, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
the very next counsel the Apostles gave him, was, Believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thou shall be saved, Acts 16. 30, 31. And for your encouragement
know, he that calls you to come, knows your burden, what your sins have been,
and troubles are, yet he calls you: if your sin hinder not Christ from calling,
neither should it hinder you from coming. He that calls you, is able to ease
you; to save to the uttermost all that come to God by him, Heb. 7. 25. Whatever
fullness of sin be in you, there is a greater fullness of saving power in Christ.
Moreover, he that calls you to come, never yet rejected any poor burdened soul
that came to him: and has said he never will, Joh. 6. 37. He that comes unto
me, I will in no wise cast out. Fear not therefore, he will not begin with
thee, or make thee the first instance and example of the feared rejection.

And Lastly, Bethink thy self, what will thou do, and whither will thou go in
this case, if not to Jesus Christ? Nothing shall ease or relieve thee, till
thou do come to him. Thou art under an happy necessity to go to him. With him
only is found rest for the weary soul. Which brings us to the third and last
Observation.

Doct. 3. Doct. 3.

That there is rest in Christ for all that come unto him under the heavy burden
of Sin.

REST, is a sweet word to a weary soul, all seek it, none but believers find
it. We which have believed Non dicit (...) ingressi sumus, sed (...)
ingredimur, significans, initia quietis fideles nunc habere: plenam quietem suo
tempor^ consecuturos. Pareus in loc.
(says the Apostle) do enter into rest, Heb. 4. 3. he does not say they shall,
but they do enter into rest; noting their spiritual rest to be already begun by
faith on earth in the tranquillity of conscience, and shall be consummated in
heaven in the full enjoyment of God. There is a sweet calm upon the troubled
soul after believing, an ease or rest of the mind, which is an unspeakable
mercy to a poor weary soul. Christ is to it, as the Ark was to the Dove when
she wandered over the watery World, and found not a place to rest the soal of
her foot. Faith centres the unquiet spirit of man in Christ, brings it to
repose it self and its burden on him. It is the souls dropping anchor in a
storm, which stays and settles it.

The great debate which cost so many anxious thoughts, is now issued into this
resolution; I will venture my all upon Christ, let him do with me as seems
him good. It was impossible for the soul to find rest whilst it knew not where
to bestow it self, or how to be secured from the wrath to come; but when all is
embarked in Christ for eternity, and the soul fully resolved to lean upon him,
and trust to him; now it feels the very initials of eternal rest in it self: it
finds an heavy burden unloaded from its shoulders: it is come as it were into a
new world: the case is strangely altered. The word rest in this place notes,
(and is so rendered by some) a recreation: it is restored, renewed and recreated
as it Recreabo vos, nempe a lassitudine, a molestia, and onere. Vatab. and
Erasm.
were, by that sweet repose it has upon Christ. Believers know, that faith is
the sweetest recreation you can take. Others seek to divert and lose their
troubles by sinful recreations, vain company and the like; but they little know
what that recreation, and sweet restoring rest that faith gives the soul, is.
You find in Christ what they seek in vain among the creatures. Believing is the
highest recreation known in this world. But to prevent mistakes, three Cautions
need to be premised, lest we do in ipso limine impingere, stumble at the
threshold, and so lose our way all along afterward.

Caution 1.
You are not to conceive, that all the souls fears, troubles and sorrows are
presently over and at an end, as soon as it is come to Caution 1.
Christ by faith. They will have many troubles in the world after that, it may
be more than ever they had in their lives: Luther upon his conversion was so
buffeted by Satan, ut nec calor, nec sanguis, nec sensus, nec vox superesset.
Our flesh (says Paul) had no rest, 2 Cor. 7. 5. They will be infested with
many temptations after that, it may be the assaults of Satan may be more
violent upon their souls than ever: horribilia de deo, terribilia de fide:
Injections that make the very bones to quake, and the belly to tremble: they
will not be freed from sin, that rest remains for the people of God, nor from
inward trouble and grief of soul about sin. These things are not to be expected
presently.

Caution 2.
We may not think that all believers do immediately enter into Caution 2.
the full actual sense of rest and comfort; but they presently enter into the
state of rest. Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, Romans 5. 1. (i.
e.) we enter into the state of peace immediately. Peace is sown for the
righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart, Psalm. 97. 11. And he is a
rich man that has a thousand acres of corn in the ground, as well as he that
has so much in his barn, or the money in his purse. They have rest and peace
in the seed of it, when they have it not in the fruit: they have rest in the
promise, when they have it not in possession: and he is a rich man that has
good Bonds and Bills for a great sum of money, if he have not twelve pence in
his pocket. All believers have the promise, have rest and peace granted them
under Gods own hand in many promises; which faith brings them under: and we
know that the truth and faithfulness of God stands engaged to make good every
line and word of the promise to them. So that though they have not a full and
clear actual sense and feeling of rest, they are nevertheless by faith come
into the state of rest.

Caution 3.
We may not conceive, that faith it self is the souls rest, but Caution 3.
the means and instrument of it only. We cannot find rest in any work or duty
of our own, but we may find it in Christ, whom faith apprehends for
Justification and Salvation.

Having thus guarded the point against misapprehensions by these needful
cautions, I shall next show you, how our coming to Christ by faith brings us to
rest in him. And here let it be considered what those things are that burden,
grieve and disquiet the soul before its coming to Christ, and how it is
relieved and eased in all those respects by* its coming to the Lord Jesus: and
you shall find,

First, That one principal ground of trouble, is the guilt 1.
of sin upon the conscience, of which I spoke in the former point. The curse of
the Law lies heavy upon the soul, so heavy that nothing is found in all the
world able to relieve it under that burden: as you see in a condemned man,
spread a Table in Prison with the greatest dainties, and send for the rarest
Musicians, all will not charm his sorrow; but if you can produce an authentic
pardon, you ease him presently: just so it is here, faith plucks the thorn out
of the conscience which so grieved it, unites the soul with Christ, and then
that ground of trouble is removed: for there is no condemnation to them that
are in Christ, Romans 8. 11. The same moment the soul comes to Christ, it is past
from death to life; is no more under the Law, but Grace. If a man's debt be paid
by his surety, he need not fear to show his face boldly abroad: he may freely
meet the Sergeant at the prison door.

Secondly, The soul of a convinced sinner is exceedingly 2.
burdened with the uncleanness and filthiness wherewith sin has defiled and
polluted it. Conviction discovers the universal pollution of heart and life, so
that a man loathes and abhorrs himself by reason thereof: If he do not look into
his own corruptions, he cannot be safe: and if he do, he cannot bear the sight
of it; he has no quiet: Nothing can give rest, but what gives relief against
this evil. And this only is done by faith uniting the soul with Jesus Christ.
For though it be true, that the pollution of sin be not presently and perfectly
taken away by coming to Christ; yet the burden thereof is exceedingly eased:
for upon our believing, there is an heart-purifying principle planted into the
soul, which does by degrees cleanse that fountain of corruption, and will at
last perfectly free the soul from it, Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by
faith: and being once in Christ, he is concerned for the soul, as a member now
of his own mystical body to purify and cleanse it, that at last he may present
it perfect to the Father without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, Ephesians. 5.
26. The reigning power of it is gone immediately upon believing, and the very
existence and being of it shall at last be destroyed. O what rest must this
give under those troubles for sin?

Thirdly, It was an intolerable burden to the soul to be under the continual
fears, aiarms and frights of death and 3.
damnation. Its life has been a life of bondage upon this account, ever since
the Lord opened his eyes to see his condition. Poor souls lie down with
tremblings for fear what a night may bring forth. It Is a sad life indeed to
live in continual bondage to such fears. But faith sweetly relieves the
trembling Conscience, by removing the guilt which breeds it; fears. The sting
of death is sin; when guilt is removed, fears vanish. Smite Lord, smite, said
Luther, for my sins are forgiven. Now if sickness come, it is another thing than
it was Feri Domine, feri, nam a peccatis meis absolutus sum, Luth.
wont to be, Isai. 33. 21. The Inhabitant shall not say I am sick, the people
that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquities: a man scarce feels his
sickness in comparison to what he did, whilst he was without Christ, and hope
of pardon.

Fourthly, A convinced sinner out of Christ sees every thing 4.
against him: nothing yields any comfort, yea every thing increases and
aggravates his burden, whether he look to things past, present, or to come. If
he reflect upon things past, his soul is filled with anguish to remember the
sins committed, and the seasons neglected; and the precious mercies that have
been abused: if he look upon things present, the case is doleful and miserable:
nothing but trouble and danger; Christless, and comfortless: and if he look
forward to things to come, that gives him a deeper cut to the heart than any
thing else; for though it be sad and miserable for the present, yet he fears it
will be much worse hereafter; all these are but the beginning of sorrows: and
thus the poor awakened sinner becomes a Magor missabib; fear round about.

But upon his coming to Christ all things are marvellously altered: a quite
contrary face of things appears to him: every thing gives him hope and comfort
which way soever he looks: so speaks the Apostle, 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. All things
are yours (says he) whether life, or death; or things present, or things to
come, all is yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods: they are ours (i.
e.) for our advantage, benefit and comfort; more particularly upon our coming
to Christ*

First, Things past are ours, they conduce to our advantage and comfort. Now
the soul can begin to read the gracious end and design of God, in all its
preservations and deliverances; whereby it has been reserved for such a day as
this. O! it melts his heart to consider, his Companions in sin and Vanity are
cut off, and he spared; and that for a day of such mercy as the day of his
espousals with Christ is. Now all his past sorrows and deep troubles of spirit
which God has exercised him with, begin to appear the greatest mercies that
ever he received; being all necessary, and introductive to this blessed union
with Christ.

Secondly, Things present are ours, though it be not yet with us as we would
have it; Christ is not sure enough, the heart is not pure enough; sin is too
strong, and grace is too weak; many things are yet out of order; yet can the
soul bless God for this with tears of joy, and praise him for this brimful of
admiration, and holy astonishment; that it is, as it is; that he is where he
is, though he be not yet where he would be. O it is a blessed life to live as a
poor recumbent, by acts of trust and affiance, though as yet it have but little
evidence: that it is resolved to trust all with Christ, though it be not yet
certain of the issue. O this is a comfortable station, a sweet condition to
what it was, either when it wallowed in sin in the days before conviction, or
was swallowed up in fears and troubles for sin after conviction: now it has
hope though it want assurance; and hope is sweet to a soul coming out of such
deep distresses: now it sees the remedy, and is applying it, whereas before the
wound seemed desperate: now all hesitations and debates are at an end in the
Soul, it is no longer bivious and unresolved what to do; all things have been
deeply considered, and after consideration, issued into this resolve or decree
of the will. I will go to Christ; I will venture all upon his Command and Call;
I will imbarque my eternal interests in that Bottom: here I fix; and upon this
ground I resolve to live and dye. O how much better is this, than that floating
life it lived before, rolling upon the billows of inward fears and troubles,
not able to drop Anchor any where, nor knowing where to find an Harbor.

Thirdly, Things to come are ours: and this is the best and sweetest of all:
man is a prospecting creature, his eye is much upon things to come, and it will
not satisfy him that it is well at present, except he have a prospect that it
shall be so hereafter: but now the soul has committed it self and all its
concernments to Christ for eternity, and this being done, it is greatly relieved
against evils to come.

I cannot (says the Believer) think all my troubles over, and that I shall
never meet any more afflictions, it were a fond vanity to dream of that; but I
leave all these things where I have left my soul: he that has supported me
under inward, will carry me through outward troubles also. I cannot think all
my temptations to sin past, O, I may yet meet with sore assaults from Satan:
yet it is infinitely better to be watching, praying and striving against sin,
than it was when I was obeying it in the lusts of it. God that has delivered
me from the love of sin, will, I trust, preserve me from ruin by sin. I know
also death is to come, I must feel the pangs and agonies of it; but yet the
aspect of death is much more pleasant than it was. I come Lord Jesus to thee,
who art the death of death, whose death has disarmed death of its sting. I
fear not its dart, if I feel not its sting. And thus you see briefly, how by
faith Believers enter into rest. How Christ gives rest even at present to them
that come to him, and all this but as a beginning of their everlasting rest.

Inference 1.
Is there rest in Christ for weary souls that come unto him, Then certainly
it is a design of Satan against the peace and welfare Inference 1.
of men's souls to discourage them from coming to Christ in the way of faith.

He is a restless spirit himself, and would make us so too: it is an excellent
note of Minutius Foelix, Those desperate Ad Solamen calamitatis suae, non
definunt per i^i perdere. Minut. Felix.
and restless Spirits (says he) have no other pleasure, but in bringing us to
the same misery themselves are in: he goes about as a roaring Lion, seeking
whom he may devour. It frets and grates his proud and envious mind to see
others find rest, when he can find none: an effectual Plaster applied to heal
our wound, when his own must bleed to eternity: and he obtains his end fully,
if he can but keep off souls from Christ: look therefore upon all those
objections and discouragements raised in your hearts against coming to Christ,
as so many Artifices and cunning Devices of the Devil to destroy and ruin your
souls. It Is true, they have a very specious and colorable appearance, they are
gilded over with pretenses of the Justice of God, the heinous nature of sin;
the want of due and befitting qualifications for so holy and pure a God: the
lapsing of the reason of mercy, and an hundred other of like nature: but I
beseech you lay down this as a sure conclusion, and hold it fast; that whatever
it be that discourages and hinders you from coming to Christ, is directly
against the interest of your souls, and the hand of the Divil is certainly in
it.

Inference 2.
Hence also it follows, That unbelief is the true reason of all that
disquietness and trouble, by which the minds of poor sinners are Inference 2.
so rackt and tortured.

If you will not believe, you cannot be established: till you come to Christ,
peace cannot come to you: Christ and peace are undivided. Good souls consider
this, you have tried all other ways, you have tried duties, and no rest comes;
you have tried reformation, restitution, and a stricter course of life, yet
your wounds are still open and fresh bleeding: these things, I grant, are in
their places both good and necessary, but of themselves, without Christ,
utterly insufficient to give what you expect from them: why will you not try
the way of faith? why will you not carry your burden to Christ? O that you
would be persuaded to it, how soon would you find what so long you have been
seeking in vain! how long will you thus oppose your own good! how long will you
keep your selves upon the rack of Conscience! is it easy to go under the
throbs and wounds of an accusing and condemning Conscience? You know it is not:
you look for peace, but no good comes, for a time of healing, and behold
trouble: alas, it must and will be so still, until you fall into the way of
faith, which is the true and only method to obtain rest.

Inference 3.
What cause have we all to admire the goodness of God, in providing for us a
Christ, in whom we may find rest to our Inference 3.
souls!

How has the Lord filled and furnished Jesus Christ with all that is suitable
to a Believers wants! Does the guilt of sin terrify his Conscience? Lo, in him
is perfect righteousness to remove that guilt, so that it shall neither be
imputed to his person, nor reflected by his Conscience in the way of
condemnation as it was before. In him also is a Fountain opened for washing and
for cleansing the filth of sin from our souls: in him is the fullness both of
Merit, and of Spirit, two sweet Springs of Peace to the souls of men: well
might the Apostle say, Christ the wisdom of God, 1 Cor. 1. 30. and well might
the Church say, he is altogether lovely, Cant 5. 16. Had not God provided Jesus
Christ for us, we had never known one hours rest to all eternity.

Inference 4.
How unreasonable and wholly inexcusable in Believers is the sin of backsliding
from Christ? Have you found rest in him, Inference 4.
when you could not find it in any other? Did he receive and ease your souls
when all other persons and things were Physicians of no value? and will you
after this backslide from him again? O what madness is this! Will a man leave
the Snow of Lebanon which comes from the Rock of the Field? or shall the cold
flowing waters that come from another place, be forsaken? No man that is in his
wits would leave the pure cold refreshing streams of a Crystal Fountain, to go
to a filthy pudled Lake, or an empty Cistern, as the best enjoyments of this
world are in comparison with Jesus Christ.

It was Christ's melting expostulation with the Disciples, Joh. 6. 67, 68. when
some had forsaken him, will ye also go away? and it was a very suitable return
they made, Lord, whither away from thee should we go! q. d. from thee, Lord, no
no, where can we mend our selves? Be sure of it, when ever you go from Christ,
ye go from rest to trouble. Had Judas rest? had Spira rest? and do you think
you shall have re^ no no, The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own
ways, Prove. 14. 14. you shall have your bellies full of it: Cursed be the man
that departs from him, he shall be as the Heath in the Desert, that sees not
when good comes, and shall inhabit the parched places of the wilderness, Jer.
17. 5. If fear of sufferings and worldly temptations ever draw you off from
Christ, you may come to those straights and terrors of Conscience, that will
make you wish your selves back again with Christ in a Prison, with Christ at a
Stake.

Inference 5.
Let all that come to Christ, learn to improve him to the rest and peace of
their own souls, in the midst of all the troubles and Inference 5.
outward distresses they meet with in the world.

Surely rest may be found in Christ in any condition: he is able to give you
peace in the midst of all your troubles here. So he tells you in Joh. 16. ult.
These things have I spoken to you, that in me you might have peace; in the
world you shall have tribulation: by peace he means not a deliverance from
troubles by taking off affliction from them, or taking them away by death from
all afflictions; but it is something they enjoy from Christ in the very thick
of troubles, and amidst all their afflictions, that quiets and gives them rest,
so that troubles cannot hurt them: certainly Believers, you have peace in
Christ, when there is little in your own hearts: and your hearts might be
filled with peace too, if you would exercise faith upon Christ for that end:
it is your own fault, if you be without rest in any condition in this world. Set
your selves to study the fullness of Christ, and to clear your interest in him,
believe what the Scriptures reveal of him, and live as you believe, and you
will quickly find the peace of God filling your hearts and minds.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
The Tenth SERMON. Sermon 10.

MAT. 9. 12. But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, Text. Wherein the
general Exhortation is enforced, by one Motive, drawn from the first Title of
Christ.
They that be whole need not a Physician, but they that be sick.
HAving opened in the former discourses the nature and method of the
Application of Christ to sinners, it remains now that I press it upon every
soul, as ever it expects peace and pardon from God, to apply, and put on Jesus
Christ, (i. e.) to get union with him by faith whilst he is yet held forth in
the free and gracious tenders of the Gospel; to which purpose I shall now
labor in this general Use of Exhortation, in which my last Subject engaged me;
wherein diverse Arguments will be further urged, both from The 1. Titles, and of
Jesus Christ. 2. Privileges

The Titles of Christ are so many Motives or arguments fitted to persuade men
to come unto him. Amongst which, Christ as the Physician of Souls comes under
our first Consideration in the Text before us.

The occasion of these words of Christ, was the call of Matthew the Publican:
who having first opened his Heart, next opened his House to Christ, and
entertains him there: this strange and unexpected change wrought upon Matthew,
quickly rings in all the Neighborhood, and many Publicans and Sinners resorted
thither; at which the stomachs of the proud Pharisees began to swell: from this
occasion they took offense at Christ, and in this verse Christ takes off the
offense by such an answer as was fitted both for their conviction and his own
vindication. But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them; The whole have no
need of a Physician, but they that be sick.

He gives it (says one) as a reason why he conversed so much with Publicans
and Sinners, and so little among the Pharisees, because there was more work for
him: men set up where they think Trade will be quickest: Christ came to be a
Physician to sick souls. Pharisees were so well in their own conceit, that
Christ saw he should have little to do among them; and so he applied himself to
those who were more sensible of their sickness.

In the words we have an account of the temper and state both Of 1. The secure
and unconvinced Sinner. 2. The humbled and convinced And 3. Of the Carriage of
Christ, and his different respect to either.

1. First, The secure sinner is here described, both with respect to his own
apprehensions of himself, as one that is whole, and also by his low value and
esteem for Christ, he sees no need of him; the whole have no need of the
Physician.

2. Secondly, The Convinced and Humbled Sinner is here also described, and that
both by his state and condition, he is sick; and by his valuation of Jesus
Christ, he greatly needs him: they that be sick need the Physician.

3. Thirdly, We have here Christ's carriage and different respect to both: the
former he rejects, and passes by; as those with whom he has no concernment:
the later he converses with in order to their cure.

The words thus opened are fruitful in observations. I shall neither note nor
insist upon any beside this one, which fuits the scope of my Discourse, viz.

DOCT.
That the Lord Jesus Christ is the only Physician for sick souls.

The world is a great Hospital full of sick and dying souls, Doct.
all wounded by one and the same mortal weapon, sin. Some are senseless of
their misery, feel not their pains, value not a Physician: others are full of
sense, as well as danger; mourn under the apprehension of their condition, and
sadly bewail it. The merciful God has, in his abundant compassion to the
perishing world, sent a Physician from Heaven, and given him his Orders under
the Great Seal of Heaven for his Office, Isai. 61. 1, 2. which he opened and
read in the audience of the people, Luke 4. 18. The spirit of the Lord is upon
me, because he has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he has
sent me to bind up the broken hearted, etc. He is the tree of life, whose
leaves are for the healing of the Nations: he is Jehova Rophe, the Lord that
heals us; and that as he is Jehovah Tzidkenu, the Lord our righteousness. The
Brazen Serpent that healed the Israelites in the Wilderness, was an excellent
Type of our Great Physician Christ, and is expressly applied to him, John 3. 14.
he rejects none that come, and heals all whom he undertakes: but more
particularly I will,

First, Point at those Diseases which Christ heals in sick souls, and by what
means he heals them.

Secondly, the excellency of this Physician above all others: there is none
like Christ, he is the only Physician for wounded souls.

First, We will enquire into the Diseases which Christ the Physician cures; and
they are reducible to two heads, (...).


viz. 1. Sin, and 2. Sorrow.

First, The disease of sin, in which three things are found exceeding
burdensome to sick souls, 1. The Guilt of sin; all cured by this Physician,
and how. 2. The Dominion 3. The Inherence

First, The guilt of sin, this is a mortal wound, a stab in 1.
the very heart of a poor sinner. It Is a fond and groundless distinction that
Papists make of sins Mortal and Venial: all sin in its own nature is mortal,
Romans 6. 23. The wages of sin is death: yet though it be so in its own nature,
Christ can, and does cure it by the Sovereign Balfom of his own precious blood,
Ephesians. 1. 7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, according to the riches of his grace. This is the deepest and deadliest
wound the soul of man feels in this world: what is guilt, but the obligation of
the soul to everlasting punishment and misery? It puts the soul under the
sentence of God to eternal wrath; the condemning sentence of the great and
terrible God; than which, nothing is found more dreadful and insupportable: put
all pains, all poverty, all afflictions, all miseries in one Scale, and Gods
condemnation in the other, and you weigh but so many Feathers against a talent
of Lead.

This Disease our great Physician Christ cures by Remission, which is the
dissolving of the obligation to punishment; the loosing of the soul that was
bound over to the Wrath and Condemnation of God, Coll. 2. 13, 14. Heb. 6. 12.
Micah 7. 17, 18, 19. this remission being made, the soul is immediately cleared
from all its obligations to punishment, Romans 8. 1. There is no condemnation:
all Bonds are cancelled; the guilt of all sins is healed or removed; original,
and actual; great, and small. This cure is performed upon souls by the blood of
Christ: nothing is found in Heaven or earth besides his blood, that is able to
heal this disease; Heb. 9. 22. Without shedding of blood there is no remission;
nor is it any blood that will do it, but that only which dropped from the wounds
of Christ, Isa. 53. 5. By his stripes we are healed: his blood only is innocent
and precious blood, 1 Pet. 1. 19. blood of infinite worth and value; the blood
of God, Act. 20. 28. blood prepared for this very purpose, Heb. 10. 5. this is
the blood that performs the cure; and how great a cure is it! for this cure the
souls of Believers shall be praising and magnifying their great Physician in
Heaven to all eternity, Rev. 1. 5, 6. To him that loved us, and washed us from
our sins in his own blood, etc. to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.

Secondly, The next evil in sin, cured by Christ, is the dominion 2.
of it over the souls of poor sinners. Where sin is in dominion, the soul is in
a very sad condition; for it darkens the Understanding, depraves the
Conscience, stiffens the Will, hardens the Heart, misplaces and disorders all
the Affections: and thus every faculty is wounded by the power and dominion of
sin over the soul. How difficult is the cure of this disease! it passes the
skill of Angels or men to heal it: but Christ undertakes it, and makes a
perfect cure of it at last; and this he does by his Spirit. As he cures the
guilt of sin by pouring out his blood for us, so he cures the dominion of sin,
by pouring out his Spirit upon us. Justification is the cure of guilt,
Sanctification the cure of the dominion of sin. For,

First, As the Dominion of sin darkens the understanding, 1 Cor. 2. 14. so the
spirit of holiness which Christ sheds upon his people, cures the darkness and
blindness of that noble faculty, and restores it again, Ephesians. 5. 8. they that
were darkness are hereby light in the Lord: the anointing of this Spirit
teaches them all things, 1 John 2. 27.

Secondly, As the dominion of sin depraved and defiled the Conscience, Tit. 1.
15. wounded it to that degree, as to disable it to the performances of all its
Offices and Functions; so that it was neither able to apply, convince, or
tremble at the word: So when the Spirit of holiness is shed forth, O what a
tender sense fills the renewed Conscience! for what small things will it check,
smite and rebuke! how strongly will it bind to duty, and bar against sin!

Thirdly, As the dominion of sin stiffned the Will, and made it stubborn and
rebellious; so Christ by sanctifying it, brings it to be pliant and obedient to
the will of God. Lord, says the sinner, what will thou have me to do? Act. 9.
6.

Fourthly, As the power of sin hardneth the Heart, so that nothing could affect
it, or make any impression upon it; when sanctification comes upon the soul, it
thaws and breaks it, as hard as it was, and makes it dissolve in the breast of
a sinner in godly sorrow, Ezec. 36. 26. I will take away the heart of stone out
of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. It will now melt
ingenuously under the threatenings of the word, 2 Kings 22. 19. or the strokes
of the Rod, Jer. 31. 18. or the manifestations of grace and mercy, Luke 7. 38.

Fifthly, As the power of sin misplaced and disordered all the affections, so
sanctification reduces them again, and sets them right, Psalm. 4. 6, 7. And thus
you see how sanctification becomes the rectitude, health and due temper of the
soul, so far as it prevails, curing the diseases that sin in its dominion
filled the soul with. True it is, this cure is not perfected in this life:
there are still some grudgings of the old diseases in the holiest souls,
notwithstanding sin be dethroned from its dominion over them: but the cure is
begun, and daily advances toward perfection, and at last will be complete, as
will appear in the cure of the next evil of sin, namely,

Thirdly, The Inherence of sin in the soul; this is a sore disease, the very
core and root of all our other complaints 3.
and ails. This made the holy Apostle bemoan himself, and wail so bitterly,
Romans 7. 17. because of sin that dwelt in him: and the same misery is bewailed
by all sanctified persons all the world over.

It Is a wonderful mercy to have the guilt and the dominion of sin cured; but we
shall never be perfectly sound and well till the existence, or indwelling of
sin in our natures be cured too. When once that is done, then we shall feel no
more pain, nor sorrows for sin: and this our great Physician will at last
perform for us, and upon us: but as the cure of guilt was by our Justification,
the cure of the dominion of sin by our Sanctification; so the third and last
which perfects the whole cure, will be by our Glorification; and till then it
is not to be expected. For it is a clear case, that sin like Ivy in the old
Walls, will never be gotten out, till the Wall be pulled down, and then it is
pulled up by the roots. This cure Christ will perform in a moment upon our
dissolution. For it is plain,

First, That none but perfected souls, freed from all sin, are admitted into
Heaven, Ephesians. 5. 27. Heb. 12. 23. Rev. 21. 27.

Secondly, It Is as plain, that no such personal perfection and freedom is found
in any man on this side death, and the grave, 1 John 1. 8. 1 Kings 8. 46.
Philip. 3. 12. a truth sealed by the sad experience of all the Saints on earth.

Thirdly, If such freedom and perfection must be before we can be perfectly
happy, and no such thing be done in this life; it remains that it must be done
immediately upon their dissolution, and at the very time of their
glorification: as sin came in at the time of the union of their souls and
bodies in the womb, so it will go out at the time of their separation by death:
then will Christ put the last hand to this glorious work, and perfect that cure
which has been so long under his hand in this world: and thenceforth sin shall
have no power upon them; it shall never tempt them more, it shall never defile
them more; it shall never grieve and sadden their hearts any more: henceforth
it shall never cloud their evidences, darken their understandings, or give the
least interruption to their communion with God: when sin is gone, all these its
mischievous effects are gone with it. So that I may speak it to the comfort of
all gracious hearts, according to what the Lord told the Israelites in Deuteronomy.
12. 8, 9. (to which I allude for illustration of this most comfortable truth)
Ye shall not do after all the things that ye do here this day, every man
whatsoever is right in his own eyes, for ye are not as yet come to the rest,
and to the inheritance which the Lord your God gives you. Whilst you are under
Christ's cure upon earth, but not perfectly healed; your understandings mistake,
your thoughts wander, your affections are dead, your communion with God is
daily interrupted: but it shall not be so in Heaven, where the cure is perfect:
you shall not know, love, or delight in God as you do this day; for you are not
as yet come to the rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord your God gives
you: and so much as to the diseases of sin, and Christ's method of curing them.

Secondly, As sin is the disease of the Saints, so also is Sorrow. The best of
Saints must pass through the valley of 2^.
Bacha to Heaven. How many tears fall from the Eyes of the Saints upon the
account of outward, as well as inward troubles; even after their reconciliation
with God? Through much tribulation we must enter into the Kingdom of God, Acts
14. 22. It would be too great a digression in this place, to note but the more
general heads, under which almost infinite particulars of troubles and
afflictions are found. It shall suffice only to show, that whatever distress or
trouble any poor soul is in upon any account whatsoever; if that soul belong to
Jesus Christ, he will take care of it for present, and deliver it at last by a
complete cure.

First, Christ cures troubles by sanctifying them to the souls of his that are
under affliction, and makes their very troubles medicinal and healing to them.
Trouble is a Scorpion, and has a deadly sting; but Christ is a wise Physician,
and extracts a Sovereign Oil out of this Scorpion, that heals the wound it
makes. By affliction our wise Physician purges our corruptions, and so prevents
or cures greater troubles by lesser; inward sorrows, by outward ones, Isai. 27.
9. By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the
fruit, to take away his sin.

Secondly, Christ cures outward troubles by inward consolations, which are made
to rise in the inner man as high as the waters of affliction do upon the
outward man, 2 Cor. 1. 5. One drop of spiritual comfort is sufficient to
sweeten a whole Ocean of outward trouble. It was an high expression of an Nihil
Corpus sent it in nerv^, cum Anima sit in Coelo.
afflicted Father, whom God comforted just upon the death of his dear and only
Son, with some clearer manifestations of his love than was usual. O, said he,
might I but have such consolations as these, I could be willing (were it
possible) to lay an only Son into the grave every day I have to live in this
world. Thus all the troubles of the world are cured by Christ, John 16. 33. In
the world ye shall have trouble, but in me ye shall have peace.

Thirdly, Christ cures all outward sorrows and troubles in his people by death,
which is their removal from the place of sorrows to peace and rest for
evermore. Now God wipes all tears from their eyes, and the days of their
mourning are at an end: they then put off the Garments and Spirit of mourning,
and enter into peace, Isai. 57. 2. they come to that place and state, where
tears and sighs are things unknown to the Inhabitants: one step beyond the
state of this mortality, brings us quite out of the sight and hearing of all
troubles and lamentations. These are the diseases of souls, sin and sorrow; and
thus they are cured by Christ the Physician.

Secondly, Next, I shall show you that Jesus Christ is the only Physician of
souls: none like him for a sick sinner: and this will be evident in diverse
respects.

First, None so wise and judicious as Jesus Christ to understand, 2.
and comprehend the nature, depth, and danger of soul diseases. O how ignorant
and unacquainted are men with the state and case of afflicted souls! but Christ
has the tongue of the Learned, that he should know how to speak a word in
season to him that is weary, Isai. 50. 4. He only understands the weight of
sin, and depth of inward troubles for sin.

Secondly, None so able to cure and heal the wounds of afflicted souls as
Christ is: he only has those medicines that can cure a sick soul. The blood of
Christ, and nothing else in Heaven or Earth, is able to cure the mortal wounds
which guilt inflicts upon a trembling Conscience: let men try all other
receipts, and costly experience shall convince them of their insufficiency.
Conscience may be benumbed by stupefactive medicines, prepared by the Devil for
that end, but pacified it can never be, but by the blood of Christ, Heb. 16. 22.

Thirdly, None so tender hearted, and sympathizing with sick souls, as Jesus
Christ: he is full of bowels and tender compassions to afflicted souls: he is
one that can have compassion, because he has had experience, Heb. 5. 2. If I
must come into the Surgeons hand with broken bones, give me such a one to
choose, whose own bones have been broken, who has felt the anguish in himself.
Christ knows what it is by experience, having felt the anguish of inward
troubles, the weight of Gods wrath, and the terrors of a forsaking God, more
than any, or all the sons of men: this makes him tender over distressed souls,
Isai. 42. 3. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he shall not
quench.

Fourthly, None cures in so wonderful a method as Christ does: he heals us by
his stripes, Isai. 53. 5. The Physician dies that the Patient may live: his
wounds must bleed, that ours may be cured: he feels the smart and pain, that we
might have the ease and comfort. No Physician but Christ will cure others at
this rate.

Fifthly, None so ready to relieve a sick soul as Christ: he is within the call
of a distressed soul at all times. Art thou sick for sin, weary of sin, and
made truly willing to part with sin? Lift up but thy sincere cry to the Lord
Jesus for help, and he will quickly be with thee: when the Prodigal, the
emblem of a convinced humbled sinner, said in himself, I will return to my
Father, the Father ran to meet him, Luke 15. 20. he can be with thee in a
moment.

Sixthly, none so willing to receive and undertake all distressed and afflicted
souls as Jesus Christ is: he refuses none that come to him, Joh. 6. 37. He that
comes unto me, I will in no ways cast out: whatever their sins have been, or
their sorrows are; however they have wounded their own souls with the deepest
gashes of guilt; how desperate and helpless soever their case appears in their
own or others Eyes: he never puts them off, or discourages them, if they be but
willing to come, Isai. 1. 18, 19.

Seventhly, None so happy and successful as Christ: he never fails of
performing a perfect cure upon those he undertakes: never was it known that any
soul miscarried in his hands, John 3. 15, 16. other Physicians by mistakes, by
ignorance, or carelessness, fill Churchyards, and cast away the lives of men:
but Christ suffers none to perish that commit themselves to him.

Eighthly, none so free and generous as Christ, he does all gratis: he sells
not his medicines, though they be of infinite value, but freely gives them,
Isai. 55. 1. He that has no money let him come; if any be sent away, it is the
rich, Luke 1. 53. not the poor and needy: those that will not accept their
remedy as a free gift, but will needs purchase it at a price.

Ninthly, and Lastly, None rejoices in the recovery of souls more than Christ
does. O it is unspeakably delightful to him to see the efficacy of his blood
upon our souls, Isai. 53. 11. He shall see the travail of his soul (i. e. the
success of his death and sufferings) and shall be satisfied: when he foresaw
the success of the Gospel upon the world, it is said Luke 10. 21. In that hour
Jesus rejoiced in spirit: and thus you see, there is no Physician like Christ
for sick souls.

The Uses of this Point are,

For Information and Direction.

First, From hence we are informed of many great and necessary truths deducible
from this: as,

Inference 1.
How inexpressible is the grace of God, in providing such a Physician Inference
1.
as Christ, for the sick and dying souls of Sinners! O blessed be God, that
there is Balm in Gilead, and a Physician there: that your case is not as
desperate, forlorn and remediless as that of the Devils and damned is. There is
but one case excepted from cure, and that such as is not incident to any
sensible afflicted soul, Mat. 12. 31. and this only excepted, all manner of
sins and diseases are capable of a cure. Though there be such a disease as is
incurable, yet take this for thy comfort, never any soul was sick ( i. e.)
sensibly burdened with it, and willing to come to Jesus Christ for healing:
for under that sin, the will is so wounded that they have no desire to Christ.
O inestimable mercy, that the sickest sinner is capable of a perfect cure!
There be thousands, and ten thousands now in Heaven and earth, who said once,
never was any case like theirs; so dangerous, so hopeless. The greatest of
sinners have been perfectly recovered by Christ, 1 Timothy 1. 15. 1 Cor. 6. 11. O
mercy never to be duly estimated!

Inference 2.
What a powerful restraint from sin, is the very method ordained Inference 2.
by God for the cure of it! Isai. 53. 5. by his stripes we are healed. The
Physician must dye, that the Patient might live: no other thing but the blood,
the precious blood of Christ is found in Heaven or earth able to heal us, Heb.
9. 22. 26. This blood of Christ must be freshly applied to every new wound sin
makes upon our souls, 1 John 2. 1, 2. every new sin wounds him afresh, opens
the wounds of Christ anew. O think of this again, and again, you that so easily
yield to the solicitations of Satan: is it so cheap and easy to sin, as you
seem to make it? Does the cure of souls cost nothing? True, it is free to us,
but was it so to Christ? No, no, it was not; he knows the price of it, though
you do not: has Christ healed you by his stripes, and can you put him under
fresh sufferings for you so easily? Have you forgot also your own sick days and
nights for sin, that you are careless in resisting, and preventing it? Sure
it is not easy for Saints to wound Christ and their own souls, at one stroke:
if you renew your sins, you must also renew your sorrows and repentance, Psalm.
51. Title. 2 Samuel 12. 13. you must feel the throes and pains of a troubled
Spirit again, things with which the Saints are not unacquainted: of which they
may say as the Church, Remembering my affliction, the Wormwood and the Gall, my
soul has them still in remembrance, Lam. 3. 19. Yea, and if you will yet be
remiss in your watch, and so easily incur new guilt; though a pardon in the
blood of Christ may heal your souls, yet some Rod or other in the hand of a
displeased Father shall afflict your bodies, or smite you in your outward
Comforts, Psalm. 89. 32.

Inference 3.
If Christ be the only Physician of sick souls, what sin and folly is it for
men to take Christ's work out of his hands, and attempt Inference 3.
to be their own Physicians?

Thus do those that superstitiously endeavor to heal their souls by afflicting
their bodies: not Christ's blood, but their own must be the Plaster: and as
blind Papists, ^o many carnal and ignorant Protestants strive by confession,
restitution, reformation, and a stricter course of life to heal those wounds
that sin has made upon their souls, without any respect to the blood of
Christ: but this course shall not profit them at all. It may for a time divert,
but can never heal them: the wounds so skinned over, will open and bleed again;
God grant it be not when our souls shall be out of the reach of the true and
only remedy.

Inference 4.
How sad is the case of those souls, to whom Christ has not Inference 4.
yet been a Physician? They are mortally wounded by sin, and are like to dye of
their sickness; no saving healing applications having hitherto been made unto
their souls: and this is the case of the greatest part of mankind; yea, of them
that live under the discoveries of Christ in the Gospel: which appears by these
sad symptoms.

First, In that their eyes have not yet been opened to see their sin and
misery, in which illumination the cure of souls begins, Act. 26. 18. to this
day he has not given them Eyes to see, Deuteronomy. 29. 4. but that terrible stroke
of God, which blinds and hardens them, is too visibly upon them, mentioned in
Isai. 6. 9, 10. no hope of healing till the sinners Eyes be opened to see his
sin, and misery.

Secondly, In that nothing will divorce and separate them from their lusts: a
sure sign they are not under Christ's cure, nor were ever made sick of sin. O if
ever Christ be a Physician to thy soul, he will make thee loath what now thou
love, and say to thy most pleasant and profitable lusts, get ye hence, Isai.
30. 22. till then there is no ground to think that Christ is a Physician to you.

Thirdly, In that they have no sensible and pressing need of Christ, nor make
any earnest enquiry after him, as most certainly you would do, if you were in
the way of healing and recovery. These and many other sad symptoms do too
plainly discover the disease of sin to be in its full strength upon your souls;
and if it so continue, how dreadful will the issue be? See Isai. 6. 9, 10.

Inference 5.
What cause have they to be glad, that are under the hand and Inference 5*
care of Christ in order to a cure; and who do find, or may upon due
examination find, their souls are in a very hopeful way of recovery! Can we
rejoice when the strength of a natural disease is broken, and nature begins to
recover ease, and vigor again, and shall we not much more rejoice when our
souls begin to mend, and recover sensibly, and all comfortable signs of life
and health appear upon them? particularly when the understanding which was
ignorant and dark, has the light of life beginning to dawn into it, such is
that in 1 John 2. 27. When the will which was rebellious and inflexible to the
will of God, is brought to comply with that holy will, saying, Lord what will thou have me to do? Acts 9. 6. When the heart which was harder than an Adamant,
is now brought to contrition for sin, and can mourn as heartily over it, as
ever a tender Father did for a dead Son, a beloved and only Son. When its
aversations from God are gone, at least have no such power as once they had:
but the thoughts are now fixed much upon God, and spiritual things begin to
grow pleasant to the soul: when times of duty come to be longed for, and the
soul never better pleased than in such seasons. When the Hypocrisy of the
heart is purged out, so that we begin to do all that we do heartily, as unto
the Lord, and not unto men, Coll. 3. 23. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 4. when we begin to make
Conscience of secret sins, Psalm. 119. 113. and of secret duties, Mat. 6. 5, 6.
when we have an equal respect to all Gods Commandments, Psalm. 119. 6. and our
hearts are under the holy and awful Eye of God, which does indeed overawe our
souls, Genesis 17. 1. O what sweet signs of a recovering soul are these! Surely
such are in the skilful hand of the great Physician, who will perfect what yet
remains to be done.

Second Use for Direction.
In the last place, this point yields us matter of advice and direction to poor
souls that are under the disease of sin, Use 2.
and they are of two sorts, which I will distinctly speak to, viz. First, Such
as are under their first sickness, or spiritual sorrow for sin, and know not
what course to take: or, Secondly, such as have been longer in the hands of
Christ the Physician, but are troubled to see the cure advance so slowly upon
them, and fear the issue.

First, As to those that are in their first troubles for sin, 1.
and know not what course to take for ease and safety; I would address to them
these following Counsels.

First, Shut your Ears against the dangerous counsels of carnal persons or
relations; for as they themselves are unacquainted with these troubles: so also
are they with all proper memedies; and it is very usual with the Devil to
convey his temptations to distressed souls by such hands; because by them he
can do it with least suspicion. It was Augustins complaint, that his own Father
took little care for his soul; and many Parents act in this case, as if they
were employed by Satan.

Secondly, Be not too eager to get out of trouble, but be content to take Gods
way, and wait his time: no woman that is wise, would desire to have her travail
hastened one day before the due time: nor will it be your interest to hasten too
soon out of trouble. It Is true, times of trouble are apt to seem tedious; but a
false peace will endanger you more than a long trouble: a man may lengthen his
own troubles to the loss of his own peace, and he may shorten them to the
hazard of his own soul.

Thirdly, Open your case to wise, judicious and experienced Christians, and
especially the Ministers of Christ, whose office it is to counsel and direct
you in these difficulties; and let not your troubles lie like a secret
smothering fire, always in your own breasts. I know men are more ashamed to
open their sins under convictions, than they were to commit them before
conviction: but this is your interest, and the true way to your rest and peace.
If there be with, or near you an Interpreter, one of a thousand, to show you
your righteousness, and remedy, as it lies in Christ; neglect not your own
souls in a sinful concealment of your case: it will be the joy of their hearts
to be employed in such work as this is.

Fourthly, Be much with God in secret: open your hearts to him, and pour out
your complaints into his Bosom. The 102. Psalm bears a title very suitable to
your case and duty: yea, you will find if your troubles work kindly, and God
intend a cure upon your souls, that nothing will be able to keep God and your
souls asunder: whatever your encumbrances in the world be, some time will be
daily redeemed to be so spent betwixt you and God.

Fifthly, Plead hard with God in prayer for help and healing: Heal my soul
(says David) for I have sinned against thee, Psalm. 41. 4. tell him, Christ
has his Commission sealed for such as you are: he was sent to bind up the
broken hearted, Isai. 61. 1. tell him he came into the world to seek and save
that which was lost, and so are you now in your own account and apprehension.
Lord, what profit is there in my bood? Will thou pursue a dried leaf? And why
is my heart wounded with the sense of sin, and mine eyes opened to see my
danger and misery, are not these the first dawnings of mercy upon sinners? O
let it appear, that the time of mercy, even the set time is now come.

Sixthly, Understand your peace to be in Christ only, and faith to be the only
way to Christ and rest: let the great enquiry of your souls be after Christ and
faith, study the nature and necessity of these, and cry to God day and night
for strength to carry you to Christ in the way of faith.

Secondly, As to those that have been longer under the hands of Christ, and yet
are in troubles still, and cannot 2.
attain peace, but their wounds bleed still, and all they hear in Sermons, or
do in way of duty, will not bring them to rest: to such I only add two or three
words for a close.

First, Consider whether you ever rightly closed with Christ since your first
awakening, and whether there be not some way of sin in which you still live: if
so, no wonder your wounds are kept open, and your souls are strangers to peace.

Secondly, If you be conscious of no such flaw in the foundation, consider how
much of this trouble may arise from your constitution and natural temper, which
being melancholy, will be doubtful and suspicious: you may find it so in other
cases of less moment, and be sure Satan will not be wanting to improve it.

Thirdly, Acquaint your selves more with the nature of true justifying faith; a
mistake in that has prolonged the troubles of many: if you look for it in no
other act but assurance, you may easily overlook it, as it lies in the mean
time in your affiance or acceptance. A true and proper conception of saving
faith would go far in the cure of many troubled souls.

Fourthly, Be more careful to shun sin, than to get your selves clear of
trouble. It Is sad to walk in darkness, but worse to lie under guilt. Say, Lord,
I would rather be grieved my self, than be a grief to thy Spirit. O keep me
from sin, how long soever thou keep me under sorrow. Wait on God in the way of
faith, and in a tender spirit toward sin, and thy wounds shall be healed at
last by thy great Physician.

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The Eleventh SERMON. Sermon 11.

LUKE 1. 72. Text. Containing the second motive to enforce the general
exhortation, from a second Title of Christ.
To perform the mercy promised to our Fathers, and to remember his holy
Covenant.
THis Scripture is part of Zechariahs Prophecy at the rising of that bright
Star, John, the Harbinger and forerunner of Christ: they are some of the first
words he spoke after God had loosed his tongue, which for a time was struck
dumb for his unbelief. His tongue is now unbound, and at liberty to proclaim to
all the world the riches of mercy through Jesus Christ, in a song of praise.
Wherein note,

The Mercy celebrated, viz. Redemption by Christ, verse. 68.

The description of Christ by place and property, verse. 69.

The faithfulness of God in our Redemption this way, verse. 70.

The benefit of being so Redeemed by Christ, verse. 71.

The exact accomplishment of all the promises made to the Fathers, in sending
Christ, the mercy promised, into the world, verse. 72. To perform the mercy
promised to our Fathers, etc. In these words we find two parts,

viz. 1. A mercy freely promised. 2. The promised mercy faithfully performed.

First, You have here a mercy freely promised, viz. by God the Father from the
beginning of the world, and often repeated 1.
and confirmed in several succeeding ages to the Fathers, in his Covenant
transactions.

This Mercy is Jesus Christ, of whom he speaks in this Prophecy: the same
which he styles an horn of salvation in the house of David, verse. 69.

The mercy of God in Scripture is put either for,

1. His free favor to the Creature, or, 2. The effects and fruits of that
favor.
It Is put for the free and undeserved favor of God to the creature, and this
favor of God may respect the creature two ways, either as undeserving, or as
ill deserving.

It respected innocent man as undeserving, for Adam could put no obligation
upon his Benefactor: it respects fallen man as ill deserving. Innocent man
could not merit favor, and fallen man did merit wrath: the favor or mercy of
God to both is every way free; and that is the first acceptance of the word
mercy: but then it is also taken for the effects and fruits of Gods favor; and
they are,

Either, 1. Principal and primary, or, 2. Subordinate and Secundary.

Of Secundary and Subordinate Mercies, there are multitudes, both Temporal,
respecting the body, and Spiritual, respecting the soul: but the Principal and
Primary Mercy is but one, and that is Christ, the firstborn of mercy; the
capital mercy; the comprehensive-root-mercy, from whom are all other mercies;
and therefore called by a singular emphasis in my Text The Mercy, (i. e.) the
mercy of all mercies; without whom no drop of saving mercy can flow to any of
the sons of men; and in whom are all the tender bowels of Divine mercy yearning
upon poor sinners. The Mercy, and the mercy promised. The first promise of
Christ was made to Adam, Genesis 3. 15. and was frequently renewed afterward to
Abraham, to David; and as the Text speaks, unto the Fathers, in their
respective generations.

Secondly, We find here also, the promised mercy faithfully performed. To
perform the mercy promised. What mercy 2.
soever the love of God engages him to promise, the faithfulness of God stands
engaged for the performance thereof. Christ the promised mercy, is not only
performed truly, but he is also performed according to the promise in all the
circumstances thereof exactly. So he was promised to the Fathers, and just so
performed to us their Children: hence the Note is:

DOCT.
That Jesus Christ the Mercy of mercies, was graciously promised, and
faithfully performed by God to his people. Doct.


Three things are here to be opened.
First, Why Christ is styled the Mercy.

Secondly, What kind of Mercy Christ is to his people.

Thirdly, How this promised Mercy was performed.

First, Christ is the mercy, emphatically so called, the peerless, invaluable,
and matchless mercy; because he is the 1.
prime fruit of the mercy of God to Sinners. The mercies of God are infinite:
mercy gave the world and us our beings: all our protections, provisions and
comforts in this world are the fruits of mercy: the after-births of Divine
Favor: but Christ is the firstborn from the womb of mercy: all other mercies
compared with him, are but fruits from that root, and streams from that
fountain of mercy: the very bowels of Divine mercy are in Christ, as in verse.
78. according to the tender mercies, or as the Greek, the yearning bowels of
the mercy of God.

Secondly, Christ is the mercy, because all the mercy of 2.
God to sinners is dispensed and conveyed through Christ to them, Joh. 1. 16.
Col. 2. 3. Ephesians. 4. 7. Christ is the medium of all Divine communications: the
Channel of Grace; through him is both the decursus and recursus gratiarum; the
flows of mercy from God to us, and the returns of praise from us to God: fond
and vain therefore are all the expectations of mercy out of Christ: no drop of
saving mercy runs beside this Channel.

Thirdly, Christ is the mercy, because all inferior mercies derive both their
nature, value, sweetness and duration from 3.
Christ, the fountain mercy of all other mercies.

First, they derive their nature from Christ: for out of him those things which
men call mercies, are rather traps and snares, than mercies to them, Prove. 1.
32. The time will come when the rich that are Christless will wish, O that we
had been poor! and Nobles that are not ennobled by the new birth, O that we had
been among the lower rank of men! All these things that pass for valuable
mercies, like Ciphers signify much when such a speaking Figure as Christ
stands before them, else they signify nothing to any man's comfort or benefit.

Secondly, They derive their value as well as nature from Christ: for how
little, I pray you, does it signify to any man to be rich, honorable,
politic, and successful in all his designs in the world; if after all, he
must lie down in Hell?

Thirdly, All other mercies derive their sweetness from Christ, and are but
insipid things without him. There is a twofold sweetness in things; one
natural, another spiritual: those that are out of Christ can relish the first,
Believers only relish both: they have the natural sweetness that is in the
mercy it self, and a sweetness supernatural from Christ and the Covenant, the
way in which they receive them. Hence it is that some men taste more spiritual
sweetness in their daily bread, than others do in the Lords Supper: one and the
same mercy by this means becomes a feast to soul and body at once.

Fourthly, All mercies have their duration and perpetuity from Christ: all
Christless persons hold their mercies upon the greatest contingencies and terms
of uncertainty: if they be continued during this life, that is all: there is not
a drop of mercy after death; but the mercies of the Saints are continued to
eternity: the end of their mercies on earth, is the beginning of their better
mercies in Heaven. There is a twofold end of mercies, one perfective, another
destructive: the death of the Saints perfects and compleats their mercies; the
death of the wicked destroys and cuts off their mercies: for these reasons
Christ is called the mercy.

Secondly, In the next place let us enquire what manner of mercy Christ is; and
we shall find many lovely, and transcendent, 2.
properties to commend him to our souls.

First, He is a free and undeserved mercy, called upon that account the gift of
God, John 4. 10. And to show how free this gift was, God gave him to us when we
were enemies, Romans 5. 8. needs must that mercy be free, which is given not only
to the undeserving, but to the ill deserving: the benevolence of God was the
sole impulsive cause of this gift, John 3. 16.

Secondly, Christ is a full mercy replenished with all that answers to the
wishes or wants of sinners: in him alone is found whatever the justice of an
angry God requires for satisfaction, or the necessities of souls require for
their supply. Christ is full of mercy, both extensively and intensively; in him
are all kinds and sorts of mercies, and in him are the highest and most perfect
degrees of mercy; for it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness
dwell, Col. 1. 19.

Thirdly, Christ is the seasonable mercy, given by the Father to us in due
time, Romans 5. 6. in the fullness of time, Gal. 4. 4. a seasonable mercy in his
exhibition to the world in general, and a seasonable mercy in his application
to the soul in particular: the wisdom of God pitched upon the best time for his
incarnation, and it hits the very nick of time, for his application. When a
poor soul is distressed, lost, at its wits end, ready to perish; then comes
Christ: all Gods works are done in season, but none more seasonable than this
great work of Salvation by Christ.

Fourthly, Christ is the necessary mercy: there is an absolute necessity of
Jesus Christ: hence in Scripture he is called the bread of life, Joh. 6. 48. he
is bread to the hungry: he is the water of life, Joh. 7. 37. as cold water to
the thirsty soul: he is a ransom for captives, Mat. 20. 28. a garment to the
naked, Romans 13. ult. only bread is not so necessary to the hungry, nor water to
the thirsty, nor a ransom to the Captive, nor a garment to the naked; as Christ
is to the soul of a sinner, the breath of our nostrills, the life of our souls
is in Jesus Christ.

Fifthly, Christ is a fountain mercy, and all other mercies flow from him: a
believer may say of Christ, all my fresh springs are in thee: from his merit,
and from his Spirit flow our Redemption, Justification, Sanctification, Peace,
Joy in the Holy Ghost, and blessedness in the world to come: In that day shall
there be a fountain opened, Zech. 13. 1.

Sixthly, Christ is a satisfying mercy; he that is full of Christ can feel the
want of nothing. I desire to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified,
1 Cor. 2. 2. Christ bounds and terminates the vast desires of the soul; he is
the very Sabbath of the soul: how hungry, empty, straightened, and pinched in upon
every side, is the soul of man in the abundance and fullness of all outward
things, till it come to Christ? The weary motions of a restless soul, like
those of a River, cannot be at rest till they pour themselves into Christ, the
Ocean of blessedness.

Seventhly, Christ is a peculiar mercy intended for, and applied to a remnant
among men: some would extend redemption as large as the world, but the Gospel
limits it to those only that believe: and these Believers are upon that account
called a peculiar people, 1 Pet. 2. 9. The offers of Christ indeed are large,
and general; but the application of Christ is but to few, Isai. 53. 1. the
greater cause have they to whom Christ comes, to lie with their mouths in the
dust, astonished and overwhelmed with the sense of so peculiar and
distinguishiug mercy.

Eighthly, Jesus Christ is a suitable mercy, fitted in all respects to our
needs and wants, 1 Cor. 1. 20. wherein the admirable wisdom of God is
illustriously displaied: ye are complete in him (says the Apostle) Col. 2. 20.
Are we enemies? He is reconciliation: are we sold to sin and Satan? He is
redemption: are we condemned by Law? He is the Lord our righteousness: has sin
polluted us? He is a fountain opened for sin and for uncleaness: are we lost by
departing from God? He is the way to the Father. Rest is not so suitable to the
weary, nor bread to the hungry, as Christ is to the sensible sinner.

Ninthly, Christ is an astonishing and wonderful mercy: his name is called
Wonderful, Isai. 9. 6. and as his name is, so is he; a wonderful Christ: his
person is a wonder, 1 Timothy 3. 16. Great is the mystery of godliness, God
manifested in the flesh: his abasement wonderful, Phil. 2. 6. his love is a
wonderful love: his redemption full of wonders: Angels desire to look into it:
he is and will be admired by Angels and Saints to all eternity.

Tenthly, Jesus Christ is an incomparable and matchless mercy; as the
Apple Tree among the Trees of the Wood, so is my Beloved among the Sons (says
the enamoured Spouse) Cant. 2. 3. Draw the comparison how you will betwixt
Christ and all other enjoyments, you will find none in Heaven or earth to match
him: he is more than all externals, as the light of the Sun is more than that
of a Candle: nay the worst of Christ is better than the best of the world: his
reproaches are better than the worlds pleasures, Heb. 11. 25. he is more than
all Spirituals, as the Fountain is more than the Streams: he is more than
justification, as the cause is more than the effect: more than sanctification,
as the person himself is more than his image or picture: he is more than all
peace, all comfort, all joys, as the Tree is more than the Fruit. Nay draw the
comparison betwixt Christ and things eternal, and you will find him better than
they: for what is Heaven without Christ? Psalm. 73. 25. Whom have I in Heaven
but thee? If Christ should say to the Saints, Take Heaven among you, but as for
me, I will withdraw my self from you: the Saints would fall a weeping, even in
Heaven it self, and say, Lord, Heaven will be no more Heaven to us, except thou
be there; thou art the better half of Heaven.

Eleventhly, Christ is an unsearchable mercy: who can spell his wonderful name,
Prove. 30. 4. who can tell over his unsearchable riches, Ephesians. 3. 8. Hence it is
that souls never tire in the study or love of Christ, because new wonders are
eternally rising out of him: he is a deep which no line of any created
understanding, angelical or humane can fathom.

Twelfthly, and Lastly, Christ is an everlasting mercy; the same yesterday, to
day, and for ever, Heb. 13. 8. All other enjoyments are perishable, time eaten
things: time like a Moth will fret them out: but the riches of Christ are
durable riches, Prove. 8. 18. the graces of Christ are durable graces, Joh. 4.
14. all the creatures are flowers that appear and fade in their month: but this
Rose of Sharon, this Lilly of the Valley, never withers. Thus you see the mercy
performed, with his desirable properties.

Thirdly, The last thing to be opened is the manner of 3.
Gods performing this mercy to his people: which the Lord did, 1. Really and
truly, as he had promised him. 2. Exactly agreeable to the promises and
predictions of him.


First, Really and truly; as he had promised, so he made good the promise, Act.
2. 36. Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same
Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.

The manifestation of Christ in the flesh was no phantasm or delusion, but a
most evident and palpable truth, 1 John 1. 1. That which we have heard, which
we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have
handled. A truth so certain, that the assertors of it appealed to the very
enemies of Christ for the certainty thereof, Act. 2. 22. yea, not only the
sacred but profane writers witness to it: not only the Evangelists and
Apostles, but even the Heathen writers of those times, both Roman and Jewish,
as Suetonius, Tacitus, Plinius the younger, and Josephus the Jewish Antiquary
do all acknowledge it.

Secondly, As God did really and truly perform Christ the promised mercy, so he
performed this promised mercy exactly agreeable to the promises, types, and
predictions made of him to the Fathers, even to the most minute circumstances
thereof. This is a great truth for our faith to be established in: let us
therefore cast our eyes both upon the promises and performances of God, with
respect to Christ the mercy of mercies. See how he was represented to the
Fathers long before his manifestation in the flesh: and what an one he appeared
to be when he was really exhibited in the flesh.

First, As to his person and qualifications, as it was foretold, so it was
fulfilled. His original was said to be unsearchable and eternal, Mica. 5. 2.
and so he affirmed himself to be, Rev. 1. 11. I am Alpha and Omega, the first
and the last: Joh. 6. 31, 32. Before Abraham was, I am: his two natures united
in one person was plainly foretold, Zech. 13. 7. the man my fellow; and such a
one God performed, Romans 9. 5. His immaculate purity and holiness was foretold,
Dan. 9. 24. to anoint the most Holy; some render it the great Saint: the Prince
of Saints, and such an one he was indeed, when he lived in this world: Joh. 8.
46. Which of you convinces me of sin? His Offices were foretold, the
prophetical Office predicted, Deuteronomy. 18. 15. and fulfilled in him, Joh. 1. 18.
his Priestly Office foretold, Psalm. 110. 4. fulfilled, Heb. 9. 14. his Kingly
Office foretold, Mica. 5. 2. and in him fulfilled, his very enemies being
Judges, Mat. 27. 37.

Secondly, As to his birth, the time, place, and manner thereof was foretold to
the Fathers, and exactly performed to a tittle.

First, The time prefixed more generally in Jacobs Phophecie, Genesis 44. 10. when
the Scepter should depart from Judah, as indeed it did in Herod the Idumean:
more particularly in Daniel seventy weeks from the decree of Darius, Dan. 9.
24. answering exactly to the time of his birth: so cogent and full a proof,
that Porphyry, the great enemy of Christians had no other evasion, but that
this Prophecy was devised after the event; which yet the Jews (as bitter
enemies to Christ as himself) will by no means allow to be true: and Lastly,
The time of his birth was exactly pointed at in Haggai's Prophecy, Hag. 2. 7,
9. compared with Mal. 3. 1. he must come whilst the second Temple stood: at
that time was a general expectation of him, Joh. 1. 19. and at that very time
he came, Luke 2. 38.

Secondly, The place of his birth was foretold to be Bethlehem Ephrata, Mica.
5. 2. and so it was, Mat. 2. 5, 6. to be brought up in Nazareth, Zech. 6. 12.
Behold the man whose name is the branch, the word is Netzer, whence is the word
Nazarite: and there indeed was our Lord brought up, Mat. 2. 23.

Thirdly, His Parent was to be a Virgin, Isai. 7. 14. punctually fufilled, Mat.
1. 20, 21, 22, 23.

Fourthly, His Stock or Tribe was foretold to be Judah, Genesis 49. 10. and it is
evident (says the Apostle) that our Lord sprang out of Judah, Heb. 7. 14.

Fifthly, His Harbinger or forerunner was foretold, Mal. 4. 5, 6. fulfilled in
John the Baptist, Luke 1. 16, 17.

Sixthly, The obscurity and meanness of his birth was predicted, Isai. 53. 2.
Zech. 9. 9. to which the event answered, Luke 2. 12.

Thirdly, His Doctrine and Miracles were foretold, Isai. 61. 1, 2. and Isai.
35. 4, 5. the accomplishment whereof in Christ is evident in the History of all
the Evangelists.

Fourthly, His death for us was foretold by the Prophets, Dan. 9. 26. The
Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself: Isai. 53. 5. He was wounded for
our transgression: and so he was, Joh. 11. 50. The very kind and manner of his
death was prefigured in the brazen Serpent, his Type, and answered in his death
upon the Cross, Joh. 3. 14.

Fifthly, His burial in the Tomb of a rich man was foretold, Isai. 53. 9. and
accomplished most exactly, Mat. 27. 59, 60.

Sixthly, His resurrection from the dead was Typed out in Jona, and fulfilled
in Christ's abode three days and nights in the Grave, Mat. 12. 39.

Seventhly, The wonderful spreading of the Gospel in the world, even to the
Isles of the Gentiles, was fore-prophesied, Isai. 49. 6. To the truth whereof
we are not only the witnesses, but the happy instances, and examples of it.
Thus the promised mercy was performed.

Inference 1.
If Christ be the mercy of mercies; the medium of conveying all other mercies
from God to men: Then in vain do men expect Inference 1.
and hope for the mercy of God out of Jesus Christ.

I know many poor sinners comfort themselves with this, when they come upon a
bed of sickness, I am sinful, but God is merciful: and it is very true, God is
merciful; plenteous in mercy; his mercy is great above the heavens; mercy
pleases him: and all this they that are in Christ shall find experimentally to
their comfort and salvation: but what is all this to thee, if thou be
Christless? There is not one drop of saving mercy that comes in any other
Chanel than Christ to the soul of any man.

But must I then expect no mercy out of Christ? This is a hard case, very
uncomfortable doctrine. Yes, thou may be a Christless and Covenantless soul,
and yet have variety of temporal mercies as Ishmael had, Genesis 17. 20, 21. God
may give thee the fatness of the Earth, Riches, Honors, Pleasures, a numerous
and prosperous Posterity; will that content thee? Yes, if I may have Heaven
too: no, no, neither Heaven nor Pardon, nor any other Spiritual or Eternal
mercy may be expected out of Christ, Jude verse. 21. O deceive not your selves
in this point. There are two bars betwixt you and all Spiritual mercies, viz.
the guilt of sin, and the filth of sin: and nothing but your own union with
Christ can remove these, and so open the passage for Spiritual mercies to your
souls.

Why, but I will repent of sin, strive to obey the Commands of God, make
restitutions for the wrongs I have done, cry to God for mercy, bind my soul
with vows and strong resolutions against sin for time to come: will not all
this lay a ground work for hope of mercy to my soul? No, no, this will not,
this cannot do it.

First, All your sorrows, tears and mournings for sin cannot obtain mercy:
could you shed as many tears for any one sin that ever you committed, as all
the children of Adam have shed upon any account whatsoever since the creation
of the World; they will not purchase the pardon of that one sin: for the Law
accepts no short payment, it requires plenary satisfaction, and will not
discharge any soul without it: nor can it acknowledge or own your sorrows to be
such: the repentance of a soul in Christ finds through him acceptance with God,
but out of him it is nothing.

Secondly, All your strivings to obey the Commands of God, and live more
strictly for time to come, will not obtain mercy, Mat. 5. 20. Except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Thirdly, Your restitution and reparation of wrongs you have done cannot obtain
mercy: Judas restored, and yet was damned: man is repaired, but God is not:
remission is the act of God; it is he must loose your Consciences from the bond
of guilt, or they can never be loosed.

Fourthly, All your cries to God for mercy will not prevail for mercy, if you
be out of Christ, Mat. 7. 22. Job 27. 9. A righteous Judge will not reverse the
just sentence of the Law, though the Prisoner at the Bar fall upon his knees,
and cry, mercy, mercy.

Fifthly, Your vows and engagements to God for time to come cannot obtain
mercy: for they being made in your own strength, it is impossible you should
keep them; and if you could, yet it is impossible they should obtain remission
and mercy: should you never sin more for time to come, yet how shall God be
satisfied for sins past? Justice must have satisfaction, or you can never have
remission, Romans 3. 25, 26. and no work wrought by man can satisfy Divine
Justice, nor is the satisfaction of Christ made over to any for their
discharge, but to such only as are in him: therefore never expect mercy out of
Christ.

Inference 2.
Is Christ the mercy of mercies, greater, better and more necessary Inference 2.
than all other mercies, then let no inferior mercy satisfy you for your
portion.

God has mercies of all sorts to give; but Christ is the chief, the prime
mercy of all mercies: O be not satisfied without that mercy. When Luther had a
rich present sent him, Valde protestatus sum, me nolle sie ab eo satiari, Luth.
he protested God should not put him off so: and David was of the same mind,
Psalm. 17. 14. If the Lord should give any of you the desires of your hearts in
the good things of this life, let not that satisfy you whilst you are
Christless. For,

First, What is there in these earthly enjoyments, whereof the vilest of men
have not a greater fullness than you? Job 21. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Psalm. 17. 10.
Psalm. 73. 3, 12.

Secondly, What comfort can all these things give to a soul already condemned
as thou art? Joh. 3. 18.

Thirdly, What sweetness can be in them, whilst they are all unsanctified
things to you? Enjoyments and their sanctification are two distinct things,
Psalm. 37. 16. Prove. 10. 22. Thousands of unsanctified enjoyments will not yield
your souls one drop of solid spiritual comfort.

Fourthly, What pleasure can you take in these things out of which death must
shortly strip you naked? You must die, you must dye; and whose then shall all
those things be for which you have labored? Be not so fond to think of Tunc
edax flamma comb^ret, quos nunc carnalis delectatio polluit.
leaving a great name behind you: it is but a poor felicity (as Chrysostom well
observes) to be tormented where thou art, and praised where thou art not: the
sweeter your portion has been on earth, the more intolerable will your
condition be in Hell: yea, these earthly delights do not only increase the
torments of the damned, but also prepare (as they are instruments of sin) the
souls of men for damnation, Prove. 1. 32. Surely the prosperity of fools shall
destroy them: be restless therefore, till Christ the mercy of mercies be the
root and fountain, yielding and sanctifying all other mercies to you.

Inference 3.
Is Jesus Christ the mercy of mercies, infinitely better than all other
mercies; then let all that be in Christ be content and well Inference 3.
satisfied, whatever other inferior mercies the wisdom of God seems fit to
deny them: you have a Benjamins portion, a plentiful inheritance in Christ,
will you yet grumble? Others, have Houses splendid and magnificent upon earth;
but you have an house made without hands, eternal in the Heavens, 2 Cor. 5. 1.
Others are clothed with rich and costly apparel, your souls are clothed with
the white pure robes of Christ's righteousness, Isai. 61. 10. I will greatly
rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed
me with the garment of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of
righteousness, as a Bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a Bride
adorneth her self with Jewels. Let those that have full Tables, heavy Purses,
rich Lands, but no Christ; be rather objects of your pity than envy: it is
better like store-cattle to be kept lean and hungry, than with the fatted Ox to
tumble in flowery Meadows, thence to be led away to the shambles. God has not a
better mercy to give than Christ thy portion, in him all necessary mercies are
secured to thee, and thy wants and straits sanctified to thy good. O therefore
never open thy mouth to complain against thy bountiful God.

Inference 4.
Is Christ the mercy (i. e:) he in whom all the tender mercies Inference 4.
of God toward poor sinners are, then let none be discouraged in going to
Christ by reason of the sin and unworthiness that is in them: his very name is
mercy, and as his name is so is he. Poor drooping sinner, encourage thy self in
the way of faith, the Christ to whom thou art going is mercy it self to
brokenhearted sinners moving toward him in the way of faith: Doubt not that
mercy will repulse thee, it is against both its name and nature so to do. Jesus
Christ is so merciful to poor souls that come to him, that he has received and
pardoned the chiefest of sinners; men that stood as remote from mercy as any in
the world, 1 Timothy 1. 15. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Those that shed the blood of Christ,
have yet been washed in that blood from their sin, Act. 2. 36, 37. Mercy
receives sinners without exception of great and heinous ones, Joh. 7. 37. If
any man thirst, let him come to me and drink. Gospel invitations run in general
terms to all sinners that are heavy laden, Mat. 11. 28. When Mr. Billney the
Martyr heard a Minister preaching at this rate, O thou old Sinner who have been
serving the Devil these fifty or sixty years; do thou think that Christ will
receive thee now? O said he, what a preaching of Christ is here? Had Christ
been thus preached to me in the day of my trouble for sin, what had become of
me! But blessed be God there is a sufficiency both of merit and mercy in Jesus
Christ for all sinners, for the vilest among sinners, whose hearts shall be
made willing to come unto him. So merciful is the Lord Jesus Christ that he
moves first, Isai. 65. 1, 2. So merciful that he upbraids none, Ezec. 18. 22.
So merciful that he will not despise the weakest if sincere desires of souls,
Isai. 42. 3. So merciful, that nothing more grieves him, than our unwillingness
to come unto him for mercy, Joh. 5. 40. So merciful that he waits to the last
upon sinners to show them mercy, Romans 10. 21. Mat. 23. 37. In a word, so
merciful, that it is his greatest joy when sinners come unto him that he may
show them mercy, Luke 15. 5. 22.

But yet it cannot enter into my thoughts that I should obtain Object.
mercy.

First, You measure God by your selves, 1 Samuel 24. 19. If Sol.
a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? Man will not, but the
merciful God will upon the submission of his enemies to him.

Secondly, You are discouraged because you have not tried. Go to Jesus Christ,
poor distressed sinner, try him; and then report what a Christ thou find him
to be.

But I have neglected the time of mercy, and now it is too late. Object.


How know you that? Have you seen the Book of Life, or turned over the Records
of Eternity? Or do you not unwarrantably Sol.
intrude into the secrets of God which belong not to you? Besides, if the
treaty were at an end, how is it that thy heart is now distressed for sin, and
solicitous after deliverance from it?

But I have waited long, and yet see no mercy for me.

May not mercy be coming, and you not see it? or have you Object.
not waited at the wrong door? If you wait for the mercy of Sol.
God, through Christ, in the way of humiliation and faith, and continue
waiting; assuredly mercy shall come at last.

Inference 5.
Has God performed the mercy promised to the Fathers, the great mercy, the
capital mercy Jesus Christ, then let no Inference 5.
man distrust God for the performance of lesser mercies, contained in any other
promises of the Scripture: the performance of this mercy secures the
performance of all other mercies to us. For,

First, Christ is a greater mercy than any other which yet remains to be
performed, Romans 8. 32.

Secondly, This mercy virtually comprehends all other mercies, 1 Cor. 3. 21,
22, 23.

Thirdly, The promises that contain all other mercies are ratified and
confirmed to Believers in Christ, 2 Cor. 1. 20.

Fourthly, It was much more improbable that God would bestow his own Son upon
the world, than that he should bestow any other mercy upon it. Wait therefore
in a comfortable expectation of the fulfilling of all the rest of the promises
in their seasons: has he given thee Christ, he will give thee bread to eat,
raiment to put on, support in troubles, and whatsoever else thy soul or body
stands in need of: the blessings contained in all other promises are fully
secured by the performance of this great promise: thy pardon, peace, acceptance
with God now, and enjoyment of him for ever, shall be fulfilled: the great
mercy Christ, makes way for all other mercies to the souls of Believers.

Inference 6.
Lastly, How mad are they that part with Christ, the best of Inference 6.
mercies, to secure and preserve any temporal, lesser mercies to themselves!
Thus Demas and Judas gave up Christ to gain a little of the world: O
soul-undoing bargain! How dear do they pay for the world, that purchase it with
the loss of Christ, and their own peace for ever!

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ the mercy of mercies.
The Twelfth SERMON. Sermon 12.

CANT. 5. part of verse 16. Text. Containing a third motive to enliven the
general exhortation, from a third title of Christ.
-- yea, he is altogether lovely.
AT the ninth verse of this Chapter you have a query propounded to the Spouse,
by the Daughters of Jerusalem, What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved?
To this question the Spouse returns her answer in the following verses, wherein
she asserts his excellency in general, verse. 10. He is the chiefest among ten
thousands: confirms that general assertion by an enumeration of his particular
excellencies to verse. 16. where she closes up her Character and Encomium of her
Beloved, with an elegant Epiphonema, in the words that I have read, Yea, he is
altogether lovely.

The words, you see, are an affirmative proposition, setting forth the
transcendent loveliness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and naturally resolve
themselves into three parts, viz.

1. The Subject. 2. The Predicate. 3. The manner of Predication.
First, The subject, He, viz. the Lord Jesus Christ, after 1.
whom she had been seeking: for whom she was sick of love: concerning whom
these Daughters of Jerusalem had enquired: whom she had endeavored so
graphically to describe in his particular excellencies. This is the great and
excellent Subject of whom she here speaks.

Secondly, The predicate, or what she affirms or says of 2.
him, viz. that he is a lovely one, machamaddim, desires, according to the
import of the original which signifies earnestly Significat appetere, expetere
quod jucundum, gratum, voluptuosum, utile and amabile est. Pagn.
to desire, covet or long for that which is most pleasant, grateful, delectable
and amiable; the original word is both in the abstract, and of the plural
number, which speaks Christ to be the very essence of all delights and
pleasures, the very soul and substance of them. As all the Rivers be gathered
into the Ocean, which is the congregation or meetingplace of all the waters in
the world: so Christ is that Ocean in which all true delights and pleasures
meet.

Thirdly, The manner of predication, He is [altogether] 3.
lovely, totus, totus desiderabilis, lovely in all and in every part, as if she
had said, Look on him in what respect or particular you will, cast your eye
upon this lovely object and view him any way, turn him in your serious thoughts
which way you will; consider his Person, his Offices, his Works, or any thing
belonging to him, you shall find him altogether lovely: there is nothing
ungrateful in him, there is nothing lovely without him.

Hence note,

DOCT.
That Jesus Christ is the loveliest person souls can set their eyes Doct.
upon: Psalm. 45. 2. Thou art fairer than the children of men. That is said of
Jesus Christ, which cannot be said of any creature, that he is altogether
lovely. In opening this lovely point, I shall,

1. Weigh the importance of this phrase, altogether lovely. 2. Show you in what
respects Christ is so.
First, Let us weigh this excellent expression, and particularly 1.
consider, what is involved in it, and you shall find this expression,
Altogether lovely:

First, That it excludes all unloveliness, and distastefulness from Jesus
Christ. So Vatablus, there is nothing in him which Nibil in to quod non est
am^bile.
is not amiable: the excellencies of Christ are perfectly exclusive of all
their opposites: there is nothing of a contrary nature or quality found in him
to allay or debase his excellency: and in this respect Christ infinitely
transcends the most excellent and loveliest creatures: for whatsoever
loveliness is found in them it is not without a distasteful tang: the fairest
Pictures must have their shadows: the most orient and transplendent Stones must
have their foiles to set off their beauty: the best creature is but a
bitter-sweet at best: if there be somewhat pleasing, there is also somewhat
distasting: if there be gracious and natural excellencies in the same person to
delight us, yet there is also some natural corruption intermixed with it to
distaste us: but it is not so in our altogether lovely Christ: his excellencies
are pure and unmixed, he is a Sea of Sweetness, without one drop of Gall.

Secondly, Altogether lovely (i. e.) as there is nothing unlovely found in him,
so all that is in him is wholly lovely: as Quantus quantus est, summis studi is
and votis est expetendus, Brightman.
every raye of Gold is precious, so every thing that is in Christ is precious:
who can weigh Christ in a pair of balances, and tell you what his worth is?
His price is above Rubies, and all that thou can desire is not to be compared
with him, Prove. 8. 11.

Thirdly, Altogether lovely, (i. e.) he is comprehensive of all things that are
lovely: he seals up the sum of all loveliness: quae faciunt divisa beatum, in
hoc mixta fluunt; things that shine as single stars with a particular glory,
all meet in Christ as a glorious constellation, Col. 1. 19. It pleased the
Father, that in him should all fullness dwell. Cast your eyes among all created
beings, survey the Universe, observe strength in one, beauty in a second,
faithfulness in a third, wisdom in a fourth; but you shall find none excelling
in them all as Christ does. Bread has one quality, Water another, Raiment
another, Physic another, but none has all in it self as Christ has: he is
bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, a garment to the naked, healing to
the wounded, and whatever a soul can desire is found in him, 1 Cor. 1. 30.

Fourthly, Altogether lovely, (i. e.) nothing is lovely in opposition to him,
or in separation from him; if he be altogether lovely, then whatsoever is
opposite to, or separate from him, can have no loveliness in it: take away
Christ, and where is the loveliness of any enjoyment? The best creature comfort
out of Christ is but a broken Cistern, or a Vessel whose bottom is fallen out,
it cannot hold one drop of true comfort, Psalm. 73. 25. It is with the creature,
the sweetest and loveliest creature, as with a beautiful image in the Glass;
turn away the Face, and where is the Image? Riches, Honors, and comfortable
Relations are sweet when the face of Christ smiles upon us through them, but
without him what empty trifles are they all?

Fifthly, Altogether lovely, (i. e.) transcending all created excellencies in
beauty and loveliness, so much it speaks: if you compare Christ and other
things, be they never so lovely, never so excellent and desirable; Christ
carries away all loveliness from them, he is (says the Apostle) before all
things, Col. 1. 17. not only before all things in time, nature, and order; but
before all things in dignity, glory and true excellency: in all things he must
have the preeminence: for let us but compare Christ's excellency with the
creatures, in a few particulars, and how evidently will the transcendent
loveliness of Jesus Christ appear! For,

First, All other loveliness is derivative and secondary, but the loveliness of
Christ is original and primary. Angels and men, the world and all the
desirables in it, receive what excellency they have from him, they are streams
from the fountain: but as the waters in the fountain it self are more Dulcius
ex ips^ font bibuntur aquae.
abundant, so more pure and pleasant than in the streams: and the farther any
thing departs and is removed from its fountain and original, the less
excellency there is in it.

Secondly, The loveliness and excellency of all other things is but relative
and respective, consisting in its reference to Christ, and subserviency to his
glory; but Christ is lovely considered absolutely in himself: he is desirable
for himself, other things are so for him.

Thirdly, The beauty and loveliness of all other things is fading and
perishing, but the loveliness of Christ is fresh to all eternity: the sweetness
of the best of creatures is a Fading flower, if not before, yet certainly at
death it must fade away, Job 4. 21. Does not their excellency which is in them
go away? Yes, yes, whether natural excellencies of the body, or acquired
endowments of the mind, lovely features, amiable qualities, attracting
excellencies: all these like pleasant flowers are withered, faded, and
destroyed by death: but Christ is still the same, yesterday, to day and for
ever, Heb. 13. 8.

Fourthly, The beauty and loveliness of creatures is ensna ring, and dangerous;
a man may make an Idol of it, and dote beyond the bounds of moderation upon it:
but there is no danger of excess in the love of Christ: the soul is then in the
healthiest frame and temper, when it is most sick of love to Christ, Cant. 5. 8.

Fifthly, The loveliness of every creature is of a cloying and glutting nature:
our estimation of it abates, and links by our nearer approach to it, or longer
enjoyment of it: creatures like Pictures are fairest at a due distance; but it
is not so with Christ, the nearer the soul approaches him, and the longer it
lives in the enjoyment of him, still the more sweet and desirable he is.

Sixthly, Lastly, All other loveliness is unsatisfying, and straitning to the
soul of man: there is not room enough in any one, or in all the creatures for
the soul of man to dilate and expatiate it self; but it still feels it self
pinch't in, Aestuat infelix angusto ^mite mundi.
and narrowed within those strait limits: and this comes to pass from the
inadequateness and unsuitableness of the creature to the nobler and more
excellent soul of man: which like a Ship in a narrow River has not room to
turn, and besides is ever and anon striking ground, and foundring in those
shallows: but Jesus Christ is every way adequate to the vast desires of the
soul: in him it has Sea-room enough: there it may spread all its fails, no
fear of touching the bottom. And thus you see what is the importance of this
phrase, altogether lovely.

Secondly, Next I promised to show you in what respects Jesus Christ is
altogether lovely. And, 2.


First, He is altogether lovely in his person; a deity dwelling in flesh, Joh.
1. 14. The wonderful union and perfection of the divine and humane nature in
Christ renders him an object of admiration and adoration to Angels and men, 1 Timothy 3. 16. God never presented to the world such a vision of glory before: and
then considering how the humane nature of our Lord Jesus Christ is replenished
with all the graces of the Spirit, so as never any of all the Saints was
filled; O how lovely does this render him! Joh. 3. 34. God gives not the
Spirit by measure unto him: this makes him fairer than the children of men,
grace being poured into his lips, Psalm. 45. 2. If a small measure of grace in
the Saints makes them such sweet and desirable companions, what must the
riches and fullness of the Spirit of grace, filling Jesus Christ without
measure, make him in the eyes of believers? O what a glory and a luster must it
stamp upon him!

Secondly, He is altogether lovely in his Offices: for let us but consider the
suitableness, fullness, and comfortableness of them.

First, The suitableness of the Offices of Christ to the miseries and wants of
men, and we cannot but adore the infinite wisdom of God in his investiture with
them: we are by nature blind and ignorant, at best but groping in the dim light
of nature after God: Acts 17. 27. Jesus Christ is a light to lighten the
Gentiles, Isai. 49. 6. When this great Prophet came into the world, then did
the dayspring from on high visit us, Luke 1. 78. The state of nature is a
state of alienation and enmity to God; Christ comes into the world an attoning
sacrifice, making peace by the blood of his Cross, Col. 1. 20. All the world,
by nature, are in bondage and captivity to Satan, a lamentable thraldom:
Christ's comes with a kingly power to rescue sinners, as a prey, from the mouth
of the terrible one.

Secondly, Let the fullness of his Offices be also considered, by reason whereof
he is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God by him, Heb. 7. 25.
The three Offices comprising in them all that our souls do need become an
universal relief to all our wants; and therefore,

Thirdly, Unspeakably comfortable must the Offices of Christ be to the souls of
sinners: if light be pleasant to our eyes, how pleasant is that light of life
springing from the Sun of righteousness! Mal. 4. 2. If a pardon be sweet to a
condemned malefactor, how sweet must the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus be to
the trembling Conscience of a lawcondemned-sinner? If a rescue from a cruel
Tyrant be sweet to a poor Captive; how sweet must it be to the ears of inslaved
sinners to hear the voice of liberty and deliverance proclaimed by Jesus
Christ? Out of the several Offices of Christ, as out of so many fountains, all
the promises of the new Covenant flow; as so many soul refreshing streams of
peace and joy: all the promises of illumination, counsel and direction flow out
of the Prophetical Office: all the promises of reconciliation, peace, pardon,
and acceptance flow out of the Priestly Office, with the sweet streams of Joy
and Spiritual comfort depending thereupon: all the promises of converting,
increasing, defending, directing, and supplying grace, flow out of the Kingly
Office of Christ: indeed all promises may be reduced to the three Offices: so
that Jesus Christ must needs be altogether lovely in his Offices.

Thirdly, Jesus Christ is altogether lovely in his relations.

First, He is a lovely Redeemer, Isai. 61. 1. he came to open the Prison-dores
to them that are bound. Needs must this Redeemer be a lovely one, if we
consider the depth of misery from which he redeemed us, even from the wrath to
come, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 10. How lovely was Titus in the eyes of the poor enthralled
Greeks, whom he delivered from their bondage! This endeared him to them unto
that degree, that when their liberty was proclaimed, they even trod one
another to death to see the Herald that proclaimed it; and all the night
following with instruments of music danced about his Tent, crying with united
voices A Savior, a Savior. Or whether we consider the numbers redeemed, and
the means of their redemption, Rev. 5. 9. And they sang a new Song, saying,
Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: for thou wast
slain, and have redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
tongue, and people, and nation. He redeemed us not with Silver and Gold, but
with his own precious Blood by way of price, 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. with his
outstretched and glorious arm, by way of power, Col. 1. 13. he redeemed us
freely, Ephesians. 1. 7. fully, Romans 8. 1. seasonably, Gal. 4. 4. and out of special
and peculiar love, Joh. 17. 9. In a word, he has redeemed us for ever, never
more to come into bondage, 1 Pet. 1. 5. Joh. 10. 28. Oh how lovely is Jesus
Christ in the relation of a Redeemer to Gods elect!

Secondly, He is a lovely Bridegroom to all that he espouses to himself: how
does the Church glory in him, in the words following my Text, This is my
Beloved, and this is my Friend, O ye Daughters of Jerusalem; (q. d.) Heaven and
earth cannot show such another: which needs no fuller proof than the following
particulars.

First, That he espouseth to himself in mercy, and in loving kindness, such
deformed, defiled, and altogether unworthy souls as we are; who have no beauty,
no excellency to make us desirable in his eyes: all the springs of his love to
us are in his own breast, Deuteronomy. 7. 7. He chooses us not because we were, but
that he might make us lovely, Ephesians. 5. 27. He passed by us when we lay in our
blood, and said unto us live, and that was the time of love, Ezec. 16. 5.

Secondly, He expects nothing with us, and yet bestows himself, and all he has
upon us: our poverty cannot enrich him, but he made himself poor to enrich us,
2 Cor. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 3. 22.

Thirdly, No Husband loves the Wife of his bosom at the rate Christ loved his
people, Ephesians. 5. 25. He loved the Church, and gave himself for it.

Fourthly, None bears with weaknesses, and provocations as Christ does, the
Church is styled the Lambs Wife, Rev. 21. 9.

Fifthly, No Husband is so immortal and everlasting a Husband as Christ is.
Death separates all other relations, but the souls union with Christ is not
dissolved in the Grave: yea, the day of a Believers death is his marriage-day,
the day of his fullest enjoyment of Christ: no Husband can say to his Wife what
Christ says to the Believer, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, Heb.
13. 5.

Sixthly, No Bridegroom advances his Bride to such honors by Marriage as
Christ does: he relates them to God as their Father; and from that day the
mighty and glorious Angels think it no dishonor to be their servants, Heb. 1.
14. They are brought in admiring the beauty and glory of the Spouse of Christ,
Rev. 21. 9.

Seventhly, and Lastly, No marriage was ever consummated with that triumphal
solemnity, as the marriage of Christ and Believers shall be in Heaven, Psalm.
45. 14, 15. She shall be brought to the King in raiment of needle work, the
virgins, her companions, that follow her, shall be brought unto thee, with
gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought, they shall enter into the Kings
Palace. Among the Jews the marriage house was called Bethillula, the house of
praise: there was joy upon all hands; but not like the joy that will be in
Heaven, when Believers, the Spouse of Christ, shall be brought thither; God the
Father will rejoice to behold the blessed accomplishment and consummation of
that glorious design and project of his love. Jesus Christ the Bridegroom will
rejoice to see the travail of his soul, the blessed birth and issue of all his
bitter pangs and agonies, Isai. 53. 11. The holy Spirit will rejoice to see the
complement and perfection of that sanctifying design which was committed to his
hand, 2 Cor. 5. 5. To see those souls whom he once found as rough stones, now
to shine as the bright polished stones of the Spiritual Temple. Angels will
rejoice; great was the joy when the foundation of this design was laid in the
incarnation of Christ: Luke 2. 13. Great therefore must their joy be when the
top-stone is set up with shouting, crying, Grace, grace. The Saints themselves
shall rejoice unspeakably when they shall enter into the Kings Palace, and be
for ever with the Lord, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 17. Indeed there will be joy on all hands,
except among the Devils, and damned; who shall gnash their teeth with envy at
the everlasting advancement and glory of Believers. Thus Christ is altogether
lovely, in the relation of a Bridegroom.

Thirdly, Christ is altogether lovely in the relation of an Advocate, 1 John 2.
1. If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous, and he is the propitiation; it is he that pleads the cause of
Believers in Heaven: appears for them in the presence of God, to prevent all
new breaches, and continue the state of friendship and peace betwixt God and
us. In this relation Christ is altogether lovely. For,

First, He makes our cause his own, and acts for us in Heaven as for himself,
Heb. 4. 15. He is touched with the tender sense of our troubles and dangers,
and is not only one with us by way of representation, but also one with us in
respect of sympathy and affection.

Secondly, Christ our Advocate follows our suit, and business in Heaven, as his
great and main design and business, therefore in Heb. 7. 25. he is said to live
for ever to make intercession for us: as if our concernments were so minded by
him there, as to give up himself wholly to that work: as if all the glory and
honor which is paid him in Heaven, would not satisfy him, or divert him one
moment from our business.

Thirdly, He pleads the cause of Believers by his blood: it satisfies him not
as other Advocates, to be at the expense of words and oratory, which is a
cheaper way of pleading; but he pleads for us by the voice of his own blood,
Heb. 12. 24. where we are said to be come to the blood of sprinkling, that
speaks better things than that of Abel: every wound he received for us on
earth, is a mouth opened to plead with God on our behalf in Heaven, quot
vulnera, tot ora: and hence it is that in Rev. 5. 6. he is represented standing
before God, as a Lamb that had been slain: as it were exhibiting and opening in
Heaven those deadly wounds received on earth, from the justice of God upon our
account: other Advocates spend their breath, Christ his blood.

Fourthly, He pleads the cause of Believers freely: other Advocates plead for
reward, and exhaust the Purses while they plead the causes of their Clients.

Fifthly, In a word, he obtains for us all the mercies for which he pleads;
no cause miscarries in his hand which he undertakes, Romans 8. 33, 34. O what a
lovely Advocate is Christ for Believers!

Fourthly, Christ is altogether lovely in the relation of a Friend, for in this
relation he is pleased to own his people, Luke 12. 4, 5. There are certain
things in which one friend manifests his affection and friendship to another,
but none like Christ. For,

First, No Friend is so open-hearted to his friend as Christ is to his people:
he reveals the very counsels and secrets of his heart to them, Joh. 15. 15.
Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knows not what his Lord
does; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my
Father, I have made known unto you.

Secondly, No Friend in the world is so expensive and bountiful to his friend,
as Jesus Christ is to Believers, Joh. 15. 13. He parts with his very blood for
them: greater love (says he) has no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends: he has exhausted the precious treasures of this
invaluable blood to pay our debts. O what a lovely friend is Jesus Christ to
Believers!

Thirdly, No Friend sympathises so tenderly with his Friend in affliction, as
Jesus Christ does with his friends: in all our afflictions he is afflicted,
Heb. 4. 15. He feels all our sorrows, wants and burdens as his own. Whence it
is that the sufferings of Believers are called the sufferings of Christ, Col.
1. 24.

Fourthly, No Friend in the world takes that complacency in his Friend as Jesus
Christ does in Believers, Cant. 4. 9. Thou have ravished my heart (says he to
the Spouse) thou have ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain
of thy neck: the Hebrew here rendered ravished, signifies to puff up, or to make
one proud; how is the Lord Jesus pleased to glory in his people! how is he
taken and delighted with those gracious ornaments which himself bestows upon
them! no friend so lovely as Christ.

Fifthly, No Friend in the world loves his Friend with so ferverous, and strong
affection, as Jesus Christ loves Believers. Jacob loved Rachel, and endured for
her sake the parching heat of Summer, and cold of Winter: but Christ endured
the storms of the wrath of God, the heat of his ^ignation for our sakes. David
manifested his love to (...), in wishing, O that I had died for thee! Christ
manifested his love to us, not in wishes that he had died, but in death it
self, in our stead, and for our sakes.

Sixthly, No Friend in the world is so constant and unch^ble in friendship, as
Christ is, Joh. 13. 1. Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
them unto the end. He bears with millions of provocations, and injuries, and
yet will not break friendship with his people. Peter denied him, yet he will
not disown him; but after his resurrection he says, go, tell the Disciples,
and tell Peter, (q. d.) let him not think he has forfeited by that sin of his,
his interest in me; though he have denied me, I will not disown him, Mark 16.
7. Oh how lovely is Christ in the relation of a friend! I might farther show
you the loveliness of Christ in his Ordinances, and in his providence, in his
communion with us, and communications to us: but there is no end of the account
of Christ's loveliness. I will rather choose to press Believers to their dutys
toward this altogether lovely Christ, which I shall briefly dispatch in a few
words.

Use 1.
First, Is Jesus Christ altogether lovely, then I beseech Use 1.
you set your souls upon this lovely Jesus: methinks such an object as has
been here represented should compel love from the coldest breast, and hardest
heart. Away with those empty nothings, away with this vain deceitful world
which deserves not the thousandth part of the love you give it: let all stand
aside, and give way to Christ. O did you but know his worth and excellency,
what he is in himself, what he has done for, and deserved from you; you would
need no arguments of mine to persuade you to love him.

Secondly, Esteem nothing lovely, but as it is enjoyed in 2.
Christ, or improved for Christ: affect nothing for it self, love nothing
separate from Jesus Christ. In two things we all sin in the love of creatures,
viz. in the excess of our affections, loving them above the rate, and value of
creatures, and in the inordinacy of our affections, (i. e.) in loving them out
of their proper places.

Thirdly, Let us all be humbled for the baseness of our hearts, 3.
that are so free of their affections to vanities, and trifles; and so hard to
be persuaded to the love of Christ, who is altogether lovely. Oh how many pour
out streams of love and delight upon the vain and empty creature, whilst no
arguments can squeese out one drop of love from their obdurate and unbelieving
hearts to Jesus Christ! I have read of one Johannes Mollius, who was observed
to go often alone, and weep bitterly; and being pressed by a Friend to know the
cause of his trouble; Oh, said he, it grieves me that I cannot bring this heart
of mine to love Jesus Christ more fervently.

Fourthly, Represent Christ as he is to the world, by your 4.
carriages toward him: Is he altogether lovely? Let all the world see and know
that he is so, by your delights in him, and communion with him, zeal for him,
and readiness to part with any other lovely thing upon his account: proclaim
his excellencies to the world, as the Spouse here did: convince them how much
your Beloved is better than any other Beloved. Display his glorious
excellencies in your heavenly Conversations: hold him forth to others, as he is
in himself, altogether lovely. See that you walk worthy of him unto all
well-pleasing, Col. 1. 10. Show forth the praises of Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 9. Let
not that worthy name be blasphemed through you, James 2. 7. He is glorious in
himself, and will put glory upon you; take heed ye put not shame and dishonor
upon him: he has committed his honor to you, do not betray that trust.

Fifthly, Never be ashamed to own Christ: he is altogether 5.
lovely: he can never be a shame to you: 'twill be your great sin, to be
ashamed of him. Some men glory in their shame, be not you ashamed of your
glory: if you be ashamed of Christ now, he will be ashamed of you, when he
shall appear in his own glory, and the glory of all his holy Angels. Be ashamed
of nothing but sin, and among other sins, be ashamed especially for this sin,
that you have no more love for him who is altogether lovely.

Sixthly, Be willing to leave every thing that is lovely upon 6.
earth, that you may be with the altogether lovely Lord Jesus Christ in Heaven.
Lift up your voices with the Spouse, Rev. 20. 20. Come Lord Jesus, come
quickly. It Is true, you must pass through the pangs of death into his bosom and
enjoyment; but sure it is worth suffering much more than that, to be with this
lovely Jesus. The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and the patient
waiting for of Jesus Christ, 2 These. 3. 5.

Seventhly, Strive to be Christ-like, as ever you would be 7.
lovely in the eyes of God and men. Certainly my Brethren, it is the Spirit of
Christ within you, and the beauty of Christ upon you, which only can make you
lovely persons: the more you resemble him in holiness, the more will you
discover of true excellency and loveliness: and the more frequent and spiritual
your converse and communion with Christ is, the more of the beauty and
loveliness of Christ will still be stamped upon your Spirits, changing you into
the same image from glory to glory.

Eighthly, Let the loveliness of Christ draw all men to 8.
him. Is loveliness in the creature, embodied beauty, so attractive? And can
the transcendent loveliness of Christ draw none? Oh the blindness of man! If
you see no beauty in Christ, why you should desire him, it is because the God of
this world has blinded your minds.

The Thirteenth SERMON. Sermon 13.

HAGGAI 2. 7. Text. Alluring the hearts of men to come to Christ by a fourth
motive, contained in another Title of Christ.
-- And the desire of all Nations, shall come.
THe former Chapter is mainly spent in reproving the negligence of the Jews,
who being discouraged from time to time, had delayed the rebuilding the Temple:
and in the mean time employed their care, and cost in building and adorning
their own houses: but at last being persuaded to set about the work, they meet
with this discouragement, that such was the poverty of the present time, that
the second structure would no way answer the magnificence and splendour of the
first. In Solomon's days the Nation was wealthy, now drained, so that there
would be no proportion betwixt the second and the first. To this grand
discouragement, the Prophet applies this relief, that whatsoever should be
wanting in external pomp and glory, should be more than recompensed by the
presence of Jesus Christ in this second Temple. For Christ, the desire of all
Nations (says he) shall come into it. Which by the way may give us this useful
note, That the presence of Jesus Christ gives a more real and excellent glory
to the places of his worship, than any external beauty, or outward ornaments
whatsoever can bestow upon them. Our eyes like the Disciples are apt to be
dazzled with the goodly stones of the Temple, and in the mean time to neglect,
and overlook that which gives it its greatest honor and beauty.

But to return, In these words we have both the description of Christ, and an
index pointing at the time of his incarnation; he is called the desire of all
Nations: and the time of his coming in the flesh, it is plainly intimated to be
while the second Temple should be standing: where by the way, we find just
cause to admire and bemoan the blindness that is happened to the Jews; who owning
the truth of this Prophecy, and not able to deny the destruction of the second
Temple, many hundred years past, will not yet be brought to acknowledge the
incarnation of the true Messiah, notwithstanding.

But to the point, the character or description of Christ, styled the desire of
all nations, who was to come into the world in the time of the second Temple,
Mal. 3. 12. and that after grievous concussions and shakings of the world,
which were to make way for his coming, for so our Prophet here speaks, I will
shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, to which the
Apostle alludes in Heb. 12. 26. applying this prophecy to Jesus Christ, here
called the desire of all Nations: putting the act for the object, desire for
the thing desired; as in Ezec. 24. 16. the desire of thine eyes, that is the
desirable Wife of thy bosom. So here the desire of all nations, that is Christ
the object of the desires of Gods elect in all nations of the world. A Savior
infinitely desirable in himself, and actually desired by all the people of
God, dispersed among all kindreds, tongues and nations in the world.

From whence this note is,

DOCT.
That the desires of Gods Elect in all Kingdoms, and among Doct.
all people of the earth, are and shall be drawn out after, and fixed upon the
Lord Jesus Christ.

The merciful God beholding the universal ruins of the world by sin, has
provided an universal remedy for his own Elect, in every part of the earth.
Christ is not impropriated to any one Kingdom or Nation in the world; but
intended to be Gods salvation to the ends of the earth, and accordingly speaks
the Apostle, Col. 2. 11. There is neither Greek nor Jew, Barbarian, Scythian,
Bond nor Free; but Christ is all, and in all. In the explication of this point,
two things must be enquired into.

1. Why Christ is called the desire of all Nations. 2. Upon what account the
people of God in all Nations desire him.
First, Why he is called the desire of all Nations: and 1.
what that Phrase may import: and there are diverse things that are supposed or
included in it.

First, That God the Father has appointed him as a common remedy, for the sins
and miseries of his people in all parts and quarters of the world. So in the
Covenant of Redemption betwixt the Father and the Son, the Lord expresses
himself, Isai. 49. 6. and he said, It is a light thing that thou should be
my servant, to raise up the Tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of
Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou may be
my salvation to the end of the earth. Suitable whereunto is that Prophecy,
Isai. 52. 15. He shall sprinkle many Nations. If God had not appointed him for,
he could not be desired by all Nations.

And indeed herein the grace of God does admirably shine forth in the freeness
of it, that even the most barbarous Nations are not excluded from the benefit
of redemption by Christ. This is that the Apostle admires, that Christ should
be preached to the Gentiles, 1 Timothy 3. 16. A people that seemed to be lost in
the darkness of Idolatry; yet even for them Christ was given by the Father. Ask
of me (says he) and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

Secondly, Christ the desire of all Nations, plainly notes the sufficiency that
is in him to supply the wants of the whole world: as the Sun in the Heavens
suffices all Nations for light and influence, so does the Sun of Righteousness
suffice for the Redemption, Justification, Sanctification and salvation of the
people of God, all the world over, Isa. 45. 22. Look unto me, and be ye saved
all ye ends of the earth.

Thirdly, It implies the reality that is in godliness: it shows you that
Religion is no fancy, as the Atheistical world would persuade us: and this
evidently appears in the uniform effects of it upon the hearts of all men in
all nations of the world, that are truly religious: all their desires, like so
many Needles touched by one and the same Loadstone, move toward Jesus Christ,
and all meet together in one and the same blessed object Christ. Were it
possible for the people of God to come out of all Nations, Kindreds and
Languages in the world, into one place, and there confer, and compare the
desires and workings of their hearts; though they never saw each others face,
nor heard of each others name; yet as face answers to face in a glass, so would
their desires after Christ answer to each other: all hearts work after him in
the same manner, what one says, all say; these are my troubles and burdens,
these my wants and miseries: the same things my desires and fears: one and the
same Spirit harmonically works in all Believers through the world, which could
never be, if Religion were but a fancy as some call it, or a combination or
confederacy as others call it: fancies are as various as faces; and
confederacies presuppose mutual acquaintance, and conference.

Fourthly, Christ the desire of all Nations implies the vast extent his Kingdom
has and shall have in the world: out of every Nation under Heaven some shall
be brought to Christ, and to Heaven by him. And though the number of Gods
elect, compared with the multitudes of the ungodly in all Nations, is but a
remnant, a little flock, and in that comparative sense there are few that shall
be saved; yet considered absolutely, and in themselves, they are a vast number,
which no man can number, Mat. 8. 11. Many shall come from the East, and from
the West, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom
of Heaven. In order whereunto the Gospel, like the Sun in the Heavens, circuits
the world: it arose in the East, and takes its course toward the western
world: rising by degrees upon the remote Idolatrous Nations of the earth; out
of all which a number is to be saved, even Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands
to God, Pfal. 68. 31. And this consideration should move us to pray carnestly
for the poor Heathens, who yet sit in darkness, and the shadow of death; there
is yet hope for them.

Fifthly, It holds forth this, that when God opens the eyes of men to see their
sin, and danger by it; nothing but Christ can give them satisfaction: it is not
the amenity, fertility, riches and pleasures the Inhabitants of any Kingdom of
the world do enjoy, that can quench and satisfy the desires of their souls:
when once God touches their hearts with the sense of sin and misery: Christ and
none but Christ is desirable and necessary in the eyes of such persons. Many
Kingdoms of the world abound with riches and pleasures, the providence of God
has carved liberal portions of the good things of this life to many of them,
and scarce left any thing to their desires that the world can afford. Yet all
this can give no satisfaction without Jesus Christ, the desire of Nations, the
one thing necessary, when once they come to see the necessity and excellency of
him: then take the world who will, so they may have Christ the desire of their
souls. Thus we see upon what grounds and reasons Christ is styled the desire of
all Nations.

But there lies one great Objection against this truth, Object.
which must be satisfied, viz. if Christ be the desire of all Nations, how
comes it to pass, that Jesus Christ finds no entertainment in so many Nations
of the world, among whom Christianity is hissed at, and Christians not
tolerated to live among them; who see no beauty in him that they should
dedesire him.

First, We must remember the Nations of the World have their times and seasons
of conversion. Those that Sol.
once embraced Christ, have now lost him, and Idols are now set up in the
places where he once was sweetly worshipped. The Sun of the Gospel is gone down
upon them, and now shines in another Hemisphere: and so the Nations of the
World are to have their distinct days, and seasons of illumination. The Gospel,
like the Sea, gains in one place what it loses in another: and in the times
and seasons appointed by the Father they come successively to be enlightened in
the knowledge of Christ; and then shall that promise be fulfilled, Isai. 49. 7.
Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom the
nation abhors, to a servant of Rulers; Kings shall see and arise, Princes
also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful.

Secondly, Let it also be remembered, that although Christ be rejected by the
Rulers and Body of many Nations; yet he is the desire of all the Elect of God
dispersed, and scattered among those Nations.

Secondly, In the next place we are to enquire, upon what 2.
account Christ becomes the desire of all Nations, (i. e.) of all those in all
the Nations of the world that belong to the election of grace. And the true
ground and reason thereof is, because Christ only has that in himself which
relieves their wants and answers to all their needs. As,

First, They are all by nature under condemnation, Romans 5. 16, 18. under the
curse of the Law; against which nothing is found in Heaven or earth able to
relieve their Consciences but the blood of sprinkling, the pure and perfect
righteousness of the Lord Jesus: and hence it is that Christ becomes so
desirable in the eyes of poor sinners all the world over. If any thing in
nature could be found to pacify and purge the Consciences of men from guilt
and fear; Christ would never be desirable in their eyes; but finding no other
remedy but the blood of Jesus, to him therefore shall all the ends of the earth
look for righteousness and for peace.

Secondly, All Nations of the world are polluted with the filth of sin, both in
nature and practice, which they shall see, and bitterly bewail when the light
of the Gospel shall shine amongst them; and the same light by which this shall
be discovered, will also discover the only remedy of this evil to I Will in the
spirit of Christ, the only fountain opened to all Nations for sanctification
and cleansing: and this will make the Lord Jesus incomparably desirous in their
eyes. Oh how welcome will he be that comes unto them, not by blood only, but
by water also! John 1. 5, 6.

Thirdly, When the light of the Gospel shall shine upon the Nations, they shall
then see, that by reason of the guilt and filth of sin, they are all barred out
of Heaven. Those doors are chained up against them, and that none but Christ
can open an entrance for them into that Kingdom of God: that no man comes to
the Father but by him, John 14. 6. neither is there any name under Heaven given
among men, whereby they must be saved, but the name of Christ, Act. 4. 12.
Hence the hearts of sinners shall pant after him, as the Heart pants for the
water brooks. And thus we see upon what grounds Christ becomes the desire of
all Nations. The improvement of all follows in five several uses of the
point, viz.

1. For Information. 2. For Examination. 3. For Consolation. 4. For
Exhortation. 5. For Direction.
Use for Information.
First, Is Christ the desire of all Nations, How vile a sin is Use 1.
it then in any Nation, upon whom the light of the Gospel has shined, to
reject Jesus Christ, and say as those in Job 21. 14. Depart from us, we desire
not the knowledge of thy ways. To thrust away his worship, government, and
servants from amongst them, and in effect to say as it is, Luke 19. 14. we will
not have this man to reign over us: thus did the Jews, Act. 13. 46. they put
away Christ from among them, and thereby judged themselves unworthy of eternal
life. This is at once a fearful sin, and a dreadful sign: how soon did
vengeance overtake them, like the overthrow of Sodom! O let it be for a warning
unto all Nations to the end of the world. He would have gathered the Children
of Israel under his wings, as a Hen does her brood, even when the Roman Eagle
was hovering over them, but they would not: therefore their Houses were left
unto them desolate, their City and Temple made an heap.

Secondly, If Jesus Christ be the desire of all Nations, how incomparably happy
then must that Nation be, that enjoys Christ in the power and purity of his
Gospel Ordinances! If Christ under a vail made Canaan a glorious land (as it is
called) Dan. 11. 41. what a glorious place must that Nation be that beholds him
with open face in the bright Sunshine of the Gospel! O England know thy
happiness, and the day of thy visitation: what others desire thou enjoyest:
provoke not the Lord Jesus to depart from thee, by corrupting his worship,
hankering after Idolatry, abusing his Messengers, oppressing his people, lest
his soul depart from thee.

2d Use for Examination.
If Christ be the desire of all Nations, examine whether he Use 2.
be the desire of your souls in particular, else you shall have no benefit by
him. Are your desires after Christ true spiritual desires? Reflect, I beseech
you, upon the frames and tempers of your hearts. Can you say of your desires
after Christ, as Peter did of his love to Christ, Lord, thou know all
things, thou know that I desire thee: try your desires as to their
sincerity, by the following characters.

First, Are they vehement and ardent? has Christ the supreme place in your
desires? do you esteem all things to be but dross and dung in comparison of the
excellencies of Jesus Christ your Lord? Phil. 3. 8. Is he to you as the refuge
City to the manslayer, Heb. 6. 18, 19. as a spring of water in a dry place, as
the shadow of a great Rock in a weary land, Isai. 32. 2. Such vehement desires
are true desires.

Secondly, Are your desires after Christ universal? (i. e.) is every thing in
Christ desirable in your eyes? the Hypocrite like the Harlot is for a divided
Christ: they would be called by his name, but live upon their own stock, Isai.
4. 1. if his holiness, and government, his cross, and sufferings be desirable
for his sake, such universal desires are right desires.

Thirdly, Are your desires after Christ industrious desires, using all the
means of accomplishing what you desire? You say you desire Christ, but what
will you do to obtain your desires? If you seek him carefully and incessantly
in all the ways of duty, if you will strive in prayer, labor to believe, cut
off right hands, and pluck out right eyes, (i. e.) be content to part with the
most profitable and pleasant ways of sin, that you may enjoy Christ the desire
of your souls, then are your desires right desires.

Fourthly, Are your desires after Christ permanent desires, or only a sudden
mood and fit, which goes off again without effect? If your desires after Christ
abide upon your hearts, if your longings be after* him at all times, though not
in the same height and degree, then are your desires right desires? Christ
always dwells in the desires of his people, they can feel him in their desires,
when they cannot discern him in their loves or delights.

Fifthly, Will your desires after Christ admit no satisfaction, nor find rest
any where but in the enjoyment of Christ, then are your desires right desires:
the soul that desires Christ can never be at rest till it come home to Christ,
2 Cor. 5. 2, 6. Phil. 1. 23. The Devil can satisfy others with riches and
pleasures of this world, as Children are quieted with Rattles. If nothing but
Christ can rest and terminate your desires, surely such restless desires are
right desires.

Sixthly, Do your desires after Christ spring from a deep sense of your need
and want of Christ: has conviction opened your eyes to see your misery, to
feel your burdens, and to make you sensible that your remedy lies only in the
Lord Jesus, then are your desires right desires: bread and water are made
necessary and desirable by hunger and thirst. By these things try the truth of
your desires after Christ.

3d Use for Consolation.
Do you indeed upon serious trial find such desires after Use 3.
Christ, as were described above, Oh bless the Lord for that day wherein Christ
the desire of Nations became the desire of your souls, and for your comfort
know that you are happy and blessed souls at present.

First, Blessed in this, that your eyes have been opened to see both the want
and the worth of Christ. Had not Christ applied his precious eye salve to the
eyes of your mind, you could never have desired him, you would have said with
them in Isai. 53. 2, 3. He has no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see
him, there is no beauty that we should desire him: or as they to the Spouse,
Cant. 5. 9. What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved? Oh blessed souls,
enlightened of the Lord; to see those things that are hid from them that perish!

Secondly, You are blessed in this, that your desires after Christ are a sure
evidence that the desire of Christ is toward you: had he not first desired
you, you could never have desired him. We may say of desires as it is said of
love; we desire him because he first desired us: your desires after Christ are
inflamed from the desires of Christ after you.

Thirdly, Blessed in this, that your desires shall surely be satisfied, Mat. 5.
6. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall
be filled: Prove. 10. 24. The desires of the righteous shall be granted. God
never raised such desires as these in the souls of his people to be a torment
to them for ever.

Fourthly, Blessed in this, that God has guided your desires to make the best
choice that ever was made in the world: whilst the desires of others are
hunting after riches, pleasure and honors in the world, toiling themselves
like Children in pursuit of a painted Butterfly, which when they have caught,
does but daub their fingers: God mean while has directed your desires to
Christ, the most excellent object in Heaven or earth. Any good will satisfy
some men, Oh happy soul if none but Christ can satisfy thee, Psalm. 4. 6.

Fifthly, Blessed in this, that there is a work of grace certainly wrought upon
thy soul, and these very desires after Christ are a part thereof.

Sixthly, Blessed in this, that these desires after Christ keep thy soul active
and working after him continually in the ways of duty, Psalm. 27. 4. One thing
have I desired, that will I seek after. Desire will be a continual spring to
diligence and industry in the ways of duty: the desire of the end quickens to
the use of means, Prove. 18. 1. Others may fall asleep and cast off duty, but it
will be hard for you to do so, whose souls burn with desire after Christ.

Seventhly, Blessed in this, that your desires after Christ will make death
much the sweeter and easier to you, Phil. 1. 23. I desire to be dissolved, and
to be with Christ, which is far better. When a Christian was once asked,
whether he were willing to dye? He returned this answer, let him be unwilling
to dye, who is unwilling to go to Christ: and Illius est nolle mori, qui
nolitire ad Christum.
much like it was that of another, vivere renuo, ut Christo vivam, I refuse
this life, to live with Christ.

4th Use for Exhortation.
In the fourth place, let me exhort and persuade all to Use 4.
make Jesus Christ the desire and choice of their souls. And here I fall in
with the main scope and design of the Gospel: and Oh that I could effectually
press home this Exhortation upon your hearts. Let me offer some moving
Considerations to you, and the Lord accompany them to your hearts.

First, Every Creature naturally desires its own preservation, do not you
desire the preservation of your precious and immortal souls? If you do, then
make Christ your desire and choice, without whom they can never be preserved,
Jude verse. 1.

Secondly, don't your souls earnestly desire the bodies they live in? how
tender are they over them, how careful to provide for them? though they pay a
dear rent for those Tenements they live in: and is not union with Christ
infinitely more desirable than the union of soul and body? Oh covet union with
him, then shall your souls be happy, when your bodies drop off from them at
death, 2 Cor. 5. 1, 3. yea, soul and body shall be happy in him, and with him
for evermore.

Thirdly, How do the men of this world desire the enjoyments of it? They pant
after the dust of the earth: they rise early, sit up late, eat the bread of
carefulness; and all this for very vanity. Shall a worldling do more for earth
than you for Heaven? Shall the Creature be so earnestly desired, and Christ
neglected?

Fourthly, What do all your desires in this world benefit you, if you go
Christless? Suppose you had the desire of your hearts in these things, how long
shall you have comfort in them if you miss Christ?

Fifthly, Does Christ desire you, who have nothing lovely or desirable in you?
And have you no desires after Christ, the most lovely, and desirable one in
both worlds? His desires are toward you, Prove. 8. 31. O, make him the desire
and choice of your souls.

Sixthly, How absolutely necessary is Jesus Christ to your souls? Bread and
water, breath and life is not so necessary as Christ is, One thing is
necessary, Luke 10. 42. and that one thing is Christ: if you miss your desires
in other things, you may yet be happy; but if you miss Christ, you are undone
for ever.

Seventhly, How suitable a good is Christ to your souls? Comprizing whatsoever
they want, 1 Cor. 1. 30. Set your hearts where you will, none will be found to
match and suit them as Christ does.

Eighthly, How great are the benefits that will redound to you by Jesus Christ?
In him you shall have a rich inheritance settled upon you: all things shall be
yours when you are Christ's, 1 Cor. 3. 22. and is not such a Christ worth
desiring?

Ninthly, All your well-grounded hopes of glory are built upon your union with
Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 21. If you miss Christ, you must dye without hope; will not
this draw your desires to him?

Tenthly, Suppose you were at the Judgment Seat of God, where you must shortly
stand; and saw the terrors of the Lord in that day; the Sheep divided from the
Goats, the sentences of absolution and condemnation past by the great and awful
Judge, upon the righteous and the wicked; would not Christ be then desirable in
your eyes? As ever you expect to stand with Comfort at that Bar, let Christ be
the desire and choice of your souls now.

5th Use for Direction.
Do these, or any other Considerations put thee upon this Use 5.
enquiry, how shall I get my desires kindled and inflamed toward Christ? Alas,
my heart is cold and dead, not a serious desire stirring in it after Christ: to
such I shall offer the following Directions.

Direction 1.
Redeem some time every day for meditation: get out of the noise and clamor of
the world, Psalm. 4. 4. and seriously bethink your selves how the present state
of your soul stands, and how it is like to go with you for ever: here all sound
Conversion begins, Psalm. 119. 59.

Direction 2.
Consider seriously of that lamentable state in which you came into the world:
children of wrath by nature, under the curse and condemnation of the Law. So
that either your state must be changed, or you inevitably damned, Joh. 3. 3.

Direction 3.
Consider the way and course you have taken, since you came into the world;
proceeding from iniquity to iniquity. What Command of God have you not violated
a thousand times over? What sin is committed in the world, that you are not one
way or other guilty of before God? How many secret sins are upon your score,
unknown to the most intimate Friend you have in the world? Either this guilt
must be separated from your souls, or your souls from God to all eternity.

Direction 4.
Think upon the severe wrath of God due to every sin, The wages of sin is
death, Romans 6. ult. and how intolerable the fullness of that wrath must be when
a few drops sprinkled upon the Conscience in this world is so insupportable,
that it has made some to choose strangling rather than life: and yet this
wrath must abide for ever upon you, if you get not interest in Jesus Christ,
Joh. 3. 63.

Direction 5.
Ponder well the happy state and condition they are in, who have obtained
pardon and peace by Jesus Christ, Psalm. 32. 12. And seeing the grace of God is
free, and you are yet under the means thereof, why may not you be as capable
thereof as others?

Direction 6.
Seriously consider the great uncertainty of your time, and preciousness of the
opportunities of salvation, never to be recovered when they are once past, Joh.
9. 4. Let this provoke you to lay hold upon those golden seasons, whilst they
are yet with you; that you may not bewail your folly and madness when they are
out of your reach.

Direction 7.
Associate your selves with serious Christians, get into their acquaintance,
and beg their assistance; beseech them to pray for you: and see that you rest
not here, but be frequently upon your knees begging of the Lord a new heart,
and a new state.

In Conclusion of the whole, let me beseech and beg all the people of God, as
upon my knees, to take heed and beware lest by the carelessness, and scandals of
their lives, they quench the weak desires beginning to kindle in the hearts of
others. You know what the Law of God awards for striking a woman with Child, so
that her fruit go from her, Exodus 21. 22, 23. Oh shed not soul blood by
stifling the hopeful desires of any after Christ.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ the desire of all Nations.
The Fourteenth SERMON. Sermon 14.

1 COR. 2. 8. Text. Containing the fifth Motive to apply Christ, drawn from
another excellent Title of Christ.
Which none of the Princes of this world have known, for had they known him,
they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory.
IN this Chapter the Apostle discourses to the Corinthians the excellency of
his Ministry, both to obviate the contempt which some might cast upon it for
want of humane Ornaments; and to give the greater authority unto it among all:
and whereas the spiritual simplicity of his Ministry laid it under the contempt
of some, he removes that several ways, by showing them,

First, That it was not suitable to the design, and end of his ministry, his
aim being to know nothing among them, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified,
verse. 1, 2.

Secondly, Neither was it for the advantage of their souls: it might indeed
tickle their fancies, but could be no solid foundation to their faith and
comfort, verse. 4, 5.

Thirdly, Though his discourses seemed jejune, and dry to carnal hearers, yet
it had a depth, and an excellency in it, which spiritual and judicious
Christians saw and acknowledged, verse. 6, 7.

Fourthly, Therefore this excellent wisdom which he preached, far transcended
all the natural wisdom of this world: yea, the most raised and improved
understandings of those that were most renowned, and admired in that age for
wisdom, verse. 8. Which none of the Princes of this world knew.

In which words we have, 1. A Negative Proposition. 2. The proof of the
Proposition.


First, A Negative Proposition, none of the Princes of this 1.
world knew that Spiritual Wisdom which he taught. By Princes of this world, or
rather principes seculi, the Princes of that age, he means, as Camero well
notes, the learned Rabbis, Scribes and Pharisees, renowned for wisdom and
learning among them, and honored upon that account, as so many Princes: but he
adds a diminutive term, which darkens all their glory. They are but the Princes
of this world, utterly unacquainted with the wisdom of the other world. To
which he adds,

Secondly, A clear and full proof, for had they known it, 2.
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. In which words we find one of
Christ's glorious and royal Titles, the Lord of glory: upon which Title my
present Discourse must fall. The words being fitly rendered, and nothing of
ambiguity in them, they give us this observation.

DOCT.
That Christ Crucified is the Lord of Glory. Doct.


Great and excellent is the glory of Jesus Christ; the Scriptures every where
proclaim his glory. Yea, we may observe a notable Climax, or gradation in those
Scriptures that speak of his glory. The Prophet Isaiah speaking of him, calls
him glorious, Isai. 4. 2. In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful
and glorious. John speaking of his glory rises a step higher, and ascribes to
him a glory as of the only begotton Son of the Father, John 1. 14. (i. e.) a
glory meet for, and becoming the Son of God: proper to him and incommunicable
to any other. The Apostle James rises yet higher, and does not only call him
glorious, or glorious as the only begotten of the Father: but the glory, Jam.
2. 1. glory in the abstract; my brethren (says he) have not the faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the glory, with respect of persons: for the word Lord, which
is in our translation, is a supplement: Christ is glory it self: yea, the glory
emphatically so styled; the glory of Heaven; the glory of Sion; the glory of
our souls for ever. The Author to the Hebrews goes yet higher, and calls him
not simply the glory, but the brightness of his Fathers glory, Heb. 1. 3. as
who should (...).
say, the radiancy, sparkling, or beaming forth of his Fathers glory, the very
splendour, or refulgency of divine glory. Oh what a glorious Lord is our Lord
Jesus Christ! the bright sparkling Diamond of Heaven: who shines in glory
there, above the glory of Angels and Saints, as the glory of the Sun excels the
lesser twinkling Stars. When he appeared to Paul in Acts 26. 13. I saw, said
he, a light from Heaven, above the brightness of the Sun, shining round about
me: needs must the glory of Christ be unspeakable, who reflects glory upon all
that be with him, John 17. 24. and stamps glory upon all that belongs to him.
His works on earth were glorious works, Luke 13. 17. The purchased liberty of
his people, a glorious liberty, Romans 8. 21. The Church his mystical body, a
glorious Church, Ephesians. 5. 27. The Gospel which reveals him, is a glorious
Gospel, 1 Timothy 1. 11.

But more particularly, let us consider the glory of Christ, as it is
distinguished into his either, 1. Essential Glory. 2. Mediatorial

First, The Essential Glory of Christ which he has as God 1.
from everlasting; which is unspeakable and unconceivable glory: for (says the
Apostle) Phil. 2. 6. He being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be
equal with God (i. e.) he had a Peerage, or equality with his Father in glory,
Joh. 10. 30. I and my Father are one: and again, Joh. 16. 15. All things that
the Father has, are mine: the same name, the same nature, the same essential
properties, the same will, and the same glory.

Secondly, The Mediatorial glory of Christ is exceeding 2.
great: this is proper to him, as head of the Church, which he has purchased
with his own blood. Of this glory the Apostle speaks, Phil. 2. 9, 10. Wherefore
God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every
name, etc. (...) exalted above all exaltation. Now the mediatorial glory of our
Lord Jesus Christ consists either, 1. In the fullness of Grace inherent in
him. 2. Or in the Dignity and Authority put upon him.


First, In the fullness of grace inherent in him: the humanity of Christ is
filled with grace, as the Sun with light, Joh. 1. 14. Full of grace and truth:
never any creature was so filled by the Spirit of Grace, as the man Christ
Jesus is filled, for God gives not the spirit to him by measure, Joh. 3. 34. By
reason of this fullness of grace inherent in him, he is sairer than the Children
of men, Psalm. 45. 2. Excelling all the Saints in spiritual luster, and gracious
excellencies.

Secondly, In the Dignity and Authority put upon him* he is crowned King in
Sion: all power in Heaven and earth is given unto him, Mat. 28. 18. he is
Lawgiver to the Church, James 4. 12. All acts of worship are to be performed in
his name, Prayer, Preaching, Censures, Sacraments, all to be administered in his
name. Church Officers are Commissioned by him, Ephesians. 4. 11. The Judgment of the
world in the great day will be administered by him, Mat. 25. 31. Then shall he
sit upon the Throne of his Glory.

To conclude, Jesus Christ shall have glory and honor ascribed to him for
evermore by Angels and Saints, upon the account of his Mediatorial work. This
some Divines call his passive glory; the glory which he is to receive from his
redeemed ones, Rev. 5. 8, 9, 10. And when he had taken the Book, the four
Beasts, and the four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every
one of them Harps, and golden Vials full of Odours, which are the prayers of
the Saints; and they sung a new Song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the Book,
and to open the Seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and have redeemed us to God
by thy blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, etc.
And thus you see, that our Lord Jesus Christ is upon all accounts the Lord of
Glory. The Uses follow.

Inference 1.
How wonderful was the love of Christ the Lord of glory, to be so abased and
humbled as he was for us, vile, and sinful Inference 1.
dust! It Is astonishing to conceive that ever Jesus Christ should strip himself
out of his Robes of Glory, to cloth himself with the threadbare tatters of
our flesh. Oh what a stoop did he make in his incarnation for us! If the most
magnificent Monarch upon earth, had been degraded into a Toad: if the Sun in
the Heavens had been turned into a wandering Atom: if the most glorious Angel in
Heaven, had been transformed into a silly Fly; it had been nothing to the
abasement of the Lord of Glory. This act is every where celebrated in
Scripture, as the great mystery, the astonishing wonder of the whole world, 2 Timothy 3. 16. Phil. 2. 8. Romans 8. 3. The Lord of glory looked not like himself,
when he came in the habit of a man, Isai. 53. 3. We hid as it were our faces
from him: nay, rather like a worm, than a man, Psalm. 22. 6. A reproach of men,
and despised of the people. The Birds of the air, and Beasts of the earth were
here provided of better accommodations than the Lord of glory, Mat. 8. 20. Oh
stupendous abasement! Oh love unspeakable! Though he was rich, yet for our
sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich, 2 Cor. 8. 9.
He put off the Crown of Glory, to put on the Crown of Thorns: quanto pro me
vilior, tanto mihi charior, said Bernard, the lower he humbled himself for me,
the dearer he shall be to me.

Inference 2.
How transcendently glorious is the advancement of Believers by their union
with the Lord of Glory! This also is an admirable, Inference 2.
and astonishing mystery; it is the highest dignity of which our nature is
capable, to be hypostatically united, and the greatest glory of which our
persons are capable to be mystically united to this Lord of Glory; to be bone
of his bone, and flesh of his flesh. O what is this! Christian do thou know,
and believe all this, and thy heart not burn within thee in love to Christ? O
then what a heart have thou? What art thou by nature, but sinful dust, a
loathsome sinner, viler than the vilest Toad, cast out to the loathing of thy
person in the day of thy nativity! O that ever the Lord of Glory should unite
himself to such a lump of vileness! take such a wretch into his very bosom! Be
astonished O Heavens and earth at this; this is the great mystery which the
Angels stoopt down to look into. Such an honor as this could never have entered
into the heart of man: it would have seemed a rude blasphemy in us once to have
thought, or spoken of such a thing, had not Christ made the first motion
thereof. Yet how long did thou make this Lord of Glory wait upon thy
undetermined will, before he gained thy consent? Might he not justly have
spurned thee into Hell upon thy first refusal, and never have made thee such
another offer? Will thou not say, Lord, what am I, and what is my Fathers
house, that so great a King should stoop so far beneath himself to such a worm
as I am! That strength should unite it self to weakness, infinite glory to such
baseness! O grace, grace, for ever to be admired!

Inference 3.
Is Jesus Christ the Lord of Glory, then let no man count Inference 3.
himself dishonored by suffering the vilest indignities for his sake: the Lord
of Glory puts glory upon the very sufferings you undergo in this world for him.
Moses esteemed the reproaches of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
Egypt, Heb. 11. 26. He cast a Kingdom at his heels, to be crowned with
reproaches for the name of Christ. The Diadem of Egypt was not half so
glorious, as self-denial for Christ. This Lord of Glory freely degraded himself
for thee, will thou stand huckling with him upon terms? It Is certainly your
honor to be dishonored for Christ, Act. 5. 41. To you it is given in behalf
of Christ, not only to believe, but also to suffer for his sake, Phil. 1. 29.
The gift of suffering is there matched with the gift of faith: it is given as an
honorarium, a badge of Honor to suffer for the Lord of Glory: as all have not
the honor to wear the Crown of Glory in Heaven; so few have the honor to wear
the chain of Christ upon earth. Thuanus Cur me non quoque torque donas, and
insi nis hujus ordinis mili em creas? Thuanus.
reports of Lodovicus Marsacus, a Knight of France, that being led to suffer
with other Martyrs who were bound, and he unbound, because a person of Honor;
he cried out, Why don't you honor me with a Chain too, and create me a Knight
of that Noble Order? My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse
temptations, Jam. 1. 2. (i. e.) trials by sufferings. David thought it an
honor to be vile for God, and that is a true observation, that disgrace it self
is glorious, when endured for the Lord of Glory.

Inference 4.
Is Christ the Lord of Glory, How glorious then shall the Saints one day be,
when they shall be made like this glorious Inference 4.
Lord, and partake of his glory in Heaven, John 17. 22. the glory which thou
gave me, I have given them: yea, the vile bodies of Believers, shall be made
like to the glorious body of Christ, Phil. 3. 21. What glory then will be
communicated to their souls? True, his essential glory is incommunicable; but
there is a glory, which Christ will communicate to his people, When he comes to
judge the world, he will come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired
in all them that believe, 2 These. 1. 10. Where he seems to account his social
glory, which shall result from his Saints, a great part of his own glory: as we
have now fellowship with him in his sufferings, so we shall have a fellowship
or communion with him in his glory: when he shall appear, then shall we also
appear with him in glory: then the poorest Believer shall be more glorious than
Solomon in all his Royalty. It was a pious saying of Luther, that he had rather
be Christianus Rusticus, quam Ethnicus Alexander, a Christian Clown, than a
Pagan Emperor; the righteous is more excellent than his neighbor: though he
live next door to a graceless Nobleman: but it does not yet appear what they
shall be. The day will come, it will certainly come, for the Lord has spoken
it, when they shall shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father.

Inference 5.
How has the Devil blindfolded, and deluded them, that are scared off from
Christ by the fears of being dishonored by him? Inference 5.
Many persons have half a mind to Religion, but when they consider the
generality of its professors to be persons of the lowest and meanest rank in
the world, and that reproaches and sufferings attend that way; they shrink back
as men ashamed, and as Salvian says, mali esse coguntur, ne viles habeantur,
they choose rather to remain wicked, than to become vile: but to them that
believe, Christ is an honor: as the word which we translate precious might be
rendered, 1 Pet. 2. 7. Till God open men's eyes thus, they will put evil for
good, and good for evil. But O dear bought honors for which men stake their
souls, and everlasting happiness! Paul was not of your mind, yet for birth he
was an Hebrew of the Hebrews, for dignity and esteem, a Pharisee for moral
accomplishments, touching the Law blameless: yet all this he trampled under his
feet, counting it all but dross and dung in comparison of Jesus Christ. Moses
had more honor to lay down for Christ than you, yet it was no temptation to
him to conceal or deny the faith of Christ. Noble Galeacius would not be
withheld from Christ by the splendour and glory of Italy. But Oh how does the
glory of this world dazzle and blind the eyes of many! How can ye believe (says
Christ) who receive honor one of another, John 5. 44. Saints and sinners upon
this account are wonders to one the other. It Is the wonder of the world to see
Christians glorying in reproaches, they wonder that the Saints run not with
them into the same excess of riot. And it is a wonder to Believers how such
poor toys and empty titles (rather than titles of honor) should keep the world
as it does from Jesus Christ, and their everlasting happiness in him.

Inference 6.
If Christ be the Lord of Glory, how careful should all be Inference 6.
who profess him, that they do not dishonor Jesus Christ, whose name is called
upon them? Christ is a glory to you, be not you a shame and dishonor to him.
How careful had Christians need be to draw every line and action of their lives
exactly. The more glorious Christ is, the more circumspect and watchful ye had
need to be. How lovely would Jesus Christ appear to the world, if the lives of
Christians did adorn the Doctrine of God their Savior in all things! Remember
you represent the Lord of Glory to the world: it is not your honor only, but
the honor of Christ which is engaged, and concerned in your actions. O let not
the carelessness, or scandals of your life make Jesus Christ ashamed to be
called your Lord. When Israel had grievously revolted from God, he bids Moses
rise, and get him down from thence, for (says he) thy people which thou have
brought forth out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves, Deuteronomy. 9. 12. as if the
Lord were ashamed to own them for his people any longer. It was a cutting
question, Jam. 2. 7. apt to startle the Consciences of those loose professors;
do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called? Your duty is to
adorn the Gospel by your Conversations, Titus 2. 10. The words signify to
deck, trim, or adorn the Gospel, to make it neat, trim, and lovely to the eyes
of beholders. When there is such a beautiful harmony, and lovely proportion
betwixt Christ's Doctrine, and your practices, as there is in the works of
Creation: wherein the comeliness and elegancy of the world much consists (for to
this the Apostles word here alludes) then do we walk suitably to the Lord of
Glory.

Inference 7.
What delight should Christians take in their daily converse with Jesus Christ
in the way of duty? Your converses in prayer, hearing, Inference 7. Suppose
(says Mr. Rutherford) there were no letter of a command, yet there is a
suitableness betwixt the Law engraven on the heart, and the spiritual matter
commanded -- there is an Heaven in the bosom of prayer, though there were not a
granting of the suit. Rutherfords Treatise of the Covenant, p. 71.
and meditation are with the Lord of Glory: the greatest Peers in a Kingdom,
account it more honor to be in the presence of a King bareheaded, or upon the
knee at Court, than to have thousands standing bare to them in the Country.
When you are called to duties of communion with Christ, you are called to the
greatest honor, dignified with the noblest privilege creatures are capable of
in this world: had you but a sense of that honor God puts upon you by this
means, you would not need so much tugging and striving to bring a dead and
backward heart into the special presence of Jesus Christ. When he says, seek
ye my face, your hearts would echo to his calls, thy face, Lord, will we seek:
But alas, the glory of Christ is much hid and veiled by ignorance and unbelief
from the eyes of his own people; it is but seldom the best of Saints, by the eye
of faith, do see the King in his Glory.

Inference 8.
If Christ be so glorious, how should Believers long to be with Inference 8.
him, and behold him in his glory above? Most men need patience to dye, a
Believer should need patience to live. Paul thought it well worth enduring the
pangs of death, to get a sight of Jesus Christ in his glory, Phil. 1. 23. The
Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and patient waiting for of
Christ, (says the Apostle) 2 These. 3. 5. intimating that the Saints have great
need of patience to enable them to endure the state of distance and separation
from Christ, so long as they must endure it in this world. The Spirit and the
Bride say come, and let him that hears say come, and let him that is a thirst
come, even so come Lord Jesus, and be thou as a swift Roe upon the Mountains of
Separation.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory.
The Fifteenth SERMON. Sermon 15.

LUKE 2. 25. Text. Opening the sixth Motive to come to Christ, contained in the
sixth and last Titile of Christ.
-- Waiting for the [Consolation] of Israel.
SEveral Glorious Titles of Christ have been already spoken to, out of each of
which, much comfort flows to Believers: it is comfortable to a wounded soul to
eye him as a Physician: comfortable to a condemned and unworthy soul, to look
upon him under the notion of the Mercy. The loveliness, the desirableness, and
the glory of Christ are all so many springs of Consolation. But now I am to
show you from this Scripture, that the Saints have not only much consolation
from Christ, but that Christ himself is the very Consolation of Believers: he
is pure comfort wrapped up in flesh and blood.

In this Context you have an account of Simeons Prophecy concerning Christ;
and in this Text, a description of the Person, and quality of Simeon himself,
who is described two ways.

1. By his Practice. 2. By his Principle.
His practice was heavenly and holy, he was a just and devout man: the
principle from which his righteousness and holiness did flow, was his faith in
Christ; he waited for the consolation of Israel. In which words by way of
Periphrasis we have,

1. A description of Christ, the Consolation of Israel. 2. The description of a
Believer, one that waits for Christ.
First. That the Consolation of Israel is a phrase descriptive 1.
of Jesus Christ is beyond all doubt, if you consult verse. 26. where he (i. e.)
Simeon is satisfied by receiving Christ into his arms, the Consolation for
which he had so long waited.

Secondly, And that waiting for Christ is a phrase describing 2. Phrasis est
Judaeistum temporis familiaris and notissima, qua Messiae adventum
significabatur. Lodov. Capell.
the Believers of those times, that preceeded the incarnation of Christ, is
past doubt; they all waited for that blessed day: but it was Simeons lot to
fall just upon that happy nick of time, wherein the Prophecies and Promises of
his incarnation were fulfilled. Simeon and others that waited with him, were
sensible that the time of the Promise was come, which could not but raise (as
indeed it did) a general expectation of him, John 9. 19. but Simeons faith was
confirmed by a particular revelation, verse. 26. that he should see Christ
before he saw death, which could not but greatly encourage and raise his
expectation to look out for him, whose coming would be the greatest consolation
to the whole Israel of God. The Consolation. (...). The Spirit is frequently
called in Scripture, (...) the Comforter; but Christ in this place is called
(...) comfort or consolation it self; the reason of both is given in John 16.
14. He shall take of mine and show it unto you: where Christ is said to be the
matter, and the Spirit, the applier of true comfort to the people of God. Now
this consolation is here expressed both with a singular Emphasis [the
Consolation] intimating, that there is nothing of consolation in any thing
beside him: all other comforts compared with this, are not worth a naming. And
as it is emphatically expressed, so it is also limited and bounded within the
compass of Gods Israel (i. e.) true Believers styled the Israel of God, whether
Jews or Gentiles, Gal. 6. 16. From whence the point of Doctrine is,

DOCT.
That Jesus Christ is the only Consolation of Believers, and of none besides
them. Doct.


So speaks the Apostle, Phil. 3. 3. For we are the circumcision, which worship
God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
flesh. Those that worship God in the Spirit are sincere Believers, to such
sincere Believers Christ is consolation, our rejoicing is in Christ Jesus: and
they have no consolation in any thing beside him, nothing in the world can give
them comfort without Christ, we have no confidence in the flesh. The Gospel is
glad tidings of great joy, but that which makes it to be so, is Jesus Christ
whom it imports and reveals to us, Luke 2. 10, 11. In the opening of this
comfortable point, four things must be spoken to, for the right stating the
method of our Discourse, viz.

1. What is meant by Consolation. 2. That Christ, and he only is Consolation to
Believers. 3. That Believers only have Consolation in Christ. 4. How it comes
to pass, that any Believer should be dejected; since Christ is Consolation to
all Believers.
The first thing to be opened, is the nature of Consolation, 1.
which is nothing else but the cheariness of a man's spirit whereby he is
upheld, and fortified against all evils felt, or feared. Consolation is to the
soul, what health is to the body after wasting sickness, or the reviving Spring
to the earth, after a long and hard Winter: and there are three sorts of
consolation, or comfort suitable to the disposition and temper of the mind, viz.

Natural, Sinful and Spiritual.
Natural Comfort is the refreshment of our natural Spirits by the good
Creatures of God, Acts. 14. 17. Filling their hearts with food and gladness.
Sinful Comfort is the satisfaction and pleasure men take in the fulfilling* of
their lusts, by the abuse of the creatures of God, James 5. 5. Ye have lived in
pleasure upon earth, (i. e.) your life has been a life of sensuality and sin.

Spiritual Comfort is the refreshment, peace and joy gracious souls have in
Christ, by the exercise of faith, hope, and other graces, Romans 5. 2. and this
only deserves the name of true solid Consolation: to which four things are
required.

First, That the matter thereof be some spiritual, eminent and durable good:
else our consolation in it, will be but as the crackling of Thorns under a Pot;
a sudden blaze, quickly extinct with the failing matter: Christ only gives the
matter of solid, durable Consolation: The righteousness of Christ, the pardon
of sin, the favor of God, the hopes of glory, are the substantial materials of
a Believers Consolation, Romans 5. 2. Mat. 9. 2. Psalm. 4. 6, 7. 2 Pet. 1. 8.
Things are as their foundations be.

Secondly, Interest and propriety in these comfortable things, is requisite to
our consolation by them, Luke 1. 47. My Spirit rejoices in God my Savior.
It Is no consolation to him that is hungry, to see a Feast; to him that is poor,
to see a Treasure; if the one may not taste, or the other partake thereof.

Thirdly, Knowledge, and evidence of interest in some degree is requisite to
actual consolation, though without it a man may be in the state of consolation:
for that which appears not, is (in point of actual comfort) as if it were not.

Fourthly, In order hereunto the work of the Spirit upon our hearts is
requisite, both to give, and clear our interest in Christ, and the promises:
and both these ways he is the Comforter, The fruit of the Spirit is joy, Gal.
5. 22. And thus briefly of the nature of Consolation.

Secondly, Next I will show you that Christ, and he only 2.
is matter of Consolation to Believers: which will demonstratively appear by
this Argument.

He that brings to their souls all that is comfortable, and removes from their
souls all that is uncomfortable, must Argu.
needs be the only consolation of Believers.

But Jesus Christ brings to their souls all that is comfortable, and removes
from their souls all that is uncomfortable.

Therefore Christ only is the Consolation of Believers.

First, Jesus Christ brings whatsoever is comfortable to the souls of
Believers. Is pardon comfortable to a person condemned? Nothing can be matter
of greater comfort in this world. Why, this Christ brings to all Believers,
Jer. 23. 6. And this is the name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our
righteousness: this cannot but give strong consolation; righteousness is the
foundation of peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, Romans 14. 17. The work of
righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness, and
assurance for ever; Isai. 32. 17. Come to a dejected soul, laboring under the
burden of guilt, and say, Cheer up, I bring you good tidings; there is such an
Estate befallen you, or such a troublesome business comfortably ended for you;
alas! this will not reach the heart. If you can bring me (says he) good news
from Heaven, that my sins are forgiven, and God reconciled; how soon should I
be comforted! And therefore (as one well observes) this was the usual receipt
with which Christ cured the souls of men and women, when he was here on earth;
Son, or Daughter, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee: and indeed it is
as easy to separate light and warmth from the beams of the Sun, as cheeriness
and comfort from the voice of pardon.

Are the hopes and expectation of Heaven and glory comfortable? Yes sure,
nothing is comfortable if this be not, Romans 5. 2. We rejoice in hope of the
glory of God. Now, Christ brings to the souls of men all the solid grounds and
foundations upon which they build their expectations of glory, Col. 1. 27.
Which is Christ, in you, the hope of glory. Name any thing else that is solid
matter of comfort to the souls of men, and the grounds thereof will be found in
Christ, and in none but Christ; as might easily be demonstrated by the
enumeration of multitudes of particular instances, which I cannot now insist
upon.

Secondly, Jesus Christ removes fom Believers, whatever is uncomfortable;
therein relieving them against all the matters of their affliction and sorrow.
As namely,

First, Is sin a burden, and matter of trouble to Believers? Christ, and none
but Christ removes that burden, Romans 7. 24, 25. O wretched man that I am,
(says sin burdened Paul) who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I
thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. The satisfaction of his blood, Ephesians. 5.
2. The sanctification of his Spirit, John 1. 5, 6. His perfect deliverance of
his people from the very being of sin at last, Ephesians. 5. 26, 27. This relieves at
present, and removes at last the matter and ground of all their troubles and
sorrows for sin.

Secondly, Do the temptations of Satan burden Believers? O yes, by reason of
temptations, they go in trouble, and heaviness of spirit. Temptation is an
enemy under the walls, temptation greatly endangers, and therefore cannot but
greatly afflict the souls of Believers; but Christ brings the only matter of
relief against temptations. The intercession of Christ is a singular relief at
present, Luke 22. 32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
the promises of Christ are a full relief for the future: The God of peace shall
shortly tread Satan under your feet, Romans 16. 20.

Thirdly, Is spiritual desertion, and the hiding of Gods face, matter of
affliction, and casting down to Believers? Yes, yes, it quails their hearts,
nothing can comfort them; Thou hidest thy face, and I was troubled, Psalm. 30.
7. Outward afflictions do but break the skin, this touches the quick: they like
rain fall only upon the Tiles, this soaks into the House; but Christ brings to
Believers substantial matter of Consolation against the troubles of desertion:
he himself was deserted of God for a time, that they might not be deserted for
ever: in him also the relieving promises are made to Believers, that
notwithstanding God may desert them for a time, yet the union betwixt him and
them shall never be dissolved, Heb. 13. 5. Jer. 32. 40. Though he forsake them
for a moment, in respect of evidenced favor, yet he will return again and
comfort them, Isai. 54. 7. Though Satan tug hard, yet he shall never be able to
pluck them out of his Fathers hand, John 10. 20. Oh what relief is this! What
consolation is Christ to a deserted Believer!

Fourthly, Are outward afflictions matter of dejection, and trouble? Alas, who
finds them not to be so? How do our hearts fail, and our spirits sink under the
many smarting rods of God upon us! but our relief and consolation under them
all, is in Christ Jesus: for the rod that afflicts us is in the hand of Christ
that loves us, Rev. 3. 19. Whom I love I rebuke and chasten: his design in
affliction is our profit, Heb. 12. 10. That design of his for our good shall
certainly be accomplished, Romans 8. 28. and after that no more afflictions for
ever, Rev. 21. 3, 4. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. So that
upon the whole, two things are most evident.

First, Nothing can comfort the soul without Christ: he is the soul that
animates all Comforts, they would be but dead things without him. Temporal
enjoyments, riches, honors, health, relations, yield not a drop of true
Comfort without Christ. Spiritual enjoyments, Minister, ordinances, promises,
are fountains sealed, and springs shut up till Christ open them, a man may go
comfortless in the midst of them all.

Secondly, No troubles, sorrows, or afflictions can deject, or sink the soul
that Christ comfort, 2 Cor. 6. 10. As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. A
Believer may walk with a heart brim full of comfort, amidst all the troubles of
this world. Christ makes the darkness of trouble, to be light round about his
people. So that the conclusion stands firm, and never to be shaken; that
Christ, and Christ only is the Consolation of Believers: which was the thing to
be proved.

In the Third place, I am to show you, that Believers, and 3.
none but Believers can have consolation in Christ: which will convincingly
appear from the consideration of those things which we laid down before, as the
requisites to all true Spiritual Coonsolation. For,

First, No unbeliever has the materials out of which Spiritual Comfort is
made; which (as I there told you) must be some solid, spiritual and eternal
good, as Christ and the Covenant are. What do unregenerate men rejoice in, but
trifles and mere vanities, in a thing of naught? Amos 6. 13. See how their
mirth is described in Job 21. 12. They take their Timbrel and Harp, and rejoice
at the sound of the Organ. He does not say, they take the Bible, turn to the
promises, and rejoice in Christ and the Covenant; it is not the melody of a good
Conscience, the joy of the Holy Ghost: no, no, they have no acquaintance with
such music as that: but the rejoicing of Believers is in those things, 2 Cor.
1. 12. And this is well built consolation which reaches the heart.

Secondly, I told you that propriety, and interest in Christ, and the promises
is required to all Spiritual Consolation: but no unbeliever has any title or
interest in Christ, and the promises, and so they can signify nothing to him
in point of Comfort. It Is not another man's money, but my own, that must feed,
cloth and comfort me; nor is it another man's Christ, but my own Christ, that
must justify, save and comfort my soul.

Thirdly, You were told that evidence of a man's peace, and reconciliation with
God, is necessary to his actual consolation, which no unbeliever can possibly
have; he has neither grace within him, to make him a qualified subject of any
special promise; nor any witness, or seal of the spirit to confirm and clear
his propriety in Christ: for he never seals, but where he first sanctifies. So
that it is beyond all contradiction, that Believers, and none but Believers are
partakers of the Consolations that are in Christ Jesus.

Fourthly, and Lastly, There is one inquiry remains to be satisfied, namely,
seeing Jesus Christ is consolation to Believers, how it comes to pass that so
many Believers in the world should walk so dejectedly as they do without any
Spiritual Consolation.

First, This may not be wondered at, if we consider that the Consolations of
Christ are of two sorts. Seminal and in preparation, or actual in present
possession. Every Believer in the world has the root, and seed of comfort,
planted and sown for him, Psalm. 97. 11. Light is sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart. They have Christ and the promises which are
the seeds of Consolation, and will bring forth joy at last, though at present
they have no actual Consolation; the seed of all joy is sown, and in due time
they shall reap the full ripe fruit thereof.

Secondly, It must be remembered that interest and evidence are distinct
blessings, every Believer has interest in Christ, but every Believer has not
the evidence thereof, Isai. 50. 10. Who is among you that fears the Lord, and
obeys the voice of his Servant, that walks in darkness and has no light.
Every Child of God is not of sufficient age to know his Father, or take comfort
in that blessed inheritance whereunto he is begotten again, 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4.

Thirdly, Every Believer does not walk with like strictness, and exact
holiness, all do not exercise faith in a like degree: among Christians some are
strong in grace, rich in faith, strict in obedience, tender of sin to an
eminent degree, these usually are owners of much Consolation: but others are
weak in grace, poor in faith, comparatively careless of their hearts and ways;
frequently grieving the good Spirit of God, and wounding their own Consciences
(the vessel into which Spiritual Consolation is poured) and these are usually
denied the joy and comfort which others abound withal.

Fourthly, The Consolations of Christ are arbitrarily dispensed by the Spirit
who is the Comforter, and gives to every man in such proportions and seasons
as pleases him; whence it comes to pass, that he that is rich in comfort to
day, may be poor to morrow, and contrarily the heart that is brimful of sorrow
one hour, is filled with peace and joy in believing the next. Things that are
necessary to the being of a Christian are fixed and stable, but things
belonging only to the well-being of a Christian come and go according to the
good pleasure and appointment of the Spirit. The use of all follows.

Inference 1.
Hence it follows, that the state of unbelievers is the most sad and
uncomfortable state in the world: having no interest in Christ Inference 1.
the Consolation of Israel. It Is true, they abound in Creaturecomforts, they
live in pleasure upon earth. Joy displaies its colors in their faces: but for
all this there is not the least drop of true Consolation in any of their
hearts: they have some comfort in the Creature, but none in Christ: that little
they gather from the Creature now, is all their portion of joy, Luke 6. 24. Ye
have received your consolation: as this is all they have, so they shall enjoy
it but a little while, Job 21. 13, 17. and while they do enjoy it, it is mixed
with many gripes of Conscience, Job 14. 13. Even in laughter the heart is
sorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heaviness: whatever consolation any
unbeliever speaks of besides this, is but by rote; for when the day of his
distress comes, and the terrors of Conscience shall awake him out of his
pleasant dreams, all his sensual joys will vanish from him, and the doors of
true Consolation will be all shut against him. Let him go to Jesus Christ,
knock at that door, and say, Lord Jesus thy name is Consolation, my heart is
ready to burst within me, have thou no Consolation for me? O Lord for one drop
of Spiritual Comfort now, but alas there is none, no not in Christ himself for
any unbeliever. It Is Childrens bread; the Saints privilege; comfort and grace
are undivided: let him return into himself, search his own Conscience for
comfort, and say, O Conscience, thou art more than a thousand witnesses, and
thousands have been comforted by thee: where thou speak comfort, none can
speak trouble, have thou no Consolation for me in my deepest distress? Alas,
no, if God condemn thee, wherewithal shall I comfort thee? I can speak neither
more nor less than the Scriptures put into my mouth, and I find not one word in
all the Book of God warranting me to be thy Comforter: believe it as an
undoubted truth, (though the sense of the bewitched world overrules it) that
the state of unbelievers, even at the best, is a sad and dismal state.

Inference 2.
Let all Believers fetch all their Comfort out of Christ, who is Inference 2.
the Consolation of his people: we rejoice (says the Apostle) in Christ Jesus,
and have no confidence in the flesh. That Is the true temper of a believing
soul: Take heed you live not partly upon Christ, and partly upon the Creature
for your Comfort; much rather beware that you forsake not Christ the fountain
of living waters, and hew out Cisterns for your selves which can hold no water,
Jer. 2. 13. If you make any Creature the spring and fountain of your comfort,
assuredly God will dry up that spring: if your souls draw their Comfort from
any Creature, you know they must outlive that Creature, and what then will you
do for Comfort? Beside, as your Comforts are, so are you. The food of every
Creature is suitable to its nature. You see diverse Creatures feeding upon
several parts of the same herb; the Be upon the flower, the Bird upon the
seed, the Sheep upon the stalk, and the Swine upon the root; according to their
nature, so is their food: sensual men feed upon sensual things: spiritual men
upon spiritual things; as your food is, so are you. If carnal comforts can
content thy heart, sure thy heart must then be a very carnal heart: yea, and
let Christians themselves take heed, that they fetch not their Consolations out
of themselves instead of Christ. Your graces and duties are excellent means and
instruments, but not the groundwork, and foundation of your Comfort: they are
useful buckets to draw, but not the well it self in which the springs of
consolation rise. If you put your duties in the room of Christ, Christ will put
your comforts out of the reach of your duties.

Inference 3.
If Christ be the Consolation of Believers, what a comfortable Inference 3.
life should all Believers live in this world? Certainly if the fault be not
your own, you might live the happiest and comfortablest lives of all men in the
world. If you would not be a discomfort to Christ, he would be a comfort to you
every day, and in every condition to the end of your lives: your condition
abounds with all the helps and advantages of consolation: you have the command
of Christ to warrant your comforts, Phil. 4. 4. You have the Spirit of Christ
for a spring of comfort, you have the Scriptures of Christ for the rules of
comfort: you have the duties of Religion for the means of comfort: why is it
then that you go comfortless? If your afflictions be many in the world, yet
your encouragements be more in Christ: your troubles in the world may be turned
into joy, but your comforts in Christ can never be turned into trouble. Why
should troubles obstruct your comfort, when the blessing of Christ upon your
troubles makes them subservient to promote your happiness? Romans 8. 28. Shake
off despondency then, and live up to the principles of Religion: your dejected
life is uncomfortable to your selves, and of very ill use to others.

Inference 4.
If Christ be the Consolation of Believers, then let all that desire Inference
4.
comfort in this world, or in that to come, embrace Jesus Christ, and get real
union with him. The same hour you shall be in Christ, you shall also be at the
fountain head of all Consolations. Thy soul shall be then a pardoned soul, and
a pardoned soul has all reason in the world to be a joyful soul: in that day
thy Conscience shall be sprinkled with the blood of Christ, and a sprinkled
Conscience has all the reason in the world to be a comforting Conscience: in
that day you become the Children of your Father in Heaven; and he that has a
Father in Heaven, has all reason to be the joyfullest man upon earth: in that
day you are delivered from the sting and hurt of death; and he that is
delivered from the sting of death, has the best reason to take in the comfort
of life. O come to Christ, come to Christ; till you come to Christ, no true
comfort can come to you.

The Sixteenth SERMON. Sermon 16.

EPHESIANS. 1. 7. Text. Enforcing the general exhortation by a seventh motive drawn
from the first benefit purchased by Christ.
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according
to the riches of his grace.
SIx great Motives have been presented already from the Titles of Christ, to
draw the hearts of sinners to him: more are now to be offered from the benefits
redounding to Believers by Christ. Essaying by all means to win the hearts of
men to Christ. To this end I shall in the first place open that glorious
privilege of Gospel remission; freely and fully conferred upon all that come
to Christ by faith, in whom we have redemption by faith, etc.

In which words we have first a singular benefit, or choice mercy bestowed,
viz. Redemption; interpreted by way of apposition, the remission of sins: this
is a privilege of the first rank, a mercy by it self: none sweeter, none more
desirable among all the benefits that come by Christ. And therefore,

Secondly, You have the price of this mercy, an account what it cost, even the
blood of Christ; in whom we have redemption [through his blood] Precious things
are of great price, the blood of Christ is the meritorious cause of remission.

Thirdly, You have here also the impulsive cause, moving God to grant pardons
at this rate to sinners, and that is said to be the riches of his grace. Where
by the way you see, that the freeness of the grace of God, and the fullness of
the satisfaction of Christ meet together without the least jar in the remission
of sin; contrary to the vain cavil of the Socinian adversaries, In whom we have
redemption, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace.

Fourthly, You have the qualified subjects of this blessed privilege, viz.
Believers, in whose name he here speaks [we] have remission, (i. e.) we the
Saints, and faithful in Christ Jesus, verse. 1. we whom he has chosen in Christ
before the foundation of the world, and predestined unto the adoption of
Children, verse. 4, 5. we that are made accepted in the beloved, verse. 6. it is
we, and we only who have redemption through his blood.

Hence observe,

DOCT.
That all Believers, and none but Believers, receive the remission Doct.
of their sins through the riches of grace, by the blood of Jesus Christ.

In the explication of this point, three things must be spoken to.

1. That all that are in Christ are in a pardoned state. 2. That their pardon
is the purchase of the blood of Christ. 3. That the riches of Grace are
manifested in remission.
First, That all that are in Christ are in a pardoned state: where I will first
show you what pardon or the remission of sin is.

Secondly, That this is the privilege of none but Believers.

First, Now remission of sin is the gracious act of God, in and through Christ,
discharging a believing sinner from all the guilt and punishment of his sin,
both temporal and eternal.

It Is the act of God, he is the author of remission, none can forgive sins but
God only, Mark 2. 7. against him only (i. e.) principally and essentially the
offense is committed, Psalm. 51. 4. To his Judgment guilt binds over the soul,
and who can remit the debt, but the Creditor, Mat. 6. 12.

It Is an act of God discharging the sinner: it is Gods loosing of one that
stood bound, the cancelling of his bond, or obligation: called therefore
remission, or releasing in the Text: the blotting out of our iniquities, or the
removing our sins from us, as it is called in other Scriptures, see Psalm. 103.
11. Mica. 7. 18, 19.

It is a gracious act of God, the effect of pure grace, done for his own name
sake, Isai. 43. 25. discharging us without any satisfaction at all by us; there
is much grace in that: and providing a surety for us every way able to pay our
debt, there is more grace in that.

It Is the gracious act of God in and through Christ: the satisfaction of Christ
is the procuring cause of our remission, and so God declares himself just in
the remission of our sin, Romans 3, 25. Gracious is the Lord and righteous, Psalm.
116. 5. Justice and mercy meet here, and embrace each other: in whom (says the
Text) we have remission: no other price could purchase this privilege, Micah
6. 6, 7. not rivers of Oil, or humane Blood.

And this gracious act of God discharges the pardoned soul both from guilt and
punishment: guilt is nothing else but the force and power that is in sin, to
oblige the sinner to undergo the penalty due to sin. Therefore sinners are said
to be guilty of Hellfire, Mat. 5. 22. Guilty of eternal judgment, Mark 3. 29.
to be under the judgment of God, Romans 3. 19. Remission takes away both guilt
and punishment together, it takes away all guilt, Acts 13. 38, 39. and all
punishment. And so much of the first thing to be opened, namely what the
remission of sin is.

Secondly, Now that this remission of sin is the privilege of Believers is
most apparent, for all the causes of remission are in conjunction to procure it
for them. The love of God which is the impulsive cause of pardon: the blood of
Christ which is the meritorious cause of pardon; and saving faith which is the
instrumental cause of pardon, do all cooperate for their remission, as is plain
in the Text.

Besides, all the promises of pardon are made to them, Jer. 31. 34. Micah 7.
18. and Lastly, All the signs of pardon are sound in them, and in them only,
that love God, Luke 7. 47. mercisulness to others, Mat. 6. 14. a blessed
calmness and peace in the Conscience, Romans 5. 1. So that it is a truth beyond
controversy, that all that are in Christ are in a pardoned state.

Secondly, Next I will show you, that the Pardon of Believers 2.
is the purchase of the blood of Christ: nothing but the blood of Christ is a
price equivalent to the remission of sin, for this blood was innocent and
untainted blood, 1 Pet. 1. 19. the blood of a Lamb without spot. This blood was
precious blood, blood of infinite worth and value, the blood of God, Acts 20.
28. it was prepared blood for this very purpose, Heb. 10. 5. prepared by Gods
eternal appointment: prepared by Christ's miraculous and extraordinary
production; by the operation of the Spirit: prepared by his voluntary
sequestration, or sanctification of himself to this very use and purpose.

The blood of Jesus is not only innocent, precious and prepared blood, but it
is also blood actually shed and sacrificed to the justice of God, for the
expiation of guilt, and procurement of our discharge, Isai. 53. 5. To conclude,
the severe justice of God could put in no exception against the blood of
Christ, it is unexceptionable blood, being (as before was noted) untainted by
sin, and dignified above all estimation by the person whose blood it was.
Justice required no less, and could demand no more: and this is the price at
which our pardons are purchased: and without which no sin could be pardoned,
for without shedding of blood (such blood as this) there is no remission, Heb.
9. 22.

Thirdly, The last thing to be opened is, That God has 3.
manifested the riches of his grace in the remission of our sins: so speaks the
Apostle, Romans 5. 20. Where sin abounded grace did much more abound: And 1 Timothy
1. 14. The grace of our Lord (viz. in the pardon of sin) was exceeding
abundant. Which will appear (if we bring our thoughts close to the matter) in
several particulars.

First, From the nature of the mercy, which is the richest of all mercies,
except Christ, the purchaser of it: no mercy sweeter than a pardon to a
condemned sinner. No pardon like Gods pardon, to a man condemned at his Bar:
all the goodness of God is made to pass before our eyes in his pardoning acts
of grace, Exodus 33. 19.

Secondly, The very riches of grace must needs be in the pardon of sin, if we
consider the method in which pardons are dispensed, which is (as the Text
speaks) through his blood. Herein God commends his love to us, Romans 5. 8. he
commends it more, than if he had pardoned sin without such a sacrifice, for
then he had only displayed his mercy; but not caused Mercy and Justice to meet
and triumph together.

Thirdly, The riches of his grace shines forth in the peculiarity of the mercy.
Remission is no common favor, it was never extended to the fallen Angels, nor
to the far greater part of the children of men, but only to a little flock, a
small remnant of mankind, Luke 12. 32. Joh. 17. 9.

Fourthly, The riches of grace are manifested in remission, if we consider the
subjects of this privilege, who are not only equally plunged into sin and
misery with others by nature, Ephesians. 2. 3. but many of the Lords pardoned ones
are actually guilty of deeper-died abominations, than many unpardoned ones in
the civilized world are defiled with. To me (says Paul) the greatest of
sinners, one that was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, etc. yet to me is this
grace given. I obtained mercy, 1 Timothy 1. 15. and such were some of you, but ye
are justified, 1 Cor. 6. 11. Yea, God singles out the most base, despised,
poor, and contemptible ones among men, to be the subjects of this glorious
privilege, 1 Cor. 1. 26. You see your calling brethren, etc.

Fifthly, More of the riches of grace still appears if we view the latitude and
extent of this act of grace. Oh how innumerable are our transgressions! Who can
understand his errors? Psalm. 19. 12. Yet the blood of Christ cleanses us from
all sin, 1 John 1. 7. Small and great sins, open and secret sins, old and new
sins; all pardoned without exception. O the riches of grace! O the unsearchable
goodness of God! With the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous
redemption; and he shall redeem Israel from all his Iniquities, Psalm. 130. 7, 8.

Sixthly, and lastly, The riches of Grace shine forth in the irrevocableness
and perpetuity of remission: as grace pardons all sins without exception, so
the pardons it bestows are without revocation. The pardoned soul shall never
come into condemnation, Joh. 5. 24. As far as the East is from the West, so far
has he removed our transgressions from us, Psalm. 103. 10. The East and West
are the two opposite points of Heaven, which can never come together; neither
shall the pardoned soul and its sins ever meet any more. Thou have cast (says
Hezekiah) all my sins behind thy back. The penitent Believer sets his sins
before his face, but the merciful God casts them all behind his back, never to
behold them more, so as to charge them upon his pardoned people. And thus you
see, what the pardon of sin is, what the price that purchases pardon is; and
what riches of grace God manifests in the remission of Believers sins: which
were the things to be explained and opened in the Doctrinal part. The
improvement of the whole you will have in the following Uses.

Inference 1.
If this be so that all Believers, and none but Believers receive Inference 1.
the remission of their sins through the riches of grace, by the blood of
Christ: What a happy condition then are Believers in! Those that never felt the
load of sin, may make light of a pardon, but so cannot you that have been in
the deeps of trouble and fear about it: those that have been upon the rack of
an accusing and condemning Conscience, as David, Heman, and many of the Saints
have been, can never sufficiently value a pardon. Blessed is the man whose
transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered; blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputes not iniquity, Psalm. 32. 1, 2. or, O the blessednesses and
felicities of the pardoned man! as the Hebrew sounds. Remission cannot but
appear the wonder of (...)
mercies, if we consider through what difficulties the grace of God makes way
for it to our souls; what strong bars the love of God breaks asunder, to open
our way to this privilege: for there can be no pardon without a Mediator: no
other Mediator but the Son of God: the Son of God cannot discharge our debts
but by taking them upon himself as our surety, and making full payment by
bearing the wrath of God for us; and when all this is done, there can be no
actual pardon, except the spirit of grace open our blind eyes, break our hard
hearts, and draw them to Christ in the way of believing. And as the mercy of
remission comes to us through wonderful difficulties, so it is in it self a
complete and perfect mercy. God would not be at such vast expense of the riches
of his grace, Christ would not lay out the invaluable treasures of his precious
blood to procure a cheap and common blessing for us. Rejoice then ye pardoned
souls, God has done great things for you, for which you have cause to be glad.

Inference 2.
Hence it follows, That interest in Christ by faith brings the Inference 2.
Conscience of a Believer into a state of rest and peace, Romans 5. 1. Being
justified by faith we have peace with God. I say not that every Believer is
presently brought into actual peace and tranquillity of Conscience, there may
be many fears, and much trouble even in a pardoned soul: but this is an
undoubted truth, that faith brings the pardoned soul into that condition and
state where he may find perfect rest in his Conscience, with respect to the
guilt and danger of sin. The blood of Christ sprinkles us from an evil (that is
an accusing, condemning) Conscience. We are apt to fear, that this or that
special sin, which has most terrified and affrighted our Consciences, is not
forgiven: but if there be riches enough in the grace of God, and efficacy
enough in the blood of Christ; then the sins of Believers, all their sins,
great as well as small, one as well as another without limitation or exception
are pardoned.

For let us but consider, if God remits no sin to any man, but with respect to
the blood of Christ, then all sins are pardoned as well as any one sin; because
the dignity and desert of that blood is infinite, and as much deserves an
universal pardon for all sins, as the particular pardon of any, even the least
sin. Moreover, remission is an act of Gods Fatherly love in Christ, and if it
be so, then certainly no sin of any Believer can be retained or excluded from
pardon: for then the same soul should be in the favor of God so far as it is
pardoned, and out of the favor of God, so far as it is unpardoned; and all
this at one and the same instant of time, which is a thing both repugnant to it
self, and to the whole stream of the Gospel.

To Conclude, what is the design and end of remission, but the saving of the
pardoned soul? But if any sin be retained or excluded from pardon, the
retaining of that sin must needs irritate and void the pardon of all other
sins; and so the acts of God must cross and contradict each other; and the
design and end of God miscarry and be lost, which can never be. So then we
conclude, faith brings the believing soul into a state of rest and peace.

Inference 3.
Hence it also follows, That no remission is to be expected by any Inference 3.
soul without interest by faith in Jesus Christ: no Christ no pardon, no faith
no Christ. Yet how apt are many poor deluded souls to expect pardon in that way
where never any soul yet did, or ever can meet it? Some look for pardon from
the absolute mercy of God, without any regard to the blood of Christ, or their
interest therein: we have sinned, but God is merciful. Some expect remission of
sin by virtue of their own duties, not Christ's merits. I have sinned but I will
repent, restore, reform, and God will pardon: but little do such men know how
they therein diminish the evil of sin, undervalue the justice of God, slight
the blood of Christ, and put an undoing cheat upon their own souls for-ever: to
expect pardon from absolute mercy, or our own duties, is to knock at the wrong
door, which God has shut up to all the world, Romans 3. 20. Whilst these two
principles abide firm, that the price of pardon is only in the blood of Christ,
and the benefit of pardon only by the application of his blood to us; this must
remain a sure conclusion, that no remission is to be expected by any soul
without interest by faith in Jesus Christ. Repentance, restitution and
reformation are excellent duties in their kind, and in their proper places; but
they were never meant for saviors or satisfactions to God for sin.

Inference 4.
If the riches of grace be thus manifested in the pardon of sin, Inference 4.
how vile an abuse is it of the grace of God to take the more liberty to sin,
because grace abounds in the pardon of it!

Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid, Romans 6. 1, 2.
Will no cheaper stuff than the grace of God serve to make a cloak for sin? O
vile abuse of the most excellent thing in the whole world! did Christ shed his
blood to expiate our guilt, and dare we make that a plea to extenuate our
guilt? God forbid.

If it be intolerable ingratitude among men to requite good with evil, sure
that sin must want a name bad enough to express it, which puts the greatest
dishonor upon God for the greatest mercy that ever was given by God to the
world: there is mercy with thee (says the Psalmist) that thou may be feared,
not that thou may be the more abused, Psalm. 130. 4. Nay, let me say the
Devils never sinned at this rate: they cannot abuse the pardoning grace of God,
because such grace was never offered unto them. And certainly if the abuse of
the common mercies of God, as meat and drink by gluttony and drunkenness, be an
heinous sin, and highly provoking to God: then the abuse of the riches of his
grace, and the precious blood of his Son must be out of measure sinful; and the
greatest affront we can put upon the God of mercy.

Inference 5.
To Conclude, If this be so, as ever you expect pardon and Inference 5.
mercy from God, come to Christ in the way of faith; receive and embrace him
now in the tenders of the Gospel.

To drive home this great Exhortation, I beseech you, as in the bowels of
Christ Jesus, and by all the regard and value you have for your own souls, let
these following Considerations sink down into your hearts.

First, That all Christless persons are actually under the condemnation of God,
John 3. 18. He that believes not is condemned already: and it must needs be
so, for every soul is concluded under the curse of the Law, till Christ make
him free, John 8. 36. Till we are in Christ, we are dead by Law, and when we
believe unto justification, then we pass from death to life. A blind mistaken
Conscience may possibly acquit you, but assure your selves God condemns you.

Secondly, Consider what a terrible thing it is to lie under the condemnation
of God, the most terrible things in nature cannot shadow forth the misery of
such a state. Put all sicknesses, all poverty, all reproaches, the torments
invented by all Tyrants into one Scale, and the condemnation of God into the
other; and they will be all found lighter than a Feather. Condemnation is the
sentence of God, the great and terrible God: It Is a sentence shutting you up to
everlasting wrath; it is a sentence never to be reversed, but by the application
of Christ in the season thereof. O souls, you cannot bear the wrath of God, you
do not understand it if you think it tolerable: one drop of it upon your
Consciences now, is enough to distract you in the midst of all the pleasures
and comforts of this world: yet all that are out of Christ are sentenced to the
fullness of Gods wrath for ever.

Thirdly, There is yet a possibility of escaping the wrath to come: a door of
hope opened to the worst of sinners: a day of grace is afforded to the Children
of men, Heb. 3. 15. God declares himself unwilling that any should perish, 2
Pet. 3. 9. O what a mercy is this! Who that is on this side Heaven or Hell
fully understands the worth of it?

Fourthly, This door of mercy will be shortly shut, Luke 12. 25. God has many
ways to shut it: he sometimes shuts it by withdrawing the means of grace, and
removing the Candlesticks, a judgment at this time to be greatly feared.
Sometimes shuts he it by withdrawing his Spirit and blessing from the means,
whereby all Ordinances lose their efficacy, 1 Cor. 3. 7. But if he shut it not
by removing the means of grace from you, certain it is, it will be shortly shut
by your removal from all the means and opportunities by Salvation by death.

Fifthly, When once the door of mercy is shut, you are gone beyond all the
possibilities of pardon and salvation, for evermore: the night is then come, in
which no man can work, John 9. 4. All the golden seasons you now enjoy will be
irrecoverably gone out of your reach.

Sixthly, Pardons are now daily granted to others: some (and they once as far
from mercy as you now are) are at this day reading their pardons with tears of
joy dropping upon them. The world is full of the examples and instances of the
riches of pardoning grace. And whatever is needful for you to do in the way of
repentance, and faith to obtain your pardon; how easily shall it be done, if
once the day of Gods power come upon you? Psalm. 110. 3. Oh therefore lift up
your cries to Heaven, give the Lord no rest, take no denial till he open the
blind eye, break the stony heart, open and bow the stubborn will, effectually
draw thy soul to Christ; and deliver thy pardon signed in his blood.

The Seventeenth SERMON. Sermon 17.

EPHESIANS. 1. 6. Text. Opening the eighth motive to come to Christ, drawn from the
second benefit purchased by Christ for Believers.
To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in
the beloved.
IN our last discourse we opened to you the blessed privilege of remission of
sin from the following verse; in this verse lies another glorious privilege,
viz. the acceptance that Believers have with God through Jesus Christ: both
which comprise (as the two main branches) our justification before God. In the
words read (to omit many things that might be profitably observed from the
method and dependence of the Apostles discourse) three particulars are
observable,

viz. 1. The Privilege it self. 2. The Meritorous Cause. 3. The ultimate end
thereof.

First, The privilege it self, which is exceeding rich and 1.
sweet in its own nature; he has made us accepted: the word is (...) he has
ingratiated us, or brought us into the grace, favor and acceptance of God the
Father; endeared us to him, so that we find grace in his sight.

Secondly, The meritorious cause purchasing and procuring this benefit for us,
noted in these words, (...), in 2.
the beloved; which words are a periphrasis of Christ, who is here emphatically
called the Beloved, the great favorite of Heaven, the delight of Gods soul, the
prime object of his love: it is he that obtains this benefit for Believers: he
is accepted for his own sake, and we for his.

Thirdly, The ultimate end and aim of conferring this benefit upon Believers:
to the praise of the glory of his grace: or 3.
to the end that his grace might be made glorious in praises: there are riches
of grace in this act of God, and the work and business of Believers, both in
this world and in that to come, is to search and admire, aknowledge, and
magnify God for his abundant grace herein.

Hence the note is,

DOCT.
That Jesus Christ has purchased and procured special favor Doct.
and acceptance with God for all that are in him.

This point lies plain in Scripture, Ephesians. 2. 13. But now in Jesus Christ, ye
who sometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ, (...), made
nigh, a term of endearedness: nothing is taken into the very bosom and embraces
but what is very dear, precious and acceptable: and in Rev. 1. 5, 6. Believers
are said to be made by Jesus Christ, Kings and Priests unto God, and his
Father, (i. e.) dignified favorites, upon whom the special marks of honor are
set by God.

In the opening of this point, three things must be doctrinally discussed and
opened.

viz. 1. What the acceptance of our persons with God is. 2. How it appears
that Believers are so accepted with God. 3. How Christ the beloved procures
this benefit for Believers.

First, What the acceptance of our persons with God is? 1.
To open which, we must remember, that there is a twofold acceptance of persons
noted in Scripture.

1. One is the sinful act of a corrupt man. 2. The other the gracious act of a
merciful God.
First, accepting of persons is noted in Scripture as the sinful act of a
corrupt man: a thing which God abhors: being the corruption and abuse of that
power and authority which men have in judgment: overlooking the merit of the
cause through sinful respect to the quality of the person, whose cause it is.
So that the cause does not commend the person, but the person the cause: this
God every where brands in men, as a vile perverting of judgment, and utterly
disclaims it himself, Gal. 2. 6. God accepts no man's person: Romans 2. 11.
There is no respect of persons with God.

Secondly, There is also an accepting of persons, which is the gracious act of
a merciful God; whereby he receives both the persons and duties of Believers
into special grace and favor for Christ's sake: and of this my Text speaks. In
which act of favor three things are supposed or included.

First, It supposes an estate of alienation and enmity: those only are accepted
into favor that were out of favor; and indeed so stood the case with us,
Ephesians. 2. 12, 13. Ye were aliens and strangers, but now in Christ Jesus, ye who
sometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. So the Apostle
Peter, in 1 Pet. 2. 10. Which in time past were not a people, but now are the
people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. The
fall made a fearful breach betwixt God and man. Sin like a thick cloud
intercepted all the beams of divine favor from us: the satisfaction of Christ
dissolves that cloud, Isai. 44. 22. I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy
transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins: This dark cloud thus dissolved, the
face of God shines forth again with cheerful beams of favor and love upon all,
who by faith are interested in Jesus Christ.

Secondly, It includes the removing of guilt from the persons of Believers, by
the imputation of Christ's righteousness to them, Romans 5. 1, 2. Being justified
by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we
have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand: for the face of God
cannot shine upon the wicked: the person must be first made righteous before it
can be made accepted.

Thirdly, it includes the offering up, or tendering of our persons and duties
to God by Jesus Christ. Accepting implies presenting or tendering: Believers
indeed do present themselves to God, Romans 12. 1. but Christ's presenting them
makes their tender of themselves acceptable to the Lord, Col. 1. 22. In the
body of his flesh through death to present you holy, and unblameable, and
unreproveable in his sight. Christ leads every Believer as it were by the hand,
into the gracious presence of God; after this manner bespeaking acceptance for
him. Father, here is a poor soul that was born in sin, has lived in Rebellion
against thee all his days; he has broken all thy laws, and deserved all thy
wrath; yet he is one of that number which thou gave me before the world was.
I have made full payment by my blood for all his sins. I have opened his eyes
to see the sinfulness, and misery of his condition: broken his heart for his
rebellions against thee: bowed his will in obedience unto thy will: united him
to my self by faith, as a living member of my body. And now, Lord, since he is
become mine by regeneration, let him be thine also by special acceptance: let
the same love with which thou love me, embrace him also who is now become
mine. And so much for the first particular, viz. what acceptance with God is.

Secondly, In the next place I must show you how it appears 2.
that Believers are thus ingratiated or brought into the special favor of God
by Jesus Christ. And this will be evidenced diverse ways.

First, By the Titles of love and endearedness with which the Lord graceth and
honors Believers, who are sometimes called the household of God, Ephesians. 2.
19. the friends of God, Jam. 2. 23. the dear Children of God, Ephesians. 5. 1. the
peculiar people of God, 1 Pet. 2. 9. A Crown of Glory, and a Royal Diadem in
the hand of their God, Isai. 62. 3. the objects of his delight and pleasure,
Psalm. 147. 10, 11. Oh what terms of endearedness does God use toward his
people! Does not all this speak them to be in special favor with him? Which of
all these alone does not signify a person highly in favor with God?

Secondly, The gracious manner in which he treats them upon the throne of
grace, to which he allows them to come with boldness, Heb. 4. 16. This also
speaks them in the special favor of God: he allows them to come to him in
prayer, with the liberty, confidence and filial boldness of children to a
Father, Gal. 4. 6. Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his
Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father: the familiar voice of a dear child:
yea, which is a wonderful dignation and condescension of the great God to poor
worms of the earth, he says, Isai. 45. 11. Thus says the Lord the holy One of
Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and
concerning the work of my hands command ye me: an expression so full of grace
and special favor to Believers, that it needs great caution in reading and
understanding such an high and astonishing expression: the meaning is, that God
has as it were subjected the works of his hands to the prayers of his Saints:
and it is as if he had said, If my glory, and your necessity shall require it,
do but ask me in prayer, and whatever my almighty power can do, I will do it
for you: however let no favorite of Heaven forget the infinite distance
betwixt himself and God. Abraham was a great favorite of Heaven, and was
called the friend of God, yet see with what humility of spirit, and reverential
awe he addresseth to God, Genesis 18. 27. Behold now I have taken upon me to speak
unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes. So that you see the Titles of
favor above mentioned are no empty Titles.

Thirdly, Gods readiness to grant, as well as their liberty to ask speaks them
the special favorites of God. The heart of God is so propense, and ready to
grant the desires of Believers, that it is but ask and have, Mat. 7. 7. the
door of grace is opened at the knock of prayer: that is a favorite indeed to
whom the King gives a blank to insert what request he will: If ye abide in me,
and my words abide in you; ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto
you, John 15. 7. Oh blessed liberty of the sons of God! David did but say, Lord
turn the Counsel of Ahitophel into foolishness, and it was done as soon as
asked, 2 Samuel 15. 31. Joshua did but say, Thou Sun stand still in Gibeon: and a
miraculous stop was presently put to its swift motion in the Heavens: nay,
which is wonderful to consider, a prayer in the womb, yet unborn, I mean
conceived in the heart, and not yet uttered by the lips of Believers, is often
anticipated by the propenseness of free grace, Isai. 65. 24. And it shall come
to pass that before they call I will answer, and whilst they are yet speaking I
will hear. The prayers of others are rejected as an abomination, Prove. 15. 8.
God casts them back into their-faces, Mal. 2. 3. But free grace signs the
petitions of the Saints more readily, than they are presented: we have not that
freedom to ask, that God has to give: it is true, the answer of a Believers
prayers may be a long time suspended from his sense and knowledge; but every
prayer according to the will of God is presently granted in Heaven, though for
wise and holy ends they may be held in a doubtful suspense about them upon
earth.

Fourthly, The free discoveries of the secrets of Gods heart to Believers*
speaks them to be his special favorites: men open not the counsels and secrets
of their own hearts to enemies or strangers, but to their most inward and
intimate friends: The secret of the Lord is-with them that fear him, and he
will show them his Covenant, Psalm. 25. 14. When God was about to destroy Sodom,
he will do nothing in that work of judgment till he had acquainted Abraham,
his friend, with his purpose therein, Genesis 18. 17. And the Lord said, Shall I
hide from Abraham that thing which I do? for I know him, etc. So when a King
was to be elected for Israel, and the person whom God had chosen, was yet
unknown to the people, God as it were whispered that secret unto Samuel the day
before, 1 Samuel 9. 15. Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
came: according to the manner of Princes with some special favorite.

Fifthly, The Lords receiving every small thing that comes from them with grace
and favor, when (mean while) he rejects the greatest things offered by others,
does certainly bespeak Believers the special favorites of God. There was but
one good word in a whole sentence from Sarah, and that very word is noted and
commended by God, 1 Pet. 3. 6. She called him Lord. There were but some small
beginnings or buddings of grace in young Abijah, and the Lord took special
notice of it, 1 Kings 14. 12. Because in him there is found some good thing
toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. Let this be an
encouragement to young ones, in whom there are found any breathing desires
after Christ: God will not reject them if any sincerity be found in them: a
secret groan uttered to God in sincerity shall not be despised, Romans 8. 26. The
very bent of a Believers will when he has no more to offer unto God is an
acceptable present, 2 Cor. 8. 11. The very intent and purpose that lies
secretly in the heart of a Believer, not yet executed, is accepted with him, 1
Kings 8. 18. Where as it was in thine heart to build an house to my name, thou
did well that it was in thine heart. Thus small things offered to God by
Believers find acceptance with him, whilst the greatest presents, even solemn
assemblies, Sabbaths and prayers from others are rejected: They are a trouble
unto me (says God) I am weary to bear them, Isai. 1. 14, 15. Incense from
Sheba, the sweet Cane from a far Country are not acceptable, nor sacrifices
sweet unto God from other hands, Jer. 6. 20. From all which it appears beyond
doubt, that the persons and duties of Believers are accepted into the special
favor of God by Jesus Christ: which was the second thing to be spoken to, and
brings us to the third general, viz.

Thirdly, How Christ the Beloved procures this benefit for 3.
Believers? And this he does four ways.

First, By the satisfaction of his blood, Romans 5. 10. When we were enemies, we
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son. No friendship without
reconciliation, no reconciliation but by the blood of Christ: therefore the new
and living way by which Believers come unto God with acceptance, is said to be
consecrated for us through the veil of Christ's flesh, and hence believers have
boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, Heb. 10. 19, 20.

Secondly, The favor of God is procured for Believers, by their mystical union
with Christ, whereby they are made members of his body, of his flesh, and of
his bones, Ephesians. 5. 30. So that look as Adams posterity stood upon the same
terms that he their natural head did; so Believers Christ's mystical members
stand in the favor of God, by the favor which Christ their spiritual head
has, John 17. 33. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
one, and that the world may know that thou have sent me, and have loved them,
as thou have loved me.

Thirdly, Believers are brought into favor with God by Christ's becoming their
Altar, upon which their persons and duties are all offered up to God: the Altar
sanctifies the gift, Heb. 13. 10. And this was typified by that legal rite
mentioned, Luke 1. 9, 10. Christ is that golden Altar from whence all the
prayers of the Saints ascend to the throne of God, perfumed with the odours and
incense of his merits, Rev. 8. 34. And another Angel came and stood at the
Altar, having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much incense that
he should offer it, with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which
was before the Throne; and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers
of the Saints ascended up before God, out of the Angels hand. And thus you see
how the persons and duties of Believers are brought into favor and acceptance
with God by Jesus Christ. The Uses follow.

Inference 1.
If all Believers be in favor with God, how great a mercy is Inference 1.
it to have the prayers of such engaged on our behalf? Would we have our
business speed in Heaven, let us get into favor with God our selves, and
engage the prayers of his people, the favorites of Heaven, for us: vis unita
fortior, one Believer can do much, many can do more: when Daniel designed to
get the knowledge of that secret hinted in the obscure dream of the King, which
none but the God of Heaven could make known, it is said, Dan. 2. 17. Then Daniel
went to his House, and made the thing known to Hanania, Mishael and Azaria his
Companions; that they would desire mercies of the God of Heaven concerning this
secret. The benefit of such assistance in prayer by the help of other
favorites with God, is plainly intimated by Jesus Christ unto us, Mat. 18. 19.
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask,
it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven. God sometimes stands
upon a number of voices, for the carrying of some public mercy; because he
delights in the harmony of many praying souls, and also loves to oblige and
gratify many in the answer and return of the same prayer. I know this usage is
grown too formal and complemental among Professors: but certainly it is a great
advantage to be inward with them, who are so with God. St. Bernard prescribing
rules for effectual prayer, closes them up with this wish, and cum talis
fueris, memento mei, when thy heart is in this frame, then remember me.

Inference 2.
If Believers be such favorites in Heaven, in what a desperate Inference 2.
condition is that Cause, and those Persons against whom the generality of
Believers are daily engaged in prayers and cries to Heaven?

Certainly Rome shall feel the dint and force of the many millions of prayers
that are gone up to Heaven from the Saints for many generations: the cries of
the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus, joined with the cries of thousands of
Believers will bring down vengeance at last upon the Man of sin. It Is said,
Rev. 8. 4, 5, 6. That the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of
the Saints, ascended up before God out of the Angels hand: and immediately it
is added, verse. 5. And the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire of
the Altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voices, and thunderings,
and lightnings, and earthquakes, and the seven Angels, which had the seven
Trumpets, prepared themselves to sound. The prayer of a single Saint is
sometimes followed with wonderful effects, Psalm. 18. 6, 7. In my distress I
called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his
Temple, and my cry came before him even into his ears: then the earth shook and
trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved, and were shaken because he
was wroth: what then can a thundering legion of such praying souls do! It was
said of Luther, iste vir potuit cum Deo quicquid voluit, that man could have of
God what he would, his enemies felt the weight of his prayers, and the Church
of God reaped the benefits thereof. The Queen of Scots professed she was more
afraid of the Prayers of Mr. Knox, than of an army of ten thousand men: these
were mighty wrestlers with God, howsoever contemned and vilified among their
enemies. There Jacobus Lanigius, the Sorbone Doctor, who wrote the lives of
Luther, Knox and Calvin, speaks as if the Devil had hired his pen to abuse
those precious servants of Christ.
will a time come when God will hear the prayers of his people, who are
continually crying in his ears, How long Lord, how long.

Inference 3.
Let no Believer be dejected at the contempts and slightings of Inference 3.
men, so long as they stand in the grace and favor of God: it is the lot of
the best men to have the worst usage in this world: those of whom the world was
not worthy, are not thought (...) (i. e) the sweepings of the house: the filth
wiped off any thing: Erasmus, the dirt that sticks to the Shoos: Valla, the
dung of the Belly as the Syriack translates. The condemned man that was tumbled
from a steep Rock into the Sea, as a sacrifice to Neptune, was called (...),
says Budeus. Sit pro nobis (...).
worthy to live in the world, Heb. 11. 38. Paul and his Companions were men of
choice and excellent spirits, yet says he, 1 Cor 4. 13. Being defamed we
entreat, we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all
things unto this day: they are words signifying the basest, contemptiblest and
most abhorred things among men. How is Heaven and Earth divided in their
Judgments and estimations of the Saints! those whom men call filth and dirt,
God calls a peculiar Treasure, a Crown of Glory, a Royal Diadem. But trouble
not thy self Believer for the unjust censures of the blind world, they speak
evil of the things they know not: he that is spiritual judges all things, yet
he himself is judged of no man, 1 Cor. 2. 14. You can discern the earthliness
and baseness of their spirits, they want a faculty to discern the excellency
and choiceness of your spirits. He that carries a dark Lanthorn in the night,
can discern him that comes against him, and yet is not discerned by him: a
Courtier regards not a slight in the Country, so long as he has the ear and
favor of his Prince.

Inference 4.
Never let Believers fear the want of any good thing necessary Inference 4.
for them in this world: the favor of God is the fountain of all blessings,
provisions, protections, even of all that you need. He has promised that he
will withhold no good thing from them that walk uprightly, Psalm. 84. 11. He
that is bountiful to his enemies will not withhold what is good from his
friends. The favor of God will not only supply your needs, but protect your
persons, Psalm. 5. 12. Thou will bless the righteous, with favor will thou
compass him as with a shield.

Inference 5.
Hence also it follows, that the sins of Believers are very piercing Inference
5.
things to the heart of God. The unkindness of those whom he has received into
his very bosom, upon whom he has set his special favor and delight, who are
more obliged to him than all the people of the earth beside, O this wounds the
very heart of God. What a melting expostulation was that which the Lord used
with David, 2 Samuel 12. 7, 8. I anointed thee King over all Israel, and I
delivered thee out of the hand of Saul, and I gave thee thy masters house, and
thy masters wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and Juda;
and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and
such things: wherefore have thou despised the Commandment of the Lord? But
Reader, if thou be a reconciled person, a favorite with God, and have grieved
him by any eminent transgression, how should it melt thy heart to hear the Lord
thus expostulating with thee: I delivered thee out of the hand of Satan: I gave
thee into the bosom of Christ: I have pardoned unto thee millions of sins, I
have bestowed upon thee the riches of mercy: my favor has made thee great;
and as if all this were too little, I have prepared Heaven for thee: for which
of all these favors do thou thus requite me?

Inference 6.
How precious should Jesus Christ be to Believers, by whose Inference 6.
blood they are ingratiated with God, and by whose intercession they are and
shall for ever be continued in his favor? When the Apostle mentions the
Believers translation from the sad state of nature to the blessed privileged
state of grace, see what a Title he bestows upon Jesus Christ the purchaser of
that privilege, calling him the dear Son, Col. 1. 13. not only dear to God,
but exceeding dear to Believers also. Christ is the favorite in Heaven, to him
you owe all your preferment there: take away Christ, and you have no ground to
stand one minute in the favor of God. O then let Jesus Christ the fountain of
your honor be also the object of your love and praise.

Inference 7.
Estimate by this the state and condition of a deserted Saint Inference 7.
upon whom the favor of God is eclipsed. If the favor of God be better than
life, the hiding of it from a gracious soul must be more bitter than death:
deserted Saints have reason to take the first place among all the mourners in
the world: the darkness before conversion had indeed more of danger, but this
has more of trouble. Darkness after light is dismal darkness. Since therefore
the case is so sad, let your preventing care be the more: grieve not the good
Spirit of God, you prepare but for your own grief in so doing.

Inference 8.
Lastly, Let this persuade all men to accept Jesus Christ, as Inference 8.
ever they expect to be accepted with the Lord themselves. It is a fearful case
for a man's person and duties to be rejected of God: to cry and not be heard:
and much more terrible to be denied audience in the great and terrible day. Yet
as sure as the Scriptures are the sealed and faithful sayings Si voluntatem Dei
nosse quisquam desiderat, fit amicus Deo, August.
of God, this is no more than what every Christless person must expect in that
day, Mat. 7. 22. Luke 13. 26. Trace the history of all times, even as high as
Abel, and you shall find that none but Believers did ever find acceptance with
God: all experience confirms this great truth, that they that are in the flesh
cannot please God. Reader, if this be thy condition let me beg thee to ponder
the misery of it in a few sad thoughts.

Consider how sad it is to be rejected of God, and forsaken by all creatures at
once: what a day of streights thy dying day is like to be, when Heaven and
Earth shall cast thee out together. Be assured whatever thy vain hopes for the
present quiet thee withal, this must be thy case, the door of mercy will be
shut against thee, no man comes to the Father but by Christ. Sad was the case
of Saul when he told Samuel, the Philistines make war against me, and God is
departed from me, 1 Samuel 28. 15. The Saints will have boldness in the day of
Judgment, 1 John 4. 17. but thou will be a confounded man; there is yet,
blessed be the God of mercy, a capacity and opportunity of reconciliation, 2
Cor. 5. 19. Isai. 27. 5. But this can be of no long continuance. O therefore by
all the regard and love you have for the everlasting welfare of your own souls,
come to Christ, embrace Christ in the offers of the Gospel, that you may be
made accepted in the beloved.

The Eighteenth SERMON. Sermon 18.

JOHN 8. 36. Text. The liberty of Believers opened, and stated.
If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
FRom the 30th verse of this Chapter unto my Text, you have an account of the
different effects which the words of Christ had upon the hearts of his hearers:
some believed, verse 30. these he encourages to continue in his word, verse
31. giving them this encouragement, verse. 32. Ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free. Hereat the unbelieving Jews take offense, and
commence a quarrel with him, verse. 33. We be Abraham's seed, and were never in
bondage to any man. We are of no slavish extraction, the blood of Abraham runs
in our veins: this scornful boast of the proud Jews, Christ confutes, verse. 34.
where he distinguishes of a twofold bondage; one to men, another to sin; one
civil, another spiritual: whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin, then
tells them, verse. 36. The servant abides not in the house for ever, but the
Son abides for ever. Wherein he intimates two great truths, viz. that the
servants and slaves of sin may for a time enjoy the external privileges of the
house or Church of God; but it would not be long before the master of the house
will turn them out of door: but if they were once the adopted Children of God,
then they should abide in the house for ever. And this privilege is only to be
had by their believing in, and union with the natural Son of God, Jesus Christ:
which brings us fairly to the Text; If the Son therefore shall make you free,
ye shall be free indeed.

In which words we have two parts.

viz. 1. A Supposition. 2. A Concession.

First, A Supposition, if the Son therefore shall make you free, 1.
q. d. The womb of nature cast you forth into the world in a state of bondage,
in that state you have lived all your days, servants to sin, slaves to your
lusts, yet freedom is to be obtained: and this freedom is the prerogative
belonging to the Son of God to bestow: if the Son shall make you free.

Secondly, Christ's Concession upon this supposition, then 2.
shall ye be free indeed, (i. e.) you shall have a real freedom, an excellent
and everlasting fredom: no conceit only, as that which you now boast of is: if
ever therefore you will be free men indeed, believe in me. Hence note,

DOCT.
That interest in Christ sets the soul at liberty from all that Doct.
bondage whereunto it was subjected in its natural state.

Believers are the Children of the New Covenant, the denizons of Jerusalem
which are above, which is free and the mother of them all, Gal. 4. 26. the
glorious liberty, viz. that which is spiritual and eternal, is the liberty of
the Children of God, Romans 8. 21. Christ, and none but Christ delivers his
people out of the hands of their enemies, Luke 1. 74.

In the Doctrinal part of this point, I must show you

First, What Believers are not freed from by Jesus Christ in this world.
Secondly, What that bondage is from which every Believer is freed by Christ.
Thirdly, What kind of freedom that is which comes in upon believing. Fourthly,
Open the excellency of this state of spiritual freedom.
First, What those things are from which Believers are 1.
not made free in this world? we must not think that our spiritual liberty by
Christ presently brings us into an absolute liberty in all respects. For,

First, Christ does not free Believers from obedience to the moral Law: It Is
true we are no more under it as a Covenant for our justification; but we are,
and must still be under it as a rule for our direction. The matter of the moral
law is unchangeable as the nature of good and evil is, and cannot be abolished
except that distinction could be destroyed, Mat. 5. 17, 18. The precepts of the
Law are still urged under the Gospel to enforce duties upon us, Ephesians. 6. 12.
It Is therefore a vain distinction invented by Libertines to say it binds us as
Creatures not as Christians: or that it binds the unregenerate part, but not
the regenerate: but this is a sure truth, that they who are freed from its
penalties, are still under its precepts: though Believers are no more under its
curse, yet they are still under its conduct: the Law sends us to Christ to be
justified, and Christ sends us to the Law to be regulated. Let the heart of
every Christian join therefore with David's in that holy wish, Psalm. 119. 4, 5.
Thou have commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently, O that my heart were
directed to keep thy Statutes. It Is excellent when Christians begin to obey the
Law from life, which others obey for life: because they are justified, not that
they may be justified. When duties are done in the strength and for the honor
of Christ, which is Evangelical; not in our own strength and for our own ends,
which is servile and legal obedience: had Christ freed us from obedience, such
a liberty had been to our loss.

Secondly, Christ has not freed Believers in this world from the temptations
and assaults of Satan: even those that are freed from his dominion, are not
free from his molestation. It Is said indeed, Romans 16. 20. God shall shortly
bruise Satan under your feet: but mean time he has power to bruise and buffet
us by his injections, 2 Cor. 12. 7. he now bruiseth Christ's heel, Genesis 3. 15.
(i. e.) bruiseth him in his tempted and afflicted members: though he cannot
kill them, yet he can and does afflict and fright them, by shooting his fiery
darts of temptation among them, Ephesians. 6. 16. It Is true, when the Saints are got
safe into Heaven, they are out of Gunshot; there is perfect freedom from all
temptation. A Believer may then say, O thou enemy, temptations are come to a
perpetual end. I am now arrived there, where none of thy fiery darts can reach
me: but this freedom is not yet.

Thirdly, Christ has not yet freed Believers in this world from the motions of
indwelling sin: these are continually acting and infesting the holiest of men,
Romans 7. 21, 23, 24. Corruptions like Canaanites are still left in the Land to
be thorns in our eyes, and goads in our sides. Those that boast most of freedom
from the motions of sin, have most cause to suspect themselves still under the
dominion of sin. All Christ's freemen are troubled with the same complaint: who
among them complains not as the Apostle did, Romans 7. 24. Oh wretched man that I
am, who shall deliever me from the body of this death?

Fourthly, Jesus Christ does not free Believers in this world from inward
troubles and exercises of soul upon the account of sin. God may let loose Satan
and Conscience too, in the way of terrible accusations, which may greatly
distress the soul of a Believer, and woefully eclipse the light of Gods
Countenance, and break the peace of their souls. Job, Heman and David were all
made free by Christ, yet each of them has left upon record his bitter
complaint upon this account, Job 7. 19, 20. Psalm. 88. 14, 15, 16. Psalm. 38.
unto verse. 11.

Fifthly, Christ has not freed Believers in this world from the rods of
affliction. God in giving us our liberty does not abridge his own liberty,
Psalm. 89. 32. all the Children of God are made free, yet what Son is there whom
the Father chastneth not? Heb. 12. 8. Exemption from affliction is so far from
being the mark of a Freeman, that the Apostle there makes it the mark of a
slave. Bastards, not Sons want the discipline and blessing of the Rod: to be
freed from affliction would be no benefit to Believers, who receive so many
benefits by affliction.

Sixthly, No Believer is freed by Christ from the stroke of death, though they
are all freed from the sting of death, Romans 8. 10. The bodies of Believers are
under the same Law of mortality with other men, Heb. 9. 27. we must come to the
Grave as well as others: yea, we must come to it through the same agonies,
pangs and dolours that other men do: the foot of death treads as heavy upon the
bodies of the redeemed as of other men. Believers indeed are distinguished by
mercy from others, but the distinguishing mercy lies not here. Thus you see
what Believers are not freed from in this world: if you shall now say, what
advantage then has a Believer, or what profit is there in regeneration? I
Answer,

Secondly, That Believers are freed from many great and 2.
sad miseries and evils by Jesus Christ notwithstanding all that has been
said. For,

First, All Believers are freed from the rigor and curse of the Law: the
rigorous yoke of the Law is broken off from their necks, and the sweet and
easy yoke of Jesus Christ put on, Mat. 11. 28. The Law required perfect
working under the pain of a curse, Gal. 3. 10. accepted of no short endeavors;
admitted no repentance; gave no strength: it is not so now, proportionable
strength is given, Phil 4. 13. Sincerity is reckoned perfection, Job 1. 1.
Transgression brings not under condemnation, Romans 8. 1. O blessed freedom! when
duty becomes delight, and failings hinder not acceptance: this is one part of
the blessed freedom of believers.

Secondly, All Believers are freed from the guilt of sin, it may trouble, but
it cannot condemn them, Romans 8. 33. The hand writing which was against us is
cancelled by Christ, nailed to his Cross, Colos. 2. 14. When the seal and
handwriting is torn off from the Bond, the Debtor is made free thereby:
Believers are totally freed, Acts 13. 39. Justified from all things: and
finally freed, John 5. 24. They shall never come into condemnation. O blessed
freedom! How sweet is it to lie down in our beds, yea in our graves; when guilt
shall neither be our Bed fellow, nor Grave fellow!

Thirdly, Christ frees all Believers from the dominion as well as the guilt of
sin. Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law, but
under Grace, Romans 6. 14. The law of the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus
has made me free from the law of sin and death, Romans 8. 2. Now who can
estimate such a liberty as this? What slavery, what an intolerable drudgery is
the service of diverse lusts from all which Believers are freed by Christ: not
from the residence but from the reign of sin. It Is with sin in Believers as it
was with those beasts mentioned Dan. 7. 12. They had their dominion taken away,
yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.

Fourthly, Jesus Christ sets all Believers free from the power of Satan; in
whose right they were by nature, Col. 1. 13. they are translated from the power
of darkness into the Kingdom of Christ. Satan had the possession of them, as a
man of his own goods; but Christ dispossesseth that strong man armed, alters
the property, and recovers them out of his hand, Luke 11. 21, 22. There are two
ways by which Christ frees Believers out of Satan's power and possession, namely,

1. By Price. 2. By Power.
First, By Price, the blood of Christ purchases Believers out of the hand of
justice by satisfying the law for them, which being done, Satan's authority over
them falls of course, as the power of a Jailer over the Prisoner does, when he
has a legal discharge, Heb. 2. 14. For as much then as the Children are
partakers of flesh and blood: he also himself took part of the same, that
through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the
Devil. The cruel Tyrant beats and burdens the poor captive no more after the
ransom is once paid, and he actually freed, and therefore Christ delivers his,

Secondly, By power. Satan is exceeding unwilling to let go his prey: he is a
strong and a malicious enemy: every rescue and deliverance out of his hand, is
a glorious effect of the almighty power of Christ, Act. 26. 18. 2 Cor. 10. 5.
How did our Lord Jesus Christ grapple with Satan at his death, and triumphed
over him, Col. 2. 15. O glorious salvation, blessed liberty of the Children of
God!

Fifthly, Christ frees Believers from the poisonous sting and hurt of death:
kill us it can, but hurt us it cannot, 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56. O death where is thy
sting? O grave where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the
strength of sin is the Law: but thanks be to God which gives us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ. If there be no hurt, there should be no horror
in death: it is guilt that arms death both with its hurting and terrifying
power. To dye in our sins, John 8. 24. To have our bones full of the sins of
our youth, which shall lie down with us in the dust, Job 20. 11. To have death,
like a Dragon, pulling a poor guilty Creature as a prey into its dreadful Den,
Psalm. 49. 14. In this lies the danger and horror of death: but from death as a
curse, and from the grave as a Prison, Christ has set Believers at liberty, by
submitting to death in their room, by his victorious resurrection from the
grave, as the firstborn of the dead: death is disarmed of its hurting power:
the death of Believers is but a sleep in Jesus.

Thirdly, The next thing to be briefly spoken to, is the 3.
kind and nature of that freedom and liberty purchased and procured by Christ
for Believers.

Now liberty may be considered two ways.

viz. 1. As Civil. 2. As Sacred.

As to civil freedom or liberty, it belongs not to our present business:
Believers as to their civil capacity are not freed from the duties they owe to
their Superiors. Servants, though Believers, are still to be subject to their
Masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, Ephesians. 6. 5. nor from
obedience to lawful Magistrates whom we are to obey in the Lord, Romans 13. 1, 4.
Religion dissolves not the bonds of civil relations: nor is it to be used as an
occasion to the flesh, 1 Pet. 2. 16. It Is not a carnal but a spiritual freedom
Christ has purchased for us: and this spiritual freedom is again to be
considered, either

as 1. Inchoate. 2. Consummate.

The liberty Believers have at present is but a beginning liberty, they are
freed but in part from their spiritual enemies: but it is a growing liberty
every day, and will be consummate, and complete at last.

To conclude, Christian Liberty is,

either 1. Privative, or, 2. Positive.

The liberty Believers are invested with, is of both kinds: they are not only
freed from many miseries, burdens and dangers; but also invested by Jesus
Christ with many royal privileges and invaluable immunities.

Fourthly, And this brings us to the fourth and last thing; 4.
namely the properties of this blessed freedom which the Saints enjoy by Jesus
Christ: and if we consider it duly it will be found to be,

First, A wonderful liberty, never enough to be admired: how could it be
imagined that ever those who owed unto God more than ever they could pay by
their own eternal sufferings, those that were under the dreadful curse and
condemnation of the Law, in the power and possession of Satan the strong man
armed; those that were bound with so many chains in their spiritual prison;
their understanding bound with ignorance, their wills with obstinacy, their
hearts with impenetrable hardness, their affections with a thousand bewitching
vanities; that slight their state of slavery so much as industriously to oppose
all instruments and means of deliverance: For such persons to be set at
liberty, notwithstanding all this, is the wonder of wonders, and is deservedly
mavelous in the eyes of Believers for ever.

Secondly, The freedom of Believers is a peculiar freedom: a liberty which few
obtain, the generality abiding still in bondage to Satan, who from the
multitude of his Subjects is styled the god of this world, 2 Cor. 4. 4.
Believers in Scripture are often called a remnant, which is but a small part of
the whole piece: the more cause have the people of God to admire distinguishing
mercy: how many Nobles and great ones of the world are but royal slaves to
Satan and their own lusts!

Thirdly, The liberty of Believers is a liberty dearly purchased by the blood
of Christ: what that Captain said, Acts 22. 28. With a great sum obtained I
this freedom, may be much more said of the Believers freedom: 'twas not Silver
or Gold but the precious blood of Christ that purchased it, 1 Pet. 1. 18.

Fourthly, The freedom and liberty of Believers is a growing and increasing
liberty, they get more and more out of the power of sin, and nearer still to
their complete salvation every day, Romans 13. 11. the body of sin dies daily in
them: they are said to be crucified with Christ: the strength of sin abates
continually in them after the manner of crucified persons: who dye a slow but
sure death: and look in what degree the power of sin abates, proportionably
their spiritual liberty increases upon them.

Fifthly, The freedom of Believers is a comfortable freedom: the Apostle
comforts Christians of the lowest rank, poor servants, with this consideration,
1 Cor. 7. 22. He that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lords
freeman, q. d. Let not the meanness of your outward condition, which is a state
of subjection and dependence, a state of poverty and contempt, at all trouble
you: you are the Lords freemen, of precious account in his eyes. O it is a
comfortable liberty!

Sixthly, and Lastly, It Is a perpetual and final freedom, they that are once
freed by Christ have their manumissions and final discharge from that state of
bondage they were in before. Sin shall never have dominion over them any more:
it may tempt them and trouble them, but shall never more rule and govern them,
Acts 26. 18. And thus you see what a glorious liberty the liberty of Believers
is.

The improvement whereof will be in the following Inferences.

Inference 1.
How rational is the joy of Christians, above the joy of all Inference 1.
others in the world? shall not the captive rejoice in his recovered liberty?
The very Birds of the air (as one observes) had rather be at liberty in the
woods, though lean and hungry, than in a golden Cage with the richest fare:
every creature naturally prises it, none more than Believers, who have felt the
burden and bondage of corruption: who in the days of their first illumination
and conviction have poured out many groans and tears for this mercy. What was
said of the captive people of God in Babylon, excellently shadows forth the
state of Gods people under spiritual bondage, with the way and manner of their
deliverance from it, Zech. 9. 11. By the blood of thy Covenant I have sent
forth thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water. Believers are
delivered by the blood of Christ out of a worse pit than that of Babylon: and
look as the Tribes in their return from thence were overwhelmed with joy and
astonishment, Psalm. 126. 1, 2. When the Lord turned again the captivity of
Sion; we were like them that dream, then was our mouth filled with laughter,
and our tongue with singing: they were overwhelmed with the sense of the mercy:
so should it be with the people of God. It Is said, Luke 15. 24. when the
Prodigal Son (there made the emblem of a returning converting sinner) was
returned again to his Fathers house; that there was heard music and dancing,
mirth and feasting in that house. The Angels in Heaven rejoice when a soul is
recovered out of the power of Satan: and shall not the recovered soul,
immediately concerned in the mercy, greatly rejoice? Yea, let them rejoice in
the Lord, and let no earthly trouble or affliction ever have power to interrupt
their joy for a moment after such a deliverance as this.

Inference 2.
How unreasonable, and wholly inexcusable is the sin of Apostasy from Jesus
Christ? What is it but for a delivered captive Inference 2.
to put his feet again into the shackles, his hands into the manacles, his neck
into the iron yoke, from which he has been delivered? It Is said, Mat. 12. 44,
45. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry
places, seeking rest and finds none: then he says, I will return into mine
house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept
and garnished; then goes he, and takes with him seven other Spirits more
wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of
that man is worse than the first. Even as a Prisoner that has escaped, and is
again recovered, is loaded with double irons. Let the people of God be content
to run any hazard, endure any difficulties in the way of Religion, rather than
return again into their former bondage, to sin and Satan. O Christian, if ever
God gave thee a sight, and a sense of the misery and danger of thy natural
state, if ever thou have felt the pangs and throes of a laboring and
distressed Conscience, and after all this tasted the unspeakable sweetness of
the peace and rest that is in Christ, thou will rather choose to dye ten
thousand deaths than to forsake Christ, and go back again into that sad
condition.

Inference 3.
How suitable and well-becoming is a free spirit in Believers to Inference 3.
their state of liberty and freedom? Christ has made your condition free. O
let the temper and frame of your hearts be free also, do all that you do for
God with a spirit of freedom: not by constraint but willingly. Methinks,
Christians, the new nature that is in you should stand for a command, and be
instead of all arguments that use to work upon the hopes and fears of other
men: See how all creatures work according to the principle of their natures:
you need not command a Mother to draw forth her breasts to a sucking Child:
nature it self teaches and prompts to that: you need not bid the Sea ebb or
flow at the stated hours. O Christian, why should thy heart need any other
argument than its own spiritual inclination to keep its stated times and
seasons of communion with God? Let none of Gods commandments be grievous to
you: let not thine heart need dragging and forcing to its own benefit and
advantage. Whatever you do for God do it cheerfully, and whatever you suffer
for God suffer it cheerfully: it was a brave spirit which acted holy Paul, I am
ready, says he, not only to be bound, but also to dye at Jerusalem for the
name of the Lord Jesus, Acts 21. 13.

Inference 4.
Let no man wonder at the enmity and opposition of Satan to the Inference 4.
preaching of the Gospel: For by the Gospel it is that souls are recovered out
of his power, Acts 26. 18. it is the express work of Ministers to turn men from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Satan (as one faith)
is a great and jealous Prince: he will never endure to have liberty proclaimed
by the Ministers of Christ within his dominions: and indeed what is it less
when the Gospel is preached in power, but as it were by beat of Drum and sound
of Trumpet to proclaim liberty, liberty, spiritual sweet and everlasting
liberty, to every soul that is made sensible of the bondage of corruption and
cruel servitude of Satan, and will now come over to Jesus Christ? and oh what
numbers and multitudes of prisoners have broken loose from Satan at one
proclamation of Christ's, Acts 2. 41. but Satan owes the servants of Christ a
spite for this, and will be sure to pay them if ever they come within his
reach: persecution is the Genius of the Gospel, and follows it as the shadow
does the body.

Inference 5.
How careful should Christians be to maintain their spiritual liberty Inference
5.
in all, and every point thereof? Stand fast (says Paul) in the liberty
wherewith Christ has made us free; and be not again entangled in the yoke of
bondage, Gal. 5. 1. and again, Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the
servants of men. It Is Christ's prerogative to prescribe the rules of his own
house; he has given no man dominion over your faith, 2 Cor. 1. 24, one man is
no rule to another, but the word of Christ a rule to all: follow not the
holiest of men one step farther than they follow Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 4. Man is
an ambitious creature, naturally affecting dominion: and dominion over the mind
rather than over the body: to give law to others feeds pride in himself: so far
as any man brings the word of Christ to warrant his injunctions, so far we are
to obey, and no farther: Christ is your Lord and Lawgiver.

Inference 6.
Lastly, Let this encourage and persuade sinners to come to Inference 6.
Christ, for with him is sweet liberty for poor captives. Oh that you did but
know what a blessed state Jesus Christ would bring you into: Come unto me
(says he) ye that labor, and are heavy laden; and what encouragement does he
give to comers but this, my yoke is easy, and my burden is light? The Devil
persuaded you that the ways of obedience and strict godliness are a perfect
bondage; but if ever God regenerate you, you will find his ways, ways of
pleasantness, and all his paths peace: you will rejoice in the way of his
Commandments as much as in all riches: you will find the worst work Christ puts
you about even suffering work, sweeter than all the pleasures that ever you
found in sin. O therefore open your hearts at the call of the Gospel: come unto
Christ, then shall you be free indeed.

The Nineteenth SERMON. Sermon 19.

1 PET. 3. 18. Text. The Saints coming home to God by Reconciliation and
Glorification, opened and applied.
For Christ has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust; that he might
bring us to God.
THe scope of the Apostle in this place is to prepare and fortify Christians
for a day of suffering. In order to their cheerful sustaining whereof he
prescribes two excellent rules of mighty use for all suffering Christians.

First, To get a good Conscience within them, verse. 16, 17. hic murus aheneus
esto.

Secondly, To set the example of Christ's suffering before them, verse. 18. for
Christ has once suffered for sinners: the sufferings of Christ for us, is the
great motive engaging Christians to suffer cheerfully for him.

In the words before us we have,

First, The sufficiency and fullness of Christ's sufferings intimated in that
particle [once] Christ needs to suffer no more, having finished and completed
that whole work at once.

Secondly, The meritorious cause of the sufferings of Christ, and that is sin,
Christ once suffered for sins: not his own sins, but ours: as it follows in the
next clause, which is the third thing here observable, viz.

Thirdly, The admirable grace and unexampled love of Christ to us sinners, the
just for the unjust, in which words the substitution of Christ in the room and
place of sinners, the vice-gerence of his death is plainly expressed. Christ
died not only nostro bono, for our good, but also nostro loco in our stead.

Fourthly, Here is also the final cause or design and scope of the sufferings
of Christ, which was to bring us to God.

Fifthly, Here is also the issue of the sufferings of Christ, which was the
death of Christ in the flesh, and the quickening of Christ after death by the
Spirit: many excellent observations are lodged in the bosom of this Scripture:
all which I must pass in silence at this time, and confine my discourse to the
final cause of the sufferings of Christ, namely that he might bring us to God:
where the observation will be plainly and briefly this.

DOCT.
That the end of Christ's cursed death and bitter sufferings was Doct.
to bring all those for whom he died unto God.

In the explication and preparation of this point for use two things must be
spoken unto.

viz. 1. What Christ's bringing us to God imports. 2. What influence the death
of Christ has upon this design of bringing us to God.

First, What Christ's bringing us to God imports: and certainly 1.)
there be many great and excellent things carried in this expression: more
generally it notes our state of reconciliation and our state of glorification:
by reconciliation we are brought nigh to God, Ephesians. 2. 13. Ye are made nigh,
(i. e:) reconciled, by the blood of Christ. Heb. 12. 22, 23. we are said to
come to God the Judge of all. By reconciliation we are brought nigh unto God
now; by glorification we shall be brought home to God hereafter, 1 These. 4. 17.
We shall be ever with the Lord: but more particularly this phrase, that he
might brings us to God, imports,

First, That the chief happiness of man consists in the (1.)
enjoyment of God: that the creature has as necessary dependence upon God for
happiness, as the stream has upon the fountain, or the image in the glass upon
the face of him that looks into it. Look as the sum of the creatures misery
lies in this, depart from me; separation from God is the principal part of
damnation: So on the contrary, the chief happiness of the creature consists
in the enjoyment and blessed vision of God, 1 John 3. 2. Psalm. 17. 15. I shall
be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.

Secondly, It implies man's revolt and apostasy from God, (2.)
Ephesians. 2. 12. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who were sometime afar Li^t facult
ates non ^runt per lapsum abolitae, determinatio tamen earum ad objecta
spiritualia fuit protinus extincta. Zeae^. de imagine Dei.
off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. Those whom Christ brings unto God
were before afar off from him, both in state and condition; and in temper and
disposition: we were lost creatures, and had no desire to return to God: the
Prodigal was said to go into a far Country, Luke 15. 30.

Thirdly, Christ's bringing us to God implies our inability to return to God of
our selves: we must be brought back by Christ, or perish for ever in a state of
separation from God: the lost sheep is made the emblem of the lost sinner, (3.)
Luke 15. 5. The sheep returns not to the fold of it self, but the shepherd
seeks it, finds it, and carries it back upon his shoulders: and the Apostle
plainly tells us, Romans 5. 6. that when we were without strength (i. e.) any
ability to recover, help or save our selves; in due time Christ died for the
ungodly.

Fourthly, Christ's bringing us to God evidently implies (4.)
this, that Gods unsatisfied justice was once the great bar betwixt him and
man: man can have no access to God but by Christ: Christ brings us to God by no
other way but the way of satisfaction by his blood: he has suffered for sins,
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Better ten thousand
worlds should perish for ever, than God should lose the honor of his justice.
This great Obex, or bar to our enjoyment of God is effectually removed by the
death of Christ: whereby it is not only fully satisfied, but highly honored
and glorified, Romans 3. 24. and so the way by which we are brought to God is
again opened (to the wonder and joy of all Believers) by the blood and
sufferings of Christ.

Fifthly, and lastly, It shows us the peculiar happiness and (5.)
privilege of Believers above all people in the world. These only are they
which shall be brought to God by Jesus Christ in a reconciled state: others
indeed shall be brought to God as a Judge, to be condemned by him: Believers
only are brought to God in the Mediators hand, as a reconciled Father to be
made blessed for ever in the enjoyment of him: every Believer is brought singly
to God at his death, Luke 16. 22. and all Believers shall be jointly and
solemnly presented to God in the great day, Col. 1. 22. Jude v. 24. They shall
be all presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.
Now the privilege of Believers in that day will lie in diverse things.

First, That they shall be all brought to God together: this will be the
general assembly mentioned, Heb. 12. 22. there shall be a collection of all
Believers in all ages of the world into one blessed assembly: they shall come
from the East, and West, and North, and South, and shall sit down in the
Kingdom of God, Luke 13. 29. O what a glorious train will be seen following the
redeemer in that day!

Secondly, As all the Saints shall be collected into one body: so they shall be
all brought or presented unto God, faultless and without blemish, Jude v. 24. A
glorious Church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, Ephesians. 5. 27. For
this is the general assembly of the spirits of just men that are made perfect,
Heb. 12. 23. All sin was perfectly separated from them, when death had
separated their souls and bodies.

Thirdly, In this lies the privilege of Believers, that as they shall be all
brought together, and that in a state of absolute purity and perfection, so
they shall be all brought to God: they shall see his face, in the vision
whereof is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore,
Psalm. 16 11. The objective blessedness of the Saints consists in their
fruition of God, Psalm. 73. 25. To see God in his word and works, is the
happiness of the Saints on earth, but to see him face to face will be the
fullness of their blessedness in Heaven, 1 John 3. 2. This is that intuitive,
transforming and satisfying vision of which the Scripture frequently speaks,
Psalm. 17. 15. 2 Cor. 15. 28. Rev. 7. 17.

Fourthly, to be brought unto God, must needs imply a state of perfect joy and
highest delight: so speaks the Apostle Jude v. 14. Christ shall present or
bring them to God with exceeding joy: and more fully the joy of this day is
expressed, Psalm. 45. 15. With joy and rejoicing shall they be brought, they
shall enter into the Kings Palace: it will be a day of universal joy, when all
the Saints are brought home to God in a perfected state. For,

1. God the Father will rejoice when Christ brings home that precious number of
his elect, whom he redeemed by his blood: he rejoices in them now though
imperfect, and under many distastful corruptions and weaknesses, Zeph. 3. 17.
How much more will he rejoice in them when Christ presents them without spot or
wrinkle to him, Ephesians. 5. 27.

2. Jesus Christ will exceedingly rejoice, 'twill be the day of the gladness
and satisfaction of his heart: for now, and not till now he receives his
mystical fullness, Col. 1. 24. beholds all the blessed issues of his death,
which cannot but give him unspeakable contentment, Isai. 53. 11. He shall see
of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.

3. The day in which Believers are brought home to God, will be a day of
unspeakable joy to the holy Spirit of God himself. For unto this all his
sanctifying designs in this world had respect: to this day he sealed them:
after this day he stirred up desires and groanings that cannot be uttered in
their hearts, Ephesians. 4. 30. Romans 8. 26. Thus all the great and blessed persons,
Father, Son and Spirit, will rejoice in the bringing home of the elect to God.
For as it is the greatest joy to a man to see the designs which his heart has
been long projecting and intently set upon, by an orderly conduct, at last
brought to the happy issue he first aimed at; much more will it be so here: the
counsel and hand of each person being deeply concerned in this blessed design.

4. The Angels of God will rejoice at the bringing home of Believers to him:
the spirits of just men made perfect will be united in one general assembly
with an innumerable company of Angels, Heb. 2. 22. Great is the affection and
love of Angels to redeemed ones: they greatly rejoiced at the incarnation of
Christ for them, Luke 2. 13. They greatly delighted to pry into the mystery of
their redemption, 1 Pet. 1. 12. They were marvellously delighted at their
conversion which was the day of their espousals to Christ, Luke 15. 10. They
have been tender and careful over them, and very serviceable to them in this
world, Heb. 1. 14. and therefore cannot but rejoice exceedingly to see them all
brought home in safety to their Fathers house.

5. To Conclude, Christ's bringing home of all Believers unto God, will be
matter of unspeakable joy to themselves. For whatever knowledge and
acquaintance they had with God here, whatever sights of faith they had of
Heaven and the glory to come in this world; yet the sight of God and Christ the
Redeemer will be an unspeakable surprise to them in that day. This will be the
day of relieving all their wants; the day of satisfaction to all their desires:
for now they are come where they would be; arrived at the very desires of their
souls.

Secondly, In the last place, let it be considered what influence the death of
Christ has upon this design, and you 2.
shall find it much every way. In two things especially the death of Christ
has a blessed causality and influence in this matter,

viz. 1. It effectually removes all obstacles to it. 2. It purchases (as a
price) their title to it.

First, The death of Christ removes all obstacles out of the way of this mercy:
such were the bars hindering our access to God, as nothing but the death of
Christ could remove and open a way for Believers to come to God. The guilt of
sin barred us from his gracious presence, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3. Hosea 14. 2. The
filth of sin excluded us from God, Hab. 1. 13. Heb. 12. 14. The enmity of our
nature perfectly stopped up our way to God, Col. 1. 21. Romans 8. 7. by reason
hereof fallen man has no desire to come unto God, Job 21. 14. The Justice of
God like a flaming Sword turning every way, kept all men from access to God:
and lastly, Satan that malicious and armed adversary lay as a Lion in the way
to God, 2 Pet. 5. 8. Oh with what strong bars were the gates of Heaven shut
against our souls! The way to God was chained up with such difficulties as none
but Christ was able to remove; and he by death has effectually removed them
all: the way is now open, even the new and the living way, consecrated for us
by his blood. The death of Christ effectually removes the guilt of sin, 1 Pet.
2. 24. washes off the filth of sin, 1 John 5. 6. takes away the enmity of
nature, Col. 1. 20, 21. satisfied all the demands of justice, Romans 3. 25, 26.
has broken all the power of Satan, Col. 2. 15. Heb. 2. 14. and consequently
the way to God is effectually and fully opened to Believers by the blood of
Jesus, Heb. 10. 20.

Secondly, The blood of Christ purchases for Believers their right and title
to this privilege, Gal. 4. 4, 5. But when the fullness of time was come, God
sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law: to redeem them that
were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons, (i. e.) both
the relation and inheritance of sons. There was value and worth enough in the
precious blood of Christ, not only to pay all our debts to justice, but over
and above the payment of our debts to purchase for us this invaluable
privilege. We must put this unspeakable mercy of being brought to God, as my
Text puts it, upon the account and score of the death of Christ. No Believer
had ever tasted the sweetness of such a mercy, if Christ had not tasted the
bitterness of death for him. The use of all you will have in the following
Deductions of truth.

Deduction 1.
Great is the preciousness and worth of souls, that the life of Christ should
be given to redeem and recover them to God: As God laid out his thoughts and
counsel from eternity upon them to project the way and method of their
salvation: so the Lord Jesus in pursuance of that blessed design, came from the
bosom of the Father, and spilt his invaluable blood to bring them to God. No
wise man expends vast sums to bring home trifling commodities. How cheap soever
our souls are in our estimation, it is evident by this they are of precious
esteem in the eyes of Christ.

Deduction 2.
Redeemed souls must expect no rest or satisfaction on this side Heaven, and
the full enjoyment of God: the life of a Believer in this world is a life of
motion and expectation: they are now coming to God, 1 Pet. 2. 4. God, you see,
is the center and rest of their souls, Heb. 4. 9. As the Rivers cannot rest
Fe^ti nos ad te, and inquietum est cor nostrum do^ec requiescat in te. Aug.
Confess. lib. 1. cap. 1.
till they pour themselves into the bosom of the Sea, so neither can renewed
souls find rest till they come into the bosom of God. There be four things
which do and will break the rest and disturb the souls of Believers in this
world; afflictions, temptations, corruptions, and absence from God: if the
three former causes of disquietness were totally removed, so that a Believer
were placed in such a condition upon earth where no affliction should disturb
him, no temptation trouble him, no corruption defile or grieve him: yet his
very absence from God must still keep him restless and unsatisfied, 2 Cor. 5.
6. Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.

Deduction 3.
What sweet and pleasant thoughts should all Believers have of death! When they
dye, and never till they dye shall they be fully brought home to God. Death to
the Saints is the door by which they enter into the enjoyment of God: the dying
Christian is almost at home, yet a few pangs and agonies more, and then he is
come to God in whose presence is the fullness of joy. I desire, says Paul, to
depart and to be with Christ, which is far better, Phil. 1. 23. It should not
scare us to be brought to death, the King of terrors, so long as it is the
office of death to bring us to God. That dreaming opinion of the soul sleeping
after death is as ungrounded as it is uncomfortable: the same day we loose from
this shore, we shall be landed upon the blessed shore, where we shall see and
enjoy God for ever. O if the friends of dead Believers did but understand
where, and with whom their souls are, whilst they are mourning over their
bodies: certainly a few believing thoughts of this would quickly dry up their
tears, and fill the house of mourning with voices of praise and thanksgiving.

Deduction 4.
How comfortable and sweet should the converses and communication of Christians
be with one another in this world! Christ is bringing them all to God through
this vale of tears, they are now in the way to him, all bound for Heaven, going
home to God to their everlasting rest in glory: every day, every hour, every
duty brings them nearer and nearer to their journeys end, Romans 13. 11. Now,
says the Apostle, is our salvation nearer than when we believed. O what manner
of heavenly communications and ravishing discourses should Believers have with
each other as they walk by the way! O what pleasant and delightful stories
should they tell one another about the place and state whither Christ is
bringing them, and where they shall shortly be* What ravishing, transporting,
transforming visions they shall have that day they are brought home to God: how
surprizingly glorious the sight of Jesus Christ will be to them, who died for
them to bring them unto God. How should such discourses as these shorten and
sweeten their passage through this world; strengthen and encourage the dejected
and feeble minded, and exceedingly honor and adorn their profession! Thus
lived the Believers of old, Heb. 11. 9, 10. By faith he sojourned in the land
of promise, as in a strange Country, dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac, and
Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise, for he looked for a City which
has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. But alas, most Christians are
either entangled in the cares and troubles, or so ensnared by the delights and
plasures, which almost continually divert and take up their thoughts by the
way, that there is but little room for any discourses of Christ and Heaven
among many of them: but certainly this would be as much your interest as your
duty. When the Apostle had entertained the Thessalonians with a lovely
discourse of their meeting the Lord in the air, and being ever with the Lord,
he charges it upon them as their great duty to comfort one another with those
words, 1 These. 4. 17, 18.

Deduction 5.
How unreasonable are the dejections of Believers upon the account of those
troubles which they meet with in this world! It Is true, afflictions of all
kinds do attend Believers in their way to God; through many tribulations we
must enter into that Kingdom: but what then? Must we despond and droop under
them as other men? Surely no, if afflictions be the way through which you must
come to God, then never be discouraged at affliction. Troubles and afflictions
are of excellent use under the blessing of the Spirit to further Christ's great
design of bringing you to God. How often would you turn out of that way which
leads to God, if God did not hedge up your way with thorns, Hosea 2. 6.
Doubtless when you come home to God, you shall find you have been as much
beholding (it may be a great deal more) to your troubles than to your comforts,
for bringing you thither: however the sweetness of the end will infinitely more
than recompense the sorrows and troubles of the way: nor are they worthy to be
compared with the glory that shall be revealed in you, Romans 8. 18.

Deduction 6.
How much are all Believers obliged in point of interest to follow Jesus Christ
whithersoever he goes! Thus are the Saints described, Rev. 14. 4. These are
they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes: these were redeemed from
among men being the first fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. If it be the design
of Christ to bring us to God, then certainly it is our duty to follow Christ in
all the paths of active and passive obedience through which he now leads us, as
ever we expect to be brought home to God at last: We are made partakers of
Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end, Heb.
3. 14. If we have followed him through many sufferings and troubles, and shall
turn away from him at last, we lose all that we have wrought and suffered in
Religion, and shall never reach home to God at last: the Crown of life belongs
only to them who are faithful to the death.

Deduction 7.
Let all that desire or expect to come unto God hereafter, come to Christ by
faith now. There is no other way to the Father but by Christ: no other way to
Christ but faith: how vain therefore are the hopes and expectations of all
unbelievers? Be assured of this great truth, Death shall bring you to God as an
avenging Judge, if Christ do not bring you now to God as a reconciled Father:
without holiness no man shall see God: the door of hope is shut against all
Christless persons, John 14. 6. No man comes unto the Father but by me. Oh
what a sweet voice comes down from Heaven to your souls this day, saying, As
ever you expect or hope to come to God and enjoy the blessedness that is here,
come unto Christ, obey his calls, give up your selves to his conduct and
government, and you shall certainly be brought to God: as sure as you shall now
be brought to Jesus Christ by spiritual union, so sure shall you be brought to
God in full fruition.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ, the new and living way to the Father.
ANd thus I have finished the Motives drawn from the titles and benefits of
Christ, serving to enforce and quicken the great Gospel-exhortation of coming
to, and effectually applying the Lord Jesus Christ in the way of faith. O that
the blessings of the Spirit might follow these Calls, and fix these
Considerations as Nails in sure places. But seeing the great hindrance and
obstruction to faith is the false opinion and persuasion of most unregenerate
men, that they are already in Christ; My next work therefore shall be in a
second Use of Conviction to undeceive men in that matter; and that by showing
them the undoubted certainty of these two things:

First, That there is no coming ordinarily to Christ without the Applications
of the Law to our Consciences in a way of effectual Conviction.

Secondly, Nor by that neither without the teachings of God, in the way of
spiritual illumination. The first of these will be fully confirmed and opened in

The Twentieth SERMON. Sermon 20.

Romans 7. 9. Text. The great usefulness of the Law or Word of God, in order to
the application of Christ.
For I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, sin
revived, and I died.
THe scope of the Apostle in this Epistle, and more particularly in this
Chapter, is to state the due use and excellency of the Law, which he does
accordingly,

First, By denying to it, power to justify us, which is the peculiar honor of
Christ.

Secondly, By ascribing to it a power to convince us, and so prepare us for
Christ.

Neither attributing to it more honor than belongs to it, nor yet detracting
from it that honor and usefulness which God has given it. It cannot make us
righteous; but it can convince us that we are unrighteous; it cannot heal, but
it can open and discover the wounds that sin has given us: which he proves in
this place by an argument drawn from his own experience, confirmed also by the
general experience of Believers, in whose persons and names we must here
understand him to speak; For I was alive without the Law once, but when the
Commandment came, sin revived, and I died: wherein three particulars are very
observable.

First, The opinion Paul had, and all unregenerate men have of themselves
before Conversion: I was alive once: by 1.
life understand here liveliness, cheerfulness, and confidence of his good
estate and condition: he was full of vain hope, false joy and presumptuous
confidence, a very brisk and jovial man.

Secondly, The sense and opinion he had, and all others will have of
themselves, if ever they come under the regenerating 2.
work of the Spirit in his ordinary method of working: I died. The death he
here speaks of, stands opposed to that life before mentioned; and signifies the
sorrows, fears and tremblings that seized upon his soul, when his state and
temper were upon the change: the apprehensions he then had of his condition
struck him home to the heart and damped all his carnal mirth: I died.

Thirdly, The ground and reason of this wonderful alteration and change of his
judgment, and apprehension of 3.
his own condition; the Commandment came, and sin revived; the Commandment
came, (i. e.) it came home to my Conscience, it was set on with a divine and
mighty efficacy upon my heart: the Commandment was come before by way of
promulgation and the literal knowledge of it: but it never came till now in the
spiritual sense and convincing power to his soul: though he had often read and
heard the Law before, yet he never clearly understood the meaning and extent,
he never felt the mighty efficacy thereof upon his heart before; it so came at
this time, as it never came before.

From hence the observations are,

DOCT. 1.
That unregenerate persons are generally full of groundless confidence Doct. 1.
and cheerfulness, though their condition be sad and miserable.

DOCT. 2.
That there is a mighty efficacy in the Word or Law of God to Doct. 2.
kill vain confidence and quench carnal mirth in the hearts of men, when God
sets it home upon their Consciences.

We shall take both these points under consideration, and improve them to the
design in hand.

DOCT. 1.
That unregenerate persons are generally full of groundless confidence Doct. 1.
and cheerfulness, though their condition be sad and miserable. Rev. 3. 17.
Because thou say I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of
nothing; and know not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
blind, and naked: this is the very life that unregenerate men do live.

In the opening whereof I will show you,
1. What is the life of the unregenerate. 2. What maintains that life. 3. How
it appears that this is the life the generality of the world do live. 4. The
danger of living such a life as this: and then apply it.
First, What is the life of the unregenerate, and wherein it consists? Now
there being among others three things 1.
in which the life of the unregenerate does principally consist, viz. Carnal
Security, Presumptuous Hope, and False Joy:



Of these briefly in their order.

First, There is in unregenerate men a great deal of carnal security, they
dread no danger, Luke 11. 21. When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his
goods are in peace: there is generally a great stillness and silence in the
Consciences of such men: when others (in a better condition) are watching and
trembling, they sleep securely, so they live, and so oft-times they dye, Psalm.
73. 4. they have no bonds in their death; Hebrew, no knots, no difficulties
that puzzle them: it is true, the Consciences of few men are so perfectly
stupefied, but that sometime or other they twinge and gird them, but it seldom
works at that height, or continues with them so long as to give any
considerable interruption to their carnal peace and quietness.

Secondly, The life of the unregenerate consists in presumptuous hope: this
is the very foundation of their carnal security. So Christ tells the Jews, John
8. 54, 55. Of whom ye say that he is your God, and yet ye have not known him.
The world is full of hope without a promise, which is but as a Spiders web when
a stress comes to be laid upon it, Job 27. 8. Unregenerate men are said indeed
to be without hope, Ephesians. 2. 12. but the meaning is, they are without any solid
wellgrounded hope: for in Scripture account vain hope is no hope. Except it be
a lively hope, 1 Pet 1. 3. a hope flowing from union with Christ, Col. 1. 27. a
hope nourished by experience, Romans 5. 4. a hope for which a man can give a
reason, 1 Pet. 3. 15. a hope that puts men upon heart-purifying endeavors, 1
John 3. 3. it is in the account of God a cipher, a vanity, not deserving the
name of hope: and yet such a groundless, dead, Christless, irrational idle hope
is that which the unregenerate lives upon.

Thirdly, The life of the unregenerate consists in false joy, the immediate
off spring of ungrounded hope, Mat. 13. 20. the stony ground received the word
with joy.

There are two sorts of joy upon which the unregenerate live,

viz. 1. A sensitive joy in things Carnal. 2. A delusive joy in things
Spiritual.

They rejoice in Corn, Wine and Oil, in their Estates and Children, in the
pleasant fruitions of the Creature: yea, and they rejoice also in Christ and
the Promises, in Heaven and Glory: with all which they have just such a kind of
communion as a man has in a dream with a full feast and curious music, and
just so their joy will vanish when they awake. Now these three, security, hope
and joy make up the livelihood of the carnal world.

Secondly, Next it concerns us to enquire what are the 2.
things that maintain and support this security, hope and joy in the hearts of
unregenerate men, and if we consider duly, we shall find Church privileges,
natural ignorance, false evidences of the love of God, slight workings of the
Gospel, self-love, comparing themselves with the more profane; and Satan's
policy managing all these in order to their eternal ruin; are so many springs
to feed and maintain this life of delusion in the unregenerate.

1. First, Church privileges lay the foundation to this strong delusion: thus
the Jews deceived themselves, saying in their hearts, We have Abraham for our
Father, Mat. 3. 9. This propt up their vain hopes that Abraham's blood ran in
their veins, though Abraham's faith and obedience never wrought in their hearts.

2. Secondly, Natural ignorance, this keeps all in peace; they that see not,
fear not. There are but two ways to quiet the hearts of men about their
spiritual and eternal concernments, viz. the way of assurance and faith, or the
way of ignorance and self-deceit: by the one we are put beyond danger, by the
other beyond fear, though the danger be greater. Satan could never quiet men if
he did not first blind them.

3. Thirdly, False evidence of the love of God is another spring feeding this
security, vain hope, and false joy in the hearts of men: see the power of it to
hush and still the Conscience, Mat. 7. 22. Many will say to me in that day,
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, etc. The things upon which they
build their evidence and confidence were external things in Religion, yet they
had a quieting power upon them as if they had been the best evidences in the
world.

4. Fourthly, Slight workings of the Gospel, such are transient motions of the
affections under the word, Heb. 6. 8. the working of their desires about
spiritual objects, Joh. 6. 34. Mat. 25. 8. the external change and reformation
of their ways, Mat. 12. 43. all which serve to nourish the vain hopes of the
unregenerate.

5. Fifthly, Self-love is an apparent reason and ground of security and false
hope, Mat. 7. 3. it makes a man to overlook great evils in himself, whilst he
is sharp-sighted to discover and censure lesser evils in others: self-love
takes away the sight of sin, by bringing it too near the eye.

6. Sixthly, Men's comparing themselves with those that are more profane and
grossly wicked than themselves, serves notably to quiet and hush the Conscience
asleep; God, I thank thee, said the Pharisee, I am not as other men, or as this
Publican. O what a Saint did he seem to himself, when he stood by those that
were more externally wicked!

7. Seventhly and Lastly, The policy of Satan to manage all these things to the
blinding and ruining of the souls of men, is another great reason they live so
securely and pleasantly as they do, in a state of so much danger and misery, 2
Cor. 4. 3, 4. The God of this world blinds the eyes of them that believe not.

Thirdly, You have seen what the life of the unregenerate is, and what
maintains that life: in the next place I shall 3.
give you evidence that this is the life the generality of the world do live: a
life of carnal security, vain hope and false joy: this will evidently appear,
if we consider,

First, The activity and liveliness of men's spirits in pursuit of the world. O
how lively and vigorous are their hearts in the management of earthly designs,
Psalm. 6. 4. Who will show us any good? The world eats up their hearts, time and
strength. Now this could never be if their eyes were but opened to see the
danger and misery their souls be in: how few designs for the world run in the
thoughts of a condemned man? O if God had ever made the light of conviction to
shine into their Consciences, certainly the temptations would lie the quite
contrary way; even in too great a neglect of things of this life: but this
briskness and liveliness plainly shows the great security which is upon most
men.

Secondly, The mavelous quietness and stillness that is in the thoughts and
consciences of men about their everlasting concernments plainly shows this to
be the life of the unregenerate: how few scruples, doubts or fears shall you
hear from them? how many years may a man live in carnal families before he
shall hear such a question as this seriously propounded, What shall I do to be
saved? There are no questions in their lips, because no fear or sense of danger
in their hearts.

Thirdly, The general contentedness and professed willingness of carnal men to
dye, gives clear evidence that such a life of security and vain hope is the
life they live; Like sheep they are laid in the grave, Psalm. 49. 14. O how
quiet and still are their Consciences, when there are but a few breaths more
between them and everlasting burnings! Had God opened their eyes to apprehend
the consequences of death, and what follows the pale Horse, Rev. 6. 8. it were
impossible but that every unregenerate man should make that bed on which he
dies shake and tremble under him.

Fourthly and Lastly, The low esteem men have for Christ, and the total neglect
of, at least the mere trifling with those duties in which he is to be found,
plainly discovers this stupid secure life to be the life that the generality of
the world do live: for were men sensible of the disease of sin, there could be
no quieting them without Christ the Physician, Phil. 3. 8. All the business
they have to do in this world could never keep them from their knees, or make
them strangers to their Closets: all which, and much more that might be said of
like nature, gives too full and clear proof to this sad assertion, that this is
the life the unregenerate world generally lives.

Fourthly, In the last place I would speak a few words to 4.
discover the danger of such a life as has been described, to which purpose
let the following brief hints be minded seriously.

First, By these things souls are inevitably betrayed into Hell and eternal
ruin, this blinding is in order to damning, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. If our Gospel be
hid, it is hid to them that are lost; whose eyes the god of this world has
blinded: those that are turned over into eternal death are thus generally mop't
and hoodwinkt in order thereunto, Isai. 6. 9, 10. And he said go and tell this
people, hear ye indeed but understand not, and see ye indeed but perceive not:
make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their
eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their hearts, and convert and be healed.

Secondly, As damning is the event of blinding, so nothing makes Hell a more
terrible surprise to the soul than this does: by this means the wrath of God is
felt before its danger be apprehended, a man is past all hope before he begins
to have any fear: his eternal ruin like a breach ready to fall, swelling out
in a high wall comes suddenly at an instant, Isa. 30. 13. And as it damns
surely and surprizingly, so,

Thirdly, Nothing more aggravates a man's damnation than to sink suddenly into
it, from amidst so many hopes and high confidence of safety: for a man to find
himself in Hell when he thought and concluded himself within a step of Heaven,
O what a Hell will it be to such men! the higher their vain hopes lifted them
up, the more dreadful must their fall be, Mat. 7. 22. And as it damns surely,
surprizingly and with highest aggravations, So,

Fourthly, This life of security and vain hope frustrates all the means of
recovery and salvation in the only season, wherein they can be useful and
beneficial to us: by reason of these things the word has no power to convince
men's Consciences, nothing can bring them to a sight and sense of their
condition: therefore Christ told the self-confident and blind Jews, Mat. 21.
21. That the Publicans and Harlots go into the kingdom of God before them: and
the reason is, because their hearts lie more open and fair to the strokes of
conviction and compunction for sin than those do, who are blinded by vain hopes
and confidences.

Inference 1.
Is this the life that the unregenerate world lives? then it is not to be
wondered at, that the preaching of the Gospel has so Inference 1.
little success: who has believed our report (says the Prophet) and to whom
is the arm of the Lord revealed? Isai. 53. 1. Ministers study for truths apt to
awaken and convince the Consciences of them that hear them, but their words
return again to them: they turn to God and mourn over the matter, we have
labored in vain, and spent our strength for naught; and this is the cause of
all security; and vain hopes bar fast the doors of men's hearts against all the
convictions and persuasions of the word: the greater cause have they to admire
the grace of God, who have or shall find the convictions of the word sharper
than any two-edged Sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of the soul and
spirit: to whose hearts God brings home the Commandment by an effectual
application.

Inference 2.
If this be the life of the unregenerate world, what deadly enemies Inference 2.
are they that nourish and strengthen the groundless confidences and vain hopes
of salvation in men! This the Scripture calls the healing of the hurt of souls
slightly, by crying peace, peace, when there is no peace, Jer. 6. 14. the
sowing of Pillows under their arm holes, Ezech. 13. 18. that they may lie soft
and easy under the Ministry: and this is the Doctrine which the people love,
but O what will the end of these things be! and what an account have those men
to give to God for the blood of those souls by them betrayed to the everlasting
burnings! Such flattery is the greatest cruelty: those whom you bless upon
earth will curse you in Hell, and the day in which they trusted their souls to
your conduct.

Inference 3.
How great a mercy is it to be awakened out of that general sleep and security
which is fallen upon the world? You cannot estimate Inference 3.
the value of that mercy, for it is a peculiar mercy. O that ever the Spirit of
the Lord should give thy soul a jog under the Ministry of the word, startle,
and rouse thy Conscience, whilst others are left snoring in the deep sleep of
security round about thee: when the Lord shall deal with thy soul much after
that rate he did with Paul in the way to Damascus, who not only saw a light
shining from Heaven, which those that traveled with him saw as well as he, but
heard that voice from Heaven which did the work upon his heart, though his
Companions heard it not. Besides, it is not only a peculiar mercy, but it is a
leading introductive mercy to all other spiritual mercies that follow it to all
eternity: if God had not done this for thee, thou had never been brought to
faith, to Christ or Heaven: for from this act of the Spirit all other saving
acts take their rise: so that you have cause for ever to admire the goodness of
God in such a favor as this is.

Inference 4.
Lastly, Hence it follows, that the generality of the world are in the direct
way to eternal ruin, and whatever their vain confidences Inference 4.
are, they cannot be saved: Narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that
leads unto life, and few there be that find it. Hear me all you that live
this dangerous life of carnal security and vain hope, whatever your persuasions
and confidences are; except you give them up and get better grounds for your
hope, you cannot be saved. For,

First, Such hopes and confidences as yours are directly contradictory to the
established order of the Gospel, which requires repentance, Acts 5. 31. faith,
Acts 13. 39. and regeneration, John 3. 3. in all that shall be saved: and this
order shall never be altered for any man's sake.

Secondly, If such as you be saved, all the threatenings in Scripture must be
reversed, which lie in full opposition to your vain hopes, Mark 16. 16. John 3.
16. Romans 3. 8, 9. either the truth of God in these threatenings must fail, or
your vain hopes must fail.

Thirdly, If ever such as you be saved, new conditions must be set to all the
promises: for there is no condition of any special promise found in any
unregenerate person. Compare your hearts with these Scriptures, Mat. 5. 3, 4,
5, 6. Psalm. 24. 4. Psalm. 84. 11. Genesis 17. 1, 2.

Fourthly, If ever such a hope as yours bring you to Heaven, then the saving
hope of Gods elect is not rightly described to us in the Scriptures. Scripture
hope is the effect of regeneration, 1 Pet. 1. 3. and purity of heart is the
effect of that hope, 1 John 3. 3. Nay,

Fifthly, The very nature of Heaven is mistaken in Scripture, if such as you be
Subjects qualified for its enjoyment: for assimilation or the conformity of the
soul to God in holiness, is in the Scripture account a principal ingredient of
that blessedness: by all which it manifestly appears that the hopes of most men
are vain, and will never bring them to Heaven.

The Twenty first SERMON. Sermon 21.

Doct. 2.
That there is a mighty efficacy in the Word or Law Doct. 2.
of God to kill vain Confidence and quench carnal Mirth in the hearts of men,
when God sets it home upon their Consciences.

THe weapons of the word are not carnal but mighty 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.
through God; to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations
and every high thing that exalts it self against the knowledge of God, and
bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. In the
opening of this point I shall

1. Demonstrate the efficacy of the word or Law of God. 2. Show wherein the
efficacy thereof lies. 3. From whence it has all this mighty power and
efficacy.
First, I shall give you some demonstrations of the mighty power and efficacy
that there is in the word or Law of God: 1.
which will appear with fullest evidence,

First, From the various subjects upon whom it works: the hearts and
Consciences of men of all orders and qualities 1.
have been reached and wounded to the quick by the twoedged sword of Gods Law.
Some among the great and honorable of the earth, (though indeed the fewest of
that rank) have been made to stoop and tremble under the word, Act. 24. 16.
Mark 6. 20. 1 Samuel 15. 24. the wise and learned of the world have felt its
power, and been brought over to embrace the humbling and self-denying ways of
Christ, Acts 17. 34. Thus Origin, Hierom, Tertullian, Bradwardine, and many
more came into Canaan laden with Egyptian Gold, as one speaks (i. e.) they came
into the Church of God abundantly enriched and furnished with the learned arts
and sciences; devoting them all to the service of Christ: Yea, and which is as
strange, the most simple, weak and illiterate have been wonderfully changed and
wrought upon by the power of the word: the testimonies of the Lord make wise
the simple. Men of weak understandings in all other matters have been made wise
to salvation by the power of the word, Mat. 11. 25. 1 Cor. 1. 27. Nay, the most
malicious and obstinate enemies of Christ have been wounded and converted by
the word, 1 Timothy 1. 13. Act. 16. 24. Those that have been under the prejudice
of the worst, and most idolatrous education, have been the subjects of its
mighty power, Act. 19. 26. To conclude, men of the most profligate and
debauched lives have been wonderfully changed, and altered by the power of the
word, 1 Cor. 6. 10, 11.

Secondly, The mighty efficacy of the Law of God appears in the manner of its
operation which works suddenly, strikes like a Dart through the hearts and
Consciences of men, Act. 2. 37. a wonderful change is made in a short time: and
as it works quickly and suddenly, so it works irresistibly, with an
uncontrouled power, upon the spirits of men, 1 These. 1. 5. Romans 1. 16. Let the
soul be armed against conviction with the thickest ignorance, strongest
prejudice, or most obstinate resolution, the word of God will wound the breast
even of such a man; when God sends it forth in his authority and power.

Thirdly, The wonderful power of the Law or word of God is evidently seen in
the strange effects which are produced by it in the hearts and lives of men.
For,

First, It changes and alters the frame and temper of the mind: it moulds a man
into a quite contrary temper, Gal. (...)
1. 23. He which persecuted us in times past, now preaches the faith, which
once he destroyed: thus a Tiger is transformed into a Lamb by the power of the
word of God.

Secondly, It makes the soul upon which it works to forgo and quit the dearest
interest it has in this world for Jesus Christ, Phil. 3. 7, 8, 9. riches,
honors, self righteousness, dearest relations are denied and forsaken:
reproach, poverty and death it self are willingly embraced for Christ's sake;
when once the efficacy of the word has been upon the hearts of men, 1 These. 1.
6. Those that were their companions in sin are declined, renounced and cast off
with abhorrence, 1 Pet. 4. 3, 4. In such things as these the mighty power of
the word discovers it self.

Secondly, Next let us see wherein the efficacy of the word upon the souls of
men principally consists: and we find 2.
in Scripture it exerteth its power in five distinct acts upon the soul; by all
which it strikes at the life, and kills the very heart of vain hopes. For,

First, It has an awakening efficacy upon secure and sleepy sinners: it rouzes
the Conscience, and brings a man to a sense and feeling apprehension, Ephesians. 5.
13, 14. the first effectual jog or touch of the word startles the drousie
Conscience. A poor sinner lies in his sins as Peter did in his Chains fast
asleep, though a Warrant were signed for his Execution the next day: but the
Spirit in the word awakens him, as the Angel did Peter: and this awakening
power of the word is in order both of time and nature antecedent to all its
other operations and effects.

Secondly, The Law of God has an enlightening efficacy upon the minds of men:
it is eye salve to the blinded eye, Rev. 3. 18. a light shining in a dark place,
2 Pet. 1. 19. a light shining into the very heart of man, 2 Cor. 4. 6. When the
word comes in power, all things appear with another face: the sins that were
hid from our eyes, and the danger which was concealed by the policy of Satan
from our souls, now lie clear and open before us, Ephesians. 5. 8.

Thirdly, The word of God has a convincing efficacy: it sets sin in order
before the soul, Psalm. 50. 21. as an Army is drawn up in exact order, so are
the sins of nature and practice, the sins of youth and age, even a great and
terrible Army is drawn up before the eye of the Conscience; the convictions of
the word are clear and full, 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25. the very secrets of a sinners
heart are made manifest; his mouth is stopped; his pleas are silenced; his
Conscience yields to the charge of guilt, and equity of the sentence of the
Law. So that the soul stands mute, and self-condemned at the Bar of Conscience:
it has nothing to say why the wrath of God should not come upon it to the
uttermost, Romans 3. 19.

Fourthly, The Law of God has a soul-wounding, an heartcutting efficacy: it
pierces into the very soul and spirit of man, Act. 2. 37. When they heard this,
they were pricked at their hearts, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the
Apostles; Men and brethren what shall we do? A dreadful sound is in the sinners
ears, his soul is in deep distress, he knows not which way to turn for ease; no
Plaster but the blood of Christ can heal these wounds which the word makes: no
outward trouble, affliction, disgrace or loss ever touched the quick as the
word of God does.

Fifthly, The word has a heart-turning, a soul converting efficacy in it: it is
a regenerating as well as a convincing word, 1 Pet. 1. 23. 1 These. 1. 9. The
Law wounds, the Gospel cures; the Law discovers the evil that is in sin, and
the misery that follows sin: and the Spirit of God working in fellowship with
the word effectually turns the heart from sin. And thus we see in what glorious
acts, the efficacy of the word discovers it self upon the hearts of men, and
all these acts lie in order to each other: for until the soul be awakened it
cannot be enlightened, Ephesians. 5. 14. till it be enlightened it cannot be convinced,
Ephesians. 5. 13. Conviction being nothing else, but the application of the light
that shines in the mind to the Conscience of a sinner; till it be convinced it
cannot be wounded for sin, Act. 2. 37. and until it be wounded for sin, it will
never be converted from sin, and brought effectually to Jesus Christ: and thus
you see what the power of the word is.

Thirdly, In the last place, it will concern us to enquire whence the word of
God has all this power; and it is 3.
most certain that it is not a power inherent in it self, nor derived from the
instrument by which it is managed; but from the Spirit of the Lord who
communicates to it all that power and efficacy which it has upon our souls.

First, Its power is not in or from it self: it works not in a Physical way as
natural agents do; for then the effect would always follow, except it were
miraculously hindered: but this spiritual efficacy is in the word, as the
healing virtue was in the waters of Bethesda, John 5. 4. An Angel went down at
a certain season into the Pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first
after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever
disease he had. It is not a power naturally inherent in it at all times, but
communicated to it at some special seasons: how often is the word Preached, and
no man awaked or convinced by it!

Secondly, The power of the word is not communicated to it by the instrument
that manageth it, 1 Cor. 3. 7. Neither is he that planteth any thing; neither
he that waters. Ministers are nothing to such an effect and purpose as this
is: he does not mean that they are useless and altogether unnecessary, but
insufficient of themselves to produce such mighty effects: it works not as it
is the word of man, 1 These. 2. 13. Ministers may say of the ordinary, as Peter
said of the extraordinary effects of the Spirit, Acts 3. 12. Ye men of Israel
why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own
power or holiness we had made this man to walk? If the effects of the word were
in the power, and at the command of him that preaches it, then the blood of
all the souls that perish under our Ministry must lie at our door, as was
formerly noted.

Thirdly, If you say whence then has the word all this power? Our answer is,
it derives it all from the Spirit of God, 1 These. 2. 13. For this cause thank
we God without ceasing, Litera jubetur, spiritu dona^r. Aug. Ep. 157.
because when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it
not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which
effectually works also in you that believe. It Is a successful instrument only
when it is in the hand of the Spirit, without whose influence it never did, nor
can convince, convert or save any soul. Now, the Spirit of God has a
sovereignty over three things in order to the conversion of the sinner.

viz. 1. Over the word which works. 2. Over the soul wrought upon. 3. Over the
time and season of working.

First, The Spirit has a glorious sovereignty over the word it self, whose
instrument it is, to make it successful or not; as it pleases him, Isai. 55.
10, 11. For as the rain comes down, and the snow from Heaven, etc. so shall my
word be that goes out of my mouth: as the Clouds so the word is carried and
directed by divine pleasure: it is the Lord that makes them both give down their
blessings, or to pass away fruitless and empty: yea, it is from the Spirit that
this part of the word works and not another: those things upon which Ministers
bestow greatest labor in their preparation, and from which accordingly they
have the greatest expectation; these do nothing, when mean time something that
dropped occasionally from them, like a chosen Shaft strikes the mark and does the
work.

Secondly, The Spirit of the Lord has a glorious sovereignty over the souls
wrought upon; it is his peculiar work to take away the stony heart out of our
flesh, and to give us an heart of flesh, Ezec. 36. 26. We may reason, exhort
and reprove, but nothing will stick till the Lord set it on. The Lord opened
the heart of Lydia under Paul's ministry: he opens every heart that is
effectually opened to receive Christ in the word: if the word can get no
entrance, if your hearts remain dead under it still, we may say concerning such
souls, as Martha did concerning her Brother Lazarus; Lord if thou had been
here, my Brother had not died. So, Lord, if thou had been in this Sermon, in
this Prayer, or in that counsel, these souls had not remained dead under them.

Thirdly, The Spirit has dominion over the times and seasons of conviction and
conversion: therefore the day in which souls are wrought upon is called the day
of his power, Psalm. 110. 3. that shall work at one time, which had no efficacy
at all at another time: because this, and not that was the time appointed: and
thus you see whence the word derives that mighty power it has.

Now this word of God when it is set home by the Spirit is mighty to convince,
humble and break the hearts of sinners, Joh. 16. 9. The Spirit when it comes
shall convince the world of sin: the word signifies conviction by such clear
demonstration as compels assent: it not only convinces men in general that
they are sinners, but it convinces men particularly of their own sins, and the
aggravations of them. So in the Text, sin revived, that is, the Lord revived
his sins, the very circumstances and aggravations with which they were
committed: and so it will be with us when the Commandment comes: sins that we
had forgotten, committed so far back as our youth or childhood; sins that lay
slighted in our Consciences, shall now be rouzed up as so many sleepy Lions to
affright and terrify us: for now the soul hears the voice of God in the word,
as Adam heard it in the cool of the day and was afraid, and hides it self; but
all will not do: for the Lord is come in the word: sin is held up before the
eyes of the Conscience in its dreadful aggravations and fearful consequences,
as committed against the holy Law, clear light, warnings of Conscience,
manifold mercies, Gods long-suffering, Christ's precious blood, many warnings of
judgments, the wages and demerit whereof by the verdict of a man's own
Conscience, is death, eternal death, Romans 6. 23. Romans 1. 32. Romans 2. 9. thus
the Commandment comes, sin revives, and vain hopes give up the Ghost.

Inference 1.
Is there such a mighty power in the word, then certainly the word is of divine
authority: there cannot be a more clear, and Inference 1:
satisfying proof, that it is no humane invention, than the common sense that
all Believers have of the almighty power in which it works upon their hearts:
so speaks the Apostle, 1. These. 2. 13. When ye received the word of God which
ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth)
the word of God; which effectually works also in you that believe. Can the
power of any creature, the word of a mere man, so convince the Conscience, so
terrify the heart, so discover the very secret thoughts of the soul, put a man
into such tremblings? No, no, a greater than man must needs be here: none but a
God can so open the eyes of the blind, so open the graves of the dead, so
quicken and enliven the Conscience that was seared, so bind over the soul of a
sinner to the judgment to come, so change and alter the frame and temper of a
man's spirit, so powerfully raise, refresh and comfort a drooping dying soul.
Certainly the power of God is in all this; and if there were no more, yet this
alone were sufficient to make full proof of the divine authority of the
Scriptures.

Inference 2.
Judge from hence what an invaluable mercy the preaching of Inference 2.
the word is to the world: it is a blessing far above our estimation of it;
little do we know what a treasure God commits to us in the Ordinances, Acts
13. 25. To you is the word of this salvation sent: it is the very power of God
to salvation, Romans 1. 16. and salvation is ordinarily denied to whom the
preaching of the word is denied, Romans 10. 14. It Is called the word of life,
Phil. 2. 16. and deserves to be valued by every one of us as our life: the
eternal decree of Gods election is executed by it upon our souls: as many as be
ordained to eternal life shall believe by the preaching of it. Great is the
ingratitude of this generation which so slights and undervalues this invaluable
treasure: which is a sad presage of the most terrible judgment, even the
removing our Candlestick out of its place, except we repent.

Inference 3.
How sore and terrible a judgment lies upon the souls of those Inference 3.
men to whom no word of God is made powerful enough to convince and awaken
them! Yet so stands the case with thousands who constantly sit under the
preaching of the word: many Arrows are shot at their Consciences, but none goes
home to the mark, all fall short of the end: the Commandment has come unto
them many thousand times, by way of promulgation and ministerial inculcation,
but never yet came home to their souls by the spirits effectual application. Oh
friends, you have often heard the voice of man, but you never yet heard the
voice of God: your understandings have been instructed, but your Consciences to
this day were never thoroughly convinced; We have mourned unto you, but ye have
not lamented, Mat. 11. 17. Who has believed our report, and unto whom is the
arm of the Lord revealed? Alas, we have labored in vain, we have spent our
strength for naught, our word returns unto us empty; but O what a stupendous
judgment is here! Heb. 6. 7, 8. The earth which drinks in the rain that
comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
dressed, receives blessing from God; but that which bears thorns and briars
is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned. What a sore
judgment and sign of Gods displeasure would you account it, if your fields
were cursed; if you should manure, dress, plough and sow them; but never reap
the fruit of your labor, the increase being still blasted? And yet this were
nothing compared with the blasting of the word to your souls: that which is a
savor of life unto life unto some, becomes the savor of death unto death, to
others, 2 Cor. 2. 16. The Lord affect our hearts with the terrible strokes of
God upon the souls of men.

2d Use of Exhortation.
I shall conclude this point with a few words of Exhortation to three sorts of
men, Use 2.


viz. 1. To those that never felt the power of the word. 2. To those that have
only felt some slight and common effects thereof. 3. To those unto whose very
hearts the Commandment is come in its effectual and saving power.

First, You that never felt any power in the word at all, I beg you in the name
of him that made you, and by all the regard 1.
and value you have for those precious souls within you; that now at last such
Considerations as these may find place in your souls; and that you will bethink
your selves,

Consideration 1.
Whose word that is that cannot gain entrance into your hearts, is it not the
Word of God which you despise and slight? thou castest my word behind thy back,
Psalm. 50. 17. O what an affront and provocation to God is this! you despise not
man but God; the great and terrible God, in whose hand your breath and soul is:
this contempt runs higher than you imagine.

Consid. 2.
Consider that however the Word has no power upon you, the commandment cannot
come home to your hearts; yet it does work, and comes home with power to the
hearts of others: whilst you are hardened, others are melted under it: whilst
you sleep, others tremble; whilst your hearts are fast locked up, others are
opened: how can you choose but reflect with fear and trembling upon these
contrary effects of the word? especially when you consider that the eternal
decrees both of election and reprobation are now executed upon the souls of men
by the preaching of the Word. Some believe, and others are hardened.

Consid. 3.
That no Judgment of God on this side hell is greater than a hard heart, and
stupid Conscience under the Word: it were much better that the providence of
God should blast thy Estate, take away thy Children, or destroy thy health,
than harden thy heart, and sear thy Conscience under the Word. So much as thy
soul is better than thy body, so much as Eternity is more valuable than time;
so much is this spiritual Judgment more dreadful than all temporal ones: God
does not inflict a more terrible stroke than this upon any men in this world.

O therefore as you love your own souls, and are loath to ruin them to all
Eternity, attend upon every opportunity that God affords you, for you know not
in which of them the Lord may work upon your hearts: lay aside your prejudices
against the Word, or the weaknesses and infirmities of them that preach it: for
the Word works not as it is the word of man, as it is thus neat, and elegant,
but as it is the Word of God: pray for the blessing of God upon the Word, for
except his word of blessing go forth with it, it can never come home to thy
soul: meditate upon what you hear; for without meditation it is not like to
have any effectual operation upon you. Search your souls by it, and consider
whether that be not your very case and state which it describes, your very
danger whereof it gives warning; take heed lest after you have heard it, the
cares of the world choke not what you have heard, and cause those budding
convictions which begin to put forth, to blast and wither: carefully attend to
all those Items and memorandums your Consciences give you under the word, and
conclude that the Lord is then come nigh unto you.

Secondly, let this be matter of serious consideration and caution to all such
as have only felt some slight, transient, 2.
and ineffectual operations of the Gospel upon their souls: the Lord has come
nigh some of our souls, we have felt a strange power in the Ordinances,
sometimes terrifying, and sometimes transporting our hearts; but alas, it
proves but a morning dew, or an early cloud, Hos. 6. 4. we rejoice in the Word,
but it is but for a season, Jo^. 3. 35. Gal. 4. 14, 15. they are vanishing
motions, and come to nothing. Look as in nature there are many abortives as
well as perfect Children, so it is in Religion: yea, where the new Creature is
perfectly formed in one soul, there be many abortives and miscarriages: and
there may be three reasons assigned for it, viz.

First, The Subtilty and deep policy of Satan, who never more effectually
deceives and destroys the souls of men, than in such a method, and by such an
artifice as this: for when men have once felt their Consciences terrified under
the Word, and their hearts at other times ravished with the joys and comforts
of it, they now seem to have attained all that is necessary to conversion, and
constitutive of the new Creature: these things look so well like the
regenerating effects of the spirit, that many are easily deceived by them. The
devil beguiles the hearts of the unwary by such false appearances, for it is
not every man that can distinguish betwixt the natural and spiritual motions of
the affections under the word: it is very frequently seen that even carnal and
unrenewed hearts have their meltings and transports as well as spiritual
hearts. The subject matter upon which the word treats are the weighty things of
the world to come: heaven and hell are very awful and affecting things, and an
unrenewed heart is apt to thaw and melt at them; now here is the cheat of
Satan, to persuade a man that these must needs be spiritual affections, because
the objects about which they are conversant are spiritual. Whereas it is
certain, the object of the affections may be very spiritual and heavenly, and
yet the workings of a man's affections about them, may be in a mere natural way.

Secondly, The dampening efficacy of the world is a true and proper cause of
these abortions and miscarriages under the Word, Luke 8. 12, 13, 14. there are
hopeful and promising beginnings and budding of affections in some persons,
especially in their youth; but when once they come to be engaged in the world,
how soon are they dampt and quenched! as the cares of a Family grow on, so do
the cares of salvation wear off: it is not as it was wont to be, what shall I do
to be saved? how shall I get interest in Christ? but what shall I eat and
drink, and wherewithal shall I and mine be maintained? Thus earth justles out
heaven, and the present world drowns all thoughts of that to come. Good had it
been for many men, they had never been engaged so deep in the world as they
are: their life is but a constant hurry of business, and a perpetual diversion
from Christ, and things that are eternal.

Thirdly, Lastly, The deceitfulness and treachery of the heart, which too
easily gives way to the designs of Satan and suffers it self to be imposed upon
by him, is not the least cause why so many hopeful beginnings come to nothing,
and the effects of the word vanish. Pride and self-love are very apt to
overvalue every little good, and slight or undervalue every evil that is in
us: and so quickly choaks those convictions that begin to work in our souls.

But oh that such men would consider that the dying away of their convictions,
is that which threatens the life of their souls for ever: now is the bud
withered, the blossom blasted, and what expectation is there of fruit after
this, except the Lord revive them again? The Lord open men's eyes to discern the
danger of such things as these are, Jud. ver. 12. Heb. 10. 38. Yet I deny not,
but there are many stands and pauses in the work of conversion: it seems to dye
away, and then revives again; and revive it must or we are lost; but how many
are there who never recover it more! This is a sore Judgment of a most
terrible consequence to the souls of men.

3. Thirdly, In the last place, Let it be a word of counsel and advice to them
upon whom the word works effectually 3.
and powerfully: to whose hearts the commandment is come home, to revive sin,
and kill their vain hopes: and these are of two sorts.

1. Embryos under the first workings of the Spirit. 2. Complete births of the
Spirit, regenerated souls.
First, Embryos that are under the first workings of the Spirit in the word. O
let it not seem a misery or unhappiness 1.
to you that the Commandment is come, and sin revived, and your former hopes
overthrown. It must be thus if ever God intend mercy for you. Had you gone on
in that dangerous security you were in before, you had certainly been lost for
ever: God has stopped you in that path that leads down to hell, and none that go
in there do ever return again, or take hold of the paths of life. O it is better
to weep, tremble, and be distressed now, than to mourn without hope for ever:
let it not trouble you that sin has found you out; you could never have found
out the remedy in Christ, if you had not found out the disease and danger, by
the coming of the commandment. And I beseech you carefully to observe whether
the effects and operations of the word upon your hearts be deeper and more
powerful than they are found to be in such souls as miscarry under it: the
Commandment comes to them, and shows them this or that more gross and startling
sin; does it come to you and show you not only this or that particular sin, but
all the evils of your heart and life? the corruption of your natures, as well
as the transgressions of your lives? if so, it promises well, and looks
hopefully and comfortably to you. The commandment comes to others and startles
them with the fears of damnation for their sin: it puts them into a grievous
fright at hell, and the everlasting burnings; but does it come to thee and
discover the infinite evil that is in thy sin, as it is committed against the
great, holy, righteous, and good God; and so melts thy heart into tears for the
wrong that thou have done him, as well as the danger into which thou have
brought thy self? This is a hopeful work, and may encourage thee. It comes to
others and greatly shakes, but never destroys and razes the foundation of
their vain hopes: if it so revive sin, as to kill all vain hopes, in thee, and
shut thee up to Christ, as thy only door of hope, fear not; these troubles will
prove the greatest mercies that ever befell thee in this world, if thus they
work, and continue to work upon thy soul.

Secondly, Others there are upon whom the Word has 2.
had its full effect as to Conversion. O bless God for ever for this mercy: you
cannot sufficiently value it. God has not only made it a convincing and
wounding, but a converting and healing word to your souls: he has not only
revived your sins, and killed your vain hopes, but begotten you again to a
lively hope: see that you be thankful for this mercy. How many have sat under
the same word but never felt such effects of it? As Christ said in another
case, There were many Widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, but unto none of
them was the Prophet sent save unto Sarepia a City of Sidon to a certain Widow
there, Luke 4. 46. So I may say in this case, there were many souls in the same
Congregation, at the same time; but unto none of them was the word sent with a
Commission to convince and save; but such a one as thy self: one as improbable
to be wrought upon as any soul there. O let this beget thankfulness in your
souls: and let it make you love the word as long as you live. I will never
forget thy precepts, for by them thou have quickened me, Psalm. 119. 93.

But above all, I beseech you make it appear that the Commandment has come
home to your hearts with power to convince you of the evil of sin, by your
tenderness and care to shun it as long as you live. If ever you have seen the
face of sin in the glass of the Law of God, if your hearts have been humbled
and broken for it in the days of your trouble and distress; certainly you will
choose the worst affliction rather than sin: it would be the greatest folly in
the world to return again to iniquity, Psalm. 85. 8. you that have seen so much
of the evil that is in it, and the danger that follows it; you that have had
such inward terrors and fears of Spirit about it, when that terrible
representation was made you; will be loath to feel those gripes and distresses
of Conscience again, for the best enjoyment in this world.

Blessed be God if any word have been brought home to our hearts which has
been instrumental to bring us to Christ.
The Twenty second SERMON. Sermon 22.

JOHN 6. 45. Text.
It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught The teachings of
God opened, in their nature and necessity.
of God: every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father,
comes unto me.
HOW necessary to our Union with Jesus Christ the application of the Law, or
coming home of the Commandment to the heart of a sinner is, we have heard in
the last discourse: and how impossible it is, either for the Commandment to
come to us, or for us to come to Christ without illumination, and instruction
from above, you shall hear in this.

This Scripture has much of the mind of God in it, and he that is to open it
had need himself to be taught of God. In the foregoing verses Christ offers
himself as the bread of life unto the souls of men: against this doctrine they
oppose their carnal reason, ver. 41, 42. Christ strikes at the root of all
their Cavils and objections in his reply, ver. 43, 44. Murmur not among your
selves, no man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him,
q. d. you slight me because you do not know me, you do not know me, because you
are not taught of God: of these divine teachings, the Prophets of old have
spoken, and what they foretold is at this day fulfilled in our sight: so many
as are taught of God, and no more come unto me in the way of faith: it is
impossible to come without the teachings of God, ver. 44. it is as impossible
not to come, or to miscarry in their coming unto me, under the influence of
these Divine teachings, ver. 45.

The words read consist of two parts,
Viz. 1. An allegation out of the Prophets. 2. The application thereof made by
Christ.

First, An allegation out of the Prophets: it is written in the Prophets, And
they shall be all taught of God: the places in 1*
the Prophets to which Christ seems here to refer are, Isa. 54. 13. and all thy
Children shall be taught of the Lord, and Jer. 31. 34. and they shall teach no
more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord,
for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
says the Lord: these promises contain the great blessings of the New Covenant,
viz. Divine instruction, and heavenly illumination, without which no man can be
brought up to the terms of the New Covenant.

Secondly, We have here the application of these Testimonies 2.
out of the Prophets made by Christ himself, every man therefore that has
heard, and learned of the Father comes unto me.

In which words we have both the necessity, and the efficacy of these divine
teachings: without them no man can come, and under them no man can miscarry The
words being fitly rendered, and the sense obvious,

The Notes are,
DOCT. 1.
That the teachings of God are absolutely necessary to every man Doct. 1.
that comes unto Christ in the way of faith.

DOCT. 2.
No man can miss of Christ, or miscarry in the way of faith, Doct. 2.
that is under the special instructions and teachings of the father.

DOCT. 1.
That the teachings of God are absolutely necessary to every man that comes
unto Christ in the way of faith.

Of the necessity of Divine teaching in order to believing, Qui credunt
praedicatore forinsecus insonante, intus a patre audiunt, atque dis^unt: qui
autem non credunt, for is audiunt, intus non audiunt. Aug. de praedest. cap. 8.
the Apostle speaks in Ephesians. 4. 20, 21. but ye have not so learned Christ, if so
be that you have heard him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus,
(i. e.) your faith must needs be effectual both to the reformation of your
lives, and your perseverance in the ways of holiness, if it be such a faith as
is begotten and introduced into your hearts by divine teachings. Now in the
Explication of this point I shall speak distinctly to the following enquiries.

1. How does God teach men, or what is imported in our being taught of God? 2.
What those special lessons are, which all believers do hear, and are taught of
God? 3. In what manner does God teach these things to men in the day of their
conversion to Christ. 4. What Influence Gods teaching has upon our believing?
5. Why it is impossible for any man to believe or come to Christ without the
Fathers teachings.
First, How does God teach men, or what is imported in 1.
our being taught of God? To this I will speak both negatively and positively,
for your clearer apprehension of the sense and meaning of the Spirit of God in
this phrase.

First, The teaching of God, and our hearing and learning of him is not to be
understood of any extraordinary visional appearances, or Oraculous and
immediate voice of God to men: God indeed has so appeared unto some, Numb. 12.
8. such voices have been heard from Heaven: but now these extraordinary ways
are ceased, Heb. 1. 1, 2. and we are no more to expect them: we may sooner meet
with Satanical delusions, than Divine illuminations in this way. I remember the
Learned Gerson tells us that the Devil once appeared unto an holy man in
Prayer, personating Christ, and saying, I am come in Person to visit thee, for
thou art worthy: but he with both hands shut his eyes, saying, nolo hic
Christum videre, satis est ipsum in gloria videre, (i. e.) I will not see
Christ here, it is enough for me to see him in glory. We are now to attend only
to the voice of the Spirit in the Scriptures: this is a more sure word, than
any voice from Heaven, 2 Pet. 1. 19.

Secondly, The teachings of God are not to be understood as opposite unto, or
exclusive of the teachings of men. Divine teachings do not render Ministeral
teachings vain or useless. Paul was taught of God, Gal. 1. 12. and his
Conversion had something extraordinary in it, yet the Ministry of Ananias was
used, and honored in that work, Acts 9. 4, 17. compared. Divine teachings do
indeed excel, but not exclude humane teachings. I know that Scripture, Jer.
31. 24. to which Christ here refers, is objected against the necessity of a
standing Ministry in the Church, they shall teach no more every man his
neighbor and every man his brother, etc. but if those words should be
understood absolutely, they would not only overthrow all public Ordinances of
Gods own institution, 1 Cor. 12. 28. and deprive us of a principal fruit of
Christ's Ascension, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12. but for the same reason would destroy all
private instructions, and fraternal admonitions also. Such a sense would make
the Prophet to contradict the Apostle; and spoil the consent and harmony of
the Scriptures: the sense therefore cannot be negative but comparative: it
shows the excellency of Divine, but does not destroy the usefulness of humane
teachings. Subordinata non pugnant: the teachings of men are made effectual by
the teachings of the Spirit, and the Spirit in his teachings will use and
honor the Ministry of man.

Thirdly, But to speak positively, the teachings of God are nothing else, but
that spiritual and heavenly light, by which the Spirit of God shines into the
hearts of men to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Jesus Christ, as the Apostle speaks, 2 Cor. 4. 6. and though this be
the proper work of the Spirit, yet it is called the teachings of the Father,
because the Spirit who enlightens us is commissionated, and sent by the Father
so to do, Joh. 14. 26. Now these teachings of the Spirit of God consist in two
things, viz.

In his 1. Sanctifying impressions. 2. Gracious assistances.

First, In his Sanctifying impressions, or regenerating works upon the soul, by
virtue whereof it receives mavelous light and insight in spiritual things:
and that not only as illumination is the first act of the spirit in our
conversion, Col. 3. 10. but as his whole work of sanctification is Illuminative
and instructive to the converted soul, 1 John 2. 27. the anointing which you
have received of him abides in you, and ye need not that any man teach you,
but as the same anointing teaches you: the meaning is, that Sanctification
gives the soul experience of those Mysterious things which are contained in the
Scriptures, and that experien^ the most excellent key to unlock, and open those
deep Scripture Mysteries: no knowledge is so distinct, so clear, so sweet, as
that which the heart communicates to the head, Joh. 7. 17. if any man do his
will, he shall know the doctrine: a man that never read the nature of love in
books of Philosophy, nor the transports and ecstasies thereof in History, may
yet truly describe and express it by the sensible motions of that passion in
his own soul: yea, he that has felt, much better understands, than he that
has only read or heard. O what a light does spiritual sense and experience
cast upon a great part of the Scriptures! for indeed sanctification is the very
copy or transcript of the Word of God upon the heart of man, Jer. 31. 33. I
will write my Law in their heart: so that the Scriptures, and the experiences
of believers by this means answer to each other as the lines and letters in the
Press, answer to the impressions made upon the paper: or the figures in the wax
to the engravings in the Seal. When a Sanctified man reads David's Psalms, or
Paul's Epistles, how is he surprised with wonder to find the very workings of
his own heart so exactly decyphered, and fully expressed there! Oh says he,
this is my very case: these holy men speak what my very heart has felt.

Secondly, The Spirit of God teaches us, as by his sanctifying impressions; so
by his gracious assistances which he gives us pro re nata, as our need
requires, Matthew. 10. 19. it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
speak: Joh. 14. 26. he shall bring all things to your remembrance: he assisteth
both the understanding in due apprehensions of truth, and the heart in the
spiritual improvements of truth: and so much briefly of the first particular.

Secondly, In the next place, we are to enquire what those special truths are
which believers hear, and learn of the father, 2.
when they come to Christ.

And there are diverse great and necessary truths wherein the Spirit enlightens
men in that day. I cannot say they are all taught every believer in the same
degree, and order: but it is certain they are taught of God such lessons as
these are, which they never so understood before.

Lesson 1.
First, They are taught of God, that there is abundantly more evil in their
sinful natures and actions, than ever they discerned or understood before: the
Spirit when he comes shall convince the world of sin, John 16. 8, 9. Men have
a general notion of sin before: so had Paul when a Pharisee, but how vastly
different were his apprehensions of sin, from all that ever he had in his
natural state, when God brought home the Commandment to his very heart! There
is a threefold knowledge of Sin, viz. Traditional, discursive, and intuitive.
The First is in the more rude and illiterate multitude. The Second, in more
rational and knowing men. The Third is only found in those that are enlightened,
and taught of God: and there is as great a difference betwixt this intuitive
knowledge of sin whereby God makes a soul to discern the nature and evil of it
in a spiritual light, and the two former; as there is betwixt the sight of a
painted Lion upon the wall, and the sight of a living Lion that meets us
roaring in the way. The intuitive sight of sin is another thing than men
imagine it to be: it is such a sight as wounds a man to the very heart, Acts 2.
37. for God does not only show a man this or that particular sin, but in the
day of conviction he sets all his sins in order before him, Psalm. 50. 21. yea,
the Lord shows him the sinfulness of his nature, as well as practice.
Conviction diggs to the root, shows and lays open that original corruption
from whence the innumerable evils of the life do spring, Jam. 1. 14, 15. and
which is yet more, the Lord shows the man whom he is bringing to Christ the
sinful and miserable state which he is in by reason of both: Joh. 16. 9. and
now all excuses, pleas, and defenses of sin are gone: he shows them how their
iniquities have exceeded, Job 36. 8, 9. exceeded in number, and in aggravation
of sinfulness; exceeding many, and exceeding vile; no such sinner in the world
as I: can such sins as mine be pardoned? the greatness of God greatens my sin,
the holiness of God makes it beyond measure vile: the goodness of God puts
unconceivable weight into my guilt. O can there be mercy with God for such a
wretch as I? if there be, then there will not be a greater example of the
riches of free grace in all the world than I am: thus God teaches the evil of
sin.

Lesson 2.
Secondly, God teaches the soul whom he is bringing to Christ, what that wrath
and misery is which hangs over it in the threatenings because of sin. Scripture
threatenings were formerly slighted, now the soul trembles at them: they once
apprehended themselves safe enough, Isa. 28. 15. Psalm. 50. 21. they thought
because they heard no more of their sins after the Commission of them, that
therefore they should never hear more, that the effect had been as transient a
thing as the act of sin was, or if trouble must follow sin, they should speed
no worse than others; the generality of the world being in the same case: and
beside, they hoped to find God more merciful, than sour and precise preachers
represented him; but when a light from God enters into the soul to discover the
nature of God and of sin; then it sees that whatever wrath is treasured up for
sinners in the dreadful threatenings of the Law, is but the just demerit of sin,
the recompense that is meet: the wages of sin is death, Romans 6. ult. the penal
evil of damnation is but equal to the moral evil of sin: So that in the whole
Ocean of Gods eternal wrath there is not one drop of injustice: yea, the soul
does not only see the Justice of God in its eternal damnation, but the
wonderful mercy of God in the suspension thereof so long. O what is it that
has withheld God from damning me all this while! how is it that I am not in
hell! Now do the fears and awful apprehensions of eternity seize the soul, and
the worst of sensitive creatures is supposed to be in a better condition than
such a soul: never do men tremble at the threatenings of God, nor rightly
apprehend the danger of their condition, until sin and wrath and the wages of
sin be discovered to them by a light from heaven.

Lesson 3.
Thirdly, God teaches the soul whom he brings to Christ that deliverance from
sin and wrath to come is the greatest, and most important business it has to
do in this world, Acts 16. 30. what must I do to be saved? q. d. O direct me to
some effectual way (if there be any) to secure my poor wretched soul from the
wrath of God. Sin and the wrath that follows it are things that swallow up the
souls, and drink up the very spirit of men: their thoughts never conversed with
things of more confessed truth, and awful solemnity: these things float not
upon their fancies as matters of mere speculation, but settle upon their hearts
day and night as the deepest concernment in all the world: they now know much
better than any mere Scholar, the deep sense of that Text, Matthew. 16. 26. what
is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or
what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

Five things show how weighty the thoughts and cares of salvation are upon
their hearts.

First, Their continual thoughtfulness and solicitude about these things: if
earthly affairs divert them for a while, yet they are still returning again to
this solemn business.

Secondly, Their careful redeeming of time, and saving the very moments thereof
to employ about this work: those that were prodigal of hours and days before,
look upon every moment of time as a precious and valuable thing now.

Thirdly, Their fears and tremblings lest they should miscarry and come short
at last, show how much their hearts are set upon this work.

Fourthly, Their inquisitiveness and readiness to embrace all the help and
assistance that they can get from others, evidently discovers this to be their
great design.

Fifthly, and Lastly, The little notice they take of all other troubles and
afflictions tells you their hearts are taken up about greater things. This is
the third Lesson they are taught of God.

Lesson 4.
Fourthly, The Lord teaches the soul that is coming to Christ, that though it
be their duty to strive to the uttermost for salvation; yet all strivings in
their own strength are insufficient to obtain it. This work is quite above the
power of nature: it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of
God that shows mercy: the soul is brought to a full Conviction of this, by
the discovery of the heinous nature of sin, and of the rigor and severity of
the Law of God: no repentance, nor reformation can possibly amount unto a just
satisfaction, nor are they within the compass and power of our will. It was a
saying that Dr. Hill often used to his friends, speaking about the power of
man's will, he would lay his hand upon his breast and say, every man has
something here to confute the Arminian doctrine; this fully takes off the soul
from all expectations of deliverance that way: it cannot but strive, that is
its duty; but to expect deliverance as the purchase of its own strivings, that
would be its sin.

Lesson 5.
Fifthly, The soul that is coming to Christ by faith is taught of God, that
though the case it is in be sad, yet it is not desperate, and remediless; there
is a door of hope, a way of escape for poor sinners, how black and fearful
soever their own thoughts and apprehensions are. There is usually at this time
a dawning light of hope in the soul that is under the fathers teachings, and
this commonly arises from the general and indefinite encouragements and
promises of the Gospel: which though they do not presently secure the soul from
danger, yet they prop and mightily support it against despair; for though they
be not certain that deliverance shall be the event of their trouble, yet the
possibilities, and much more the probabilities of deliverance are a great stay
to the sinking soul: the troubled soul cannot but acknowledge it self to be in
a far better case than the damned are, whose hopes are perished from the Lord,
and a death-pang of despair has seized their Consciences: and herein the
merciful and compassionate nature of God is eminently discovered in haftening
to open the door of hope almost as soon as the evil of sin is opened: it was
not long after Adams eyes were opened to see his misery, that God opened Christ
his remedy in that first promise, Genesis 3. 15. and the same method of grace is
still continued to his Elect offspring, Gal. 3. 21, 22. Romans 3. 21, 22. these
supporting hopes the Lord sees necessary to encourage industry in the use of
means: it is hope that sets all the world awork: if all hope were cut off, every
soul would sit down in a sullen despair yielding it self for hell.

Lesson 6.
The Lord teaches those that come to Christ, that there is a fullness of saving
power in him, whereby any soul that duly receives him may be perfectly
delivered from all its sin and misery, Heb. 7. 25. Col. 1. 19. Mat. 28. 18.
this is a great and necessary point for every Believer to learn and hear from
the Father: for unless the soul be satisfied of the fullness of Christ's saving
power, it will never move forward toward him: and herein also the goodness of
God is most sweetly and seasonably manifested; for at this time it is the great
design of Satan to fill the soul with despairing thoughts of a pardon: but all
those black and heart-sinking thoughts vanish before the discovery of Christ's
alsufficiency. Now the sin-sick soul says with that woman, Mat. 9. 21. If I
may but touch the hem of his Garment, I shall be healed: how deep soever the
guilt and stain of sin be, yet the soul which acknowledges the infinite dignity
of the blood of Christ, the offering of it up to God in our room, and Gods
declared satisfaction in it; must needs be satisfied that Christ is able to
save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him, which is the sixth Lesson
Believers are taught of God.

Lesson 7.
Every man that comes to Christ is taught of God, that it can never reap any
benefit by the blood of Christ, except he have union with the person of Christ,
1 John 5. 12. Ephesians. 4. 16. Time was when men fondly thought nothing was
necessary to their salvation but the death of Christ; but now the Lord shows
them that their union with Christ by faith is as necessary in the place of an
applying cause, as the death of Christ is in the place of a meritorious cause:
the purchase of salvation is an act of Christ without us whilst we are yet
sinners: the application thereof is by a work wrought within us, when we are
believers, Col. 1. 27. In the purchase all the elect are redeemed together by
way of price. In the application they are actually redeemed man by man by way
of power. Look as the sin of the first Adam could never hurt us, unless he had
been our head by way of generation: so the righteousness of Christ can never
benefit us, unless he be our head in the way of regeneration. In teaching this
Lesson the Lord in mercy unteaches and blots out that dangerous principle by
which the greatest part of the Christianized world do perish, viz. that the
death of Christ is in it self effectual to salvation, though a man be never
regenerated or united unto him by saving faith.

Lesson 8.
God teaches the soul whom he is bringing to Christ, that whatsoever is
necessary to be wrought in us, or done by us in order to our union with Christ,
is to be obtained from him in the way of prayer, Ezekiel. 36. 37.

And it is observable that the soul no sooner comes under the effectual
teachings of God, but the spirit of prayer begins to breath in it, Acts 9. 8.
behold he prays: those that were taught to pray by men before, are now taught
of the Lord to pray; to pray did I say? yea, and to pray fervently too, as men
concerned for their eternal happiness: to pray not only with others, but to
pour out their souls before the Lord in secret; for their hearts are as bottles
full of new wine, which must vent or break. Now the soul returns upon its God
often in the same day; now it can express its burdens and wants in words and
groans which the spirit teaches: they pray and will not give over praying till
Christ come with complete salvation.

Lesson 9.
Ninthly, All that come to Christ ^e taught of God to abandon their former
ways and companions in sin as ever they expect to be received unto mercy,
Isai. 55. 7. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Sins that were profitable and pleasant, as the right
hand, and right eye, must now be cut off. Companions in sin, who were once the
delight of their lives, must now be cast off. Christ says to the soul
concerning these, as he said in another case, John 18. 8. if therefore ye seek
me, let these go their way: and the soul says unto Christ as it is Psalm 119.
115. depart from me ye evil doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God:
and now pleasant sins, and companions in sin become the very burden and shame
of a man's soul: objects of delight are become objects of pity and compassion:
no endearments, no union of blood, no earthly interests whatsoever are found
strong enough to hold the soul any longer from Christ: nothing but the
effectual teachings of God is found sufficient to dissolve such bonds of
iniquity as these.

Lesson 10.
Tenthly, All that come unto Christ are taught of God that there is such a
beauty and excellency in the ways and people of God as is not to be matched in
the whole world, Psalm. 16. 3. When the eyes of strangers to Christ begin to be
opened and enlightened in his knowledge, you may see what a change of judgment
is wrought in them with respect to the people of God, and toward them
especially, whom God has any way made instrumental for the good of their
souls, Cant. 5. 9. they then called the spouse of Christ, the fairest among
women: the convincing holiness of the Bride then began to enamour and affect
them with a desire of nearer conjunction and communion: we will seek him with
thee; with thee, that have so charged us; that have taken so much pains for the
good of our souls: now, and never before, the righteous appears more
excellent than his Neighbor. Change of heart is always accompanied with change
of judgment, with respect to the people of God: thus the Jailer, Act. 16. 33.
washed the Apostles stripes, to whom he had been so cruel before. The godly now
seem to be the glory of the places where they live: and the glory of any place
seems to be darkened by their removal. As one said of holy Mr. Barrington,
Methinks the Town is not at home, when Mr. Barrington is out of Town: they
esteem it a choice mercy to be in their company, and acquaintance, Zech. 8. 23.
we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you: no people like the
people of God now: as one said when he heard of two faithful friends, utinam
tertius essem, O that I might make the third! Whatever vile or low thoughts
they had of the people of God before, to be sure now they are the excellent of
the earth, in whom is all their delight: the holiness of the Saints might have
some interest in their Consciences before, but they never had such an interest
in their estimations and affections till this Lesson was taught them by the
Father.

Lesson 11.
Eleventhly, All that come to Christ are taught of God, that whatever
difficulties they apprehend in Religion, yet they must not upon pain of
damnation be discouraged thereby, or return back again to sin. Luke 9. 62. No
man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom
of God: plowing work is hard work: a strong and steady hand is required for it:
he that plows must keep on, and make no balks of the hardest and toughest
ground he meets with. Religion also is the running of a Race, 1 Cor. 9. 24.
there is no standing still, much less turning back if ever we hope to win the
prize.

The Devil indeed labors every way to discourage and daunt the soul, by
representing the insuperable difficulties of Religion to it; and young
beginners are but too apt to be discouraged, and fall under despondency: but
the teachings of the Father are encouraging teachings: they are carried on from
strength to strength against all the oppositions they meet from without them,
and the many discouragements they find within them: to this conclusion they are
brought by the teaching of God, we must have Christ, we must get a pardon, we
must strive for salvation, let the difficulties, troubles and sufferings in the
way be never so great or many. As he said, necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam:
it is necessary that I go on, it is not necessary that I live: so says the soul
that is taught of God; it is easier with me to dispense with ease, honor,
relations; yea, with life it self, than to part with Christ and the hopes of
eternal life.

Lesson 12.
Twelfthly, They that come to Christ are taught of God, that whatever guilt and
unworthiness they discover in themselves, and whatever fears and doubts hang
upon their hearts as to pardon and acceptance; yet as the case stands it is
their wisdom and great interest to venture themselves in the way of faith upon
Jesus Christ, whatever the issue thereof be.

Three great discouragements are usually found upon the hearts of those that
come to Christ in the way of faith.

First, The sensible greatness of guilt and sin, how can I go to Christ that am
in such a case, that have been so vile a wretch? and here measuring the grace
and mercy of Chris by what it finds in it self, or in other creatures, 1 Samuel
24. 19. the soul is ready to sink under the weight of its own discouraging and
misgiving thoughts.

Secondly, The sense they have of their own weakness, and inability to do what
God requires, and must of necessity be done, if ever they be saved: my heart is
harder than an Adamant, how can I break it? My will is stubborn and exceeding
obstinate, I am no way able to bow it; the frame and temper of my spirit is
altogether carnal and earthly; and it is not in the power of my hand to alter
and change it: alas I cannot subdue any one corruption, nor perform one
spiritual duty, nor bear one of those sufferings and burdens which religion
lays upon all that follow Christ: this also proves a great discouragement in
the way of faith.

Thirdly, And which is more than all, the soul that is coming to Jesus Christ,
has no assurance of acceptance with him, if it should adventure himself upon
him: it is a great hazard, a great adventure; it is much more probable (if I look
to my self) that Christ will shut the door of mercy against me.

But under all these discouragements the soul learns this Lesson from God, that
as ungodly as it is, as weak and impotent as it is, as full of fears and doubts
as it is: nevertheless it is every way its great duty and concernment to go on
in the way of faith, and make that great adventure of it self upon Jesus
Christ: and of this the Lord convinces the soul by two things.

viz. 1. From the absolute necessity of coming. 2. From the encouraging
probabilities of speeding.

First, The soul sees an absolute necessity of coming; necessity is laid upon
it, there is no other way, Acts. 4. 12. God has shut it up by a blessed
necessity to this only door of escape, Gal. 3. 23. damnation lies in the
neglect of Christ, Heb. 2. 3. The soul has no choice in this case, Angels,
Ministers, duties, repentance, reformation cannot save me, Christ, and none but
Christ can deliver me from present guilt and the wrath to come: why do I
dispute, demur, delay, when certain ruin must inevitably follow the neglect or
refusal of Gospel offers?

Secondly, The Lord shows those that are under his teaching the probabilities
of mercy for their encouragement in the way of believing: and these
probabilities the soul is enabled to gather from the general and free
invitations of the Gospel, Isai. 55. 1, 7. Rev. 22. 17. from the conditional
promises of the Gospel, Joh. 6. 37. Mat. 11. 28. Isai. 1. 18. from the vast
extent of grace beyond all the thoughts and hopes of creatures, Isai. 55. 8, 9.
Heb. 7. 25. from the encouraging examples of other sinners who have found mercy
in as bad condition as they, 1 Timothy 1. 13. 2 Chronicles. 33. 3. 1 Cor. 6. 10, 11.
from the Command of God which warrants the action, and answers all the
objections of unworthiness and presumption in them that come to Christ, 1 John
3. 23. and lastly, from the sensible changes already made upon the temper and
frame of the heart. Time was when I had no sense of sin, nor sorrow for sin; no
desires after Christ, nor heart to duties; but it is not so with me now. I now
see the evil of sin, so as I never saw it before; my heart is now broken in the
sense of that evil: my desires begin to be enflamed after Jesus Christ. I am
not at rest, nor where I would be, till I am in secret mourning after the Lord
Jesus. Surely these are the dawnings of the day of mercy: let me go on in this
way; it says as the Lepers at the siege of Samaria, 2 King, 7. 3, 4. If I stay
here I perish, if I go to Christ, I can but perish. Hence Believers bear up
against all objected discouragements, certum exitium commutemus incerto, it is
the dictate of wisdom, the vote of reason; to exchange a certain for an
uncertain ruin. And thus you have heard what those excellent Lessons are which
all that come to Christ are taught by the Father.

The Twenty third SERMON. Sermon 23.

JOHN 6. 45. Text.
It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God: every man
therefore, that has heard and learned of the Father, comes unto me.
IN the former Sermon, you have been taught this great truth:

Doct.
That the teachings of God are absolutely necessary to every soul that comes
unto Christ in the way of faith.

What the teachings of God import, has been formerly opened: and what those
special Lessons are, which all believers hear and learn of the Father, was the
last thing discoursed: that which remains to be further cleared about this
subject, before I come to the Application of the whole, will be to show you, 1.
What are the Properties of divine teachings. 2. What influence they have in
bringing souls to Christ. 3. Why it is impossible for any man to come to Christ
without these teachings of the Father.


First, what are the properties of divine teachings. Concerning the teachings
of God we affirm in general that though 1.
they exclude not, yet they vastly differ from all humane teachings: as the
power of God, in effecting transcends, all humane power, so the wisdom of God
in teaching transcends all humane wisdom. For,

First, God teaches powerfully: he speaks to the soul with a strong hand;
when the word comes accompanied with the Spirit, it is mighty through God, to
cast down all imaginations, 2 Cor. 10. 4. Now the Gospel comes not in word only
(as it was wont to do) but in power, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 4, 5. a power that makes the
soul fall flat before it, and acknowledge that God is in that word, 1 Cor. 14.
25.

Secondly, the teachings of God are sweet teachings. Men never relish the
sweetness of a truth, till they learn it from God, Cant. 1. 3. His name is as
an Ointment poured forth, Cant. 5. 16. his mouth is most sweet. O how
powerfully, and how sweetly does the voice of God slide into the heart of a
poor melting sinner! how jejune, dry, and tastless are all the discourses of
men, compared with the teachings of the Father!

Thirdly, God teaches plainly and clearly, he not only opens truths to the
understanding, but he opens the understanding also to perceive them, 2 Cor.
3. 16. In that day the veil is taken away from the heart: a light shines into
the soul: a clear beam from heaven is darted into the mind, Luke 24. 45. Divine
teachings are fully satisfying: the soul doubts no more, staggers and hesitates
no more; but acquiesces in that which God teaches: it is so satisfied that it
can venture all upon the truth of what it has learnt from God, as that Martyr
said, I cannot dispute, but I can dye for Christ. See Prove. 8. 8, 9.

Fourthly, The teachings of God are infallible teachings, the wisest and
holiest of men may mistake, and lead others into the same mistakes with
themselves; but it is not so in the teachings of God: if we can be sure that
God teaches us, we may be as sure of the truth of what he teaches ^r his
spirit guides us into all truth, Joh. 16* (...). and into nothing but truth.

Fifthly, The teachings of God are abiding teachings, they make everlasting
impressions upon the soul, Psalm. 119. 98. they are ever with it: the words of
men vanish from us; but the words of God stick by us: what God teaches he
writes upon the heart, Jer. 31. 33. and that will abide: littera scripta
manet. It Is usual with souls whose understandings have been opened by the Lord,
many years afterward to say, I shall never forget such a scripture that once
convinced me, such a promise that once encouraged me.

Sixthly, The teachings of God are saving teachings, they make the soul wise
unto Salvation, 2 Timothy 3. 15. There is a great deal of other knowledge that
goes to hell with men: the pavement of hell (as one speaks) is pitched with the
sculs of many great Scholars, but eternal life is in the teachings of God. Joh.
17. 3. This is eternal life to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ
whom thou have sent. This is deservedly styled the light of life, Joh. 8. 12.
in this light we shall see light, Psalm. 36. 9.

Seventhly, The teachings of God make their own way into the dullest and
weakest capacities, Isa. 32. 4. The heart also of the rash shall understand
knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly:
upon this account Christ said, Mat. 11. 25. I thank thee O father Lord of
heaven and earth, because thou have hid these things from the wise and prudent,
and have revealed them unto babes: it is admirable to see what clear
illumination some poor illiterate Christians have in the mysteries of Christ
and Salvation, which others of great abilities, deep and searching heads can
never discover with all their learning and study.

Eighthly, To conclude, the teachings of God are transforming teachings, 2 Cor.
3. 18. they change the soul into the same image: God casts them whom he
teaches into the very mould of those truths which they learn from him, Romans 6.
17. These are the teachings of God, and thus he instructs those that come to
Christ.

Secondly, Next let us see what influences divine teachings* have upon souls in
bringing them to Christ: and we shall find 2^
a threefold influence in them.

1. They have an influence upon the external means by which they come to
Christ. 2. They have influence upon the mind to remove what hindered it from
Christ. 3. They have influence upon the will to allure and draw it to Christ.
First, They have influence upon the means by which we come to Christ: the best
ordinances are but a dead letter, except the spirit, the teaching and
quickening spirit of God work in fellowship with them, 2 Cor. 3. 6. The best
Ministers like the Disciples cast forth the Net, but take nothing, win not one
soul to God, till God teach as well as they. Paul is nothing and Apollo
nothing, but God that gives the increase, 1 Cor. 3. 7. Let the most learned,
eloquent and powerful Orator be in the Pulpit, yet no man's heart is persuaded
till it hears the voice of God; cathedram in coelis habet qui corda docet.

Secondly, They have influence upon the mind to remove what hindered it from
Christ; except the minds of men be first untaught those errors by which they
are prejudiced against Christ, they will never be persuaded to come unto him:
and nothing but the Fathers teachings can unteach those errors, and cure those
evils of the mind: the natural mind of man slights the truths of God until God
teach them; and then they tremble with an awful reverence of them. Sin is but a
trifle till God shows us the face of it in the glass of the Law, and then it
appears exceeding sinful, Romans 7. 13. We think God to be such a one as our
selves, Psalm. 50. 21. until he discover himself unto us in his infinite
greatness, awful holiness, and severe Justice; and then we cry, who can stand
before this great and dreadful God! We thought it was time enough hereafter to
mind the concernments of another world, until the Lord open our eyes, to see
in what danger we stand upon the very brink of eternity; and then nothing
scares us more than the fears that our time will be finished before the great
work of Salvation be finished. We thought our selves in a converted State
before, till God make us to see the necessity of another manner of conversation
upon pain of eternal damnation. We readily caught hold upon the promises
before, when we had no right to them; but the teachings of God make the
presumptuous sinner let go his hold, that he may take a better and surer hold
of them in Christ. We once thought that the death of Christ in it self had been
enough to secure our Salvation; but under the teachings of God, we discern
plainly the necessity of a change of heart and state; or else the blood of
Christ can never profit us. Thus the teachings of God remove the errors of the
mind by which men are withheld from Christ.

Thirdly, The teachings of God powerfully attract and allure the will of a
sinner to Christ, Hos. 2. 14. But of these drawings of the father I have
largely spoken before, and therefore shall say no more of it in this place, but
hasten to the last thing propounded, viz.

Thirdly, why it is impossible for any man to come to Christ without the
Fathers teachings: and the impossibilities hereof will appear three ways.

1. From the power of sin. 2. From the indisposition of man. 3. From the nature
of faith.
By all which the Last point designed to be spoken to from this Scripture will
be fully cleared, and the whole prepared for application.

First, The impossibility of coming to Christ without the teachings of the
Father will appear from the power of sin, which has so strong an holdfast upon
the hearts and affections of all unregenerate men, that no humane arguments or
persuasions whatsoever can divorce or separate them; for

First, sin is connatural with the soul, it is born and bred with a man: Psalm.
51. 5. Isa. 48. 8. It is as natural for fallen man to sin as it is to breath.

Secondly, The power of sin has been strengthening it self from the beginning,
by a long continued Custom, which gives it the force of a second nature; and
makes regeneration and mortification naturally impossible. Jer. 15. 23. Can the
Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? Then may he also do good
that is accustomed to do evil.

Thirdly, Sin is the delight of the sinner: it is a sport to a fool to do
mischief, Prove. 10. 23. Carnal men have no other pleasure in this world, but
what arises from their Lusts: to cut off their corruptions by mortification,
were at once to deprive them of all the pleasure of their lives.

Fourthly, sin being connatural, customary, and delightful, does therefore
bewitch their affections and inchant their hearts to that degree of madness and
fascination; that they rather choose damnation by God, than separation from
sin: their hearts are fully set in them to do evil, Eccles. 8. 11. they rush
into sin, as the horse rusheth into the battle, Jer. 8. 6. And now what think
you can separate a man from his beloved Lust, except the powerful and effectual
teachings of God? Nothing but a light from heaven can rectify and reduce the
enchanted mind, no power but that of God can change and alter the sinful bent
and inclination of the will, it is a task above all Creature power.

Secondly, The impossibility of coming to Christ without the Fathers teachings
evidently appears from the indisposedness of man, the subject of this change:
the natural man receives not the things which are of God, 1 Cor. 2. 14. Three
things must be wrought upon man, before ever he can come to Christ: his blind
understanding must be enlightened; his hard and rocky heart must be broken, and
melted; his stiff, fixed and obstinate will must be conquered, and subdued: but
all these are the effects of a supernatural power. The illumination of the mind
is the peculiar work of God, 2. Cor. 4. 6. Rev. 3. 17. Ephesians. 5. 8. The breaking
and melting of the heart is the Lords own work; it is he that gives repentance,
Acts 5. 31. It Is the Lord, that takes away the heart of stone, and gives an
heart of flesh, Ezekiel. 36. 26. it is he that pours out the spirit of contrition
upon man, Zech. 12. 10. The changing of the natural bent and inclination of the
will is the Lords sole prerogative, Phil. 2. 13. all these things are
effectually done in the soul of man when God teaches it, and never till then.

Thirdly, The nature of faith by which we come to Christ plainly shows the
impossibility of coming without the Fathers teaching. Everything in faith is
supernatural: the implantation of the habit of faith is so, Ephesians. 2. 8. it is not
of our selves but the gift of God: it is not an habit acquired by industry, but
infused by grace, Phil. 1. 29. The light of faith by which spiritual things are
discerned is supernatural, Heb. 11. 1. 27. It sees things that are invisible.
The adventures of faith are supernatural; for against hope, a man believes in
hope giving glory to God, Romans 4. 18. By faith a man goes unto Christ against
all the dictates and discouragements of natural sense and reason. The
self-denial of faith is supernatural: the cutting off of the right hand, and
plucking out of right eye sins must needs be so, Matthew. 5. 29. The Victories
and conquests of faith do all speak it to be supernatural; it overcomes the
strongest oppositions from without, Heb. 11. 33, 34. it subdueth and purges
the most obstinate and deep rooted corruptions within, Acts 15. 9. it
overcomes all the blandishments, and charming allurements of the bewitching
world, 1 John 5. 4. all which considered, how evident is the conclusion, that
none can come to Christ without the Fathers teachings? The uses follow.

1. Use for Information. Use 1.

Inference. 1.
How notoriously false and absurdis that doctrine which asserteth the
possibility of believing without the efficacy of supernatural grace? Inference
1.
The desire of self-sufficiency was the ruin of Adam, and the conceit of
self-sufficiency is the ruin of multitudes of his posterity. This doctrine is
not only contradictory to the current stream of Scripture, Phil. 2. 13. 1 John
1. 13. with many other Scriptures: but it is also contradictory to the common
sense and experience of believers: yet the pride of nature will strive to
maintain, what Scripture and experience plainly contradict and overthrow.

Infer. 2.
Hence we may also inform our selves how it comes to pass that many rational,
wise and learned men miss Christ, whilst Inference 2.
mean time the simple and illiterate even babes in natural knowledge, obtain
interest in him and salvation by him.

The reason hereof is plainly given us by Christ in Mat. 13. 11. To you it is
given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
given: it is the droppings and dews of divine teaching upon one, and not upon
another, that dries up the green tree, and makes the dry tree to flourish.
Many natural men have very fine brains, searching wits, solid judgments,
nimble fancies, tenacious memories: they can search out the mysteries of
nature, solve the Phenomenon, satisfy the enquiries of the most curious: they
can measure the earth, discover the motions of the heavens; but after all take
up their place in Hell: When in the mean time the Statutes of the Lord (by the
help of his teachings) make wise the simple, Psalm. 19. 17. It Is no matter how
dull and incapable the Scholar be, if God undertake to be the teacher. I
remember Austin speaks of one who was commonly reputed a fool, and yet he could
not but judge him to be truly godly; and that by two signs of grace which
appeared in him: one was his seriousness when he heard any discourses of
Christ, the other was his indignation manifested against sin: it was truly said
by those two Cardinals (who riding to the Council of Constance overheard a poor
shepherd in the fields, with tears bewailing his sin) surgunt indocti and
rapient coelum: the unlearned will rise and take heaven, whilst we with all
our learning shall descend into Hell.

Infer. 3.
This also informs us of the true reason of the strange and various successes
of the Gospel upon the souls of men: here we see why Inference 3.
the ministry of one man becomes fruitful, and another barren: Yea, why the
labors of the same man prosper exceedingly at one time, and not at another:
these things are according as the teachings of God do accompany our teachings:
we often see a weaker and plainer discourse blessed with success, whilst that
which is more artificial, neat, and labored comes to nothing. St. Austin has
a pretty similitude to illustrate this, Suppose (says he) two Conduits, the
one very plain, the other curiously carved and adorned with images of Lions,
Eagles, etc. the water does not refresh and nourish as it comes from such a
curious Conduit; but as it is water. Where we find most of man, we frequently
find least of God. I speak not this to encourage carelessness and laziness, but
to provoke the dispensers of the Gospel to more earnestness; and servent prayer
for the assistance and blessing of the Spirit upon their labors; and to make
men less fond of their own gifts and abilities: blear-eyed Leah may bear
Children, when beautiful Rachel proves barren.

Inference 4.
Learn hence the transcendent excellency of saving spiritual Inference 4.
knowledge, above that which is merely literal and natural. One drop of
knowledge taught by God is more excellent than the whole Ocean of humane
knowledge and acquired gifts, Phil. 3. 8. Joh. 17. 3. 1 Cor. 2. 2. Let no man
therefore be dejected at the want of those gifts with which unsanctified men
are adorned. If God have taught thee the evil of sin, the worth of Christ, the
necessity of Regeneration, the mystery of faith, the way of communion with God
in duties; trouble not thy self because of thine ignorance in natural or moral
things: thou have that, Reader, which will bring thee to Heaven: and he is a
truly wise man that knows the way of salvation, though he be ignorant and
unskilful in other things: thou know that which all the learned Doctors and
Libraries in the world could never teach thee, but God has revealed them to
thee: others have more science, thou have more savor and sweetness: bless God
and be not discouraged.

2d Use for Examination.
If there be no coming to Christ without the teachings of Use 2.
the Father: then it greatly concerns us to examine our own hearts, whether
ever we have been under the saving teachings of God, during the many years we
have sat under the preaching of the Gospel. Let not the question be mistaken,
I do not ask what Books you have read, what Ministers you have heard, what
stock of natural or speculative knowledge you have acquired: but the question
is, whether ever God spoke to your hearts, and has effectually taught you such
lessons as were mentioned in our last discourse. O there is a vast difference
betwixt that notional, speculative and traditional knowledge which man learneth
from man; and that spiritual, operative and transforming knowledge which a man
learneth from God. If you ask how the teachings of God may be discerned from
all other mere humane teachings, I answer, it may be discerned and
distinguished by these six signs.

Sign 1.
The teachings of God are very humbling to the soul that is taught. Humane
knowledge puffs up, 1 Cor. 8. 1. but the teachings of God do greatly abase
the soul, Job 42. 5. I have heard of thee by the bearing of the ear, but now
mine eye sees thee; wherefore I abhor my self and repent in dust and ashes:
the same light which discovers to us the holiness, justice, greatness and
goodness of God, discovers also the vileness, baseness, emptiness and total
unworthiness of man: yea, of the best and holiest of men, Isa. 6. 5.

Sign 2.
The teachings of God are deeply affecting, and impressive teachings: they
fully reach the heart of man, Hos. 2. 14. I will allure her, and bring her into
the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her: or as it is in the Hebrew, I
will speak to her heart. When God shows unto man the evil of sin, he so
convinces the soul that no creature comforts have any pleasure or sweetness in
them: and when he shows unto man his righteousness, pardon and peace in
Christ, he so comfort and refreshes the heart, that no outward afflictions
have any weight or bitterness in them: one drop of consolation from Heaven,
sweetens a Sea of trouble upon Earth, Psalm. 94. 19. In the multitude of my
thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul.

Sign 3.
The teachings of God are sanctifying and renewing teachings: they reform and
change the heart, Ephesians. 4. 21, 22, 23. If so be that you have heard him, and
been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off concerning the
former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
Lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, etc. See here what holiness
and purity is the effect of divine teaching: holiness both external and
internal, negative and positive: holiness of every kind follows the Fathers
teachings: all the discoveries God makes to us of himself in Christ have an
assimulating quality, and change the soul into their own likeness, 2 Cor. 3. 18.

Sign 4.
All Gods teachings are practical, running into obedience. Idle notions and
useless speculations are not learnt from God. As Gods creating words, so his
teaching words are with effect: as when he said let there be light, and there
was light: so when he says to the soul, be comforted, be humbled; it is
effectually comforted, Isa. 66. 13. it is humbled, Job 40. 4, 5. As God has in
nature made no creature in vain, so he speaks no word in vain: every thing
which men hear, or learn from the Father is for use, practice and benefit to
the soul.

Sign 5.
All the teachings of God are agreeable with the written word: the Spirit of
God, and the word of God do never jarr, Joh. 14. 26. He shall take of mine and
show it unto you: When God speaks unto the heart of man, whether in a way of
conviction, consolation or instruction in duty, he always either makes use of
the express words of God in Scripture, or speaks to the heart in language every
way consentaneous and agreeable to Scripture: So that the written word becomes
the Standard to weigh, and try all divine teachings, Isa. 8. 20. To the law,
and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because
there is no light (or morning) in them: whatever is discrepant and jarring with
the Scripture, must not pass for an inspiration of God, but a deluding sophism
and insinuation of Satan.

Sign 6.
The teachings of God are very satisfying teachings to the soul of man: the
understanding faculty like a Dial is enlightened with the beams of divine truth
shining upon it: this no man's teachings can do, men can only teach objectively,
by propounding truth to the understanding; but they cannot enlighten the
faculty it self as God does, 1 John 5. 20. he gives man understanding as well
as instructions to be understood: he opens the eyes of the understanding, as
well as propounds the object, Ephesians. 1. 18. And thus we may discern and
distinguish the teachings of God, from all other teachings.

3d Use of Exhortation.
The last use I shall make of this point, shall be a word of exhortation: both
to them that never were yet effectually Use 3.
taught of God, and to them also that have heard his voice, and are come to
Christ.

First, To those that never yet heard the voice of God speaking to their
hearts: and truly this is the general case of most men and women in the
professing world: they have heard the sound of the Gospel, but it has been a
confused, empty and ineffectual sound in their ears: we have heard the voice of
man, but have never yet heard the voice of God: the gifts and abilities of
Preachers have in a notional and mere humane way improved their understandings,
and sometimes slightly touched their affections: all this is but the effect of
man upon man. O that you would look for something which is beyond all this:
satisfy not your selves with what is merely natural, and humane in ordinances;
come to the word with higher ends and more spiritual designs, than to get some
notions of truth which you had not before, or to judge the gifts and abilities
of the speaker: if God speak not to your hearts, all the Ordinances in the
world can do you no good, 1 Cor. 3. 7. O remember what a solemn and awful thing
it is to come to those Ordinances, and attend upon that Ministration in and by
which the eternal decrees of Heaven are to be executed upon your souls, which
must be to you the savor of life unto life, or of death unto death; wrestle
with God by prayer for a blessing upon the Ordinances. Say, Lord, speak thy
self to my heart, let me hear thy voice, and feel thy power in this Prayer, or
in this Sermon: others have heard thy voice, cause me to hear it: it had been
much better for me if I had never heard the voice of Preachers, except I hear
thy voice in them.

Secondly, Let all those that have heard the voice of God, and are come to
Christ in the virtue of his teachings, admire the wonderful condescension of
God to them. O that God should speak to thy soul and be silent to others! there
be many thousands living at this day under Ordinances, to whom the Lord has
not given an ear to hear, or an heart to obey, Deuteronomy. 29. 4. To you it is given
to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given,
Mat. 13. 11. and I beseech you walk as men and women that have been taught of
God. When Satan and your corruptions tempt you to sin, and to walk in the ways
of the carnal and careless world; remember then that Scripture, Ephesians. 4. 20, 21.
But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that you have heard him, and have
been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus. To conclude, see that you be
exceeding humble and lowly in Spirit: humility qualifies you for divine
teachings, Psalm. 25. 9. The humble he will teach: and the more ye are taught of
God, the more humble you will still be.

And thus you see that no man can come to Christ without the application of the
Law, and the teachings of the Father: which being considered, may be very
useful to convince us (which indeed is the design of it) that among the
multitudes of men and women, living under the Ordinances of God, and the
general profession of Religion; there are but few, very few to be found, who
have effectually received the Lord Jesus Christ by saving faith.

And now, Reader, I suppose by this time thou art desirous to know by what
signs and evidences thy union with Christ by faith may be cleared up and made
evident to thee: and how that great question whether thou have yet effectually
applied Christ to thy soul or no may be clearly decided, which brings me to the
third general Use of the whole, viz.

The Examination of our Interest in Christ.
By 1. The donation of the Spirit, from 1 John 3. 24. 2. The new Creation, from
2 Cor. 5. 17. 3. The mortification of sin, from Gal. 5. 24. 4. The imitation of
Christ, from 1 John 2. 6.

Of each of these Trials of our interest in Christ I shall speak in their
order: and first of the donation of the Spirit.

The Twenty fourth SERMON. Sermon 24.

1 JOHN 3. 24. Text.
-- And hereby we know that be abides in us, Of the manner and importance of
the Spirits indwelling.
by the Spirit which he has given us.
THe Apostle in this Chapter is engaged in a very trying Discourse: his scope
is to discriminate the spirits and states of sincere Believers, from merely
nominal and pretended Christians; which he attempts not to do by any thing that
is external, but by the internal effects and operations of the Spirit of God
upon their hearts. His enquiry is not into those things which men profess, or
about the duties which they perform, but about the frames and tempers of their
hearts, and the principles by which they are acted in religion. According to
this Test he puts Believers upon the search and study of their own hearts:
calls them to reflect upon the effects and operations of the Spirit of God
wrought within their own souls: assuring them that those gracious effects and
fruits of the Spirit in their hearts will be a solid evidence unto them of
their union with Jesus Christ; amounting to much more than a general
conjectural ground of hope, under which it is possible there may subesse falsum
lurk a dangerous and fatal mistake: but the gracious effects of the Spirit of
God within them, are a foundation upon which they may build the certainty and
assurance of their union with Christ: hereby we know that he abides in us, by
the spirit which he has given us. In which words we have three things to
consider.

viz. 1. The thing to be tried, our Union with Christ. 2. The trial of it, by
the giving of his Spirit to us. 3. The certainty of the trial this way: hereby
we know.

First, The thing to be tried, which indeed is the greatest 1.
and weightiest matter that can be brought to trial in this world or in that to
come, namely our union with Christ, expressed here by his abiding in us, a
phrase clearly expressing the difference betwixt those that by profession and
common estimation pass for Christians among men, though they have no other
union with Christ, but by an external adhesion to him in the outside duties of
Religion: and those whose union with Christ is real, vital and permanent, by
the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ in their souls. Joh. 15. 5, 6. opens the
force and importance of this phrase, I am the vine, ye are the branches; he
that abides in me, and I in him; the same brings forth much fruit: if a man
abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered: the thing then
to be tried, is whether we stand in Christ as dead branches in a living stock,
which are only bound to it by external ligatures or bonds that hold them for a
while together: or whether our souls have a vital union and coalition with
Christ by the participation of the living sap of that blessed root.

Secondly, The trial of this union, which is by the giving of the Spirit to us:
the Spirit of Christ is the very bond of Union betwixt him and our souls. I
mean not that the very person of the Spirit dwells in us, imparting his
essential properties to us: it were a rude blasphemy so to speak; but his
saving influences are communicated to us in the way of sanctifying operations:
as the Sun is said to come into the House, when his beams and comforting
influences come there. Nor yet must, we think that the graces or influences of
the Spirit abide in us in the self same measure and manner as they do in
Christ: for God gives not the spirit to him by measure: in him all fullness
dwells: he is anointed with the Spirit above his fellows: but there are
measures and proportions of grace differently communicated to Believers by the
same Spirit: and these communicated graces and real operations of the Spirit of
grace in our hearts, do undoubtedly prove the reality of our union with Christ;
as the communication of the self-same vital juice or sap of the stock to the
branch whereby it lives, and brings forth fruit of the same kind, certainly
proves it to be a real part or member of the same tree.

Thirdly, Which brings us to the third thing; namely the certainty of the trial
this way, (...) in this, or by this we know: we so know that we cannot be
deceived. To clear this, let us consider two things in grace, viz. 1. Somewhat
Constitutive of its being. 2. Somewhat Manifestative

There is something in grace which is essential and constitutive of its being:
and somewhat that flows from grace, and is manifestative of such a being: we
cannot immediately and intuitively discern the essence of grace as it is in its
simple nature. So God only discerns it, who is the author of it: but we may
discern it mediately and secondarily by the effects and operations of it. Could
we see the simple essence of grace, or intuitively discern our union with
Christ, our knowledge would be demonstrative, a priori ad posterius, by seeing
the effects as they are lodged in their cause: but we come to know the being of
grace, and the reality of our union with Christ, a posteriori, by ascending in
our knowledge from the effects and operations, to their true cause and being.

And accordingly God has furnished us with a power of self-intuition and
reflection: whereby we are able to turn in upon our own hearts and make a
judgment upon our selves, and upon our own acts. The soul has not only a
power to project, but a power also to reflect upon its own actions: not only to
put forth a direct act of faith upon Jesus Christ, but to judge and discern
that act also: 2 Timothy 1. 12. I know whom I have believed: and this is the way
in which believers attain their certainty and knowledge of their Union with
Christ: from hence the Observation will be,

DOCT. Doct.

That interest in Christ may be certainly gathered, and concluded from the gift
of the spirit to us: no man (says the Apostle) has seen God at any time: if
we love one another, God dwells in us; and his love is perfected in us:
hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of
his Spirit, 1 John 4. 12, 13. The being of God is invisible, but the operations
of his Spirit in believers are sensible and discernable. The souls union with
Christ is a supernatural mystery, yet is it discoverable by the effects
thereof, which are very perceptible in and by believers. Two things require
Explication, and Confirmation in the Doctrinal part of this point.

1. What the giving of the Spirit imports and signifies. 2. How it evidences
the souls interest in Jesus Christ.
First, As to the importance of this phrase we are to enquire 1.
what is meant by the Spirit, and what by the giving of the Spirit.

Now the Spirit is taken in Scripture two ways.

viz. Essentially or Personally.

In the first sense it is put for the Godhead, 1 Timothy 3. 16. Justified in the
Spirit, (i. e.) by the power of his Divine Nature, which raised him from the
dead. In the second sense it denotes the third person, or subsistence in the
glorious and blessed Trinity, and to him this word Spirit is attributed,
sometimes properly in the sense before mentioned, as denoting his personality;
at other times metonymically, and then it is put for the effects, fruits,
graces, and gifts of the Spirit, communicated by him unto men: Ephesians. 5. 11. be
ye filled with the Spirit. Now the fruits or gifts of the Spirit are either, 1.
Common, and assisting gifts, or 2. Special, and sanctifying gifts.


In the last sense and signification, it must be taken in this place: for as to
the common, assisting and ministering gifts of the Spirit, they are bestowed
promiscuously upon one as well as another. Such gifts in an excellent degree,
and large measure are found in the unregenerate, and therefore can never amount
to a solid evidence of the souls union with Christ: but his special sanctifying
gifts being the proper effect and consequen^ of that Union, must needs strongly
prove and confirm it. In this sense therefore we are to understand the Spirit
in this place: and by giving the spirit to us we are to understand more than
the coming of the spirit upon us: the spirit of God is said to come upon men in
a transient way, for their present assistance in some particular service;
though in themselves they be unsanctified persons: thus the spirit of God came
upon Balaam, Numb. 24. 2. enabling him to prophecy of things to come; and
although those extraordinary gifts of the spirit be now ceased, yet the spirit
cease not to give his ordinary assistances unto men, both regenerate and
unregenerate, 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9, 10, 31. compared: but whatever gifts he gives to
others, he is said to be given, to dwell, and to abide only in believers, 1
Cor. 3. 16. know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwells in you? an expression denoting both his special propriety in them,
and gracious familiarity with them: there is a great difference betwixt the
assisting and the indwelling of the spirit: the one is transient, the other
permanent. That is a good rule the Schoolmen give us, illa tantum dicuntur
inesse, quae insunt per modum quietis: those things are only said to be in a
man, which are in him by way of rest, and permanency, and so the spirit is in
believers: therefore they are said to live in the spirit, Gal. 5. 25. to be led
by the spirit, ver* 18. to be in the spirit, and the spirit to dwell in them,
Romans 8. 9. And so much of the first thing to be opened, viz. what we are to
understand by the giving of the spirit.

Secondly, In the next place we are to enquire and satisfy 2.
our selves, how this giving of the spirit evidently proves, and strongly
concludes that souls interest in Christ unto whom he is given: and this will
evidently appear by the consideration of these five particulars.

First, The spirit of God in believers is the very bond by which they are
united unto Christ: if therefore we find in our selves the bond of union, we
may warrantably conclude that we have union with Jesus Christ: this is
evidently held forth in those words of Christ: Joh. 17. 22, 23. The glory which
thou gave me, I have given them that they may be one, even as we are one. I
in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the
world may know that thou have sent me, and have loved them as thou have loved
me: it is the glory of Christ's humane nature to be united to the Godhead: this
glory (said Christ) thou gave me, and the glory thou gave me I have given
them (i. e.) by me they are united unto thee: and how this is done he shows
us more particularly, I in them: there is Christ in us, viz. mystically; and
thou in me there is God in Christ, viz. Hypostatically: so that in Christ God
and believers meet in a blessed union: it is Christ's glory to be one with God:
it is our glory to be one with Christ, and with God by him: but how is this
done? certainly no other way but by the giving of his Spirit unto us: for so
much that phrase I in them must needs import: Christ is in us by the
sanctifying spirit which is the bond of our union with him.

Secondly, The Scripture every where makes this giving or indwelling of the
spirit the great mark and trial of our interest in Christ; concluding from the
presence of it in us, positively as in the Text; and from the absence of it,
negatively, as in Romans 8. 9. now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the
same is none of his; Jude ver. 19. sensual, not having the spirit; this mark
therefore agreeing to all believers, and to none but believers; and that
always, and at all times: it must needs clearly infer the souls union with
Christ in whomsoever it is found.

Thirdly, That which is a certain mark of our freedom from the Covenant of
works, and our title to the privileges of the Covenant of grace, must needs
also infer our Union with Christ, and special interest in him: but the giving
or indwelling of the sanctifying spirit in us, is a certain mark of our freedom
from the first Covenant under which all Christless persons still stand; and our
title to the special privileges of the second Covenant in which none but the
members of Christ are interested: and consequently it fully proves our Union
with the Lord Jesus. This is plain from the Apostles reasoning, Gal. 4. 6, 7.
And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into your
hearts, crying Abba father: wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son;
and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. The spirit of the first
Covenant was a servile spirit, a spirit of fear and bondage, and they that were
under that Covenant were not Sons but Servants; but the Spirit of the New
Covenant is a free, ingenuous spirit, acting in the strength of God, and those
that do so are the Children of God: and Children inherit the blessed
privileges, and royal immunities contained in that great Charter the Covenant
of Grace; they are heirs of God, and the evidence of this their inheritance by
virtue of the second Covenant, and of their freedom from the servitude and
bondage of the first Covenant, is the spirit of Christ in their hearts crying
Abba father: So Gal. 5. 18. if ye be led by the spirit ye are not under the Law.

Fourthly, If the eternal decree of Gods electing love be executed, and the
virtues and benefits of the death of Christ applied by the spirit, unto every
soul in whom he dwells as a spirit of sanctification; then such a giving of
the spirit unto us must needs be a certain mark and proof of our special
interest in Christ: but the decree of Gods electing love is executed, and the
benefits of the blood of Christ are applied unto every soul in whom he dwells
as a spirit of sanctification. This is plain from 1 Pet. 1. 2. Elect according
to the foreknowledge of God the father through sanctification of the spirit
unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: where you see both
Gods election executed, and the blood of Jesus sprinkled or applied unto us by
the spirit, which is given to us as a spirit of sanctification. There is a
blessed order of working observed as proper to each person in the Godhead: the
Father electeth, the Son redeemeth, the spirit sanctifies. The spirit is the
last efficient in the work of our salvation: what the Father decreed, and the
Son purchased, that the Spirit applies; and so puts the last hand to the
complete salvation of believers. And this some Divines give as the reason why
the sin against the spirit is unpardonable, because he being the last agent in
order of working, if the heart of a man be filled with enmity against the
spirit, there can be no remedy for such a sin: there is no looking back to the
death of Christ, or to the Love of God for remedy: this sin against the spirit
is that obex infernalis the deadly stop and bar to the whole work of salvation:
oppositely, where the spirit is received, obeyed, and dwells in the way of
sanctification; into that soul the eternal love of God, and inestimable
benefits of the blood of Christ run freely without stop or interruption; and
consequently the interest of such a soul in Jesus Christ is beyond all dispute.

Fifthly, The giving of the spirit to us, or his residing in us as a
sanctifying spirit, is every where in Scripture made the pledge and earnest of
eternal salvation, and consequently must abundantly confirm and prove the souls
interest in Christ: Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. In whom also after that ye believed, ye
were sealed with that holy spirit of promise; which is the earnest of our
inheritance, etc. So 2 Cor. 1. 22. who has also sealed us, and given the
earnest of the spirit in our hearts. And thus you have the point opened and
confirmed. The Use of all follows.

Use. Use.

Now the only Use I shall make of this point shall be that which lies directly
both in the eye of the Text, and of the design for which it was chosen: namely,
by it to try, and examine the truth of our interest, and the validity of our
claim to Jesus Christ. In pursuance of which design I shall first lay down some
general rules, and then propose some particular trials.

First, I shall lay down some general rules for the due information of our
minds in this point upon which so great a weight hangs.

Rule 1.
Though the Spirit of God be given to us and works in us, yet he works not
as a natural and necessary, but as a free and arbitrary agent: he neither
assists nor sanctifies as the fire burns, ad ultimum sui posse, as much as he
can assist or sanctify, but as much as he pleases: Dividing to every man
severally as he will, 1 Cor. 12. 11. bestowing greater measures of gifts and
graces upon some, than upon others; and assisting the same person more at one
season, than another: and all this variety of operation flows from his own
good pleasure: his grace is his own, he may give it as he pleases.

Rule 2.
There is a great difference in the manner of the spirits working before, and
after the work of regeneration: whilst we are unregenerate, he works upon us
as upon dead Creatures that work not at all with him; and what motion there is
in our souls, is a counter-motion to the spirit: but after regeneration it is
not so, he then works upon a complying and willing mind: we work and he
assists, Romans 8. 26. our conscience witnesses, and he bears witness with it,
Romans 8. 16. It is therefore an Error of dangerous consequence to think that
sanctified persons are not bound to stir or strive in the way of duty without a
sensible impulse or preventing motion of the spirit, Isa. 64. 7.

Rule 3.
Though the Spirit of God be given to believers, and work^th in them, yet
believers themselves may do, or omit such things as may obs^ruct the working,
and obscure the very being of the spirit of God in them; ita nos tractat, ut a
nobis tractatur: he deals with us in his evidencing, and comforting work, as
we deal with him in point of tenderness, and obedience to his dictates: there
is a grieving, yea, there is a quenching of the Spirit by the lusts and
corruptions of those hearts in which he dwells: and though he will not
forsake his habitation as a spirit of sanctification, yet he may for a time
desert it as a spirit of consolation, Psalm. 51. 11.

Rule 4.
Those things which discover the indwelling of the Spirit in believers are not
so much the matter of their duties, or substance of their actions; as the more
secret springs, holy aims, and spiritual manner of their doing, or performing
of them; it is not so much the matter of a prayer, the neat and orderly
expressions in which it is uttered; as the inward sense, and spiritual design
of the soul: it is not the choice of elegant words whereby our conceptions are
clothed, or the copiousness of the matter with which we are furnished; for
even a poor stammering tongue, and broken language may have more of the spirit
of God in it. This made Luther say, he saw more excellency in the duty of a
plain rustic Christian, than in all the Triumphs of Casar, and Alexander: the
beauty and excellency of spiritual duties is an inward hidden thing.

Rule 5.
All the motions and operations of the spirit are always harmonical and
suitable to the written word: Isa. 8. 20. To the Law, and to the Testimony; if
they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
The Scriptures are by the inspiration of the spirit, therefore his inspirations
into the hearts of believers must either substantially agree with the
Scriptures, or the inspirations of the spirit be self-repugnant, and
contradictory to one another. It is very observable that the works of grace
wrought by the spirit in the hearts of believers are represented to us in
Scripture as a transcript or copy of the written word: Jer. 31. 33. I will
write my Law in their hearts. Now as a true copy answers the original, word for
word, letter for letter, point for point; so do the works of the spirit in our
souls harmonize with the dictates of the spirit in the Scriptures: whatsoever
motion therefore shall be found repugnant thereunto, must not be fathered upon
the spirit of God, but laid at the door of its proper parents, the spirit of
error, and corrupt nature.

Rule 6.
Although the works of the spirit in all sanctified persons do substantially
agree, both with the written word, and with one another (as ten thousand copies
penned from one original must needs agree within themselves) yet as to the
manner of infusion, and operation, there are found many circumstantial
differences: the spirit of God does not hold one and the same method of working
upon all hearts: the work of grace is introduced into some souls with more
terror and trouble for sin than it is in others: he wrought upon Paul one way;
upon Lydia in another way: he holds some much longer under terrors and
troubles than he does others: inveterate and more profane sinners find
stronger troubles for sin, and are held longer under them, than those are into
whose hearts grace is more early and insensibly infused by the spirits blessing
upon religious education: but as these have less trouble than the others at
first, so commonly they have less clearness, and more doubts and fears about
the work of the spirit afterward.

Rule 7.
There is a great difference found betwixt the sanctifying, and the comforting
influences of the spirit upon believers in respect of constancy, and
permanency: his sanctifying influences abide for ever in the soul: they never
depart; but his comforting influences come and go, and abide not long upon the
hearts of believers. Sanctification belongs to the being of a Christian,
Consolation only to his well being: the first therefore is fixed and abiding,
the later various and inconstant. Sanctification brings us to Heaven hereafter,
consolation brings Heaven into us here: our safety lies in the former, our
cheerfulness only in the latter. There are times and seasons in the lives of
believers wherein the spirit of God does more signally and eminently seal their
spirits, and ravish their hearts with Joy Rara hora, brevis mora; sapit quidem
suavissime, sed gustatur rarissime. Bern.
unspeakable: but what Bernard speaks, is certainly true in the experience of
Christians: It is a sweet hour, and it is but an hour: a thing of short
continuance: the relish of it is exceeding sweet, but it is not often that
Christians taste it. And so much may suffice for the general rules about the
in-being, and workings of the spirit in believers, for the better information
of our understandings, and prevention of mistakes in this matter. I shall next
according to promise lay down the particular marks and trials by which we may
discern whether God has given us his spirit or no: by which grown Christians
when they are in a due composed frame, may by the assistance of the spirit of
God (for which therefore they are bound to pray) discern his indwelling, and
working in themselves.

Evidence 1.
In whomsoever the spirit of Christ is a spirit of sanctification, to that man
or woman he has been more or less a spirit of conviction and humiliation: this
is the order which the spirit constantly observes in adult, or grown converts.
Joh. 16. 8, 9. and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin because they believed not on me. This
you see is the method he observes all the world over: he shall reprove or
convince the world of sin. Conviction of sin has the same respect unto
sanctification, as the blossoms of trees have to the fruits that follow them: a
blossom is but fructus imperfectus, and ordinabilis; an imperfect fruit in it
self, and in order to a more perfect and noble fruit: where there are no
blossoms, we can expect no fruit, and where we see no convictions of sin, we
can expect no conversion to Christ. Has then the spirit of God been a spirit
of conviction to thee? has he more particularly convinced thee of sin because
thou have not believed on him? (i. e.) has he shown thee thy sin and misery,
as an Unbeliever? not only terrified and affrighted thy conscience with this or
that more notorious act of sin, but sully convinced thee of the state of sin
that thou art in by reason of thy unbelief; which holding thee from Christ,
must needs also hold thee under the guilt of all thy other sins. This gives at
least a strong probability that God has given thee his spirit, especially,
when this conviction remains day and night upon thy soul, so that nothing but
Christ can give it rest, and consequently the great inquisition of thy soul is
after Christ, and none but Christ.

Evidence 2.
As the spirit of God has been a convincing, so he is a quickening spirit to
all those to whom he is given: Romans 8. 2. The law of the spirit of life in
Christ Jesus has made me free from the Law of sin and death: he is the spirit
of life (i. e.) the principle of spiritual life in the souls whom he
inhabiteth: for uniting them to Christ, he unites them to the fountain of life:
and this spiritual life in believers manifests it self as the natural life does
in vital actions and operations. When the spirit of God comes into the soul of
a man that was dead, and senseless under sin, O (says he) now I begin to feel
the weight and load of sin, Romans 7. 24. now I begin to hunger, and thirst after
Christ and his Ordinances, 1 Pet. 2. 2. now I begin to breath after God in
spiritual prayer, Acts 9. 11. Spiritual life has its spiritual senses, and
suitable operations. O think upon this you that cannot feel any burden in sin,
you that have no hungerings or thirstings after Christ; how can the spirit of
God be in you? I do not deny but there may at some times be much deadness and
senselesness upon the hearts of Christians, but this is their disease, not
their nature: it is but at some times not always, and when it is so with them
they are burdened with it, and complain o^ it as their greatest affliction in
this world: their spirits are not easy and at rest in such a condition as
yours are, their spirit is as a bone out of joint, an Arm dislocated which
cannot move any way without pain.

Evidence 3.
Those to whom God gives his spirit have a tender sympathy with all the
interest and concernments of Christ: this must needs be so, if the same spirit
which is in Christ dwells also in thy heart: if thou be a partaker of his
spirit, then what he loves, thou love; and what he hates, thou hate: this
is a very plain case: even in nature it self we find that the many members of
the same natural body being animated by one and the same spirit of life:
whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be
honored, all the members rejoice with it: now ye are the body of Christ, and
members in particular, 1 Cor. 12. 26, 27. For look as Christ the head of that
body is touched with a tender sense and feeling of the miseries and troubles of
his people: he is persecuted when they are persecuted, Acts 9. 4. so they that
have the spirit of Christ in them, cannot be without a deep and tender sense of
the reproach and dishonours that are done to Christ: this is as it were a sword
in their bones, Psalm. 42. 3. If his public worship cease, the assemblies of
his people scattered; it cannot but go to the hearts of all in whom the spirit
of Christ is: they will be sorrowful for the solemn assemblies: the reproach of
them will be a burden, Zeph. 3. 18. Those that have the spirit of Christ do
not more earnestly long after any one thing in this world, than the advancement
of Christ's interest by conversion and reformation in the Kingdoms of the earth,
Psalm. 45. 3, 4. Paul could rejoice that Christ was Preached, though his own
afflictions were increased, Phil. 1. 16. 18. and John could rejoice that Christ
increased, though he himself decreased; yet therein was his joy fulfilled, Joh.
3. 29. so certainly the concernments of Christ must, and will touch that heart
which is the habitation of his spirit. I cannot deny but even a good Baruch may
be under a temptation to seek great things for himself, and be too much
swallowed up in his own concernments, when God is plucking up, and breaking
down, Jer. 45. 4, 5. but this is only the influence of a temptation: the true
temper and spirit of a believer inclines him to sorrow and mourning when things
are in this sad posture. Ezech. 9. 4. Go through the midst of the City, through
the midst of Jerusalem; and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh,
and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

O Reader, lay thine hand upon thine heart: is it thus with thee? do thou
sympathize with the affairs and concernments of Christ in the world? or carest
thou not which way things go with the people of God, and Gospel of Christ; so
long as thine own affairs prosper, and all things are well with thee?

Evidence 4.
Where ever the spirit of God dwells, he does in some degree mortify and
subdue the evils and corruptions of the soul in which he resides: this spirit
lusts against the flesh, Gal. 5. 17. and believers through the spirit, do
mortify the deeds of the body, Romans 8. 13. this is one special part of his
sanctifying work. I do not say he so kills and subdues sin in believers, as
that it shall never trouble or defile them any more: no, no, that freedom
belongs to the perfect state in heaven, but its dominion is taken away, though
its life be prolonged for a season: it lives in believers still, but not upon
the provision they willingly make to fulfill the Lust of it, Romans 13. ult. The
design of every true believer is co incident with the design of the spirit to
destroy, and mortify corruption: they long for the extirpation of it: and are
daily in the use of all sanctified means, and instruments, to subdue and
destroy it: the workings of their corruptions are the afflictions of their
souls: Romans 7. 24. O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body
of this death? and there is no one thing that sweetens the thoughts of death to
believers (except the sight, and full enjoyment of God) more than their
expected deliverance from sin does.

Evidence 5.
Where ever the spirit of God dwells in the way of sanctification, in all
such he is the spirit of prayer and supplication: Romans 8. 26. Likewise the
spirit also helps our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as
we ought; but the spirit it self makes intercession for us with groanings
which cannot be uttered: where ever he is poured out as the spirit of grace, he
is also poured out as the spirit of supplication: Zech. 12. 10. his praying,
and his sanctifying influences are undivided. There is a threefold assistance
that the spirit gives unto sanctified persons in prayer: he helps them before
they pray, by setting an edge upon their defires, and affections: he helps them
in prayer by supplying matters of request to them, teaching them what they
should ask of God: he assisteth them in the manner of prayer, supplying to them
suitable affections, and helping them to be sincere in all their desires to
God: it is he that humbles the pride of their hearts, dissolves and breaks the
hardness of their hearts: out of dcadness makes them lively: out of weakness
makes them strong: he assisteth the spirits of believers after prayer: helping
them to faith and patience: to believe and wait for the returns, and answers of
their prayers. O Reader, reflect upon thy duties, consider what spirituality,
sincerity, humility, broken-heartedness, and melting affections after God are
to be found in thy duties: is it so with thee? or do thou shuffle over thy
duties as an interruption to thy business and pleasures? are they an ungrateful
task imposed upon thee by God, and thy own conscience? are there no hungerings
and thirstings after God in thy soul? or if there be any pleasure arising to
thee out of prayer, is it not from the ostentation of thy gifts? if it be so,
reflect sadly upon the carnal state of thy heart, these things do not speak the
spirit of grace, and supplication to be given thee.

Evidence 6.
Where ever the spirit of Grace inhabits, there is an heavenly, spiritual frame
of mind, accompanying and evidencing the indwelling of the spirit: Romans 8. 5,
6. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they
that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit: for to be carnally minded
is death; but to be spiritually minded, is life and peace: by the mind,
understand the musings, reasonings, yea and the cares, fears, delights, and
pleasures of the soul, which follow the workings and meditations of the mind;
as these are, so are we; if these be ordinarily, and habitually taken up, and
exercised about earthly things, then is the frame and state of the man carnal,
and earthly: the workings of every creature follow the being, and nature of it:
if God, Christ, Heaven, and the world to come engage the thoughts, and
affections of the soul, the temper of such a soul is spiritual; and the spirit
of God dwells there: this is the life of the regenerate: Phil. 3. 20. our
conversation is in Heaven: and such a frame of heart is life, and peace: a
serene, placid, and most comfortable life: no pleasure upon earth; no
gratifications of the senses do relish, and savor, as spiritual things do.
Consider therefore which way thy heart ordinarily works, especially in thy
Solitudes, and hours of retirement: these things will be a great evidence for,
or against thy soul. David could say, how precious are thy thoughts unto me O
God! how great is the sum of them! if I should count them they are more in
number than the sand; when I awake I am still with thee, Psalm. 139. 17, 18. Yet
it must be acknowledged for the relief of weaker Christians that there is great
odds, and variety found in this matter among the people of God: for the
strength, steadiness, and constancy, of a spiritual mind results from the depth
and improvement of sanctification: the more grace, still the more evenness,
spirituality, and constancy there is in the motions of the heart after God. The
minds of weak Christians are more easily entangled in earthly vanities, and
more frequently diverted by inward corruptions: yet still there is a spiritual
pondus, inclination and bent, of their hearts toward God: and the vanity and
corruption which hinders their communion with him, is their greatest grief and
burden under which they groan in this world.

Evidence 7.
Those to whom the spirit of grace is given they are led by the spirit, Romans 8.
14. As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the Sons of God:
sanctified souls give themselves up to the government, and conduct of the
spirit: they obey his voice, beg his direction, follow his motions, deny the
solicitations of the flesh and blood, in obedience to him: Gal. 1. 16. and they
that do so, they are the sons of God: it is the office of the spirit to guide us
into all truth: and it is our great duty to follow his guidance. Hence it is
that in all enterprises, and undertakements the people of God so earnestly beg
direction and counsel from him: Lead me O Lord in thy righteousness, (says
David) make thy way straight before my face, Psalm. 8. 5. they dare not in
doubtful cases lean to their own understandings: yea, in points of duty, and in
points of sin; they dare not neglect the one, or commit the other, against the
convictions, and persuasions of their own consciences: though troubles and
sufferings be unavoidable in that path of duty; when they have balanced duties
with sufferings in their most serious thoughts, the conclusion and result will
still be, it is better to obey God than man, the dictates of the spirit rather
than the counsels of flesh and blood.

But before I leave this point, I reckon my self a debtor unto weak Christians,
and shall endeavor to give satisfaction to some special doubts and fears with
which their minds are ordinarily entangled in this matter: for it is a very
plain case, that many souls have the presence and sanctification of the spirit
without the evidence and comfort thereof. Diverse things are found in believers
which are as so many fountains of fears, and doubts to them. And

First, I greatly doubt the spirit of God is not in me Obj. 1.
(says a poor Christian) because of the great darkness, and ignorance which
clouds my soul: for I read 1 John 2. 27. that he enlightneth the soul which he
inhabiteth: the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye
need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you of all
things, etc. but alas, my understanding is weak and cloudy, I have need to
learn of the meanest of Gods people: this only I know, that I know nothing as I
ought to know.

Two things are to be respected in spiritual knowledge; Sol.
viz. the quantity and the efficacy thereof: your condition does not so much
depend upon the measures of knowledge, for happily, you are under many natural
disadvantages, and want those helps and means of increasing knowledge, which
others plentifully enjoy: it may be you have wanted the helps of education, or
have been encumbered by the necessities and cares of the world; which have
allowed you but little leisure for the improvement of your minds: but if that
which you do know be turned into practice and obedience, Col. 1. 9, 10. if it
have influence upon your hearts, and transform your affections into a spiritual
frame and temper, 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18. if your ignorance humble you, and drive you
to God daily for the increase of knowledge: one drop of such knowledge of
Christ and your selves as this, is more worth than a Sea of humane, moral,
unsanctified, and speculative knowledge: though you know but little, yet that
little being sanctified is of great value: though you know but little, time was
when ye knew nothing of Jesus Christ, or the state of your own souls. In a
word, though you know but little, that little you do know will be still
increasing, like the morning light, which shines more and more unto the
perfect day, Prove. 4. 18. If thou know so much as brings thee to Christ,
thou shall shortly be where thy knowledge shall be as the light at noon day.

I sometime find my heart raised, and my affections melted Obj. 2.
in duties, but I doubt it is but in a natural way, and not from the spirit of
God: could I be assured those motions of my heart were from the spirit of
grace, and not merely a natural thing, it would be singular comfort and
satisfaction to me.

First, Consider, whether this be not the ground of your Sol.
fear and doubting, because you are fain to take pains in the way of
meditation, prayer, and other duties to bring your hearts to sense and savor
the things of God: whereas, it may be you expect your spiritual enlargements
and comforts should flow in upon you spontaneously, and drop from heaven
immediately of their own accord; without any pains or industry of yours: here
may be, (and probably is) a great mistake in this matter; for the spirit of God
works in the natural method, wherein affections use to be raised; and makes use
of such duties as meditation and prayer as instruments to do that work by,
Ezech. 36. 37. So* David was forced to reason with, and chide his own heart:
Psalm. 42. 5. thy comfort and enlargement may nevertheless be the fruit of the
spirit, because God makes it spring up, and grow upon thy duties.

Secondly, Take this as a sure rule, whatsoever rises from self always aims
at and terminates in self: this stream cannot be carried higher than the
fountain, if therefore thy aim and end in striving for affections and
enlargements in duty, be only to win applause from men, and appear to be what
in reality thou art not, this indeed is the fruit of nature, and a very corrupt
and hypocritical nature too; but if thy heart be not melted, or desire to be
melted in the sense of the evil of sin in order to the farther mortification of
it; and under the apprehensions of the free grace and mercy of God in the
pardon of sin, in order to the engaging of thy soul more firmly to him: if
these or such like be thy ends and designs, or be promoted and furthered by
thine enlargements and spiritual comforts, never reject them as the mere fruits
of nature; a carnal root cannot bring forth such fruits as these.

Upon the Contrary, Spiritual deadness, and indisposedness Obj. 3.
to duties, and to those especially which are more secret, spiritual, and
self-denying than others, is the ground upon which many thousand souls who are
yet truly gracious, do doubt the indwelling of the spirit in them. O says such
a soul, if the spirit of God be in me, Why is it thus? Could my heart be so
dead, so backward, and averse to spiritual duties? no, no, these things would
be my meat, and my drink; the delights and pleasures of my life.

First, These things indeed are very sad, and argue thy Sol.
heart to be out of frame; as the body is when it cannot relish the most
desirable meats, or drinks: but the question will be how thy soul behaves it
self in such a condition Qui bon^m vult, and malum non vult, is studium retinet
pla^di deo: quamvis illectus concupiscentia mala, nonnunquam ex infirmitate
illud committat quod deo displicet. Davenant.
as this is, whether this be easy or burdensome to be born by thee: and if
thou complain under it as a burden; then what pains thou take to ease thy
self, and get rid of it.

Secondly, Know also that there is a great difference betwixt spiritual death,
and spiritual deadness: the former is the state of the unregenerate; the latter
is the disease and complaint of many thousand regenerate souls: If David had
not felt it as well as thee, he would never have cried out nine times in the
compass of one Psalm, Quicken me, quicken me. Besides,

Thirdly, Though it be often, it is not always so with thee: there are seasons
wherein the Lord breaks in upon thy heart, enlarges thy affections; and sets
thy soul at liberty: to which times thou will do well to have an eye, in these
dark and cloudy days.

But the Spirit of God is a comforter as well as a sanctifier: Obj. 4.
he does not only enable men to believe, but after they believe he also* seals
them, Ephesians. 1. 13. but I walk in darkness, and am a stranger to the sealing, and
comforting work of the spirit: how therefore can I imagine the spirit of God
should dwell in me, who go from day to day in the bitterness of my soul,
mourning as without the Sun?

There is a twofold sealing, and a twofold comfort: the Sol.
spirit seals both objectively in the work of sanctification, and formally in
giving clear evidence of that work: thou may be sealed in the first, whilst
thou art not yet sealed in the second sense: if so, thy condition is safe,
although it be at present uncomfortable. And as to comfort, that also is of two
sorts, viz. seminal, or actual: in the root, or in the fruit: light is sown for
the righteous, Psalm. 97. 11. though the harvest to reap and gather in that Joy
and Comfort be not yet come; and there are many other ways beside that of joy
and comfort, whereby the indwelling of the spirit may evidence it self in thy
soul: if he do not enable thee to rejoice, yet if he enable thee sincerely to
mourn for sin; if he do not enlarge thy heart in Comfort, yet if he humble and
purge thy heart by sorrows; if he deny thee the assurance of faith, and yet
give thee the dependence of faith, thou have no reason to call in question, or
deny the indwelling of the spirit in thee for that cause.

But the Apostle says, they that walk in the spirit do not fulfill Obj. 5.
the Lusts of the flesh, Gal. 5. 16. but I find my self entangled, and
frequently overcome by them, therefore I doubt the spirit of God is not in me.

It Is possible the ground of your doubting may be your Sol.
mistake of the true sense and meaning of that Scripture: it is not the
Apostles meaning in that place that sin in believers does not work, tempt, and
oftentimes overcome, and captivate them: for then he would contradict himself
in Romans 7. 23. where he thus complains, but I see another Law in my members
warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law
of sin which is in my members: but two things are meant by that expression, you
shall not fulfill the Lusts of the flesh.

First, That the principle of grace will give cheque to sin in its first
motions, and cause it to miscarry in the womb like an untimely birth, before it
comes to its full maturity: it shall never be able to gain the full consent of
the will as it does in the unregenerate.

Secondly, if notwithstanding all the opposition grace makes to hinder the
birth, or commission of it, it do yet prevail, and break forth into act; yet
such acts of sin as they are not committed without regret, so they are followed
with shame, sorrow, and true repentance: and those very surprizals, and
captivities of sin at one time, are made cautions, and warnings to prevent it
at another time: if it be so with thee, thou do not fulfill the Lusts of the
flesh.

And now Reader, upon the whole; if upon examination of thy heart by these
rules, the Lord shall help thee to discern the saving work of his spirit upon
thy soul, and thereby thine interest in Christ, what a happy man or woman art
thou! what pleasure will arise to thy soul from such a discovery! Look upon the
frame of thine heart absolutely as it is in it self at present, or
comparatively with what once it was and others still are, and thou will find
enough to transport and melt thy heart within thee: certainly this is the most
glorious piece of Workmanship that ever God wrought in the world upon any man:
Ephesians. 2. 10. the spirit of God is come down from heaven, and has hallowed thy
soul to be a Temple for himself to dwell in: as he has said, I will dwell in
them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people, 2
Cor. 7. 16. Moreover this gift of the spirit is a sure pledge, and earnest of
thy future glory: time was when there was no such work upon thy soul, and
considering the frame and temper of it, the total aversation, strong
opposition, and rooted enmity that was in it; it is the wonder of wonders that
ever such a work as this should be wrought upon such an heart as thine: that
ever the spirit of God whose nature is pure and perfect holiness, should choose
such an unclean, polluted, abominable heart to frame an habitation for himself
there to dwell in: to say of thy soul (now his spiritual Temple) as he once
said of the material Temple at Jerusalem, Psalm. 132. 13, 14. The Lord has
chosen it, he has desired it for his habitation; this is my rest for ever,
here will I dwell, for I have desired it. O what has God done for thy soul!

Think Reader, and think again; are there not many thousands in the world of
more ingenuous, sweet, and amiable disposition than thy self, whom yet the
spirit of God passes by, and leaves them as Tabernacles for Sat^ to dwell in?
such a one thou lately wast, and had still remained, if God had not wrought
for thee, beyond all the expectation, and desires of thine own heart. O bless
God that you have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is
of God; that ye might know the things which are freely given unto you of God.

The Twenty fifth SERMON. Sermon 25.

2 COR. 5. 17. Text.
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature: Of the nature and
necessity of the New Creature.
old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.
YOU have seen one trial of an interest in Christ in our last discourse, namely
by the donation of the Spirit: we have here another Trial of the same matter,
from one of the greatest, and most noble effects of the Spirit upon our souls;
namely, his work of renovation, or new creation: if any man be in Christ, he is
a new Creature. The Apostles scope in the immediate context is to dissuade
Christians from a carnal, sinful partiality, in their respects to men: not to
dispense them after the manner of the world, according to the external
differences, but the real internal worth and excellency that is in men. This
the Apostle presses by two arguments; one drawn from the end of Christ's death,
verse 15. which was to take us off from those selfish designs, and carnal ends
by which the world is swayed. Secondly, from the new spirit by which believers
are acted: they that are in Christ, are to judge and measure all things by a
new rule: if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature: old things are passed
away: q. d. we have done with that low selfish spirit of the world which was
wholly governed by Carnal interest; we are now to judge by a new rule, to be
acted from a new principle, aim at a new, and more noble end: behold all things
are become new. In these words we have three general parts to be distinctly
considered.

viz. 1. The great question to be determined, if any man be in Christ. 2. The
Rule by which it may be determined, viz. he is a new Creature. 3. This general
rule more particularly explained, old things are passed away, behold all things
are become new.

First, We have here the great question to be determined, Whether a man be in
Christ? a question upon the determination 1.
whereof we must stand or fall for ever: by [being in Christ] the Apostle does
not here mean the general profession of Christianity which gives a man the
reputation of an interest in him: but by being in Christ he means an interest
in him by vital union with his person, and real participation of his benefits:
now this is the question to be determined, the matter to be tried, than which
nothing can be more solemn, and important in the whole world.

Secondly, The rule by which this great question may be 2.
determined, viz. The new Creation: if any man be in Christ he is a new
Creature: by this rule all the titles and claims made to Christ in the
professing world are to be examined [if any man] be he what he will, high, or
low; great, or small; learned, or illiterate; young, or old; if he pretend
interest in Christ: this is the standard by which he must be tried: if he be in
Christ, he is a new Creature; and if he be not a new Creature, he is not in
Christ: let his endowments, gifts, confidence, and reputation be what it will
be: [a new Creature] not new Physically, he is the same person he was, but a
new Creature, that is, a creature renewed by gracious principles newly infused
into him from above, which sway him and guide him in another manner, and to
another end than ever he acted before: and these gracious principles not being
educed out of any thing which was preexistent in man, but infused de novo, from
above, are therefore called in this place, a new Creature: this is the rule by
which our claim to Christ must be determined.

Thirdly, This general rule is here more particularly explained, 3.
old things are passed away, behold all things are become new: he satisfies not
himself to lay down this rule concisely, or express it in general terms by
telling us the man in Christ must be a new Creature, but more particularly, he
shows us what this new creature is, and what the parts thereof are, viz.

Both the 1. Privative part, old things are passed away. 2. Positive part
thereof, all things are become new.

By old things he means all those carnal principles, self ends, fleshly lusts
belonging to the carnal state, or the old man: all these are passed away; not
simply, and perfectly, but only in Non simpliciter, and perfect, sed partim
re, partim spe. Estius in loc.
part at present, and wholly in hope, and expectation hereafter. So much
briefly of the privative part of the new Creature: old things are passed away:
a word or two must be spoken of the positive part, all things are become new.
He means not that the old faculties of the soul are abolished, and new ones
created in their room: but as our bodies may be said to be new bodies by reason
of their new endowments, and qualities super-induced and bestowed upon them in
their resurrection; so our souls are now renewed by the infusion of new
gracious principles into them in the work of regeneration. These two parts,
viz. the privative part, the passing away of old things; and the positive part,
the renewing of all things, do betwixt them comprize the whole nature of
sanctification, which in other Scriptures is expressed by equivalent phrases:
sometimes by putting off the old, and putting on the new man, Ephesians. 4. 24.
sometimes by dying unto sin, and living unto righteousness, Romans 6. 11. which
is the self-same thing the Apostle here intends by the passing away of old
things, and making all things new: and because this is the most excellent,
glorious, and admirable work of the spirit which is or can be wrought upon man
in this world; therefore the Apostle asserts it with an Ecce, a note of special
remarque and observation, behold all things are become new, q. d. behold and
admire this surprising mavelous change which God has made upon men: they are
come out of darkness into his mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2. 9. out of the old, as
it were, into a new world, behold all things are become new.

Hence Note,

DOCT.
That Gods creating of a new supernatural work of grace in the Doct.
soul of any man, is that man's sure and infallible evidence of a saving
interest in Jesus Christ.

Suitable hereunto are those words of the Apostle, Ephesians. 4. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him, and have
been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off concerning the
former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts:
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man which
after God is created in righteousness and true holiness: where we have in other
words of the same importance, the very self-same description of the man that is
in Christ, which the Aposte gives us in this Text. Now for the opening and
stating of this point, it will be necessary that I show you,

1. Why the regenerating work of the Spirit is called a new Creation. 2. In
what respects every soul that is in Christ is renewed or made a new Creature.
3. What are the remarkable properties, and qualities of this new Creature. 4.
The necessity of this new Creation to all that are in Christ. 5. How this new
Creation evidences our interest in Christ. 6. And then Apply the whole in the
proper uses of it.
First, Why the regenerating work of the spirit is called a 1.
new Creation: this must be our first enquiry: and doubtless the reason of this
appellation is the Analogy, proportion, and similitude which is found betwixt
the work of regeneration, and Gods work in the first Creation: and their
agreement, and proportion will be found in the following particulars.

First, The same Almighty Author who created the world, creates also this work
of grace in the soul of man, 2 Cor. 4. 6. God who commanded the light to shine
out of darkness, has shined into our hearts, to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ: the same powerful
word which created the natural, creates also the spiritual light: it is
equally absurd for any man to say, I make my self Minus el, te fecisse hominem,
quam sanctum.
to repent, or to believe, as it is to say, I made my self to exist and be.

Secondly, The first thing that God created in the natural world was light,
Genesis 1. 3. and the first thing which God creates in the new Creation is the
light of spiritual knowledge, Col. 3. 10. And have put on the new man which is
renewed in knowledge after the image of him that Created him.

Thirdly, Creation is out of nothing: it requires no preexistent matter: it
does not bring one thing out of another, but something out of nothing: it gives
a being to that which before had no being. So it is also in the new Creation; 1
Pet. 2. 9, 10. who has called you out of darkness, into his mavelous light;
which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had
not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy: the work of grace is not
educed out of the power, and principles of nature; but is a pure work of
creation. The heathen Philosophers could neither understand, nor acknowledge
the creation of the world, because that notion was repugnant to this maxim of
reason, ex nihilo nihil fit, out of nothing, nothing can be made: thus did they
insanire cum ratione, befool themselves with their own reasonings: and after
the same manner some great pretenders to reason among us, voting it an
absurdity to affirm, that the work of grace is not virtually, and potentially
contained in nature; the new Creation in the old.

Fourthly, It was the virtue, and efficacy of the spirit of God which gave the
natural world its being by Creation, Genesis 1. 2. the spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters; it hovered over the chaos; as the wings of a bird do
over her eggs, as the same word is rendered, Deuteronomy. 32. 11. cherishing as it were
by incubation, that rude mass by a secret quickening influence, by which it
drew all the Creatures into their several forms, and particular natures. So it
is in the new Creation: a quickening influence must come from the spirit of God,
or else the new creature can never be formed in us, Joh. 3. 8. So is every one
that is born of the Spirit: and ver. 6. that which is born of the spirit is
spirit.

Fifthly, The word of God was the instrument of the first creation, Psalm. 33.
6, 9. By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the host of them
by the breath of his mouth: for he spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and it
stood fast: the word of God is also the instrument of the new Creation or work
of Grace in man, 1 Pet. 1. 23. Being born again not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible; by the word of God which lives, and abides for ever. So James
1. 18. Of his own will beg at he us, with the word of truth: of his own will,
that was the impulsive cause; with the word of truth, that is the instrumental
cause: great respect and honor, love and delight is due to the word upon this
account, that it is the instrument of our regeneration, or new Creation.

Sixthly, The same power which created the world, still under-props and
supports it in its being: the world owes its conservation, as well as its
existence to the power of God, without which it could not subsist one moment.
Just so it is with the new Creation, which entirely depends upon the preserving
power which first formed it, Jude ver. 1. Preserved in Christ Jesus; and 1 Pet.
1. 5. Who were kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation: as in a
natural way we live, move, and have our being in God, Acts 17. 28. so in a
spiritual way, we continue believing, repenting, loving, and delighting in God;
without whose continued influence upon our souls we could do neither.

Seventhly, In a word, God surveyed the first Creation with complacence and
great delight: he beheld the work of his hands and approved them as very good,
Genesis 1. 31. so is it also in the second creation; nothing pleases, and
delights God more than the works of grace in the souls of his people: it is not
any outward privilege of nature, or gift of Providence which commends any man
to God: circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but a new
creature, Gal. 6. 15. And thus you see, upon what grounds the work of
regeneration in man is styled a new Creature, which was the first thing to be
opened.

Secondly, Next we must enquire in what respects every soul that is in Christ
is renewed, or made a new Creature: 2.
and here we shall find a threefold renovation of every man that is in Christ,
viz.

He is renewed 1. In his state and Condition. 2. In his frame and Constitution.
3. In his practice and Conversation.

First, He is renewed in his state and condition, for he passes from death to
life, in his Justification, 1 John 3. 14. he was condemned by the Law, he is
now Justified freely by grace through the redemption which is in Christ: he was
under the curse of the first Covenant; he is under the blessing of the new
Covenant: he was afar off, but is now made nigh unto God: an alien, a stranger
once, now of the household of God, Ephesians. 2. 12, 13. O blessed change from a sad,
to a sweet and comfortable condition! There is therefore now no condemnation to
them which are in Christ Jesus, Romans 8. 1.

Secondly, Every man in Christ is renewed in his frame, and constitution: all
the faculties and affections of his soul are renewed by regeneration: his
understanding was dark, but now is light in the Lord, Ephesians. 5. 8. his conscience
was dead and secure, or full of guilt and horror; but is now become tender,
watchful, and full of peace, Heb. 9. 14. his will was rebellious, stubborn, and
inflexible; but is now made obedient, and complying with the will of God, Psalm.
110. 2. his desires did once pant, and spend themselves in the pursuit of
vanities, now they are set upon God, Isa. 26. 8. his Love did fondly dote upon
ensnaring earthly objects, now it is swallowed up in the infinite excellencies
of God, and Christ, Psalm. 119. 97. his joy was once in trifles, and things of
naught; now his rejoicing is in Christ Jesus, Phil. 3. 3. his fears once were
versant about noxious creatures, now God is the object of the fear of
reverence, Act. 9. 31. and sin the object of the fear of caution, 2 Cor. 7. 11.
his hopes and expectations were only from the world present, but now, from that
to come, Heb. 6. 19. Thus the soul in its faculties, and affections is renewed;
which being done, the members and senses of the body must needs be destinated,
and employed by it in new services: no more to be the weapons of
unrighteousness, but instruments of service to Jesus Christ, Romans 6. 19. and
thus all that are in Christ are renewed in their frame and constitution.

Thirdly, The man in Christ is renewed in his practice and Conversation: the
manner of operation always follows the nature of beings: now the regenerate
not being what they were, cannot walk and act, as once they did: Ephesians. 2. 1, 2,
3. And you has he quickened, who were once dead in trespasses and sins; wherein
ye walked according to the course of this world, etc. they were carried away
like water by the strength of the tide, by the influence of their own corrupt
natures, and the customs and examples of the world: but the case is now
altered. So in 1 Cor. 6. 11. the Apostle shows believers their old companions
in sin, and tells them such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, etc. q. d. the world is now well altered with you, thanks be to the
grace of God for it. This wonderful change of practice which is so universal,
and remarkable in all the regenerate, and immediately consequent to their
conversion, sets the world a wondering at them: 1 Pet. 4. 4. Wherein they think
it strange that (...) Obstupescent ut ad rei inusitatae spectaculum. Beza. Ils
se trouvent tous nouveaux and comme en (...) autre monde.
you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: they
think it strange, the word signifies to stand at gaze, as the hen does which
has brooded, and hatched Partridge Eggs, when she sees the Chickens which she
has brought forth, take the wing and fly away from her: thus do the men of the
world stand amazed to see their old companions in sin, whose language once was
vain, and earthly; it may be profane, and filthy; now to be praying, speaking
of God, Heaven, and things spiritual; having no more to do with them as to sin,
except by way of reprehension and admonition: this amazes the world, and makes
them look with a strange admiring eye upon the people of God.

Thirdly, In the next place let us enquire into the properties, 3.
and qualities of this new creature, and show you as we are able what they are:
yet Reader, expect not here an exact and accurate account of that which is so
great a mystery: for if questions may be moved about a silly fly, which may
puzzle the greatest Philosopher to resolve them: how much more may we conceive
this great and mavelous work of God, the most mysterious, and admirable of
all his works, to surmount the understandings of the most illuminated
Christians? O how little do we know of the nature, properties, and operations
of this new Creature! so far as God has revealed it to our weak
understandings, we may speak of it. And

First, The Scripture speaks of it as a thing of great difficulty to be
conceived by man: Joh. 3. 8. The wind blows where it lists, and thou
hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, and whither it
goes: so is every one that is born of the spirit. The original of winds is a
question of great difficulty in Philosophy: we hear the voice of the wind, feel
its mighty force, and behold its strange effects; but neither know whence it
comes, or whither it goes: ask a man, Do you hear the wind blow? yes: do you
feel it blow? yes, very sensibly: do you see the effects of it rending and
overturning the trees? yes, very plainly: but can you describe its nature, or
declare its original? no, that is a mystery which I do not understand: why fo;
Just so it is with him that is born of the spirit: the holy spirit of God,
whose nature and operations we understand but little of, comes from heaven,
quickens, and influences our souls, beats down and mortifies our lusts by his
almighty power: these effects of the spirit in us we experimentally feel, and
sensibly discern; but how the spirit of God first entered into, and quickened our
souls, and produced this new creature in them, we understand little more of it,
than how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with Child, Eccles. 11.
5. Therefore is the life of the new creature called a hidden life, Col. 3. 3.
the nature of that life is not only hidden totally from all carnal men, but in
a very great measure it is an hidden and unknown life unto spiritual men,
though themselves be the subjects of it.

Secondly, But though this life of the new Creature be a great mystery, and
secret in some respects, yet so far as it is (...) ^ppears unto us, the new
creature is the most (...) lovely creature that ever God made: for the (...)
himself is upon it: the new man is created (...) 24. as the picture is drawn
after the man: (...) God himself, delineated by the spirit, that admirable
Artist, upon the soul of man: holiness is the beauty and glory of God: and in
holiness the new creature is created after Gods own image, Col. 3. 10. the
regenerate soul hereby becomes holy, 1 John 3. 3. not essentially holy as God
is, nor yet efficiently holy: for the regenerate soul can neither make it self,
nor others holy: but the life of the new creature may be said to resemble the
life of God in this, that as God lives to himself, so the new creature wholly
lives to God: as God loves holiness, and hates the contrary, so does the new
creature: it is in these things formed after the image of him that created it:
when God creates this creature in the soul of man, we are said then to be
partakers of the divine nature, 2 Pet. 1. 4. so that there can be nothing
communicated unto men, which beautifies and adorns their souls as this new
creation does: men do not resemble God as they are noble, and as they are rich,
but as they are holy: no gift, no endowment of nature imbelishes the soul, as
this new creature does: an awful Majesty sits upon the brow of the new
creature, commanding the greatest, and worst of men to do homage to it, Mark 6.
20. yea such is the beauty of the new creature that Christ its Author is also
its admirer: Cant. 4. 9. Thou have ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes.

Thirdly, This New Creature is created in man upon the highest design that ever
any work of God was wrought: the end of its creation and infusion is high and
noble: Salvation to the soul in which it is wrought: this is both the finis
operis, and the finis operantis: it is the design both of the work, and of the
workman that wrought it: when we receive the end of our faith, we receive the
salvation of our souls. Salvation is the end faith: as death is the end of sin,
so life eternal is the end of grace. The new creature does by the instinct and
steady direction of its own nature, take its course as directly to God, and to
heaven the place of his full enjoyment, as the Rivers do to the Ocean: it
declares it self to be made for God, by its restless workings after him: and as
salvation is the end of the new creature, so it is the express design and end
of him that created it: 2 Cor. 5. 5. Now he that has wrought us for the self
same thing is God: by this workmanship of his upon our souls he is now
polishing, preparing, and making them meet to be partakers of the inheritance
of the Saints in light, Col. 1. 12.

Fourthly, The new Creation is the most necessary work that ever God wrought
upon the soul of man: the eternal well-being of his soul depends upon it; and
without it no man shall see God: Heb. 12. 14. and Joh. 1. 3, 5. Except ye be
regenerate, and born again, ye cannot see the Kingdom of God: can you be saved
without Christ? you know you cannot: can you have interest in Christ without
the new creature? my Text expressly tells you it can never be: for if any man
be in Christ, he is a new creature. O Reader, what ever slight thoughts of this
matter, and with what a careless and unconcerned eye soever thou read these
lines; yet know thou must either be a new creature, or a miserable and damned
creature for ever. If civility without the new creature could save thee, why
are not the moral Heathens saved also? if strictness of life without the new
creature could save thee, why did it not save the Scribes and Pharisees also?
if an high profession of Religion without the new creature can save thee, why
did it not save Judas, Hymeneus, and Philetus also? Nothing is more evident
than this, that no repentance, obedience, self-denial, prayers, tears,
reformations, or ordinances without the new creation avail any thing to the
salvation of thy soul: the very blood of Christ himself without the new
creature never did, and never will save any man. Oh how necessary a work is the
new creation! circumcision avails nothing, and uncircumcision nothing, but a
new creature.

Fifthly, The new Creature is a mavelous and wonderful creature: there are
many wonders in the first creation: the works of the Lord are great, sought out
of all them that have pleasure therein, Psalm. 111. 2. but there are no wonders
in nature, like those in grace: is it not the greatest wonder that ever was
seen in the world (except the incarnation of the Son of God) to see the nature,
and temper of man, so altered and changed as it is by grace: to see Lascivious
Corinthians, and Idolatrous Ephesians become mortified and Heavenly Christians:
to see a fierce and cruel persecutor, become a glorious confessor and sufferer
for Christ, Gal. 1. 23. to see the carnal-mind of man which was lately fully
set in a strong bent to the world, to be wholly taken off from its lusts, and
set upon things that are spiritual and heavenly: certainly it was not a greater
miracle to see dead Lazarus come out of his Sepulcher, than it is to see the
dead and carnal mind coming out of its Lusts, to embrace Jesus Christ. It was
not a greater wonder to see the dead dry bones in the valley to move, and come
together, than it is to see a dead soul moving after God, and moving to Christ
in the way of faith.

Sixthly, The new creature is an immortal creature, a creature that shall never
see death, Joh. 4. 14. it is in the soul of man a well of water, springing up
into eternal life. I will not adventure to say it is immortal in its own
nature, for it is but a creature, as my Text calls it, and we know that
essential interminability is the incommunicable property of God: the new
creature has both a beginning, and succession, and therefore might also have
an end, as to any thing in it self, or its own nature: experience also shows us
that it is capable both of increasing and decreasing; and may be brought nigh
unto death: Rev. 3. 2. the works of the spirit in believers may be ready to
dye: but though its perpetuity flow not out of its own nature, it flows out of
Gods Covenant, and promises; which make it an immortal Creature: when all other
excellencies in man go away, as at death they will, Job 4. 21. this excellency
only remains: our gifts may leave us, our friends leave us, our estates leave
us, but our graces will never leave us: they ascend with the soul (in which
they inhere) into glory, when the stroke of death separates it from the body.

Seventhly, The new Creature is an heavenly creature: it is not born of flesh,
nor of blood, or of the will of man, but of God, Joh. 1. 13. its descent and
original is heavenly, it is spirit born of spirit, Joh. 3. 6. its center is
heaven, and thither are all its tendencies, Psalm. 63. 8. its proper food on
which it lives are heavenly things, Psalm. 4. 6, 7. it cannot feed as other
creatures do upon earthly things: the object of all its delights and loves is
in heaven, Psalm. 73. 26. Whom have I in heaven but thee? the hopes and
expectations of the new creature are all from heaven: it looks for little in
this world, but waits for the coming of the Lord: the life of the new creature
upon earth is a life of patient waiting for Christ: his desires and longings
are after Heaven, Phil. 1. 23. The flesh indeed lingers and would delay, but
the new creature hastens and would fain be gone: 2 Cor. 5. 2. it is not at home
while it is here; it came from Heaven and cannot be quiet nor suffer the soul
in which it dwells to be so until it comes thither again.

Eighthly, The new creature is an active and laborious creature: no sooner it
is born, but it is acting in the soul, Acts 9. 6. behold he prays; activity
is its very nature, Gal. 5. 25. If we live in the spirit, let us walk in the
spirit. Nor is it to be admired that it should be always active and stirring in
the soul, seeing activity in obedience was the very end for which it was
created, for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
Ephesians. 2. 10. and he that is acted in the duties of Religion by this principle of
the new creature or nature, will (so far as that principle acts him) delight to
do the will of God; rejoice in the way of his Commandments; and find the
sweetest pleasure in the paths of duty.

Ninthly, The new creature is a thriving creature, growing from strength to
strength, 1 Pet. 2. 2. and changing the soul in which it is subjected from
glory unto glory, 2 Cor. 3. 18. The vigorous tendencies and constant strivings
of this new creature is to attain its just perfection and maturity; Phil. 3.
11. it can endure no stints and limits to its desires short of perfection:
every degree of strength it attains, does but whet and sharpen his desires
after higher degrees: upon this account it greatly delights in the Ordinances
of God, Duties of Religion and Society of the Saints; as they are helps and
improvements to it in order to its great design.

Tenthly, The new creature is a creature of wonderful preservations: there are
many wonders of divine providence in Gratia nec totaliter intermittitur, nec
finaliter amittitur: actus omittitur, habitus non amittitur: actio pervertitur,
fides no^ s^bvertitur: concutitur, non excutitur; defl^it fructus, lat^ succus:
effectus justificationis suspenditur, at ^tus justificati non dissolvitur.
Suffrag. Brit.
the preservation of our natural lives, but none like those whereby the life of
the new creature is preserved in our souls: there are critical times of
temptation and desertion in which it is ready to dye, Rev. 3. 2. the degrees of
its strength and liveliness are sometimes sadly abated, and (...) sweet and
comfortable workings intermitted, Rev. 2. 4. the evidences by which its being
in us was wont to be discovered, may be, and often are darkened, 2 Pet. 1. 9.
and the soul in which it is may draw very sad conclusions about the issue and
event; concluding its life not only to be hazarded but quite extinguished,
Psalm. 51. 10, 11, 12. but though it be ready to dye, God wonderfully preserves
it from death: it has as well its reviving as its fainting seasons: and thus
you see what are the lovely and eximious properties of the new creature: In the
next place,

Fourthly, We will demonstrate the necessity of this new creation to all that
are in Christ, and by him expect to attain 4.
salvation: and the necessity of the new creature will appear diverse ways.

First, From the positive and express will of God revealed in Scripture
touching this matter: search the Scriptures and you shall find God has laid
the whole stress and weight of your eternal happiness by Jesus Christ upon this
work of the spirit in your souls. So our Savior tells Nicodemus, John 3. 5.
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water, and of the
spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: agreeable whereunto are those
words of the Apostle, Heb. 12. 14. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.
And whereas some may think that their birth right privileges, enjoyment of
Ordinances and profession of Religion may commend them to Gods acceptance
without this new creation; he shows them how fond and ungrounded all such hopes
are, Gal. 6. 15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing,
nor uncircumcision, but a new creature: Christ and Heaven are the gifts of God,
and he is at liberty to bestow them upon what terms and conditions he pleases:
and this is the way, the only way and stated method in which he will bring men
by Christ unto glory: men may raze out the impressions of these things from
their own hearts, but they can never alter the settled course and method of
Salvation: either we must be new creatures, as the precepts of the word command
us, or lost and damned creatures as the threatenings of the word plainly tell us.

Secondly, This new Creation is the inchoative part of that great Salvation
which we expect through Christ, and therefore without this all hopes and
expectations of Salvation must vanish: Salvation and renovation are inseparably
connected. Our glory in Heaven, if we rightly understand its nature, consists
in two things; namely our assimilation to God, and our fruition of God: and
both these take their beginning and rise from our renovation in this world:
here we begin to be changed into his Image in some degree, 2 Cor. 3. 18. for
the new man is created after God, as was opened above. In the work of grace God
is said to begin that good work which is to be finished or consummated in the
day of Christ, Phil. 1. 6. Now nothing can be more irrational than to imagine
that ever that design or work should be finished and perfected which never had
a beginning.

Thirdly, So necessary is the new creation to all that expect salvation by
Christ, that without this Heaven would be no Heaven, and the glory thereof no
glory to us, by reason of the unsuitableness and aversation of our carnal minds
thereunto: the carnal mind is enmity against God, Romans 8. 7. and enmity is
exclusive of all complacency and delight: there is a necessity of a suitable
and agreeable frame of heart to God in order to that complacential rest of our
souls in him: and this agreeable temper is wrought by our new creation, 2 Cor.
5. 5. He that has wrought us for the self-same thing is God: renovation you
see is the working or moulding of a man's spirit into an agreeable temper: or as
it is in Col. 1. 12. the making of us meet for the inheritance of the Saints in
light.

From all which it follows, that seeing there can be no complacence or delight
in God without suitableness and conformity to him, as is plain from 1 John 3.
2. as well as from the reason and nature of the thing it self: either God must
become like us suitable to our sinful, corrupt and vain hearts, which were but
a rude blasphemy once to imagine; or else we must be made agreeable and
suitable to God, which is the very thing I am now proving the necessity of.

Fourthly, There is an absolute necessity of the new creature to all that
expect interest in Christ and the glory to come: since all the characters,
marks and signs of such an interest are constantly taken from the new creature
wrought in us. Look over all the marks and signs of interest in Christ or
salvation by him which are dispersed through the Scriptures, and you shall
still find purity of heart, Matthew. 5. 8. holiness both in principle and
practice, Heb. 12. 14. mortification of sin, Romans 8. 13. longing for Christ's
appearance, 2 Timothy 4. 8. with multitudes more of the same nature, to be
constantly made the marks and signs of our salvation by Christ. So that either
we must have a new Bible or a new Heart: for if these Scriptures be the true
and faithful words of God, no unrenewed creature can see his face; which was
the fourth thing to be opened.

Fifthly, The last thing to be opened is how the new creation is an infallible
proof and evidence of the souls interest 5.
in Christ: and this will appear diverse ways.

First, Where all the saving graces of the spirit are, there interest in Christ
must needs be certain; and where the new creature is, there all the saving
graces of the spirit are: for what is the new creature but the frame or Systeme
of all special saving graces: it is not this or that particular grace, as
faith, or hope, or love to God, which constitutes the new creature, for these
are but as so many particular limbs or branches of it: but the new creature is
comprehensive of all the graces of the Spirit, Gal. 5. 22, 23. The fruit of the
Spirit is love, peace, joy, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance, etc. any one of the saving special graces of the Spirit
gives proof of our interest in Christ: how much more then the new creature
which is the complex frame or Systeme of all the graces together?

Secondly, To conclude, where all the causes of an interest in Christ are
found, and all the effects and fruits of an interest in Christ do appear; there
undoubtedly a real interest in Christ is found: but wherever you find a new
creature, you find all the causes and all the effects of an interest in Christ:
for there you shall find,

First, The impulsive cause, viz. the electing love of God from which the new
creature is inseparable, 1 Pet. 1. 2. with the new creature also the
meritorious, efficient and final causes of interest in Christ, and union with
him are ever found, Ephesians. 2. 10. Ephesians. 1. 4, 5, 6.

Secondly, All the effects and fruits of interest in Christ are found with the
new creature: there are all the fruits of obedience, for we are created in
Christ Jesus unto good works, Ephesians. 2. 10. Romans 7. 4. there is true spiritual
opposition to sin, 1 John 5. 18. He that is begotten of God keeps himself,
and that wicked one touches him not: there is love to the people of God, 1 John 4. 7. every one that loves is born of God: there is a conscientious
respect to the duties of both Tables; for the new creature is created after God
in righteousness and true holiness, Ephesians. 4. 24. there is perseverance in the
ways of God to the very end, and victory over all temptations: for whosoever is
born of God overcomes the world, 1 John 5. 4. It were easy to run over all
other particular fruits of our union with Christ, and show you every one of
them in the new creature. And thus much of the Doctrinal part of this point.

The Twenty sixth SERMON. Sermon 26.

2 COR. 5. 17. Text.
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature: old things are passed
away, behold, all things are become new.
AFter the explication of the sense of this Scripture we observed,

DOCT.
That Gods creating of a new supernatural work of grace in the soul of any man,
is that man's sure and infallible evidence of a Doct.
saving interest in Jesus Christ.

You have heard why the regenerating work of the Spirit is called a new
creation; in what respect every soul in Christ is renewed; what the eximious
properties of this new creature are: the indispensibleness and necessity
thereof has been also proved: and how it evidences our interest in Christ was
cleared in the doctrinal part, which we now come to improve in the several Uses
serving for our 1. Information. 2. Conviction. 3. Examination. 4. Exhortation.
5. Consolation.



1st Use for Information.
Is the new Creature the sure and infallible evidence of our Use 1.
saving interest in Christ? from hence then we are informed,

Inference 1.
How miserable and deplorable an estate all unrenewed souls are in: who can lay
no claim to Christ during that state, and Inference 1.
therefore are under an impossibility of salvation. O Reader, if this be the
state of thy soul, better had it been for thee not to have been Gods natural
workmanship as a man, except thou be his spiritual workmanship also as a new
man. I know the Schoolmen determine otherwise, and say that damnation is rather
to be chosen than an annihilation: a miserable being is better than no being:
and it is very true with respect to the glory of God, whose justice shall
triumph for ever in the damnation of the unregenerate; but with respect to us,
it is much better never to have been his creatures in the way of generation,
than not to be his new creatures in the way of regeneration. So Christ speaks
of Judas, that Son of perdition, Mark 14. 21. Good had it been for that man if
he had never been born: for what is a being without the comfort of it? What is
life without the joy and pleasure of life? A damned being is a being without
comfort, no glimps of light shines into that darkness: they shall indeed see
and understand the felicity, light and joy of the Saints in glory: but not
partake in the least measure of the comfort, Luk^ 13. 28. They shall see
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of God, but they themselves shut
out: such a sight is so far from giving any comfort, that it will be the
aggravation and increase of torment. O it is better to have no being at all,
than to have a being only to capacitate a man for misery: to desire death while
death flies from him, Rev. 4. 6. The opinion of the Schoolmen will never pass
for sound doctrine among the damned: think on it, Reader, and lay it to thine
heart, better thou had dyed from the womb, better the knees had prevented
thee, and the breasts which thou have sucked, than that thou should live and
dye a stranger to the new birth, or that thy Mother should bring thee forth
only to increase and fill up the number of the damned.

Inference 2.
And on the contrary we may hence learn, what cause regenerate Inference 2.
souls have to bless God for the day wherein they were born. O what a
privileged state does the new birth bring men into! It Is possible for the
present they understand it not, for many Believers are like a great Heir lying
in the Cradle that knows not to what an estate and honor he is born:
Nevertheless on the same day wherein we become new creatures by regeneration,
we have a firm title, and solid claim to all the privileges of the Sons of
God, Joh. 1. 12, 13. God becomes our Father by a treble title, not only the
Father of our beings by nature, which was all the relation we had to him
before, but our Father by Adoption and by Regeneration: which is a much sweeter
and more comfortable relation. In that day the Image of God is restored, Ephesians.
4. 24. this is both the health and beauty of the soul. In that day we are
begotten again to a lively hope, 1 Pet. 1. 3. a hope more worth than ten
thousand worlds, in the troubles of life, and in the straits of death: this is
a creature which lives for ever, and will make thy life happy for ever. Some
have kept their birthday as a festival, a day of rejoicing, but none have more
cause to rejoice that ever they were born, than those that are new born.

Inference 3.
Learn from hence that the work of grace is wholly supernatural: Inference 3.
it is a creation, and creation work is above the power of the creature: no
power but that which gave being to the world, can give a being to the new
creature: almighty power goes forth to give being to the new creature: this
creature is not born of flesh or of blood, nor of the will of man but of God,
Joh. 1. 13. the nature of this new creature speaks its original to be above the
power of nature: the very notion of a new creation spoils the proud boasts of
the great asserters of the power and ability of the will of man. When God
therefore puts the question, who makes thee to differ? and what have thou that
thou have not received? Let thy soul, Reader, answer it with all humility and
thankfulness; it is thou, Lord, thou only, that made me to differ from
another, and what I have received, I have received from thy free grace.

Inference 4.
If the work of grace be a new creation, let not the parents and friends of the
unregenerate utterly despair of the conversion of their Inference 4.
relations, how great soever their present discouragements are: if it had been
possible for a man to have seen the rude and indigested Chaos before the Spirit
of God moved upon it, would he not have said, can such a beautiful order of
beings, such a pleasant variety of creatures spring out of this dark lump?
Surely it would have been very hard for a man to have imagined it. It may be
you see no dispositions or hopeful inclinations in your friends toward God and
spiritual things; nay, possibly they are totally opposite and filled with
enmity against them; they deride and jeer all serious piety wherever they
behold it; this indeed is very sad: but yet remember the work of grace is
creation work: though there be no disposition at all in their wills, no
tenderness in their Consciences, no light or knowledge in their minds; yet God
that commanded the light to shine out of darkness, can shine into their hearts;
to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ: he can say to the dry bones, live; to the proud and stubborn
heart, come down, and yield thy self to the will of God: and if he command, the
work is done. God can make thee yet to rejoice over thy most uncomfortable
relations, to say with the Father of the Prodigal, Luke 15. 24. This my Son was
dead, and is alive again; he was lost and is found: and they began to be merry:
difficulties are for men but not for God: he works in conversion by a power
which is able to subdue all things unto it self.

Inference 5.
If none but new creatures be in Christ, how small a remnant Inference 5.
among men belong to Christ in this world! Among the multitude of rational
creatures inhabi^ing this world, how few, how very few are new creatures? It Is
the observation of the learned Mr. Brierwood, that if the world be divided into
thirty parts, nineteen parts are heathenish Idolaters; six parts Mahumetans,
and only five out of thirty, which may be in a large sense called Christians:
of which the far greater part is overspread with popish darkness: separate from
the remainder, the multitudes of profane, merely civil and hypocritical
professors of Religion; an^ how few will remain for Jesus Christ in this world?
Look over the Cities, Towns and Parishes in this populous Kingdom; and how few
shall you find that speak the language or do the works of new creatures? How
few have ever had any awakening convictions on them? And how many of those that
have been convinced have miscarried and never come to the new birth? The more
cause have they whom God has indeed regenerated to admire the riches of Gods
distinguishing mercy to them.

Inference 6.
If the change by grace be a new creation, how universal and mavelous a
change does regeneration make upon men! The new Inference 6.
Creation speaks a mavelous and universal alteration both upon the state and
tempers of men: they come out of darkness, gross, hellish darkness into light,
a mavelous and heavenly light, 1 Pet. 2. 9. Ephesians. 5. 8. their condition,
disposition and conversation (as you have heard) is all new: and yet this
mavelous change as great and universal as it is, is not alike evident and
clearly discernable in all new creatures: and the reasons are,

First, Because the work of grace is wrought in diverse methods, and manners in
the people of God. Some are changed from a state of notorious profaneness unto
serious godliness: there the change is conspicuous and very evident; all the
neighborhood rings of it: But in others it is more insensibly distilled in
their tender years by the blessing of God upon religious education, and there
it is more indiscernable.

Secondly, Though a great change be wrought, yet much natural corruption ^till
remains for their humiliation and daily exercise; and this is a ground of fear
and doubtings: they see not how such corruptions are consistent with the new
Creature.

Thirdly, In some the new Creature shows it self mostly in the affectionate
part, in desires and breathings after God; and but little in the clearness of
their understandings, and strength of their judgments: for want of which they
are entangled and kept in darkness most of their days.

Fourthly, Some Christians are more tried and exercised by temptations from
Satan than others are, and these clouds darken the work of grace in them.

Fifthly, There is great difference and variety found in the natural tempers
and constitutions of the regenerate. Some are of a more melancholy, fearful and
suspicious temper than others are, and are therefore much longer held under
doubtings and trouble of spirit. Nevertheless what differences soever these
things make, the change made by grace is a mavelous change.

Inference 7.
Lastly, How incongruous are carnal ways and courses to the spirit of
Christians? who being new creatures can never delight or Inference 7.
find pleasure in their former sinful companions and practices? Alas, those
things are now most unsuitable, loathsome and detestable, how pleasant soever
they once were: that which they counted their liberty, would now be reckoned
their greatest bondage: that which was their glory is now their shame, Romans 6.
21. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed, for the
end of those things is death: they need not be pressed by others, but will
freely confess of themselves what fools and mad men they once were: none can
censure their former conversation more severely than themselves do, 1 Timothy 1.
13, 14.

2d. Use for Conviction.
If none be in Christ but new creatures, and the new creation Use 2.
make such a ch^nge as has been described, This may convince us how many of us
deceive our selves, and run into dangerous and fatal mistakes in the greatest
concernment we have in this world. But before I fall into this use I desire
none may make a perverse and ill use of it: Let not the wicked conclude from
hence that there is no such thing as true religion in the world, or that all
who do profess it are but a pack of hypocrites: neither let the godly injure
themselves by that which is designed for their benefit, let none conclude that
seeing there are so many mistakes committed about this new creature, that
therefore assurance must needs be impossible as the Papists affirm it to be.
The proper use that should be made of this doctrine is, to undeceive false
pretenders, and to awaken all to a more deep and thorough search of their own
conditions; which being precautioned, let all men be convinced of the following
truths.

First, That the change made by civility upon such as were lewd and profane,
is in its whole kind and nature a 1.
different thing from the new creature; the power and efficacy of moral virtue
is one thing, the influence of the regenerating Spirit is quite another thing:
however some have studied to confound them. The heathens excelled in moral, and
homilitical virtues. Plato, Aristides, Seneca, and multitudes more have outvied
many professed Christians in justice, temperance, patience, etc. yet were
perfect strangers to the new creation. A man may be very strict and temperate,
free from the gross pollutions of the world: and yet a perfect stranger to
regeneration all the while. John 3. 10.

Secondly, That many strong convictions and troubles for 2.
sin may be found where the new creature is never formed. Conviction indeed is
an antecedent unto, and preparative for the new creature, as the blossoms of
the tree are to the fruit that follows them; but as fruit does not always
follow where those blossoms and flowers appear, so neither does the new
creature follow all convictions and troubles for sin. Conviction is a common
work of the Spirit both upon the elect and reprobates: but the new creature is
formed only in Gods elect. Convictions may be blasted and vanish away, and the
man that was under troubles for sin, may return again with the dog to his
vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire, 2 Pet. 2. 22.
but the new creature never perishes, nor can consist with such a return unto
sin.

Thirdly, That excellent gifts and abilities fitting men for service in the
Church of God, may be where the new creature 3.
is not, for these are promiscuously despensed by the Spirit, both to the
regenerate, and ungenerate, Mat. 7. 22. Many will say unto me in that day,
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? Gifts are attainable by study,
prayer and preaching are reduced to an art. but regeneration is wholly
supernatural. Sin in dominion is consistent with excellent gifts, but wholly
incompatible with the new creature. In a word, these things are so different in
nature from the new creature, that they often times prove the greatest bars, and
obstacles in the world to the regenerating work of the spirit. Let no man
therefore trust to things whereby multitudes deceive, and destroy their own
souls. Reader, it may cost thee many an aching head to obtain gifts, but thou will find an aching heart for sin, if ever God make thee a new creature.

Fourthly, Be convinced that multitudes of religious duties may be performed by
men in whom the new creature was never formed. Though all new creatures perform
the duties of religion, yet all that perform the duties of religion are not new
creatures: regeneration is not the only root from which the duties of religion
spring. Isa. 58. 2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a
nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they
ask of me the ordinances of justice, they take delight in approaching to God.
These are but weak and slippery foundations for men to build their confidence
and hopes upon.

3d. Use for Examination.
Next therefore, let me persuade every man to try the state of his own heart in
this matter, and closely consider, and weigh Use 3.
this great question, Am I really and indeed a new creature, or am I an old
creature still, in the new creatures dress and habit? Some light may be given
for the discovery hereof from the considerations of The 1. Antecedents of the
new Creation. 2. Concomitants 3. Consequents

First, weigh and consider well the Antecedents of the new creature: have those
things past upon your souls which ordinarily make way for the new creature in
whomsoever the Lord forms it?

First, has the Lord opened the eyes of your understanding in the knowledge of
sin, and of Christ? has he showed you both your disease and remedy by a new
light shining from heaven into your souls? Thus the Lord does wherever he
forms the new creature. Acts 26. 18.

Secondly, has he brought home the word with mighty power and efficacy upon
your hearts, to convince and humble them? this is the method in which the new
creature is produced. Romans 7. 9. 1 These. 1. 5.

Thirdly, have these convictions overturned your vain confidences, and brought
you to a great pinch, and inward distress of soul, making you to cry what shall
we do to be saved? These are the ways of the spirit in the formation of the
new creature. Acts 16. 29. Acts 2. 37. If no such antecedent works of the
spirit have passed upon your hearts, you have no ground for your confidence,
that the new creature is formed in you.

Secondly, Consider the concomitant frames and workings of spirit which
ordinarily attend the production of the new creature, and judge impartially
betwixt God and your own souls, whether they have been the very frames and
workings of your hearts.

First, have your vain spirits been composed to the greatest seriousness, and
most solemn consideration of things eternal, as the hearts of all those are
whom God regenerates? When the Lord is about this great work upon the soul of
man, whatever vanity, levity, and sinful jollity was there before, it is
banished from the heart at this time, for now heaven and hell, life and death,
are before a man's eyes, and these are the most awful and solemn things that
ever our thoughts conversed with in this world: now a man of the most airy and
pleasant constitution when brought to the sight and sense of those things,
says of laughter it is mad, and of mirth what does it? Eccles. 2. 2.

Secondly, A lowly, meek, and humble frame of heart accompanies the new
Creation: the soul is weary and heavy laden, Matthew. 11. 28. convictions of sin
have plucked down the pride and loftiness of the spirit of man, emptied him of
his vain conceits: those that were of lofty, proud, and blustering humors
before, are meekened and brought down to the very dust now: it is with them (to
speak allusively) as it was with Jerusalem, that lofty City, Isa. 29. 1. 4. Woe
to Ariel, to Ariel, the City where David dwelt; thou shall be brought down, and
shall speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust.
Ariel signifies the Lion of God, so Jerusalem in her prosperity was, other
Cities trembled at her voice, but when God brought her down by humbling
Judgments, then she whispered out of the dust: so it is in this case.

Thirdly, Alonging thirsting frame of spirit accompanies the new creation: the
desires of the soul are ardent after Christ: never did the hireling long for
the shadow, as the weary soul does for Christ, and rest in him: if no such
frames have accompanied that which you take for your new birth, you have the
greatest reason in the world to suspect your selves under a cheat.

Thirdly, Weigh well the effects and consequents of the new creature, and
consider whether such fruits as these are found in your hearts and lives.

First, Wherever the new creature is formed, there a man's course, and
conversation is changed, Ephesians. 4. 22. That ye put off concerning the former
conversation the old man which is corrupt, according to the deceitful lusts,
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind: the new creature cannot but blush
and be ashamed of the old Creatures conversation, Romans 6. 21.

Secondly, The new Creature continually opposes, and conflicts with the motions
of sin in the heart, Gal. 5. 17. The spirit lusts against the flesh: grace
can no more incorporate with sin, than oil with water: contraries cannot
consist in the same subject longer than they are fighting with each other; if
there be no conflict with sin in thy soul, or if that conflict be only betwixt
the conscience and affections, light in the one struggling with lust in the
other; thou want that fruit which should evidence thee to be a new creature.

Thirdly, The mind and affections of the new Creature are set upon heavenly and
spiritual things: Col. 3. 1, 2. Ephesians. 4. 23. Romans 8. 5. if therefore thy heart
and affections be habitually earthly, and wholly intent upon things below,
driving eagerly after the world, as the great business and end of thy life:
deceive not thy self, this is not the fruit of the New Creature, nor consistent
with it.

Fourthly, The new Creature is a praying Creature, living by its daily
Communion with God, which is its livelihood and subsistence: Zech. 12. 10. Acts
9. 11. If therefore thou be a prayerless soul, or if in all thy prayers, thou
art a stranger to Communion with God; if there be no brokenness of heart for
sin in thy confessions, no melting affections for Christ and holiness in thy
supplications; surely Satan does but baffle, and delude thy overcredulous soul;
in persuading thee that thou art a new Creature.

Fifthly, The new Creature is restless after falls into sin until it have
recovered peace and pardon, it cannot endure it self in a state of defilement
and pollution, Psalm. 51. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It is with the conscience of a new
Creature under sin, as it is with the eye when any thing offends it, it cannot
leave twinkling and watering till it have wept it out; and in the very same
restless state it is under the hiding of Gods face, and divine withdrawments:
Cant. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. If therefore thou can sin, and sin again,
without such a burdensome sense of sin, or restlesness, or solicitude how to
recover purity, and peace, with the light of Gods countenance shining as in
days past upon thy soul; delude not thy self, thou have not the signs of a new
Creature in thee.

4th. Use for Exhortation.
If the new Creation be a sound evidence of our interest in Christ, then hence
let me persuade all that are in Christ to Use 4.
evidence themselves to be so, by walking as it becomes new Creatures.

The new Creature is born from above, all its tendencies are Heavenward;
accordingly ^et your affections on things that are above, and let your
conversation be in Heaven: if you live earthly and sensual lives, as others do;
you must cross your new Creature therein, and can those acts be pleasant unto
you which are done with so much regret? wherein you must put a force upon your
own spirits, and offer a kind of violence to your own hearts? Earthly delights
and sorrows are suitable enough to the unregenerate, and sensual men of the
world: but exceedingly contrary unto that spirit by which you are renovated. If
ever you will act becoming the principles and nature of new Creatures, then
seek earthly things with submission, enjoy them with fear and caution, resign
them with cheerfulness and readiness: and thus let your moderation be known
unto all men, Phil. 4. 5. Let your hearts daily meditate, and your tongues
discourse about heavenly things, be exceeding tender of sin, strict and
punctual in every duty; and hereby convince the world that you are men and
women of another spirit.

5th. Use for Consolation.
Let every new creature be cheerful and thankful: if God have renewed your
natures, and thus altered the frame and Use 5.
temper of your hearts, he has bestowed the richest mercy upon you that Heaven
or Earth affords: this is a work of greatest rarity, a new creature may be
called, one among a thousand; it is also an everlasting work never to be
destroyed, as all other natural works of God (how excellent soever) must be,
it is a work carried on by almighty power through unspeakable difficulties and
mighty oppositions, Ephesians. 1. 12. the exceeding greatness of Gods power goes
forth to produce it; and indeed no less is required to enlighten the blind
mind, break the rocky heart, and bow the stubborn will of man; and the same
almighty power which at first created it, is necessary to be continued every
moment to preserve and continue it, 1 Pet. 1. 5. the new creature is a mercy
which draws a train of innumerable and invaluable mercies after it, Ephesians. 2. 13,
14. 1 Cor. 3. 22. when God has given us a new nature, then he dignifies us
with a new name, Rev. 2. 17. brings us into a new Covenant, Jer. 31. 33. begets
us again to a new hope, 1 Pet. 1. 3. intitles us to a new inheritance, Joh. 1.
12, 13. it is the new creature which through Christ makes our persons and duties
acceptable with God, Gal. 6. 15. In a word, it is the wonderful work of God, of
which we may say, this is the Lords doing, and it is mavelous in our eyes;
there are unsearchable wonders in its generation, in its operation, and in its
preservation. Let all therefore whom the Lord has thus renewed, fall down at
the feet of God in an humble admiration of the unsearchable riches of free
grace, and never open their mouths to complain under any adverse or bitter
providence of God.

The Twenty seventh SERMON. Sermon 27.

GAL. 5. 24. Text.
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, Of the nature, principle
and necessity of Mortification.
with the affections and lusts.
TWo great Trials of our interest in Christ are finished, we now proceed to a
third, namely the mortification of sin: they that are Christ's have crucified
the flesh. The scope of the Apostle in this context is to heal the unchristian
breaches among the Galatians prevailing by the instigation of Satan, to the
breach of brotherly love: to cure this he urges four weighty arguments.

First, From the great Commandment, to love one another, upon which the whole
Law (i. e.) all the duties of the second Table do depend, verse. 14.

Secondly, He powerfully disswades them from the consideration of the sad
events of their bitter contests, calumnies and detractions, viz. mutual ruin
and destruction, verse. 15.

Thirdly, He disswades them from the consideration of the contrariety of these
practices unto the Spirit of God, by whom they all profess themselves to be
governed, from verse. 17, to the 23.

Fourthly, He powerfully disswades them from these animosities from the
inconsistency of these or any other lusts of the flesh with an interest in
Christ: they that be Christ's have crucified the flesh, etc. q. d. you all
profess your selves to be members of Christ, to be followers of him; but how
incongruous are these practices to such a profession? Is this the fruit of the
Dove-like-spirit of Christ? Are these the fruits of your faith, and professed
mortification? Shall the sheep of Christ ^narl and fight like rabid and furious
beasts of prey? Tantaene animis coelestibus ira? O how repugnant are these
practices -- non secus ac Cum duo conversis inimica in praelia tauri, Frontibus
(...).
with the study of mortification which is the great study and endeavor of all
that be in Christ! They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the
affections and lusts. So much for the order of the words; the words themselves
are a proposition wherein we have to consider both

The 1. Subject. 2. Predicate.

First, The Subject of the proposition, they that are Christ's, 1.
viz. true Christians, real members of Christ: such as truly Vere Christiani
qui ad Christum pertinent, qui se ei ded^ regend^s. Pol. Synopsis.
belong to Christ, such as have given themselves up to be governed by him, and
are indeed acted by his Spirit: such, all such persons (for the indefinite is
equipollent to a universal) all such, and none but such.

Secondly, The predicate, the^ ^ve crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts: by flesh (...) are here to understand carnal 2.
concupiscence, the workings and motions of corrupt nature: and by the
affections we are to understand not the natural but the inordinate affections:
for Christ does not abolish and destroy, but correct and regulate the
affections of those that are in him: and by crucifying the flesh we are not to
understand the total extinction, or perfect subduing of corrupt nature, but
only the deposing of corruption from its regency and dominion in the soul: its
dominion is taken away, though its life be prolonged for a season: but yet as
death surely, though slowly follows crucifixion (the life of crucified persons
gradually departing from them with their blood) so it is, just so in the
mortification of sin, and therefore what the Apostle in this place calls
crucifying, he calls in Romans 8. 13. mortifying; if ye through the Spirit do
mortify, (...), if ye put to death the deeds of the body: but he chooses in
this place to call it crucifying, to show not only the conformity there is
betwixt the death of Christ and the death of sin in respect of shame, pain and
lingering slowness; but to denote also the principle, means and instrument of
mortification, viz. the death or cross of Jesus Christ, in the virtue whereof
believers do mortify the corruptions of their flesh: the great arguments and
perswasives to mortification being drawn from the sufferings of Christ for sin.
In a word, he does not say they that believe Christ was crucified for sin, are
Christ's: but they, and they only are his, who feel as well as profess the power
and efficacy of the sufferings of Christ in the mortification, and subduing of
their lusts and sinful affections. And so much briefly of the parts and sense
of the words.

The Observation follows.

DOCT.
That a saving interest in Christ may be regularly and strongly inferred and
concluded from the mortification of the flesh, with Doct.
its affections and lusts.

This point is fully confirmed by those words of the Apostle, Romans 6. 5, 6, 7,
8. (...) if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we
shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old
man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed; that
henceforth we should not serve sin; for he that is dead is freed from sin: now
if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.

Mark the force of the Apostles reasoning: if we have been planted into the
likeness of his death, viz. by the mortification of sin, which resembles or
has a likeness to the kind and manner of Christ's death (as was noted above)
then we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection; and why so, but
because this mortification of sin is an undoubted evidence of the union of such
a soul with Christ, which is the very groundwork and principle of that blessed
and glorious resurrection: and therefore he says, verse. 11. Reckon ye also
your selves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
our Lord, q. d. reason thus with your selves, these mortifying influences of
the death of Christ are unquestionable presages of your future blessedness: God
never taking this course with any but those who are in Christ, and are designed
to be glorified with him: the death of your sin is as evidential as any thing
in the world can be, of your spiritual life for the present, and of your
eternal life with God hereafter. Mortification is the fruit and evidence of
your union, and that union is the firm groundwork, and certain pledge of your
glorification, and so you ought to reckon or reason the case with your selves
as the word: (...) there signifies. Now for the stating and explicating of this
point, I shall in the doctrinal part labor to open and confirm these five
things.

1. What the mortification or crucifixion of sin imports. 2. Why this work of
the Spirit is expressed by crucifying. 3. Why all that are in Christ must be so
crucified, or mortified unto sin. 4. What is the true evangelical principle of
mortification. 5. How the mortification of sin evinces our interest in Christ.
And then apply the whole.

First, What the mortification or crucifixion of sin imports. 1.


And for clearness sake, I shall speak to it both negatively and positively;
showing you what is not intended; and what is principally aimed at by the
Spirit of God in this expression.

First, The crucifying of the flesh does not imply the total abolition of sin
in Believers, or the destruction of its very Neg. 1. Mortificari carnem non est
eam ita perimi ut aut prorsus non sit, aut nulla prava in homine desideria
commoveat, quod in corpore mortis bujus non contingit, etc. Estius in loc.
being and existence in them for the present: sanctified souls so put off their
corruptions with their bodies at death: this will be the effect of our future
glorification, not of our present sanctification: it does exist in the most
mortified Believer in the world, Romans 7. 17. it still acts and lusts in the
regenerate soul, Gal. 5. 17. yea notwithstanding its crucifixion in Believers,
it still may in respect of single acts surprise and captivate them, Psalm. 65.
3. Romans 7. 23. This therefore is not the intention of the spirit of God in this
expression.

Secondly, Nor does the crucifixion of sin consist in the suppression of the
external acts of sin only, for sin may reign over the souls of men whilst it
does not break forth into their lives in gross and open actions, 2 Pet. 2. 20.
Mat. 12. 43. Morality in the Heathens (as Tertullian well observes) did
abscondere, sed non abscindere vitia, hide them, when it could not kill them:
many a man shows a white and fair hand, who yet has a very foul and black
heart.

Thirdly, The crucifixion of the flesh does not consist in the cessation of the
external acts of sin: for in that respect the lusts of men may dye of their own
accord, even a kind of natural death. The members of the body are the weapons
of unrighteousness as the Apostle calls them: age or sickness may so blunt or
break those weapons that the soul cannot use them to such sinful purposes and
services as it was wont to do in the vigorous and healthful season of life: not
that there is less sin in the heart, but because there is less strength and
activity in the body. Just as it is with an old Soldier, who has as much
skill, policy and delight as ever in military actions; but age and hard
services have so infeebled him, that he can no longer follow the camp.

Fourthly, The crucifixion of sin does not consist in the fevere castigations
of the body and penancing it by stripes, fasting and tiresome pilgrimages. This
may pass for mortification among Papists, but never was any lust of the flesh
destroyed by this rigor. Christians indeed are bound not to indulge and pamper
the body which is the instrument of sin, nor yet must we think that the
spiritual corruptions of the soul ^eel those stripes which are inflicted upon
the body: see Col. 2. 23. it is not the vanity of superstition, but the power of
true religion which crucifies and destroys corruption: it is faith in Christ's
blood, not the spilling of our own blood, which gives sin the mortal wound.

Secondly, But if you enquire what then is implied in the Posit. 2.
mortification or crucifixion of sin, and wherein it does consist? I answer,

First, It necessarily implies the souls implantation into Christ and union
with him; without which it is impossible Errant in ipsa natura mortificationis
Christianae, nam corporis afflictionem and injuriam reputant pro vera
mortificatione, cum illa non ad carnem praecipue aut inferiorem animae partem,
sed ad mentem and voluntatem, maxim pertineat. Davenant in Coloss. 256.
that any one corruption should be mortified, they that are [Christs] have
crucified the flesh: the attempts and endeavors of all others are vain and
ineffectual: when we were in the flesh (says the Apostle) the motions of sin
which were by the Law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death,
Romans 5. 7. sin was then in its full dominion, no abstinence, rigor, or outward
severity; no purposes; promises or solemn vows could mortify or destroy it:
there must be an implantation into Christ, before there can be any effectual
crucifixion of sin: what Believer almost has not in the days of his first
convictions tried all external methods and means of mortifying sin, and found
it in experience to be to as little purpose as the binding of Sampson with
green Withs or Cords? But when he has once come to act faith upon the death of
Christ, then the design of mortification has prospered and succeeded to good
purpose.

Secondly, Mortification of sin implies the agency of the spirit of God in that
work, without whose assistances and aids all our endeavors must needs be
fruitless: of this work we may say as it was said in another case, Zech. 4. 6.
not* by might, no^ by power; but by my spirit says the Lord. When the Apostle
therefore would show by what hand this work of mortification is performed, he
thus expresses it, Romans 8. 13. if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds
of the body; ye shall live: the duty is ours, but the power whereby we perform
it, is Gods: the spirit is the only successful Combatant against the lusts that
war in our members, Gal. 5. 17. it is true, this excludes not, but implies our
endeavors; for it is we through the spirit that mortify the deeds of the
body; but yet all our endeavors without the Spirits aid and influence avail
nothing.

Thirdly, The crucifixion of sin necessarily implies the subversion of its
dominion in the soul: a mortified sin cannot be a reigning sin, Romans 6. 12, 13,
14. Two things constitute the dominion of sin, viz. the fullness of its power,
and the souls subjection t^ it. As to the fullness of its power, that rises from
the suitableness it has, and pleasure it gives to the corrupt heart of man: it
seems to be as necessary as the right hand, as useful and pleasant as the right
eye, Mat. 5. 29. but the mortified heart is dead to all pleasures and profits
of sin: it has no delight or pleasure in it: it becomes its burden and daily
complaint. Mortification presupposes the illumination of the mind and
conviction of the conscience; by reason whereof sin cannot deceive and blind
the mind, or bewitch and ensnare the will and affections as it was wont to do,
and consequently its dominion over the soul is destroyed and lost.

Fourthly, The crucifying of the flesh implies a gradual weakening of the power
of sin in the soul. The death of the Cross was a slow and lingering death, and
the crucified person grew weaker and weaker every hour; so it is in the
mortification of sin: the soul is still cleansing it self from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, and perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7.
1. And as the body of sin is weakened more and more; so the inward man, or the
new creature is renewed day by day, 2 Cor. 4. 16. for sanctification is a
progressive work of the spirit: and as holiness increases, and roots it self
deeper and deeper in the soul; so the power and interest of sin proportionably
abates, and sinks lower and lower, until at length it be swallowed up in
victory.

Fifthly, The crucifying of the flesh notes to us the Believers designed
application of all spiritual means and sanctified instruments for the
destruction of it: there is nothing in this world which a gracious heart more
vehemently desires and longs for, than the death of sin, and perfect
deliverance from it, Romans 7. 2^. the sincerity of which desires does
accordingly manifest it self in the daily application of all Gods remedies,
such are daily watching against the occasions of sin, Job 31. 1. I have made a
Covenant with mine eyes; more than ordinary vigilance over their special or
proper sin, Psalm. 18. 23. I kept my self from mine iniquity: earnest cries to
Heaven for preventing grace, Psalm. 19. 13. keep back thy Servant also from
presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me: deep humbling of soul
for sins past, which is an excellent preventive unto future sins, 2 Cor. 2. 11.
in that he sorrowed after a Godly sort, what carefulness it wrought? care to
give no furtherance, or advantage to the design of sin, by making provision for
the flesh, to fulfill the Lusts thereof, as others do, Romans 13. 13, 14.
willingness to bear the due reproofs of sin, Psalm. 141. 5. Let the righteous
smite me, it shall be a kindness: these and such like means of mortification,
regenerate souls are daily using; and applying in order to the death of sin.
And so much of the first particular what the mortification of sin, or
Crucifying of the flesh implies.

Secondly, In the next place, we shall examine the reasons 2.
why this work of the spirit is expressed under that Trope or figurative
expression of Crucifying the flesh. Now the ground and reason of the use of
this expression, is the resemblance which the mortification of sin bears unto
the death of the cross: and this appears in five particulars.

First, The death of the cross was a painful death, and the mortification of
sin is very painful work, Matthew. 25. 29. it is the cutting off our right hands,
and plucking out our right eyes: it will cost many thousand tears, and groans,
prayers and strong cries to heaven before one sin will be mortified. Upon the
account of the difficulty of this work, and mainly upon this account, the
Scripture says, narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that leads unto
life, and few there be that find it, Matthew. 7. 14. and that the righteous
themselves are scarcely saved.

Secondly, The death of the cross was universally painful, every member, every
sense, every sinew, every nerve was the seat, and subject of tormenting pain.
So is it in the mortification of sin: it is not this or that particular member,
or act; but the whole body of sin that is to be destroyed, Romans 6. 6. and
accordingly the conflict is in every faculty of the soul; for the Spirit of God
by whose hand sin is mortified, does not combat with this or that particular
Lust only, but with sin as sin: and for that reason with every sin, in every
faculty of the soul. So that there are conflicts, and anguish in every part.

Thirdly, The death of the cross was a slow and lingering death: denying unto
them that suffered it the favor of a quick dispatch. Just so it is in the
death of sin, though the Spirit of God be mortifying it day by day; yet this is
a truth Mortificatio peccati non fit uno momento, sed opus est lucta assidua:
p^ccatum languescit ab initio mortificationis nostrae, in progressu tabescit;
ad extremum (i. e.) in ipsa morte nostra, abolebitur. Origin in Epist. ad Romans
sealed by the sad experience of all believers in the world, that sin is long a
dying: and if we ask a reason of this dispensation of God, among others, this
seems to be one; corruptions in believers like the Canaanites in the Land of
Israel are left to prove, and to exercise the people of God, to keep us
watching and praying, mourning and believing; yea, wondering and admiring at
the riches of pardoning, and preserving mercy all our days.

Fourthly, The death of the Cross was a very opprobrious and shameful death:
they that dyed upon the cross were loaded with ignominy: the crimes for which
they dyed were exposed to the public view: after this manner dies sin, a very
shameful and ignominious death. Every true believer draws up a charge against
it in every prayer, aggravates and condemns it in every confession, bewailes
the evil of it with multitudes of tears and groans, making sin as vile and
odious as they can find words to express it, though not so vile as it is in its
own nature. O my God (says Ezra) I am ashamed, and even blush to look up unto
thee, Ezra 9. 6. So Daniel in his confession: Dan. 9. 7. O Lord, righteousness
belongs unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day. Nor can it
grieve any believer in the world to accuse, condemn, and shame himself for sin,
whilst he remembers and considers that all that shame and confusion of face
which he takes to himself, goes to the vindication, glory, and honor of his
God: as David was content to be more vile still for God, so it pleases the
heart of a Christian to magnify and advance the name and glory of God by
exposing his own shame, in humble and broken hearted confessions of sin.

Fifthly, In a word, the death of the Cross was not a natural, but a violent
death: such also is the death of sin: sin dies not of its own accord, as nature
dies in old men, in whom the Balsamum radicale or radical moisture is
consumed: for if the Spirit of God did not kill it, it would live to eternity
in the souls of men: it is not the everlasting burnings, and all the wrath of
God which lies upon the damned for ever, that can destroy sin. Sin like a
Salamander can live to eternity in the fire of Gods wrath: so that either it
must dye a violent death by the hand of the Spirit, or never dies at all. And
thus you see, why the mortification of sin is Tropically expressed by the
crucifying of the flesh.

3. Thirdly, Why all that are in Christ must be so crucified, or mortified unto
sin: and the necessity of this will appear diverse ways.

First, From the inconsistency and contrariety that there is betwixt Christ and
unmortified lust, Gal. 5. 17. these are contrary the one to the other. There is
a threefold inconsistency betwixt Christ and such corruptions: they are not
only contrary to the holiness of Christ, 1 John 3. 6. Whosoever abides in him
sins not; whosoever sins has not seen him, neither known him, (i. e.)
whosoever is thus ingulphed and plunged into the lust of the flesh, can have no
communion with the pure and holy Christ: but there is also an inconsistency
betwixt such sin and the honor of Christ, 2 Timothy 2. 19. Let every one that
names the name of Christ, depart from iniquity: as Alexander said to a Soldier
of his name, recordare nominis Alexandri, remember thy name is Alexander, and
do nothing unworthy of that name. And unmortified lusts are also contrary to
the Dominion and government of Christ, Luke 9. 23. If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross daily and follow me: these are
the self-denying terms upon which all men are admitted into Christ's service:
and without mortification and self-denial he allows no man to call him Lord and
Master.

Secondly, The necessity of mortification appears from the necessity of
conformity betwixt Christ the head, and all the members of his mystical body:
for how incongruous and uncomely would it be to see a holy heavenly Christ,
leading a company of unclean, carnal and sensual members? Mat. 11. 29. Take my
yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, q. d. it would be
monstrous to the world to behold a company of Lions and Wolves following a meek
and harmless Lamb: men of raging and unmortified lusts, professing and owning
me for their head of government: and again, 1 John 2. 6. He that says he
abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked, q. d. either
imitate Christ in your practice, or never make pretensions to Christ in your
profession: this was what the Apostle complained of, Phil. 3. 18. for many walk
of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the
enemies of the Cross of Christ: men cannot study to put a greater dishonor and
reproach upon Christ, than by making his name and profession, a cloak and cover
to their filthy lusts.

Thirdly, The necessity of crucifying the flesh appears from the method of
Salvation as it is stated in the Gospel. God every where requires the practice
of mortification under pain of damnation, Mat. 18. 8. Wherefore if thy hand, or
thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee; it is better for
thee to enter into life halt or maimed; rather than having two hands, or two
feet, to be cast into everlasting fire: the Gospel legitimates no hopes of
salvation, but such as are accompanied with serious endeavors of
mortification, 1 John 3. 3. Every man that has this hope in him purifieth
himself, even as he is pure: 'twas one special end of Christ's coming into the
world, to save his people from their sins, Mat. 1. 21. nor will he be a Savior
unto any who remain under the dominion of their own lusts.

Fourthly, The whole stream and current of the Gospel put us under the
necessity of mortification. Gospel precepts have respect unto this, Col. 3. 5.
mortify your members therefore which are upon the earth, 1 Pet. 1. 15. be ye
holy for I am holy. Gospel presidents have respect unto this, Heb. 12. 1.
wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily
beset us, etc. Gospel threatenings are written for this end, and do all press
mortification in a thundering dialect, Romans 8. 13. If ye live after the flesh ye
shall dye, Romans 1. 18. The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all
ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men: the promises of the Gospel are written
designedly to promote it, 2 Cor. 7. 1. Having therefore these promises, dearly
beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,
perfecting holiness in the fear of God: but in vain are all these precepts,
presidents, threatenings and promises written in the Scripture, except
mortification be the daily study and practice of professors.

Fifthly, Mortification is the very scope and aim of our regeneration and the
infusion of the principles of grace: if we live in the Spirit, let us walk in
the Spirit, Gal. 5. 25. in vain were the habits of grace planted, if the fruits
of holiness and mortification be not produced: yea, mortification is not only
the design and aim, but it is a special part even the one half of our
sanctification.

Sixthly, If mortification be not the daily practice and endeavor of
Believers, then the way to Heaven no way answers to Christ's description of it
in the Gospel: he tells us, Mat. 7. 13, 14. Wide is the gate, and broad is the
way that leads to destruction; and many there be that go in thereat, because
strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto life, and few
there be that find it: well then, either Christ must be mistaken in the account
he gave of the way to glory, or else all unmortified persons are out of the
way: for what makes the way of salvation narrow, but the difficulties and
severities of mortification?

Seventhly, In a word, he that denies the necessity of mortification, confounds
all discriminating marks betwixt Saints and Sinners; pulls down the Pale of
distinction, and lets the world into the Church, and the Church into the World:
it is a great design of the Gospel to preserve the boundaries betwixt the one
and the other, Romans 2. 7, 8. Romans 8. 1, 4, 5, 6, 13. but if men may be
Christians without mortification, we may as well go into the Taverns,
Alehouses, or Brothel-houses, among the roaring or sottish crew of sinners,
and say, here be those that are redeemed by the blood of Christ; here be his
Disciples and Followers; as go to seek them in the purest Churches, or most
strictly religious families: by all which the necessity of mortification unto
all that are in Christ, is abundantly evidenced.

Fourthly, In the next place we are to enquire into the true principle of
mortification: it is true there are many ways attempted 4.
by men for the mortification of sin, and many rules laid down to guide men in
that great work: some of which are very tristing and impertinent things; such
are those prescribed by popish votaries: but I shall lay down this as a sure
conclusion, that the sanctifying spirit is the only effectual principle of
mortification: and without him no resolutions, vows, abstinencies, castigations
of the body, or any other external endeavors can ever avail to the
mortification of one sin: the moral Heathens have prescribed may pretty rules
and helps for the suppression of vice. Aristides, Seneca and Cato were renowned
among them upon this account: but yet as Lactantius well observes, moral
Philosophy did rather abscondere vitia, quam abscindere, hide it, rather than
kill it: formal Christians have also gone far in the reformation of their
lives, but could never attain true mortification: formality pares off the
excrescences of vice, but never kills the root of it: it usually recovers it
self again, and their souls like a body not well purged, relapse into a worse
condition than before, Mat. 12. 43, 44. 2 Pet. 2. 20.

This work of mortification is peculiar to the spirit of God, Romans 8. 13. Gal.
5. 17. and the spirit becomes a principle of mortification in Believers two
ways, namely 1. By the implantation of contrary habits. 2. By assisting those
implanted habits in all the times of need.


First, The spirit of God implants habits of a contrary nature, which are
destructive to sin, and are purgative of corruption, 1.
1 John 5. 4. Acts 15. 9. Grace is to corruption what water is to fire; betwixt
which there is both a formal and effective opposition: a contrariety both in
nature and operation, Gal. 5. 17. There is a threefold remarkable advantage
given us by grace for the destruction and mortification of sin. For,

First, Grace gives the mind and heart of man a contrary bent and inclination;
by reason whereof spiritual and heavenly things become connatural to the
regenerate soul, Romans 7. 22. For I delight in the Law of God, after the inner
man: sanctification is in the soul as a living spring running with a kind of
central force Heavenward, John 4. 14.

Secondly, Holy principles destroy the interest that sin once had in the love
and delight of the soul: the sanctified soul cannot take pleasure in sin, or
find delight in that which grieves God, as it was wont to do: but that which
was the object of delight, hereby becomes the object of grief and hatred, Romans
7. 15. What I hate, that I do.

Thirdly, From both these follow a third advantage for the mortification of
sin, in as much as sin being contrary to the new nature, and the object of
grief and hatred, cannot possibly be committed without reluctance, and very
sensible regret of mind: and actions done with regret, are neither done
frequently nor easily. The case of a regenerate soul under the surprizals, and
particular victories of temptation, (...), cum ita quis capitur, ut nequeat
luctari, nec se capienti obsistere. Sclat.
being like that of a captive in war, who marches not with delight, but by
constraint among his enemies. So the Apostle expresses himself, Romans 7. 23.
But I see another law in my members, warring against the Law of my mind; and
bringing me into captivity unto the law of sin which is in my members: thus the
spirit of God promotes the design of mortification by the implantation of
contrary habits.

Secondly, By assisting those gracious habits in all the times 2.
of need, which he does many ways: sometimes notably awakening and rouzing
grace out of the dull and sleepy habit, and drawing forth the activity and
power of it into actual and successful resistances of temptations, as Genesis 39.
9. How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? Holy fear awakens
first, and raises all the powers of grace in the soul to make a vigorous
resistance of temptation: the spirit also strengthens weak grace in the soul, 2
Cor. 12. 9. My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in
weakness: and by reason of grace thus implanted, and thus assisted, he that is
born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one touches him not.

Fifthly, The last query to be satisfied is, how mortification of sin solidly
evinceth the souls interest in Christ; and this it 5.
does diverse ways, affording the mortified soul many sound evidences thereof.
As,

Evidence 1.
Whatsoever evidences the indwelling of the holy spirit of God in us, must
needs be evidential of a saving interest in Christ; as has been fully proved
before: but the mortification of sin does plainly evidence the indwelling of
the spirit of God; for as we proved but now, it can proceed from no other
principle: there is as strong and inseparable a connection betwixt
mortification and the spirit, as betwixt the effect, and its proper cause, and
the self-same connection betwixt the inbeing of the spirit, and union with
Christ. So that to reason from mortification to the inhabitation of the spirit,
and from the inhabitation of the spirit to our union with Christ; is a strong
scriptural way of reasoning.

Evidence 2.
That which proves a soul to be under the Covenant of Grace, evidently proves
its interest in Christ: for Christ is the head of that Covenant, and none but
sound Believers are under the blessings and promises of it; but mortification
of sin is a sound evidence of the souls being under the Covenant of Grace, as
is plain from those words of the Apostle, Romans 6. 12, 13, 14. Let not sin
therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lust
thereof; neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto
sin; but yield your selves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and
your members as instruments of righteousness unto God; sor sin shall not have
dominion over you: for ye are not under the Law but under Grace: where the
Apostle presses Believers unto mortification by this encouragement, that it
will be a good evidence unto them of a new Covenant interest: for all legal
duties and endeavors can never mortify sin: it is the spirit in the new
Covenant which produces this: whoever therefore has his corruptions mortified,
has his interest in the Covenant, and consequently in Christ, so far cleared
unto him.

Evidence 3.
That which is the fruit and evidence of saving faith, must needs be a good
evidence of our interest in Christ; but mortifi^ (...) sin is the fruit and
evidence of saving faith, Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by faith, 1 John
5. 4. This is the victory whereby we overcome the world, even our faith: faith
overcomes both the allurements of the world upon one hand, and the terrors of
the world upon the other hand; by mortifying the heart, and affections to all
earthly things: a mortified heart is not easily taken with the ensnaring
pleasures of the world, or much moved with the disgraces, losses and sufferings
it meets with from the world: and so the strength and force of its temptations
is broken, and the mortified soul becomes victorious over it, and all this by
the instrumentality of faith.

Evidence 4.
In a word, there is an intimate and indissoluble connection betwixt the
mortification of sin and the life of grace, Romans 6. 11. Reckon your selves to
be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ: and the life
of Christ must needs involve a saving interest in Christ: by all which is fully
proved what was asserted in the observation from this Text. The Application
follows in the next Sermon.

strongly inferred and concluded from the mortification of the flesh, with its

Having opened the nature and necessity of mortification in the former Sermon,
and shown how regularly a (...) ^interest in Christ may be concluded from it:
we now proceed to apply the whole

Consolation.

1st Use for Information. Use 1.

Inference 1.
If they that be Christ's have crucified the flesh, then the life Inference 1.
of Christians is no idle, or easy life: the corruptions of his heart
continually fill his hands with work, with work of the most difficult nature,
sin-crucifying work, which the Scripture calls the cutting off the right hand,
and plucking out of the right eye: sin-crucifying work is hard work; and it is
constant work, throughout the life of a Christian: there is no time or place
freed from this conflict: every occasion stirs corruption, and every stirring
of corruption calls for mortification: corruptions work in our very best
duties, Romans 7. 23. and put the Christian upon mortifying labors. The world
and the Devil are great enemies and fountains of many temptations to Believers,
but not like the corruptions of our own hearts: they only tempt objectively and
externally; but this tempts internally, and therefore much more dangerous: they
only tempt at times and seasons; this continually, at all times and seasons:
beside, what ever Satan or the world attempts upon us would be altogether
ineffectual, were it not for our own corruptions, John 14. 30. So that the
corruptions of our own hearts as they give us most danger, so they must give us
more labor: our life, and this labor must end together; for sin is long a
dying in the best heart: those that have been many years exercised in the study
of mortification may happily feel the same corruption tempting and troubling them
now, which put them into tears, and many times to their knees twenty or forty
years ago. It may be said of sin as it was of Hannibal, that active enemy: that
it will never be quiet whether conquering or conquered: and until sin cease
working, the Christian must not cease mortifying.

Inference 2.
If mortification be the great work of a Christian, then Inference 2.
certainly those that give the corruptions of Christians an occasion to revive,
must needs do them a very ill office: they are not our best friends that stir
the pride of our hearts by the flattery of their lips. The graces of God in
others, I confess, are thankfully to be owned, and under discouragements, and
contrary temptations to be wisely and modestly spoken of: but the strongest
Christians do scarcely show their own weakness in any one thing more than they
do in bearing their own praises. Christian, thou know thou carriest
Gunpowder about thee, desire those that carry fire to keep at a distance from
thee: it is a dangerous Crisis when a proud heart meets with flattering lips,
auferte ignem, etc. take away the fire (said a holy Divine of Germany when his
friend commended him upon his deathbed) for I have yet combustible matter about
me: faithful, seasonable, discreet reproofs are much more safe to us, and
advantageous to our mortifying work; but alas, how few have the boldness or
wisdom duly to administer them? It Is said of Alexander that he bid a
Philosopher who had been long with him, to be gone; for, said he, so long thou
have been with me, and never reproved me; which must needs be thy fault: for
either thou saw nothing in me worthy of reproof, which argues thy ignorance;
or else thou durst not reprove me, which argues thy unfaithfulness. A wise and
faithful reprover is of singular use to him that is heartily engaged in the
design of mortification: such a faithful friend, or some malicious enemy must
be helpful to us in that work.

Inference 3.
Hence it follows, that manifold and successive afflictions are no more than is
necessary for the best of Christians: the mortification Inference 3.
of our lusts require them all, be they never so many, 1 Pet. 1. 5. if need be,
ye are in heaviness: it is no more than need, that one loss should follow
another to mortify an earthly heart: for so intensely are our affections set
upon the world, that it is not one, or two, or many checks of providence, that
will suffice to wean and alienate them. Alas, the earthliness of our heart will
take all this, it may be much more than this to purge the earthliness of them:
the wise God sees it but necessary to permit frequent discoveries of our own
weakness, and to let loose the tongues of many enemies upon us, and all little
enough to pull down the pride and vanity that is in our hearts. Christian, how
difficult soever it be for thee to bear it; yet the pride of thy heart requires
all the scoffs and jeers, all the calumnies and reproaches that ever the
tongues or pens of thy bitterest enemies, or mistaking friends have at any time
thrown upon thee. Such rank weeds as grow in our hearts will require hard
frosts, and very sharp weather to rot them: the straying Bullock needs a heavy
clog, and so does a Christian, whom God will keep within the bounds and limits
of his commandments, Psalm. 119. 67. Dan. 11. 35.

Inference 4.
If they that be Christ's have crucified the flesh, then the Inference 4. Non
est salvatus cruce Christi, qui non est crucifixus in Christo, qui non est
membrum Christi. Prosper.
number of real Christians is very small: it is true, if all that seem to be
meek, humble and heavenly might pass for Christians, the number would be great:
but if no more must be accounted Christians than those who crucify the flesh
with its affections and lusts, O how small is the number! For O how many be
there under the Christian name, that pamper and indulge their lusts, that
secretly hate all that faithfully reprove them, and really affect none but such
as feed their lusts by praising and admiring them? How many that make provision
for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts? who cannot endure to have their corruptions
crossed: how many are there that seem very meek and humble until an occasion be
given to stir their passion, and then you shall see in what degree they are
mortified: the flint is a cold stone, till it be struck, and then it is all
fiery. I know the best of Christians are mortified but in part: and strong
corruptions are oft-times found in very eminent Christians; but they love them
not so well as to purvey for them, to protect, defend and countenance them: nor
dare they secretly hate such as faithfully reprove them; as many thousands that
go under the name of Christians do. Upon the account of mortification it is
said, Matthew. 7. 13. Narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that leads unto
life, and few there be that find it.

Inference 5.
If they that be Christ's have crucified the flesh (i. e.) Inference 5.
mortification is their daily work and study; then how falsely are Christians
charged as troublers of the world, and disturbers of the civil peace and
tranquillity of the times and places they live in? Justly may they retort the
charge, as Elijah did to Ahab, It is not I that trouble Israel, but thou and
thy Fathers house: it is not the holy, meek and humble Christians that put the
world into confusion: this is done by the profane, and atheistical; or by the
designing and hypocritical world, and laid at the innocent Christians door: as
all the public calamities which from the immediate hand of God, or by foreign,
or domestic enemies befell Rome, were constantly charged upon Christians; and
they condemned and punished, for what the righteous hand of God inflicted, or
the working-heads of the enemies of that State without their privity contrived.
The Apostle James propounds, and answers a very pertinent question unto this
discourse, James 4. 1. From whence come wars and fightings among you; come they
not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? O if all men did but
study mortification and self-denial, and live as much at home in the constant
work of their own hearts, as some men do; what tranquillity and peace, what
blessed halcyon days should we quickly see! It Is true, Christians are always
fighting and quarrelling, but it is with themselves and their own corrupt
hearts and affections: they hate no enemy but sin, they thirst for the blood
and ruin of none but of that enemy: they are ambitious of no victory, but what
is over the corruptions of their own hearts: they carry no grudge except it be
against this enemy sin, and yet these are the men who are most suspected and
charged of disturbing the times they live in. Just as the Wolf accused the Lamb
which was below him for pudling and defiling the stream. But there will be a
day when God will clear up the innocence and integrity of his mistaken and
abused servants, and the world shall see it was not preaching and praying, but
drinking, swearing, profaneness and enmity unto true godliness, which disturbs
and breaks the tranquillity, and quietness of the times: mean time let
innocence commit it self unto God who will protect, and in due time vindicate
the same.

Inference 6.
If they that be Christ's have crucified the flesh, then whatsoever Inference 6.
Religion, Opinion or Doctrine does in its own nature countenance and encourage
sin, is not of Christ: the doctrine of Christ every where teaches
mortification; the whole stream of the Gospel runs against sin; the doctrine it
teaches is holy, pure and heavenly; it has no tendency to extol corrupt
nature, and feed its pride by magnifying its freedom and power; or by stamping
the merit and dignity of the blood of Christ upon its works and performances:
it never makes the death of Christ a Cloak to cover sin, but an instrument to
destroy it: and whatsoever doctrine it is which nourishes the pride of nature
to the disparagement of grace; or incourages licentiousness and fleshly lust,
is not the doctrine of Christ; but a spurious offspring begotten by Satan upon
the corrupt nature of man.

Inference 7.
If mortification be the great business, and character of a Christian, then
that condition is most eligible and desirable by Christians Inference 7.
which is least of all exposed to Temptation. Prove. 30. 8. Give me neither
poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient: that holy judicious man
was well aware of the danger lurking in both extremes; and how near they border
upon deadly temptations, and approach the very precipice of ruin, that stand
upon either ground: few Christians have an head strong and steady enough to
stand upon the pinnacle of wealth and honor, nor is it every one that can
grapple with poverty and contempt. A mediocrity is the Christians best external
security, and therefore most desirable, and yet how do the corruptions, the
pride and ignorance of our hearts grasp, and covet that condition which only
serves to warm and nourish our lusts, and make the work of mortification much
more difficult? It Is well for us, that our wise Father leaves us not to our own
choice, that he frequently dashes our earthly projects, and disappoints our
fond expectations. If children were left to carve for themselves, how often
would they cut their own fingers?

Inference 8.
If Mortification be the great business of a Christian, then Inference 8.
Christian fellowship, and society duly managed, and improved, must needs be of
singular use, and special advantage to the people of God. For thereby we have
the friendly help and assistance of many other hands, to carry on our great
design, and help us in our most difficult business; if corruption be too hard
for us, others this way come into our assistance, Gal. 6. 1. Brethren if a man
be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the
spirit of meekness. If temptations prevail, and over-bear us that we fall under
sin, it is a special mercy to have the reproofs and counsels of our brethren,
who will not suffer sin to rest upon us, Levit. 19. 17. Whilst we are sluggish
and sleepy, others are vigilant, and careful for our safety: The humility of
another, reproves and mortifies my pride: The activity and liveliness of
another, awakens and quickens my deadness: The prudence and gravity of another,
detects and cures my levity and vanity: The heavenliness and Spirituality of
another, may be exceeding useful both to reprove, and heal the earthliness, and
sensuality of my heart. Two are better than one, but woe unto him that is alone.
The Devil is well aware of this great advantage, and therefore strikes with
special malice against embodied Christians, who are as a well disciplined army,
whom he therefore more especially endeavors to rout and scatter by
persecutions, that thereby particular Christians may be deprived of the sweet
advantages of mutual society.

Inference 9.
How deeply has sin fixed its roots in our corrupt nature, that it should be
the constant work of a Christians whole life, to mortify Inference 9.
and destroy it? God has given us many excellent helps, his spirit within us,
variety of ordinances and duties are also appointed as instruments of
Mortification: And from the very day of Regeneration unto the last moment of
dissolution the Christian is daily at work in the use of all sanctified means
external and internal, yet can never dig up, and destroy corruption at the root
all his life long. The most eminent Christians of longest standing in Religion,
who have shed Millions of tears for sin, and poured out many thousand Prayers
for the Mortification of it; do after all find the grudgings of their old
disease, that there is still life and strength in those corruptions which they
have given so many wounds unto in duty. O the depth and strength of sin! which
nothing can separate from us, but that which separates our souls and bodies.
And upon that account the day of a believers death, is better than the day of
his birth. Never till then, do we put off our armor, sheath our sword, and cry
victory, victory.

all diligence to mortify sin, in vain else are all our pretenses unto Union
with him. This is the great work, and discriminating character of a believer.
And seeing it is the main business of life, and great evidence for heaven, I
shall therefore press you to it by the following Motives and Considerations.

1. Motive.
And first, methinks the comfort and sweetness resulting from Mortification
should effectually persuade every believer Motive 1.
to more diligence about it. There is a double sweetness in Mortification, one
in the nature of the work, as it is a duty, a sweet Christian duty, another as
it has respect to Christ, and is evidential of our Union with him. In the
first consideration there is a wonderful sweetness in Mortification, for do
thou not feel a blessed calmness, cheariness and tranquillity in thy
conscience, when thou have faithfully repelled temptations, successfully
resisted and overcome thy corruptions? Does not God smile upon thee; conscience
encourage, and approve thee? Have thou not an heaven within thee? whilst others
feel a kind of hell in the deadly gripes, and bitter accusations of their own
consciences, are covered with shame, and filled with horrors. But then,
consider it also as an evidence of the souls interest in Christ, as my Text
considers it; and what an heaven upon earth must then be found in
mortification! These endeavors of mine to subdue and mortify my corruptions,
plainly speak the Spirit of God in me, and my being in Christ, and O what is
this! What heart has largeness and strength enough to receive and contain the
joy and comfort which flows from a cleared interest in Jesus Christ! Certainly
Christians, the tranquillity and comfort of your whole life depends upon it:
and what is life without the comfort of life, Romans 8. 13. If ye through the
Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live, (i. e.) you shall live
a serene, placid, comfortable life, for it is corruption unmortified which
clouds the face of God, and breaks the peace of his people, and consequently
imbitters the life of a Christian.

2. Motive.
As the comfort of your own lives which is much, so your Motive 2.
instrumental fitness for the service of God which is much more, depends upon
the Mortification of your sins. 2 Timothy 2. 21. If a man therefore purge himself
from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor; sanctified and meet for the
masters use, and prepared unto every good work. Where is the mercy of life but
in the usefulness and serviceableness of it unto God? It is not worth while to
live sixty, or seventy years in the world, to eat and drink, to buy and sell,
to laugh and cry, and then go down to the place of silence. So far as any man
lives to God, an useful serviceable life to his praise and honor; so far only,
and no farther does he answer the end of his being. But it is the purged
mortified soul which is the vessel of honor, prepared, and meet for the
masters use. Let a proud or an earthly heart be employed in any service for
God, and you shall find that such an heart will both spoil the work, by
managing it for a self end as Jehu did; and then devour the praise of it by a
proud boast: Come, see my zeal. When the Lord would employ the prophet Isaiah
in his work and service, his iniquity was first purged; and after that he was
employed, Isa. 6. 6, 7, 8. Sin is the souls sickness, a consumption upon the
inner man, and we know that languishing consumptive persons are very unfit to
be employed in difficult and strenuous labors: Mortification so far as it
prevails, cures the disease, recovers our strength, and inables us for service
to God in our generations.

3. Motive.
Your stability, and safety in the hour of temptation depends Motive 3.
upon the success of your mortifying endeavors. Is it then a valuable mercy in
your eyes to be kept upright and steadfast in the critical season of temptation,
when Satan shall be wrestling with you for the Crown, and Prize of eternal
life? Then give diligence to mortify your corruptions. Temptation is a siege,
Satan is the enemy without the walls, laboring to force an entrance, natural
corruptions are the Traitors within, that hold correspondency with the enemy
without, and open the gate of the soul to receive him. It was the covetousness
of Judas his heart which overthrew him in the hour of Temptation. They are our
fleshly lusts which go over unto Satan in the day of Battle, and fight against
our souls, 1 Pet. 2. 11. the corruptions (or infectious atoms which fly up and
down the world in times of Temptation as that word (...) imports) 2 Pet. 2. 20.
are through lusts, 2 Pet. 1. 4. It Is the lust within which gives a luster to
the vanities of the world without, and thereby makes them strong temptations to
us. 1 John 2. 16. Mortify therefore your corruptions as ever you expect to
maintain your station in the day of trial: cut off those advantages of your
enemy, lest by them he cut off your souls, and all your hopes from God.

4. Motive.
As Temptations will be irresistible, so afflictions will be unsupportable to
you without Mortification. My friends, you Motive 4.
live in a mutable world, providence daily rings the changes in all the
Kingdoms, Cities, and Towns all the world over. You that have husbands or wives
to day, may be left desolate to morrow: you that have estates, and children
now, may be bereaved of both before you are aware. Sickness will tread upon the
heel of health, and death will assuredly follow life, as the night does the
day. Consider with your selves, are you able to bear the loss of your sweet
enjoyments with patience? Can you think upon the parting hour without some
tremblings? O get a heart mortified to all these things, and you will bless a
taking as well as a giving God. It Is the living world, not the crucified world
that raises such tumults in our souls in the day of affliction. How cheerful
was holy Paul under all his sufferings! and what think you gave him that peace,
and cheerfulness, but his mortification to the world? Phil. 4. 12. I know both
how to be abased, and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am
instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and suffer need.
Job was the mirror of patience in the greatest shock of calamity, and what
made him so, but the mo^tifiedness of his heart in the fullest enjoyment of
earthly things? Job 31. 25.

5. Motive.
The reputation and honor of Religion is deeply concerned in the Mortification
of the Professors of it: for unmortified Motive 5.
professors will first or last be the scandals, and reproaches of it. The
profession of religion may give credit to you, but to be sure you will never
bring credit to it. All the scandals and reproaches that fall upon the name of
Christ in this world flow from the fountain of unmortified corruption. Judas
and Demas, Hymeneus and Philetus, Ananias and Saphira ruined themselves, and
became rocks of offense to others by this means. If ever you will keep Religion
sweet, labor to keep your hearts mortified and pure.

6. Motive
To conclude, what an hard^tug will you have in your dying Motive 6.
hour except you get a heart mortified to this world, and all that is in it?
your parting hour is like to be a dreadful hour without the help of
mortification. Your corruptions like glue fasten your affections to the world,
and how hard will it be for such a man to be separated by death? O what a
bitter and doleful parting have carnal hearts from carnal things! whereas the
mortified soul can receive the messengers of death without trouble, and as
cheerfully put off the body at death, as a man does his clothes at night: death
need not pull, and hale; such a man goes half way to meet it. Phil. 1. 23. I
desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is far better. Christian,
would thou have thy death bed soft and easy? would thou have an (...), as
the Philosopher desired for himself, an easy death without pain or terror;
then get a mortified heart: the Surgeons knife is scarce felt, when it cuts
off a mortified member.

3d. Use for Direction.
Are you convinced and fully satisfied of the excellency and Use 3.
necessity of mortification, and inquisitive after the means, in the use
whereof it may be attained? then for your help and encouragement I will in the
next place offer my best assistance, in laying down the rules for this work.

1. Rule.
If ever you will succeed and prosp^ in the work of mortification, Rule 1.
then get and daily exercise more faith. Faith is the great instrument of
mortification. This is the victory (or sword by which the victory is won, the
instrument) by which you overcome the world, even your faith, 1 John 5. 4. By
faith alone eternal things are discovered to our souls in their reality and
excelling glory, and these are the preponderating things for the sake whereof
self-denial and mortification becomes easy to believers; by opposing things
eternal to things temporal we resist Satan, 1 Pet. 5. 8. This is the shield by
which we quench the fiery darts of the wicked one, Ephesians. 6. 16.

2. Rule.
Walk in daily communion with God, if ever you will mortify the corruptions of
nature, that is the Apostles own prescription. Rule 2.
Gal. 1. 16. This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the
lusts of the flesh. Spiritual and frequent communion with God, gives manifold
advantages for the mortification of sin: as it is a bright glass wherein the
holiness of God and the exceeding sinfulness of sin, as it is opposite
thereunto, are most clearly and sensibly discovered, than which scarce any
thing can set a keener edge of indignation upon the spirit of a man against
fin. Besides, all communion with God is assimilating, and transformative of the
soul into his image, it leaves also a heavenly relish and savor upon the soul:
it darkens the luster and glory of all earthly things, by presenting to the
soul a Glory which excels. It marvelously improves, and more deeply
radicates sanctification in the soul, by all which means it becomes singularly
useful, and successful in the work of mortification.

3. Rule.
Keep your Consciences under the awe, and in the fear of Rule 3.
God continually, as ever you hope to be successful in the Mortification of
sin. The fear of God is the great preservative from sin, without which all the
external rules and helps in the world signify nothing. By the fear of the Lord
men depart from evil. Prove. 16. 6. Not only from external and more open evils,
which the fear of men as well as the fear of God may prevent, but from the most
secret, and inward evils, which is a special part of Mortification. Levit. 19.
14. It keeps men from those evils which no eye, nor ear of man can possibly
discover. The fear of the Lord breaks Temptations baited with pleasure, with
profit and with secrecy. In a word, if ever you be cleansed from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, it must be by the fear of God. 2 Cor. 7. 1.

4. Rule.
Study the vanity of the creature, and labor to get true Rule 4.
notions of the emptiness, and transitoriness thereof, if ever you will attain
to the Mortification of your affections toward Readers, if ever you would have
a true sight of the emptiness and vanity of the creature, and get a mortified
heart to the world; now is the time, for at this day the providence of God has
withered all the fading flowers of earthly delights, and showed you the worlds
back parts, as it is departing from you.
it. It Is the false picture and image of the world in our fancy, that crucifies
us with so many cares, fears, and solicitudes about it: and it is the true
picture and image of the world, represented to us in the glass of the word,
which greatly helps to crucify our affections to the world. O if we did but
know and believe three things about the world, we would never be so fond of it
as we are, viz. the fading, defiling, and destroying nature of it: the best and
sweetest enjoyments of the world are but fading flowers, and withering grass,
Isa. 14. 6. James 1. 10, 11. Yea, it is of a defiling as well as a fading
nature, 1 John 5. 19. It lies in wickedness, it spreads universal infection
umong all mankind, 2 Pet. 1. 4. Yea, it destroys, as well as defiles
multitudes of souls, drowning men in perdition, 1 Timothy 6. 9. Millions of souls
will wish to eternity they had never known the riches, pleasures, or honors of
it: were this believed, how would men slack their pace, and cool themselves in
the violent and eager pursuit of the world! This greatly tends to promote
Mortification.

5. Rule.
Be careful to cut off all the occasions of sin, and keep at the greatest
distance from temptations, if ever you will mortify Rule 5.
the deeds of the body. The success and prevalency of sin mainly depends upon
the wiles and stratagems it makes use of, to ensnare the incautelous soul,
therefore the Apostle bids us keep off at the greatest distance, 1 These. 5. 22.
Abstain from all appearance of evil, Prove. 8. 8. Come not nigh unto the door of
her house. He that dares venture to the very brink of sin, discovers but little
light in his understanding, and less tenderness in his conscience, he neither
knows sin, nor fears it as he ought to do: and it is usual with God to chastise
self-confidence by shameful lapses into sin.

6. Rule.
If you will successfully mortific the corruptions of your nature, never engage
against them in your own single strength, Rule 6.
Ephesians. 6. 10. When the Apostle draws forth Christians into the field against
sin, he bids them be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. O
remember what a mere feather thou art in the gusts of Temptation. Call to mind
the height of Peter's confidence, though all men forsake thee, yet will not I,
and the depth of his fall, shame and sorrow. A weak Christian trembling in
himself, depending by faith upon God, and graciously assisted by him, shall be
able to stand against the shock of temptation, when the bold and confident
resolutions of others (like Pendleton in our English story) shall melt away as
wax before the flames.

7. Rule.
Set in with the mortifying design of God in the day of thine affliction.
Sanctified afflictions are ordered and prescribed in Rule 7.
heaven for the purging of our corruptions. Isa. 27. 9. By this therefore shall
the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his
sin. It Is a fair glass to represent the evil of sin, and the vanity of the
creature, to imbitter the world, and disgust thy affections toward it: fall in
therefore with the gracious design of God, follow home every affliction with
prayer, that God would follow it with his blessing. God kills thy comforts out
of no other design but to kill thy corruptions with them. Wants are ordained to
kill wantonness: poverty is appointed to kill pride, reproaches are permitted
to pull down ambition: Happy is the man who understands, approves, and heartily
sets in with the design of God in such afflicting providence.

8. Rule.
Bend the strength of your duties and endeavors against Rule 8.
your proper and special sin: It Is in vain to lop off branches, whilst this
root of bitterness remains untouched: This was David's practice, Psalm. 18. 23. I
was also upright before him, and I kept my self from mine iniquity. We observe
in natural men, that one faculty is more vigorous than another: We find in
nature that our soil suits with this seed, rather than another: and every
believer may find his nature and constitution inclining him to one sin rather
than another. As graces, so corruptions excel one another even in the
regenerate. The power of special corruptions arises from our constitutions,
education, company, custom, callings, and such like occasions. But from
whencesoever it comes, this is the sin that most endangers us, most easily
besets us, and according to the progress of mortification in that fin, we may
safely estimate the degrees of mortification in other sins: strike therefore at
the life and root of your own iniquity.

9. Rule.
Study the nature and great importance of those things Rule 9.
which are to be won or lost, according to the success and issue of this
conflict: your life is as a race, eternal glory is the prize, grace and
corruption are the antagonists, and according as either finally prevails,
eternal life is won or lost. 1 Cor. 9. 24. Know ye not that they which run in a
race, run all, but one receives the prize: So run that ye may obtain. This
consideration will make mortification appear the most rational and necessary
thing to you in the whole world. Shall I lose heaven for indulging the flesh,
and humouring a wanton appetite? God forbid. I keep under my body (says Paul)
and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to
others I my self should be a castaway, 1 Cor. 9. 28.

10. Rule.
Accustom your thoughts to such meditations as are proper Rule. 10.
to mortify sin in your affections, else all endeavors to mortify it will be
but faint and languid. To this purpose I shall recommend the following
Meditations, as proper means to destroy the interest of sin.

1. Meditation.
Consider the evil that is in sin, and how terrible the appearances Meditat. 1.
of God will one day be against those that obey it, in the lust thereof. Romans
1. 18. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men. 1 These. 1. 7, 8, 9. The Lord Jesus shall be revealed
from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them
that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
and from the glory of his power. Let your thoughts dwell much upon the
consideration of the fruits and consequences of sin: It shows its fairest side
to you in the hour of temptation. O but consider how it will look upon you in
the day of affliction, Numb. 22. 23. In that day your sin will find you out:
think what its aspect will be in a dying hour, 1 Cor. 15. 56. The sting of
death is sin. Think what the frightful remembrances of it will be at the bar of
Judgment, when Satan shall accuse, conscience shall upbraid, God shall condemn,
and everlasting burnings shall avenge the evil of it: such thoughts as these
are mortifying thoughts.

2. Meditation.
Think what it cost the Lord Jesus Christ to expiate the guilt Meditat. 2.
of sin by suffering the wrath of the great and terrible God for it in our
room: the meditations of a crucified Christ, are very crucifying meditations
unto sin. Gal. 6. 14. He suffered unspeakable things for sin: it was Divine
wrath which lay upon his soul for it: that wrath of which the prophet says,
Nah. 1. 5, 6. The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, who can stand
before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his
fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. It was the
unmixed, and unallayed wrath, poured out in the fullness of it; even to the last
drop, and shall we be so easily drawn to the Commission of those sins which put
Christ under such sufferings? O do but read such scriptures as these, Luke 22.
44. Mat. 26. 36, 37. Mark 14. 33. And see what a plight sin put the Lord of
glory into: how the wrath of God put him into a sore amazement, a bloody sweat,
and made his soul heavy even unto death.

3. Med.
Consider what a grief, and wound the sins of believers are Med. 3.
to the spirit of God, Ephesians. 4. 30. Ezekiel. 16. 43. Isa. 63. 10. Oh how it vexes,
frets, and grieves the holy Spirit of God! Nothing is more contrary to his
nature. Oh do not that abominable thing which I hate, says the Lord, Jer. 44.
4. Nothing obstructs and crosses the sanctifying design of the Spirit as sin
does, defacing and spoiling the most rare, and admirable workmanship that ever
God wrought in this world, violating all the engagements laid upon us by the
love of the Father, by the death of his Son, by the operations of his Spirit,
in all his illuminations, convictions, compunctions, renovation, preservation,
obsignation, and manifold consolations. Lay this meditation upon thy heart
believer, and say, sicne rependis? Do thou thus requite the Lord, O my
ungrateful heart, for all his goodness? is this the fruit of his temporal,
spiritual, common, and peculiar mercies, which are without number?

4. Med.
Consider with your selves that no real good either of profit Med. 4.
or pleasure can result from sin, you can have no pleasure in it, whatever
others may have, it being against your new nature; and as for that brutish
pleasure, and evanid joy which others have in sin, it can be but for a moment,
for either they must repent, or not repent: if they do repent, the pleasure of
sin will be turned into the gall of Asps here, if they do not repent, it will
terminate in everlasting howlings hereafter: that is a smart question, Romans 6.
21. What fruit had ye in those things whereof ye are now ashamed, for the end
of those things is death. You that are believers must never expect any pleasure
in sin, for you can neither commit it without regret, nor reflect upon it
without shame and confusion: Expect no better consequents of sin, than the
woundings of conscience, and dismal cloudings of the face of God; that is all
the profit of sin. O let these things sink into your heart.

5. Med.
Consider what the damned suffer for those sins which the devil now tempts
you to commit: it has deprived them of all Med. 5.
good, all outward good, Luke 16. 25. all spiritual good, Mat. 25. 41. and of
all hope of enjoying any good for ever. And as it has deprived them of all
good, so it has remedilesly plunged them into all positive misery. Misery from
without, the wrath of God being come upon them to the uttermost, and misery
from within, for their worm dies not, Mark 9. 44. The memory of things past,
the sense of things present, and the fearful expectations of things to come,
are the nibblings and bitings of the worm of conscience, at every bite whereof
damned souls give a dreadful shriek, crying out, O the worm! the worm! Would
any man that is not forsaken by reason, run the hazard of those eternal
miseries for the brutish pleasures of a moment?

6. Med.
Bethink your selves what inexcusable hypocrisy it will be in Med. 6.
you to indulge your selves in the private satisfaction of your lusts, under a
contrary profession of Religion: You are a people that profess holiness and
professedly own your selves to be under the Government and Dominion of Christ,
and must the worthy Name of Christ be only used to cloak and cover your lusts
and corruptions which are so hateful to him? God forbid. You daily pray against
sin, you confess it to God, you bewail it, you pour out supplications for
pardoning and preventing grace, are you in jest or earnest in these solemn
duties of Religion? Certainly, if all those duties produce no mortification,
you do but flatter God with your lips, and put a dreadful cheat upon your own
souls. Nay, do you not frequently censure, and condemn those things in others,
and dare you allow them in your selves? What horrid hypocrisy is this?
Christians are dead to sin, Romans 6. 2. D^ad to it by profession, dead to it by
obligation, dead to it by relation to Christ who died for it, and how shall
they that are so many ways dead to sin live any longer therein? O think not
that God hates sin the less in you, because you are his people: nay, Ipsa
delicta and peccata fidelium odio sunt, and displicent Deo, sed odio simplici,
non redundanti in personam, Davenant, in Col. 1. 10.
that very consideration aggravates it the more, Amos 3. 2.

7. Med.
Consider with your selves what hard things some Christians have chosen to
endure and suffer, rather than they would defile Med. 7.
themselves with guilt; and shall every small temptation ensnare and take your
souls? Read over the Eleventh Chapter to the Hebrews, and see what the saints
have endured to escape sin: no torments were so terrible to them, as the
displeasure of God, and woundings of conscience; and did God oblige them more
by his grace and favor than he has obliged you? O Christians how can you that
have found such mercies, mercies as free, pardons as full as ever any souls
found, show less care, less fear, less tenderness of grieving God than others
have done? Certainly, if you did see sin with the same eyes they saw it, you
would hate it as deeply, watch against it as carefully, and resist it as
vigorously as any of the Saints have done before you.

8. Med.
Consider with your selves what sweet pleasure, rational Med. 8.
and solid comfort is to be found in the mortification of sin: It Is not the
fulfilling of your lusts can give you the thousandth part of that comfort and
contentment that the resistance of them, and victory over them will give you.
Who can express the comfort that is to be found in the chearing testimony of an
acquitting and absolving conscience? 2 Cor. 1. 12. Remember what satisfaction
and peace it was to Hezekiah upon his supposed deathbed, when he turned to the
wall and said, Remember now O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before
thee in truth, and with a perfect heart; and have done that which is good in
thy sight, Isa. 38. 3.

4. Use for Examination.
In the next place this point naturally puts us upon the Examination and trial
of our own hearts, whether we Use 4.
who so confidently claim a special interest in Christ have crucified the flesh
with its affections and lusts; and because two sorts of persons will be
concerned in this Trial, viz. the weaker, and the stronger Christians; I shall
therefore lay down two sorts of Evidences of Mortification, one respecting the
sincerity, and truth, the other respecting the strength, and progress of that
work in confirmed and grown Christians, and both excluding false pretenders.

First, There are some things that are Evidential of the truth and sincerity of
Mortification even in the weakest Christians: as

First, True tenderness of conscience in all known sins, one as well as
another, is a good sign sin has lost its Dominion in the soul? O it is a
special mercy to have a heart that shall smite and reprove us for those things
that others make nothing of: to check and admonish us for our secret sins which
can never turn to our reproach among men: this is a good sign that we hate sin
as sin: however through the weakness of the flesh we may be ensnared by it,
Romans 7. 15. What I hate that I do.

Secondly, The sincere and earnest desires of our souls to God in prayer for
heart-purging and sin-mortifying grace, is a good sign our souls have no love
for sin. Can thou say, poor believer, in the truth of thy heart; that if God
would give thee thy choice, it would please thee better to have sin cast out,
than to have the world cast in; that thy heart is not so earnest with God for
daily bread, as it is for heart-purging grace? this is a comfortable evidence
that sin is nailed to the Cross of Christ.

Thirdly, do you make conscience of guarding against the occasions of sin? Do
you keep a daily watch over your hearts and senses, according to 1 John 5. 18.
Job 31. 1. This speaks a true design and purpose of Mortification also.

Fourthly, do you rejoice and bless God from your hearts when the providence of
God orders any means for the prevention of sin? Thus did David, 1 Samuel 25. 33.
And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee
this day to meet me, and blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou which have
kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging my self with my
own hand.

Fifthly, In a word, though the thoughts of death may be terrible in
themselves, yet if the expectation and hope of your deliverance from sin
thereby, do sweeten the thoughts of it to your souls, it will turn unto you for
a testimony that you are not the servants and friends of sin. And so much
briefly of the first sort of Evidences.

Secondly, There are other signs of a more deep and through Mortification of
sin in more grown and confirmed believers, and such are these.

First, The more submissive and quiet any man is under the will of God in smart
and afflicting providence, the more that man's heart is mortified unto sin.
Psalm. 119. 67, 71. Col. 1. 11.

Secondly, The more able any one is to bear the reproaches and rebukes of his
sin, the more Mortification there is in that man, Psalm. 141. 5.

Thirdly, The more easily any man can resign and give up his dearest earthly
comforts at the call and command of God, the more progress that man has made
in the work of Mortification, Heb. 11. 17. 2 Samuel 15. 25.

Fourthly, The more power any man has to resist sin in the first motions of
it, and stifle it in the birth; the greater degree of Mortification that man
has attained, Romans 7. 23, 24.

Fifthly, If great changes upon our outward condition make no change for the
worse upon our spirits, but we can bear prosperous and adverse providence with
an equal mind; then Mortification is advanced far in our souls, Phil. 4. 11, 12.

Sixthly, The more fixed and steady our hearts are with God in duty, and the
less they are infested with wandering thoughts and earthly interpositions; the
more Mortification there is in that soul. And so much briefly of the Evidences
of Mortification.

5. Use for Consolation.
It only remains that I shut up all with a few words of consolation unto all
that are under the Mortifying influence of the Use 5.
spirit. Much might be said for the comfort of such. In brief,

First, Mortified sin shall never be your ruin: it is only reigning sin that is
ruining sin, Romans 8. 13. Mortified sins, and pardoned sins shall never lie down
with us in the dust.

Secondly, If sin be dying, your souls are living; for dying unto sin, and
living unto God are inseparably connected, Romans 6. 11.

Thirdly, If sin be dying in you, it is certain that Christ died for you, and
you cannot desire a better Evidence of it, Romans 6. 5, 6.

Fourthly, If sin be dying under the Mortifying influences of the spirit, and
it be your daily labor to resist and overcome it, you are then in the direct
way to heaven, and eternal salvation; which few, very few in the world shall
find, Luke 13. 24.

Fifthly, To shut up all, if you through the spirit be daily mortifying the
deeds of the body, then the death of Christ is effectually applied by the
spirit unto your souls, and your interest in him is unquestionable: for they
that are Christ's have Crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts, and
they that have so Crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts, are
Christ's.

Blessed be God for a Crucified Christ.

to walk, even as he walked.
THe express and principal design of the Apostle in this Chapter, is to
propound marks and signs both Negative and Positive, for the trial and
examination of men's claims to Christ; amongst which (not to spend time about
the Coherence) my Text is a principal one: a trial of men's interest in Christ
by their imitation of Christ. It is supposed by some Expositors that the
Apostle in laying down this mark had a special design to overthrow the wicked
Doctrine of the Carpocratians (...) taught (as Epiphanius relates it) that men
might have as much Communion with God in sin, as in duty. In full opposition to
which the Apostle lays down this Proposition, wherein he asserts the necessity
of a Christ-like conversation in all that claim Union with him or interest in
him. The words resolve themselves into two parts.

Viz. 1. A Claim to Christ supposed. 2. The only way to have our claim
warranted.

First, We have here a claim to Christ supposed; if any 1.
man say he abides in him: abiding in Christ is an expression denoting proper
and real interest in Christ, and communion with him: for it is put in
opposition to those temporary, light and transient effects of the Gospel, which
are called a morning dew, or an early cloud: such a receiving of Christ as
that, Mat. 13. 21. which is but a present flash, a sudden vanishing pang:
abiding in Christ notes a solid, durable and effectual work of the Spirit,
thoroughly and everlastingly joining the soul to Christ. Now, if any man
whosoever he be (for this indefinite is equivalent to an universal term) let
him never think his claim to be good and valid, except he take this course to
adjust it.

Secondly, The only way to have this claim warranted, 2.
and that must be by so walking even as he walked: which words carry in them
the necessity of our imitation of Christ. But it is not to be understood
indifferently and universally of all the works or actions of Christ, some of
which were extraordinary and miraculous; some purely mediatory and not imitable
by us: in these paths no Christian can follow Christ; nor may so much as
attempt to walk as he walked. But the words point at the ordinary and imitable
ways and works of Christ: therein it must be the care of all to follow him,
that profess and claim interest in him: they must so walk as he walked: this
[so] is a very bearing word in this place; the emphasis of the Text seems to
lie in it: however, certain it is that this so walking does not imply an
equality with Christ in holiness and obedience: for as he was filled with the
spirit without measure, and anointed with that oil of gladness above his
fellows, so the purity, holiness and obedience of his life is never to be
matched and equallized by any of the Saints. But this so walking only notes a
sincere intention, design and endeavor to imitate and follow him in all the
paths of holiness and obedience according to the different measures of grace
received. The life of Christ is the Believers copy, and though the Believer
cannot draw one line or letter exact as his copy is, yet his eye is still upon
it, he is looking unto Jesus, Heb. 12. 2. and laboring to draw all the lines
of his life as agreeably as he is able unto Christ his pattern.

Hence the Observation is,

DOCT.
That every man is bound to the imitation of Christ under penalty Doct.
of forfeiting his claim to Christ.

The Saints imitation of Christ is solemnly enjoined by many Christiani (...)
Christo nomen acceperunt, and operae pretium est, ut sicut sunt ^eraedes
nominis, ita sint imitatores sanctitatis. Bern. sent. lib. p. 436.
great and express commands of the Gospel: so you find it, 1 Pet. 1. 15. But as
he that has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation:
So Ephesians. 5. 1, 2. Be ye therefore followers of God as dear Children, and walk in
love as Christ also has loved us. Christians (says Bernard) receive this name
from Christ: and it is very meet that as they inherit his name, so they should
also imitate his holiness. Now to state the method of this Discourse, it will
be needful to discuss and open three things in the doctrinal part.

1. What the Saints imitation of Christ supposes and comprizes. 2. In what
particulars they are especially bound to imitate Christ. 3. Why no claim to
Christ is valid without this imitation of him.
And then apply the whole in diverse Uses.

First, What the Saints imitation of Christ supposes and comprizeth. Now there
are diverse great and weighty truths 1.
supposed and employed in this imitation of Christ; or walking as he walked, viz.

First, It supposes that no Christian is or may pretend to be a rule to
himself, to act according to the dictates of his own will and pleasure: for as
no man has wisdom enough to direct and govern himself; so if his own will were
made the rule of his own actions, it would be the highest invasion of the
divine prerogative that could be imagined: I know, O Lord, (says Jeremy) that
the way of man is not in himself, it is not in him that walks to direct his
own steps, Jer. 10. 23. We may as well pretend to be our own makers as our own
guides. It is a pretty observation of Aquinas, that if the workmans hand were
the rule of his work, it were impossible he should ever err in working: and if
the will of man were the only law and guide of his way, we might then say no
man would sin in his walking. The Apostle indeed says of the Heathens, Romans 2.
14. that they are a law to themselves; but it is not his meaning that their
will is their law, but the law of God engraven upon their hearts: the light and
dictates of their own Consciences, did oblige and bind them as a law.

Secondly, This imitation of Christ implies, that as no man is or may pretend
to be his own guide, so no mere man how wise or holy soever he be, may pretend
to be a rule to other men: but Christ is the rule of every man's way and
walking. It Is true indeed, the Apostle says, We should be followers of them,
who through faith and patience inherit the promises, Heb. 6. 12. And again,
James 5. 10. Take my Brethren the Prophets who have spoken in the name of the
Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience: but you must
always remember that there is a twofold rule.

1. Regula regulans, the rule, ruling. 2. Regula regulata, the rule ruled.
The wisest and holiest among men may pretend no higher than a ruled rule. The
great Apostle, though filled with as great a measure of the spirit of wisdom
and holiness as ever was possessed by any mere man; yet goes no higher than
this, 1 Cor. 11. 1. Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ. The best of
men are but men at best: they have their errors and defects which they freely
acknowledge: and where they differ from Christ, it is our duty to differ from
them: we may not pin our faith upon any man's sleeve, for we know not where he
will carry it. It was the commendation which Paul gave of the Thessalonians, 1
These. 1. 6. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord. The noble Bereans
were also commended for searching the Scriptures and examining the Nec ego te,
nec t^ me, sed am^o audiemu^ Christum. Aug.
Apostles doctrine by it: and it was a good reply of the Eather, to a clamorous
disputant crying hear me, hear me, I will neither hear thee, nor do thou hear
me; but let us both hear Christ.

Thirdly, The imitation of Christ implies the necessity of sanctification in
all his followers: for as much as it is impossible there should be a practical
conformity in point of obedience, where there is not a conformity in spirit and
principle; all external conformity to Christ's practice, depends upon an
internal conformity to Christ in the principle and spirit of holiness. It Is
very plain from Ezekiel. 11. 19, 20. that a new heart must be given us, and a new
spirit put into us, before we can walk in Gods statutes: we must first live in
the spirit, before we can walk in the spirit, Gal. 5. 25.

Fourthly, The imitation of Christ plainly holds forth this, that Christian
religion is a very precise and strict religion; no way countenancing
licentiousness, or indulging men in their lusts: it allows no man to walk
loosely and inordinately; but rejects every man's claim to Christ who studies
and labors not to tread exactly in the footsteps of his holy and heavenly
example. Profaneness and licentiousness therefore can find no shelter or
protection under the wing of the Gospel: this is the universal rule laid upon
all the professors of the Christian Religion: Let every one that names the
name of Christ, depart from iniquity, 2 Timothy 2. 19. (i. e.) let him either put
on the life of Christ, or put off the name of Christ: let him show the hand of
a Christian in works of holiness and obedience, or else the tongue and language
of a Christian must gain no belief or credit.

Fifthly, The imitation of Christ necessarily implies the defectiveness and
imperfection of the best men in this life: for if the life of Christ be our
pattern; the best and holiest of men must confess they come short in every
thing of the rule of their duty. Our pattern is still above us; the best of men
are ashamed when they compare their lives with the life of Christ. It Is true, a
vain heart may swell with pride when a man compares himself with other men:
thus measuring our selves by our selves, and comparing our selves among our
selves we show our folly, and nourish our pride: but if any man will compare
his own life with Christ's, he will find abundant cause at every time, and in
every thing to be humbled. Paul was a great proficient in holiness and
obedience; he had been long striving to come up to the top of holiness; yet
when he looks up and sees the life of Christ, and rule of duty so far above
him, he reckons himself still but at the foot of the Hill, Phil. 3. 12. Not as
though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after,
if that I may apprehend, that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
q. d. Alas I am not come up to my duty; I am a a great way behind, but I am
following after, if at last I may attain it: perfection is in my expectation
and hope at last, not in my attainment here.

Sixthly, The imitation of Christ as our general rule and pattern, necessarily
implies the transcending holiness of Primum and optimum in unoquoque genere est
regula and mensura caeterorum.
the Lord Jesus. His holiness is greater than the holiness of all creatures:
for only that which is first and best in every kind, is the rule and measure of
all the rest. It Is the height of Saints ambition to be made conformable to
Christ, Phil. 3. 10. Christ has a double perfection, a perfection of being,
and a perfection of working: his life was a perfect rule, no blot or error
could be found therein; for he was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
sinners: and such an High Priest became us as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 7. 26.
The conformity of professors to Christ's example is the test and measure of all
their graces: the nearer any man comes to this pattern, the nearer he
approaches toward perfection.

Seventhly, The Christians imitation of Christ, under penalty of losing his
claim to Christ, necessarily implies sanctification and obedience to be the
evidences of our justification and interest in Christ: assurance is
unattainable without obedience, we can never be comfortable Christians except
we be strict and regular Christians, Gal. 6. 16. As many as walk according to
this rule, peace be on them, and mercy; and upon the Israel of God. A loose and
careless conversation can never be productive of true peace and consolation, 2
Cor. 1. 12. This is our rejoicing, the testimony of our Conscience; that in
simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of
God; we have had our conversation in the world. Let men talk what they will of
the immediate sealings and comforts of the spirit without any regard to
holiness, or respect to obedience; Sure I am, whatever delusion they meet with
in that way; true peace and consolation is only to be expected and found here:
The fruit of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness
quietness, and assurance for ever: We have it not for our holiness, but we
always have it in the way of holiness. And so much of the first particular,
namely, what the imitation of Christ implies and comprizes in it.

Secondly, In the next place we are to enquire in what 2.
things all that profess Christ are obliged to the imitation of him; or what
those excellent graces in the life of Christ were, which are propounded as
patterns to the Saints.

The life of Christ was a living law; all the graces and Quid vobis cum
virtutibus qui virtutem Christi ignoratis? Ubinam, quaeso, vera prudentia, nisi
in Christi doctrina? Ubi vera temperantia, nisi in Christi vita? Ubi vera
fortitudo, nisi in Christi passione? Bernard.
virtues of the Spirit were represented in their glory, and brightest luster in
his conversation upon earth: never man spoke as he spoke; never any lived as he
lived: we beheld his glory (says the Evangelist) as the glory of the only
begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, John 1. 14. But to descend to
the particular imitable excellencies in the life of Christ, which are high
patterns and excellent rules for the conversations of his people, we shall from
among many others single out the ten following Particulars which we are obliged
to imitate.

Pattern 1.
And first of all, the purity and holiness of the life of Christ is proposed as
a glorious pattern for the Saints imitation, 1 Pet. 1. 15. As he which has
called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation: (...), in
every creek and turning of your lives. There is a twofold holiness in Christ;
the holiness of his nature and the holiness of his practice; his holy being,
and his holy working: this obliges all that profess interest in him, to a
twofold holiness, viz. holiness in actu primo, in the principles of it in their
hearts; and holiness in actu secundo, in the practice and exercise of it in
their conversations: it is very true, we cannot in all respects imitate the
holiness of Christ; for he is essentially holy; proceeding by nature, as a pure
beam of holiness from the Father: and when he was incarnate he came into the
world immaculate, and pure from the least stain of pollution; therefore it was
said, Luke 1. 25. That holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called
the Son of God: in this we can never be like Christ in the way of our
production: for who can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean? not
one. The Lord Jesus was also efficiently holy, (i. e.) he makes others holy:
therefore his sufferings and blood are called a fountain opened for sin and for
uncleanness, (i. e.) to cleanse other men's souls, Zech. 13. 1. in this Christ
also is inimitable: no man can make himself or others holy. That Is a great
truth though it will hardly go down with proud nature, minus est te fecisse
hominem, quam sanctum, we may sooner make our selves to be men than to be
Saints. Beside, Christ is infinitely holy as he is God, and there are no stints
or measures set to his holiness as Mediator, John 3. 34. for God gives not the
spirit by measure unto him. But notwithstanding these excepted respects, the
holiness of Christ is propounded as a pattern for our imitation six ways.

First, He was truly and sincerely holy, without fiction or simulation: and
this appeared in the greatest trial of the truth of holiness that ever was made
in this world, John 14. 30. The Prince of this world comes, and has nothing
in me: when he was agitated and shaken with the greatest temptations, no
Galaxia est maxima frequentia minimarum stellarum, quae prae exiguitate ad
nostrum aspectum distinct pervenire nequ^unt, ut caeterae stellae, atque ita
inter se lumen commiscent, and confundunt, Conimb. de Meteor. cap 2.
dregs appeared; he was like pure fountain water in a Crystal Glass. The
hypocrite makes show of more holiness than he has* but there was more holiness
in Christ, than ever appeared to the view of men. We may say of the way of
Christ, what the Philosopher says of the milky way in the Heavens; that those
faint streams of light which we see there, are nothing else but the reflection
of innumerable Stars which shine there, though they be invisible to us: there
was much inward beauty in him, and so there ought to be in all his followers;
our holiness, like Christ's, must be sincere and real, Ephesians. 4. 24. shining with
inward beauty toward God rather than toward men.

Secondly, Christ was uniformly holy, at one time as well as another; in one
place and company as well as another; he was still like himself, an holy
Christ: one and the same tenor of holiness ran thoughout his whole life, from
first to last: so must it be with all his people: holy in all manner of
conversation. Christians, look to your copy, and be sure to imitate Christ in
this; write fair after your Copy; let there not be here a word and there a
blot; one part of your life heavenly, and pure, and another earthly, and
dreggy: or (as one expresses it) now an heavenly rapture, and by and by a
fleshly frolic.

Thirdly, Christ was exemplarily holy: a pattern of holiness to all that came
nigh him, and conversed with him. O imitate Christ in this. It was the
commendation of the Thessalonians that they were ensamples to all that believed
in Macedonia, and Achaia, and that in every place their faith to Godward was
spread abroad, 1 These. 1. 7, 8. Let no man go out of your company without
conviction or edification; so exemplary were the primitive Christians, Phil. 3.
17.

Fourthly, Christ was strictly and precisely holy; which of you convinces me
of sin? The most envious and observing eyes of his greatest enemies could not
pick a hole, or find a flaw in any of his words or actions: it is our duty to
imitate Christ in this, Phil. 2. 15. That ye may be blameless and harmless, the
sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
among whom ye shine (or as the word may be rendered imperatively, among whom
shine ye,) as lights in the world. Thus (...).
it becomes the followers of Christ to walk circumspectly or precisely, for so
is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of
foolish men, 1 Pet. 2. 15.

Fifthly, Christ was perseveringly holy, holy to the last breath; as he began,
so he finished his whole life in a constant course of holiness: in this also he
is our great pattern: it becomes not any of his people to begin in the spirit,
and end in the flesh: but on the contrary, their last works should be more than
their first; let him that is holy be holy still, Rev. 22. 11.

Sixthly, In a word, the delight of Christ was only in holy things and holy
persons; they were his chosen companions: even so it becomes his people to
have all their delights in the saints and in the excellent of the earth, Psalm.
16. 3. Thus Christians, be ye followers of Christ in his holiness: God has
decreed this conformity to Christ in all that shall be saved, Romans 8. 29. he
banisheth all unholy ones from his gracious presence for ever, 1 Cor. 6. 9.
Heb. 12. 14. The design of Christ in dying for you was to make you pure and
holy, Ephesians. 5. 25, 26. O then study holiness; eye your pattern; and as dear
Children be ye followers of your most holy Lord Jesus Christ.

Pattern 2.
The obedience of Christ to his Fathers will is a pattern for the imitation of
all Christians: it is said of Christ, Heb. 5. 8. that he learned obedience by
the things which he suffered; a Text which labors under some difficulties:
Christ learned obedience, and yet was not ignorant before of what he learned
afterward: he was perfect in knowledge; and yet the Apostle speaks of him as a
proficient in the School of Wisdom. But we must consider there are two ways of
learning, viz.

By 1. The comprehension of the mind. 2. By the experience of the sense.

Christ as God was perfect in knowledge; nothing could be added to him: but
when he became man, then he came to understand or learn by sufferings as the
Apostle here speaks; which though it added nothing to his knowledge, yet it was
a new method and way of knowing. Now the obedience of Christ is our pattern
whereunto we are obliged (as ever we will warrant our claim of interest in him)
to conform our selves in the following properties of it.

First, Christ's obedience was free and voluntary, not forced or compulsory: it
was so from the very first undertakement of the work of our redemption, Prove.
8. 30, 31. Then was I by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his
delight, rejoicing always before him: rejoicing in the habitable part of his
earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. And when the fullness of time
was come for executing that blessed design which had been in prospect from all
eternity, how cheerfully did the will of Christ echo to his Fathers call, Psalm.
40. 7. Then said I, Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me,
I delight to do thy will, O my God, yea, thy Law is within my heart. Nor was
this a flourish before he came into the field, and saw the enemy; for he laid
down his life with the greatest cheerfulness and spontaneity that could be,
John 10. 17, 18. Therefore does my father love me, because I lay down my life
that I might take it again; no man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my
self: and indeed the voluntariness of Christ in his obedience unto death gave
his death the nature and sormality of a sacrifice, for so all sacrifices ought
to be offered, Lev. 1. 3. and so Christ's sacrifice was offered unto God, Ephesians.
5. 2. It was as grateful a work to Christ to dye for us, as it was to Moses his
mother to take him to nurse from the hand of Pharaohs daughter. O Christians,
tread in the steps of Christ's example: do nothing grudgingly for God, let not
his commands be grievous, 1 John 5. 3. If you do any thing for God willingly,
you have a reward; if otherwise, a dispensation only is committed to you, 1
Cor. 9. 7. Obedience in Christ was an abasement to him, but in you a very great
honor and advancement, you have reason therefore to obey with cheerfulness.

Secondly, The obedience of Christ was universal and complete, he was obedient
to all the will of God, making no demur to the hardest service imposed by the
will of God upon him, Phil. 2. 8. He became obedient unto death, even the death
of the Cross: and though it is true the humanity of Christ recoyled and
staggered when that bitter cup of the wrath of God was given him to drink; yet
how soon was that innocent aversation overcome in him by a perfect submission?
nevertheless not my will, but thine be done, Mat. 26. 39. Christians here is
your pattern: happy art thou Reader, if thou can say when God calls thee to
suffering, and self denying work, I am filled with the will of God. Such was
Paul's obedience. Acts 21. 13. I am ready not only to be bound, but to die at
Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

Thirdly, The obedience of Christ was sincere and pure, without any base or by
end, purely aiming at the glory of God. Joh. 17. 4. I have glorified thee on
earth, I have finished the work thou gave me to do. He sought not honor of
men. This was the great desire of his soul, John 12. 28. Father glorify thy
name: and truly the choicest part of your obedience consists in the purity of
your ends, and in this Christ is propounded as your pattern, Phil. 2. 3, 4, 5.

Fourthly, The streams of Christ's obedience flowed from the spring and fountain
of ardent love to God. Joh. 14. 31. But that the world may know that I love the
Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do: Thus let all your
obedience to God turn upon the hinge of love. For love is the fulfilling of the
law, Romans 13. 10. Not as if no other duty but love were required in the law;
but because no act of obedience is acceptable to God, but that which is
performed in love.

Fifthly, In a word, The obedience of Christ was constant, he was obedient unto
the death, he was not weary of his work to the last. Such a patient continuance
in well doing is one part of your conformity to Christ, Romans 2. 7. it is laid
upon you by his own express command, and a command backed with the most
encouraging promise, Rev. 2. 10. Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will
give thee the crown of life.

Pattern 3.
The self-denial of Christ is the pattern of believers, and their Conformity
unto it is their indispensable duty. Phil. 2. Vulpibus in saltu rupes excisa
latebr as Praebet and aereis avibus dat sylva quietem: Ast hominis nato nullis
succedere tectis Est licitum. Heinsius.
4, 5, 6. 2 Cor. 8. 9. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his
poverty might be rich. Jesus Christ for the glory of God, and the love he bare
to the elect, denied himself all the delights and pleasures of this world, Mat.
20. 28. The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
give his life a ransom for many, he was all his life long in the world a man of
sorrows and acquainted with grief, Isa. 53. 3. more unprovided of comfortable
accommodations, than the birds of the air, or beasts of the earth. Luke 9. 58.
The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man
has not where to lay his head. Yet this was the least part of Christ's
self-denial: what did he not deny when he left the bosom of his Father with the
ineffable delights and pleasures he there enjoyed from Eternity, and instead
thereof to drink the cup, the bitter cup of his Fathers wrath for our sakes? O
Christians, look to your pattern; and imitate your self-denying Savior. There
is a threesold self you are to deny for Christ.

First, Deny your natural self for him, Luke 14. 26. Hate your own life in
competition with his glory as well as your natural lusts, Titus 2. 12.

Secondly, Deny your Civil self for Christ: whether they be gifts of the mind,
Phil. 3. 8. or your dearest relations in the world, Luke 14. 26.

Thirdly, deny your moral and religious self for Christ, your own
righteousness, Phil. 3. 10. deny sinful self absolutely, Col. 3. 4, 5. Deny
natural self conditionally (i. e.) be ready to forsake its interests at the
call of God. Deny your religious self, even your own graces comparatively, not
in the notion of duties, but in the notion of righteousness: and to encourage
you in this difficult work consider,

First, what great things Christ denied for you, and what small matters you
have to deny for him.

Secondly, how readily he denied all for your sakes, making no objections
against the difficultest commands.

Thirdly, How incapable you are to put any obligation upon Christ to deny
himself in the least for you, and what strong obligations Christ has put you
under to deny your selves in your greatest interests upon earth for him.

Fourthly, Remember that your self-denial is a condition consented to, and
subscribed by your selves, if ever you received Christ aright.

Fifthly, In a word, Consider how much your self-denial for Christ makes for
your advantage in both worlds, Luke 18. 29. O therefore look not every man upon
his own things, but upon the things that are of Christ, let not that be justly
charged upon you which was charged upon them, Phil. 2. 21. All seek their own,
not the things which are Christ's.

Pattern 4.
The activity and diligence of Christ in finishing the work of God which was
committed to him as a pattern for all believers to imitate. It Is said of him,
Acts 10. 38. He went about doing good. O what a great and glorious work did
Christ finish in a little time! a work to be celebrated to all Eternity by the
praises of the redeemed. Six things were very remarkable in the diligence of
Christ about his Fathers work.

First, That his heart was intently set upon it. Psalm. 4. 8. Thy Law is in the
midst of my heart, or bowels.

Secondly, That he never sainted under the many great discouragements he
frequently met withal in that work. Isa. 42. 4. He shall not fail, nor be
discouraged.

Thirdly, That the shortness of his time provoked him to the greatest
diligence. John 9. 4. I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day,
for the night comes when no man can work.

Fourthly, That he improved all opportunities, companies, and occurrences to
further the great work which was under his hand. John 4. 6, 10.

Fifthly, nothing more displeased him than when he met with disswasions, and
discouragements in his work; upon that acc^t it was that he gave Peter so sharp
a check, Mat. 8. 33. Get thee behind me Satan.

Sixthly, Nothing rejoiced his soul more than the prosperity and success of his
work. Luke 10. 20, 21. When the Disciples made the report of the success of
their Ministry, it is said, in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit. And O what a
triumphant shout was that upon the cross at the accomplishment of his work,
John 19. 30. It is finished.

Now Christians, eye your Pattern, look unto Jesus, trifle not away your lives
in vanity. Christ was diligent, be not you slothful. And to encourage you in
your imitation of Christ in labor, and diligence, consider,

First, How great an honor God puts upon you in employing you for his service:
Every vessel of service is a vessel of honor, 2 Timothy 2. 21. The Apostle was
very ambitious of that honor, Romans 15. 20. It was the glory of Eliakim to
(...), ambio, dictum verbum ab amore honoris. Zanch.
be fastened as a nail in a sure place, and to have many people hang upon him,
Isa. 22. 33.

Secondly, Your diligence in the work of God will be your great security in the
hour of temptation, for the Lord is with you, while you are with him, 2 Chronicles.
15. 2. The Schoolmen put the question: How the saints in heaven become
impeccable? and resolve it thus, that they are therefore freed from sin,
because they are continually employed and swallowed up in the blessed visions
of God.

Thirdly, Diligence in the work of God is an excellent help to the improvement
of grace. For though gracious habits are not acquired, yet they are greatly
improved by frequent acts. To him that has shall be given, Mat. 25. 29. It is
a good note of Luther, Fides pinguescit oper^us, Faith is made fat by obedience.

Fourthly, Diligence in the work of God is the direct way to the assurance of
the love of God, 2 Pet. 15. 10. This path leads you into heaven upon earth.

Fifthly, Diligence in obedience is a great security against backsliding: Small
remissions in duty, and little neglects increase by degrees unto great
Apostasies, you may see how that disease is bred, by the method prescribed for
its cure, Rev. 2. 5. Do thy first works.

Sixthly, In a word, laborious diligence in the day of life will be your
singular comfort when the night of death over takes you. 2 Pet. 1. 11. 2 Kings
20. 3.

Pattern 5.
Delight in God and in his service was eminently conspicuous in the life of
Christ, and is a rare pattern for believers imitation. John 4. 32, 34. But he
said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not of, my meat is to do the
will of him that sent me and to finish his work. The delights of Christ were
all in heaven. The Son of man was in heaven in respect of delight in God, while
he conversed here among men. And if you be Christ's, heavenly things will be the
delight of your souls also. Now spiritual delight is nothing else but the
complacency, and well-pleasedness of a renewed heart in conversing with God,
and the things of God: resulting from the agreeableness of them to the
spiritual temper of his mind. Four things are considerable about spiritual
delights.

First, The nature of it, which consists in the complacency, rest, and
satisfaction of the mind in God, and spiritual things. The heart of a Christian
is centred, it is where it would be; it is gratified in the highest in the
actings forth of faith and love upon God; as the taste is gratified with a
suitable delicious relish, Psalm. 63. 5, 6. Psalm. 119. 14, 24. Psalm. 17. 18.

Secondly, The object of spiritual delight which is God himself and the things
which relate to him. He is the blessed Ocean into which all the streams of
spiritual delight do pour themselves, Psalm. 73. 25. Whom have I in heaven but
thee, and on earth there is none that I desire incomparison of thee.

Thirdly, The subject of spiritual delight, which is a renewed heart, and that
only so far as it is renewed, Romans 7. 22. I delight in the Law of God after the
inward man.

Fourthly, The principle and spring of this delight which is the agreeable ess
of spiritual things to the temper and frame of a renewed mind. A sensitive
pleasure arises from the suitableness of the faculty, and object. So it is
here, no delicious sweetness can be so pleasant to the taste, or beautiful
colors to the eye, or melodious sounds to the ear, as spiritual things to the
renewed souls, because spiritual senses are delicate, and the objects more
excellent.

But my business here is not so much to open its nature, as press you to the
practice thereof in conformity to your great pattern, whose life was a life of
delight in God, and whose work was performed with the greatest delight for God.
I delight to do thy will O my God. O Christians strive to imitate your pattern
in this; and to encourage you, I will briefly hint a few things.

First, Scarce any thing can be more evidential of sincerity than a heart
delighting in God, and the will of God. Hypocrites go as far as others in the
material part of duties, but here they are defective, they have no delight in
God and things spiritual; but do whatsoever they do in Religion from the
compulsions of conscience, or accommodations of self ends.

Secondly, An heart delighting in God will be a choice help and means to
perseverance. The reason why many so easily part with Religion is, because
their souls never tasted the sweetness of it: they never delighted in it, but
the Christian who delights in the Law of God, will be meditating day and night,
and shall be like a tree planted by a river of water whose leaf fades not,
Psalm. 1. 2, 3.

Thirdly, This will represent Religion very beautifully, and takingly to such
as are yet strangers to it: you will then be able to invite them to Christ by
your example, the language whereof will be like that, Psalm. 34. 8. O taste and
see that God is good.

Fourthly, This will make all your services to God very pleasing and acceptable
through Christ, you will now begin to do the will of God on earth, as it is
done in heaven, your duties are so far Angelical as they are performed in the
strength of delight in God.

But may not a sincere Christian act in duty without delight? Obj.
yea, may he not feel some kind of weariness in duties?

Yes, doubtless he may, but then we must distinguish betwixt the Temper and
Distemper of a renewed heart, the best hearts Sol.
are not always in their right frame.

Pattern 6.
The inoffensiveness of the life of Christ upon earth is an excellent pattern
to all his people: he injured none, offended none, but was holy and harmless,
as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 7. 26. He denied his own liberty to avoid occasion
of offense; as in the case of the Tribute Money, Mat. 19. 27. The children are
free, notwithstanding lest we should offend them go, etc. So circumspect was
Christ, and inoffensive among all men, that though his enemies sought occasion
against him, yet could they find none, Luke 6. 7. Look unto Jesus, O ye
professors of Religion, imitate him in this gracious excellency of his life
according to his command, Phil. 2. 15. That ye may be harmless and blameless,
the Sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.
You are indeed allowed the exercise of your prudence, but not a jot farther
than will consist with your innocence. Be ye wise as Serpents, and harmless as
Doves. It Is the rule of Christ that you offend none, 1 Cor. 10. 32. 2 Cor. 6.
3. And to engage you to the imitation of Christ in this I will briefly press it
with a few encouragements, which methinks should prevail with any heart that is
truly gracious.

First, For the honor of Jesus Christ be you inoffensive, his name is called
upon you, his honor is concerned in your deportment: if your carriage in the
world give just matter of offense, Christ's worthy name will be blasphemed
thereby, James 2. 7. Your inoffensive carriage is the only means to stop the
mouths of detractours, 1 Pet. 2. 15.

Secondly, For the sake of souls, the precious immortal souls of others be wary
that you give no offense: woe to the world says Christ because of offenses,
Mat. 13. 7. Nothing was more commonly objected against Christ and religion by
the heathen in Cyprians time, than the loose and scandalous lives of
professors: Behold say they, these are the men who Ecce qui jactant se
redemptosa tyranni. de Satanae, qui praedicant se mortuos esse mundo, nibi
lominus vincuntur cu^iditatibus s^is. Cyprian.
boast themselves to be redeemed from the tyranny of Satan, to be dead to the
world: nevertheless see how they are overcome by their own lusts. And much
after the same rate Salvian brings in the wicked of his time, stumbling at the
looseness of professors, and saying, Where is that Catholic Law which they
believe? where are the examples of piety, and chastity which they have learned,
etc. O Christians, draw not the guilt of other men's eternal ruin upon your
souls.

Thirdly, In a word, answer the ends of God in your sanctification, and
providential dispose in the world this way; by the holiness and harmlesness of
your lives, many may be won to Christ. 1 Pet. 3. 1. What the heathens said of
moral virtue (which they called verticordia turn-heart) that if it were but
visible to mortal eyes, all men would be enamoured upon it, will be much more
true of Religion when you shall represent the beauty of it in your
conversations.

Pattern 7.
The humility and lowliness of Christ is propounded by himself as a pattern for
his peoples imitation. Mat. 11. 29. Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly. He
could abase and empty himself of all his glory, Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7. He could
stoop to the meanest office, even to wash the disciples feet. We read but of
one triumph in all the life of Christ upon earth, when he rode to Jerusalem,
the people strewing branches in the way, and the very children in the streets
of Jerusalem crying Hosanna to the Son of David, Hosanna in the highest; and
yet with what lowliness and humility was it performed by Christ, Mat. 21. 5.
Behold thy King comes unto thee meek and lowly. The humility of Christ
appeared in every thing he spoke, or did. Humility discovered it self in his
language, Psalm. 22. 6. I am a wor^ and no man. In his actions, not refusing the
meanest office, Joh. 13. 14. In his condescensions to the worst of men, upon
which ground they called him a friend of Publicans and sinners, Mat. 11. 19.
But especially and above all, in stooping down from all his glory to a state of
deepest contempt for the glory of God, and oursalvation. Christians, here is
your pattern, look to your meek and humble Savior, and tread in his steps, be
you clothed with humility, 1 Pet. 5. 5. Whoever are ambitious to be the worlds
great ones, let it be enough for you to be Christ's little ones. Convince the
world that since you knew God, and your selves, your pride has been dying from
that day. Show your humility in your habits, 1 Pet. 3. 3. 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10. In
your company, not contemning the meanest and poorest that fear the Lord, Psalm.
15. 4. Romans 12. 16. In your language, that dialect befits your lips, Ephesians. 3. 8.
less than the least of all Saints; but especially in the low value, and humble
thoughts you have of your selves, 1 Timothy 1. 15. And to press this I beseech you
to consider,

First, From how vile a root pride springs. Ignorance of God and of your selves
gives rise and being to this sin: they that know God will be humble, Isa. 6. 5.
and they that know themselves cannot be proud, Romans 7. 9.

Secondly, Consider the mischievous effects it produces: it estrangeth the soul
from God, Psalm. 138. 6. it provokes God to lay you low, Job 40. 11, 12. it goes
before destruction, and a dreadful fall, Prove. 10. 18.

Thirdly, As it is a great sin, so it is a bad sign, Hab. 2. 4. Behold his
heart which is lifted up, is not upright in him.

Fourthly, how unsuitable it is to the sense you have, and the complaints you
make of your own corruptions, and spiritual wants, and above all, how contrary
it is to your pattern, and example; did Christ speak, act, or think as you do?
O learn humility from Jesus Christ; it will make you precious in the eyes of
God, Isa. 57. 15.

Pattern 8.
The Contentation of Christ in a low and mean condition in the world is an
excellent pattern for his peoples imitation. His lot in this world fell upon a
condition of deepest poverty and contempt, yet how well was he satisfied and
contented with it! hear him expressing himself about it, Psalm. 16. 6. The lines
are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. The
contentation of his heart with a suffering condition evidenced it self in his
silence under the greatest sufferings, Isa. 53. 7. He was oppressed and he was
afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he opens not his
mouth. O that in this also the poorest Christians would imitate their Savior,
and learn to manage an afflicted condition with a contented spirit: let there
be no murmurs, complaints or foolish charges of God heard from you, whatever
straits and troubles he bring you into: For

First, The meanest and most afflicted Christian is owner of many rich
invaluable mercies, Ephesians. 1. 3. 1. Cor. 3. ult. Is sin pardoned and God
reconciled? then never open your mouths any more, Ezekiel. 16. 63.

Secondly, You have many precious promises that God will not forsake you in
your straits, Heb. 13. 5. Isa. 41. 17. and your whole life has been a life of
experiences of the faithfulness of God in his promises. Which of you cannot say
with the Church, Lam. 3. 23. His mercies are new every morning, and great is
his faithfulness.

Thirdly, How useful, and beneficial are all your afflictions to you! they
purge your sins, prevent your temptations, wean you from the world, and turn to
your salvation: and how unreasonable then must your discontentedness at them be?

Fourthly, The time of your relief, and full deliverance from all your troubles
is at hand: the time is but short that you shall have any concernment about
these things, 1 Cor. 7. 29. If the candle of your earthly comfort be blown out,
yet remember it is but a little while to the break of day, and then there will
be no need of candles. Besides,

Fifthly, Your lot falls by Divine direction upon you, and as bad as it is, it
is much easier and sweeter than the condition of Christ in this world was. Yet
he was contented, and why cannot you? O that we could learn contentment from
Christ in every condition. And thus I have laid before you some excellent
patterns in the life of Christ, for your Imitation.

The Thirtieth SERMON. Sermon 30.

1 JOHN 2. 6. He that says he abides in him, ought himself also so Text.
to walk, even as he walked.
THese words having been resolved into their parts and the sense opened in the
former Sermon; The observation was this:

DOCT.
That every man is bound to the imitation of Christ, under penalty of
forfeiting his claim to Christ. Doct.


In prosecution of this point we have already shown what the imitation of
Christ imports, and what the imitable excellencies in the life of Christ are:
it now remains that I show you in the next place, why all that profess Christ,
are bound to imitate his example, and then apply the whole. Now the necessity
of this imitation of Christ will convincingly appear diverse ways.

First, From the established order of salvation which is fixed and unalterable:
God that has appointed the end, has also 1.
established the means and order by which men shall attain the ultimate end.
Now Conformity to Christ is the established method in which God will bring
souls to glory. Romans 8. 29. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate,
to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn among
many brethren. The same God who has predestined men to salvation, has in
order thereunto predestined them unto Conformity to Christ, and this order of
heaven is never to be reversed, we may as well hope to be saved without Christ,
as to be saved without Conformity to Christ.

Secondly, The nature of Christ mystical requires this Conformity, 2.
and renders it indispensably necessary. Otherwise, the body of Christ must be
heterogeneous; of a nature different from the head: and how monstrous, and
uncomely would this be? This would represent Christ to the world in an image,
or Idea, much like that, Dan. 2. 32, 33. The head of fine gold, the breast and
arms of silver, the thighs of brass, the legs of iron, the feet part of iron,
part of clay. Christ the head is pure and holy, and therefore very unsuitable
to sensual and earthly members. And therefore the Apostle in his description of
mystical Christ describes the members of Christ (as they ought to be) of the
same nature and quality with the head. 1 Cor. 15. 48. As is the heavenly, such
are they also that are heavenly; and as we have born the image of the earthy,
so we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. That image or resemblance of
Christ which shall be complete and perfect after the Resurrection, must be
begun in its first draught here, by the work of regeneration.

Thirdly, This resemblance and conformity to Christ appears 3.
necessary from the communion which all believers have with Christ in the same
Spirit of grace and holiness. Believers are called Christ's fellows or
copartners, Psalm. 45. 7. from their participation with him of the same spirit,
as it is, 1 These. 4. 8. God gives the same spirit unto us which he more
plentifully poured out upon Christ. Now where the same spirit and principle is,
there the same fruits and operations must be produced, according to the
proportions and measures of the spirit of grace communicated; and this reason
is farther enforced by the very design and end of God in the infusion of the
spirit of grace: for it is plain from Ezekiel. 36. 27. that practical holiness,
and obedience is the scope, and design of that infusion of the spirit. The very
inna^ property of the spirit of God in men is to elevate their minds, and set
their affections upon heavenly things, to purge their hearts from earthly
dross, and fit them for a life of holiness and obedience: its nature also is
assimilating and changes them in whom it is into the same image with Jesus
Christ their heavenly head, 2 Cor. 3. 18.

Fourthly, The necessity of this imitation of Christ may be argued from the
design and end of Christ's exhibition to the 4.
world in a body of flesh. For though we detest that doctrine of the Socinians
which makes the exemplary life of Christ to be upon the matter, the whole end
of his incarnation: yet we must not run so far from an error as to lose a
precious truth. We say the satisfaction of his blood was a main and principal
end of his Incarnation, according to Mat. 20. 28. We affirm also that it was a
great design and end of the Incarnation of Christ to set before us a pattern of
holiness for our imitation. For so speaks the Apostle, 1 Pet. 2. 21. He has
left us an example, that we should follow his steps. And this example of Christ
greatly obliges believers to his imitation. Phil. 2. 5. Let this mind be in you
which also was in Christ Jesus.

Fifthly, our imitation of Christ is one of those great Articles which every
man is to subscribe, whom Christ will admit 5.
into the number of his disciples, Luke 14. 27. Whosoever does not come after
me, cannot be my disciple. And again John 12. 26. If any man serve me, let him
follow me. To this condition we have submitted if we be sincere believers, and
therefore are strictly bound to the imitation of Christ, not only by Gods
command, but by our own consent. But if we profess interest in Christ, when our
hearts never consented to follow and imitate his example; then are we
self-deceiving hypocrites, wholly disagreeing from the scripture character of
believers, Romans 8. 1. They that are Christ's being there described to be such as
walk not after the flesh but after the spirit: and Gal. 5. 25. If we live in
the spirit, let us walk in the spirit.

Sixthly, The honor of Christ necessitates the conformity of Christians to his
example, else what way is there left 6.
to stop detracting mouths, and vindicate the name of Christ from the
reproaches of the world? how can wisdom be justified of her children, except it
be this way? by what means shall we cut off occasion from such as desire
occasion, but by regulating our lives by Christ's example? The world has eyes
to see what we practice, as well as ears to hear what we profess. Therefore
either show the consistency betwixt your profession and practice, or you can
never hope to vindicate the name and honor of the Lord Jesus. The uses follow,
For 1. Information. 2. Exhortation. 3. Consolation.



1. Use for Information. Use 1.

Inference 1.
If all that profess interest in Christ be strictly bound to imitate his holy
example, then it follows that Religion is very unjustly charged Inference 1.
by the world with the scandals, and evils of them that profess it. Nothing can
be more unjust, and irrational if we consider

First, That Christian Religion severely censures loose and scandalous actions
in all professors: and therefore is not to be censured for them. It Is absurd to
condemn Religion, for what it self condemns: Looseness no way flows from the
principles of Christianity, but is most opposite, and contrary to it, Titus 2.
11, 12. For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men:
teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

Secondly, It is an argument of the excellency of Christian Religion, that even
wicked men themselves covet the name, and profession of it, though they only
cloak, and cover their evils under it. I confess it is a great abuse of such an
excellent thing as Religion is, but yet if it had not an awful reverence paid
it by the consciences of all men, it would never be abused to this purpose by
hypocrites, as it is.

Thirdly, According to this reasoning there can be no Religion in the world,
for name me that Religion which is not scandalized by the practices of some
that profess it. So that this practice has a natural tendency to Atheism, and
is no doubt encouraged by the Devil for that end.

Inference 2.
If all mem forfeit their claim to Christ who endeavor not to imitate
Inference 2.
him in the holiness of his life, then how small a number of real Christians
are there in the world? Indeed if liberal talking without accurate walking, if
common profession without holy practices were enough to constitute a Christian:
then this quarter of the world would abound with Christians. But if Christ owns
none for such, but those that tread in the steps of his example, then the
number of real Christians is very small. The generality of men that live under
the Christian name are such as walk after the flesh, Romans 8. 2. according to
the course of this world, they yield their members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin, Romans 6. 13. strict godliness is a mere bondage to
them; narrow is the way, and few there be that walk therein.

Inference 3.
What blessed times should we all see if true Religion did once generally
obtain and prevail in the world! How would it humble Inference 3.
the proud, weaken the passionate, and spiritualize those that are carnal! The
perverse world charges Religion with all the tumults and disturbances that are
in it, whenas nothing in the world but Religion advanced in the power of it can
heal and cure these Epidemical evils. O if men were once brought under the
power of Religion indeed, to walk after Christ in holiness, obedience,
meekness, and self-denial; no such miseries as these would be heard of among
us, Isa. 11. 8, 9. The sucking child shall play upon the hole of the Asp, and a
weaned child shall put his hand on the Cockatrice den, they shall not burt nor
destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

Inference 4.
Hence it also follows, That real Christians are the sweetest companions, It Is
a comfortable thing to walk with them that walk Inference 4.
after the example of Christ. The holiness, heavenliness, humility,
self-denial, and diligence in obedience which was in Christ, is in some measure
to be found in all sincere Christians. They show forth the virtues of him that
calls them. The graces of the spirit do more or less shine forth in them. And
Oh how endearing, sweet and engaging are these things? upon this very account
the Apostle invited others into the fellowship of the saints, 1 John 1. 3. That
ye may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father,
and with his Son Christ Jesus: And is it not sweet to have fellowship with
them, who have fellowship with Christ? O let all your delights be in the
Saints, and in the excellent of the earth who excel in virtue, Psalm. 16. 3. Yet
mistake not, there is a great deal of difference betwixt one Christian and
another, and even the best of Christians are sanctified but in part. If there
be something sweet and engaging, there is also something bitter and distastful
in the best of men. If there be something to draw forth your delight and love,
there is also something to exercise your pity and patience. Yet this is most
certain, that notwithstanding all their infirmities and corruptions, they are
the best and sweetest company this world affords.

Inference 5.
In a word, if no man's claim to Christ be warranted, but theirs that walk as he
walked, How vain and groundless then are the hopes Inference 5.
and expectations of all unsanctified men who walk after their own lusts? None
are more forward to claim the privileges of Religion, than those that reject
the duties of it: multitudes hope to be saved by Christ, who yet refuse to be
governed by him. But such hopes have no scripture warrant to support them. Yea,
they have many scripture testimonies against them, 1 Cor. 6. 9. Know ye not
that the unrighteous shall not inherit the king dom of God? Be not deceived,
neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind. Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the king dom of God. O how many
thousand vain hopes are laid in the dust: and how many thousand souls are
sentenced to hell by this one scripture?

2d. Use for Exhortation.
If this be so, it naturally presses all the professors of Christianity Use 2.
to strict Godliness in their conversations, as ever they expect benefit by
Christ. O professors be ye not conformed unto this world, but be ye transformed
by the renewing of your minds. Set the example of Christ before you, and labor
to tread in his steps. This is the great business of Religion; the main scope
of the Gospel: give me leave therefore closely to press it upon your hearts by
the following Motives.

1. Motive.
Christ has conformed himself to you by his abasing incarnation: Motive 1.
how reasonable therefore is it that you conform your selves to him in the way
of obedience and sanctification? He came as near to you as it was possible for
him to do, strive you therefore to come as near to Christ as it is possible for
you to do. He has taken your nature upon him, Heb. 2. 14. yea, and with your
nature he has taken your weaknesses and infirmities, Romans 8. 3. and not only
your natures, and your infirmities, but your condition also. For he came under
the law for your sakes, Gal. 4. 4. He conformed himself to you, though he was
infinitely above you, that was his abasement; do you conform your selves to
him, who are infinitely beneath him, that will be your advancement: his
conformity to you emptied him of his glory, your conformity to him will fill
you with glory: He conformed himself to you though you had no obligation upon
him: will not you conform your selves to him, who lie under infinite
obligations so to do?

2. Motive.
You shall be Conformed to Christ in glory, how reasonable therefore is it you
should now conform your selves to him in Motive 2.
holiness? The Apostle says, 1 John 3. 2. We shall be like him: for we shall
see him as he is. Yea, not only your souls shall be like him, but your very
bodies, even those vile bodies of yours shall be changed, that they may be
fashioned like unto his glorious body. How ^cible a Motive is this to bring men
into conformity with Christ here! especially seeing our conformity to him in
holiness, is the evidence of our conformity to him in glory, Romans 6. 5. 2 Pet.
3. 11. O professors, as ever you look to be with Christ in glory hereafter, see
that ye walk after Christ's example in holiness and obedience here.

3. Motive.
The Conformity of your lives to Christ your pattern, is Motive 3.
your highest excellency in this world: the measure of your grace is to be
estimated by this rule. The excellency of every creature rises higher and
higher, according as it approaches still nearer and nearer to its original; the
more you resemble Christ in grace, the more illustrious and resplendent will
your conversations be in true spiritual glory.

4. Motive.
So far as you imitate Christ in your lives, and no farther, you will be
beneficial to the world in which you live. So far Motive 4.
as God helps you to follow Christ, you will be helpful to bring others to
Christ, or build them up in Christ: for all men are forbidden by the Gospel to
follow you one step farther than you follow Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 1. and when you
have finished your course in this world, the remembrance of your ways will be
no further sweet to others, than they are ways of holiness and obedience to
Christ, 1 Cor. 4. 17. If you walk according to the course of this world, the
world will not be the better for your walking.

5. Motive.
To walk as Christ walked is a walk only worthy of a Christian: this is to walk
worthy of the Lord, 1 These. 2. 12. Col. 1. Motive 5.
10. by worthiness the Apostle does not mean meritoriousness, but comeliness,
or that decorum which befits a Christian, as when a man walks suitably to his
place and calling in the world, we say he acts like himself. So when you walk
after Dignitatis vocabulum in scripturis, non semper denotat exactam
proportionem aequalitatis rei ad rem, sed quandam convenie^tiam and decentiam
quae tollit repugnantiam, Davenant. in Col. p. 52.
Christ's pattern, you then act like your selves, like men of your character and
profession. This is consonant to your vocation, Ephesians. 4. 1. I beseech you that
you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. This walking suits
with your obligation, 2 Cor. 5. 15. For it is to live unto him who died for us.
This walking only suits with your designation, Ephesians. 2. 10. For you are created
in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained we should walk
in them. In a word, such walking as this, and such only, becomes your
expectation, 2 Pet. 3. 14. wherefore [beloved] seeing that you look for such
things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and
blameless.

6. Motive.
How comfortable will the close of your life be at death, if you have walked
after Christ's pattern and example in this Motive 6.
world! A comfortable death is ordinarily the close of a holy life, Psalm. 37.
37. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is
peace. A loose careless life puts many terrible stings into death. As worms in
the body are bred of the putrefaction there, so the worm of conscience is bred
of the moral putrefaction, or corruption that is in our natures, and
conversations. O then be prevailed with by all these considerations to imitate
Christ in the whole course and compass of your coversations.

3d. Use for Consolation.
Lastly, I would leave a few words of support and comfort to such as sincerely
study and endeavor according to the tendency Use 3.
of their new nature, to follow Christ's example, but being weak in grace, and
meeting with strong temptations, are frequently carried beside the holy
purposes and designs of their honest meaning hearts, to the great grief and
discouragement of their souls. They heartily wish and aim at holiness, and say
with David, Psalm. 119. 5. O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes.
They follow after exactness in holiness as Paul did, Phil. 3. 12. If by any
means they might attain it. But finding how short they come in all things of
the rule and pattern, they mourn as he did, Romans 7. 24. O wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Well, well, if this be
thy case, be not discouraged, but hearken to a few words of support and
comfort, with which I shall close this point.

1. Support.
Such defects in obedience make no flaw in your Justification. For your
Justification is not built upon your obedience, 1. Support.
but upon Christ's, Romans 3. 24. and how incomplete and defective soever you be
in your selves, yet at the same instant, you are complete in him which is the
head of all principality and power, Col. 2. 10. Woe to Abraham, Moses, David,
Paul, and the most eminent Saints that ever lived, if their Justification and
acceptance with God had depended upon the perfection and compleatness of their

The Thirty first SERMON. Sern^

EPHESIANS. 5. 14. Wherefore he says, Awake thou that sleep, and rise from the
dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Text. Of the state of Spiritual Death,
and the misery thereof.

THis Scripture represents unto us the miserable and lamentable state of the
unregenerate, as being under the power of spiritual death, which is the cause
and inlet of all other miseries. From hence therefore I shall make the first
discovery of the woeful and wretched state of them that apply not Jesus Christ
to their own souls.

The scope of the Apostle in this Context, is to press believers to a
circumspect and holy life; to walk as children of light. This exhortation is
laid down in ver. 8. and pressed by diverse arguments in the following verses.

First, from the tendency of holy principles unto holy fruits and practices,
ver. 9, 10.

Secondly, from the convincing efficacy of practical godliness upon the
consciences of the wicked, ver. 11, 12, 13. It awes and convinces their
consciences.

Thirdly, from the co incidence of such a conversation with the great design
and drift of the scriptures: which is to awaken men by regeneration out of that
spiritual sleep, or rather death which sin has cast them into: And this is the
Argument of the Text: Wherefore he says, Awake thou that sleep, etc. There
is some difficulty in the reference of these words. Some think it refers to
Isa. 26. 19. Awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust. Others to Isa. 60. 1.
Arise, shine, for thy light is come, etc. But most probably the words neither
refer to this or that particularly, but to the drift and scope of the whole
Scriptures, which were inspired and written upon this great design to awaken
and quicken souls out of the state of spiritual death. And in them we are to
consider these three things more distinctly and particularly.

1. The miserable state of the unregenerate, they are asleep and dead. 2. Their
duty, which is to awake, and stand up from the dead. 3. The power enabling them
thereunto: Christ shall give thee light.
First, The miserable state of the unregenerate, represented under the Notions
of sleep and death: both expressions intending 1.
one and the same thing, though with some variety of Notion. The Christless and
unregenerate world is in a deep sleep; a spirit of slumber, senselesness and
security is fallen upon them, though they lie exposed immediately to eternal
wrath and misery, ready to drop into hell every moment. Just as a man that is
fast asleep in a house on fire, and whilst the consuming flames are round about
him, his fancy is sporting it self in some pleasant dream, this is a very
lively resemblance of the unregenerate soul. But yet he that sleeps has the
principle of life entire in him though his senses be bound, and the actions of
life suspended by sleep. Lest therefore we should think it is only so with the
unregenerate, the expression is designedly varied, and those that were said to
be asleep, are positively affirmed to be dead; on purpose to inform us that it
is not a simple suspension of the acts and exercise, but a total privation of
the principle of spiritual life which is the misery of the unregenerate.

Secondly, We have here the duty of the unregenerate which is to awake out of
sleep, and arise from the dead. This is their great 2.
concernment: no duty in the world is of greater necessity and importance to
them. Strive (says Christ) to enter in at the strait gate, Luke 13. 24. And
the order of these duties is very natural. First awake, then arise. Startling
and rousing convictions make way for spiritual life: till God awake us by
convictions of our misery, we will never be persuaded to arise, and move
toward Christ, for remedy and safety.

Thirdly, But you will say, if unregenerate men be dead men, to what purpose is
it to persuade them to arise and stand up? 3.
The very exhortation supposes some power or ability in the Quamvis verba
videntur velle primum excitari, and surgere, deinde illuminari: tamen
intelligendum est, vi lucis Christi excitari eum, and surgere. Roll. in Loc.
unregenerate; else in vain are they commanded to arise. This difficulty is
solved in this very Text, though the duty be ours, yet the power is Gods. God
commands that in his word, which only his grace can perform. Christ shall give
thee light. Popish Commentators would build the power of free will upon this
Scripture, by a very weak argument drawn from the order wherein these things
are here expressed: which is but a weak foundation to build upon, for it is
very usual in Scripture to put the effect before, and the cause after, as it is
here, so in Isa. 26. 19. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust. But I will
not here entangle my discourse with that controversy, that which I aim at is
plain in the words, viz.

DOCT.
That all Christless souls are under the power of Spiritual death, Doct.
they are in the state of the dead.

Multitudes of testimonies are given in Scripture to this truth, Ephesians. 2. 1, 5.
You has he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. Col. 2. 13. And you
being dead in your sint, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he
quickened together with him: with many other places of the same importance. But
the method in which I shall discourse this point will be this.

First, I will show you in what sense Christless and unregenerate men are said
to be dead.

Secondly, what the state of spiritual death is.

Thirdly, how it appears that all unregenerate men are in this sad state. And
then apply it.

First, In what sense are Christless and unregenerate men 1.
said to be dead men.

To open this, we must know there is a threefold death, viz.

Death 1. Natural. 2. Spiritual. 3. Eternal.

Natural death is nothing else but the privation of the principle of natural
life, or the separation of the soul from the body, James 2. 26. The body
without the spirit is dead. Spiritual death is the privation of the principle
of spiritual life, or the want and absence of the quickening spirit of God in
the foul: the soul is the life of the body, and Christ is the life of the soul:
the absence of the foul is death to the body, and the absence or want of Christ
is death to the soul. Eternal death is the separation both of body and soul
from God, which is the misery of the damned. Now Christless and unregenerate
men are not dead in the first sense: they are naturally alive, though they are
dead while they live: Nor are they yet dead in the last sense, eternally
separated from God, by an irrevocable sentence as the damned are: but they are
dead in the second sense, they are spiritually dead, whilst they are naturally
alive, and this spiritual death is the forerunner of eternal death. Now
spiritual death is put in scripture in opposition to a twofold spiritual life.

Viz. 1. The life of Justification. 2. The life of Sanctification.

Spiritual death in opposition to the life of Justification is nothing else but
the guilt of sin, bringing us under the sentence of death. Spiritual death in
opposition to the life of sanctification is the pollution or dominion of sin.
In both these fen ses unregenerate men are dead men but: it is the last which I
am properly concerned to speak to in this place, and therefore

Secondly, Let us briefly consider what this spiritual death is, which as
before was hinted is the absence of the quickening 2.
spirit of Christ from the soul of any man. That soul is a dead soul into which
the spirit of Christ is not infused in the work of regeneration, and all its
works are dead works, as they are called, Heb. 9. 14. For look how it is with
the damned, they live, they have sense and motion, and an immortality in all
these, yet because they are eternally separated from God, the life which they
live, deserves not the name of life, but is every where in scripture styled
death: So the unregenerate, they are naturally alive: they eat, and drink, they
buy, and sell, they talk, and laugh, they rejoice in the creatures; and many of
them spend their days in pleasures, and then go down to the grave. This is the
life they live, but yet the scripture rather calls it death than life, because
though they live, yet it is without God in the world, Ephesians. 2. 12. Though they
live, yet it is a life alienated from the life of God, Ephesians. 4. 18. And
therefore while they remain naturally alive, they are in scripture said to
remain in death, 1 John 3. 14. and to be dead while they live; 1 Timothy 5. 6. And
there is great reason why a Christless and unregenerate state should be
represented in scripture under the notion of death, for there is nothing in
nature which more aptly represents that miserable state of the soul than
natural death does. The dead see and discern nothing, and the natural man
perceives not the things that are of God. The dead have no beauty or
desirableness in them, Bury my dead, said Abraham, out of my sight: neither is
there any spiritual loveliness in the unregenerate. True it is some of them
have sweet natural qualities, and moral excellencies which are taking things;
but these are as so many flowers decking and adorning a dead corpse. The dead
are Objects of pity, and great lamentation, men use to mourn for the dead,
Eccles. 12. 5. Man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the
streets. But unregenerate, and Christless souls are much more the Objects of
pity and lamentation. How are all the people of God (especially those that are
naturally related to them) concerned to mourn over them, and for them as
Abraham did for Ishmael, Genesis 17. 18. O that Ishmael might live before thee.
Upon these, and many other accounts the state of unregeneracy is represented to
us in the notion of death.

Thirdly, And that this is the state of all Christless and unsanctified persons
will undeniably appear two ways. 3.


1. The causes of spiritual life have not wrought upon them. 2. The effects and
signs of spiritual life do not appear in them, and therefore they are in the
state, and under the power of spiritual death.
First, The causes of spiritual life have not wrought upon them. There are two
causes of spiritual life.

1. Principal and internal. 2. Subordinate and external.
The principal internal cause of spiritual life is the regenerating spirit of
Christ, Romans 8. 2. The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me
free from the law of sin and death. It Is the spirit as a regenerating spirit
that unites us with Christ in whom all spiritual life originally is, John 5.
25, 26. Verily I say unto you that the hour is coming, and now is when the dead
shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live; for as
the father has life in himself, so has he given to the son to have life in
himself. As all the members of the natural body receive animation, sense, and
motion by their Union with their natural head; so all believers the members of
Christ, receive spiritual life and animation by their Union with Christ their
mystical head, Ephesians. 4. 15, 16. Except we come to him and be united with him in
the way of faith, we can have no life in us, John 5. 40. Ye will not come unto
me that ye may have life. Now the spirit of God has yet exerted no
regenerating, quickening influences, nor begotten any special saving faith in
natural unsanctified men; whatever he has done for them in the way of natural,
or spiritual common gifts, yet he has not quickened them with the life of
Christ. And as for the subordinate external means of life, viz. the preaching
of the Gospel which is the instrument of the spirit in this glorious work, and
is therefore called the word of life, Phil. 2. 16. this word has not yet been
made a regenerating quickening word to their souls. Possibly it has enlightened
them, and convinced them: it has wrought upon their minds in the way of common
illumination, and upon their consciences in the way of conviction; but not upon
their hearts and wills by way of effectual conversion: To this day the Lord
has not given them an heart opening it self in the way of faith to receive
Jesus Christ.

Secondly, The effects, and signs of spiritual life do not appear in them: for

First, They have no feeling or sense of misery and danger. I mean no such
sense as throwly awakens them to apply Christ their remedy. That spiritual
judgment lies upon them, Isa. 6. 9, 10. And he said go and tell this people,
Hear ye indeed but understand not, and see ye indeed, but perceive not, make
the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes.

Secondly, They have no spiritual motions toward Christ, or after things that
are spiritual, all the Arguments in the world cannot persuade their wills to
move one step toward Christ in the way of faith, John 5. 40. Ye will not come
unto me: Were there a principle of spiritual life in their souls, they would
move Christ-ward, and heavenward, John 4. 14. it would be in them a well of
water springing up into eternal life. The natural tendency of the spiritual
life is upward.

Thirdly, The unregenerate have no appetite unto spiritual food, they savor
not things that are spiritual; they can go from week to week, and from year to
year, all their life time without any communion betwixt God and their souls,
and feel no need of it, nor any hungerings, nor thirstings after it, which
could never be i^ a principle of spiritual life were in them, for then they
would esteem the words of Gods mouth more than their necessary food, Job 30. 12.

Fourthly, They have no heat, or spiritual warmth in their affections to God,
and things above, their hearts are as cold as a stone to spiritual Objects.
They are heated indeed by their lusts and affections to the world, and the
things of the world; But O how cold and dead are they toward Jesus Christ and
spiritual excellencies!

Fifthly, They breathe not spiritually, therefore they live not spiritually:
were there a spiritual principle of life in them, their souls would breath
after God in spiritual prayer, Acts 9. 11. Behold he prays. The lips of the
unregenerate may move in prayer, but their hearts and desires do not breath and
pant after God.

Sixthly, They have no cares or fears for self-preservation which is always the
effect of life, the poorest fly or silliest worm will shun danger: the wrath of
God hangs over them in the threatenings, but they tremble not at it: Hell is but
a little before them, they are upon the very precipice of eternal ruin; yet
will use no means to avoid it. How plain therefore is this sad case which I
have undertaken here to demonstrate, viz* that Christless and unregenerate
souls are dead souls? The uses follow.

Inference 1.
If all Christless and unregenerate souls be dead souls, then how Inference 1.
little pleasure can Christians take in the society of the unregenerate?

Certainly it is no pleasure for the living to converse among the dead. It was a
cruel torment invented by Mezentius the Tyrant, to tie a dead and living man
together: The pleasure ^t solent vitia alibi connata in propinqua membra
perniciem Juam efflare; sic improborum vitia in eos derivantur qui cum illis
vitae babent consuetudinem. Tertul. advers. Valentin.
of society arises from the harmony of spirits, and the hopes of mutual
enjoyment in the world to come: neither of which can sweeten the society of the
godly with the wicked in this world. It Is true, there is a necessary civil
converse which we must have with the ungodly here, or else (as the Apostle
speaks) we must go out of the world. There are also duties of relation which
must be faithfully and tenderly paid even to the unregenerate: But certainly
where we have our free election, we shall be much wanting both to our duty and
comfort if we make not the people of God our chosen companions. Excellently to
this purpose speaks a Modern Author, Art thou a godly master? when thou take
a servant into thine house, choose for God, as well as thy self. A godly
Gurnals Christian armor, part. 2. p. 256.
servant is a greater blessing than we think on: he can work and set God on
work also for his masters good, Genesis 24. 12. O Lord God of my master Abraham, I
pray thee send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master: and
sure he did his master as much service by his prayer, as by his prudence in
that journey. Holy David observed while he was at Saul's Court, the mischief of
having wicked and ungodly servants, (for with such was that unhappy King so
compassed, that David compares his Court to the profane and barbarous heathens
among whom there was scarce more wickedness to be found, Psalm. 120. 6. Woe is me
that I sojourn in Mesheck, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar, (i. e.) among
those who were as prodigiously wicked as any there) and no doubt but this made
this gracious man in his banishment before he came to the Crown (having seen
the evil of a disordered house) to resolve what he would do when God should
make him the head of such a Royal family, Psalm. 101. 7. He that works deceit
shall not dwell within my house, he that sells lies shall not tarry in my
sight.

Art thou godly? show thy self so in the choice of husband, or wife. I am sure,
if some, (and those godly also) could bring no other testimonial for their
godliness than the care they have taken in this particular, it might justly be
called into question both by themselves and others. There is no one thing that
gracious persons (even those recorded in scripture as well as others) have
shown their weakness, yea, given offense and scandal more in, than in this
particular. The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair, Genesis 6. 2.
One would have thought the sons of God should have looked for grace in the
heart, rather than beauty in the face, but we see, even they sometimes turn in
at the fairest sign, without much enquiring what grace is to be found dwelling
within. Look to the rule O Christian, if thou will keep the power of holiness.
That is clear as a sun beam written in the scripture, be not unequally yoked
together with unbelievers, 2 Cor. 6. 14.

Inference 2.
How great and wholly supernatural, mavelous and wonderful is Inference 2.
that change which regeneration makes upon the souls of men! It is a change
from death to life, Luke 15. 24. This my son was dead, and is alive again.
Regeneration is life from the dead. The most excellent life from the most
terrible death. It Is the life of God reinspired into a soul alienated from it
by the power of sin, Ephesians. 4. 18. There are two stupendous changes made upon
the souls of men, which justly challenges highest admiration, viz.

That 1. From sin to grace. 2. From grace to glory.

The change from grace to glory is acknowledged by all, and that justly, to be
a wonderful change; for God to take a poor creature out of the society of
sinful men, yea from under the burden of many sinful infirmities which made him
groan from day to day in this world: and in a moment to make him a complete and
perfect soul, shining in the beauties of holiness, and filling him as a vessel
of glory with the unspeakable and unconceivable joys of his presence, to turn
his groanings into triumphs, his sighings into songs of praise; This I say is
mavelous, and yet the former change from sin to grace is no way inferior to
it. Nay, in some respect beyond it: for the change which glory makes upon the
regenerate is but a gradual change, but the change which regeneration makes
upon the ungodly is a spiritual change. Great and admirable is this work of
God, and let it for ever be mavelous in our eyes.

Inference 3.
If unregenerate souls de dead souls, what a fatal stroke does death give to
the bodies of all unregenerate men? A soul dead in sin, and Inference 3.
a body dead by virtue of the curse for sin, and both soul and body remaining
for ever under the power of eternal death, is so full and perfect a misery, as
that nothing can be added to make it more miserable: it is the comfort of a
Christian that he can say when death comes non omnis moriar, I shall not wholly
die; there is a life I live which death cannot touch, Romans 8. 13. The body is
dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. Blessed
and holy is he, that has part in the first Resurrection, on such the second
death has no power. As death takes a believer from amidst many sorrows and
troubles, and brings him to the vision of God, to the general assembly of all
the perfected saints, to a state of complete freedom, and full satisfaction: so
it drags the unregenerate from all his sensitive delights and comforts, to the
place of torments. It buries the dead soul out of the presence of God for ever.
It Is the king of terrors, it is a serpent with a deadly sting to every man that
is out of Christ.

Inference 4.
If every unregenerate soul be a dead soul, how sad is the case of Hypocrites,
Inference 4.
and temporary believers who are twice dead? These are those cursed trees of
which the Apostle Jude speaks, Jude v. 12. Trees whose fruit withers, without
fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. The Apostle alludes unto dying
trees. Trees that are dying the first time in the spring, they then fade,
decay, and cast their leaves, when other trees are fragrant and flourishing.
But from this first death they are sometimes recovered by pruning and dressing,
or watering the roots: But if in Autumn they decay again, which is the Critical
and Climacterical time of trees to discover whether their disease be mortal or
not: if then they wither and decay the second time, the fault is ab intra, the
root is rotten, there is no hope of it. The husbandman bestows no more labor
about it, except it be to root it up for fuel to the fire. Just thus stands
the case with false and hypocritical prosessours, who though they were still
under the power of spiritual death, yet in the beginning of their profession
they seemed to be alive. They showed the world the fragrant leaves of a fair
profession: many hopeful buddings of affection toward spiritual things were
seen in them, but wanting a root of regeneration, they quickly began to wither,
and cast their untimely fruit. However, by the help of ordinances, or some
rouzing and awakening providence they seem to recover themselves again: but
all will not do, the fault is ab intra from the want of a good root, and
therefore at last they who were always once dead, for want of a principle of
regeneration; are now become twice dead, by the withering and decay of their
vain profession. Such trees are prepared for the severest flames in hell, Mat.
24. 51. Their portion is the saddest portion allotted for any of the sons of
death. Therefore the Apostle Peter tells us, 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21. For if after
they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome; the
latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for
them, not to have known the way of righteousness, than after they have known it
to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them. Double measures of wrath
seem to be prepared for them that die this double death.

Inference 5.
If this be so, then unregenerate persons deserve the greatest lamentations.
Inference 5.
And were this truth heartily believed, we could not but mourn over them with
the most tender compassion, and hearty sorrow. If our husbands, wives or
children be dying a natural death, how are our hearts rent in pieces with pity
and sorrow for them? what cries, tears, and wringing of hands discover the deep
sense we have of their misery! O Christians, is all the love you have for your
relations spent upon their bodies? Are their souls of no value in your eyes? is
spiritual death no misery? Does it not deserve a tear? The Lord open our eyes,
and duly affect our hearts with spiritual death and soul miseries.

Consider my friends, and let it move your bowels, (if there be bowels of
affection in you) whilst they remain spiritually dead they are useless and
wholly unserviceable unto God in the world as to any special and acceptable
service unto him, 2 Timothy 2. 21. they are incapable of all spiritual comforts
from God: they cannot taste the least sweetness in Christ, in duties, or in
promises, Romans 8. 6. They have no beauty in their souls; how comely soever
their bodies be, it is grace, and nothing but grace that beautifies the inner
man, Ezekiel. 16. 6, 7. The dead have neither comfort nor beauty in them. They
have no hope to be with God in glory; for the life of glory is begun in grace,
Phil. 1. 6. Their graves must shortly be made, to be buried out of the sight of
God for ever in the lowest hell, the pit dug by justice for all that are
spiritually dead. The dead must be buried. Can such considerations as these
draw no pity from your souls? nor excite your endeavors for their
regeneration? Then it is to be feared your souls are dead as well as theirs. O
pity them, pity them, and pray for them: in this case only, prayers, for the
dead are our duty; who knows but at the last God may hear your cries, and you
may say with comfort as he did, This my son was dead, but is alive; was lost,
but is found; and they began to be merry, Luke 15. 24.

The Thirty second SERMON. Sermon 32.

JOHN 3. 18. Text.
-- But he that believes not is condemned already, The Condemnation of
unbelievers opened and applied.
because he has not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.
CHrist having discoursed Nicodemus in the beginning of this Chapter about the
necessity of regeneration, proceeds to show in this following discourse the
reason and ground why regeneration and faith are so indispensably necessary,
viz. Because there is no other way to set men free from the curse and
condemnation of the Law. The curse of the Law like the fiery serpents in the
wilderness, has smitten every sinner with a deadly stroke and sting, for which
there is no cure, but Christ lifted up in the Gospel, as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, ver. 14. Neither does Christ cure any but those that
believingly apply him to their own souls. The result and conclusion of all you
have in my Text, He that believes in him is not condemned: but he that
believes not is condemned already, etc. In this clause which I have pitched
upon, we find these three parts.

1. The sin threatened, viz. unbelief. 2. The punishment inflicted, viz.
Condemnation. 3. The immediate relation of the one to the other; he is
condemned already.
First, Let us take into consideration the sin which is here threatened, viz.
unbelief. The neglecting or refusing of an 1.
exalted and offered Jesus. Unbelief is twofold, viz. Negative, or Positive.
Negative unbelief is the sin of the heathens, who never had the Gospel among
them, nor the offers of Christ made to them: these cannot believe on him of
whom they have not heard. Positive unbelief is the sin of men and women under
the Gospel, to whom Christ is actually opened and offered by the preaching of
the Gospel, but they make light of it, neglect the great salvation; receive not
Christ into their hearts, nor consent to the severe, and self denying terms
upon which he is offered. This is the sin threatened.

Secondly, The punishment inflicted, and that is condemnation: 2.
a word of deep and dreadful signification, appearing in this Text as the
handwriting upon the plaster of the wall unto Belteshazzar, Dan. 5. 5. A word
whose deep sense and Emphasis is fully understood in hell. Condemnation is the
Judgment or Sentence of God condemning a man to bear the punishment of his
eternal wrath for sin, the most terrible of all sentences.

Thirdly, The immediate relation, or respect this punishment 3.
has to that sin of unbelief. The unbeliever is condemned already (i. e.) he
is virtually condemned by the law of God: His mittimus is already made for
hell, he is condemned as a sinner, by the breach o^ the first Covenant; but
that condemnation had never ^n his ruin, except it had been ratified by the
sentence of God, condemning him as an unbeliever, for slighting and rejecting
the grace offered in the second Covenant. So that the unbeliever is already
virtually condemned by both, as he is a sinner, and as he is an unbeliever, as
he has transgressed the law, and as he has refused the gospel, as he has
contracted sin the mortal disease, and refused Christ the only effectual
remedy. He is virtually condemned now, and will be sententially condemned in
the Judgment of the great day. Unbelief is his great sin, and condemnation is
his great misery. Hence the observation will be this.

DOCT.
That all unbelievers are presently and immediately under the Doct.
just and dreadful sentence of Gods Condemnation. John 12. 48. He that
rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word
that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. John 3. 36. He
that believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.

Three things are to be opened in the Doctrinal part of this point.

1. What unbelief or the not receiving of Jesus Christ is. 2. What condemnation
the punishment of this sin is. 3. Why this punishment unavoidably follows that
sin.
First, What the sin of unbelief or not receiving Christ is. By unbelief we are
not here to understand the relics or remains 1.
of that sin in the people of God which is mixed with their imperfect faith,
for there is some unbelief still mingled with faith in the best hearts. He that
can say Lord I believe, has cause enough to cry out with tears help thou my
unbelief. However, this does not bring the soul under condemnation or into the
state of wrath. The word condemns this unbelief in them, but does not condemn
their persons for this unbelief. But the unbelief here spoken of is the
neglecting or refusing to take Christ upon the terms of the Gospel, and so is
exclusive of the saving act or effects of faith.

First, It is exclusive of the saving act of faith which (as has been already
declared) is the due receiving of Christ offered in the Gospel, consenting to
take him upon his own terms. This the unbeliever will by no means be persuaded
to do. He will be persuaded to accept the promises of Christ, but not to accept
the person of Christ: he is willing to accept Christ in part, a divided Christ,
but not to accept Christ entirely in all his offices. He will accept the
righteousness of Christ, in conjunction with his own righteousness, but he will
not accept the righteousness of Christ as the sole matter of his Justification
exclusive of his own righteousness; he is willing to wear the Crown of Christ,
but cannot be persuaded to bear the cross of Christ. Thus Christ and
unbelievers part upon terms, God will come down no lower, and the unbeliever
will come up no higher. God will not alter his terms, and the unbeliever will
not alter his resolution, and so Christ is refused, Salvation neglected, and in
effect the unbeliever chooses rather to be damned, than to comply with the
severe terms of self-denial, mortification, and bearing the cross of Christ.
Thus it excludes the saving act of faith.

Secondly, It is exclusive of the saving fruits and effects of faith. Faith
produces love to God, but the unbeliever does not truly love him. But I know
you (says Christ to unbelievers) that the love of God is not in you, John 5.
42. Faith purifies the heart of a believer, but the hearts of unbelievers are
full of all impurity. The believer overcomes the world, the world overcomes the
unbeliever: Faith makes the Cross of Christ sweet and easy to the believer,
Unbelief makes Christ because of the Cross bitter and distastful to the
unbeliever. Thus unbelief excludes both the saving act and fruits of faith, and
consequently bars the soul from the saving benefits and privileges of faith,
viz. Justification, and peace with God.

Secondly, Next let us consider the punishment of this sin which is
condemnation. Condemnation in the general is the 2.
sentence of a Judge awarding a mulct, or penalty to be inflicted upon the
guilty person. There is a twofold Condemnation.

1. Respectu culp^, in respect of the fault. 2. Respectu poenae, in respect of
the punishment.
First, Condemnation with respect to the fault is the casting of the person as
guilty of the crime charged upon him. Condemnation with respect to the
punishment is the sentencing of the convicted offender to undergo such a
punishment for such a fault, to bear a penal for a moral evil. This forensick
word Condemnation is here applied unto the case of a guilty sinner cast at the
bar of God, where the fact is clearly proved, and the punishment righteously
awarded. Thou art an unbeliever, for this sin thou shall die eternally.
Condemnation with respect to the fault stands opposed to Justification, Romans 5.
16. Condemnation with respect to the punishment stands opposed to Salvation,
Mar. 16. 16. More particularly,

First, Condemnation is the sentence of God: the great and terrible God, the
omniscient, omnipotent, supreme, and impartial Judge, at whose b^r the guilty
sinner stands. It Is the Law of God that condemns him now. He has one that
judges him, a great and terrible one too. It Is a dreadful thing to be
condemned at man's bar. But the Courts of humane Judicature, how awful and
solemn soever they are, are but trifles, and childrens play to this Court of
heaven and conscience; wherein the unbeliever is arraigned and condemned.

Secondly, It Is the sentence of God adjudging the unbeliever to eternal death:
than which nothing is more terrible. What is a prison to hell? what is a
Scaffold, and an Ax, to go ye cursed into everlasting fire? What is a Gallows
and a Halter to everlasting burnings?

Thirdly, Condemnation is the final sentence of God, the Supreme Judge, from
whose Bar and Judgment there lies no appeal for the unbeliever, but Execution
certainly follows Condemnation, Luke 19. 27. If man condemn, God may justify,
and save: But if God condemn, no man can save or deliver. If the law cast a man
as a sinner, the Gospel may save him as a believer: But if the Gospel cast him
as an unbeliever, a man that finally rejects Jesus Christ whom it offers to
him; all the world cannot save that man. O then what a dreadful word is
Condemnation! All the evils and miseries of this life are nothing to it: put
all afflictions, calamities, sufferings, and miseries of this world into one
scale, and this sentence of God into the other, and they will all be lighter
than a feather.

Thirdly, In the next place, I shall show you that this punishment, viz.
Condemnation, must unavoidably follow that sin of unbelief. So many unbelieving
persons as be in the world, so many condemned persons there are in the world,
and this will appear two ways.

1. By considering what unbelief excludes a man from. 2. By considering what
unbelief includes a man under.
First, Let us consider what unbelief excludes a man from, and it will be found
that it excludes him from all that may help and save him: for

First, it excludes him from the pardon of sin. John 8. 24. If ye believe not
that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. Now he that dies under the guilt of
all his sins must needs die in a state of wrath and condemnation for ever. For
the wages of sin is death, Romans 6. ult. If a man may be saved without a pardon,
then may the unbeliever hope to be saved.

Secondly, Unbelief excludes a man from all the saving benefits that come by
the sacrifice or death of Christ. For if faith be the only instrument that
applies and brings home to the soul the benefits of the blood of Christ, as
unquestionably it is: then unbelief must of necessity exclude a man from all
those benefits, and consequently leave him in the state of death and
condemnation. Faith is the applying cause, the instrument by which we receive
the special saving benefit of the blood of Christ, Romans 5. 25. Whom God has
set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. Ephesians. 2. 8. By grace
are ye saved through faith. So then if the unbeliever be acquitted and saved,
it must be without the benefit of Christ's death and sacrifice, which is utterly
impossible.

Thirdly, Unbelief excludes a man from the saving efficacy and operation of the
Gospel, by shutting up the heart against it, and crossing the main drift and
scope of it, which is to bring up men to the terms of salvation: to persuade
them to believe, this is its great design, the scope of all its commands, 1
John 3. 23. Mark 1. 14, 15. John 12. 36. It Is the scope of all its promises,
they are written to encourage men to believe, Joh. 6. 35, 37. So then, if the
unbeliever escape condemnation, it must be in a way unknown to us by the
Gospel: Yea, contrary to the established order therein. For the unbeliever
obeys not the great command of the Gospel, 1 John 3. 17. Nor is he under any
one saving promise of it, Gal. 3. 14, 22.

Fourthly, Unbelief excludes a man from Union with Christ: faith being the bond
of that Union, Ephesians. 3. 17. The unbeliever therefore may as reasonably expect to
be saved without Christ, as to be saved without faith. Thus you see what
unbelief excludes a man from.

Secondly, Let us next see what guilt and misery unbelief includes men under,
and certainly it will be found to be the greatest guilt and misery in the
world: For

First, It is a sin which reflects the greatest dishonor upon God. 1 John 5.
10. He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself. He that
believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record
which God gave of his Son.

Secondly, Unbelief makes a man guilty of the vilest contempt of Christ and the
whole design of Redemption managed by him. All the glorious attributes of God
were signally manifested in the work of Redemption by Christ, therefore the
Apostle calls him the wisdom of God, and the power of God, 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.
But what does the careless neglect, and wilful rejection of Christ speak, but
the weakness and folly of that design of Redemption by him?

Thirdly, Unbelief includes in it the sorest spiritual judgment that is or can
be inflicted in this world upon the soul of man: Even spiritual blindness, and
the fatal darkening of the understanding by Satan, 2 Cor. 4. 4. of which, more
hereafter.

Fourthly, Unbelief includes a man under the curse, and shuts him up under all
the threatenings that are written in the book of God, amongst which that is an
express and terrible one, Mark 16. 10. He that believes not shall be damned.
So that nothing can be more evident than this, that condemnation necessarily
follows unbelief. This sin and that punishment are fastened together, with
chains of Adamant.

The Uses follow.
Inference 1.
If this be so, then how great a number of persons are visibly Inference 1.
in the state of condemnation! so many unbelievers, so many condemned men and
women. That Is a sad complaint of the prophet, Isa. 53. 1. Who has believed our
report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? Many there be that talk of
faith, and many that profess faith: but they only talk of and profess it: there
are but few in the world unto whom the arm of the Lord has been revealed in
the work of faith with power: it is put among the great mysteries and wonders of
the world, 1 Timothy 3. 16. That Christ is believed on in the world. O what a
great and terrible day will the day of Christ's coming to judgment be, when so
many Millions of unbelievers shall be brought to his Tribunal to be solemnly
sentenced! They are (as my Text speaks) condemned already, but then that
dreadful sentence will be solemnly pronounced by Jesus Christ, whom they have
despised, and rejected: then shall that scripture be fulfilled, Luke 19. 27.
These mine enemies that would not that I should reign over them, bring them
hither, and slay them before me.

Inference 2.
Hence be informed how great a mercy the least measure Inference 2.
of saving faith is, for the least measure of true faith unites the soul to
Jesus Christ, and then, there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus, Romans 8. 1. Not one sentence of God against them. So Acts 13. 39. By him
all that believe are justified from all things. The weakest believer is as free
from condemnation as the strongest, the righteousness of Christ comes upon all
believers without any difference. Romans 3. 22. Even the righteousness of God
which is by faith of Christ Jesus unto all, and upon all them that believe; for
there is no difference. It Is not in imputed as it is in inherent righteousness:
one man has more holiness than another. The faith that receives the
righteousness of Christ may be very different in degrees of strength, but the
received righteousness is equal upon all believers: A piece of gold is as much
worth in the hand of a child, as it is in the hand of a man. O the exceeding
preciousness of saving faith!

Inference 3.
How dreadful a sin is the sin of unbelief, which brings Inference 3.
men under the condemnation of the great God! no sin startles less, or damns
surer: It Is a sin that does not affright the conscience, as some other sins do,
but it kills the soul more certainly than any of those sins could do: for
indeed other sins could not damn us, were it not for unbelief, which fixes the
guilt of them all upon our persons. This is the condemnation. Unbelief is the
sin of sins, and when the spirit comes to convince men of sin, he begins with
this as the capital sin, John 16. 9. But more particularly,

First, Estimate the evil of unbelief from its Object. It is the slighting and
refusing of the most excellent and wonderful person in heaven or earth. The
fiducial vision of Christ is the joy of Saints on earth; the facial vision of
Christ, is the happiness of Saints in heaven. It Is a despising of him who is
altogether lovely in himself, who has loved us and given himself for us. It Is
the rejecting of the only Mediator betwixt God and man, after the rejecting of
whom there remains no sacrifice for sin.

Secondly, Let the evil of unbelief be valued by the offer of Christ to our
souls in the Gospel: it is one part of the great mystery of godliness, that
Christ should be preached to the Gentiles, 1 Timothy 3. 16. That the word of this
salvation should be sent to us, Acts 13. 26. A mercy denied to the fallen
angels, and the greatest part of mankind, which aggravates the evil of this sin
beyond all imagination. So that in refusing or neglecting Jesus Christ is found
vile ingratitude, highest contempt of the grace and wisdom of God, and in the
event, the loss of the only season and opportunity of salvation, which is never
more to be recovered to all eternity.

Inference 4.
If this be the case of all unbelievers, it is not to be admired Inference 4.
that souls under the first convictions of their miserable condition, are
plunged into such deep distresses of Spirit. It Is said of them, Acts 2. 37.
That they were pricked at the heart and cried out, Men and brethren what shall
we do? And so the Jayler, He came in trembling and astonished, and said, Sirs,
what must I do to be saved? Certainly if souls apprehend themselves under the
condemnation and sentence of the great God; all their tears and tremblings,
their weary days and restless nights, are not without just cause and reason.
Those that never saw their own miserable condition by the light of a clear and
full conviction, may wonder to see others so deeply distressed in Spirit. They
may misjudge the case, and call it melancholy or madness: but spiritual
troubles do not exceed the cause and ground of them, let them be as deep and
great as they will: and indeed it is one of the great mysteries of grace and
providence; a thing much unknown to men, how such poor souls are supported from
day to day under such fears and sorrows as are able in a few hours to break the
stoutest Spirit in the world. Luther was a man of great natural courage, and
yet, when God let in spiritual troubles upon his soul, it is noted of him, ut
nec vox, nec calor, nec sanguis superesset, He had neither voice, nor heat, nor
blood appearing in him.

Inference 5.
How groundless and irrational is the mirth and jollity of all carnal and
unregenerate men? they feast in their prison, Inference 5.
and dance in their fetters. O the madness that is in the hearts of men! If men
did but see their mittimus made for hell, or believe they are condemned
already, it were impossible for them to live at that rate of vanity they do:
and is their condition less dangerous because it is not understood? Surely no:
but much more dangerous for that. O poor sinners, you have found out an
effectual way to prevent your present troubles, it were well if you could find
out a way to prevent your eternal misery: but it is easier for a man to stifle
conviction, than prevent damnation. Your mirth has a twofold mischief in it,
it prevents repentance, and increases your future torment. O what an hell will
your hell be, who drop into it out of all the sensitive and sinful pleasures of
this world! If ever a man may say of mirth that it is mad, and of laughter what
does it; he may say so in this case.

Inference 6.
Lastly, what cause have they to rejoice, admire, and praise the Lord to
Eternity, who have a well grounded Inference 6.
confidence that they are freed from Gods condemnation? O give thanks to the
Father who has delivered you from the power of darkness, and translated you
into the Kingdom of his dear Son, Col. 1. 13. Rejoice and be exceeding glad,
for if you be freed from condemnation, you are out of Satan's power, he has no
more any dominion over you. The power of Satan over men comes in by virtue of
their condemnation, as the power of the Jayler or Executioner over the bodies
of condemned prisoners does. Heb. 2. 14. If you be freed from condemnation, the
sting of death shall never touch you. For the sting of death smites the souls
of men with a deadly stroke only by virtue of Gods condemnatory sentence. 1
Cor. 15. 55, 56. The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
If you be freed from condemnation now, you shall stand with comfort and
boldness at the Judgment Seat of Christ in the great day, and verily in this
thing is the love of God perfected, 1 John 4. 17. O it is a privilege in which
the grace, mercy and love of God do ^ine forth as clearly as the sun when it
shines in its full strength. And certainly you will find cause to lie at the
feet of God astonished, and overwhelmed with the sense of this mercy, when you
shall find your selves freed from the condemnation of God, whilst many others
as good as you were, are still under condemnation. Yea, your selves freed, and
many of your Superiors in the world still under the curse, 1 Cor. 1. 26. Yea,
your selves freed, and others that sat under the same means of grace, and had
the same external advantages you had, still in chains, 2 Cor. 2. 16. O
brethren! this is a mavelous deliverance; look on it which way you will, your
ransom is paid and not a penny of it by you: it cost you nothing to procure
your pardon. Your pardon is full, and not one sin excepted out of it that you
ever committed. Your are freed and Jesus Christ condemned in your stead to
procure your discharge, your pardon is sealed in his blood, and is irrevocable
for ever, so that you shall never any more come into condemnation. He that
hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and
shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to life, John 5. 24.

Let them that are so delivered spend their days on earth in praise and
cheerful obedience, and when they die, let them not shrink away from death, nor
be afraid to take it by the cold hand, it can do them no harm. Yea, let them
close their dying lips with

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The Thirty third SERMON. Sermon 33.

JOHN 3. 19. Text.
And this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the Of the Aggravation
of the sin and punishment of unbelief under the light of the Gospel.
world, and men loved darkness rather than light; because their deeds were
evil.
OUt of the foregoing Verse it was fully proved in our last Sermon that all
Christless and unregenerate men are no better than dead men, being Condemned
already. Our Savior proceeds in this Verse to aggravate the misery of those
that refuse and despise him, yet farther, and to let them know that those who
remain in unbelief and the state of unregeneracy must expect some greater and
sorer wrath than other men: not only a simple Condemnation, but an aggravated
and peculiar Condemnation. This is the Condemnation that light is come, etc.

In the words we find these three parts.

1. The aggravation of sin, by the abuse of Gospel light. Light is come, etc.
2. The aggravation of misery in proportion to that abuse of light, this is the
condemnation. 3. The cause and occasion drawing men into this sin and misery,
because their deeds were evil.
First, We have here the aggravation of sin by the abuse of Gospel Light, Light
is come. By Light we are to understand 1.
the knowledge, discovery and manifestation of Christ, and Redemption by him in
the Gospel. He is the Son of righteousness that arises in the Gospel upon the
nations, Mal. 4. 1. When he came in the flesh, then did the dayspring from on
high visit us, Luke 1. 78. And the light may be said to come two ways, either

First, In the means by which it is conveyed to us, or Secondly, in the
efficacy of it upon our minds, when it actually shines into our souls. Light
may come among a people in the means, and yet they actually remain in darkness
all the while. As it is in nature, The sun may be up and a very glorious
morning far advanced, whilst many thousands are drouzing upon their beds with
their curtains drawn about them. Light in the means, we may call potential
Light. Light in the mind we may cali actual light. It* is but seldom that light
comes in the means, and continues long among men, but some light must needs
actually shine into their souls also: but this actual light is twofold, 1.
Common and intellectual only to conviction, or 2. Special and efficacious
light, bringing the foul to Christ, by real conversion.
called in 1 Cor. 4. 6. -- Gods shining into the heart. Where ever light comes
in this last sense, it is impossible that such men should prefer darkness
before it; but it may come in the means, yea, it may actually shine into the
consciences of men by those means and convince them of their sins, and yet men
may hate it, and choose darkness rather than light. And this is the sense of
this place, Light was come in the Gospel dispensation among them, yea, it has
shined into many of their consciences, gauled, and reproved them for sin, but
they hated it, and had rather be without such a troublesome inmate. In a word,
by the coming of light, we are here to understand a more clear and open
manifestation of Christ by the Gospel than ever was made to the world before:
for we are not to think that there was no light in the world till Christ came,
and the Gospel was published in the world by the Apostles ministry. For Abraham
saw Christ's day, John 8. 56. and all the faithful before Christ saw the
promises (i. e.) their accomplishment in Christ afar off, Heb. 11. 13. for it
was with Christ the Son of righteousness as it is with the natural Sun, which
illuminates the hemisphere before it actually rises, or shows its body above
the Horizon: but when it rises and shows it self, the light is much Sol nondu^
conspectus illuminat orbem.
clearer; so it was in this case. The greater therefore was their sin, that
rebelled against it, and preferred darkness to light: this was their sin, with
its fearful aggravation.

Secondly, In a most just proportion to this sin we have 2.
here the aggravated condemnation of them who sinned against such clear
Gospel Light: This is the condemnation, this is the judgment of all
judgments, the greatest and most intolerable judgment: a severer sentence of
condemnation than ever did pass against any others that sinned in the times of
ignorance and darkness: they that live and dye impenitent and unregenerate how
few soever the means of salvation have been which they have enjoyed, must be
condemned: yea, the Pagan world who have no more but natural light to help
them, will be condemned by that light: but this is the condemnation (i. e.)
such sinning as this is the cause of the greatest condemnation, and sorest
punishment, as it is called, Heb. 10. 19.

Thirdly, The cause and occasion drawing men into this sin and misery: because
their deeds were evil, (i. e.) the convincing 3.
light of truth put a great deal of vigor and activity into their Consciences
which they could not endure. The accusations and condemnations of Conscience
are very irksome and troublesome things to men: to avoid this they were willing
to be ignorant. An enlightened Conscience gives an interruption also unto men in
their sinful courses and pleasures: they cannot sin at so easy a rate in the
light as they did in darkness; and this made them hate the light as a very
troublesome thing to them. Thus you see what was the sin, and what the
punishment, and what the cause of both.

DOCT.
That the greater and clearer the light is, under which the impenitent and
unregenerate do live in this world; by so much greater Doct.
and heavier will their condemnation and misery be in the world to come.

Mat. 11. 21, 22. Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida; for is the
mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tire and Sidon, they
would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes: but I say unto you, it
shall be more tolerable for Tire and Sidon at the day of judgment than for
you. Two things require explication, in the doctrinal part of this point.

viz. 1. How light puts a deeper guilt and aggravation into sin. 2. Why sin so
aggravated makes men liable to greater condemnation.

First, We will enquire into the grounds and reasons why greater and clearer
light greatens and aggravates proportionably 2.
the sins that are committed under it: and it will appear that it does so upon
diverse accounts.

First, All light (especially Evangelical-light) is a great preservative from
sin; and an excellent means to prevent it: it is the property of light to inform
the judgment and rectify the mistakes and errors of it, and thereby to give
check to the affections in the pursuit of sinful designs and courses: it is a
plain case, that many men would never do as they do if their understandings
were better informed, 1 Cor. 2. 8. Which none of the Princes of this world
knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:
It was want of light and better information which drew them under that horrid
and unparalled guilt. Our Savior also supposes in the place before cited:
that if Tire and Sidon had enjoyed the same light and means of grace that
Chorazin and Bethsaida did; they would never have been so sinful as they were:
light discovers danger, and thereby overaws and stops men from proceeding
farther in those paths and courses that will run them into it.

Secondly, sinning under and against the light, supposes and involves in it a
greater contempt and despite of Gods authority than sinning in ignorance and
darkness does: every man that breaks the law of God does not in the same degree
despise and slight the authority of the Law maker: but when a man has light to
discover the evil and danger of what he does, and yet will dare to do it; what
is this but the treading of Gods authority under foot? the casting of his word
behind our backs? Wilful sinning is a despightful sinning against God, Heb.
10. 26. it argues a low and vile esteem of the law of God which is reverent and
holy: and by so much the more it makes sin to be exceeding sinful.

Thirdly, Sinning under, and against the light admits not of those excuses and
pleas to extenuate the offense, which sins of pure ignorance do. Those that
live without the sound of the Gospel may say, Lord, we never heard of Christ
and the great redemption wrought by him: if we had, we would never have lived
and acted as we did: and therefore Christ says, Joh. 15. 22. If I had not come
and spoken unto them they had not had sin, but now they have no cloak for their
sin.

The meaning is, that if the Gospel Light had not shined among them, their sin
had not been of that deep guilt that now it is: for now it is so foul and
heinous by reason of the light under, and against which it is committed, that
they have no pretense or excuse to extenuate or mitigate it.

Fourthly, Evangelical light is a very rich favor and mercy of God to men: one
of the choicest gifts bestowed upon the Nations of the world; and therefore
it is said, Psalm. 147. 19, 20. He shows his word unto Jacob, his statutes and
his judgments unto Israel: he has not dealt so with any nation, and as for
his judgments they have not known them Other Nations have Corn and Wine, Gold
and Silver, abundance of earthly delights and pleasures: but they have not a
beam of heavenly light shining upon them. We may account this mercy small, but
God who is best able to value the worth of it, accounts it great, Hos. 8. 12. I
have written unto them the great things of my Law. Christ reckoned Capernaum to
be exalted unto Heaven by the Ministry of the Gospel in that place. Now the
greater the mercy is which the light of truth brings with it, by so much the
more horrid and heinous must the abusing and despising of it be.

Fifthly, Sinning against the light argues a love to sin as sin: to naked sin
without any disguise or covert. It is nothing so bad for a man to sin through a
mistake of judgment; when he thinks that to be lawful which is indeed sinful;
he does not now close with sin as sin: but he either closes with it as his
duty, or at least his liberty. It Is hard for Satan to persuade many men to
embrace a naked sin, and therefore he clothes it in the habit of a duty or
liberty, and thereby deceives and draws men to the commission of it. But if a
man have light shining into his Conscience, and convincing him that the way he
is in is the way of sin quite contrary to the revealed will of God; stripping
the sin naked before the eye of his Conscience, so that he has no covert or
excuse, and yet will persist in it: this, I say, argues a soul to be in love
with sin as sin. Now as for a man to love grace as grace, is a solid argument
to prove the truth of his grace; so on the contrary, for a man to love sin as
sin, does not only argue him to be in the state of sin, but to be in the
forefront, and among the highest rank of sinners.

Sixthly, The greater and clearer the light is, under and against which men
continue in sin, the more must the Consciences of such sinners be supposed to
be wasted and violated by such a way of sinning: for this is a sure rule, that
the Maxima violatio conscienti^ est maximum peccat^m.
greatest violation of Conscience is the greatest sin. Conscience is a noble
and tender part of the soul of man, it is in the soul as the eye in the body,
very sensible of the least injury, and a wound in the Conscience is like a blow
in the eye: but nothing gives a greater blow to Conscience, nothing so much
wastes it and destroys it as sins against the light do: this puts a plain force
upon the Conscience, and gives a dreadful stab to that noble power: Gods
vicegerent in the soul. And thus you see the first thing made good, that light
puts deep guilt and aggravation into sin.

Secondly, In the next place let us examine why sin so aggravated by the light,
makes men liable to the greater condemnation: 2.
for that it does so is beyond all debate or question, else the Apostle Peter
would not have said of those sinners against light as he does, 2 Pet. 2. 21.
That it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness:
nor would Christ have told the Inhabitants of Chorazin or Bethsaida, that it
should be more tolerable for Tire and Sidon in the day of Judgment than for
them. There is a twofold reason of this.

1. Ex part Dei, on Gods part. 2. Ex part Peccatoris, on the Sinners part.
First, Ex part Dei, on Gods part, who is the righteous Judge of the whole
earth, and will therefore render unto every man according as his works shall
be: for shall not the Judge of the whole earth do right? he will judge the
world in righteousness, and righteousness requires that difference be made in
the punishment of Sinners according to the different degrees of their sins. Now
that there are different degrees of sin is abundantly clear from what we have
lately discoursed under the former head: where we have showed that the light
under which men sin, puts extraordinary aggravations upon their sins:
answerable whereunto will the degrees of punishment be awarded by the righteous
Judge of Heaven and earth. The Gentiles who had no other light but that dim
light of nature, will be condemned for disobeying the law of God written upon
their hearts: but yet greater wrath is reserved for them who sin both against
the light of nature, and the light of the Gospel also: and therefore it is
said, Romans 2. 9. Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that does evil,
of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile. Impenitent Jews and Gentiles will
all be condemned at the Bar of God: but with this difference, to the Jew first,
(i. e.) principally and especially because the light and mercy which he abused
and violated were far greater than those bestowed upon the Gentiles, because
unto them were committed the Oracles of God; and God had not dealt with any
Nation as with that Nation. Indeed in the rewards of obedience the same reason
does not hold: he that came into the Vineyard at the last hour of the day may
be equal in reward with him that bare the heat and burden of the whole day,
because the reward is of grace and bounty, not of debt and merit: but it is not
so here, justice observes an exact proportion in distributing punishments
according to the degrees, deserts and measures of sin; and therefore it is said
concerning Babylon, Rev. 18. 7. How much she had glorified her self and lived
deliciously; so much torment and sorrow give her.

Secondly, Ex part Peccatoris, upon the account of sinners it must needs be,
that the heaviest wrath and most intolerable torments should be the portion of
them who have sinned under and against the clearest light and means of grace:
for we find in the Scripture account, that a principal and special part of the
torment of the damned will arise from their own Consciences, Mark 9. 44. Where
their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched: and nothing is more
manifest than this, that if Conscience be the tormentor of the damned, then
sinners against light must needs have the greatest torments. For,

First, The more knowledge any man had in this world, the more was his
Conscience violated and abused here, by sinning against it: and O what work
will these violations and abuses make for a tormenting Conscience in Hell* With
what rage and fury will it then avenge it self upon the most stout, daring and
impudent sinner! the more guilt now, the more rage and fury then.

Secondly, The more knowledge or means of knowledge any man has enjoyed in
this world, so much the more matter is prepared and laid up for Conscience to
upbraid us with in the place of torments: and the upbraidings of Conscience are
a special part of the torments of the damned. O what a peal will Conscience
ring in the ears of such sinners! Did not I warn thee of the issue of such
sins, undone wretch? How often did I strive with thee, if it had been possible
to take thee off from thy course of sinning, and to escape this wrath? Did not
I osten cry out in thy bosom, stop thy course sinner? Hearken to my counsel,
turn and live; but thou would not hearken to my voice. I forewarned thee of
this danger but thou slightedst all my warnings: thy lusts were too strong for
my light: and now thou see whither thy way tended, but alas too late!

Thirdly, The more knowledge or means of knowledge any man has abused and
neglected in this world, so many fair opportunities and great advantages he
has lost for Heaven: and the more opportunities and advantages he has had for
Heaven, the more intolerable will Hell be to that man: as the mercy was great
which was offered by them, so the torment will be unspeakable that will arise
from the loss of them. Sinners, you have now a wide and open door, many blessed
opportunities of salvation under the Gospel, it has put you in a fair way for
everlasting happiness: many of you are not far from the kingdom of God: there
will be time enough in Hell to reflect upon this loss. What think you, will it
not be sad to think there, O how fair was I once for Heaven! to have been with
God and among yonder Saints! My Conscience was once convinced, and my
affections melted under the Gospel. I was almost persuaded to be a Christian
indeed: the bargain was almost made betwixt Christ and my soul: there were but
a few points in difference betwixt us: but wretch that I was, at those points
the bargain stuck, and there the treaty ended to my eternal ruin: I could not
deny my lusts: I could not live under the strict yoke of Christ's government:
but now I must live under the insupportable wrath of the righteous and terrible
God for ever: and this torment will be peculiar to such as perish under the
Gospel. The Heathen who enjoyed no such means, can therefore have no such
reflections, nay, the very Devils themselves who never had such a plank after
their shipwreck, I mean a Mediator in their nature, or such terms of
reconciliation offered them, will not reflect upon their lost opportunities of
recovering as such sinners must, and will: this therefore is the condemnation,
that light is come into the world; but men loved darkness rather than light.

Inference 1.
Hence it follows, that neither knowledge, nor the best means of knowledge are
in themselves sufficient to secure men from wrath Inference* 1.
to come. Light in it self is a choice mercy, and therefore the means that
begat and increased it must be so too: but yet it is a mercy liable to the
greatest abuse, and the abuse of the best mercies brings forth the greatest
miseries. Alas, Christians, your duty is but half learnt when you know it:
obedience to light makes light a blessing indeed, Joh. 13. 17. If ye know these
things, happy are ye if you do them. Happiness is not entailed upon simple
knowing, but upon doing; upon obedience to our knowledge: otherwise he that
increases knowledge does but increase sorrow; for that servant which knew his
Lords will, and prepared not himself, nor did according to his will; shall be
beaten with many stripes, Luke 13. 47. And to him that knows to do good, and
does it not, to him it is sin, Jam. 4. 17. We are bound with all thankfulness
to acknowledge the bounty of Heaven to this sinful generation in furnishing us
with so many excellent means of light beyond many other nations and generations
that are past: but yet we ought to rejoice with trembling when we consider the
abuses of light in this wanton age, and what a dismal event is like to happen
unto many thousands among us. I fear the time is coming when many among us will
wish they had never set foot upon English ground. God has blessed this nation
with many famous, burning and shining lights; it was once said to the honor of
this Nation, that the English Ministry was the worlds Clerus Anglicanus stupor

convincingly, they were once wont to say, we perceive this man has been in
England: the greater will our Pe^cipimus ^c hominem f^isse in Anglia.
account be for abusing such light and rebelling against it: the clearer our
light is now, the thicker will the mists of darkness be hereafter; if we thus
wantonize under it, and rebel against it. The Devils have more light than we,
and therefore the more torment: of them it is said, Jam. 2. 19. The Devils also
believe and tremble: the horror of their Consciences is answerable to their
illumination, they tremble, the word (...), est (...) a^itatio. Eustach.
signifies the rote of the Sea, or such a murmuring dreadful noise, as the
tempestuous Seas use to make when they break themselves against the Rocks.

Inference 2.
If the abuse of light thus aggravates sin and misery, then times of great
temptation are like to be times of deep guilt. Woe to an Inference 2.
enlightened knowing generation when strong temptations befall them. How do many
in such times imprison the known truth to keep themselves out of Prison! offer
violence to their own Consciences, to avoid violence from other hands! Opifice^

Plato was convinced of the unity of God, but durst not own his own
convictions: but said it was a truth neither easy to find nor safe to own. And
even In ^nimi religione non habeat, sed in actibus fi^t.
Seneca, the renowned moralist, was forced by temptation to dissemble his
conviction, of whom Colebat quod reprebendebat, agebat quod arguebat, quod
culpabat, adorabat.
Augustine says he worshipped what himself reprehended; and did what himself
reproved: and even a great Papist of later times was heard to say as he was
going to Mass, eamus ad communem errorem, let us go to the common error. O how
hard is it to keep Conscience pure and peaceable in days of temptation!
doubtless it is a mercy to many weak and timorous Christians to be removed by a
seasonable death out of harms way, to be disbanded by a merciful providence
before the heat of the battle. Christ and Antichrist seem at this day to be
drawing into the field, a fiery trial threatens the professors of this age: but
when it comes to a close grapple indeed, we may justly tremble to think how
many thousands will break their way through the convictions of their own
Consciences to save their flesh. Believe it sirs, if Christ hold you to himself
by no other tie than the slender thread of a single conviction, if he have not
interest in your hearts and affections, as well as in your understandings and
Consciences: if you be men of great light and strong unmortified lusts: if you
profess Christ with your tongues, and worship the world with your hearts: a man
may say of you without the gift of prophecy what the Prophet said of Hazael; I
know what ye will do in the day of temptation.

Inference 3.
If this be so, what a strong engagement lies upon all enlightened Inference 3.
persons to turn heartily to God; and reduce their knowledge into practice and
obedience. The more men know, the more violence they do to their own
Consciences in rebelling against the light; this is to sin with an high hand,
Number. 15. 30. Believe it sirs, you cannot sin at so cheap a rate as others do:
knowledge in a wicked man, like high mettle in a blind Horse, does but the
sooner precipitate him into ruin. You may know much more than others, but if
ever you come to Heaven, it must be in the same way of faith and obedience,
mortification and self-denial in which the weakest Christian comes thither:
whatever knowledge you have, to be sure you have no wisdom, if you expect
salvation upon any other or easier terms, than the most illiterate Christian
finds it. It was a sad observation of the Father, surgunt indocti and rapiunt
coelum: the unlearned rise and take Heaven. What a pity it is that men of such
excellent parts should be enslaved to their lusts! that ever it should be said,
sapientes sapienter descendunt in Gehennam: their learning does but hang in
their light, it does but blind them in spiritual things, and prepares them for
the greater misery.

Inference 4.
Hence it also follows, that the work of conversion is a very difficult work:
the soul is scarcely half won to Christ, when Satan Inference 4.
is cast out of the understanding by illumination. The Devil has deeply
entrenched himself, and strongly fortisied every faculty of the soul against
Christ. The understanding indeed is the first entrance into the soul, and out
of that faculty he is oftentimes expulsed by light and conviction, which seems
to make a great change upon a man. Now he becomes a professor; now he takes up
the duties of Religion, and passes up and down the world for a convert: but
alas, alas, all the while Satan keeps the Fort-royal, the heart and will in his
own possession: and this is a work of more difficulty. The weapons of that
warfare must indeed be mighty through God, which do not only cast down
imaginations, but bring every thought of the heart into captivity to the
obedience of Christ, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. While the heart stands out, though the
understanding be taken in, the soul remains in Satan's possession: it is a
greater work (and we daily find it so) to win one heart, than to convince
twenty understandings.

Inference 5.
Hence also we may learn what strength and power there is in Inference 5.
the lusts of men's hearts, which are able to bear down so strong convictions of
the Conscience before them: that is a great truth, though a very sad one,
Eccles. 8. 11. The heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. O
how common is it every day, and in every place to see men hazarding their souls
to satisfy their lusts! every man, says the Prophet, turns to his course as
the Horse rusheth into the battle: The Horse is a very sierce and warlike
creature, and when his courage is rouzed by the sound of Trumpets and shouts of
Armies, he breaks headlong into the ranks of armed men, though death be before
him. Such boisterous and headlong lusts are found in many enlightened persons:
though their Consciences represent damnation before them, onward they will
rush, though God be lost, and a precious soul undone for ever.

Inference 6.
To Conclude, As ever you will avoid the deepest guilt, and Inference 6.
escape the heaviest condemnation, open your hearts to obey and practice
whatsoever God has opened your understandings and Consciences to receive of
his revealed will: obey the light of the Gospel while you have opportunity to
enjoy it: this was the great counsel given by Christ, John 12. 35, 36. Yet a
little while the light is with you, walk whilst you have the light, lest
darkness come upon you. The manifestation of Christ in the Gospel is the light
of the world: all the nations of the earth that want this light are benighted:
and those upon whom this light is risen have but a short time under it; yet a
little while the light is with you, and whatever patience God may exercise
toward poor ignorant souls, yet commonly he makes short work with the
despisers of this light: the light of the Gospel is a shining Lamp, fed with
Golden-oyl. God will not be at the expense of such light for them that do but
trifle with it. The night is coming when no man can work: There are many sad
signs upon us of a setting Sun: a night of darkness approaching: many burning
and shining lights are extinguished, and many put under a Bushel: your work is
great; your time short; this is the only space you have for repentance, Rev. 2.
21. If this opportunity of salvation be lost, it will never come again, Ezeck.
24. 13. How pathetical was that lamentation which Christ made over Jerusalem,
Luke 19. 41, 42. And when he was come near he beheld the City, and wept over
it; saying If thou had known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes. Christ is
threatening these nations with the removal of his Gospel-presence: he has found
but cold entertainment among us. England has been unkind to Christ: many
thousands there are that rebel against the light; that say unto God Depart from
us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. Christ will not tarry where he is
not welcome; who would, that has any whither else to go? Obey the light
therefore, lest God put it out in obscure darkness.

The Thirty fourth SERMON. Sermon 34.

2 COR. 4. 3, 4. Text*
But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are The blinding policies of
Satan opened as the cause of unbelief, and forerunner of destruction.
lost; in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which
believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image
of God, should shine unto them.
THe aversations of men from Jesus Christ their only remedy, is as much to be
admired, as lamented: one would think the news of deliverance should make the
hearts of captives leap for joy: the tidings of a Savior should transport the
heart of a lost sinner. A man would think a little Rhetoric might suffice to
persuade the naked soul of a sinner to put on the rich robes of Christ's
righteousness, which cost him nothing but acceptance: or the perishing starving
sinner to accept the bread of God which comes down from Heaven, and gives
life unto the world. This is the great design I have managed in this whole
discourse; the center to which all these lines are drawn: many arguments have
been used; and many ways attempted to prevail with men to apply and put on
Christ, and I am afraid all too little. I have but labored in vain, and spent
my strength for naught; all these discourses are but the beating of the air,
and few if any will be persuaded to come unto Christ, who is clearly opened,
and freely offered in the Gospel to them. For alas, whilst I am reasoning,
Satan is blinding their minds with false reasonings and contrary persuasions:
the God of this world turns away the ears, and draws away the hearts of almost
the whole world from Christ: the God of this world has blinded the minds of
them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ who is
the image of God, should shine unto them. Satan is a great and jealous Prince;
and is well aware that so many of his subjects as shall be brought to see the
misery of their condition, will never endure to abide any longer in subjection
to him: it is therefore his great policy to put out their eyes, that he may
secure their souls; to darken their understandings, that he may keep his
interest firm and entire in their wills and affections: and this makes the
effectual application of Christ so great a difficulty: that upon the contrary,
it is just matter of admiration that any soul is persuaded and prevailed with
to quit the service of Satan, and come to Christ. And therefore in the last
place, to discover the great difficulty of conversion, and show you where it is
that all our endeavors stick and set, so that we can move the design no
farther, with all our tugging and striving, reasoning and persuading; as also
to mourn over and bewail the misery of Christless and unregenerate souls, with
whom we must part upon the saddest terms; I have chosen this Scripture, which
is of a most awakening nature; if happily the Lord at last may persuade any soul
to come over to Christ thereby.

These words come into the Apostles discourse, by way of prolepsis: he had been
speaking in the former Chapter of the transcendent excellency of the Gospel
above the Law: and among other respects he prefers it to the Law in point of
clearness. The Law was an obscure and cloudy dispensation, there was a veil
upon the face of Moses, and the hearts of the people, that they could not see
to the end of that which is abolished: but under the Gospel we all with open
face behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord. Against this discourse the
Apostle foresaw and obviated this objection. If your Gospel be so clear, what
is the reason that many who live under the ministration of it (and they none of
the meanest neither, for wisdom and understanding) do yet see no glory nor
excellency in it? To this he returns in the words I have read; if our Gospel be
hid, it is hid to them that are lost, whose eyes the god of this world has
blinded, etc. q. d. It Is true, multitudes there are who see no glory in Christ
or the gospel, but the fault is not in either; but in the minds of them that
believe not. The Sun shines forth in its glory, but the blind see no glory in
it: the fault is not in the Sun but in the eye. In the words themselves we have
three parts to consider.

1. A dreadful Spiritual Judgment inflicted. 2. The wicked instrument by whom
it is inflicted. 3. The politic manner in which he does it.
First, We have here a very dreadful Spiritual Judgment inflicted upon the
souls of men, viz. the hiding of the Gospel 1.
from them: if our Gospel be hid. For these words (...) are a concession, that
so it is; a very sad, but undeniable truth. Many there are that see no beauty
in Christ, nor necessity of him; though both are so plainly and evidently
revealed in our Gospel: if our Gospel be hid: it is called our Gospel; not as if
Paul and the other Preachers of it were the Authors and Inventers of it; but
our Gospel, because we are the Preachers and Dispensers of it. We are put in
trust with the Gospel, and though we Preach it in the demonstration of the
Spirit and of power, using all plainness of speech, to make men understand it:
yet it is hid from many under our ministry: it is hid from their understandings,
they see no glory in it; and hid from their hearts, they feel no power in it.
Our Gospel notwithstanding all our endeavors is a hidden Gospel unto some:
this is the sorest and most dreadful Judgment.

Secondly, We have here an account of that wicked Instrument 2.
by whom this judgment is inflicted, viz. Satan: called here (by a Mimesis)
the god of this world: not simply and properly, but because he challenges to
himself the honor of a God: rules over a vast Empire, and has multitudes of
souls, even the far greater part of the world in subjection and blind obedience
to his government.

Thirdly, Here also we have an account of the politic manner of his
government, how he maintains his dominion 3.
among men, and keeps the world in quiet subjection to him: namely, by blinding
the minds of all them that believe not: putting out the eyes of all his
subjects, darkning that noble faculty, the mind or understanding: the thinking,
considering and reasoning power of the soul which the Philosophers truly call
(...), the leading and directing faculty: for it is to the soul what eyes are
to the body, and it is therefore called the eyes of the understanding, Ephesians. 1.
18. These eyes Satan blinds, (i. e.) he darkens the mind and understanding with
ignorance and error; so that when men come to see and consider spiritual
things, they see indeed, but perceive not, Isa. 6. 9, 10. They have some
general confused notions, but no distinct, powerful and effectual apprehensions
of those things: and this is the way indeed, none like it, to bar men
effectually from Jesus Christ, and hinder the application of the benefits of
redemption to their souls. It Is true, the righteous God permits all this to be
done by Satan upon the souls of men; but wheresoever he finally prevails thus
to blind them, it is as the Text speaks, (...), in them that are lost, or
appointed of God unto perdition. The elect of God are all blinded for a time,
but Christ applies unto them his Eye salve: effectually opens the eyes of
their understandings, and recovers them thereby out of Satan's power and
dominion: but as for those who still continue thus blinded, the Symptoms and
Characters of eternal death appear upon their souls; they are a company of lost
men.

DOCT.
That the understandings of all unbelievers are blinded by Satan's policies, in
order to their everlasting perdition.

Four things must be opened in the Doctrinal part of this point.

First, what the blinding of the understanding or hiding of the Gospel from the
understanding is.

Secondly, I shall demonstrate that the understandings of many are thus
blinded, and the Gospel hidden from them.

Thirdly, I shall show what policies Satan uses to blind the minds of men.

Fourthly, That this blindness is the sorest judgment, and in order to men's
everlasting perdition.

Fifthly, And then apply the whole.

First, we shall enquire what the blinding of the mind, or hiding 1.
of the Gospel from it is. Two sorts of men are thus blinded in the world.

1. Those that want the means of illumination. 2. Those that have the means,
but are denied the blessing and efficacy of them.
The former is the case of the Pagan world, who are in midnight darkness, for
want of the Gospel. The later is the case of the Christian world. The greatest
part of them that live within the sound of the Gospel, being blinded by the God
of this world, Isa. 6. 9, 10. And he said Go, and tell this people; hear ye
indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not: make the heart
of this people fat, and make their ears heavy; and shut their eyes, lest they
see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
and convert and be healed. Thus when the Son of righteousness actually rose in
the world it is said, John 1. 5. The light shined in darkness, but the darkness
comprehended it not. So we may say of all that light which is in the
understanding of all unbelievers what Job speaks of the grave, Job 10. 22. That
the light there is as darkness. But more particularly to open the nature of
this Spiritual blindness, I will show you,

1. What it is not opposed unto. 2. What it is opposed unto.
First, Let us examine what Spiritual blindness or the hiding of the Gospel
from the minds of men is not opposed unto, and we shall find,

First, That it is not opposed unto natural wisdom, a man may be of an acute
and clear understanding; Eagle-eyed to discern the mysteries of nature, and yet
the Gospel may be hidden from him. Who were more sagacious and quick-sighted in
natural things, than the heathen Philosophers, renowned for wisdom in their
generation: Yet unto them the Gospel was but foolishness, 1 Cor. 1. 20, 21. S.
Augustine confesses that before his conversion, he was filled with offense and
contempt of the simplicity of the Gospel. Dedignabar esse parvulus, says he: I
scorned to become a child again. And that great Bradwardine, the profound
Doctor, who was learned usque ad stuporem, even to a wonder; professed that
when he first read Paul's Epistles, he despised them, because he found not in
them Metaphysicum ingenium, those Metaphysical Notions which he expected. Upon
this account it was that Christ brake forth into that Pathetical gratulation of
his fathers love to the elect, Mat. 11. 25. At that time Jesus answered, and
said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth; because thou have hid
these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes.

Secondly, It is not opposed to all light and knowledge in Spiritual truths. A
man may have a true understanding of the Scriptures, give an Orthodox
exposition of them, and enlighten the minds of others by them: and yet the
Gospel may be hidden from himself, Mat. 7. 22. Many will say unto me in that
day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy Name? So Romans 2. 19. Aid art
confident that thou thy self art a guide of the blind, a light to them that sit
in darkness, etc. A man may show others the way to Christ and Salvation, whilst
both are hid from himself.

Thirdly, It is not opposed to all kind of influences upon the affections, for
it is possible the Gospel may touch the affections themselves, and cause some
sweet Motions and Raptures in them; and yet be an hidden Gospel to the soul,
Heb. 6. 5, 9.

Secondly, But if these three things may consist with spiritual blindness, unto
what then is it opposed? To which I answer, that Spiritual blindness stands
only opposed unto that saving Manifestation of Jesus Christ in the Gospel, by
the Spirit, whereby the soul is regenerated, and effectually changed by a real
conversion unto God: Wherever the Gospel thus comes in the demonstration of
the Spirit, and of power; producing such an effect as this in the soul; it is
no longer an hidden Gospel to that soul, though such persons do not see clearly
all that glory which is revealed by the Gospel: though they know but in part,
and see darkly as through a glass; yet the eyes of their understandings are
opened, and the things which belong to their peace are not hidden from them.

Secondly, But though this be the happiness of some men, 2.
yet it is demonstrable, that the eyes of many are blinded by the God of this
world, and the Gospel is an hidden Gospel from them: for,

First, Many that live under the Gospel are so entirely swallowed up in the
affairs of this world, that they allow themselves no time to ponder the great
concernments of their souls in the world to come, and judge you, whatever the
gifts and knowledge of these men are, whether the God of this world has not
blinded their eyes. If it were not so, it were impossible that ever they should
thus wast the most precious opportunities of salvation, upon which their
everlasting well-being depends, and spend time at the door of eternity about
trifles which so little concern them. Yet this is the case of the greatest
number that go under the Christian name. The earth has opened her mouth, and
swallowed up their time, thoughts, studies, and strength as it did the bodies
of Corah, and his accomplices. The first, the freest, and upon the matter the
whole of their time is devoted to the service of the world: for even at that
very time when they present their bodies before the Lord in the duties of his
worship, their hearts are wandering after vanities, and going after their
covetousness, Ezekiel. 33. 31. Judge whether the God of this world has blinded
these men or no, who can see so much beauty in the world, but none in Christ,
and put such an absolute necessity upon the vanities of this world, but none
upon their own salvation. If this be not spiritual blindness, what is?

Secondly, The great stilness and quietness of men's consciences under the most
rouzing and awakening truths of the Gospel, plainly proves that the God of this
world has blinded their eyes. For did men see and apprehend the dangerous
condition they are in, as the word represents it; nothing in the world could
quiet them but Christ. As soon as men's eyes come to be opened, the next enquiry
they make is, What shall we do to be saved? It is not possible that a man
should hang over hell, see Christ and the hopes of salvation going, and the day
of patience ending, and yet be quiet. O it cannot be, that conscience should
let them be quiet in such a case, if it were not blinded and stupefied; but
whilst the God of this world that strong man armed keeps the house, all his
goods are in peace, Luke 11. 21. If once your eyes were opened by conviction, a
man may then say, Be quiet if you can; sit still, and let the hopes and seasons
of salvation pass quietly away if you can. Suppose one should come into the
Congregation, and whisper but such a word as this in your ear, your child is
fallen into the fire, and is dying, since you came from home; would it be in
the power of all the friends you have, to quiet you, and make you sit still
after such an information? much less, when a man apprehends his own soul in
immediate danger of the everlasting burnings.

Thirdly, The strong confidences and presumptuous hopes men have of salvation,
whilst they remain in the state of nature and unregeneracy, plainly shows their
minds to be blinded by the policy of Satan. This presumption is one of those
(...), false reasonings by which Satan deludes the understanding, as the
Apostle calls them, Jam. 1. 22. It Is the cunning Sophistry of the Devil,
farthered by self-love, Prove. 21. 2. Every way of a man is right in his own
eyes, and partly by self-ignorance, Rev. 3. 17. Thou said I am rich and have
need of nothing, and know not that thou art poor. You have no fears, no
doubts, no case to propound that concerns your future state, and why so? but
because you have no sight, your consciences are quieted because your eyes are
blinded.

Fourthly, The trifling of men with the duties of Religion plainly discovers
the blinding power of Satan upon their minds and understandings, else they
would never play and dally with the serious and solemn ordinances of God, at
that rate they do; if their eyes were once opened they would be in earnest in
prayer, and apply themselves with the closest attention of mind in hearing the
Gospel. There are two sorts of thoughts about any subject of meditation. Some
think at a distance, and others think close to the subject. Never do the
thoughts of men come so close to Christ, to heaven and to hell, as they do
immediately upon their illumination. When John's Ministry enlightened the peoples
minds, it is said, Mat. 11. 12. From the days of John the Baptist until now,
the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
Surely these men were more in good earnest that would receive no repulse, take
no denial; but even force themselves through all difficulties into heaven, and
so would it be with you. If the God of this world had not blinded your minds,
you would never pray with so much unconcernedness, nor hear with so much
oscitancy and carelessness; pray as if you prayed not, and hear as if you heard
not. It is with many of our hearers as it was with Aristotle, who after a
quaint Oration made before him, was asked how he liked it: Truly said he, I did
not hear it; for I was thinking all the while of another matter.

Fifthly, This also is a plain evidence that the God of this world has blinded
many men's eyes among us, for that they fear not to commit great sins, to avoid
small hazards and troubles, which all the world could never persuade them to
do, if they were not hoodwinked by the God of this world. Those that have seen
sin as sin in the glass of Gods Law, will choose as Moses did, to suffer any
affliction with the people of God, rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin which
are but for a season, Heb. 11. 25. Those that have seen and felt the evil of
sin in the deep troubles* of their spirits sor it, will account all reproaches,
all losses, all sufferings from men, to be but flea-bitings to the burden of
sin.

Sixthly, The pride and self-conceitedness of many thousands who profess
Christianity, plainly shows their minds to be blinded, by the Sophistry of
Satan, and that they do not understand themselves, and the woeful state of their
own souls. Those that see God in the clearest light, abhor themselves in the
deepest humility, Isa. 6. 5. Job 42. 5. If ever the Lord had effectually opened
your eyes by a clear discovery of your state by nature, and the course of your
life under the efficacy and influence of continual temptations and corruptions;
how would your plumes fall? None in the world would rate you lower, than your
selves would. By all which it appears, that multitudes are blinded by the God
of this world:

Thirdly, In the third place, we are to consider what policies Satan uses to
blind the minds of them that believe not, 3.
and we shall find there are three sorts of policies practiced by the God of
this world upon the minds and understandings of men, which he darkens,

By 1. Hindering the reception of Gospel Light. 2. Obstructing the efficacy of
it when received. 3. Making mis-applications of it to other purposes.

First, It is a great policy of Satan to blind the understandings of men by
hindering and preventing the reception of Gospel light, which he does
especially these five ways.

First, By tempting the dispensers of the Gospel to darken the truths thereof
in their delivering of them, to shoot over the heads of their hearers, in lofty
language and terms of art, so that common understandings can give no account
when the Sermon is done, what the preacher would have, but however commend him
for a good Scholar, and an excellent Orator. I make no doubt but the Devil is
very busy with Ministers in their Studies, tempting them by the pride of their
own hearts to gratify his design herein, he teaches them how to paint the
glass, that he may keep out the light.

I acknowledge a proper, grave and comely style befits the lips of Christ's
Ambassadors, they should not be rude and careless in their language or method.
But this affectation of great swelling words of vanity is but too like the
proud Gnostics, whom the Apostle is supposed to tax for this evil, Jude v. 16.
This is to darken counsel, by words without knowledge, Job 31. 2. To amuse and
bemist poor ignorant souls; and nullify the design of preaching: for every
thing is accounted so far good, as it is good to the end it is ordained for. A
sword that has an hilt of Gold, set thick with Diamonds, is no good sword if
it have no edge to cut, or want a good back to follow home the stroke. O that
the Ministers of Christ would choose rather sound than great words, such as are
apt to pierce the heart, Qui populariter, pueriliter, trivialiter, and
simplicissime docent, optimi ad vulgus sunt concionatores. Bucholtz.
rather than such as tickle the fancy, and let people beware of furthering the
design of Satan against their own souls, in putting a temptation upon their
Ministers, by despising plain preaching. The more popular, plain, and
intelligible our discourses are, so much the more probable they are to be
successful; that is the most excellent Oratory that persuades men to Christ.

Secondly, Satan hinders the access of light to the understandings of men, by
employing their minds about impertinent things; while they are attending upon
the Ordinances of God. Thus he tempted them in Ezekiel. 33. 31, 32. And they come
unto thee as thy people comes, and they sit before thee as my people; and they
hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much
love, but their heart goes after their covetousness. And lo thou art unto them
as a very lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice. The modulation of the
Prophets voice was very pleasing to their ears, but mean while their fancies
and thoughts were wandering after their lusts, their hearts were full of earthly
projects.

Thirdly, Satan hinders the access of light to the understandings of men by
raising Objections, and picking quarrels with the word on purpose to shake its
authority, and hinder the assent of the understanding to it, and so the word
makes no more impression, than a fable or Romance would do. And never did this
design of Satan obtain more than in this Atheistical age, wherein the main
pillars and foundation of Religion are shaken in the minds of multitudes. The
Devil has persuaded many that the Gospel is but a cunningly devised fable.
Fabula Christi, as that blaspheming Pope called it: That Ministers must say
somewhat to get a living. That heaven and hell are but fancies, or at most
things of great uncertainty and doubtsul credit. This being once obtained, the
door of the soul is shut against truth. And this design of Satan has prospered
the more in this generation, by the corrupt doctrines of seducing spirits,
which have overthrown the faith of some, 2 Timothy 2. 18. And partly from the
scandalous lives of loose and vain professors, the Gospel has been brought
into contempt; but especially by Satan's artificial improvement of the corrupt
natures of men, in an age wherein conscience has been so much debauched, and
Atheism thereby spread as a gangreen in the body politic.

Fourthly, Satan hinders the access of light by helping erroneous minds to draw
false conclusions, and perverse inferences from the great and precious truths
of the Gospel; and thereby bringing them under prejudice and contempt: thus he
assists the errors of men's minds about the doctrine of Election; when he either
persuades them that it is an unreasonable doctrine, and not worthy of credit,
that God should choose some, and refuse others every way as good as those he
has chosen: or if there be any certainty in that doctrine, then men may throw
the reins upon the neck of their lusts, and live at what rate they list. For if
God have chosen them to salvation, their wickedness shall not hinder it; and if
he have appointed them unto wrath, their diligence and self-denial cannot
prevent it.

Thus the Doctrine of free grace is by the like Sophistry of Satan turned into
lasciviousness. If grace abound, men may sin the more freely; and the shortness
of our time upon earth which in its own nature awakens all men to diligence, is
by the subtilty of Satan turned to a quite contrary purpose, Let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we shall die.

Fifthly, Satan darkens the minds of men, and shuts them against the light; by
blowing them up with pride and self-conceitedness, persuading them that they
know all these things already: and causing them to contemn the most weighty and
precious truths of God, as trite and vulgar notions. The word cannot be
received without meekness, and humility of mind, Jam. 1. 21. Psalm. 25. 8, 9.
and pride is the nurse of ignorance, 1 Timothy 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 7. The Devil is
aware of this, and therefore blows up the pride and conceitedness of men's
hearts all that he can: and this temptation of his generally prevails wherever
it meets with a knowing head, matched with a graceless and unsanctified heart.
And thus we see by what wiles and policies Satan keeps out the light, and
prevents the access of it to the minds of men.

But if he miss his design here, and truth gets into the mind, Then

Secondly, he labors to obstruct the efficacy and operation of the light, that
though it do shine into the understanding, yet it shall be imprisoned there;
and send down no converting influences upon the will and affections: and this
design he promotes and manages diverse ways.

First, By hastening to quench convictions betime, and nip them in the bud.
Satan knows how dangerous a thing it is, and destructive to his interest, to
suffer convictions to continue long; and therefore it is said of him, Mat. 13.
19. When any one hears the word of the Kingdom, and understands it not,
then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart.
Satan is compared in this Scripture to the fowls of the air, which pick up the
seed before it take any root in the earth. The Devil is very jealous of this,
and therefore labors all he can to destroy the word before it comes to operate
upon the heart, which he does sometimes by the cares of the world, and
sometimes by vain companions who prove mere quench coals unto beginning
convictions. One sinner destroys much good.

Secondly, No sooner does the God of this world observe the light of truth
begin to operate upon the heart, but he obstructeth that design by
procrastinations and delays, which delude and baffle the convinced soul; he
persuades them if they will alter their course, it will be time enough
hereafter, when such encumbrances, and troubles in the world are over; is he
prevail here, it is a thousand to one but the work miscarries, James 1. 23, 24.
if the hearer of the word be not a doer (i. e.) a pre^ent doer while the
impressions of it are fresh upon the soul, he does but deceive himself. For it
is with the heart as it is with melted wax, if the seal be clapped to it
presently, it will receive a fair impression; but if it be let alone but for a
little while, you can make none at all; it was therefore David's great care and
wisdom to set about the work of Religion under the first impetus or vigorous
motion of his heart and affections, Psalm. 119. 60. I made haste, and delayed
not to keep thy commandments. Multitudes of souls have perished by these
delays. It Is a temptation incident to all that are under beginning convictions,
especially young persons, whom the Devil persuades that it were no better than
madness in them to abridge and deny themselves so much delight and pleasure,
and steep their youthful thoughts in such a melancholy subject as Religion is.

Thirdly, If all this will not do, but convictions still continue and get
ground in the conscience, then he endeavors to scare, and fright them out of
their convictions, by representing to them the inward terrors, troubles and
despairs into which they are about to plunge themselves, and that henceforth
they must never expect a pleasant day or comfortable hour. Thus does the God of
this world blind the minds of them that believe not, both by hindering the
access of light to the mind, and the influence of it upon the heart.

Thirdly, There is yet one policy of Satan to keep souls in 3.
darkness, and that is by the mis-application of truth; persuading them that
whatsoever they read or hear of the misery and danger of Christless and
unregenerate persons, does not in the least touch or concern them, but the more
notorious and profane part of the world; and by this policy he blinds the
minds of all civil and moral persons. Thus the Pharisees trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others. And so the Laodiceans thought
themselves rich, and increased with See my Touchs^one of sincerity, upon Rev.
3. 17, 18.
goods; that is, in a very safe and good condition. Now there are diverse
things notably improved by Satan's policy, in order to these misapplications of
truth: as

First, The freedom of their lives from the most gross pollutions of the world.
Mat. 19. 20. All these things have I kept from my youth up: A civil, sober
course of life is a most effectual blind before the eyes of many a man's
conscience.

Secondly, It is the policy of Satan to prevent conviction, by conviction. I
mean effectual convictions, by convictions that have been ineffectual, and are
now vanished away. Thus the troubles that some persons have been under, must
pass for their conversion, though the temper of their heart be the same it was:
their ineffectual troubles are made use of by the Devil to blind them in the
true knowledge and apprehension of their condition. For these men and women can
speak of the troubles they have had for sin, and the many tears they have shed
for it; whereby thorough conviction is effectually prevented.

Thirdly, Gifts and knowledge are improved by the policy of Satan against the
true knowledge of Jesus Christ, and our own estate by nature. As conviction is
improved by Satan's policy against conviction, so is knowledge, against
knowledge. This was the case of them in Romans 2. 17, 18. Thou art called a Jew,
and restest in the law, and make thy boast of God, and know his will, and
approvest the things that are excellent; being instructed out of the law, and
art confident that thou thy self art a guide to the blind, etc. And this is the
temptation and delusion of knowing persons, who are so far from being blind in
their own account, that they account themselves the guides of the blind: yet
who blinder than such men?

Fourthly, External reformation is improved by the policy of Satan against true
Spiritual reformation, and passes current up and down the world. For
conversion, though it serves only to strengthen Satan's interest in the soul,
Mat. 12. 44. and for want of a real change of heart does but increase their sin
and misery, 2 Pet. 2. 20. This is the generation that is pure in their own
eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness. The cleanness of their
hands blinds them in discovering the foulness of their hearts.

Fifthly, The policy of Satan improves diligence in some duties, against the
convictions of other duties. The external duties of Religion, as hearing,
praying, fasting, against the great duties of repenting and believing. This was
their case, Isa 58. 2, 3. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways,
as a nation that did righteousness; and forsook not the Ordinances of their
God. They ask of me the Ordinances of Justice, they take delight in approaching
to God. Wherefore have we fasted say they, and thou see not, wherefore have
we afflicted our souls, and thou take no knowledge? Thus duty is improved
against duty, the externals against the internals of Religion, and multitudes
are blinded this way.

Sixthly, The policy of Satan improves zeal against zeal; and thereby blinds a
great part of the world: he allows men to be zealous against a false religion,
if thereby he may prevent them from being zealous in the true Religion. He
diverts their zeal against their own sins, by spending it against other men's.
Thus Paul was once blinded by his own zeal for the law, Act. 22. 3. And many
men at this day satisfy themselves in their own zeal against the corruptions
of Gods worship, and the superstitions of others; who never felt the power of
true Religion upon their own hearts: a dangerous blind of Satan.

Seventhly, The policy of Satan improves the esteem and respect men have from
the people of God, against their great duty and interest to become such
themselves, Rev. 3. 1. Thou have a name that thou live, but thou art dead. It
is enough to many men that they obtain acceptance among the Saints, though
they be none of that number; the good opinion of others begets and confirms
their good opinion of themselves.

Eighthly, The policy of Satan improves soundness of Judgment, against
soundness of heart. An Orthodox head, against an Orthodox heart and life;
Dogmatical faith, against justifying says. This was the case of them before
mentioned, Romans 2. 18, 19. Men satisfy themselves that they have a sound
understanding, though mean while they have a very rotten heart. It Is enough for
them that their heads are regular, though their hearts and lives be very
irre^gular.

Ninthly, The policy of Satan improves the blessings of God, against the
blessings of God, blinding us by the blessings of providence, so as not to
discern the want of spiritual blessings, persuading men that the smiles of
providence in their prosperity, succe^s, and thriving designs in the world, are
good evidences of the love of God to their souls, not at all discerning how the
prosperity of fools deceives them, and that riches are often given to the hurt
of the owners thereof.

Tenthly, The policy of Satan improves comforts against comfort, false and
ungrounded comforts under the word, against the real grounds of comfort, lying
in the souls interest in Christ. Thus many men finding a great deal of comfort
in the promises, are so blinded thereby, as never to look after Union with
Christ the only solid ground of all true comfort, Heb. 6. 5, 9.

And thus you see, how the God of this world blinds the minds of them that
believe not, and how the Gospel is hid to them that are lost.

The Thirty fifth SERMON. Sermon 35.

2 COR. 4. 3, 4. Text.
But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the god of
this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of
the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
THe words have been opened, and this point observed.

DOCT.
That the understandings of all unbelievers are blinded by Satan's Doct.
policies, in order to their everlasting perdition.

We have shown already what the blinding of the mind, or hiding of the Gospel
from it is, it has also been demonstrated that the Gospel is hid, and the
minds of many blinded under it; you have also seen what policies Satan uses to
blind the minds of men, even in the clearest light of the Gospel. It remains
now that I open to you the dreadful nature of this judgment of God upon the
souls of men, and then make application of the whole.

There are many Judgments of God inflicted upon the souls and bodies of men in
this world, but none of them are so dreadful as those Spiritual Judgments are,
which God inflicts immediately upon the soul; and among Spiritual Judgments
few or none are of more dreadful nature and consequence, than this of spiritual
blindness; which will appear by considering,

First, The Subject of this Judgment which is the soul, and the principal
power of the soul, which is the mind and understanding faculty: the soul is the
most precious and invaluable part of man, and the mind is the superior and
most noble power of the soul: it is to the soul what the eye is to the body,
the directive faculty. The bodily eye is a curious, tender, and most precious
part of the body. When we would express the value of a thing, we say, we prize
it as our eyes. The loss of the eyes is a sore loss, we lose a great part of
the comfort of this world by it. Yet such an affliction (speaking
comparatively) is but a trifle to this. If our bodily eyes be blinded we cannot
see the sun, but if our spiritual eye be blinded we cannot see God, we wander
in the paths of sin, 1 John 2. 11. we are led blindfold to hell by Satan, as
the Syrians were into Samaria, 2 Kings 6. 19, 20. and then our eyes like theirs
will be opened to see our misery, when it is too late, The light of the body is
the eye (says Christ) If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall
be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness! Mat. 6. 22, 23. By the eye he means the practical judgment, the
understanding faculty, which is the seat of principles, the common treasury of
rules for practice, according unto which a man's life is formed, and his way
directed. If therefore this power of the soul be darkened, how great must that
darkness be! for now the blind lead the blind, and both fall into the ditch.
The blind judgment misguides the blind affections; and both fall into hell. O
what a sad thing is it that the Devil should lead that, that leads thee? That
he should sit at the helm, and steer thy course to damnation? The blinding of
this noble faculty precipitates the soul into the most dangerous courses,
persecution by this means seems to be true zeal for God. John 16. 2. They that
persecute you shall think that they do God service. Paul once thought verily
with himself, that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of
Nazareth, Acts 26. 9. (i. e.) He thought he had pleased God, when he was
imprisoning and persecuting his people; as many do at this day: it will make a
man to sin conscientiously, which is a very dangerous way of sinning, and
difficult to be reclaimed.

Secondly, it is a dreadful Judgment if we consider the Object about which the
understanding is blinded, which is Jesus Christ, and Union with him;
Regeneration and the nature and necessity thereof. For this blindness is not
universal, but respective and particular. A man may have abundance of light and
knowledge in things natural, and moral: but spiritual things are hi^den from
his eyes. Yea, a man may know spiritual things in a natural way, which
increases his blindness; but he cannot discern them spiritually: this is a
sore judgment, and greatly to be bewailed. Thou have hid these things (said
Christ) from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes, Mat. 11.
25. Learned and knowing men are ignorant of those things which very babes in
Christ understand. They are prudent in the management of earthly affairs* but
to save their own souls they have no knowledge. They are able with Berengarius
to dispute De omni scibili, of every thing investigable by the light of nature:
yea, to open the scripture solidly, and defend the doctrines, and truths of
Christ against his adversaries successfully; and yet blinded in the
greatmystery of regeneration. Blindness in part (says the Apostle) is happened
unto Israel: and that indeed was the principal part of knowledge, viz. the
knowledge of Jesus Christ and him crucified, we see farther than they. The
literal knowledge of Christ shines clearly in our understandings. We are only
blinded about those things which should give us saving interest in him, about
the effectual application of Christ to our own souls.

Thirdly, The dreadful nature of this spiritual blindness farther appears from
the consideration of the season in which it befalls men, which is the very time
of Gods patience, and the only opportunity they have for salvation: after these
opportunities are over, their eyes will be opened to see their misery, but
alas, too late, too late. Upon this account Christ shed those tears over
Jerusalem, Luke 19. 42. O that thou had known, at least in this thy day, the
things that belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes. Now the
season of grace is past and gone: opportunities are the golden spots of time,
and there is much time in a short opportunity, as there are many pieces of
silver in one piece of gold. Time signifies nothing when opportunities are
gone, to be blinded in the very season of salvation is the Judgment of all
Judgments, the greatest misery incident to man; to have our eyes opened, when
the seasons of salvation are past, is but an aggravation of misery: There is a
twofold opening of men's eyes to see their danger.

Viz. 1. Graciously to prevent danger. 2. Judicially to aggravate misery.

They whose eyes are not opened graciously in this world to see their disease
and remedy in Christ, shall have their eyes opened judicially in the world to
come, to see their disease without any remedy. If God open them now, it is by
way of prevention; if they be not opened until then, it will produce
desperation.

Fourthly, The horrible nature of this Judgment farther appears, from the
exceeding difficulty of curing it, especially in men of excellent natural
indowments and accomplishments, Joh. 9. 40, 41. And some of the Pharisees which
were with him, heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? Jesus
said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say we see,
therefore your sin remains, q. d. The pride and conceitedness of your hearts
adds obstinacy and incurableness to your blindness, these are the blind people
that have eyes, Isa. 43. 8. in seeing they see not. The conviction of such men
is next to an impossibility.

Fifthly, The design and end of this blindness under the Gospel is most
dreadful, so says my Text, the God of this world has blinded the minds of
them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is
the image of God, should shine unto them. Answerable whereunto are those words,
Isa. 6. 10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and
Ira est Dei non intelligere delicta, ne sequatur poenitentia, Cyp. Ep. 3.
Percussi sunt animi caecitane ut nec intelligant delicta, nec plangant:
indignantis Dei major haec est ira, Cypr. de lapsis.
shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart; and convert, and be healed. So that it is plain,
this blinding is a praeludium to damnation, as the covering of Hamans face was
to his destruction. When the Lord has no purpose of grace and mercy to a man's
soul, then to bring about the damnation of that man by a righteous permission;
many occasions of blindness befall him, which Satan improves effectually unto
his eternal ruin, among which fatal occasions, blind guides, and scandalous
professors are none of the least, they shall be fitted with Ministers suitable
to their humors, who shall speak smooth things: if a man walk in the Spirit,
and falsehood (i. e. by an (...) -- the spirit of falsehood) do lie saying, I
will prophecy to thee of wine and strong drink. he shall even be the prophet
of this people: and the slips and falls of professors shall do the Devil not a
little service in this his fatal design. Mat. 18. 7. Woe to the world because of
offenses: This shall blind them, and harden them to purpose. Thus you see what
a dreadful Judgment this is, a stroke of God upon the soul which cuts off all
the present comforts of Christ and Religion from it, takes away the bridle of
restraint from sin, and makes way for the final ruin of the soul. A far
greater Judgment it is, than the greatest calamity or affliction, which can
befall us in this world. If our names suffer by the greatest reproaches, our
bodies by the most painful diseases, our estates by the greatest losses; if God
strike every comfort we have in this world dead by affliction: all this is
nothing compared with this blinding Judgment of God upon the soul. For they
may come from the tender love of God to us, Heb. 12. 6. But this is the effect
of his wrath, they may cleanse sin, Isa. 27. 9. but this increases it; they
often prove occasions of conversion, Job 36. 8, 9. but this is the great
obstruction to it. In a word, they only wound the flesh, and that with a
curable wound; but this stabs the soul, and that with a mortal wound.

1st. Use of Information. Use 1.

Inference 1.
If this be the case of the unbelieving world to be so blinded by the God of
the world; how little should we value the censures and Inference 1.
slanders of the blind world? Certainly they should move no other affection but
pity in our souls: If their eyes were opened, their mouths would be shut, they
would never traduce Religion and the sincere professors of it as they do, if
Satan had not blinded their minds: they speak evil of the things they know not,
their reproaches which they let fly so freely, are but so many arrows shot by
the blind man's bow, which only stick in our clothes and can do us no hurt,
except we thrust them onward by our own discontent to the wounding of our
spirits. I could almost be proud upon it (said Luther) that I have got an ill
name Superbus fio quod video nomen pessimum mihi crescere. Luther. Gratias ago
Deo meo, quod dig n^s sum quem mundus oderit. Hieronymus.
among the worst men. Beware Christians that you give them no occasion to
blaspheme the name of your God, and then never trouble your selves however they
use your names. If they tread it in the dirt now, God (as one speaks) will take
it up, wash off all that dirt, and deliver it you again clear and shining.
Should such men speak well of us, we might justly suspect our selves of some
iniquity which administers to them the occasion of it.

Inference 2.
How absurd and dangerous must it be for Christians to follow Inference 2.
the examples of the blind world? Let the blind follow the blind, but let not
those whom God has enlightened do so. Christians, never let those lead you, who
are led blindfolded by the Devil themselves. The holiness and heavenliness of
Christians was wont to set the world a wondering that they would not run with
them into the same excess of riot, 1 Pet. 4. 4. But sure since God has opened
your eyes, and showed you the dangerous courses they walk in, it would be the
greatest wonder of all, if you should be the companions of such men, and tread
in the steps of their examples. Christian, as humble and lowly thoughts as thou
have of thy self, yet I would have thee understand thy self to be too good to
be the associate of such men. Discamus sanctam superbiam, and sciamus nos esse
illis meliores. If they will walk with you in the way of duty and holiness, let
them come and welcome: receive them with both arms, and be glad of their
company; but beware you walk not in their paths, lest they be a snare unto you.
Did they see the end of their way, they would never walk in it themselves, why
then will you walk with them, who do see it?

Inference 3.
If this be so, let Christians be exact, and circumspect in their walking, lest
they lay a stumbling block in the way of the blind. Inference 3.
It Is a great sin to do so in a proper sense, Lev. 19. 14. Thou shall not put a
stumbling block before the blind. And a far greater to do it in a Metaphorical
sense, Romans 14. 13. It Is the express will of God, that no man put a stumbling
block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way. It Is an argument of little
regard to the honor of Christ, or the souls of men so to do. O professors,
look to your steps. The Devil desires to make use of you for such purposes. The
sins of thousands of others who make no profession of godliness, will never so
fit his purpose for the blinding of those men's eyes, as the least slip or
failing of yours will do. It Is the living bird that makes the best stale to
draw others into the net: the grossest wickedness of profane sinners passes
away in silence, but all the neighborhood shall ring with your miscarriages. A
righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a
corrupt spring, Prove. 25. 26. The scandalous falls of good men are like a bag
of poison cast by Satan into the Spring from whence the whole town is supplied
with water. You little know what mischies you do, and how many blind sinners
may fall into hell by your occasion.

Inference 4.
How dangerous a thing is zeal in a wicked man? It Is a sharp sword in a blind
man's hand, or like high mettle in a blind Inference 4.
horse: how much has the Church of God suffered upon this account, and does
suffer at this day? The world has ever been full of such blind and blustering
zeal, which like a hurry-cane overturns all that stands in its way: yea, (as we
noted before) it makes a man a kind of conscientious persecutor. I confess it
is better for the persecutor himself to do it ignorantly, because ignorance
leaves him in a capacity for mercy, and sets him a degree lower than the
malicious enlightened persecutor, 1 Timothy 1. 13. Else it were the dreadful case
described in Heb. 10. But yet as it is, John 16. 2. these are the fierce* and
dreadful enemies of the Church of God. Such a man was Paul, a devout
persecutour, and such persecution God afterward suffered to befall himself. Acts
13. 50. But the Jews stirred up the devont and honorable women, and the chief
men of the City; and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled
them out of their coasts. An erroneous conscience binds as well as an informed
conscience, and where ever God gives such men opportunity to vent the spleen
and rage of their hearts upon his people, they will be sure to do it to
purpose. With other men Gamaliels counsel may have some influence, and they may
be afraid lest they be found fighters against God; but blind zeal spurrs on,
and says as Jehu did, Come, see my zeal for the Lord of hosts. O blind
sinners, be sure of your Mark before you discharge your arrows. If you shoot at
a wicked man (as you suppose him) and God finds one of his dear children
wounded, or destroyed; what account will you give of that fact to God, when you
shall come before his Judgment seat?

2d. Use of Exhortation.
This point is very improveable by way of Exhortation, Use. 2.


Both 1. Unto those, who are blinded by the God of this world. 2. To those that
are enlightened in the knowledge of Christ, by the true God.

First, To those who are still blinded by the God of this world, to whom the
Lord has not given unto this day, eyes to see their misery in themselves, or
their remedy in Christ, so as to make an effectual Application of him to their
own souls. To all such my counsel is, 1. To get a sense of your own blindness.
2. To seek out for a cure, whilst yet it may be had.


First, Labor to get a deep sense of the misery of such a condition; for till
you be awakened by conviction, you can never be healed. O that you did but know
the true difference betwixt common and saving light, the want of this keeps you
in darkness: you think because you know the same things that the most
sanctified man does, that therefore there is no difference betwixt his
knowledge and yours; and are therefore ready to say to them as Job to his
friends, Lo, mine eye has seen all this, mine ear has heard, and understood
it: What ye know, the same do I know also; I am not inferior unto you, Job 13.
1, 2. But O that you would be convinced that your knowledge vastly differs from
the knowledge of believers. Though you know the same things that they do, it is
a knowledge of another kind and nature. You know spiritual things in another
way, merely by the light of reason assisted and improved by the common light of
the Gospel: they know the same things by spiritual illumination, and in an
experimental way. 1 John 2. 20. Ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye
know all things. Their knowledge is practical, yours is idle. They are working
out their salvation by that light which God has given them, Psalm. 111. 10.
Their knowledge of God and Christ produces the fruits of faith, obedience,
mortification, and heavenly mindedness in them: It has no such fruits in you:
whatever light there be in your understandings, it makes no alteration at all
upon your hearts. Their light brings them to heaven, John 17. 3. Yours shall be
blown out by death, 1 Cor. 13. 8. and your selves left in the mists of eternal
darkness: except your eyes be opened seasonably by the anointing of the holy
Ghost. Conviction is a great part of your cure.

Secondly, Labor to get a remedy for this dangerous disease of your minds:
Awake to righteousness and sin not, for some have not the knowledge of God: I
speak this to your shame, 1 Cor. 15. 34. These things speak encouragement to
you: though it be a sore Judgment that lies upon you, and very difficult to be
removed: yet remember Jesus Christ is put into Commission by God the Father to
open the blind eyes, Isa. 42. 6, 7. and this excellent Physician bespeaks you
for his patients, Rev. 3. 18. Anoint thine eyes (says he) with eye salve that
thou may see. Yea, the most enlightened Christians were once as dark and
blind in spiritual things as you are, and Christ has cured them, Ephesians. 5. 8.
Once were you darkness, now are ye light in the Lord. Attend therefore upon the
Ordinances of the Gospel diligently; that is Gods enlightening instrument, by
which he couches those Cataracts which blind the eyes of men's understandings,
Acts 26. 18. And if ever you will have your eyes opened, allow your selves time
to ponder, and consider what you hear. The duty of Meditation is a very
enlightening duty: Above all cry to the Lord Jesus Christ as that poor man did,
Lord that mine eyes may be opened, that I may receive my sight. Say, Lord, this
is my disease and danger, that in seeing I see not: others see natural things
in a spiritual way, whilst I see spiritual things only in a natural way: their
light is operative upon their hearts, mine is but an idle impractical notion of
Religion, which brings forth ^no fruit of holiness. Their knowledge sets their
hands a work in duties of obedience: mine only sets my tongue a work in
discourses of those things which my heart never felt. Lord, open mine eyes and
make me to see out of this obscurity: All the light that is in me is but
darkness. O Lord enlighten my darkness, enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the
sleep of death.

Secondly, Let it be a word of counsel and exhortation to such as once were
blind, but do now see.

First, I beseech you bless God for the least degree of spiritual illumination.
Truly light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun,
Eccles. 11. 7. But Oh how sweet is spiritual light! and what a pleasant thing
to behold the Son of Righteousness! Blessed are your eyes for they see. God
has brought you out of darkness into mavelous light. And mavelous indeed
it must needs be, when you consider how many wise and prudent men are under the
power of spiritual darkness, whilst such babes as you, are enlightened. Mat.
11. 25. It greatly affected the heart of Christ, O let it affect yours also.

Secondly, Labor to get a clearer sight of spiritual things every day. For all
spiritual light is increasing light, which shines more and more unto the
perfect day, Prove. 4. 18. O if a little spiritual light be so comfortable, what
would more be? The wisdom of God is a manifold wisdom, Ephesians. 3. 16. The best of
us see but little of it. Labor therefore to know spiritual things more
extensively, and more experimentally, Phil. 3. 8, 9. be still increasing in the
knowledge of God.

Thirdly, Walk as men whose eyes are opened. Once ye were darkness, now are ye
light in the Lord; walk as children of the light, Ephesians. 5. 8. Else your light
will but aggravate your sin. Remember how it displeased God that Solomon's heart
was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared to him twice, 1 Kings
11. 9. Remember how angry God was with the Heathens for abusing the dim common
light of nature, Romans 1. 21. how much more evil is it in you to abuse the most
precious light that shines in this world? and what mischievous effects the
abuse of your light will have upon this blind world. It was a smart rebuke
given once by an Atheist to a good man, who being asked by him how he could
satisfy his conscience to live as he did? nay rather said the Atheist, I
wonder how you can satisfy your self to live as you do; for did I believe as
you do, that there is such a Christ, and such a glory as you believe there is;
I would pray and live at another rate than you do.

The Conclusion.
And now Reader, after all my discourses of the method of Christ in purchasing
the great Salvation for us, and the way of the Spirit in applying it, and
making it effectual to Gods Elect; thou have two wonders before thine eyes,
either of which may astonish thy soul in the consideration of them. Viz. 1. The
admirable Grace of God in preparing this great salvation. 2. The desperate
wickedness of man in rejecting

First, Behold the riches of the goodness and mercy of God 1.
in preparing such a remedy as this for lost man. This is that which is justly
called the great mystery of Godliness, 1 Timothy 3. 16. That mystery which the
Prophets enquired diligently after, yea, which the Angels desire to look into,
1 Pet. 1. 10, 12. In this glorious mystery of Redemption tha^ (...) manifold
wisdom of God, or that wisdom which has such curious and admirable variety in
it, is illustriously displayed, Ephesians. 4. 10. Yea, the contrivement of our
Redemption this way, is the most glorious display of Divine Love that ever was
made, or can be made in this world to the children of men: for so the Apostle
will be understood when he says, Romans 3. 8. (...) -- God has set forth or
presented his love to man in the most taking manner, in a way that commends it
beyond all compare, to the acceptance of men. This is a faithful saying and
worthy of all acceptance, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save
sinners, 1 Timothy 1. 15. It might be justly expected, that when this glorious
mystery should come to be published by the Gospel in the ears of sinners, all
eyes should be withdrawn from all other objects, and fixed with admiration upon
Christ, all hearts should be ravished with these glad tidings; and every man
pressing to Christ with greatest zeal and diligence. But behold, instead
thereof,

Secondly, The desperate wickedness of the world in rejecting the only remedy
prepared for them. This was long since foretold by the Prophet Isaiah 53. 3. He
is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, (...) desitio
virorum. Nil habit infoelix paupertas durius in se, quam quod ridiculos homines
facit. Juver.
and we esteemed him not: His poor and mean appearance, which should endear him
beyond all considerations to the souls of men (since it was for their sakes
that he emptied himself of all his glory,) yet this lays him under contempt, he
is looked on as the very offcast of men; when his own love to man had emptied
him of all his riches, the wickedness of men loaded him with contempt, and as
it was prophesied of him, so it was, and at this day is sadly verified all the
world over. For

First, The Pagan world has no knowledge of him, they are lost in darkness.
God has suffered them to walk in their own ways, Acts 14. 16.

Secondly, The Mahumetans which overspread so great a part of the world reject
him, and instead os the blessed Gospel which they hiss out with abhorrence,
embrace the blasphemous and ridiculous Alcoran, which they confidently affirm
to have come down srom God immediately in that laylatto Hanzili (as they call
it) the night of demission, calling all Christians Cafirouna (i. e.) infidels.

Thirdly, The Jews reject him with abhorrence, and spit at his very name, and
being blindfolded by the Devil, they call Jesus Anathema, 1 Cor. 12. 3. And in
a blind zeal for Moses, blaspheme him as an Impostor. He came to his own, and
his own received him not, John 1. 11.

Fourthly, The far greater part of the Christianized world reject him: those
that are called after his name, will not (...) nomen (...), and non (...) vi^
(...), qu^ (...) est quam praevaricati^ divini nominis? Cyp. de Zelo.
submit to his Government. The Nobles of the world think themselves dishonored
by submitting their necks to his yoke. The Sensualists of the world will not
deny their lusts, or forsake their pleasures, for all the treasures of
righteousness, life, and peace which his blood has purchased. The worldlings
of the earth prefer the dirt and dung of the world before him: and few there be
among them that profess Christianity, who love the Lord Jesus in sincerity. The
only reason why they are called Christians, is because by the advantageous cast
of providence, they were born and educated in a nation where Christianity is
professed, and established by the laws of the Country: and if the wind should
turn, and the public Authority think fit to establish another Religion; they
can shift their sayls, and steer a contrary Course.

But now Reader let me tell thee, that if ever God send forth those two grim
Sergeants, his Law and thine own conscience, to arrest thee for thy sins, if
thou find thy self dragging away by them toward that prison from whence none
return, that are once clapped up therein, and that in this unspeakable distress
Jesus Christ manifest himself to thy soul, and open thy heart to receive him,
and become thy surety with God, pay all thy debts, and cancel all thy
obligations, Thou will love him at another rate than others do: his blood will
run deeper in thine eyes than it does in the shallow apprehensions of the
world: he will be altogether lovely, and thou will account all things but dung
and dross in comparison of the excellency of Jesus Christ thy Lord. To work thy
heart to this frame these things are written, which the Lord prosper upon thy
soul by the blessing of his good Spirit upon them.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
