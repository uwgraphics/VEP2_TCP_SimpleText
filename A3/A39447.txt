THE CHARACTER OF A TAVERN.

With A brief draught of a DRAWER.



LONDON, Printed for D. A. 1675.

THE Character OF A TAVERN, etc.
ATavern is an Academy of Debauchery, where the Devil teaches the seven deadly
sins instead of Sciences, a Tipling-School a degree above an Alehouse, where
you may be drunk with more Credit and Apology, it is the Randevouz of Gallants,
the Good Fellows Paradise, and the Misers Terror, who fits here in fear of his
Life because of the shot; A Map of the World, where all humors are drawn in
Epitome, and the best Theater of Natures and Dispositions, which are here truly
Acted not Played; A melancholy man may find matter enough to divert him, to see
Heads as Brittle as Glasses, and as often broken, to observe men both come
hither to Quarrel, and come hither to be made Friends, so that if the simile
were not already worn thredbare, I would call it Telephus's Sword that both
makes wounds and cures them.

It Is an Engine of the largest size, for draining the Pocket, the common
Consumption of the Afternoon, and the maker away of a Rainy day, a Torrid Zone
that scorches their Faces that long Inhabit it, whilst Tobacco is the Gun
powder that blows them up, so that much danger were to be dreaded if the
Charitable Vintner should not have store of Water ready to allay these Flames;
House of Sin you may call it, but not a House of Darkness, For the Candles are
seldom out, and it is like those Countries near the North Pole, where it is as
clear at midnight as at mid day.

It Is a Bedlam of Wits, where men ate rather mad than merry, here one breaking
a Jest on the Drawer, or perhaps a Candlestick or Bottle over his Crown, there
another repeating scraps of old Plays, or some Bawdy Song, this speaking
Latin, and a fourth Nonsense, whilst all with loud hooting and laughing
confound the noise of Fiddlers, who are properly called a Noise, for no Music
can be heard for them; It Is a Babel of Voices, a Gallimans fry of Opinions, and
an Hodge Podge of Nations, you shall hear one talking very gravely of Religion,
and another Ranting, and swearing Dammee, and Sink me, at the same instant,
parties of different Sects and persuasions will meet here, and be sociable
though not at Church; And below in the Cellar you shall see the French and the
Spanish, with the Natives of the Rhine (notwithstanding the present Wars
between them) lie quietly altogether.

As you come in to show that you are going to a Trial of your Lives, you must
first appear at the Bar, where Madam Minks with her Head behung with as many
Toys as their Bush, sits like the Goddess Semele (Mother of Bacchus) under her
all-commanding Canopy, Casting the Nativityes of your Estates in strange
Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Trithemian Characters; And finds by the Horoscope
of the Board, and frequent Ill Directions of Score in the Half Moon, That your
Fortunes are short-lived, and your Purses declining into an Irrevocable
Consumption; Next the Blew Apron'd Captain of this Enchanted Castle comes into
view, you would take him for a Hogshead set on two stumps, and moved by Scrues
or Clockwork, for his Belly is big enough for a Popish Limbus, yet coming
nearer, you may discern somewhat like that which in Men they call a Face, but
broader then the Pewter Platter in Sr. Johns-street, and studded and embost all
over with vices Heraldry.

In the midst of which his Nose blazes like a Comet, and infallibly pretends
drought: He thinks nature gave him a Mouth, not so much to speak, as to drink
off his Liquor, For that is the main use he puts it to, and of all the miracles
that ever Christ did, he thinks none so meritorious, As the turning Water into
Wine, which he himself often endeavors to imitate.

These Animals we must pray, entreat, crave, beseech, and implore for a Bottle
that is neat and brisk, and Racy, and at last go without it, unless we bribe
Death's Emissaries, those Dregs and Lees of Mortality, your yauling, impudent,
saucy, nimble-tongued A-non-a-non Sirs, to whom once more you must beg as
heartily as a Condemned Man does for a Reprieve, That they would graciously be
pleased not to poison you at your own charge; Indeed there is scarce a Pint
true, wholesome and right drank, which the Guests do not twice pay for, first to
the Drawer, and then to the Master, and there is more Wine vended in a year, in
this one overgrown City, under the notion of Canary, than the whole Canaries
produce; But there lies the Excellency and Mystery of the Trade, he that is
best at Brewing and Balderdashing Wines is most esteemed, and this they call
managing a Cellar, the end of which is to cheat Men's Palates, and the effect to
destroy their Bodies: The Pharmacopeia of a Mountebank, or the Quackeries of
Moor fields, befriend not the Grave-makers, so much as these Squires of the
Spiggot do; for Pandora's Box never gave vent to the Tyth of those mischiefs
that are broached with a Pip^ of sophisticated Wine, which makes me fancy when
they Ring for the Boy to fetch the other Pint, that I hear the Passing bell of
those that send for it. And when the splay mouthed Rascals cry, Do You call Sir,
Methinks it sounds like Charons Voice summoning us to his Ferry-boat: To hear
them baul out their Hypocritical well come, the Satyr would as much wonder as at
the Man, that blew hot and cold: For they welcome when you go in, and welcome
when you go out, and yet it is not you are welcome at all, but your Money.

Nor is it only with their Cups (like Circe) that they inchant us, they can
help you to a dainty morsel too at Luculluses price; Their Fricacies and
Phagon's, Dishes you must pay four times over for. First, for the meat.
Secondly, for dressing. Thirdly, for sausce. And Fourthly, for the hard name;
When they provide you a Dinner, you were better keep open house all Christmas,
their Extravagant Treats in the great Chamber, serve only to debauch the
Hospitality of private Families, and are most effectual decoys, where a young
Bridegroom many times spends half his Wives Portion for the convenience of
Dancing and Fiddles; Let the Room be never so neat when you come in, after a
little fitting, It becomes like the street after a dashing shower, where the
Spouts are flushing above, and the Conduits running below, whilst the Iordans
like swelling Rivers overflow their Banks, and the Urine drops through the
Ceiling into the mouth of him that sits under;

In brief, a Tavern is a Scene of Confusion; A Gulf to swallow up a Man's Money,
and his time, which is yet more precious; a Nursery of Extravagancy, and a
necessary place for Assignations between Cracks and their Cullies.

FINIS.
