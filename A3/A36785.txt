OR, A NEW ACCOUNT OF THE BLOODY Spanish Inquisition. PUBLISHED AS A CAVEAT TO
Protestants.

LONDON, Printed for John Hancock at the Three Bibles in Popes-Head-Alley over
against the Royal Exchange in Cornhil, 1680.

To the Most Excellent PRINCE JAMES Duke of Monmouth, etc.
I Have often wondered that the Cruelties as well as Villainies of the Romish
Church have not long ere this provoked Almighty God to avenge upon her all the
Blood of his Saints, which she has every where as so much Water, spilt upon
the face of the whole Earth; but reflecting upon the many Sins of Gods own
people (which certainly have been the only cause of the withholding of his most
just and expected Judgments from being poured forth upon her from the fullest
Vials of his Wrath) I have again considered of the Justice as well as Goodness
of God herein; Justice to be revealed from Heaven upon her, when the Fullness of
her Abominations shall be accomplished; and his Goodness and Mercy to his
People, in purging them by these his Chastisements from the Dross and Tin of
their Iniquities. Here we have a Revelation of the great God in two of his
greatest and most glorious Attributes, his Mercy and his Judgment, according to
their respective Objects. The Holy King and Prophet David wondered no less than
he grieved at this matter, till he went into the Sanctuary of God, where he
understood the End of wicked men, and that verily there is a Reward for the
Righteous, and a God that Judges in the Earth.

With what Antichristian, no less than Inhumane Cruelty she has behaved her
self toward the Saints and Servants of God,, whom she calls Heretics, this
small History will sufficiently acquaint Your Grace, and will, I hope, prove a
sufficient Alarm to the Nation, to rowse her up as one Man, to prevent and
hinder the Rooting or Springing of her vile Superstitions here for the time to
come. No, Sir, the People of England are doubtless sufficiently cautioned and
fortified against any such Attempt; however it may not perhaps be unseasonable
to remind them, and fully set before them the barbarous Cruelties and
unchristian Severities wherewith the Holy Inquisition (for so they falsely style
it) is to the shame and sorrow of the best amongst them in Foreign Countries,
where it is suffered in the highest pitch of Rigor to be managed; no, we hope
so great is the Goodness of God both toward our Prince and People, that it is
past not only the strength, but Malice of our Romish Adversaries to hurt either
his Sacred Person or the Government. May the Good Will of him that dwelt in the
Bush preserve and ever keep Your Grace from any of their wicked Attempts upon
Your Excellencies Person, from dividing you from Your Princes Favor; or, which
can never be, Our most Sacred and ever Dread Sovereign from His good Subjects
and People; and let all true-hearted Englishmen say Amen.

Your Graces Most Humble Servant, and Daily Orator, RIC. DUGDALE.

The Original, Progress and Practice of the SPANISH INQVISITION.
WHen King Ferdinand, The Spanish Inquisition*
and Isabel had expelled the Turks out of the City and Territories of Granata,
and other places of Spain; who had lived there Seven hundred seventy and eight
years; they set upon the Reformation of Religion, and the Conquered Moors
Liberty to stay and to enjoy all their Goods, provided they would turn
Christians: And whereas also, there were many Jews, who had continued there,
since Titus conquered Jerusalem; they gave them leave to stay upon the same
condition; but all such as refused were commanded presently to depart out of
Spain. Yet afterward finding, that those Persons were Christans, only in Name,
and had submitted only to save their Estates; instead of providing godly
Ministers with meekness to instruct them, and to them for their Errors:
Invented by Dominicans
(by the advice of the Dominican Friars) they erected the Inquisition; wherein
the poor Wretches instead of Instruction, were robbed of all their Estates; and
either put to most cruel Deaths, or else suffered most intolerable Torments,
by whipping, etc. And leading the rest of their Lives in Ignominy and Poverty:
Neither was this inflicted only upon such as Blasphemed Christ, but for the
Observation of the least Jewish or Moorish Ceremony, or the smallest Error in
the Christian Religion. But this Inquisition at first erected against Jews and
Moors was afterward turned against the faithful Servants of Jesus Christ; and
for the suppressing of the Gospel, and the Profession of it.

As soon as Information is given in against any one, though but for a very
small matter; they do not presently cite the Person to appear before them, but
they suborn one of their own Officers, called a Familiar to insinuate himself
into his company, who taking occasion to meet the Party thus accused, used,
thus to greet him. Sir, I was yesterday by accident at my Lords Inquisitors,
who said that they had occasion to speak with you, about certain of their
affairs; and therefore they commanded me to Summon you to appear before them to
Morrow at such an hour: The Party daring not to refuse, goes to the place,
sends in word that he is come to attend them; and so when he is called in, they
ask him, what Suit he has to them? And when he answers that he comes upon
Summons, they enquire his Name: for say they, we know not whether you are the
same man or not, but since you are come, if you have any thing to inform this
Court of, either concerning your self or any other, you may let us hear it, for
the discharge of your own conscience. The Parties safest way, is constantly to
deny that he has any thing to declare to them; but if through simplicity, he
does accuse himself or any other; they rejoice, as having attained their
desires, and so presently commit him to Prison: If nothing be confessed, they
dismiss him; pretending that for the present they know not whether he be the
Party or no: After his departure they let him alone for some space, and then
send for him again, exhorting him, that if he know or has heard any thing,
that concerns their Holy Court, to disclose it to them, for (say they) we know
that you have had dealings with some Person suspected in Religion; Subtilty.
and therefore remember your self well; If you confess, you shall fare the
better, and you shall but do therein as a good Christian ought to do: If still
he refuse, they threaten, and so dismiss him.

Yet they have always one or other to keep him Company, to creep into his
Bosom, and grope his Conscience; who under the color of Friendship, shall
visit him daily, and have an eye to all his dealings; observe what Company he
keeps, with whom he conferrs, etc. So that without Gods special assistance,
it is not possible to escape their Snares. The Inquisitors also, if they meet
him, speak courteously to him, promise to befriend him, etc. and all to make
him more careless of himself, that they may undo him before he be aware: But if
the Party be a Stranger, or one that is like to make an escape, or that they
hope to gain any thing by his confession, Their dealing with Strangers.
they presently clap him up in Prison, in which Prison great Numbers die,
either starved with hunger, or by extremity of racking of them, etc.

If any one that is accused, chance to make an escape, they have many devices
to find and fetch him in again; they have Store of Searchers to whom besides
the common Signs, they give his lively Picture, whereby they may easily know
him, An Italian, at Rome, Their Famimiliars.
having wounded an Apparitor, fled to Sevil; the Familiars were sent to seek
him, and when they had found him, though they had his Counterfeit, yet by
reason that he had altered his Habit, they were doubtful whether it was he or
no, the rather because he had changed his Name, whereupon they followed him
only upon suspicion; but one Day as he was walking, and earnestly talking with
some Gentlemen, two of those Familiars suddenly called him by his old Name: The
Party earnest in talk, and not minding it, looked behind him, and made answer,
whereupon they presently apprehended him, clapped him in Irons for a long time,
then whipped him, and condemned him to the Galleys, during his Life. So soon as
any is arrested by the Familiars, they take from him all the Keys of his Locks,
or Chests whatsoever: and then they take an Inventory of all his goods, leaving
them to some man that will undertake to be accountable for them. But in the
Sequestring, Sequestration.
or rifling the Houses, if they have any Gold, Silver, or Jewels: these
Familiars, which are usually, Bauds, Theives, Shifters, and the vilest of
People, will be sure to filch some of it; and the reason of this Sequestration,
is, that if the Party be condemned, the holy Inquisition may enjoy his whole
Estate.

As soon as the Prisoner is entered within the first Gate of the Prison; the
Jailer asks him, If he has a Knife about him, or Money, or Rings, or Jewels?
and if a woman, whether she has Knives, Stripped of all In prison.
Rings, Chains, Bracelets, or other Ornaments; and all these the Jailer strips
them of, as his Fee, and this is done, that the Poor Prisoners may have nothing
to relieve themselves with* during their Imprisonment: They search them also,
to see whether they have any Writing, or Book about them, which likewise they
take from them; then they shut them up in a Cabin, like to a Little-Ease, where
they have little Room for cleanliness and but little light.

Some are thus kept all alone for two or three Months, some as long as they
live; others have company, as the Lords Inquisitors please. When the party has
been in prison a week or two, the Jailer persuades him to petition for a day of
hearing, telling him, the sooner the better; and that it will much further his
Cause, and bring it to some good effect, etc. whereas it were far beter for him
to stay till he be called for; for then he has nothing to do but to answer
their Objections. But the poor Prisoner not knowing this Mystery, is usually
ruled by his Keeper, Subtilty.
entreating him to stand his Friend to procure him a day of hearing; whose Suit
is easily heard, and the Prisoner is brought into the Consistory; then the
Inquisitors ask him, What is his Request? The Prisoner answers, That he would
gladly have his Matter heard: Then they labor by threatening him with worse
usage if he conceal the Truth, to cause him to confess the thing whereof he is
accused; and if they can but draw him to this, they have their desires; for
usually they draw more from him than they could have proved against him. How
Inquisitors deal with the prisoners.
Then they advise him to let him come from himself; promising that if he
acknowledge his faults, he shall presently be released and sent home; if yet he
stands mute, they then charge him to disburden his Conscience, and in the mean
time to return to his Prison, till he has better bethought himself, and then
he may sue for a new day of hearing, and so they dismiss him. And some days
after, they call for him again; asking him whether he be yet determined to tell
ought? But whether he plead his Innocence, or confess some little, they still
urge him to disburthen his Conscience, and persuading him, that they advise him
for the best, and in love and compassion to him, but if he now refuse the
Favor proffered, he shall find them afterward sharp Justices, etc. and so
send him back again to prison.

The third time he is called for, they use the like Subtilty, to draw him to
Confession; telling him, that if he refuse, they must use extremity, and do
what they can by Law; by which word, they mean extreme tormenting and mangling
of him. Then if the party confess any thing, Nay, say they, we are not yet
satisfied, we have not all you can say, you keep back something on purpose, and
so they remand him to prison.

Having thus excruciated him day by day, if they can yet get nothing out of
him, they then require an Oath of him, and hold a Crucifix or Cross before him,
whereby the poor Christian must at last needs show himself; for knowing that he
ought to swear by God alone, who has reserved this Honor to himself, he must
refuse the Oath; which if he do, then they read a large Indictment against him,
wherein they lay to his Charge things that never any man accused him of, and
which, it may be, himself never thought of; and this they do to amaze him, and
so to try if he will confess any of these misdemeanors; or if they can trip him
in his Answers, and so catch him in their net. Then they put him to answer to
every Article particularly extempore, without any time of deliberation; then
they give him Pen, Ink and Paper, requiring him to set down his Answer in
Writing, to see if they can find any difference betwixt his former Answer and
this: And if the party chance to confess ought, then they enquire of whom he
learned it, and whether he has spoken of it before others, and who they are,
and hereby many are brought into trouble; for whether they liked it or not,
they are sure to be questioned, because they did not come and declare it to the
Fathers Inquisitors. Then pretending to show him favor, they appoint him an
Advocate, to blind the Peoples Eyes, as if they proceeded according to the
Rules of Justice; but this Advocate dares not tell his Client any point of Law
that may do him good, for fear of angring the Inquisitors; neither may he speak
privately with his Client, but either before an Inquisitor or a Notary.

Two or three days after the party has had the Copy of his Accusation, he is
called into the Court, where his Advocate is, as if he intended to defend his
Cause; but indeed he dares say nothing to the purpose, for fear of angring the
Inquisitors; only he chears up his Client, and bids him tell the Truth in any
case, as the only way to prevail in that Court, and then is the Prisoner sent
back again; who hopes that now his Case will be heard, and his Business
dispatched; whereas usually these good Fathers let him lie two, or three, or
four years in prison, without ever calling for him again: And if through
Loathsomness and Intolerableness of the Prison, any suit to come to Hearing, it
may be, with much ado he obtains it; but usually that favor is denied them,
yet at length, when they please, they call for him to hear the Depositions of
the Witnesses against him, which yet is not done till the poor Prisoner, by his
grievous imprisonment, is brought so low, as that they think he will rather
choose Death, than such a Life, and therefore will be willing to tell all, that
so he may be rid out of his Misery: then between rebuking and a gentle
admonition, they tell him, that though he has stood out so long, yet at length
they would have him wiser, to confess the Truth; but if he yet refuse to be his
own Accuser, then the Fiscal produces the Depositions, which are deliverd to
the Prisoner; but they are drawn up so intricately and ambiguously, that he
knows not what to make of them; and this they do to conceal the Witnesses, lest
he should except against them; and so to set him on guessing, that so, if he
chance to reckon up any others, to whom he spoke any thing about any of those
Matters, they may thereby get more Grist to their Mill; for they presently
Outlaw such persons, as Favorers of Heretics, for suffering an Heretic to
sow such pestilent Seed amongst them, without complaining thereof to the
Inquisitors.

The Keeper of the Prison also is examined what he has seen and observed of
him in the Prison; and his Testimony is as good as two Testimonies to take away
the Prisoners Life.

They have also promoters to bring in Accusations, who are admitted, though
Frantic Bedlams, or the veriest Varlets that be, and if in their Informations,
they chance to want words of weight, the Inquisitors will help them out, and
prompt them, word by word. Then after three or four days, the Prisoner is
called again, to put in his Answer to the Depositions; But in the Interim, his
Advocate never comes at him, to assist or direct him; but he is left to
himself, without any help, save of God alone. His answer being viewed, he is
remanded to Prison again with this Item, that if he confess not the truth, they
will extort it out of him by extremity.

After two or three Months more he is called for once again, and required to
spoke what he has for himself, or else they must draw to an end. And if he
still shrinks not, but stands firm in his Justification; they proceed to other
Dealings, in comparison of which, all their former dealings are not only
sufferable, but seem reasonable and full of gentleness; for their future
Actions* far exceed all Barbarousness; the Devil himself being not able to go
beyond them in their monstrous Cruelty and Tyranny: for not long after, the
Prisoner is called in before the Inquisitors, who tell him, they have deeply
considered his whole Case, and found out that he does not declare the whole
truth; and therefore they are resolved that he shall be racked; that by force
they may draw from him, what by fair means he will not acknowledge; and
therefore they advise him, rather to do it voluntarily, and thereby to avoid
the Pain and Peril, that yet attends him: yet whether he confess, or not
confess, all is one; They proceed to the Rank.
to the Rack he must go; Then is he lead into the place; where the Rack
stands; which is a deep and dark Dungeon, under ground, with many Doors to
pass through, ere a man come to it; because the Shrieks and Cries of the
tormented should not be heard. Then the Inquisitors seat themselves upon a
Scaffold, hard by the Rack; and the Torches being lighted, the Executioner
comes in, all arrayed from Top to Toe, in a Suit of Black Canvas; his head is
covered with a long Black Hood, that covers all his Face, having only two
Peepholes for his Eyes; which sight does more affright the poor Soul, to see
one in the likeness of a Devil to be his Tormentor. The Lords being set in
their Places, they begin again to exhort him to speak the truth freely and
voluntarily; then with sharp words, they command him to be stripped start
naked, yea, though the modestest Maid, the chastest Matron in the City; whose
grief in regard of the Rack, is not so great, as to be seen naked in the
presence of such manner of Persons: For these wicked Villains, without any
regard of Modesty, will not by any Prayers of godly Matrons, or chaste Maidens
forbear one jot of that Barbarous Impudence; as if a shirt or smock could
hinder the violence of the Rack, from sufficiently tormenting them.

The Party being thus stripped; the Inquisitors signify to the Tormentor, how
they would have him or her ordered. The first kind of Torment, is the Gibbet or
Pully; but first one comes behind him, and binds his Hands with a Cord, eight
or ten times about; the Inquisitors calling upon him, to strain each harder
than other: they cause also his Thumbs to be bound extreme hard with a small
Line; and so both Hands and Thumbs are fastened to a Pully, which hangs on the
Gibbet; then they put great and heavy Bolts on his Heels, and hang upon those
Bolts between his Feet certain weights of Iron, The Gibbet:
and so hoise him or her up from the ground; and while the poor Wretch hangs in
this plight, they begin to exhort him again to accuse himself and as many
others as he knows of; then they command him, to be hoised up higher, Inhumane
Cruelty.
to the very Beam, till his headtouch the Pullie; having hung thus agood while,
they command him to be let down, and twice so much weight to be fastened to his
Heels, and so hoised up again, and one Inch higher, if it may be; then they
command the Hangman to let him up and down, that the weights of the Irons
hanging at his Heels may rent every joint in his Body a funder; with which
Intolerable Pains, if the party shreek or cry out, they roar out a loud to him,
to confess the truth, or else he shall come down with a Vengeance: then they
bid the Hangman suddenly to slip the Rope, that he may fall down with a sway,
and in the midway to stop; thus they give him the Strappado, which being as
soon done, it rends all his Body out of joint; Arms, Shoulders, Back, Legs,
etc. by reason of the sudden jerk, and the weights hanging at his Heels; If yet
he remain constant, they ad more weight to his Heels the third time; and the
poor Wretch already half dead, is hoised up the third time, Railings.
and to increase his misery, they rail at him, calling him Dog and Heretic,
telling him that there he is like to make his end: If the poor Creature in his
Pangs call upon Christ, entreating that he would vouchsafe to aid and assist
him, thus miserably tormented for his sake; Scoffs.
then they fall to mocking and deriding him, saying, why call thou on Jesus
Christ? Let Jesus alone, and tell us the truth; what a crying out upon Christ
make thou? etc. but if the Party desire to be let down, promising to tell
some what; that is the ready way to make him be worse used; for now they think
that he begins only to broach the matter, for when he has don, they command
him to be halled up again, and to be let down as before; so that usually these
Torments are exercised upon him, for three hours together; Then they ask the
Jailer if his other Torments are ready, to affright the poor Soul; The Jailer
answers, that they are ready, but he has not brought them with him: Then the
Inquisitors bid him to bring them again the morrow, for say they, we will try
other ways to get the truth out of this Fellow: and so turning to him that lies
in miserable pain, having all his joints out; how now, Sirrah, say they, how
like you this Geer? have you enough of it yet? well, see that you call your
wits to morrow, or look to die then, for what you have felt is but a
Flea-Biting, Threats.
in comparison of what is behind. And so they depart.

Then the Jailer plays the Bone-Setter, so well as he can, setting his Joints,
and so carries him back again to Prison, or drags him by the Arms or Legs most
pitifully: and if they mean to rack him no more, after two or three days they
send for him again, and cause him to be brought by the Rack; where the Hangman
stands in the likeness of a Devil, as before, the more to affright him: when he
comes before the Inquisitors, they fall persuading him to confess the truth at
last; and if he confess any thing, he may chance to to go to the Rack again,
whereby they hope to extort more; and when indeed they intend to rack the Party
again, then at three days end, when the Ach in his Joints is most grievous and
painful to him, they send for him, requiring him to declare all his Heresies,
and to Impeach all such as he has had conference with about them; and all such
as he knows to be of that mind, or else he must prepare himself for the Rack;
and if he continue constant, he is again stripped of his Clothes, Another cruel
Torment.
and hoised up with weights at his Heels, as before; besides which, as he hangs
at the Pullie, they bind his Thighs together, and Legs about the Calf with a
small strong Cord, and with a short piece of wood they twist the Cord till it
be shrunk so deep in the flesh that it is past sight, which is extreme and
terrible torment, worse than any he has yet endured; and in this plight they
let the poor Soul lie two or three hours, the Inquisitors in the mean time not
ceasing to exhort, persuade, threaten and scoff at him.

Yea, sometimes they proceed to another kind of Torture, called the Aselli,
which is after this manner; There is a piece of Timber somewhat hollowed on the
top like a Trough, The Trough.
about the middle whereof there is a sharp Bar going across, whereon a man's
back rests, that it cannot go to the bottom; it is also placed so, that his
Heels shall lie higher than his Head; then is the naked party laid thereon, his
Arms, Thighs and Legs bound with strong small Cords, and wrested with short
Truncheons, till the Cords pierce almost to the very Bone; then they take a
thick fine Lawn Cloth, laying it over the parties Mouth as he lies upright on
his back, so that it may stop his Nostrils also; then taking a quantity of
Water, they pour it in a long stream like a Thread, which falling from on high,
drives the Cloth down into his Throat; which puts the poor wretch into as great
an Agony as any endure in the pains of death; for in this Torture he has not
liberty to draw his Breath, the Water stopping his Mouth, and the Cloth his
Nostrils; so that when the Cloth is drawn out of the bottom of his Throat, it
draws forth Blood with it, and a man would think that it tore out his very
Bowels; this is iterated as often as the Inquisitors please, and yet they
threaten him with worse Torments, if he confess not; and so he is returned to
prison again: Yet many times, after he has lain there a Month or two, he is
brought again to the Rack, and used as before; yea sometimes five or six times,
even as often as they please; for their Lust is their Law: and yet they have
another Torment with Fire, which is no whit inferior to the former: Torment
with fire.
They take a Pan of burning Charcole, and set it just over against the Soles of
the parties feet, just before he goes to the Rack; and that the Fire may have
the more force upon them, they baste them with Lard or Bacon: But if all
Extremity of Torments will not force him to confess what they desire, nor to
deny the Truth; they use other means, by subtle Interrogatories and frequent
Questionings, to draw him into some Snare or other: Yea, if yet they cannot
prevail, then some one of the Inquisitors comes to him in private, and shows
himself much affected with his Misery, Subtilty.
weeps with him, comforts him, gives him Advice, seems to impart such a Secret
to him, as he would scarce impart to his Father, or dearest Friend alive; and
this they use most with Women; whereas they are but fair Baits upon deadly
Hooks, whereby they seek to destroy them: whereof we have this Example.

At Sivil there were apprehended a godly Matron, A woman and her 2 daughters
and her Niece.
two of her daughters, and her Niece, who all of them underwent the
forementioned Torments with manly Courage, and Christian Constancy, because
they would not betray each other, nor other godly persons in that City. The one
of the Inquisitors sent for the youngest Maid often to his Chamber, A Judas.
pretended much compassion toward her, spoke much to comfort her, told her
what a grief it was to him to see her Torments, and then he used familiar and
pleasant communication to her; and told her he would advise her the best way to
free her self, Mother, and Sister from these Troubles, that he would undertake
the ordering of their Business, and then persuaded her to tell the whole Truth
to him, and he bound himself with an Oath that he would stop all further
proceedings against them, and procure their dismission; having thus outwitted
the poor Maid, who gave too much credit to him, she told him of some points of
Religion which they had wont to confer of amongst themselves; and so when he
had gotten out of her what possibly he could, Perjury.
like a perfidious Villain, contrary to his Vows, Promises* and Oath, he caused
her to be racked again, to get more out of her; yea, they put her also to the
intolerable pain of the Trough, and through extremity of Pangs and Torments,
they at last extorted from her a betraying of her own Mother, Sister, and
diverse others, which were immediately apprehended, tortured, and at last burnt
with Fire. But when they were brought with great pomp upon the Scaffold, and
had the Sentence of Death past upon them, this Maid went to her Aunt, who had
instructed her in the Principles of Religion, and boldly, without change of
countenance, gave her hearty thanks for the great benefit which she had
received by her means, entreating her to pardon her for what she had offended
her at any time, for that she was now to depart out of this Life; her Aunt
comforted her stoutly, bid her be of good cheer, for that now ere long they
should be with Christ: This Woman was openly whipped, and kept in prison during
her Life, the rest were all presently burned.

Another Device they have is this; When they think that Prisoners which are
together do talk together of Religion, exhorting and comforting one another, as
they have occasion or opportunity; the Inquisitors commit to prison, under a
color, a crafty Knave, whom they call a Fly, who after two or three days, will
cunningly insinuate himself into the bosom of the other prisoners, and then
pretending a great deal of Zeal to Religion, he will proffer Discourse to them,
and by degrees get out of their Mouths something whereof of he may accuse them:
Then does he move for a day of Hearing, and so getting to the Inquisitors,
impeaches the Prisoners, who shall be sure afterward to hear of it to their
(...); yea, these Flies as soon as they are out of one Prison, for the hope of
gain, will be content presently to be put into another, and then into a third,
where they will lie in Chains, as the other Prisoners do, enduring Hunger,
Cold, Stink, and the Loathsomness of the Prison, and all to betray others; and
this man's Accusation, is as strong and valid as the Testimony of any other
Witness whatsoever. Other Flies also there be that serve the Holy Inquisition
abroad, slily insinuating themselves into the Company of the Common people, who
are suspected to be Lutherans, and when they can pump any thing out of them,
they presently betray them. They I have yet this other Device, when they can
catch any man that is noted for Religion, or a Minister that has instructed
others, after he has been in prison a while, they give it out, that he upon
the Rack has discovered all his Disciples and Acquaintance, and they suborn
others to aver that they heard it: And this they do to draw the simple people
to come of their own accord, and to confess their faults to the Inquisitors,
and to crave pardon, whereupon they promise them favor.

The Inquisitors and their Officers use to call their Prisoners Dogs and
Heretics, and indeed they use them much worse than most men do their Dogs; for
first, the place where usually each of them is laid, Their cruelty concealed.
by reason of the straightness, ill Air, and dampness of of the Earth, is liker
a Grave than a Prison; and if it be aloft, in the hot weather, it is like a hot
Oven or Furnace, and in each of these Holes usually two or three are thronged
together, so that they have no more room than to lie down in. In one Corner is
a Stool of easement, and a Pitcher of Water to quench their Thirst; in these
Cells they have no Light, but what comes in at the Keyhole, or some small
Cranney; other-some there are much worse, not being long enough for a man to
lie in; so that such as are put into them, never likely come out till they be
half rotted away, or die of a Consumption.

Their Diet is answerable to their Lodging; the Rich pay large Fees to the Holy
House, and every Prisoner is rated as the Inquisitors please; but such as are
poor, the King allows Three pence a day, out of which the Steward, Landress and
some other necessary Charges are deducted, so that not one half of it comes to
the Prisoners share; and if any be moved with compassion to relieve them, it is
counted such an heinous Offense, that it will cost him a scourging till blood
come at least. It once hapened that there was Keeper appointed for their Prison
in the Castle of Triana in Sivil, that was of a courteous disposition by
Nature, who used the Prisoners well, and closely, for fear of the Inquisitors,
showed them some favor; at which time there was a godly Matron and her two
Daughters committed to prison, which being put into several Rooms, had a great
desire to see each other for their mutual comfort in their distress; whereupon
they besought the Keeper to suffer them to come together, if it were but for
one quarter of an hour; the Keeper yielded, and so they were together about
half an hour, and then returned to their former Prisons; within a few days
after, these women being racked in a terrible manner, the Keeper fearing lest
they would confess that little favor which he had showed them, of his own
accord went to the Inquisitors, confessed his Fact, All pity denied them.
and craved pardon; but they deemed this so heinous an offense, that they
presently commanded him to be haled to prison, where, by reason of the
extremity showed him, he fell mad; yet this procured him no favor; for after
he had been a whole year in a vile Prison, they brought him upon their
Triumphant Stage, with a Sambenito upon him, and a Rope about his Neck, and
there they censured him to be whipped about the City, and to have two hundred
stripes, and then to serve in the Galleys for six years. The next day one of
his mad Fits coming upon him as he was set on an Asses back to be scourged, he
threw himself off, snatched a Sword out of the Officers hand, and had slain him
if the people had not immediately laid hold on him; whereupon he was bound
faster on the Asses back, had his two hundred stripes, and was for this offense
condemned four years longer to the Galleys.

Another Keeper at another time had a Maid, who seeing how miserably the
Prisoners were used, pitying their distressed condition, who were
hunger-starved and almost pined, she would sometimes speak to them at the
Grate, exhort and comfort them as well as she could, and sometimes would help
them to some good and wholesome Food* yea by her means the Prisoners came to
understand one another condition, which was a great comfort to them; but this
at last coming to the Inquisitors ears, A Maid whipped showing them favor.
they enjoined her to wear the Sambenito; to be whipped about the Streets, to
receive two hundred Stripes, and to be banished the City for ten years, with
this Writing on her Head, A Favourer and Aider of Heretics. And whereas all
other forts of persons in prison and bondage are allowed to recreate and
refresh themselves with Singing at their pleasure, these poor Souls are
forbidden this small Solace in their great misery; The Prisoners denied leave
to sing Pslams.
for if any of them sing a Psalm, or openly recite any Portion of Scripture,
the Inquisitors take it very hainously, and presently send to them, requiring
them to be silent upon the pain of Excommunication; and if the Prisoner make
light of this Warning, he shall have a Bit set on his Tongue to teach him
Obedience; and this they do both to deprive the poor Souls of all kind of
Solace, and to keep other Prisoners from knowing how their Friends do; so that
it often falls out that a man and his Friend, the Father and Son, yea, the
Husband and Wife shall be in one Prisonhouse two or three years together, and
not know of each others being there, till they meet upon the Scaffold, upon the
great day of Triumph:

By reason of this cruel usage, many of the Prisoners die, some of their
Torments, others of the stink of the Prison, and others of Diseases contracted
by Hunger, Cold, ill Diet, etc. They have also an Hospital, unto which they
remove such as fall sick in their Prisons, where yet they are not dealt more
gently with in any thing, Their Hospital.
save that they have Physic allowed them for their healths sake; but none are
suffered to come to them but the Physician and the Servants of the Hospital;
and as soon as the Patient is on the mending hand, he is carried back to the
place from whence he came.

If the Prisoner be half naked, or want something to lie on, and thereupon pray
the Inquisitors that his necessity may be considered; the Answer which he
receives is this, well, now the Weather is warm, you may live full well without
either Clothes or Couch; and if it be the Wintertime, his Answer is, True, it
has been a great Frost of late, but now the Cold is come down again, and it
will be more seasonable weather; care you for the Garments wherewithal you
should cloth your Soul, which consists in uttering the Truth, and
discharging your Conscience before this Holy House; Cruel Mercy.
and if the Prisoner desire to have some good Book, or the Holy Bible, to
enable him to pass that troublesome and careful time to some profit, the
Inquisitors answer him, That the true Book is to speak the Truth, and to
discharge his Conscience to that Holy Court, and that he ought to be occupied
in laying open his wounds to their Lordships, who are ready to give him a
Plaster, whereby it appears that all their care and desire is, that the poor
Prisoner may have nothing to look on or think on but his present miserable
state, that the grief thereof grating upon him, may force him to satisfy the
Request.

The last Act of the Tragedy remains, Their Condemnation.
wherein both Parties are pleased and have their desire; The Inquisitors in
obteining their Prey; the Prisoners in finding some end of their miserable
usage; But two or three days before the Solemnity, they use severally to call
before them all such whose Estates are confiscated, examining them what Lands
or Goods they have; where they lie, charging them upon great penalties, not to
conceal one jot; telling them that if any thing be afterward found, Felony
shall be laid to their Charge, and he with whom it is found shall pay soundly
for it, and when all is Confessed, they are returned to Prison again.

The night before the Festival, they cause all the Prisoners to be brought into
a large Room, where they are informed of the several times of Penances that
they are to do the next day: The next Morning very early the Familiars come,
and attire the Prisoners in their several Habits, Their Habit
in which they are to appear before the people: Some in Sambenitoes, which is a
long Garment painted all over with ugly Devils, on his head he has an High
Crowned Hat, whereon a man is Painted Burning in the Fire with many Devils
about him, plying him with Fire and Faggots; besides their Tongues have a cleft
piece of wood put upon them, which nips and pincheth them that they cannot
speak, they have also about their Necks Cords, and their hands fast bound
behind them. On this sort come these constant Martyrs Disguised first to the
Stage, and then to the Stake, and in the like sort do all the rest come forth
arrayed as the others and set forthwith the like notes of Infamy, either more
or less, as the Inquisitors please to disgrace them in the sight of the People:
on each hand of every Prisoner, goes a Familiar all armed to guard him; as
also two Friars, with every one that is to die, who persuade him tooth and nail
to deny that Doctrine that formerly he has professed, now at the going out of
this world; which wicked Importunity is a grief to the poor Servants of Jesus
Christ.

The Inquisitors also pass in great Pomp from the Castle of Triana to their
Scaffold; and when all are set in their places, a Sermon begins, framed on
purpose in Commendation of the Holy House, and in confutation of such Heretics
as are presently to suffer; but the greatest part is spent in standerous
reproachs, wherewith they vilify and disgrace the truth, and the profession of
it. The Sermon being ended, the Sentence against the Prisoners are read first
against such as have easiest punishment, and so in order to the greater; which
sentences are commonly these, Death without mercy, whipping in such extremity,
that the persons seldom escape with their Lives, Condemnation to the Gally,
forfeiture of all their Estates, etc.

Then does the chief Inquisitor absolve all such as have forsaken Christ, and
are come home to the Church of Rome, from all the Errors for which they showed
themselves penitent; but though hereby they are absolved from the fault, yet
not from the punishment, for notwithstanding their Recantation, they must abide
the punishment without mercy.

And whereas multitudes of People resort to this spectacle, some coming twenty
Leagues to see it, the Inquisitors have this trick to uphold their Kingdom,
they cause all the People present to take an Oath to live and die in the
service of the Church of Rome, hazarding both Lives and Goods against any that
shall oppose it, A wicked Oath.
as also to their Power, to uphold and maintain the holy Inquisition, and to
defend all the Officers thereof, etc.

Then if there be any amongst the Prisoners to be degraded, Degradation.
they proceed after this manner. First they apparel him in his Massing Robes,
then they despoil him again of every part thereof; then are his Hands, Lips,
and the Crown of his Head scraped with a piece of glass, or sharp Knife till
they bleed again, to scrape off the holy Oil wherewith he was anointed at his
Ordination. In the end of their Sentence, which is pronounced upon such as are
to be burned, they use this abominable Hypocrisy: They bequeath him to the
Secular Power, with this humble request to them, Hypocrisy.
to show the prisoner as much favor as may be, and neither to break any Bone,
nor pierce the skin of the Body; This shows their great Impudence, that having
already given sentence on him to be burned, they yet should pretend such Mercy
and Clemency toward him, whom all along themselves have used with such extreme
Cruelty.

They use also this Trick further; that in reading the Crimes, for which he is
condemned; they do not only misreport such things as he confessed upon his
Examination; but they devilishly father upon him such things as he never spoke,
or thought of in all his Life; and this they do to disgrace him, and to make
him and his Opinions more abhorred of all men; and to increase their own
Estimation and Credit, as being necessary Officers to rid the world of such
pestilent Persons; and all this while the Prisoners tongue has a cleft piece
of wood upon it to his intolerable pain and grief, that he cannot answer for
himself, nor gainsay that they charge him with.

All these things being finished, the Magistrate takes them into his hand, and
conveys them presently to the place of Execution, with diverse Instruments of
Satan about them, calling and crying to them, Abominable Lies.
to forsake the truth; and when they cannot prevail, after the Prisoner is tied
to the stake, they break his Neck in a trice, and then they report amongst the
common People, that they recanted their Heresies at the last hour, and so came
home to the Church of Rome, and therefore they felt no pain in the Fire at all.

Such as are not condemned to die, are carried back, and the next day brought
up to be whipped; after which some of them are sent to the Galleys; Their Cruelty
concealed.
others kept in Prison all their Life time. But all have this special charge
given them, that they never speak of any thing that they have heard, seen, or
felt, during their Imprisonment in the Inquisition; for if the contrary be ever
proved against them, and that they utter any of their secrets, they shall be
taken for persons relapsed, and be punished with greatest severity; their
Judgment being Death without Redemption; and hereby they keep in all their
Knavery and Tyranny close and secret to themselves: and if any of them be
released, because their faults were but small; they are yet so careful, lest
their cruelty should come to light, that they inhibit him the company and
conference with any other, than such as they shall appoint and allow him:
neither will they suffer him to write to any Friends, except they first have
the perusing of the Letters.

Sometimes also, after they have imprisoned men in such a miserable state for a
year or two, and can extort nothing out of them by their torments, nor prove
any thing against them by witness, so that they must necessarily dismiss them,
they then call them into the Court, begin to flatter them, and tell them what a
good opinion they have of them; and that they are resolved to send them home,
for the which fatherly favor extended toward them in saving their Lives and
Goods, they are to account themselves much beholding to their Lordships, etc.
and so at last they dismiss him with special charge of silence, and when he is
gone they have special Spies abroad, to see how he takes the matter, and if
they find that he complains of his punishments, or discloses their secrets,
they presently commence a new Suit against him.

On a time, A Lady Imprisoned.
the Inquisitors at Sivil apprehended a Noble Lady, the cause was for that a
Sister of hers, a very Virtuous Virgin; who afterward was burned for Religion
had confessed in the extremity of her Torments; that she had sometimes had
conference with this her Sister about matters of Religion: This Lady when she
was first apprehended, was gone with Child about six Months, in respect whereof
they did not shut her up so close at, nor deal so severely with her, as they
did with others; but within four days after she was brought to Bed; they took
the Child from her, Their Cruel Usage of her.
and the seventh day after they shut her up in close Prison, and used her in
all things as they did other Prisoners; the only wordly comfort she had in her
misery, was that they lodged her with a Virtuous Maiden, that was her Fellow
Prisoner for a time, but afterward burned at the Stake: This Maid whilst they
were together was carried to the Rack, and so sore strained and tore thereon,
that she was* almost pulled in pieces, then was she brought back and thrown
upon a Bed of Flags, that served both to lie on: The good Lady was not able to
help her, yet showed singular tokens of love and compassion toward her,

The Maid was scarce recovered, when the Lady was carried out to be served with
the same Sauce, and was so terribly tormented in the Trough, They torment her
in the Trough.
that by reason of the straight straining of the Strings piercing to the very
Bones of her Arms, Thighs, and Shins; she was brought back half dead to her
Prison, the Blood gushing out of her Mouth abundantly, which showed that
something was broken within her; She died.
but after eight days the Lord delivered her from these cruel Tigers, by taking
her mercifully to himself.

Upon one of their days of Triumph, John Pontio
there was brought out one John Pontio; of a Noble Family, a Zealous Professor
of the Truth, and one of an holy and blameless Life, and well learned; he was
eminent also in works of charity, in which he had spent a great part of his
Estate; being apprehended for the Profession of the Gospel, he was cast into
Prison where he manfully maintained the truth in the, midst of all their cruel
dealings with; at last they; cast into Prison to him on of their Flies, who by
his Subtilty and Craft so wrought upon him, that he drew from him a Promise to
yield obedience to the Romish Church. Human Frailty.
But though God suffered him to fall a while, to show him his Frailty, yet
afterward in much mercy he raised him up again with double strength, to that
which he had before, and before his Execution he manfully defended the truth
against a Subtle Friar. Recovery.
The things which he was condemned for, were these; that he should say, that
from his heart he abhorred the Idolatry, which was committed in worshipping the
Host; that he removed his Household from place to place, that he might shun
coming to Mass; That the Justification of a Christian rests only in the
Merits of Jesus Christ apprehended by Faith, etc. That there was no Purgatory;
that the Popes pardon were of no value: And for my self (says he) I am not
only willing, but desirous to die, His Speech at Death.
and ready to suffer any punishment, for the truth which I have professed: I
esteem not of this World, nor of the Treasures of it, more than for my
necessary use; and the rest to bestow in the Propagation and Maintenance of the
Gospel, and I beseech God daily upon my Knees, for my Wife and Children, that
they may always continue in this quarrel even unto death; and when he came to
his Execution, he patiently and comfortably slept in the Lord.

At the same time, John Gonsalvo.
there was also brought forth one John Gonsalvo, formerly a Priest; but by his
diligent study of the Scripture, it pleased God to reveal his truth to him, so
that he became a Zealous Preacher of it, laboring in all his Sermons to beat
into men's minds, the truth and means of our Justification, to consist in Christ
alone, and in steadfast Faith in him; for which he was apprehended and cast into
Prison, where he endured all their cruelty with Christian Courage: Tormented in
Prison.
at last with two of his Sisters he was condemned; his Mother also and one of
his Brothers were imprisoned with him for the truth, and executed shortly
after; when he with his Sisters went out at the Castle-Gate; having his Tongue
at liberty, he began to sing the 106 Psalm before all the People; who had often
heard him make many godly Sermons; he condemned all Hypocrites as the worst of
People; whereupon they stocked his tongue. Upon the Stage he never changed
Countenance, nor was at all daunted: when they all came to the Stake, they had
their Tongues loosed, and were commanded to say their Creed, which they did
carefully: when they came to those words, the Holy Catholic Church, they were
commanded to add, of Rome, but that they all refused; whereupon their Necks
were broken in a trice, and then 'twas noised abroad, that they added those
words and died, confessing the Church of Rome, A Church in Sivil.
to be the true Catholic Church.

There was in Sivil a Private Congregation of Gods People, most of which the
Inquisitors consumed in the Fire, as they could discover any of them: amongst
others that were apprehended, they took four women, famous above the rest, for
their Holy and Godly Conversation, but especially the youngest of them, who was
not above one and twenty years old; who by her diligent and frequent reading of
the Scriptures, and by conference with Godly and learned Men, had attained to a
very great measure of knowledge, so that whilst she was in Prison, she
non-pluss'd and put to shame many of those Friars that came to seduce her.

Another of these Women was a Grave Matron, whose House was a School of Virtue;
and a place where the Saints used to meet and serve God day and night: Some of
them cast into Prison.
But the time being come wherein they were ripe for God, they together with
other of their Neighbors were apprehended and cast into Prison; where they
were kept in dark Dungeons, and forced to endure all the cruel and extreme
torments before mentioned; at last they were condemned, and brought forth to
the Scaffold amongst other Prisoners: The young Maid especially came with a
merry and cheerful Countenance, as it were triumphing over the Inquisitors, A
Cleft-Stick.
and having her tongue at liberty, she began to sing Psalms to God, whereupon
the Inquisitors caused her tongue to be nipped, by setting a Burnacle upon it:
after Sentence was read, they were carried to the place of Execution; Their
death
where with much Constancy and Courage they ended their Lives; yet the
Inquisitors not satisfied herewith, caused the House of the Matron (where the
Church used to meet) to be pulled down, Their Malice.
and the ground to be laid wast, and a Pillar to be erected upon it, with an
Inscription showing the cause.

There was also apprehended another worthy Member of the same Congregation,
Ferdinando
called Ferdinando, he was of a Fervent Spirit, and very zealous in doing good;
a young Man, but for his integrity of Life very famous: he had spent 8 years in
educating of Youth, and had endeavored to sow the Seed of Piety in the hearts
of his Scholars, as much as lay in him to do in a time of so great Persecution,
and Tyranny; being at last apprehended for a Lutheran, he was cast into prison
and terribly tormented upon the Gibbet, His Torments.
and in the Trough, whereby he was so shaken in every joint, that when he was
taken down, he was not able to move any part of his Body; yet did those cruel
Tormentors drag him by the Heels into his prison, as if he had been a dead Dog;
but notwithstanding all his torments he answered the Inquisitors very stoutly,
and would not yield to them one jot. During his Imprisonment, God used him as
an Instrument, to recall and confirm a Monk, A fpecial Providence.
who had been cast into Prison for confessing the Gospel openly: But by means
of the Inquisitors Flatteries and fair Promises, he had somewhat relented: Gods
providence so ordering it, that Ferdinando was cast into the same Prison, and
finding the Monk wavering, he rebuked him sharply; Humane Infermity.
and afterward having drawn him to a sight of, and sorrow for his sin, he at
last strengthened him in the promise of Free Grace and Mercy. Herereupon the
Monk desired a day of hearing, where before the Inquisitors he solemnly
renounced his recantation, desiring that his former Confession might stand,
whereupon a Sentence of Death passed upon them both; Recovery.
after which the Inquisitors asked Ferdinando, whether he would revolt from his
former Heresies? To which he answered, that he had professed nothing but what
was agreeable to the pure and perfect word of God, and ought to be professed of
every Christian-Man, and therefore he would stick to it to his death; then they
did clap a Barnacle upon his Tongue, and so they were burned together.
Execution.


There was also one Juliano called the little, Juliano.
because he was of a small and weak Body; who going into Germany, was there
conversant with diverse learned and godly men, by which means he attained to the
knowledge of the truth, and became a zealous Professor of it, and earnestly
longing after the salvation of his Countrymen, Zeal.
he undertook a very dangerous work, wihch was to convey two great dry Fats,
full of Bibles, printed in Spanish into his own Country: In the attempt he had
much cause of fear, the Inquisitors had so stopped every Port, and kept such
strict Watch to prevent the coming in of all such Commodities; but through Gods
mighty Protection, A special Providence.
he brought his burden safely thither, and which was also miraculous, he
conveyed them safe into Sivil, notwithstanding the busy Searchers, and
Catchpoles that watched in every corner; these Bibles being dispersed, were
most joyfully and thankfully received; and through Gods Blessing wrought
wonderfully amongst Gods people to ripen them against the time of Harvest: But
at last the matter broke out by the means of a false Brother, who going to the
Inquisitors played the Judas, and betrayed the whole Church to them, A false
Brother.
so that there were taken at Sivil at one time, eight hundred Christians,
whereof twenty of them were afterward roasted at one fire. 20 Roasted.


Amongst these, this Juliano was one of the first that was apprehended and sent
to prison, where he lay without any company, laden with Irons above three
years, yet was his constancy so great and wonderful, that the Tormentors
themselves were sooner wearied in inflicting, than he in suffering Torments;
and notwithstanding his weak and wearyish Body, yet he remained undanted in
mind in the undergoing of all their Tyrannies, so that he departed from the
Rack less dejected than he came to it; neither threatenings, nor pains, nor
torments made him shrink or yield one jot to them; but when he was drawn back
to his prison, he would tell his Fellows how he had conquered and confounded
his Enemies, saying they depart vanquished; the Wolves fly with shame, they
fly with shame.

In the Day of their Triumph, when he was brought out apparelled (with his
other Fellow Prisoners) in all their shameful Habits, he exhorted them with a
cheerful countenance, saying, My Brethren, be of good Cheer, this is the hour
wherein we must be faithful Witnesses unto God and his Truth before men, as
becomes the true servants and Soldiers of Jesus Christ, and ere long we shall
have him to witness with us again; and within a few hours we shall Triumph with
him in Heaven for ever; but hereupon they presently clapped a Barnacle upon his
Tongue, that he should speak no more, and so he was led to his Execution; but
though he could not speak, yet by his Countenance and Gestures, His Death.
he showed his cheerful and quiet mind; then kneeling down, he kissed the Step
whereon he stood, and being tied to the Stake, he endeavored by his Looks and
Gestures to encourage his fellow-Martyrs in their Sufferings, and so they
quietly and patiently resigned up their Spirits unto God.

There was also one John Leon, John Leon.
a Tailor by trade, who out of a blind Deovotion to serve God, resolved to
enter into a Monastery; but by Gods Providence it so fell out that he entered
into a Cloister at Sivil, wherein most of the Monks were well affected to the
true Religion, amongst whom in two or three years space he was so grounded in
the Principles of Religion, that he resolved to leave that kind of Life, which
accordingly he did, and went into the Country; yet after a time, he had a
great mind to confer with his former Schoolmasters; but when he came back to
the Cloister, he found that they were all fled into Germany; hereupon he
resolved to follow them, and through many Dangers and Perils it pleased God at
last, after a long and tedious Journey, to bring him safe to Frankford, where
he met with some of his old Acquaintance, and with them he traveled to Geneva,
about which time Queen Mary suddenly dying, and Queen Elizabeth of Blessed
Memory, succeeding her, the English Exiles who lived in those parts, were
called home; whereupon diverse Spaniards that sojourned at Geneva, thinking
England a fitter place for their Congregation, resolved to acompany the
Englishmen, and for this end they dispersed themselves into several Companies,
that they might travel with the more safety. The Inquisitors took the departure
of these Monks so ill, that not sparing any cost, they sent Flies abroad to
apprehend them, who waylaid them, especially at Colen, Francfort, Antwerp, and
in all the ways that led from Geneva: This John Leon had gotten him a Companion,
with whom he traveled toward England, Leon goes toward England.
who being discovered at Argentine, were dogged into Zealand, and as they were
ready to take Ship, they were apprehended. Is apprehended.
John Leon took his arrest very composedly, never changing countenance at it:
they were presently carried back into the Town, where they were miserably
racked to discover their Fellows, and not long after were shipped for Spain;
sent to Spain.
having great Irons wrought like a Net that covered both head and feet, within
which also was another piece of Iron made like a tongue, which being thrust
into their mouths took away their speech; they were also laden with other
Engines and Fetters of Iron, wherewith they were bound hand and foot, and in
these continual pains and torments they lay a Shipboard till they came into
Spain, and then John Leon was sent to Sivil, and his Companion to Validolid,
where afterward in defense of the truth he suffered Martyrdom; but John
remained long in prison, where he tasted of the Inquisitors Tyranny, suffering
both hunger and cold, Tormented.
and enduring all their torments one after another, and at last was brought out
in their solemn show, arraied after the usual manner: It was a sad sight to see
such a Ghost as he was; his Hair so grown, his Body so lean, that he had
nothing but Skin and Bones left on him, and his pain much increased by having a
Barnacle upon his Tongue. After Sentence of Death pronounced upon him, they set
his Tongue at liberty, hoping that he would have recanted, but he made a stout
and godly confession of his Faith, and so quietly ended his Life in the flames.
Martyred.


There was also burned at the same time a Godly Virgin, that had formerly been
a Nun, but being through Gods Grace converted, she left her Cloister, and
joined her self to the Church of Christ; being apprehended by the Inquisitors,
she was treated as others had been before her; and at last was brought on the
Scaffold, A Maids Sufferings.
where wirh Manly Courage she put the Inquisitors to a foul Foil; Martyrdom.
not only constantly affirming the Truth; but sharply rebuking those Fathers,
calling them Dumb Dogs, a Generation of Vipers, etc. Being brought to the
stake, with a cheerful Countenance she underwent the pains of Death, and so
quietly slept in the Lord.

There was also one Christopher Losada, Christopher Losada.
a Physician, a Learned Man and very well studied in the Scriptures; as also of
a very holy Conversation, insomuch as he was chosen Superintendent of the
Church of Christ in Sivil, which at this time was very great, though dispersed
into Corners. At last he was apprehended by the Inquisitors, before whom he had
made good Confession of his Faith, for which he endured hard and sharp
Imprisonment with most cruel Torments, and the open Infamy of their solemn
Show: And lastly was adjudged to the Fire. As he stood at the stake, the
Barnacle being taken from his Tongue, hd disputed notably with some Monks that
came to seduce him; and when they spoke Latin, that the Common People might
not understand them; Losada also began to speak in Latin so copiously and
eloquently, His Constancy.
as was strange to hear that he should have his wits so fresh when he was ready
to be burned, His Death.
after which he patiently resigned up his spirit to God in the Fire.

There was also in Sivil one Arias, Arias.
a man of a sharp wit, and well studied in Divinity, but withal of a Crafty
Wit and Inconstant Nature, which Vices he yet covered with a Cloak of Religion;
whereby he deceived many. About this time there were also in this City two
sorts of Preachers, and both had a great number of Auditors; the one taught
School Divinity, and were continually calling upon their Hearers to often
Fastings, Mortification, Self-denial, Frequency of Prayer, Humility, etc. But
themselves practiced nothing less than these things: And indeed all their
Religion consisted in Words and Bodily Exercises, as running to Masses,
Hallowed Places, Shrift, etc. The other sort dealt more sincerely with the Holy
Scriptures, out of which they declared what was true Righteousness and perfect
Holiness; By means whereof that City above all others in Spain, bore the name
for just and true Dealing, and it pleased God that the brightness of this Light
did discover all the Counterfeit Holiness, and Pharisaical Devotion of the
other Party: The chief Laborers in this Harvest, were Constantine, Aegidius,
and Varguius, all Doctors, and sober, wise and learned Men, who by this kind of
Preaching procured to themselves many Enemies, but above all others, Arias was
the most spightful and malicious, yet he carried it so cunningly that he still
kept up his Reputation with these men, but it was not long before he discovered
himself, and that upon this occasion. There was one Ruzius, a Learned Man,
questioned before the Inquisitors for something that he delivered in a Sermon
about the Controversies in Religion; the Inquisitors appointed him a day of
hearing; and two or three days before, Arias met him, saluted him courteously,
and discoursed familiarly with him: then did he pump out of him all those
Arguments wherewith he intended to defend himself before the Inquisitors. When
the day came, and Ruzius appeared, Arias went on that side where his Opponents
were, which much amazed Ruzius, and in the Disputation, Arias being prepared,
did so wittily enervate all his Arguments, that Ruzius had nothing to say for
himself, and so was fain to yield the Cause, and Arias went away with the
Honor of the Field, though he got it by Treachery. Yet did this Arias, being
of St. Isidores's Monastery, Preach so practically, that a great Light began to
dawn in that dark place; for the whole Scope of his Sermons was to overthrow
their Profession; he taught them, that singing and saying of heir Prayers night
and day was no Service of God, that the Holy Scriptures were to be read and
studied with diligence, whence alone the true Service of God could be drawn,
and which alone tells us the true obedience to his will, to the obtaining
whereof we must use Prayer as a Means, proceeding as well from a sense and
feeling of our own Infirmities, as grounded upon a perfect trust and confidence
in God.

By laying these Foundations, through Gods Blessing, he began to make them out
of Love with their Monkish Superstition, and much provoked them to the study of
the Holy Scriptures; besides also his Sermons, he read daily a Lecture upon
Solomon's Proverbs very learnedly, and made application thereof with good
Judgment and Discretion; also in private conference he did much good: the Lord
also so ordered it in his wisdom, that he met with Scholars that were very
tractable, such as were not greatly wedded to their Superstitions. And such was
the force and might of Gods Election, that these few good Seeds so fructified,
that in the end they brought forth a great increase of Godliness; for diverse of
the Monks that hereby had their Consciences awakened and cleared, to see their
former Hypocrisy and Idolatry, sought out for further Instruction, and through
Gods mercy, they light upon those Preachers which taught the truth with more
sincerity, of whom they learned the Principles of pure and perfect Religion, so
that by degrees they left that evil Opinion which they had formerly conceived
against the Lutherans, and were desirous to read their Books: and God
miraculously provided for them, they had all sorts of Books brought them, that
were extant at that time, either in Geneva or Germany, whereby it came to pass,
that there were very few in all that Cloister, but they had some taste of true
Religion and Godliness; so that instead of mumbling their Mattens, they brought
in Divinity-Lectures, and Vain Fasting was turned into Christian Sobriety;
neither were any taught to be Monkish, but to be sincerely and truly religious.

But considering, that when this should be once known, they could not live in
any safety, they resolved among themselves, to forsake their Nest, and to fly
into Germany, where they might enjoy more safety of their Lives, and freedom of
their Consciences; but how to get thither, was all the difficulty; if one or
two should go first, the rest would be exposed to danger; if many should go
together, a thousand to one but they would be taken again, being to travel from
the furthest part of Spain into Germany: yet upon Debate they concluded that
they must all either speedily depart, or shortly be apprehended by the
Inquisitors, who now had got some inckling of the matter; and God seeing them
in this Distress, showed them a means how, under an honest pretense, a dozen of
them might depart together within a Month, and each of them betake himself a
several way to Geneva, where they appointed, by Gods assistance, all to meet
within a Twelvemonth: the rest, which were but young Novices, were left
behind; who yet not long after were so strengthened by God, that they endured
the Brunt of Persecution when it came, three of them being burned, and diverse
others diversely punished.

The aforementioned Servants of Jesus Christ forsook that place where they
lived in honor, ease, and plenty; and by undertaking for Christ's sake a
voluntary Exile, exposed themselves to Shame, Ignominy, Wants, yea, and were in
continual danger of their Lives also. And under God Arias was a great means of
this, who by his Ministry had first enlightened them with the Knowledge of the
Truth; for which he was often complained of to the Inquisitors, and was
convented before them; where he so cunningly answered the Matter, that he was
still discharged: but this last Apprehension (through the Mercy of God) brought
forth in him the Fruits of true Repentance; Arias his Recovery.
for he did so deeply and unfeignedly bewail and repent of his former
withholding of the Truth in unrighteousness, that whereas he used to be
exceeding fearful of the Rack, he being brought to it, and upon it, with a
mavelous constancy withstood the enemies of of Gods Truth, and took up the
Inquisitors roundly, withal telling them that he was heartily sorry, His
Courage.
and did most earnestly repent him, for that he had wittingly and willingly in
their presence impugned the Truth, against the godly Defenders of the same;
many other sharp Rebukes he gave to the Inquisitors so often as he came to his
Answer: But at last he was brought forth arrayed in their accustomed manner,
upon their Day of Triumph; at which time, he also made a notable Profession of
his Faith, and so was led from the Stage to the Stake with a merry and cheerful
countenance, where, by the notable Example of his Repentance at his Death, he
made satisfaction to the Church of Christ for all his former unfaithful and
hypocritical dealing with it; and so quietly slept in the Lord.

And thus you see what has been the Lot and Portion of the Church and People
of God, viz. That through many Tribulations they should enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven. Here you have a certain and infallible Mark of the true Church of
Christ, viz. To be hated and persecuted by the Devil and his Instruments.
Herein, as in a Perspective, you may look back upon the persecution of the
Church of Christ, by reason of that cruel Spanish Inquisition.

Upon the whole, let us consider, if that Religion should be set up amongst us,
which allows of such Cruelty and Tyranny, whether or no we have not cause to
fear the worst, and to prepare for it. Forewarned, Fore-armed.

APPENDIX.
THe Institution of this Spanish Inquisition at first was not only necessary
(as the condition of affairs then was) but exceeding laudable, had it been kept
within the bounds at first intended; but instead of being used on the Jews and
Moors, it has been turned on the Protestants, and that with such violence and
extremity of Torture, that it is counted the greatest Tyranny, and severest
kind of Persecution under heaven; insomuch that many Papists who would
willingly die for their Religion, abhor the very name and mention of it, and to
the death withstand the bringing in of this Slavery amongst them; this was it
which caused the irremediable Revolt of the Low Countries; the greatest part of
that Nation, at the time of their taking Arms, being Roman Catholics; yet it
is planted and established in Spain and all Italy (Naples and Venice excepted)
the management thereof committed to the most zealous and rigorous Friars in the
whole Pack; the least suspicion of Heresy, (as they call it) Affinity or
Commerce with Heretics, reproving the Lives of the Clergy, keeping any Books
or Editions of Books prohibited, or discoursing in matters of Religion, are
Offenses sufficient; nay they will charge Men's Consciences under the pains of
Damnation, to detect their nearest and dearest Friends, if they do but suspect
them to be herein culpabl. Their proceedings are with great secrecy and
severity; for, 1. The parties accused shall never know their Accuser, but shall
be constrained to reveal their own thoughts and affections. 2. If they be but
convinced of any Error in any of their Opinions, or be gainsayed by two
Witnesses, they are immediately condemned. 3. If nothing can be proved against
them, yet shall they with infinite tortures and miseries be kept in the house
diverse years, for a terror unto others. And lastly, If they escape the first
Brunt with many torments and much anguish, yet the second Question or Suspicion
brings Death remediless. And as for torments and kinds of Death, Phalaris and
his Fellow-Tyrants came far short of these Bloodhounds.

The Administration of this Office, for the more orderly regulation and
dispatch thereof, is distributed into 12 Courts or Supreme Tribunals for the
several Provinces of Spain, no one depending upon another, but in sort
subordinate to the General Inquisition, remaining in the Court near the King's
Person, which has a kind of Superintendency over those Tribunals. In all
which, those of the Secular Clergy sit as Judges, the Friars being only used as
Promoters, to inform the Court, and bring more Grist unto the Mill of these
Inquisitors: every one has the title of Lord, and are a great terror to the
Neigbouring Peasants; certain it is, that by this means the people of this
Kingdom are so kept under, that they dare not hearken after any other Religion
than what their Priests and Friars shall be pleased to teach them; or entertain
the Truth, if it comes amongst them, or call in question any of those palpable
and gross Impostures which every day are put upon them: for by this means the
People of this Kingdom have been, and still are, punctual Followers of the
Church of Rome; and that too in the very errors and corruptions of it, taking
up their Religion on the Popes Authority, and therein so tenacious or
pertinacious, that the King does suffer none to live in his Dominions which
profess not the Roman Catholic Religion; of which they have been, since the
time of Luther, such avowed Patrons, that one of the late Popes being sick, and
hearing diverse men to bemoan his approaching end, uttered some words to this
effect; My Life, said he, can nothing benefit the Church, but pray for the
Prosperity of the King of Spain, as its chief Supporter. And thus you have the
Original of the Inquisition.
