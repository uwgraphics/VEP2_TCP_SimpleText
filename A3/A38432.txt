NOble Hearted English Boys,
Fill the air with music noise,
James the Fountain of our joys,
the Nations Sole Defender,
He Is the MONARCH of the Land,
We Will obey his Great Command,
It Is but Duty, heart and hand,
when we do all Surrender.
May the Nation now obey
James who does the Scepter sway,
Let his power never decay,
but ever be increased:
Now the Storm is over-blown,
Royal James enjoys his own,
In the Glory of his Throne,
since CHARLES the great's deceased.
If occasion serves we will fight,
In the Field with armor bright,
To maintain Great Jameses Right,
most Royally descended:
Britain from Sedition wean,
Since the famous Sight was seen,
Of our Gracious King and Queen,
most Nobly attended.
Now the Bells of London Ring,
Whiggs be wise, obey your King,
While the Loyal-hearted Sing,
and banish all vexation:
That our joys may more abound,
Let the glass go freely round,
Since our King and Queen is Crowned,
the glory of the Nation.
Now let all united be,
In the Band of Loyalty:
To great James and Queen Mary,
alas why should we sever:
May they with the Royal Crown,
Flourish here in high Renown,
Many Blessings now power down,
upon them both for ever.
Loyal hearts both rich and poor,
Now our Gracious Prince adore,
Drink his Health Boys ten times over,
in Clarret, Sack, and Sherry:
As for Gold and such like wealth,
We will spend that Oram pel^,
For to Drink a Loyal Health,
to Gracious good Queen MARY.
From the Palace all along,
Guinneys Subjects gave ding dong,
That they might the Windows throng,
up to the highest Story:
Every place which they did build,
With Beholders then they filled,
Many hundreds there beheld
the KING in all his Glory.
Now let Subjects hearts incline,
To the Race and Royal Line,
Since the Heaven so Divine,
and reason us engages,
Let it be the Subjects Prayer,
That our Gracious Queen may bear,
To Great James a Princely Heir,
to Reign in after Ages.
Printed for J. Deacon, at the Angel in Guiltspur-Street, without Newgate. 1685.
