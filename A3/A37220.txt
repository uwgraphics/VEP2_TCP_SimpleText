BON ACCORD



Unto the Right Honorable GILBERT GRAY Lord Provest. ROBERT FORBES Bailie
ALEXANDER ALEXANDER Bailie JOHN BURNET Bailie THOMAS MITCHELL Bailie WALTER
ROBERTSON Dean of Gild, ROBERT SKENE Treasurer, And to the rest of the
Honorable Counsel of the City of ABERDENE.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
A few years ago, that I might approve my self no less an observant Citizen,
then a provident Parent, being invited by the desires of some, allured by the
kindness of others, and encouraged by the expectation and good hopes of the
usefulness of the thing it self to the Place; I did lay down my Firstborn as a
fondling, at the feet of Your Honorable Bench; solemnly engaging, that as it
received its being from BON-ACCORD, and its growth from Your Goodness, so it
should period its stature with Your Pleasure. This Promise has pressed me,
that my Press might always bear the Impress of Your Virtues; and express
(though in a small type) my thankfulness, according to the laudable custom of
Votaries in all Ages, after a few years growth, to represent the same to Your
Sanctuary, that it may be confirmed in Your favor. For that I may confess
ingenuously when I looked deliberatly on this my first Mephibosheth, I offered
the same as an object of pity, being so mank and maim in its chiefest parts,
like a pitiful Emblem of Orpheus teared by the Thracian women, its vigor
seemed to wither, its tender hands to dry up, and whole body to vanish in a
consumption; had I not called a Tymous Counsel of the most Expert in this
Place, who diligently turning over their old Records, and rifling the labors of
their Ancestors, unanimously and so cheerfully did contribute all their pains,
that now being fred of all the noxious humors that were preying on its vitals,
its wants are made up, defects supplied, its dried hands received moisture, and
strength diffused so through the whole limbs, that it dare show it self to the
Public on its own legs, if Your Wisdoms command; yea, run to the Schools to
warble the Anthems of Your Liberality. Seeing it is natural to children to lisp
out first their Parents names, why should it be singular? If it did so when on
the Nurse breasts, why not in the flower and prime of its youth? Though it be
silent, it has a voice, and could sing its own pedegrie, and the fruitfulness
of its Mother Science; yea, with Strabo, Pindarus, Plutarch, Aristotle, and all
Antiquity demonstrate, how much brutes, as well as men, are born obsequious
subjects to this Queen, whose charming Melody was only able to enchant
Barbaritie, civilize Savages, secure Societies, and so give matter to the
significant Apologues of Amphion, Linus, Orpheus, and the building of the
Theban walls, were it not the fear of being tedious, it would not be afraid to
assert with Divine Plato, and his Followers; that the Heavenly Soul by which
the Universe is animate, does owe its Origin to this Lady; and narrate how much
the great Solon, that Sun of Greece, bestowed on his Nephew, for teaching him
one Saphick Tune: and how much pains the wise Socrates, though full of years,
did greedily bestow upon the Lute; and how much that greatest Captain, and
Magistrate of Athens Themistocles, after he had accomplished himself in all
Virtue, and most of Arts, was dashed with the sharp Sarcasme of a fellow
Magistrate: How can he keep men in Harmony, and people in Concord, who has not
learned as yet to tune a Citeron? It were no difficulty to show how much the
Ancients used this Science, as a remedy and amulet against all Fascinations: as
the Harp of David, to alley the fury of Saul; and the greatest auxiliarie also
in time of Battle, so that the famous Stratonicus did discern the courage of
his Soldiers, by the musical and saliant motion of their Bodies; and
therefore, bearing a Citeron in his Ensign, did add this motto, Adversus male
canentes Cythera; as if none deserved Victory and Triumph but Musicians.

And now, seeing it has pleased Providence in Your Wisdoms Persons, to bless
the Bench of BON-ACCORD with such an Harmonious Consort, of as many Musicians
as Magistrates, that all under Your Magistracy may descant on Your Labors, and
Posterity sing Your Praises to coming Ages: Admit this Poor Present to Your
Acceptance; its Breath and Being depends on Your Brow, being willing to receive
its Sentence from the same, whether it shall be smothered in the Birth, or view
the Public under Your Patrocinie: However, that the best Blessings and
Out-bearing of the ALMIGHTY, may accompany Your Wisdoms in all Your Honorable
Designs, Shall be the daily Prayer of

YOUR HONORS Own Servant, John Forbes.

An Exposition of the Gam, and Cliefs.
FOR the understanding of this foregoing Scale, you must begin at the lowest
word, Gam-ut, and so go upwards to the end, still ascending.

Then ye must get it perfectly without book, to say it forewards and backwards.
Secondly, you must learn to know the parts of it, and wherein every key
stands; that is, whether in Rule, or in Space. Thirdly, how many Cliess, and
how many Notes every key contains. And lastly, the properties of the Gam.

Q. How many parts is in the Gam?

A. Two.

Q. Which (...)?

A. Bass and Alt.

Q. Which is Bass, and which is Alt?

A. All from Gam-ut, to C-sol-fa-ut, is Bass; and all from C-sol-fa-ut, to
E-la, is Alt.

Q. C-sol-fa-ut, whether is it Bass, or Alt?

A. It is neither Bass nor Alt, but betwixt the two.

Q. What call you a Clief, and what a Note?

A. A Clief is a character set on a Rule at the beginning of a verse, showing
the height and lowness of every Note standing on the same Verse, or in space
(although use has taken it for a general rule, never to let any Clief in the
Space, except the Clief) and every Space, or Rule, not having a Clief set in
it, has one understood, being only omitted for not pestering the Verse, and
saving of labor to the writer: but here it is taken for a letter beginning the
name of every Key, and are they which you see on the Scale set at the beginning
of every word.

Q. How many Cliefs has every Key?

A. Every Key has but one Clief, except -fa-^-rul, which has two Cliefs.

Q. How many Cliefs are there?

A. There be in all seven Cliefs, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, but in use in singing
there be but four; that is to say, the F-fa-ut Clief, which is commonly in the
Bass, or lowest part, being formed or made thus *

The C-sol-fa-ut Clief, which is common to every part, and is made thus *.

The G-sol-re-ut Clief in Alt, which is commonly used in the Treble, or highest
part, and is made thus G. And the B Clief which is common to every part, and is
made thus, or thus. The one signifying the half Note, or flat singing, the
other the whole Note, or sharp singing.

Q. How many Notes is there in Music?

A. There are but six Notes, which are called, and are commonly set down thus,
^ ut re mi fa sol la

For the better understanding of this, you shall observe the C-sol-fa-ut Clief
standing on the fourth Rule from beneath, then you must reckon down from the
Clief, as though the Verse were the Scale of the Gam, assigning to every Scale
and Rule a several Key; and you shall find that the first Note stands in
C-fa-ut, and the last in A-la-mi-re in Bass.

Another Example.

^ ut re mi fa sol la la sol fa mi re ut

Q In how many several Keys may you begin the six Notes?

A. These three Keys of the following Example. ^

But what is done in these Notes may be also done in their Octoes; as what is
done in ^am-ut, may also be done in G-sol-re-ut in Bass, and likewise in
G-sol-re-ut in Alt. And what in C-fa-ut, may be also in C^ sol-fa-ut, and in
C-sol-fa. And what in F-fa-ut in Bass, may also be done in F-fa-ut in Alt. But
these be the three principal Keys containing the three nature^ or properties of
singing.

Q. How many Keys is in the Gam?

A. Twenty: ten in Rule, and ten in Space.

Q How many Notes are in these twenty Keys?

A. Two and forty Notes; viz. seven Uts, seven Re's, seven Mi's, seven Fa's,
seven Sol's, and seven La's.

Q. Which are the three properties of Music?

A. B-quare, Properchant, and B-mole.

Q. How many of these Vts sings B-quare, how many Properchant, and how many
B-mole?

A. Three B-quare, two Properchant, and two B-mole.

Q. Which are the three uts that sings B-quare.

A. The ut of Gam-ut, the ut of G-sol-re-ut in Bass, and the ut of G-sol-re-ut
in Alt.

Q. Which are the two uts that sings Properchant?

A. The ut of C-fa-ut, and the ut of C-sol-fa ut.

Q. Which are the two uts that sings B-mole?

A. The ut of F fa ut in Bass, and the ut of ^-fa ut in Alt.

Q. You have spoke of the uts, but how does the other Notes sing?

A. As every ut sings, so does the rest of the Notes likewise sing which
ascends from that ut. As for example, the ut of Gam-ut sings B quare,
therefore the re of ^-re, the mi of ^-mi, the fa of C-fa-ut, etc. does sing
likewise B-quare. Likewise the ut of C-fa-ut sings Properchant, therefore the
re of D-sol-re* the mi of ^-la-mi, the fa of F-fa-ut, and the sol of
G-sol-re-ut, etc. sings likewise Prop^rchant: and the ut of F-fa-ut sings
B-mole, therefore the re of G-sol-re-ut, the mi of A-la-mi-re, the fa of
B-fa-^-mi, must likewise sing B-mole; because the Notes does arise from these
uts, as you may plainly see on the Scale: and so forth of the rest.

Example. ^

THE FIRST SONG.
^ IF care does cause men cry, Why do I not complain? If every ^ wight bewails
his woe, Why do I not the same?

Since that amongst them all,
I dare well say is none
So far from joy, so full of woe,
Nor has more cause to mourn.
For all things living has
Sometime a quiet rest;
The drawing Ox, the bearing Ass,
And every other beast.
The Peisand and the Post,
Which are at all assayes,
The Ship-boy and the Galey slave,
Has time to take their ease.
Save I, poor wretch, whom care
Dath so me now constrain,
To wail the day, and weep the night,
Continually in pain.
From painfulness to pain,
From pain to bitter tears,
From tears to painful pain again,
And so my life it wears.
Each thing under the Sun,
That I can hear or see,
It makes me to bewail my woe,
And cruel destiny.
When I see men rejoice,
Seeing I cannot so,
I take more pleasure in my pain,
It doubles but my woe.
Or when I see men have
Their most desired sight,
Alace! I think all men are well,
Save I, poor woeful wight.
Or when I hear the sound
Of Song or Instrument,
I think all thing that joyful is,
Does cause me to lament.
Even as the stricken Dee^
Withdraws himself alone,
So seek I then some secret place,
Where I may make my moan.
Although that for the time
Does much appease my grief;
Yet does it breed me further pain,
To cause me more mischief.
THE SECOND PART.
SInce that amongst them all,
I dare well say is none
More grievous sinner nor I am,
And has more cause to moan.
My youthful years misspent
In health and ignorance;
Not caring how I spent my time,
In sloth and negligence.
Even like a wandering sheep,
Long have I gone astray:
Lord, bring me to thy flock again,
And guide me the right way.
Grant me thy grace to rise,
And stand in time to come,
That I may mend my wretched life,
And mourn for time by-run.
Call me not to accounts
Of former faults misdone:
But let my Saviors bloody wounds,
Be ransom for my sin.
In mercy, Lord, my God,
Receive me home to thee;
That I may walk in thy true ^ear,
And praise thy Name truly.
Relieve my burden great
Of sin and worldly care;
That I may in thy Sanctuary
Sing praises everm ^ir.

^ O Lusty May with Flora Queen, The balmy drops from Phoebus sheen, ^ Prelusant
beams before the day, before the day, the day. By thee Diana grows ^ green,

Sends sorth their notes, and makes great mirth,
On banks that blooms on every bray, etc.

^ INto a mirthful May morning, As Phoebus did upspring, I saw a May ^ both fair

First therefore when I did you know,

Wherefore, I pray, have mind on me,
True Love, where ever you be:
Where ever I go, both too and fro,
You have my heart alright.
O Lady! fair of hew,
I me commend to you,
Both the day and night.
Since Fortune false, unkind, untrue,
Has exyl'd me from you;
By sudden chance I shall advance
Your honor and your fame.
Above all earthly wight,
To you my truth I plight,
In earnest, or gain.

THE IV. SONG.

paramours. Said she, My Love so sweet, come you not ^ yet, nor yet; Heght you

lusty Love, Elore, Lo.

So lost is mine intents, and gone's the time.
Elore, Elore, Elore, Elore.
I love my lusty Love, Elore, Lo.
Danger my dead is, ^alse fortune my ^eed is,
And languor my leed is: but hope, I despair.
Disdain my desire is, so strangeness my fear is:
Deceit out of all ware. Adieu, I fare.
Elore, Elore, etc.
Then to my Lady blyth, did I my presence kyth;
Saying, My Bird, be glad: am I not yours?
So in my arms two, did I the lusty jo;
And kissed her times mo, then night has hours.
Elore, Elore, etc.
Live in hope, Lady fair, and repel all despair:
Trust not that your true Love shall you betray.
When deceit and langor, banished is from your bowr*
I Will be your paramour, and shall you please.
Elore, Elore, etc.
Favor and duty, unto your bright beauty,
Confirmed has lawty, obliedg'd to truth:
So that your soverance, heartly but variance,
Mark in your memorance, mercy and ruth.
Elore, Elore, etc.
Yet for your courtesy, banish all jealousy:
Love for love lustily, do me restore:
Then with us Lovers young, true love shall rest and reign:
Solace shall sweetly sing for evermore,
Elore, Elore, Elore, Elore.
I love my lusty Love, Elore, Lo.

THE V. SONG.
^ WHen as the Greeks did enterprise, To Troyes town in arms to go, they
choosed a counsel sage and wise, Apollos answer for to know, ^ How they should
speed and have success, In that so great a business.

Then did they send the wisest Greeks,
Apollos answer for to know,
Who with the tears upon their cheeks,
But and the fiery flames of wood,
With all such rites as was the guise,
They did their great God sacrifice.
When they had done thus their request,
And solemnly their service ^lone,
And drank the wine, and slew the beast,
Apollo gave them answer soon:
That Troy and Troyans have they should,
To use them fully as they would
Which answer made them not so glad,
That they should thus victorious be,
As even the answer which I had,
Did also joy and comfort me*
For thus then said Apollo mine,
All that thou seeks, it shall be thine.
FINIS.
THE VI. SONG.
^ YOu Lovers all that love would prove, Come learn to know true ^ love indeed.
First, love the Lord your God above, From whom ^ all goodness does proceed:
Pray to him faithfully, To grant his Sp'rit to ^ thee, Thy sins to mortify,
And that with speed.

Als love thy neighbor heartfully,
Wishing his welfare night and day:
Dealing with all then faithfully,
As to thy self thou would always*
Beseech the Lord of might,
His Sp'rit to guide thee right*
His precepts day and night,
For to obey.
Since that the time is here but short,
That we in earth are to endure;
Rejoice in God and have comfort,
In Christ his Son that boght us dear.
Pray to the Trinity,
One God, and Person^ three,
To serve him faithfully,
With heart intiere.
The sacrifice of laud and praise,
Sing to the Lord both day and night:
With thanksgiving to him always,
For all his benefits so bright.
Thy time in virtue spend:
Remember on thy end;
See thou thy life amend,
With all thy might.
Then shall thou at the latter day,
When Christ thee to account shall call,
Rejoice in God, and not affray
For fear of any sudden fall.
Therefore live merrily
In Love and Charity,
Thanking thy God truly,
What may besal.
Now let us all still watch and pray,
Still waiting on that day and hour,
When Christ shall come without delay,
To judge all earthly creature.
Then be prepared therefore,
With lamps and oil in store,
To meet that King of glore,
That comes for ay.
FINIS.
THE VII. SONG.
^ ^THe thoghts of men do daily change As fantasy breeds in their breasts, And
now their nature is so strange, That few can find where friendship rests: ^ For
double dealing bears such sway, That honest meaning, that honest meaning ^ does
decay.

The steadfast says that friends professed,
Is fred from them, and seldom used:
He who a faithful friend pro^est,
Does make his friendship now abused.
Where one is found a friend indeed,
A score there be, a score there be, that fail at need.
For barren trees will bloom right fair,
As well as those that fruit will yield,
Whose bark and branches seems as fair,
As any tree within the field.
As simple looks the subtle man,
As he that no, as he that no, kind falsehood can.
A friend of words where deeds be dead,
Is like a spring that water wants:
And he that with fair words is fed.
Does hope for fruit of withered plants:
But who can judge by hew of eye,
Since deeds are dead, since deeds are dead, where truth should be.
The fairest way that I can find,
Is first to try, and then to trust*
So shall affections not be blind:
For proof will soon spy out the just:
And trial kn^ws who means deceit.
And bids us be, and bids us be ware of their bait.
Without good proof be not too bold,
If thou my counsel list to take:
In painting words there is no hold,
They be but leave, that wind do shake:
But where that words and deeds agree,
Accept that friend, accept that friend, and credit me.

THE VIII. SONG.
^ WHen chyle cold age shall cease upon thy blood, And hoary hairs do ^ show the
winters fall: Thy joints which first in full perfection stood, ^ now sick and
weak* makes thee thou may not crawle. O then, I say, for all thy ^ passed
pleasure, A conscience clear is worth a world of treasure.

When on thy bed in anguish thou do ly,
In some hard fever, striving still for breath:
Thy wife and children then upon thee cry:
Some wishing life, yet most for goods thy death.
O then, I say, for all thy passed pleasure,
A conscience clear is worth a world of treasure.
When ^oul sin shall appear in its own weed,
Shall thy distracted senses so affright,
In recordation of thy former deed;
Nothing thou'st have but dolor for delight.
O then, I say, for all thy passed pleasure,
A conscience clear is worth a world of treasure.

Remember Adams fall, O thou man, O thou man.
Remember Adams fall, from heaven to hell.
Remember Adams fall, how we were condemned all,
In hell perpetual, therein to dwell.
Remember Gods goodness, O thou man, O thou man*
Remember Gods goodness, his promise made.
Remember Gods goodness, how he sent his Son doubtless,
Our sins for to redress: be not afraid.
The Angels all did sing, O thou man, O thou man.
The Angels all did sing, on the shepherds hill.
The Angels all did sing praise to our heavenly King,
And peace to man living, with a good will.
The shepherds amazed wa^, O thou man, O thou man*
The shepherds amazed was, to hear Angels sing.
The shepherds amazed was, how it should come to pass,
That CHRIST our MESSIAH, should be our King.
To Bethlem did they go, O thou man, O thou man.
To Bethlem they did go, the shepherds three.
To Bethlem they did go, to see if it were so or no;
Whether Christ was born or no, to set man free.
As the Angels before did say, O thou man, O thou man.
As the Angels before did say, so it came to pass.
As the Angels before did say, they ^ound a Babe where he lay
In a manger, wrapped in hay, so poor he was.
In Bethlem he was born, O thou man, O thou man.
In Bethlem he was born, for mankinds sake.
In Bethlem he was born, for us that was forlorn,
And therefore took no scorn, our flesh to take.
Give thanks to God always, O thou man, O thou man.
Give thanks to God always, most joyfully.
Give thanks to God always, for this our happy day.
Letall now sing and say, Holy, Holy.

conscience keeps, while he to quiet goes; More venterous is then ^ he that
sleeps with twenty mortal foes.

Wherefore at night call into mind,
how thou the day has spent:
Praying to God, if ought thou find,
and then in time repent.
And since thy bed a pattern is
of death and fatal tears,
Bedwart it shall not be amiss,
this to record in verse.
My bed is like the grave so cold;
and sleep which steeks mine eye,
Resembles death; clothes which me ^old,
declare the mould so dry:
The ^^isking sleas, resembles well
the wringing worm to me,
Which with me in the grave shall dwell,
when I no light shall see.
The mighty bell which I hear knel,
when I am laid in bed,
Most like a bitter trumpet sell,
ever shouting in my head
My rising in the morn likewise,
when sleepy night is past,
Puts me in mind that I must rise
to Judgment at the last.

CHRIST.
Believe my word, and in thy heart imprint
My sufferings for thy sake, and do repent.
Pray to our Father for the Sp'rit of grace:
To mend thy life, God grant thee time and space.
SINNER.
Alace! my foresaid foes full craftily
Does me entise from thy precepts to fly;
And follow pleasures of my flesh and sin,
The which is sweet to pass my time therein.
CHRIST.
O careless man! that sweetness brings no gain,
But in the end eternal woe and pain.
Fly sin therefore, the Sabbath day thou keep:
My Word will draw thee from that sinful sleep.
SINNER.
Alace! my Lord, I fight continually
Against the Devil, the world, and flesh, all three:
So that my wits and senses are grown dumb,
Clogged with worldly things, almost ov'rcome.
CHRIST.
Cast first thy care to conquer heaven above,
Through faith in me, and godly works in love*
Thy Father who does know thy present need,
Will thee supply of worldly things with speed.
SINNER.
Prosperity makes me sometimes misknow:
Adversity makes me despair and low.
Whiles with the one and other am torment,
Which marr^ my mind, and makes me mal-content.
CHRIST.
If riches grow, set not thy heart thereon,
Lest that it make thee like the rich Glutton.
Riches well used, Gods blessing does procure*
If cr^^^ with want, then Lazarus was (...).
SINNER.
Betwixt these two, I crave to stand content,
If so it please my God for to consent:
Praying therefore I seek to please his will,
And be brought home, thy flock and fold until.
CHRIST.
Thou art not able for to run that race,
To please his will, without his Spirit of grace:
Therefore beseech his divine Majesty,
To banish sin, and grant his Sp'rit to thee.
SINNER.
I shall beseech my Lord and God of might,
The Father, Son and Sp'rit, to guide me right,
That I may walk in thy true fear and love,
And at the last attain thy joys above.

If so thou do, thy prayer snal be heard,
And in the heavens for thee a place prepared.
Then serve thy God, and praise his holy Name:
Obey my voice, and still with me remain.

THE XIII. SONG.
^ IF floods of tears could change my follies past, Or smoaks of sighs ^ could
sacrifice for sin: If groaning cries could free my fault at last, ^ Or endless
moa^ for ever pardon win; Then would I weep, sigh, cry, and ever ^ groan, For
follies, faults, faults, for sins and errors done.

I see my hopes are blasted in their bud:
And find men's ^avors are like fading flowrs:
I find too late that words can do no good,
But loss of time, and languishing of hours.
Thus since I see, I sigh, and say therefore,
Hopes, favors, words, begone, begone, beguile no more.
Since man is nothing but a mass of clay,
Our days not else but shadows on the wall:
Trust in the Lord, who lives and lasts for ay;
Whose favor sound will neither fade nor fail.
My God, to thee I resign my mouth and mind:
No trust in youth, in youth, nor faith in age I find.

Then to the Thicket, then to the Thicket

And there by Magid: Art she wrought,
Which in her heart she first had thought,
By secret speed away to flee,
Whilst he a Heart was turned to be.
Thus whilst he viewed Dianas train*

Which Christ is gone for to prepare
For his Elect, and own dear friends;
Where joy remains, and never ends.
Gods Saints shall thither all repair;

Sweet Psalms of praise, sweet Psalms of praise

^ LOw should my feeble body fure, The double dolor that I endure:

^ The mourning and the great malure, cannot define. It does my ^ baleful
breast combu^e, To see another have in cure, that should be mine.

For well I wot was never wight,
That could enforce his mind and might
To love and serve his Lady bright, and want her sine:
As I do mattyr day and night,
Without that only thing of right, that should be mine.
Were I of puissance for to prove
My lowly and my heartly love,
I should her mind to mercy move, with such propine.
Were all the world at my behove,
She should it have at her behove, for to be mine.
Now who^ to shall I make my moan?
For truth nor constancy is none*
For all the faithful love is gone, of feminine.
It would oppress an heart of stone
To see my loss, for her alone that should be mine.
Who shall my dulled spirits raise,
Since not for love my Lady goes?
For if good service might her please, she should incline.
I die in dolor and disease,
And others has her as they please, that should be mine.
I may perceive right well by this,
That all the blythness, joy and bliss,
The lusty wanton life I wish of love, is ^ine.
What remedy since so it is*
But patience, suppose I miss that should be mine.
For Nobles has not ay renown,
Nor G^^^les ay the gayest gown:
They carry victuals to the town that worse does dine.
So busily to busk I bown,
And others bears the berry down, that should be mine.
Who can the rage of youthhood dau^t
Let him to Lovers Court go haunt,
And him as Venus subject grant, and keep her ^^ine;
Perchance he shall find mercy skant*
And able his reward to want, as I do mine.

My salt tears are mingled with bloody sweat,
Pale is my face, and ^aded is my bew,
Of Loves lair, alace! that ever I knew.
I seek remead unto my deadly wound,
As fire in ye, and heat in marble stone:
I find a quadrant in a figure round,
A deaf Sophist a problem to expound;
I seek the truth in heart where there is none:
As who would ^i^h upon the mountains hie,
Or go to gather b^^ries in the sea.
Now is my care through old occasion,
Old is my wound, my pains are very sore;
The more I seek for consolation,
My heaviness increases more and more:
I love, alace! and all my love is lore:
More woe I wish dread never man on eard:
Such is my chance, such is my hapless weard.
I have enough and more for to complain
Of every care that may my dool distress:
How may my tongue or hand express the pain?
Because the truth unable is to guess.
I love, alace! not with those cares expressed,
My deadly ghost: but rather with the dart,
Bereave my life, as thou have done my heart.

^ WHat if a day, or a month, or a year Crown thy delights with a May not the

contentings. Fortune, honor, beauty, youth, Are but blossoms many sad
tormentings. Wanton pleasures, doting love, Are but shadows ^ dying. All our
joys, are but toys, Idle thoughts deceiving. flying. None has power of an
hour, Of his lives bereaving.

Th'earth's but a point of the world, and a man
Is but a point of the Earths compared ^enture:
Shall then the point of a point be so vain,
As to triumph in a silly points adventure.
All is hazard that we have,
Here is nothing byding:
Days of pleasure are as streams
Through fair meadows glyding.
Well or woe, time does go,
Time has no returning.
Secret Fates guides our States,
Both in mirth and mourning.
What if a smile, or a beck, or a look
Feed thy fond thoughts with many vain conceivings:
May not that smile, or that beck, or that look,
Tell thee as well they are all but ^alse de^eivings.
Why should Beauty be so proud,
In things of no surmounting?
All her wealth is but a shrewd,
Nothing of accounting.
Then in this, there is no bliss,
Which is vain and idle
Beauties flowrs have their hours,
Time does hold the bridle.
What if the World with a lure of its wealth,
Raise thy degree to great place of hi^ advancing.
May not the World by a check of that wealth,
Bring thee again to as lo^^ despised changing*
While the Sun of wealth does shine,
Thou shall have friends plenty;
But ^^m^want, they then repine,
Not one abides of twenty.
Wealth and friends holds and ends,
As thy fortunes use and fall:
Up and down, smile and ^riown,
Certain is no state at all.
What if a grip, or a strain, or a sit,
^^^ch thee with pain of the feeling pangs of sickness
May not that grip, or that strain, or that s^^,
Show thee the form of thine own true perfect likeness,
Healt^ is but a glance of joy,
Subject to all changes;
Mitth is but a ^^lly ^oy,
Which mishap ^stranges.

Why art thou so weak of wit,
As to be in jeopardie,
When thou may in quiet sit.

^ LIke as the dumb Solsequium, with care over come, Does sorrow ^ when the Sun

But ^^^ks e^l^aves through langor of the night, ^ Till foolish Phaeton rise

From thence that flowr likes not to lour, But laughs ^ on Ph^bus opening out
her leaves.

So stands't with me, except I be where I may see
My lamp of light, my Lady and my Love:
When she departs, ten thousand darts from sundry airts,
Thirles through mine heart but rest or roove:
My countenance declares mine inward grief,
And Hope almost dispairs to find relief.
I die, I dwine, love does me pine:
I loath on every thing I look, alace!
Till Titan mine upon me shine,
That I revive through favor of her grace.
Fra she appear into her Sphere, begins to clear
The dawning of my long desired day:
Then Courage cries on Hope to rise, fra she espyes
The noysom night of absence went away:
No woe can me awake, nor yet impesh,
But on my stately stalk I flourish fresh:
I spring, I sprout, my leaves break out;
My color changes in an heartsom hew:
No more I lout, but stands up stout,
As glad of her, of whom I only grew.
O happy day! go not away, Apollo stay
Thy cart from going down into the West:
Of me thou make thy Zodiac, that I may take
My pleasure to behold whom I love best.
Her presence me restores to life from death,
Her absence also shores to cut my breath:
I wish in vain, thee to remain,
Since Primum mobile does say me nay.
At least, my wane, haste soon again.
Farewell, with patience perforce, till day.

Blessed freedom to refuse,
Soul and body to abuse:
Pity, O Adam! I pity thee.
O Adam! poor Adam! I pity thee.
Yet for thy fault thou punished shall be*
And in place of pleasure and ease,
Nothing but labor shall be to thee:
Thy meat win with sweat and disease.
And thou, O Eve! in stead of mirth*
And pleasant Paradise preclair,
In grievous pains shall be thy birth,
With many a sigh and groan rull ^air:

But thou, the Serpent that did go
So s^iely up upon the field,
Shall on thy belly (...) also,
The dust shall be thy meat and bield:
Cursed shall thou be for ever,
Enemy to the woman's seed:
He shall prevail, but thou shall never;
For he shall bruise thee on the head;
And shall restore again,
From death and endless pain,
My servant David to be with me,
Where he shall ay remain
With me his Soverain,
In joy and bliss eternally:
O Adam! O Adam! thus shall it be.
Away went Satan most discontent,
Christ being promised for to reign:
And metamorphos'd his intent,
Through power of his mighty King.
Our freedom, Lord, we have from thee,
That bowels of mercy powered out
Upon thy whole posterity,
Of thy free grace withoutten doubt.
Therefore we all humbly
Entreat thy Majesty,
That we may ever thankful be:
And for our sins contrite:
Praying to thee most sweet,
O Jesus! dear Jesus! have pity on me.
O Adam! dear Adam! I pity thee.

Alace! that ever I knew the place,

Woe worth the love of ignorance,
To love where no love can abide.
Woe worth the framed ignorance,
Since dol'rous death must be my guide.
Albeit as yet I suffer pain,
Not all is vain, my time is spent:
For she that has my faithful heart,
Would heart out of my bowels rent,
And alter many wits content.
Who lists to look on her a space,
Was never beauty more excellent,
But may be seen into her face.
And yet suppose my heart were free
At liberty but any pain,
It were impossible to me,
But it would soon return again
To her with whom it did remain,
Above all earthly wigth alive.

But needs must burst and break,
For love must have his mate:
Relief, alace! is late,
Since I am sorc'd to s^ie;

I love, I dwyn, I die.
Yet time shall try my truth,
And painful patient part;
Though love would tage but reuth,
And death with deadly dart
Should stay to cure my smart,
On fortunes sickle wheel,
All shall not change my heart,
Which is as true as steel:

Fettered with fetters, dispairing of relief;
Lying in langor as careful captive tint,

And blaikned be,
When she lists not to rue,
Why should I more pursue?
Ay when I list to love, I may let be,
And choose another Love that will love me.
Since wicked variance,
And false dissimulance,
And double inconstance
Bears the gree:
Since faithful observance,
Can get no recompense:
Ay when I list to love, I may let be,
And choose another Love that will love me.
Since says cannot be sound,
Nor pity can abound*
Why should I run on ground,
And cannot flee?
As good love lost as found,
Far better loose then bound:
Ay when I list to love I may let be,
And choose another Love that will love me.
Since I am not her mease,
She is so ill to please,
Love does her most disease,
That cannot slay.
Since as good comes as goes,
My heart yet shall I raise:
Ay when I list to love, I may let be,
And choose another Love that will love me.

THE XXVII. SONG.
^ THe lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall, The flee her splen, the ^
little spark its heat: The slender hairs cast shadows, tho but small: ^ and bees
have stings, although they be not great. Seas have their course, and ^ so have
little springs; And love is love in beggars as in Kings.

Where waters smoothest are, deep are the foords:
The dyal sturs, yet none perceives it move:
The firmest faith is in the fewest words:
The turtles cannot sing, and yet they love:
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongue to speak;
They hear, and see, and sigh, and then they break.
The Answer.
Bushes have tops, but the Cedar greater:
A hair casts shadow less then Pharaohs towr:
The spark calls heat, but greater heat the fire.
A be can sting, not like a scorpions power.
Seas have their course, and so have little sprin^s:
So beggars love, but greater love have King.
Rough are deep seas, when smooth (...) shallow foords.
The ratt makes noise, before the ^yalmove.
The firmest says is still co^firm'd with words.
And (...) loo^ing of their love.
It hearts have eyes and ears, the tongue can speak
They I hear, and see, and sigh before they'^ break.

THE XXVIII. SONG.
^ WHere art thou, hope, that promised me relief? Come hear my doom Come,
traitor hope, that all men does mischief, Come here let see, ^ pronounced by
disdain. Alace! sweet hope, where is thy scope? Or where and ease me of my
pain: Why flees thou me, to make me die? Will thou ^ shall thou remain? Since
hope is gone, and cannot me remead, In bondage thus not come again? ^ I must
bide fortunes fead, I must bide fortunes fead.

I had a heart, and now I heartless go:
I had a mind that daily was oppressed:
I had a friend that is now become my fo.
I had a will, yet can I get no rest.
What have I now? nothing I trow,
But spite where I (...)
What am I then? a heartless man:
Should love me thus destroy?
I love and serve one w^om I do regard,
Yet for my love, disdain is my reward.
If promised faith, and secret love intend,
And choose but doubt, I thought I had done well.
If fixed eye and inward heart do bind
A man in love, as now my heart does feel;
What pain is love? Or what may move
A man for to despair?
Nothing so great as hie despite
Of his sweet Lady fair:
Such is my chance, as now I must confess:
I love a Love, though she be merciless.
What pain can pierce a heart that I do want,
If love be pain that does any subdue?
What pain can force a body to be faint?
If love be pain, how can I pain eschew?
Since I am fast, knit to the mast,
This torment to endure,
And have no might, by law nor right,
My Lady to procure:
What shall I say, since will gain-stands the law?
I have a will, yet will makes me stand aw.
Where shall I go to hide my weary face?
Where shall I find a place for my defense?
Where is my love, who is the meetest place
Of all the earth that is my confidence^
She has my heart, till I depart,
Let her do what she li^t;
I cannot mend, but still depend,
And daily to insist
To purchase love, if love my love deserve;
If not for love, let love my body sterve.
Come here, ye Gods, and judge my cause aright;
Hear my complaint before ye me condemn:
Take you before my Lady most of might:
Let not the wolf devore the silly lamb.
If she may say, by night or day,
That ever I did her wrong,
My mind shall be, with cruelty,
To ly in prison strong;
Then shall ye save sakeless man from pain.
Try well my cause, and then remove disdain.
O Lady fair, whom I do honor most,
Your name and fame within my breast I have:
Let not my love and labor thus be lost;
But still in mind, I pray you, to ingraff,
That I am true, and shall not rue
A word that I have said:
I am your man, do what ye can,
When all these plays are played;
Then save your ship unbroken on the sand,
Since man and goods are all at your command.
Then choose to keep or loss that ye have done,
Your friendly friend does make you this request:
Let not friends come us Lovers two between,
Since late detests caused you me to detest,
Keep hope in store, you to deplore,
Conquer you friend indeed:
Remember ay, will come the day,
When friends a friends will need:
You have a friend so friendly and so true.
Keep well your friend: I say no more. Adieu.

^ WOE worth the time and eke the place That she was to me known; ^ For since I

Sometime I lived at liberty,
But now I do not so:
She has my heart so faithfully,
That I can love no mo, no mo jo, no mo,

To be refused of love, alace!
All earthly things adieu.
My M^st is she is merciless,
And will not on me rue, me rue jo, me rue,
And will not on me rue.

And no remead can ^^ave:
My pains they are remeadiless,
And all the wite you have, you have jo you have,
And all the wite you have.

In short, for to resound her praise,
She is the fairest, the fairest, the fairest,
the fairest of her days.
Her red is like unto the rose,
When from a bud unto the Sun:
Her comely colors does disclose
The first degree of ripeness won.
In short, for to resound her praise,
She is the fairest, the fairest, the fairest,
the fairest of her days.
And with the red is mixed a white,
Like to the same of fair Moonshine,
That does upon the water light,
And makes the color seem divine.
In short for to resound her praise,
She is the fairest, the fairest, the fairest,
the fairest of her days.

When another holds your hand,
You Will swear I hold you heart:
While thy Rival closs does stand,
And I sit far apart,
I am nearer yet then they,
Hid in your bosom, as you say:
Is this fair excusing?
O no, O no, O no, O no,
O no, no, no, no, no,
All is abusing.
Would a Rival then I were,
Or else your secret friend;
So much less should I you fear,
And not so much attend:

Yet must I seem your friend alone*
Is this fair excusing?
O no, O no, O no, O no,

Men are glad the sky being clear*
Lightly toying, sporting, joying
With their lovely pier:
But are sad to see the shour
Sadly dropping, louring, pouting,
Turning sweet to sour.
Then, sweet Love, disperse this cloud,
Which procures this woeful toying:
When each creature sings aloud,
Killing hearts with over-joying:
Every Dove does seek her mate;
Jointly billing, she is willing,
Sweets of love to take.
With such warts let us contend,
Wooing, doing, wedding, bedding,
This our strife shall end.

Tee, he, he, quoth she, make no fool of me;
Men, I know, will have oaths at pleasure:
But their hopes at end, they bewray their feigned,
And their oaths are kept at leisure.
Her words like swords, cut my sorry heart asunder.
Her flouts with doubts, keep my heart affectios under.

were too much; She is the forbidden fruit. ^ Oh! woe is me, that ever I did see,
The beauty that did me bewitch: Yet out, alace! I must forgo that face, The
treasor I esteemed so much.

O! shall I range into some dale*
Or to the mountains mourn?
Sad echoes shall resound my tale:
Or whether shall I turn?
Shall I buy that love,
No life to me will give,
But deeply wounds my heart*
If I flee away,
She will not to me say, stay,
My sorrows to convert.
O no, no, no, she will not once say so;
But comfortless I must be gone:
Yet though she be so thrawart unto me.
I Will love her, or I shall love none.
O! that I might but understand
The reasons of her hate,
To him would be at her command,
In love, in life, in state:
Then should I no more
In heart be grieved so fore,
Nor sad with discontent.
But since that I have loved
A Maid that so has proved
Unworthy, I do repent.
Something unkind has settled in her mind,
That caused her to leave me so.
Sweet, seem to me but half so kind to be,
Or let me the occasion know.
Thousand fortuns fall to her share,
Though she rejected me,
And filled my heart full of dispa^^,
Yet shall I constant be.
For she is the Dune
My tongue shall (...) name,
Fair branch of modesty,
Chaste of heart and mind.
Oh! were she half to kind,
Then would she pity me.
Sweet, turn at last, be hind as thou art chaste,
And let me in thy bosom dwell;
So shall we gain the pleasure of loves pain:
Till then, my dearest Love, Farewell.

Once more, away, though loath the world to leave,
Bids often away with that hellish slave.
Loath am I to forgo, that sweet alluring so.
Though thy ways be vain, shall I thee retain*
Though thy ways be vain, I quite thee:

May breeds and brings new blood.
May marches throghout every limb.

Use time while ye have time,

^ Jury came to Iebus-Salem, All the world was taxed then: Blessed ^ Mary
brought to Bethlchem, More then all the world again: A gift so blessed, so ^
good, the best That e're was seen, was heard, or done: A King, a Christ, ^
Prophet, and Priest; Jesus to us, to God a Son.

O, happy night! a day was never
Half so happy, sweet and fair:
Singing soldiers, blessed ever,
Fill the skies with sweetest air.
Amazed men fear, they see, they hear,
Yet doubt, and ask, How that was done?
'Twas bid, Be bold; it is foretold,
This night God has himself a Son.
'Twas upon a Comets blazing,
Cuma to Augustus said,
This fore-snows an act amazing,
Of a mother, still a maid,
A B^be shall bear, which all must fear,
And suddenly it must be done.
Yea, Caesar thou, to him must bow;
He Is Jesus, God, a Man, a Son.
Subtle Herod sought to find him,
With a purpose black as hell:
But a greater power combyn'd him,
And his purpose did repel.
Who should betray, do all obey,
As fitting was it should be done.
They all adore, and kneel before
This Jesus, God, a Man, a Son.
There appeared a golden Usher,
Kings attending on the train:
The bright Sun could not out-blus^^^er;
Such a sta rne're shone again.
Behold it stays, seeming it says,
Go in and see what there is done:
A Babe, whose birth leagues heaven and earth:
Jesus to us, to God a Son.
Was not this a blessed wonder,
God was man, and Man was God:
Foolish Jews mistook the thunder
Should proclaim their King abroad.
Angels they sing, Behold the King,
In Bethlehem where this was done.
Then we as they, rejoice and say,
We have a Savior, God a Son.
The Second Part.
TUrn your eyes which are affixed
On this worlds deceiving things,
And with joy and sorrow mixed,
Look upon the King of Kings;
Who left his Thron, with joys unknown;
Took flesh like ours, like us drew breath:
For us to die, here fix your eye,
And think upon his precious death.
See him in the garden praying,
While his sad Disciples slept:
See him in the garden sweating
Drops of blood, and how he wept.
As man he was, ^e wept, ala^e!
And trembling feared to loose his breath;
Yet to heavens will, he yielded still:
Then think upon his precious death.
See him by the soldiers taken,
When with Ave, and a kiss,
He that heaven had quite forsaken,
Had betrayed him, and with this,
Behold him bound, and guarded round,
To Caiphas brought to loose his breath:
There see the Jews, heav^ns King abuse:
And think upon his precious death.
See him in the hands of Pilate,
Like a base o^^ender stripped.
See the moan and tears they smile at,
While they see our Savior whipped.
Behold him bleed, his purple weed,
Record while ye have life and breath:
His taunts and scorns, his crown of thorns,
O! think upon his precious death.
See him in the hour of parting,
Hanging on the bloody Cross.
See his wounds, conceive his smarting,
And our gain, by his liss loss.
On either side, a fellow died,
The one derides him, leaving breath;
The other prays, and humbly says,
Lord, save me by thy precious death.
See as in those pangs he thristed,
And that to cool him he did call:
How these Jews, like Judas cursed,
Bring him vinegar and gall.
His Spirit then, to heaven again,
Commending with his latest breath:
The world he leaves, which men deceives*
Lord, keep us by thy precious death.

^ WHite as Lillies was her face, When she smiled, she beguiled, Quiting ^
faith with foul disgrace. Virtues service thus neglected, Heart with ^ sorrows
has infected, Quiting faith with foul disgrace. Virtues service* thus ^
neglected, Heart with sorrows has infected.

When I swore my heart her own,
She disdained, I complained,
Yet she left me overthrown;
Careless of my bitter groaning,
Ruethless bent to no relieving.
Vows and oaths, and faith assured,
Constant ever, changing never,
Yet she could not be procured,
To believe my pains exceeding,
From her skant neglect proceeding.
O! that Love should have the art^,
By surmises, and disguises,
To destroy a faithful heart;
Or that wanton looking women,
Should reward their friends as fo-men.
All in vain is Ladies love,
Quickly choosed, shortly loosed;
For their pride is to remove.
Out, alace! their looks first wins us,
And their pride has straight undone us.
To thy self, the sweetest fair,
Thou have wounded, and confounded
Changeless faith with foul despair,
And my service has envied,
And my succors has denied.
By thine error thou have lost
Heart unfeigned, truth unstained,
And the Swain that loved most:
More assured in love then they,
More despised in love then any.
For my heart, though set at naught,
Since you will it spoil, and kill it,
I will never change my thought:
But grieve that Beauty e're was born,
To banish love with froward scom.

Begone, and when the night shall come, come twice. Away, away. ^ For I must go
and meet my Love by the peep of day; But thou to death, thou ^ art too nigh of

Arise, bright Day, it is time to claim thy right;
Disperse the clouds, and with thy golden beams,
Both comfort me, and strike the churlish Nigarht
That would not go and yield me pleasant dreams.
Arise, arise.
And with thy rosy fingers point me where she lies:
Teach me but once, and put me in her sight,
That I may know who gives the greatest light.
Stay, gentle Night, lest thou prove more unkind,
To leave us languish. who enjoys our love:
Go not away, but let us here confined,
Not part us from these pleasures which we prove.
But stay: oh! stay:
For I must go, and love my Love, if you peep Day:
And if you do, you turn so soon again,
That our desires may feel no worlds disdain.
Let never rising Day bereave thee of thy right,
Who can betray thee with his golden beams.
Let us enjoy thee still, sweet gentle Night,
That we may sur^it in those pleasant dreams.
Advise, advise:
And never let the light of Day shine where she lies:
But if thou do, or let me in her sight,
There is no doubt, she gives the greater light.
And if thou will to Day resign thy due,
And so divorce me from my sweetest Dear,
In secret silence shall my heart so rue,
Wishing the Day were done, if you were there;
That the, that she,
And I, may spend the silent Night where we would be*
Where prattling Day dare never more appear,
Nor yet present to wrong my dearest Dear.

They first must have a Mistress fair,
And then her favor for to wear:
And so they go to flatteries school,
And calls her wife, they know a fool:
But let them swear by faith and truth,
I Will swear they care not for an oath.
It is a practice in this Age,
To lay their credit into gage,
By wit, by vows, by near attive,
To conquest that they most desire.

O let love my life remove, Since I live not where I love,
Where the truth once was, and is not,
Shadows are but vanities.
Showing want, that help they cannot,
Are but slaves of miseries.
Painted meat no hunger feeds,
Dying life each death exceeds.

Mortal life is tedious:
Death it is to live without thee:
Death of all most odious.
Turn again, and take me with thee,
Let me die, or live you with me.

As first have made him see,
And then have made him wise.
Love now no more will weep
For them that laugh the while;
Nor wake for them that sleep,
Nor sigh for them that smile.
So powerful is the Beauty,
That Love does now behold,
As Love is turned to duty,

This Beauty shows her might
To be of double kind,
In giving Love his sight,

^ OVer the mountains, and under the caves; Over the fountains, and ^ under the
waves; Under waters that are deepest, Which Neptun still ^ obey: Over rocks
that are the steepest, Love will find out his way.

Some may esteem him a child by his force,
Or some may deem him a coward, that is worse:
But if she whom he does honor,
Be consenting to play,
Set twenty guards about her,
Love will find out his way.
May do loose him by proving unkind;
Or some may suppose him, poor heart, to be blind:
But if never so closs ye wall him,
Do the best that ye may:
Blind Love, if ye do call him,
He will grape out his way.
Well may the Eagle stoup down the first,
Or nets to inveagle the Phoenix of the East:
With tears ye may move the Tiger
To give over his prey;
But never stop a Lover:
Love will find out his way.
It the earth does part them, he will soon course ^'re;
If seas do thwart them, he will swim to the shore:
If his Love became a swallow,
In the air for to stay,
Love will find wings to follow,
And swift ^lee out his way.
Where is no place for the glowworm to ly,
Where is no trace for the seat of a ^^ee,
Where the gnat dare never venture,
Lest her self fast she lay:
But if I ove come, he will enter,
And will find out his way.
There is no shining to ^^oss his intent,
There is no contriving his plots to prevent;
but if once the me^^age great him,
That his true Love does stay,
Though Demons come and meet him,
He will go on his way.

THE XLVI. SONG.
^ WHen from my Love I looked for love, and kind affections due; Too ^ well I
found her vows to prove most faithless and untrue. For when ^ I did ask her,
Why? most sharply she did reply, That she with me did never ^ agree to love,
but jestingly.

Mark but the subtle policies
that female lovers find,
Who loves to fix their constancies,
like feathers in the wind.
Although they swear and do protest,
they love you chiefly best,
Yet by and by, they will all deny,
and say, It was but jest.

THE XLVII. SONG.
^ REmember me, my Dear, I humbly you require; For my request ^ that loves you
best, With faithful heart entire, My heart shall rest ^ within your breast,
Remember me, my Dear.

Remember me, alace!
And let all rigor pass,
That I may prove in you some love,
To my joy and solace.
True love to move, I must behove;
Remember me, alace!
Remember me in pain,
With unkindness now slain:
That through delay of cruel way,
That in you does remain,
Remit, I say, alace! away:
Remember me in pain.
Remember on me, dear Heart,
That of pains has my part:
Your words unkind, sinks in mymind
And does increase my smart:
Yet shall ye find me true and kind:
Remember on me, dear Heart
Remember on me in thral,
Ready when I do call:
With true intent I do consent,
Heart* mind, body and all:
Never to repent, but to consent:
Remember on me in th^al.

^ HOw now, Shepherd, what means that? Why wearst thou willows ^ in thy hat?
Are thy scarffs of red and yellow, Turned to branches ^ of green willow? They
are changed, so am I; Sorrows lives when joys do dye: ^ It is Phylis only she,
That makes me wear the willow tree*

Is It the Lass that loved thee long!
Is it she that does thee wrong!
She who loved thee long and best,
Is her love now turned to jest?
She who loved me long and best,
Bids me set my mind at test:
She loves a new Love, loves not me,
Which makes me wear the willow tree*
Come now, Shepherd, let us join,
Since thy Love is like to mine;
For even she I thought most true,
Has also chang^d me for a new.
Herds-man, if thy hap be so,
Thou art partner of my woe;
Thy ill hap does mine appease,
Company does sorrow ease.
Is it she who loved thee now,
And swore her oath with solemn vow?
Faith and truth so truly plight,
Cannot be so soon neglect.
Faith and truth, vows and oaths,
Are forgot and broken both:
Cruel Phylis false to me,
Which makes me wear the willow tree:
Courage man, and do not mourn
For her who holds thy love in scorn:
Respect not them who loves not thee,
But cast away the willow tree.
For thee shall I live in pain?
Phylis once was true Love mine,
Which shall never forgotten be,
Although I wear the willow tree.
Shepherd, be thou ruled by me,
Cast away the willow tree;
For thy sorrow's her content,
And she is pleased if thou lament.
Herds-man, I Will be ruled by thee,
Here lies grief and willow tree:
Henceforth I will be as they,
That loves a new Love every day.

^ CAre, away, go thou from me; For I am not fit match for thee. Thou bereaves
me of my wits: Wherefore I hate thy frantic fits. ^ Therefore I will care no
more, Since that in cares comes no restore: But I will ^ sing, Hey down a down,
a die, And cast care away, away, from me.

If I want, I care to get:
The more I have, it does me fret:
Have I much, I care for more:
The more I have, I think I Am poor:
Thus does grief my mind oppress,
In wealth or woe, finds no red^ess.
Therefore I Will care no more, no more in vain,
For care has cost me mi^kle grief and pain.
Is not this world a slippry ball?
And thinks men strange to catch a fall.
Does not the sea both eb and flow?
And has not Fortune a painted show?
Why should men take care or grief,
Since that in care comes no relief?
There Is none so wise but may be o're-thrown,
The careless may reap what the careful has sown.
Well then, learn to know thy self
And care not for this worldly pel^
Whether thine estate be great of small,
Give thanks to God, what e'te be^al;
So shall the^ then live at ease,
No sudden (...) thee displease
Then may thou sing, Hey down a down; (...),
When thou have cast all care and grief from there.

^ SHepherd, saw thou not my fair lovely Phylis, Walking on you She is gone
this way to Dianaes fountain, And has left me ^ mountain, or on yonder plain.
Ay, she is so fair, and without compare: wounded with her high disdain. Love is

Shepherd, I have seen thy fair lovely Phylis,

Ah! I much admire, she is fai^ exceeding,
In surpassing beauty, should surpass in pride:
But, alace! I find they are all unkind:
Beauty knows her power too well:
When they list they love, when they please they move;
Thus they turn their heaven to hell:
Where their fair eyes glancing,
Like to Cupids dancing,
Rules well for to deceive us,
With vain hopes deluding,
Still their praise concluding,
Thus they love, thus they leave us.
Thus I do despair, love her I shall never,
If she be so coy, lost is all my love:
But she is so fair, I will love her ever.
All my pain is joy, which for her I prove.
If I should her love, and she should deny,
Heavy heart with me would break:
Though against my will, tongue thou must be still,
For she will not hear thee speak:
Then with kisses move her,
They shall show I love her:
Lovely Love, be thou my guide:
But I Will sore complain me,
She will still disdain me;
Beauty is so full of pride.

^ FAin would I wed a fair young Maid, that day and night could please me,
When my mind or body's grieved, that had the power to ease me.
^ Maids are full of longing thoughts, which breeds a pain - full sickness:
And that often I hear men say, is on-ly cured through quickness.
Often I have been wooed, and prayed, yet never could be moved.
Many for a day or two, I have most dearly loved:
But this (...) mind of mine, straight loathes the thing resolved.
I^'o love be sin in me, that sin is soon absolved.
Surely, I think, I shall at last fly to some holy Order;
When I am once settled there, I then can fly no farther:
Yet I would not die a Maid, because I had a mother:
As I was by one brought forth, I would bring forth another.
