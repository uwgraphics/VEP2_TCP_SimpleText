And those great things that have been done of old
At whose feet else should I my Labors lay,
But at the daughters of Mnemosyna?

But you (fair Sisters) should my Travels come,
Who are their Parent too, and have a share
As well as he in what they have or are.
Take therefore these my Works, but take them well,
As Mothers do the tales their children tell.

How Persians and Egyptians ordered theirs:
How Greeks, Arabians, Latins theirs: and when
The Julian and Gregorian Counts began:
How th'aequinoctial periods still ensued,
And when the Moon her waining light renewed
Through times dark mists, what lights the Scripture yield,
How Judah and Isreal's Kings are paralleld,
When Shemer's walls, and Zions Towers were burned.
When the two Tribes from Babels bonds returned.
What Kings the second Temple did adorn:

Th'Eclipses which did in that space betide.
When Philip and great Alexander died:
What Kings in Egypt, what in Persia sat:
The wars, and rising of the Roman State:
When Julius conquered, when Augustus reigned
How long their Legions in this Land remained:
When Hengist with his Saxon Troops came in:
And when their several Kingdoms did begin:
When Danes usurped: what Kings of them did reign:
And when the English thrust them out again:
When Norman William entered with his men:
What Princes of his Line have ruled since then:
When Scots the Isles North limits first assailed,
When they ore Dousken King of Picts prevailed:
What Kings from Kenneth held that Throne: what fate
The Welsh and Irish Crowns did subjugate.

Reader, will give thee satisfaction.
Of the Solar and Lunar Months.
1. THough it be certain that the circuits and variations of times, may be as
well computed by the motions and errors of the other Planets, as by those of
the Sun and Moon; yet because the most of men neither know those limits nor are
able to observe their periods (some of them extending unto two, some of them to
twelve, and some to thirty years) it is therefore according to the circulation
of these two Planets only, that the distinction of months and years is
generally measured and accounted.

2. The Solar month (to begin with that) is the time wherein the Sun moves
from one sign unto another, as from the first degree of Aries, to the first
degree of Taurus, or the like. But of these months we find not any Nation that
ever did, or yet does retain a true account: For neither do we in Europe (who
from Julius Caesar's time have been the most exact in this particular of all the
world, much less do other Nations) begin our months at the very time that the
Sun makes his entrance into these Signs; neither do we alot to every month
that just extent wherein he continues in a Sign, but many times exceed, and
sometimes are under the proportion.

3. Next unto the Solar are the Lunar months, by which indeed the general
mensuration of times has been always made (especially until Caesar's time) in
all Nations of the world, (except the Persians and Egyptians, of whose months
we shall speak hereafter) as being more obvious to vulgar apprehensions then
the others are.

4. Of these Lunar months, we find in Galen a fourfold division or partition,
of which it was the first only that was taken into the ordinary or common
dimension of the year, which he therefore calls (...), and (...), the exact
monthly time because how ever the other have the name of months, yet not so
properly as this, which is as it were by nature squared and fisted to that end.
And this is it which our late Writers call the month of Consecution or
Conjunction, comprehending the time wherein the Moon overtaketh the Sun after
his departure from him, or the interim that is from one change unto another,
which is 29 days and 12 hours, In consideration of which 12 hours, the ancient
Grecians at the end of every other month, took in a whole day, which they
called (...). Varro dear rustica, lib. 1. cap. 37. calls it extremam and
primam. Others have called it veterem and nova^am, because it was the end of
the old Moon, and the beginning of the New. Solon, as Diogenes Laertius
mentions in his life, was the first that caused it to be called (...), the 30
day, and from his time downwards to the odd months, viz to the 1. 3. 5. and
the like, they always assigned 30 days and to the even ones that is to the 2.
4. 6. and others of that kind, they only assigned 29. from whence it also
proceeded, that they called the one (...), full and entire months, and the
other (...), or months that were maimed and defective, because they wanted a
day of that was allotted to the other.

5. The second Lunar month (that I may also say something to the rest, though
they have little to do with our account of times) is that which Galen calls
(...). The time of the Moons proper circuit, by later Astrologers it is called
the month of Peragration comprehending the time wherein the Moon passes
through the Zodiacque (not regarding whether she have overtaken, or be in
conjunction with the Sun or not) which is absolved in 27. days and 8. hours
(says Galen) or if you examine the matter more exactly, in 27 days, 7. hours,
and 20. minutes: So that this month comes short of the former, well near the
space of a whole Sign, that is two days, 4. hours, and about 40. minutes: Yet
does not the Moon as she passes through the Zodiacque move at all times with
an equal quickness; for when she is in apogaeo, or in the higher part of his
Orb* she moves slowly, by reason that that part of his epicycle is carried
against, or contrary to the succession of the Signs, from the East unto the
West, and then in 24. hours she moves but through 11. degrees 37. minutes, and
10. seconds, and continues in a Sign about 64. hours, but when she is in
perigaeo, or the lowest part of her Orb she moves swiftly, by reason that that
part of her epicycle is carried along, or together with the succession of the
Signs, from the West unto the East, and then in 24. hours she moves through
15. degrees, 19. minutes, and 50. seconds, and continues little more then 47.
hours in a Sign. In her mean motion, that is when she participates of neither
of these extremes, she moves in 24. hours through 13. degr. 10 min. and 36.
sec., and continues in a Sign almost 55. hours, and by this motion (not
heeding either of the extremes which balance one another) we may calculate her
progress, and determine very near, what Sign she is in every day of the year
for ever, allowing her at the time of her change to be not above 15 degr. at
the most, nor less then 6 degr. at the least distant from the Sun, whether she
precede or follow him: For this is to be noted, that the Moon is not always in
the same Sign with the Sun when she is in conjunction with him, but sometimes in
the Sign before him, and sometimes in the Sign behind him, but still within the
distances before mentioned: And here (because we are treating of this subject)
it will not be amiss to subjoyn what Plin. l. 1. c. 17. and with him Macrobius
l. 1. Somnii have observed upon it. viz. that sometime during the whole time
that the Sun is in Sagittarius, the Moon has no conjunction at all with him;
and sometimes again before he go out of Gemini, she changes twice, or has two
conjunctions with him; which things are peculiar unto these Signs, and happen
not when the Sun is in any of the other. Unto this proper circuit of the Moon
it is, that Galen refers those particular and proper changes which happen unto
every singular and individual person, as preferments, honors, and the like,
together with those diseases which proceed from the particular, either natural,
or self-acquired indisposition of every man's body; and upon the successive
weeks of this month, every one of which consists of 9 days 19 hours, and
about 50 minutes, would he have a critical or decretory judgment to be made
upon them, unto life or death, either good or evil.

6. The third Lunar month is (...), the month of Illumination, or Apparition;
comprehending the time wherein the Moon demiseth his beams upon the earth, and
is conspicuous unto men; and that says Galen (de dieb. decret. l. 3. c. 9.) is
26 days and 12 hours; so that this month is 3 days shorter then the month of
Consecution: Which though it be not always true, for sometimes the Moon
recovereth the light within 1 or 3 days, and sometimes again not until 4 days
after her conjunction be compseated: yet 3 days is the middle betwixt both the
extremes, and falls out more frequently to be the time of the Moons
recovering his light, then either of the other. Now the causes say Astrologers
why the Moon recovereth her light sometimes earlier, and sometimes later, after
her conjunction with the Sun are these three 1. The swiftness of her motion,
when she is in the lower part of her epicycle. 2. Her septentrional latitude,
when her conjunction is in the head of the Dragon, as it is from the beginning
of Capricorn, to the beginning of Cancer. 3. Her conjunction in Signs, by
reason of her greater elevation from the Horizon directly occidental; that is,
when the degrees of the Circle of the Moons elevation above the Horizon be more
then the degrees of the Zodiaque which she has passed. Now as often (say they)
as all these causes do concur, which can only be (as Pliny and Macrobius in the
beforementioned places do affirm) when the Sun is in Aries, and at no time
else; then the same day may we see both the old Moon and the new; but this
happens exceeding rarely. When two of these causes meet together, then she is
seen the second day after her conjunction: when but one of these causes only
is existent, then she appears the third day after her coition; but when there
is none of these causes at all in being, then it is the fourth day after her
conjunction, before she become perspicuous. This third Lunar month is called
by Galen (...), the common circuit of the Moon; because indeed as it has
nothing proper of its own, but is compacted, and results out of the common
stock of both the other; so also it has a common and universal efficacy upon
all men, and in that respect is elsewhere termed by him, (...), the circuit
wherein she puts out her efficacy upon us: for as Galen conceives, those
days wherein the Moon is deprived of her light, she is also deprived of this
common efficacy; but as she recovereth her light, so she recovereth her virtue,
which together with her light she imprints upon the Elements, the Air, the
Water, and the Earth, whereof because all men do partake, therefore this
efficacy takes hold of all men, and does as he says, (...), equally conduce
unto us all: So that if there be a Pestilence, a Famine, Inundations, Storms,
Hail, or any disease which runs almost over all a Country, proceeding from
the extraordinary immutation or putrefaction of the Air, or other elements, it
is from this efficacy of the Moon that they arise, and by the critical weeks of
this month (which consist of 6. days, and 15 hours) that the events and issues
of them must be judged.

7. Out of a mixture of these 2 last months, joining first the sum of both
their circuits into one, and then retaining the half of the result, Galen
raises a fourth month, which he calls (...), the middle circuit consisting of
26 days, and 22 hours, and this he conceives to be more valid in the judgment
of diseases then either of the other out of which it is compacted, because the
Moon in this has a double influence; both that which she deriveth from the
Signs, and that which she receives and draws from the Sun. By later Writers
this month is called mensis medicinalis, the medicinal month, and mensis
Galeni, Galen's month, because it is a month of his invention: Johannes Picus
Mirandula, and Johannes Franciscus his Nephew, Agerus Ferrus, Fernelius, and
many others cavil at it, and call it a fictitious imaginary month, a month
that has none of Natures stamp and impress on it: But whether they blame him
justly for it, I leave it to others to determine.

Of the Solar and Lunar years.
1. THe Solar year is that space of time wherein the Sun by his own proper
motion runs through all his Sphaere (for that other motion whereby he is
every day carried about the Earth from one point of the heavens to the same
point again, is effected by the rapture or turning round of the Primum mobile,
and is not his own) and this proper circuit of his (says Alphonsus, to whom
all the late Astrologers do agree) is absolved in 365 days, 5 hours, 49 min.
and 15 seconds. Ptolomy in the beginning, l. 3. Almagest, makes it to be 365
days, 5 hours, 55 min. and 12 sec. Julius Caesar (as Suetonius delivers l. 2.
c. 2.) accounts it to be full 6 hours more then 365 days; although Ovid in his
3. book de Fastis, speaking of the same Caesar, says, that he added to the 365
days, 5 hours only: he calls them e pleno tempora quinta die. The Astrologers
which were before Hipparchus extend the circuit of the year yet more then this
account of Caesar's; some besides the 6 hours add 7 min. and 9 sec Thebit adds 9
min. and 12 sec. and Galen l. 3. progn. cap. 4. sticks not to affirm, that it
contains 365 days, 6 hours, and about the hundredth part of a day besides, which
amounts to 14 min. and 26 sec.; so that according to this computation, Galens
account of the year exceeds that of Alphonsus, 25 m. 11 sec.

The bits account exceeds 19 57 The other Astrologers exceed 17 54 Caesar's
account exceeds 10 45 Ptolomy's account exceeds 5 57

But we rather in this case choose to desert the authority of the Ancients, how
famous soever in their times they were, then to disavow the experience of all,
both the present and modern Astrologers in the world.

2. The Lunar year (not to speak of those curtal computations which Macrobius
mentions l. 1. Saturn. c. 8. viz. that of the Arcadians, who terminated their
year at three months end, or that of the Acarnanians, who allowed but six
months unto theirs, is generally received to be that space of time wherein the
Moon after her conjunction with the Sun in any of the Signs, compleateth 12
months of consecution, and at the end thereof meets with the Sun again in
the same Sign, or near unto it, in which at the beginning of the said months
she closed with him, which annual circuit of hers she absolveth in the space of
354 days, that is 11 days sooner then the Sun absolveth his.

3. Now though the true reason of the discrepancy of the annual circuits of the
Sun and Moon be the difference of their Monthly motions, the moon in every
month of her consecution coming short of the Sun 22 hours, and about 30 min.
which in 12 months time amounts to the 11 days before specified, and some odd
hours, which the Grecians also (as I shall show hereafter) made an allowance
for; yet it is an ingenious observation, and worth our noting, which Severianus
a Greek Author makes upon that question, as you may find it Centur. 1. c 94. of
Angelus Politianus his Miscellanies. It is not to be doubted (says he) but God
having made the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon to rule the night, did also
place them in the first moment of their Creation, in such stations of the
heavens as were most convenient for the functions unto which they were
designed, that is, the Sun in the East, and the Moon in the West, diametrically
opposite unto one another. Neither indeed was it fitting (as he conceives)
that the Moon at her entrance into the world should be imperfect in her light,
as she is in both her quarters, and a little before and after her conjunction,
but rather shining with a full and ample Orb; for those changes and various
faces of hers, those waxings and waynings which we since have seen, were to be
the distinctions of ensuing times, and were no ways congruous to her first
position She was therefore at her Creation at the Full in all her luster, and
when the Sun had dispatched his first diurnal race, and was now setting in the
West, she had also in the interim run through her: Hemisphere, and was come
about unto the East. But says he, the Moon could not be opposite to the Sun,
and at his full unless you allow her to be 15 days old, that is 11 days elder
then the world, for it was upon the fourth day of the world that the Sun and
the Moon were made: So that to bring the Moon into that position in which in
all probability she was set at her Creation, we must borrow for her 11 days
more then she could any other ways pretend unto; for the utmost that in reason
could be granted to her without this borrowing, was to bear the figure of the
fourth day, which was the day of her Creation; but upon the fourth day she
could not have filled up the light of all her Orb, nor be in the Eastern limits
of the heavens, when the Sun was in the West: to remove therefore these
impediments, and fit her the better to discharge her office, she took up as we
may say 11 days upon lone or interest, appearing to the world as 15 days old,
when indeed she had not right to any more then 4. which 11 days as she had
borrowed at the first, and by this means gotten the start of the Sun for such a
time; so it was meet she should pay them back again, and come so much short of
the Sun at the end of his annual course, as she was before him at the beginning
of it: which has been, and still is every year 11 days from the Creation to
this present.

Of the Hebrew Months and Years.
1. THe Names and Order of the Hebrew months as they are gathered partly out
of the Scriptures, and where they are silent, from Josephus, are

1. Nisan. Xanthicus. 2 Macch. 11. Esth. 3. 7. 2. Zif. 1 King. 6. 1. 3. Sivan.
Esth. 8. 9. 4. Rothem. 5. Ab. 6. Elul. 7. Thisri. ^thanim 1 King. 8. 2. 8. B^l.
1 King. 6. 38. 9. Gisl^u. Zechar. 7. 1. 10. Tebeth Esth. 2. 16. 11. Sebat.
Zech. 1. 7. 12. Adar. Esth. 3. 7.
2. From the Creation to Moses the month Thisri, or Ethanim was the first
month of their year, but at their coming out of Egypt, the beginning of their
year was altered, at leastwise as to Religious businesses, and the month
Nisan in which their deliverance was effected, appointed to be the first month,
thereof. Chald. Paraphr. in cap. 8. lib. 3. Reg. Josephus Antiqu. Jud. l. 1. c.
3.

3. That these months of the Hebrews were not Solar, but Lunar months, that
is, months of consecution, every 2 whereof consist of 59 days, appears Numb.
28 11. where the Feasts of the New Moons are called the beginning of the
Months: But if they had used Solar months, the new Moons would not have
happened always at the beginning of their months, but sometimes in the middle,
sometimes at the latter end thereof, as they do with us, who use the Solar
months in other places.

4. It appears also by the observation of their Passover, which according to
the prescript of the Law, was to be the 14 day of the first month at Even,
Lev. 23. 5. but it is acknowledged on all hands, that then the Moon was always
at the Full; which could not be, if the New Moon had not been the beginning of
the Month: And hence it is, that that eclipse of the Sun at the Passion of our
Lord, being then the Jewish Passover, was looked upon by the Heathen
themselves as so portentous, that upon sight thereof one of the wisest of them
cried out, Aut Deus Naturae patitur, aut mundi machina dissolvetur: for the
Moon being then at the Full in opposition to the Sun, no natural reason could
be found for such an Eclipse, which had she been in conjunction with him, had
been but ordinary and familiar.

5. From the observation of the Passover we may also gather the beginning of
the Hebrew year, for that, as has been proved, was the 14 day of the first
month; but this 14 day of the first month (says Nicephorus Cal^stus,
Historiae Ecclesiasticae lib. 12. cap. 32. was always so ordered by the Jews,
that it was the first Full Moon after the Vernal aequinoctial, the Sun being
entered into Aries, or at leastwise it was upon the aequinoctial day it self, if
the full moon happened to fall upon it; and hence it is that the Synod of Nice,
that they might come as near unto the Jews as might be, decreed that all
Christians should keep their Easter the first Sunday after the Full moon next
ensuing after the vernal aequinoctial.

6. Yet before this can be clear* it will be needful also to speak something of
the aequinoctials, which have varied much since Moses his time, and will yet
vary according to our Julian account from time to time, while the world
continues, and that for the reason hereafter specified.

7. We have said before that according to our Julian computation there are
annually 10 min. and 45 sec. superaccounted (more then should be) to the year)
which 10 min. and 45 sec. in the space of 134 years, amounts unto a whole day.

8. This superaddition from the Creation to this time being 5688 years (if we
measure all times past by that Julian account which we now observe) has caused
the aequinoctials and solstices to anticipate already 42 days, and to advance
themselves 60 years unto another, which 74 years hence will be complete.

9. By this Account then the vernal aequinoctial at the Creation was April the
21. but at the Israelites coming out of Egypt being after the Creation 2514
years, it had advanced 18 days, and 102 years toward another, being then the
third of April; at the Nativity of Christ being from the former deliverance
1517 years, and from the Creation 4031 years, it had advanced 11 days more, and
43 years toward the 12. which put together, makes 30 days, and 11 years
advance unto another, being at that time the 22 day of March, from Christ to
this present being 1657, y. it has further advanced 12 days, and 49 years
toward another, in all as aforesaid 42 days, and 60 years toward the 43. being
now the 10 day of March, and so to continue 74 years more, that is, till the
year 1731, at which time it will be the 9 of March.

10. To make this more perspicuous, take a Table of the aequinoctials according
to our Julian account from the Creation to this present.

11. To know therefore when the Jews began their year, any year of the world
from Moses to this present, you must first seek out the day of the aequinoctial
in the preceding Table, which done, by the Rules hereafter specified, find out
the full Moon next adjoining to the aequinoctial; and then consider whether it
fell before the aequinoctial, or after it, or just upon it; if it fell on or
after the aequinoctial, then the Jews began their year with the new Moon that
went next before the aequinoctial; but if the full Moon happened before the
aequinoctial, then the Jews began not their year till the next new Moon after
the aequinoctial.

12. For example, if you would know when the Jews began their year at the
building of Solomon's Temple, which was in the year of the world 2994. Look
first into the preceding Table, and there you shall find the aequinoctial to be
the 30 day of March, which done, enquire for the full moon next adjoining to
the 30 day of March, and that you shall find (the golden Number for the said
year being 9 and the Epact for the Julian account being also 9, which two are
the stars that must guide you in the finding of the changes of the Moon to be
upon the 4. day of April, that is 5 days after the aequinoctial, by which you
may conclude, that the Hebrews began their year upon the 20 day of March, being
the new Moon went before the aequinoctial. The like course you may take for any
other year, and at your pleasure, by the help of the following Calendar, reduce
the Julian account to the Gregorian.

13. Only this you must observe, that the Jews following of this course before
mentioned in the beginning of their year: and having a regard that their
Passover according to the Law might be celebrated either on or after the
vernal aequinoctial, were often forced to make an intercalation of a whole
month, betwixt the end of one year, and the beginning of another; and this
they did not by any certain rule, but sometimes every second, and sometimes every
third year, as they found themselves necessitated by the falling of their
Passover; but when they made no intercalation, then the ensuing year began
where the former ended, and anticipated yearly 11 days, according to the manner
of the ordinary Lunar years.

14. This will be evident, if you observe the following Ephemeris for the
Hebrew year (beginning at the year of the world abovementioned, and continuing
for 11 years, that is) from the year 2994, to the year 3004. in which you may
see how the following years sometimes anticipated one another 11 days, and how
sometimes again a whole month was interserted betwixt the conclusion of one
year, and the beginning of another; and all that the Passover as has been
said, might be kept either on or after the vernal aequinoctial; by which
president you may make any other Ephemeris for what number of years you do
desire, from the Israelites coming out of Egypt to this present.

15. As for the Hebrew years before Moses, it is believed that they took their
beginning with the full Moon next adjoining to the Autumnal aequinoctial,
whether it did precede or follow it, the month Thisri or Ethanim being the
first month of the year, and the other months succeeding in their order, till
you come to Nisan, and end in Elul.

16. Now to find the Autumnal aequinoctial, you have no more to do, but to seek
out the vernal aequinoctial in the former table, and having found it, to add
thereunto 186 days, which is the time the Sun spends betwixt the one
aequinoctial and the other; and that will bring you to the Autumnal: So that if
at the Creation the vernal aequinoctial were upon the 21 day of April, the
Autumnal must be upon the 24 of October.

17. The intercalations must be as they were in the Mosaical years, viz of a
whole month every second or third year, according as you are necessitated to
begin you year with the full Moon either preceding or following the
aequinoctial: Take a view thereof in the first te^ first year after the
Creation, allowing according to Julius Scaligers computation (of which more
hereafter) the golden number for the first year to be 17, and the Epact to be
7. and s^ every year after in proportion, and then you will have the
anticipations and intercalations o^ the said years, as follows.

Of the Egyptian Months and Years.
1. NExt unto the Hebrews, we may justly place the Egyptians, amongst whom
says Macrobius lib. 1. Saturn. cap. 8. there has always been a certain
measure and equability of the Year.

2. The names of their months are.

1. Thoth. 2. Phaothy. 3. Athyr. 4. Choiac. 5. Tybi. 6. Mecheir. 7. Phalmenoth.
8. Pharmouti. 9. Pacon. 10. Paini. 11. ^p^phi. 12. Mesori.
3. To every one of these months they assigned thirty days, so that they were
neither absolutely Lunar nor Solar months, but of a mixed nature, betwixt
both; And to the end of Mesori, or their last month, they superadded five days
more, making their whole year 365 days.

4. The odd hours or quadrant of a day wherein the year exceeds 365 days,
they made no reckoning of, until the time of Dioclesian the Emperor, and then
they were compelled to take in a Bissextile, and to conform their Calendar to
the Romans.

5. From the deficiency of this Bissextile every fourth year, their first
month Thoth did anticipate a day; so that their year which in Pliny's time
began the 18 of July, in the time of Lactantius Firmianus (de falls. Relig. lib.
1. cap. 6.) took its beginning in September.

6. Lalamantius (in his commentary upon Galen de diebus decretoriis) contends
that Anno 1540. 41, 42, and 43. their month Thoth began the third day of
August, according to which computation the last year 1656, this present year
1657, and the two following years, viz. 58 and 59; must begin the 5. day of
July.

7. And thus if we should allow this Egyptian account to have continued from
the Creation to this present, their month Thoth in this interval of time would
have shifted well near four times through the Calendar, falling out sometimes in
the Spring, sometimes in the Summer, sometimes in Autumn, and sometimes in Winter;
varying in every 120 years, a month, or thereabouts.

Of the Babylonian and Persian months and years.
1. THe Babylonians and Persians in all things agreed with the Egyptians, both
in the quantity of their year, the beginning of it, and the partition of their
months. Diador. Sicul. lib. 2. cap. 1. Strab. lib. Geograph. 17.

2. The names of the Persian months are,

1. Formidech. 2. Ardaimech. 3. Cardaimech. 4. Zirmech. 5. Mardan. 6.
Sarenbemech. 7. Machiramech 8. Ebemnich. 9. Ydramech. 10. Dim^ch. 11.
Bechmem^ch. 12. Azsirda^ith.
Of the Grecian or Attick Months and Years.
1. THe Attick months (like the Hebrews) were months of consecution, every
two whereof contained 59 days, that is the odd months 30 days, and the even
but 29.

2. The names of their months were

1. katombaon 2. etageitnon 3. oedromon 4. aimakterion 5. Puanepson 6.
nthesteron 7. Poseidon 8. Gamelon 9. laphebolon 10. ounechon 11. THargelon 12.
Skirophoron
3. These months they divided into 3 decads, the first whereof was (...), of
the month beginning: the second decad was (...), of the middle of the month:
and the last was (...), of the month expiring: The two former of these Decads
they numbered in a regular forward order calling the first day of the month
(...), the first day of the month beginning: the second (...)- (...), the
second day of the month beginning, and so unto the tenth. In like manner they
called the 11 day (...), the first after the tenth of the middle of the month:
the 12 (...), the second of the tenth of the middle of the month, and so unto
the 20, which was called (...), or (...): But in the last Decad they used a
retrograde or backward order, calling the 21 of the odd months (...), the
tenth day before the ending of the month: the 22 (...), the ninth day before
the ending; and so unto the last, which (says Suidas) was promiscuously called
(...), or (...), because it was the end of one month, and the beginning of
another, standing as it were in the middle betwixt them both, and borrowing
half a day from either. But in the even months the 21 day was not called
(...), but (...), the ninth of the month expiring: for unto these months
there was no tenth at all assigned, but was as it were cut off, and lopped from
them; and this was the reason why they were called (...), that is, months that
had but nine days in this last part or section, whereas the other (called
(...)) had 10 allotted to them. Neither was the 29 day of these months called
(...) (for they had already as has been said, passed over their odd 12 hours
unto the former months, and had no common tie with those that followed) but
simply (...), or (...), the last day of the month, or first before the end
thereof.

4. And as the months of the Atticks were Lunar months, so were their years
also Lunar years, consisting only of 354 days, that is being 11 days and some
odd hours shorter then the Solar; to make up which deficiency at the first (as
Plutarch mentions in the life of Numa) they took in every second year a month
of 22 days, and afterward (as Herodotus and Libanius, in his argument upon
Demosthenes his Oration against Andro^ion, do affirm) they made an
intercalation every third year of 33 days, but finding still that they came not
up unto the Solar year, because the odd quadrant of a day was every year
omitted; the year before the first Olympiad, they molded up their years into
an octennial chain or circuit, at the end whereof they inserted three months
(which they called (...), containing 30. days apiece, or 90 days in all, that
is 88 days for the (...), or several elevens, and 2 days for the Bissextiles,
or quadrants of a day, which in that interim of time they had lost from the
Solar reckoning. Mac. l. 1. Saturn cap. 15.

5. The beginning of this octennial circuit or chain of years, they always
made at the first new Moon after the Summer Solstice, beginning their day at
Noon (which was also common to the Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians) as the
Romans did theirs at midnight, and the Hebrews theirs according to the Law at
Even. But after the first year, all the other years of the octennium
anticipated one another 11 days, until the end of the 8* or Embolim year, when
the intercalar months came in, and then they returned to the same point where
they began before.

6. Hence we collect (numbering the year from the first Olympiad to this
present, according to the Chronology hereafter following) that from the first
institution of this octennial chain, to this instant year 1657. there have
intervened 304 embolims or intercalar years, and that this present year is the
first of a new circuit or revolution, and consequently that their month
Hecatombaeon begins this year June 30 being the first New Moon after the
Summer solstice.

Of the Arabian months and Years.
1. THe Arabians in the ordination of their year, followed partly the Attick,
and partly the Egyptian customs.

2. With the Egyptians they agreed in this, that they made no allowance for the
quadrant, or excurrent particulars of a day (as Strabo calls them) wherein the
year exceeds 365 days: and hence it is that the beginning of their year is
fleeting and uncertain, and every fourth year (as the Egyptians did)
anticipates a day, being sometimes in Winter, sometimes in Summer, sometimes in
the Spring, and sometimes in Autumn, running from one solstice, and one
aequinoctial to another.

3. With the Atticks they agreed in this, that their year consisted of 12
Lunations or months of consecution, every one of which began with the (...) or
conjunction of the Luminaries, and that at every three years end (though the
Athenians upon better grounds reformed that practice) they made an
intercalation of 33 days, for the so many elevens wherein annually the Lunar
year is exceeded by the Solar.

4. The Names of the Arabian months are

1. Almuharaz. 2. Saphar. 3. Rabe. 1 4. Rabe 2 5. Gemedy 1 6. Gemedy 2 7 Rage.
8. Sahaben. 9 Ramaden 10 S^nel 11 Dulc^ida 12 Dulcheya.
5. If you would make an Ephemeris for this account, set but the first day of
Almularaz in the same place with the Egyptian Thoth* and at the end of every
three years, you shall find both the Calendars exactly agreeing with one an
other.

Of the Latin Months and Years,
1. BEfore Romulus, what months and years were received amongst the Latins,
is something doubtful; yet Ovid in l. 3. de Fastis, makes it more then probable
that they were Lunar months they used.

2. By Romulus the year was altered, and 10 months only taken into the account
thereof, unto 4 of which he assigned 31 days, and to the rest but 30, making it
in the whole to consist of 304 days. Macrob. lib. 1. Saturn. cap. 13. and 14.

3. The names and order of his months you have in these four verses of Ovid.

Martis erat primus Mensis, Venerisque secundus.
Haec generis Princeps, conditur ille fuit.
Tertius a senibus. Juvenum de nomine quartus.
Caetera de numero turba notato suo est.
Which are the same which we yet retain, save only that in honor of the
Caesar's, July and August were afterward inserted, instead of Quintilis and
Sextilis.

4. Numa Pompilius added January and February, and brought his year to the
course of the Moon, which yet because he found that it came short of the
Solstitial year, by interposing intercalar months, be so ordered it, that
every 24 year he made it equal with the Solar, Live. lib. 1 primae decadis. ab
Vrb condit.

5. Macrobius in the before mentioned place lib. 1. Saturn. cap. 15. affirms,
that Numa Pompilius in his intercalations conformed himself unto the manner of
the Graecians, which if he did, it seems strange why it was every 24th year
only, (as Livy says) that his year agreed with the Solar, whereas the Grecian
years agreed with the Solar every 8th year, immediately upon the interposition
of their Embolim or intercalar months. Lalamanti^s in answer hereunto affirms,
that Numa Pompilius being led by a Pythagorical superstition, rather then any
Astrological reason, in honor of the odd numbers, added every year a day unto
January, by means whereof, notwithstanding his intercalation of 90 days, at the
end of his first and second octennium (after the Grecian manner) he found
still that his years exceeded the Grecian years so many days as there were
years elapsed, to salve which incongruity, at the end of his third octennium or
24th year, he took away 24 days out of the 3 embolim or intercalar months,
which were then to follow in lieu of so many days wherein in that interim his
January had made his years exceed the Grecian years, and inserted only 66
days, that is 22 in every intercalar month; and by this means, at the end of
the said 24 years, a perfect agreement was made up betwixt his years and the
Grecian, and betwixt both of them (as Livy will have it) with the Solar.

Of the Julian and Gregorian Years.
1. JVlius Caesar finding the intercalations of Numa Pompilius to be full of
trouble, and accompanied withal with much confusion (the aestival months within
the circuit of 8 years becoming vernal, and the vernal hiemal) reduced the year
unto the Solar course, dividing the months as we now have them, and assigning
to the year 365 days, and 6 hours, and accordingly for the odd six hours, he
appointed every 4th year a day more to be inserted into February; which day,
hecause it was immediately placed after the 6th of their Calends, which is our
24th day, and they (that they might not vary their usual forms) for 2 days
together wrote sexto calendarum Martii, The Leap year therefore, or the year
wherein that Writing was so repeated, was called Annus Bissextilis.

2. But Augustus Caesar who succeeded Julius (as Macrobius witnesses, lib. 1.
Saturn cap. 17.) finding the intercalations of Julius to be greater then they
ought (as indeed they were) commanded that the Bissextile should be taken in
every 5th year only, and not every 4th, as Julius had appointed; but succeeding
times perceiving the account of Julius (though not so exact as might be wished)
yet to be nearer unto Truth then that of Augustus was, laid aside his
computation, as the more erroneous, and kept themselves firmly to the former.

3. And in this manner things continued, especially in Europe, and those other
parts of the world that professed Christ for 1600 years together, though with
some confusion in the computations of the Church, for by reason of those few
minutes wherein the Julian account exceeds the true circuit of the Sun, the
Festivals of the Church had anticipated already about 12 days, and were still
certain to anticipate more and more, from time to time, if no remedy were
provided to the contrary.

4. For proof of this, there is a place alleged out of St Augustine, wherein
he affirms, that Christmas day, or the 25 of December, at such time as Christ
was born, was the shortest day of the year, and John the Baptists day, or the
24 of June, was at that time the longest day in the year (as they were both
indeed within the two Solstitia's, no manifest increase or diminution of the
days being as yet to be discerned in either of the seasons) and this was not
without a mystery, says the Father, for Christ was to increase, but John was
to decrease, John 3. 20. which was intimated (says he) in the very times of
their Nativity, the one being born when the days were at the shortest, but
began to receive an augmentation; the other when the days were at the longest,
but began to suffer a diminution. But with us that adhere unto the Julian
account, neither of these Festivals answer unto this Position, the Sun being
entered into Capricorn 14 days before our Christmas day, and the like time into
Cancer, before the Feast of John the Baptist

5. At last about 90 years ago, the Council of Trent took into their
consideration this difference of time, which was happened in the keeping of our
Christian Festivals, by reason of the few minutes before mentioned, and that
they might come a little nearer to the primitive observation of these Feasts,
they brought the year ten days backward, causing that to be called the 25 day
of the month, which before was but the 15th, which was not so much indeed as
they ought to have done (for the Solstices had anticipated 12 days already, as
has been said, from the time of Julius) but it sufficed them as they thought,
to bring things into that condition which they were in at the Council of Nice,
which was much about the State whereunto they now reduced them, for they had
the Acts and Decrees of that Council in so much veneration, that they believed
they could not without great impiety make any addition or alteration in them.
And from Gregory the 13. who then sat in the Papal chair when the year was
thus brought back, this computation has since been called the Gregorian
computation, and it is received at this day in all Countries that profess a
subjection to the Sea of Rome, but we in England, who a little before had cast
off our obedience to that See, made no alteration in our Calendar, but still
followed the Julian account, though so erroneous as was said before, that if
the world should last so long, our Christmas day that should be in the
Solstice, would in time fall into the aequinoctial; nay Christ and John would
shift their Tropicks, and when the Sun comes into Cancer, we should keep the
Feast of Christ's Nativity; and when he enters into Capricorn, we should keep
the Nativity of the Baptist.

6. This Gregorian account (which is ten days before our English, their 11th
day being the first of ours, and our last day of every month the 10th of
theirs) will continue in the same state that now it is, without any alteration,
till the year 1700. at which time being Leap year, letting fall only the
intercalar day, which should have been inserted into February, in recompense of
the 10 min. and 45 see. which for 134 years. together, since the reduction of
their year have been advanced, their year will afterward run on again as it
did before, till the year 1834, and then, or at least the next Leap year after
that, they must again cast away another day out of the considerations
aforesaid, and the like 134 years for ever.

7. The names of the days of the Roman months as they were in Julius his time,
and notwithstanding the Gregorian alteration, are still familiarly used in all
Latin writings, both in the one computation and the other: take in these
verses following.

The Old Ethnic Roman month it self divides
Into three portions, Calends, Nones, and Ides.
Calends the first, in March, October, May,
And July. Nones they call the seventh day.
In all months else the fifth: these past, before
Their Ides ensue, eight days they number more.
In all the rest such dates they do express
As they precede these periods more or less.
Sex Nonas Octobris habet, Mars, Maius, Iulus,
Quatuor at reliqui. Sunt Idus cuilibet octo.

Things necessary to be observed for the clearing of the former Adjustment.
1. THe last year of the former Kings, are oftentimes the first of the
succeeding, and many times again the years of the precedent Kings are complete,
before those of their Successors do begin; in which difference of account, we
either follow the express words of the Text, or necessary consequence deducted
from it.

2. Whereas the Scriptures place the first year of Asa in the 20th year of
Jeroboam, and we have set it in his 21. yet we depart not from the truth
herein, nor offer any blemish to the Text; for nothing is so certain as that it
was concurrent with them both; but we are forced to parallel it with the
latter, because otherwise we could not make the Reign of Nadab so perspicuous,

3. The like course we are compelled to take with the first year of Jehosaphat,
placing it in the 5th year of Ahab, whereas the Scripture adjoyns it to his
fourth, because otherwise it would have appeared to the Reader, that Jehoram
King of Israel (betwixt whom and Ahab there interceded Ahazia) had begun his
reign before the death of Ahab, which is not likely.

4. But as concerning the time which the Text assigns to Ahazia King of Israel,
we cannot make things clear any other way, but only by affirming that he spent
his two years for the most part jointly, with his Father; and though the sum of
affairs had been perhaps for some time committed to his hands, yet he reigned
not many weeks, or at least not many months after him alone: for the latter
part of Jehosaphats 18th year being concurrent with Ahabs 22th (which it is
clear enough it was, his first year being concurrent with Ahabs 4th and 5th)
and Jehoram succeeding before Jehosaphats 18 was expired, it is sufficiently
apparent that Ahazia could not reign many months after Ahab was deceased.

5. It is to be noted of Jehoram King of Judah, that he was made King twice in
the life time of his Father, first in the 17th year of his Fathers reign, for
Jehoram the son of Ahab is said to have succeeded his brother Ahazia in the
second year of Jehoram the son of Jehosaphat, 2 King. 1. 17. but his entering
into his kingdom was in the 18th year of Jehosaphat, 2 King. 3. 1. 2. He seems
after this to have been a private man again for diverse years, and at length to
have been admitted a new into the Kingdom about the 22 of his Father, and then
to have begun those 8 years which the Scripture assigns unto his reign, four
whereof he reigned only by himself, and the other jointly with his Father, 2
Kings 8. 16.

The account from Nabonasser to Christ Proved.
1. FRom Nabonasser to Alexanders death, are years 424 From Alexanders death to
Augustus Ptol. alm. 3. cap 8. 294 718

2. The distances above mentioned are made appear by Mathematical calculations
and Eclipses, then which no account in the world can be more certain, viz.

Anno Nab. 1. Of the Moon, 2. Of the Moon, 27 3. Of the Moon, anno 1, 2.
Merdoc. 28 4. Of the Sun Xerxes at Sardis, 276 5 Of the Moon, Battle of

Cynoceph. 550 11. Of the Moon anno 7. Phi^omet. 575 12. Of the Moon, Battle of
Perseus. 580

3. Christ being 30 years old in the 15th of Tiberius, Luke 3. 1. cum 23. and
allowing 44 years to the reign of Augustus, it follows that he was born in
Augustus his 29th, which makes the account as before from Nabonasser to his
birth 746 4. The same account may be also thus proved, From Nabonasser to the
destruction of Samaria 8 Thence to the destruction of Jerusalem 133 Thence to
Cyrus 70 Thence to the 6th of Darius when the Temple was finished, John 2. 20.
46 Thence to the 7th of Artaxerxes when Daniels weeks began. 32 Daniels weeks
deducting the life of Christ 457 746

5. Now that Daniels weeks cannot commence neither with the Decree of Cyrus,
nor yet with the Decree of Darius, which was 46 years after, sufficiently
appears from hence, that the birth of Christ is by S. Luke expressly affirmed to
have been in the reign of Augustus Caesar, Luke 2. 1. but this could not have
been so, if Daniels weeks had taken their beginning at either of the Decrees
before mentioned: for from Narbonassen unto Cyrus his Decree, are but 211
years, to which if you add Daniels 457 years, it will want 50 years of the time
that by undeniable demonstrations Ptolomy proves to have interceded betwixt
Nabonasser and Augustus. Again, from Nabonasser to the sixth year of Darius,
are but 257 years, to which when you have added Daniels weeks, you will yet be
4 years short of the beginning of Augustus: But if you begin Daniels weeks at
the Decree of Artaxerxes, Ezra 7. 7. and 13. which was 87. years after the
Decree of Cyrus, it will not only bring you to Augustus his reign but to that
numerical year of his reign, that Christ shall be 30 years old at the 15th of
Tiberius Caesar, which is agreeable to the Scriptures.

That Salmanasser and Nabonasser are the same, and that Nabonasser took Samaria
in the eighth year of his Reign.
IN all this Chronology abovementioned, there is not a particular left
unproved, but only this, that Salmanasser and Nabonasser are the same, and that
Nabonasser took Samaria in the 8th year of his Reign, which may be evinced by
these arguments.

1. From the 1st of Nab^nasser to the 1st of Nabopolass^r, according to
Ptolomy, are 122 years, and the same difference the Scriptures make betwixt
Salmanasser and Nebuchadnezzar, for it is clear in Scripture, that the
difference between the destruction of Samaria, and the destruction of
Jerusalem, was 133 years, but the former was taken in the 8th year of
Salmanasser, and the other in the 18th or 19th of Nebuchadnezzar, which comes
to the same account. Concerning the beginning of Nebuchadnezzars reign, and
consequently the time that he took Jerusalem, the Scripture is plain enough,
Jor. 25. 1. and 32. 1. although he may seem to have reigned one year before
that together with his Father, Dan. 1. 1. And concerning Salmanasser we have
light enough to believe, that he began his reign in the second year of Hoshea,
and about the 13th or 14th year of Ahaz, and consequently, that the destruction
of Samaria, which was in the 9th and last year of Hoshea, was in the 8th of
his: for besides that plain connection which is in the Text, 2 Kings 17. 1. and
3. Hoshea began to reign in the 12th year of Ahaz, etc. and against him came
up Salmanasser, that is, Salmanasser came up against him in Ahaz his time, and
not long after Hoshea's admittance to his Kingdom (for so much the connection
does import) besides this connection, I say, it is considerable, that Hoshea had
been subdued by Salmanasser, had made his peace again, and brought him presents
year by year; was again revolted, and fallen off; had entered into conspiracy
with So King of Egypt; and that Samaria thereupon had been besieged, and all
this before the 4th year of Hezekia, which was the 7th of Hoshea was expired;
which could not have been if Salmanasser had not begun his reign presently
after Hoshea in the 13th or 14th year of Ahaz. To which we may add what Raleigh
observes out of 2 Chronicles 28. 16. that it is probable that those Kings of Assyria
to whom Ahaz sent in his necessity, were Tiglath Peleser, and Salmanasser his
Son; for whereas the Geneva Notes would have it to be Tiglath and the Kings
that were his Vassals; it is neither likely that Ahaz would address himself to
those who themselves were Vassals to another: Neither do we find that Tiglath
at that time had made any such conquests as to give him a Lordship over other
Kings. More verisimilous it is, that as Ahaz had formerly in his need applied
himself to Tigl^th the Father, 2 Kings 16. 7. so Tiglath being now deceased, he
put himself under the protection of Salmanasser his Son, and so the Text may
seem to speak of a successive sending of Ahaz unto several Kings of Assyria,
and not of his sending at the same time to one King of Assyria, who was the
Sovereign and supreme, and unto others who under him were but subservient:
Unless you will imagine that Tiglath at this time, being yet alive, had
invested Salmanasser his Son with all his power (as Ahaz not long after this
did Hezekia, and Nabulasser in after times did Nabopol^sser) and so Ahaz. that
he might cast a disrespect on neither, sent unto them both. But if this were
so, it is all one with that which we affirm, for still Salmanasser was King,
and the date of his reign (as Hezekia's did) ran on, from the time of his
association in the Empire.

2. The three first Eclipses calculated by Ptolomy in the first and second year
of Mardocempadus, or Merodach Baladan (which I lately mentioned) were in the
27th and 28th of Nabonasser, Ptol. lib. 4. cap. 8. But allowing the first and
second year of Merodach to be concurring with the 25th and 26th of Hezekia (as
I shall show they were) the account will fall right with the time that the
Scriptures assign to Salmanasser. Now concerning Merodach Baladan, though it be
true that he was King of Babylon in the 15th year of Hezekia, and upon the
miracle, at his recovery sent Ambassadors to congratulate with him, Isa. 39.
1. yet in regard he was then possessed of a little portion of the Assyrian
Monarchy, the years of his Empire are not reckoned till after the death of
Asar-haddon, when he was invested with it all, which was in the 25th year of
Hezechia: For a further confirmation whereof. it is not amiss to take notice,
that the 20th of Merodach, is paralleld by Chronologers with the last year of
Sethon; the 32 of Merodach, with the 10th of the 12 Princes; and the 5th of
Nabulass^r the son of Ben-Merodach, with the 23th of Psammiticus. But certain
it is, that all these Princes in Egypt were contemporary with Manasses the son
of Hezekias, and that the last year of Sethon, was Ma^asses his 15th year; the
10th of the 12 Princes, his 27th, and the 23th of Psammiticus, the 40th of his
reign. Which being granted, the first year of Merodach's Empire (which Ptolomy
refers to in his Ecliples) falls right with the 25th of Hezekia, and
consequently the first of Nabonasser (whose 27th as has been said, answers to
the first of Merodach's) falls right with the 2d year of Hoshea King of Israel.

Only before I leave this argument, because it will conduce to the
understanding of what has been before premised, I think it not amiss to
subjoyn something of the Kings of Egypt. From Cham to Chencres who was drowned
in the Red Sea, and from him to Thuoris, we have a long Catalogue of Kings, and
of the Dynastyes in which they reigned, but the Authors are so dubious from
whom we have them that we have but little certainty whereon to build: After
that we read of Solomon's father in Law (Vaphre's Eusebius call him) and of
Sisac in the time of Rehoboam; but how long either of them reigned, or who
succeeded them, we are yet to seek. In Salmanasser or Nabonassers time indeed
we find a bottom; there we meet with Sabacus (so the Scripture calls him) King
of Egypt, next unto him was Sechon, the last year of whose reign was
concurrent with the 15th of Manasses, after Sechon there was a Vacancy, or
Inter regnum 2 years, then the 12 Princes held the Kingdom 15 years, which
expired, it was invested in Psammiticus: Concernign which Psammiticus also
Chronologers do not well agree. Herodotus accounts his reign to be 54 years:
Eusebius gives him but 44. Mercator to reconcile these; gives 44 to his single
reign, and 10 years to his Ruling jointly with the 12 Princes, in the 5th year
of whose Aristocracy he was taken in. Now it is according to this last
computation, that you must understand what was said before of Manasses his 40th
year, being concurrent with Psammiticus his 23d, that is, it was the 23th year
from the time that Psammiticus had to do with the Government of Egypt, 10 years
of which 23, he spent in a joint rule with the other Princes, and 13 only he
had ruled solely by himself.

And thus much might suffice for the proving of the age of the world before the
Birth of Christ, as far as we could, from Scripture, and where that speaks not,
from the undeniable account of other Authors. But because amongst the Ancients
there were other Aeras in request besides that of Nabonasser, the knowledge
whereof will give a great light to the understanding of their Writings, I will
speak a little of them, and so proceed.

Olympiads.
1. AN Olympiad contains the Revolution of 4 years, the era thereof was
begun by Iphitus, at the Summer Solstice, the 51 year of Vzzias, after the
destruction of Troy 407 years, and before the era of Nabonasser 29 years.

2. That the first Olympiad began the 51th of Vzzias, appears thus; Cyrus as
King began his Reign in the first year of the 54th Olympiad, 30 years before he
was Monarch, Tull, de Divin lib. 1. Justin. lib. 1. which allowing 70 years for
the captivity, and the reigns of the intervening Kings of Judah, brings us back
to the 51th of Vzzias.

3. That the first Olympiad was 407 years after the destruction of Troy, is
gathered thus by Eratosthenes.

From the taking of Troy to the descent of Hercules his Posterity into
Peloponnesus, are 80 From thence to the Ionian expedition, 60 From thence to
Lycurgus in Sparta 159 From thence to the first Olympiad 108 407

4. That the first Olympiad was 29 years before the first of Nab^nasser,
appears thus; The distance betwixt the first Olympiad and the death of
Alexander, is reckoned by Erat^sthenes to be 453 years, which he gathers thus,

years. From the first Olympiad to the passage of Xerxes into Greece, are 297
Thence to the Pelopennesian war 048 Thence to the Victory of Lysander 027
Thence to the Battle of Leuctra 034 Thence to the death of Philip Maced. 035
Thence to the death of Alexander 012 453

But the death of Alexander (as has been said) is by Ptolomy placed in the
424th year of Nabonasser, which proves the difference betwixt the two accounts
to be 29 years.

5. The same difference betwixt the first Olympiad, and the first of
Nabonasser, may be also proved by the Eclipse of Xerxes, which by Ptolomy is
placed (as before) in the 267th year of Nabonasser; but by all Greek Writers is
reckoned to be the last year of the 74th Olympiad, which comes to the same
account.

The Era of Rome ab Urbe condita.
1. Cicero, Eutropius, Orosius, place it in the third year of the 6th Olympiad.

2. Halicarnassaeus, Solinus, Antiochenus, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Eusebius,
place it in the first year of the 7th Olympiad.

3. With the latter agrees Bucholzer, placing it in the 8th year of Ahaz,
though Codoman would have it in the 11th.

4. According to Bucholzers account, to whom Raleigh with the best Chronologers
do adhere, the era of Rome is after the first Olympiad 24 years, and 5 years
before the first of Nabonasser.

The Building of Carthage.
1. Carthage was built by Dido in the 7th year of Pigmalion King of Tire, which
from the 12th of Hiram (at which time Solomon's Temple was built) was 144 years
current, Joseph. cont. App. lib. 1.

2 The 144th year of Solomon's Temple being the 11th year of Joas, was but 143
years before the birth of Rome, and was after the destruction of Troy 289
years, and therefore long after the death of Aeneas, which proves Virgils story
to be a Fable.

Seleucus his Era.
1. Seleucus his era took its beginning the 438th year current after
Nabonasser, which is proved thus,

2. The 519th year of Nabonasser was the 82 of Seleucus, Ptol. alm. l. 11. c.
7. and 8. Gauric. in loc. citat.

3. Bunting in his observations finds the Saturn recorded by Ptolomy to agree
(as it ought) with this account, being placed in the Sign of Virgo, as the
Chaldaeans had observed it in the same year, which was from Nabonasser 519.
From Seleucus 82, and the last year of the 137 Olympiad.

The Cycles.
1. THere be two Cardinal Cycles or Revolutions of years, upon the knowledge
whereof all the operations both in the Julian and Gregorian Calender do depend.

2. The first is the Cycle of the Sun, or the revolution of 28 years, in which
time the Dominical or Sunday letters are carried round, so that all the
Positions of the Sun, and all the fixed solemnities of the Church, are upon the
same days of the week that they were on 28 years before.

3. The other is the Cycle of the Moon, or the space of 19 years, in which the
Moon returns to the self same day of the Sun that she was in 19 years before:
It is called also the Golden Number, because it was wont to be written in the
Calendar in letters of Gold, right at that day whereon the Moon changed.

4. The number of these two Cycles is every year the same, both in the Julian
and Gregorian computations, and is changed upon the first day of January.

5. To find it, your best way is, (though there be also other ways) to have
recourse unto the Julian era.

6. The Julian era is so called, not because it is fitted rather to the Julian
computation then to the Gregorian for it is equally subservient to them both,
but from Julius Scaliger, to whom we owe the invention of it; and it is of more
use then any other era whatsoever, as being more ready, and with less trouble
applyable to all the operations of the Calendar which you have need of, then
any other.

7. The total of the Julian era is 7980, which results from the multiplication
of the numbers of the two Cycles, and 15. which are the years of an Indiction
by one another.

8. The present Number for the Julian era (any year that you desire) is
gathered by adding 682 unto the age of the world, for so much the Julian era
is supposed to precede the Creation; according to which account the Julian era
for this year current is 6370.

9. When you have found the number of the Julian era for the year that you
desire, divide it by any of the Cycles before named, that is, by 28, 19, or 15.
and the Fraction that remains is the number of the Cycle that you divide it by
for that year present; but if there be no Fraction, then the Divisor it self is
the number that you look for.

10. The Annual series of the Dominical Letters, both in the Julian and
Gregorian computation have dependence upon the Cycle of the Sun, but yet differ
from one another, as in the following Table.

1. HAving found the Dominical Letter and Golden Number for any year that you
desire (which account so ever it be for, whether Julian or Gregorian) apply
your self to the subsequent Tables, which for their usefulness you may call
Claves anni, and under the Dominical letter, right against your Golden Number,
you shall see it specified what day of what month Easter will be on that year.

2: When you have found Easter, by reckoning backwards seven Sundays, you shall
have quinquagesimo* and from thence reckoning still backward, you may number
the Sundays until Christmas, which makes the intervallum minus. Again, from
Easter reckon five Sundays forward, and you have Rogation Sunday; the next
Thursday following is Ascension day, the second Sunday after that is
Whitsunday, and the next Sunday Trinity Sunday, from whence reckon the Sundays
until Advent, and you have intervallum majus.

3. Advent Sunday is known by the Dominical letters, and falls either in
November or December, as in the Scheme following.

New Moons in February.
1. BEcause many in the computation of their Easter, have an eye only to the
change of the Moon in February, and care not for making use of any other rules;
for their satisfaction I have adjoined this following Table, by which,
observing only the Golden Number, they may know when the Moon changes in
February for ever, in both accounts, both Julian and Gregorian.

2. Yet it is to be noted in this Table, that we reckon the day according to
the custom of Astronomers, to begin at Noon, and therefore we conclude, that
when the Golden Number is 8. then there is nothing of the Moon in the Julian
February, which accounting the days otherwise, does not hold: for whenever
the Golden Number is 8. and the Dominical Letter B as it was in the year 1603.
and will be again in the year School. then the Moon changes the first of
February in the forenoon, which changes notwithstanding we repute to be in New

in both those years, and all others of the same kind falls not until the 6th
day of March following which is five weeks after. The like may be observed in
the Gregorian February, when the Golden Number is 9. for then beginning the day
astronomically, there is no change, which beginning it otherwise would sometimes
happen.

The Epact.
1. AS the annual circuit of the Moon every year comes short of the Sun 11
days (as has been said before) so by adding these elevens yearly unto one
another, and casting away 30 which is the limits of a month, as often as the
Sun exceeds that period, we make an estimate of the proportion that the Moon
keeps in her course for ever.

2. These elevens that are yearly added unto one another, or unto the remaining
surplusage after the rejection of the aforesaid thirthys, are called the Epact;
and this addition or change of the Epact is made every year upon the first day
of March.

3. Every 19 years, which is the Cycle of the Moon, the Moon in that interim,
(as has been said) returning to the same point of the Sun, the Epact also is
the same that it was before, and has always a necessary dependence upon the
Golden Number.

4. When the Cycle of the Moon or Golden Number is 1, the Epact in the
Gregorian year is also 1, but in the Julian year it is 11.

5. All other Epacts, whether Julian or Gregorian, are formed by the additions
and substractions before mentioned; that is, by adding 11. and substracting 30.
as often as occasion does require.

6. In the following Table you may see all the Epacts both Julian and
Gregorian, with their dependancies upon the Golden Number every year, from the
beginning of the Cycle, to the end thereof.

7. To know the age of the Moon by the Epact, or the proportion that she
keeps in her course every month, you must do as follows.

1. Take the number of the months to that time that you desire, reckoning
March to be the first, April the second, and so in order, till you come to
February, which is the 13th.

2. Take also the number of the days of the month, how many of it are past to
that instant day that you enquire for.

3. Unto both these numbers add the number of the Epact (which account soever
you desire it for) for that year present; and if the total Jul. Ep. Gol. N. Gr.

time, but if it exceed thirty, the overplus only is her age.

4. But in such months as have under one and thirty days, you must cast away
only nine and twenty from the Sum, and account the residue for the age of the
Moon.

Between the two Quarters, the Moon Southeth in the night; before and after
them she Southeth in the day.

The hour of the Night.
1. OBserve her shadow on a Sun-dyal, and if it be past the 12th hour line,
add there unto the Moons southing, and the aggregate is the hour of the night;
but what hours and minutes the shadow wants of the said 12th hour-line,
substract it from the Moons southing. and the remainder is the hour of the
night.

2. Yet you must remember that so many half hours as the shadow is past the
hour of 12. you must substract so many minutes; but for so many half hours as
the shadow wants of the hour of 12. you must add so many minutes.

The time of the Tides.
1. AT Quinborough, South-hampton, Portsmouth, and Wellins, it is full Sea the
same hour and minute that the Moon comes to the South.

2. In all other Havens or Ports where the hours and quarters stand before the
same, there it is high water so many hours and quarters before the Moons coming
to the South; but where the hours and quarters stand after the same, there it
is high water so long after the Moons southing, as in the following Table.

to Mercury, the seventh to Luna, the eighth again to Saturn, and the ninth,
which is the time of his birth, to Jupiter; and from every one of these in
their several Regiments, they affirm that the Infant (they call it (...), and
(...), according to the time of the gestation) receives monthly a noxious or
benign impression, according to the diverse influences and effects of every
Planet.

2. But being delivered from the womb, they assign unto every planet a whole
years government over the life of man, but in a contrary order from what they
held before; for now they give the first years government unto Luna the second
to Mercury, the third to Venus, the fourth to Sol, the fifth to Mars, the sixth
to Jupiter, and the seventh to Saturn, and so back again in the same ring from
seven years unto seven, till our lives be finished; which in this interim,
every year participate of the nature of the Planet who is the Lord thereof.

3. And from this extraordinary and sudden fall or rise which happens unto man,
betwixt the influence of Saturn, who is in the highest degree of all the scale;
and the influence of the Moon, who is the lowest, they affirm, that all those
great and dangerous mutations of our lives and fortunes do proceed. For whilst
we are in the womb, being after the end of the seventh month, when we were
under Lunas government, immediately mounted into Saturns, if upon that juncture
of time (that is in the eight month) we happen to be brought into the world,
it generally proves mortal to us all, though it be not so to those that are
born in the seventh month, or in the month before: and after our birth,
during the whole series of our lives, those climacterical changes that befall
us, are nothing else but the fruits of those fearful falcus or downfals which
we suffer from the influence of Saturn unto Luna.

Of the Influence of the Moon.
1. BEsides this common influence which the Moon has in order with the other
Planets, she has so a particular influence, says Galen, which she puts
forth upon the actions, fortunes, and lives of men, in her diametral and
tetragonal schematismes or stations in the Zodiac.

2. By the diametral station of the Moon, he understands her being in a Sign,
in the continuance or progress of a work diametrically opposite to the Sign
wherein she was at the beginning or entrance of it: as for example, if she were
in Aries at the beginning of any work, she is then said to be in a diametral
station thereunto, when she enters into Libra: and here faith he, she raises
a vehement tumult and commotion ((...) Galen calls it) by reason that her beams
and the opposite Signs do now fully and totally oppugn, and fight, as it were,
against one another, and disagree (generally) besides in passive qualities.

3. By her tetragonal position, he understands her being in a Sign which looks
upon the former with a quadrite aspect, as when she is in Cancer, or in
Capricorn; and here also she causes (says he) great perturbations and
commotions; because the Signs, though they oppose not one another so fully as
the former, yet they disagree either in both, or at least in active qualities.

4. Yet this influence of the Moon in her diametral or tetragonal stations is
much changed, to the detriment or advantage of the work or person, according to
her conjunction with the other Planets; concerning which, it is not amiss to
let you know, that Galen divides them into (...), or (...), (bonas fortunas,
the vulgar Astrologians call them) which are Jupiter and Venus, and (...), or
(...) (they call them malas fortunas) which are Mars and Saturn; betwixt which
he places Sol and Mercury in the middle, neither ranking them with the one,
nor with the other. Now put the case (says Galen) that a man at the time of
his birth have the Moon in Aries, conjoined with temperate and propitious
planets; but that when she enters into Taurus, she has malign and noxious
Planets conjoined with her; then certainly (says he) whenever during the
whole series of that man's life the Moon comes into Aries, or is in a diametral
or tetragonal station to it, as in Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn, it will be well
and prosperous with that man: but when she comes into Taurus, or into any
Sign diametrically or tetragonally posited thereunto, as Leo, Scorpio, or
Aquarius, it will be troublesome and grievous with him; and all Diseases that
take their beginnings in the one, shall be passed safely without danger, but
those that arise or happen in the other, shall be very dangerous, if not
mortal. And the like he affirms of all other businesses and affairs, which if
they be attempted or begun (says he) under good aspects, they produce good
changes and alterations at the diametral and retragonal positions of the Moon;
but if they be begun under evil aspects, the changes and alterations which will
be produced at those positions, will be also evil.

Predictions of Weather by the Moon.
THe presagements of weather that are to be gathered by the Moon (such as are
more certain, and wherein you may confide) take in these verses of Virgil, lib.
Georg. 1. with whom Aratus, quoted by Galen and Pliny also, lib. 18. cap. 35.
do agree.

Luna revertentes cum primum colligit ignes
Si nigrum obscuro comprenderit era cornu
Maximus agricolis, pelagoque parabitur imber:
At si Virgineum suffuderitore ruborem
Ventus erit, vento semper rubet aurea Phoebe.
Sin ortu in quarto, namque is certissimus auctor
Pura nec obtusis per coelum cornibus ibit
Totus ille dies, and qui nascentur ab illo
Exactum ad mensem, pluvia ventisque carebunt.

1. Eclipses in general.
COncerning the Eclipses of the Luminaries, and when, and how they happen, it
shall suffice to give you the description of Macrobius lib. 1. Somnii, as being
more compendious and dilucid then any other which I have met withal, his words
are these.

Natura coelestium circulorum incorporalis est linea, quae ita mente
concipitur, ut sola longitudine censeatur, latum habere non possit, sed in
Zodiaco latitudinem signorum capacitas exigebat; quantum igitur spatii lati
dimensis porrectis syderibus occupabat duabus lineis limitatum est, and terna
ducta per medium Ecliptica vocatur, quia cum cursum suum in eadem linea pari ut
Sol and Luna conficiunt; alterius horum necesse est venire defectum. Solis, si
ei tunc Luna succedat: Lunae, si tunc adversa sit soli. Ideo nec unquam sol
deficit nisi cum tricessimus Lunae dies est, and nisi quintadecim cursus sui
die nescit Luna defectum. Sic enim evenit ut aut Lunae contra Solemn positae ad
mutuandum ab eo solitum lumen, sub eadem inventus linea terrae conas obsistat,
aut soli ipsa succedens objectu suo ab humana aspectu lumen ejus repellat.

England, with the Chorography and Chronologies thereof.
Miles THe length of England from the Lizard point to Berwick, is 334 The
breadth of England from Dover to Holy-head, is 250

The ancient inhabitants of South Britain; now England and Wales, in the time
of the Romans, were the

Attrebatii, Belgae, Brigantes, Cantii, Cassiuclani, Coritani, Cornarii,
Damnonii, Dimetae, Durotriges, Iceni, Ordovices, Ottodini, Regni, Silures,
Trinobantes.

The Kingdom of the Saxons, and Principality of the Britans were
Kent 1. The Kingdom of Kent began under Hengist the Saxon, Anno 475. and ended
after the succession of 18 Kings, in B^ldred, who resigned Regality to Egbert
King of the West Saxons, about the year 832 South Saxons 2. The Kingdom of the
South Saxons began under Hella, in the year 536. and ended after the succession
of 7 Kings, in Aldine, who lost it to Kenewald, King of the West Saxons, An.
684. East Angles 3. The Kingdom of the East Angles began under the Saxon Vffa,
Ann. 546. and ended after the succession of 17. Kings, Anno 964. in which year
Edward the elder took it from the Danes, who had formerly taken it from St
Edmond, the last King of the Saxan blood, Anno 869. Deira 4. The Kingdom of
Deira begun under the Saxon Ella, Anno 547. Bernitia. 5. The Kingdom of
Bernitia begun under the Saxon Ida, Anno 550. Northumberland. 6. These two
Kingdoms were both united under the name of Northumberland, by Ethelfride, and
continued under the succession of 23 Kings, till the year 878. at which time it
was subdued by the Danes, who afterward yielded it to Eldred, King of the West
Saxons, Anno 954. East Saxons 7. The Kingdom of the East Saxons began Anno 614,
and ended after the succession of 17 Kings, in Suthred, whose time Egbert King
of the West Saxons united it to his Kingdom. 832. Mercia 8. The Kingdom of
Mercia began under Penda a Saxon, Anno 626. and ended after the succession of
18 Kings, in Cenolph, who lost it to Alured King of the West Saxons, Anno 876.
After that, it was seized by the Danes, but again recovered from them by Edward
the Elder, Anno 917 West Saxons 9. The Kingdom of the West Saxons began by
Cerdicus, Anno 522. This Kingdom so far prevailed over the rest, that Egbert
the 17th King thereof, having subdued the principal Kingdoms of the Saxon
heptarchy, styled himself the first Monarch, and commanded South Britain to be
called England, from the English Saxons, from whose blood he was extracted.
After him Alured totally united all the Kingdoms into one Monarchy, leaving the
Danes possession, but not Sovereignty in Northumberland: yet in the year 1017.
the Danes recovered the Dominion, which they held for three sucessions
(Canutus, Harald, and Hardicanutus) but having reigned 26 years, and tyrannized
255 years, they were utterly expelled by the English, Anno 1041. and the Crown
again returned to the West Saxons line in Edward the Confessor; after whom
Harald the second usurped the Kingdom, in the nonage of Edgar Athelinge, the
true heir; but he lost it to the Normans upon the coming in of Duke William,
Anno 1066. There were of the West Saxon line, thirty two Kings, sixteen whereof
were Monarchs of England, besides the three Danish Kings which intervened.
North Wales. 10. The Principality of North Wales was begun by Meruin the eldest
son of Roderick, about the year 873. and ended in Leolin the second, who lost
it to Edward, the first of that name of the Norman Race, Anno 1282. South
Wales. 11. The Principality of South Wales was begun by Amorand, the second son
of Roderick, at the same time with the former, and ended in Rhese, who lost his
estate to the English, in the Reign of the abovesaid Edward. Powisland. 12.
The Principality of Powisland was begun by Cadell the youngest son of Roderick,
at the same time that his Brothers entered upon theirs, but was incorporated
into England long before the others, by Avis the last of Cadels posterity, who
married to Joh. Carleton an Englishman, whose issue, with this title, is now
extinct.
The Shires of England.
ENgland was divided into Shires by the West Saxon Alured, whose names and
bounds are little altered to this day.

Of late years Henry the 8th did the same with Wales, making it one Nation
with the English.

The Circuits of England and Wales.
1. HEnry the second toward the end of his Reign, divided his whole Kingdom
into six several circuits, and for the administration of Justice, and trial of
causes betwixt men and men (for the better ease and comfort of his Subjects) he
appointed certain Judges twice in every year to ride and to travel through
those circuits: Which course and order is carefully continued unto this day.

2. Henry the eighth did the same in the Principality of Wales, which he
divided into three circuits, and appointed itenerary Judges to ride through
them twice a year, and to administer Justice, as in England.

Were first created by King James, and continued by King Charles; they are
dignities betwixt a Baron and a Knight, they have vulgarly the compellation of
the latter given unto them, but they are hereditary as the former.

Orders of Knighthood.
1. OF the Garter, instituted by King Edward the third. There are of this Order
26. Knights, whereof the Kings of England were Sovereigns; and it has been so
much desired for its excellency, that 8 Emperors, 22 Foreign Kings and Dukes,
and diverse Noblemen of other Countries have been Followers of it. The Ensign
is a blew Garter buckled on the left Leg, on which these words are embroydered,
Honi soit qui mal y pense. About their Necks they wear a blew Ribband, at the
end of which hangs the Image of St George, on whose day they are installed.

2. Of the Bath, brought in England by Henry the fourth, Anno 1399. they are
created only at the coronation of Kings and Queens, and the installations of
the Princes of Wales: They wear about their Necks a Carnation Ribband.

The Kingdoms of Scotland.
Picts 1. THe more ancient is that of the Picts, who indeed were no other then
very Britans, who when the Roman Eagle had with her black Wings darkened the
South part of the Island, fled into the Northern parts, preferring penurious
liberty, before fetters of Gold. These men using the ancient custom of painting
their bodies, after their countrymen had conformed themselves to more civil
courses, were by the Romans called Picti Scots The other, but more prevailing
Kingdom, was that of the Scots who out of Ireland entered into the West part of
this Country, Anno 424. For the space of 400 years the Picts and they, (though
with many quarrels, victories, and overthrows on either side) held their
several Territories, till at last, Kenneth King of the Scots, having vanquished
Dunsken King of the Picts, Anno 839. extinguished both their Kingdom and their
name, causing the whole Country to be called Scotland.

The Union of the Scottish Families.
AFter the death of Alexander the third, there was fierce contention for the
Kingdom of Scotland, betwixt the Families of the Baliols and the Bruses. By our
Edward the first, as supreme Lord of Scotland, after 13 years Inter regnum, the
right was adjudged to the Baliols; but was by them lost again, and again
recovered, and variously held, till at the last, after 84 years difference,
their several Titles were united in the person of Robert Stuart, who married
the eldest Sister of David Bruise, and the Heir of that Family, himself being
heir unto the Baliols, An. 1371.

The Union of the English Families.
2. THe like difference there was in England for the Diadem, betwixt the
Families of York and Lancaster, wherein were fought 17 pitched fields, and in
which there perished 8 Kings and Princes, 40 Dukes, Marquisses and Earls,
200000 of the common people, besides Barons and Gentlemen; but it was composed
by Henry the 7th, heir of the house of Lancaster, who married Elizabeth,
daughter and heir unto King Edward the 4th, of the House of York, Anno 1485.

The Union of the Kingdom.
3. BUt the greatest Union was that which was made betwixt the two Kingdoms of
England and Scotland, in the person of James the 6th King of Scotland, who as
heir unto Margaret, eldest daughter unto Henry the 7th, was admitted to the
English Throne, after the death of Queen Elizabeth, Anno 1602. and made of the
two Kingdoms but one Monarchy.

Ireland.
1. IReland contains in length 400 miles, in breadth 200, and next unto
Britain is the greatest Island in Europe.

2. It was once divided into five several Kingdoms, viz. Mounster, Connaght,
Vlster, Meth, and Leinster.

3. But Dermot Match Morock King of Lemster, being driven out of his Kingdom by
Maurice ^ Rock King of Meth, Anno 1172. applied himself to Henry 2. King of
England for relief, who upon this occasion made himself master of the whole.

4. Henry the 8th was the first of the English race, who styled himself King of
Ireland: Before that, the English Princes contented themselves to be called
Lords thereof.

FINIS.
AT Bun-hill near Chiswel-street, over against the New Artillery-ground, at the
third Brick-house with a Balcony and a Globe at the Door, lives an
Astrological Chimical Physician, who has Medicines prepared of Herbs, so
gathered with the Planetary Influence, whose dexterous operation far exceeds
any other in the cure of Diseases. He has also* a singular approved Medicine
