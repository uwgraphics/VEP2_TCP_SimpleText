THE Converted Cavaliers CONFESSION OF THEIR DESIGN When first we drew the
King away from his PARLIAMENT.

As also (now our eyes are in some measure opened) that we see there was a
deeper Plot and Design in hand, at that time by the Papists; who made use of
us, to accomplish their own Design, which then lay hid from us, but now
discovers it self: With our Resolution to forsake the Papists.

THE CONVERTED CAVALIER HIS CONFESSION: Of their DESIGN, When they drew the
King away from his PARLIAMENT.
TO confess the truth of our Design, (of us I mean who are Protestants and
in the Kings party) it was at the first) to accomplish these two things.

First, we perceived that the Parliament would not suffer us in our Pattents
which we had obtained of his Majesty, and which had cost us dear; and were
like to be very profitable to us; we therefore were loath to lay them down, and
forgetting the law of the land, we thought that his Majesty might do what he
pleased, and therefore we conceived that if we could draw his Majesty away
from his Parliament, into some remote place, where we might incense and inrage
him against them, by persuading him that they did abridge him of his
prerogative, and then promising him that to maintain his prerogative, we would
assist him with money, horses, and arms, thereby to awe the Parliament; we
thought this being performed, that then we should enjoy still our unlawful
gains by Pattents as we had done formerly, so that being too much leavened
with the Earl of Straffords doctrine, we held that if the Parliament would not
apply themselves to his Majesty, the King then was acquitted before God and
man, and might make use of his prerogative, this is the first thing.

In the second place we perceived that the Parliament would endeavor to reform
the Church government, and take away all superstitious worship out of it, and
that they would amend (if not take away) the book of Common Prayer, which thing
seemed very grievous to us, because we desired to serve God in a formal
worship (it being more pleasing to the flesh) and obey him only with the
outward man, for we thought that even that was pleasing to God, and that we
should now be urged and pressed to a more spiritual worship, which we thought
was quite against the hair, likewise we thought it an high offense, (now after
the book of Common Prayer had been received so many years) that we should go
to condemn our forefathers for the use of it, by taking it away; we likewise
hoped that when by this Design of drawing the King away, we should by force
effect for him that he might by his prerogative do what he pleased, and that
we should have this book of Common Prayer set up (not dreaming all this while
that the Papists had any plot in stirring us up, and likewise, our blind and
superstitious Ministers to stand up for it, though indeed now we well remember
that one said a year ago that they would stir us up to stand for the Common
Prayer till they had effected their own ends, and then we should have Popery
set up, and such a Service Book as they would have imposed on Scotland, (which
now we may see is their plot) in despite of a Puritan Parliament, and all their
Puritan adherents, and that we should have our Lord Bishops again, to curb
those that did speak or do any thing against it, as they did heretofore
(esteeming that they which were such great Scholars were the only Churchmen)
and all that which they did to be divine, and that we ought to observe it; this
was the second thing.

But now we see that they made use of us and our designs but for their own
ends, for they had a deeper plot and design then in hand, then that we were
aware of, which we find now to be this, that they endeavor, to make a division
betwixt us that are (as yet) but Protestants in name, and those that are
Protestants in heart, that so we dashing our selves one against another, both
parties might be consumed, and then (when we are so weakened) they know it will
be an easy matter for them to destroy both parties; that this is their Design
we shall make appear, by these reasons.

1. Because these many years they have (by means of some near to the King) had
familiar recourse to the Court, there to agitate and further any Design that
they had, and likewise were much countenanced and favored; as Mr. Prin in his
late book at large sets forth, that they had their Agents at Court
consisting not only of Jesuits and Priests, but even of our own Bishops, which
should have been fathers to uphold our Religion, they have bin chief
Incendiaries to set the Protestants together by the ears, and the Bishop of
Canterbury by name has employed a Jesuit and a Papist to endeavor to bring us
to the Romish Religion, as it is laid to his charge in his articles of
impeachment; now it is evident that this was the Design that they prosecuted,
because first they did (according as they durst) in words and writings,
disgrace the profession and professors of the Protestant Religion, thereby to
cause profane people to hate, those that were more forward in Religion then
themselves.

2. Because they cannot endure any that are of the Protestant Religion, neither
are they to keep faith with us (as their Religion teaches them) who are
Protestants, but they may murder and destroy us, and for so doing they merit
heaven, then sure it is very madness and folly in us to think that they will
endeavor to establish the true Protestant Religion, which they call heresy,
and howsoever although we can endure their Religion practiced by both great and
small among us, yet if they prevail, they will not leave one that bears the
name of a Protestant alive in our Kingdom, witness what they have done in
Ireland to the Protestants there.

3. Because now their Plot does discover it self, by bringing the Irish forces
over; first the Protestant forces, that so they might not oppose them there,
but come over into England to waste themselves, and such Protestant forces as
were here before: And now they bring (O you Malignants and all my fellow
Cavaliers open your eyes) the Irish Rebels (that have killed so many thousand
Protestants in Ireland) into England daily for to cut our throats, so that now
we may see that whatsoever color they put upon their design, by persuading us
that the King fought for the Protestant Religion and his Prerogative, and that
they that were Papists did but assist him for the accomplishing of the same,
against those which they and we call Puritans, yet they do indeed intend to
bring us under the command of the Pope, and so to take away the Kings
Prerogative, that he would be subject to him, and so although His Majesty do
indeed intend the true Protestant Religion, yet (they prevailing) he shall not
be able to establish it.

The Consideration of these things, is the true Cause why we do now forsake
their Proceedings, and publish it to this intent, That others that still
prosecute the design that we did, may now take notice of the Papists, how they
make use of us to our own destruction; and then I hope, you likewise will
forsake them, as many already have done, who are different from us in their
persons, but more in their affections; and let us now make use of what we see
them do for our best advantage, and that is this; Whereas we see them
encouraging and countenancing and helping them that are zealous in their false
Religion, so let us now unite our selves to those that are zealous for the
Protestant Religion, and as much countenance encourage and help them, both by
our persons and prayers, and in particular this Parliament, which they have
been a means to cause us so much to oppose: For sure, had not God raised them
up as Instruments to stand for this Nation, we had been all lost. And this is
my persuasion, and my Resolution is to adhere to the Kings Forces no more.

FINIS.
