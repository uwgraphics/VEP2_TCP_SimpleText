The Bully WHIG: OR, The Poor Whores Lamentation for the Apprehending OF Sir
THOMAS ARMSTRONG.
To the Tune of, Ah! Cruel Bloody Fate! etc.
I.
AH! Cruel Bloody Tom!
What can thou hope for more,
Than to receive the Doom
Of all thy Crimes before?
For all thy bold Conspiracies
Thy Head must pay the score;
Thy Cheats and Lies,
Thy Box and Dice,
Will serve thy turn no more.
II.
Ungrateful thankless Wretch!
How could thou hope in vain
(Without the reach of Ketch)
Thy Treasons to maintain?
For Murders long since done and past,
Thou Pardons have had store,
And yet would still
Stab on, and kill,
As if thou hop'dst for more.
III.
Yet Tom, ever he would starve,
More Blood resolved to have spilt;
Thy flight did only serve
To justify thy Guilt:
While They whose harmless Innocence
Submit to Chains at home,
Are each day freed,
While Traitors bleed,
And suffer in their room.
IV.
When Whigs a PLOT did Vote,
What Peer Justice fled?
In the FANATIC PLOT
Tom durst not show his head.
Now Sacred Justice rules above,
The Guiltless are set free,
And the Napper's napt,
And Clapper clapped
In his CONSPIRACY.
V.
Like Cain, thou have a Mark
Of Murder on thy Brow;
Remote, and in the dark,
Black Guilt did still pursue:
Nor England, Holland, France, or Spain,
The Traitor can defend;
He will be found
In Fetters bound,
To pay for it in the end.
VI.
Tom might about the Town
Have bully'd, huff'd and roared,
By every Venus known,
Been for a Mars adored:
By friendly Pimping and false Dice
Thou might have longer lived,
Hectored and shamm'd,
And swore and gam'd,
Had thou no Plots contrived.
VII.
Tom once was Cock-a-hoop
Of all the Huffs in Town;
But now his Pride must stoop,
His Courage is pulled down:
So long his Spurs are grown, poor Tom
Can neither fly nor fight;
Ah Cruel Fate!
That at this rate
The 'Squire should foil the Knight!
VIII.
But now no remedy,
It being his just Reward;
In his own Trap, you see,
The Tygre is ensnared:
So may all Traitors fare, till all
Who for their Guilt did fly,
With Bully Tom
By timely Doom
Like him, unpitied die.
