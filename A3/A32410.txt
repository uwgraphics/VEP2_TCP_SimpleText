By the King.

A PROCLAMATION For a General Fast throughout the Realm of England.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking into His Pious and Princely
Consideration, the present unreasonableness of the Weather, whereupon it may be
justly feared, Scarcity and Famine, Sicknesses and Diseases will ensue, if
Almighty God of his great Clemency be not mercifully pleased to avert those
Judgments and Punishments which our many and manifold sins and provocations
have most justly deserved, has, out of His own Religious Disposition,
resolved, and hereby does Command a General and Public Fast to be kept
throughout this whole Kingdom, in such manner as hereafter is directed and
prescribed, that so both Prince and People, even the whole Kingdom, as one man,
may send up their Prayers and Supplications to Almighty God, to divert those
Judgments which the sins of this Land have worthily deserved, and to send us
such seasonable weather, whereby the Fruits of the Earth may be duly received,
and Sicknesses and Contagious Diseases (so justly feared) be prevented.

And to the end so Religious an Exercise may be performed with all decency and
uniformity, His Majesty does hereby (by and with the Advice of His Privy
Council publish and declare to all His loving Subjets, and does straightly Charge
and Command, That on Wednesday next, being the Fifteenth of this instant
January, this Fast be Religiously and Solemnly Observed and Celebrated in the
Cities of London and Westminster, Borough of Southwark, and other places
adjacent, wherein His Majesty in His Royal Person, and with His Royal Family
and Household, will give example to the rest of His People. And that on
Wednesday the Two and twentieth day of the same Month of January, the like be
kept and duly observed throughout the rest of this whole Realm of England, and
Dominion of Wales; And that the same be reverently and decently performed by
all His loving Subjects, as they tender the favor of Almighty God, and would
avoid his just indignation against this Land, and upon pain of such Punishment
as His Majesty can justly inflict upon all such as shall contemn or neglect so
Religious and necessary a Work.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal, this Eighth day of January, in the Thirteenth
year of Our Reign.
God Save the King.

most Excellent Majesty, 1661.
