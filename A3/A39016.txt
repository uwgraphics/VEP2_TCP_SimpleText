AN Excellent New Ballad BETWEEN Tom the Tory, and Toney the VVhigg.
To the Tune of, Shittle - Come - Shite, etc.
GOod People all, both Great and Small,
Come listen to my Story;
There was a Fray, the other Day,
Between a Whigg, and Tory.
For all their Distance, now they met,
Joined in the Stocks together;
You may be sure, 'twas for no good,
That both of them came thither.
The Tory's Name was Lashing Tom;
The Whigg was called Toney;
And yet the Urchin, most Men say,
Wants neither Wit nor Money.
At first they surly were, and grim,
And stiff as as any Quaker;
They looked much like in Hangings old,
The Panther, and the Baker.
A while they only huff't and puff't
At one another, growling:
At last the Curs did spend their Mouths,
And thus they fell a Howling.
Tom. (Quoth Tom) to me, thy Company
Is now as sweet as Honey:
It Is the first Day, I e're could say,
To me you are welcome Toney.
^nce in this Wooden-Cage we meet,
Let Us Con our Notes together:
and prithee Toney tell me how
The Devil has brought thee hither.

Toney. quoth Toney) spare thy Complement,
Thou soon shall be Confounded:
as thou forgot, thou vapouring Sot,
By whom thou were Impounded.
^e tried a Better, and a Worse,
I fairly thee did Master:
am not Conquered, but Betrayed
By Rogues, to this Disaster.

Tom. ^^ose Rogues (quo Tom) thy Creatures were,
Unjust is thy Complaining;
Since 'to this Pen, you are hunted in
By Whelps of thy own Training.
Thy Wickedness, turned thee to Beast,
And hither thee did hurry:
And in this Guise, Acteon-wise,
Thy Hell Hounds thee shall worry.

Toney. Thou wants not Wickedness, but Wit,
To turn it to thy Profit:
Who but a Sot, would hatch a Plot,
And then make nothing of it?
'Twas I was fain to Rear thy Barn,
And bring it to Perfection:
I made the Frighted Nation sue
To me, for my Protection.

Tom. I know (quoth Tom) thou love of old,
The Name of a Protector:
But now with all thy Might and Slight,
Thou art a Baffled Hector.
With all thy Treats, and all thy Cheats,
Still thy Design does faulter:
Thou'st got ( poor Wretch) some Fees for Ketch,
And for thy self a Halter.

Toney. Name not (quoth Toney) that paw thing,
Till thou thy Heels Recover:
For who can tell of Thee or Me,
Who first will be Turned over?
Tom look to it, when Commons Sit,
Lest then I take thee Napping:
I nothing fear, who am so near
My Honest Friends of Wapping.

What more they said, or what they did,
Deserves not to be reckoned:
Then come away; but first let us pray,
God bless King Charles the Second.
FINIS.
