The Contents of the Book.
200 Golden sayings by Henery Church. 300 Silver sayings, and the Conscionable
Politician, by Nathanaell Church.
To the Honorable, William Pen, Vice Admiral to the English Navy, whom God
preserve and prosper.
Honored Sir,
YOur favorable Expressions of tender Charity to me, have neither been few nor
small; the Commemoration whereof might well command your unworthy Servant into
a better and larger Testimony of your noble Generosity, and my humble
Acknowledgement. But I must act now not according to your meritorious Worth,
but my slender Ability.

It Is pity that Good Will should loose any thing, but what is not worth a
Keeping: much less then should well-do^ pass thanklesse on Earth, which goes
not rewardlesse in Heaven.

Sir, I cannot crowd your Beneficence into an Epistle, nor Gods miraculous
Memorials into the most voluminous Folio.

It Is not unknown what a anguishing Distemper persecuted me from Country to
City; banished me from shore, and almost from my Self; gave me many Months
Chase at Sea, emptied me of comfort, and filled me with Complaints: In so much
as a Pining Body and a repining Soul (the Lord forgive me) were mine
inseparable Companions for a long time. But I will be discontented at nothing
but my own Discontent.

Ever since I was your Honors Weak and Worthless Chaplain in the Lion,
Centurion, Fairfax, Triumph, and the James, I wanted nothing but Thankefulness;
nor could I complain of any thing but my own Unbelief. I was among you in
fear, and weakness, and much trembling, that I may borrow Paul's words 1 Cor.
2.3. though I cannot utter them in that more spiritual sense, that He does.

But I may well sing to God, Psalm. 103.1,2,3,4,5. verses, and I pray God make
my Life (which he has graciously lengthned) a Comment upon the whole Psalm.

When I think of my Restoratives for Soul and Body, that Counsel,
Encouragement and Comfort, which your prudent Head, your tender Eye, your
honest heart, your liberal Hand, your faithful Tongue administered unto me, I
say (from the soul of a Nathanael) For my Life I cannot thank you too much,
nor GOD enough And indeed, while I am telling you stories of your own
Kind-heartednesse, methinks I hear you reply on this poor crooked Stoper,
look up higher to the LIVING GOD, and say to that the same CELESTIAL
EXCELLENTISSIMO, What shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men! Job 7.20.
What shall I render to the Lord for All his benefits toward me? Ps. 116.^. I
have tried many helps for my Recovery, but all to no purpose. Now I feel, and
find that the Lords way is in the Sea, and his Path in the mighty waters, and
his foote-steps are not known, Psalm. 77.^. To this good and great God (from
whose Ocean you borrow your streams of Bounty) I recommend your Honor, and all
yours, both by Sea and Land, humbly desiring him to bind up your Soul in the
Bundle of Life, to let the Blessing of Him that was ready to perish come upon
you (as Job 9.3.) The LORD Register you into the Number of those whose Bowels
yearn to the distressed, wh se Hands open to the Afflicted, and whom None is
able to reward, but He, who has Most and deserves All, yet is contented with a
little in sincerity; in whom I rest,

Your Honors often engaged And still indebted, Nathanael Church.

Prevention to the Reader.
FRiends, do not think that these brief Sentences were drawn out of those
Texts of Scripture quoted after them. For the Sayings were written some Years
before any Quotations were made. And those places of Scripture were only set
down to show how near these rational Maxims come to divine Verity, and how
nigh Kin Faith and Reason are.

I Call my Fathers Golden sayings, and my own Silver, because his have the
Priority, not only of Time, but also of Estimate: and besides mine Excel his
in Nothing but Number, as Children do the Parents, and as Stars do the Sun and
Moon.

As for my own Sentences, they have little or nothing in them that I have
begged, or borrowed. Nay I fear, it will be said, that they have too much of my
Self in them. But though they are like the Cobweb, spun out of my own Bowels,
yet some of them well applied may stench a bleeding Conscience.

They are (most of them) common Notions, but never the worse for that: For the
Sun, the Day, the Air, the Fire, the Water, the Earth, and the Gospel are not
the worse for being common, but the better. Boni proprium est esse common, It Is
proper to that which is good, to be common: And that which does good to many, is
more excell^ and more divine, ((...), as Aristot.) then that, that does good to
one only.

They are Trilineals, or three lines a piece (most of them) and so more
portable for the Memory.

They are Pentad's, or just five in a Page: so that a man, (though straightened
in Time, notwithstanding) may read to a Period presently, and carry a Theme to
think on with him, as an Antidote against worse thoughts.

The very blank Spaces between them will prove advantageous to one that has any
Good-husbandry, for there he may interscribe any other compendious Apothegme,
at Pleasure and Leisure.

As for my failings, I hope they will prove either but ordinary, or but few.
But I could wish this were the worst use I had made of my Pen, I hope it is not
the best.

And he that every day does mend,
Shall sure be perfect in the end
Much good may they do thee, Who ever thou art, Friend or Foe: so says He, who
is (in his Prayers to God for thee,)

Thine, (whether thou will or no) N. C.

To the Reader.
READER, The have here a little Cabinet,
Or Jewels rare: a precious Ring be set
With richest Stones: a Nose-gay that does yield
A sweet and fragrant Smell. Each common Field
Has not such Flowers as these. To tell thee true,
Here Is nothing does accost thee, but what is new.
These are not Foreign Proverbs Englished:

REeader, Thou Have here a birth, which as I gather,
For it is conception ows to Son and Father:
An Issue which for'ts Mid wifery does stand
Mixtly indebted both to Sea and Land.
A lawful Prize. But o the Devil of Gain!
One Pocket now two Churches can contain!
Well. Yet beware thou, how thy Censure blots
The Author: there is no Church without its spots.
He Is a Nathanael, credit me, and I Will
Avouch, when he wrote these, there was no guile.
Possessed his heart. Come, show thy self to be
A Friend to Church, and I Will be so to thee.
But if thou have a place for wonder fit,
Give it the CHURCH and COMMON WEALTH of WIT.

To his Ingenous Friend Mr. Nathanael Church on his Pocket-Companion.
Whilst thou was toss't upon the waving Main,
Me-thought Noes Ark was floating once again.
Thy Friends on Land were troubled much for thee,
To prove their Churches visibility.
Now if I want thy good society,
Thy book mean while shall my Companion be.
Where whiles thy Hand speaks to mine Eye: so here.
Mine eye becomes thy Hands Interpreter.
If great Books be great evils, thou ha^ sh^wn
A remedy: Thine's but a little one.
Since Coyn's grown scant, 'twas wisely done by thee,
To keep our Pockets from vacuity.

Author ad Patrem jam 17. annos defunctum.
WEll, I Will drop one Encomiasticke, rather
Then by a Clownish silence robb my Father.
Lest. if by me that name be vilifi'd,
I Am named sacriligious parricide,
Though Him to praise, there needs no Pains, or Skill.
Of whom his very Foes could not speak ill.
Here needs no Florishes, go, cunning Pates,
Go, sleep: His own works praise him in the Gates.
Nay all the Rhetoric I can devise,
Is but to multiply Tautologies.
His Theologick Miscellanies can
Him studious prove, to know both GOD and MAN.
His Coffer long ago is dead and rotten:
The Good man's Treasure must not be forgotten.
His Christian letters most eleborate,
Now out of print, I Would buy at any Rate.
Mean while I will be thankful, not repine,
My Fathers Gold and Silver both are Mine.

God is merciful, therefore I must be thankful.

435. A little that is good, is as much as I desire, and more then I deserve:

Mercurius Desideratus. THE WISE DOVE, OR TAME SERPENT; viz. The Conscionable
Politician Compendiously characterised in Prose and Verse.

By Nathanael Church.

Matthew. 10.16. Behold I send you forth as Sheep in the midst of Wolves: be ye
therefore prudent as Serpents, and sincere as Doves.

Prudens Simplicitas
-- Martial. Printed in the Year, 1657.

The wise Dove, or Tame Serpent.
HAppy is the Man's whose Meditation, are pure, whose Discourses are savory, and
whose lise is holy: who speaks as he thinks, and does as he speaks. Who is a
coward in Sin, but bold in Godliness.

1. The man is blessed, who dares be good
From Sur-face to the Center:
Who feels no Courage in his blood
On sin to make Adventure.
2. Whom neither Sight can entice, nor Might enforce to do Evil: But he does
Good, and speaks Truth even gratis, and is peremptorily resolved to be honest
in spite of Earth and Hell.

2. Who can endure to be a Saint
Amids the Devils Traps:
Who is not honest by Constraint;
Nor speaks Truth by mere Haps.
3. Whose Promises never outrun his Performances for want of Forecast, or
after-Care. Whose Designs may be naked, and yet not ashamed. Who is not sad at
glad-tydings, nor coyns Impostures to sing his own party into a Fools-dream.

3. Who does his Words with Deeds relieve
Whose Plots need no Disguise;
Who at Good news does never Grieve,
Nor Lull himself with Lies.
4. Who bends his Mind to shoot at Perfection, though the Arrows of his
Endeavor fall short. Who loves not to plead Ignorance. Who conquers his
Enemies by Patience, and murders Injuries with Courtesies.

4. Who would be better then he can:
who sees no need of Blindness.
Who turns his Foes Physician,
and kills Revenge with Kindness.
5. Who desires, to be both to GOD and Man a sincere Nathanael, a true
Churchmember, in Faith and Affection, without Malice, though not without
Evil. Whose Humanity and Humility can never be Bankrupt.

5. Who is upright to God above,
Down right to Man below:
Who still pays All the debt of Love,
And yet the same does Owe.
6. Whose well doing wearies out all his bad Pay-masters. Who sweates out the
malignancy of Idleness. Who is free hearted, and public Spirited, and robs
not Others of Himself.

6. Who can do well spite of Ill Will;
WVho slays sloth with Labor:
Who lives as lent Himself until,
But given to his Neighbor.
7. Who never prides himself in temporary trifles, or future uncertainties. Who
is not mad, but modest. Who scorns impudently to swagger with what his Master
lent him.

7. Who boasts not of Muck and Rags;
Nor vaunteth of To morrow;
Whose Head is tame, who never brags
Of what he did but borrow.
8. Who furbushes his virtuous Habits by frequent Acts, and lets not his Time,
nor Thoughts run at wast. Who thinks himself less then the least Mercy; and
yet the whole world is not enough to fill his Inside.

8. Who never lets his Graces rust,
Nor Time away be hurled;
Who counts himself more vile then Dust
yet better then the world.
9. Who does not invisibly wound his Brothers good name with Words worse then
Blows. Who is more Conscionable then most men desire to be, and yet is angry
with himself for being no better.

9. Who whets not's Tongue upon his spleen
to cut an absent Friend.
Who is as good as e're was seen;
And yet he still does mend,
10. Who whines not after his Neighbors glittering dust; nor is toy-sicke,
like an bard to be pleased, Changeling, or incorrigible Self-humourist; who
cares not so much for Liberty, as for Conscience.

10. Who never fondling like does cry
For others Lands, or House:
Who in his Christian Liberty
Is Conscientious.
11. Who aspires not to a fair Place by foul Play: who is not beggered by
Plenty, nor made a Miser through Prosperity: who strives not to make the golden
MINE a Possessive, nor poor Men's GETTINGS A Participle.

11. Who grows not great without Gods
Whom Riches cannot Pine:
Who at vast Gold heaps looks a-skew, leave
And, but in jest, says, MINE.
12. Who magnifies the Creator, and parvifies the Creatures: who sets his Face
toward the Sun of Righteousness, and by turning his back upon transitory
Delights, makes them shadow-like flock after him.

12. Who feels the Brightness of Gods love
Strike all Earths glory dim:
Who mainly seeks the things Above,
And things below seek Him.
13. Who is not cunning enough to deceive Himself, nor foolish enough to let
others deceive him. Who is of a Serpentine prudence, lest Another should hurt
Him, and of a Columbine sincerity, lest He should hurt Another.

13 Who Christ's true way of Life does tread,
Uniting Grace with Art
Who is a Serpent in his Head,
A Turtle in his Heart.
14. Whose Thoughts are like deep, though clear Waters, that may be seen
into unto the middle, but not through to the bottom. Who is able to give, and
willing to take good Advice.

14 Who is Profound, yet plain in speech
To those that cannot discern:
Who is both wise enough to Teach,
And humble enough to Learn.
15. Who studies not to cheat his own Soul, nor wearies himself with Frivolous
Impertinencies, neglecting the one thing necessary. But being sensible of his
own nothingnesse, esteems Christ All in All.

15 Who is not stuffed with foolish craft
His own soul to deseate:
Who is imperfect, but well graft,
In him who is Complete.
16. Who is wise to do Good, bu^ to do Mischief has no Knowledge* Who by his
prudentiall Innocence befooles the profound Politician, and confutes the grand
Impostor.

16. Who is in God a knowing man,
A very Child in evil:
Who silly-simple is, yet can
Out wit both Man and Devil.
17. Who the older he grows, the newer he is daily; and the more decrepit and
crocked his Body is, the more straight and upright is his Mind. Who is both
inferior to the Worms; and yet superior to the Angels.

17 Who grows Young by Antiquity,
And lives when he is dead:
Who is but wormes-meat: yet more high
then Angels rears his Head.
18 Who by Faith and Love disbosomes himself of all Self-interest: improves
all he has for Gods glory, who turns all to his good. Who, when we have seen
and heard the best of him, still is far better within doors. Such a ones
company Angels long for.

18. Who reckons not himself his own;
But all things else are his:
Who lives as unto God well known,
That man is ripe for Bliss.
