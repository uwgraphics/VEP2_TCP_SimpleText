SERGEANT MAJOR JAMES CHVDLEIGH HIS DECLARATION TO HIS COUNTRYMEN.

Printed, M. DC. XL III:

Mr James Chudleigh his Declaration.
Dear Countrymen.
BEcause the scandalous reports of certain factious hot-brained Persons in the
City of Exeter, have imputed Gods visitation of our sins upon the Army late
at Stratton, to treachery of mine: I shall beg so much of your patience, as to
inform your selves from this Paper, the true state of that affair. 'Twas not
without excessive continued pains, that I had put that Tumultuous body into a
serviceable posture in the field, and I appeal to any man of so much honesty
and honor, as dares speak truth in the behalf of a dejected Prisoner,
whether I was not always busied in the heat of the Skirmish where ever it
happened to be, from the very beginning till I was totally forsaken, both by the
Officers and Soldiers, except those that dyed by me, and the Battle lost some
testimony, wherein was my Cane broken in my hand by a shot, my Horse shot under
me, and at last a hurt in my head, whereby I lost some blood. Thus (miserable
in all appearance) being absolutely destitute of any thing, but the protection
of my God which never yet failed me, I charged single through a division of
Musketeers, till I came up close to the Officer that led them, who I took for
Sir Bevill Grenvile, for his back parts were very like him, and instead of
using my Arms to take his life, which was then very much in my power, (though
not without a certain loss of mine own, for all the Soldiers presently upon
the stop enclosed me round,) I yielded my self into his hands, and I found him
a most gallant Gentleman, for when I had delivered my Sword, he received many
blows to bear them off from me, and suppressed the rage of the Soldiers
toward me, with the hazard of his own life, his name is Lewis Tremaine,
Ensign to Sir Bevill Grenvile, to whom, being close at hand with a stand of
Pikes, he led me, and I shall ever acknowledge as long as I breath in spite of
the Malignity of these factious Spirits in Exeter, or such as they have
corrupted by their Hypocrisy in other parts of this County, that I received so
much humanity and noble favor from Sir Bevill Grenvile, and the rest of the
Commanders of the Cornish Army, as made that a greater grief to me to have
been an Enemy to so much gallantry and virtue, then that now I was a Prisoner;
nevertheless the sad estate which I conceived my Countrymen to be in, from
whom it had pleased God, for reasons above my reach, thus to withdraw his
favor, wounded yet deeper my bleeding heart, and so much the more, because I
resented heavily the Justice of the Cause, which we had labored to Support,
being as I conceived, the Just Rights of our gracious King and his Subjects,
limited by the Laws and the Purity of the true Protestant Religion, which the
high Court of Parliament had instructed us, these Gentlemen whose hands I was
thus fallen into, had endeavored to corrupt, and I was sufficiently sensible,
that those moral virtues which I saw they were endowed with, in so eminent a
degree, might be companions for ought I knew (though hardly credible) of
deceitful hearts; and that the Iustee of the Quarrel on either side is not
always demonstrated by the chance of War, thus releeving my perplexity with
sadness, and resolving to spend my days in grief, till it should please God
to put an end to the miserable Distractions of this wretched Kingdom, I was
visited by some of the most eminent Commanders of the Army, with whom I fell
into discourse of these very points; wherein all of us agreed upon the
necessity of preservation of the Law in the privilege that it gives this
Nation in Parliament, as well as in the Just Prerogative which it allows His
Royal Majesty, without which this Kingdom is necessarily subject to Arbitrary
Government, and the Rights both of the King and People are vanished into an
Aerie title. But 'twas not long till we came to this conclusion, That as evil
Counsels had heretofore been prevalent to the prejudice of the Commonwealth,
so the satisfaction given by His Majesty was exceeding great and beyond the
expectation of all moderate men; That the objections against His Majesty's
Counsel of continual endeavors at present to force the Parliament by Arms,
are clearly answered by His Majesty's many Protestations, and for the
fulfilling of those Protestations to accommodate the differences of the
Kingdom, His Majesty will not stick to give any assurance that shall be thought
reasonable; and likewise all the Commanders of this Army are content to put it
under their hands, and to take a solemn oath as punctual and as strong as can
be invented, that when soever His Majesty shall be drawn by any Counsel or
means whatsoever, to neglect those Protestations, that then they will totally
desert the Service they are engaged in, and for the present they will be
content to use the whole power, which His Majesty has invested them with, to
give a free pardon to all such in these Western Counties as will lay down
Arms, and be content to be governed by the known Laws settled by Act of
Parliament; and what assurance soever shall be demanded on His Majesty's
behalf for the settling of a Religious, Honorable, and a firm Peace they are
ready to give. Now whether this Inclination toward the Peace and Justice of
this Kingdom has possessed these Gentlemen from the beginning of the War, or
whether by the continued dispute of the difference by which the Kingdom is
divided, the matter is now so anotomised? as that the quintessence of truth
extract from partiality to either side, is eminently perspicuous, or else
whether the blood shed betwixt these two Counties by misunderstandings one of
another, which cannot but move all Christian hearts to a Compassionate
beseeching of the Almighty God to sheath his sword, has had stronger operation
upon the hearts and Consciences of these noble Gentlemen, then the factions of
Exeter are likely to admit of on their part, is not in my opinion material to
stand in debate of, only I conceive my self bound in Conscience for truths
sake, to assure all honest well meaning Christians upon the hopes that I have
of salvation, and upon the faith and honor of a Gentleman and a Soldier, that
I never saw an Army freer from vice, nor more religiously inclined, then I
perceive the whole Genious of this Army to be, nor did I ever see more heartily
clear and earnest expressions of affection to a religious and a just Peace
then the Commanders of this Army are full off: more then which, (with so
ingenious offers of the means to conclude that) cannot possibly be expected
from humane flesh, and though it has been accounted Treason in the opinion of
the factious Tumult of the City of Exeter, whose interest has ever showed it
self against any Peace but an absolute Conquest, and an utter extirpation of
those that unconvict, they do but once think ungodly, that I should represent
my knowledge of the state of this matter to those Deputy-Lievtenants that I
conceived in all respects fittest to judge of that, and to recommend it to the
whole County, yet my duty to God and to my Country, will not give me leave to
obscure so fair a means of the happiness of this Kingdom for any scandal
whatsoever, or to prove my self in the face of Heaven so cowardly a Christian,
as to comply with damnable hypocrisy against so clear a truth: who knows not
that nothing will be so certain and necessary a destruction to the Country as
to continue it the seat of War, and what moderate man is there, that cannot
see that nothing in the World could have extorted from this Army in the
glorious Condition, that it now is, such a gallant offer of a Religious,
honorable, and a firm Peace, but their own Nobleness and sincerity of heart
toward truth, and the real welfare of the Commonwealth. Let us not involve
our selves with the obstinacy of a few opinionated men, whiles it is apparenr as
the case stands, how that their Cause is accompanied with nothing of Religion,
but it is abused name, what Religion is there now in Cornwall but the same that
we profess, or what bondage is there to those that do not wilfully thrust
themselves into it? Let us but defer the cutting of one another throats,
till novelties in Law and in Religion begin to show themselves. We are then as
capable to dye for the defense of truth, as now for the suspicion, the power of
the sword being still entrusted in our hands. Many a well meaning Christian
takes a by path to Heaven, and knows not that he wanders, but, Oh, the
irrecoverable unhappines of those that refuse to be led into the way, I know it
concerns the interest of those that have set themselves against Peace, with
such as they are pleased to call the wicked, how undeservedly soever, to raise
scandalls upon me, and I am well informed that the report of my betraying the
Army at Stratton, was invented after the view of my Letters to my Father, with
Sir John Bamfield, and Sir Nicholas Martin to accommodate the differences of
these Counties, for which the Citizens of Exeter have beyond all example
Committed the Herald that was employed, upon the false pretense of eating
Scroales of paper, and have cast a jealousy upon some of those Gentlemen that
hitherto have been thought by all the World far more worthy then such
Creatures as themselves are, to steer the affairs of the Commonwealth in
these parts, but as I never avoided danger to serve my Country when I lead
them in the field, so I will now press through all difficulties in spite of
opposition to mediate, and by all honest means to prosecute its Peace, and such
as shall appear to unite in my opinion, I am ready to lead or to follow, or to
Comrade with, to reduce this obstinate handful in the City of Exeter, that
are the only means to deny their Country its Capacity of so great a blessing;
and herein I am resolved to boast the loyalty which I owe His Majesty as well
as my dear affection to you that have thus far entrusted me with your lives,
and for my behavior at Stratton I refuse no man's testimony, of those that
durst put themselves so far into danger as to be eye witnesses, but for my
Lord of Stamford, and such others as ran away, whose Treason really it was, I
know that concerns their interest to second this accusation upon me, having no
other way to extenuate their intolerable Cowardice, but because they are People
that I am never likely to meet with in the field, I leave them to the Scourge
of their own Conscience, and to pass the time in making Aldermen, and women
believe them valiant, whiles all the world besides knows the contrary. And now
I challenge Malice it self to accuse me in all this, of the least Circumstance
of untruth or fallacy, so I beseech God to dispose you to accept of such a
Peace, as for ought I know will shortly be denied you upon your knees, And that
the groans of this bleeding Country may not rise up in judgment against the
Barbarism of those, that by imprisoning the messenger of Peace, have
endeavored to destroy the Balsome that should cure the wounds, which for ought
I see themselves have made.

FINIS.
