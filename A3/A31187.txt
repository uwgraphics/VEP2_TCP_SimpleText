True News from Hull.
IT is not unknown to the whole kingdom with what violence and spleen the
good Town of Kingston upon Hull has been laid at by the Malignants of it,
being the most famous and considerable Port of the whole North parts, those
perverse Counselors intimating to His Majesty that it was the mainest Engine
to advance their designs that could possible be fastened upon His Majesty;
therefore coming thither in person with his Cavaliers demanded entrance into
the Town, which Sir John Hotham the Governor instituted by Order of
Parliament, though he paid His Majesty all the due respects of a Loyal
Subject, refused to do, well knowing the danger might arrive to the
Commonwealth if those enemies to the State, the Cavaliers, should get
possession of that excellent Haven; by which means they might give free
admittance to any foreign forces, their malice should call into their aids
against the just proceedings of the Parliament. This action, howsoever the King
was pleased to misconstrue and take as an indignity to himself, was censured
just and honorable by the Parliament, who furnished the said Sir John Hotham
with Forces for his defense against those malignants in case they should draw
the King with His Army against him and the said Town, which they effected,
though the strength of the Town and courage of the Governor enforced them to
wave the siege of the place. Since there has been diverse practices made against
the said Town and the life of Sir John Hotham* as has been confessed; but none
of them suiting to effect God, preventing their wicked purposes, the malignants
in and about that riding of Yorkshire, thinking that now the business of Hull
had layne so long dead, Sir John Hotham and his Garrison were grown careless
and so fearelesse of any attempt could be made against them. Upon these false
Principles therefore* grounding their erroneous opinion they made cock-sure of
the effecting their determination, some fifty or threescore Gentlemen being
engaged in this affair, their servants and followers completing them the
number of 100 persons, not doubting to find some malignants in Hull assistant
to their treachery, over they went to Grimsby in Lincolnshire, from thence
meaning to pass the Humber to Hull in the disguised habits of Seamen
undiscovered: so coming thither in diverse Companies by two and two, to avoid
suspicion to get passage over to the Town, some day one, and some day another
in several Barques; where they (when all met) resolved to evade questioning or
suspect, never to be seen together, not so many as three in a Company till that
very night they were to put their fatal determination in execution. Some of
them had most mind, if it were possible, to murder Sir John Hotham as he should
issue out of his house; others, if it were possible, to seize the Magazine of
the Garrison or blow it up; but both these opinions, as too uncertain and full
of danger to themselves was rejected and their resolution fixed on this, that
seeming saylors and such as wanted employment, they should pretend they were
Mariners had served in Denmark and the Hans Towns, and being now out of
service they came to offer themselves to Sir John to be as soldiers for the
defense of the Town, if he accepted them, as there was no reason nor
likelihood but he would, that then they would some night, having the watch,
seize upon some part of the Town, and turn the Ordnance against them, that
should oppose them till some Troops of my Lord of Cumberland who was
pre-acquainted with their intentions, should enter the Town and destroy the
Garrison, or else, if it happened so luckily that they could surprise either of
the blocke-houses or forts, that then they should not doubt to master the town
with much ease, or beat it down about the garrison and Inhabitants cares. This
resolved upon, as the safest way for atchieving their practice, they went some
ten of the likeliest fellows of them to Sir John's Lieutenant to offer their
own and their companions services to their Captain the Governor, alleging,
that they were come out of Denmark, and had rather hazard their lives for the
safety of the Commonwealth in that town, then any other place, the Lieutenant
glad of obtaining so many proper men (the garrison being much debilitated, by
reason of drawing out good store of the best experienced soldiers to furnish
Master Hothams Regiment for the service at York) went to Sir John and
acquainted him with the state of the matter, who gave him order to afford them
courteous entertainment, and to disperse them for the re-inforcement of those
companies that had most need of supplies. The Lieutenant performing Sir John's
Commands, distributed twenty of them into their Sergeant Majors company, that
was very weak, ten into their own Company, and so the rest as occasion served
into every Company that wanted men in the town. The ten that were in Sir John's
own Company, the better to insinuate themselves into favor, demeaning
themselves very civilly, and upon all occasions, either of watch or other
service, most exactly performing their duties; so that they were in very good
repute, both with Sir John himself, his Lieutenant, and all his inferior
officers; the other that were in the Sergeant Majors and other Companies,
carrying themselves with the same cunning, spending their money very liberally
among their fellow soldiers, which they pretended they brought out of Denmark
with them, so to ingratiate themselves among them, that they might with greater
ease facilitate their purpose, intending to draw as many as they possible could
to their party, yet very cautious of discovering their design to any, lest it
should be made known to Sir John, giving the Earl of Cumberland by a private
and subtle messenger they had in the town, and receiving encouragement from
him to go on courageously, promising them, that when they should signify to
him the probable time for surprizall of the town he would not fail against
that very night to have some able troops in readiness, which about the dead
of the same night should be in arms before that gate which they should open.
All things going on thus without suspicion, they continued a whole fortnight in
this manner, watching (like wild beasts for their prey) for all occasions that
might quickly furnish and effect their wicked intentions, meaning also, as some
advised inhumanity, to fire the town, that while the Inhabitants were employed
in extinguishing that, they might with more ease let in their accomplices the
enemy. On Sunday therefore the seven and twentieth of November, most of them
being to be upon the watch at one of the Courts of guard close to the gate that
opens toward York. So on that night they resolved to ^^n the horse, or lose
the saddle; and therefore by the aforesaid intelligence gave notice to the
E^^le of their resolution, intimating the possibility they had of effecting
their design, if his Lordship did not fail to send them those which they
could easily let into the town. The Earl sent back the messenger with
assured and certain promises, not to fail against the time; this being on the
Sunday before the fatal night, as it happened to themselves: for the troops
with each a Musketier behind, to the number of three hundred men, advancing
before day, by a back way out of York, before they could recover the way to
Hull, were espied by some of my Lord Fairefaxes Sentinels, and set upon by his
horse troops, to it they went very roundly, and fought it out very val^^^tly
with our men who assaulted them on all sides, beating them down from their
horses without mercy, so that after the slaughter of their chief Commander,
quitting their Musketeers, who were all either slain, or taken prisoners, the
surviving horsemen betook themselves to flight, but were son arrowly surprised,
and charged so hotly by our men that being impossibled of escape, they were all
slain, or taken prisoners, not one getting away to carry tidings back to the
Earl of their disaster, being brought before the General the Lord Fairefax,
and strictly examined, Letters were found about some of them, that testified
whither they were employed, and to what purpose. My Lord Fairefax and Master
Hotham amazed at that unexpected danger which was so nearly iminent on Hull,
dispatched with all speed a Post thither to Sir John, giving him all the
intelligence they could possible of this mischief, but could not discover
their number, that being not expressed in the Letters. Sir John a wise and
understanding Gentleman, no whit terrified with these tidings, cast about to
prevent the danger, musing who the men should be that should be so treacherous;
of the fidelity of the townsmen and garrison soldiers he had no reason to
doubt, at last these Saylors came into his mind, and weighing their manner of
coming thither, and their general deportment since their arrival, he and
his Council, absolutely determined they might be men in whom this treason
lurked, and understanding that most of them were to be upon the watch that
night at York Port, he then concluded it was so, and resolved to give the
Gudgeons line til they were fast caught by the gills, commanding his own
guard, and an hundred more of able soldiers, when the watch was set, to have
an eye to that gate, and to seize these treacherous villains, who making sure
account to surprise the town, at the hour of the watch, were repayr'd to
their stations, and because the keys of the gates were carried to the
Governor, they had provided petars to blow them open, expecting only the
signal from my Lord of Cumberland, which was a light in the fields; for which,
some of them watched on the rampires. A Millar dwelling without the town,
going to his Mill about twelve of clock with a candle and a Lantern, gave
them the signal they expected, and imagining the troops were come to the gate,
they went, and were fastening two pet^rs to it; when Sir John's guard, who had
waited their attempt, taking them in the manner, laid hold or them, some of
them dre^ their Swords, and shot off their Muskets, but hurt not a man of
ours, two of them only being slain, who had Crucifix^^ about their necks,
the rest bound and committed to prison* discovered their plot, for which they
are to suffer condign punishment.

FINIS.
