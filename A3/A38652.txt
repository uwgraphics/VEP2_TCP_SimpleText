A COPY OF A Letter from the Earl of ESSEX, By Order of the Pretended Houses
of PARLIAMENT, TO PRINCE RUPERT: WITH HIS HIGHNESS ANSWER THEREUNTO.

OXFORD, Printed by Leonard Lichfield, Printer to the University, 1645.

For his Highness PRINCE RUPERT GENERAL.
SIR,
THE two Houses of Parliament have received Information, that, because the
Committee at Shrewesbury caused Thirteen Irish Rebels, taken in Hostility
against the Parliament, to suffer Death, according to an Ordinance of
Parliament herewith sent, Therefore by your express Commands, Thirteen
English Protestants who had Quarter given them by your Officers that took them
Prisoners, were notwithstanding murdered upon cool blood, and that you have
resolved to proceed in the same manner for the future. A Relation and
Resolution so strange, that the truth thereof might justly be suspected, were
it not verified by letters from that Commit of the 24th of March last, to the
Speaker of the House of Commons, and by a Letter of the 23. of March, sent to
the same Committee by your direction, and subscribed by one Ralph Goodwin your
Secretary, (as is informed) which does own and avow the Fact. And therefore the
two Houses of Parliament, being deeply affected with such cruel Massacres
committed upon their Protestant Brethren, whose Lives they value as their own,
have commanded me to acquaint your Highness, that it is evident by undoubted
Proof, that the Rebels of Ireland (what ever they pretended to some on this
side the Sea) did really intend by that odious Rebellion, to wrest that Kingdom
for ever, from the Crown of England, to the utter disherison of the King and
His Posterity; And to extirpate the English Nation and Protestant Religion, and
for that purpose have solicited by their Agents, the bringing over of
Powerful Aids from Foreign Parts, to assist them in this their intended
Conquest; And have set up the Spanish Colors publicly, both at Wexford, and
Gallway; Have caused their Captains, Officers and others, to make Oath before
their Titular Clergy, That they shall not suffer any English, or Protestant, to
live in that Kingdom. That they prosecuted this horrid design, by murdering,
hanging, *
drowning, burning * alive, and starving within few Months, in one Province,
one hundred fifty four Thousand of harmles British Protestants, Men, Women,
and Children, without distinction of Age or Sex, without any provocation
given, but living securely by them in a full and settled Peace. That the King
first by Proclamation attested by His own Royal Signature, and Privy Seal,
has Procl^^ed them Traitors and Rebels; and since that time, both King and
Parliament, by four several Acts of Parliament, have declared and styled them
in the same manner; And further His Majesty by Act of Parliament, has
consented, That all Pardons granted to them or any of them, before Attaindor,
shall be void. Now that such bloody, barbanous Miscreants, so odious both to
God and men, so obnoxious to Law and Justice, (even by the Judgment of both
sides) coming out of Ireland, (where they neither did give nor receive
Quarter) to burn and lay wast this Kingdom, as they have done that, should
after all this, be admitted to receive Quarter here* and consequently be made
equal in Exchange with the English Nation, and Protestants; The Lords and
Commons of the Parliament of England, cannot with Religion, Honor, or Justice,
in any sort consent unto it. And have commanded me to let your Highness, and
all other Commanders on that side know, That if hereafter, upon executing the
Irish Rebels, in pursuance of that just Ordinance, any unjust Pretext shall be
made, to murder in cool blood any Officer, Soldier, or Seaman, in the
service of the Parliament; That the two Houses have resolved, and do hereby
declare, that for every Officer, Soldier, and Seaman so causelessly massacred,
they shall and must (though with deep sorrow and reluctance) cause so many of
the Prisoners remaining in their Power, to be put to Death in the same manner.
And therefore do earnestly desire your Highness, and all other your inferior
Commanders, to forbear by such prodigious Cruelty to embase the value of the
English Nation, which they are confident will be resented with indignation,
even by those English Protestants, who are for the present, deceived into Arms
against the Protestant Religion, and the Parliament of England, To whom they
shall be ready to allow Quarter, and equal exchange as before, and for whom
they daily pray, That Almighty God would open their eyes, and reduce them into
the right way. Sir, this being all I have in Command, I take my leave, and
remain

Your humble Servant ESSEX.
Westminster the 4th of April, 1645.
The Copy of the Order mentioned in the foregoing Letter.
Die Iovis, 24. October. 1644.
THe Lords and Commons assembled in the Parliament of England, do declare,
That no Quarter shall be given hereafter, to any Irishman, nor, to any Papists
what soever, borne in Ireland, which shall be taken in Hostility against the
Parliament, either upon the Sea, or within this Kingdom, or Dominion of Wales;
And therefore do Order and Ordain, That the Lord General, Lord Admiral, and
all other Officers and Commanders, both by Sea and Land, shall except all
Irish-men and all Papists borne in Ireland, out of all Capitulations Agreements
and Compositions, hereafter to be made with the Enemy; And shall upon the
taking of every such Irishman, or Papist borne in Ireland, as aforesaid,
forthwith put every such Person to death. And it is further ordered and Ordained,
That the Lord General, Lord Admiral and the Committees of the several
Counties, do give speedy Notice hereof to all subordinate Officers and
Commanders by Sea and Land respectively, who are hereby required to use their
utmost Care and Circumspection, That this Ordinance be duly executed. And
lastly, the Lords and Commons do declare, That every Officer and Commander by
Sea or Land, that shall be remiss or negligent in observing the Tenor of this
Ordinance, shall be reputed a Favourer of that bloody Rebellion of Ireland, And
shall be liable to such condign punishment, as the Justice of both Houses of
Parliament shall inflict upon him.

For the Earl of ESSEX General.
MY LORD,
I Received your Lordships Letter, of the fourth of this Month, on the
eleventh; and cannot but wonder that it should seem strange to the two Houses,
that I should cause those Prisoners, which were taken in Arms against His
Majesty, to be used in the same manner, and by the same measure, as His
Majesty's good Subjects, taken Prisoners in the act of their duty, are used by
those that take them. Those Soldiers of mine that were barbarously murdered
in cold blood, after Quarter given to them at Shrewsbury, were those, who,
during the time they were in Ireland, served His Majesty stoutly, constantly
and faithfully against the Rebels of that Kingdom, and after the Cessation,
they were by His Majesty's Command transported to serve Him in this, where they
honestly performed the duty of Soldiers; and therefore I were unworthy of the
Command I hold under His Majesty, if upon so high a provocation, and so unheard
of an act of injustice, as the putting those poor honest men to death, I had
not let the Authors of that Massacre know, that their own men must pay the
price of such acts of Inhumanity, and be used as they use their Brethren: and
therefore I caused the like number (to whom Quarter was no otherwise given,
then to the former) to be put to death in the same manner as had been done at
Shrewsbury. How the Rebellion in Ireland began, and with what circumstances of
Blood and cruelty it has been carried on, (the odiousness whereof, and of all
other Rebellions is apparent, and all good men must abhor,) is not applicable
to this Argument, (I wish the temper of this Kingdom had been, or yet were
such as might be applied to the composure of that;) your Lordship has in that
Army many Soldiers, who served His Majesty in that Kingdom of Ireland, yet to
those Soldiers when taken Prisoners, Quarter is given, and observed on this
side, the like must be expected from you: And if it should be otherwise, and
that Quarter should be denied to all those who have been proclaimed Traitors
and Rebels, or who by Act of Parliament are such, this War will be much more
merciless and bloody then it has been, or then any good man, or true
Englishman can desire to see it; I am sure such rigor shall be prevented by
all the Interest and Power I have. Neither can that threat and menace in your
Lordship's Letter of the resolution to use such Prisoners as shall be taken of
His Majesty's Army for the future, make any other impression in me, then of
grief and sadness of heart, to see so much injustice and inhumanity, a
proceeding contrary to the Laws of Nature and Nations, contrary to the rules
and customs of War in any part of the Christian World, so deliberately and
solemnly resolved, declared, and published. If there should be an Ordinance
made, that there should be no Quarter given to any Soldiers under my Command,
and an expectation that those under yours should receive Quarter, would your
Lordship expect I submit to such an Ordinance? This is the case. I have taken
Prisoners of those, who have taken Arms against His Majesty, of all Nations,
English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Walloones, of all Religions and opinions
that are avowed by Christians, and have always allowed them Quarter, and
equal Exchange (how unequal soever the Quarrel and Contention is, and what
Judgment soever the Law has determined upon such Persons) and shall do so
still, hoping that Almighty God will open the Eyes of those who have been
strangely deceived into Arms against, and to the scandal and destruction of
the Protestant Religion, (in which all men know I have been borne, and for
which they have reason enough to believe I will dye,) and the Parliament of
England, Assembled by His Majesty's Command, and of which His Majesty is the
Head, and will recover and reduce those, who out of ambition or malice have
made those paths, in which the other have trod to their Piety toward their
Maker, and their Allegiance toward their Sovereign: But if the contrary
course shall be held, and any Prisoners, under my Command, shall be taken,
executed, and murdered in cold blood, under what senseless and unjust
pretense soever, for every Officer and Soldier so causelessely and barbarously
murdered, I will cause so many of the Prisoners remaining in my Power, to be
put to death in the same manner; and I doubt not but the blood of those
miserable men, who shall so suffer by my order, as well as of those who shall
be butchered by that Ordinance your Lordship mentions, shall be requi^ed at
their hands, who by their cruel examples (...) upon other men to observe the
rules they lay down. And I cannot but express a great sense to your Lordship,
that since His Majesty's gracious Offers and importunity for Peace will not be
hearkened unto, by these prodigious resolutions expressed in your Lordships
Letter, the War is like to be so managed, that the English Nation is in
danger of destroying one another* or (which i^ a kind of extirpation) of
degenerating into such an animosity and cruelty, that all elements of Charity,
Compassion, and brotherly Affection, shall be extinguished. I hope they, whose
opinions and vesolutions your Lordship has imparted to me, will take these
animadversions into their serious consideration, from

Your Lordship's Servant RUPERT.
April, the 15th, 1645.
