declare the things which we have seen.

A Song of the Judgments and Mercies of the Lord.
I Will sing of the Judgments, and Mercies of the Lord; and declare his
wondrous Works unto all people: that the Inhabitants of the Earth may hear, and
fear, and reverence the Lord who is holy.

When I walked in the way of the Wicked, and knew not the path of the Just;
when I lived in transgression against God, and knew not his holy Law to walk
therein, then often times did fear surprise me, and terror seized upon my heart;
For I saw that the way in which I walked was the way that led to destruction:
then as I considered the way of the World, I saw they were all gone astray, and
though they had a Profession of God, yet Acquaintance with him they had not,
neither was he to be found in their Assemblies: Then my soul languished after
the knowledge of him, and after the Knowledge of the way of life; yet still was
I captivated with vanity, and the deceitfulness of sin stole away my heart: But
the good Spirit of God still strived in me, to come out of the ways of the
world, whose Worships I had long seen to be but as the offering of Swines
blood; and in my heart I could not join with them, but had a testimony in me
against their ways; and that which they called their Ordinances, I saw there
was nothing of God in it, for they were but as a shadow, vanity, and nothing;
but how to come into the way of life, to this I was still a stranger, until
the Lord in his eternal power, sent the Ministers of the Word of Life, who were
anointed of the Lord, and endued with power from on high, to preach the glad
tidings of the Gospel to the captivated seed, and to minister to the spirits
that were in prison, whose voice I rejoiced to hear, and whose Testimony I
gladly received; For they declared the way of life; that it was in the midst of
the path of judgment; and the witness of God in my heart did seal to the truth
of their Testimony: and this I saw was the way that the Workers of Iniquity
knew not: For there is no judgment in their goings: Then my soul cried unto God
for the pourings forth of the Spirit of judgment that I might walk in the paths
thereof, and that the filth thereby might be purged away: for I saw that my
heart was polluted, and that there was no habitation for God; which causes me
to mourn in desolation, and to wander in solitary places: So as I waited in the
light of his Son, which shined in my heart and conscience; there he revealed
his righteous judgments, and the just rejoiced therein, yea; he brought me into
the valley thereof, and there did he plead with me, even by sword and by fire,
etc. He poured the cup of his fury upon me, and made me drink of the dregs
thereof; yea, the cup of trembling he put into my hand, and gladly did I
receive it, though it was in my belly bitter: he oft-times sorely afflicted me,
and caused deep sorrow to compass me about, and poured his indignation upon me:
Then said J, I will bear it with patience, because I have sinned against thee:
Yet many times I was strongly assaulted with the violent rage of the wicked
one, for he shot his fiery darts at me, which often wounded my soul: Then J
cried unto the Lord in my distress, and he comforted me with his precious
Promises which begot a secret hope in me, or else I had fainted in the
tribulation, when his vials of wrath were poured upon me, and the enemy came in
like a flood; then was J ready to say in my heart, J shall one day fall by the
hand of mine enemy; yet J was still sustained by a secret hope; so that J cried
unto the Lord, That he would never let his judgments depart, until the Prince
of this world was judged and cast out: So he followed me with his righteous
Judgment, until J was near ready to faint: Then J cried again, saying, Jf thou will indeed bring me through thy Judgments, and grant me thy everlasting Peace;
if thou will destroy the enemy of my soul, and give me rest from those that
oppress me; Then will J teach sinners thy ways, and transgressors shall be
converted unto thee: yea J made many promises unto him, that my life J would
give up unto his service, and that J would follow him whithersoever he would
lead me: yet oft-times J enquired of the Lord, why J should be so afflicted
more than others; For J said in my heart, Never man's sorrow was like my sorrow:
Then he answered me, and said, How should thou declare my wondrous works,
unless thou see, and know them? So when J had born the indignation long, even
the time of his good pleasure, when J had been long tossed with tempests, even
as a ship upon the Sea, and had been long as a Pelican in the wilderness, and
as an owl in the desert, yea, as a silly Dove without a Mate, then he,
remembered Jacob his servant, and was pleased to speak comfortably unto me,
saying, Oh thou tossed with tempests, afflicted, and not comforted, Behold J
will lay thy stones with fair colors; and though for a moment J have
afflicted thee, yet with everlasting loving kindness have J visited thee; and
with many sweet and precious Promises he compassed me about, which at this time
is unutterable, and he put the cup of consolation into my hand, yea he caused
it to overflow, for which my soul did magnify his Name, and gave praise unto
him in the land of the living, unto which, by the arm of his power, I was
brought through the long and terrible wilderness; for he had regard unto his
own seed and brought it forth by an out stretched arm; for he plagued Pharaoh
with his judgments, and destroyed the Egyptians in the Red Sea of his wrath,
Wherefore J magnify the God of heaven (who is light) and extol him above all
Gods; for the Proud he is able to abase with his Judgments, and to exalt the
meek with his tender mercies.

Thus have I d^unk the bitter Cup of Gods fierce Indignation
The mini^^ration of the Law, and of the condemnation;
Which in its time was glorious; the just rejoiced therein,
Until the Prophets Ministry came, by which the hope came in
Of a Redeemer from all sin, the Law and curse thereof;
And of the deliverance from, the Judgment, and the wrath,
Which stayed me in the patience, to bear the indignation
Under which I long had traveled, through many tribulations,
Until John's Ministry I came to see, which was the great'st of all
The Prophets which had gone before: frrm the great'st unto the small,
For then the way was made so straight, the path was made so plain
That, the Coming of Gods Son I saw in his great power to reign;
Whose kingdom now is Come with power, the L^mb is sets on's throne;
The least that in this kingdom is, be greater is then John,
So here the mystery of the work of Regeneration is;
He that can read me herein may know where my dwelling is;
So when he had thus exercised me with his judgments, and filled my heart with
his tender mercies, and enlarged it with his loving kindness* so that the way
of his Commandments was delightful unto me, and my life was not dear unto me
for his sake; then he spoke unto me, saying, Thou must be my servant to bring
again the dispersed of Israel, etc. with much more, which I judge is not
expedient here to be expressed; So to his service I gave up my life truly, and
whatsoever I had I accounted not dear for his sake; for he gave me the promise
of his good presence, that it should never leave me nor forsake me, but that he
would accompany me therewith: And he a faithful, and keeps Covenant, and
performs his word unto his servnt; For he has carried me through many
Countries in which I was a stranger, and from one Nation to another People he
has led me; and some times through many people of diverse and strange
Languages; and his good presence never departed from me since I left the Land
of my nativity? but he is a constant Compan^on on unto me, and his Almighty
power it with me, through which I am able to do all things, and nothing is hard
unto me; though bonds and travels attend me, yet the comfort of his spirit is
with me, and all places are alike unto me, both the roaring Sea, and the dry
Land, because of his omnipresence who created them all; And this is the Mighty
God of Abraham, ^saac, and Jacob, who is with me, who fil^ my heart daily
with his love, and causes his blessing and living virtue to abound, so that
my cup does overflovv, for which I bless and magnify his name, and sound
forth his praises through the horn of his own anointed. And this the God
whom David served, who is now with me, even he that made him wiser then his
Teachers, and gave him more understanding then the Ancients, and delivered him
out of the mouth of the Lion, and from the paw of the devouring Bear, and gave
the life of the uncircumcised Philistine into his hand; even he it is that does
accompany me, and carry me through all my travels; who spoke to Moses out of
the bush when it was on fire, and was not consumed, at whose voice Moses feared
and trembled exceedingly; and this is he of whom I make my boast, who leads me
whithersoever he pleases; And who shall withstand him in his way, and not fall
before him? for the lofty City he brings it down, he lays it low, even with
the dust; Wherefore howl ye Inhabitants thereof; For behold your desolation
comes swiftly, and none shall be able to hinder it; for the destroyer of the
Gentiles is on his way; and who is he that can withstand him, or be able to
deliver you out of the just hand of the Almighty? for he is greater and
stronger then all, whose Controversy is certainly great with you, and will
assuredly plead with you in his jealousy, and in his fierce indignation, and
you shall not escape his hand; for he will find you out, whatsoever covering
you hide your selves under, and he will recompense every one according to their
doings; for all things are naked and bare before him with whom we have to do;
And his Kingdom of Righteousness shall be exalted over all the Kingdoms of the
earth, and the Lord God Omnipotent shall reign, and the Powers of Darkness must
bow before him that sits upon the throne, and rides upon the white horse, whose
name is called Faithful and true; and in righteousness he does judge and make
war: wherefore let the Armies that are in Heaven rejoice, that follow him upon
white Horses; for your enemies shall be given into your hands for a prey, and
by their spol shall you be enriched: He that has an ear to hear, let him hear
what the spirit says, which now speaks expressly, and signifies the things
that must shortly come to pass.

Wherefore put on valor and courage you Heads of the Army of the Lords
heavenly Host, who are in the front of the battle, and are oft-times deeply
engaged in war with the beast, and false Prophet, (who must be taken alive,
and cast into the lake:) J say unto you my beloved Biethren, and fellovv
Soldiers (whose weapons are not carnal, but spiritual, and mighty through
God) J am not unsensible of your Travels, Combats, and oppositions, and
hardships which daily you meet vvithal, but in my measure partakes with you,
and do truly travel in your strength, (I speak to the wise in heart) and J
also partake with you of the everlasting Consolation which daily abounds, so
that we need not faint in our minds, nor in our hearts, though our enemies seem
many in number, and great in strength; for the Lord, the mighty God of Jacob is
with us, even the Mighty Jehovah is on our side, (and this you fully know, and
it is not because you know not these things that I write thus unto you, but
because you know it, and can seal to this Testimony, and that you may be
refreshed hereby;) and he it is that fights all our battles for us; and all
Nations are but as a drop of a bucket before him; and the hearts of Kings are
in his hand, and he can turn them as the Rivers of waters; who turns a fruitful
Land into Barreness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

Oh my beloved Brethren, how does my soul love you, and cleave unto you! how
often are you in my remembrance! and sweet, pleasant, and delightful is the
remembrance of you unto me; your beauty oft-times even ravisheth my heart, and
(at this time) even overcomes me: your Crown is glorious which I behold, and
the might of the power with which you are endued, and by which you are armed,
who can declare! Oh! go on therefore you mighty men of war, you valiant
Champions of the Lords Host, lay wast the heritage of the wicked, that the
heritage of God may flourish: Let the Nations feel the stroke of the hand of
the God of David, (who is with you) who smote the Philistine, (that defied the
Armies of the living God) that he dyed. Let the enemies of Gods truth be
smitten in the hinder parts, that they may fall and never rise again; For Gog
and Magog have set themselves in battle against the Lord, and the briars and
the thorns shall set themselves in array; but Oh how will he dash them to
pieces like a potters vessel of clay, and how will he burn them up, and consume
them with the fire of his jealousy, and fierce indignation and wrath; how will
he consume and lay wast, until the spoyler be utterly spoiled, and the devourer
laid waste? for the cries of the oppressed and distressed suffering seed is
entered into the ears of the Lord God of Sabbath, and he has assuredly regard
thereunto, and he has awakened and made bare his arm, that cut Rahab, and
wounded the Dragon in the days of old; and he has roused up himself as a man
out of sleep, and has put on the Garments of Vengeance for clothing, and is
clad with zeal as with a Cloak: and fury to his Adversaries he will repay; and
he will certainly plead the cause of his own Elect, who have no other helper in
the Earth.

Wherefore all you suffering Lambs of the true Shepherds fold be of good cheer,
and of good comfort, and suffer patiently whatsoever the enemy shall be
suffered or permitted to inflict upon you for the trial of your faith; and
eternally I say unto you, it will be your Crown for ever, an everlasting reward
shall you receive from the hand of the Almighty; when you have been tried
thoroughly, then shall you appear in the beauty of holiness, and your sorrow
shall be ^urned into rejoicing; and for your afflictions you shall have the
everlasting comf^rt of Gods good Spirit, which shall abide with you for ever;
and the wicked, and those that hate you, shall be clothed with sh^me and
everlasting contempt, and confusion shall cover them, for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken it.

Wherefore put on courage and strength in the name of the Lord, and lift up
your heads above all sufferings; for these things last but for a moment, and
will pass away, and be forgotten, as they had not been; and are not worthy to
be compared to the glory that is to be revealed in them who abide faithful; for
their reward will be everlasting, and will endure for ever; wherefore above a^l
have an eye unto the Lord; and have respect unto the recompense of reward, and
this will carry you through with cheerfulness, so that nothing will be dear
unto you for his sake who shed abroad his rich love in your hearts, and the
aboundings thereof I question not but ( the upright in) heart feels daily: For
the Lord is not slack toward any of his faithful ones, but is free and large
in his love, and rich in his mercies, and freely extends it even as a River
into the hearts of his chosen: Wherefore be replenished therevvith you
suffering Plants; or this I testify unto you in the name of the Lord that the
virtue of the life of holiness issues forth freely toward you, so that none
needs faint under the Oppressor, but may receive renevvedness of strength to
bear yet a season; And behold, he in whom you have believed will be avenged on
your Adversaries, and will smite your enemies in the hinder parts, and they
shall fall, and none shall help them, neither shall they rise again. If you
walk humbly with the Lord, and reverence him above all, who is the God of your
life, then shall you have rest from all your enemies, and your portion shall be
the Lord, and your Kingdom shall be that which is not of this World, which is
an everlasting Kingdom, and shall never have end: So the Lord God of my life
keep you all in lovvliness, and faithfulness, and true humility before him; for
he who is the Holy one of Israel dwells with such, and unto them his goodness
extends, but especially to them of a clean heart. Farevvel.

Written at the movings of the spirit of the Lord, the Eighth day of the third
Month, 1662* as I was traveling in the Wilderness, as without, on Long Island
in America, and pondering in my heart the things of God, and his dealings in
times past and also present; then the spirit of the Lord, and the power of the
Highest overshadowed me, and his glory filled his temple, and he showed me
things not now lawful to be declared. J. C.

To all who desire to know the way to the Kingdom of Peace and Righteousness;
this to you is the Visitation of God.
THat which was in the beginning before the World was, and is now made
manifest, which we have seen, and which we have tasted of, and which our hands
have handled of the Word of Life; and that which is revealed to us in secret by
the Spirit of the Lord, that do we declare openly, even that which we are
eyewitnesses of; for the Word has took flesh, and dwells among us, and we
have beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of
grace and truth. And this is he who is now appeared in the Spirit, and made
manifest for this end, that the Works of the Devil might be destroyed; and that
by and through him the God of the spirits of all flesh might be revealed, for
want of whose knowledge the people perish, and many (in diverse parts of the
World, as I have observed) are in great perplexity, and some even at their wits
end, because of the destractions and many cries that are in the World, some
crying, This is the way; and othersome, That is the way; and all of them from
the Light of the Son of God in their own hearts and Conscience, which leads in
the way of Life and Peace (all who are guided by it and out of all confusion
and destractions about Religion and Church-Ordinances and Worship, and such
things about which the World is in heaps and confusion, and are prescribing
ways of Worship in their own fallen Wisdom, and would compel all to conform
thereunto (and so would bind the Consciences of people to their wills) which
ought to be left unto the Lord, to be exercised by his power in matters of
Worship and obedience toward him; and his prerogative is to rule there: So
that people must either disobey God or the Laws of corrupt fallen man; and
whether is better? judge ye.

And this is sad to see and consider, because there has been for so many years
bypast so much preaching, and so much profession of Liberty of Conscience, and
the like, and that by men of all professions, as they have come into Authority
one after another; and many and seeming fair promises have been made by them
all, That free Liberty of Conscience (in things relating to God) should be
granted and allowed to people of all sorts; for the breach of which engagements
(with many other) diverse have already been rooted out and overturned, and yet
thereby men have not taken warning (though besides warnings have often been given
them in tender love) to perform their promises and engagements in these things
and all other, though much consists therein as to their establishment; and on
the contrary to their ruination. Neither have they learned to give the same
liberty to others (in things relating to the Conscience) as themselves would
desire to have; and this is not to do as they would be done unto; and therein
they are short of fulfilling the Royal Law of God.

Wherefore let all people (who are making Laws to compel men's consciences)
consider how they are degenerated from God, and how darkness has covered
them, and hardness of heart has seized on them; so that they cannot have
regard unto tender consciences, but in the pride of their hearts would be Lords
over the Consciences of others. Surely they are not guided by the same Spirit
that the Apostle was in the primitive times, who said, Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own Conscience; and this was true liberty of Conscience.

And notwithstanding all the profession that there has been, and yet is in the
World, and the talk of God and Christ, and redemption and salvation by him; yet
now when the Son of God is come, is there faith to be found on earth? or are
people redeemed from the earth, or saved from the polutions of the world? I
tell you nay; for all who are from the light of the Son of God in them they are
in the alienation and degeneration, and are strangers unto God and his Covenant
of peace, and reprobate concerning that faith, which gives the Saints victory
over the World, and so are drove out into the earth (not redeemed from it) but
are bond slaves to corruption, and live in the polutions of the World; and in
this state the whole World lies, notwithstanding all their profession and talk
of Religion which is amongst them; and so their fruits plainly manifest it; and
thereby it is clearly seen, that their Teachers were not sent of the Lord,
neither have they had his Word, nor stood in his counsel; therefore have they
not profited the people, nor turned them from the evil of their ways, neither
are they brought to the knowledge of the truth, by which freedom and redemption
is witnessed: So their preaching is vain, and their Faith is vain, and they
remain in their sins, which separates them from God, and are dead while they
live, and are unrestored and unreconciled, and have no assurance of their
eternal well-being. And when any come into a serious consideration; and unto a
true sense of the sad state they are in, and how they have lived and spent
their time all their life long, then judgment and wrath, condemnation and
pangs, and the sorrows of Hell compasses them about, and then seeing
themselves in the perishing state, they are even ar their wits end; yet these
things they consider not in the time of their prosperity.

Wherefore all people every where who desire to come out of these distractions,
and confusions, and hurryings, and contentions about Faith and Worship, and
Ordinances, and out of the polutions which the world lives in, and to come into
the spiritual Worship, which is in the spirit and in the truth: To you I say,
that is the Spirit of Truth in you all (in which God will be worshipped) which
reproves you of sin in your hearts; and as you come into obedience to that, it
will bring you into the spiritual Worship; for the spiritual Worship consists
in obedience to the Spirit; and this is the everlasting Ordinance of God, viz.
Christ the Light, the quickening spirit* for him has God ordained of old to
all that believe and work righteousness for salvation. So all being exercised
in the Light, and with the quickening spirit, here you are exercised in the
Ordinance of God, and here the living substance is known, in which the shadows,
types and figures end; and here the handwriting of Ordinances is blotted out;
and here the Law ends, which was contained in Ordinances (mark that) in Christ
the everlasting Ordinance.

Concerning FAITH.
ANd the living Faith which gives the Saints victory over the World, this
comes by hearing of the Word, which is nigh unto you all, even in your heart
and in your mouth; and as every one comes to hear and obey it, you will thereby
be begotten into the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints by which they
wrought righteousness; and that is the Faith which gives victory over the
World, and which works by love, for the purifying of the Conscience from dead
works to serve the living God; and without this Faith it is impossible to
please God; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. So search your selves, and
see whether you are in this Faith, yea or nay; or whether your faith be not a
dead faith; for that which does not lead to work righteousness, is a dead
faith; for as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works is
dead also; yet by works only there is no^e justified (and faith without works
is dead) for the faith of Abraham wrought with works, and by works faith is
made perfect. So let not any deceive themselves with a feigned Faith, or framed
in the imagination, for that is a vain faith and notable to save you: Also
beware that your faith toward God be not taught by the precepts of men; for
that will stand you in no stead, neither will it give you victory over the
polutions of the world, nor purify your hearts from sin. Wherefore mind the
Word which is nigh, by the hearing of which faith comes, even the living Faith
(by which the just lives) which was once delivered to the Saints, and which we
earnestly contend for.

Concerning HOPE.
ANd the living Hope which makes not ashamed, but purifieth the heart even as
God is pure: This is not witnessed nor known, but through the tribulation and
patience in the experimental working and operation of the spirit of life in the
inward parts, and Word of Life; for by the Word of God which lives and abides
for ever, are we begotten again unto a lively hope, which we have for an anchor
both sure and steadfast in all our trials, tossings and hurryings which we meet
withal in the World, and amongst the hypocritical professors thereof, whose
hope will perish in the day when the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven upon
all who hold the Truth in unrighteousness; but he whose hope is begotten by the
operation of the Word and Spirit of Life, even he it is that purifies himself
even as God is pure.

So all who desire the way of Life to know, and to walk in the path of peace,
which the worker of iniquity knows not; I say unto you all, it is in the midst
of the path of judgment, which Christ the Light, the Wisdom of God leads unto.
So every one, the light in your own Consciences mind, wherewith Christ Jesus
the Son of the Fathers love has enlightened you; and as you wait in it, you
will find it checking and reproving you for sin and iniquity in the secret of
your hearts and consciences; and as every one comes to be guided by this light,
which is the way, it will be an infallible guide unto you to lead you in the way
of righteousness, and in the midst of the paths of Judgment; and the worker
of iniquity you will see judged in your own particulars daily; and the Prince
of this World will come to be cast out, as you dwell in the judgment; and this
is the way whereby Sion comes to be redeemed.

Wherefore dwell in that which judges the man of sin in your own particulars,
and join not to that nature which would lead to work iniquity or
unrighteousness, but join to that which (in your own particulars) judges it;
and here the Cross you will know, which the whole World are strangers to; and
then the old man will come to be weakened, and to be put off with his deeds,
that the new man may be put on, which is created in righteousness and true
holiness; but this Work is not wrought nor effected, but through many combats,
trials and great tribulations, which formerly you were not acquainted with,
while you were led captive at the Devil's will, and followed his lusts, and the
strong man armed kept the house, then all was at peace; but when the st^onger
is come, the other must be bound, and a spoil of his goods must be made, and
his Heritage must be laid waste; for the coming of the second Adam, Christ
Jesus the Light of the world) is not to send peace on earth, but a sword; and
then you will hear of wars, and rumors of wars; see then that ye be not
troubled; for these are but the beginning of sorrows, but the end is not yet.

So as every one are exercised with the spirit of truth (in your own
particulars, which reproves you of sin) this will lead you into all truth, and
to work righteousness, and will bring you to fulfill the Royal Law and the
Prophets, which is, to do unto all men as you would men should do unto you; and
whenever the motions of sin and iniquity shall arise in your hearts, as you
watch in the light it will be seen, and by the Spirit of truth it will be judged
before it be brought forth into action; and here the Cockatrice is crushed in
the shel, and Babylons brats dashed against the stone; and happy shall he be
that does so.

So there must be a diligent watch set before the door of thy lips, and a
diligent waiting in the Light (which is the eye) that the enemy may be seen in
all his wiles, and that his baits and snares may be discovered and escaped, who
lies in wait to devour and hunts for that end, and to keep the heart poluted,
for then he has his nest there; so herewith a young man may cleanse his way,
even by taking heed thereunto according to the Word, which is pure, and is
nigh, even in the heart and in the mouth; and this is the Word of Faith which
we preach, which was in the beginning, and is nigh, unto which you do well if
you take heed, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and
the day star arise in your hearts: And as you all take heed unto this Word, it
will be unto you a light unto your feet, and a lanthorn unto your paths; and
the operation of it you will know as a fire to purge the filth out of every
ones heart, and as a sword to separate you from your former lovers; and this is
the word of reconciliation which (purging out the filth) reconciles to God; and
this w^l be a Teacher near you, so that none vvil need go far for teaching; for
your eye shall see your Teacher, which shall not be removed into a corner any
more, according to the promise of God made by his Prophets in the days of old,
and your ears shall hear this Word behind you, saying. This is the way, walk in
it, when you turn to the right hand, or when you turn to the left.

Wherefore incline your ears, and come unto me, says the Lord, hear, and your
souls shall live, and I will make with you an everlasting Covenant, even the
sure mercies of David. So now the day of gathering into God's everlasting
Covenant of light, life and peace is come; and now is the day of Gods
visitation unto all people, and the time now is wherein you may come to know
reconciliation with God, and wherein you may come to be made nigh, who are in
the alienation and degeneration; and now the time is wherein you may come to
know the restoration out of the fallen state; Wherefore be not rebellious
against the light, neither be ye stiff-necked against the reproofs thereof in
your own hearts; neither resist the motions of God's good spirit of grace in
your inward parts, by which he has long striven with you; and do not despite
unto it by resisting the motions thereof, lest it leave to strive with you, and
the day of your visitation pass over, and your hearts be hardened, and you
become even sold to work wickedness, and then it be said unto you as Christ
said to Jerusalem, How often would I have gathered you as a Hen gathers her
Chickens under her wings, but ye would not; therefore behold your house is left
unto you desolate.

Wherefore consider your ways, and how the good Spirit of God has long strived
with you, to gather you out of the polutions, ways, and vain traditions of the
World, and every one while you have time, prize it; and while it is called to
day, harden not your hearts, lest thereby you provoke the Lord to anger and
jealousy which cannot be quenched; for this know, that his long-suffering and
forbearance will come to an end; and his spirit will not always strive with
man; therefore while the tenders of Gods love are held forth unto you every one
(who desires to know the salvation of your souls) receive it; and that which
begets good desires in your minds, and judges evil desires when they arise,
that own for your guide and teacher; and this will exercise your minds in
lowliness and humility, and keep down the lofty spirit and high imaginations
which will puff the mind up above the fear of God. So keep down in the
humility; for this the Lord requires of thee oh man, whosoever thou be, to do
justly, and to love mercy, and walk humbly with God, for the proud he
resists; but he gives grace unto the humble, by which he teaches them his
precepts, even by his good Spirit of Grace which brings salvation, and which
has appeared unto all men; by this (I say) he teaches them, that denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, they should live soberly, and righteously, and
godly in this present world; [mark] the Grace which teaches this, and which
brings salvation, has appeared unto all men; so that which brings salvation is
nigh you, the Grace of God which has appeared unto you; so every one mind
that, and none turn it into wantonness nor into lasciviousness, but every one
give up to be taught by it, that the precepts of God you may come to know, and
walk in them: And so here is the great salvation of God, God's Covenant of
Light which lights every man that comes into the world; I have given thee
(says he) a Covenant of Light, to lighten the Gentiles, that thou may be my
salvation to the ends of the Earth: Mark, God's Covenant of Light for
salvation, which lights every man that comes into the World; in which Light
the Nations of them that are saved must walk; and says God (who is Light) I
the Lord search the heart, and try the reins; look unto me and be saved all ye
ends of the earth; mark again, unto him that searches the heart, and tries
the reins, all the ends of the earth must look for salvation; so that it comes
not from the Mountains nor Hills, but salvation is of the Lord; and God is
Light, and in him is no darkness at all; and this is the Father of Lights, and
is in the Son, and the Son in him; and the Father and Son are one, who lights
every man that comes into the world; wherefore dwell in the Light, and walk in
the Light, that you may be children of the Light; for the earth shall be
covered with darkness, and gross darkness shall be over the people; but the
Lord shall become the Light of his Israel, and his God his glory.

Wherefore come out of the gross darkness with which the Earth is covered, and
walk in the everlasting light of the Son of God wherewith you are enlightened,
and walk no longer in the dark paths of ignorance, neither follow the blind
guides of the World any more, who have fed you with their own airy imaginations
and conceptions, and brain-study, and have spoken unto you a divination of
their own brain, and not from the mouth of the Lord, and your souls are not
satisfied with all that ever you received from them; and why will you spend
your money for that which is not bread, ann your labor for that which does not
satisfy your soul^? Oh hearken diligently unto the voice of God (who is Light)
that you may eat of that which is good, and your souls may be satisfied; for
why should your souls be in poverty, and dry, and barren (now the Fountain of
durable riches is open) but because you are alienated from the Lord, and
strangers to his Covenant of Light. Wherefore the restoration all wait to know,
by him who brings back again that which has been driven away, that the return
of your captivity you may come to know and witness, out of Babylon that great
City, whose desolation comes suddenly, and be ye separated from the
abominations thereof, and touch not the unclean thing, that you may be received
of the Lord into my Father's House, where my dwelling is, in which there is no
want of any good thing; for here is all plenty of Heavenly rich virtue, and
sweet consolation; wherefore I cannot but invite all who are hungry to come
freely; for the Fountain is open, and whosoever thirsts, may drink of the water
of life freely.

But now my Friends, this know, That the way that leads to this Ocean of Rest,
Kingdom of peace, and Fountain of life, is strait and narrow, and none can walk
therein but through self-denial, and taking up the daily Cross to the carnal
mind, which may seem hard to such as enter into Reasonings and Consultations
with the vvrong nature, which would still live; but that being denied, and
the light being joined unto, which manifests the way, and the Cros^ being
taken up, and the yoke submitted unto, then the Power of the Lord you will
feel, which will subject the contrary nature, and vvil make the way easy
and plain before you, yea and delightful unto you, though it be in the midst of
the paths of Judgment, for the righteous will rejoice therein; and though many
oppositions, and sometimes many difficulties you may find in the way, yet
keeping to the Light in singleness, and feeling the power of God, and the
secret working thereof, it will keep the mind cool, and exclude the Consulter;
and then the way thou will see open clear before thee, through all
difficulties; and as thou waitest in the pure fear of the Lord, keeping thy
mine staid upon him, thou will feel his good hand of love reaching unto thee
daily, administering renewedness of strength unto thee, whereby thou will be
sufficiently encouraged to press on in the strait and narrow way, and the way
of his commandments will be delightful unto thee, and not grievous; and he will
replenish thy heart with his grace, and make thee know the aboundings of his
love, which vvil exceedingly enlarge thy heart: So let none stumble or start
aside at the straitness of the way, but be vvilling to submit to the Cross,
that the Crown thou may come to receive, which is immortal and eternal, and
then it will never repent thee whatsoever thou art made to deny; for an
hundred fold thy revvard vvil be in this life from the hand of the Lord; and
peace, and life everlasting thou vvilt have the assurance of, and it thou vvilt
possess and enjoy; and tbis is of more value with the upright in heart, then
all the love, glory, or friendship of the World, for that lasts but for a
little season, and then passes away; but this Inheritance is everlasting, and
never has an end.

Wherefore let not your minds be captivated with any perishing thing
whatsoever, but in that which vvil redeem the mind out of all that is
perishing, in that dwell, and you vvil know a daily dying unto sin, and to all
things of that nature which keeps the soul in death; and thereby you vvil be
quickened unto God, and the desires and secret breathings which are in you
after God, vvil more and more increase and be renewed, and fervency of heart,
and zeal for the Lord will increase also; and where these fervent desires and
breathings are in any one, nothing will satisfy it but the presence of the
Lord; and as this is dwelt with in sincerity and singleness, the Lord in his
own time will manifest himself to thy everlasting satisfaction and comfort, and
joy, and everlasting content; Wherefore let not any thing be accounted dear for
his sake; for he that loves father or mother, wife or children, or any thing
more then me (says Christ) is not worthy of me.

Wherefore I now publish the Decree of the Almighty unto all Nations, That
whosoever will not serve, worship and obey the God of Heaven, who is Light, and
searches the heart of man, even he shall dye, and darkness shall be his
covering, and gross darkness his pavillion; and death shall be his life, and
the Terrors thereof shall compass him about world without end. Josiah Coal.
