The Conceited Lover, OR The enamoured young man,
His Betty is in his conceit the rarest
Just like the Crow which thinks her own bird fairest,
He deeply is enamoured you must know,
Which makes him in her praise to overflow,
He highly does commend her she is so pretty,
As if that none but he had ^uch a Betty.
The Tune is prithee Love turn to me, etc.




COme Betty why art thou so bashful
come give me a kiss for a pledge,
For why I have vowed to be faithful
^^y Love I will free y engage,
Sit down whilst the Birds are a singing
^hy fame I will spread to the sky,
That all ye whole world may s^e and behold
what a pretty sweet Betty have I.
Then do not thou bl^sh for the matter
Wh^st I do ^hy praises set forth
^hy beauty (...)ee^ no^ t^ fl^tter,
Since thou ar^ a girl of great worth
Whatever the world may imagine
The same will I say till I dye,
(...) ever he be, he plainly may see
^
Thy forehead is prittily raised
And thy hair the Amber does shine,
Each f(...) deserves to be praised
Thy ^^auty is almost Divine.
^hy sparkling eyes and thy cherry cheeks
(...) the lips of a crimson Dye
Does make me to say by night and by Day
what a, etc.
Thy bo^y so neat and so tender
^hy middle and every part,
Thy fingers so small and so slender
H^^h stolen away my poor heart,
For a Leg and a foot, and another thing toot
Believe me I scorn for to lie
Thou (...)est ye day and I boldly may say

There Is never a Girl in the City
That can with my Betty compare,
She is so complete and so pretty
So beautiful and so rare,
Oh how it does ra^ish (...) senses
To have her still in m^ ^ye
It lightens my heart, and every part
to think what a Betty have I.
As thr^ugh the woods we are walking
Abroad in the prime of the Spring
Of love we are pleasantly talking
Whilst pretty birds sweetly sing,
And strain forth their note^ to please us
And chirp it melodiously
What pleasure it is, to take a (...),
and to say what a Betty have I.
The woods and the Groves do inv^^^ us
Our pleasures abroad for to take
The flowers in the meadows delight us
Whilst we pretty posies do make
We sport away time for a fancy,
Where no body can us espy
My honey, my dear come sit thee down here,
what a pretty sweet Betty have I.
See where little Cupid is sporting
Alone by that fair rivers side
Where Lovers are often resorting
His ar^o^ce he closely does hide
He plucked out a dart and he wounded my heart
Which made me aloud for to cry
Now I am in love and I plainly will prove
what a pretty sweet Betty have I.
I Will have thee most richly attired
I^ gren like Diana the fair
By all men thou shall be admired
No N^mph ever seemed so rare;
I Will deck thee sweet Posies and Garlands
which shall he most fair to the eye,
And all my ^^ight shall be in thy sight
what a pretty sweet Betty have I.
What ever my Betty requires
With speed I will quickly procure
New fashions or what thou desire
Be it never so fine and so pure
I Will strain m^ estate for to please thee
Believe me I hate for to lie,
So I have the bliss, for to take a sweet kiss,
and to say what a Betty have I.
Then prithe be merry and cheerful
Let sorrow be banished away
For thou have no cause to be fearful
Thy will I will ever obey,
If fortune befriend my intentions
I care not a trip of a Dye
Thy time will draw near when I need not to fear
for to say what a Betty have I.
And so my sweet Betty I Will leave thee
Because we at present m^st part,
B(...) I will never deceive t^ee
For (...) thou enjo^est my heart
The (...)e will seem long till I see thee
And have thee to lie by my side
What joy and what bliss it will be for to kiss
and have Betty to be my sweet bride,
