A Cabinet of Choice Jewels: OR, THE CHRISTIANS Joy and Gladness.
A Carrol for Christmas Day.
Tune is, The Pious Christians Exhortation.
LET Christians now with Joyful Mirth,
both young and old, yea great and small,
Still think upon our Saviors Birth,
who brought Salvation to us all.
And thus the Lord his Son did send,
whom cruel Jews did hold in scorn,
No pompous train did there attend
this King of Kings when he was born.
No Palace but an Oxes Stall,
the place of his Nativity,
Methinks this might instruct us all,
to learn of him Humility.
The great Redeemer of Mankind,
was born the five and twentieth day
Of December, then let us mind,
his blessed power to obey.
'Twas in the City of David then
as holy Scriptures makes appear;
And the time of Taxing, when
they came all round from far and near.
The Virgin Mary then by name,
and Joseph most exceeding kind;
When they unto the City came,
no habitation could they find,
But in an Oxes stall, where they
continued while this blessed morn,
Let us rejoice and keep this day,
whereon the Lord of Life was born.
Upon this day let none be found,
to practice any idle game,
And though thy mirth do much abound,
yet let it not be so profane,
But let all Godly Mirth still be,
your chiefest solace and delight;
Since he was born to set us free,
who now remains in Glory bright.
Relieve your Neighbors that are poor,
you are commanded so to do,
Out of the plenty of your store,
that they may all rejoice with you.
Thus in your mirth with one accord,
see you do all evil shun,
And sing your praises to the Lord,
for sending his beloved Son.
He that descended from above,
and freely for our Sins has died,
Make him the pattern of our love,
so may our joys be sanctified.
You that have heard these Lines* I pray,
let all your hearts be so inclined,
To give due honor to this day,
which brought Salvation to Mankind.
A second Carrol for Christmas Day.
Tune of, Over Hills and High Mountains.
NOW when Joseph and Mary,
was to Bethlehem bound,
They with travel were weary,
yet no lodging was found
In the City of David,
though they sought it over all,
They alas could not have it,
but in an Ox stall.
Though this place was no brave,
but as mean as might be.
Our Redeemer and Savior,
the great King of Glory:
Then a sweet Babe of Heaven,
he was born there we find,
Whose sweet life was once given,
for the Sins of Mankind.
Whi^st the Shepherds was feeding
of their flocks in the field,
The the Birth of our Savior,
unto them was revealed:
Many Angels assembled,
in their Glory appear,
Whilst the Shepherds did tremble;
being smitten with fear.
O forbear to be fearful,
you have reason to sing,
Then rejoice and be cheerful,
we glad tidings do bring;
There is born in the City
of David, therefore
Such a Savior of pity,
whom we do adore.
He Is the Prince of Salvation,
then be not afraid,
And with this salutation,
to the Shepherds they said;
Be no longer a stranger,
for in Swadling-cloaths,
He Is laid in a Manger,
then the Shepherds arose.
Being resolved together,
they to Bethelem go,
I, and when they came thither,
then they found it was so:
They in duty adore him,
come where he was laid,
Straight they fall down before him,
this obedience they made.
Nay, the wisemen, whose prudence,
had discovered this Star,
Came to pay their obedience,
and they traveled from far;
Bringing with them the choicest
what their Country afford,
Of Gold, Mirrh, and Spices,
to present to the Lord.
Their Example ingages
every Christian to be
Ever since in all ages,
to be noble and free:
Then rejoice and be merry,
in a moderate way,
Never, never be weary
to honor this day,
Which afforded a Blessing
to the race of mankind,
Far beyond all expressing,
if the sequel you mind:
While on Earth he was dwelling,
he was still doing good,
Nay his love more excelling,
for he shed his own Blood,
To redcem us and save us,
from the guilt of our sin,
For his Love he would have us,
a new life to begin:
And remember the Season,
be kind to the poor,
It is no more then reason,
there is blessings in store, etc.
A Carrol for Christmas Day at Night.
Tune of, My Life and my Death.
MY Master your Servants
and Neighbors this Night,
Are come to be merry,
with love and delight.
Now therefore be Noble,
and let it appear,
That Christmas is still
the best time of the Year:
To sit by the fire,
rehearse an old tale,
And taste of a bumper
of nappy old Ale.
It flows from the Barley,
that fruit of the Earth,
Which quickens the fancy,
for pastime and mirth;
And therefore be jolly,
now each bonny Lad,
For we have no reason
at all to be sad:
Remember the season,
and then you will never fail,
To bring in a bumper
of nappy brown Ale.
Now some of your dainties,
let us freely taste,
My stomach is ready,
I am now in has^e;
And therefore sweet Mistress,
I hope you will be brief,
To bring out the Sirloin
or Ribs of Roast Beef;
With other choice dainties,
I hope you will not fail,
At this happy season,
with nappy brown Ale.
And now let me tell you
what dainties I prize,
I long to be doing
with curious minc'd-pies;
Where plumbs in abundance,
lies crowding for room,
If I come but near it,
i will tell you its doom;
I Would soon part the quarrel,
but hold, let us not fail,
To think of a bumper
of nappy old Ale.
The Pig, Goose and Capon,
i would like to forgot,
But yet I do hope they will
come all to my lot;
We Will lay a close siege
to the walls of the Goose,
And storm her strong Castle,
there is no excuse
Shall hinder our fury,
therefore let us not fail,
To have a full bumber
of nappy old Ale.
All those that are willing
to honor this day,
I hope that they never
will fall to decay;
But always be able,
their Neighbors to give,
And keep a good Table,
as long as they live;
That love, peace and plenty,
with them may never fail,
And we may never miss
of good nappy Ale.

Of hateful cruelty was such,

I mean to an end
Of t^i^ our mirth and merriment,
and now the truth to tell,
He must be from our presence sent,
O C^ristmas now farewell.
Now Christmas will no longer stay,

Before from us he take his way,
of him i will take my leave:
It is a time none of the least,
as I the truth may tell,
For him we will make a worthy Feast,
then Christmas now farewell.
I do declare as I am true,
i will love him while I dye,
I Will call my Friends and Neighbors too,
to keep him company:
With nappy Ale and dainty Cheer,
our grief we will expel;
And Christmas while another year,
we will bid thee now farewell.
To make our joys the more complete,
we court the charming bowl,
In Merriment and music sweet,
let every loyal soul
Drink off his Glass, and let it pass,
in Mirth we will excel,
In sweet delight we will spend the night,
then Christmas now farewell.
With nappy Ale both brown and stale,
we will fill our Bumpers full;
And Pippins too, as I am true,

So fast and smooth it will go down,

And then at last, when all is past,
Christmas we will bid farewell.

A Song for Easter.
Tune of, The Wandering Jews Chronicle.
WHat joy to Christians now is come,
Death has received his final doom,
Christ in Triumph does ride,
Now Death by Death is sweetly slain,
And we in time with Christ shall reign,
his name be glorified.
O Death, O death, where is thy sting,
Our Souls to Hell thou can not bring,
since Christ is on our side:
He suffered Death that we might live,
Life to our Souls he did regive,
his name be magnified.
Here Is gain enough, and here is no loss,
Christ for our sake took up the Cross,
us to redeem he died:
O praised be his holy name,
That chose the Cross, despised the shame,
and now is glorified.
Our only Lord with Thorns was Crowned,
While Enemies did him surround,
yea him they Crucified;
But now he is risen up again,
Our Sins he by his Death has slain,
his name be glorified.
O sing then and set forth his Name,
Praise, land, and eke Extol the same,
we shall by him be tried;
'Twas he that for our sins did dye,
The wrath of God to purify,
but now he is glorified.
What tongue or pen e're could express,
The joy and eke eternal bliss,
that he for us did dye;
'Twas not his money but his blood,
Bought Eternal Brotherhood,
his neme let us magnify.
And last of all, O come let us sing,
Unto our God and Heavenly King,
that on the Clouds does ride,
With Eagles Wings, O let us rise,
Extol his praise above the Skies,
whose name is glorified.
O now lets rest in peace and hope,
Ith silly sub-coelestial cope,
by fire let us be tried;
That when Death mounts on the pale-horse,
We may ascend above the cross,
with him be glorified.
FINIS.
