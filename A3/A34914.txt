A Fore-Warning, And A WORD OF Expostulation.

Unto the Rulers, Magistrates, Priests of England, and Her Dominions, uttered
forth from the Spirit of the Lord; that they may Read, Weigh, and Consider.

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Sign of the Bull and Mouth near
Aldersgate, 1660.

A Fore-Warning: AND A WORD OF EXPOSTULATION, Unto the Rulers, Magistrates,
Priests of England, and Her Dominions, etc.
GIve ear O ye Rulers of England and her Dominions, (who are now exalted) of
what degree or quality soever, diligently hearken to the reproof of the Lord,
which is uttred concerning you; is it not for you to do Justice and Equity in
this Nation? and to undo the heavy burden, which has been and is born amongst
the people? knowing that for leaving this thing undone, your Predecessors (the
foregoing power) was rejected of the Lord; and think ye that if ye be found in
the same steps, and walking in the same path, that the same hand (which is the
righteous hand of the Lord) will not reach you, and bring you down though you
be never so high? and may think your selves never so sure; and though you may
in your thoughts strive with Eternity, yet know your day is comprehended in it,
and must have an end assuredly. Therefore stay a little and consider, honestly
in the sight of God let us reason together; for what cause is it think you the
Lord has brought you into power and exalted you? is it because the Lord has a
love to you more than any other? or is it because the Lord is well pleased with
your doings? or is it because your Righteousness exceeds theirs, that are
rejected and cast out before you? let that which is just in all your
consciences judge, and answer me, whether it be for all, or any of these things
forementioned, if it be, then what means all these abominations which are of
late excercised? and (as it were) free toleration of them? for there is no
restraint at all by any man in power (high or low) laid upon them; but the
Floodgates, or rather the Hell-gates of wickedness are opened wide, truly it
is very hard to he uttered the several wickednesses committed, as Stage Plays,
and other plays, Bear-baiting, Bul-baiting, leading the poor creatures up and
down the streets, dressed with Bells and Ribons, and Bag-pipes playing before
them, multitudes of men, women and children following them, leaping, shouting,
and rejoicing, now this is publicly done to the amazement of all that fear the
Lord; and the private wickedness is exceeding hard to be uttered, as
Drunkenness, Whoring, Thieving, Murdering, Revelling, Blaspheming God,
Scoffing, and Deriding all that fear him: When I have beheld many of these
things, my heart has even melted within me, to consider the end of them, for
truly I must bear my Testimony, (in the fear of the Lord) that the tenth part
of the wickedness now committed, was not committed in the time of the
foregoing Power, though the Lords controversy is with them, and he has
brought them to Judgment: Therefore see, search and read, this is my advice, if
your Righteousness exceeds not their's, you can in no wise escape the Judgment
of God, who is Just, and renders to every one according to their doings, and if
the hypocrite be brought to Judgment (who said and did not) what will become of
the open profane (read with that of God in you) and then you will understand;
for I tell you the sin of the hypocrite and the sin of the open profane, is
all abomination in the sight of God, and for judgment, though (it may be) the
stroke may be heavier upon the one, then upon the other; read I say, and then
you will know your Condition, and think not, that in this day the returning to
your abominable broth and Swins flesh, which the Lord spued out many years
since, will be an acceptable sacrifice in this day of the Lords great
Manifestation and appearance, who is risen in great might and Power, to
confound and dash in pieces, root up, consume and burn, whatsoever the Heavenly
God has not planted, for into the fire must it be cast, which burns for ever.

And you who are the Ministers of this, which the Lords curse is to, woe, woe,
from the Lord is your portion, and better it had been you had never been born
then to grieve Gods good Spirit in you, and all his children by doing that
which the witness of God in you condemns for: Oh you prophets of wine and
strong drink, have you been hid in the earth these many years, and are you now
moved out of your holes? if your worship were the worship of the Spirit, then
where has been your Testimony all this while? The true Ministers of the Gospel
who speak by the spirit of God, concluded woe to themselves, if they preached
not the Gospel; it was not the powers of the earth could silence them, but they
were obedient to Gods commands, but dumb Idol Shepherds have you been and so
you are: And think not because you have the Powers of the Nation on your side,
that your wares will come to a better Market than your Ancestors (if so good)
for the day is dawned and the Sun is risen, which is the Light in thousands of
men and women, and has discovered the Merchant of Babylon with his deceitful
wares, so that no more of them will be bought of you for ever, glory to God and
Immortal praises of all his be given for ever and ever, who has made bare your
skirts, and so appears your shame and nakedness to all; And as to your long
Robes, Vestures, and Girdles, you flutter up and down the streets in, you find
neither rule nor example in Scripture of any of the Ministers of the Gospel,
that wore such for distinction, yet there were such as wore long Garments, but
they were deceivers, and know this is your Figure which you wear, you dumb and
speechless, do you intrude into the house of the good Man, to the supper which
he has prepared? you are by him found dumb, and he has pronounced against you
to be bound hand and foot, and to be cast into utter darkness, this is your
sentence from the Lord, and the type of your Girdles.

And as to the Power that gives you life and vigor in this thing, I say, a day
is given them (though it be a day) as in Winter, yet a work they have to do for
the Lord, who has ordained them as a Rod, and a Scourge to chastise his people
by, and has filled them (as a Vyal) with his wrath, which is to be powered upon
that Spirit that has dealt treacherously, and rebelled against Gods
manifestation, and so just it is because the Lord has appointed it, and when
the Rod has finished, and he that appoints it says it is enough, then into
the fire shall it be cast. Therefore consider what you are, and how you are in
the hand of the Lord, for assuredly the Lord will plead with the Rulers and
Priests of this Nation, and a day of howling and bitter lamentation is to you,
instead of your joy and pleasures which you so eagerly pursue; and was it not
better for you to repent of the evil in your selves, and then make laws for the
suppressing it in others, which if it was truly done, from the principle of God
in you, it might put a stop, or at least, set bounds to this flood of
wickedness, which in these few months past has over-flowed this Nation; for
which cause the Lords fierce wrath is kindled against it, and except true
repentance be made manifest from you with amendment of life, he will certainly
excecute his vengeance upon you, and who shall defend and deliver you? it is
not your arm of flesh (you so much boast of) can do it, for they have been
tried by men, and have several times fallen into the hands of men; but it is a
fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Lord, if so, who shall deliver? for
strong is the Lord who Judges: And know that Gods Judgments came upon the
foregoing Powers, because they laid weights and burdens heavy to be born upon
the seed of God wheresoever it did appear, and Imprisoned many of the Servants
of the Lord, because for conscience sake they could not conform to the worlds
vain and wicked customs, and because they could not for Conscience sake pay
Tithes, to maintain the National Hireling-Belly-Priests, these things with
many other, they sought occasion by, to Persecute, and Imprison the Innocent
Lambs of Christ Jesus, and would be Lords over the consciences of men, which
thing is accursed of the Lord; for it is not the Place or Duty of any
Magistrate whatsoever, or any other, to impose any thing upon the Conscience of
any; for the Lord alone is he that does exercise the conscience. Now I know you
will own the saying in Scripture, which says, do unto every man as you would
be done unto your selves, and if you practice the same you will allow us the
same liberty as you your selves have, that is, not to be forced to this way of
worship, or the other, or any thing whatsoever which concerns conscience; for
you your selves would not be so served; And I tell you plain we challenge the
same liberty, as you enjoy as to matter of Worship and Religion, and if we be
debarred of it, the Lord God, that pleads our cause, will give us it whether
you will or nay. For I know that your Church and Religion (as you call it)
cannot be settled without persecution; and truly I believe unto death; but the
Scriptures must be fulfilled where there was a generation said, had we lived in
the Prophets days, we would not have put them to death; but the same
generation put Christ the great Prophet to death, and so you will say now, had
we lived in Queen Maryes days we would not have put the people of God to death,
who suffered Martyrdom; yet imprison and persecute them now, though not by
open burning, because your day is not yet fully come; so you manifest your
selves to be of the same seed upon which all the righteous blood has been
charged, from Abel even to this day; so one seed, the Persecutor; one seed
persecuted; the one of Cain from all generations, the other of Abell from all
generations; so now read your selves of one of these seeds; for of one of them
assuredly you are, and your fruits declare the seed, your selves you cannot
hide from the Witness of God in your own consciences, neither from it in ours:
Therefore make not your finger as heavy as their Loins that the Lord has cast
out before you; for as your sins exceeds theirs, so will your judgment exceed
theirs, for just is the Lord; And further know that the Lord is cutting his
work short in righteousness in the earth, and is quick and swift in his
jugdements, therefore think not your foundation is more sure then those that
are gone before you, when the Lord comes to plead with you for your
abominations; did you never take notice how thick the changes of Government
have been in this Nation of late years? And what think you of it? Was it only
to make room for you? If you think so, you are highly mistaken: Now had your
power been more righteous, more just, more holy, and more for freedom, and
liberty then those that are gone, then I should have both believed and
confessed that the Lord only in love ordered the Government to you, and
established your Throne; for righteousness, holiness, meekness, equity,
freedom and liberty in matters of conscience the Lord God ownes and loves; and
it is that he will set up in the earth, in despite of all that opposes it;
Therefore in vain it is, Oh Rod of Gods wrath, to contend with him in whose
hands thou art, for assuredly Gods justice will take hold on thee, and know
also that thy reward and wages thou have, and shall have at the hand of the
Lord; for thy service is thy pleasures and delights to the full satisfaction of
thy desire; and what can, thou have more, thou Rod of Gods Justice? Thou
being out of the sense of him who has appointed thee; This is for thy service;
For Isreal's Rod was appointed of the Lord, and for his service he had the
spoil of Jerusalem, and the Land, and this honor was he honored withal; but
there was a time when he was had in remembrance with the Lord, and was called
to an account, and then into the fire was he cast; read and consider; I do not
speak these things in contempt of your power, or in upbraiding you concerning
these things which I have mentioned, Rulers, or Priests, the Lord is my
witness; for I am subject unto it for conscience sake; but my Spirit is
grieved within me and my soul vexed and burdened to see the abomination and
wickedness exalted in so high a measure, since the coming in of this Power;
truly this City of London is as ripe for fire and brimstone, from Heaven, as
Sodom was; for fullness of bread and idleness was Sodoms sin; consider what is
the great sin of this City, is it not so that the greatest part of her
Inhabitants knows hardly what to eat and what to drink, or what to put on? is
this the end of plenty? or does this answer the end of him that gives it?
surely it is given to serve the necessity, and not the unlimited lust; cast
your eyes abroad in the Creation, and see if every creature does not condemn
your selves; for I know not one creature, that does not answer the end of his
Creation, but man; and so the good creatures of God will rise up in Judgment
against you in the day of the Lord; consider these things in the dread of the
Lord, oh ye Rulers and Magistrates, for it lies at your doors, before the
Lord has sealed his Decree which is gone out against you, which is near at
hand to be done for the Lord has purposed it, and your condition calls for it,
and remember you are warned by one, who suffers with the seed of God in you,
which is held in strong bondage, under the particulars above mentioned.

And lay it to heart for it highly concerns you. Rich. Crane

The good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright amongst
men, they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with a Net
that they may do evil with both hands earnestly; the Prince asks, and the
judge asks a reward, and the great man utters his mischeivious desire, so
they wrap it up. Micah 7.2, 3.
