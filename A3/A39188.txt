An ELEGY upon the Death of King CHARLES.
BRight Soul! instruct us Mortals how to mourn,
How to approach, yet not profane thine Urn.
To come with Humane Sighs, or Eyes,
Were sure too bold a Sacrifice.
Lest a foul tear or nauseous gust
Should scatter or defile thy Dust,
We should in homage to thy Shrine
Weep out our humor Crystalline,
Which there congealed might Sapphirs turn
By borrowing Luster from thine Urn.
They only know such Losses to Condole,
Who can for every Sigh, breathe out a Soul.
Bright Soul! instruct us to that just respect
With which thy Hallowed Ashes must be decked.
To build them Trophies were unjust:
Thy Virtues canopy thy Dust.
To write upon them were unsafe:
Thy name is thy best Epitaph.
To carve thy Statue were amiss:
Thy Book thy best Colossus is.
T'inclose thy Relics were uneven:
No Shrine is fit for them, but Heaven.
Can Nothing lend thee Luster? may we turn
Nothing, if nothing can adorn thine Urn.
CHORUS.
Hark, hark, how each Orb his Tune does keep,
While Peals of Angels ring;
And since we cannot fitly weep,
Let Us try how we can sing.
Since Charles advanced beyond the King,
Is placed above his wain,
'Twere sure a sacrilegious thing
To weep him down again.
Then let our accents all conspire
With Heavens loud harmonyes;
While this short Anthem fills the Quire,
He Is welcome to the Skies.
