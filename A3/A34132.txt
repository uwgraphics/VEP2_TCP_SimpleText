The COMMISSIONERS having proposed Questions to Sir Edmund Jennings; to which
they Desired his Answer.
He Replied,

BEfore I can give Answer to the Questions Proposed, I Desire to be satisfied
in these Queries.

I. Whether for a Man to declare his Opinion or Resolution out of Parliament,
to Endeavor the Repeal of the Laws, made for the Security of the King and
Government, be not an Endeavoring the Alteration of the Government?

II. Whether to Endeavor an Alteration in the Government, be not Criminal?

III. Whether there lies any Obligation upon a Man to give his Answer in Manner
and Form Proposed?

The Commissioners not giving Satisfaction to Sir Edmund's Queries, he told
them, He did not think fit to give any Answer to Theirs, under his Hand; But,
by way of Discourse, he would tell them his Opinion, which was to this Effect.

I. I cannot say how I should Vote if I should be a Member of Parliament,
because I would Inform my Judgment as well as I could, upon the Arguments and
Debates I should hear in the House.

II. I am of Opinion at present, that some Penal Laws may be Repealed; but the
Tests not to be Repealed, because they were made for the Security of the
Government, and the Preservation of the Reformed Religion, according to the
Doctrine of the Church of England: And no Man can think this a Time to Repeal
such, but such as desire to Settle Popery in the Nation.

III. I will Endeavor the Election of such Members to serve in Parliament, as
I conceive will be Loyal and Faithful to the King and Government; and will
Endeavor the Preservation of the Reformed Religion, and will Promote the true
Interest of the Nation.

IV. If his Majesty's Declaration of Indulgence, be according to Law, it will
Support it self; If it be not according to Law, it is not in my Power to
Support it.

V. I will live Peaceably with all Men, that will live Peaceably with Me.
