Hartford, from the 17th of August 1643, to the 25th of March 1644.

the Chancery, and by the account, whereof an abstract is at the foot hereof.

The said discovery of 5097 l. 2 s. etc. arising in 31. week and 3 days time
upon 300 horse only, there serving likewise Dragoons and foot soldiers in the
same County, and all of them for several years, and consequently the like, or
more, in all other Counties of this Commonwealth, if some effectual Authority
were settled to cause the several Counties to produce their several accounts
and Muster-rolls etc. There would be without doubt vast sums of money
discovered that is concealed from the Commonwealth, in most (if not in all) of
the Counties throughout the whole Nation, to the great benefit of the said
Commonwealth. And the said Bagwell and Brockedon, do conceive and verily
believe (by the sundry addresses and complaints of many of the Soldiers, and
others of several Counties) That there may be discovered of concealments (as
above) more then will satisfy the Arears of the Souldery and the Public
Faith, if encouragement may be given to their just endeavors. And therefore
(in the behalf of many thousands, Soldiers and others, Creditors to the
Commonwealth) they humbly desire that an Act may issue forth for the effecting
of the premises, etc.

Will: Bagwell. John Brockedon.
