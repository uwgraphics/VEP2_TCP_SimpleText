OXFORD this 8. of June. 1644.
WHereas His Majesty, by His Proclamation bearing date the 15. day of April,
did straightly Charge and Command all the Inhabitants within this University and
City of what quality soever, speedily to provide three Months Provision of
Corn and other Victuals for all the respective Persons in their Families;
notwithstanding which direction and Command of His Majesty's, very many Persons
have neglected to perform their duty, to the apparent hazard and endangering
this City, if the Rebels had set down before it. It is therefore ordered,
that all the Inhabitants and Persons resident within this City, shall at their
Peril, within seven days after the date of this Order, provide and lay in for
their several Families three Months Provision of Corn and other Victuals.
And that there may be obedience given to, and execution made of this Order,
care shall be taken at the expiration of the said seven days, that strict
search and examination shall be had what provision is made by every family
within this University and City, and whosoever shall be found not to have
conformed themselves to these directions, shall be turned out of this City, as
Persons not sensible enough of the safety and security of the same.
