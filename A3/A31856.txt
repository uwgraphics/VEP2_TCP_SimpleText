HIS Majesty's Declaration, in Answer to a Declaration of the Lords and Commons
assembled in Parliament, etc.
AS much experience as We have had of the inveterate rancour, and high
Insolence of the Malignant Party against Us, We never yet saw any expression
come from them, so evidently declaring it, as the Declaration, entitled, A
Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, for the raising
of all power and force, as well Trainedbands as others in several Counties of
this Kingdom, to lead against all Traitors, and their Adherents. etc. In
which, that faction has, as it were distilled, and contracted all their
Falsehood, Insolence, and Malice. There being in it not one Period, which is not
either slanderous, or Treasonable. And nothing can more grieve Us, then that by
their infinite Arts, and Subtilty (employed by their perpetual and
indefatigable Industry) and by that Rabble of Brownists, and other
Schismatickes, declaredly ready to appear at their Call, they should have been
able so to draw away some, and drive away others of Our good Subjects from Our
Parliament, as to prevail with the Major part remaining of both Houses (how
much soever that Major part be the smaller in comparison of the whole) to
suffer that name (whose Reverence by all means We desire to preserve) to be so
soyl'd, as to be prefixed to a paper of this unsufferable nature; that tends
not only to the Destruction of Our Person, but to the Dissolution of this
Government, and of all Society; If at least this Declaration (which We rather
see cause to hope it has not) have so much as been seen in the Houses, and be
not the single work of the same Omnipotent Committee, to which is devolved the
whole power of the Parliament, and which, as We understand, is trusted (without
acquainting the Houses) to break up any man's house, and take away the Arms,
and money intended to defend and feed him (if they shall see cause to suspect,
that he meant to assist his Sovereign with them) and may well be as fully and
implicitly trusted to Declare, as to Act, whatsoever they please. And though We
doubt not, but to their utmost, they will continue that Injury to Us, and that
violation of the Subjects Liberty, and of public Right, to vex and imprison
those, who shall publish any of Our Answers to their Declarations, (and indeed
whilst they affirm against all truth, and command against all Law, it
concerns them to take care, that nothing be heard but what they say) yet Our
comfort is, that Our Jntentions, and the Duty of Our Subjects, are so well, and
so generally known to Our People, that we cannot fear (from whomsoever it
come, and though no Answer came out with it) that either, what is there said,
should be believed, or what is there commanded, should be obeyed. Who knows not
that Our Commissions for horse and foot were not granted out, till not only
Our Prerogative, but Our Propriety, Our Goods, Arms, Towns, Militia, and
negative voice were taken from Us, and all the Kingdom commanded to be in
Arms, and invited to bring in horse, plate, and money to frame an Army against
Our command, and Proclamation, and till horse were raised and mustered
accordingly, and then, with no Intention (nor has any Action in any of our
Ministers given the least suspicion of such an Intention) by them to compel
Our subjects to submit to Our Commissions of Array, or make use of them against
the Parliament, but to regain Hull, held out in Rebellion against Us; And to
suppress all such, as without Our Authority, and against Our Commands should
raise forces in this Our Kingdom, and leavy war against Us, under pretense of
any order or ordinance of one or both Houses: and such traiterous Assemblies
and Marches have been the only lawful and necessary Occasions of Our good
subjects, which have not been so much as interrupted by any Troops of Ours;
And what is affirmed of the spoiling and killing them, as they were so
traveling under Our Protection, and according to law, is a most malicious
Affirmation, as well without truth, as without instance, invented at once to
make Our Troops terrible, and Us odious to Our People. What care have we taken
that by this means the power of the sword should not come into the hands of
Papists, who have by Our Proclamation strictly charged that no Papist should
presume to list himself, either as Officer, or Soldier in this Our Army,
having directed how he should be discovered, if he did presume, and suffer, if
he were discovered? What care have We taken to avoid Combustion, and Civil
war, offering to lay down Our Arms, when they shall have laid down theirs,
in whom it was Treason to take them up, and restored Us those things, which
could not without Treason, as well as injustice be forced away, and kept from
Us, Our Arms, Ships, Town, etc. And when we might meet both Our Houses in a
safe and secure place to debate freely of all the differences in a
Parliamentary way. And by whose Influences these Propositions were received,
and whether the Proposer, or rejecters were most careful to avoid this ruin
and Desolation of the Kingdom, we leave all the world to judge, and whether
they, who divert the men and money, collected for the relief of distressed
Ireland, to raise forces against their Prince, (who asks the nothing, but what
is legal, nor will deny them any thing that is) do not join with the Popish
and Jesuiticall faction in the bloody Massacre of many Thousand Protestants in
that miserable Kingdom. We propose likewise to every man's judgment, whether
the declaring those to be Traitors, who execute Our Commission of Array (issued
in so many Kings Reigns, agreed upon by Parliament, and there yielded to by
the King, to be settled, as now it is, as a matter of great grace. And since
that time which was in the 5o Hen. 4. In no Parliament complained of) whilst
our good Subjects are vexed and imprisoned, not only for resisting, but for
humbly petitioning so, as may seem but to insinuate something against their
most illegal Commands concerning the Militia. (To which power of commanding no
Title can be made by any Statute, or any Precedent, nor can we ever find by
search, nor obtain to be told, what those fundamental Laws are, by which it
is pretended. So deep those foundations are laid, beyond all means of
discovery.) And the Declaring that those, who raise men, by virtue of Our
Command, and Commission (the only legal way) traitorously and rebelliously
leavy war against the King, and ordaining it to be lawful for all Our Subjects
by force of Arms to resist them, and their Accomplices, and the raising of
forces by Authority of Parliament (that is, by the remaining part of both
Houses) never in the most outrageous times before attempted, and commanding
several Persons, whom they call Lievtenants to lead, and giving them power to
transport from one County to another, the forces of several of Our Counties
against them; and to kill and slay all such, as by force shall oppose them, Our
Self not excepted, commanding all Our Officers and Subjects to be assisting to
them, and undertaking to secure them for so doing, by the power and Authority
of Parliament (which is first to allow, and next to command, and then to pardon
Treason) be not to have already subverted, as much as in them lies, the Liberty
of the Subject, the law of the Land, and altered the ancient government of the
Kingdom, leaving Our Subjects without all Rule to walk by, when the most
clear Laws cannot direct and secure them, and they see all those ancient
bounds passed over, which were ever as much known to be the Duty of both Houses
to observe, as it was Evident, that there were, and that it was necessary that
there should be Two Houses of Parliament; and at once behold the law (which is
to defend and protect the Subject) and Us, (who are to protect and defend the
Law) need Defense, and Protection; We doubt not therefore, but all Our good
Subjects will come in to Our Assistance, and that this wicked charge of
intending to introduce Popery, Idolatry, and Arbitrary Government, laid by
Implication upon us (because we defend Our Selves, and would recover Our own)
will be so far from being a Motive against Us, that this intolerable
Indignity, and damnable scandal, (so daily and visibly confuted by all Our
Professions and Actions) will increase Our good Subjects zeal toward Us, and
their Indignation against the Contrivers; And they will esteem themselves
obliged by the Religion of Almighty God, to oppose this war, so impiously, so
treasonably, and so groundlesly made upon Us their King, and his Anointed.

We therefore require all Our Commissioners of Array, Sheriffs, and all Our
other Officers and Ministers to raise all the power and forces of their
several Counties to assist the Marquess of Hertford, the Earl of
Northampton, the Lord Willoughby of Eresby, the Lord Dunsmore, the Lord
Pawlett, the Lord Seymour, Henry Hastings Esquire, Sir John Stowell, Sir Ralph
Hopton, John Digby Esquire, and all other in the legal and necessary Execution
of Our Commissions of Array, and in the raising and conducting of such Horse
and Foot, as shall be raised by Our Commission: and by force of Arms to oppose
the Earl of Essex, the Lord Say, and all other, that shall raise, or conduct
any Forces raised by pretense of Authority of both Houses, and the Persons of
all such Traitors, and their Adherents, and Accomplices to Arrest and Imprison,
to the end they may be brought to a fair and legal trial, by their Peers,
and according to the Law. And this we require from them, as they tender the
Defense of Our Person, the true Religion, the Law of the Land, the Liberty, and
Property of the Subject, and the true and just Privileges of Parliament. And
for so doing, they shall be defended and secured by Us, and by the Law; with
whom, and with which, we doubt not but Our Subjects will sooner choose to live
and dye, them with the Earl of Essex and his Adherents.

FINIS.
