THE COPY OF THE ASSOCIATION SIGNED AT EXETER BY THE LORDS and GENTLEMEN That
went to the Prince of ORANGE.
WE, whose Names are hereunto Subscribed, who have now joined with the Prince
of Orange, for the Defense of the Protestant Religion, and for maintaining the
ancient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, do engage to Almighty God, to His Highness the Prince of Orange, and
to one another, to stick firm to this Cause, and to one another in the Defense
of it, and never to depart from it, until our Religion, Laws, Liberties, are so
far secured to us in a Free Parliament, that we shall be no more in danger of
falling under Popery and Slavery; and whereas we are engaged in this Common
Cause, under the protection of the Prince of Orange, by which in case his
person may be exposed to danger, and to the desperate and cursed attempts of
Papists, and other Bloody men, we do therefore solemnly engage to God, and one
another, that if any such Attempt be made upon him, we will pursue not only
those who make it, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms
against us, with the utmost Severity of a Just Revenge, to their Ruin and
Destruction. And that the Execution of any such Attempt, which God of his
Infinite Mercy forbid, shall not divert us from prosecuting this Cause, which
we do now undertake, but that it shall engage us to carry it on, with all the
Rigor that so Barbarous a practice shall deserve.

FINIS.
