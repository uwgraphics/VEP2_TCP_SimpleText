TO THE READER.
I Hope you will be so charitable as to believe it is neither Gain nor
advantage has invited me to lay open this Warehouse and thus to Publish the
Merchandise of the Popish*Market, nor any hope thereby of supporting my own
Interests (since I know well enough how many Enemies a work of this nature will
make me among some men) it being only to let the world see that the abuses that
were long since discovered in the Popes Dispensations, are yet still in being;
as is visable enough by the Rules and Imposts of their Chancery, being neither
imaginary, nor yet forged upon the Anvil of Malice as some persons will be
ready to persuade those poor souls, who never had any knowledge of the
corruptions of the Court of Rome, nor of the nature of its traffic, a great
part of these Papers I cannot command at present, by reason of my abscence from
my native Country, or else I would have inserted them all, which would have
farther laid open their abominable practices, though perhaps this may be
sufficient (if not too much in so a nauceous a Subject: the papists without
doubt will disown it, and say that this is a mere fiction, and that such
things are not practiced in their Church, but I am ready to prove by my own
knowledge and experience, all I here allege to be true, and able to make good,
that as all the Arts of Man could not have invented more gross or villainous
fins than the Popish Clergy do put to sale, so that none but these shrinemakers
which mantain their worldly pomp and greatness by such handicrafts, could have
invented such a way of wiping out sins so destructive to a good Life, and the
main design of the Christian Religion, so that if you will but examine, and
seriously consider the particulars, you will easily be convinced that none but
themselves could be the Authors of it. I can safely say that there are hundreds
even of the ordinary Priests, that know not what it means, because that these
Arcana Imperii are always kept close from them and reserved on purpose for
certain persons called Aostolick Poenitentiaries, to whom the Absolution of
particular and heinous fins is committed (as it was to my self in Ireland
within these four years) and of such persons there may be one or two in every
City or Diocese which before they receive that power, must take an Oath of
secrecy never to reveal the Mysteries of their Church and to Keep them from the
knowledge notonly of the Layety, but also of the ordinary Priests and Friars,
and especially from any man that is suspected to be of so acute parts, or of so
much Learning or honesty as might make him scruple their authority, and neither
may it perhaps have come to the knowledge of some half-witted fellows, who
either for Lucre or Liberty, neither stick to the one Religion or the other, of
which sort of people we have diverse amongst us in this Kingdom, whose names are
not worth the mentioning by either party, but as to those sins commonly called
reserved causes, if any man shall acknowledge himself guilty of any such, in
eonfession to an ordinary Confessor, He can only tell him where the Popes
Bankers reside, who are to absolve him, and will gladly receive him, so he
bring with him the price of his sin, and this great Poenitentiary is thereupon
to procure a Bull of Indulgence and pardon for all wicked persons offending in
the causes here set down, and diverse others.

I would have said more upon this subject, and set forth more of their cheats
and Artifices, but I hope within some time to be at more leisure, and to have
better opportunities of setting forth their pranks and policies to the view of
the World.

I shall now only beg of you to assist me with your prayers for the conversion
of those miscreants which have so highly deserved Gods just Indignations, since
there is no greater figne of his anger then when he strikes men with such
blindness of understanding that they take for Oracles whatever the Juggling
Priests have invented for their own unlawful Gain, and as it were make a
mockery of God himself, men who can scarce be believed to have any hopes or
thoughts of a life after this. I humbly submit the treatise to the judgment of
the kind Reader, and if he think the pains I have taken, may any way serve to
demonstrate to the World the inormities of the Court and Church of Rome, and
perhaps convert some that are drunk with its cup of abomination, I shall then
rest satisfied that I have not ill employed my time; I pray God to continue
amongst us the purity of his Gospel and preserve our Clergy from the sin of
coveteousness, that spiritual Idolatry, which first debased the Church of
Christ from its primitive purity, and to convince if possible, those poor
deluded creatures, which are sold as slaves to this successor rather of Simon
Magus, than Peter, and to unvail the darkness of of his Kingdom, which God of
his infinite mercy and goodness grant according to the hearty prayers of,

Your servant in Christ ANTHO. EGANE.

The ABSOLUTION.
I Have here set down for the better confirmation and justification of the
truth of this Book, the particular form of Absolution, that these Missionaries
do use to such persons as do confess to them, and this is called an Absolutio
gratialis, and is most commonly used to sick persons.

After the Penitent having confessed his sins, the Missinar y begins his
Absolution after this manner.

Miseriatur tui omnipotens Deus, and dimisis omnibus peccatis tuis, per ducat
te ad vitam aeternam, Amen.

Indulgentiam Absolutionem and Remissionem omnium peccatorum tuorum tribuat
tibi omnipotens and misericors Dominus, Amen.

Deinde Injungit penitentiam, sicut ipsi videbitur convenience and postea dicit

DOminus noster Jesus Christus, te absolvat and ego Authoritate, ipsius qua
fungor te absolvo. Imprimis ab omni Vinculo excommunicationis majoris and
minoris, si fuerit Clericus, disit suspentionis aut interdicti, si forte in
curruisti and de inde absolvo te ab omnibus peccatis tuis and ab omnibus poenis
tibi in Purgatorio debitis pro peccatis and delictis and restituo te unitate,
and participatione Ecclesiae and virtute authoritate speciali mihi in hac part
Commissa restituo te illi Innocentiae in qua eras quando baptisatus fuisti and
si hac vice non moriaris reservo tibi hanc gratiam pro extremo mortis articulo.
In nomine Patris and Fili, and spiritus sanctti, Amen Jesus.

Pasio Domini nostri Jesu Christi, and merita Beatae Mariae semper Virginis and
omnium sanctorum and sanctarum ut quicquid bonificeris vel mali patienter
sustineris sint tibi in Remissionem peccatorum tuorum augmentum gratiae and
premium vitae aeternae. Amen. pax tecum.

The ABSOLUTION thus Englished.
OUR Lord Jesus Christ absolve thee, and by virtue of the Authority that I
hold, I do absolve thee; First, from all sorts of Excommunications, whether
great or small. If the Penitent be a Clerk, he must say; from all sorts of
Suspentions and Interdicts, (if by chance you have incurred any) Then I absolve
thee from all thy sins, and from all sins and torments due to thee in Purgatory
for thy sins and Transgressions; And I receive thee into the Union and
Participation of the Church And by virtue of a spetial Authority to me
committed. I restore thee into that Innocence in which thou have been when thou
were Baptized. And if thou die not at this time, I reserve to thee this Grace,
to the hour of thy Death; In the Name of the Father, etc. and by the merits and
Passion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the merits of the ever
blessed Virgin Mary, and of all the Saints and Virgins; That whatsoever sins
thou have committed, and whatsoever Injuries thou patiently have suffered, let
them be unto thee a Remission of thy sins, and an augmentation to Grace, and a
Praemium of life everlasting. Amen, Peace be with you.

THE POSTSCRIPT
ANd now I hope I have made good that I promised, sufficiently discovering the
cheats of these Merchants of souls, and therefore your Charity will give me
leave to say with the Apostle, tantum, bonum certamen certavi, though I have
not mentioned half the Abominations that are practiced in this kind, but I hope
this is enough to prove, that money rather than true repentance is made the
ground of the Absolution of the most heinous sins: but I hope God will give me
more leisure, and better opportunities of detecting the wickedness of this
mystical Babylon, and then I engage never to be weary of the design I have
undertook in declaring to the World the enormities of the Church, whereof I was
once a Member, and was (though ignorantly) as great a deluder as any of them.
But thanks be to God who has opened the eyes of my understanding to discover
the light of his glorious Gospel, which I acknowledge as his infinite mercy,
and who has enjoined me being now converted, to strengthen my Brethren: and
therefore I beseech you as you love God, and tender the salvation of your own
souls to detest not only the vices themselves, but the manner of forgiving
them, practiced in the Church of Rome. And beware of its Missionaries, who go
about like Wolves in Sheeps clothing, seeking whom they may devour, and have
no other end, but to breed confusions amongst us, to make us break the bond of
Union and Charity, in which we ought all to be united, in one Lord Jesus. To
whom, be all honor, and glory, World without end.

An Appendix.
THese Names of Missionaries and Penitentiaries are all one, the distinction
only is, that those Penitentiaries do reside in the Court of Rome. and the
Missionaries are those which are dispersed through the World, notwithstanding
they have the same power and Authority to absolve id est a Cassibus Reservatis;
The truth is, these do not directly accumulate or gather these sums, u they are
to enlighten the Penance and Pilgrimage of the Penitents for paying these
forementioned Taxes to their several Deputies, appointed in all places to that
purpose.

FINIS.
The Author s Testimony from the University.
THese are to Certify All whom it may Concern, That Mr. Anthony Egan Clerk,
lately a Franciscan Friar in Ireland: but now of the Reformed Religion, has
for the time of his Abode in the University of Oxford, behaved himself soberly,
discreetly, and studiously, and thereby has been a happy means to reduce some
persons to the Church of England, who had been formerly perverted. In Witness
whereof, I have hereunto putmy Hand and Seal, in such Causes usual, this
twentyninth day of August, in the year of our Lord. 1673.
