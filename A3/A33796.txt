HEB. xi. 37. They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins, being
destitute, afflicted, tormented. London: Printed for Henry Brom, at the Gun at
the West End of St. Paul's. 1679.

TO THE READER.
THE Publication of these Irish Barbarities is not intended to heighten
animosities between Protestants and Papists, much less to excite to a
Retaliation by a Curse ye Meroz. But because the impudence of many who are of
the Romish persuasion, is such, as to deny that General Rebellion and Massacre
in Ireland, which is here proved, and that those Sons of cruelty, the Jesuits
and other Priests, do still persist in the like execrable and bloody designs,
as appears by the present conspiracy so happily detected: it becomes necessary
to revive in the minds of Protestants the former inhumanities of this sort of
people, that every Loyal subject, considering what manner of Ephesian Beasts we
have to fight with, may be upon his guard, to preserve His Majesty from the
Traiterous and bloody designs which are against his Person, and to defend
themselves, their Wifes and Children from the like Butcheries.

It is observable that in the Year 1641. Ireland was in great tranquillity, and
that not by accident or from any seeking of the Irish: but by reason of many
Acts of Grace, which had newly passed in favor of them. So that Protestants
and Papists lived very friendly together: When on a sudden upon the 23. of
October, this storm arose and these and thousands more of Murders were
committed. And let us consider whether any age since the Reformation can
parallel the great gentleness which has been used toward those of the Romish
Religion since His Majesty's happy Restoration. For some years, till the
prompt and busy Zeal of some of that party, had provoked to an inquiry; till
the Papists to weaken our Nation by division, took up the Buckler for the
Nonconformist, reconciling Herod and Pilate to destroy Christ: it was hard to
discern in the Government, whether there was such a thing as a Papist among us.
And yet we now see the restlesness of these men's spirits advanced to a degree
as Barbarous, as the Irish: that nothing less than the utter extirpation of
Heresy, as they call it; though by cruel Murders, will serve their turn. A new
way to establish that Kingdom which is not of this world, by the most abhorred
of worldly practices.

These Collections are but a gleaning taken out of the Voluminous Records of
Authentic Books, now remaining in the Clerk of the Councils Hands at Dublin.
The Earl of Essex, when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, did peruse them himself,
and compare many of them with the Originals, finding all that he compared, to
be true. If any doubt; they may have recourse to the Books themselves; which
being public remembrances, may be seen by any, the Citations directing to the
Volume, Page and Mark where each is to be found.

Now these few Testimonies, out of many, are not Published out of any great
hopes of Converting Papists, though they may operate upon some of the more
serious sort; but to dispose all Professors of the Protestant Religion to a
just sense of what would have been the Fruit of this instant Hellish Plot, had
it succeeded, from what has been formerly upon the like occasion: and hence to
improve this admonition of Mercy in the midst of Judgment, by hastening (in
this, we know not how short breathing time) to put on the whole Armor of
Righteousness, that we may be able, if not to defeat, at least to stand in the
day of trial.

But what can be expected from a Kingdom divided against it self! Our
divisions, like so many wide breaches, let in our enemies so fast upon us, that
we are never secure: Yet if ever we shall be persuaded to enter into the Unity
of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace; if ever the healing Balsam of Charity will
be applied among us; if ever one time were more necessarily inviting to it than
another; it is now doubtless, when our familiar Friends and Neighbors have
conspired with our greatest Enemies abroad to take away our Place and Nation.
Let not the Dissenter then complain any longer in Libels and secret Whispers.
Let those of the Church of England still continue with open Arms and Hearts to
receive all such as will look toward them. Let us all come Face to Face, and
vie in humility, meekness, and easiness to be entreated. Let things in
themselves indifferent no longer rend the Seamless Garment, and give scandal to
those, whose every Ordinance, that is not sinful, ought to be submitted to for
the Lords sake. Let us beware of making that an offense, which the Lord has not
made so, least those come upon us which are so indeed. Let Gentleness move, and
Love create that Union among all Protestants for the future, which may remove
all names of distinction; and so knit us into a perfect body, that one and the
same spirit may have so free a Communication in us, as becomes the Members of
Christ.

Methinks such awakening dangers, not yet passed over us, should make us
inquire, whether the false and carnal prosecution of a true Religion has not
provoked the Holy Spirit: that in this our day by amending our lives, we may
invite God to avert those judgments, which press so near upon us.

For then and not before, shall we be free from terror and amazement: when we
strive to be as eminent in all Christian Virtues; as Rome is in worldly Wisdom
and Superstition: when our Obedience to Magistrates, which is Gods Ordinance,
when our Patience, and Humility, when our Charity, forgiving all injuries, even
the cruelties herein recited, returning good for evil, and blessing for curses,
which are the true marks of Christ's Church, shall be as well known unto all
men, as Rebellion and Massacres have been notorious both in the Principles and
Practices of the Papists in all Ages.

AN Estimate of the Number of Protestants in the Province of Ulster, that were
murdered by the Irish in the late Rebellion of Ireland, in the Year 1641. and

a Priest, that the Priests of every Parish in Ulster were commanded by Sir
Phelim O Neile, to return an account of the British Protestants that were
killed, by the Irish, in the several Parishes, the number of the men, women,
and children, so murdered at that time, came to One Hundred Five Thousand --
105000 Deposed also by Mr. Maxwel, that by an account taken by the Rebels of
the Murders they had committed upon the British Protestants in the North,
there were slaughtered One Hundred and Fifty Thousand -- 150000

The murder of Thomas Pressick, and others at A Letter from Master Richard

Trim, Com. Mead, see for that

Right Honorable and my Noble Lord,
ACcording to your Lordships desire, I have fully inquired into the murder of
Mr. Thomas Pressick, a rich Saddler at Trim, and have received this dismal
relation thereof, from two of his children, and one Jane Tucker, then present
with him, and several others now living here, viz. That in the first year of
the late horrid Rebellion, about a month before Christmas, one Miles Reyly, and
Captain Betagh, with many of the Irish under their Command, came to the
Parsonage Castle of Trim, in which Mr. Thomas Pressick (a very strict and
Religious Protestant, of great honesty and good repute) then lived, into which
also many other Protestants had then fled for safety, and being denied
entrance, they burnt the house adjoining to the Castle, out of which all the
people fled to the Turrets of the Castle, and the abovementioned Jane Tucker,
seeing some of the Irish getting up the Castle, and fearing they would throw
her into the fire, leaped off the top of the wall, upon the ground, and though
she was then with child (which is yet living) and the Turret very high, she
received no hurt; a little before which she saw and heard Mr. Pressick praying
very fervently in the Turret, begging strength of God to go through that fiery
Trial, and ending his Prayer, he declared his willingness to die for the
Protestant Religion, and encouraged them all to do the like, upon which some of
the Irish got immediately into that Turret swearing they would kill him, unless
he would go to Mass; he with great Christian courage told them he would not
forsake Christ for fear of death, they then in a great fury made him pull off
his shoes and slockings, and thrust him down a pair of stairs, the stones of
which were red hot with the fire, which he patiently suffered, saying Christ
had endured more for him, and then carrying him into his Garden he was
earnestly desired, by Thomas Magwire, then Parish Priest of Trim, to turn to
Mass, and he should have his life, which he with wonderful magnaminity slighted
and refused, saying he had lived in the true faith of Jesus Christ, and he
would die in it, at which words several of them cut him, and one of them
cutting his cheek almost off, asked him again if he would Turn, and undauntedly
giving them the same answer, they immediately hanged him in an Apple Tree
(together with one James Hawkin his Son in Law, and one James Wilson) they
themselves wondering at his courage: of the rest one Child was burnt in the
House, some of the men shot in the Garden, and the rest brought with great
Pageantry, shouting and scoffing, into the streets of the Town, having their
heads struck off with a Hatchet. One Mr. James Pressick, a Minister, did by
great providence escape out of a back window, they having designed great
tortures for him. The women were only stripped, one of which did privately push
an Irish Sergeant off the Battlements into the fire, where he was burnt, he
offering violence unto her. And soon after some of those barbarous people beset
the House of one Rich. Worthington, near Trim, who with his wife escaping in
the night, they killed the children, and the poor mother returning next day to
bring away her infants, was by some who slaid plundering the house, strangled
in her own hair which was very long. These are the only memorable murders at
that time committed here, but no Age nor History can, I presume, parallel the
horrible Massacres, which in this County, and all other parts of this Kingdom
were afterward committed, as is best known to your good Lordship, who was then
miraculously preserved in the midst of their bloody and inhuman cruelties, I
might write many other of their barbarous actions, of which many yet living
here can make Oath, but an account of this was all at present commanded by your
Lordship from

My Lord, Your Lordships Most Affectionate Humble Servant, Richard Tennison.
