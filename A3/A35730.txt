The Four Cardinall-Vertues of A Carmelite-Fryar: Observed by Sir EDWARD
DERING, Knight and Baronet: And by him sent back again to their Author Simon
Stock, alias Father Simons, alias John Hunt, alias Anonymus Eremita.

2. TIM. 3. 13. Evil men and Seducers shall wax worse and worse; deceiving
and being deceived. LONDON, Printed by John Raworth, for Richard Whitaker, and
are to be sold at his shop in Pauls-Churchyard. 1641.

To the Right Honorable N. N. Sir EDWARD DERING Knight and Baronet, wishes
happiness here, and hereafter.
MAy it please your Honor. In that which is so serious as Religion I dare not
be a trifler: nor can I love a man that is so. Divinity is ever Grave, neither
toying nor yet sullen. Piety and Gravity are twin sisters, both descended from
above, owning their high birth from the supreme Sanctity and sovereign Majesty
of Heaven. As they come from high, so they descend low, even to the center of
a Man; and take possession of his heart: there they dwell, and from thence they
send forth, (like Rivers from their Springhead) many notable assurances of
their residence there. While that some vent Levity and Wickednesses because
they have received Religion no deeper then into their brain. Many men are
Christians according to a certain common since they have of Religion. Now in
the Brain of man, The common Sense and the Fantasy are near neighbors, hard
is the condition (and yet the condition) of some, with whom Phansy leads the
way.

These Brain-Christians, are so much in skill, that they forget Practice. With
the head a man may know, even unto others wonder, and his own pride: But with
the heart a man believes Romans 10. 10.
unto righteousness: If this storehouse be well filled, The mouth will show
the abundance Matthew 12. 34.
of the heart within, and then with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation. If coldness or emptiness be there, you may find it in the dull Romans
10. 10.
and barren language of the Speaker. The most certain and most absolute
symptom of a good heart, well filled, is Truth of what the Tongue delivers. A
good man out of the good treasure of the Matthew. 12 35.
heart bringe^h good things. Now nothing is good but Truth.

Truth, it is one of the glorious titles and attributes, which our Savi^ur (in
whom was found 1 Pet. 2. 22
no guile) has taken to himself I am the Way (says he) and the Truth, etc.
All Fraud, Falsehood and Lying are from Hell. When the Devil speaks a lie,
he speaks of his own: for he Ioh. 14. 6.
is a^lyar and the father of it. He began with a Ioh. 8 44. Genesis 3. 4.
lie at first, and it has been his own ever since. Verum Evangelium veritatem
amat, veritatem colit, veritate alitur and Augel^i^ (says your Andradius) The
true Gospel loves the Defens^. Trid. l. 2.
Truth, honoreth the Truth, has nourishment and growth by Truth. Maxentius
Johannes affirms very well, Nullum vitium est, quod non sumat a mendacio
initium, neque vir^us cujus non sit origo veritas. There is no vice, which has
not beginning from a Lie: nor any Virtue, whose original is not Truth.

If after this, you find me wittingly false in any assertion, or in any
authority which I shall produce, your Lordship has here (I have sent it)
wherewith to stop shame into my mouth. But if by these following papers your
Honor find your old Anonymus false and fowly false, on whose side must he be,
and they that follow him? Christ and Truth go together; woe to the adverse
party: they are enemies and must be one day under foot.

When this old Soldier had often pretended much valor to encounter any man
that I should bring; and had almost persuaded me into an opinion of his
Ability: At last, in near two years time being pressed by me, he concluded,
plainly, ^o discourse with none. Some were married. I undertook for ene
unmarried! Others were skilled in the Eastern languages! I undertook that no
word should be instanced, but English and Latin. Then it was dangerous! I
undertook that also upon my own head. Lastly, it was to no purpose! And
indeed I found it to no purpose to press him farther. Quo front! qua fide!
with what forehead he made these darings, with what faith he has performed
them, I well remember, and can justify: Herein he is guilty of much untruth.

Yet lest he might seem to have a guilty cause, as well as a pretensed valor,
his pen was ready against all men, and he offered me the choice to design unto
him, upon what particular subject he should write. I answered him, that I was
so confident and so assured of the Truth and goodness of our Religion, that I
gave him liberty in all the latitude of Controversies betwixt us, to make his
own choice; even there where he thought himself ablest, and the best provided:
only desiring that he would be curious to pick out his best arguments, and
that he would be brief. He promised a speedy discharge, and made his present
election to prove Saint Peter's supremacy: I said I was glad he had pitched on a
point so material, but (said I) you have taken one as difficult for you to
prove as I could wish. It is now a twelve-moneth since, yet has this man
herein been as mute as death. Is he not guilty of another untruth?

I am little at leisure, and the least of any in skill for these Eristicke
discourses: but I serve Truth, and that will prevail. I do therefore again
and again exact and challenge him to perform his undertaking in that subject,
and with that brevity as was promised.

In the mean time having perused four several Treatises of his writing, two
in print, and two under the pen, I have good cause to ask, How well he can
justify what I find in them; not in the whole Treatises (they are not of such
weight and worth) but in four passages taken severally, one out of each
Treatise. Nor will I pick out that which is slight and easy: Nor will I take
less then what I find concerning one entire passage and the particular
subject there handled.

The Reasons why I am bold to present the trouble hereof unto your Lordships
hand are few, yet enough to exact this of me. Four they are, and very
powerful with me. Duty, Gratitude, Good manners, and Piety.

First in way of Duty I do owe the First fruits of my pen, in matters of
Religion, unto the person (if he were living) but now unto the happy memory of
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Here were some lines that would by
circumstances have expressed the name of that Honorable person, whom I choose
rather to omit.


This first motive leads me fairly on unto my second, which is Gratitude to
your Lordship in whose Noble Person, and dear love, his Lordship now lives,
more then in all the world beside. Your Favors, great and many, all free and
noble, like your self, have obliged me to this Gratitude. And among many
other, the many earnest and affectionate wishes, zealously and prayer-like
expressed, for my embracing that Religion, which your Lordship has with strong
belief for true, lodged in your own soul, though in truth, to the great
hazard of that excellent soul. An high obligement as it is: and able from a
duller spirit then mine, to extort this Gratitude.

In the next place Good-manners have impelled me hereunto. Some conferences
this old Gentleman has held with me in your honors presence to whom he is well
known. Wherefore (and for other reasons also). I hold it a degree of
Goodmanners, not to run this into his hand, without saluting your Lordship and
as it were first asking leave.

Lastly Piety to God, and to the Church my mother, and piety due unto your
Lordships soul, whose great abilities and rich endowments of mind, may herein
examine these, and hereby, take occasion to examine other Truths, and then
clear away the misty clouds of Popery: which are far more dangerous and
deadly to your soul, then unto millions beyond Sea, who either have not the
like abilities within, or so fair daylight abroad, by the free Gospel
revealed, as is unto your Lordship in this blessed Island.

God eternal grant that you may see, and know his Truth: and not like those
whom the Apostle expresses to be Ever learning, and never able to come to the
knowledge of Truth. And this for one only Advocate and Redeemer Jesus Christ
his sake, shall be prayed in your Honors behalf, by

Your Lordsh. ever obliged and most humble servant to his power,
Surenden-Dering, 28. Jan. 16.39./40. Edward Dering.

TO Anonymus-Eremita.
Sir,
BEcause you have pleased to magnify your own undertakings (concerning me)
unto others, as you have extolled some performances of your own, concerning
others unto me. I may justly think you have bragged concerning them, far beyond
Truth, because I well know that you never had a shadow, much less any
substantial ground whereupon to say or think me a Romanized Catholic, or
ever in any degree inclining thereunto. Yet P^^^st charge you, in the way of
your own glory, to have reported me Proselyted: I have the warrant of a great
and a Right Honorable person for what I infer.

Leave painting a bad cause, and leave that common trick of your Tribe, to
slander such as are free of Conversation with you, as if they were ready to
warpe, before your reasons can wa^me them. Although our Religion be gentle, yet
is it firm: though it be meek, yet it is constant. A behavior strange to
mis-report those for your own, whom you have tried and found impossible for
you to move. Impossible for you! I alas: it is not be strength of an Anonymus,
can draw unto the fair but false Tents of Rome, a weaker man then my self
(though weak us any) who has a vigilant Conscience to keep him wary of your
assaults. I am not so credulous to think every Stocks a Stoicke.

But I forbear this jarring expostulation: Yet am I hear appellant to cite
you to a trial, wherein I engage my self to manifest the indiscretion of any
man, who shall report or believe me Romanized in my Religion. This trial shall
be fairly made, by calling you forth to justify some passages of yours which
I shall make choice to question.

Four Treatises of yours, I have hastily coursed over, Two in Manuscript, Two
in print. You may be sorry if I find Fraud in the first, Folly in the second,
Railing in the third, and Blasphemy in the fourth. If there be less, I am much
mistaken. These passages which I mean, are first concerning Altars in the
tenth Chapter of your Caveat for a friend, a Manuscript you sent me, wherein
you corrupt one Text and mis-inferre two other. The second in another
Manuscript, by you sent, entitled, A Tract of Prayer to Saints: where your
eighteenth and last Chapter, is so far from wisdom, learning and Reason,
that no one of all your Proofs alleged, are wise enough to find the way to
the Mark you aim at. The third is said to be printed at Roan 1623, and by you
inscribed Jesus, Maria Joseph. This you gave me, wherein I find most foul,
base, and absurd language, and that both causeless and untrue. Lastly, in your
Appeal unto King JAMES, printed (under the name of John Hunt) 1620 I find
Blasphemy, or else I know not Blasphemy when I hear it. If I make these things
appear, what are you? and what is your Religion? If I fail, you may show me
the shame of my silly undertaking.

The Treatises being yours, my speech will be particularly directed to your
self: yet not so much to your person as unto the language which I find.

In the last place you have by way of Epiphonema, that which you did lately
brave me unto, but afterward as poorly did fly from: I mean three
propositions which being made good with solid Truth, and full proof, I have
promised to become a Papist: but you refused them the other day being (I
suppose) conscious to your self, either of your own weakness, or of theirs.

If these propositions cannot be maintained by you nor for you: then reform
your self: Reduce them whom you have misled. Give God the glory, and do not
scorn the Truth of his advice, who it in him that is Truth it self,

your faithful and assured friend, Edward Dering.
Surenden-Dering, 28. Jan: 1639./40.
SIR EDWARD DERING TO THE READER.
BEfore the perusal of this short Treatise, I entreat my friendly Reader, to
take notice of this preamble.

The Motives inducing me to write these following sheets, being (as by
themselves it will appear) sudden, and after the purpose once entertained, the
work (not worth the name of work) as suddenly peformed, I sent them) according
to the date) in an Epistolary way to a noble personage to be surveyed by a
Priest styling to himself Anonymus Eremita.

The Reasons hereof are in my two following Letters expressed, whereunto
(without further circumstance) I refer.

At the latter end of July last, I had from the Priest, that which he called an
answer: upon perusal whereof, I found the old man Verbosum and delirum. I
found his labor to be (...) and himself (...). I presently did snatch a pen,
and began to press a short reply to his tedious answer: But two warrantable
reasons have delayed my reply, and a third for the present, has quite diverted
it.

First, I had then upon my hand an answer to be discharged to another of his
infectious tribe: But a man (indeed) whose abilities, and whose modesty of
Language do yet seem to be of a much better temper, then this namelesse Hermit
has discovered. The due dispatch of this, did justly foreslow my reply to this
dull Carmelite.

Immediately upon, or before that Answer issued from me, it pleased the
Country to honor me with their trust unto this Parliament. So that being now
divided from my Library, and not daring (in point of honesty) to withdraw my
self from these services (for it is duty better shown, with weakness to
undergo my part, rather then deceitfully to desert them) I have held it fit to
lay by that reply which I can not now intend, and which must of necessity be
fruitless in being made unto his, so rude and so barren answer. These two
reasons do (as I conceive) justly warrant my delay.

Whilst thus I am necessitated, a judicious and true friend, upon sight of the
wretched, and despicable babbling, in the rescript of Anonymus, gave me this
advice. That the Priests answer being worthy of nothing but contempt, and being
too tedious for a present reply, (especially in the midst of better
avocations) I should publish this Quadrilogus which I formerly sent unto him,
and thereby provoke him to thrust forth his elegant answer: whereupon the world
(without more lines) may judge on which side Truth and Modesty do dwell.

I have followed this Counsel: Here is my adventure in way of challenge, I
expect that he should be at charge to publish his own answer, and then
(presuming on better leisure) I hope in a reply upon his babbling, to show that
the Poets contempt will be a just Encomion for this old Friar,

O sola fortem garrulitate senem.

20. March. 1640.
SIR EDWARD DERING TO Anonymus-Eremita.
YOU challenged me to set down in writing three propositions, which being by me
performed, you then fled from your own undertaking: here they are again.

1. The Pope has by divine right a supremacy of power in matters Spiritual,
which ought to be universally believed and obeyed, as of Faith.

2. The Romish Mass is a Sacrifice both proper and propitiatory: for the
present, and the absent: for the living, and the dead.

3. Our blessed Savior, and his Apostles did teach the same points of doctrine
which the Church of Rome does affirm, and which are denied by the Reformed
Church.

Prove and maintain these positions with clear and full authority: and hear I
give you my hand, that you shall then have my heart, unto the Roman Church.

EDWARD DERING.

REcensui Tractatum hunc doctum admodum, acutum and Orthodoxum, eumque
dignissimum judico qui, (in honorem Authoris, Antagonistae vero infamiam, and
in utilitatem publicam) typis mandetur.

April 13. 1641. Johannes Hansley: R. P. Epis. Land. Capel. Domest.

CHAP. I. Of Fraud.
THAT which last came shall be first (...).
served: The Treatise last sent unto me by you, shall be first accounted unto.
Nor will I pick out a word or a sentence to cavil on, but fairly and entirely
take all your discourse therein, concerning one single and several subject.
That which I shall here first insist upon, is your particular Caveat concerning
Altars. Being indeed a several Chapter, and the whole discourse you have, upon
that particular subject.

Give me leave to divide your Chapter into parts: that so I may with less
confusion give account to each several Section. In your Treaties inscribed A
Caveat for a friend.

This following, is your tenth Chapter.

Anonymus.
(A) THeir Judge says. (B) We Christians have an Altar, whereof they have not
power to eat, who serve the Tabernacle, Heb. 13. 10. (C) Again, If thou offer
thy host at the Altar* and there thou remember that thy brother has some
thing against thee, leave there thy offering before the Altar, Matthew. 5. 24.
And so say Roman Catholics. (D) Protestants, either have none, or make it a
thing indifferent, either to have or not to have, as appears by their
practice. And these who have, make not use of them according to the institution
of Altars. For the use of an Altar is to make sacrifice upon: the Altar being
the proper place of the sacrifice: as witnesses King Edward: and the
Protestant Lords of His Council in their Letters, for the taking down of
Altars, and setting up of the Table in stead thereof, in John Fox. Page 1520.

Sir Edward Dering.
(A) THeir Judge says, etc. meaning the holy Scripture: thus you begin six
Chapters. 2.
together: proceed, scoff on. We thank you for such scorns: And with due
reverence do acknowledge this our divine infallible Judge: wondering that any
Christian should decline or slight the written law of Christ our Savior. Go
on to disclaim for your Judge what the holy Ghost has written: Renounce your
part, and deny the Judge to be competent or sufficient. Did you not forget
Saint Paul, who tells Timothy, that The holy Scriptures, 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16.
are able to make him wise unto salvation, -- and that they are profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that
the man of God may be perfect. But belike you find that this Judge is ours in
a double right, one is the due of his place; The other is because he may justly
be called our Judge, for that he voteth for us, and against you.

But notwithstanding that you would pull down holy Scriptures from the Bench,
yet learned men on your side, do hold them there, whether you like thereof or
not. Learned Andradius writing against Remnitius in defense of your Tridentine
Council (lib. 2.) plainly acknowledges the holy Scripture for Judge.
Scripturam Sacram Controversiarum Iudicem constituimus. We do constitute the
holy Scripture Judge of Controversies. He could not say less, yet for fear he
had said too much, he denies this Judge to contain all things necessary; so
would have us to take it for a Judge and no Judge: or in brief for an imperfect
or insufficient Judge. A Judge, but such a one, as fails in things necessary.
O the wisdom of God: how that must suffer by the impious folly of men! God
himself has given us a Judge: But Andradius with others, as Dominicus Ba^nes:
Melchior Canus: Cardinal Hosius: Doctor Stapleton, etc. say that this Judge is
deficient in things necessary to salvation. Is not this plainly to accuse the
wisdom of God, as if he could not, or his goodness as if he would not make
our ^^dge sufficient? Do not the holy Scriptures abound with some things not
necessary for salvation? and has the wisdom of God left out necessaries?

Andradius subjoyneth again: Libri Sacri, praecipui sunt Controversiarum
judices. The holy Books are the principal Judges of Controversy. Mark how
unsteady he is: the Scripture is Judge of controversies: yet defective in
things necessary: and yet the principal Judge of controversies. Thus A double
Iam. 1. 8.
minded man is unstable in all his ways. But your more learned Bellarmine (de
verbo Dei) says Sacra Scriptura regula credendi certissima, tutissimaque est.
The holy Scripture is the most safe and most certain rule of Belife; and again,
Sacris Scripturis -- nihil est notius, nihil certius. Nothing is more known,
nothing more certain, then the holy Scriptures. If then the holy Scriptures be
the most known, and most infallible Rule of Faith (so much do Bellarmines two
places infer) If they be the judge, the chief Judge of Controversies (so much
Andradius two places do determine) leave then your hollow and unsavory scorns,
and submit your self and your cause, unto this holy and heavenly Judge.

But I fear you had rather hold company, with Piggius, Ecchius, Cusanus,
Pereonius, Norris: and others of your bent who (in Tertullians phrase) are
Lucifugae Scripturarum owle-eyed in Sunshine, Run-awayes from the brightness
of the Scriptures. Men that loved darkness, rather then light, because their
Ioh. 3. 19.
deeds (their doctrines) were evil. These men to bring a disregard upon Gods
Sacred Word, give it profane Nicknames. Lesbiam Regulam. Evangelium Nigrum.
Theologiam Atramentariam. Nasum Cereum. A Lesbian Rule; The black Gospel; Inky
Divinity; and a Nose of Wax. You, in as hateful a way of irrision have
invented (or do pretend to have invented) another byword for the sacred Word
of God, and have with smiling scorn (for which you may chance one day to
howl) derided it by name of Sheeps-Cloathing, intimating it to be the wearing
of Wolves, what shall sheep now cloth themselves withal? I pray (without
scorn) show me what other clothing you have for the sheep?

But I must not stay thus at the threshold, the door is open, and I now am
entering within the walls of your discourse: yet again saluting you at my
entrance, with thanks, for yiedling us the honor, and our true Right, in
having the holy Scriptures for our Judge. But take heed of this and consider
it, next time you shall read Saint Paul (to the Romans) who will there put you
in mind of that great and terrible day, when (as he Romans 2 16.
says) God shall judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ, according to his
Gospel. Which Gospel you dare not deny to be a written Gospel. Take heed then
how you mock our Judge hereafter, since that you hear your own doom shall be
by Jesus Christ the eternal Judge, according to our present Judge, The written
Gospel.

Anonymus.
(B) WE (Christians) have an Altar, whereof they have not power to eat who
serve the Tabernacle, Heb. 13. 10.

Sir Edward Dering.
THe title of your Chapter, and your pretension is to prove the use of Altars
even by our Judge the holy Scriptures. This Text you bring against us, and for
your self Habemus Altar, we have an Altar, says Saint Paul. If there be no
more but this, The Text has as much for us as for you: we also have, and ever
had this Altar. But that which you assume to prove, and would pretend to be
hereby proved (or else you say nothing to the cause in difference between us)
is, that we have not such Altars as you have. How is this? we have Altars
figuratively and improperly so called: But you have Altars, material Altars,
and properly so called. Here then lies all the difference: and upon this hinge
the whole cause does turn: whether Saint Paul do here mean a material, visible
and a proper Altar!

You have daily sacrifice, properly called sacrifice (as you say) and therefore
by the necessary consequence of Relatives, you must have (or say you have)
Altars properly so called. This is the true state of the Difference between us:
you may believe Cardinal Bellarmin who takes it for granted on both sides
Altaria non consuevisse erigi, nisi ad De miss. lib. 1. cap. 16.
sacrificia proprie dicta. The Altars use not to be erected, unless for
sacrifices properly so called. And again, Sine De cultu Sanct. lib. 3. cap. 4.
Altari non potest sacrificari, without an Altar, sacrifice can not be. And a
third time in his first Book of the mass. Nunquam Altar proprie dictum
erigitur, nisi ad Lib. 1. c. 14.
Sacrificia proprie dicta. An Altar properly so called, is never erected, but
for sacrifices properly so called. Now you pretending that your Sacrifices are
proper Sacrifices must contend for Altars properly so called. The nature of
Relatives is such that as Sacrifice and Altar, do in general relate each to
other: so of necessity, if one be proper the other must be proper: if one
improper the other improper also. If then you prove not the propriety of your
Sacrifice, you are gone for your Altar: and if you prove not your erroneous
transubstantiation, you are gone from your proper Sacrifice. But you have not
gone this way, and therefore I will not strive to refute you this way. But
briefly meet and close with you upon this Text alleged: which Text if it prove
an Altar properly so called, the cause is yours: and I will yield my self to
Rome. If this Text do not prove it for you, nor any other: Do you give glory to
God, and submit unto our Judge.

But by what means shall we now try the true sense of these words, and the
meaning of the Apostle (or rather of the Holy Ghost) herein. That this may
appear: I offer you afair trial, and Judges undeclinable.

1. The plain series, and scope of the context it self. 2. The opinion and
interpretation of the ancient Fathers. 3. The opinion and confession of your
own eminent Doctors: and others within these last 600. years.
First. The Text is not for you: for we differ not about having and not having
an Altar; but. 4.
(as is said) about an Altar proper for Sacrifice proper: wherein the words of
this Text come far short: and the sense of this Text is far more distant.
Our (...) our holy Table is a holy Altar: yet neither your Altar, nor our Holy
Table here intended by this Text. What then is the meaning of Habemus Altar?
mark the context. (...), etc. We have an Altar, whereof to eat, etc. You will
not say, Saint Paul here meant the eating of a material Altar. Be it, of stone
or wood, your teeth had need be iron: if you say there is a figure in the word
Eat, I say, that must necessarily infer the same figure in the word Altar. If
then this Text can not be interpreted of a material Altar, what have you to
do, to produce it against us for your material Altars? Let the Apostle expound
himself, and he will plainly show you what Sacrifice he would have, and then
tell me what Altar must be for such Sacrifice! Presently he begins to apply his
speech unto our blessed Savior, and so annexing his conclusion to his
premises (Ergo, etc. says he) By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of
Verse 15.
praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to
his name. Do you mark what manner of sacrifices are here commended unto us? can
you find any use of a proper material Altar for them? would you have a
visible Altar, for invisible Sacrifice?

Beside, it will not be enough for you, to find Habemus Altane, we have an
Altar, but you must get a Text Habemus Altaria, we have a plurality of Altars,
else your practice will prove unjustifiable, when God with his Quo warranto
shall demand of you, as the Prophet enquireth. To what purpose is the multitude
Isai. 1. 11, 12.
of your sacrifices unto me, says the Lord? -- Who has required this at your
hand?

Secondly. To come to my second sort of proofs 5.
and withal to show you what Altar is here meant: I do affirm, that no one, or
not above one of the holy Fathers in the pure primitive Church has interpreted
this, or any other place, to a material proper Altar: But do constantly and
generally teach and express themselves that our Altar and our Sacrifices now
are Rational, Spiritual, Eucharisticall, Invisible, etc. All which shall
appear in their own words and language. Saint Hierome (on the 50. Psalm.)
Sacrificium, id est, confessio ex ore peccatoris: oblatio, hoc est laudatio. --
Altar, Fides. -- Vitulum lauds. -- Victimas; scilicet ut me ipsum offeram.
Sacrifice, that is to say, Confession from the mouth of a sinner: Oblation,
that is Lauding. -- An Altar, Faith -- the Galvas Praise. -- Victimes, as much
as to say, that I offer up my self. And again (upon the 25. Psalm.) Vnusquisque
Sanctus, Altar Domini in se habet, quod est Fides. Every Holy man has an
Altar of the Lord in himself, which is Faith. And a third time (on the 9. of
Saint Mark) Altar Dei, est cor bonorum; hostiae and Sacrificia, bona opera
fidelium. The Altar of God, is the Heart of good men: Hoasts and Sacrifices,
are the good works of the Faithful.

Saint Augustine (de civit. Dei. lib. 10. cap. 4.) Dei Templum simul omnes, and
singuli templa sumus. -- Ejus est Altar, cor nostrum. -- Ei Sacrificamus
hostiam humilitatis, and laudis, in ara cordis igne fervidae charitatis. We are
all together the Temple of God, and all of us several are Temples. -- His
Altar is our Heart. -- We sacrifice unto him the sacrifice of humility, and of
praise, upon the Altar of our Heart with the fire of fervent charity.

Lactantius. (de vero cultu. lib. 6. cap. 25.) Duo sunt quae offerri debent,
Donum and Sacrificium. -- Vtrunque incorporale. -- Donum est integritas animi,
Sacrificium laus and Hymni. Two things there are which ought to be offered, a
gift, and a Sacrifice. -- Both incorporeall. -- The gift is Integrity of mind,
the Sacrifice is Praise and Psalms. For this incorporeall Sacrifice you can
not plead any use of a corporeal Altar.

Saint Ambrose (upon this very Epistle to the Hebrews) tells you that your
Altar must be invisible, Quia nihil est visibile horum, neque Sacerdos, neque
Sacrificium, neque Altar: For nothing is visible of these, neither the Priest,
nor the Sacrifice, nor the Altar.

Bernard (in festo omnium Scrip. Sermon. 4.) up on that Text (Revel. 6. 9.)
concerning the souls under the Al^ar, says, Altar ipsum -- nihil aliud
arbitrer esse quam corpus ipsum Domini Salvatoris. The Altar it self -- I
suppose to be nothing else but the very body of our Lord and Savior.

So much for the Latin Fathers, and to let you see that the Greek Fathers
agree both with them and us, look first in Hesychius Bishop of Jerusalem, (lib
1. cap. 4. and lib. 6. cap. 21.) who will tell you the same that Bernard does,
expounding this Altar to be the blessed body of Christ.

Clemens Alexandrinus (lib. 7. Stromat*) complains as we may justly do in
these words. (...). They will not believe us when we say that an Altar truly
holy, is a righteous Soul, and holy prayer the incense from thence. So this
ancient Father against the Idolatrous heathen, and thus we against the
superstitious Papists.

Nazianzen the Divine (in his 42. Oration) says, (...) Let us Sacrifice, not
young Calves, nor Lambs -- but let us Sacrifice to God, the Sacrifice of
praise, upon the Altar which is above, together with the Quire that is above.
-- Let us Sacrifice our selves to God. The Latin renders it with the
celestial Quire, that you may know what Above is here meant.

Saint Chrysostom will tell you (in his 17. Homil. on this Epistle to the
Hebrews) that our Savior is both Priest and Sacrifice. (...) But if our
Savior be Priest and Sacrifice, where is our Altar? Epiphanius will resolve
you that (Lib. 2. tom. 1. Haeres.) (...) He (our Savior Jesus Christ) is our
Sacrifice: He is our Priest: He is our Altar. There is the word in your Text
alleged and there is the sense according to the ancient Fathers, and the
Church reformed; which is as they were.

In the Third place, that you may see, that a 6.
Prelate in our Land has said true, concerning the worth and strength of this
your argument out of this Text, when he said that Your selves (the Papist) have
thrown away this argument as a leaden dagger, of no use in your day of battle:
Let Bellarmine be judge, who desirous to plead for your Altars, does yet
dismiss this place thus. Habemus Altar, etc. (Quia (says he, de miss. lib.
1. c. 14.) non desunt ex Catholicis qui eo loco per Altar intelligunt crucem,
aut ipsum Christum, non urgeo ipsum locum: Because there want not some
Catholics, who in this place by the Altar understand the Cross, or Christ
himself, I do not urge this place? And again, (cap. 17.) speaking of your
Altars, he confesses and yeildeth that the Apostles did not use the words
Priest, Sacrifice, Temple, Altar, etc. So that when you show any such thing in
their writings, you shall withal show Bellarmine ignorant in his.

The Divines of Collen (in their Antididagma de miss. Sacrif.. Posthac.)
speaking of this Text and the Altar here intended, do say (Habemus Altar,
etc.) in quo and per quod omnes Christiani, universa Sacrificia spiritualia
Fidei, Devotionis, Gratiarum actionis, Spei and charitatis Deo patri debent
offerre. We have an Altar, etc. On which and by which, all Christians ought to
offer God the Father the universal spiritual Sacrifices, of Faith, Devotion,
Thanksgiving, Hope and Charity.

Your Angelical Saint (Thomas of Aquine,) in his commentary upon these very
words) says, Istud Altar vel est Crux Christi, in qua Christus immolatus est,
vel ipse Christus in quo and per quem preces nostras offerimus. This Altar
either it is the Cross of Christ, on which Christ was sacrificed, or Christ
himself in whom, and by whom we offer up our prayers.

Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury upon this very Text, expounds the word
Altar to be the very body of Christ: His words are, Tangit consuetudinem legis,
and ad spiritalem intelligentiam revocat -- licentiam edere de nostro Altari,
id est, accipere corpus domini. He touches the custom of the Law, and calls
them back to a spiritual understanding -- liberty to cate of our Altar, that
is, to receive the Body of our Lord.

I must put among your Authors the Mass of Saint James, which since I know you
value highly, I pray answer seriously. There I find both Altar and Sacrifice,
thus. (...), etc. Grant us O Lord with all fear and pure conscience, to render
unto thee, this spiritual and unbloudy sacrifice: Which thou receiving into
thy holy, and super-celestiall and intellectual Altar as the odor of a
spiritual sweetness, etc.

Parallel to this, is that in the liturgy of Saint Chrysostom: (...). We offer
to thee, O Christ, O God, incense, in the Odor of spiritual sweetness. Which
receive (O Lord) into thy holy and super-celestiall, and intellectual Altar.
The vulgar Bible Printed at Paris 1573. with an angle Table at the latter end,
has this express declaration of the sense of this Text, Altar nostrum
Christus. Our Altar is Christ: referring to this very Text for proof thereof.

You may look more in Catharinus, and Estius. Occumenius, Lombard, Gorran,
Lyra, and others, for these already vouched do satisfy me.

You proceed and I follow you: you arm your self with another Text, (Matthew. 5.
23. and 24.) If 7.
thou offer thy host at the Altar, and there thou remember that thy brother
has something against thee, leave there thy offering before the Altar. If this
prove your material Altar, or Altar proper, for Sacrifices properly so called:
then

-- Tu Phyltida solus habeto. The Altar is yours. If it do not. If it come
impertinent, and nothing near the point in difference for which you do pretend
it, indeed you then have lost your Phyllis. If our Savior do here speak
tropically in this word Altar, then your inference from hence is gone. If he
speak literally, yet consider when, and to whom he spoke. The Jewish Altar was
then standing, and this then might be literal to their ears, which unto
future Christians (after his consummatum est) might, and ought to be
figuratively taken. The place it self does clearly show our Savior here to use
the word Altar, as a Metaphor Elegant, plain, and piercing: look the next Verse
(being a part of the same Paragraphe, or rather an exposition of this) and you
will find there the Way, the Officer, the Prison, the Farthing. Yet you will
not infer a material, visible, ordinary, and with us, properly so called,
Way, Officer, Prison, Farthing: and why then a material, visible, proper,
Altar?

But not to let pass a forgery, without branding it, I perceive you are so
superstitiously addicted to your Altars, that you force the holy Word of God to
speak more for you in English, then ere it did in any other Language. You may
do well in time, when you are Inquisitor general, for the making a purgatory
table to the Word of God, as has been done for too many grave and good Writers
else. Are you sure you have alleged a true Text? Here I find all couched
together in a breath: in one text, Altar, host and offering. Thus you allege,
If thou offer thy host at the Altar. Is it your own translation, or have you
taken it upon implicit Faith? Whosoever it is, it is Graeca fide: but with no
true Faith to the Greek original.

I will not contend with you upon the word Offer, because you have had bad
leaders in that construction. The Rhemist have done so before you, although the
primary sense of (...) be ad-ferre, and more secondarily ob-ferre. By which
reason, and by the clear context of the place, our English translators might
well be induced, to render it Bring rather then Offer; The reason may plainly
appear, in that our Savior here speaks unto the multitude (as in the last
verse of the foregoing Chapter, and in the first of this is to be seen) which
multitude of the Jews might bring gifts, but surely not offer Sacrifice as you
have construed it.

But letting these words Bring and Offer pass: 8.
how come you here by the word Host between Offer and Altar? If thou will
offer thy Host at the Altar, etc. Is this your Faith, Anonymus? where, and by
what means comes this Host, so fit in your way, to cosen your English Readers
with? will you make the Scriptures speak Sacrifice for you whether they will or
no? Beware of Nadab, and Abihu, They offered strange fire, and you here offer
strange Levi. 10. 1.
Sacrifice. Be not so ready to offer the Sacrifice, but hear the Word of God in
it is Truth, as our English translation has it. If thou bring thy gift to the
Altar, etc. Great odds between bringing a gift, and offering a Sacrifice.
Subornation of witnesses (which is a notorious practice on your side, by
maintenance of false Fathers, and of false pieces of True Fathers, and by
additions, and by substractions made to their works) yet is not half so bad as
to corrupt the Judge. You in particular, (your cause being bad) do endeavor to
corrupt our Judge.

The Authentic Greek and all Translation that I have seen out of it, are all
against you. First the Greek it self, (...): next your vulgar Latin, and the
two contending Translations of your two succeeding Popes, Sixtus V. and Clement
VIII. all agree and render this in Latin: Munus Tuum. The French has, Tondon.
The old Saxon thine lac, the same word for gift as ( Luke 21. 1.) he geseh
elegan hyra lac sendan on the one sceoppan. He saw the Rich men casting hyra lac
their gifts into the Treasury. By what authority do you leave your public
English Translation of Rhemes? They rightly have rendered it, Thy Gift. But you
Thy Host. Who taught you to construe the Greek (...), by the Latin Hostia?
what Grammar, Dictionary, example, or good authority have you for your
translation? Is not this sowing of Tares amongst good Corn. This Hostia comes
ab Hostibus.

Hostibus a domitis hostia nomen habet. An enemy Ovid. Matthew. 13.
has done this, says our Savior, in the Parable, speaking of him that sowed
Tares. So this Hostia comes in ab Host, from an enemy to Truth, if you loved
Truth, you would not, you durst not falsify. Consider you are old, and leave
this dawbing Ezech 13. 10.
with untempered mortar: In the mean time God send them who trust you care and
conscience to beware of you.

If I speak freely, I cannot tell how to excuse you, or to make this less then
a most wilful fraud: the distance being so wide in every Language. (...) and
(...). Donum and Sacrificium, Gift and Host. You have had no false guides
(that I see) to mislead you, here is no probability for a fair mistake. Will
you plead ignorance of Greek? Why then are you so bold to be a translator? Yet
I cannot deny your ignorance in that Language, until you do write your long
counterfeited Greek name aright. I remember well that you told me there was but
one Greek letter in difference between the Arrian and the Orthodox, one August.
1637.
Epsilon you said, but finding my wonder in looking up into your face, you did
indeed correct that error, and said it was Omega. Lastly, because since I saw
you last, I received from you but three words in Greek, whereof one was
unpointed, and another of the three, was so far from Orthography, that it was
no Greek.

Furthermore, not to teach you (I have more ^ 9.
modesty) but to show you that I have otherwise learned, then as you expound. I
do find that (...) (the word in this text) is derived from (...), just as the
Latin Donum from Dono, and because gifts are given and presented with the
hand, Pliny Lib 35 cap. 14.
does tell you Graeci Antiqui (...) Palmum vocabant, and ideo (...) munera,
quia manu darentur. The ancient Greeks called the Palm of the hand (...), and
therefore called gifts (...), because with the hand they were given.

By this time it appears seasonable for me to use the words of your own Doctor
Triple-cord. (. 5.) All sides agree, that it is most impious to corrupt the
words, or true sense of Scripture, by adding, or substracting, mistranslating,
or false interpreting. But you appear guilty of mistranslating, and of
corrupting the sense of Scripture, Ergo, All sides, etc. It further appears
that (setting aside the fraud of your word Host) this Text does not speak of
Sacrifice but of gifts: of Gifts brought by the people, not offered, for the
offering is stayed: the words of our Savior are plain: who stops the offering
thus -- If thou bring thy gift, etc. -- and there, etc. -- go -- and then come
and offer: Not as your Rhemist (and you worse then they). If thou offer -- go
-- and then come and offer, etc. Which can hardly be made a sensible period.

I have an old Manuscript that concurreth very well herein: it is of this
Gospel by Saint Matthew (written before the Bible was divided into Chapters:
together with a brief commentary thereon, where the word relinque ibi munus,
leave there thy gift, is expounded, Differ offerre: Defer to offer: The
meaning is that though thou bring thy gift, yet thou may est not offer thy
gift, because our Savior commands the offering of it, (not the bringing it)
to be stayed until reconcilement first tendered. And then come and offer thy
gift, as our Savior says. So that your text here alleged, viz. If thou offer
thy Host, must be new Englished thus, If thou bring thy gift.

You saw that from this Altar in this Text, you could by no Analogy prove your
Romish Altars, therefore to draw it nearer to you: you thought good to mend the
Text: hoping thereby to gull some English Readers, who finding Offer Host and
Altar, all in a breath, a period, might then swallow you Roman sense in all.
Are these your Piae frauds? light and darkness: Truth and a lie shall meet
together with the same greeting as Fraud and Piety. I can not digest this
corrupted Text of yours, until I have made this expostulatory question to you
which I find in Athanasius. (...). What folly of immodesty is this in you, to
speak things that are not written, and to conceit things different from Piety.

Now the Text is freed, make your best use of 10.
it. If you would prove the point in controversy, why do you not make your
inference upon the Text, and so conclude, and tie it to your cause? here is no
such work. You do not look (I hope) that I should make your argument for you!
If you do, I can make no more but this. Our Savior preaching of forgiveness
and brotherly atonement upon injuries received, bids us Leave our gift
before the Altar -- and be reconciled. So does our Church when in our approach
to the holy Communion we are charged. If any of us -- be in maliee, etc. -- not
to come to the holy Table: Which Holy Table is both Table and Altar, properly a
Table, improperly an Altar: primarily a Table, where in a holy and most
admirable Communion we receive the body and blood of Jesus Christ: Secondarily
an Altar, (but improperly so called) where immediately after, We do offer our
selves, our souls, and bodies, to be a reasonable holy and lively Sacrifice.

If you mark it well, you shall find the name of Table in the first age of
Christianity to have the forehand of the word Altar. I need not prove this to
you, further then by your learned Cardinal. Apostoli non utebantur nominibus
Sacerdotii, Sacrificii, Bell de miss. lib. 1, c. 17.
Templi, Altaris, etc. The Apostles did not use the name of Priesthood,
Sacrifice, Temple, Altar. If then the first age did un-learn the use of Altars,
and gave us the use of a Table, what would you prove, unless in your proof you
confess the name of Altar to be reducible to the use of Table.

The holy Scriptures tell me that the blessed Sacrament was celebrated, at or
upon a Table. So Saint Luke (22. 21.) (...) on the Table. (And that I might not
doubt what manner of Table, this (...) was, Saint Luke again does tell me,
(16.2.) that Lazarus desired to be fed with the crumbs which fell (...) from the
Table). The same word in both places.

I find again that the twelve Apostles did ordain seven Deacons, because they
would not themselves intermit their praying and preaching (...) to serve
Tables. Which Tables you will not doubt were Sacramental Tables: could you
find two such Texts for your Altars, how quick you would be upon me! But now I
suppose you will be quiet.

And that you may guess how un-altar-like these Tables were, you may take the
Grammarians Etymology of the word (...) from (...) a fourefooted Table. The
same word used by Nonnus of Panopolis, who describes our Savior and his
Apostles sitting round about the Table (which posture an Altar cannot admit.)
On the 13. of S. John.
(...).


It is time to close and make an end of this piece. 11.
I desire to avoid all tedious prolixity, yet am guilty before I am aware. But
have patience, and read the Holy Fathers Athanasius, Ambrose, and Augustine
upon this very Text by you alleged. Athanasius (quaest. ad Antiochum, qu. 73.)
calls this gift (...) Prayer. For which the propriety of your Altar is no use.

S. Ambrose will teach you what gift, and what Altar also: (in his Book de
vitiorum, virtutumque conflictu. c. 9. Munus nostrum est oration nostra: Altar
vero nostrum est cor. Our gift is our prayer, our Altar is our heart. You will
confess that to be an invisible Altar.

Saint Augustine also (de verbis Domini Sermon. 16.) expounds what gift is here
expected, saying, Te quarit Deus, God seeks thee. And I hope we may offer up
our selves, without the help of a material proper Altar!

I do think you cannot bring any man ancient or modern, of modesty and
learning, that voucheth this Text for your Altars, but only your audacious
Coccius, (who will venture any thing): yet even he, has the word gift not
host. Take then your corrupted Text again, and confess, that even by that,
muchlesse by our Judge the pure and holy Scriptures, you neither have, nor can
approve your Altars, or convince us, as you pretend.

Anonymus.
(D) PRotestants either have none, or make it a thing indifferent, either to
have or not. 12.
to have, as appears by their practice. And these who have, make not use of
them, according to the institution of Altars. For the use of an Altar is to
make Sacrifice upon, the Altar being the proper place of the Sacrifice: as
witnesses King Edward: and the Letters for the taking down of Altars, and
setting up of the Table in stead thereof: in John Fox. page 1520.

Sir Edward Dering.
THe plain stating of the point in controversy, before set down, is answer
enough unto this Paragraph. I may confess all this true, but that you intend
it for an accusation. If then you think it a blame in us, in that you find
indifferently the name of Table and Altar, (that is Table proper, and Altar
improper) you do in this blame the Ancient for being Protestants, and us for
being Orthodox and Catholic with them.

Does not Gregory Nyssen (in Bapt. Christ.) indifferently, and in one breath,
give us this double name? (...). The Holy Table is an immaculate Altar.

Athanasius. (disput. cont. Arium) has (...). The Table, that is the holy
Altar.

Your own Masses ascribed to Saint James, Basil, and Chrysostom, have
indifferently the terms Table, and Altar.

You tell us that an Altar is a proper place of Sacrifice. True, and therein
after a sort you confess the state of the question. An Altar proper, is the
proper place, for proper Sacrifice: and therefore we have no such Altar because
we have no such Sacrifice. For proof of this (which we grant you) you vouch the
Letters aforesaid, but the place you aim at is, in the reasons after the
Letters: and is the fourth reason there in these words.

Fourthly, the form of an Altar was ordained for the Sacrifices of the Law: and
therefore the Altar in Greek is called (...), quasi Sacrificii locus. But now
both the Law and the Sacrifices thereof do cease: wherefore the form of the
Altar, used in the Altar, ought to cease withal.

I conclude that you will stay longer then you expect, in purgatory, in spite
of all privileges to your order granted: or else you will never come into that
place: because you are so superstitious in your Altars, and have abused Gods
holy Word, to color your superstition. But Repentance and amending may help
you to Heaven, which graces, God in his mercy bestow upon you. In the mean time
the way to obtain those graces, is to acknowledge your Fraud in depraving one
of these Texts, and in misapplying both.

CHAP. II. Of Folly.
I Received from you (the 21. of April last) a manuscript of your own, called:
1.
A Tract of prayer to Saints, with an Epistle prefixed, directed to my self.
Omitting a multitude of most impertinent allegations, and imperfect inferences
I desire you to look into your last Chapter of that Treatice. The Title whereof
follows.

Anonymus.
HErein is proved, by the testimonies of the Ancient Fathers, that the Saints
in Heaven know the present secrets of the heart of man.

Sir Edward Dering.
THese are the contents. And now we are to treat of the Saints of God, that at
this present are in Heaven. In them we are to consider their knowledge: and in
it the extent of this knowledge, by Anonymus here delivered to be, even by
knowledge of the present secrets of the heart of man. What is Omni-sciency if
this be not? The heart of man is deceitful, above all things, and desperately
wicked: Who can know it? I the Lord search it. You Iere. 17. 9.
will make the Saints to be Gnostics indeed, Cardiognosticks! But better
authority reserveth the attribute (...) as peculiar to God alone. So 2 Chro. 6.
30. Iere. 20. 12. 1 Samuel 16. 7. 1 Chro. 28. 9. Eccles. 9. 5. and Revel. 2. 23.

Anonymus. CHAP. 18.
THe ancient Fathers affirm that the Saints in 2.
Heaven see, and know the present secrets of the hearts of men, as Saint
Ambrose, (in his Book of Widows) saying, The Martyrs or Saints are our
Prelates and beholders of our lives and actions.

Sir Edward Dering.
THe word Saints is not in Saint Ambrose, but your own interposition. I will
not stand upon the word Martyrs, which in English is Witnesses. S. Ambrose
says Dei Martyrs nostri praesules, etc. But to the point: what do they
behold? you say well, our lives and actions. And what I pray is that to the
secrets of our hearts? Is this a leading proof to your purpose? I would whip my
boy at School if he should bring me an exercise so impertinent to his theme.

Yet you shall have Ambrose for Ambrose. (look his Comment. 1 Cor. c. 2.)
Manifestum est (says he) cogitationes nostras a nullo sciri, nisi ab animo
nostro. It is clear that our thoughts are known by none, but by our own Soul.
And again (on the first Chapter to the Romans) first sleighting that wretched
excuse (so he calls it) of going to God, as to a King by his Courtiers, he there
concludes plainly, Ad Deum -- promerendum, Suffragatore non opus est, sed
mente devota. Unto the promeriting of God we have no need of one that helps
with his good words, but of a devoute mind.

Anonymus.
SAint Gregory (in his 40. Homily) says, Because the Saints see the clarity of
their Creator, 3.
therefore there is nothing done in any Creature which they cannot see.

Sir Edward Dering.
OUt again. This is concerning things done, and what is that unto the secret of
man's heart? you are out, begin again.

Anonymus.
AGain Saint Gregory (in his 12. Book of Meralls, c. 13.) says, we must
believe, that they who see the clarity of the omnipotent God within themselves,
are not ignorant of any thing that is done without.

Sir Edward Dering.
YOur promise is of thoughts within, and your proof still of things done
without. Well shot. Go to your Book again and study the point better: are you
lazy, or are you weak, or is your cause ill? He that whistles daily to his
Cart, has Logic enough to distinguish between matter of fact done, and the
secret thought of heart.

You shall have Gregory for Gregory, and that in this very Chapter, an
objection by him made, and do you find his answer there if you can. Sicut
Corporea atque incorporea diversa sunt genere, ita sunt distincta cognitione.
As corporeal and incorporeall are of a several genus, so are they also
distinct in knowledge. How shall these thus distinct know one another, even
concerning things done, much more concerning thoughts; S. Gregory has not
answered for himself: do you undertake it.

Anonymus.
SAint Basil (in his Book of Virginity) faith, there is not any Saint, which
does not see all 4.
things that are done any where in the world.

Sir Edward Dering.
YOu know I am an easy workman, and you take care to set me easy work.
Whether Basil have these words in that long Book, or no, I can not readily
find. But if you will open your eyes, you may confess, that they who see all
things done, may yet be ignorant of all secrets thought and imagined.

Anonymus.
SAint Prosper in his Book of contemplative life is of the same opinion,
saying. Nothing 5.
is so secret as the knowledge thereof may be denied unto the perfectly
blessed: their seeing God with pure understanding being without comparison a
thing more excellent.

Sir Edward Dering.
BIshop Prosper says, (as you allege) Nothing is so secret, etc. Now the
general acceptance, and meaning of the word Nothing is No thing, and that is
Nothing to your purpose. But I have found these words in Prosper: and you shall
have them and more. The title of his Chapter is De resurrectione, etc. Of the
Resurrection to come; not of the present Saints now in Heaven: he speaks
their of our future Beatitude receptis cum immortalitate corporibus. When our
bodies shall be immortal. And then says that in that blessed contemplative
life, Ibi ita patebunt singulorum singulis mentes sicut corporalibus oculis
subjacent facies corporales. Every ones mind to every one, shall there so lie
open, as corporal faces are exposed to corporal eyes.

Thus it shall be then, and there at the Resurrection, and in Heaven. -- Now
goes he on to your words. Nec latebit jam perfect beatos aliquid Secretorum,
qui -- ipsum visuri sunt mundis cordibus Deum. None of these things that are
secret shall now lie hid to the perfectly blessed, who shall see God himself
with pure hearts.

Thus your Saints in Prosper know the secrets of one another minds in Heaven,
after the Resurrection, and what (I pray) is that to the present Saints in
Heaven? and to there knowing the present secrets of men's hearts on earth? I am
ashamed to be put to answer such weak, so poor, so worthless, and impertinent
arguments: but you are another Xenocrates; and though I be not worthy to hold
the candle to Aristotle. Yet I will borrow his words of indignation reported by
Plutarch: (...), it is a shame for me to hold peace, when Xenocrates takes upon
him to teach. But I proceed unto your last authority.

Anonymus.
SAint Augustine (in his 22. Book of the City of God, Chap. 29.) says; The
Saints of 6.
God, even with the eyes of their body closed up, shall see all things, not
only present, but also from which they are corporally absent: for then shall
be that perfection, whereof the Apostle says, we now prophecy but in part,
then the imperfect shall be taken away.

Sir Edward Dering.
I Cannot in that place find the words you cite, nor need I care: it is enough
that the words themselves, as you produce them, do prove nothing of that you
intend them for. The Saints (you say) with the eyes of their body closed up,
etc. But you believe their bodies, and their bodily eyes, shall not be in
Heaven, until the general Resurrection: So then Saint Augustine and Prosper
speak not of the Saints now in Heaven: and therefore nothing to your question.

That Saint Augustine could not so mean, you may read what I am sent unto, by
your Francis a St Clare, in his 37. and last Problem. Who tells me, that
Saint Augustine did doubt whether the Saints departed do yet, before the
general Resurrection enjoy the Beatificall Vision: or that rather they be in
certain occult and hidden receptacles until then. The places are pregnant. Qui
morte obierunt, secret is animarum, receptaculis, sedibusque requiescunt. The
dead, do rest in secret receptacles, and De civitate Dei. lib. 12. cap. 9.
seats of souls. And again, in his Retractations (lib. 1. cap. 14.) De sanctis
hominibus jam defunctis, utrum ipsi saltem d^cendi sint in illa possessione
consistere, merito quaeritur. Of holy men already departed, whether they at
least may be said to be in that possession (that is of Beatitude) may
deservedly be questioned. If there present state of Beatitude may (in Saint
Augustines opinion) be deservedly questioned, how can you think that he should
say that the present Saints in Heaven, see all that is done on earth, much
more, what is thought in the heart of man? Thus Saint Augustine is no more for
you then the other Fathers were, even in that chosen piece you have vouched
your self: But to let you see that you have no shadow to shelter your self
withal under that eminent Father, read in his Book (de cura pro mortuis) Cap.
13.
and you shall find his opinion clear in this point. Ibi sunt spiritus
defunctorum, ubi non vident quaecunque aguntur aut eveniunt ista vita
hominibus. The spirits of men departed are there, where they do not see,
whatsoever is done, or does chance to men in this life: If not what is done,
then much less what is thought.

The same Father begins his 15. Chapter, of Care for the dead, with these
words; Proinde fatendum est, nescire quidem mortuos quid hic agatur. --
Furthermore, it is to be confessed, that the dead know not what is done here,
-- And so goes on to declare that the dead if they know, do know by relation
of such as pass by death, from hence unto them. Thus by Saint Augustines
opinion, the dead see neither thoughts nor actions here below. So have you (as
in some before) Saint Augustine for S. Augustine; make your Reply when you^ can.

In the mean time you are not the man; whose right hand should support old
Troy, or your Troy-discended Romans. As my Uncle Dering in his restraint of Mr
Hardings untruthes (Printed 1568.) said unto Master Harding, so say I unto you,
in consideration of these pitiful helps to so poor a cause. They that favor
your doings, may bewail with Andromach, lifting up your weak hands of Astyanax,
and say, Spes nullas habet Troja si istas habet.


Your Troy has no hope at all, if it have no hope but this.

A word or two, for the opinion of your own Doctors, and a Text of holy
Scripture, and so. 7.
adieu for this point. I might trouble you, with abundant vouchers out of the
Fathers, as of Saint Hierome who proves our Savior to be God, by On Matt. 9.
that very argument, (because he knew the secrets of man's heart. But you shall
be paid in your own current coin. Your Doctor Thomas of Aquine. 1. p. q. 57.
a^. 4.
Cognoscere cogitationes cordis est proprium Dei (and on Iere. 17.) Ergo Angeli
non cognoscunt secreta cordis. To know the cogitations of the heart, is the
property of God: -- Therefore the Angels know not the secrets of the heart. And
again, Cognoscere singularia, and cogitata and facta 1. p. q. 12. ar. 8.
little, non est de perfectione intellectus creati. To know particulars, and the
thoughts and acts of them, is not of the perfection of a created understanding.
Dominicus ^annes says, Nullus beatus videt in divina essentia omnia individua,
omnes cogitationes eorum, etc. No blessed Saint does see in the divine Essence
all individualls, or all their thoughts, etc. Durandus. Si quaeratur an 4. d.
45. q. 4. p. 4^3.
beati, cognitione beata, cognoscunt orationes nostras, dicendum quod non. If
the question be, whether the blessed Saints, in their blessed knowledge do know
our prayers, it is to be answered they do not. If not our prayers, then not the
secret of our hearts.

Take one word more, more worth then All. It is a piece of that excellent
prayer of King Solomon, at the dedication of the Temple, where he beseeching
God to hear the prayers of every man, and of all the people there, to be made,
acknowledges the omniscient glory of God in these words, For thou, even thou
only know the 1 King 8. 39.
hearts of all the children of men. Now I shall never hear more of you in this
point: But what a delinquency of Reason and common sense is this, to pretend
proof for Thought of heart, and to bring none but for Things done? Is not this
Folly.

CHAP. III. Foul-Language.
FRom Foily to Foul-Language. That is the progress of many: who when they are
pressed with a bad cause, 1.
or do labor in their own Ignorance, they (rather then submit) will fly to
Railing Language, a sure sign, and absolute Symptom that the brain is empty
of good, or the heart full of ill.

I need not part and divide this piece, your self have figured it into four and
twenty. I will presume so much upon your new age, and a sober reveiw of them,
that you will not expect from me, a confutation, of those things whereof you
will be now ashamed to hear the repetition. I have shown this piece to diverse
of your own religion who all turn from it, as from gross and unsavory railing.
But to the particulars.

In your Treatise Jesus, Maria, Joseph, Chap. 70. 2.
Page 370. Your charity bestowing on us the odious name of heretics, thus you
begin.

1. They say they are justified by Faith only, without keeping the
Commandments; and Saint James says, The devils believe and tremble.

2. They say they can do no good works; but that all their best works are of
their own nature, worthy of eternal pains: and the works of the devils can be
no worse.

3. They say they cannot merit: no more can devils.

4. They say they have no inherent grace, no more have devils.

5. They say, that notwithstanding all the repentance which they can make, yet
their sins still remain in them: and so is it with devils.

6. They have no Mass, or memory of our Savior, voluntarily offering up
himself, for our redemption, no more have devils.

7. They do not pray to Angels, or Saints, to pray unto God for them, no more
do devils.

8. They have no respect, or reverence to pictures or images of God, or his
Saints, no more have devils.

9. They do not esteem of the Sacrament of penance, or confession, no more do
devils.

10. They do not reverence the bodies, and relics of Saints, no more do
devils.

11. They beat down crosses and crucifixes; and in all hell there is not found
one.

12. They say they cannot bless, or give a blessing to any creature, no more
can devils.

13. They say, that they cannot love God with all their hearts, nor keep his
Commandments, no more can devils.

14. They have no Sacraments which confer grace, no more have devils.

15. They hate ceremonies, and devils use none.

16. They say they have no free will to do good, no more have devils.

17. They use no indulgences, no more do devils.

18. All may teach, and preach amongst them: and so it is amongst the devils.

19. They have no holy or consecrated places, no more have devils.

20. They use no holy water, or holy oils, no more do devils.

21. They have no purgatory, no more have devils.

22. They have no Altars or Sacrifices, no more have devils.

23. They allege Scriptures, according to their own private judgment, and so
did the devils, Luke 4.

24. Their whole congregation may err: and so may all the devils.

Are not these all together a mass of Fraud, Folly, and Foul-Language? Find
one if you can and 3.
choose it out, of the 24. which is true, serious, and relisheth of a Christian
Spirit! I am none of them that will (...): and if any man seem to be 1 Cor. 11.
16.
contentious, we have no such custom, neither the Churches of God. It were a
silly endeavor to stamp the same metal, into the like coin, and so pay
you, as you deserve. Yet take a taste, and call for more as you like it.

They (the Papists) do require the worship of Images, so do devils.

They say they have power among them to work miracles, so has Satan, 2 These.
2. 9.

The Pope assumeth power to dispose of Kingdoms, so did the devil, Matthew. 4.
9.

They practice and allow of equicocation, so did the devil in his oracles.

Is not this good stuff? make your own choice, and expound your self, upon any
one of your 24. and conclude: and here I take upon me to show you, that your
own inference is foul, and either foolish or false. Leave and change you self
unto Truth, and a better temper, least it be said unto you, (as Revel. 22. 11.)
He which is filthy let him be filthy still.

CHAP. IIII. Of Blasphemy.
THe last is worst. You may be ashamed of the former, but I am afraid to 1.
read and repeat, what is to come. I received a treatise from you by Dan. Sted.
but was not willing to believe it yours until since you did own it to me more
then once. It is an appeal unto King James, under the name of Io. Hunt, Printed
Anne Dom. 1620.

How basely, and with how foul a mouth you speak there, of that excellent and
admirable Queen Elizabeth, is unfit for any man to foul his pen with: more
unfit for you, who were her subject born, so to vomit against your dead Prince:
and most unfit for any good Christian so much as to think. But it is a
happiness to her, and us, that rank malice has made and invented lies so
gross and palpable, that it has destroyed it own intended mischief. So
sometime a rabid anger, may make a curre bite out his own Teeth.

You have herein exceeded all that ever I have met withal, but the reason is
(as in Ovid)

Non tibi plus cordis, sed minus oris inest: which is well rendered in prose by
Erasmus. Non plus audes, aut sapis, sed minus pudet.

But I pass the baseness of that barbarism, because 2.
a far more odious cause cries out. Look in your sixth chapter, and excuse
your self from Blasphemy if you can.

Among Advocates and Disputants it is held odious and absurd, to leave the
cause, and inveigh and rail against the persons: But you leaving the cause and
our persons also, boldly fly in Os Coeli into the face of God. Mark your own
words, I will begin where you have set your mark in the margent (Note say you)
as if you thought it an excellent piece of your own performance. The words are
these, page 27.

Where they speak to their earthly Lords and Kings, either they stand or kneel
handsomely, 3.
with their hats in their hands: but when they speak to their God, commonly
they either speak sitting, with their caps on, as hail fellow well met with
their God, or else with their noses thrust into their hats, for fear, as it
seems, that the evil smells which come from their God should infect their
brains. Their Temples and Synagogues are not so neat as their bed-chambers,
galleryes or chambers of presence, or audience: and when they come into their
Temples to treat with their God, or hear his Word or Law, unless, it be for
respect of some man there, every one without respect to his God, sits him
down, and puts on his cap: In so much as the God of the Protestants, is the
most uncivil, evill-mannered God of all those, who have borne the name of Gods
upon earth: yea worse then Pan, the God of Clownes, that can endure no
ceremonies or good manners.

To this I add what (of the same strain) I find in your fourth Chapter; Page
19.

I appeal (say you) to your Majesty (meaning King James of precious memory)
well pleased to consider how great injustice it is, to have your ancient
Subjects spoiled of their lands, goods, liberty and life, and be condemned as
Felons and Traitors, For that they will not believe in such a perjured God.

Is not this Language worthy a Faggot, without a recantation? can you devise,
more high, more 4.
impious, more daring Blasphemy? Did you ever hear any the worst of Protestants
ever Blaspheme God for ever to be blessed? Did ever any of us deny, or
disclaim your god to be our God? Did you ever hear any of your own Papists so
Blasphemous as your self? Is the God of Protestants, your God? How dare you
then revile him? If he be not your God, you then do serve the devil. Lord bow
down thine 2 King. 19. 16.
ear and hear: open Lord thine eyes and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib
which has sent him to reproach the living God.

I will not deseant upon so foul, so bold impiety: I forbear and leave you to
the consistory of your own conscience. The repetition of this is so odious,
that (I dare say) you are condemned even at home in your own bosom already: at
least I would hope so well of you, that you have and do condemn your self:
which you must do for this even to hell, or else you can have no true hope for
Heaven, and you had need to do it as publicly, as this is which you have here
set forth. If your temper will be hot, yet (as it is Revel. 3. 19.) Be zealous,
and repent.

Conclusion.
IN the first of my four Chapters, I have observed,. 5.
how you have disclaimed the holy Scriptures for your judge, honoring us with
that indubious character of being the sheep of Christ's fould, because we hear
his voice, whilst you disvalew, deny, and disclaim the authority of his Word.

Here again, in this last Chapter I find our God (as before his Word)
disclaimed by you. (The God of the Protestants say you, etc. And then not
content diverse times to have denied him for your God, you Blaspheme him also in
horrid and most fearful Language: Language of that transcendency, and so
divelish, that it cannot be believed with the Analogy of Gods honor, and due
reverenee to his Name, that the devil, and the howling damned in hell, shall
be suffered to belch against the Majesty of Heaven, the names of uncivil,
evill-mannered, perjured God, worse then the god of Clownes, etc.

Thus have you denied God in this world, pray you, (and I pray God) that you
may by repentance and amendment, prevent the time when God shall else deny you
in the world to come: least that you there find, that unto Maledicentibus
there is an ite, Maledicti. Go you cursed, will be said to them that curse. For
Blasphemia est maledicentia, etc. Blasphemy is cursing, etc.

Repent, recall your self and others, least you prove Anonymus in the Book of
Life.

FINIS.
