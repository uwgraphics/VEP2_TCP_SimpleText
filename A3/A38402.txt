ENGLANDS JOY AND SORROW: expressing their sorrow for the Kings going into
Scotland, and their joy for the Queen Mothers farewell.
Upon the Kings going to Scotland.
PArdon, oh blessed King, pardon my muse
Which to thy Majesty may seem profuse,
Behold, O King, behold and thou may see
Thy Subjects drowned in sorrow now for thee,
They thy departure from them do lament
And with an inundation do repent,
Their eyes are so fixed on thee in their pain
As if they meant to pull thee back again,
They weep extremely for the loss of thee,
Least they should grow unto some Anarchie,
They Are never better, King, then in thy sight
And in thy absence now they fear some night,
Like as the Persians, though they did adore
The rising Sun, and worshipped before,
Yet when that Phoebus bright-sky wandering Steeds
Which nourishes the earth, and daily feeds,
It with Caelestiall light, do falling drop
And hides his light in Thetis watery lap,
Oh! then with grief and sadness they do cloth
Themselves, observing it a daily oath,
The occidentall Sun for to bemoane
Because from their Horizon it is not gone,
Even so, O King, even so, subjects do
Adore thy Majesteriall presence so,
But when we see the bright beams of thy light
Obscured in absence, we think it a night,
Of eye-bedaubing sorrow, and be-vaile
With grief alas! which never yet do fail,
But thou can add an Antidote to grief
And likewise ease our sorrow with relief:
Thou promis'st us thy present yet again
For otherwise thou would augment our pain,
Thou likewise would have Scotland for to have
A happiness in Thee, which they do crave,
And thus, oh thus, even with a mutual light
Unto both Kingdoms thou do shine most bright,
Whilst thou in Scotland art, they have in Thee
A blessing, which they think, eternity,
And whilst in blessed England thou do shine
We take thee for some Angel most divine,
No marveile then thy Subjects now do mourn
In sadness for thy absence all forlorn,
And while bereaven of thy splendent lamp
We all do think it light's eternal dampe,
Go King to Scotland with a happy fate
And cause their former anger to abate,
Oh mitigate their fury, wherein they
Will truly the blessed Sovereign obey,
Go with a happy Omen, let your sight
In truth and love both Kingdoms reunite,
Go, bannish factions from us both, that then
In pure sincerity we may be brethren,
Link both together, and we jointly pray
That true Religion never may decay,
Go prosperous, but suddenly return
Least in thy absence while we daily mourn,
We bury all our joys, for now our tears
We think each day to be a thousand years,
And then those thousand years may multiply
And so our sorrow grow t'ernity,
Shine then thou Sun of glory, and conjoyne
Englands benevolous aspect with thine.
Upon the Queens going away.
STay my sad Genius! and bewail no more
With eye-bedabled sorrow as before,
Me thinks I see each hilarous subject cry
Down grief with joy and with alacrity,
They do, magnificent Queen, they do rejoice
At thy departure with a heavenly voice,
They all do joy so willing thee to see
Now to depart with such hilarity,
And if thou had not added some relief
Unto us, we had all been drowned in grief,
Illustrious Queen! we are no longer sad
But now in thee behold we all are glad!
And do rejoice, that thou did late find
Even of thy self a voluntary mind,
And in a retribution (Lo!) now we
Do give our tributary thanks to thee,
Because that unto joyful England thou
Grantest a most luxurious gladness now,
Io. Bo.
Rouse up your sickness, and do not detain
The Subjects crying wishes once again,
We know it is feigned; Therefore since thou art well
Go, go that we may bid thee all farewell,
So prosperous, O Queen, with luckie oar
To the Siculian or Hesperian shore,
We wish that all things may succeed to thee
Propitious, as unto some Deity,
For thou do so relieve each Subjects heart
In helping them from sorrow's former smart,
That all, even all do most unitely pray
God to conduct thee from us in thy way,
Thou have, O Queen, even overswayd our joy
Which all our former grief cannot annoy,
In thy departure for thou do now bring
Back all our former sorrow for the King,
We triumph in the motion thou did make,
From England a great journey for to take,
And for this cause of joy which thou do give
To us, we bid thee all farewell and live,
Live and farewell Madam chose you whither
For time does both contabulate together,
You see how our affections all do bend
In this thy journey, which we do commend,
As we commend thy journey, so we pray
That now with thee thou would conduct away,
All Papists which this land do much infect
All Pontificians, a most cursed Sect,
Proud Prelates, which did greatly domineere
And tyrannizing honest men did jeere,
False Priests, which in our Church did daily preach
Base Atheism, and Doctors which did teach,
False doctrine: These, we pray, conduct with thee
And purge our land from all impiety,
And therefore (lo!) we all do wish thee well
And wishing so we bid thee all farewell.
Upon both.
THus joy and grief do go together
So unitely, none knows whither,
Does retain the upper place
For both alike are seen in face,
Thus joy and grief do jointly cry
A mutual Antipathie,
Sometimes some grieving I do see
O most illustrious King for thee,
Sometimes, me thinks, I see some joy
O Queen for thee, and think it a toy,
Any longer time to mourn
To grief subjected so forlorn,
Lo! joy and grief are equal so
And both together thus do go,
I know not which have upper hand
They Are so conjoined in one band,
When we, O blessed King, do think
On thy departure, we do sink,
Under the Tyranny of grief
Void of help or just relief,
When we, glorious Queen, do cast
An eye on thee, no grief do last,
But then immediately we do
Rejoice in thinking on thee so,
And thus my judgment cannot be
Equally poised, for to see,
Whither joy or sorrow may
Be greatest, and so get the day,
For they are so unitely joined
Together, that no man can find,
Whither the peoples common voice
In thee, O Queen do most rejoice,
Or whither they most blessed King
More sorrow unto thee do bring,
We do rejoice, O blessed Queen
In thy departure cause there is seen,
All Papists to depart with thee
To purge our land from Popery,
We cannot choose but thee commend
For that affection thou do lend,
To us, advancing high the Crown
And Papistrie in pulling down,
Thus do we all contemn the Pope
In thee magnanimous King we hope.
First these two Kingdoms to unite
And both to Brotherhood invite,
And then we doubt not but we shall
Reflourish both in truth, from all,
Hell-nourisht faction, while we pray
Religion never may decay,
Thus ye see that joy and grief
Both to our Kingdoms gives relief,
But saving that Antipathie
Me thinks I hear each subject cry,
Return, O King, return, O Queen, farewell
Farewell O Queen, return O King, full-well.
FINIS.
