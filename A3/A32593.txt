or any the Territories or Dominions thereunto belonging, to or for any parts or
places beyond the Seas (other then such as already have obtained License in
that behalf) upon pain of His Majesty's high Displeasure, and Confiscation of
all such Ships and Vessels, and of all the Ordnance, Tackle, Goods and
Merchandise in or belonging thereunto, to His Majesty's use, which shall be set
to Sea contrary to the tenor and intent of this His Majesty's Royal

His Pleasure to the contrary.
