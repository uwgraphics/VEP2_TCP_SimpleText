The CASE of Katherine Harris, a Protestant Sufferer;
WHose Husband was barbarously Murdered the 26th of March, 1687. by the Earl of
Clincarty and his Party, begging his Life on his Knees at Mallo in the County
of Cork; being the first that suffered for the Protestant Religion.

That the said Katherine, late Wife of the said William, was Imprisoned, and in
a most notorious manner had all she had Plundered, to the value of 3000 l. by
the Party of the said Earl of Clincarty.

That by Petition to the late King James in Ireland, she obtained an Order to
Clincarty, That he would settle Four Plough-Lands and a House, part of his
Estate, in Consideration of her Suffering; but being in great danger of her
Life, she and her Family were forced to fly for England.

That the said Katherine, after coming to England, Petitioned His Majesty King
William, and the late Queen of Blessed Memory, who Granted unto her during her
Life, Two of the said Plough-Lands, and a House which was then let at 61 l. per
Ann. and now owes 800 l. on the said Lands.

Wherefore she humbly prays, she may have a Saving in the Resumption Bill, she
having lost her Husband, Three Brothers, and also the said 3000 l. in the late
Wars in Ireland, and being left with Seven Children.
