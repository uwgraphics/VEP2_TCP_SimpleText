Terminer, or Goal-deliverie, or execute any Temporal authority by virtue of
any Commission, But shall be wholly disabled, and be incapable to have,
receive, use or execute any of the said Offices, Places, Powers, Authorities
and things aforesaid.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Acts from and

ANNO XVII. Caroli Regis.
An Act for regulating of the Privy Council, and for taking away the Court
commonly called the Star Chamber,
WHereas by the great Charter many times confirmed in Parliament, It is
enacted, That no Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseised of his
Freehold or Liberties or free Customs, or be Outlawed or exiled or otherwise
destroyed, and that the King will not pass upon him, or condemn him but by
lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land: And by another Statute
made in the fifth year of the Reign of King Edward the third, It is Enacted,
That no Man shall be attached by any accusation, nor fore-judged of life or
lim, nor his Lands, Tenements, Goods nor Chattels seized into the Kings hands
against the form of the great Charter, and the Law of the Land: And by another
Statute made in the five and twentieth year of the Reign of the same King
Edward the third, It is accorded, assented and established, that none shall be
taken by petition, or suggestion made to the King or to His Council, unless
it be by Indictment or Presentment of good and lawful people of the same
neighborhood where such de^^^ be done, in due manner, or by Process made by
Writ Original at the common Law, and that none be put out of his Franchise or
Freehold, unless he be duly brought in to answer, and fore-judged of the same
by the course of the Law, and if any thing be done against the same, it shall
be redressed and holden for none. And by another Statute made in the eight and
twentieth year of the Reign of the same King Edward the third, It is amongst
other things Enacted, that no man of what estate or condition soever he be,
shall be put out of his Lands or Tenements, nor taken nor imprisoned, nor
disinherited, without being brought in to answer by due Process of Law: And by
another Statute made in the two and fourtieth year of the Reign of the said
King Edward the third, It is Enacted, that no man be put to answer without
presentment before Justices, or matter of Record, or by due Process and Writ
original, according to the old Law of the Land, and if any (...) be done to the
contrary, it shall be void in Law and holden for (...) by another Statute, made
in the six and thirtieth year of the sa^^ (...) Edward the third, It is amongst
other things Enacted, That all (...) which shall be pleaded in any Courts
before any the Kings Justices, or in His other places, or before any of His
other Ministers, or in the Courts and places of any other Lords within the
Realm, shall be entered and enrolled in Latin. And whereas by the Statute made
in the third year of King Henry the seventh, power is given to the Chancellor,
the Lord Treasurer of England for the time being, and the Keeper of the Kings
Privy Seal or two of them, calling unto them a Bishop and Temporal Lord of the
Kings most honorable Council, and the two chief Justices of the Kings Bench
and common Pleas for the time being, or other two Justices in their absence to
proceed, as in that Act is expressed, for the punishment of some particular
offenses therein mentioned, And by the Statute made in the one and twentieth
year of King Henry the eighth, The President of the Council is associated to
join with the Lord Chancellor and other Judges in the said Statute, of the
third of Henry the seventh mentioned, But the said Judges have not kept
themselves to the points limited by the said Statute, but have undertaken to
punish where no Law does warrant, and to make Decrees for things having no such
authority, and to inflict heavier punishments than by any Law is warranted.

And forasmuch as all matters examinable, or determinable before the said
Judges, or in the Court commonly called the Star Chamber, may have their proper
remedy and redress, and their due punishment, and correction by the common Law
of the Land, and in the ordinary course of Justice elsewhere; And forasmuch as
the reasons and motives inducing the erection and continuance of that Court do
now cease, and the proceedings, Censures and Decrees of that Court, have by
experience been found to be an intolerable burden to the Subject, and the
means to introduce an arbitrarie power and Government; And forasmuch as the
Councel-Table, has of late times assumed unto it self, a power to intermeddle
in Civil causes and matters, only of private interest between party and party,
and have adventured to determine of the Estates and Liberties of the Subject,
contrary to the Law of the Land, and the rights and privileges of the
Subject, by which great and manifold mischiefs and inconveniences have arisen
and happened, and much incertaintie by means of such proceedings has been
conceived cencerning men's rights, and estates; For settling whereof, and
preventing the like in time to come;

Be it Grdained and Enacted by authority of this present Parliament, That the
said Court commonly called the Star Chamber, and all Jurisdiction power and
authority belonging unto, or exercised in the same Court, or by any the
Judges, Officers or Ministers thereof, be from the first day of August, in the
year of our Lord God, one thousand six hundred forty and one, clearly and
absolutely dissolved, taken away and determined, and that from the said first
day of August, neither the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper of the great Seal of
England, the Lord Treasurer of England, the Keeper of the Kings Privy Seal, or
President of the Council, nor any Bishop, Temporal Lord, Privy-Councellor, or
Judge, or Justice whatsoever, shall have any power or authority to hear,
examine, or determine any matter or thing whatsoever, in the said Court
commonly called the Star Chamber, or to make, pronounce, or deliver any
Judgment, Sentence, Order or Decree, or to do any Judicial or Ministerial Act
in the said Court: And that all and every Act and Acts of Parliament, and all
and every Article, Clause and Sentence in them and every of them, by which any
Jurisdiction, power, or authority is given, limited or appointed unto the said
Court, commonly called the Star Chamber, or unto all, or any the Judges,
Officers, or Ministers thereof, or for any proceedings to be had or made in the
said Court, or for any matter or thing to be drawn into question, examined, or
determined there, shall for so much as concerns the said Court of
