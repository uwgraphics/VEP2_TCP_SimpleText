To the Reader.
IT was my chance being beyond sea, to have the perusing of some of this story,
which according to my sense and understanding then, appeared not only
delightful in the reading, but seemed to my capacity to contain in many
places mysteries, belonging to the transactions of foreign parts either at
present, or not very long before put in execution: this gave my appetite,
Innest confess, some effectual desire to have them put in such a posture, as
they might prove commodious to friends, as beneficial to my self; being also
unwilling, the labor and pains should be altogether lost of this nature,
since for many years past; not any one Romance, has been written in the
English tongue; when as daily from other Nations, so many of all sorts fly into
the World to be seen: however for a long time these reasons could not prevail
with the Author; yet, whether out of any diffidence in apprehension, or for
other secret causes, I cannot tell: but at last by much importunity, joined
together with other particular relations of my own, I obtained a grant of my
request, provided I used not the Authors name, in the printing or publishing of
the same. I having made already this progress in my designs, I think it
requisite to give the Reader this further intimation, That the whole (as I am
informed) will contain three parts; nevertheless in regard the expense, would
have been something too large, for my convenience and estate, to be done at one
time, I forbear as yet that charge and hazard; desiring first to see, how
this would take with the constitution of the age; especially when reading is of
so little use, that Stationers, generally complain, that they can scarce put
off with any considerable commodity, such books, which they have lying by them
to that purpose: I may also add this, that however the Title having reference
to a farther issue, (this being only the first part) does not perhaps in that,
sufficiently content the thoughts of the Reader, he may please to be
advertised, before he resolve to cast away a few hours upon a subject of this
kind, that notwithstanding the Catastrophe, or last, period, be not in this
little volume expressed, yet he may if he will, find a sufficient conclusion (by
consequences) in that which is alreadly published, for the perfect decorum of
any Romance, though the continuation intended, should not invite his curiosity
further to proceed, as occasion shall be given, or his own leisure may be free
from other more necessary employments. This is all I have to say for it, or my
self.

THE FIRST PART OF Cloria and Narcissus.
Beautiful Aurora had newly dressed the pearled morning with a ruby coronet to
entertain her lover, who began already to mount his golden Chariot for the
days Triumph, when unfortunate Cassianus in the great Forest, between the
Mountain Timolius and the City of Sardis, rose from his grassie bed, under the
large Canopy of a well spread Oak, where the night past he underwent an
inconvenient lodging for want of better shelter; and being seated upon the root
of that tree, that however had favorably contributed its best assistance
toward his accommodation, with intention (according to his custom) to pay an
early offering to his sorrow, whilst his Page sadled his horse that procured
more bountiful entertainment then his master, since the time of the year had
provided plentiful provision for his appetite; of a sudden his ear was
saluted by a well tuned cry of deep mouthed hounds, that seemed to charm the
air with a delightful harmony, which consequently gave the Prince some
interruption to his resolutions: but long he had not contemplated the
pleasingnesse of the Music, with a certain strife inwardly notwithstanding,
whether his complaints, or attentiveness should receive more friendly welcome
in his discontented bosom, before he might see a young Gentleman, in a hasty
hand-gallop to approach the place where he rested, which obliged him, as he
thought, to quit the seat, whereby he might receive information concerning his
travels toward Euarchus Court, his absolute ignorance in the Country having
made him lose his way that should have conducted him to some Town that might
have instructed his knowledge in the journey. But the youth beholding a
stranger of a seeming quality in that posture, not only stopped the speedy
course of his appearing well breathed horse; but when he came at a nearer
distance, in a gentle trot advanced toward him, with intention to offer all
courteous civilities, since he perceived the open heavens had only given him
welcome, and to that purpose saluted him with this language.

Sir, said he, it has been still the custom of Lydia to comply with the
necessity of strangers, of what quality soever; wherefore I should commit a
sin against the rules of hospitality in passing by your person with a
regardlesse neglect to what you might stand in need of, finding you here at
this time of the day; and the rather for that in outward appearance your
condition may merit the highest respect; to which purpose, I have resolved to
leave my sport, whereby the more conveniently to conduct you to the Kings
presence, if your pleasure shall condescend to the intention, being now present
in this exercise of hunting, who would no doubt, correct my ill-natured
rudeness, if I should commit so great a fault, as not to let his Majesty know,
that the woods had entertained such a guest without his welcome and privity.
And although I am but a Gentleman that waits upon the King in his Chamber, I
may have yet the honor to attend you to him, where I dare presume, your
reception will in some sort be answerable to your worth, though my quality
merit not your esteem. Cassianus glad that he had happened upon a conductor that
could so easily present him to the King; and that his Majesty's recreation gave
him so speedy and convenient an occasion, after he had given him thanks for the
offer, told him that as his ignorance in the passage had made him stand in need
of the least assistance to wind him out of the intricate labyrinth of these
woods, that had employed his thoughts for the night past, since he could
neither be safe from wild beasts or robbers, according to his doubtful
apprehension; but was more fortunate to have such a worthy guide to accompany
him to the uttermost end of his journey, for that probably his arrival at the
Court would be the period of his business; And therefore he should, as he
said, extremely oblige a wandering Pilgrim in the office. But because the King
was so passionately employed (as he was informed) for the present with his
fortunate sport, Cassianus supposed it scarce manners to give it interruption
by his addresses; so that he walked up and down a green walk, demanding such
questions as were necessary for his information, until the youth also modestly
desired some satisfaction concerning his adventures; which was the easier
granted, since the relation not only suited well enough with the Princes
intention of courtesy and affability, but with the convenience of the time;
when they were both seated upon the same root that had been Cassianus uneasy
pillow, he gave him this instruction of his fortunes, with few or no
circumstances but what many deep sighs contrived: My Father, said he, Prince
of Iberia, was in his youthful years inflamed with the report of the
excellent beauty of Elizana your Kings sister, whose fame could not be
circumscribed within the limits of Lydia, which made him, after a long
solicitation by Letters, take a journey in person to the Court, to tender the
affection and respects due to a Lady of so eminent birth and virtues;
notwithstanding he seemed not to bring with him dignity, titles, and riches
sufficient to deserve so glorious a match; This, I must tell you rendered the
Queen her mother then living an absolute enemy to his courtships, supposing her
daughter to be undervalued by the choice: nevertheless, the State of Lydis
finding not only a certain concurrencie in their loves, but an agreement of
their Religions, for that both Countries had left the obedience of De^pho^^
persuaded the King her Father to the alliance, supposing all other defects
would be buried by those unities, so that in a short time the Marriage was
solemnized with most magnificent Ceremonies, though in the interim the
triumphs were something obscured by the sudden death of the Prince her elder
Brother, whose disposition in his life gave such opinions of his future
greatness, that the world began already to tremble with the very apprehension
of his fate; yet the accident advanced my Mother a step nearer to the Crown,
since there was none left of the Race to inherit but my Uncle Euarebus and her
self; and this by consequence made my Father in the apprehension of Asia, a
far greater Prince then his own Fortunes could pretend unto; insomuch as
returning into his native Country with his illustrous Bride, what honor could
be imagined was cast upon him by the admiring people, which honors raised
excessively his aspiring thoughts, notwithstanding many of his own rank began
to envy his prosperity, especially one Tygranes Duke of Colchis, who ever
esteemed himself in possession, the more powerful Prince: In fine, the Kingdom
of Mesopotamia revolting at the same time from the jurisdiction of Artaxis King
of Armenia, my Father was earnestly solicited to take upon him the Crown, since
he was only able by his power and alliance, as the people pretended, to defend
their proceedings against their tyrannical Lord, who had usurped too great a
Prerogative, both over their Laws and Consciences. The offer in a manner was
no sooner proposed to the ambition of his youth, being tickled with the desire
of bearing the name of a King, though many had refused the same tender, but he
accepted of the Government, promising his protection, as the Subjects did their
fidelity, and in this hopeful agreement he was with all Ceremony and State,
dignified with the Diadem in the regal City of the Kingdom: But the
possession, however it brought with it honor and dignity, it lessened not his
care or trouble, since the glory was to be maintained now it was purchased.
This enterprise gave as earnest warning to Artaxis to be dilligent in providing
Forces to suppress the example, and punish the esteemed Rebellion, that else
might prove a leading Card as he thought, to the quiet state of the rest of his
Dominions, that began already to waver in their obedience, as it did desire in
my Father to maintain what he had got, though it were with never so great a
violence and hazard: In the first place Artaxis dispatches Ambassadors, not
only to all his friends in other Countries, laying before them the dangerous
consequences of such a Revolt; but also sent Messengers to his own Subjects,
possessing them with the fear of the Rebels insolency, however his
endeavors so little prospered for the present to his advantage, the first sort
being too far off to give him speedy assistance, as the other too disobedient
to lend him much aid, that his General was constrained to take the Field with
a very small number; only the Army within some few weeks became increased by
an addition of Tygranes Forces, whose envy to my Father, notwithstanding the
near kindred between them, had rendered him a most mortal enemy. But Artaxis
General finding it was full time to dispute the right by the Sword, though
upon any disadvantage, since all protraction did but increase the peoples
suspicion of the Kings disability, that was not able to chastise one Subject
who seemed to rebel against his Majesty and Power, with as much courage as
could proceed from desperate hopes, marched against the City where my Father
continued his Court, guarded with Soldiers sufficient to have besieged Artaxis
whole Army, if their hearts and affections had been answerable to their number
and accommodation; And in this posture the General not only sets upon the
wall (the Garrison not expecting the boldness of the attempt) but in a short
time became master both of the Gates and Streets, to the confused amazement of
all the Inhabitants, who seemed neither to have will nor power to resist; so
that the strange news scarce giving conveniencie and time to my Father with his
whole Family, to fly from the danger; he had not opportunity to draw his Sword
in the defense of himself and Crown, but through private and obscure Woods,
was constrained to convey his Wife and Children, until he arrived under the
protection of a Commonweal, that at the beginning of the design had lent a
willing and considerable aid to the action. Artaxis hearing of this
extraordinary success, not only beyond his expectation, but in a manner above
all belief, caused public Sacrifices to be made to the Gods through the chief
Temples, that he might not seem in the peoples apprehensions to be ungrateful
for such large benefits, and to increase the more his Subjects opinions, that
the very heavens intended to fight for his Right, since he made Religion the
chief cause of the War, he gave it out the Victory was no less then
miraculous, since his General, as 'twas said, had bin instructed in the
assault by a divine Revelation, which had made him venture upon so desperate an
enterprise; but however, the King was thought by many over superstitious, yet
the General and Tygranes omitted no industry to render our House miserable;
the first continuing in those parts after the battle, with half the Army to
suppress the last sparkles of common Rebellion, as the other led the rest into
Iberia my Fathers Country, to make himself Master of that Territory, bestowed
upon him by Artaxis, in recompense of his service done against our Family; in
which employment they both thought and strived to exceed each other in cruelty,
not only in undoing our present prosperity, but also in rooting out our future
remembrance; the one possessing himself of all the subssistence that should
have nourished my Father, his Wife, and Children, as the other bereaved him of
his Honor that would have made him and his Posterity capable of better
fortunes; and in this manner were we all turned a begging, as I may say, into
the wide World, to converse with nothing but want, disgrace, and trouble;
whilst our enemies enjoyed our Towns, Castles, Titles, and Country; which
continued my poor Father so discontent for some years, having nothing to live
upon but what he received from the bounty of his Father in Law, until at last
not being able longer to endure the sharp frowns of his spightfull fates,
accompanied with the cruel usage of his malicious enemies, he willingly paid
Nature her due, and changed his inconstant habitation here, for a perpetual
one hereafter, leaving his Wife and all his Children, not only to bewail his
death, though they esteemed him much more happy then themselves, but to provide
anew against the storms of other miseries, since we wanted a director to
steer our courses; however, my Mother being endued with admirable virtues and
courage, endeavored by the small, though loving subssistence she received from
her Friends, not only to bring up her many Children, with all the exquisite
breeding she could devise, but by the affability of her natural behavior and
conversation, strived to gain the love and compassion of all Asia^; insomuch,
as for the first she set us in the world at convenient years not to be a shame
to our well-descended Family; and for the latter, she so compassed her design,
that no heart in a manner but wished her prosperity. In this posture we remained
until she sent me to be a Suitor to a rich Heir, with hopes again to raise
our House to some eminency, by obtaining the possession of another principality
that rightly belonged to the young Lady; but Tygranes, as if he had absolutely
sworn himself an enemy to all that could do good to our family, not only
became also a pretender to the same Match, but prevailed so far with Artaxis
before the Marriage could be obtained, that he sent a powerful Army to besiege
the Lady in her Castle, and so by force possessed themselves both of her person
and patrimony, leaving me again to my desperate fortunes, not having any force
to desend her Rights, or maintain my own pretensions; that ever since has
continued me a wanderer through most of the Princes Courts of Asia to seek
relief; which at last has brought me into the quiet haven of Evarchus
Country, with the same intention to demand his willing assistance; my hopes
being more increased by reason of the general fame of the peaceable state of
his rich and powerful Dominions. But scarce was he come to the end of this
discourse, when the King himself allighting to take a fresh Horse, near the
place where they were, whereby the better to pursue his begun sport, Cassianus
had opportunity to present himself to his view and consideration; the company
in the mean time, with a certain amazed haste, making way for his approach,
since the adventure of a Stranger in such a posture, seemed to invite all their
expectations; wherefore when he came at so convenient a distance, that his
words might easily be heard, supporting his body by a small Ebony-Lance he
carried in his hand, with a confident modesty delivered these words.

Mighty King, said he, although your Imperial Diadems seems to flourish with
Olive Branches, whilst the ambition of other Princes make but the Prerogative
of their Crowns nourish the lusts of their own tyranny, and by that means,
instead of being protectors of their people, deliver them up to slaughter and
oppression; yet certainly the Gods have not only placed you upon a Throne to
be happy your self by a lasting peace, but to render others satisfied by your
power and justice, especially when the heavens are dishonored by their
injuries, and with that wept, which for the present stopped the progress of his
discourse; But being encouraged to further expressions by the Kings pity,
however his language seemed strange to his ears, as his person did to his
eyes; when he had dried his fair face with a handkercher, he uttered this
language. Great Sir, said he, as I shall not need to trouble you with many
parciculars concerning the unhappy passages of my Fathers fortunes, since the
story I suppose has been sufficiently presented to your ears by common fame,
if not by more exact relations, so must I at this time, not only give you an
account of my own actions, being encouraged thereunto by your Majesty's
appearing favors, but also do presume upon redresses according to your power
and goodness: to this purpose be pleased to know, that my name is Cassianus
your most unfortunate Nephew, being driven from my rights and possessions in
the fruitful Country of Iberia, by the tyrannical oppressions of Artaxis King
of Armenia, which has caused me since my years gave me ability, both to
understand and prosecute my own affairs, to travel through most part of Asia,
to seek assistance amongst other Princes of my own rank; but finding them
for the most part so much encumbered, by reason of their troublesome occasions,
or I may say not willing to expose themselves to any danger or hazard
concerning another benefit, though my injuries lie before them as warning
examples for their own conditions; I could obtain from their courtesies no
hopes of any assistance, though many complements were used of good will and
affection, unless I could procure other greater Monarchs to join with them in
the quarrel. These answers quickly carried my endeavors to the Court of
Syria, where at present reigns Orsames that mighty King, who after I had also
presented unto him my desires, he seemed to wonder why I should make my
addresses to himself or any other Prince in Asia, when you notwithstanding your
power, peace, and tranquillity, appeared to be so far from giving me any aid
in my necessities, that you were not at all sensible of my sufferings; how ever
he told me, that if I could yet procure the breach of that amity beweene you
and Artaxis, whereby some considerable supplies might come from Lydia,
abounding as he said rather in luxuries then in activity, he would presently
declare War against the Armenian King, by which means I might come again
into the possession of my lost Rights. These intimations I bring from one
powerful Monarch to another, and such supplications my own necessities
require me to make, the rather for that not only your royal blood, has
honored my birth from my most Illustrious Mother, but the same worship of the
Gods are exercised both in Lydia and Iberia, which being said, he again rested
silent with tears in his eyes.

Euarchus, after he had fully understood with a pensive attentiveness his
Nephews request, and entertained him with those complements, and that welcome
his condition and alliance merited, he only for the present told him, that as
a matter of this consequence required a judicious consideration, so he might be
confident of his love and affection, and withal invited him for diversion, to
be a partaker of the Lydian pastime, agreeing as he said, with his youth and
courage, which gave their thoughts for some hours sufficient employment.
However, the King being in his own nature extremely solicitous, though
personally he followed the sport, according to his custom, with the foremost,
yet having received, contrary to his expectation, a subject of such
consideration, all the day did labor in his mind a resolution; one while
reflecting upon the quiet and prosperity of his own Kingdoms; and then again
weighed the pretended injuries of his near kinsman, professing the same
worship of the Gods, hesides the glorious offer of Orsames, which as he
thought, did in a manner compel him to he active^ but the night coming on so
fast, the King was not only forced to put off his unprofitable meditation
until a more convenient season, but to command the retreat from that
delightful exercise to be sounded: Wherefore taking the youth by the hand,
with whose person and behavior he seemed to be already in love, he placed him
by him in his Coach, and so entertained the time with discourses of his
fortunes, until they arrived at the Palace, which for it is singular beauty
deserves a particular description.

The house was seated upon the banks of the river Pactoleus, by whose
refreshing streams, the delightful gardens placed of all sides, seemed to
flourish with an exact greenness: the portall was formed of white marble, with
columns architraue freeze and cornish; on the top it was crowned with a
Cornucopia in compassing an asure globe, supported by little Cupids with gilded
wings; under which they passed through a square Court, set round about with
excellent Statues of brass in Niches: the structure it self was of Oriental
Granet stone, so interlaced with Ionick and Corinthian pillars of diverse
colors, that as it gave the eye a most delectable object, so it rendered the
Edifice much more sumptuous; At the upper end was a large Tarase elevated six
steps; upon the stairs stood Hiacinthia the Queen, to give her husband meeting
accompanied by the new stranger.

As soon as Cassianus beheld that beauty mixed with a kind of sweet majesty,
that both awed and pleased at the same time, he addressed himself to her
presence, like one that intended only to be Euarchus suppliant; however the
Queen that was ignorant in nothing but pride, with a gentle smile, which
notwithstanding for the more grace, put a virmillion blush in her fair cheeks,
gave him a gracious welcome into Lydia: but turning his eye on one side, he was
suddenly struck with such an amazement, to behold the Princes Cloria the Kings
daughter, that he had strife enough with his own passions to perform the rest
of those reverences due to her mothers dignity, since his thoughts imagined to
look upon an earthly deity. She was clothed in light Taffety for the commodity
of the season, through which her dainty limbs seemed to appear in admirable
proportion, leaving nothing to be hid that hindered the true knowledge of her
excellent shape, but yet covered those beauties which are increased only by
opinion and desire. She was crowned with a chaplet of white and red Roses, not
yet fully blown; her hair was combed to the full length and breaded with
ribons of the same color, as if art were ambitious of natures liberty; her
sleeves were open, and lyned with needlework of the story of Diana and Acteon,
wherein the Nymphs with a confused bashfulnesse; seemed to hide themselves
amongst the rushes; and all the rest of her scarce any apparel was so
becoming, that either she made it so by her perfections, or her perfections
could not be fitted by better inventions.

But the Queen quickly removed Cassianus from that object that began already so
strongly to charm all his senses, for taking him by the hand, she walked with
him many turns about the Tarase, whilst in the mean time he discoursed to her
his adventures; however now and then he could not choose but disturb his
story, by casting his looks where the Princes stood, though at last she
suddenly shot from his sight like a bright starve in the firmament, which made
him seek her with his eyes to as little purpose: After some time that the Queen
seemed sufficiently to have recreated herself in the air, she was informed by
an officer of the Court, that the King expected her company in the Parlor.

The room was only divided from the gardens by a partition of bright glass,
interwoven with certain silver Terms that afforded a most delectable prospect
upon the Oreng-trees, and beautiful fountains: not long after their entrance
(in which space the King instructed Cassianus in the Masters of his principal
pictures) supper was served upon a marble Table without covering, for the more
coolness, near which was a lake of clear water, where Neptune sat in
Majesty with Tritons, that by the artificial turning of a cock, sounded their
trumpets composed of shells at the entrance of every course.

Cassianus was placed by fortune right over against Cloria, which not only
gave him sufficient opportunity to contemplate her beauty, but the
contemplation it self afforded him such abundant matter to work upon, that he
fed more his soul by that delight, then his appetite with the delicious dishes
of the Kings table, and certainly had been absolutely lost in that ravishing
lethargy, if Euarchus had not often wakened him by diverse questions concerning
his journey, and the rest of his adventures in Armenia, to make a civil though
scarce a satisfactory answer but however, as if he esteemed his eyes bound to
the duty, he cast his look again that way, which occasioned still more
distractednesse in his reply; so that the King believing his Nephews travells
required a necessary rest, not only presently rose from the Table, but
commanded the chief Nobility of the Court, to conduct the Prince to his
lodging, where he had privacie enough to fulfill the desires of his curious
fancies, which entertained him all the night with little or no sleep, until
the Kings music the next morning saluted him with this Ditty.

Fair Prince, your youthful presence here,
is like the Summer of the year,
Welcomed by hearts of every sort,
to Great Euarchus royal Court.
May blessed visions sent by Jove,
wait on your slumbers from above,
Until bright Phoebus with his beams,
in season wake you from your dreams;
And then may objects of delight,
in every place content your sight:
Let fortune so observe your way,
that you command whilst others pray;
And aged-Time prolong your life,
beyond the Sisters fatal knife,
Until you willingly resign,
your Soul to be installed divine.
Then let old Sardis for it is glory
raise up a Homer to your story;
So as you are a Summer here,
a Harvest may attend you there.
But however, after some weeks, Cassianus seemed to kindle in his youthful
bosom new flames, with those small sparkles he had received from Cloria's
beauty, which often separated him from the rest of the company, that made some
believe he was too much discontented with the Kings protraction. Yet Euarchus
mindful both of his affection to his Nephew, and the prosperity of his own
Countries, finding rumors began too frequently to fly about the Court, by
reason of the violent desires of many to be employed in the Wars; one day
called unto him an ancient Officer of his Kingdom, on whose wisdom and
fidelity he most relied in all his weighty Affairs; and leading him into the
Garden, where he might both enjoy privacie and recreation, after some necessary
circumstances which seemed to usher in his discourse, he used these words:
Polinex said he, (for so he was called) as I have ever most trusted your
knowledge and experience, so have I never been less confident of your loyalty
and affection, since neither as yet has deceived my expectation when I had
most occasion to use your service, which deservedly renders you a worthy
Councellor, as I desire to be a good Prince, that cannot I hope but produce
consequences toward the happy Government of my Kingdoms; however at the
present, your faithful advice is more requisite then ever, since expedition and
danger cannot be separated from those undertakings I am violently pressed unto.
You know that lately there is come to my Court, my Nephew Cassianus, a Prince
whose person and merits deserve at least a kinsmans consideration, much more
his injuries a Kings Justice; the one bids me cherish him with my affection,
the other invites me to assist him with my power: however the strict tie of
sworn amity between Princes, persuades me to be circumspect in the breach,
notwithstanding the headlong precipitation of many of my chief Counselors
who solicit me to a War. Wherefore that I may avoid the hazard of a general
disquiet, since I find my people begin to be sick of their own tranquillity,
or make War upon such grounds that may conserve inviolably my faith with the
King of Armenia, which the Gods cannot else prosper; I require your opinion.

Polinex, after he had with an humble gravity, heard out the Kings discourse,
and taken some time to consider the waightinesse of the Council, in a distinct
manner returned this answer, wherein he used no more eloquence then was
necessary for the importancy of so great a business, though Nature and Art had
furnished him with parts excellent in that kind.

Sir, said he, as benefits had from Princes are past requital in a Subject,
even like graces received from the Gods, by which we are enabled to do
something; so I the unusefullest of your Servants, though most honored by your
goodness, may by the reflection of your luster merit the office of a
Councellor, because you have bin pleased to make me one; but if I should in the
least thought prove a Traitor to your glory (as a heinous offense that ought to
bury the remembrance of any good past) I did not only deserve to be disvested
of all your former benefits, but to be condemned to the worst of punishments,
since your transcendent favors have rendered my defects considerable: however,
if my weakness chance to err, and not my will, that mercy which makes you
resemble the Gods I must challenge; and thus according to your royal command,
I freely deliver my opinion. A War wisely undertaken, ought chiefly to be
accompanied with two considerations; the right of the Quarrel, and the power
of the Quarreller; the first makes a man a just Enemy, the second a prevailing
Conqueror; without either of which, certainly a Prince cannot be fortunate,
since he must be an oppressor or a loser, and why your Majesty should not give
your self the liberty of such a resolution, notwithstanding the pressing
necessity of your kinsman, I know no reason, since your Kingdoms are more to be
valued then his Country, and your honor then his benefit, though I will not
at all dispute the worth of his person. Besides, you are to consider with what
Prince you are to have the difference, not only a neighbor that never yet
injured your right in any thing, but of the contrary one with whom you have
sworn a perfect friendship, which is an alliance the heavens have made to be
preferred far before humane kindred, since the one is sealed but with flesh and
blood, as the other has imprinted it is character in the skies. Again, for you
to proclaim a War of blood, before you have demanded peace by a friendly
disputation, were to style you cruel, since no violence proceeding from the
greatest ambition ever practiced such an injustice, to put in execution a force
to obtain that which perhaps the Enemy you intend to make, will easily grant;
and as it will be esteemed more charity and goodness, to persuade then
compel, although the cause be absolutely just; so if the contrary, you are a
double injurer, one way in beginning an unlawful contention without
provocation; the other, in breaking those ties that ought to oblige all Princes
to an inviolable observation. Also, you may be pleased to consider your hazard,
since your own safety is first to be valued, whether in honor or prosperity;
for although your Kingdoms do in some sort equal Armenia in multitude of men
and warlike provision, yet in respect of the long neglect of Martial
Discipline they are rendered as it is to be feared, wholly incapable of a
present expedition; and your treasure, notwithstanding it be sufficient to
maintain the expense of your peaceable Government; yet, it will be found no
way able to undergo the charge of a powerful Army; so that whether your
people, so unaccustomed to oppression, and impatient of subjection, from whose
purses must come the supply, (inconstant by nature to their own desires,
witness their promises lately upon the same occasion) will be brought blindfold
to contribute, without being privy to every secret intention, in my judgment
is scarce a question; and how dangerously destructive that would prove to any
enterprise, when the multitude must be made acquainted with each stratagem of
State, I leave your Majesty to judge. Therefore my opinion is, that until you
can provide a store out of your own revenew, without depending altogether upon
the uncertainty of your Subjects bounty, no warlike undertaking can prove
glorious or beneficial, but of the contrary dangerous and unprofitable: So
that all you can do for the present, is to send an Ambassador with reasons to
persuade, and not a Herald with threatenings to denounce, which in all
probability will not only give satisfaction to your distresed Kinseman, but
win time till you be better provided.

This advice extremely pleased the King, who aimed rather at present content
then future glory, although his courage might pretend to the greatest honor,
not only for that it took away the occasion of exhausting his treasure, but
was also as he thought, a principal means still to maintain his state in
tranquillity, and his government without perturbation. Wherefore parting from
Polinex with such a smile as sufficiently persuaded him he was well satisfied
with his Council, sent presently for Prince Cassianus, to whom he communicated
his determination, which was forthwith to employ an Amdassadour, to demand
reason of the King of Armenia. But however this determination did not much
discontent Cassianus, because it gave him opportunity to remain in Lydia,
whereby he might the better prosecute his secret affections to the fair
Princess Cloria, yet those that violently desired employment in the Wars,
though it were bought with never so much prejudice to the Kings Affairs,
extremely mutined against Polinex his Council, amongst which number there was
a Nobleman called Dimogoras, one whose birth exceeded his wit, as his ambition
did his courage; and his fortune not answering either, made him much more
violent then the rest, since he supposed if he lost this opportunity for
action, Euarchus resolutions for peace would become more established; besides,
he hated the Kings person, because he had formerly received many Court
affronts, procured by his own factious spirit; wherefore he took occasion by
this means, not only to inform the State of Syria, that Euarchus could not
be drawn to make War against any of the kindred of Soroasters King of Egypt
upon what pretense soever, but secretly possessed all manner of people either
with the Kings want of courage or good nature, since coldly he was content as
he said, to let sleep the oppressions of his injured Nephew without revenge:
but principally he blamed the pernicious Counsels, as he termed them, of
Polinex, who strived to rock Euarchus mind into a lethargy of repose, that he
alone might rule the State with more convenience toward the particular
enriching of his own Family; and the rather were these factious speeches
dangerous, because the King was resolved, out of the rules of hospitality, not
to question any thing that was said in Cassianus behalf; which within a short
space began insensibly to penetrate the hearts of the vulgar. Dimogoras having
a principal interest in their affections, not only because they knew he was
not esteemed at Court, but for that commonly men of least eminent worth have
the fortune to gain the opinion of the multitude, since they hate virtue,
because they are resolved not to follow it. However, Euarchus to remedy (the
sweetest way he could) these growing inconveniences which yet appeared not in
full prospect to divert his Nephews thoughts from entertaining discontented
Counsels, proclaimed a general hunting of the wild Boar, at which time
Cassianus being summoned by the early morning to the delightful sport, he
found the King ready prepared for the Forest, upon the Plain before the
Palace gate, where Hyachinthea the Queen, not so much pleased with the Chase as
to accompany her Husband, soon repaired with the choicest Ladies, whose dress
resembled the chaste Goddess Diana in the like exercise, only upon her head
she wore a Hat, the more commodiously to cover the fair tresses of her hair,
that were embraced with rows of rich pearl, since no meaner ties were fit to
adorn so bountiful a treasure; and in this posture they issued out, animated
by the importunate solicitation of the Huntsmen, who seemed over ambitious to
be in their elements; at leastwise so interpreted by lovesick Cassianus, who
thought all the preperation nothing, since Cloria the only Star of his desires
was not to be of the Society, her Mother judging her by much too young for the
pastime. No sooner was the unhandsome Beast dislodged from his darksome
Habitation, when every person well horst, endeavored to show his own skill,
and his Coursers vigor, whilst the solitary Woods resounded with the cheerful
noise of diverse horns that seemed to encourage the Hunters; only the women
complained that Nature had not ordained them proper for the sport, since their
attire would not permit them to pass through the thickest copses.

But Cassianus, who was willing otherwise to be employed, thinking that
confusion spoke not to his imagination the soft language of a Lover, retired
presently from the crowde, though he suffered his Horse in a manner to be his
own director, until the permittance within a short space, brought them both
into an ample Plain; notwithstanding so environed with low wood, that the eye
could scarce discern any other passage then what Cassianus had found, where
also a gentle, though plentiful seeming Spring, had made a pretty Brook, if
the hot season had not tyrannically suppressed part of it is current; yet it
appeared beautiful in that littleness, because it contributed to the
flourishing greenness of the place, and that beauty invited Cassianus to to
enjoy the delight thereof: Wherefore alighting from his Horse, and turning his
bridle over his head, to give him the more liberty to please himself in that
luxurious pasturage, whilst he meant only to feed upon the sadness of his
own thoughts, sat down upon the Bank of the River, into which he let fall
many of his tears, as if he intended to supply the accidental defect
thereof; but when the fountain of his eyes had paid a sufficient tribute to
his grief, and that his sighs had awakened him to some expression, he
discoursed to himself in this manner, since the ignorant Woods seemed no way
capable of his complaints, but in returning a doleful echo to augment his
sufferings.

Unfortunate Cassianus said he, whose youth has scarce numbered years to make
thee a perfe^t subject of misery, and yet thy crosses render thee the only
unhappy spectacle of all Asia, for that almost at one instant thou did not
alone lose thy dear Father and fruitful Country, but art forced to become a
wandering Pilgrim through the whole World without compassion, since thy
sufferings do not afford thee a competent pity amongst other Princes of thy
own rank, much less a necessary assistance from those which are above thee in
dignity: And last of all, when thou had thought to have attained some harbor
of consolation under the protection of thy powerful Uncle, abounding in all
plenty and tranquillity, thou art again cast upon a new rock that threatens
thy ruin, in that thou neither dare own that love which destroys thy rest,
nor have hope to quench the flames of thy desire to give thy self ease, the
one being too violent to be suppressed, as the other too impossible to be
obtained: For can thou think fond Cassianus said he, that her innocence may
be attempted without the consent of her parents? or that her parents can be won
to so unprofitable a Match? and yet sweet Cloria, consider rather the virtue of
an entire affection, that is, the only tie required by the just heavens, then
the sole commodity of Empires, to make thee happy in a choice; but alas, alas,
I foolishly bestow my vain breath upon the abundant air, and my sorrowful
tears to increase the plentiful springs, since neither have power to
contribute to my redress, when it must be action if any thing that will afford
satisfaction; and yet with what face thou can present thy widow love to so
excellent a purity, the Gods must only instruct, if they intend at all to be
propitious in thy affairs. But as he was again taking a new carreere of
passion, he might see of a sudden the hunted Boar foaming with his own
choler, rush out of the thickest woods, and not long after a youth of a manly
proportion, who followed the chase with a bold eagerness, however by his
different attire, he was easily to be discerned to be none of the morning
Company: this prospect invited Cassianus, with some curiosity, to attend the
success of the encounter, since the valiant Beast finding himself to be
pursued by so exact a courage, quickly turned with fury upon the young man,
which represented to his expectation a spectacle not more dangerous then
pleasant, for honor and cruelty seemed to contend for victory. The conflict
endured a long time, the one striving by a rude violence to avoid destruction,
as the other with a handsome activity sought to become victorious, till at last
both being heated with the fight, began to approach at a nearer distance, since
the youths spear broken in the encounter, afforded him no other convenience to
offend his enemy, which however he managed with so much advantage, that the
Boar having received many wounds, w^^ forced with open mouth to attempt his
prosecuter as his last refuge, though to his ruin: for the stranger taking
advantage of his unskilful rage, thrust his short weapon with his whole hand,
into the Boares throat, with so fortunate an issue, that the point appeared in
his neck behind, though the stroke deprived him not presently of life, but
seemed rather to give him new courage, however less power; for turning a fresh
with a new fury upon the disarmed youth, he had no defense to prevent the
danger but to traverse his ground, until the Beast's much loss of blood, by
reason of his enraged agitation, made him become the trophie of his honor, who
quickly separated his head from his body, with a short Sword he wore by his
side, as the testimony of a perfect Conquest, and then placed it upon a little
hill, supported with the broken Lance, whilst he himself approached the River
to wash his hands that were bespotted in the fight with the Boares blood.

Cassianus having beheld this Combat with a most earnest delight, if any thing
could be termed delight that his sad imagination looked upon, thought he could
do no less then congratulate so pleasing a Tragedy, and to that purpose rose
from his seat with that intention, which the stranger beholding, though until
then he was not advertised of any bodies presence in that solitary habitation,
as quickly prepared himself to give him the meeting, and the rather for that
he appeared a person of some quality, until both their designs brought them
to so near a distance, that the youth was soon known to Cassianus to be his
only friend Eumenus, a Gentleman bred up in his Mothers Court, whose Father
had accompanied her out of Lydia into Iberia, when she was first married: As
the Gods can tell with what inward content these two companions performed their
first imbracement, wherein they seemed to be eternally united in fortune, not
to be separated again by any disaster, so was it not very long before their
desires of knowing each others adventures separated their persons: wherefore
seating themselves by that river side that had entertained them both, Eumenes
was persuaded to begin the first story, in order to the time it was acted,
which he performed after this manner; though he kept still his eye, as a
watchful sentinel over his friends person. Cassianus, said he, you know that
your virtuous mother, for my more absolute breeding, sent me into Ciprus to be
trained in the wars under the command of that excellent Duke, finding my
disposition and years suited well enough with the profession, which for the
time separated you and me, to both our griefs, though the intention was
honorable; and being so, I had reason to dispose my thoughts toward the
accomplishment of some perfection in that noble exercise; where remaining two
years, as you may have heard, fortune so favored my actions, that in many
attempts upon the enemy, I gained a convenient reputation; however my ambition
raised my imagination to higher fancies, in so much as I not only thought upon
a Mistress unto whom I might consecrate all my Military endeavors, as an
essential part (as I thought) of a soldier, but was resolved to fly in no
lower a place then in that region where the Dukes only daughter moved the
fair, Eretheria, whose perfections (I conceived) were alone fit to captivate
my intentions; and to that purpose, upon all occasions I strived to let the
world see my aims, which soon procured me a multitude of rivals of no mean
quality, who thought it scarce justice to let a stranger carry away the glory
of Ciprus: but not long after, by the violent solicitation of the youthful
Courtiers, a Turnament was proclaimed, upon the birthday of the Princes; where
every one hoped to show that valor, that might render him worthy of the high
prize ordained for the Conqueror. The time being come for the trial, the
bright Star, Eretheria, was placed upon a Throne, like a Deity sent by the
heavens to captivate all mortal hearts; which sight certainly enflamed every
courage with a new spirit, though we all beheld her as a Comet threatening
destruction to many, since but one pretender could hope to live by her favor:
but the sounding of the Trumpets quickly wakened us out of this admiring
slumber, to be more gloriously active, which (in truth) performed such deeds of
all sides, that Eretheria seemed not to be dishonored in the encounters;
however a young Nobleman of Cyprus, passionately also taken with her beauty,
seemed all the day to carry away the chief victory, which procured him, as you
may imagine, a competent number of emulators, if not enviers; amongst which
company, I must confess, I wished him not better then the rest, since I
supposed my self as deeply interessed in the quarrel: Wherefore choosing one
of the biggest Spears I could find, though my heart was a great deal bigger
with the desire of his disgrace, I sought him out in the crowd, with so happy a
success to my thoughts, that I quickly un-hors'd him in the amidst of his
prevailing glory, to the no small amazement of the people, who esteemed him
almost immortal; and therefore crowned the action with so loud a shout, that
the heavens seemed to ring for a long time with the noise; which to my infinite
content possessed me entirely with the rich prize from the fair hands of
Eretheria; besides a multitude of other honors belonging to the Ceremony.

But however I seemed to be carried triumphantly in a Chariot, beyond the reach
of any envy, yet my rival forgot not the effects of revenge; since he esteemed
himself not only to suffer in honor, but in love; and the rather for that he
imagined from that instant Eretheria turned in some sort her looks more
graciously toward me then formerly she had done, by reason of the fortunate
success I had in the Ti^ing. Wherefore one day meeting me half armed in the
Park belonging to the Court, he set upon me with all violence, both with his
language and weapon, insomuch as I had enough to do to avoid the one, as I did
not at all dispute with him in the other, since my best faculties had
employment sufficient to defend my person against so spightfull a valor;
though the Gods favoring my innocence more then his injustice, at last gave me
an unfortunate victory, since not only his life was the price of my conquest,
but the fear of a dishonorable death compelled me quickly to quit Cyprus, to
avoid the prosecution of his powerful friends, where however I have left my
heart a prisoner, to be condemned or saved by the mercy of beauteous Eretheria;
which occasioned also the slaughter of this beast before your eyes; for
conceiving my own Country my best place of refuge until this storm might be
blown over, I retired hither with two servants only, who are not yet arrived;
and traveling the woods, having lost my way, I accidentally met with this
hunted Boar that set upon me with some fury, which forced me at first to the
encounter, else I should have scarce been so uncharitable as to have destroyed
the sport: These accidents, dear Cassianus, said he, have been the reasons
that brought me into Lydia, only happy now in our meeting.

Cassianus having both kept silence, and observed attentiveness in his friends
discourse, as it were congratulating his story and welcome, by four or five
sad sighs, being compelled by his importunity, to make relation of his own
fortunes also, without many circumstances, began in this manner^ After my
unfortunate father, as you well know, said he, had paid the death of his rash
attempt (in taking upon him the Crown of Mesopotamia, contrary to the good
liking of Artaxes great King of Armenia) with his death, and loss of his
fruitful Country of Iberia, my infancy, as you were a witness, was carefully
cherished by my mothers natural goodness; insomuch as she thought not my
years capable of your employments in Cyprus, although both my desires and
wishes accompanied you in your journey; however, after your departure she
designed me to another War, though by much more gentle yet not so honorable,
which was to court the love of a rich Heir, not far off the place where we
lived, by whose power she conceived (if I could compass the Marraige) I might
be again rendered capable to contend with Tygranes Duke of Colches, who enjoyed
the Possession of my native Country, by the donation of Artaxis, in
retribution of that service he did him in the prosecution of my Father; but no
sooner had a fitting preparation elevated my thoughts to the enterprise, but
the King became advertized of the intention, so that arriving at her Castle I
was encountered by my double Rival the Duke, contrary to my expectation, who
came there also with the same design, though fortified as he thought with far
greater pretentions, since he brought with him the strong recommendation, of
his mighty friend the King of Armenia; but the Gods know, with what labor I
suppressed the passion of my soul, that it might not burst out into a rude, and
inhospitable contention, to destroy absolutely my intended proceedings, so that
both of us addressing our selves to the Ladies presence, with a quiet civility,
we were received in outward show with equal courtesy, which continued us for
some weeks in her Palace, only seeking occasions how we might best present our
affections, with most convenience to deceive each other: But the Duke, whether
impatient of his long attendance, or suspecting I received private favors to
his prejudice, of a sudden one morning before any one was up in the house,
took his leave both of his Chamber and the Castle, by which means he left me
in full possession of my desires, since I thought no obstacle now was able to
hinder my proceedings of a prosperous issue; in which paradise of felicity I
continued for many days, solacing my self with delightful fancies, whilst in
the mean time the Duke was preparing a snare not only to captivate the Lady,
but to entrap me; for not long after he marched in person with a powerful
Army to besiege the Castle where we both remained; which news made me dispose
of my self by flight, into certain obscure Woods not far off, whereby I
might not only be secure from the danger of my mortal enemy, but have
convenience by my escape to procure some relief to succor the distressed
Lady; which accident has brought me into Lydia, to renew my fathers old suite
to Euarchus for the recovery of our ancient inheritance the Principality of
Iberia, since the Lady as I hear has not only lost her Castle but I my
hopes; for she is constrained to become a captive wife to the cruel Tyrant
Tygranes Duke of Colches. And this dear Eumene, is the sad story of my
fortunes; and the more to be lamented, since I am not certain to what
resolution my Uncles thoughts will be brought, he yet being determined but to
send an Ambassador, to treat for a peaceable and friendly restitution, whilst
in the mean time I languish between hope and despair.

But scarce was he come to this issue, when they might hear the Hounds in full
cry pursue the footsteps of the dead Boar toward the place where they were,
which gave Eumenes no convenience for reply, hardly time sufficient to protect
the testimony of his victory, from the violent cruelty of the Dogs, who
seemed not to be pacified in his death. Wherefore rising from the seat where he
sat, and snatching up the head, he held it upon the point of the spear in the
air, whilst the Hounds with open mouths, seemed to besiege his person, until
the Huntsmen themselves coming into the quarre, were forced to defend him from
their rude violence, and in that employment he continued, while the other
almost lost company, had leisure to assemble, to perfect the triumph for the
slaughter of that cruel Beast, that had done so much mischief in the Country,
terrifying the common people with the frightfull apprehension of his aspect,
who durst not travel by the places of his habitation, to follow their
necessary occasion. But not long had the Ladies satisfied their curiosities in
beholding the dead Boar, though yet at some distance scarce believing him so
in effect, as also infinitely commending Eumenes valor, that had in single
Combat brought him to his destruction, as they understood by Cassianus, that
had been the eyewitness of the encounter; But the King and Queen in a gentle
hand gallop, made toward them through the same passage that Cassianus had
found out in his solitary contemplation, which gave Eumenes occasion,
accompanied with his friend Prince Cassianus, to present himself before their
persons, not only offering to the Queen the Boares head as a sacrifice to her
beauty, but desired humbly to be excused that he had unwillingly interrupted
their sport. When Cassianus had certified Euarchus fully of all the proceedings
in that Combat, wherein he let nothing pass that concerned his friends
honor, and also made the King acquainted with his breeding, condition, and
Country, he soon obtained absolution for his valiant fact: However, the
envious evening coming on, which denied the undertaking of a new Chase, a
cessation from that sport was quickly proclaimed by the Kings command, and the
rather for that they returned with victory and spoil: Wherefore Euarchus and
Hiachinthia taking the two friends into their own Coach, whilst the skillful
Coachman made what haste he could through the rugged way, they required of
Eumenes not only the relation of his own travells, but the satisfaction of the
manner of the government of the Island of Cyprus, since their revolt from the
King of Egypt.

Eumenes receiving this injunction from the King, however he supposed, he
rather desired to have his curiosity satisfied in his ability, then that his
knowledge could any way be instructed by his relation, excusing himself
concerning his own particular adventures, as not worthy His Majesty's
attention, he prosecuted this discourse: Truly Sir, said he, it is no small
difficulty for a person of my mean capacity, to particularize the true causes
or motives of the first revolts in any Kingdom, though you are pleased to give
me the employment, since as the complaints for the most part are confused and
uncertain, more governed perhaps by the passions and fancies of the common
people, then grounded upon right and knowledge; so of the other side, it cannot
be denied, but that often times prerogative and power will find out ways and
shifts to cast off the aspersions, either against themselves or favorites;
though I must confess both may have reason enough, to defend their
allegations, before an indifferent auditory, if such a Tribunal could be
instituted; but that not being possible to be had upon earth, most commonly
such contentions are only ended by the sword; which Fate has befell the
fruitful Island of Cyprus, though now it be established in a perfect
prosperity.

To this purpose, the King of Egypt, natural Lord of those Countries, having
placed a Lady of eminent virtues as supreme governesse for him, both in Cyprus
and Pamphylia, whether the people presuming upon the supposed weakness of her
sex, joined with the inconstancy of their own humors and dispositions; or
rather being put on to demand something (though they knew not very well what)
that seemed to appertain to their ancient privileges, by the ambition of some
of the Nobility; (that belike seemed not very well satisfied) of a sudden began
most violently to complain of the obstruction of their customs, as also of
the cruelty of the laws made (as they pretended) both against their freedom
and consciences; And being transported with these furious fancies, when the
Court least thought of their disorders, they run violently to all the chief
Temples of the City, where I may say, they committed many outrages, of nearest
affinity with sacrilege and rebellion: but the Governesses extraordinary
mildness and temper, not only quickly assuaged all these begun misdemeanors,
but readily pardoned their offenses, though she very well knew, many principal
persons were interessed in the occasion of those Tumults; notwithstanding she
wisely and discreetly seemed not to take notice of them in regard such
intimations might create those jealousies, that probably would again kindle a
new fire of discontent and apprehension.

However the Court and Council of Egypt, having understood these proceedings,
whose greatness of Empire and power in command, could brook neither resistance
nor dispute, thought it not agreeing with the honor and dignity of their King
(whose authority before these accidents, seemed rather to be adored then
contraverted) to suffer these insolences to escape, without some remarkable
severity, as well in regard of the nobility as the people; presently designed a
huge army for these countries, composed of the best and oldest soldiers Egypt
could produce; And these Troops were put under the command of a person of the
same Nation, that better knew how to punish facts committed, by a kind of harsh
cruelty, then to compose differences newly begun, with mildness and temper;
rather imitating those Physicians, which use desperate remedies to perfect the
body the sooner, then by prolonging application to save part, for fear the
whole should perish. In short, whose experience in the wars was more ancient
and glorious, then his nature any way relenting; in so much as like a storm
coming a far of, demonstrated by lightning and thunder, he gave the people
cause of fear and terror, before the tempest arrived; which caused many of
them, by the report only to quit their dwellings; as of the other side, not a
few of the Noblemen, that were the least confident of their own loyalty,
presently engaged one another in private counsels. As soon as this great
General arrived, he not only dispossessed the Governesse her self of her
chief authority, by producing a larger commission, but seized upon the persons
of many of the Nobility, whose lives were publicly sacrificed to his fury,
whilst terror and amazement seized the hearts of the common people:
Notwithstanding this rough demeanor, he proclaimed every where, should be
maintained by the sword, until his own thoughts could become satisfied, of the
subjects entire obedience to his commands.

These rigorous and new proceedings, quickly involved the whole Island of
Cyprus in a trembling confusion, as well as in a future rebellion, insomuch as
almost all people entertained these strange beginnings, as sad omens, if not
prevented by some tmely resistance, that threatened a general destruction, as
well to their lives as estates; when as formerly they held themselves the
freest subjects of the world, by reason of those privileges they had gained,
by the indulgent natures of their many good and merciful Princes.

And thus, Sir, I must say, was the first fatal fire kindled in Cyprus, which
since has been augmented by the powerful interest of most of the Potentates
in Asia: For as upon these pretenses the people presently flew out into open
hostility, so did they call in as many foreign Princes, as they could to
their assistance, who glad of any occasion to give bounds to the Egyptian
Monarchy, that then began to swell to a vast largeness in command, readily
contributed their best endeavors; especially the father of Orsames King of
Syria, in so much as the effects since have produced so much blood and
slaughter, with other varieties of success and fortune, that many books might
be amplified with the story; until the succession of command fell to this
gallant Duke, that now bears sway in that Region, who has been so principal
an instrument of the happiness and present flourishing condition of the Island
(being not more valiant in war, then wise in peace) that the king of Egypt
himself, is not only reduced at present to that state, by reason of his
powerful contentions against him, both by sea and land, that he seeks peace
upon any terms, with a resignation of all his pretended rights; besides the
people in regard of the Dukes prudent government, with their own industry, (who
at the beginning of these stirs were rather poor and contemptible fishermen,
then approved and credible Merchants) are become now so terrible upon the Sea,
that by their numerous Vessels for trading, they fetch home to their own
quarters, all the riches of the world; the Queen hereupon put a stop to Eumenes
discourse with this language: and yet I have heard, said she, all the
recompense he can procure from their gratitudes, is only a bare pension for
his support and subsistence; neither will they willingly allow him any other
Title, then their servant; however his valor and conduct in the wars, upon
all occasions, brings to their assistance the best spirits of Asia, as
conceiving him most worthy to be their master in martial affairs. It Is true
Madam, answered Eumenes, I must needs confess the people themselves, although
naturally they are no soldiers, being altogether addicted to the industry of
the spade, by which faculty they have performed admirable things, to the wonder
of other Nations, yet are they crafty enough to maintain their own liberties,
and suffer the Duke to enjoy no other jurisdiction over them, then what they
are content from time to time, to afford him for their best commodity and
advantage: nevertheless it is thought, if his ambition were equal to his
power, he might make himself absolute Prince of the Country, without
contradiction, having the army so entirely at his command; as well in regard of
many factions amongst their Governors, as by reason of the necessity of one
head and Governor; especially if they should purchase to themselves peace from
the King of Egypt, who (as I said before) now seems with earnestness to
desire it of them.

After the King had a little smiled upon the Queen at Eumenes discourse, so
much pretending to the Dukes interest and commendation, being himself
extremely perfect in the knowledge of those parts, he began to argue with him
in this manner: Although I cannot, said the King, but approve of your
observations, and much more commend your affectionate retorick in the Dukes
behalf, who no doubt in the general deserves as much as you have said, yet I
must not conclude altogether with you in belief, concerning this easy
accession to sovereignty, though his intentions were directed to those
ambitions: for notwithstanding you may see him always attended with glorious
and gallant Troops in the field; a prospect, I must confess, that cannot but
dazzle youthful or common eyes; yet when it shall be considered withal, that
the common soldiers (who for the most part are rather carried on to their
employments, by their own private gain, then by the advancement of their
general) are only paid by certain treasurers appointed by the people,
entirely faithful to their designs, that upon the least disorders may
obstruct or detain their wages, either in part or in the whole; it will be a
very difficult matter, to unite them absolutely in the Dukes designs against
the Commonwealth; especially when it shall be also remembered, that most of all
the Towns in the Island, are not only strong both by nature and art, but are
continually guarded by the Burgers themselves, without having any relation at
all to the General, and so by consequence are furnished with provisions of
every fort, in so much as the least fort of the Country, is neither to be
surprised by any manner of stratagem, or to be taken without a very long siege,
which would give the Dukes army without pay, occasion enough to change their
resolutions in the interim; and rather seek to betray his person, then advance
his ambition: Wherefore I hold him to be much a wiser man, in desisting from
those attempts, then in entering upon designs, that at the worst may ruin his
posterity, and at the best cannot much mend his condition; since at the present
the people afford him so large a pension for his entertainment, that does more
then equal the revenues of many absolute Princes of the inferior rank, which
is enjoyed, as I may say, without either hazard or trouble.

And however the factions of the people, as you have intimated may seem
something to contribute to this probability, yet considering in their natures,
how much they are addicted to freedom and equality, though such a necessity
should compel a change, I am most confident they would rather call in again
their old Prince, then make election of any new; much less the Duke, whom
however his birth and Titles are more illustrious, yet in their hearts they
rank him as once a fellow subject with themselves, to the King of Egypt. And
if peace, as you say, should be entirely restored to that Island, the contrary
now being a means the more strongly to unite them against the common enemy, yet
such is their hate to a jurisdiction of that nature, I am persuaded they would
never be brought to that subjection, without an absolute conquest and
desolation; witness their not being able, as you have already related to brook
it in their lawful King, under whom they seemed to enjoy all manner of
felicity and content: It Is true, it is otherwise with the subjects of Syria, who
are so wedded to the honor and prosperity of their Prince, that it is
unpossible to withdraw their fidelities, by any taxations, or almost
oppressions whatsoever, though sometimes their Nobility perhaps, fly out
against the power and greatness of favorites, who seem something to obscure
their interest with their Sovereign, but all dispositions not being alike: As
for example, I find my own subjects begin already, to be weary of those
happinesses under a peaceful Monarch, that other kingdoms can but only hope
for, after a long and bloody experience: The King at their very words, as if he
felt something inwardly at the soul, rested silent for a pretty space; and
then again, as if he had anew recollected his spirits, kissing the Queen twice
or thrice, he altered the subject of his serious discourse, into another of
more variety and delight; which continued them employed, until they arrived at
the palace gate, where many lighted Torches attended to conduct him and the
Queen up the stairs. Their supper being finished, with no more curious
tediousness, then was convenient for the satisfying of the necessity of their
appetites, sharpened by their past days exercise, a great part of the night was
spent in dancing with the Ladies, according to the custom of the delightful
Court of Lydia; in which recreation it was Cassianus fortune, to entertain the
beautiful Princes Cloria, as if the Gods intended him the opportunity; but
whether his fancy only made him believe it, or that really he did utter
something of that nature to her innocent ears; yet she seemed no way to be
warmed by a lovers flames: in so much as poor Cassianus became of a sudden as
frozen as his Mistresses apprehensions; since he too feelingly suspected a
denial in that suit, which perhaps his own fears would not sufficiently
suffer him to discover to her understanding; And oftentimes too much desire
renders us not only unfit to act, but incapable to interpret: but however
these accidental passages were either executed or entertained, Euarchus and
Hyacinthyas unexpected retirement for the present, gave no more opportunity for
a further trial of either; which not only quickly separated the company, but
retired the strangers into their several chambers: where Cassianus gave his
eyes no leisure at all to rest, by reason of the discurtesie of his own
Turbulent thoughts, that drove him from one unquiet fancy to another, until
the more charitable morning invited him into something a handsome sleep: but
after two hours time, that also was interrupted by factious Dimogoras, who
with a certain kind of storm in his countenance, entered abr^ptly his chamber,
which freedom he ever challenged, by reason of the confidence he had of his
own faithfulness to the Princes designs.

After Dimogoras had bestowed upon the Prince some few complements belonging to
his dignity, as well as answerable to the season, he let him know he had some
discourse of consequence to impart unto him, if he pleased to dismiss his
Attendants.

Those being gone, and he invited by the Prince, to seat himself upon his bed
side, for the more convenience, with a kind of melancholy and discontented
countenance, accompanied with a more hasty and rough delivery, he entertained
his ears with this language:

Although it be most true, my Lord, said he, that it is given out by the
spightfull Court, and suffered by the Kings injustice, that both my nature and
desires, with a great deal of violence hunt after nothing but contentions,
whereby I might come to have some eminent employment in the wars; yet I take
all the Gods to witness (who best are acquainted with my thoughts) that your
entire service is the chief motive of my designs, grounded also upon the
consideration both of the present and future honor and glory of our Nation,
now almost adulterated by ease and quiet, though principally betrayed to this
lethargy by the pernicious counsels of Pollinex, that for his own advantage
and ends, flatters the King with the opinion of his conceived prosperity, as if
never before the like Prince had reigned in Lydia; when as all Asia is
scandalized at our government; for Euarchus by reason of this cold newetrality
is esteemed if not an enemy, at least wise no friend to any, but his own
concernments; and so can never expect a faithful assistance from other States,
if he were compelled by the same necessity to require their aid in any of his
occasions, though a little for the present he seems to swim in all
successful glory.

In this enchantment you see it is not only possible for him to behold your
Rights violated by the violent and (I may say) tyrannical oppression of your
cruel enemies, with a most quiet if not insensible demeanor, notwithstanding
all the ties of Affection, Kindred, and Religion, but in his own person is
wrought in to so low a stupidity, and unworthy ingratitude, that he cannot be
brought to bestow the least reward, or so much as any countenance upon men of
spirit, fame, and desert; witness our small title of honor denied Lycius the
brave Myssean Commander, that so gallantly defended your cause against the King
of Armenia's power.

This being sufficiently apprehended in your thoughts, I shall a little show my
own condition, that thereby you may the better judge of me and my designs; to
this purpose I must tell you, that ever since I had ability to draw and handle
a Sword, I have still vowed my endeavors to the service of your Family,
insomuch as when a General was appointed by Euarchus Father with a royal
Army, after that unfortunate Defeat in Mesopotania, to defend your Mothers
Rights; in the Principallitie of Iberia, against Tygranes forces, I not only
strongly urged the employment from the State, but accompanied the Soldiers in
the Journey, until we were commanded away by the King; which however has so
seasoned my thoughts with the concernments of your noble House, that I cannot
but continue my Soul working, a just revenge in your hehalfe, according to the
many injuries and indignities you have received: You must now give me leave to
come nearer your interest for the present, neither wonder at my intelligence,
since I do confidently assure you, that there is scarce a Court design how
private soever, but I have knowledge of the resolution, by reason of my kindred
and intimation amongst the chiefest of Euarchus Councellers.

With this assurance you must know, that not many days ago there is arrived
upon the Confines of Lydia, Anaxia the old Queen of Syria, who being for some
time beaten at sea by storms, as at land by tempests, procured by her own
restless nature, that could not endure to sit quiet under the security of her
Sons protection, at last is come under the jurisdiction of Euarchus, as I
believe, with an intention to raise as many troubles in this Kingdom, as she
has for some years past in other places.

As I cannot deny her to be a Lady of excellent parts, and in her youth of
extraordinary beauty, so by her birth she is of Corinthe, the only Daughter to
the Duke of that magnificent City, which procured her such a liking by Orsames
Father, after the divorce of his former wife, that with much passion he not
only made her Queen of Syria, but at his death appointed her the sole Guardian
both of his Son and Kingdom. This Office truly she managed with discretion
enough, until the young Kings competent years, joined with the ambition of
some about his person, compelled her of a sudden to leave her jurisdiction, yet
not without so much unwillingnesse and distaste, that the lives of her
principal Councellers were sacrificed by reason of the resistance, and her
self for a long space was confined to a Castle far from the Court, there to
practice more obedience, since her active spirit was deemed to be inconsistent,
with the true and necessary subjection befitting a Subject, though still
honored as a Mother: However in that place, time and solitary conversations,
taught her so much patience or dissimulation, that contrary to all men's
expectations she bore this misfortune (so much esteemed repugnant to her nature
and constitution) for some years, with an extraordinary pacification, insomuch
as the King was induced by reason of these outward testimonies of her absolute
conversion, if not in regard of his own filial duty that could not but
demonstrate compassion, to send for her again to the Court, not only to enjoy
the comfort of her conversation, but also to make use of her Counsels:
Nevertheless she had not long moved in that sphere of glory, being preswaded
by some factious dispositions, or over suspicious and jealous in her own
thoughts, before she began to show evident marks of her inward discontents; For
no sooner was the War broke out between Orsames and the King of Egypt,
(kindled as 'twas said in part by her means) but she flew with all violence to
the Egyptian Court, where she has been until this present, and perhaps would
have longer there remained, not knowing else whither well to fly for shelter
and protection, if she had not procured an employment that at present suites
perfectly with her appetite, which is to treat of a Match between the Princess
Cloria our Kings Daughter, and Osiris the King of Aegypt's Son; and this will
no doubt be readily embraced by Euarchus, since he may thereby hope the better
to curb his poor Subjects, who he knows are rather awed by his power, then
satisfied in his affection.

Though Dimogoras seemed still to prosecute his discourse, yet Cassianus at
these last words of Cloria and Osiris, felt himself as it were struck with
thunder and lightening; insomuch as presently turning his face to the wall, he
scarce gave any more ear to what he said: Dimogoras finding with some more
observation, that the Prince had not only changed his posture, but his
attentvenesse, imagined that the very apprehension of Euarchus disaffection to
his person, in regard his interest had been so long neglected, was the sole
reason of his sudden alteration, though the secret flames of the Princess
Clorias beauty, was the only occasion of his present distemper, considering
the small probability was left him to obtain his desire, now a Match of such
splendour was offered to her choice.

After Dimogoras had expected something longer what the Prince would do, he
began this discourse; As I cannot blame your nature much, said he, to be
troubled considering the cunning diversions of your Uncle Euarchus, whom as I
may say, seeks any thing in a manner, before your good and benefit, so of the
other side it does not become a Prince of your birth and extraction, to
entertain dejectly these passages, when you may be assured that almost all
Lydia will contribute bountifully to your present aid and assistance;
wherefore I say, since this sloathfull man is so far from being moved in regard
of his natural inclination to ease and pleasure, out of those courses which
his flatterers have bewitched him in, we must endeavor to disturb him in his
Government; and the rather for that we see he intends another effect of
tyranny by a new allience with the Egyptian State to maintain his absolute
jurisdiction over the liberties of his people, though Cloria were more properly
bestowed upon your self of the same Blood and Religion, then on a person whose
Nation has ever had designs pernicious to this Commonwealth; upthese
considerations as it cannot be but thought convenient by the whole Kingdom to
look to it is own safety, so by an unavoidable necessity we must have
presently assembled the great Council, to put a sudden stop to these threatening
events, that like ominous Comets seem at this instant to have direful aspects
in our Horizon, blazing as it were destruction to all our happiness and
prosperity; and for that Euarchus will never endure to hear of such a remedy
without mere compulsion; we will attempt to stir up the rage of the
discontented Myssian, over whom Orsames the King of Syria, has such an
absolute jurisdiction that Euarchus Authority will be very little esteemed in
those parts, notwithstanding the legallity of his Title; and that King, as you
very well know, cannot be but well pleased, to lay hold of any occasion,
whereby this new intended alliance between the Crowns of Lydia and Egypt, may
be blasted in the bud, before it come into any mature ripeness.

As he was further proceeding in these exclamations against the Government,
they were both interrupted by a Messenger from the King, not only to know how
the Prince had rested the night past after his days sport in hunting, but
withal to desire his company in a ceremonious courtship, he intended in
person to be bestow upon the old Queen of Syria his Wives Mother, though
before the Officer could be sent for into the Princes Chamber, Dimogoras
suddenly took his leave.

When Cassianus had humbly returned his thanks to the King, for his favor in
inquiring (as he said) any way after his concernments, he told the Messenger,
that however he could not be very apprehensive of his own danger, yet he must
complain a little of his indisposition, which he feared would hinder him from
rendering His Majesty that service he commanded, especially since the Ceremony
was necessarily to be performed in so great an assembly; rather his intentions
were for some few days to keep his Chamber, as he said, to try whether that
retirement would in any kind contribute to his amendment, since he found his
thoughts oppressed by melancholy fancies.

This quickly gave occasion to most of the Court to visit him, yet at those
times when h^ perceived himself free from those complements, (that he counted
no other then mere disturbancies) he would often dispute with his discontents
in this nature, which proved a great deal more uncomfortable, in regard he
communicated his thoughts to none:

O Cassianus, said he, to what dangerous rocks have thy fortunes led thee, not
to be relieved, but by an inhospitable compliance, with those that perhaps more
for their own ambition, then thy good, endeavor thy unkles ruin? O gentle
Cloria, is it possible that these thoughts in thy servants breast, can be any
more concealed from thy knowledge, then from the Gods divinest Oracle? what
greater indignity can be offered to the heavens, then to harbor in one heart,
both love and treason, at the same time? consider, O unworthy Cassianus, with
what affectionate protestations Euarchus has hitherunto entertained all thy
concernments, which has produced effects already, to the sending of an
Ambassador to the King of Armenia, upon whose return, and not before, thou art
to expect thy doom; and for this pretended love between Cloria and Osiris,
perhaps the report is only a bare fancy, grounded more upon distastefull
suspicion, then upon authentical information, since the old Queen of Syrias
necessities, gave her reason enough, to seek both retirement and reception,
without any other design whatsoever: nay further it may very probably be
supposed, that Dimogoras interest or spleen, may administer occasions both of
too much jealousy, and over hasty action; wherefore Cassianus, be not thou
ignobly the chief instrument of Dimogoras malice, and the only stale to
others ends. Thus he employed his time, whilst a brave Mask was preparing at
court, for the entertainment of the Queen of Syria; which in the interim filled
every ones expectation, though it continued still Cassianus in his chamber;
however, as I said before, more visited then his though^s desired.

For this great Triumph there was designed, a large Hall within the City of
Sardis, supported with Corinthian pillars of Theban Marble, erected at the
first only for the Coronation of the Kings of Lydia: it was beautified with
excellent pictures of Mosayich work, enriched with Azure and Gold; the sides
represented several delightful Landskips, composed for the most part of
natural stones; and where in true representation any place wanted, the defects
became supplied, with exquisite painting of most of the best hands of Asia: the
flower was all wrought over with diverse figures of Jet and Ivory, here and
there also graced by other colors: when the night came of this glorious
solemnity, Euarchus himself was mounted on a Transparent Throne, supported
upon the backs of golden Lions; over his head was the portraiture of Jupiter,
much greater then the life, bestriding a huge Eagle, and holding Thunder in his
hand, four steps below his feet lay as it were asleep, a silver Unicorne and
brazen Lion, entangled with intermixed Roses and Thistles: on the other side
sat Hyacinthia in a state of white Satin, embroydered with the story of
Phaeton, confused tumbling from his fathers Chariot, as also wearing upon his
youthful head Apollo's burning rays, the only period of his rash and foolish
ambition; which by the cunning placing of certain Torches behind, seemed to
give a kind of a natural light in the imagination of the earnest spectators;
between them two degrees higher, was placed the old Syrian Queen, in a chair
of purple Velvet, beseeming the gravity of her age, wrought very thick with
Flower de Luces; the fair Princess Cloria sat at her grandmothers feet,
clothed all in white, not more to show forth the innocence of her Virginity,
then to become the excellency of her perfections: no sooner had the Lords and
Ladies of the Court seated themselves to their best advantages, for the honor
of the one, and the beauty of the others, sparkling like so many Stars in the
Firmament; but the Kings Officer, unto whom the charge was committed, gave
present command that the show should be discovered; whereupon a large curtain
at the farther end of the room by little and little lifted it self up to the
uppermost part of the roof, behind which was represented a large Heaven,
curiously figured by many shining clouds: under this seeming concave, was an
artificial Globe of the earth, supported by a huge Atlas, though stooping, who
was placed in a vast sea, from whence presently issued forth out of a rock,
seemingly compacted of Gold and Mother of Pearl, the god Neptune, drawn in a
Triumphant Chariot by six Dolphins, and guarded by twice as many Mermaydes, who
after some circumstance, began the first Anty-Mask, to the Music only of
diverse Trytons; which being finished, and Neptune retiring with the same
Majesty he entered, the Giant of a sudden shook the Globe he carried upon his
shoulders; at which violence the whole seemed to fever in the midst, from
whence brake forth in a distracted manner, a multitude of several sorts of
people; some falling into the Sea, others climing upon the rocks to save their
lives; though a third company entered the room, and made the second dance with
extraordinary skill: after these were retired into their former habitation, the
goddess Venus descended from a cloud in a celestial chariot, accompanied by
many naked Cupids, who with sweet voices and variety of instruments, saluted
the King and Queens with this Ditty, to invite their spectators toward the
beholding some Revels from Olympus, commanded by Jupiter himself, to give their
Majesty's entertainment.

What wonder is it that we behold?
both love and honor crowned with Gold;
And every eye
does sparkle forth a Deity.
Haste then my Char'ot to the earth,
for day has there a second birth:
You Cupids sing,
whilst I salute the Lydian King.
It Is mighty Jove (great Prince) that sends
the gods below to be your friends,
when Triumphs seem
to entertain the Syrian Queen.
But Hyacinthia, it is to you,
that Juno now begins to bow;
who smiles to see,
such mortals as your subjects be.
Hence then be gone you winged boys,
and tell Olympus of our joys;
Put out each Star,
For here are lights outshine them far.
This also being ended, the Queen of Love again ascended the sky, when of a
sudden the Heavens opening all the gods appeared in several places, who
insensibly were descended to the midst of the Stage, where they performed a
Majestic or ceremonious march, and retired again in the same order they came,
until their Throne being something elevated in opposition to the Kings, they
remained fixed, whilst by changing of the scene from a kind of an enchanted
Palace in a beautiful Island, issued many Knights and Ladies, there belike
detained for some time, by their several fates in love adventures; who passing
two by two over a silver bridge, they soon appeared in an orderly manner, upon
the Theater before the Spectators: where having finished also their designs
with other varieties, the rest of the night was spent in continuation of those
magnificent sports: In the interim, poor Cassianus something weary of his own
solitary discontents, had quitted his melancholy chamber, to give a little
recreation to his thoughts; and to this purpose was retired into an obscure
nook of the Hall, when at the same instant, he might see the Princess Cloria
taken out to dance, which she performed with so spiritfull a modesty, that her
frequent blushes, did no more then add grace, to those skillful paces she was
to tread; which being finished, with a courteous smile she appeared to
congratulate the youthful Masker, that had enjoyed the honor of her person in
the pastime, whilst her dignity commanded him with humility, again to place her
in her seat, according to the custom; where her Princely grandmother receiving
her in her arms, with many kisses, sealed both her approbation and affection,
whispering also something in her ear, that caused Cloria at the same instant
to cast down her Diamond eyes upon the ground, with so bashful an innocence,
that all the company might easily judge something was spoken to her
apprehension, that she did not very well like, (...) understand.

But however, Cassianus who all the while beheld these passages, with a strong
jealousy and violent love, began to muster up his own discontents in a
despairing form; that rendered his imagination certain that Anaxia could
intin^ate nothing to the Princes Cloria, but the offered love of Osiris; which
drove him to so absolute a distraction, after many fruitless and si^en^
complaints, that he resolves presently to leave the Court, and to retire
himself to some obscure habitation, where he would only b^waile his own
misfortunes, or else porcure a disguise that might admit him into Clorias
presence without suspicion, and by that means purchase a convenience to
discover his own affection; This no sooner was represented to his imagination,
but it was passionately entertained by his fancy; so that laying hold on the
confusion of the time, and the employment of the company, he instantly went
into the Stable, after he had accommodated some necessary things in his
chamber, and took out his horse to transport himself he knew not whither,
though the night season favored so much his intention, that before morning he
was a pretty distance from the City of Sardis, not easily to be overtaken by
any search; and not many days after fell by chance into a most beautiful
Country, b^spotted all over with several colored fertilities, some meadows,
some arrable grounds, every one intermixed with luxurious Vines, and bordered
again with flourishing fields of standing Corn of diverse ripeness, according
to the nature of the grain; a river fair and winding, courteously contributing
to each part of the Territory, a participation of its bounty. This seeming
Paradise was bounded on all sides by an appearing Forest of even spread trees,
that by their equal growth resembled so many brothers of one birth, not
consenting to the ambitious overtopping of any of their fraternity; Certain
other lesser groves (within the compass) in several places adorned the
superficies of the earth, affording a convenient shade for Cattle, and their
pastors in the heat of the day; to retire for the ease of the one, and the
rural delight of the other; where Coridon and Phillis might meet freely, to
enterchange their love-discourses, and not be discovered by their too watchful
parents. Cassianus invited by the attractive prospect of the place, and denied
to travel by the extraordinary heat of the day, made choice for his rest of a
grassie Carpet, furnished exactly with many embroideries of nature, wrought by
the Goddess chief skill, and died with the excellent tinctures of the most
absolute time of the year. This habitation was covered over head with an archt
canopie of spreading branches, so thick woven together with green leaves, that
Phoebus had no power to dart through his beams by any skill or violence: the
gentle running of a crystal stream hard by gave leisure for the clear water
to convey it self by the secret conduits of the earth to the roots of the
trees, by which coolness they became more fruitful and flourishing.

These perfect delights also invited Cassianus, into a kind of a necessary, if
not pleasant slumber; however, scarce had he entered really into the quieting of
his disturbed senses, but he was again summoned by his ear to a new
distraction, since the sound of music called his eyes to behold the object
that gave it birth, which soon instructed him of a certain troop of people that
directed their steps toward the place of his abode, which gave him warning
presently to rise from his seat, to afford them the meeting, rather then t^ be
surprised in his drowsy posture; but before he could approach to so near a
distance, as to discover distinctly the company, he was encountered by a
certain ancient forrester handsomely clad in green, with a horn about his neck,
us the ensign of his profession, who quickly saluted him with this language.

Sir, said he, as it is not my intention either to inquire of your quality or
business, since neither concerns our present affairs; so, of the other side,
I cannot but attempt your charity, because we have some need of it at this
time; be pleased therefore to know, that the pleasant Country you are now in,
is inhabited by three sorts of people, that is to say, Gentlemen; Forresters,
and Shepherds; however, there is such a mutual agreement between them all,
that neither envies the others happiness, or prosperity; the greatest using so
gentle a familiarity to the meanest, that he is very well contented with his
subjection; and the rather, because it is not lasting, since every year new
Magistrates are chosen, by the free election of every one in particular; where
none of any sort is excluded from the government, which renders all satisfied;
and in this course of rural policy, we follow our pleasures, and occasions;
some in hunting, others in increasing their innocent flocks, and the rest in
composing Poetical Verses, which on holidaies are sung to our unskilful
music; where the best however, gains a certain victory that yields him
content. In this manner I have lived for many years, being by some accident
driven out of my own natural Country; having only one daughter to be the
inheritrix of my fortune; whose beauty, as I hope, rather then my substance,
has procured her two worthy suitors, of so just an equality in her eye, that
though she be not at all ambitious of a choice, it being only my pressing care
to see her married before I die; she is determined to marry one of them:
however, she is resolved not to make the election, nor I, because we are
unwilling to hazard a faction in that quiet course we intend to continue;
Wherefore it was decreed by the common consent of all, that the first stranger
we met should be the decider of the difference, since this is lhe last day
prefixed, by a certain rash oath I made to see her Nuptials performed; so that
by this means we take away all occasions of partiality, by making fortune the
Judge, for that both have sworn to stand to the arbitration, without mutiny or
disturbance, and willingly assist in the intended ceremonies, which are
presently to be performed by a holy Priest in a little Chapel within the
Forest; so that, if you please to take upon you this office, you will not
only afford us a perpetual obligation, but I shall prepare my self instantly
to inform you of the qualities and condition of the wooers, who are in yonder
troop, that still as you see, do expect the issue of my desire.

Cassianus, after he had for some time dwelt upon the prettiness of the
contention, and resolved to be a courteous Judge in the love quarrel, with a
deep sigh, reflecting upon his own concernments, which this difference seemed
to touch, returned him this answer: Reverend Sir, although I am not ignorant,
said he, that arbitrations, of what nature soever, most commonly leave one
party discontented, and therefore consequently is likely to procure me some
dis-favour; yet to comply with your desire, I am content to take upon me the
office, not only because I find the business pressing, by reason of your
oath; but also, hoping that the promises by the contenders made to each other,
will be an occasion to keep me safe from the evil will of either. Then said
the Forrester, after he had thanked him for his cour^ (...) it will be
convenient for me to let you know the state of the suitors, and their several
pretentions, which I shall do shortly, with few circumstances, since the far
spent day, will scarce else afford time to perform the necessary ceremonies
belonging to the marriage.

The two contenders, said he, or rather loverivals, have for some years
pretended to my daughter Mantuina, a young maid, whose bashfulnesse has kept
her back from entertaining either of their affections, although their persons
and qualities may challenge an exact beauty, much more the fortune of a
strangers child; but I that rather look upon the content of posterity, to
fortify me in this course of life, I have now taken on me, since I have small
hopes to return again into my own Country, being kept from thence by the
unjust power of my mortal enemy, a story too long at this time to relate;
although I am accustomed to make known my oppressions to most passengers that
visit these parts, being violently ambitious to have her bestowed, lest my
sudden death also might leave her to the world without a guide, and by that
means endanger her honor and prosperity, have made choice of one of these two,
whose laudable comportments and constant love, have rendered them worthy of my
regard, though neither can pretend to the highest fortune, which suites well
enough to my desires, since my intentions are to spin out the rest of my days
in this private, however contented course of life; and if we do chance to
return again to our own, there will be sufficient to maintain us in tha^
^^gnity we were born unto; in the mean time, it stirs up a compassion in all
sorts of people that know us, that I am forced in this manner to descend from
that quality I have formerly lived in. But to come to the point: these two
contenders, the one is called Fridius, the other Navarinus; the first a
Shepherd by extraction, though his prededessors left him well enough to become
a Gentleman; which has also inflamed his mind with aspiring thoughts, scarce
to be contained within the bounds of rural delights; the other a Nobleman
born, but wanting means, has subscribed his aims only within the limits of a
Country life, and in all probability is likely so to continue: which two in
person are to plead their causes, before you their designed Judge; wherein,
each is to speak what he can for his own advantage, to procure your Arbitration
favorable, whereby he may become the desired husband of my daughter Mantuina,
sitting upon yonder rising bank, the prepared Tribunal of this controversy,
to which purpose our company attend our approach.

Cassianus, although he was most willing to have enquired further of the
Forresters condition and adventures, yet finding the occasion could not admit
of any delay, contented himself only with obeying his desire, which led them
both to the expecting Troop; where having saluted every one in particular, they
marched to the little hill, and seated themselves after this manner; First, the
intended bride was placed uppermost, clothed in a green gown, with a chaplet of
flowers upon her head, carrying another garland in her hand to crown the
Conqueror, accompanied by Cassianus the elected Judge; whilst the two pleaders
stood of both sides, the one in the habit of a Gentleman, as the other
apparelled like a Shepherd; and when silence was three times proclaimed by a
Crier, Fridius, who seemed to have the prerogative first to speak, began in
this sort to open his cause: Most worthy Arbitrator, said he, as I esteem your
sentence the greatest that can befall me, since it must determine my chiefest
happiness; so of the other side, I cannot but be most confident of the
success, having so absolute a right in my pretension; though I will freely
confess an equality of affection and prosecution: for it is apparent to all the
auditory, that from a mean condition, I have created in my self a Princes
soul, tending to the highest preferment, by which I have endeavored to outdoe
my own fate; whilst the life of my adversary promises so little possibility of
advancement, that he has pulled down his thoughts below his birth, to give way
to contempt, making himself less then nature intended him, like fire buried
in the Cinders, wanting agitation and effect, whereas the property of the flame
should aspire: or rather resembling a cowed Lion, for want of action so proves
a scorn to other beasts; for it is not a Lions skin, but his heart, that ought
to render him formidable. If the fair Mantuina be given to me, said he, she
shall (in all likelihood) possess riches and power, the two essential
properties of greatness; and be, as it were, every day in a Lottery, ready
when fortune will, to be exalted to the highest Throne of honor by new
attempts; whereas, being wife to my adversary, she can never hope for more then
she has; scarce be assured of protection in what she now enjoys. All things
endued with life, look upward, as he affirmed; when those that are mortified,
fall always downward, to their proper center, only fit to be trod upon: it is
ambition, said he, that warmes the blood, and renders it Noble, whereas sloth
and want of desire causes obstructions, which hinder glory, since the great
Monarchs of the world could not have purchased to themselves fame or Empire, if
they had not advanced their thoughts beyond their present condition. And last
of all, he pretended 'twas the nature of beasts only to preserve what they
had, but of man to seek what he had not; and for these reasons he desired the
fair Mantuina of the Judge.

When Fridius had ended, Navarinus with no less affection to the beauteous
Mantuina, but with more modesty stood forth to plead his cause, and said; that
although he could not deny but by reason of his necessity, he had suited his
mind to his ability, yet he held himself as deserving as his adversary, for
'twas not wealth as he said, but virtue that renders a man truly noble, which
consisted more in tempering of ambition, then violently aiming at honors,
since smiling prosperity was but the act of fortune, and a forced
satisfaction, the true mark of fortitude; nor did his moderation, as he said,
hinder the acceptance of preferment when conveniently it may be had but taught
him the better how to use it when it was obtained; for that man must needs be
more happy that can content himself with any thing, then he that could be
satisfied with no thing. Courage, said he, never shows it self better, then
in over-comming ones own passions, nor is personal poverty a derogation, when
it is not accompanied with a supine neglect, or a wilful guilt, but rather a
magnanimity, when it can be borne with patience. A Diamond loses not it is
esteem for being set in Horn, or the Sun his influence because often obscured
by accidental Clouds. A King is a King, said he, although he do not always
wear the Crown; and for the fair Mantuina, he alleged was likelier to
command his affections with felicity that sought a unity in the lowest course
of life, rather then his rivalls who could be in love with none, and he that is
prepared to encounter with adversity, knows best how to use prosperity:
however, said he, it is a higher act of glory to refuse honor, then to enjoy
it; and for these reasons he claimed the prerogative in his Plea, and
consequently the beauteous Bride for his reward.

After that Cassianus had considered the Arguments, and natures of the lovers,
he briefly delivered his judgment in these words, not willing too long to
protract the designed Nuptials: Fridius, he said, had showed more ambition,
Navarinus the greater temper; the one might obtain the higher honor, but the
other the longer security; glory seemed to attend the actions of Fridius,
content the humility of Navarinus; the one promised more hope, the other less
fear; the one was endued with a Princes soul, which of necessity must put
him on to dangerous and hazardable attempts, the other more resembling a Lover
was likeliest to continue the unity of affections without separation; Fridius
was fitter to be a Monarch, but Navarinus to become a Husband; wherefore he
judged the beauteous Mantuina to the latter for a Wife, and the Crown she
carried in her hand to the former as a Conqueror, which extremely pleased the
whole Assembly, only discontented Fridius could not be persuaded to assist at
the intended Ceremony; alleging, that since he had lost his Bride in Venus
quarrel, he would endeavor to r^gaine his reputation in Mars's profession;
and presently took his leave of the Company, to put his intention into
execution, with the general dislike of them all, having before the
arbritration saithfully promised the contrary.

But however, this abrupt department of Fridius displeased the joyful troop,
yet they resolved to prosecute their intentions, and to that purpose instantly
rose from their seats, and in an orderly procession directed their course
toward Hymen's Temple, not far off, built of white Marble, enclosed within a
Cypres Grove, where the Priest attended to perform his Office, clothed in a
saffron Robe; who taking lovely Mantuina by the hand, after having a little
instructed her concerning her duty, he led her to the high Altar, where she
was solemnly espoused to joyful Navarinus, whilst in the mean time the roses
of her fair Cheeks seemed to get the absolute victory over the pure Jvorie
of her face; which being finished, the rest of the day was spent in such
entertainments as were fit for the season, where the Muses seemed to have a
principal prerogative.

But Cassianus not long contented with those sports, since he was in a manner
weary of himself, soon retired into a solitary walk within the Woods,
hoping to enjoy in contemplation some part of those pleasures that the two
Lovers expected; where he had not remained scarce a quarter of an hour,
crossing his arms, and often casting up his sorrowful eyes to heaven, as if
from thence he only attended relief, but he was interrupted by the old Priest
with this salutation, who belike had noted some storms in his countenance.

Sir, said he, finding your post^re no way suitable with the time, and my
profession also being retired from those exercises, I thought it not altogether
preposterous to attempt your patience, to see if my conversation might give you
any satisfaction.

Cassianus seeing himself saluted in this manner by the reverend Priest, was
not only forced to leave his sad contemplation, but returned him this
courteous answer: Truly Father, said he, as my years might pretend very well
to the delights of youthful company, yet being so happy as to enjoy yours, I
shall think I have changed much for the better, since I may gain double, both
by instruction and example.

That said the Priest, will be according to the impressions you are inclinable
to receive, and the ability of me that should inform; but as for the first, as
I cannot any way doubt, since your capacity has been sufficiently demonstrated
in your judgment upon the late controvesie; so of the other side, concerning
the latter, I may make some question, whether you are not more able to teach
then be instructed by my discourse: however, it being my practice and office to
speak to the erring world, of their obligation to their Creator, I shall apply
my self willingly to that subject upon any occasion you shall give.

Of which number said Cassianus I desire to be one, if you can think your
words will not be lost upon so ignorant a person as my self, since many will
not be persuaded, that either there is a God at all, or that that Divine Power
has any regard of man, for that he suffers often times intolerable injustices
to prosper without punishment.

Sir, said the Priest, as I will not dispute the tolerated evils, since the
mystery is locked up in his secret bosom from our mortal eyes; besides that
our own indulgence to our proper concernments, often blinds our understanding,
that we discern not what is right: So of the contrary, it is more apparent
then the light that there is a God, Maker and Ruler of all things, besides
nature; since the Sun, Moon, and Stars, with the hugeness and
extraordinary effects of them all, governed in an orderly course without
confusion, plainly show an infinite Power, and supernatural Providence: for
else, how could the Ocean be kept so constantly within its own bounds, as if
over-awed to obey, when it is apparent that millions of Rivers, for many
hundreds of years, have and do continually run into the Sea, without any
increase at all; which according to the course of nature, must have long since
buried the whole earth in a waterie tomb, to the absolute destruction of all
living things; besides, innumerable other examples to confound the stupiditie
of that doubt.

I grant, said Cassianus, a supreme Maker, Providence, and an infinite Power,
that first created, and now regulates the disorderly rage, or growing increase
of natural things, which else of necessity, must at last multiply, to almost
an infinite mass, not to be contained within the worlds compass; but whether
this immense essence employ it self in so low a consideration, as to think
upon us and our affairs must rest a question.

Why not said the Priest? when it is most certain, and by you confessed in
general terms, that the least grass of the field cannot flourish, dye, and
spring again in it is due season, without the assignement of this Power and
Providence, since it is not within the capacity of all the Monarchs of the
earth, to add growth of the breadth of one single hair to the stature of any
Dwarf, or within the skill of all the Philosophy in the world, to make a
flower without Earth and the Sun, that give it natural being; much more, if
this goodness afford such favor to senseless things, giving them life and
luster, will have a greater care of man created in so high an excellency,
since all other things are but merely ordained for his use and subsistence.

No doubt Father, said Cassianus, but he has an eye upon the preservation of
mankind, (...) especially then other Creatures, since he is endued with
understanding in some sort to know his Creator; but however it is not
necessary, that that knowledge proceeds from something that is immortal and
eternal.

From whence then, said the Priest, does this science of knowing God come?
either it must be in the body or in the soul; in the body certainly it is
not, since most Creatures are furnished with greater excellencies of sense;
therefore it must be in the soul that has a different faculty, which makes
man capable of discourse that a beast is not, because it lacks the use of
reason to distinguish; for fowls as we see by experience do not want organs
to utter words; witness Parrats and other Creatures, who by custom only are
taught to speak, although they themselves know not what they say, or can
answer reasonably to any question demanded them.

I confess, said Cassianus, that man's sou^e (...) only capable of
understanding, since it does alone judge reasonably of things; but whether this
soul be mortal or no is the doubt, since his Creator may have given him that
privilege in this life, and yet not eternity hereafter.

Certainly, said the Priest, as it might seem (...) impertinencie in God to
have created in (...) reasonable soul to be perpetually extinguished after a
time, having made the world and all things in it merely for his use; so of the
other side, it had been an apparent injustice, to have afforded the Subjects
greater privilege and happiness then their Lord, which by consequence must
follow, if man had not some prerogative to expect in the other life, enjoying
less felicity in this; for it is most apparent, man only takes no constant
content here, his mind being still full of perturbations, having always a
kind of longing in himself, to have that which he has not, and a
wearisomnesse of what he possesses, let his condition be never so seeming
prosperous; whereas all other Creatures are never perplexed with the fear of
change, or desire of alteration; so that of necessity man must except
something to countervaile the miserableness of his condition, since it is his
mere knowledge that renders him unfortunate, and the want of it makes Beasts
happy.

Truly Father, said Cassianus, as I speak but others Arguments, and not my
own thoughts, so I cannot deny but your reasons have much confirmed my belief.

No, no, son, said the Priest, it is only a sensual stupidity that detaines
men from entering into so clear a consideration of the other world as they
ought, proceeding from their lazy and indulgent nature, that is glad to be
flattered either with hopes of living long, or repenting when they please,
which makes them frame arguments against reason and their own Consciences,
because they are unwilling to take pains, and loath to forgo the present
fruition: But if I may not be thought to trespass too much upon your patience,
I will repeat some plain verses against the alluring vanities of present
delights; and the rather, since the Muses are esteemed principal
entertainments amongst us in our pastoral recreations.

With all my heart, said Cassianus, with the addition of my best thanks for
your courtesy; which made the old Priest draw out of his pocket a Paper that
contained these lines.

What Is the profit of every past delight, but to enuite anew the appetite?
The best applause of men is as a feather, tossed to and fro by various weather;
Which some perhaps may catch; yet when it is got often proves so troublesome, it
pleases not.
The poor Hermit within his private Cell, though worldly accidents were all
the hell,
Enjoyes a life by much, more void of care then does the most-commanding
Monarch here.
The sensualist in his excess does find a kind of weariness it leaves behind;
For all that we can see, or do, or taste, though they content a while, glut
us at last;
Or in their own defects do often perish, before they give us time their
sweets to relish.
Nature her self cannot endure to be confined unto a rule of certainty;
As in her choysest beauties here she is seen to vary often her show, not
always green;
The heart of man is angular, the earth being round, must not afford a constant
birth
Of such delights, to fill each little crook, but with a longing aim 'twill
farther look:
The Soul can only penetrate the sky, and truly contemplate the Deity;
In which will be possessed a silent mirth that cannot be expressed by Pens on
earth,
So free, so sweet, so full, so wondrous high, and most of all crowned with
eternity.
When the Priest had read these verses, and was preparing himself for another
discourse, the better to fortify his reasons, the ancient Forrester with many
of the joviall company, suddenly interrupted his intention, pretending the
season was neither fit for melancholy or retirement, and earnestly desired
Cassianus that he would honor the Lovers with his presence, as he said, at a
small Banquet, accommodated for the solemnization of the Feast, which however
it gave the Prince some discontent for the present, so to be hindered from a
conversation he more delighted in, in regard of his sad thoughts, yet he could
do no less then comply readily with the request, it being so civilly
intended; and so went with the Forrester to taste of those dainties prepared
for the Nuptials, which entertained them until night: nevertheless, the
communication began to take such deep root in the disturbed bosom of
Cassianus, that he was not only determined for a time to put off his
resolution of changing his habit, whereby the more commodiously to return into
Lydia undiscovered, to solicit his love under another form, to the fair
Princess Cloria, but also felt inclinations in his soul to leave the world,
since so many hazards and vexations depended upon the prosecutions of humane
designs; and in this posture of uncertain opinion, he continued many days,
still conversing upon all occasions with the holy Priest, though his variable
fancies could not bring forth any stable resolution. But the Forrester having
absolutely finished all the Nuptial Ceremonies, and every one of the company
being again settled in their several vocations, he invited Cassianus one day
into the Woods, to delight himself with the entertainments of hunting:
however, the Dogs being at a fault, and Cassianus desiring to know something
more particularly of his fortune; the Forrester under a shadie Oak began this
discourse for his satisfaction, after he made some apology for the
circumstance of a story he was to relate; As it shall not be needful, said he,
to let you know my name, for that I desire to have that concealed, since
otherwise my Enemies might have opportunity again to disturb me in my quiet
rest which I have endeavored to enjoy under this simple disgnize; so of the
other side it is most necessary that I tell you I am Noble man of Syria,
(because from thence arises the cause of my unjust banishment) where the King
now reigning called Orsames, was left an infant by his dead father, under the
protection of his mother named Anaxia, and so remained until the laws of the
Kingdom gave him the full power of the government into his own hands, which
notwithstanding the high-spirited Queen, with a certain Favorite she had,
not bearing with any patience, was forcibly confined to he^ Chamber, whilst
her servant lost his life in the resistance. Thus she continued her
imprisonment until the Kings duty, and the policy of one Philostros, that
belonged unto the Queen, procured her agiane her liberty: But Anaxia not yet
content with this privilege of being released, began to cast about in her
active mind, how she might be also interessed as formerly in State Affairs,
and to that purpose employed Philostros, as a crafty Instrument to compass her
desire; who in a short time so well played his Cards, although for his own
advantage, that he not only became an intimate Councellor to the King, but put
his own Mistress clean out of favor with her Son, whereby he might have the
better opportunity to manage all Court businesses himself, since he knew she
could not but obscure, or at least interrupt his greatness, with the absolute
power he intended. The Queen whose courage could not easily be suppressed, as
her wit was not to be limited, began publicly to cast all her affection upon
her second Son Orestes, in requital as she thought of the Kings disrespect to
her person, the only heir apparent to the Crown, since Orsames his brother
had no issue at all, and to that purpose not only gave him free liberty, but
powerful assistance in his love and courtships he had long pretended to a
young Lady though a stranger of great birth under her protection, called
Alciana, whereby he might be rendered more powerful to oppose Philostros
proceedings, as well in the ample kindred of the Lady, as in the hope he should
give the Kingdom of a plentiful posterity by her: but the subtle favorite
not alone apprehending the growing danger to his Master by the foresaid
greatness of his brother, since all men's eyes were cast upon him as the
unquestionable Successor, Orsames not being like to have children, but willing
also to exercise his spite against the Queens plots out of ambition not to be
outwitted by a woman, possessed the King privately with a jealous opinion of the
dangerous consequence of such a conjunction, himself being without issue,
since the people would be more apt as he said, to look upon his brothers
established house, then his own present government: When as long as he was
unmarried the eyes of the multitude would be diverted to other confused objects
of pretenders, not absolutely settled upon any one: And this was sufficient with
the addition of Philostros counsel, no less then an Oracle in the belief of
Orsames, to cause him to send for his brother, and taking him aside into a
private gallery, began to expostulate with him in this manner.

Orestes, said he, I know you cannot be so ill natured, as to forget the
affection I have always borne you as a brother, nor do I believe the world is
not sufficiently persuaded of the care I have of you as your Prince, which two
ties must draw from me both for your good and my safety, rather a discreet
admonition, then a commanding injunction, since my desire is it should be so
interpreted and executed by you: know then, that I understand, there is a
private affection growing, if not already gone too far, between you and
Alciana, a match I conceive neither convenient for your state, or the welfare
of Syria, since you are not only a great Kings son borne, but likely to be
inheritor of my Crown and Dignity, which also would distaste the whole
Kingdom, when your thoughts should be persuaded, rather to make election of a
stranger then one of your own Country, since there are so many beyond her,
worth your regard: but to avoid further expostulation, and to make trial of
your obedience, it being the laws of Syria, that the next heir should not
marry without the consent of the Prince, that you presently lay down your
affections, and entertain no new ones without my privity. This I conjure you
to perform, both out of the love you ought to bear me as a brother, and the
reverence you owe me as a Prince, without examining further my reasons, if you
mean to enjoy my smiles, and not undergo the heavy weight of my indignation,
and left him also at the same instant in a Sea of confusion, to converse only
with his unruly imaginations, which continued Orestes for some time, as it were
frozen in his despair until having sufficiently tired himself with
diversities of fancies, sometimes complaining against his brothers cruelty, and
otherwhile cursing Philostros policy, at last resolved to carry the news to
his almost lost Mistress; where, after he had with many sighs and more tears
laid open the Tyrannical sentence of the King, as he called it, they both cast
their pitiful looks at one another, as if they meant to blame themselves for
the misfortune which for the present parted them, like two that went to their
graves, never more to enjoy the comfort of each others conversation: But
Orestes not being long able to bear the torment of this rigid injunction, flew
to Anaxias affection for a redress; whom as he conceived, wanted neither power
nor will to assist him in his extremity, and she as quickly with compassion
carried his complaints to Orsames, fortified with all the reasons the
prerogative of a mother could use, however the absolute power of Philostros
beat down with violence her diligent endeavors, pretending the safety of the
King, and the prosperity of Syria, was to be preferred either before a brothers
foolish passions, or a mothers preposterous desires, which only left the
enraged Queen to mutiny against her sons seeming disobedience, finding how
much her own power was lessened, by the growing greatness of him she had
preferred to maintain it. But notwithstanding Orsames consent could not be
won to the continued loves of the young Couple, yet Orestes by the help of
his witty and indulgent mother, not only was encouraged still to prosecute his
settled affection to Alciana, but procured means oftentimes to meet his
Mistress secretly in a garden belonging to the Queens Lodgings; where their
passions caused them for the most part to burst forth into these expressions: O
Alciana said Orestes, how unjust are the Gods to debar us from that
conversation that lovers of meanest condition enjoy with abundant liberty? how
happy should we esteem our selves to be said he, if the open Fields were made
privy to our virtuous intentions, and the innocent birds called as witnesses to
our frequent vows to sing Epithalamions to our marriage Feasts? O the unhappy
state of Crowns so much covered, and yet brings with it consuming fires of all
content kindled by the raging flames of restless suspicion, the destruction of
friendship and charity. How fortunate should we be dear Al^iana said he, if a
poor Cottage were the present habitation for our persons, and a course bed the
resting place for our loves, rather then be thus fettered with the golden bands
of vain Titles (falsely called privileges) that imprison us from our chief
delights, and only happinesses? Then the fair Alciana with tears instead of
expressions, would oftentimes signify her approbation of his reasons; and then
again break forth into these passions of wishing her self rather a
Shepherdess then a Princess, so she might freely possess her beloved
Orestes, accusing, Cupid for want of power or pity, to let them suffer so
undeservedly, also complaining bitterly against the remorselesse rules of State
and policy, that imposed such thraldom upon lovers against divine and humane
laws, then returned to a fresh cariere of weeping, as if she meant to send up
her grief to heaven by water to procure redress, though almost in the same
moment she cast do^^e her eyes and hands, as if despair had beaten back her
prayers from thence when she considered the power of their adversaries: after
all she continued in a sad silence, until more then hopes of the Queens
assistance transported both their thoughts again to be confident of fruition
without danger or inconvenience. And thus these two mournful, though sometimes
comforted lovers, would often spinne out the tedious hours of the night
without rest, much less sleep, till Phoebus himself was forced to give them
warning to depart, who like valiant champions made good the field until the
uttermost minute, notwithstanding their careful servants diverse times sounded
the retreat for fear of a surprise.

But however they endeavored in this manner, to enjoy some part of their
loves, like people in a barren Country, that beheld a far off a fruitful
Island, and could not get to it, by reason of the interposition of the Sea,
though some thing delighted with the sight only, yet crafty Philostros that
had always his eyes open to those designs he had a mind to compass, quickly
became informed of their nightly meetings, and almost as soon carried the
discovery to his Masters intelligence; wherein he alleged, that the Queen her
self was the principal instrument, that procured the young Couple such
frequent opportunities, and therefore with more care and violence as he said to
be prevented, so that an Act presently past in the Council, to have the Lady
sent home to her own friends, whereby she might be absolutely separated from
Orestes courtships. Which suddenly being put in execution, it was a question
whether amazement or despair played the greater part in the lovers bosoms;
however, the Queen retaining yet her ancient courage, not only sharply
expostulated the business with the King her Son; but when she saw she could
not prevail by any persuasion, gave private Counsel and permission to Oreste^
to leave the Court, whereby to prosecute his marriage with his Mistress
Alciana in her own Country: This you may believe he wanted not diligence to
execute, when the authority of a mother complied with his own violent desires;
so that secretly stealing to the Castle of Alciana; he instantly gave
intelligence of the approaching Nuptials, by the invitation of all the Princes
of her kindred, to assemble at an appointed day, to be Noble witnesses of the
joyful Triumphs intended.

But Philostros, finding himself likely to be outstript by a woman's wit, began
to conjure up all the spirits of his politic brain for prevention, and fell
upon an attempt to corrupt a certain intimate Favorite belonging to Orestes,
not only with the promise of a great Dukedom in the Country of Syria, but
also to bestow upon him a rich Heir in Marriage, the better to maintain the
Title; These glorious baits I say so far prevailed in the Favorites ambitious
and false nature, that he was content to sell his Master to buy the purchase;
so that the two Lovers more open to Love then watchfall of Treason, the night
before the intended Ceremonies should have been performed being privately at
their devotions in Venus Temple, according to the prescribed custom, they were
both separate from one another by a selected, company of Soldiers, sent to
that purpose by Philostro^, which suddenly carried Orestes from the sad sight
of his most dearly beloved Alciana, who had only opportunity left her to
bewail her misfortune, whilst her betrothed husband in the interim, was
conveyed into a strong Fort, to be safely guarded until the Kings pleasure
should be known, concerning the disposure of his person; however his unworthy
Favorite paid the deserved debt due to such a Treason, for although Philostros
performed with him punctually the agreement, in giving him both the Dukedom
and the heir, yet the very day of his Nuptials, he caused him to lose his
head for his reward.

Nevertheless poor Orestes neither received liberty from his imprisonment, or
easement of his grief, which caused him for the most part to sit with his
arms cross, looking up at the heavens, as if he accused them for his
sufferings; And his strained passions sometimes would violently burst forth
into imprecations both against his brother and Philostros; calling Orsames
Tyrant^ and his Favorite the Center of deceit; from whose wickednesses as he
fancied, proceeded streams of disturbances, that drowned the whole world in
confusion. Such discontented language did his distempers break forth; which
however rather tired himself, then wounded his enemies; whilst in the mean
time, Philostros played with him like a huge Fish entangled with an angle, too
great suddenly to pull out of the water; letting him by degrees work himself
out of breath, that at last he might deal with him according to his pleasure;
since there is no better remedy against violent contention, then not to seem
to strive with it, which renders it like an enlarged flame less furious: Even
so it fared with this Prince, that having tired himself by his overmuch
passion, seemingly at last came to so underhand a patience, that he appeared
fitted for those impressions, which Philostros had a mind he should seal; and
to that purpose employed one Dion an ancient Noble man of Syria, entrusted
formerly by Oreste; father in many weighty employments, to persuade him to
pass such Acts, as his policy thought most convenient for Orsames security,
which was publicly to disavow that private contract, made between him and
Alciana, since the opinion every one had of that marriage, gave not only hopes
of a new posterity, but a certainty also of assistance by her kindred upon all
occasions.

Wherefore one day this Dion watching the time when Orestes was in his best
temper, and his thoughts appearing most calmed from extravagancies, entered into
his Chamber with such a humility, as became the distances of their persons; And
after a while spent in diverse discourses, the better to disguise his
intentions, he began with him in this manner.

My Lord, said he, as it was my happiness, during the life of your admired
Father, to be not only witness of his glorious actions, but as a Servant to
his commands, spent my youthful years in the advancement of his fame; whereby
he became loved at home, and feared abroad, and that settled this mighty
Monarchy of Syria, before almost torn in pieces by domesticke factions, in the
high State of felicity and honor, he left it to your virtuous brother, though
an infant under the protection of your mother; who enjoyed the Tuition, as long
as the laws of the Kingdom would give her leave to govern; however it has
not pleased the Gods as yet to bless him with posterity; so that by all
probability the succession is like to fall upon you, if your own actions do
not divert and change the minds of those people you are to rule, either by
discontenting your brother, in that obedience you ow him as your Prince, or by
giving the Subjects an opinion, you rather aim passionately at your own
private pleasures, then their future good, in ch^sing a wife of a strange
Country, when you may have so many at home, as if you disdained the election
merely because you were out of love with your own Country; especially when you
know the laws of Syria absolutely forbid, the heir apparent to take a
Consort, without the approbation of the King, which entirely absolves you from
that contract between you and Alciana, for which only act you are now detained
in prison, not only to your own discontent, but to your brothers displeasure,
since he is about new Councels, how he may settle the succession upon other
pretenders, for that your stubbornness seems to render you incapable of the
Empire. Perhaps you will allege that the rules of Religion, command you
inviolably to observe the sacred promise of marriage, accorded between you two
before the face of heaven; unto which I must answer, that all compacts made in
the prejudice of an others right, are altogether to be esteemed invalid, of no
force; and not to be persisted in without a double offense, the one to the
party injured, and the other toward the Gods, who have expressly enjoined the
contrary; so that if at first you did commit a sin of disobedience to your
brothers will; by attempting to take a wife without his consent, contrary to
the known ordinances of Syria; let at last your sudden repentance extenuate
the offense, whereby you may be reconciled both to heaven and earth; lest the
justice of the one and the vengeance of the other overtake you. Again, whereas
you may think, that the perfections of Alciana are not to be paralleld, (which
however is no sufficient plea to render you obstinate) I answer, that
oftentimes our fancy out-does our judgment, which makes that become excellent
in our sight, that we have only brought our mind by some accident
passionately to desire; and therefore will lay before y^^ this consideration as
a re^^ting example, whe^^ you can possibly believe with a clear apprehen^ion,
that the small circle of Alciana's body, can contain so much beauty, as the
large extent of all Syria? in which compass you may be your own Carver, with
envious contention, who may be the happy object of your choice: With these
words he ended his discourse, expecting his reply with a respectfull silence;
which presently brought forth many considerations in Orestes troubled bosom,
and after some time these expressions.

Must the sacred Laws, by which our souls are united in one before the Throne
of Heaven, be thus abrogated by humane power? shall Policy triumph over
Religion? and Kings exalt themselves above the Gods, not fearing to contend
against their decrees? must Philostros wisdom be esteemed above Hymen's Rights?
can pitiless man behold the perfections of divine Alciana, and not melt into
compassion? All which he uttered with other extravagancies of the like nature,
which gave Dion a desire to take his leave for the present, hoping another time
to find him in a more moderate temper. But Orestes perceiving his intention,
and reflecting in some sort upon the gravitie of the person that gave him the
advice; of a sudden took him by the hand, telling him it was not kindly done
to leave him in his extreamities; since there was a hope, as he said, after a
little consideration, he might be wrought to credit any persuasion that
intended for his good, and would be the prosperity of Syria: This gave Dion so
much ^^tisfaction, that he not only staid with him for ^^e instant,
endeavoring to fortify his reasons with new arguments, but in a short while
plying him continually with importunate solicitation, at last procured his
absolute promise, to perform what acts his Brother should command him to the
disanulling of the former contract between him and Alciana. When Dion had
gained thus much upon the Princes inconstancy, with this joyful conceived
news, he went to congratulate the itching ears of the great favorite, that
from time to time expected the issue, who esteemed it a most supreme dishonor
to have any of his plots fail in their success; and to this purpose a day was
appointed soon after for a public Assembly, who were to be witnesses to the
whole Kingdom of Orestes intentions, to the content of many, but wonder of
all, since the example was esteemed extraordinary, as the persons were
eminent, which gave Orestes liberty to take his recreations where he pleased;
so that one time walking under a row of orderly set Trees in a Park belonging
to his Lodgings, being accompanied only with his now more quieted thoughts,
since his love Alciana began to be blotted out of his memory, by new
considerations that entertained him, he was saluted by a youth, whose face
appeared beautiful, as his looks innocent; only a large patch upon the side
of his cheek, with his hair carelessely covering a great part of his
forehead, rendered him by much less lovely, then nature seemed to have
intended him; however, his eyes sparkled a kind of perfection, that gave an
admirable luster to the rest of his obscured countenance, which again was
augmented by the rubie of his lips. Orestes taken with the delight of the
object, could not be but curious of the business, therefore with more
attention he gave ear to his words; and the rather for that the boy told him,
he had not only a message, but a request to present unto him, if his patience
or charity would give him the hearing, and with that wept, as if a sad Story
were the subject of his discourse. But after he had a little dried his fair
eyes with a handkirchieffe he carelessely held it in his hand, he told him his
name was Phalarius, an unfortunate Cousin of Alciana, since her late retirement
into a Cloister, had left him to the world to seek entertainment in his
service after having been robbed and wounded by certain Thieves. Orestes
hearing the name of his almost forgotten Alciana, seemed suddenly stricken with
some fatal Omen that accused him of perjurie and ingratitude, for which
deservedly he merited to be punished; wherefore he seated himself upon a bench
in those walks, with his arms folded one within another, as if he meant to
weave his thoughts an intricate labyrinth of discontent, his eyes being cast up
to Heaven, as it were to penetrate the very bosom of the Gods, to be informed
of the depth of his offense; Thus he continued glasing his sight all the while
with the troubled water of his sorrowful tears, until the youth himself
with the sadness of his contemplation, could not choose but accompany his
passion with a few distilled drops of Cristall from his own beautiful eyes,
and withal by way of interruption told him, that although he intended his
preferment in his suite, yet he was not so unmannerly, as to procure his
vexation thereby; but rather if he thought his unworthy service, might prove
any inconvenience to his more glorious employments, he would most willing
notwithstanding his kinswomans kind recommendation (whom he conceived had had
some interest in his breast) desist from further prosecuting his intention, how
profitable soever it might prove to his unfortunate condition. O uncharitable
Phalarius, replied Orestes, be not so unjust as to misconster my present
passion, or to entertain the least sinister opinion in thy yet innocent
bosom, that any desire, from the fair Alciana can be less commanding to my
grieved soul, then as a decree enjoined me by the powerful Heavens, which
must not be disobeyed; no gentle boy, said he, I do not only entertain thee,
but constitute thee my dear and only Companion to talk nothing but Alciana,
to liken every flower we can find in our soft conversation to the several
perfections of beauteous Alciana; and when we have discoursed whole Summer
days upon that delightful theme, thou shall gather them together in a gay
nosegay, and carry them to my Love, as emblemes of her perfections and my
constancy, informing her of all the sad postures poor Orestes undergoes for
the absence of his dear Alciana; nay, more assure her, that the Sun shall
sooner lose his light, then he the bright remembrance of that beauty, which
only captivates his heart, for death by the force of spightfull Tyranny may
well separate our mortal bodies, but our pure souls shall ever live together
united in the heavens, triumphing over all humane injuries and violence.

But Phalarius having obtained as he thought, what he came for, would not
expostulate more with him the reasons of his passion; only he desired to know
if he had a desire to entertain him according to Alciana's request, whether it
was not necessary to acco^modate himself otherwise for his service, since he
had some friends not far off that he was assured would assist him to that
purpose? No already dear Phalarius, replied Orestes, the commands of sweet
Alciana work not upon so dull a Subject, as to admit of the least protraction;
besides, thou must, said he, be a speedy and active messenger to divert her
thoughts from that killing resolution of retirement, and by that means release
Orestes from a world of torments, which he should suffer in being perpetually
banished from the sweet conversation of his most dear Love: With this taking
the Boy by the white hand, he led him into his own Lodgings, enforming every
one that he was a near Kinsman to the Princess Alciana, his passion not being
able to hide that which his discretion should have concealed, since his enemies
wanted not suspicion to keep over him still watchful spies to observe his
actions, knowing his determinations to be variable, as his nature was violent;
In conclusion he made the dainty Ganymed not only his daily play-fellow, but
his night companion; which two seasons for the most part were spent ia
discourses concerning Alciana; But the time approaching for his public
negation of the contract between him and Alciana, Dion again was sent by
Philostros to p^t him in mind both of the hour and the circumstances;
whereupon Orestes, contrary to his expectation, like an enraged Lion, fell
upon him with this language.

Thou wicked man, said he, do thou believe the Gods will suffer thee to go
unpunished for this attempt? must the sacred Laws by which the two souls of
Alciana and my self are united in one before the Throne of Heaven, be
abrogated by humane power, as I formerly told thee? can that Devil Philostros,
whose only spirit thou art, retain in his uncompassionate breast, still
constant intentions of this impiety? or will my unnatural Brother for ever
punish me, and protect his malicious favorite without end, against right and
reason? Is all Religion absolutely banished from every humane heart, and nothing
succeds but unconscionable interest and cruelty? cannot the benefits of my
dead Father, or the sufferings of my dead Mother at all work thy nature to any
pity? and banish from thy pernicious thoughts, those malicious treasons thou
intendest against love and goodness? wherefore I say, get thee out of my
sight, or by the Gods I will make thee a quick sacrifice to the infernal
furies.

Dion had no need of any Counsel at the present to avoid these extravagant
intemperances; however, with respect enough he took his leave, since his
wisdom thought it better to temper his passion, the provoke his choler; and
yet instantly he carried the news to Philostros, with the addition also of his
opinion; that certainly it was the frequent conversation of the newly
entertained Kinsman to Alciana, that altered the resolution of Orestes.
Philostros considering this strange and sudden change, could not choose but be
of the same belief, and therefore called a Council of his own private
friends, wherein after some consultation, with the approbation of the King,
command was given to an Officer of the Court, with a strong guard to repair
the next morning to the Princes Lodgings, there by force to separate him from
his young Favorite, and then to convey his person to some place of less
liberty, where again he might be treated withal about his former promise; a
judgment given as might be thought against all morality and pity; but the
support of a Crown will not be regulated by any compassion; tears being only
fit for the condition of a penitent, no way becoming the dignity of an
unthroned King, whose dazeling glory must not behold the dark misfortune of
any other condition. This resolution, I say, was put in execution with all
expedition and vigor; for the Captain of the guard, a man of a rough nature,
having received his commission, at the time appointed went up into the chamber
of Orestes, and finding him a bed, though his diligent servant Phalarius was
newly risen from the warm sides of his dear Master, where he had reposed the
night past; The Officer in a cold complement showed him the strict commission
of the King his brother, desiring him without resistance or delay he would
prepare himself to an absolute obedience, which else might turn to his greater
prejudice. But Orestes, not taken with a dejected sorrow, though he too much
apprehended the injury, presently flew out of his bed, like some furious wild
beast, that feared to be deprived of that prey, which his own hunger had lately
procuced; and so seized upon his naked Sword that lay near him on the Table,
vowing to make that weapon the instrument of his just revenge, if he laid the
least finger upon his dear Phalarius, with intention to separate him from his
sight and conversation. The Captain, whose providence had before placed the
guard at the stairs foot, to be ready at his command if there were occasion,
suddenly called them to his assistance, who with all violence obeying the
injunction, in an instant encompassed Orestes about, neither regarding his
person, nor having respect to his naked condition, whilst in the mean time
poor Phalarius altogether distracted, between love and fear, flew with all
his power amongst the coufused weapons to defend Orestes by his own hazard,
from the threatening and appearing danger, where presently he received a cruel
wound in his tender sides, which soon discovered it self by his sudden sinking
to the ground, ready to pay his last duty to nature, as his best blood for a
ransom to redeem his Master from his captivity. But Orestes notwithstanding
was presently surprised, and led away out of his failing sight; which Phalarius
beholding, more bemoned then his own approaching destruction, blaming rather
the injustice of the merciless Guard for oppressing Orestes, then for killing
him.

Anaxia the Queen finding this extraordinary oppression of her son, and not
being admitted to his presence, to afford him any manner of relief or comfort
by her motherly conversation; as also conceiving her own person in some hazard,
by the example of such a violence, of a sudden making an escape from the Court,
put her self into the protection of Sorastros King of Egypt, whose Empire
seemed then to overtop the Syrian Monarchy; which engendered an ambitious enmity
between the two mighty Princes, that afterward broke out into an open war:
whilst in the mean time, Philostros having now Orestes at his absolute mercy,
in having given his brother Orsames too much suspicion by his late inconstancy,
endeavored again to make him subscribe to the divorcement of his pretended
love Alciana, as well to debar him from a foreign alliance, that should give
nourishment to any rebellion; as also to have the better convenience to furnish
him with some wife of his own choosing, whom as he thought he might direct in
the moderating of Orestes actions: Within a short time both these projects had
so good success, that Orestes did not only publicly disclaim from all
interest in his former match, but was content to be ruled by his brothers
pleasure, in the election of a new mistress; so that Philostros having by his
diligent policies brought about his purposes to this contented issue, seemed to
have the power of making the present for his choice, by reason of Orsames
favor, since the youthful Prince could not long be detained from entertaining
his thoughts with some Courtship or other; wherefore he resolved to design for
this service or Court stratagem, one of his own kindred, although he determined
not to be seen himself in the action; by which means he supposed he might
become not only the absolute master of them both, but have another interest in
the succession of the Crown, if Orsames should die without children; and the
fates seemed to favor his purpose, for at the same time there lived at the
Court a young Lady called Orbella, sisters daughter to Philostros, whose beauty
and estimation appeared in a manner to be paralels, for that her Uncles
authority did but give her the one, as liberal nature had bestowed upon her
the other; and both made way for the Princes Courtship, since, as he thought,
it was the duty of every youthful spirit, to make love when the occasion was
offered: so he believed his endeavor, placed upon such an interest, was a
subject could not but please Philostros in a high kind, who now began to become
his new master, for that his own inconstancy had made him forget his old
mistress. But however, witty Orbella, as well encouraged by her own excellent
parts, as counseled by her uncles admirable wisdom, received his addresses
rather with a civil carelessness, then by a passionate acceptance, showing in
all her entertainments, as she knew him to be the Kings brother, that commanded
from her a reverence due to his person, so she was in a manner certain of her
own virtues that obliged her to keep his love at a distance: however, to pluck
more eyes upon her self, she would daily adorn her natural handsomnesse with
some quaint fashion, which her authority soon made a pattern to other Ladies of
less estimation; by this means intending covertly the Prince might be more
delighted with her beauty and handsomeness; since variety is the most pleasing
object of humane sense; and the rather, when he should see every one admired
her perfections; As, I say, by these pretty cunnings Orestes at last became
absolutely in love, whereas his first thoughts perhaps were only to have a
Mistress to court, since it was esteemed the chief business of the place, to
exercise themselves with such employments.

And thus inconstant Orestes being again engaged in a new labyrinth, Orbella
played with his passions to her own commodity, according to her Uncles politic
directions; sometimes enticing his love to a stronger confirmation by a
multitude of invented oaths; and then again would bring him back into a kind
of despair by her seeming neglect of all his protestation, telling him
oftentimes in careless smiles of his late Mistress Alciana, who could not, as
she said, but claim some prerogative in his affection, since not long ago he
had showed such violence in her behalf, in so much as he was ready rather to
have lost his brother, and the whole Kingdom of Syria, then to be withdrawn
from the constancy of his profession. Besides, she not seldom let him know, she
could not be so foolish as not to judge of the difference between her self and
Alciana, by reason of which she had more cause to doubt a dangerous surprise in
his intention, then that he meant any way to make her the companion of his
thoughts, since he had already quitted one so far beyond her in worth; and
beauty. Whereupon Orestes would reply; that as the Moon appears fair, until
the Sun by his greater splendor darkens her light; so the beauties of
Alciana was in some esteem in his apprehension, until he beheld Orbellas most
admirable perfection, that obscured the others luster; And as diversity of
other stones, said he, seem rich at first sight to common beholders, not being
fully instructed in their value, so when the Diamond is produced by the
skillful Jeweller, with shame they are advertised of their own error: So was
it with me dear Orbella, said he, before I was acquainted with your
excellencies, which now make me distinguish of the others wants: But O^bella
had an intention to entangle him beyond disingagement, before he should receive
from her the least assurance of acceptance; To this purpose, one day when
Orestes came to visit her in her chamber, she not having stirred abroad, by
reason of some small distemper a cold had procured her, or at leastwise so
pretended by her cunning, in a reserved, though civil discourse; putting on a
more solemn countenance then ordinary, she told him that his addresses
appeared something scandalous to the eye of the World, as she was informed by
many of her best friends, whose admonitions she was bound to observe; and since
his quality and her condition could not suit together by way of marriage, she
desired he would demonstrate so much his regard toward her honor (which in
charity and religion, as she said, he was obliged unto) as altogether to
forbear her company, unless in those public assemblies that could not be
avoided^; this she assured him was the noblest part of affection, he could use
to a poor maid, whose reputation was her principallest dower, since she most
esteemed it.

Ore^es hearing such a request, so much against his expectation and liking,
told her, that as the Gods had set some disparity in their persons by the fond
opinion of the flattering world, yet that conceived distance was abundantly
supplied by the admirable perfections of her rich mind, in which she was to be
valued before the greatest Empress; however my Lord, said Orbella, dressing
her countenance with a deceiptfull smile, whereby the better to color her
intention, although I might flatter my thoughts with the seeming reality of
your professions, and by that means take all for granted, you say, yet
certainly the King your brother can never be brought to be of the same opinion,
without whose consent, you know, our loves will be to no purpose, since the
strict Laws of Syria deny you to be your own chooser. Again, said he, is this
unjust and tyrannical Law urged to my miserable disadvantage? No, Sir, said
she, it is neither tyrannical nor unjust, but was wisely ordained at the
first, to bridle the dangerous passions of such young Princes as your self,
that might else marry to the prejudice, if not overthrow of all Syria. I do
not believe, said Orestes, that there was ever made such a Law; or if there
were, I will have it blotted out to all posterity, since it not only proves an
obstacle to my love, but is against the very constitution of the Heavens. No,
no, my Lord, said she, you cannot; rather therefore endeavor to give your
brother satisfaction in your choice, who no doubt will provide better for your
honor then your self; leaving these vain professions, which I know proceed
but from the mouth of a youthful Courtier, that rather then want a subject to
work upon, would play with a feather, or take a babie for his Misteis; and with
that offered to retire into her private Cabinet, telling him she could not but
be jealous of her own modesty, in that she had been too long in private
discourse with him.

Orestes, although for the present he took his leave, yet being debarred, as he
conceived the freedom of ordinary addresses; however he noted always in
Orbella a carriage that rather wisely endeavored to avoid scandal, then
demonstrated disaffection to his person, since she knew how to play her Cards
to the best advantage; of a sudden through the whole Court divulged his violent
affection, swearing by all the Gods, he would die if he enjoyed not Orbella for
his wife; but this soon came to the ears of crafty Philostros, who having, as
he thought, absolutely entangled the wild beast he meant to take; one day he
drew Orestes aside in a certain room, not only near the Kings lodgings, but
where frequently he was accustomed to pass to such recreations as daily he
entertained himself withal, where he began to expostulate with him after
this manner.

My Lord, said he, as I have ever employed my best endeavors for your brothers
service, and I vow by the immortal God also for your good, thouph perhaps
otherwise interpreted by the false suggestions of others; so I beseech you,
since there has been lately an entire reconciliation between your self and
me, you will not seek under hand, not only to wound my honor, and destroy my
house, but absolutely to take from me my greatest happiness^, your brothers
favor, by pretending love so preposterously or deceitfully to my poor Niece
Orbella; for as I know she is altogether unworthy to be your wife, so of the
other side, I must confess, I shall ever esteem her to be too good to be your
Strumpet; therefore, I must entreat you, either to forbear your fantastical,
and not credited Courtships, or I shall be forced to discover my thoughts to
the King, who I hope will use his just authority to restrain you, as well as
satisfy me; and with that held his peace, earnestly looking him in the face,
as if the business required a speedy reply. But poor Ore^^es, thus unawares
surprised by the wise favorite, knew not what answer to make; yet at last
breaking out into many extravagant protestations, the King, according to his
use, came that way, as they were earnestly discoursing together, who finding
that rather passion spoke the language, then temper, would needs be informed of
the difference; by which means Orestes new love came to his knowledge, so
contrived of purpose by Philostros, that he might not appear himself to be
the author of his own design, supposing the issue would follow the intention,
since the greatest difficulty appeared in the discovery; for that probably
Orsames was easily to be persuaded, that it would seem too great a tyranny, to
deny his brother his youthful affection in both his elections: which
accordingly so succeeded, for Ore^tes violence so overprest his brother, with
the crafty instruments Philostros had set about the King, not appearing at all
visible in the business, that Orsames was not only soon won to his consent,
but a solemn day was appointed for the marriage Feast, to be performed with
most glorious Ceremonies, according to the dignity of such eminent Nuptials,
wherein the Kings heir, and the Favorites hopes, were to play their parts
upon the Stage of Syria, to the wonder of all Asia.

However, though seemingly these industrious preparations drew on toward the
joyful consummation, attended by the longing desires of the two Lovers, yet
the destinies had a hidden determination, to raise an obstacle against the
triumphs intended; for Prince Austratius, brother to the wronged Alciana, not
only provoked by his own dishonor, but exasperated by his sisters injuries,
with a mighty Army entered suddenly the Confines of Syria, vowing to interrupt
the joy, or revenge the injustice; and in that manner endeavored with the fire
of destruction, to light ominous torches to the bridal feast, which were only
to be extinguished with blood; so that of necessity, the marriage was to be
deferred, since the King in person was resolved to stop the torrent of this
threatening stream; besides, most of Alciana's kindred were assembled in the
enterprise, to accompany Austratius in his valiant design, conceiving
themselves also interessed in the quarrel; which in honor could not dispense
with Orestes absence (although love seemed to plead, by all the gentle laws of
that profession, his excuse) as also, from being a Commander in his brothers
Army. In this manner these two threatening forces approached each other; delay
seemed too passive a quality to be practiced in either of their intentions,
which soon brought them together to exercise their enraged spleenes; that
procured an encounter, no less horrid then courageous, since one side
contended revenge, shame, and valor, against oppression, policy, and power:
however, in conclusion, poor Austratiu^, having beheld the slaughter, in a
manner, of all his soldiers, in defense of his person, himself still fighting
for his sisters right, was taken prisoner by his enemies.

But notwithstanding this glorious victory, that seemed absolutely to cast the
fair Orbella into Orestes bosom, and he prepared with the open arms of his
imagination to embrace her; yet as he was at dinner one day in his tent,
encompassed about with multitudes of Nobility, he was suddenly saluted by a
dainty damsel, about the age of thirteen; who with a confident bashfulnesse
not only presented him a letter, but told him she had also a commission to
wish him to read it aloud; which if he refused, she would publish the contents
thereof, to his greater dishonor. Whereupon Orestes, with a disdainful smile,
to be so tutored by an innocent girl, although he could not but be a little
amazed at the adventure, in a kind of hasty passion broke open the seal, and
found the lines speak this language:

Orestes, let it suffice that the hand that wrote this Letter, pretends to as
high a prerogative in blood as thy self, though the name of the person be
unsubscribed for some reasons; however, it is sufficient thou art the Injurer,
and I am ordained to be the revenger, unless thy valor defend thee from the
punishment, by protecting thy self bravely against thy enemy; since I am an
ominous messenger sent by the heavens to call thee to an account concerning the
injuries of wronged Alciana, whose dying soul was by accident breathed into my
bosom, after she had made a large relation of her own sufferings, and thy
perjuries: Whereupon I vowed thy destruction, or my own; wherefore prepare thy
self to meet me the day after to morrow, ready armed, in the Island between
the Town and the Army, where there shall be no partiality in our weapons,
although cowardly thou may pretend it in our qualities; unless thou will
procure thy certain destruction by some other stratagem I shall invent, if thou
refuse this equal way of trial prescribed thee, to thy eternal infamy.

Farewell.

After that Orestes had read this strange and resolute Letter, in the presence
of all the Company, who wondered at the accident; some with jeering smiles, and
others with distracted looks, he retired into the innermost part of his Tents
with an intention to ask counsel of his troubled thoughts, what answer he
should make to the challenge, and feign he would have flattered himself with
reasons in the behalf of his approaching marriage, to have denied or avoided
the combat, being stung with the sharpness of the injury he had done to the
fair Alciana: but his honor, as he believed, called him to a more noble
resolution, especially since the summons was delivered him before the eyes of
all the brave spirits of Syria, who would have been glad of his least show of
want of courage, since their ambitions could not choose but envy the dignity of
his person, that so much out-shined theirs; wherefore, in a little space, he
came out from his secret chamber with this answer, that although the appearing
distance of their qualities might serve as a sufficient privilege to make him
deny what was so rashly demanded, yet his own eminent courage, as he said,
could not dispense with the reason; and therefore was determined to meet his
unknown enemy at the time appointed, where he made no doubt but to punish him
for his bold attempt; and so conducting the little Virgin some way out of the
bounds of his own lodgings, with order she should be safely guarded through the
Army, returned to make preparation for the appointed combat; where long he had
not remained, but the King came in person to chide his brother for undertaking
so desperate an attempt without his license; and withal laying his present
commands upon him, not to proceed further in the execution.

But these blasts were too weak to shake the settled resolutions of Orestes,
who chose rather to die, sighting with an unknown enemy, then live disgraced
among his intimate friends; so that, falling down upon his knees before his
brother, he desired him, either to suffer him to vindicate his own honor,
since he had undertaken the combat, or he himself would be the author of his
own destruction, to let the world see he was no coward; which at last forced
the King to give way to his passions, though Philostros was very sorry to
hazard his Neeces happiness in so doubtful a contention.

Although Orestes in heat of blood had consented, as I may say, rashly to fight
with one whose name was not so much as known, however he was supposed to be
some Prince of Alciana's kindred; yet being retired privately into his own
secret Cabinet, and the dead of the night raising fancies in his fearful
imagination, began to expostulate with himself after this manner.

Is it possible the Gods can suffer me to escape unpunished for those injuries I
have done to the more then wronged Alciana? much less can I hope for victory
in this unjust combat; can her sweet soul look down from the skies with any
eye of forgiveness, when she shall behold me shedding more blood of her Noble
Family? is it not sufficient that she already has made her self an innocent
sacrifice to redeem part of my wickedness; but I must with new slaughter
disquiet the rest she now deservedly enjoyes in the Heavens? O rather let me
die by mine own accursed hand, wherein I shall perform an act of justice, since
I am only he that has offended; then hazard the death of one who brings with
him as little guilt as the dead Alciana. No, no, I will not be a mortal enemy
to him that professes so absolute a friendship to my dear Love; but rather
confess my self twice overcome, both by his goodness and valor, so shall I
appear to the world more just, though less fortunate: And for Orbella, with
all her beauties and honors, I shall return again to her great Uncle, who can
give her not only protection, but dignity; Whilst I will again wed my self to
dead Alciana. These were the imaginations that entertained the thoughts of
Orestes, during the solitary season of the night, until the cheerful morning
not only gave his mind some courage, but brought into his chamber the gallant
Commanders of his brothers Army; who breathed nothing into his sad soul but
inflamed desire, and certain victory, that again something settled his
despairing thoughts: so that presently he gave order for his Arms; and whilst
he was beholding diverse of sundry sorts, Philostros, accompanied with many
Officers of the Court, desired to speak a word privately with him; and when all
were retired but they two, he told him it was his brothers pleasure, and his
own advice, that he proceeded no further in this combat, unless his adversary
would discover his name, since it was judged an indignity to the Crown of
Syria, for him to hazard his person against an obscure enemy; to which the
Prince hastily answered, withal his heart, so he would again receive the
protection of his Niece Orbella, and his brother suffer him to retire into some
obscure place, where he might continually bewail his injury done to the dead
Alciana. This answer you may be sure was a sufficient bridle to detain the
Counsels of Philostros from more persuading Orsames against the combat; since
the issue as he believed would either produce the glorious marriage of his
kinswoman, or the sudden and honorable death of Orestes, whereby he should be
secured by his friendship, or out of fear of his inconstancy.

The time being come for the meeting of the two Champions, Orestes was mounted
upon a pyde horse, which very lively represented either the changeableness of
his disposition, or the variableness of his fortune. His Armor was light
skie-colour, painted over with an artificial shade that was procured by the
Suns eclipse. His Caparisons were cut into the form of a beautiful Phoenix,
the Saddle forming the body as the two wings figured out the sides, which were
composed of several colored feathers, so that the crupper making the tail,
the whole bird seemed to fly as the horse moved, bearing the armed Knight in
the air; and the raines of the bridle being neatly contrived into the likeness
of flames, as it were kindled from the bit (contrived of material resembling
fire) seemed to aspire upwards with a consuming intention. In his shield was
painted a ship tossed upon a stormy Sea, only set forth with this Motto, Still
uncertain. But scarce had he entered the List, when at the other end appeared
his adversary in a white Armor, set forth with the story of Theseus and
Ariadne; the ornaments that covered his horse were made into the form of a
Cypres grove: for his device he bore the picture of Dido Queen of Carthage,
crowned with a Willow garland, without any Motto at all, but her name: six
seeming Virgins carried those staves he meant to employ in the encounter,
which not only gave a delectable, but also a sad aspect to the whole company,
since by the sight, both the innocence and injury of Alciana was described.

But Orestes being taken with a new apprehension far above the other
Spectators, before he began his course, in a soft trot rid toward his prepared
enemy; who contrariwise seeing him coming, not having any mind to entertain
his addresses, retired almost as fast back; but finding his importunity was not
so easily to be avoided, sent one of his little messengers to tell him, that If
his intention was to use words before the combat; he found not his disposition
any way inclinable for discourse; wherefore desired him with courage to speak
only the language of the Sword, which, of the two, was more proper for the
season. Orestes, having received this sharp reply, and being summoned by the
Trumpets to the encounter, quickly made his spurs teach his horse his duty, and
in the course carried himself with so much force and dexterity, that at the
first course he bore his adversary to the ground with the point of his Lance,
who had either unfortunately or unskilfully mist his rest; yet the Knight
appearing ashamed at the fall, presently started up, and with a kind of
flourishing bravery, drew out his Sword, telling him (though his much halting
showed his courage was better then his person,) that notwithstanding the Gods
flattered him with a seeming advantage, yet he should quickly find by the
sharpness of his weapon that his dissembling Fates did but smile him into
destruction; and although he were on horseback, and his self on foot, that
inequality should not defend him from the speedy punishment he merited,
according to the request of dying Alciana.

Truly, said Orestes, as I am extremely unwilling to entertain the quarrel
any further upon these terms; so of the other side, I could be very well
content to have laid down my own life as a ransom to have redeemed hers, by
much more innocent. O false man, said the Knight, do thou believe I can be
won by thy dissimulation to abstain from a just revenge, since thou had so
much cruelty to torment her for only loving thee; no traitor, said he, I hope
the Gods are more righteous then to suffer poor Alciana's wrongs to go
unpunished, and thy wicked self live prosperously, triumphing over her
destruction, which would be an example too pernicious, whereby the deceived
world might be encouraged to the like crimes? I confess my fault, said
Orestes, to the fair, virtuous, and injured Alciana, so the combat may be
left off bearing that title. Can thou think, said the Knight, thy
cowardlinesse shall buy off the deserved reward of thy villainies? be assured it
shall not upon any condition. Orestes, not being able longer to bear the
oppression of his words, hastily alighted from his horse (scorning a partiality
in honor) and soon made his Sword dispute the rest of the argument; choler
beginning to banish from his remembrance the wrongs of dead Alciana, though it
was a debt which his soul was bound to pay ever to her memory: This brought on
so sharp a contention on both sides for a pretty space, that the Spectators
entertained the prospect with some wonder, but more compassion; until the
rob^stious fury of Orestes arm, had made many passages in the Armor of the
strange Knight, for wounds, if not death it self to enter in at, that quickly
varnisht the outside with the crimson tincture of his own blood, to the sorrow
of all the beholders; however they wished Orestes victory, yet they could not
desire the others slaughter. Which the Prince also perceiving, desired him not
obstinately to continue his own enemy, when his seeming adversary so much
coveted his good; especially, as he said, since the quarrel was not personal,
but accidental, containing an others right, who could not be satisfied in the
conquest; and with that courteously retired, with an intention to give him not
only breath, but redemption: yet had he scarce spoke the words, but the Knight
with overmuch bleeding fell down in a sound; which caused Orestes to fly to
him with the wings of pity: wherefore pulling off his Helmet, to give him some
refreshing air, he suddenly discovered the countenance of his once dearly
beloved servant Phalarius, thought formerly to be slain in his defense: Truly,
this was a sight so much beyond his expectation, that he stood like one wholly
converted into the dead image of sorrow, being confounded so entirely with
amazed grief, that it took from him all effects of compassion, not stirring
from the place where he stood, but with his eyes only, to give redress to
that misfortune, which his unwilling hands had occasioned; and therefore
suffered the poor youth to lie still, weltring in his own blood, until the
King and some of the rest of the company came in to congratulate his victory.
Who finding dying Phal^^ius to be the subject of his conquest, it quickly
turned all their expected joys, into an unexpressible sad contemplation, one
looking upon another as if they had seen an horrid vision; Till the beautiful
youth, (though in that posture) opening his ^ainting eyes, and perceiving many
about him, first casting them here and there f^ebly, to search out some object
they desired, at last, with a voice that scarce had power to speak any thing
but death, brought forth these sad words from his feeble tongue: I thank the
Gods, said he, that afford me yet time, before I perp^^^ally close my dying eye
from the worlds light, to relate these few passages, whereby the constancy of
my affection, and the truth of my unspotted love, may appear at the best
prospect: then know, my Lord the King, and you my dear and only husband, that
here lies before you the unfortunate, but more unworthy Alcia^a, though happy
in this, that I am a willing sacrifice to expiate the sins of those that
hindered my felicity; which, my Lord Orestes, you will easily believe, when you
shall be informed, that I did but borrow the name of Phalarius (since there is
none such) to seek you out in prison, where you were detained; when also you
know I served you diligently, according to my weak power; and in that manner,
enjoyed your conversation chastely, beseeming the pureness of my entire love,
as your own knowledge can testify, until the last fatal and deadly
separation, when I received a wound in your defense, a testimony sufficient how
well I desired to love you; however not mortal, as it then appeared; for one
of the Guard repairing again into the Chamber, after you were departed, more
compassionate perhaps then the rest, finding me ready to yield up my afflicted
soul into the hands of my maker, presently conveyed me into your warm bed,
where I rested all that day, till toward night that there came to my
assistance an old woman belonging to the lodgings, who applied such remedies to
my hurt, that in a short time I was able to transport my self from that
habitation to another more obscure; where I remained (every one thinking me
still amongst the vestall Nuns) until my brother Austratius overthrow
assured me of the impossibility of enjoying you as my husband; especially since
I heard you had given away your love to another Lady, though far more worthy
the^ my self, yet altogether unlawful whilst I was living: so that I was
determined to make an offering of mine own life to redeem the offense and by my
death to set you free, that you might with all liberty enjoy your election,
which you seemed to like better of; and therefore invited first that hand to
kill me, (for truly I had no hope in the victory) before it was given in
marriage to another; by that means dissolving the former contract, to render
the second prosperous. Then turning her self to the King, she desired him to
be so graciously good, as to suffer her brother again to possess that
Territory, which her had parted withal to purchase his ransom, since his
loss proceeded only from that natural affection which he bore her as his
sister. But by this time her short and panting breath gave evident signs to the
whole company, that death summoned her to the last part she was to play in the
Tragedy; wherefore, forcing h^^ self a little against her almost consumed
force, wherein love seemed to be most courageous; she lifted up her pale face,
begging a kiss in that manner with her trembling lips, of her dear, yet
unkind Lord Orestes; and after two or three deep sighs, which showed how
unwilling she was to leave him, yielded up her pure soul to the purest
Heavens, there to be made a Star for her virtues, whilst every eye and heart
was full of grief, as if the world had been already buried in her loss;
Orestes, who for a long time had frozen himself to her dead body, of a sudden
started up, as from his grave, and with distracted looks, casting his eyes
about him, at last fixed his view upon his naked Sword that lay on the grass,
colored yet with his Loves blood, to which object he flew with such violence,
as if he meant to revenge her death by the destruction of all mankind, since
she chiefly deserved to live of all others: but finding no subject, more justly
as he thought, meriting his passions, before any could prevent his intention,
sheathed the naked blade in his soft side, and presently fell down with the
stroke; which accident quickly brought the care of the whole company to his
assistance, having no leisure given them to mourn the sad fate of Aleiana,
since a nearer danger threatened them. However, the Gods, who either looked upon
the succession of Syria, or Orestes repentance, hindered the stroke from proving
mortal, by a fortunate slip of the weapon, so that instantly being carried out
of the Camp, to a more convenient place of rest, the Physicians quickly
advertised the King, of the security of the wound; which gave a contented
encouragement to all the soldiers, to assist at the funerals of poor Alciana,
whose body was interred with all the sad solemnity the time would permit, in
that very place where she lost her life; and afterward by Orsamos command was
erected to her memory, a stately Tomb over her grave, which spoke this
epitaph: These Marble piles upon the stop discover,
The Silver urne of an unhappy Lover;
Since too much love untimely caused her die,
Though want of love now makes her bloodless lie.
Heaven tied the knot that did the arm provoke,
And earth would have untied what caused the stroke.
Yet Heaven was more just that brought her ill,
Then earth that strived for to preserve her still;
Each did invite her to the Nuptial tie,
But both debarred her from posterity.


Also the Lady Orbella, hearing of this Tragedy, imagined her intended marriage
would not prove otherwise then ominous, since the prosecution thereof had
produced such lamentable effects; and therefore of a sudden retired from the
world among the vestall Numnes, in the City of Damasous, where she is resolved
to employ her youthful years (notwithstanding the strong invitation of her
uncle to the contrary) only in holy devotion, to the general commendation of
all Syria. But for Orestes, although he found a speedy remedy for his voluntary
received wound, by the care and industry of the Kings Physicians, yet he could
not so soon procure ease in his troubled thoughts for Alo^ana's death; and
therefore in the first place, began freshly to importunate his brother, to the
accomplishment of her request, whereby Austrasius might again be settled in his
ancient possessions: Nevertheless Philostros spightfull counsels prevailing
against all other persuasions, and many other of the chief Nobility of Syria
having lost by the same oppression their hereditary Offices, which they enjoyed
from their deserving ancestors, occasioned new troubles in the Kingdom; for
the Lords looking more upon Orestes probability, in being next heir to the
Crown, then Orsames government, wanting Posterity to fortify his Title, of a
sudden raised forces to join with their discontents, not only to put them anew
in possession of their rights, but to contend with the Favorites greatness;
alleging for their defense both the Queen Anaxia's banishment, and their own
injuries; by which endeavors, I say, in a short while after, they led an Army
into the field, to try the fortune of a battle with Orsames power; thinking it
better to hazard their heads in a doubtful issue, then to subjugate their
honors to a certain ruin: But in short, being totally overcome in a bloody
conflict, Orestes in person was taken prisoner, his Lieutenant General
beheaded, as a public example, and my self, with many others, were forced to
fly, to save our lives; which not only gave a full period to the design, but
occasioned my retirement into this private habitation, where I have for some
years lived, though in a low condition, since I prepare my thoughts against
all the flattering hopes of return, as long as Philostros sits at the stern of
Syria; whose disposition I know to be implacable, as the King his Masters
affection unchangeable, grounded upon these considerations, that as long as his
Favorite is safe and powerful, himself with security may freely enjoy his
own pleasures; and to that purpose has lately granted Philostros a new guard,
to defend his person from such dangers as his overgreat interest, and absolute
bold execution, threaten; especially, since not only the States of the
Kingdom are highly offended against his pride, but the common people become
exceedingly burdened by his taxations; besides, Sorastros King of Egypt (unto
whose protection the old Queen Anaxia is fled for refuge) knows it is his
principal design, absolutely to ruin his mighty Monarch, who therefore
labors his destruction. And this Sir, said the Forrester, is the unfortunate
story of my banishment, and others oppressions; in the relation of which, I
fear me, I have too much presumed upon your patience; though I can the more
easily excuse my presumption, for that the Chase yet affords no other
entertainment: and with that rose up with an intention to find out the dogs;
neither long had they traversed the copses, ere their ears were advertised,
that their hounds hotly pursued again the almost lost Dear, that continued the
sport until the night scarce gave them convenience to find their way home.

Cassianus thus being every day more and more delighted with this pleasant
conversation, began by little and little to weane himself both from Court
ambition, or desire of glory, and consequently thought not upon his
solicitation for the restoration of his Country, hardly harboring in his
quiet bosom any appetite of revenge of his fathers conceived injuries; and
less reflected upon either the turbulent persuasions of factious Demago as, or
the more gentle friendship of noble Eumene^: however now and then, he could not
choose but cast back his thoughts upon the remembrance of the Princes Cloria;
notwithstanding in such a dark way, as lights are accustomed (...) appear in a
thick mist, that could not ere long but be absolutely distinguished, when there
was not desire enough in his intentions to give it nourishment. Wherefore, the
better to continue his thought in these delights, he sold some few of his
smaller Jewels, to furnish himself for a Forresters life; and also cut away
much of his beautiful hair, to render his person more proper for the woods;
besides his felicity seemed to increase, not only by the solitary conversation
with the noble huntsman, but also by the more knowing instruction of the holy
Priest, which totally banished out of his remembrance at last, the whole
representation of Clorias excellencies; In prosecution of this intention, one
gentle morning not being at all threatened by a lowering sky, Cassianus,
accompanied only by his own thoughts, that seemed altogether innocent, leading
in his hand a dainty couple of Greyhounds, to be provided for any chase that
should accidentally present it self to his view, issued out into the green and
flourishing Forest, where long he had not entertained his expectation with the
hopes of discovery of some beast, that might breath his nimble dogs; but he
perceived a Knight armed lying upon the ground, under the large protection of
an old Oak, whilst his Lance rested by the side of the tree. But Cassianus not
being certain whether death or sleep gave him the posture, thought it an act
of necessary charity, to be something inquisitive after the manner, if not
occasion of his lying there; so that approaching at such a distance that the
noise of his steps must needs be heard if he were alive, the party suddenly
lifted up his head; with this Cassianus had a full view of his face, and by
that countenance quickly knew him to be his friend Eumenes, whom he had left
behind him in the Court of Lydia, which caused him to start back with some
violence, as if ashamed of himself to be discovered in that habit; or afraid
that his companion should chide him for his late unkind escape without his
privity; however again, encouraged by his disguise, he made a stand, until
Eumenes earnestly looking him in the face for a pretry space, at last with a
deep figh brought forth these words.

Can Cassianus think that any dissimulation, is of force to hinder the effects
and power of perfect friendship, which has eyes beyond the sollidst obstacle?
no, no, Cassianus, said he, make a true confession of your fault, that you may
receive speedy satisfaction. These words caused the Prince with trembling
steps, like a sorrowful penitent to come nearer to his friend, until at last
he seated himself by him with this language: O Eumenes, said he, it was love,
only tyrannical love, that deserves to bear the blame, and not poor and
faithful Cassianus. This expression seemed as strange to Eumenes cares, as the
alteration of his habit did to his eyes; and therefore conjured him by all the
remaining friendship left in his bosom, to let him know more of his secrets,
which was a spell of sufficient force to charm him to all the discovery of the
hidden mystery, concering his love to the fair Cloria, and his sudden
departure from Euarchus Court. After that Eumenes had chid him for his omission
toward himself, as comforted him with some flattering hopes, whereby to awake
his determinations to action tending to honor, since he knew otherwise it was
impossible again to recover his lost Country of Iberia, he told him in a forced
smile, that although he had poorly fled from his mistress, yet she had showed
more courage, and was come in person to seek him out in his most private
habitation. These words pu^ Cassianus to a new amazement, until Eumenes in
brief let him know, that the Queen being forced out of her repose, by the late
troubles in Lydia since his departure, Cloria was come to accompany her mother
into Syria, both remaining for the present in the Temple within the Forest;
whereas himself, as he said, had traveled most part of the past night,
without success to find out a more convenient lodging for the wearied Ladies:
This gave occasion to Cassianus to inform him presently of the Forresters
house, a place (as he told him) most fit for their reception, in that the
Master was a Nobleman of Syria, banished also by misfortune out of his own
Country. Eumenes's content and satisfaction for the accommodation, would not
permit them longer to expostulate the matter; only it was resolved Cassianus
should make use of his borrowed name of Cassia still, which he called himself
by amongst the inhabitants of the Forest, for fear of further discovery;
supposing the change of his apparel, and the shortness of his hair would
obscure his person: with these determinations they went to find out the
sorrowful Queen, and her lovely daughter, after their inconvenient rest.

But Cassianus, although he had put on as strong a resolution as his weak
power would give him leave, absolutely to bury his former love in oblivion; yet
when his eyes again beheld the admirable Princess, though only dressed with the
sad clothing of discontent for her mothers oppressisions, he stood trembling,
without being able to speak one single word, having no power to invite them to
the Forresters house. Eumenes, who quickly perceived his disease, told the
Queen, that that young huntsman was come not only to inform her, but to wait
upon her to a more convenient habitation; which would appear the better, as he
said, in regard of the inconvenience of the night past; the Queen, without any
circumstances embraced the offer, and went presently with her whole Train to
take possession of the courtesy. The Lodge was seated upon a rising hill, as
if it had been ordained by nature to be the commanding fortress of those
woods, which most pleasantly encompassed it round about, as a watchful guard;
yet leaving a large plain of all sides, to show they would not intrude too
near to be an inconvenience to the dwelling, which circuit also was employed
to the best advantage, since most beautiful Gardens, with Fountains, afforded
not only delight, but added in a manner state to the building; however it
seemed contrived only of purpose to avoid all ostentation, and purchase
privacy. The Queen and the rest of the company, had not employed much time in
beholding that pretty delight, but the old F^rrester himself, having been
advertised by Cassianus, that went before to that purpose, of some Noble guests
which he was to entertain, though he was not at all informed of the persons,
came out to meet them; as he prepared himself to give a complementall welcome,
according to the courtesy of his nature, and the civility of his education, he
was soon made certain of the presence of the Queen of Lydia, for that her
picture (which he had in his house) lively represented her countenance to his
memory; and not long after the Queen also came to understand, that he was her
base brother, driven out of Syria by the power of Philostros. As this
unexpected encounter gave the Queen some consolation in her discontented
voyage, so could not her brother be but impatient to know her fortunes, the
occasion appearing extraordinary, that brought her to this solitary place:
however he thought it not manners to press her to the inconvenience of a
relation, before he had settled her in her chamber, where the fair Mantuina
attended to do her service; who quickly brought in a curious banquet of her
own preserving, to give her Aunt entertainment. After Hyacinthia had
sufficiently refreshed his appetite, and the Princess Cloria was retired with
Eumenes, and the young Forrester Cassia, to take a view of those Gardens, which
lay under her mothers chamber window, the Queen being also descended into the
Parlor, began the story of her own oppressions by Euarchus subjests, with these
circumstances.

It is well known brother, said she, that after Philostros had firmly
established his own power, by the absolute favor of his master Orsames, he by
that means, also suppressed the greatness of all the Nobility of Syria, who
during the Kings infancy had always demanded conditions for themselves by
force of Arms; and having now no more opposition in his own Country, resolved
to contend with the mightiness of the Egyptian Monarchy. This, I may say,
has been one of the chief causes, that has procured the King my husbands
disturbances; and so consequently my own voluntary retirement, at present;
since the great Favorite, Philostros, finding he could not by any means work
Euarchus from his constant resolution, of keeping inviolably those ties of
amity, that still continue between himself, and the State of Egypt (I being
married, as was supposed, to that effect) became enflamed with a new spleen,
against the quiet felicity we seemed to enjoy in Lydia; and by consequence held
it a necessary piece of policy to disturb us in our peaceable government,
whereby Sorastros might receive no assistance, either from our endeavor or
power, if Euarchus at any time should be persuaded to such an intention, by
those affected, as he thought, more to the Egyptians then to the Syrians:
though truly, for my own part, I must ingeniously confess, for many years
together, I labored that breach Philostros desired; however without effect,
since the King my husband esteemed it a safer point of honor, to maintain both
love and correspondency with all his neighboring Princes, than to have a
needless enmity for the ends only of others; yet that which most aggravated
the fear (if not malice) of Orsames Favorite was, the coming into Lydia of
Queen Anaxia my mother, as was surmised, with certain conditions, not only of
a more strict unity between the two Crowns of Egypt and Lydia, but also with
propositions of a match of our daughter Cloria, with Prince Osirus; by which
means, he thought, the tie would become inviolable.

These reasons, as we imagined, caused Philostros to countenance some of the
Nobility of Myssia, not only to have a more particular dependency upon the
Crowns of Syria, but to become less regardfull of their own Prince; and to
demand some conditions advantageable to themselves, of Euarchus, by force of
arms; since he neither lived with them, as was pretended, nor could be drawn
to make a war with the King of Armenia, in his Nephew Cassianus quarrel.
Whilst businesses were agitating in this manner, one Dimogoras, an ancient
Noble man of Lydia, being not only of a factious disposition, but extremely
befriended of the common sort of people, who for the most part have not
patience, nor constancy to remain long in one mind, taking advantage of Prince
Cassianus coming to the Court of Lydia, as also of the discontents of Myssia,
of a sudden began with all violence to cry out for an engagement with the King
of Armenia; whereby, as 'twas alleged, with more honor, to recover again the
lost Country of Iberia. As these inflammations, I must tell, prognosticated
some alterations in our Kingdom of Lydia, which Euarchus had endeavored for
many years to detain in a quiet security, both out of his natural inclination
to peace, as well as by the faithful council of one Pollinex; so of the other
side, of necessity, it could not but afford the King sufficient matter for his
thoughts and considerations to work upon: To this purpose, he presently
dispatched, not only an Ambassador of quality to Artazes King of Armenia,
seriously to expopostulate with him, about the restoring of the country of
Iberia to his Nephew Prince Cassianus; but also sent other Messengers into
Myssia, as well to temper, as to feel the dispositions of those people, since
he had been advertised of disorders, if not rebellions already begun in that
climate, which he thought would prove, of some troublesome (if not dangerous)
consequence to his affairs, if not suddenly allayed and pacified, in regard
the situation of their habitations were not only barren, but unaccessible in
many places: in this posture jealousies continued, if not increased, by a
certain kind of desperation of all sides; until the King himself in person
was constrained, with a royal Army to march toward the confines of Myssia,
whereby in some visible way by his presence, to terrify those people, if it
were possible to new obedience, since neither his messengers, nor persuasions
had been able one jot to work upon their natures or loyalties; and the rather
did he resolve to make this expedition, for that he understood, some of the
Nobility had already sent a submission to Orsames my brother; however
Philostros, his Favorite, not long after conveyed the Letter to me in a
complement.

But the Myssians, not appearing any thing sensible of their ingratitude, with
the like seeming resolutions prepared themselves to give the King battle:
whilst in the interim Euarchus, suspecting many of the Nobility of Lydia that
were in his army (though in person they appeared to attend his command) were
disaffected to the cause, he tendered them an oath of fidelity, which they
refusing, he appointed them either to be confined, or retained in prison: But
that which seemed most strange in every man's apprehension was, that Dimogoras
remained most resolute notwithstanding to the Kings purposes against the
Myssians; though with what inward intention, I am not able to determine, since
both before and after the wars, he has showed himself most peevish and
spightfull in all our occasions.

In fine, not to detain you too long, with the relation of many tedious
circumstances, when Euarchus was ready to have given his disobedient subjects
the Myssians a total, if not dismal overthrow, by reason of the prerogative
of his numbers and power; he not only shufled up, contrary to every ones
expectation, certain conditions for their advantage; but granted them also
liberty to appoint commissioners for themselves, whereby with more deliberation
to dispute their pretended grievances in Lydia. However the Ambassadors,
instead of applying themselves to Euarchus, to finish the promised and begun
treaty, did of the contrary comply wholly with all the factious of Lydia; which
has produced since the calling together of the great Council of the Kingdom.
But for that one Pollinex suffered by this authority, who was a man of
excellent wit, knowledge, and courage, as well as his trial and condemnation
remarkable. I shall particularly mention the passages.

As it was well known at what root the Senate of the Kingdom intended to
strike, being thus assembled, without the good liking of the King; so Pollinex
could not choose but perceive the main mark they aimed at was his destruction,
as being the chief man that would and durst give his Master any counsel of
contradiction: yet, having belike an absolute confidence, either in his own
innocence, or his Princes favor; withal, building perhaps too much upon his
eloquence and parts, could not by any means be persuaded to quit the Kingdom;
wherefore, being presently apprehended, a Tribunal was erected for his
condemnation; however the Senate intended to be both Judges and accusers,
though my husband and my self were at the hearing, being desirous out of some
kind of curiosity, not only to be satisfied concerning the crimes of Pollinex,
but to be witnesses of the prosecution. After the prisoner was brought to the
bar, they wanted no force of arguments to render him seemingly guilty, to the
admiring people; who had been made already sufficiently prejudicate in their
opinions, by those which thought to gain by his destruction: And for the
Nobility, that seemed by the Laws of ^^dia, to be his formal Judges (however
in effect they durst but act what was dictated to them by the multitude)
conceived his escape might prejudice their own fortunes, wherefore were partly
resolved of their judgments before hand, knowing as in some sort his nature
was implacable, so would it be almost impossible to work him out of his Masters
favor; these reason enlarged the disputations to some weeks revolution with
equal violence.

But at last many of his Judges, whether convinced by the eloquence and
powerfulness of his arguments, or whether persuaded to more indifferency, by
some hope to enter into the Kings favor, of a sudden not only forbore any
more to enforce their allegations, but in direct terms, either professed
themselves his friends, or seemed openly to pretend, as they had been formerly
induced to thoughts of his condemnation, by the cries of the people, and
opinions of his crimes, so were both their hearts and consciences now altered
toward his preservation, in regard of those reasonable and just defenses, he
had made for himself, publicly before the face of the multitude.
Nevertheless both Dimogoras and the rest of his faction, continued yet violent
in their intended purposes, which was not only by this means to pull Pollinex
from the bosom of the King, but also to take away his life, least he might
again mount into places of eminency, to their prejudice: yet doubting that by
this way of trial, they should not possibly compass their ends, in that the
Judges being only of the Nobility, were divided in their opinions, resolved
upon passing a law in the Senate House for his condemnation.

After they had totally declined the first manner of prosecution, it was not
long before they put in execution the second, whereupon poor Pollinex, was
condemned to the slaughter; and not only stood thus censured as a guilty
person, without having liberty to speak for himself; but Euarchus was also
constrained, by the cries and exclamations of the enraged people, to give his
unwillingly consent to this unfortunate and cruel judgment, though long he
disputed with his Flamins about it, who all persuaded him to the compliance,
rather then hazard his own person, and the Kingdoms ruin.

Notwithstanding the King had condescended to these particulars, with an
intention to give the strongest testimonies could any way be devised, toward
the satisfying of the thoughts (if not rather the fancies) of his unbelieving
subjects; yet those of Dimogoras faction in the Senate, perceiving the Kings
unwillingnesse to this unexampled act of pretended justice, began to think,
that if they could not also procure from his consent, a perpetual continuation
of their own present power and authority, by some stratagem or other, their own
heads might soon pay for the violence used against Pollinex; wherefore it was
conceived most necessary, whilst they seemed to govern the actions of the
people, by their c^^es and clamours to fright Euarchus (or rather those about
him) to some extraordinary compliance in this nature; and by this means to have
the assembly of the Senate, not at all to be determined by the ancient and
known prerogative of the Crown, without their own allowance; which was almost
no sooner demanded, but it was granted; the rather for that the propositions
ca^^^ed with them two fair pretenses: First, that the necessary affairs of
the Kingdom required such a concession, by reason of those moneys that had
been borrowed for the payment of the armies, and the defraying of the soldiers
expenses. The second, in regard the King might at his pleasure, as was told
him, deny the confirmation of any law should be offered unto him, if he thought
it either prejudicial to himself or people. With these suppositions, Euarchus
was content to please his thoughts, and entertain his fancy; whilst on the
other side Dimogoras and his faction, did not only extremely rejoice at the
victory, their policy had gained over the Kings constancy, but began daily more
and more to press upon his patience, with other inconvenient, and I may say,
most unreasonable demands; in so much as he was forced to tempt the Myssian
commissioners, with a promise to make good unto that Nation, all their own
desires and pretentions, provided they would assist his present necessities, in
the recovery of all those privileges he had lately parted from and lost in the
country of Lydia.

This, I must tell you, seemed not only to be agreed upon, but Euarchus
himself in person made a voyage presently into Myssia, whereby the surer to
confirm the articles: when the King had thus performed, (they in the interim
promising to him all service and fidelity) returned again joyfully into the
Kingdom of Lydia, where he was received with some testimonies of love by the
City of Surdis; yet the Senate perceiving, the King began to purchase some good
opinion in the hearts of the better sort, put forth many Declarations, wherein
they not only taxed him with diverse faults in his own disposition, but
bitterly complained of his manner of government; These they publikly presented
unto him, fortified by the clamours and execrations of multitudes of the lowest
sort of people.

In these perplexities both my self and Euarchus remained for some months;
finding that the Senate did not only overpower all our endeavors,
notwithstanding we desired to give all satisfaction we could to the common
people; but the Myssians had deceived us in our expectations, although we had
both thein promises and oaths to the contrary: so that after my mother was
also banished out of Lydia, taking counsel of our best thought, since we had
few about us we could entirely trust, we resolved, as the King intended to try
another part of the Kingdom for his future safety and content, so my self
would make use of my interest with Orsames in Syria, notwithstanding his great
Favorite Philostros opposition, to see what assistance and relief, I could
purchase for my hushand in his distresses against his own subjects; with these
words the tears stood in her fair eyes, that seemed to stop the rest of her
discourse; however she put on such a countenance, that appeared more to
disdain her persecutors, then to bemoane her misfortunes.

Cand^lus, for so was her brother called, who with a respectfull silence had
heard out the Queens relation, reflecting in some sort by the related
circumstances, upon his own oppressions, returned this answer: Madam, said he,
although in a far less model I must behold my sufferings, since my condition
was not capable of such losses as yours, yet when I consider a person can but
lose all, as dark a night of unhappiness may be said to shut up his felicity,
as is possible; which I allege not any way to diminish the compassion that is
due to your person and dignity, from all noble and generous spirits; but to
possess your thoughts, with some desire of a private life, if things succeed
not according to your wishes in your journey: And the rather in regard I may
very probably doubt, the Favorite will not easily be withdrawn from any of his
designs, by what persuasions soever, having a dertermination perchance to
destroy the Lydian Monarchy; Besides, I have often heard him say, that a
popular State is most easy to be dealt with all by a politician, since it
consisting of many heads, some of the rulers at all times, will be subject to
the discovery of their privatest councels, either by way of corruption in their
dispositions, or want of secrecy in their natures.

However, replied the Queen, the consequence of any rebellion or change of
government in this nature cannot be, but a most dangerous president to the
kingdom of Syria it self; especially, it both the Myssians and the Senate of
Lydia do join in such an unity, that they can not be severed, by the interests
or power of other Nations: for that, said Candalus, the Favorite imagines,
that as there will be continual factions and divisions amongst themselves,
whereby upon all occasions they may be divided, notwithstanding any tie of
friendship or agreement, so has he laid, as he believes, so perfect and
strong a foundation in his own country, that it is unpossible it should rebel
at any time to his disadvantage, having not only furnished all the fortified
places, with plentiful garrisons of his own creatures, but by reason of the
war, he makes in every corner of Asia, he has the commodity of diverse
Armies, always ready at his command, to suppress any insurrection whatsoever:
and the poorer the people are, according to his maxims, the less capable of
dangerous disorders; for that their discontents shall rather produce distracted
assemblies, then well designed or furnished Troops, having neither money to pay
their soldiers, nor Captains to lead their forces; so that of necessity if
they rise, they must become contemptible sacrifices to his power and spleen,
instead of easing of themselves by their contentions.

It Is true brother, answered the Queen, I make no doubt but Philostros has
these thoughts in his imagination; yet, me thinks, he that pretends so much to
the good and honor of Syria, should also consider, that I being a child of the
house, and married into Lydia, by the general consent of my friends, ought not
to be thus cast away; without either conditions observed, in regard of my
Nuptials, or any consideration at all had of my person: and the rather may I
expect this justice I speak of, and am about to demand of Orsames or his
Favorite, for that the disgrace will reflect upon the whole Nation of Syria,
who will appear to the world either unwilling, or not able to assist me in my
necessities, it being a certain kind of moral, if not religious duty,
practiced amongst the meanest families; much more is it to be expected, from
the dignity of Kings and Princes, that should be inflamed with the least
suspicion or jealousy of dishonor.

Madam, replied Candalus, however I might allege from the nature and
proceedings of Philostros, other pernicious maxims of State policy, used in
the communication, and comportment of Princes in their governments, as for
example; that it is better to hazard, if not sacrifice, a daughter of the
royal house, then any way to lose or endanger the least good to the Kingdom;
Yet I shall desire you to believe, what I have spoke in this discourse, are but
the arguments of Statesmen, or rather you may interpret them my own fancies,
the better to settle your thoughts against unexpected accidents, so that I
should think my wishes very fortunat if your persuasion can prevail with your
brothers goodness, without the knowledge of his great Favorite, whereby it
might procure you assistance, as my self freedom to return into Syria,
again to enjoy the conversation of my friends; or at least wise some allowance
out of my own estate; notwithstanding I am prepared as you see, to be
contented with my present fortune.

By this time the Princess Cloria, and the rest of the company were come out
of the Garden, from taking those pleasures, which the beauty of the place
afforded; who prettily pressing to give her Mother an account of those rarities
she had seen, absolutely put off the other serious discourses; for that every
one was most willing to be so employed, until Mantuina with an humble
salutation informed her Father, that the Queens Supper in another Room
attended her pleasure; which being accomodated rather with exquisite neatness,
then magnificent plenty, increased the opinion of that happy course of life,
appearing free from ambition, though wanting no content that might satisfy
temperance, however not fulfill pride. But the circumstance of the feast being
past, and every one retiring to their rest, Eumenes would needs accompany
Cassia toward his Lodgings, that were in a Village not far off: Cassia was
more willing to condescend to his friends trouble because he was desirous to
hear something from him of his own departure from Lydia, and of the success
of that Ambassador which Euarchus had sent into Armenia, to treat about the
restoration of his Country of Iberia; yet the night being too far spent to
make any long relations, without some suspicion of their former acquaintance,
they resolved both the next morning to meet in the Forest under the tree,
where the day before they found one another, as the most convenient place of
communication and consultation.

Cassia, was the first that appeared, as it should seem most passionate in his
desires; but Eum^nes not being also over slothful, not long after gave him the
meeting, where both seating themselves upon an old root, which by nature was
ordained fit for the conference, since it afforded them the conveniencie,
Eumenes began to discover unto him these particulars; however, with a
conjuration first, not to be moved with the relation; after said he, that you
had taken your flight from the Court of Lydia, for so I must call it, rather
then a departure, since your friends were not worthy to be of your Council,
the Ambassador which Euarchus had sent into Armenia, to treat about the
redelivery of your Country of Iberia, not only returned, but brought with him
a conditional restoration of your right; which was, that certain moneys should
be paid to Tygranus Duke of Colchis, and you to promise a firm obedience to
the Crown of Armenia: But Damogoras fearing that this seeming accord would
prejudice the hopes of his employment, began exceedingly to mu^iny against the
propositions, as dishonorable, since you were not to be established with all
freedom; withal alleging, it were more justice in Euarchus to bestow his
daughter upon you, being of her own blood and religion, then upon Osirus, who
was always known to be an enemy to the worship of the Gods, according to the
rules of Lydia, as also to the State and prosperity of the Kingdom it self;
which makes me believe now I think upon it, that you thought him more worthy
them my self, to be made acquainted with your private love, who else certainly
could not have been inspired with those apprehensions. At which Cassianus began
to blush, but Eumenes not willing to break off his relation by any diversion,
told him, that his intention was only to inform him, that he might know
hereafter the better how to prosecute his affairs, and not to obraide him
whereby to put him into confusions, so then followed on his discourse; neither
did Damogoras, said he, make use of his own tongue only to blast the justice
of the Kings intentions, but combined also with many Mysians about the Court,
to reprove Euarchus manner of Government; besides they alleged, that the
Queen spent more in Maskes and Dancings, then would maintain a royal Army,
by force of arms to recover your lost right: And for Anaxia they made the
people believe, that by giving her noble entertainment in Lydia, the Kingdom
was not only exposed to the unrelenting spleen of Philostros, Orsames great
Favorite, but to be feared, that horrid troubles would quickly fall upon the
whole Country, since her person ever brought mischief and misfortune
wheresoever it went: with these exclamations, in a short space, they chased the
poor Queen out of Lydia, again to seek an uncertain fortune, who only
desired a resting place for her aged body, to spend the rest of her years in
peace and security; but the Gods it should seem, willing to put an end to her
miseries, have since taken her out of the world, to the example of all
greatness, and humane glory, scarce leaving her sufficient to provide for her
decent funerals: however Damogoras with the rest of his factious companions,
seemed not yet satisfied, but continued still their turbulent practices; so
that now they have not only plucked from Euarchus imperial Diadem, the chief
Flowers that adorn it, which is regal authority, but have by their violent
proceedings also, driven out of the Kingdom Hyacinthia their Queen, either
with intention, the more to please the powerful Favorite, or to prevent her
from assisting the King by her Counsels to defend his Kingly authority. This,
Cassianus, is the occasion of o^r present journey into Syria, whereby if it be
possible, to obtain some succors from Orsames power, to quallifie these
threatening disorders, that promise little less then the ruin of the
prosperity of Lydia, whilst you in the mean time seem to put on a resolution
to bury your thoughts in this contented course of life, neither reflecting upon
the misery your affairs in part have produced, nor consider the honor of
your house, in recovering again by action your lost Patrimony; and with these
words rested silent, as if he expected some satisfaction by his friends reply.

After that Cassianus had only signified his sorrow by a few sighs, and not
many tears, he asked Eumenes what he would have him do? What would I have
you do, said Eumenes? either prosecute your love to the fair Princess, if it
be possible to be obtained; since Clorias indignation, cannot be but
exasperated against your person, by reason of her fathers suffering, as she may
think, by your means; or else, take upon you some brave resolution, to recover
again your lost country, which you have now a better opportunity then ever to
obtain; for Orsames has lately proclaimed open wars against the King of
Armenia, in the name of all the oppressed Princes, of which number I am sure
you cannot but be esteemed one; and for the convenience of both the designs,
you may accompany us under your disguised habit into Syria, without any
suspicion at all; as well to attempt the love of the Princess Cloria in the
journey, as to undertake the recovery of your Country when you are there, if
you fail of the first. This proposition of Eumenes, extremely pleased
Cassianus; so that again his hopes seemed to invite his endeavors to the
execution; only there appeared yet this difficulty, how he could easily part
from the old Forrester, whom he had promised to accompany as long as he lived;
and had to that purpose, by the sale of his Jewels, provided himself with all
necessaries for such a determination. But Eumenes told him, that as that
obstacle ought to be of too low a consideration for his thoughts, since his
birth and fortunes required the highest resolutions, so of the other side, he
could furnish him with a most warrantable pretext, in that yesternight, said
he, the Queen being in discourse with her brother, about his return into
Syria, (which she promised, notwithstanding her own pressing occasions, to
solicit with all diligence) you may undertake to be the messenger, to bring
him back an answer of the success, and by that means have the opportunity, not
only to be admitted into the Queens train, but in the journey be a daily
attendant about your Mistresses person. This was so far from not contenting
Cassianus, that it almost ravished his apprehensions; whereupon, embracing
Eumenes, he told him, that notwithstanding his own ingratitude, he was ordained
by the Gods to be the preserver of his honor, if not the obtainer of his
felicity.

Not many days after this discourse, when the Queen had refreshed her self
sufficiently with her brothers contented solitude; and that preparation was
made of two good ships at the next Sea port, to carry her into Syria; the one
for her one person, attended by her Ladies, and chief train, the other for
her horses, with other commodities for the voyage; (in which latter however
Eumenes and Cassianus chose to go, not only because they would give the women
the greater liberty, but also have the more opportunity for their own private
discourses) they put to sea one gentle morning, when the wind seemed most
obedient to the intention, and sailed all the day in such a peaceable calm, as
if Neptune meant to contribute his absolute protection, in conducting the Queen
to Tire, a Haven where she intended to disimbarke for Damascus; however an
hour before night, when the Sun scarce appeared above the superficies of the
earth, the winds as it should seem, inconstant to their former resolution,
began first to quarrel with the sails, as if they had been angry with their
gallant bravery, for driving the vessel with so quiet a Majesty, upon the
smooth face of the Ocean; and then made war against the waves, for
subjugating themselves to such a burden; which not only continued, but
increased the trouble, until dark night gave warning to the Mariners, to take
down the tacklings from the mast, lest violently they might be cast upon some
of the rocks, which they knew every where dispersed in those Seas; neither
could they conveniently make use of their anchors in the deep waters: But the
storm increasing, not only augmented the fear of the whole company,
especially the women, who by their loud shriekes hardly gave opportunity, to
the workmen to perform their offices, according to the words of command, but
also gave cause of doubt to the chief Pilots themselves, that understood more
knowingly the danger: only the Queen, whose thoughts seemed already drowned in
a vast sea of discontent, scarce believed she could undergo a worse shipwreck:
yet poor Cloria, whose innocence had never merited such a hazard, could not
choose but complain, inwardly of the cruelty, though her expressions were no
other, then in a seeming pale and distracted silence, sometimes crying
nevertheless, because she saw it generally practiced: until the thunder and
lightning in the night, increased the horror of every ones expectation,
discovering, as it were by that unpleasant light, the greedy waves, ready
gaping with a devowring aspect, to swallow up all their hopes, which put them
past an amazed fear, to a certain expectation of ruin: Wherefore the Priests
were presently called to do sacrifice to the Gods, either to appease their
fury, whereby they might be assisted here in the danger of their lives, or
obtain their mercy in another world after their deaths; some in hope yet to
escape from rain; others of more pious thought, speedily to be removed to a
better babitation; and a third sort invocated without any confidence, but to be
conformable to the custom; which however gave sufficient employment to the
whole assembly for some hours, until by little and little, about the break of
day, the winds began something to abate of their furious rudeness, as if they
had partly wearied themselves out of breath with their own violent combustion;
Then suddenly A^^ora started out of her watery Couch, seemingly more early then
ordinary, to chide the storm for being so over bold in her absence, in
disturbing the quiet felicity of so Noble a company: This gave warning to her
slothful Lover, not only to attend his blushing Mistress, but to aid her in
her desire, again to command the winds to their wonted Caves; only to converse
with monsters, since they knew no better how to use their power, amongst people
of a milder conversation: but in the interim sweet Cloria, with a tincture more
illustrious then the brightest Goddess, directed her eyes and hands to the
Heavens, as a testimony of her gratitude for her preservation; which in a short
time produced so perfect a calm, that the seas seemed with humility to beg
pardon for their late agitation; and certainly had with much ease obtained it
of the whole company, since every one was full of joy for the unexpected
change, if of a sudden the miserable wrack of the other ship had not appeared
as a horrid spectacle; the mast covered over with deed bodies floating in one
place; trunks, and other commodities swimming in others; horses and men half
dead striving with natural industry to keep the little life that yet remained
in their bodies to the last minuit: some again upon broken boards, had good
fortune to save themselves on the sides of the approaching rocks; whilst a few
were preserved by the hasty sending out of the long boat to their assistance;
though, amongst the number, neither Cassia nor Eumenes appeared: but however
this cause of sorrow troubled their hearts for a long season, especially the
Queens, whose Noble compassion could not but melt into some tears; yet the
mariners were hasty to conduct the ship to a safe harbor, since she was
rendered for the present, altogether incapable of a further voyage, having
neither sails nor mast; besides, being much beaten by the storm; so that upon
consultation, Cyprus was found to be the next convenient landing place, which
caused them to direct their intentions to some commodious port in that Island:
wherefore, as within six hours hard labor, by the industrious mariners, they
arrived in a little haven, not many furlongs from the famous City of Salamine.

The Duke hearing the news of the Queens falling upon that coast, as also the
occasion of her retirement out of Lydia, speedily prepared himself, not only
to give her a respectfull visit, beseeming her quality, but some convenient
consolation, in regard of her necessity; Wherefore presently causing his own
Palace to be accommodated for her reception, with a Noble train, went himself
in person to offer her the welcome and honor of Cyprus. The Queen
understanding of the Dukes approach, thought it not at all fit, punctually to
observe the circumstances appertaining unto her dignity, since she was now
rather to become a suppliant, then to keep State, so went out of the house to
give him the meeting; who quickly with a Courtly humility, kissing her fair
hand, told her, that although the seas should have done reverence to her
quality, for which they deserved to be chasticed, yet the Gods were abundantly
propitious, to afford Cyprus the happiness of her reception, by the others
neglect; and for his own particular, he vowed her his best service against her
malicious enemies. The Queen, after that she had returned the Duke a grateful
thanks, in a bashful smile, told him, that as she could not blame the seas,
that was but a senseless creature, for any inconvenience she had suffered,
since she found so much omission in the subjects of her own Country, so of the
other side, she esteemed the winds had done her a favor, in driving her into
a place she found an entire Nobleness.

After the Duke had invited the Queen to Salamine, which she accepted within
three days, because she was not prepared at the present for the journey, both
in regard of her losses at sea, and her own, and peoples indisposition by
reason of the storm, he took his leave, with a resolution at the time
appointed, to meet her, with such a military entertainment, as was fit for her
reception; and according to that determination, the morning before the Queen
was to take her little though solemn journey, the Dukes Trumpets presented her
with an early salutation, which gave warning that their Lord was not far off,
to perform the rest of the service; and being placed in a Chariot of Crimson
Velvet, she was conducted through the peoples acclamations, toward the place
designed for her abode; when, in the interim, every ones eyes were cast upon
the young Princess Cloria, seated at her mothers feet, resembling another
Diana, with a silver bow in her hand, and a Garland of flowers upon her head;
though another beauty invited also their looks, and something withdrew their
intentions, which was lovely Narcissus, the Dukes son, gallantly mounted, who
with a brave company on hors-back was come out of the Town, by his fathers
command, to honor the show. Narcissus appeared to be a beautiful Cupid, sent
by the Gods to conquer the inferior world, with the effects of love: And
Cloria resembled a Deity placed upon a Throne in the heavens, above the reach
of mortality to attempt; he looked like the spring, adorned with variety of
choicest flowers: and she, as an illustrious morning breaking in the East,
colored by Aurora's blush. The people, with a transported delight, beheld the
one; but with an amazement, seemed to adore the other: These objects absolutely
destroyed the other richness, designed for the Queens entertainment; for the
multitude employed all their hearts and hands, to invite a continuation of what
their never to be wearied eyes saw before them, till the best part of the
neglected triumph, past away without being regarded.

When these sweet creatures met one another, though with their looks only,
since the distance of their persons would afford them no greater a convenience;
they pursued the encounter with such an earnest attentiveness, as if the
destinies had already determined an eternal simpathy in their hearts, not to
be disunited by any earthly power; however, the poor girl presently blu^^t,
although her innocence knew nothing wherefore; and Narcissus, appearing
inflamed with that blush, instantly grew red; at which Cloria cast down her
eyes, as if apprehending a fault in her too much confidence; whilst the youth,
having suddenly lost the brightest part of his delight, approach nearer the
Chariot; at which unexpected boldness, the Princess grew presently pale,
fearing belike a public address. But he apprehending, with a sharp
reverence, the mayds desire, not only fell back from his determination, but
also mingled himself with the rest of his company; which gave occasion to
Cloria, to seek him continually wish her looks, until their arrival at the
Palace gate, for some time interrupted the enquiry, though a greater
convenience brought them to a nearer neighborhood: for whilst Narcissus father
led the Queen up the stairs, he thought it his duty, as his son, to offer
the same service to the daughter: wherefore taking her by the fair hand to
perform the office, Cloria suddenly feeling the touch, which her modesty had
scarce ever been acquainted with from any other person, with a quick violence
plucked it from him, and hid it in her muffe. He too much apprehending the
action, had hardly power with trembling steps, to carry himself up into the
room; yet, by that time having recovered some breath, and considering his last
part of Courtship was to be played, since she was shortly to be enclosed in her
Chamber from his sight, approached her ears with a few distracted complements,
which she answered no otherwise then with a smile, and presently seemed to fly
to the protection of her mother, where she remained as in a fortress, free as
she conceived from his importunities, until the Duke his father took his leave
of the Queen, that necessarily commanded also Narcissus from his tormenting
delight, to wait upon his duty.

But the poor Boy, not being able to bear the strong assaults of powerful
love, within a short time began to loose the beauty of his cheeks, and not
long after fell into a most dangerous sickness; so that the Duke not knowing
the secret cause of the violent distempers of his sweet Son, with grief and
diligence assembled the best Physicians of those parts; however, all their
knowledges were not of sufficient force, either to know the nature of his
disease, or to cure his violent malady, which put the whole Court into an
extreme perplexity, as himself into a desperate sadness; the rather for that
melancholy sighs, were the only expressions which were used by lovesick
Narcissus; until one day the Princess Cloria coming into the Chamber with the
Queen her Mother, charitably to visit her almost dead though unknown Lover,
and standing by his bedside, with tears also in her eyes, the Assembly
quickly found not only an apparent change in his countenance, but the Doctors
felt a violent alteration in his pulse, which gave occasion of some discourse
at the present, but of more inquiry afterward of the reason. Wherefore when
the Queen with her fair Daughter were departed, and the rest of the company
severed from their attendants, the Duke by the advice of some of the
Physicians, began to fall upon a strict examination of his Son, and so far
pressed him to the discovery of his inward thoughts, that at last the youth not
being able to show much disobedience to his Father, though his bashful love a
long time contended against his duty, revealed not only the true cause of his
passion, but the subject of his distempers: This gave the Dukes despaires some
satisfaction, in that at least he conceived he had got a knowledge, whereby his
Son might dome to be recovered, though the remedy required to be applied
with as much expedition, as the disease seemed desperate in operation.
Wherefore after he had comforted the Boy, with as many hopes as possibly he
could, the better to keep up his courage, and so consequently to procure ease
in his pain, that he might have the more force to resist the violence of his
desire, as well as the likelier to dispose him for the cure, he retired
himself into his own Chamber, there to consider with less interruption, what
course was to be taken for the purpose he intended; which was to save his
Sons life, in whom consisted all his felicity, since he had only besides one
daughter, the fair Eretheria, who was not capable by reason of her Sex, to
succeed to his honor, and command in the Island of Cyprus.

First he laid before his consideration, the seeming impossibility of his Sons
recoverie, without the assurance of Cloria's affections, since the Physicians
informed him, that the nature of love was of too violent a quality, to suffer
any medicine to operate with effect in (...) sick patient, unless that passion
were either qualified or satisfied.

Next he knew that was not to be obtained, unless the Princess her self
became the artist, which seemed to be a work of no small difficulty; These
difficulties continued the Dukes thoughts in a perplexed labyrinth, sometimes
considering his own disabilities to pretend to so high a match, since he was
rather esteemed a Subject and Servant to the State of Cyprus, then an absolute
Prince indeed in his power and command, however of the other side again he
reflected upon his own worth, and upon the opinion the world had of his valor
and riches; but that was scarce held competent in his imagination, when he
considered the attempt he was to make, was not only upon the primest beauty of
all Asia, but he was to contend with the honor and glory of Syria and Lydia,
who claimed an interest both in her blood and quality. Yet seeing for the
present his assistance was necessary for the Queens affairs, he resolved to
make the demand, especially for that without it, his son was sure to perish,
which to his happiness was a perpetual night: with this determination he went
instantly to the Queen Hyacinthia, carrying with him a Soldiers heart, but a
Suppliants countenance.

After he had performed his accustomed salutations, and enterteined her with
some ordinary discourses, giving her a short account also of his Sons
indisposition, being seated together by the Queens importunity in a chair, he
began his more serious proposition after this manner: Madam said he, as I come
not now altogether to pay those due Ceremonies which appertain to the dignity
of your Majesty; so I must humbly entreat your goodness to excuse the
necessity of my errand, since it is the violence of a youthful affection only
that occasions it to my grief, as to your trouble: be pleased then to know,
that being earnestly inquisitive to understand my Sons disease, whose desperate
condition requires present assistance, or brings speedy death, I used not only
the Art of the best Physicians of these parts, but employed my whole Authority
to examine his inward thoughts, finding by some signs, that much of his
sickness proceeded from hidden discontents, since the variableness of his
passions returned and abated according to accidents, which not to detain you
too long in a needless expectation of what I would discover, and after that
entreat) is no other then that Narcissus is in love with your fair daughter,
the Prince Cloria, whom as I fear he must either enjoy as his right, or
perpetually loose his other joys in this world; for that as I am informed,
there is no mean between possessing that admirable beauty, or marrying himself
to the deformity of a dark Sepulcher; wherefore, as I cannot challenge so
great an honor out of any hope of my own merit, so of the other side give me
leave to profess, that all my fortunes, power, and endeavors, shall be
always faithfully employed in the Service of your self and husband, against
the injuries of your disobedient Subjects.

The Queen after she had heard this strange and unexpected discourse of the
Duke, did not of the sudden well know what to answer; of the one side
considering the high consequence of his request; as of the other, the great
need she might have of his help, besides the present entertainment she
received in his Country, with the desperate condition of his only Son, fallen
into the accidental misfortune by her own personal arrival in the Island of
Cyprus: but having a pretty while pawsed upon a reply, not to be too rash in
uttering that, which past she could not well recall, at last she returned him
this answer, with a countenance that expressed fear, doubt, and affection: My
Lord, said she, as the noble courtesies which you have been pleased to cast
upon me in my necessities, with that humane consideration that all the world
ought to have, of the deservings of your sweet Son, must needs stir up such a
grateful pity in my soul, that I shall endeavor all ways possible to
render you totally satisfied; so of the other side, I must befeech you without
partiality to consider, that I am not only a wife, and so consequently under
the obedience of my husband, who cannot but expect to have at leastwise the
knowledge of the dispose of his daughter in marriage, but am also going toward
Orsames my brother, to obtain from his power an assistance in my pressing
affairs, wsto certainly could not be but displeased to have his Niece given
away in the journey without his privity; yet so far I am content to comply
with your request; to let you see how grateful I desire to be, because the
necessity of your Sons disease may require some speedy remedy, as that my
daughter accompanied with her governesse Roxana, shall frequently visit
Narcissus, until by the opinion of his Physicians, he be clean out of danger;
whilst in the mean time we may have some opportunity, as well to consider as to
solicit Orsames, and make Evarchus acquainted with your intentions; however,
I judge the convenience more proper for both, when I shall my self in person
go into Syria.

The Duke being transported with the graciousnesse of the Queens reply, not
doubting but this liberty was sufficient to recover a thousand new lives in his
sick Son, took her fair hand, upon which he sealed his humble thankfulness,
and withal vowed himself a perpetual slave to her service; After he had
staid some small time longer in her Chamber, as a circumstance belonging to his
courtship (though his desire flew with speedy wings to bear away the joyful
news to Narcissus) he took his leave, which not only filled all the Court
with confidence of his Sons recocovery, but the wished effects quickly
followed; for the youth reviving by these hopes, within ten days obtained his
perfect health to the absolute content of all Cyprus: The Princess Cloria
beginning now also by that allowed familiarity, with the former impressions
she had received, to taste the sweet apprehensions of her lovers passions,
though her innocent temper could scarce be brought to the least discovery, one
day with her governesse (whilst her mother was otherwise employed) took
occasion to take the pleasure of those gardens that lay not far off her own
lodging; where plucking with her white hand many dainty flowers, which that
place plentifully afforded, when she came to that, that the Poets fained the
ancient Narcissus to be turned into (inwardly interpreting it, as a perfect
Emblem of her servants perfections) she read so fluent a Lecture upon the
theme, and with such an earnestness, that it was easy to be perceived, what
subject her heart most delighted in; however Roxana understanding her meaning,
had much ado to abstain from laughing at the pretty expression of her
affections: yet with difficulty she forbore any publication thereof, until
she had fully ended her love discourse; and then the old woman, in a kind of a
serious smile beseeching her Highness, since she appeared to be so mighty a
scholar in those fictions of the Poets, she would so far instruct her
ignorance, that she might also be made acquainted with the applications of the
story. But Cloria soon discovering by her Governesses fained gravity, that she
made request only to jeere her, presently with the apprehension began to
blush: At which Roxana laughed in good earnest; and that drove sweet Cloria
absolutely out of countenance, in so much as with a kind of a gentle anger,
mixed with an innocent shame, she wept; which certainly had drawn on a more
dangerous quarrel, between her and her Governesse, if a messenger from the
Queen, had not commanded Cloria to wait upon her mother, to certain pleasures
of hawking, prepared for her delight and recreation, that diverted for the
present the contention.

However love seemed now to triumph of his conquest, over these two excellent
creatures; yet the spightfull destinies would not with so much happiness,
suffer them to enjoy the sweetness of their delightful conversation; for the
Queen falling sick by reason of her late distempers at sea, and the Duke being
called away to his warlike employment against the King of Egypt, these
accidents separated their persons, though not their affections, to both their
discontentments; for necessarily Narcissus must accompany his father in the
journey: which kept the Princess Cloria some time after, as it were wedded to
her own lodgings, unless it were, as her duty invited her, to visit her
mother; pretending however, her retiredness proceeded from the Queens
indisposition.

But the Princess at last being atogether tired with keeping the house, one
evening she called her Governesse to accompany her into the fields to take some
taste of the fresh air; where long she had not spent that time, that she
rendered altogether innocent by her hurtlesse employment, now and then plucking
the beauties of nature, that appeared to put on a more cheerful look, to be
handled by such delicacy; (for though their wild growth, afforded them not so
much sweetness as domestic flowers, yet her pure breath seemed to supply that
defect, as she carried them in her fair hand) before she encountered with a
lovely country maid, bearing upon her arm a white basket, covered with a
whiter cloth; the The young damsel at the sight of the Princess, not only
stood still in a trembling posture, as if her own bashfulnesse had a little
distracted her, but withal caused her to dress her countenance with such
interchanges of red and white, that Cloria with a pretty smile at the Girls
confusion, began to interrogate her of her name, friends, and business; unto
which the girl, after she had borrowed leave of her fears, by the Princess
encouragement, told her she was called Aminta, born of country parents, not
far off; and said, her business was to seek some good service, for that her
father being lately pressed a soldier for the wars of Egypt, had left her to
the world, to procure her own subsistence; with that wept, as if her
necessities were yet more pressing then she was willing to express by words.
Cloria, being wholly overcome by a Noble passion, reflecting upon the youth and
beauty of the maid, accompanied with the fearful bashfulnesse of her
demeanor, turned her self presently to Roxiana, and desired her that she
would be so charitable, as to entertain the girl as a new servant, because
without her mothers approbation, as she said, she could not admit her to be one
of her own attendants; which however Roxiana for some time resisted, as being
unwilling in a strange Country to burden her self with the augmentation of
her train; yet by the powerful importunity of the Princess, at last she
dispensed so far with her rigid providence, as to admit of Aminta for one of
her followers. This gave occasion to the maid presently to fall down upon her
knees, whereby humbly to acknowledge the favor at no less a rate, then the
preserving of her reputation, if not the saving of her life; since, as she
confessed, she knew not what friends to fly to for succor or counsel:
withal, uncovering the basket that rested upon her arm, wherein was
discovered variety of choice fruits, she presented them as a token of her
service and gratitude to the fair Princess, beseeching her she would be
pleased to accept of such dainties, as the place of her fathers habitation did
afford; that however, as she said, might be enriched by her taste, to prove of
a greater value then they seemed: then retiring again with so becoming a
modesty, that the court breeding in the comely maid, appeared only to have put
on a country attire, which made them wonder at her behavior with an
extraordinary delight.

But the latenesse of the evening gave Roxana warning to solicit Cloria to
retire, least the falling of the dew might either injure her health, or
prejudice her complexion, which for the present afforded only convenience of
discourse in the way, though the Princess afterward was never well, but when
she had the maid in her company: And this in time so increased her affection,
that she made her in a manner her only play-fellow; scarce delighting in any
conversation but in young Amyntas, whose countenance and actions put on such a
grave sadness and respective diligence; that as of one side she seemed only
desirous to please her mistress, so of the other she appeared too serious for
the worlds conversation; but the Princess, finding by Amyntas frequent sighs,
that something more then a natural sadness, or a dutiful respect possessed
her thoughts, she not only oftentimes enquired of the cause of her grief, but
narrowly looked into the demeanor of her Governesse, whose severity she might
fear, had procured some discontent in her gentle bosom. Yet, being not able
to extort from the maid her self any confession, and also Roxana assuring her,
that no hard usage of hers, caused her melancholy, Cloria one day resolved to
try her uttermost skill, whereby to be informed of the the secret mystery of
Amyntas sad expressions; and the rather for that her complexion seemed
something to suffer in the concealment, or at leastwise so interpreted by her
thoughts.

Wherefore one day she commanding her to attend her person, into a certain
walk near the house, where she was accustomed often to take her recreation,
it being a place defended from the heat of the Sun, and the violence of the
winds, by the natural situation of a pleasant grove of trees; the Princess
being there arrived seated her self upon a little rising bank, which art
appeared to have raised for such a purpose, whilst in the mean time Aminta
stood by her in respective attendance. But Cloria rather aiming at the
execution of her intention, then the reverence of her servant, according to her
usual custom when no body was present, commanded her to those familiarities
she was most delighted withal, which was to sit down by her, since youth is
better pleased with freedom in conversation, then state reservednesse in
actions. When she had thus placed her self, the Princess, without many
circumstances in words, (for that her passion to be resolved, as it should
seem, was too violent to be delayed) conjured her by her own duty, and that
love she bore her, which if she proved over obstinate, as she said, might be
lost, to discover unto her the cause of her sadness or grief, which her
frequent sighs sufficiently expressed to be engrafted in her soul, proceeding
from some hidden reason not yet revealed. Aminta by the Princes importunity,
whose love and severity seemed prettily woven together, after a few tears mixed
with many pauses, and two or three deep sighs, as if her tongue were afraid to
become a traitor to her heart in the discovery, uttered these words.

Most fair Princess, said she, let the Gods be only blamed, if I am compelled
to say, it is no other then your self that causes my smart. Cloria finding an
answer so much against her expectation, and much more intention, could not
choose but look her full in the face, though with a kind of silent reproof, as
if she rather yet excused her own ignorance, then accused Aminta's suspicion;
but the maid redoubling her words, like a fierce tyrant with multitude of
blows, when he had his enemy at his mercy: Nay, said she; you have cruelly, as
I fear, conspired my life; and which is worse, no physic can be applied to my
wounded soul, but what remedies your self shall bring; like the Scorpion,
that only heales what hurt his sting procured: Cloria being amazed at these
expressions; Aminta, after some pause again, uttered this language, know dear
Cloria, that Narcissus cannot live without the conversation of his admired and
beloved Mistress, which only has caused this strange metamorphosis before
your eyes, to be turned to a more deadly form, if you cruelly deny the grace
that I humbly require. By this Rhetoric the Princess was sufficiently
informed of her patient: however, for some time she rested silent, until at
last she desired to know how he could excuse his absence to his father?
Narcissus quickly answered, that pretending a journey into Syria, to be better
instructed in the fashions and customs of that Court, he had procured leave to
travel for some while, though he intended to make no farther a voyage then to
her beauteous self, in which school all excellency and content, as he said,
was to be perfectly learned; then held his peace with such a begging look, that
Cloria had scarce power to contradict: until with tears in her fair eyes,
she after some small silence used these words:

Dear Narcissus, said she, for so I must call you, in that you have
endeavored to merit that name at my hands; though I cannot but reprove the
over holdnesse of your atempt, since thereby it should seem, you have
mis-interpreted all my favors; having so little respect to my honor, as that
you have borrowed this false disguise, to satisfy your pretended passion,
which the world will neither excuse in you, nor allow in me, if it be once
known, how you were secretly entertained by my allowance, in the habit of a
Countrey-maid: yet to let you see how charitable I am, notwithstanding your
transgression, I freely forgive the fault past, so you will now repent, and
make satisfaction, in your returning speedily again from whence you came, not
giving me further occasion to be jealous of my never yet suspected modesty;
this being said, she ended with such a look, as showed plainly she spoke
against the desires of her own heart. But Narcissus, who could put no less a
difference between his admittance and denial, then a most unkind and cruel
banishment, told her, that if she had a will to destroy him, she might enjoin
that penance, since he was resolved to abstain from all natural food, unless
he should be fed in her presence, by the sight of her perfections; and with
that cast down his eyes with so sorrowful a look upon the ground, as if he
sought nothing but a grave, since he could not enjoy the life of her
conversation.

Cloria, after she had attentively beheld him, and then looked up at the
heavens, as if from thence she expected supernatural assistance, and again
rested silent, with abundance of tears gushing violently from her fair eyes,
at last broke out into these imprecations: that if ever by any accident, his
being with her in a disguised habit, came to be revealed to the knowledge of
the world, she vowed by some means or other to become her own executioner, as a
bloody testimony of her absolute chaste intentions; in the mean time, she told
him, to satisfy his pleasures, he was too cruel to exact from her such
desperate conditions.

Narcissus, scarce hearing what she said, being transported with such a joy, as
religious men use to possess in ecstasies, not only having broken through the
discovery, but in being so beyond his hopes accepted, began to grow bold in
his felicity, in so much as he could not forbear, to imprint loves character
upon her fair lips, until she in a grave disdain, to be so assaulted by his
presumption, not only commanded him in a severe look to keep at a farther
distance, but withal told him, that he had already so exceedingly provoked her
just anger, that it was capable to destroy those small sparkles of love, which
charity had kindled in her compassionate bosom; And with that hastily rose
from her seat, with such another blush, as inflamed Diana's bashful modesty,
to become cruelly revengefull; which presently turned the youth, into an
immovable posture, scarce knowing whether he breathed or no. The sudden coming
of Roxana to seek the Princess gave no time at all for expostulation, that
absolutely left Narcissus to converse only with his own despair, since she
and her Governesse went presently to visit the sick Queen.

However the Princess Cloria, though she used not those familiarities with her
play-fellow Aminta, (being over jealous of her own honor) as she was
accustomed, yet she forbore not still to command her service upon all
occasions, and with gentle smiles would often show, she was not unrecoverably
displeased with her, for her late passionate attempt, though she totally
avoided her company in private; which was the reason that frequently she and
Roxana, would walk to a certain cliffe by the Sea side, where was a grove of
Cypres trees, that afforded a convenient shade, to protect their conversation
from the Sun or Winds violence; whilst in the mean time they might with what
liberty they pleased, behold the ships that entered the Haven not far off
that place. And this delight, one day above the rest, not only invited the
Princess Cloria, in the cool of the day to the accustomed recreation; but
caused her to desire her Governess that she would hear her play of her Lute,
to try whether by the occasion of her journey, she had not for want of
practice, lost that little skill she formerly had; which being accompanied by
her excellent voice, that uttered this Ditty, in a manner ravished the old
woman into a humor of Platonic love, since her years were scarce capable of
other heat: Love to perfection does aspire,
When Lovers melt without a fire;
And purely join,
Their wills in one,
All grosser actions to refine.
Such contracts made, as these, may be
Esteemed a blessed unity,
Since hearts will kiss,
In happiness,
As by some influence divine.
Thus may we court with tongue and eyes,
And enterchange delight in smiles;
Yet never own
Those pleasures known,
That beasts, as well as we may prize.
For whilst we do but thus embrace,
The beauties of a mind or face,
We only woe,
As spirits do,
In raptures more to sympathise.
If that two Lutes be tuned alike,
As we the strings of either strike,
Every ear
Will quickly hear,
The other answer to the sound.
So Lovers should accorded be,
By such a powerful mystery,
That never they
Should do or say,
But what reciprocal were found.


Roxana after the song was ended, to show she carried about with her certain
remnants of flesh and blood, fell in dispute with the Princess, about the
idleness, as she termed it, of such a pretended passion, that seem to make
conversation solely the period of lovers desires, whereas nature requires as
well a satisfaction of the body, as the mind: nor is that lawful pleasure
denied mortals (as she said) by the pure heavens, that ordained man and woman
to enjoy one another, to produce again creatures of the same kind, to people
and continue the world, which else would quickly perish. I said Cloria, but
that love which you mention, which fixes the pleasure in the body, is merely
brutish, since the soul seems not to have the principal fruition;
especially when there wants a sympathy in the contemplative part, that ought to
render it divine; divine said Roxana, how can it be so termed? when it was
instituted to procure humane effects, for else you might as well place your
affections upon your sister, as upon the servant you love, who may perhaps
equal him in all other respects, but in the Sex only: and what serves the
diversity of the Sexes, but to perform those actions, which one of your own
Sex cannot accomplish? nay, put case, said Roxana, that you were fitted with a
companion, that had all perfections in his soul, that might render your mind
and conversation satisfied, yet if his body were either aged or deformed, I
pray consider what delight you would take in such society? It is true said
Cloria, because naturally we take pleasure in beauty, which would not appear
in a person of that condition, and so consequently could not content the eye
that is a sense also curious to be satisfied. Why then Madam said she, I will
only make this comparison, to confute all your forced arguments so much
against your conscience: put case my Lord Narcissus, whom I know you love with
all your heart, were by some miraculous decree, to be turned into a beautiful
Maid, would not you be sorry in your soul at the conversion, although he
retained still the same faculties in his mind, of wit, judgment, and
goodness? With that Cloria bl^sht, yet not so much because she found her self
overcome in that which touched her to the quick, but because at the instant,
she reflected upon the metamorphosis of Aminta, who so lively represented the
comparison, although ignorantly alleged by the old woman; but what answer it
would have produced, cannot be known, for they were both interrupted, by the
sudden appearing, (contrary to their expectation, and to their no small
amazement) of an unseemly company of Mariners and Sea Soldiers, who as
quickly (with a silent horror and an unresistible power) seized the persons of
Cloria and Roxana, and after some small circumstance carried them, into a
little shipboat lying near the shore, which as speedily as they could, they
p^t from Land with long Poales, until they had set it free, as they conceived
from all surprise of the neighboring Island; during which interim, Cloria was
too much overcome with fear and trembling, either to understand what they did,
or to enquire what they meant, until she was sufficiently awakened out of her
Trance by a more lamentable object: for she might behold her poor Governesse,
lying bound in a miserable posture at the lower end of the boat, ready as she
heard by their discourses, to be suddenly flung overboard, because as they
pretended, they were unwilling to burden themselves with an unnecessary
encumbrance, not daring to put to Land again to set her on shore, for fear
of being apprehended; besides they were in doubt, if flee should be returned to
the Island, she might be a means of their pursuit in discovering their
robbery.

Wherefore Cloria, without any regard at all of her Dignity, or care of those
dainty limbs that were natures perfect workmanship, flew suddenly from the
place where she was, as if her abundant compassion, had made her altogether
insensible of her present misfortune; and violently breaking through the ring
of those people, which stood about one that seemed by his gesture, but not by
his apparel, to be in more authority then the rest, and casting her self upon
her knees, with many t^ares uttered this language:

If ever you tasted the milk of woman toward your education? if ever you
honored that Sex for your mothers sake that bare you? if you can be less
cruel to humanity because your selves live? or if you intend the Gods shall
ever show mercy unto you in this world or in the next, leave off your barbarous
resolution against this aged woman, whom nature her self without more
violence, must needs e're long destroy: but if your harsh dispositions cannot
be mollified, by a Virgins prayers, let me first be sacrificed, that mine eyes
may not behold the wretched destruction of my dear fostermother, who from my
infancy has brought me up with respectfull love, having often preserved me
from many dangers by her diligent care. And this being said, she poured forth
a shower of tears, as a charitable testimony that her heart accompanied her
words in the request.

The barbarous Judge of Roxana's life, seeing himself entreated by so sweet an
Advocate, and with a humility answerable to his own rude pride, which rather
mollified his Tigers bosom, then persuaded his reason to become humane, after
some pawse, in imperious words bid her rise; then having consulted with the
rest of his companions, he told her that her suite was granted, so far as to
have a reprieve for her Governesse, until they were both presented unto the
Admiral of their Fleet, who lay not at any great distance from that place,
expecting their speedy return, which would determine as he said his own
Commission, since he was only put in command to execute the service he had
already performed; And with that gave direction to have the boat hasted to the
ships, which was accomplished within an hours space, though before their
arrival the Sun had already hid his face below the horizon, as if ashamed to
behold so great a misfortune. The Princess Cloria was quickly brought into the
Captains Cabin, where himself sitting upon his bed, scarce rose to give her a
civil salutation; however, she being more mindful of Roxana's danger, then of
her own unhappiness, presently begged the life and releasement of her
Governesse; which gave an occasion to the proud Admiral, not only something
to compassionate her earnestness, but to be more inflamed with her beauty; and
these thoughts continued him some time in a silent muse, until of a sudden he
brake out into this language: Is it possible the earth can produce such
becoming perfections in sorrow? and with that presently commanded not only the
old woman to be absolutely released from her bonds, but to be forthwith
returned to accompany her mistress, where he left them both in his own
lodging, whilst himself went to give some necessary order in the ships.

Cloria, although she was something satisfied, to have again the conversation
of her Governesse, whom she esteemed almost lost, yet (considering the
miserable estate she was in, to be under the power of such a barbarous
captivity; separated in this violent way from the protection of her dear
mother, who could not as she conceived, but almost die with sorrow and grief,
when she should either be advertised of the particulars of her misfortune, or
not know what was become of her;) began this complaint: Alas Cloria, said she,
what have been thy offenses to the immortal Gods, to plunge thee in these
exquisite miseries, not possible in a manner to be suffered by humane nature?
was it not sufficient to be separated from thy father and Country, wherein
thou enjoyedst both safety and honor, being condemned as it were, in the
company of thy mother, to a voluntary banishment, rather then endure the
affronts of thy fathers persecutors? but of a sudden, to be deprived of that
joy was only left thee, and be cast into a power more cruel then Tigers, and
more inhumane then wild people? And with this wrung her delicate hands, with
such expressions of passion, that Roxana was forced for some time to leave her
thoughts, whereby to apply remedies to her Mistress grief.

Madam, said she, if the Gods could at any time be justly taxed for their
permission of injuries upon innocents, certainly at this present they merit
reproof beyond example, since the wrong is done to so high a goodness as the
world again can scarce parallel; but seeing their inscrutable decrees are not
to be searched into by weak mortality, without such a reverence as must only
pray for redress, it is far more available to our present condition, to
consider with patience what is best to be done, then to seem rebellious to
their wills, in not well suffering what cannot be otherwise prevented, which at
leastwise may bring with it forgiveness of our sins, if not consolation of
our punishments; since for the most part afflictions in this world, are only
sent us to correct our stubborn natures, making us more fit for the Gods
mercier; and not absolutely to destroy us, by rendering us subjects for their
severe justice; for truly, as I cannot believe; but that they have reserved
for your goodness a particular protection; so of the other side, I am
confident, that when the chastisement, or rather I may say the trial of your
singular virtues, is past, the instruments of your present punishment, will be
cast into the fire, and you not at all prejudiced by the suffering, unless you
prove more obstinate, or impatient, then you should be. Besides, you ought to
consider, you are Euarchus daughter, a Prince of such excellent parentage and
blood, that the least dejection of spirit, notwithstanding the greatest
misfortune, would degenerate you from your birth and education; and yet no way
lessen the misery of your captivity; though I would not have your quality come
to the knowledge of these inhumane Pirates; for augmenting the price of your
redemption, since covetousness is the only deity they serve, and the sole
period of their pains; wherefore, I beseech you to put off so much of your
confused grief, that may preserve your health, and render you more capable of
counsel, whereby we may the better study your safety, and both our freedoms:
and with that took her in her arms, where she held her, until her loving
endeavors had rockt her into a quiet slumber, which continued for most part of
the night: by this Roxana had liberty in the mean time, the better to converse
with her own wit and judgment, how to find means for their speedy delivery:
sometimes she thought, of presenting those Jewels they had concealed about them
to the Admiral; th^n to dispatch speedily a messenger into Cyprus, to give
notice of their condition: But as the first seemed dangerous, by reason it
would stir up greater appetites, of further gain in the covetous Captain,
and never a whit the more secure their liberty; so the other, as she thought,
would never be granted by his suspicion, for fear of being discovered, and
consequently pursued by some great fleet; These things continued her thoughts
in a perplexed intricacy until the next night following, when Roxana began a
little to close her eyes, being tired with too much care and watching, that she
might suddenly perceive a woman by the help of a burning lamp, softly stealing
into the Cabin, whose face spoke beauty, though her looks pretended horror;
which accompanied with the uncouthnesse of the season, at leastwise so
interpreted by her fearful apprehension, gave her sufficient cause of doubt of
some ill intentions, either to her self or Cloria: But the party quickly
finding by Roxana's countenance, a suspicion of her meaning, abruptly saluted
her in this manner; after she had seated her self upon a little form, opposite
to her beds head.

Lady, said she, although you may put on wonder at my seeming preposterous
approach, yet I should be sorry to procure your disturbance by my presence,
since my intention is to do you acceptable service, though I am now designed
to a worse end; but first you must understand my unhandsome story, for your
more confidence: Then know, I am a Syrian born; and being, some years past in
my fathers house, a rich Merchant of Damascus, I fell in love with a Gentleman
of the same Town, of no great possessions; however, my passion continued so
violent, that I was resolved, against the good will of all my friends, to make
him my husband; in prosecution of which, without much circumstance, we watched
an opportunity to crown our affections, by enjoying one another, before the
ceremonious rights belonging to sacred marriage, were performed in Plymens
Temple; which perhaps too much exasperated the Gods, and caused my misfortunes:
For being careless to delude the watchful and spightfull spies, of the house
of my father, one night when we least looked for his presence, he was brought
to be an eyewitness of our imbracements; at which sight, my lover being
possessed with a desperate rage to be so surprised, suddenly leapt out of his
naked bed, to prevent his own apprehension, since the fact was no less then
death in him, by the rigid and unkind laws of Syria; but being stopped at the
door, by my fathers fury, he quickly flew to the protection of his sword,
that was not far off his unhappy reach; and seeing by no entreaty he could
persuade passage, he made forcible way through my fathers life, so escaped all
their endeavors, by his present flight; which, as you may believe, was a
sufficient torment to my perplexed mind, for that every ballad of the Town
sung my shame, and my Lovers cruelty; and this quickly caused me to seek
another habitation, though the wealth that was left me, as being heir, might
in some sort have bought my quiet. With these thoughts I put to sea, carrying
along with me such movables, as I could handsomely dispose of to that purpose,
with an intention if it were possible, in this posture to find out the abode
of my banished Lover; or else, in some unknown place to set up the station of
mine own rest. But my unhappy Fates, rather reflecting upon my former crime,
then my present misery, never left persecuting me with contrary winds and
storms, until they put me into the absolute possession of these merciless
Pirates, where ever since I have lived, the abused strumpet of the Captains
lust, though flattered always, not only with the hope, but promise of a
speedy marriage; these protestations, continued me until now, reasonably well
satisfied: but since your surprizall, you must know, he has cast his burning
affection upon the more rare beauty of the Princess Cloria, though he dares not
openly own the love, because there is so strong a faction in the ship against
the design; for that they put on a resolution to present the Lady to Osirus,
the Kings son of Egypt, whereby the better to procure their own pardons, for
those robberies they have committed upon his shore, having been in time past
his natural subjects: to this purpose, the better to compass, though to
color his desire, he has employed me as an instrument to your self,
supposing you have an absolute interest with the Princess, to persuade her, by
a disguise he will provide, to convey her self to morrow night, out of this
ship into another of more fidelity, which shall carry her to a Castle belonging
to his command; from whence he vows, though untruly, she shall be returned
safe to her friends and country; pretending he neither dares trust her, or
himself, in the Egyptian power. But I, finding he has an intention to deal
false with me, after my dishonor, I have also deceived him, and made some of
the contrary faction, acquainted with his passions; who will be sure to prevent
his purposes, since they do not only hate him, for his injustice toward
themselves, in distributing unequally those booties, which have been from time
to time gotten by Pyracy; but now in seeking to hinder, by his private love, so
fortunate an occasion to procure all their pardons. Scarce had she delivered
thus much, but the Captain, like some furious wild beast (having overheard
her discourse, by a private whispering place, he had out of his own lodging,
into the other Cabine where Cloria rested) came into the room with his sword
drawn, first killing the woman with his looks, and after forced the weapon to
perform the rest; which not only suddenly awakened the sweet Princess, but
with horror of the spectacle, soon forced Roxana out of the Cabine with
fearful shreekes, that presently with a confused distraction called up all the
company in the ship.

In the mean time, whilst all of them, were laying hold of such weapons as came
next to their hands, to defend themselves against they knew not what danger,
the Captain addressed him to the amazed Princess, in this language: Lady, said
he, you see here plainly the force of love, that can remove any obstacle that
does oppose it; since the punishment of this treacherous woman, by my just
hand, is a sufficient testimony of my violent affection. But poor Cloria was
so far from understanding what he meant, (apprehending also the horrid
spectacle of the dead body, which lay before her eyes) that instead of making
him any reply tending to his satisfaction, she showed him her naked breast,
wishing him to dispatch her presently, that she might not undergo many
torments by his cruelty. The captain of the other side, being transported with
that taking object, instantly flung away his sword, and kneeling down by her
bed, as if he intended to sacrifice to some Deity, gently fixed a kiss, with
his impure lips, upon that more then white Altar; continuing in that posture,
until Roxana's cries had brought to the door many of the Pirates; who, with a
tumultuous noise, not only entered, but finding the dead carcass of the
slaughtered woman, and also the suspected demeanor of the Admiral, by reason
of that information they had formerly received of the dead Strumpet, concerning
his private love to the Princess Cloria, suddenly threatened him with this
language: Villain, said they, was it not enough injustice in thee, to have
oftentimes, by thy imperious commands, defrauded us of the equal distribution
of such prizes we had gotten at Sea? but to endeavor also to deceive us of our
hopes of our pardons, by the ravishment of the fair Princess, which is a
present we intend to Osirus, to redeem our lives and liberties, and render us
again possessors of our native Country, from whence we have been so long
banished, under thy proud jurisdiction.

The Captain, being not able to support this sharp reproof from his base
vassals, of a sudden leapt to his sword that lay upon the ground, and when he
had it in his hand, flew amongst them like a Tiger, calling to his aid such in
the ship as were faithful to his faction, which ere long procured a most
bloody encounter; for what the Admirals party wanted in number, they supplied
in courage, so that the fight a great while seemed to be equal; wherein the
uncouthnesse of the season, added horror to the slaughters; augmented also by
the cries of dying and wounded persons, with the whistling of the winds, that
appeared to contend with the seas in a new combat; but at last, the Captain
himself being slain, a sudden despair seized the remaining company, in so
much as they all either fled to seek refuge into dark corners of the ship, or
yielded to the mercy of the conquerours; who putting the head of their late
Lord upon a Spear, crying Liberty, showed it to the people of the other
vessels, not far off; and presently sent a messenger, not only to inform
them of their proceedings, and just judgment against their tyrannical master,
but to desire a conference, how they might best dispose of their affairs to
procure all their pardons.

During the conflict, the Princess Cloria, as it were transported beyond all
degrees of amazement, rather conceived her self to be in a terrible dream,
then the beholder of such inhumane actions, lay as it were without motion,
until Roxana, who had newly broke through the confused crowd, came into the
Cabine to give her dear Lady some consolation. After she had a little driven
away her fears, and comforted her hopes with courageous language, she not
only recounted unto her all the particulars of the fight, and the occasion
thereof, but informed her of the resolution of the Pirates, which was,
instantly to convey her into Egypt, and put her into the protection of Osirus.

Cloria, when she had spent some time in tears, sighs, and silence, at last
uttered these words: O Roxana, said she, we may perceive that the gods are
angry with us, and therefore the success of our fortunes cannot be but
doubtful; however, we may be delivered from this barbarous captivity, and
committed into more Noble hands; for I fear that Osirus will never forget, the
injuries that have been done unto him, for the loss of his great fleet upon
the Ionian shore, though my father himself was betrayed to the action; nor
forbear with violence to solicit his old proposed love, by my Grandmother
Queen Anaxia; which either must absolutely destroy my intentions to poor
Narcissus, or put me in some desperate prevention; since his thoughts cannot be
so low, as to suffer himself to be undervalued, by a captive that he has in
his power; upon which ground, I suppose the Pirates have taken their
resolutions. These were reasons sufficient to have converted Roxana, although
she had been of another opinion; however, being more willing to apply balm,
then corrasives, to the wound that was already made, only returned her answers
of hope, and not replies of despair to entertain her imagination, until the
thieves resolutions, within two days and a nights sail, the winds seeming in
the mean time to play with their intentions, had brought them safely into the
river of Nilus, and so consequently soon landed them, with their rich prize, at
the City of Memphis, where Osirus the Prince, then kept his Court.

But the Heavens being not pleased that so valuable a Jewel, should be the
price to buy the redemption of so vile offenders, the Pirates, were presently
apprehended, and not only in recompense of their many robberies, but also of
their late murder committed, without form of Law upon their Captain, were put
to death with several torments, as an example of terror to their imitators;
whilst in the mean time the Princess Cloria, was with all honor conveyed to
lodgings prepared for her in the Castle.

Yet one day, being alone with Roxana, and reflecting not only upon the horrid
danger she had past, when she was in the absolute power of the rude Pirates;
but considering what a heaven of felicity, her outward sense seemed to be
acquainted withal, now she was in the glorious Palace of Osirus, King almost
of all Aphrica, where every one appeared ready to comply with her pleasure, as
she understood by the command of their great master, she could not but with
some pensiveness, think upon the sudden change of her fortune; for weighing
the ticklishnesse of her own state, that had in so short a time, woven her
thoughts and loves, into so many hopes and fears, it began to raise in her some
doubt of her yet safety; and considering that the Egyptians had received too
many affronts, to be heartily affected to the Lydians, she could interpret
Osirus kindness but two ways: either that he bore a Noble mind, beyond
example, notwithstanding her Countries seeming injuries; or else, that he had
some underhand design to compass, which made him gild over his intentions
with an outward humanity, whereby the better to obtain his ends, or render his
revenge more terrible; which at last made her break through her silence, by
this discourse to her Governesse.

What the gods have determined of us Roxana, said she, their only divine
wisdoms must measure out in time, and we with patience and reverence are to
attend the issue of their decrees; for if in any kind they seem to smile upon
our condition, we should entertain the blessings with a joyful humility,
rather using them as necessary refreshments of humane nature, then esteeming
them determinable substances of our absolute happiness, since pleasures here
are neither perfect in their delights, nor certain in their continuance: so of
the other side, if rough misfortunes at any time, overwhelme that calm which we
covet, we ought piously to take them as deserved chastisements, to keep under
the proud rebellions of our perverse nature (that else might swell to our
perpetual destruction) sent rather to cure our deseases, then to increase our
maladies; and in this consideration, no doubt, we may safely walk, in all the
various accidents of the inferior world: however, though reason dictates to
our understanding, this just and religious course, yet we cannot be without all
natural and humane passion. Wherefore, as in the first place, with some joy we
may consider Roxana, this unexpected change of entertainment; from a horrid
captivity amongst thieves, to a most civil honor in Osirus Court; for though
the one had no cause, but gain, to make them our enemies; yet the other has
reason, by received injuries, not to be our friends: so of the other side, I
must confess, an undigested lump of suspicion, seems to oppress my fearful
thoughts, what may be the intention of our fates: though, I vow by the
immortal Gods, rather to show an exemplary hate upon my own life, then consent
to give away that faith I have determined to absent Narcissus; and with those
words, a sweet shower of tears burst from the heaven of her eyes, capable to
teach the earth a new beauty in sorrow, silently enriching her handkerchiefe
with the pearls that fell; which gave occasion to Roxana (after she had some
time with a little seeming admiration weighed the discreet Rhetoric of the
Princess) to return her this answer.

Madam, said she, though I cannot believe the gods have any other
determination, then the absolute prosperity of your virtuous self, since they
cannot place their benefits upon a more deserving subject; yet oftentimes they
are pleased to mix their mercies with chastisements; not only to render us
more capable of their favors, by possessing us with humble souls, but also by
that means to make them taste better when we receive them to their honor. For
as the works of the divine Creator are wonderful in their effects, so they
ought to be grateful in their reception, since they proceed from an omnipotent
goodness; and if at any time they appear to us, either vain, or unjust, it is
the ignorant indulgence of our own frailty, that makes us either falsely
interpret them, or passionately wish them otherwise: for as humane nature loves
it self best, and therefore consequently covets its own satisfaction, above
all other things; so of the other side, the great God that made us only for
his glory, will not admit, of such a rebellion in our thoughts and actions to
be unpunished, much less to be rewarded; and therefore he puts oftentimes a
stop to our idle desires, by a sharp restriction of our wills, when they swell
beyond the bounds of duty and thankfulness toward him, that of nothing formed
us, and can make us worse when he pleases; for the chief error of our
impatience is, that we take our selves more framed for our own sakes, then for
his service; whereas, if we would employ all our endeavors, toward the true
end of our creation, we should neither miss of an absolute reward hereafter,
nor undergo here the irksomeness of perturbations; since the intention would
inflame the mind to higher desires, then merely flesh and blood can reach unto,
that apprehend but present and sensual things. Nay further, if we do but
truly consider, how little satisfactory the best of pleasures is, as you even
now said (having neither any certainty in the enjoyment, nor perfect delight in
the fruition) man would esteem himself no other then mad, so violently to hunt
after worldly things; which Madam, I hope are arguments sufficient, both to
confirm the former part of your discourse, and to dissuade you to put in
execution the latter, if accidents should make war against your virtue. But
as her words were brought to this period, they were both informed that Osirus
was coming to visit the Princess, so that Cloria had no opportunity left her
for reply, scarce for preparation to receive such a stranger.

When Osirus entered the room, he made his approach in a formal garb,
according to the Egyptian manner; his looks putting on Majesty, though his
clothes humility, and notwithstanding he used complements in his words, yet
Cloria might find by his language, he knew he was Lord of her liberty; withal
intimating, that she received honor in being in the custody of so great a
Prince; however, it was his desire, as he said, to make her in a kind, not
only her own Jailer, but his Mistress; and with that turned his eyes upon his
followers, as if he expected an approbation, by their applause; which gave
Cloria some liberty to study for an answer, conceiving her thoughts absolutely
necessary, since the subject of his discourse, so little pleased her fearful
apprehension; wherefore after some time employed in a trembling silence, with a
humility answerable to that power he had over her person, she made him this
reply.

My Lord, said she, although I cannot but thank my fortune, for having
delivered me into so noble hands, where honor and virtue seem to be partners,
in the making up an absolute greatness in your person; yet I must needs
believe, liberty would have afforded me much more cause of content, since it is
a humane misery to be imprisoned, though it be in a golden Tower; for nothing
endued with life and motion, but certainly covets a freedom in its own
dispose, rather then to be captied of any rate; and especially man, that is
inspired with a reasonable soul, whose apprehension is its greatest torment;
and therefore delights not to be circumscribed by any power, how just or mighty
soever. But since it is my destiny to fall under that misfortune, the world, I
conceive could not have bestowed upon my condition, a more gracious and noble
Lord; and in that only I reckon my self an object of envy to other inferior
Captives, not doubting, but my continued usage, will not only confirm me still
in the same belief, but oblige me both with thanks, and prayers, to express
my gratitude for so high a favor.

This reply of the Princess so well pleased the vain humor of Osirus,
(imagining, that although she understood not altogether his meaning, yet she
had will enough to comply with his desire) that instantly he commanded all the
company out of the chamber; with an intention belike, to deliver his thoughts
more freely unto her: but she, neither knowing what he intended, nor was ever
accustomed to be left alone with strangers of a contrary sex, presently at the
apprehension grew so pale, that it was easily perceived by Osirus, that her
heart entertained some jealous fear of her honor; wherefore he caused Roxana
to stay, not only, as he said, to be a wished companion to her Mistress, but
a faithful witness of his own actions: and then turning up his mouchatos, as
a preamble to his discourse, as if he meant to gain by the posture, a mightier
esteem of his person in Clorias opinion, converted his talk to her after this
manner.

Lady, said he, as the Gods can witness the truth of my affection, so the
world can give sufficient testimony of my worth; and though, as Lord by my
power, I might command; yet, as a slave, for your sake, I am content to beg:
beg (said he) O you heavens, that I should so descend! and smiled scornfully
with these words, as if he thought he had infinitely injured his greatness, by
the Courtship, however, he went on with this language; let it suffice, said he,
that mighty Osirus loves the fairest Cloria, a beauty only worthy of that
love, that Queens have often coveted with ambition. But scarce had he
delivered thus much, when a messenger in haste entered the Chamber, and told him
that young Philos, the Nephew of Philostros had lately given an absolute
ovethrow to the Egyptian Army, in a set battle, and was now with expedition
marching toward the walls of Memphis; which misfortune, as he said, not only
required his command for direction, but his valor for prevention, since the
danger appeared too evident.

Osirus, after some time of amazement, instead of consideration, after he had a
little put off his own distractions, told Cloria, that these were but trifling
victories, to whet his invincible courage to a sharper revenge; and assured
her, his next present should be Philos head laid at her feet, as the true
witness of his valor, instead of a more proper Sacrifice to the prosperity of
their future loves. And as he continued these rodomontodos, he was intercepted
by the whole assembly of the City, who informed him it was no time to be
amorous, when Memphis was in apparent danger to be lost; which abruptly plucked
him away from his bragging Courtship, to the infinite content of poor Cloria;
supposing her self hy this means, freed from the plague of her thoughts, since
she imagined, this accident would give Osirus endeavors sufficient employment,
and hinder him from entertaining his fancies, with those desires she was
resolved he should never enjoy. Yet Roxana, apprehending still a dark cloud of
trouble to hang over their heads, by reason of Osirus seeming passion, or at
least pretended love; after a grave silence, in reproof of Cloria's too much
joy, gave her Mistress advice in this sort, the better to prepare her against
another encounter.

Although this hateful Lover, said she, be a torment to your thoughts, and his
expressions be no other then treasons against the love you bear Narcissus;
yet, such is the necessity of the time, and the power of your captivity, that
either you must force your will to comply with Osirus, if he prosecute his
affections, or dissemble so far your intentions, as to give him some hope of
your consent; for it is not to be doubted, but this Prince is as high in his
pride, as mighty in his command, which may at last fly to a desperate
requital, if he should be any way scornfully rejected; since it is evident,
his people have taken notice of his endeavors, not only by the first
proposition, which was the occasion of your Grandmothers journey into Lydia,
that so much exasperated your fathers subjects; but in his now intimation of
his desires, before his servants, with such extravagant vain glory; and how
easy it is for him to have pretexts for any cruelty he shall use, may be
considered in these particulars; First, for your fathers disdainful refusing
of his Aunt, after the marriage was in a manner concluded; and lastly the loss
he sustained upon the Ionian shore, by the destruction of the supposed
invincible Fleet, he sent to reduce Cyprus again under his obedience. Wherefore
be assured, if you disgrace him by an absolute refusal, he will strive to
dishonor you by an equal violence, when both the object and the opportunity
give him the occasion, not to be avoided by your industry; and love, when it is
once converted into hate, by contrary accidents, procures for the most part,
sad and dismal examples of revenge; since the passions, as they are most
opposite, so are they equally violent, and one seeking to drive out another,
cannot but produce strong operations, like the nature of Lightning or
Earthquakes, that do not only contend most forcibly against obstacles, but
are engendered merely by dissentions amongst the elements. Wherefore, my opinion
is, that for the present you give way to the fury of his flames, if love be the
occasion of his Courtship; which not being disdeined, but gently tempered, may
in time be qualified, especially when those great businesses he has now in
hand, shall draw away his thoughts to more necessary employments. And if it be
pride that swells up his resolutions to make you his wife, because he will not
be refused in any thing he shall demand, certainly the humor must not be
resisted, until you have convenience to free your self from his jurisdiction,
which perhaps may quickly be effected by the issue of these wars; in the mean
time your humility and seeming estimation of his worth, will abate the vanity
of those fumes, when it shall appear, by some dissembling, complements you may
use, you are so far off from contemning his offered affection, that you do
not think your self worthy of the honor; however, you cannot want excuses to
protract his hasty desires, in requiring leisure, not only to render you an
absolute lover of his person, as well as the admirer of his greatness; but
also, to send to your friends, as a necessary circumstance belonging to your
duty and modesty, whose consents you must not seem to doubt, since the alliance
conduces so much to your advantage; however, the frantic people of Lydia
seemed so stubbornly to oppose the first propositions; All which probably will
satisfy him for the present, and win time, till either the siege constrain
him to render you, with the Town into the hands of Orsames your uncle; or the
gods by some other means, be mercifully pleased to provide conveniences for
your escape.

However, Cloria was scarce contented with counsel, whereby to show her self
so great an hypocrite in her love; yet the war, in the mean time, took up the
employments of Osirus, that he had not leisure, or at leastwise will to
importune the Princess, to her no small satisfaction; for he endeavored by
frequent sallies to hinder the approaches of the enemy, which brought on
oft-times, most bloody and desperate encounters; wherein the particular valors
of many brave Knights appeared to the worlds admiration: This not only
continued the siege with a doubtful expectation, but at last compelled Orsames
in person, with a new power to strengthen his party; Osirus, after he had
valiantly defended the Town for some months, resolved by a general sally,
either to dislodge the Syrians from being so near a neighbor to the walls, or
to perish in the attempt. Wherefore, one night, having before acquainted the
chief Commanders with his design, and given a false alar^m to the adversaries
camp, he issued out of the Town with most of the Nobility; in which posture he
set upon Philostros quarters, with so much violence and courage, that he not
only committed a slaughter worthy of such a resolution, but had infallibly
taken the Favorite prisoner, if he had not been prevented, by the valor of a
Knight in white armor, who defended his tent with so much courage, that both
his forces were repulsed, and himself in danger to be slain, since he lost
his headpiece in the conflict: which notwithstanding added wings to the
fierceness of the fight; for both parties, enflamed with the desire of
victory, the one to make good the progress they had industriously made in the
Syrian Army; and the other to regain what they had, as they conceive,
shamefully lost, appeared desperate of their lives; the horror was also
increased by the darkness of the night, leaving no convenience for defense;
and this, in like manner became augmented, by the accidental burning of
O^sames Camp, in regard the soldiers had no leisure to quench the fire, for
the hard employment the Egyptians gave them. These accidents called forth, in
a manner, the whole power of Memphis; supposing the siege had been finished, by
the seeming success of their party, leaving only the women in the interim to
guard the walls: but Philostros, finding the desperate condition of the Kings
Army, if a prevailing resistance were not made; when he had secured Orsames
person by a strong guard, he commanded upon pain of death, that no man should
employ his endeavors to extinguish the fire in the Camp, since, as he thought,
it had been kindled by some traitors in the army, to give his soldiers
employment, whilst the enemy might become victorious; yet he promised them all
reparation in their losses, after they had valiantly repulsed the Egyptians;
who, as he said, were but a handful of men in comparison of Orsames powerful
Army: with these words, and the assembly of many brave Troops to attend upon
his person, he suddenly assailed Osirus, as it were triumphing in his success,
in so much as he was forced to give back, with a greater slaughter then was
convenient for his purpose, or the defense of the Town, though he supposed that
night to have made an end of the siege; for finding that not only his
expectation was deceived, but his fortunes began to change, he caused the
retreat to be sounded, the rather because the approaching day, as he conceived,
would endanger the loss of his whole forces, since the enemy far out-numbred
his power, having no disadvantage but the night season. Osiris, being again
retired within the walls of Memphis, and having taken a general muster of his
people: by which he found himself incapable of more sallies, he resolved from
thence forward, only to defend the bulwarks, with his best policy; whilst in
the mean time, Orsames also fell to the spade: which not only proved something
tedious to many brave spirits of both sides, but gave occasion of diverse
private combats, wherein were performed acts of honor and delight; though it
was noised in the Town, the white Knight that had disarmed Osirus, appeared to
be the most perfect Cavaliere.

The Princess Cloria, that had now a long time been happily freed from the
unpleasant Courtship of Osirus, retired for her more delight one day into a
private Gallery belonging to her own lodgings, which was furnished with so many
rare pieces, that the diversity of objects, could not but give employment and
recreation to the most dull eyes, much more to those that were beautified with
so much natural curiosity, as hers were: she had not before this had any
knowledge of the place, being only persuaded thither by the importunity of a
seeming officious servant, that belike had only the protection of the room;
who presently notwithstanding left her alone, to converse privately with her
own delights. The first picture proved a subject for her serious consideration,
for it was the doleful representation of the Story of Philomela's ravishment,
by her unnatural and cruel brother in law; wherein she not only with two or
three sad sighs, seemed to compassionate the injured Lady; but with a little
apprehension, reflected upon her own state, being also in the power of an
inflamed Lover; whilst she remained, as it were, transported with diversity of
thoughts, that were capable to disquiet the gentle bosom of a young virgin, of
a sudden she might hear one to unlock a certain secret door behind her, which
till then she had not perceived to be in that part of the Gallery; so that the
fears that formerly had been engendered in her imagination by the pitiful
object she beheld, increased in her being without any manner of company; and
this gave her, as she believed, not only cause to wish her self In her own
chamber, but to be absolutely suspicious of her present safety, since she knew
not well where she was; though her terror was grounded upon no other reason,
then such as children use to have when they go in the dark, imagining every
noise to be some frightfull thing. But long she had not expected the issue, in
the mean time making haste to the door where she had entered, but she became
distractedly satisfied, of what she most doubted; for Osirus appeared suddenly
to her view, like some horrid vision; apparrelled in black, that threa^ned by a
confused apprehension, a sad Omen to her present condition; yet his habit was
beset with diverse Diamonds, resembling so many Stars, that endeavored to
give light to a dark Firmament.

The Princess, as I said, thus surprised, by him she most feared, when she
thought her self freest from all interruption, it was a question whether doubt
or amazement laid strongest hold of her senses; though the last passion at
length obtained the greater prerogative, by her too much consideration; so that
she remained like Pigmalions beautiful image, that wanted both life and
motion: Thus fixed she stood, until Osirus (after some time of seeming
admiration of her perfections, which he used as a fitting complement) began to
make his addresses, as to a fair statue; but she, as it were, carried only
with a certain instinct of hatred, or at leastwise dislike, (since for the
present she had lost her chief faculties o^ reason, that should have managed
her comportment) strived as fast to retire backward, until his too hasty
pursuit, compelled her to make use of her dainty legs, to avoid his
importunity; like the flying Daphne from Apollo, which for some space afforded
a delightful spectacle, if any had been there to have beheld it, seeing the
grave Prince with earnestness chase the fearful Lady; though he thought it a
derogation to his dignity, to haste his steps much beyond the custom of his
usual walk, for that it was the fashion of his Country, to seem moderate in
every trivial affair; this was an occasion that the course lasted longer then
ordinary, since, as he was determined, not to be wrought out of his pace, by
the provocations of any passion; so was she constrained to endure his leisure,
for that all the doors of the room denied her passage, to prevent his pursuit.
In this manner they continued, until poor Cloria had lost that breath, that
should have still defended her from being made a proy to his intended
Courtship: but he now having her in his absolute possession, first arrested her
by the fair hand, as a testimony he had a further commission to impart unto
her, and then began to entertain her ears with amorous language,
notwithstanding it was the worst charm he could use, to bring her within the
compass of his Circle; wherefore, before he could utter many words upon that
unwelcome theme (in witness, ^s he pretended, of his burning love) he might
^^ele that curious hand, which in its right tem^er, seemed at every touch to
melt into a thou^^nd beauties, of a sudden became cold, like the ^^oldest Ice;
and such a shivering also he found to possess her fair body, that he thought
it was high time to apply real remedies, rather then to continue vain
professions. So that, presently taking her in his arms, almost distracted,
between his own love and her danger, he never left tormenting her in that
manner, until he had again brought her in some sort to her self, which made
her look upon him with those two admirable lights, (though yet they had not
recovered their former luster) as if she accused his cruelty, for this last
part of his care, in seeking to preserve her life, more then for the former act
of her unjust imprisonment, since she conceived his intention was only to
reserve her for a worse end; and then presently shut them again, as if she both
feared, and loathed his sight; withal uttering these words, that she hoped the
gods would yet protect her innocent honor against his wild l^st. But Osirus
now having found out the secret of her disease, by her expresson; to take from
her all occasion of suspicion, he vowed by all the Deities of Heaven, he had
for the present no intention to use violence.

Cloria, although she was now prettily well revived, since it was impossible
for that extremity long to endure; and also something confident, that his
intention at that time only pretended to make love; yet not knowing perfectly
how to construe his words, that seemed to imply some reservation in his
thoughts; besides, having been formerly instructed by Roxana's counsels,
against any desperate denial, or discourteous language, thought best to comply
at the present with his humor for her better safety; and therefore gave him
most humble thanks for the assurance that her honor should be preserved by his
goodness; which, as she said, was the most noble testimony of his love, he
could use to a poor virgin, now altogether under his powerful protection.
Osirus, not only joyful that he had recovered the Princess out of her sound,
but proud that her words sounded love to his ears, imagining he had got an
entire victory over her thoughts, however some small basfulnesse ptoceeded from
her modest nature, which he liked the better, were obstacles to hinder the open
expressions, after the lively red began again to paint those more then fair
cheeks, he took her by the hand, and led her softly to a Couch-chaire at the
upper end of the gallery, there to repose her self until her distempers were
absolutely over: When she was sat, and himself seated near her, he began to
woe her with all his power, vowing her to be the only mistress of his
thoughts, in the way of marriage, though the style of his language had the
resemblance more of a commanding Emperor, then of a begging Lover; yet to turn
the feared Tragedy, to a perfect Comedy, he suddenly rose from the place where
he was, and pursued all her senses in so antic a manner, with his looks,
professions, and actions, that it might have given sufficient cause of delight
to Cloria, if if her heart had been capable of the entertainment of any mirth;
but it did not work from her countenance the least lovely smile, since her
melancholy thoughts were laid asleep in the bed, both of an apprehended danger,
and of a despairing sorrow, which cast a kind of a black cloud over all her
beauty, though it had not yet the power to obscure the fair feature of her
face, but rather, as a dark foil seemed to give them luster in the taking
apprehension of Osirus; but whether so or no persuaded, because himself was
the chief occasion of the overmuch shadow, it might be a question difficult to
determine; however he was absolutely convinced in his opinion, that the bright
rays of his own splendour, had sufficiently conquered the mayds affection,
which procured from him this discourse.

Sweet Cloria (for so I must call you, said he, since my heart desires there,
and in that name, to take up its principal habitation) although I intend to
lay nothing to your charge, but my love, yet, to let you see the better your
own obligations to me for it, I must wish you to consider the many injuries
which the Egyptians have received from the disaffections of the Lydian: not
only in the disrespectfull refusal of our alliance, by your father, in his
marriage: but in regard of the unparalleld loss of our great fleet upon the
Ionian coast, when faithful assurance was given for its preservation. And
lastly, the spightfull entertainment of Queen Anaxia, by your people, when she
came with propositions of a match between our selves; so that, if you should
now also obstinately contradict my purposes, I might very well judge, you
harbored the same hatred in your soul, against our illustrious house, since I
am assured my person must needs merit your best affection; and with these
words, knitting his brows, he walked two or three turns up and down the room,
sometimes setting both his hands upon his sides, and then again lifting up his
mucha^os, with a furious gravity; in so much as poor Cloria began again to
tremble. But Osirus, perceiving her apprehensions troubled, quickly told her,
she need not fea^, since both her sex, and his own love, were powerful
protections to keep her safe; for the one, as he said, concerned his honor, as
the other did his affection: yet, he let her know, that in requital of this
good, he expected from her the speedy consent of a greater good, which was to
be the wife of mighty Osirus, for whose love the fairest and greatest Queens of
the world had offered Kingdoms.

Cloria, however she found the vanity of Osirus pride to to transcend almost
all belief, for which she the more disdained him inwardly; yet considering she
was in the absolute power of one whose passions might soon determine her fate,
thought it the safest way, for the present, exactly to follow her Governesses
direction, whereby to prevent the danger of her life, and honor more dear
then that, not withstanding his glorious professions, which her apprehensive
nature durst not trust; and the rather, for that she conceived he did not
mention his received injuries without some intention either of fruition or
revenge; Wherefore after a long pause, as if she borrowed leave of modesty to
speak her bashful thoughts, she uttered these words.

My Lord, said she, as a captive to your will (which, however my fortune has
made me, and not my crime) it might appear a kind of madness in me, to seen
to resist your desire, muchlesse to dispute those injuries that you say you
have received from the Lydian State; especially, when I am invited to a free
consent of marriage a Noble way, by all the reasons that can promise me a happy
condition hereafter; since there is such a concurrence of beauty, valor and
greatness, accompanied with so many other verrues in your admired person, to
make you not only Lord of me, but reverenced of all. But yet, for that the
best affection is to be persuaded, and not compelled (otherwise it might prove
prejudicial to your honor, in my seeming over light) give me leave, so far
to contend against your passion, that I may not yield without such
circumstances as become a free election; and to that purpose, do desire some
time of respit, whereby my Virgin modesty and knowing judgment, may play
beseeming parts in the nuptials; otherwise, to the eye of the world, it must
needs appear forced, since it is to be supposed, you rather detain me as a
prisoner, then like a mistress; which also will eclipse the glory of your
name, as well as give me perpetual discontent, to esteem my self, no other
then a ravished wife, though Queen to so mighty a personage: having said thus
much, she cast down her fair eyes upon the ground, and wept. Which posture,
although it rendered Osirus almost a greater Captive then her self, yet it
stirred up in him the very desire of a Tyrant, being loath to be limited,
notwithstanding her bewitching entreaty; so that for some time he ^sat like the
just (though rigid) Roman, when he was to pass the sentence of death upon his
own son, overcome by a more mastering passion; till at last, he gave his
unwilling consent; and with it instantly took his leave, forgeting belike, by
reason of his troubled joy, to prescribe some convenient space for her
resolution. However, before his departure, to set up trophies of his own
conceived victory, he imprinted a hated kiss upon her sweet lips, which she
received no otherwise, then as some loathsome potion drunk, to avoid a
dangerous disease.

After that Osirus had thus absolutely quitted the lodgings, to the Princess
privacy, she began too seriously to reflect upon her own misfortunes, since the
strength of her apprehension, dressed all her considerations in mourning
apparel: in the first place, she seemed most bitterly to accuse her self of
ingratitude, to the dear love of deserving Narcissus, since like a coward, she
durst not own it, before the face of any power: next, in a manner, she cursed
her self, for having given any hope at all to the proud thoughts of her
hateful Jailer, as she esteemed Osirus; not knowing, by any means, how to wind
her dissimulation out of the engagement; until at last, with the very
imagination of what she had done, (although in truth she had done nothing) she
was transported so much beyond all patience, that she seemed in a manner
distracted, out of a certain jealousy, that she had yielded to some thing,
that might destroy her former love, and oblige her to a second: yet she had so
much incompassionate sense left, as to be her own cruel tormenters sometimes
tearing her hair, and then again beating her Alabaster breast, as if she meant
to punish her self, for having but only cozened Osirus vain imagination. But
being altogether tired with these diversities of passions, which again brought
her to that temper, that she was in some kind capable of profitable
consideration, she began to gather up the scattered remnants of her torn
attire, and by the help of a Glass there present, she a little accommodated
her own discomposure, not out of any curiosity she desired to use toward her
person, but only to prevent the discovery of her discontents, not knowing how
soon again she might be surprised. And thus, after she had performed what she
thought was most necessary, to re-edifie what she had unframed by her violence,
she went and sat down in the Chair, leaning her head, over the back, with both
her hands fastened upon her knee, whilst in the mean time her eyes were filled
with tears, and her looks steadfastly fixed upwards, as if she implored the
Heavens aid in her misfortunes: thus she remained, until Roxana, by the
direction of Osirus servant, was brought into the Gallery, to accompany her
mistress; which Cloria notwithstanding perceived not, till both the fellow was
gone, and Roxana seeing her sad posture, approached to waken her out of her
sadness; so that at last, by the importunity of two or three calls, the almost
dead Princess seemed by a slow motion to take new life, like a young Phoenix,
after her mothers obsequies; and when she had sent forth a couple of deep
sights, as assured messengers of her inward sorrow, being still pressed by
Roxana, to know the cause of her discontent, (for she was an entire stranger to
the encounter between her and Osirus) she at last told her, she had been lately
tormented by a hateful fury, and if by her wisdom she could not be
dis-ingaged from the enchantment, she was afraid it had got so much possession
of her person, that it must needs turn her resolutions to the forsaking of what
she most affected, or absolutely destroy that life she was willing to preserve,
because her friends wished it. This distracted language, and unusual looks,
made Roxana the more eager to be satisfied. Wherefore, after Cloria had invited
her to sit down by her, she informed her particularly of all the passages
between her self and Osirus, yet vowing she would die a thousand deaths,
rather then yield to his desire; withal, blaining her for having been the
occasion of her dissimulation.

However, these passions drew from the old woman some tears; yet, preferring a
discreet remedy, before a fruitless compassion, she not only soon dried her
eyes, but spoke to her after this manner: Most dear Lady and Mistress, said
she, although I could be content to bewail the occasion that first wound you
into this labyrinth of difficulties, yet it were merely ridiculous to lament
that which is past, without attempting the means to be delivered from the
mischief: Wherefore, before I proceed to counsel (however I shall be content
to take upon me what blame you please) I think it not amiss a little to let
you see your own error, whereby you may be rendered more capable of advice; for
yet your despairing thoughts take from you all probability of receiving other
impressions, then impossibilities of prevention, which certainly will be the
last and worst desperation, if tyrannical injustice absolutely prevail,
though I am confident, the gods will never permit so high an oppression, if you
your self provoke not too much their wrath, by having less trust in their
goodness, then you ought to have. In the first place, be pleased to consider,
what greater inconvenience you now undergo, then if you had inflamed Osirus,
by your peremptory denial? since the dangerous effects of that refusal, can
but fall upon you, when all other ways have been attempted for your
preservation and delivery; whereas now, you have not only purchased time, that
may produce happy accidents, but also by it you have convenient leisure to
think upon many things for your benefit, that have not yet fallen, perhaps,
within the compass of your consideration. In so much, as I must needs, not
only approve of your discretion, in tempering your love to Narcissus, and
concealing your hate to Osirus, but do further counsel you; nay, must conjure
you, that if the Prince do again importune you for your consent, which no
doubt he will, that you seem to give your free approbation, for the future
marriage; nevertheless, upon this condition, that it may be kept secret from
any knowledge, until you have sent to your mother into Cyprus, to have her
allowance; which promise cannot bind at all, not only in respect of your
former obligation to Narcissus, but also in regard you are prisoner, and
therefore not tied to any contract made in such a state; which, as I said
before, will gain time (the most precious thing we can desire, besides your
absolute freedom) until either the winning of the Town by the besiegers,
probable enough (since Sorastros is so employed in his Carthagenian wars,
that he cannot send any succors to relieve his son) or some other fortunate
chance give a period to your unfortunate intanglement; in the mean space, if
my wits fail me not, I may project something for your advantage. And thus by
fair words, with her discrect carriage, Cloria by little and little was
persuaded to rest satisfied; the rather, for that Osirus employment in the
siege, gave her some weeks respit from his importunity.

But Osirus one day, either over-hot with his affection, or conceiving he had
permitted Cloria a sufficient time of consideration, came into the same
Gallery, where she was again privately retired for her receation; who, after
she had entertained his short complements, with a pale countenance, and a
trembling expression, the true winesses of her troubled mind, he began to
demand an account of her resolutions; since, as he said, he had given her both
a noble and a gracious respit, and therefore wished her no longer to play the
tyrant with his love. Cloria, when she had a little recollected her distracted
spirits, became something passionate of his peremptory taxation, hoping thereby
the better to obtain a longer protraction of her determinate answer for the
marriage; but he seeming to press it, with some violence, the Princess took
the boldness to tell him, that although she intended not to dispute the
question between his love and her tyranny, much less to examine the
graciousnesse of his proceedings; yet since she was resolved to have more time,
before she could fully consent to a business of so high a consequence, she
desired him to have the patience which befitted a suitor: This she delivered
with a quick sharpness, contrary to her custom, that showed, she was not more
displeased with his request, then confident of her power.

Yet alas, the last opinion extremely deceived her; for Osirus belike,
disdaining in his proud nature, to entertain any thing from his Captive, but
humilicy, with a sour brow told her, that those sparkles which hier beauty had
kindled in his heart, were either to be kept alive by more violence, or to be
utterly extinguished, by a just revenge; and these words put poor Cloria clean
beside all her policy; so that she stood some time, like one that saw a spirit,
and had not courage enough to speak to it; which was an occasion that they both
entertained one another for a pretty space, with their looks only; until the
compulsion of fear dictated to her thoughts a necessity of redeeming again his
good opinion, doubting her too much confidence had endangered, in some sort,
his displeasure; and therefore, with an humble courtesy, although her
countenance still put on shows of distrustful aversion, she thus spoke unto
him.

My Lord, said she, by your aspect and words, I cannot but note your anger;
which to my condition, is no less to be esteemed then absolute destruction:
since I can neither fly from your wrath, nor resist your power; but how
terrible that appears to my imagination, when you are treating in matters of
love, that ought to be sweet and calm, I leave you to judge; when I am to be
perpetually tied to a subjection always tyrannical, and never conversable, as
I may believe by your present demeanor; since your jealousies and suspicions,
at this time, far ou^goe your reason; and with that she, wept: which gave
Osirus occasion to take her in his arms, vowing by all the gods, that as his
affection was no way diminished toward her, so he would resolve, when they
were married, not only to bury all jealousies, but to study a more pleasing
conversation, that might render her happily contented; these expressions she
acknowledged with a bow of her body, though she played in the mean space, only
the sad hypocrite. After she had wiped her eyes, for now she was to act her
part, according to her Governesse direction, since she found her other project
had failed her, she began again to speak to him in this manner; wherein she
showed, that her necessities had taught her a craft that was not at all in her
nature, for that she always esteemed it dishonorable to dissemble.

Sir, said she, if your professions be answerable to my expectation, and that
your thoughts go along with your words, I shall be most happy in my
declaration, since, as I am to be your wife with honor and content, as you
have promised, so I must desire you to permit those circumstances, without
which they cannot be had; that is, that I may have liberty, before the
publication of the Nupcials, to send into Cyprus to my mother, not only to let
her know what is become of me, but withal, to purchase her free consent to so
Noble a choice; since, as you know, it is the least duty of a child, to give
an account to their parents of that disposure, which absolutely banisheth them
from their protection, and renders them subjects of another jurisdiction:
wherein, you will not only afford sufficient proof of your being hereafter a
kind husband, but of your being now a Noble Conqueror.

Osirus, although he was beyond expression joy'd at her seeming consent, and
tickled to hear himself magnified by a tongue he most valued; yet he was
scarce pleased at the request, both because it necessarily protracted the
marriage, as also, for that it raised some doubt, lest Hyacinthia should not be
willing to the match; which made him for some time wrestle with his
determination, until at last, his overweening fancy brought forth his
judgment, in the two points controverttd by his suspicion; which was, that as
in the first place he was bound in honor and love to give satisfaction to his
now supposed wife; so for the other, he could not fear the dislike of the
Queen, but rather a hasty consent; not only in regard it preserved, but
dignified her daughter: with this fance, and a smiling countenance, (which
until then he had never put on) he told Cloria, that her request was granted;
however, with this proviso, that a messenger of his own, for the more state, as
he pretended, should bear the Letter; wherein she might very well see a
continuance of his jealousies, notwithstanding his glorious professions; though
she could not much blame him for the humor, since she knew her own heart was
not faithful to his purposes.

But Cloria, however she was sorry for his caution, yet she was forced to give
her consent, like one that was constrained to deal with his creditor after he
was arrested; and so the present bargain was struck up between them, which
she thought commodious, in respect it procured her a reprieve, hoping that ere
long the consequence of the siege might produce accidents to her advantage. Yet
his telling her by chance, that his father Sorastros, having compounded his
Carthaginian differences, was resolved to march with his whole Army to relieve
the Town, a little destroyed that hope; though he rather spoke it to satisfy
his own vaunting humor, then out of any assurance he had of the design. In
this posture Osirus, after he had endeavored to show his own amorous
disposition by a few love complements, and with an ill grace, begged a kiss of
her fair lips, he retired to entertain his own joy, and please himself with
the fancies of his delightful marriage, whilst in the mean time, with hasty
reps; and a passionate mind, sweet Cloria went to seek out Roxana, to render
her a perfect account of her proceedings; whom she found in her chamber
clothing a little Dwarf, accompanied only with her mayd-servants: but Roxana
quickly finding the distemper of her Mistress, by her distracted looks, and
confused demands, soon dismissed the people, and after Cloria was seated upon her
bed, she importuned her to know, what new accidents had again troubled her
thoughts, since not long ago, she had left her in so good a humor, in so
much as at last the Princess told her the whole story of Osirus carriage, and
her own consent, wishing withal that she had rather hazzarded her life, by an
absolute denial, then have given him so much satisfaction; whereupon Roxana
began to smile: but Cloria apprehending a want of compassion in her Governesse,
told her, she was of the conspiracy with Osirus, to betray her love to
Narcissus, since she could express mirth at this time in her countenance, when
her self was tormented with a despairing misery. No, said Roxana, I laugh to
see your wilful ignorance, that no instruction can inform; when, put on what
resolution soever you will, you return again to the same error: for, I pray
consider, if you have not that liberty of hazzarding your life, (as I have
often told you) when you have tried always, by seeming to comply with Osirus
desire, to gain time, as if you had exasperated his spleen by a peremptory
denial at the first? and certainly that is the worst of your expectation;
besides, you may remember, if you have not altogether forgot your own relation,
how much he was distempered, when you did but mention, an incertainty in your
resolution of making him your husbands; in so much as you were glad your self
to cry peceavi, and suddenly by dissimulation to temper his passion. Yet, that
you may see, I am not so great an enemy to your wishes, as your suspicion
suggests to your imagination, I shall propound unto you probable remedies, if
you have patience enough to put them in execution; if not, at least wise sit
still, and hear what I will act, without destroying my designs: These words
made poor Cloria perk up her self with a new hope, since she could be never
diffident in her Governesse wisdom; and so by little and little, drew nearer
unto her, till at last she laid her head in the old woman's bosom; whilst she
had acquainted her with her project, in these words.

The boy, said she, which you saw us apparelling when you entered into the
chamber, (I hope sent by the gods for our purpose) I bought, not long ago, of
a widow to an Ethiopian Merchant, because he could speak perfectly the Lydian
tongue, and is by birth of Chios, brought up from his infancy in the art of
swimming, as all the rest of those Islanders are; in so much as he is become
admirable in that profession, and was made use of by his dead master (who was a
Jeweller by his vocation) for his commodity and gain in his traffic for rich
stones, in respect the rivers of these Countries yield abundance. However, not
being very certain of his skill before I had tried him in the water, and
curious to be assured that my new servant wanted not that quality of diving,
according to the recommendation, (although I knew not what use I should have of
that science) I carried him down into the deep cestern belonging to the Castle
(which marks out yearly the rise and fall of Nilus to the people of the
Country; whereby they may have a conjecture of the fertility of their harvest)
as conceiving it the most convenient place to prove his cunning; not only in
regard it lay within the limits of our own lodgings; but also, for that the
deepnesse of the poole would make a better proof of his dexterity; where, not
long he had played in the water, (I, in the mean time casting in pieces of
money, which he always fetched up from the bottom) before he fell by chance
upon the great bolt that fastens the Iron grate, giving passage into the
Castle, that cannot be perceived, by reason of the stream, until the course be
turned another way, by certain artificial pipes, that delivers it into the
river, which before I was aware he unbolted, to have the more liberty in Nilus;
but I soon called him into the Cesterne again, not only because I feared it
might be discovered, but for that I began to think with my self, some benefit
might be made of the knowledge: and to this purpose have considered, this boy
may be sent into your uncles army, not only to give him notice of your
imprisonment, but to try whether any brave spirits will attempt the surprise of
the Castle through the same passage, he upon their approach, opening the
watergate to give them entrance; which is a project not hard to be put in
execution in the night season, when the Guard shall be careless of their
watch, by reason the place is not at all suspected. Besides, I have noted so
much neglect of that part of the Fort, that either it appears, Osirus wants
Soldiers for the strong defense of the whole Town; or, he conceives the Castle
is inpregnable, of that side of Nilus: Now all the fear is, least the boy
himself prove a traitor to the design; which however can but ruin my self,
and leave you in no worse estate then you are; a sacrisice I shall be always
content to offer, to render you the probability of so acceptable a service: but
if there cannot be found those courages in the Camp, that will undergo the
danger of the attempt, the Dwarf may have a further Commission to pass into
Cyprus to the Queen your mother, to inform her of all the passages; by which
information she may use some means to protract her consent to the marriage; or
at least wise, prevent Osiris messengers return, by causing him to be taken
prisoner, before he can get to the seaside.

No sooner had Roxana laid open this stratagem, but Cloria, as if it had been
already finished, professed her Governesse the only instrument of her
happiness; (so far does humane desire go beyond all judgment, governed by
reason) though the politic old woman (notwithstanding she was willing to keep
up her mistresses hopes at the highest pitch) saw there were many difficulties
and hazzards to pass, before they could arrive at the period of their wishes;
not only by reason of diverse accidents, that might happen to the childish
messenger, that was to be employed in so dangerous a business; but for that
Osirus, overheated with his love, might not continue constant to his promises;
and by that means easily destroy all that they had designed: however Roxana
omitted no opportunity for some days, to instruct the Dwarf in the part he
was to act; until her pains, after a weeks space, had in the dead of the
night, delivered him free from the Castle watch, and in the morning came to
give Cloria an account of her proceeding. This enterprise so far pleased the
Princess, in the already success, that whilst she was dressing her self,
being in a manner free from all care and perturbation, by reason of the
confidence she had of the project; that she desired her Governesse, if she knew
the story, to make her acquainted with the first occasion of this war between
her uncle Orsame, and Sorastros King of Egypt; since, as she said, the spleen
seemed to be irreconcilable.

Truly Madam, answered Roxana, as the chief reason is ambition, the most
powerful provoker of great Monarchs to enmity, notwithstanding the force of
any alliance or religion; yet the pretext, to satisfy the world, is related
after this manner: There is, said she, a certain Dukedom, not far off the
confines of Syria, whose defects of quantity is abundantly supplied by the
fertility of the soil; which, besides the situation of the Country, lying
commodiously to both their Dominions, has rendered it a subject of
covertousnesse to each Prince; however, in my opinion, your uncle had the
better pretense for the quarrel; for the Duk^ of the Territory dying without
heirs males (...) body, the King of Armenia, by the provoca^^^ of Sorastros,
claimed the forfeiture of the Country ^as an escheate belonging to his
kingdom, and of the other side, Orsames stood for the title of one of his own,
subjects, who certainly had the just right in (...) Principality, though not
condescended unto (...) the other party; which at last, procured the raising of
powerful armies of both sides; but before they could come conveniently to
encounter one with another, it was necessary they should pass Arabia, a
Country not only mountainous, but belonging to a Prince; that as he was
near of kin to Sorastros, by former alliance, so was he for the present
married to a sister of Orsame, which made him have a hard part to play;
desiring to keep an equal balance between both these contentions, until the
gods at one time took away both his care and life; but his widow quickly put
his children under the protection of Orsames her brother, by which means his
pretention became much more fortified; in so much as Sorastros had no other way
to countervaile that interest, but to cause the two uncles of the young Prince,
to lay claim to the Dominion, as pretending the child not to be legitimate:
this imagined Title, quickly made a division of all the Nobility of the
Country, some taking part with the brothers, others with the young Duke;
whilst in the mean time both Orsames and Sorastros put in for their own
interest; the one pretending a jurisdiction in the Country, in the childrens
right, as the other sought to strengthen the uncles titles; which contention
made the poor subjects become miserable, since they were forced to sustain
the charge of the ambitious Armies; and Arabia being made the Theater of the
war, the walled Towns were the only receptacles of provisions, and
protection for the inhabitants, which appeared to be more lasting, for that the
victories seemed to go by turns a long time; till at last the Egyptian forces
prevailing, the Princess, with the young Duke, was constrained, for want of
timely assistance from her brother, being basied in other affairs, to seek
refuge in one of the strongest and best fortified Cities of the Country;
where, being not only besieged, but violently assaulied by the adverse party,
she had a task hard enough, to escape by an obseure flight in the night,
whilst in the interim, the Town was yielded into the hands of her brothers in
Law, though the Castle still kept possession for the lawful Prince: the enemy,
by this success, appeared in a manner quite possessors of the whole Country;
until Orsames General, lying with his Army upon the confines of Syria,
necessarily to repair the decay of his forces, hearing of the prevailing
progress of the Nobility, conceived it more then time to stop this overflowing
current, unless he would suffer not only the Duke to be dis-inherited by the
practices of his uncles, but his master to be dishonored by the power of the
Egyptians: wherefore, as desperate diseases are to be cured by extraordinary
physic, not so much as staying for the necessary recruit of his Army, marched
with a haste answerable to the greatness of the design, which was, again to
recover the lost Town, that seemed principally to command the whole Country, or
bury himself, and all his soldiers before those walls, he should not be able
to enter. At his arrival, he not only set upon those Troops that were placed
to stop his passage, but gave them an entire defeat, though their numbers far
exceeded those he conducted, that also were accompanied with the disadvantage
of being wearied in their journey, having nothing but their own invincible
courages to supply the defect. But however, this admirable esteemed victory,
both possessed the brave General of the Town, and reduced many of the revolted
Nobility, to their lawful obedience; yet the sparcles of so great a disunion,
were impossible to be buried in the Cinders of a quiet peace; especially, since
the Egyptian neighboring Countries were always capable to kindle new flames,
without some agreement by consent; so that it was designed to use all means
could be devised, to render the uncles contented; whereby the Prince might the
better be secured, and established in his rightful inheritance, and the
Country freed from the fear of any more civil war; in prosecution of which,
the one was bought with rich gifts, to become Orsames General in those wars
he intended against Sorastros, by reason of these occasions; and the other was
married to the Dukes sister, his own Niece; the likelier to continue his
friendship between him and his sister in Law, and make the party stronger for
Orsames intentions, which was to revenge the injuries that he conceived the
Egyptians; intended against his sisters honor, and his nephews right. This
Madam, said Roxana, has been the beginning of the quarrels between these two
mighty Monarchs, that both have, and is likely still to disturb the
tranquillity of the most part of Asia, of which now the Country of Lydia, your
fathers Kingdom, begins also to bear a large share; since it is not to be
doubted, but Philostros set afoot the troubles there, because the King would
not join in an absolute league with Syria; but scarce had she come to this
point, when she was informed that Osirus was near at hand, to visit the
Princess; which gave them no more time, then was necessary to prepare for his
unwelcome company; and so consequently broke off for the present their
discourse.

Osirus, that began to esteem himself, in a manner Lord of his desires; having
his Mistress affections, as he believed, under his command, as he had her person
in his custody; nothing being now between the fraition and his hopes, but a few
ceremonions approbatious of her parents; entered the room, not like a fearful
Lover, or a modest suitor, but already a married husband, taking presently.
Cloria in his arms; whilst he profaned, as she imagined, the chaste temple of
herlips, with three or four impure kisses, that left them, after a while, to
blush for the attempt; however, he presently turned to Roxana, and told her,
that when the Nuptials were past, he would study some convenient preferment for
her age; either by a rich husband to keep her sides warm, or an honorable
jurisdiction, to exercise her experience; not knowing how little faithful she
had been, and intended to be, to his purposes; notwithstanding she hambly
thanked him for his gracious favor: after this he began to fall into a large
commendation of all his virtues; but, especially of his admirable valor, that
never refused any danger, as he said, how great and common sovever, in the
wars, or otherwise; though the dignity of his person was a sufficient
privilege, as he said against such attempts. But during the time that he was
using these brags, which gave poor Cloria a sufficient surfeit, he was
informed, that a Herald attended in the Gallery, with a Letter from the Camp.
Osirus believing that it was some offered treaty of composition from Orsames,
hearing of the determination of his father, to raise the siege, instantly
commanded the messenger to be brought into his presence, that his mistress might
be witness of his glory; after he had received and opened the Letter, he read
it aloud, that the whole company might be satisfied in the contents, scorning
to conceal what resolution soever of the enemy, however contrary to his
expectation; the writing spoke this Language.

Osirus,
I am to let you know, that your Messenger, whom you intended to send into
Cyprus, is surprised by our Army; whereby the love you offer to the fair
Princess Cloria, is discovered; with your design, to demand her in marriage,
of her mother, the Queen Hyacinthia; which is a request, neither in her power
to grant, nor for your honor to desire; since I pretend a former promise of
her affection, not to be released by any power, unless she her self do
unworthily fly from the contract; an act, I can never believe, until I see it
underwritten by that white hand, that I suppose will not be consenting to so
black a deed: in the mean time I must think it, either a project of your own
foolish presumption, or a constraint, proceeding from the wicked tyranny of her
imprisonment, that gives you boldness to make so unjust a demand. Wherefore,
if you have any remnants left, of that Noble blood, which belongs to your
house, a prerogative you so much boast of; show it, either in leaving off so
preposterous a suit, and set the Lady free from her captivity, whereby she may
become absolute Mistress of her choice; or else prepare your self with courage,
to give me the meeting in a single combat, to dispute the Title: else, I must
let you know, that as I am the white Knight, which disarmed you in the head of
your Troops, so must I from hence forward, proclaim you to be a cowardly
Traitor to love, valor, and virtue; and so consequently, not only unworthy of
your pretentions, to be husband to such a wife, but of any other match, how low
soever can be propounded, although you bear the name of a Prince; unto which I
subscribe my name,

NARCISSUS.


After that Osirus had read the Letter, and for some time considered the
contents thereof, with a disdainful smile he told the Messenger, that as he
pardoned his rashness, for bringing such peremptory lines, to be presented to
a Majesty, not to be discerned by so poor a sight as his own; so he commanded
him to let the boy know, not only his own contempt of his person, but that
the Princess Cloria, (who was a wife rather fit for the gods, then for a child
of so mean condition) disdained the very mentioning of his love; wherein, he
thought he much obliged her with a complement. And for the combat, if the
greatest Monarch of the world had sent him a challenge (as he said) he must
therein have followed the direction of his Council; much less endeavor to
give satisfaction to such preposterous lines. After the messenger was
discharged, Osirus went out of the room, as if his choler had got the absolute
prerogative over his brags; whilst in the mean time, Cloria and her Governesse
had sport enough to laugh at his folly, as well as to be joyful at the
neighborhood of Narcissus; which gave them sufficient employment and delight
all the day following. However, the next morning, to their no small amazement,
they were called up to the leads of the Castle, to behold a great distraction
in Orsame; Army, before the Town, wherein appeared an extraordinary slaughter;
upon what ground they could not possibly imagine, unless it were some
accidental, and unfortunate mutiny amongst themselves; which notwithstanding,
so much troubled them both, that they soon retired, with the undelightfulnesse
of the prospect, into their own lodgings, to attend the issue of the supposed
difference; where they had not rested two hours, tormented with variable
fears, and greedy expectations, before they were informed, that some Troops
sent by Sorastros to relieve his son, because he could not yet spare more
forces from his new engagements, had with invincible courage made their passage
through the enemies camp, and with safety got entrance into the Town, to the
absolute furnishing of the garrison; which (as 'twas delivered) created new
courage in the hearts of the people; in so much that now (as they said) they
did not care for the continuance of the siege, since they were sufficiently
provided against all Orsames power. Cloria and Roxana, notwithstanding this
news, were extremely glad it was no worse; although, of the other side, they
were troubled to think upon the protraction of their delivery, if their project
should any way miscarry, the accident giving convenience to double the guards
in every place, one of the greatest obstacles to the design; however, their
hopes so much outwent their fears, that their imaginations were contented in
some sort to rest satisfied.

But Osirus, being puffed up with the joy of these new succors, not only, for
that they so much strengthened his forces in the Town, but had, as he believed,
most courageously beaten Orsames, since they made their way through his whole
Army, resolved the next day himself in person to make a general sally upon
the enemy, and by that means, as he hoped, absolutely to finish the siege:
neither could he abstain from sending a messenger to the Princess, as well to
inform her of his success, as to promise her the chastisement of the proud
boy Narcissus, as he termed him; which belike he imagined would be most welcome
news to her ears. Cloria, although she scarce liked his determination, yet
she was confident enough of his want of power to execute his resolution;
knowing that Orsames, her uncle, neither wanted soldiers in his Camp, to
resist his attempt, nor conduct in his Officers, to be sufficiently warchfull
against any surprise; especially being taught provident experience by the last
days conflict; and for Narcissus, who went nearest her heart, although she was
possessed with some gentle fears continually of his safety, yet she was
abundantly confident of his valor, not only in the consideration of the bold
challenge he had lately sent Osirus, but in the common report she had heard of
his fame, during these wars, under the title of the white Knight; however she
was content, by the persuasion of her Governesse, to return a dissembling
thanks for the Princes favor, that he would vouchsafe to make her acquainted
with his great and secret designs.

After the messenger was departed, as Cloria and Roxana spent most of the day,
and the night following, in discourses concerning their affairs, (in which
interim, now and then the sweet Princess let fall some tears, with many
silent prayers to the gods, both for the prosperity of her condition, and the
safety of Narcissus) so, of the other side, Osirus was more then busied in the
preparation, and encouragement of his soldiers; sometime taking counsel,
whether it were better to set upon the enemy, in the day, or the night; and how
to manage the salley they intended to make, to the best advantage; other while,
he caused false alarums to be given to the Camp, with beat of Drum and sound of
Trumpet, whereby the better not only to deceive Orsames expectation, that he
might be less prepared, when he should set upon him, but also to weary his
soldiers, remaining in their arms; all which employment took up the time;
until Osirus (after two days, in the dead of the night, so determined by a
Council of war) issued forth, out of the Town, with most of his forces, only
leaving the burgers to man the walls; and marched in that manner silently,
without any noise at all, the better to surprise the enemy. But contrary to his
expectation, or rather to his extraordinary amazement, he found the Camp
raised, and Orsames gone; only some few left (as they confessed, being taken
by the soldiers) to set fire to the Camp the next morning. This news, as it
gave sufficient cause of wonder to Osirus army, so it was quickly carried with
joy into the Town; wherefore, the Troops returning again, after some slight
sacrifices were performed to the gods, every one betook themselves to those
appetites that best pleased their sensualities; the Citizens only taking care,
as in time of peace, for the safety of the City: but by this strange; or rather
ominous accdents, Clorias hopes seemed now to be absolutely ravished, and her
miserable captivity to be eternally prolonged; nor had Roxana scarce courage
left her to comfort her sorrowful Mistress in any kind, that could produce the
least flattering confidence; yet after they had spent the tedious day in
diverlity of passions, which appeared to be the more Tyrannical, for that they
were forced in part, to smother their griefs in their secret bosoms, that
they might not come to the knowledge of those spies, which were commanded to
attend their persons, if not secure their imprisonment; at night they both cast
themselves down upon their beds, without taking the pains to pull off their
clothes, not believing that rest they were probably to take, could merit the
labor.

However they had not reposed in that posture much above two hours, in
frightfull slumbers, and disquiet dreams, engendered in their thoughts by
despairing apprehensions, when of the sudden they were called up by a maid
servant, to behold a bloody conflict in the Castle Hall, whereof they had the
more commodity to be spectators, in regard the window of the Wardrobe that
belonged to their lodgings, had a full prospect into the place; the fight
seemed the more horrid, in regard only of a faint light proceeding from a
dark lamp, that was hung in the middle of the room, which rather appeared
like the taper of death, since it was the means to show the way to a greater
slaughter, then was commodious, or at all delightful to the view: but after a
while that the confused combatants either wearied by over much destruction, or
the prevailing party having gained too apparent advantage over those of the
Castle, (in part to be discerned by their Livery) began to breath, whilst the
others fled, either to seek more help, or to save their lives; yet long they
had not enjoyed that repose, (and I may say in some sort necessary) but they
might here a Knight among the rest, that seemed to be the chief Captain of
the Company in Command, to blame them for their slothfulness in prosecution,
considering as he said, the work was not half done, until they were full
possessors of the Fort; with these words flourishing a little his sword about
his head, he endeavored to make a new passage into the innermost rooms; but
long it was not before he was strongly opposed by a guard at the door, that
courageously denied him entrance, until many of their lives had paid for the
bold attempt. This brought Osiris ready armed to warrant his guards Commission;
So that the knight was forced to retire back into the hall, not so much to give
way to the fury of his stroke, as perceiving him to be the Prince by his own
language, to have the more space conveniently to fight in the Hall, since he
found himself shut up in a straight entry: never till then began a combat
worth the beholding; for, as Osiris seemed to contend, for the defense of his
Castle, knowing them by their own confession to be Orsames Soldiers, so the
Captain, as it were by the provocation of honor, strived by force of Arms to
make him his prisoner, being the chief Prince of the Country; since the glory
of the victory appeared, only to consist in such a conquest as himself
believed; whilst in the mean time his other followers pursued the rest of the
guard round about the Fort, until they had absolutely rendered them subjects of
their wrath, or objects of their mercy; and thus continued these confused
slaughters, and fearful cries of dying and veilding persons, to the
astonishment of poor Cloria, whose eyes had not been often acquainted with
such spectacles, till the dwarf Roxana had sent to inform Orsames of their
Captivity, appeared suddenly at their backs, and almost as soon informed them,
not only of the success of his enterprise in the Army, but withal told them,
that it was Narcissus that for the present combated with Osiris.

Then the Princess began again to be possessed with some new fears, as
doubting the issue of the fight, since she beheld both their armours alike
besprinkled with blood, which caused her a little to withdraw her sight; by the
interposition of a certain curtain that covered the windows; however not
being able long, to withhold her curious though distracted looks, from that
fearful object as she conceived, after some more time looking again into the
hall, she might behold Osiris fall down, before the conquering sword of brand
Narcissus, who presently notwithstanding made have to him with seeming wings of
charity and compassion, and soon unlaced his Head-plece, with intention to
give him some refreshing air, as the most necessary means, to call him again
out of his founding, that appeared to his apprehension the next neighbor unto
death: Osiris after he had recovered a new life by this courtesy, fixed his
eyes steadfastly upon him, as if however in a manner, he disdained all
assistance in that nature; until at last in an appearing passion, he uttered
these words: Is it possible the gods can thus envy my fate, as not only to
make me a base captive in my own Castle, but to necessitate my fortunes to
such a condition, as to render me needful of an enemies favor? nay, rather
said he, let me dye a thousand times in the height of your cruelties, and my
own misfortune; then presently shut his eyes again, as if he hated the days
light, though as it mighe be thought, more for his conceived disgrace to be so
overcome, then for the loss of his liberty and prosperity; however Narcissus
commanded his Officers, instantly to bear the wounded Prince to his chamber,
without any other reply, then that his condition required patience and not
passion; which absolutely made up the full period of his fortunate glory, to
the amazed content of his most beautiful love: but Cloria being persuaded by
Roxana, to give Narcissus a visit in the Hall, since that was the honorable
Theater, where he had acted so valiant a part for her delivery, she hasted in
her resolutions to that wished entertainment, which diverted other
considerations; however Narcissus not so cold in his love to his fair
Mistress, after he had disposed of Osirus to safe custody, with a strict
command for his noble usage, and a diligent care to be had of his wounds, made
what haste he could up into the Princess chamber, as to the Temple where he
intended to offer his first sacrifice after his Victories, which was the
occasion they both met upon the stairs.

Narcissus when he beheld the only Goddess of his heart, had much ado to
abstain from open Idolatry; however, his congue could not forbear these
expressions, when he had sealed his own welcome, with his longing lips upon
her white hand: Most excellent Princess, said he, the only hope of my life,
and the very life of all my hopes, whose goodness and beauty are such
parallels of perfection, that heaven and earth seem to have conspired in your
Birth, since by the one you conquer the world, as by the other you do more then
prevail with the divine powers: And yet said Cloria, you seemed to challenge a
great prerogative in my love, when you durst express in your Letter to Osirus,
your interest to my person and affection, in so bold a style and language,
without my privacy and allowance, which might have cost me dear, if your
fortune had not been better then your temper. At which reproof Narcissus
(fearing he had exasperated the Princess anger by that declaration) began with
trembling and distracted words, to make an apology for that presumption: But
merciful Cloria, when she had conducted him into her own chamber, and there
for some time entertained him with a pretty smile; only enjoined him for his
penance, the relation of his adventures, since she left him at her mothers
Court, in the habit of Aminta: yet considering what a discovery, unawares she
had made to Roxana's knowledge, she could not choose but grow red, whilst her
Governesse looked her in the face with some wonder, to hear of the name of
Aminta her own servant, and Narcissus her mistress lover to be the same
person; This made the Princess blush with the more violence, till at last the
riddle was unfolded by her self, since it could not be any longer kept secret;
however with a conjuration to her Governesse, never to divulge it to any person
living. But having appeased all these differences, at last Narcissus, whom she
only blamed for the act, began his story in this manner:

After said he the news of your strange loss, was spread through your Mothers
Coart, and so consequently over all the Island of Cyprus, which left no corner
without grief and sorrow, I resolved presently to change my disguise, and
search you in every place, that could afford any probability of your aboade;
And first it came into my imagination, that you might be voluntarily retired
into Lydia, to accompany your Father in his necessities; however that was but a
fancy to all knowing judgments, since you would before the determination, have
made the Queen acquainted with your resolution, who rather believed that some
love conspiracy between us two, had made you privately quit the Country: but
as both I and others supposed we knew not what, so I went I knew not where,
till at last by a rough Journey at Sea, I arrived upon the Coast of Caria, with
an intention to enquire whether or no, you made your aboade in your Fathers
Court, however I was beforehand convinced in the improbability of the demand,
where nevertheless by chance, I met with a ship of those Pirates, that had
fled from the rest that took you prisoner, not being consenting to your
transportation into Egypt, which was put into that Harbor, with a resolution,
if they could not be admitted speedily into the service of Evarchus against his
own Subjects, who had already as 'twas reported employed most of his royal
Navy against his Command, they would direct their course to Tire, to make the
same offer to Orsames your Uncle; by which means I became absolutely informed
of them, of all those passages that concerned your Person, amongst the Pirates
before your coming to Memphis: but they receiving a refusal, by reason the
King your Father esteemed not himself, yet ready for their assistance, I
determined to take the commodity of that ship for my transportation into Syria:
however, because the Vessel needed some reparation before it could go out of
the Haven of Caria, I had sufficient leisure given me in a disguise, to inform
my self of the assaires of your Father, as a duty belonging to you, whom as I
was told had lately quitted the City of Sardis, and was retired for his greater
security (though with a very few company) to Theatira, a place as it was
conceived much more addicted to his service; upon my arrival I found him in a
condition in that City beyond my expectation, not only attended by most of the
Gentry and Nobility of the Kingdom of Lydia, but going to a great Assembly of
people gathered together by his command; unto whom he made an oration to this
purpose:

My Lords said he, and you the rest of my Subjects, as I am not more glad, to
see this joyful Declaration of your Duties to my Service, then willing to
employ my best endeavors for your protection, so I hope the Gods will give me
the power still to be your King, notwithstanding the cunning and malicious
practices of many, who have sought to bereave me of that honor, alleging I
have a will rather to become a tyrant, then continue a Governor: but for that
this meeting is principally designed, that you may the better know me, and I be
more assured of you, I shall strive to let you see my acts and thoughts: in the
first place, no sooner was I thoroughly possessed of the grievances of my
Kingdoms, but I assembled the great Council to give them redress, wherein I
not only condescended to pass such decrees, as were thought necessary for
that purpose, but assured the continuance thereof, absolately to bury all
fears and jealousies, that might arise by reason of any doubt of my
inconstancy; however this is now so far turned to my disadvantage, that I am
not only denied, any more mannaging the affairs of the Commonweal, contrary
to the known Laws of Lydia, but have been in a manner, forcibly driven from
Sardis my regal City, with disorderly tumults; neither can probably be again
established in my ancient right, without your assistance. In the second place,
I can give you no stronger assurance, then my deep vows to the gods, that I
will never change the laws, customs, and religion of the Kingdom, which are
testimonies sufficient for your belief, against calumniations, and false
aspersions, cast about in your ears to my prejudice; since in your loves I
mean rather to rule, then by my own Sword, And now I shall proceed to let you
see, the danger to your selves by this intended change of Laws; though, before
you can be entirely instructed therein, you must be thoroughly informed of the
constitutions of your own present government, the best composed certainty of
all other, since it is a Monarch of that restriction, that it neither takes
from the King, that power that is necessary for his obedience; nor yet leaves
the subject in a slavish subjection; so that if he would, he cannot be a
Tyrant; and if he will, he may be a Prince: in the one, the people are invited
to obey with love; and in the other, the Sovereign is compelled to govern with
humanity, since he has not power to be over-insolent, as the subject liberty
to be licentious; in so much as there will now rest nothing, but to mark out to
your understandings my Privileges and your rights, whereby you may the more
clearly distinguish, of the unhappy differences between me and my Senate; which
as I take it, is the plainest way of demonstration, since the matter is brought
into fact, and not left to opinion.

To this purpose, I challenge, by the laws, customs, and fundamental
constitutions of this Kingdom, never yet contradicted, or disputed by any
time, the creating of Nobility, ordaining officers, pardoning offenders,
confiscations of offenders, raising of Forces, making war or or peace,
convocating of dismissing Senates, and a negative voice in the proceedings, as
undoubted prerogatives belonging to the Crown of Lydia, not to be invaded by
the endeavor of any subject, without incurring those penalties, that belong to
the crime of treason against the Kings person; of the other side, the people
may justly pretend to this liberty, the absolute freedom of their lives, which
they cannot forfeit, without a legal trial by men of their own rank and
Country: a power to enjoy and dispose of their goods, without the leave of any
person whatsoever; and a successive inheritance in their lands, that cannot be
interposed by any of another blond or kindred: the first gives the Prince such
a jurisdiction, as is necessary for his government, the other maintains the
people in a pleasing freedom, to themselves; without the one there must needs
follow, that which can produce nothing but confusion; and lacking the other,
men are so enthralled, that they must needs want courages to defend, or good
their Country; wherefore, if I lack that fitting right that belongs unto a
King, you must miss of that protection needful for subjects, since the
disputation of command only, will distract the resolutions, of such as are
commanded in their obedience (...) whereby profitable resolutions cannot be put
in execution. Besides, if I should poorly suffer my ancient right to be
invaded, can it be though my lasting posterity, will be content in after age^
with such a loss? since they will have ma^^ Princes, stung with the example,
to assist them in the justness of the quarrel; which will at last, either
endanger the Subjects of the Kingdom, to be made captives to foreign power,
or at the least, fill the whole Realm with blood and slaughters, to its
absolute destruction? So that, I say, as these were most laudable
constitutions, conveyed unto you by the wisdom of your ancestors, so do not
you by your own stupid wilfulness, (for no better can I call it) endeavor to
abolish that excellent government, that has continued you happy for so many
ages; resembling the Giants, that made a preposterous war with heaven, until
they and their proud endeavors, were all buried in a confused destruction. I
speak not this, that I so much doubt you in your affections, as I fear others
in their subtilties; for as no hypocrisy is so dangerous, as that which brings
with it the name of Religion, so no bait is so catching, as that which is
sweetened with the promise of liberty. Remember but your past delight, and
compare it with the present distraction, and I am assared you will find a
difference; wherefore if these be but the beginnings of evils, consider what
the end will be; alterations of government are like desperate purges, that at
the best exceedingly distemper, and at the worst are deadly: if you should have
more freedom then you have, you would but break your winds, before you get to
the end of your course; and if you have less then you enjoy, may the Gods
punish me for my tyranny; let your old law-markes guide you in your subjection
and obedience, and suffer no new ones to be set up, that will not teach you to
void rocks, since you are not acquainted with their stations. That subject must
needs be in great slavery, that neither knows a certain rule whereby to do
well, nor can comprehend the power of the Lord he is to obey: let the things
you know be your punishment or reward, by which you may easily square your
endeavors, and not bring a judgment upon your selves, for that you cannot
possibly learn; since it will not be your crime that condemns you, but other
opinions that judges you. But perchance it may be alleged, that this unlimited
jurisdiction is to last but during the necessity of the time; unto which it may
as probably be answered, that as any new authority obtained, is seldom or
never given over, but by force; so, of the other side, it is more then
suspicious there is no such intention, when the old way is sufficient to govern
moderately by, without seeking a new, by injurious difficulties; no, no, be not
deceived, for scarce yet a change has been made in any State (under what
pretentions soever) that ever it came to the same form again, notwithstanding
something plausible at the first, was offered to the people, to procure it the
fairer passage. In a word I must confess, your liberty is as convenient as my
prerogative, and without which neither of both can be happy: Wherefore let us
resolve, that neither the one nor the other, shall be destroyed by violence or
craft; and as I will never stretch my jurisdiction to prejudice you, so do not
you abase your own liberty to destroy your selves.

But however the Kings speech was variously interpreted by the multitude, who
were bewitched with the desires of equality, yet the Gentry and Nobility, put
on such strong resolutions to defend your fathers rights, since upon that
depended the honor of their own dignities, that in a short time, as I have
been since informed, he became Master of a brave Army, commanded by his own
Nephew, called Thyasmus, younger brother to Prince Cassianus, who had been
taken prisoner by the King of Armenia, in seeking to revenge, or rather
maintain his dead fathers quarrel; from whence after some time of Noble
imprisonment, he was released without any other ransom, then that he should
never during his life bear Arms against Artaxes; which was the occasion, he
being of a restless spirit, that he sought employment in his uncles service,
and by reason of these new troubles has obtained it. And this, dear
Princess, is all the account I can give you of your fathers affairs, since I
was forced to make haste, to the ship I had hired of the Pirates for my
transportation to Tire; where being arived, afterward I took my journey to
Damascus, to Orsames Court, whom I found ready prepared with his Army to march,
to the siege of Memphis; in whose Troops I quickly made my self a soldier,
and so continued, until the Messenger that Osiris had sent into Cyprus, to
demand you in marriage of the Queen your mother, was taken by the Sentinels,
and brought into the Camp. This discovery inflamed my soul with so much
jealousy, that I begged leave of Orsames to send the foolishchalleng, that
seemed to claim an interest in your affections, for which I hope I have already
received my full correction. I, said the Princess, when you have absolutely
made an end of your penance, by finishing your story, not yet performed, since
the chief part is behind, the manner of my deliverance; which continued still
Narcissus in his relation. After that the- Herald, said he, was returned
without any satisfaction to my thoughts, in a melancholy jealousy, I retired
from the Army (it being the reason I was not in the last conflict, when the
forces sent from Sorastros entered the Town) for that most desperately I blamed
your inconstancy, since I believed you had consented to Osiris desires. In this
distracted posture I continued, until I was sent for by Orsames, to be made
acquainted with your Dwarfs arrival, who propounded to me the defigne that was
to be executed. But the Gods know, my heart being freed from that deadly
suspicion, of your being won by the greatness of Osiris person, I was ready
in my own conceit, to have reached a star from heaven, to have made you a
present, in requital of the injury, my thoughts had done your virtue; so that
I stayed not long to consider of my resolution; by which example many of the
youthful Nobility, out of emulation, determined to take my part; however, the
design was not only with a great deal of care, kept secret from the
knowledge of the common soldiers, but it was ordained by the Council of war,
that the Army it self should seem to retire from the siege, to give a greater
cause of security to the Castle, whereby to be less prepared; so consequently
the more easily surprised upon the execution of the enterprise; with these
resolutions, (being fortified with couraglous hopes, since they carried with
them the deliverie of your excellent self, from a tyrannical imprisonment,
against all the laws of love and justice) we sailed in small barks up the
River of Nilus; and yesterday by the conduction of your Dwarf, we entered
undiscovered the Iron gate of the Cesterne; where, after a little slaughter of
the negligent watch, we became masters of all the Courts of guard of the
Castle; and so with ease enough past into the Hall, until at last being
discovered by some that fled from destruction, we were encountered by Osiris,
and the soldiers that attended upon his person; which gave us again new
employment, since in truth both he and his followers, defended themselves with
a courage to be commended; but in the end, our numbers, (I cannot say
altogether our valors) made them all either our captives, or our sacrifices.
And so, sweet Princess, according to your command, you have the story of your
own power, that is able to inspire the weakest captives, with sufficient force
to become conquerours of the greatest Monarchs.

But he was scarce come to this point, when he felt the smart of a concealed
wound he had received in his thigh, which he perceived not whilst he was hot
with the fight; so that presently he desired leave to retire into his chamber,
to have the assistance of the Chirurgions; which was granted him by Cloria,
with a pretty fear however of some danger, discovered by the often changing
of color in her face; yet when he was there and disarmed, the Physicians
quickly found that it was but a flesh-wound, and therefore subject to no
hazard, though some inconvenience; before he took his rest, because it began
to be day, he commanded a Flag to be set upon the top of the Castle, to give
warning to Orsames of the prosperous success of his enterprise; which gave
occasion to the King presently, to march with his whole Army before the walls
of the Town, which struck the minds of the people, with such a sudden
amazement, that upon a message that was sent them to yield, they presently
called a Council, to resolve what answer to return to so peremptory a
demand; having also notice that Osiris was made a prisoner in his own Castle.
This procured a great mutiny amongst the inhabitants; for the Townsmen having
got the possession of the walls, by reason of the soldiers late sallie, being
willing to save their goods by any composition, resolved to deliver Memphis to
the enemies forces; whilst the others, by way of honor, contended against the
determination, not without some slaughter on both sides; however, Orsames in
the confusion assaulting the City, with the assistance of those soldiers in
the Castle, who set upon their backs, quickly reduced them to so much reason,
that the Town was willing to render upon composition, that Osirus promising to
pay such a ransom agreed upon; should have the freedom of his person, but
Orsames would not yield, to have the glory of his Conquest spotted with any
other condition, then what his own mercy was willing to grant; And with these
thoughts prepared his Army again, to enter by force, vowing the destruction of
all the Inhabitants. The Princess Cloria being informed of her Uncles
resolution, sent a messenger to desire him, that since she had been a
Captive, so long a time to Osiris power, that he would be pleased now, to make
him personally a prisoner to her will, by which means she should in some
sort, revenge the indignity that was done to her birth and condition. This
being granted, she presently sent a discharge to Osiris, to dispose of
himself and soldiers, in what way he should like for his most honor. The
Prince, although he accepted of Cloria's noble courtesy, with all the
expressions of thankful acknowledgment could be devised, wherein he professed
she had more overcome his thoughts, with her admirable humanity, then Orsames
fortunes had his person with his prevailing power; yet he assured her, he would
pay that ransom that was offered for his liberty; and withal sent her a rich
chain of pearl, of an inestimable value, which he besought her, she would
wear on the day of her marriage for his sake, as a remembrance of his desire,
to crown her Queen not only of his kingdoms, but of his heart. When the
agreement was sealed by Commissioners of both sides, Orsames prepared to make
his triumphant entry into the City, wherein Osiris was entreated to be a party,
but he not being able, to brook the sight of a new Prince, to be installed in
his right, not only excused the acceptance of such a courtesy; but after he
had given a ceremonious visit to the Princess Cloria, though carried in a
chair, because his wounds would afford him no other commodity, he commanded
himself to be placed in his Litter, and so carried to the next Garrison Town
under his jurisdiction, whilst Orsames as a most glorious Conqueror took
possession of Memphis in this manner:

First the Foot marched with Olive branches in their hands, that foretold
peace and prosperity to the inhabitants, having all their arms adorned with
Flower de Luces gilded, besides the brightness of their weapons, that by the
reflection of the Sun, gave a terrifying though pleasing beauty to the
Spectators. After these came the guard of Orsames person, being ten thousand in
number, who were so expert by reason of their continual practice, that it was
a question, whether they more honored their master in time of peace, or
defended him in occasions of War. When these were past, which shut up the
first days Triumph, the next morning the Nobility richly apparrelled both in
their own persons, and their horses trappings, were ranked according to their
degrees, who by the brave managing of their courageous beasts, gave admirable
delight to the beholders, since the Sun and the wind seemed both to conspire
in the show, for as the one gave a glittering grace to the splendour of their
habits, so the other gently playing with their feathers, rendered them more
becoming. Then the great Officers of Syria proceeded in Chariots, by reason of
their ages and dignities, with all their Ensigns of honor borne before them,
to mark out to the people the several qualities of their places, attended by
multitudes of pages and footmen, distinguished by their several liveries.
After all these appeared Philostros himself, the very soul of the Court,
carried in an open Litter, since he was not to be ecclipsed from the eyes of
the multitude, whose wisdom and power was to give them Laws: however he was
surrounded by a particular guard of his own, to prevent all dangers to his
person; and although his clothing was simply red fatten, yet his attendants
sufficiently showed forth his glory. But Orsames was seated in a Throne drawn
with four Elephantes, wherein Jupiter might have triumphed, after his Victory
against the rebellious Giants, the Statue of Mars the God of War, was placed at
his back, crowning him with a Victorious laurel, whilst many Cupids seemed to
support the curtains of his Chariot, where his guard hemmed him in from the
crowd of the vulgar, though not from the sight of the people, since he was so
high mounted in his seat. After followed the master of his horse, leading a
spare one of the Arabian breed, covered with a Caparison of watchet Velvet,
imbroidered with Flower de Luces of gold, bearing in his top a Phoenix plum,
which show being past, the Cavalry of Syria brought up the rear, who exceeds
no more for beauty and number, then for skill and valor: And in this order
followed their great master, to the chief gate of Memphis; where entering, he
was for some time enterteined, with these verses written in Capitol Letters of
Gold: Great Monarch of the earth, now as the Sun,
You do appear in Egypt's herizon;
By which reflection let Memphis towers,
Shine ever with propitious hours,
Until an influence fall from those beams,
To enrich the virtue of old Nylus sireames
That strange productions in his pregnant slyn^e,
May multiply as by a heat divine.
So shall the fertile fields in every thing,
Paint forth the wonders of your conquering;
Whilst we worship your rise with much more zeal
Then does the Abassme clothed in his vail,
When at the Altar burning sacrifice,
He does invoke a God unknown for Spice;
And superstitiously will not believe,
Natures increase but as such actions give:
But we in Hieroglyphics are bid to sear
No force but yours that turn; our hennspheare;
For if there come gentle looks from your eye,
All here is bl^st, our fruits can never dye,
Longer we shall not adoration sing,
Unto Osiris but Orsames king.


Which finished, he went to the great Temple, to offer Sacrifice to the Gods
for his prosperous victories, and afterward to the Castle, where Gloria stood
ready at the gate to receive her Uncle, accompanied by the chief Ladies of the
City.

But however every one seemed amazed, at that admirable beauty dressed with so
sweet a modesty, seeing her with bashful blashes present her first salutations
to Orsames, yet Philos whose youth and greatness might, as he thought pretend
to any love, without the contradiction of what interest soever, began to be
kindled with violent flames at the brightness of the object, though for the
present, he tempered his passion from being perceived. This continued the
longer hid, as well for want of? opportunity to operate, as because the brave
Prince of Arabia, who owed the protection of his Person and Country to Orsames,
could not choose as he believed, but honor his triumphs with some endeavors
of his own: to that purpose he proclaimed in his Camp, a Turnament against
all comers, in the behalf of the beauty of his fair Mistresle Agusta, which
took up the employment; not only of all the youthful Nobility, but also
invited many foreign Princes against the day appointed, to try their fortunes
in that generous exercise: The place designed by Orsames command, was in a
large green without the walls of Memphis; when the time came the Prince of
Arabia appeared in a white Armor, painted with craggy rocks, whose tops
seemed covered with snow; at the bottom of those hills lay a fruitful
Country, besprinkled over with buildings of all sorts; his bases resembled the
scales of Serpents, artificially represented by rich stones of several prices,
which here and there placed by the cunning workman, set forth to the life their
natural spots. The reins of the bridle, were made into the form of two
Dragons necks, that seemed to bite at bunshes of grapes hanging at the horse
mouth, which were only the bosses of the bridle contrived into that
resemblance, whilst the foame they cast about, appeared to be the poison of the
serpents; so that the bases representing their bodies, and their tails
interwoven one within another, (which made the crupper behind,) the Prince
seemed to the spectators, to have been entangled by those venomous creatures;
And the more were their fancies deceived, by reason that his Caparison was
wrought, into the likeness of a turfe of grass, all set forth with diverse
colored silks, in some parts russet and other where green, as if preserved
from the Suns violence, by the neighboring shrubs, contrived artificially in
the workmanship. In his shield was pictured a King, with a drawn sword in one
hand, and a whip in the other, whilst a multitude of common people appeared to
beg his mercy; his intention was only expressed by this Motto: However I will
prevail by love. When the Prince had presented his service to Orsume^, by the
gallant managing of his horse before his Throne, after his obeisance, he
retired to a rich pavillion, at one end of the Tilt prepared for his repose,
where he expected an Adversary.

The first that came to encounter him, was one Cosme a neighboring Prince,
though he seemed to fetch his extraction from Italy, his armor was painted
over with a stately Town, whose pinacles of the building being imbost in the
workmanship, and richly gilded, the beams of the Sun gave not a more
glorious then pleasant reflection to the beholders, whose eyes were a little
dazzled with the sight; his Caparisons were cut out into the form of half
rocks, that seemed to have lost their aspiring tops, to give the City a fairer
prospect, which covering a white horse he appeared not only to be graced by
those curious ornaments, but his courageous deportment, gave a wonderful
delight to the spectators. In his shield was pictured a calm Sea; with a brave
gally upon the quiet face of the water, laden with Merchandise of all sorts,
hanging over the sides of the deckes, accompanied with this Motto; This is my
greatness. After the Champions had performed all circumstances, required by
the Laws prescribed them, smished their six courses with so equal a fortune,
that it grew a hard question between the Judges, to which the victory did
justly belong; but because Orsames was loath so suddenly to break off the
sport, he was content without any more dispute, that his Nephew the Prince of
Arabia should still keep the field, which privilege notwithstanding Cosme
underwent with some grudging: however no defendant that entered that day into
the List, was able to revenge his quarrel, which finished the exercise until
the next morning, when the peoples early assembly, brought forth again as
great an expectation; notwithstanding it was late before any appeared, until
at last a Knight called Ferneze, shot suddenly like lightning into the crowde,
whose Arms were also of the same color; but alas he wanted force to pierce
the Princes honor: for at the third course he was carried a Spears length
from his horse, which he conceived was a sufficient privilege, to warrant him
to depart without taking leave, though he left many companions behind him, that
all run the same fortune; this saccesse not only concluded the actions of
the second day, but began to spread abroad the same of the Prince, in so much
as every one prepared, for the night revells with the Ladies, until the
Princes necessary retirement from those sports, to give himself some
convenient rest against the next trial, envited the whole company to their
several lodgings: Nevertheless, the challenger heated with his own glory, the
next day came into the field upon the first summons of Phoebus, who had newly
gilded, the the tops of the Mountains in his own Country, before his Chamber
window, as an early call to his adversaries not to be sloathfull.

But long he had not kept possession of the place, where he had extremely won
the hearts of the people, by his dexterious valor, before there appeared a
Knight in a bl^w armor, enlightened by the rays of a bright shining Sun,
that seemed to the spectators, the representation of a clear heaven; his
caparison and bases were wrought into a delightful piesage, where many flocks
of sheep seemingly, pastured by a goodly river side; in his shield he bore
only a sheep-hooke with this Motto: I have changed the Instrument: As he was
quickly known to be Navarinus, that had married the fair Mantisina, so before
he had made many courses, he was taught by the Princes valor, that there was
more safety in his former profession, which fortune also happened to many more,
that endeavored to encounter him; as namely Lorenseus husband to beauteous
Lawran; and Fridius, who thought only to have overcome by his choler; with
others of equal ambition: until about the latter end of the day, there
suddenly started out two, at so even a distance to the eye of the Judges that
it was a question, which should have the pre-eminence in the encounter.

The one was armed in a white Armor, artificially painted over with a short
mantle of Tyrian purple, that little more then covered his shoulders, his bases
were embroidered with an orderly procession of Flamins, and other Priests
clothed in white vestments, his caparisons were cut out into multitudes of
Soldiers, managing their several weapons. In his shield was pictured a
heaven, with a person in his religious habit at his prayers, though seemingly
distracted by the tumults at his back, which was explained by this Motto; I
cannot if I would. The other Knight was only armed in green, with bases and
Caparison figuring oaken leaves, intermixed with Acrons of gold: in his shield
was set forth a brave ship in full sail, though a black cloud behind it,
seemed to threaten a tempest, or rather showed it had past a storm, expressed by
this Motto: I speed me to my happiness; both striving to be foremost in the
encounter, they disputed the title, pretending each one to have the privilege,
for that they intended to defend (as they said) the admirable beauty of the
Princess Gloria, daughter to the King of Lydia: this discovery seemed so much
to increase their passion, by an appearing jealousy, that they presently drew
out their swords to maintain the rest of the quarrel, until the green
Knight by his prevailing blow, stroke off the Helmet of the other, who
appeared being disarmed, to be Philos the Nephew to the great favorite, which
as suddenly stopped the courteous hand of his adversary: so that Orsames moved by
such an accidental difference, came himself into the list, and by his own
judgment, gave the prerogative of the first trial to the strange Knight, who
as he said deserved it, both in regard of his being a forraigner, and for that
he had also by his fortune disarmed Philos.

After the King, and the rest of the company, were again placed in their
seats, the two gallant Champions performed their courses, with such an equal
bravery, that as it procured an extraordinary delight to the people, so it
raised some difficulty in the opinion of the judges, to whom they should grant
the prize; only the Prince of Arabia in his last course lost one of his
stirropes, which was the reason that the question was ouce more brought before
the King, as the supreme Judge of the sport: however the Prince, because he
would overcome the strange Knight with his courtesy, though not with his
lance, prevailed so far with Orsames, that he might buy his friendship by the
discovery of his person, unto whose honor he was willing to sacrifice the
victory, hoping to purchase thereby as he said, a greater Jewel, which was his
acquaintance. With that the green Knight presently pulling off his headpiece,
was known of every one to be young Narcissus, who understanding, that the
admirable beauty of his dear Mistress Cloria, was not yet maintained by any
valor (though jealous he proved, when he found Philos undertake the defense)
he dispensed with the inconveniency of his own wound, that appeared by his
halting, and privately arming himself came in to the List, either to be
conquered or finish his Adversaries glory.

The unexpected discovery of Narcissus person after the Turnament, gave
occasion to all the people, with a kind of a Triumphall though confused
Aclamation, to express their extraordinary Joy, in that none but he as they
said who had subdued Osiris greatness, deserved the honor of those martial
sports: however the gallant youth, esteemed his desires but half satisfied,
until he had also in some sort, procured the approbation of the beautiful
Princess, since she alone he reckoned the sole period of his endeavors:
Therefore when he had performed his humble respects to Orsames, according to
the laws of the Tilting, and the custom of the Country; he presently cast
himself at the feet of his glorious Mistress, with these words in his mouth:
As it may easily be perceived what a powerful influence, your rare perfections
have over all hearts, and actions of men, so no doubt the heavens in a
particular manner design, to render you the admirable patteme of your sex,
since your luster not only has created in me a new ability, but the very
power of your name, does induce my Noble adversary, to attribute to my small
performance, those victory, I never merited? therefore as your own goodness
will daily invite you, to frequent the gods Altars, with your welcome and
acceptable sacrifices, so must I beseech you, to vouchsafe this brave Prince
such a congratulation, as may fully pay the score of my obligation, who freely
has bestowed upon me, that by no right whatsoever could I challenge:

Cloria; although she spoke her own inward content, in nothing but bashful
smiles, yet the sparkling earnestness of her fair eyes, sufficiently showed
how far her heart was taken, with the fortunes and bravery of her servant, in
so much as the whole multitude, cried out presently for the solemnization of
the cerentonies, belonging to their Nuptials; pretending the City of Memphis
that had endured so long a siege, being at last delivered by the occasion of
their loves, might in some sort enjoy the honor of such Triumph. This caused
Orsames, to take the lovely Couple by the hands, with intention to perform the
office himself: but Cloria rather conquering her inward passions, then giving
way to her own desires, told her Uncle, that nature and education had taught
her thoughts a better duty, then precipitatly to give away her person in such
an Assembly, without the privacy and allowance of those, who had as she
conceived a principal right and interest in her disposal; The King, by reason
of this strict prohibition from such an authority, was forced to desist from
his purpose; however he could not in his mind, but much commend his Neeces.
temper and discretion: Yet poor Narcissus (who seemed at the instant, struck
with some killing disease) finding his principal hopes thus in a moment
blasted, when he thought he had had his happiness in possession, had not one
word to utter, either of reproof or persuasion, so that he could not choose,
but extremely blame such a rigid severity; until Cloria again by a gentle
smile, gave him (as he thought) some new encouragement, though no otherwise,
then like people brought upon the scaffold ready to dye, might receive from
flattering enducements, to be reprived, being only framed by their own
indulgent fancies, without any other grounds; for alas alas, Tyrant honor,
had so strong a predomination in Cloria's disposition, that death would sooner
have been entertained in her wishes, then the least decorum belonging to her
bashful principles, could have been omitted in her resolutions: In so much as
all her faithful lover Narcissus was to expect for the present, was
comfortable hopes of a future fruition: which soon conducted the whole company
to the Castle, the place designed during Orsames stay, not only for the
glories of his Court, but for the recreation of all the other Princes, who
spent the Time for the most part, in casting what honors they could, upon the
youthful lovers, whilst in the interim Philostros, was employed in receiving
and entertaining Ambassadors, that from all places came to congratulate his
Masters victories.

But of the contrary Philos, Philostros Nephew, began by little and little, to
engender dark clouds of discontent in his unquiet bosom, from whence proceeded
at last, thoughts of hatred and revenge, not only in regard of those sparcles
of love, which had flown from the bright rays of Clorias beauty, but also, for
that he found how all men's opinions, were transported beyond measure, to
magnify the gallant deserts of brave Narcissus, which (as he believed) did not
a little overshadow his own former successes in the wars. These distempers, I
say, did not alone make him all day abstain from cheerful company, but in the
night time raised, for the most part, such extravagant fancies in his ambitious
and working brain, that he remained in a manner continually tormented in his
rest; however, he endeavored all he could, to keep the passions from the
knowledge of vulgar eyes; or at leastwise, the causes of them: but as love and
envy are two properties, too violent to be suppressed in a heart inflamed with
pride and prosperity, when as their effects can hardly be protracted, Philos
was induced, after he had in a sort taken counsel of his haughty thoughts, and
digested them in the general, to comply with his resolutions, to fall upon
wicked and ignoble designs, seeing no way else could possibly bring about his
purposes, according to his own unruly appetites: And that was', violently to
destroy the innocent and virtuous loves, between Cloria and Narcissus; which
convenience and opportunity was granted him, by reason there remained certain
messengers in the City of Memphis, sent from the Senate of Lydia, among other
troops of Ambassadors, employed to complement Orsames prosperity.

To this effect he made choice of one of them, not being willing to communicate
his secrets to more, until he could find a probable assurance, his project
should heartily be enterteined: as soon as this man repaired to his presence,
after some usual speeches of kindness and flattery, he conducted him by the
hand, into a private Cabinet of his own scarce visited by any person
whatsoever but himself, being loath either to be discovered or interrupted;
where, when he had made him sit down by him, with more then ordinary
familiarity, he uttered his mind unto him after this sort.

Sir said he, as you cannot but know by that prosperous progress, which
Evarchus your King, has already made in his Wars, against the forces of your
Senate at Sardis, that not only the least assistance, but any small
discountenance from foreign Princes, will utterly destroy your endeavors,
toward the compassing of your ends, in bringing him to a conformity with your
intentions, though the world be yet scarce acquainted with what you desire; so
may you by evident demonstrations perceive, how far hither unto, my Uncle
Philostros has complied with your purposes, as well in rending Orsames
indifferent to your proceedings, both against persuasion and his own
inclination, as in seeming to countenance those actions of yours, which not
only appears destructive to his Tenants, but in a manner is against the very
honor of his family; for that Hyacinthia the Queen of Lydia, is as you very
well know, a branch of the royal house of Syria: so that by these comportments
it is plain, what obligations you own the great favorite, who carries with
him almost the power of all Asia; however perhaps you may be persuaded, he has
some other design in his heart, then barely your good, against which I will
not dispute: yet by the way give me leave to tell you, that notwithstanding
statesmen, do not use to favor any cause or party, without their own
interest, to be considered in the first place, yet of the other side, when both
benefits may go together, you ought not, either to examine the reason, or be
any way backward to entertain the occasion, but rather with violent wings of
passion fly at the prosecution; concerning which, when I shall have understood
your determination, you may know more of my mind.

It was something long, before the Ambassador returned him any answer at all,
being as it were surprised between fear and doubt, what himself ought to
think, or what the other meant to do; yet at last breaking through his
seeming amazement, he delivered these words, with a humility answerable to the
necessity (as he thought) his Masters had of his Uncles assistance, not only
to hinder any supplies, to be sent from the State of Syria to Evarchus, but to
continue still the accustomed commerce and Trade, between the two Nations,
without which it was unpossible for the Kingdom of Lydia to subsist.

My Lord (said he) As it is well known, what most glorious effects, the
wisdom and industry of your great Uncle, have produced toward the welfare
and prosperity of Syria, that in former times, continued so many years
imbroyled in civil Wars and domestic Troubles, by reason of the power and
inconstancy of the ambitious Nobility, who scarce gave their Kings, rest and
quietness from care and vexation, in regard of those hereditary commands they
challenged, by a lasting descent from their proud Ancestors, not to be bridled
by any endeavors and persuasion, which now I say by the gods goodness you
have happily suppressed: so cannot our present and well minded Senate, but in a
very high nature, not only own all those signal favors, bestowed upon them
by your most Illustrious family, in the prosecution of our late transactions
with our Prince (whom we still desire notwithstanding to love and honor,
though he seem to be an utter stranger to our honest intentions) but humbly
beg a continuance still of those benefits, as well by your countenance in the
Kingdom of Syria, as for that you have so much interest, amongst all the
Princes of the lesser Asia, who appear only to depend upon your fortunes and
success: wherefore since you have been pleased so far to declare your self
in the behalf of our Country, (the secret reason of which I shall no more
examine, then what your wisdom shall be willing to reveal, to direct those
services you would have us undertake to perform) I do faithfully promise
before the immortal gods, not only to make my Masters acquainted with
advantage, how great a happiness they may pretend unto, in the conserving
entirely your affection to themselves, but also in using what other means they
can, to become always beneficial to your principle: And with these words
offered to kiss his hands, with other protestations of his own humble
endeavors upon all ocasions

Philos by this discourse, with the seeming ernestnesse of the Ambassador,
finding in a manner he might be confident of his fidelity, when as also he had
thanked him for such effectual professions, he began again with him to this
effect:

Then said Philos, since I suppose you have judgment enough to understand your
own good, as well as to be grateful for our benefits, I will make the less
difficulty to acquaint you with this story upon which my desires must be
grounded: within this great City of Memphis; newly as I may say conquered by
Orsames fortunes, but in truth rather by Philosiros policy) there remains a
Lady of our house named Artemesia, whose beauty joined with her other excellent
endowments of nature (if it be not folly thus to speak of a sister) being
considered, without a spightfull partiality against the honor of our blood may
merit the highest preferment in Asia: between this sister of mine I say, and
young Narcissus the Duke of Cyprus Son, now present in these wars, there has
been formerly a Treaty of a marriage; however their few years and the
neglectfull prosecution of their friends in those Times gave it neither birth
or much motion: It rested in this posture until this late siege, that
Artemesia being compelled by a certain kind of a necessity, by reason of the
removal of Philostros family into the camp was compelled to accompany her
great Uncle, but since her arrival at Court, she not only became an
ear-witness of Narcissus comportment, but has also been present at some of
those archivements, comportments of his, which for the present has afforded
him a competent opinion in the Army: whether his person or his same have most
taken her fancy I will not say. But these inflammations joined with the former
Treaty, have created such an opinion in her thoughts, that she conceives her
reputation to the world to be blemished, if Narcissus be suffered to offer his
affections to any other but her self, without her privity and consent: In the
interim nevertheless understanding, that the Queen of Lydia arriving by
chance upon the Island of Cyprus, has occasioned Narcissus to fall in love
with the Princess Cloria, (whereby she esteems her self slighted: and
dishonored not only in regard of the former Treaty mentioned, but also in
that any should appear in this horizon, more worthy of respect then the Niece
of great Philostros) is grown desperate in her resolution: whether I may call
her passions preposterous or no, I will not dispute, only I may probably
believe, that Narcissus loves to Cloria, are neither grounded upon right or
reason, since as our Treaty if not engagement was begun upon more mature
consideration, accompanied perhaps with some promises of either side, so can it
not ever be thought, that the declining condition of Evarchus, will at any time
bring happiness to the Island of Cyprus; much less to the Duke thereof, when
as all the benefit he shall receive from such ambition, must be the exhausting
of his treasure, and the endangering of his command: but however he and his son
may apprehend the consequence of such a conjunction to themselves, yet no
reason other Countreies, should be debarred of their own advantages, when they
shall be offered means to prosecute their particular: It is sufficient we
think it not convenient for your state or our kingdom: which being, for the
most part, allowed common people of never so inferior a rank, much more is it
to be granted, Kings and Princes of the highest dignity: If reasons of state,
shall break and make marriages contracted by friends and kindred, what
prerogative shall be denied enemies to exercise one against another, when
either danger or benefit appears in the consequence? the gods do but unite
hearts in Nuptial Ties, for the commodity of men, and certainly all generals,
are to be preferred before particular Interests, which being granted as a
maxim, and the proof demonstrated of the good or evil, in my opinion we
ought not to stumble at the execution, for as in my own conscience I am
satisfied in the right of our pretensions. So if you may make War with your
King, because he does not satisfy the public, without any question you may
also possess your selves of all that is his, by the same Justice.

To this purpose therefore be advertized: that as it is resolved by the
Princess Cloria (notwithstanding Narcissus violent prosecution) not to make
election of him or any other for her husband without the full approbation of
her Mother, so very probably may it be conceived, that the youth will be able,
to pretend fairly to her love, being in his own Country; when as he shall not
only have the commodity of solicitation, accompanied by the remembrance of
all those services, he has performed for her honor and safety, but also for
that it may be thought by Hiacynthia your Queen, that the marriage of her
daughter with Narcissus, may prove to be a benefit of extraordinary consequence
to her husbands business, when by that means she may think, to procure
money in his Wars from the Dukes Coffers, being engaged to the same quarrel
in the right of his sons wife: besides, it is to be supposed (or at
leastwise will be so imagined) by those about the Queens person, that the
very interest of the Dukes power in the Island of Cyprus (by reason of the
numerous shipping in their Havens) will upon all occasions be able to supply
Evarchus necessities, either with ammunition or soldiers, according to the
need he shall have in his intention, against your Senate at Sardis: and who
knows not but Cyprus is a scit^ation, more proper for his affairs and
assistance, then any other Country in Asia whatsoever? All which being
considered, (though the interest of our family should not at all be concerned)
you cannot be thought competent Statesmen, if you should not with all your
endeavor, labor a breach of this intended marriage, before it be past your
reach and power to prevent: for probably the means will never again, be so
fairly presented unto your resolutions.

The Ambassador, when Philos began to take a little breath replied; that as it
was the greatest part of his own duty, to hearken to all designs, that might
any way advantage his Masters proceedings at Sardis, so would he not fail in
his own particular, but to contribute the best of his endeavors, to render
both him and his Illustrious family satisfied, hoping with all (as he said)
that the gods would largely assist to the protection of Lydia and the
prosperity of Syria; by such on indissolvable tie of friendship and commerce,
that might make Orsames give laws to the rest of the world.

Philos after he had made himself more confident, from the earnest
protestation of the Ambassador, went on with this discourse in this manner:

These two (said he) pretended lovers, Cloria and Narcissus, (who rather may be
esteemed fools in preposterous affection, then true Politicians toward a well
grounded and settled love, since as it may be thought, they neither fear
prevention or provide against accidents) are now precipitately hasting their
journey into Cyprus, where belike they hope to crown their wishes, with an
entire happiness in every kind can be desired; however they give out, their
supposed violence to be gone, proceeds from their passionate inclinations, to
receive the benedictions of their parents, after so long a time of absence from
their company and presence: but whether it be so or no, (or rather their
intentions are built upon their own private and secret resolutions one to
another, which Cloria on her part is ashamed publicly to discover) I will not
dispute; Only prevented they must be in their passage by Sea, and this cannot
conveniently be put in execution any other way, then by your brave and
invincible Navy, which will not only absolutely take off all opinion of
jealousy, in regard of your Senates difference with Evarchus, but when you
have by this means separated the young Couple, and so by consequence destroyed
their loves, you may have the benefit and commodity, to dispose of the
Princess person, to what match you shall think most probable for your
advantages; whereas in doing otherwise (whether she marry Narcissus or no) it
is likely to whomsoever she shall be contracted, both their obligations and
promises must be grounded upon conditions, to assist Evarchus in his Wars
against your Senate; which perhaps may prove of too great a concernment and
prejudicial to your affairs: in short this is all I have to say unto you,
until I know more of your mind.

As the Ambassador was very fearful to displease Philos, considering the need
the Senate of Lydia had of his Uncles friendship, so of the other side he was
most unwilling (if not partly resolved) not to undertake of himself, a
business of such a dangerous consequence, where the Island of Cyprus might
have any interest in the design; so that after something a long pawse, as if
he borrowed leave of his consideration to make a reply, he returned him this
answer:

My Lord, said he, although I would not have you in any kind think, I either
fall from my affections, or go from my professions, yet I must humbly beseech
your Goodness, I may propose to your wisdom these two doubts, that in regard
I am but a messenger, must needs rest upon my thoughts, with some fearful
apprehension, what I ought to do in the quality of my office and employment:
the first is, with what security or probability can I undertake the design?
unless I make my Masters at Sardis, acquainted with each particular; who not
only must grant out their commission to their Admiral at Sea, before any
thing can be effected, but of the other side, are to provide a considerable
number of ships, to be able to contend (if any resistance should be made with
those Vessels, that are commanded to to wait upon the Princess in her
journey; the other to be satisfied, how the Duke of Cyprus should again be
rendered pacified, after such a violence offered to a company, in whom he may
challenge an interest, but peaceably coming into his Country, from the
dominions of Orsames King of Syria: for however Cloria her self, may be
esteemed a subject of Lydia, being the daughter of Evarclus, yet Narcissus will
still be known to be the son of the chief commander of Cyprus, who
therefore ought not to have tasted of the injury; whereupon of necessity, some
dangerous consequence must follow, which perhaps our present governors, will
be most unwilling to put to the hazard:

Philos by this reply, sufficiently perceived the craft and cunning of the
Ambassador; that was not to be engaged, with any disadvantage for any party,
notwithstanding all his violent and glorious Professions: besides by his
discourse, he found (as he imagined) a great deal more affectionate desire in
his thoughts, to entertain a firm correspondency with the Common wealth of
Cyprus, then with the State of Syria; which upon any terms he was resolved to
hinder, as conceiving it extremely prejudicial to the interest of his own
Nation: not only in regard of the situation of the Island, but also for that
Cyprus formerly ever had, a most particular dependancy upon the Kingdom of
Syria, both for trade and protection: wherefore after a little time of silence,
dressing his countenance with a certain kind of scornful smile, as if not
only he contemned his doubts, but also disvalued his reasons; at the same
instant taking him by the hand, and griping it something hard, as it were
between kindness and choler, he delivered himself unto him in this manner.

Alas poor men said he, where are your courages and wisdoms? Truly for my
part, I do not more wonder, how you durst with such low thoughts, undertake
such desperate designs against your Prince, then now when you have made such a
progress in them (as I may say past any retreat) you seem to stumble at small
resolutions: no my friend be you assured, there is not any obstacle, can so
soon obstruct the full period of your designs, as the want of putting in
execution this project; for by that omission, you do not only afford your
enemy Evarchus breath and assistance, by the certain supply he shall have from
the Island of Cyprus, in regard of this marriage, but you are assured to lose a
friend of our family, who can most hurt you in these parts of Asia, not finding
you willing to pleasure us, when the occasion is fairly offered into your
hands: however that you may be converted, and made know that I perfectly
perceive your error, I shall in a few arguments, give some answer to your
fears; for I see weak digestions, must have light meats for their appetites,
not only to keep them from surfeit, but squemishnesse: I do the more
willingly study your satisfaction in this nature, that if it be possible, you
may persuade your masters at Sardis to undertake this giant work with less
difficulty: nevertheless I must also tell you, what is to be done, must be
done presently, in regard the Princess presses her departure with all
violence.

In the first place therefore that you may send to your Senate, to acquaint
them with the design intended, is not only fit but necessary, though withal
I must warn you, that it ought not to be communicated, but to a few privately,
least being revealed you not only thereby lose the benefit of the project, but
shall also contract more enmity of a ridiculous consequence against your
proceedings, having falsely undertaken (as your adversaries will interpret) a
business of this nature, that you had not understanding sufficient to
prosecute to the end: This in like manner gives me intimation to advertise you,
of only two ships providing for the young peoples transportation, the one for
Cloria, the other for Narcissus: in the next place, whereas you pretend a
fear, that the dis^urtesie showed to the Duke of Cyprus son must probably
raise a difference between your State and the Island of Cyprus, which your
Masters would be loath to venture; I must inform you, in that you show your
selves but weak Statesmen, then as it is well known by the practice of all
the laws of Asia, an enemy, where he can upon the Seas, may prejudice another
enemies particular, without an offense done to a third person, so that it is
plain you may seize upon your Kings daughter in any posture you find her,
restoring all other free persons, to the common right of Nations: besides, how
is it possible the Duke should come to be informed, of any design intended to
either? wherefore this must be esteemed as a mere accidental encounter and no
otherwise; especially when it is to be supposed your Senate at Sardis, could
not take any notice of any private engagement between Cloria and Narcissus, and
so consequently no just offense ought to be taken by the Island of Cyprus at
such proceedings, knowing what differences are daily increasing in the Kingdom
of Lydia between the King and his Subjects: and further I must tell you, that
as I interpret this project, chiefly executed for the advantage of our family,
so you may be sure to be kept in the favor of my Uncle, as if it had been
only effected in his particular, whereas in effect your Senate has the sole
benefit: It Is true, I must confess, some natural affection to my sister, has
a little raised my passion, considering how that in her person, our house is
something dishonored, yet if other maxims of State, were not to be preserved,
and put in execution, by your undertaking taking this design, I should rather
choose to leave off the enterprise, then too violently and foolishly endeavor
to satisfy a woman's humor; further in this I shall not need to reveal my
self unto you, since it is sufficient, your Masters may gain by the bargain,
and for the Dukes power to do you any considerable mischief, if he should
have any such determination, you may easily free your selves from the
apprehension of such terrors, Orsames great Favorite being your friend, when
as that Prince has not only his mere dependency upon our Court, but has
also purchased many honors, and other considerable fortunes in the Kingdom of
Syria; so that of necessity always, he must be circumscribed by our laws and
pleasure, rather then by his own will and passion: besides I am confident,
when he shall again have received his Son, freed from his fantastical love
and rambling adventures, he will easily be persuaded to believe, that he has
made by much a better exchange, then if he had been married to the Princess,
who for her Dower, could have but brought the troubles of her father, to have
incombered if not ruined his house; especially when as presently upon this
separation, the old propositions shall follow from my Uncle to the Duke,
concerning a speedy match to be concluded (if he please) between my sister
Artemesia and his Son Narcissus, which I am sure will far better content the
people, who by nature neither love Tides nor Troubles, but rather expect gain
and protection which they have from us, and cannot have by Evarchus: besides
these reasons that I have given you for your fuller instruction, whereby you
may be the better able, to satisfy your Senate sitting at Sardis, I shall
only add to your consideration this own particular: how is it possible for
you to subsist, in your contention against your King, if either we deny your
Trade in our dominions, or withdraw from your assistance the mountenous
Mysians, although we should not endeavor to set upon you, with any other
mischief: so that these things being increased, by those disadvantages we can
afford you, not only in the discountenancies of other Princes, but in such
Forces we can readily send for the benefit of your King; I doubt not but you
may be quickly convinced in your opinion, that your best policy will be, to
comply with our occasions, since we can so easily as you see blow away all your
attempts against Evarchus: with these words he offered to depart, as if he grew
something careless of his resolutions.

But the Ambassador, however he was ambitious to have still retained Philostros
friendship, without either engagement to Philos, or offense to any other State,
yet finding that as it was unpossible by any craft, to compass his designs
upon the greatest esteemed Politician in Asia, so the time for the departure of
the Princess Cloria, was expected to be so suddenly, that of necessity he was
at the very instant, to declare some settled thing in his resolution, for Philos
satisfaction and his own security: wherefore taking Philos by his robe, a
little to stay his course from going away from him, after he had thanked him,
for the generous opinion he seemed to have of his own fidelity, to the service
of his family, when he durst trust him as he said with a secret of such a
nature and consequence, he vowed not only, with as much industry and
understanding as possibly he could, to make his Masters acquainted with the
design, but also to be very sensible of the obligations due from the State of
Lydia to himself, whereby the Senate might be ready upon all occasions, to be
serviceable to his Illustrious and most Noble Family, in requital of his many
favors: when he had ended these complements (and probably they were not any
otherwise to be esteemed, since for the most part Ministers of State, are not
much troubled either with good nature or charity) he demanded of Philos,
whether or no he should make his fellow Commissioners privy to any of these
passages; for that as he said having equal authority with himself, it might
else be imputed to him as an act either of presumption, or give cause of too
great a suspicion, not to communicate the intentions to such Counsels, before
it was to be moved to the Senate of Lydia: for that said Philos, if at any time
these proceedings come to be laid to your charge as a crime, you may very well
allege my desire was, by way of condition to the contrary, in regard there
were so many spies remaining of other Nations at Memphis, that scarce could it
have been hid from public knowledge: neither would I have many of your
unnecessary Senators themselves, made knowing of such a secrecy between us, so
cautious I am in that particular: but only to be imparted to the assembly
called your Juncto, who as I understand, are the sole managers of all
transactions of this nature, whether abroad or at home: This being also
promised by the Ambassador, he intimated that Philos wonld be pleased, to
protract as long as was possible, the departure of the young Couple, not only
as he said whereby his Masters might have the better convenience, to digest all
their resolutions, to the most advantage for the design intended, but also to
have time sufficient, whereby he himself might be truly informed from Sardis
(by some of his own particular friends) in what nature, the Senate was
disposed in the prosecuting of their purposes, either against their King or any
other Nation.

When Philos had condescended to all the desires of the Ambassador, having
first as may be supposed rendered him sully satisfied in very many particulars
in State policy, which the messenger before had neither learned or understood,
they took their leaves of one another, with such an entire embracement, as if
their bodies were perpetually to be joined in nature, as their souls were
combined in the destructive designs, to the poor lovers felicities: but now
Philos being left alone, with a strong confidence of the wished success of his
unhandsome project, he pleased himself sufficiently with the consideration,
how much he found the Ambassador inferior to his skill, in political rules;
for that by a contrary stratagem, it seemed to him easy, to destroy all the
Lydian Fleet, if he did not conceive, that the effecting of this enterprise,
would be much more advantageable to his other affairs; and at the worst he
knew, it was in his power by discovering the design, before it was acted, to
create such a jealousy between the two common governments, as would always
make them at odds one against another, to the commodity and benefit of Orsames
Kingdom; which could not any way be overpowered, but by the conjunction of
those two Nations at sea, who only abounded in multitude of shipping; which
how ever she intended to put in practice, when he had compassed his own ends
upon them both: in the mean time he was content to let the Lydian Ambassador,
not only to play with his own thoughts, but to become isntrumental for some
season to his purposes; that were upon the surprizall of the Princess Cloria,
and the separation of her love, to demand Evarchus daughter of the Senate for
his wife; not doubting but the suite would be easily granted, in regard of that
friendship, they desired to maintain with his Uncle Philostros; And then also,
to make the like motion to the Duke of Cyprus, concerning a marriage to be made
between his Son Narcissus and his own sister Artemesia, which he conceived
might be done without the least suspicion he had any former hand in the
design; for he knew the Ambassador durst not reveal the secret publicly,
lest it might be suspected himself to have combined or plotted the
discurtesie, offered to the Island of Cyprus in the violence used at sea to
Cloria and Narcissus; And at the worst he supposed, he could deny at his
pleasure any such thing by him contrived though the Ambassador should affirm
it.

Philos now having eased (as I may say) the heavy weight of that burden, which
he found lay continually upon his confused thoughts and working fancy, not
only by reason of his love to Cloria, but his hate to Narcissus, began also to
think, that dissimulation from that time forward, would be a most necessary
companion to all the rest of his actions, since as already, he had betrayed the
lovers felicities in his own determinations, so were they, with others of
Orsames Court to be kept, as much as might be free from all suspicion and
jealousy, until the grand project contrived between him and the Ambassador,
(who undertook to be the messenger himself) might have a fitting convenience
to be put in execution, which he could not yet be certain of, until the
return of his desire should come from the Senate of Lydia: in the interim he
had warned the Ambassador, not to use his name to his Masters in the
particularity of the design; but rather to seem as if the consideration, had
only moved from his own intelligence being at Me^phis, of the departure of
Cloria and Narcissus: nevertheless to ingratiate himself the more in their
belief, he wished the Ambassador in the general, to intimate to his Masters
at Sardis, how great a friend Philostros his Uncle intended to be, not only to
their Nation, but also to their proceedings: in prosecution of this intention
of dissimulation, Philos put on a better countenance, in all manner of
societies then he was accustomed; intermixing himself with the most
delightful company, both of the Town and Court, and to this purpose, he would
not only often go a hunting of Estriges, according to the frequent use of the
Country, in the wild deserts bordering upon the confines of Egypt, attended by
many of the ordinary sorts of people, but persuaded the King himself, to
celebrate in an ancient Theater near the Pyramides, the magnificent sports of
fighting with Lions, and other ravenous beasts of Aphrica; but chiefly with an
intention, to entertain the youthful thoughts of Cloria and Narcissus, that
they might not so violently think upon their intended journey into Gyprus:
Amongst all these projects contrived in his brain, one day when Orsames was a
hunting, he addressed himself to Narcissus particularly, intending a little to
feel his inclinations, or rather I may say, to persuade his judgment,
contrary to the very maxims of his heart, where in a most familiar way he used
this kind of discourse unto him:

My Lord, said he, it seems strange unto me, how the glory of your youth and
valor, can be confined, to any other region in the world then Syria? where not
only worth is best understood, but virtue from thence seems to take her birth
and original; for in truth other Nations appear but to practice by her
imitation and example: Sciences there I must tell you, are taught new rules to
walk by, whilst admination stands at a maze, to behold more then could be
thought were possible, for both art and nature to produce to man's capacity to
understand: if you look at the Court, you may see, how riches and honor go
hand in hand, to work visible miracles in the eyes of all strangers, imagining
during their aboade there, they remain rather in some enchanted palaces, then
in earthly dwellings, since beauties are so numerous and excellent of both
sexes, that the variety in a manner confounds the apprehension: If the streets
of Damascus be considered in each particular, what can be more magnificent to
the view, then to see gilded and triumphant Chariots, filled with Nymphs and
Ganimedes, ride through multitudes of popular acclamations, for great Orsames
continued prosperity? youth there in academies, are taught such civility and
knowledge, that they are rendered men in all perfections, whilst they seem
scarce to be yet borne for their years: there I must say, sacrifices fly,
with so much zeal up to the heavens, from the Altars of those Temples, where
reverend Priests are ever attending, to discharge religiously those offices,
appointed them by the immortal gods; as cannot but procure prosperity to our
Nation: The victories of our Armies dispersed over all Asia, make not only
wonder at a stand, but even same it self weary with scunding: The Martial
glory of Orsames after his conquests, is a spectacle not more terrifying, then
delightful to common spectators, that are not able to understand the Theory of
his greatness: In fine, our Ladies there in assemblies, want not confidence,
to make their beauties appear to the most advantage, and yet all is so
varnished over with a bashful modesty, as if nature only had learned an art
to be best becoming; In discoursing they seem to be the fairest Syrenes,
without any intention at all of deceit, only by a Noble power, they force men
to be their captives, because virtue and honor, know not where again to be so
well satisfied, as in that imprisonment: if our laws and policies be observed,
they rather teach preventions, by their thretned severity and wise cautions,
then have any intention in their constitutions either to destroy or circumvent
people; all which being considered, I see no reason why your excellent virtues,
accompanied with an age not yet exceeding eighteen, should want those
justifiable ambitions, as not violently to covet against all obstacles, such
rareties that can only bestow upon you luster and greatness, when as the
contrary perhaps, will render you less famous then you are; for nothing, but
because you have not yet tasted personally of those perfections in Syria,
granting in your own particular, you are already furnished with them, in a
large measure beyond other people: but perchance you may say you have not only
seen Damascus already in passing by: but the glory of Orsames in these Wars,
which I must tell you, is no other then to behold beauties in the night, or the
King in his eclipsed splendour: all which my Lord I only say, to give my self
the greater happiness, by enjoying still your company, not knowing but these
motives, might divert your present intentions from Cyprus, with that excellent
Lady the Princess Cloria, whom you seem to conduct, which office I cannot
deny, but in it self is a most supreme happiness; but since it may be
conceived both the Dake your Father, and the Queen her Mother, would be glad
of the occasion in their own persons to visit Orsames Court: me thinks you may
have reason enough to alter your resolution: when he had done Narcissus
answered him in this manner:

O Sir said he, you are mistaken, a stronger influence a great deal, draws
both my thoughts and person into the Island of Cyprus, then all those rarities
you have numbered up in the Kingdom of Syria, since one perfect carbuncle (by
whose light I must sail) is more worth, then a thousand other stones of less
vallew: And if you would behold beauties indeed, look upon the fair Lillies
and Roses in Cloria's cheeks, whose dainty mixtures in the whole, appear to
be a sweet and heavenly garden, composed of such flowers, that the earth cannot
parallel either in taste or color; whilst her fair eyes are two powerful
suns of equal brightness, that can illuminate all places of the world
alike, though never so much darkened by natures malice, if she but there
vouchsafe her presence: her perfections I say are books sufficiently
instructive, to teach the world knowledge and science, in which are to be daily
read, multitudes of several varieties of that excellency, that greatest
Doctors know not how to define them, but in loves Academy; when she moves, you
may behold a certain shining throne of sanctity, whereon are placed Altars in
abundance, whereon are only Sacrifices offered to her self, of wounded hearts
that need compassion; when as in the interim her music, when she pleases,
charmeth mortals with a ravishing delight, to such ecstasies of pleasure and
content, that they seem to be ambitious of no other happiness: you speak of
glorious victories gained by your powerful Armies; when as every look of
hers, is able to conquer whole Nations without resistance, and Favorites to
Kings, must of necessity become slaves in those Triumphs: These last words
could not choose but reflect upon Philos, apprehending that either Narcissus had
some inckling of his intentions, or that a divine inspiration had secretly
instructed him in his thoughts and desires; wherefore at the instant he began
to blush, with a certain kind of inward guilt, that proceeded from his
apprehension rather then his judgment: for the gods knew Narcissus only
spoke, by the mere instigation of his own partial affection, produced from the
flames of his constant and virtuous love, hearing Philos utter such vanicies,
in commendation of his own Country, to the disparagement of all other places.

But how this discourse, or rather Dialogue would have been concluded between
them, can not well be determined, since a great Panther belonging to those
deserts, lying secretly in certain shrubs by the side of a poole, not only
for the present interrupted them, but violently flew upon Philos, as he rid
along with Narcissus; which quickly overturned both him and his horse, to the
apparent danger and hazard of his life, but that Narcissus having a small
hunting spear in his hand, quickly stroke the beast so fortunately in the
breast, that the blood soon followed the wound in great abundance; however the
furious, or I may say rather valiant creature, seemed so little to be
discouraged by the stroke, that with an appearing outward rage, to find
himself so assaulted contrary to his expectation, looking first upon
Narcissus, as if he either challenged him with unkindnesse or ingratitude, for
having attempted him without any provocation, and then turned his eyes again
upon Philos, as if yet he made some question in his thoughts, whether he should
release his seeming conquered Captive, or be revenged upon his injurer, at last
flew at Narcissus with such a spite and violence, as not only put him to his
best defense, but undoubtedly had prevailed exceedingly to his prejudice, if
Philos had not hastily disingaged himself from the inconveniency of his fall,
and made have to his assistance: as fearing else his own death might follow,
which soon obliged them all three to a most sharp and desperate combat: And
however the Panther received multitudes of wounds by their industry, insomuch
as it was unpossible for him to escape destruction, yet with his claws,
seizing by chance upon the left arm of Narcissus, he made in it so deep an
impression, that he tore part of the flesh from the bone, showing that he was
even ambitious of revenge in his last end; for presently in a staggering manner
(not having strength sufficient remaining, to support any longer his own body,
which one might perceive his courage was loath to confess) he fell backward
upon his tail, and so rested for a great space, panting and blowing with open
mouth: but both Narcissus and Philos, not being very willing to complement with
his intentionall fury, gave him so many other strokes in all parts, that not
long it was before they left him for dead, in the interim many of the hantsmen
coming into the place: but the beast, as if he yet retained some vigoar or
malice in his heart, notwithstanding for a long time there appeared no life at
all in him, whilst the company were discoursing severally of the accident and
encounter, and applying some remedies to stop the bleeding of Narcissus wounded
arm, the Panther of a sudden, not only again revived, but flew violently
upon one of the dogs lying near him, and bit him so, that the blood followed,
which in a manner startled the whole company thinking him to be dead: wherefore
again they set upon him, though with a jesting violence, until at last they
made him sure from doing any more hurt to them or any others:

However this unexpected wound, which Narcissus had received in his arm, from
the sharp claws of the Panther, was not esteemed by himselse either dangerous
or worth much consideration, yet by way of convenience if not necessity, both
he and the Princess Cloria were forced for some time longer, to put off their
journey to the Island of Cyprus, which seemed much to comply with the contrived
design of Philos, for their surprizall at Sea by the Lydian fleet, since for
some days Narcissus not only kept his chamber but his bed, which however
afforded him many visites, from all the youthful. Nobility of the Court, as I
may say in some sort seemingly glad of the accident, whereby he might by reason
of that necessity, be still obliged to remain in their company; This cure of
his, protracted the time so long, that the season of the year drew on, for the
ceremonious cutting of the banks of the River of Nilus, whereby the whole
Country of Egypt might be fludded, to augment its fertility; or rather to take
away the natural barrenness of the soil, which would be occasioned by such
omission: To this work of industry belonged certain triumphs, that had been
time out of mind instituted, by the ancient Kings that governed the people,
which custom, as the inhabitants (by a certain kind of superstition in their
dispositions) every year most religiously observed, as believing in some sort
their wealth would increase with their devotion; so Orsames himself, whereby
the better, to retain the affections of his new conquered Subjects of that
Nation, was persuaded not only to be present at those sports in person, but
Philos thinking it also a most opportune occasion to demonstrate his Uncles
greatness, resolved to entertain that night, the whole company of Princes at
Memphis, in a most magnificent manner, though his chief intentions were to
see, whether he could by that means, the sooner disjoyne the affections of
Cloria, to whose honor he seemed to consecrate his feast, whereby more
particularly to bestow the loves both of her self and Narcissus, upon him and
Artemesia, by reason of a certain kind of luster, domineering as might be
thought more in their family, then any others visible in Asia, in regard of
Philostros intimacy and power with Orsames: these were his fantastical
thoughts, grounded only upon opinion and his own ambition, when as the
virtuous loves between Cloria and Narcissus, were established upon diamond
rocks, not to be shaken by any blasts of greatness or fortune.

When the day came for this mighthy ceremony (the people being assembled upon
the banks of the River) the whole afternone was spent, in the taking and
destroying of Crocodiles, which with certain baited hooks of I^on, were by
their huge bodies drawn out of the water, to the no small amazement of those
strangers, that had never seen the like before: The young men also of the Town
in new Barges made for that purpose, offered many delightful sports, in a
kind of a rural triumph before the Castle; where also was the great Cesterne
which has been formerly mentioned in taking the Fort, marking out to the
Inhabitants the rise and fall of the River, by which conjecture the fertility
and scarcity of the years appear: This Cesterne they not only adorned with
many Garlands and preparations for fire-workes, but Roxana's dwarf, that had
been so great an actor in the surprizall of the Castle, was upon an open
Theater presented to the view of the people, casting out to their expectations
Orsames bounty: all which notwithstanding were designed, for no other then
preparatives for the nights ceremonies.

At what time Philos, according to the circumstance of his invitation,
conducted the Princess Cloria to his lodgings, in full opposition to the other
Castle, with the rest of the Noble company then remaining at Memphis; and
however Narcissus felt some incommodation, in regard of the wound he had so
lately received, without any great imporunity was persuaded by Philos to be of
the same society; it being in some sort also intended for his entertainment,
that he might not only be an eyewitness of the glory of Philostros family,
but (as the sequel will testify) have a view of his intended Mistress
Artemesia Philos sister, having never during his abode at Memphis beheld her
person, though for what reason, was not known by any.

The room that was designed for the Feast was perfectly Ovall, crowned on the
top with a brave Cupelo, according to the antic Egyptian manner, adorned
almost all over, with ancient Hieroglyphics in Mosaic work: the Galleries of
each side for the commodity of Music, were wrought into several intricate
knots of gilded brass, intermixed with other colors, for the more beauty of
the eye: the table it self also answered exactly to the ovall proportion of
the room, leaving a convenient space from the wall, for the commodity of
necessary attendants: it was in the middle hollowed in a large measure, to take
off a part of its breadth, the company only being appointed to sit, without any
opposition to one another: however in that seeming vacancy of the board, was
erected from the ground a most stately fountain (that at least reached half
way to the upper part of the seeling) where appeared, the goddess Diana and
her Nymphs bathing themselves, cut out in most excellent white Marble, which
being also intermingled with certain artificial Trees, according to the nature
of the Country, it afforded a most delectable prospect to the beholders; and
the rather, for that the Fountain being built, in a seeming cristall lake of
clear running water, brought thither by the ancient Kings of Egypt, with
infinite charge and admirable skill, not only proved exceedingly, to be a
commodity to the Feast, but a refreshment to the company; especially for that
from their seeming naked breasts, there continually run, into several small
vessels appointed for that purpose, all sorts of excellent Wine, both Greek and
Aphrican, where dainty boys stood ready to dispose of it to the strangers,
when any pleased to call for it, of each sort: the company at the first
entrance into the room, seemed to be a little amazed at such a magnificent
beauty, which they knew not of to be before in Memphis; though the building had
not only long time ago, been erected by the greatest Monarchs of those parts:
but the place it self had for many years past, been reserved superstitiously
by the inhabitants, for no other use, but for the celebration of the day and
night, when the banks of Nilus were to be opened, to let in the water over the
Country. Thus they continued casting their eyes about at several varieties
(the Music in the interim, meeting with the concavity of the fabric, to the
best advantage to the care) whilst of a sudden, there flew open a two-leaved
door, that directed its prospect, through a large and long Gallery into
another room, at the upper end of which appeared a Lady sitting on a Throne';
however at such a distance that her countenance could not be perfectly
distinguished: but being soon conducted by Philos toward the place, she was
quickly discovered by his information, to be his sister the most fair
Artemesia; at leastwise so esteemed in her own opinion: and truly was so in
effect, if her mind had in every kind been answerable to her body, since any
way wanting the inward beauty, some defect of necessity must be in the whole;
and so consequently not most fair: Upon their approach, they found her
encompassed by many Negro slaves, who with huge Fanns in their hands, appeared
to give her breath and refreshment: but why only so accompanied, could not
well be imagined, unless it were by the blackness of her attendants, the
better to set forth her own beauty in the apprehension of the spectators: when
they came at something a nearer distance (for before she would not seem to
rise) in a certain kind of careless posture, she descended from her Throne,
whilst the lovely Princess Cloria, (with another kind of quickness in her
carriage, made up between courtesy and good nature, wherein pride had not the
least interest) addressed her self to give her an affable and fitting
salutation, proceeding not only from the gentleness of her disposition, but
the gratitude in her thoughts, in that her brothers entertainment, was wholly
upon the matter (as was pretended) intended for her welcome and reception.
Nevertheless Artemesia met her with such a countenance, as if she yet made
some question, which of both was to be esteemed the person of most dignity;
however at last Artemesia gave Cloria the better hand, though with that
demeanor, that did more divulge her insolency, then show her judgment to all
the assembly: but self-opinion, when only governed by an imperious soul,
accompanied with passion and prosperity, can have no other cure, but either by
destruction in effect, or contrary fortunes in possession: but all this, as it
should seem, was to gain a heart from poor Narcissus, that was aready
captivated by a stronger influence; who, though he had understood her meaning,
he could not have been brought from sacrificing to virtue and goodness, to
have committed idolatry before a painted image; wherein was contained, as might
be thought, nothing but pride and vanity. To be short, these ridiculous
passages in a ceremonious march, conducted them to take their places. The feast
it self did not exceed more in sumptuous magnificence, then in exquisite
curiosity: for the fruits seemed rather all growing upon natural Trees, there
conveyed to their taste by industry; whilst birds of all sorts in the interim
flew about the room, warbling forth such variety of notes, to entertain the
company, as if they had been taught their skill by excellent masters. And the
more admirable it was, in regard the clarity of the place, by reason of an
artificial splendor newly created, proceeding from diverse places in the room,
rendered their several colors to the view, more beautiful then they were by
nature ordained. It were a kind of gross simplicity to talk of abundance, when
as the power of Syria, joined with the fertility of Egypt, conjoined with a
full, if not (as I may say) an omnipotent ability, to persuade love, and show
greatness.

But however this entertainment seemed to be the provision of many ages, and
the feast intended for some years continuance, yet that nights ceremony
(though customary in it self, yet at the present, ordained for the sight of
the greatest esteemed Monarch in Asia) could not wait upon any other intention
or convenience; wherefore, the company being advertised that Orsames with his
Favorite in the other Castle, were already seated, expecting the show, in
something a confused manner rise from the Table, leaving all other services
behind to be recommended only to fancy and imagination; since every one hasted
to those windows upon the River, that were most, convenient for their
purposes: for that already the fire flying in the air, and the Trumpets
sounding upon the land, appeared to sense, as if the heavens had changed, their
stations: for as the night seemed to be day, by a contrary, though a more
illustrious reflection, so mortals might be thought to have assumed to
themselves the property of gods, in regard of the resplendent glory of the
King, who sat upon the top of the great Castle, encompassed about with such
multitudes of lights, and that variety of attendants, that he seemed not only
to be the conqueror of the earth, by a just right, but even to claim an
appearing and divine interest, of something miraculous during his time here
below. In fine, nothing could be seen more splendent for the time; which drew
all the eyes of the people upon his glory with such an amazed joy, that searce
could they with hearts and cries, abstain from open Idolatry: but
notwithstanding all these inticements of sense, Artemesia (however more
bewitched in her passions then any other) could not be persuaded, neither by
her brother, or the rest of the company, to be at all a spectator of those
sports: but whether out of a vain imagination, that she seemed in her thoughts
to contemn every popular spectacle, as being a great deal below her aims and
designs? or whether she could not brook the competition of Cloria's beauty and
dignity? or indeed was truly Melancholy as Philos had informed the Ambassador,
it is not to any great purpose to determine: only it was visible that in a
kind of a disdainful posture, she without any manner of salutation to the
company, retired suddenly into her chamber.

Notwithstanding all these passages, Philos, whose heart and thoughts, were
already too violently set upon his own particular concernements, (however he
found more cause of despair every day then other, of parting the young lovers
affection, although he might by the success of his designs sever their
persons, and had made his sisters preposterous passions, in part, as a stale,
the better to compass his own ends) though he would have been most willing
also, to have rendered her entirely satisfied, in regard the contrary (as he
thought) something conduced to the dishonor of the family, began a little to
consider what he should do at the present: wherefore because he would leave no
way unattempted, that might pretend to probability, and finding the Princess
Cloria, at a window alone, earnestly beholding the fire-workes and other
pastims, answerable to the season, which seemed something convenient for his
purpose, he began a discourse to her in this nature, as he had formerly done a
hunting to Narcissus, although the noise of the people below upon the banks of
the river, seemed not very well to comply with his intentions:

Madam said he; you may here behold in part, the infinite glory and happiness
of the King your great Uncle in his own proper Sphere, the rich City of
Damascus: but presently finding she could not perfectly understand what he
said, by reason of the cries and shouts of the multitude, thongh he perceived
an inclination in her courteous disposition, to harken to the matter of his
discourse, as well as the sound of his word, drew her by little and little from
the window, until they were both retired to such a distance, that they had
free liberty, to understand what each other would deliver, which made him begin
again in this manner.

Truly said he, since these magnificencies now beheld, are no better then mere
shadows, to what brightnesses Orsames enjoyes in his own Country (of which
you have already a large share by birth, being sprang from that flourishing
tree, of that Illustrious and Royal house of Syria, and ought to have more in
my opinion by possession, in regard of those rare perfections, which both art
and nature have so liberally bestowed upon your self, to the wound of your
Sex) I cannot be but something amazed, if not scandalized how your thoughts,
can carry you into any othrr region, (especially having such conveniences)
before you had tasted of those excellencies in Syria, that may not again be so
well understood and apprehended, as by such curious fancies as yours, that are
able even to add a new life both to them, and to every thing else you see and
hear: I must tell you most admirable Princess, that the Nobility of Syria in
their own proper Elements, appear rather like so many sovereign Lords
themselves, crowned with honor and respect, then Subjects to any mortal King
whatsoever, by reason of their commands and dependencies, not any way to be
equalled, or made less by what power soever, (continuing in Orsames favor)
but as their own retirements, sometimes give them appetites for private
recreations, whereby they become familiar and solitary; Alas dear Madam said
he, did you but behold the glorious Palaces of Damascus, with other rich
buildings of lesser note, (only appointed to be the habitations of Merchants)
you would think this great esteemed City (so much extolled by the boasting
Egyptians) to be but an unfurnished village, in regard of its magnificence and
splendour; and for the Island of Cyprus whither you are how going (which I must
confess I admire, since the Queen your Mother by your attraction, would
suddenly be enduced to visit Syria) ought to be esteemed in your view and
apprehension, a poor and contemptible part of the world, only ordained to
breed up a few petty persons, of no honor and birth, as common drudges through
the world, whereby to maintain the better trade and commerce, for the benefit
of our people; which country notwithstanding without Syrias immediate
assistance, can neither defend it self in time of War, or preserve it self
in time of Peace: To this greatness and prosperity of the Syrian State, as I
will not say my Uncle Philostros, gives our flourishing fields greenesse, or
causes the earth in due season to produce bountifully to the inhabitants, yet
I may boldly affirm, that his faithful policy, has rendered Orsames great and
mighty, and so consequently his Subjects happy and fortunate, other people
being over runne-by their enemies, whilst we make War in all Countries to our
advantage, though but in part demonstrated by this City, not only as you see
made subject by strong hand to our power, but in the inhabitants, being
persuaded upon the matter in a moment, willingly to obey our laws and
jurisdictions, as the great acclamations of joy, now offered to Orsames
prosperity, in the present feast of cutting the banks of the River does
witness: by Syria I say you shall be honored as a goddess, and in Cyprus you
cannot be maintained as a Princess, in the one your worth will be lost for want
of knowledge, when as the other shall give you more valewed, in regard there
are beauties also worthy of esteem: the rich Palace of Orsames, can afford
you a habitation fit for your Dignity, when all Cyprus shall scarce grant you
convenient entertainment: with these words, taking her fair hand as the last
period of his discourse, he bestowed as many Syrian complements upon the
subject, as would have created it an Idol, if Cloria had been any way
indulgently superstitious in her own concernment.

But as the sweet Princess took these glorious expressions of Philos (not
being any whit suspicious of his inward intentions) as mere gallant
courtships, whereby to furnish out the rest of his entertainments (though she
could not, but have reason as she thought to smile at his vanity) so of the
other side, hearing, as she imagined, rather blasphemies then disgraceful
speeches uttered, not only against that Country, she had already partly
resolved to make her own, but as it were in disparagement of the honor of
that Noble family, from whence her dear Narcissus was extracted, which she
knew yielded to none in Asia, either for personal worth or antiquity in
descent, could scarce forbear the returning him a most sharp reply: however
again considering, the pretentions of his magnificent entertainment, to be as
it were wholly consecrated for her satisfaction, she let his words pass at
the present, either a^ high flowne expressions, proceeding from his passionate
youth, whereby himself might become the better esteemed, or from some
customary discourse or volubility of tongue, incident to the nature of his
country men: yet would not abstain from telling him (though in a kind of a
jeering way) that as her own small experience, in the glory and bounty of many
places in the world, bestowed upon them by the gods favor, or natures
partiality, was not of a knowing confidence sufficient, to judge of their
valors (which made her really in her own thoughts, satisfactory contented,
with what she has already seen in some States, and was in part borne unto in
her fathers Kingdom) so should she ever hold it, but a fitting obligation
belonging to her duty, first by her personal presence in the Island of Cyprus,
to enquire after her mothers pleasure, and then to be absolutely directed by
her will, either to wait upon her into Syria, or to any other region where
she should command; which also was delivered, with such a kind of vermillion
blush, as very well demonstrated, that rather anger then bashfulnesse, exacted
from her that beautiful Tincture: Philos scarce expected from her reply such
an answer: yet putting on in his countenance, a certain confident smile, made
up between displeasure, and the opinion he might have of the Princess want of
experience and breeding, to deal with him in discourse, continuing still
notwithstanding his intention to mix some flattery with his words, he quickly
made her this return: O Madam, said he, do not so injuriously tax your own
judgment, but rather lay it upon the obstinancy of your own will, which is a
property I must confess incident in a most high measure, to all those of your
Sexes; that is not to do a thing, because you will not do it, and not for
that reason, and consideration tells you, it may be the best. Truly Sir,
answered the Princess, as I thank the gods, I find not in my own nature,
such an obstinancy as you speak of, so cannot I yet be diverted from these
maxims, that I have learned in my youth: which are, that obedience to my
parents, and a contentedness in disposition, ought to be esteemed neither
folly or impiety, but of contrary, wisdom and goodness: I confess the same
replied Philos: but when the one may be conserved, and the other increased,
certainly we ought always to apply our endeavors, to the greater commodity
and benefit: as for example, if you now go along in the company of your great
Uncle Orsames to Damascus, you shall not only with a world of honor and
respect gain those experiences, of beholding the excellent rarities of the
earth; but the Queen of Lydia your Noble Mother, no doubt will be sent for
with all expedition, both to accompany your fortunes and content. Cloria having
formerly heard by discourses from the Queen and others, that Philostros,
Philos Uncle, was not only a maine obstructer of her Fathers designs, but was
also absolutely against her Mothers coming into Syria, could not forbear, but
plainly to tell him her thoughts in that particular, with some tears in her
eyes, as if her apprehensions anew, began to work toward the affairs of
Evarchus her Father in Lydia: insomuch as he might easily perceive, there
rested in her mind (notwithstanding other diversions) certain discontented
motions, concerning his Un^^^ usage of the Queen in her distresses, not ^^^^ng
so much (as she was informed) ever invited her into Syria, notwithstanding all
her misfortunes and oppressions of her own Country; but rather was a means to
divert Orsames her brother, from either giving her countenance or reception;
though grounded principally (as it was conceived) upon his spleen, that Anaxia
the old Queen of Syria, had been so nobly entertained in Lydia, having been
banished from her Sons Court, only by his power and greatness: what the se
quell of these discourses would have produced, cannot well be imagined, for
that diverse of the company, being already sufficiently tired with beholding
the fireworkes, were retired into that part of the room, where Cloria and
Philos were discoursing, which for that time not only ended the dispute, but
took off all occasion to begin anew; neither indeed was there any commodity at
all for it, since the whole assembly one with another, fell into diversity of
pleasant communications, which in truth was a great deal more proper for the
season then those of another nature, that had happened from Cloria only by
accident; though of the other side, they might be occasioned by reason of
Philos passions and underhand designs: however the company continued,
confusedly mixed both in persons and language, until they were invited into
another room, to taste the delicacies of a Banquet, provided for their nights
refreshment, that appeared not more curious then magnificent, as it were
designed to close up their expectations, with the reallity of what, was again
unpossible to be paralleled by any other Nation: it might be esteemed an
impertinent vanity, to dwell here again upon descriptions, since not only by
what has been already said, the rest in part may be imagined; but the time of
the night also calling the company to their rest, may very well give a full
period to Philos sumptuous entertainment, though in them according to his
expectation he found not his wishes satisfied, neither in his own violent
affections to Cloria, nor his sisters preposterous passions concerning
Narcissus: which was the occasion, that being retired into his private chamber,
instead of sleep, he became encumbered with diversity of troublesome thoughts.

Philos as I say, being withdrawn into his own solitary lodgings (in imitation
of the rest of the company to the outward view, thought not to the same
intention, according to his inward disturbances) began more seriously to
reflect upon his purposes, considering not only the progress he had made in
them, but the issues consequently were probably to follow; To this effect in
the first place he found, it was unpossible to remove the settled affections
between the young lovers Cloria and Narcissus, as well by their manner of
discourses he had made to them both, in the commendation of the Syrian
excellencies, as by diverse other reasons and circumstances, that he had
observed in either; which made him belive, as the combinations he had made with
the Ambassador, would prove to little effect to his benefit, so would they be
of most desperate concernments to those sweet and innocent creatures: next he
laid before his remembrance, not only the gallant bravery of Narcissus person,
in many attempts he had made at the siege upon the Egyptians, having withal
in a manner saved the life of his Uncle Philostros in the fight, as another
time his own from the fury of the Lion, but also more particularly he
reflected upon the courteous disposition of the Princess Cloria,
notwithstanding her dignity and quality, accompanied with her excellent beauty
and rare perfections, not to be equalled again in all Asia: Lastly, he
considered with some horror, what a world of inconvenience his family had
brought, upon Evarchus and his Kingdom of Lydia, not only at the first, by
stirring up of the ungrateful Myssians, to contend with him, but also in
discountenancing of Hiacynthia the Queen, in her solicitations with Orsames her
brother for her husbands interest; however there seemed to appear no other
reason for these latter evils, but that Anaxia the old Queen of Syria (being
in disfavour with Philostros) had been received by the Court of Lydia, with
some more then ordinary affection and ceremony. These considerations after a
long debate privately in his own bosom, made him at last utter this language:

O Heavens, said he, with what a Torrent of impious madness, are mortals
carried on in their courses, when they steer their actions only by ambition,
and fill the sails of their intentions, with nothing but violence and pride? O
wise moderation that should temper the heat of all our passions, and make us
rather good then politic, to what region art thou flowne, to seek virtue and
quiet? what if our endeavors, could attain every day to new conquests, until
the world should become ours by the sword, accompanied with blood and
slaughters, what were the purchase worth, still living in distempers and
vexation? does more Titles any thing else, but serve to create new appetites,
which daily increase without satisfactions? what serve command and greatness
but to inflame desires, that torment day and night our over indulgent thoughts,
with restless labors of such impatiency, as absolutely destroy those
felicities, that only nature and reason should delight in? do we eat or
sleep better, because we are great and mighty? or can all the passionate
acquisitions of the earth, in honor and dignity, render us healthful if we be
diseased, or make us fall back one year from our age, either to grant us more
vigor or longer being? will not the fast coming on of that allotted time by
the divine powers, mingled with gray hairs and wrinkles, soon put a period to
all those vapors of delight, which we rather imagine then possess, though we
sho ^ld live to the uttermost date of all mortality? of the contrary, the gods
only know, by what accident we may be cut off, before that expectation can be
performed, to an eternal forgetfulness perhaps, both of us and our actions: O
sacred truth, if not religion, said he, let me here invoke your productions, to
accompany hence forward all my intentions, with that power and assistance, may
make me at leastwise to act temperately in what I go about: with these
thoughts though not settled determinations, within a while he fell asleep, and
so continued, until the cheerful morning brought unto his chamber window the
Sun, being the bright governor of the day, that soon dispersed from his
imagination, all those melancholy vapors of the night, that had set before his
more recollected fancy, the lively representation of his own condition;
insomuch as he not only again flew from his pious thoughts, but was content
to persuade at last his understanding, that as the business in it self was
not of any wicked nature, in regard of the interest of Crowns and Kingdoms
(that seemed to claim privileges and maxims, above all morality and
religion) so was it unpossible for him, (since the Ambassador of Lydia was
himself departed from Memphis) to frame any probable way for prevention,
without indangering his uncles honor; upon which, as he pretended, depended
the whole welfare and absolute prosperity of Syria: These flatteries I may say,
made him resolve to let the young lovers to run their own hazard, rather then
endanger such an inconveniency to fall upon his family: so apt are men in
worldly honors and happiness, to entertain all unjust chimeras, that tickl^
up those indulgent apprehensions, that only correspond with sense and
appetites: Thus again was he confirmed in his untoward faith, made up only by
his own desires, without any Counsel at all of virtue: so that with the same
garb and greamesse as he was accustomed, not only went out of his chamber,
attended by multitudes of flattering suitors, but according to the dissembling
custom of that policy, which properly belonges to the actions of Statesmen,
he salluted every person he met, with several voluble complements, that were
of force sufficient to have made them believe they had absolutely his heart in
all their petitions, if experience had not taught them oftentimes the validity
of favorites words: however they were to comply in countenances, as he did in
language: which continued all things in a seeming calm in the Court of
Orsames, until the two young lovers Cloria and Narcissus, could be no longer
persuaded to stay, by the alluring enticements, magnificences, and pleasure of
the same: wherefore, as a couple of gallant ships were provided for their
transportation, (since for the honor of Syria it was not held convenient, one
vessel should contain both their persons, though the lovers themselves were
not well pleased with the ceremony) so Orsames himself, would needs accompany
them from Memphis to the sea side: In the way they were met by diverse petty
Tryumphes, from those Towns as they past down the River of Nilus; which
however protracted the time, longer then Cloria and Narcissus desired; not
only in regard of their own passionate desires to be in the Island of Cyprus,
where they might have the opportunity, to prosecute the period of their wishes,
according to their dictates of love and engagements; but for that they both
knew also their affectionate parents, waited for their arrival with a most
violent zeal, having been a long time before hand, by themselves advertized
of their coming.

So that after something a long and tedious journey, (because they so esteemed
it) they arrived at the last Haven in Egypt; where the fair and gallant
prospect upon the sea, gave their eyes no bounds, but what the maine Ocean was
content to afford them; which proved delightful enough, in regard they had
been so long a time shut up between other varieties.

As this gave some period to their wishes, of imbarking suddenly for the Island
of Cyprus; so the chief Nobility of the Court appeared discontented at the
resolution: for if the men honored, and took a singular contentment in
Nancissus Noble virtues, his gallant presence being accompanied with youth and
valor, so had the Ladies of Memphis no small delight and satisfaction, in
Clorias affable conversation; who had accompanied her in her journey; since she
had not so much pride in her disposition, as to be either humorous or
neglectfull, although she never wanted a sufficient Majesty in her carriage, to
make her self reverenced of all, according to the dignity of her person: to
say the plain truth, she had a familiarity that persuaded love from the
meanest, however she never failed to procure respect from the highest. And
however, many crosses had rendered her thoughts inwardly something musing,
nevertheless the greamesse of her discretion, always so tempered the
prejudicial properties of it, that those inclinations of melancholy, were
never visible, but to her governesse Roxana, in her own private Cabinet, when
they entered seriously into confideration of their fortunes, which a certain
kind of necessity sometimes seemed to exact from them both: if at all she
appeared a little amazed at her frequent disasters, it was rather a mark of her
extreme innocence, then any courage she wanted to sustain her losses; as it
were in a manner not believing, that it was possible for people to be so
wicked, and the gods still to continue entirely patient. These are the
attributes, (if not much more) that all indifferent tongues and pens must give
her. And the Syrians in the general, were loath to send away out of their own
possession, such perfections into another Country, which they esteemed far
less worthy then their own; or rather, that she accompanied with those
excellencies, should be lost from their society and expectation; which I must
confess, made her fair person aptly to be likened to a rich enameled case,
all set over with Diamonds, and other precious stones; that notwithstanding
within, contained a picture that was not to be valued by any estimation: only
some sympathy remained by a divine determination between the two lovers; for as
she was pleased by her very election, to parallel with her self Narcissus, so
he could love no other ever, but excellent Cloria.

In this posture, I say, when they came to the sea side, (in the interim the
King leading Cloria by the hand) the sweet Princess, with a few beautiful
tears in her fair eyes (being, as it were, loath to depart, though she
desired nothing more then to be gone) fell down presently upon her knees, with
a certain gentle intermixture of grief, made up between sorrow and
bashfulness: which however it for some space hindered her expressions, yet at
last she took her leave of her great Uncle, in these words; May all the gods
send you Sir, said she, both victory in war, and prosperity in peace, until
the very world grow old with your fame: but the King quickly stopped her
imprecations, by two or three loving kisses, imprinted upon her fair lips;
which kept in the other part of her discourse. Whilst Narcissus in another
place, with a smiling countenance (as it were besieged by multitudes of
embracements) dispatched his complements as fast as he could, since he
imagined, they gave his thoughts scarce any thing but trouble and impediment,
in that already all his wishes and desires were directed to another region,
which seemed more violently to carry his ambition, then the Southern winds
that attended at present to drive them out of the haven: only he appeared yet
something unsatisfied, when he remembered that his love was to be transported in
one ship, and he in another, by the rigid rules of honor belonging to the
Syrian Nation. When they had been conveyed (after all their complements) by
many of the Nobility, into the gallant vessels, that lay some distance from the
shore, the Trumpets of either side sounded their departure, as if they intended
to summon the gods to bestow a blessing upon the voyage: when presently the
sails being displaied, and the pendants and colors let fly to the best
advantage, they lanched into the d^epe, where Neptune again seemed most
willing to take their protection, since scarce a wave moved other then gently,
to give them any manner of dist^rbance.

Th^s in a kind of a certain supposed tranquillity (by reason of the calm) they
sailed for at least twelve hours, as it were playing with the winds, and
contemplating the waters; and the more pleasant and satisfactory it was, in
regard of the sea-mens sometimes casting out their nets, to catch fish, for the
delight of the Princess, and the rest of her attendants.

Whilst the company employed their thoughts with these entertainments, the
Mariners began to fear a change of the weather; as well for that many
Dolphins appeared oftentimes to show themselves above the waves (an indubitable
sign esteemed of a storm) as also for that the wind of a sadden had altered
its station a great deal more Eastward, which as they perceived, diverted
their course from the Island of Cyprus, and carried them directly toward
Crete: the other ship in the interim, where Narcissus was, seemed to be at some
distance, having got the start of them, by reason of those sports the Mariners
had presented to the Princess.

Neither were their expectations long deceived, for presently they might
observe, not only certain black clouds to unite together suddenly in the East,
but the winds began already to bluster, with something an open mouth. As this
warned the Princess Cloria to retire into her own Cabinet, so the Mariners
busily employed themselves, to put their ship in a posture against all
accidents; being the more precipitate in their intention, for that it wanted
not much above an hour to night.

The storm increasing, Cloria within a short time, not being able longer to
brook the tossing and rolling of the seas, cast her self down upon her bed,
to take off, as she imagined, the distempers and incommodities of her
indisposition; in which posture notwithstanding, her fancy proved as well
disturbed as her body, since both the cracks of thunder, with the uncouth
whistling of the winds in the night season, became a great deal more
unpleasant to her apprehension. However she was tied to those observances,
until it should please the gods, either to calm the seas, or put them in more
security; But it should seem neither her prayers, nor her companies wishes,
were able at all to prevail with the divine powers, so far as to make them
in opinion confident of their own safeties. Until at last it was necessary,
not only to take down all the chief Tacklings belonging to the ship, but also
the main Mast it self: desiring they might rather, commit their fortunes and
preservation to the mercy of the seas, then any more rely upon the winds
courtesy and gentleness, since they could not cast in their Ankors to any
effect, by reason the water was so deep, and their Cables (as they knew) not
strong enough, to sustain the force of the tempest; which seemed rather to
increase in violence, then to give them hopes of abatement.

In this danger and perplexity they continued many ho^res, the gallant vessel
all the while being tossed from one billow to another, as if the waves intended
to show to the heavens by their lofty motion, how much they disdained and
scorned any control; whilst the ship notwithstanding with a brave kind of
fortitude, seemed still to contend against the rudeness of their malice; in so
much as (however being rather desperately wounded, then absolutely overcome)
she made her way through the seas with incredible celerity, in regard of the
strength and highness of the wind, though she wanted both her Sails and
Masts: but the Pilots not being able to inform themselves, which way she
steered her course, by reason a thick mist, had overclouded the superficies of
the water, were put again into new doubts, lest they might fall upon some rocks
to their ruin, though there was no remedy; for as all was to be left to the
hazard of the seas, so their trust in supernatural mercies, was to be their
chief comfort: notwithstanding this more then desperate danger, poor Cloria
seemed in her inward thoughts, to be more solicitous for Narcissus safety, then
for her own preservation; as it were invocating privately the pure heavens to
that purpose, whilst the rest of the company sent out their prayers also to the
gods in their own behalfes.

It was about noon the next day before the winds abated, when the Mariners
informed the Master, they spied some land at a good distance, the sky having
suddenly cleared much of its darkness; And not long after they might perceive
many shallops upon the seas belonging to poor fishermen, casting their N^ts
into the water.

As this gave them all sufficient cause of joy and encouragement, so did they
presently let out the longboat, that they had drawn in to the ship during the
storm, with intention to enquire of those people, not only near what coast
they remained, but how they might by their directions, provide in the best
manner they could, for their convenience of landing, whereby to repair their
vessel.

It was not half an hours time, before the boat again returned with this
information, that as the land they were near was part of the Island of Creet,
so not above half a days sail from that place, was the fair haven town of
Pergame, whose governor at present, was a great Noble man of the Country
named Dedalus, that notwithstanding the Island was divided into many factions,
by reason of the differences between Euarchus King of Lydia and his Senate, had
kept that City wholly for the Kings interest: this news you may be sure, had
put the Princess Cloria in such an ecstasy of joy, as would have created an
entire felicity in her thoughts, if she had not in the interim, called again to
her remembrance, her separation from Narcissus: but the company, rather
flattering her opinion, then assuring their own thoughts, that undoubtedly he
was past all hazard, being in so good a ship, she was quickly persuaded to go
to Pergame, resolving there to remain, not only whilst she heard some news
of Narcissus; but during a necessary convenience might also be had, for the
repairing of her own ship, being as they told her absolutely incapable (before
she was mended) to make any other voyage whatsoever: she condescending to this
counsel and advice, some of the fishermen were quickly hired with store of
money, to be their guides and conducters to Pergame: so that presently tying a
strong Cable to the great vessel, and setting many Rowers in one of the
biggest shallops belonging to the Fishermen, they haled her along the seas
toward the Haven, as it were in a kind of pleasant Triumph; which they might
the more commodiously do, for that now the wind being in a manner wholly
allayed, they seemed to enjoy upon the water a sufficient calm for their
purpose.

But notwithstanding this commodity, it was almost the whole day, before they
could draw their ship, near a point of land that bordered upon the haven; so
that Cloria was forced for one night, to take up her lodging in a poor
cottage: however, this gave her thoughts more satisfaction then the stately
vessel belonging to the kingdom of Syria, had her body in the storm. When
the day came, as it was determined, to continue their resolutions for the City
of Pergame, so was it held convenient before the Princess approach, to give
notice to the Governor, of her accidental arrival, within the dominion of
his jurisdiction. This was quickly put in execution, by sending a messenger
before; whilst they themselves within two hours space, were set a shore upon a
promontory not many furlongs from the Town. The sweet Princess walked upon a
green walk, pleasantly set with Trees, when Dedalus the governor of Pergame,
accompanied by many Gentlemen of the Country, and attended by one Troop of
horse presented himself before her; not only to give her reception into his
territories, but to undertake in the King her fathers behalf (he being, as he
said, his Deputy) all the entertainment that poor king^^^^^ being (lately much
beaten with war) could afford. You may be sure Cloria was not backward to
give him thanks, assuring him of her kind acknowledgement of his endeavors.
This conducted her to her company quickly (for the time was not proper for much
complements) to take possession of a brave, though ancient Castle, seated upon
a little rising at the further end of the Town, whilst the inhabitants in the
interim, being placed in order of each side the streets, gave the Princess a
joyful welcome into that City, which her father (as they said) had never
visited: so being at last brought into her chamber, with other ceremonies, it
was not long before she went to bed, as well to rest her mind, as her body;
however she first desired the Governor, to send out some small ship of his
own, then lying ready furnished in the Haven, to hearken out some tidings,
concerning the other vessel of Syria.

But however thus (by the goodness of the gods, the sweet Princess had in a
manner miraculously escaped the danger of the seas, that seemed in some sort
even ambitious of her ruin, coveting perhaps to have entombed so dainty a body
within their uncouth intrals; yet could she not so soon shake off the
malevolent effects of those distempers, that had discomposed her during the
tempest; which however they put her not in any danger of life, yet they did not
only keep her from being visited by any whatsoever, but for the most part
continued her in her privatest chamber for a long time, where only Roxana and
some few servants more attended upon her person.

This gave the opportunity one day to Roxana (her Lady being asleep) to
enquire of Dedalus, concerning the affairs of the Island; since, as she said,
there could not choose but be many things worth the knowing, in regard of
Euarchus contention with the Senate, belonging to the jurisdiction thereof.

Truly Madam, said he, as the passages have been lately many and strange, in
this most unhappy Island of Creete, so to give you the better scantling of the
businesses, that from time to time have happened, I must in some sort begin with
the original, when the Country first became under the Lydian power and
jurisdiction. And to this purpose therefore you must know, that after the
generation of the gods had totally left Creete, to a certain kind of wild
barbarism, not only in the manners of the people, but in the rudeness of the
soil, for want of being industriously manured, some of the ancient Kings of
Lydia conceiving, that the Island lay convenient for the jurisdiction of their
own Crown, both by reason of the natural fertility of the ground, as in regard
of the safety of the Harbors, began to create some ambition in their thoughts
to be Lords of it; yet knowing, they could have no Title to the Country in
their own right, but what the laws of the sword might violently (if not
injuriously) afford them, made earnest solicitation, to the great Arch-Flammin
of Delphos, that in respect of the degenerating of the people, from all
religious maxims, with the practice of other inhumane customs, (pretended to
fall upon it for want of order and government) he would be pleased, under the
sacred banner of his holy protection and power, to grant them the principality
and jurisdiction of the Island; upon the condition nevertheless, that they
should still be obliged, to observe those rights in their sacrifices to the
gods, as were only used in the Temple of Delphos: with these Titles and
pretenses, many of those Princes, taking always advantage of the inhabitants
factions and disagreement amongst themselves, sent several Armies either by
force or policy, or both, to conquer the Country: which, to be short, within
some few years was totally effected, notwithstanding now and then many
contradictions, and disturbances happened, proceeding rather from the inconstant
natures of the people, then that they had any great cause, to complain of
their subjection to the Lydian Laws and government. This gives me occasion a
little to digress from the matter of the story, with some explanation of the
disposition of the ancient Natives; which in part perhaps has caused so many
changes, and revolutions in our Island. It Is true, they have bodies capable of
such labor and activity, as might enrich the Country, if their minds were
answerable to their composure and making; but they are so extremely lazy and
proud by nature, that as they had rather beg or steal, then work, or take
pains; so does the soil wholly upon the matter lie unmanured; rather chasing
in foreign parts any servile office whatsoever, then they will make the best
of their own livings, and estates, at home in their own Country: whilst their
wives and families also in the interim, are content to seek out new and strange
fortunes, with whole troops of attendants; not omitting nevertheless the least
part of those ceremonies, that belong to persons of the greatest quality,
although every night they lie in barnes, and in the day feed scarce upon any
thing, that can afford nourishment to their appetites. The women may be said to
be rather chaste by nature, then that they can give any reason in their own
thoughts, why they are honest at all; for that commonly they sleep altogether,
without any distaste in the general, or the least show of jealousy in the
particular; a laudable property, incident to most barbarous Nations, however
perhaps merely proceeding, from want of luxurious enticements, that use to
inflame lusts in dispositions. The men are valiant enough in the wars of
other countries; but whether by constraint or nature I will not say, since at
home it is most apparent, they even want courages to defend their wives and
children, rather trusting to their own craft and subtilty in circumventing
their enemies, then any way desiring with their swords in their hands to
oppose; perhaps thinking it a folly, where they any way can get advantage to
complement about honor; for no people in the world hate with a more
unrelenting spite, or revenge by a more hidden cruelty. When they go to the
wars, whole Troops and families follow, to accompany their friends, out of
kindness; though their intentions for the most part are thereby, to pillage
camps of either side, according to the fortune of the day. Concerning their
religion, though they do exactly adhere to the ancient rules of Delphos, and
that with a seeming zeal outwardly, yet seldom or never perform they those
rights, with an intention to observe any morality; in so much as it may be
said, they rather use such cermonies, because they will not change customs,
then that they hope to receive absolute benefit by them; in this manner being
content to suffer themselves to be flattered, only with an opinion they do
well, when they will not take any care at all to be better satisfied. In
conclusion, they love to talk of lands and possessions, withheld injuriously
from their right, but never attempt any means probable to come to them again.
And this, Lady, being as near as I can guess, the truest character of our
common people, I shall again return to the prosecution of our story.

As I said before, after the Kings of Lydia by many defeats given to some of
the principal of the Nobility, that esteemed themselves Princes in Authority
and command, if not in Titles and right, had settled an absolute Monarchy in the
Island, by degrees, the people were brought into a kind of slavish condition,
since they conceived, they were fitter to be made obey then to command, not
only in regard of their lack of knowledge, and constancy in the general, but
also for that the governors perceived, that however they wanted sufficient
industry to manage the Counsels, as well as their laws in their own
Country, yet they had spite enough against the jurisdiction of strangers: It
was sufficient they did not affect other Nations, and therefore could not love
the Lydians, insomuch as notwithstanding the apparent benefit they found, by
practicing and using the Lydian customs, in many things concerning the sowing
of Corn and the like, they rather chose to undergo the penalty, for their not
putting them in execution, then they would in any kind subject themselves, to
those laudable and profitable observations; as if their pride appeared
sufficiently satisfied, in not seeming willing to follow that which certainly
was the best, for no reason but that it was prescribed them; however I must say
the Noble men in the general, were not only for the most part very much
civillized, but extremely affected to the Crown of Lydia, as knowing from
thence were brought learning, riches, and education: though some great persons
amongst them, notwithstanding rather endeavored to head many barbarous
factions, (out of I cannot tell what manner of sordid ambition) then they would
either come to Court themselves, or seem to hold, any friendly correspondency
with any of those that did, though they were of the same blood and kindred with
themselves; which not only raised many jealousies amongst the Nobility in the
particular, but always caused a great Court suspicion, concerning the
affections of the Nation in the general, so that those that for the most part,
attended upon the person of the Kings in Lydia, notwithstanding their
continual industry, to do their Princes service, were looked upon with no
eyes of favor and grace, by reason of this unpolished ambition of those Lords,
that still addicted themselves to the old Cretan manners; as it were loving it
for no other cause, but that it seemed to thwart and contradict the Lydian
customs: This pride indiscreetly executed, at the first I say, created
jealousies in our Princes, which again returned hatred to us; wherefore, as
the wisdom of councillors, thinking to provide against rebellions, would
never make choice of any of the natives for governors, so the natives thinking
themselves dishonored thereby, were unwilling to obey such Commanders set over
them: upon this followed complaints on all sides; And many of our Lords, not
dring to dispute the right of their justifications in Lydia, oftentimes forbore
to appear upon summons, so that advantages being made of their fear, rather
then knowledge of their crimes, their estates became confiscated for their
omission, which of necessity enflamed their hearts to thoughts of more
disloyalty, until at last their spleen (joining with the humors of the
people, who had not much to lose because they would possess but little) made
them at last fall into an open Rebellion, which for some years filled our
Country with blood and slaughters.

But now Madam said be, as I have but hitherunto presented you with a glass,
whereby you may the better understand the story I am to tell, so shall I in as
brief a way as I can, repeat unto you not only the occasions as I conceive
of the late Tragedies, acted in this poor and unfortunate Island, but also
make you acquainted with the very realities themselves: to this purpose I must
say in the reign of a late Queen of Syria, a woman endowed with admirable
gifts of nature, as also had a spirit answerable thereunto, (whereby she
seemed to give her undertaking countenance) fell out both with the Arch Flamin
of Delphos and the great King of Egypt at the same time: the first she
pretended usurped an unjust Authority, over her Subjects and dominion, as the
other she alleged, too ambitiously endeavored an universal Monarchy over
all Princes: these differences likely to go into some desperation, between
these mighty persons and the Queen, gave causes sufficient of admiration to
all these parts of Asia; and the rather for that, as they could not well
comprehend, how such a masculine courage could be in a woman, so did they as
little know, in what manner she would defend these extraordinary breaches: but
experience quickly made them see, she not only intended, but prosecuted her
intentions with all vigor: for as she absolutely abolished within a short
space, all the jurisdiction of Delphos out of her Kingdoms, so did she within a
while after, give the King of Egypt such overthrows by sea, that scarce could
he in many years recover his losses. In the interim, whilst these
contentionswere acting, with no small violence of all sides, to the contentment
(if not amazement) of many other Princes, that esteemed the differences a king
of safety to themselves. The unwise Island of Creete, believing they might
again recover, either all or some part of their lost privileges, (pretending
they were obstructed in their religion) not long after entered into open
rebellion. To tell you, that the maine motives of their risings, proceeded from
the instigations of Egypt and Delphos, is not an improbable conjecture; since
as the one in a ceremonious assembly of Flamins, declared the Queen an accursed
enemy to his rights and jurisdiction, so did the other send Forces into Creet,
to strengthen the people in their pretentions; which however these assistances,
seemed not to prevail entirely against the Queens governors in the Island,
yet apparently they procured her officers, so many disturbances from time to
time, that however she neither failed them with supplies, or was wanting to
them in counsels, yet for many years together, the rebels kept a considerable
body in the field, in despite of all the Queens forces.

In this manner these contentions continued many years; for as the Queen
seemed with majestic spleen, to be enflamed with her subjects disobedience,
so were her subjects in their rage animated by messengers sent from Delphos, to
put them always in mind of their religious obligations: whereunto being added
their hate to the Lydian government, and the confidence they had of Aegypts
assistance, they seemed oftentimes to have received a new spirit of valor,
contrary to their nature and custom; however for the most part, they rather
made use of their subtilty, in sending out small parties to circumvent and
entrap the enemy, then being willing at any time to hazard in the field a main
battle, to decide the controversy; which was the reason the war was so long
prolonged, with several suceesses of either side: for as the Creetans had the
advantage, of perfectly knowing the country, amongst woods and bogs, so had the
Lydians a great deal the better in their conduct and resolution: but which way
soever businesses went, as the rebels were conducted by a Nobleman of the
Nation, whose family and name was as great amongst the people, as his spleen
and courage was against the Queen, so became the State of Lydia exceeding weary
of the war; being most certain, the money disbursed in the contention, would
never by any conquest she could make of the Island, be again repayd into her
coffers: wherefore, after some deliberation it was resolved, to send over a
principal Favorite of the Queens, whereby to put the sooner an end by his
authority and fidelity, to those chargeable and bloody differences, that not
only destroyed her people in the Island of Creete, but disquieted her own
government in the Kingdom of Lydia: and the rather was it so determined, for
that she had been persuaded, that the soldiers of her army in this Island,
lengthned the war on purpose, for their own benefit and command; knowing,
when that should be once absolutely finished, their esteem at court, would
fall with their want of employment in the field: but contrary to her
expectation, this favorite of hers having more ambition then foresight, (since
he was sent away only by his enemies, to separate him from the Queens person)
as also being more vainglorious in his thoughts, then experienced in his years
(and so consequently not having much knowledge either of the Country, or the
enemy) after a most vast expense of money, and nothing in a manner acted
against the Rebels, he returned again into Lydia, with disgrace and dishonor;
which at last by reason of his subtle adversaries practices, that undermined
him in the Queens favor, he lost his head upon a scaffold, by the common
Executioner; in whose place notwithstanding, such a brave personage was sent,
that in a very short space, reduced the Rebels to so much necessary reason,
both in their persons and estates, that they offered quietly to submit to
mercy, without either condition or contention. This being entertained, and the
people ready in all places to lay down arms, the Queen her self suddenly
changes her own habitation here, for a more lasting one in another world; that
made all things at a stand for a time. But as Euarchus father met with no
opposition, in that possession that belonged unto him with so much justice, so
upon his first entrance into Lydia, he was presented with an absolute
submission, not only of the great Noblemen of our Island, that had for many
years contended with the Queen, but also of all his party, that were neither
few in number, or penurious in fortunes. Nevertheless, although this King was
merciful enough in his disposition, as well to pardon all faults, as to forget
former disaffections, yet the hungry Missians his natural countrymen,
perceiving that the forfeitures of the Island of Creete, by reason of the late
rebellions, were not of value, to be returned back again to the owners, without
some profits made thereby; and finding the situation and fertility of the
country able to make full reparation to their greedy stomachs, for the defects
and sterility of their own habitations, not only persuaded the King, that his
act of mercy would prove of dangerous consequence to rebellious dispositions
hereafter, but obtained at his hands, so many grants of possession in this
Island, that gave them sufficient convenience and authority, to transport a
great part of their own people hither, where being established after a while
with peace and security, by their industry, joined together with their power,
they soon outed most of the inhabitants of their estates; and at last took from
all in general both their liberty and religion; in so much as many ancient
families were either turned a begging in their own Country, or forced to seek
servile offices in other parts, for subsistence. This,; must say, is the common
allegation of the natives and in part true, although I must confess much of
their miseries proceeded from their lazy dispositions (as I have formerly said)
that would not permit them, to equal other Nations in painful endeavor;
rather choosing in their natures to be wanderers, then become willing to submit
their persons under the jurisdiction of better customs. But be it what it
will, in this condition they remained without any power at all to act, until
the beginning of these differences, between our King Euarchus, and his great
Senate; when the people, (not having altogether forgot their old hate to the
Lydians, and now finding some opportunity to express it) began anew to fly
out; however the particular causes were these: When the Myssians first
proclaimed their dislike, by leading Armies to oppose Kingly authority in their
own Nation, one Polinex, once governor of this Island (though since destroyed
for his service) prepared a company of expert soldiers, to be employed against
the Myssians, as esteeming them most proper to the purpose, in regard of their
hate to those people: but, not to detain you over long by needless
repetitions, and circumstances of things which are only conjecturall, After
that our King, Euarchus, in a manner had committed the mannagement of affairs
into the hands of his great Senate of Lydia, it was not held either needful by
way of opposition, or convenient by reason of the expense, to continue afoot
those soldiers, that had been leavied and provided by Polinex, in this Island
of Creete; wherefore orders were presently sent to disband the Troops; but in
some sort nevertheless to give them satisfaction, lest they might prove
dangerous and troublesome to the government, they gave them what liberty they
pleased, to contract with other Princes, for their future entertainment in some
foreign wars. However the Myssians, when they perceived the soldiers were
thus by bargain to be transported; either fearing their return in a body to
their prejudice, or rather (I may say) envying all felicity of theirs, made
earnest suit to the Senate of Lydia, (with whom then they held a most intimate
correspondency) not to suffer them to go out of the Kingdom. As these
persuasions prevailed, before the consideration of the contract made for their
transportation, so the people of this Island; being not only inflamed with
these injurious proceedings, as they esteemed them, but also fearing an utter
extirpation of the whole Nation, by reason of the malice and practices of the
Myssians, of a sudden (having entered before into many consultations amongst
themselves) began as well to make use of those arms they were already provided
of, as to seize into their hands many strong Towns in the Country; however in
the interim, they set forth many Proclamations in their own defense; which in
effect were to this purpose, that in regard the King himself had in a manner
lost all his own prerogative, whereby he was formerly empowered to govern; they
in their own behalfes now were necessitated, to take up arms for their
preservation both against Myssia and the Kingdom of Lydia, that sought not
only the abolishing of their Religion, but an extirpation of their persons:
but however these pretentions were plausible enough; and perhaps no otherwise
meant by them at the first, yet the outrageous violence committed of both
sides, soon drew many Commanders of Greet from other parts, who instead of
contributing their endeavors in making only a defensive war, they violently
persuaded the people to stand upon their own pretended privileges before the
conquest; as having either Kings of their proper Nation, or at leastwise no
strangers to command over them; whilst they themselves also began to challenge
old Dignities and Titles, with the possession of most of the Lands in the
Country, that for many years had belonged to other persons and families, that
perhaps had bought them to them and their heirs, at most valuable and
considerable rates. This in a very short space set the whole Island in such a
burning and outrageous flame, that slaughters of such execrable natures were
committed, (to the very horror, as I may say, of mankind) both my self, and
some other Noblemen of the Country were forced to take up arms, not only for
the defense of our persons, and estates, but to bring the people of both sides
to a better temper: wherein, for my own part, as I used what moderation I could
in executions upon my conntrey-men, at what time so ever I gained any victories
over them, (which truly was not very seldom) so by this means their hatred
began to be augmented toward me as against a Myssian enemy: in so much as they
began to form orderly councels of their part, as we did entertain with
regularity those supplies were sent us out of Lydia; for however they had the
greatest part of the Country at their dispose, yet we held the most commodious
for our parpose; things resting in doubtful though bloody conflicts, until
the differences between our King Euarchus, and the Senate now remaining at
Sardis, began to take up new considerations, in the thoughts and appetites of
all sorts of people, that had any relation to the Lydian government; wherefore
the King having drawn armies into the field for his own pretended defense, as
the Senate had raised forces to contend against his intentions, the soldiers
under my command, being more desirous to serve in the Lydian wars, where gain
and honor were (as they thought to be obtained) then to remain here without
either pay or benefit, both they and my self in a particular way, endeavored
to serve the King against his Senate; and of a sudden, shuffling up a truce
with the Rebels in these parts, upon their faithful promises, not only to
submit to their Princes pleasure, upon reasonable conditions, but further to
assist him in his present wars, both with their persons and estates, I sent
all the soldiers presently to the Kings armies, keeping in the interim this
Town, with some other under my jurisdiction, to be disposed of as he shall at
any time appoint. In fine, as this is as short a relation as I can make of
those accidents, that have befallen our unhappy country, from the beginning of
the Lydian rule, so cannot I but esteem my self extremely satisfied for the
present, that although it has not yet come within the compass of my ability,
to do the King any remarkable or profitable services; that the Princess Cloria
is not only her self in person, come under the power of that command I hold
under her father, but that her distresses and necessities at sea also have been
in part, relieved by the natural situation of this Island of Creete, which as
a good and luck Omen, will preserve it hence forward, I hope from destruction,
if not grant it a better blessing, then lately it has received from the favor
of the heavens; and with these word, accompanied by such a look, that was
capable enough to win belief, concerning his affectionate endeavors to the
King, he ended his discourse.

Roxana, after she had returned the Governor thanks, with two or three sighs,
to express in a sort her inward sorrow for the accidents, as it were both
pitying the people, and doubting the event, (since as Dedalus himself seemed
not overconfident of his power, so had she heard of many factions in the
Island:) she desired him, that he would be yet pleased, to augment so far her
obligation, as in a few more words, added to his further trouble, to let her
know, how the common interest at present stood in the country, as well in
regard of the King, as the Senate; for that himself appeared not to have (as
she said) an absolute command through the whole Island.

Dedalus soon replied, That as he could not much brag of the affections of the
inhabitants, concerning his own particular person (not only in regard he had
given them, as he said many desperate overthrowes, in their late contentions;
but for that he was not of the same opinions with them in the worship of the
gods; upon the which they seemed to ground their chief dislikes against both
King and Senate) so could he easily resolve her, that the country in the
general was divided into three factions: the first, being for the King
entirely; the second inclined to the ancient natives, and the third was wholly
addicted to the Senates interest, but whether in the end will prevail, said
he, the gods only can inform; since, however the first seems to have the
best right, yet the two remaining exceed in power and probability: the one
being better furnished with money and provisions, as the others are accompanied
with numbers and violence. As he was about to proceed in his discourse, they
were both advertised of the return of those messengers, that had been sent to
enquire after the safety of the other ship wherein Narcissus was; who being
presently called into their presence, one of them gave this short account of
their voyage by Sea: having for many days, said he, not oneiy coasted several
Islands belonging to Greece, but much also of the continent appertaining to the
lesser Asia, we could have no news ar all of any such vessel, either
shipwrackt, or put into harbor; until at last by chance we met with a
Merchant of Rhodes, going for Carthage, who informed us, that for certain
before his departure from that City, a gallant ship both with Syrian and
Egyptian Colors, was arrived in the chief haven belonging to the Island,
however much beaten and torn with the weather: but what people or commodities
were contained in her, he said he could not inform us, in respect he himself
was under sail upon his departure, when that ship came in.

The Messenger also added further, that a great fleet of Lydian vessels, that
were newly come upon the seas lay between Rhodes and Cyprus, which hindered them
for the present, for making any further enquiry or experiment, since if they
should have approached the Island, as he said, it had been almost impossible to
have escaped, by reason they could not but have easily been discovered to be of
King Euarchus party: it is not to be doubted, but as this intelligence
sufficiently satisfied them, concerning the safety of the other ship, so did
they haste to the Princess chamber with the Messengers, to give her
information of the expedition, which for the present hindered the period of
Dedalus relation, concerning the passages of the Island, according to his
intention.

To the Reader.
Courteous Reader,
YOu have now the Second Part of Cloria and Narcissus, sooner sent after the
First then was determined, in regard the Stationer was something pressing to
have it with the former: perhaps it may give more satisfaction then the other,
for that (according to my apprehension) it does as much clear difficulties, as
can well stand with the nature of a Romance. More I shall not need to say, to
any other purpose, then what you may read in the Epistle to the first part.

Only, judicious Reader, craving your favorable construction of all such
faults as may have escaped in both parts, either by defect of printing, or
otherways by oversight of the Author.

THE SECOND PART OF Cloria and Narcissus.
AS the Princess Clorias thoughts now were reasonably well settled, concerning
the safety of Narcissus, in regard of the messengers relation, so Roxana with
more alacrity and cheerfulness, summoned a a new Dedalus, to make an end of
those passages belonging to the Island of Crete; whereupon one day meeting in
the same walk that had entertained the Princess, upon her first arrival in
the Country, they both seated themselves together under a tree, artificially
made into an Arbor of pleasure, that had its full prospect toward the sea;
whilst he gave her this further account:

Madam said he, as for the interests which I formerly mentioned unto you not
many days since, you may be pleased to know, that as Evarchus our King in his
Wars with the Senate of Lydia, must be forced upon all occasions, to court
any assistance whatsoever for his best advantage, so of the other side do the
Cretans resolve to make use of their present power, to gain benefits to
themselves, and party in any thing they can procure, either from their Prince
or any other: to this purpose, after the agreement that I told you of, which I
made with the Natives of the Country, (however many of the most rigid sort,
would not at all come within any manner of communication, whereby to be subject
to the Lydian power, thereunto encouraged as it is supposed by a messenger from
Delphos, that neither understands the Islands interest or the peoples good)
they designed Commissioners to be sent to Philadelpha, where the King then
remained, to Treat upon such conditions, as they conceived most necessary for
their commodity and security: Thus arriving at court, in a short time they were
not only admitted to kiss the Kings hands, but withal permitted to present
their Petitions and requests; for this ceremony (and so I may well call it,
since it produced but small effects, to the advantage of any party) there was
appointed a great Hall in the City of Philadelpha, into which place the
messengers were brought with some State, as soon as the King was seated in his
Throne, because they should not complain of the want of any circumstance, that
belonged to the solemn entertainment of Ambassadors of other Nations, to
make them the willinger to comply toward the assistance, desired: After they
had been in this manner received, as also with good language from the Kings
own mouth cherished, they presented a paper that contained these peremptory
demands: First they desired to have, not only the free exercise of their
religion through the whole Island, notwithstanding the Lydian laws to the
contrary according to the rights and customs of Delphos, but withal to enjoy
the use of the best Temples, alone appropriated to themselves, with all the
rents and privileges that of old at any time belonged unto them: Secondly,
they expected an absolute concession from his Majesty, that no governors
whatsoever of any foreign Nation, should be appointed over them in Creet or
in any Fort or Island belonging to the same; besides they refused to admit of
those of the very Country it self, unless they were confirmed and approved of
by the gentrall council, which they had established to manage and odered all
their affairs both in peace and War: And lastly they expected, (as the
writing which they had delivered the King expressed) an absolute restoration of
all those lands to the true owners, that had been taken from their possession,
by reason of any former pretended rebellion, and given to the Myssians or
Lydians, either by the old Queen of Lydian, or Evarchus father: The Kings, as
I was informed after he had read these propositions, seemed to the outward view
of the assembly, extremely troubled in his apprehensions, as if he had been
exceedingly deceived in his expectation, concerning the good nature and reality
of our countrymen: however, notwithstanding he was by this means sufficiently
inflamed in his thoughts, in regard of these proceedings; (not only in some
sort disdaining to be thus handled by his Subjects in his necessities, but
being also with some reason suspicious of their intentions, as fearing that
they aimed to become Masters of the whole Island, and so by consequence to be
possessors of most of the Lands of his best friends, who were actually employed
now with him in his Wars) yet conceiving that he was not at the instant, in a
capacity to show much discontent to any party, that could either good or hurt
him in his present differences with the Senate, he gave their commissioners at
leastwise fair words in the general, promising speedily to send particular
messengers of his own into Creet, not only more knowingly to Treat with them
concerning their demands; but withal, if it were possible, to conclude with
them concerning his own desires, which he conceived would be for both their
advantages, against the common enemy, that had an intention to destroy either:
in this manner they were dismissed into their own Country, party pleased, and a
great deal more unsatisfied, in regard no more life remained from their
employment, then the expectation of the coming of the Kings officers: But in
the interim whilst these messengers were looked for, both the Kingdom of Syria
and the Country of Egypt put in for their several interests, as well
concerning the government it self of the Island, as to be supplied from hence,
with Soldiers in their Wars, one against another; the State of Syria went
only upon the score of Evarchus right and Titles, though Sorastros challeuged
their affections in his service, by an ancient Tie as he said they owed the
Egyptian Nation: neither as I told you formerly, was the Arch- Flamin of
Delphos backward in maintaining to the uttermost of his power (by the industry
of some instruments he employed) his own jurisdiction above either; as
pretending the best right to the same, by reason of those agreements that had
been made with the Kings of Lydia, who first conquered this Island.

These attempts I must say, extremely divided the inhabitants both in their
actions and opinions: for as the more moderate sort of people (especially those
that had any correspondency with the Lydians, either by extraction or commerce)
were willing enough to continue the old government, and retain both their
laws and customs they had formerly used, so the violenter part of the
Natives, that had time out of mind contracted a certain kind of barbarism
in their manners and dispositions, would hear of no agreement, but what was
prescribed them by a few commanders, that were sent from the Egyptian Wars,
who seemed only to comply with the religion of Desphos for their own ends:
The people I may affirm with some confidence, were so far transported, and
infatuated with this spightfull ambition (their governors in the interim,
supposing they should be made petty Princes in command, amongst the more
ignorant sort of Natives) that they did not only decline violently all manner
of reasonable accords, but even were persuaded to hate with an exact spleen
and malice, all their own country men, friends and kindred, that had any
manner of correspondency, or almost the least communication with those of the
Lydian race and interest: In the Interim the Senate of Lydia, finding this
violence and distractions amongst us, resolved to put many of the strong Forts
of the Country (which from the beginning of the troubles, they had kept in
their possession) absolutely into the hands of the Myssians, the better to
avoid the expense; and inconvenience of the War in their own particulars,
having as they thought enough to do with their King in in Lydia; and the
rather for that they knew, that as Myssia was most proper, to send Soldiers of
their own Nation into the Island of Creet, whereby to contend with the
inhabitants, so was there such an inveterate spleen and hatred between the
Natives of both Countries, not only in regard of their possessions, but their
religion, that no reconciliation was at any time to be feared: besides the
Myssians with others of Lydia of their faction and interests, supposed the old
Cretans owed them a secret revenge, for having injuriously outed them of their
lands and estates, in the time of the late King Evarchus father.

These Transactions I say, filled the whole country a new with blood and
slaughters; and the more confused it proved; (and so consequently the more
horrid) in regard that for the most part, we fought dividedly upon the general
score of three interests; sometimes two against one, and then again each for
it self, as often as any opposition was found, which not seldom happened, in
regard of the many jealousies and suspicions, rising daily out of the variety
of apprehensions by reason of frequent accidents: so that in a short time,
almost in every place the Towns were fired, the people destroyed, and the
country depopulated; being no safety in any place, or scarce the least means
of subsistence out of Armies, unless it were under the walls, and protection
of some few garrisons, that secured a kind of small circuit, for necessary
provisions, to maintain themselves and the inhabitants of their jurisdiction:
but the King at last receiving from me and others intelligence of these
lamentable proceedings, in the Island of Creet (as truly in a manner it was
past all examples, since the intention of all sides, was not alone to contend
about disputable rights, occasioned by some former oppression, but even to
extirpate not only whole families, but the very remembrance of the Nation it
self, that should have the unhappiness to be overcome by the other) gave
order to me if it were possible to reconcile these bloody differences and
horrid contentions, with all the speed I could, specially amongst those of his
own party, neither was he determintd to exclude out of this number the old
Cretans themselves, however depending upon other interests, only in regard
they seemed by their declarations formerly in words, to stand for his Tide and
authority, against the proceedings of the Myssians, though publicly, they
contended violently with his Forces in the field: It Is true I cannot deny but
in some things they had reason enough for their jealousies, the King very often
being constrained, to go even from his own resolutions, to give satisfaction
to those Councels that were continually about his person; who persuaded him, he
lost the love of his people in Lydia, by seeming in any kind to favor or
countenance the Cretans in their demands, who as they pretended were enemies to
their general established religion; Of the other side the Natives were again
by much too covetous and mistrustfull not only to desire violently other men's
possessions and estates from them, but so entirely to doubt the Kings
performance of his promises, when as they knew he did but endeavor for his
better advantage, to contract privately with them in most particulars, in such
matters as appertained to the Temple of Delphos, for giving as I said too
general a distaste, to those of his own party, within the Kingdom of Lydia.
But to be short, it was not very long, before the King sent a most intimate
councellor of his own into the Island of Creet, as well to inform me
particularly of his pleasure by word of mouth, as also to Join himself with
me and others in commission for the better and speedier effecting of his
designs: presently as soon as he arrived, we sent out our summons to the
whole Country in the general, either to meet themselves, or to appoint
Deputies for each division in the Island, to attend the Kings orders and
direction upon a certain day at Pergame, not only to hear what should be
propounded in their Princes behalf, for their future peace and advantage, but
also we our selves would be ready to hear what the people would demand, to
their further satisfaction, whereby their enemies, the Myssians, might be
opposed in their intentions; who endeavored not only to beat down all Kingly
authority in the Island, but to become absolute Lords, over all the inhabitants
ancient liberties: I must tell you, whilst we expected a joyful issue of these
purposes, we understood another great Lord of Lydia, was newly arrived with
certain directions as was pretended from the King, independent to that power
was granted us, whereby as we were informed, only himself was empowered
underhand, to deal more intimately with the inhabitants concerning matters of
religion: as this something startled our expectation having no such notice from
the King, so did we resolve to send for the party upon our authority, who upon
his appearing, neither obeying our commands, nor giving us the satisfaction was
desired, we at that very instant restrained his person, until the Kings
pleasure in that particular (as we said) should be publicly known: but
whether these proceedings of ours (which however we esteemed for the best) or
that the Natives in truth were otherwise settled in their resolutions, hindered
the success, when the day came according to the appointment for this assembly
to meet, there appeared none at all of the ancient inhabitants of the Country,
so that upon some conclusion of a few things between us and the rest of the
Cretans, who were not altogether so spightfull against the Lydian customs as
the others, we for the present dissolved any further Treaty, which in a manner
is as much as I can say of our present state and affairs, until I shall be
better instructed, either by the Natives inclinations, or concerning the Kings
fortunes and success; it not being yet a month since the intended Treaty was
broake up:

Roxana as she had been very attentive to all Dedalus discourse, for that she
was extremely desirous to inform her self in what particulars she could,
concerning the passages of the Island, so when he had absolutely made an end of
what he would say, she used these words unto him, truly my Lord, said she, I
must needs confess, this seems to my imagination to be a most unfortunate
Country in the general, if not to be threatened by some desperate fate from the
heavens, to its destruction: however of the other side, it seems something
doubtful as yet to my apprehension in what things the Natives are so much to
blame according to many men's thoughts, since it is but reasonable, as the King
is to expect from them their fidelity and assistance, so they should in some
sort, be assured in their religion and possessions; especially in a conjuncture
of times when there are so many enemies of all parts that conspire their ruin;
not only in respect of the Myssians that are in open hostility against them,
but in regard also of those that attend abour Evarchus person at the Court; who
are no way inclinable as you have already intimated to favor their proceedings
or interest. Truly Madam answered Dedalus, if there were no more in it then
those generals you mention, there might be much said in their behalfes, but
being pleased to admit so far of a tedious discourse, that I may a little
take apart the particulars of their demands, I make no question but you will
easily perceive, that as they were unreasonable, to exact from the Kings
necessities such conditions, so was it unpossible for him to grant them their
desires, without endangering in a manner the whole frame of his affairs, both
in Lydia and Creet it self.

Dedalus finding, that Roxana was most willing to hear all his arguments for
her better satisfaction, he began thus to dispute: First, said he for their
propositions mentioned, not only to have a free liberty to exercise their own
Country rights, in the worship of the gods, according to the use of Delphos,
but to have most of the chief Temples, belonging to the Island delivered into
their hands, with all the rents and revenues belonging unto them, it cannot but
evidently appear to all knowing judgments, what a distraction it would soon
have made in Creet, when as in many places most of the inhabitants themselves,
are contrary in their opinions to those principles, whereupon would follow a
most desperate confusion amongst all sorts of people; when such should be of a
sudden, debarred of the usual place of their sacrificing to the gods, by
those that formerly were subject to their laws and customs; and much more
strange and distasteful it would be, to have the maintenance of all their
Priests and Flamins (being for the most part Lydians by birth) taken from them,
and they turned with their whole families into the world without any substance
at all, after so long a time of possession and settlement: besides it is very
well known, many of the Noblemen and Gentry of the Country it self, upon
whose fidelity and power the Kings present affairs depended, were actually
vested in a great part of those Titles and rents (in a manner beyond any
remembrance) either by gift or purchase: who no doubt upon such a
disadvantagable change, merely out of spleen and distaste, would have quickly
turned their endeavors and affections, to the countenancing absolutely of the
Myssians proceedings, against Evarchus their Prince: In the next place whereas
they demanded, that either no strange governors should be appointed over any
part of the Island, but merely Natives, or at leastwise such as should be
approved by the general council instituted by themselves, I pray consider but
with indifference, which I know you do, what an extraordinary (and I may say)
a most preposterous inconveniency, it would have brought upon the Kings
designs, not only by reason of those contemptible opinions, it would have
created in all men's minds concerning his actions and want of spirit, but also
have given so general a distaste to all his Subjects of best quality in both
Kingdoms, that the effects must needs have been of a most dangerous
consequence, when as the principal men of honor should be absolutely outed,
both of their present command or future expectation, to give way to the
advancement of such people, that neither knew well how to govern when they
should be employed, or the King himself could be at all certain of their
fidelity, when they were in office; as well in regard of the fantastical
inconstancies of their own natures and dispositions; as also in respect of
their several interests depending upon other Nations. And last of all, whereas
it is desired, that all those lands be again restored to the ancient Natives
of the Island, which had been at any time forfeited, for what pretended
rebellion soever, either in the reign of the father of Evarchus, or the old
Queen of Lydia, and so consequently in the possession of any Lydians or
Myssians, would have proved as dangerous an inconveniency to the Kings
affairs, as any other thing we have yet mentioned; and in truth would have
been a work (besides the general distaste) of a most stupendous labor to
have effected: not only in regard of the several intricate Titles, that must
of necessily depend upon the long continuation of them from one family to
another, by reason of alienations and bargains of diverse natures and manners,
made between man and man, but also would be a most difficult matter for the
Natives themselves, justly to distribute with an indifferent equality and
content, to each party who should make their demands, since as many would
pretend to what was none of their own, so others again being but very young
(if at all then borne) when their ancestors lost the possessions of their
estates, (the property of them being also since that time changed, either by
cutting down of woods, erecting of building, or peopling of Towns and
Villages) would be defrauded of their dues, for want of certain knowledge,
what belonged to their Parents: besides how many hundred of families, would be
turned to a most miserable begging posture? who as Tennants to their Lords, had
laid out their money of a considerable value upon purchases, either for lives
or years, and knew not where to seek other habitations with their wives and
children for their subsistence; neither truly could the Natives make any
considerable profit of the said lands, for want of people to mannure them,
since it is very well known, they in their own persons are not any way
husbandmen, or at all industrious without the Lydian assistance; wherefore
consequently, this course and alteration must bring a general devastation upon
the whole Country: but put case some would readily yield to these orders and
in junctions, by reason of quietness and possession, yet no doubt but the most
part would oppose, being by birth or extraction either Myssians or Lydians,
which of necessity would procure confusion enough, as also be a means that
Evarchus enemies, would dispossess all his friends under their jurisdiction in
like manner, wheresoever they had gained by their swords any thing over the
Kings fortunes in Lydia, Myssia, or Creet. Of the other side, if we do but
consider, the small aid and assistance, these people could have afforded their
Prince at the best, we shall find these concessions (upon the matter) would
have been wholly lost, since they undertook only, to procure him ten
thousand men to be employed in his Wars, without paying them for any
considerable time; and the gods know perhaps, they would not fully have
performed those promises; being as uncertain in their undertakings, as
unreasonable in their demands: No no, Madam, said he, these were but mere
chymeras, broached by some of their eminent commanders for their own ends, to
render themselves great and potent amongst the people, and afterward would have
made use of their power, as their ancestors did before them, to no other
purpose but to exercise Tyranny and nourish rebellion: And however, I say, that
the messenger sent from Delphos seemed to concur in these designs, yet I
will not say he erred, so much in will and intention, as out of ignorance and
want of judgment: nevertheless though he imagined only perhaps to reduce the
inhabitants to their ancient obedience to the Temple of Delphos, without
prejudicing much others rights, yet his complying so much with their rude and
barbarous customs in outward show, according to the old Natives humors; with
his publicly discountenancing all others of a more civil conversation,
notwithstanding they professed the same religion and worship of the gods, gave
not only cause of too much suspicion, concerning his designs and purposes,
but occasioned a great deal of confusion and distraction in the general as
well to the overthrow of the Kings Interest, as to the hazard of the Natives
subsistence in their own Country, in regard of the advantages their enemies
the Myssians make of their differences. But hear a messenger sent from the
Princess Cloria stopped their further discourse, who as he said desired to
speak with Roxana: so that the old woman, only thanking Dedalus for what was
past; and promising too meet him often upon the same subject, made have to know
her Mistresses pleasure:

When Roxana came into her Chamber, the Princess told her, that she had been
lately troubled with a most untoward and fearful dream, which however in her
thoughts she was not at all superstitious as she said, yet she could not
absolutely free her apprehension from the consideration of it: she imagined
her self and Narcissus to be upon the Sea together in one Vessel, when of a
sudden an extreme darkness seemed to cover the face of the water, in so much
as they could not perceive any thing at all about them, whereupon both of them
remaining frighted, with a kind of horror to see so great an unexpected change
in the weather, from a clear Sun-shine-day, to a time almost as black as
night, they might at last behold themselves encompassed round about with many
ships, belonging to the Senate of Lydia, that bid them presently yield to that
power without resistance, unless they would hazard their own destructions:
so that instantly conceiving themselves no way able to resist so peremptory a
command, their persons were presently not only seized, but separated with a
great deal of cruelty one from another, to their no small grief and
amazement, whilst in the interim also she heard some of the company say, that
as this design was put in execution, by the authority of young Philos
Philostros nephew, so was it his pleasure to have her self carried prisoner
into her fathers Kingdom of Lydia, as he was resolved to dispose of the person
of Narcissus, according to his own will and intentions in the Kingdom of
Syria: presently upon the apprehension of the dream (as she said) she
wakened, with some kind of seeming trouble more then ordinary as the people
about her had informed her her:

Roxana finding her Mistress notwithstanding her professions, to be something
discomposed, either by reason of the distempers of her sickness, or in regard
of the distraction of her apprehension, having belike before she went to
sleep, filled her imagination with some unprofitable thoughts proceeding from
the discourse of former actions or conceptions, told her, that as it was the
greatest folly in the world (if not a most supreme impiety) to put any manner
of confidence or belief in dreams unpleasant, that were engendered only in
the fancy by mere accidents, meeting with the indisposition of the body, so if
the gods at any time had a will, we should be instructed in things to come
necessary to be known, they would certainly send us for true information to
Oracles, that are not to be held fallible in any kind: of the contrary, the
motions that proceed from our selves are for the most part governed by
passions; and so consequently not to be relied upon, although sometimes I
cannot deny said she but they happen accordingly, though no otherwise then
like as a person should cast a stone over a house, and by mere fortune might
kill a bird of the other side; for though the stone had but that one place to
light in to do the thing, yet by mere fortune it might as well light there as
any where else: but however this short discourse, reasonably well quieted the
Princesses thoughts for the present; yet both she and Roxana fell upon a
resolution, with all possible speed to haste their journey toward the Island
of Cyprus; as well for that they doubted not, but to meet Narcissus to their
extraordinary content and satisfaction there; as of the other side, not
conceiving Creet to be a place of sufficient security any long time, in regard
of those many factions and disturbances in the country, depending upon several
interests, according to the relations of Dedalus the governor; for besides the
inconstant natures of the people, with the small authority the King seemed to
have by way of jurisdiction, over the very actions and affairs of his own
party (as they were informed) could they be very confident of the fidelity of
the City of Pergame, where they for the present remained; in regard the Senate
of Lydia by occasion of Trade, seemed to have a kind of hidden influence, in
the thoughts and affections of most of the inhabitants: nevertheless, although
Cloria and her governesse might have these passionate desires, of removing with
all expedition, yet neither the distempers of the Princess, or the commodity
of the Syrian Vessel that had conveyed them thither, as yet afforded them the
convenience.

But whilst their expectations from day to day waited the opportunity, Dedalus
of a sudden had intelligence, that the old Cretans having newly given the
Myssians in their Country a kind of a lesperate overthrow, esteeming
themselves thereby at more liberty to act as they pleased, were ^arching in all
have against the Walls of Per^ame, with an intention as 'twas said, to obtain
the absolute jurisdiction both of the Town and Haven: The Governor upon this,
after he had made the Princess Cloria acquainted with the news, assembled the
chief Magistrates of the City, whereby not only to take their advice, but to
demand their assistance; however all the benefit this congregation produced
toward the end he intended, was to break up the meeting in distracted
counsels instead of more settled resolutions; for he found some were for the
Senate of Lydia and the Myssians; others again declared their affections to be
most inclinable for the proceedings and Religion of the ancient Natives; though
the third sort of people however fewest in number declared for the Princess
Cloria and himself: but Dedalus finding, he could not build his determinations
upon these uncertainties, wherein both the safety of the Town and his own
honor, might probably suffer, by reason of the protraction; as also the person
of the Princess Cloria be endangered by his slownesse and neglect, he quickly
mustered up all the Soldiers of the Castle, with such others of the Kings
party in the City, that were willing to obey his command, with an intention
according to Roxana's persuasion, only to guard and defend the Walls and the
Bullwarkes of the Town from any sudden surpize of the Rebels; not
conceiving himself able to contend equally with them in the Field, by reason
of their numbers and provision: no sooner was this resolution of his publicly
made known in the general to the people, but the most part of them, began
with open mouths to exclaim against his intentions, calling him Traitor and
coward, with a thousand other words of most infamous language, pretending he
durst not issue out into the field to fight with the enemy, for fear of his
own person, though it were thereby to secure all their lives and estates: As
this mad rage in the multitude, was kindled by the Myssians faction in the
City, as doubting if it were not speedily prevented, the old Cretan Natives
might probably become masters of the place, and so by consequence they should
be hindered of their Trade and commerce with Smyrna, and other Haven Towns
belonging to the Senate of Lydia, so was Dedalus forced to issue out into the
Field, and venture a Battle with the Rebels, which he performed with so gallant
a bravery, that within few hours time he dislodged most of their Troops from
about and near the walls of Pergame: But three or four days after, thinking
to return again into the Town with both honor and authority, he was
suddenly (contrary to his expectation) violently opposed and denied entrance
at the gates of the City, the inhabitants pretending that he only seemed to
have put the enemy to flight, when he had resolved to deliver up the Town into
their hands: Dedalus in the interim being enflamed with this ungrateful
proceedings of his Country men, resolved by power and force of arms, to gain
a new entrance to his old command; and to this purpose, although his Soldiers
were not many, he began to make formal Trenches, as if he intended a long and
continued siege, whereby again to bring the people, to their wonted and
ancient obedience, to that jurisdiction he held under the King his master, as
supposing neither their strengh or skill, would long be able to contend with
his right and power: but alas, they had already too craftily prevented his
purposes, by more preventing designs; for as soon as they fell upon these
resolutions, to keep him by strong hand out of the Town, they sent privately
to those Lydian ships that lay dispersed over the Seas, with a full declaration
of their intentions, which was to render themselves obedient to the Senat's
commands; of which a considerable number was already come into the Haven, to
take possession of the City, whereby to receive the peoples offers in that
nature, with a promise also of their parts, to afford them protection both in
war and peace, against all those that should oppose: This being soon made known
to Dedalus, he had no other way, but to endeavor the best conditions he could
both for himself and the Princess, to which effect Commis-missioners of each
fide were appointed to Treat; since as he could not altogether have declined
this remedy, so with no probable hope, could he have expected the gaining of
the Town by force, in regard of those supplies which remained in the ships
newly come into the Haven, to strengthen the inhabitants endeavors and
resolutions; of the other side, being obliged to lie with all his Forces in the
Fields before the Walls of Pergame, without either supplies or provision, he
was in certain danger to be destroyed by the old Natives, who not many days
before by his valor and conduct, he had disgracefully chased from the siege.

However the Princess Cloria, when she came to the assured knowledge of these
unfortunate passages, by which her own liberty seemed again to be
circumscribed, by a new though a more inferior jurisdiction, although she
could not be but sufficiently sensible of the unhappiness of such a
subjection, yet she resolved to meet her captivity with such a majesty, as
either would bring revenge upon her person, in regard of her Fathers
contentions, or procure a respectfull compassion from her enemies, that might
defend her Dignity from all oppression: with these thoughts (as if she had
been of a sudden miraculously cured of her distempers) she called for her
Clothes, whereby the better to put her courageous determinations in execution,
when any violence to that purpose should be attempted: but Roxana upon the
instant coming in to her chamber, and finding her body not in a capacity to
answer to that resolution of her mind, not only gave her counsel to lie
still, and expect as yet the farther event of things during the Treaty, but
also entered into more necessary discourses with her, concerning what was to be
thought upon and done, in this unlucky conjuncture of affairs; although she
could not apprehend much danger would happen, either to her person or quality
by this accident: To this purpose she used this language unto her as she lay
in her bed: Madam said she, put the worst, which is to be made prisoners to
this new power, that as you see, has not only driven out Dedalus from his
command, but probably will now circumvent all our other designs, if they can
find the opportunity: they must either carry you into Lydia, or send you home
into Cyprus; if they conducted you into Lydia, they cannot certainly be so
inhumane, as to debar you from the sweet society of your most honored and
noble Father, in whose conversation you will not only be delighted, as it may
be imagined with a most supreme felicity, but also you will have the
commodity, to impart unto him your secret resolution, concerning the intended
marriage, between my Lord Narcissus and your self, which perhaps is a
convenience you would be most unwilling to miss; and in some sort requisite
before you absolutely finish those other ceremonies, which in effect as you
know, must have been performed either in person or by Deputy, to render you
fully satisfied in your thoughts; since as you may remember you made an open
profession to that purpose: besides how do you know, but that you may find
your Father in such a prosperous condition, that by the absolutely subjection
of his enemies, your mother the Queen may again be called home to her old
honors and felicities in Lydia? which would be the convenietest and best
Theater, whereon to act the happy parts of your most glorious Nuptials: of the
contrary if they should send you into Cyprus, certainly you should be in the
place according to your own wishes, since all this while you have endeavored
the expedition and success of that journey, as the last seeming period of your
desires, after all your strange and several adventures; esteeming it as a full
satisfaction from the gods, in recompense of your so many troubles and hazards:
neither let it ever enter into your thoughts, that the Senate of Lydia will in
any kind, either endanger your person or restrain your liberty; for that, as
such intentions would afford them no manner of benefit whatsoever, in their
contentions with the King your Father (since there are already many of the
royal Issue out of their power and possession) so would it not only cause a
more general hate upon their actions throughout all Asia, but highly
exasperate your Uncle Orsames against their proceedings; to the endangering
certainly, of a new War between Syria and Lydia, which no doubt but the
Senate will endeavor to prevent, by all means possible they can invent.

Yet however Roxana might be of these opinions, or that she only used such
discourses, the better to encourage the Princess, nevertheless i^ was not
many days before the Senates Sea Forces declared their intentions; which was
absolutely to conduct Cloria into Lydia, restrained in her person, until (as
they said) the farther pleasure of the Senate, should be known concerning her
particular; withal pretending they had a peremptory commission to execute
according to this purpose; proceeding belike from the untoward endeavor of
that Ambassador at Memphis, that had been employed by Philos, to distroy the
Loves between Cloria and Narcissus: As for Dedalus, all the conditions he could
procure for himself, was, upon their undertaking to pay him thirty Talents for
the discharge of his Soldiers; and the defraying of his necessary expenses,
presently to lay down Arms and quit the Island of Creat^; though if he
pleased being so agreed between them, he might visit the Kingdom of Lydia,
until such time he should more commodiously prepare his occasions, for his
absolute transportation into foreign parts.

It Is true Roxana cast about many ways in her working thoughts, how yet to
alter or prevent these determinations of carrying the Princess Cloria into
Lydia a prisoner: first she fancies to steal out of the Town, to those
Forces which Dedalus had in a body entire without the Walls; and
notwithstanding the agreement to animate their spirits to stand for the Kings
right and the Princess safety: but finding they both needed necessary
provisions, and were in danger in their persons hourly to be cut off by the
old Cretans, that lay every where dispersed over the whole Country; who hated
them as they knew equal with the Myssians, she thought that would be a
project of no great consequence to their benefit; then again she imagined,
that perchance they might use some stratagem, to be conveyed privately out of
the Haven, by some hired ship to that purpose; and by that means concealedly
get into the Island of Cyprus, according to their former intentions: however
when she remembered she was told, that the officers of the Senates forces, had
lately not only taken a strict account of all the Vessels that remained in the
Harbor, but had also put in new Commanders of their own in every ship, she
supposed with no probability what, soever, could they attempt such a design
without being revealed; and then they might come to be worse used in their
confinement. Whereas now the Princess was promised all honor, favor, and
respect according to her Dignity in the journey.

And lastly she conceited, that perchance they might find not only reception
but protection in the Armies of the ancient Natives: but when she confidered
the inconstancy of their dispositions, the rudeness of their customs, with
their several particular interests, she thought it a vanity, if not a madness
to put in execution any such design, and the rather for that the Princess
Cloria her self, was not yet so perfectly recovered of her health, that she
could possibly expose her person to those uncertainties, both in travel, and
diet, with other inconveniences, that she would necessarily be obliged to
suffer amongst those unpollisht Troops: wherefore the old woman being in her
opinion convinced in all these particulars, she persuaded her Mistress, with
a kind of a majesty mixed with affability and kindness, to entertain both her
fortunes, and those Commanders that should be designed to conduct her under the
jurisdiction of the Senate, since as yet they could not by any means leame
what probably might be resolved of, concerning the farther disposure of their
persons, upon their arrival in the Kingdom of Lydia.

It was not many days when the Princess Cloria had declared her self, both
fit and willing, to undertake a journey, that the Admiral at Sea, who had been
sent out by the direction of the Ambassador, that remained as was formerly
related at Memphis, conducted the sweet Princess with her governesse into his
own ship, where be had prepared a magnificent Cabin for her reception; but
whether so adorned out of any intention thereby the better to win her belief,
or out of the humanity of his own nature I cannot tell: yet so it was, in that
unwelcome Triumph, that both the Fleet and the Seas themselves received them
with a prosperous Wind, which in two days and a night or thereabouts, landed
them in the fair and ancient Haven of Smyrna. where they reposed not much
longer, before they were conveyed by many gallant Troops of horse (by the
Senates directions) to a brave Castle of the Kings, seated upon a hill not very
far off the great City of Sardis, where they had not only time enough to rest,
but to exercise abundantly their own thoughts, since as they knew they were
confined, so were they in a manner out of hope to know for how long.

Some weeks after the said Princess, and her affectionate Governesse, had
remained imprisoned in the Castle, which the Senate had ordered for their
confinement, spending their time for the most part in fruitless complaints,
accompanied with more Tears, of a sudden Roxana one day as she was sitting in
a low Parlor, that opened a Balcona-window into the park, where many tame
Dear grazed, that all the winter were accustomed to be fed by the hand, for
the pleasure formerly of the King, who upon his retirement from troublesome
affairs, would repaine thither for the better privacy of recreation, was
salluted by a young gentleman, of more then ordinary beauty and comeliness of
person, who after he had with a certain winning behavior made up between
confidence and humility, bestowed some complements upon her, he uttered this
language: Madam said he, not finding the excellent Princess Cloria so apt and
capable for my discourse at present, as I wish she were, in regard of those
desparing sorrwes, that seem to cloud so many admirable perfections, that were
wont to give new lustres to the world, and may again notwithstanding these
ominous interpositions, that seem to be governed, not only by a cruel but a
most presumptuous and unmannerly fate, if she can but be wrought to such a
confidence and belife of my intentions, concerning her servioe, as is not only
convenient but most necessary for the season: for however the office I now seem
to hold under the Senats jurisdiction, is cause I must confess of suspicion
enough, to the most strongest persuasions, yet I call all the gods to witness,
who best know my heart, that I harbor never a thought inwardly that does not
entirely wish a most supreme happiness to every action, that Evarchus can
think may again bring him to the uttermost height, of all his ancient honors
and Dignities, though the circumstances and reasons of my affections, in regard
of my present condition, are so many and various at this time to be disputed:
but if this belief of my loyalty, shall take that place with your charity, as
I humbly desire it may, I shall then discover unto you such passages, lately
come to my knowledge, that will not only probably secure the Princess from a
storm coming upon her, which perhaps she would most willingly avoid, but
also put her in a way of so absolute a happiness, that I dare be bold to say,
neither her hopes nor yours can yet arrive unto.

Roxana however she knew not (notwithstanding all his violent professions) how
to be over confident of his intentions, yet in regard both of the necessity of
their condition, as also having some kind of reasons given her, by the
earnestness of his language, and the ingenuity of his countenance, to be
something pliable to his discourse, she thought it at leastwise the safest way,
to comply with his offer without any seeming jealousy, whatsoever: And to this
purpose, after she had abundantly thanked him for his extraordinary courtesy,
she told him, both her Ladies obligations and her own, would be exceedingly
augmented, by any information he should give of the Senats intentions, since as
yet they could find nothing but effects of their cruelty; And much more if by
his assistance, they might wind themselves out of their present troubles and
future dangers.

Then Lady said he, as the story I have to tell, concerns Prince Cassianus
fortunes, since his departure out of Lydia, wherein the Princess Cloria is
involved, so must I desire your leave to prosecute all those circumstances that
belong to the re^ation, however perhaps they may not be altogether judged so
necessary to the matter, by your discerning judgment, yet in regard the
passages cannot be but something delightful to your fancy, I shall make bold
to presume upon your patience, since truly they are both admirable and almost
past all belief:

Know then, that Cassianus at his being at the Court of Lydia, though his
business in outward view seemed to pretend to nothing, but the procuring
assistance from the King, to regaine his lost Country of Iberia, yet secretly
I must tell you, he fell in love with the Princess Cloria, which however he
durst not discover: In this posture he continued between hope and despair,
until the arrival of the old Queen Anaxia, as he believed drowned all his
encouragements, in a vast Sea of impossibility, for that she brought with her
in her journey, certain propositions full of honor and benefit to Evarchus
Court, from the King of Egypt, concerning a marriage between the fair
Princess and his Son and Heir Osiris, which caused Cassianus that night, when
all the world was employed about the triumphant sports, that were designed for
the entertainment of the Queen of Syria, to leave Lydia: belike being put on to
those resolutions, by his melancholy apprehensions, which however as you very
well know so enflamed the whole Kingdom, by the spightfull practices of
factious Dimogoras joined with the crafty insinuations of others of the same
interest; that it proved a maine occasion that since has disquieted the King
in his government.

But Cassianus himself who had left Lydia ingendring certain black clouds of
malignant vapors, that afterward became furious storms of blood and
slaughter (though I cannot say he was any way guilty in their effects; for
Princes Titles and interests are oftentimes abused to sinister ends and
purposes) retired in person, under the jurisdiction of an ancient Forest, not
many days journey from the Court, where sometimes he privately lived,
delighting his solitary intentions, with the exercise of hunting, and other
rural delights, which those pleasant woods, and that fruitful Country
plentifully afforded his nature and fortune: but not long it was before
Hyacinthia our Queen also, by reason of the inflammations of Lydia, was forced
to quit her Husbands Kingdom by which accident as you know she met in that
place, with the company of her banished brother Candalus, outed in like manner
of all his happiness, by the powerful authority of Philostros great favorite
to Orsames.

As most of these passages were within the compass of your own intelligence,
which I have related only for my stories better method, so now I shall presume
to inform you of such particulars, as you have not yet heard of; for Cassianus
remaining as I said in the delightful Forest, and going under the borrowed
and abbreviated name of Cassa, being disguised in the habit of a young
huntsman, upon the Queens arrival, presented himself to your view though not
to your knowledge: by which encounter, he was encouraged, again to prosecute
his old love (almost laid asleep by time and separation, to the Princess
Cloria since the convenience (as he thought) could not be bettered; and in that
manner resolved to wait upon the Queen undiscovered into Syria: Nevertheless
in that intended voyage as you know, both himself and Eumenes suffered
shipwreck; however Cassianus (though the other perished) by the
prospitiousnesse of the heavens, escaped in a manner miraculously the desperate
danger of the Sea, and entered into such adventures as scarce can be paralleld:
for his body being supported, upon a flat chest full of Jewels belonging to
himself, by the only flowing of the water, was carried into certain Nets
belonging to poor fishermen, who finding a young man full of beauty, though
almost dead by the violent agitation of the waves, after they had recovered
some life in him, presented him to a Lords daughter of the Country called
Brisania, as a subject worth her best compassion; but the Lady whether taken
with the youth and beauty of her patient, or having an inclination to affect
that she had once preserved, of a sudden fell in love with his lovely person,
since she had no motives to be enticed by the knowledge of his Titles, he
having concealed himself, the better to perform his intended journey into
Syria: and this love at last from small sparcles, began to increase to a great
flame, though for a long time Cassianus was not informed of the Ladies
passions; for her virgin modesty ever suppressed the declaration of that which
she had much ado to hide, until the secret fire was discovered by the sharp
sight of another Suitor, that had already procured the good will of her Father
for their future marriage; notwithstanding another Rival by a more noble love
contended with the former for prehemin^nce: In the interim that these intricate
affections seemed to act several parts, the old Lord by his unexpected death,
left his fair daughter to inherit rather misfortune, then jurisdiction; For
Fridius her hated Lover (being so called) presently seized both upon her Person
and Country, pretending that her Father in his last will, had instituted him
the sole governor of her Minority, least she might endanger both her honor
and safety by some inconsiderable match; resolving withal to make Cassianus a
Sacrifice or a Petitioner to compass his ends: to which purpose, he caused him
publicly to be accused, that he intended to have betrayed the Town and
Conutrey to a foreign power; under pretense of freeing Brisania from prison,
who seemed also to have consented to the practice, whereby to have procured her
own releasement. And this being falsely laid to his charge he was unjustly
condemned; however Fridius suspended the execution until he had not only
again attempted the Ladies consent to his offered Love, but procured
Cassianus, who went by the borrowed name of Cassa, to be himself a Solicitor
in his suit; which opportunely gave Brisania occasion, instead of granting
Fridius his request, to discover her own love; but Cassianus became rather
confused then pleased at this discovery, since the hazard of his own life could
but purchase the acceptance; in so much as only with a sorrowful courtship he
entertained her discourse, however she gave him leave to depart, and carry her
peremptory denial to the proud Tyrant. Nevertheless poor Cassa was to be
made the object of his spleen, since Brisania would not be the subject of his
love; for some few days after he was brought to a public scaffold erected
before the Castle window, where Brisania remained, that she might be the better
witness of the bloody Tragedy intended; Cassa appeared in a mourning habit,
becoming the sadness of his present condition, but much more clouded in his
sorrowful countenance, that showed his dejected mind; though his beauty had
yet so large a possession in his person by the opinion of the people, that he
seemed a Sun shaded in a dark sky, that notwithstanding shot forth bright
beams under the black coverture; And in this manner was lead to the Theater
of death in the view of the people, who accompanied him all the way with their
liberal lamentation, since these were the only sacrifices they could offer in
his behalf; for although he was esteemed amongst them but a private Gentleman
of Iberia, yet could they not choose but grieve to see a Youth of his natural
perfections, untimely brought to his destruction, by the cruelty of a wicked
Tyrant: But in the mean time poor Brisania summoned to the spectacle by the
noise of the spectators, at the first sight began to feel new passions in her
gentle bosom, not so much of love as pity, since the prisoner himself had by
diverse messages solicited her to yield, rather then to make him the only
object of Fridius his hate: wherefore, first she laid before her thoughts the
innocence of the prisoner that was to suffer, only because she continued
wilful. Then she began to think there was nothing but her own miserable
captivity could redeem his life, religion, charity and affection pleaded of one
side, as hatred, honor, and courage contended of the other, which made her
sometimes resolve to break through the crowde, and fling her self at Fridius
his feet to beg his pardon: But then her spirit again disdaining such a
submission, rather choosing to cast her person amongst the people, and by her
own death incite their revenge, Whilst these confiderations tormented her
gentle soul, and that his approaching execution seemed to exact from her
consent a speedy resolution, at the further end of the Market place appeared a
confused fear amongst the common people, which was quickly seconded, not only
with cries of Treason, but with the noise of many warlike instruments, tending
to the surprise of the Town, so that the scaffold that was ordained to be the
stage where Cassa was to act his last part, became soon emptied of all those
unwelcome assistances, and he lest only to be his own prisoner; an accident
certainly that sufficiently pleased him, although his amazed joy had scarce
belief enough to apprehend he was freed, which made him longer continue that
posture the executioner had put him in, then his good fortune required at his
hands, so that he moved not until one of the Soldiers wished him to pray for
the life of Saxanius who had delivered him from death. By which declaration it
was quickly known throughout all the Marketplace, that Brisanias first Suitor
had both saved Cassa from destruction, and possessed himself of the City, who
hearing of the cruel captivity of his dear Mistress by the wicked tyranny of
Fridius, had assembled all his friends to her rescue, and by a neat stratagem,
had happily brought about the design for her delivery, and her enemies
punishment: Fridius sufficiently apprehensive of the guilt of his own Treason,
staid not to dispute the right of his cause with his victorious rival, but
presently retired under the safe protection of the strong Castle, where he
supposed was a Garrison able to contend, whilst other succors cam^^^ his
assistance; besides he had Brisania in his power, by whose authority and Title
he imagined the better to retain the obedience of the People. But Saxanius
intending neither to be slothful in his love or hate, after he had given some
orders for the surer obedience of the Town, soon placed a formal siege before
the Fort where his Mistress was imprisoned, with so great a probability of
prevailing that within some few days he received a Message from wicked
Fridius, that if he did not presently retire himself and his Troops from
before the Castle, he vowed by all the gods that Brisania should act the first
part in that Tragedy was intended: And for the greater assurance of his
intention, he caused the Lady to be brought upon the Leads, where were already
prepared the circumstances of her death.

Saxanius after he had understood this peremptory demand from the proud Tyrant,
and beheld with his sorrowful eyes the threatened danger of his fair
Mistress, for whose safety he had engaged not only his own courage, but the
valors also of all his friends and kindred, became tormented with many
thoughts, and diverse resolutions, since if he absolutely performed the
commanding request of his hated rival, he was no more secured (as he supposed)
of Brisania's preservation, then if he should yield to nothing he desired, but
rather gave Fridius the more liberty to be cruel, when he had no occasion to
fear; And for any promise he could make, it was to be esteemed like the rest
of his false actions: wherefore he almost determined to send away the Harralde
with a threatening denial, instead of a submissive consent. But then reflecting
upon the apprehensions of his dear love, who as he believed, would imagine
that he esteemed much more a little honor then the saving of her life, it
destroyed his former half resolution, and entered him again into new and
confused considerations, which were lost in his desperate breast with diversity
of passions, until casting his sad eyes toward the place where Brisania was,
as a pure sacrifice to be offered according to his imagination, who seemed in
his apprehension already to accuse him of unworthy love, that could so long
dispute in his mind her preservation; of a sudden he might see one cast
headlong from the top of the Castle into the ditch; which too soon persuaded
his belief that the wicked Tyrant had prevented his judgment, by performing
the execution before the return of his messenger: so that he remained like one
that seemed to be changed into a marble Statue, until a flagge of Truce
appeared joyfully upon the Castle, as a testimony of future friendship: however
Saxanius could not be satisfied in the Omen, until a Messenger from the Fort
assured him not only of the Ladies safety, but also of the death of Fridius;
with this relation, that the Soldiers of the Fort, neither being able to
endure their Princess captivity, nor the Tyrants cruelty, had by force rescued
their Mistress, and committed a supreme Justice upon his person; who now was
sent from Brisania to know what conditions the besiegers expected both for her
liberty and the Town they had already conquered. But Saxanius would make no
Articles at all with his Love, for after he had disposed of his Troops into
several Quarters, he went to present himself a slave to the fair Captive he
had redeemed, where he intended to chain his freedom for ever. However
Cassianus finding that he was not only fallen into some disdain by reason of
those desires he expressed for his own preservation, as also Saxanius likely to
take possession of those favors he might have enjoyed, imagined there was no
way to preserve him still in the good will of his Lady, but to discover his
quality, which he supposed would both advance his esteem, and lessen his
rivals credit; and by that means become a public pretender to Brisania;
which notwithstanding produced no other effects then a challenge from Saxanius,
which Cassianus in honor could not refuse, after he had given sufficient
testimonies of his condition to be a Prince and no wandering stranger. Yet
however the day was appointed for the combat, and every ones expectation
attended the final event of the quarrel, Brisania's nurse called Rhena
promised to satisfy all parties without danger or blood, provided her
Mistress would be directed by her Counsels, and become wife to him whom the
heavens had ordained to be her husband.

This strange intricacy gave curious desires to multitudes of people to be
present at the wonder, since both the Champions were resolved not to be foiled
in their honor, scarce in their loves; Wherefore they came into the Field
armed, to supply the defect of the old woman's performance, according to her
bold promise: but when they were prepared to have ended the difference by a
bloody encounter. Rhena entreated them they would first repair to the great
Temple to sacrifice to the immortal gods, where she said, she might perhaps
relate such a story, that would satisfy all their desires. This proposition
from the old woman, although it carried not with it much probability of
according the rivalls, their quarrel being grounded upon a difference that
knew not how to admit of any competition, when gratitude it self seemed to
have no place in Cassianus disposition, though he enjoyed his life by the
fortunate favor of Saxanius; yet by the importunate cries of the people who
began to be less curious and more pitiful, they were persuaded to follow her
directions; and being before the Altar encompassed round about by the expecting
multitude, Rhena after she had called the heavens to witness of the truth of
what she intended to utter, delivered this relation, which as she said, she had
bound her self by a vow never to declare, until some necessity not to be
avoided forced from her the discovery.

When beauteous Elizana said she, the virtuous mother of Prince Cassianus here
present, was constrained with her dear Husband, to fly from the Country of
Mesopotamia by the prevailing power of Artaxes general, in the way being great
with child, she was forced to retire to the house of my late Lord, Father to
Brisania, whose wife was her near kinswoman, and at the same time great also,
where she had not remained many days before she was delivered of a fair
daughter, as my Lady not long after of another, to the joy of the whole house:
however, the gods esteeming my Mistress too good for this life, took her out
of this world before she had finished the month of her childbirth, to the
unspeakable sadness both of her husband, and all her servants, leaving no
issue to inherit her singular virtues but a daughter only. Elizana also being
quickly called away by her own troubles, left her little infant unto my
education, as my Lord also trusted me with his jewel: but accidents and the
wars in Armenia growing every day more hot then other, for the better
security and quiet, I was persuaded with the two children, to retire to my own
house, where we remained for some years, they contented to be each others
companion, as I happy to be both their Foster mother, since they increased not
so fast in days and nights as in beauty and goodness; but alas the Fates
were envious at our felicity, and took one of them out of the world, and with
these words, the old woman wept with the remembrance of her dear loss, until
her many Tears running down her aged cheeks gave some interruption to her
discourse: but finding her grief was scarce seasonable to the passionate
multitude, she wiped her eyes, and then proceeded: When the violence of the
war said she became so qualified, that Parents had some leisure to enjoy the
comfort of their children, I presented my Lord with a beautiful daughter;
though for the other I had in charge, I desired his favor to make my excuse,
since it was not in my power to prevent the will of the gods, which gave him so
much satisfaction, that he persuaded Elizana by letter to be content that had
many more, which continued until my Lady Brisania by his late death as you
know became heir to all his possessions, though interrupted some time by
wicked Fridius, and redeemed by valiant Saxanius, to whom without a great deal
of ingratitude she cannot but give her self, and all that she has, since she
has received it from his hands. At which words Cassianus began to muster up
within his breast a multitude of passions, until the old woman turning toward
him told him, that presently she would render him satisfied also: wherefore,
after the people were a little quieted in their confused murmur, she thus ended
her story: But now said she to unriddle this mystery, and fully to perform my
promise, I must let know, that Brisania wat not child to your late deceased
Governor, but daughter to worthy Elizana; I only using that fallacy upon the
death of the other, because I feared the loss to my Lord would have proved a
vexation intolerable, since he wanted children to inherit his fortune and
honor; and for Elizana, I supposed the cross would not appear so great, in
respect of the bountifulness of the issue which the gods had bestowed upon
her; however I made a private vow to my self as I said, never to discover this
mystery, until some pressing occasion forced from me the declaration, as well
to retain Brisania in her supposed Fathers possessions, as to take from their
Parents all jealousy of my fraud. But since the heaven by the power and right
of conquest, have now established my Lord Saxanius in that government which
Brisania did intend innocently to usurp, and that his noble prententions to
her love deserve her best entertainment, as if the Gods intended a perpetual
unity in their hearts against all obstacles, I hope it will be the opinion of
all here present, that the marriage between them be solemnized instantly in the
Temple; and the rather for that I cannot doubt Prince Cassianus will forbid the
conjunction, since nature denies him the capacity of such a happiness. This
declaration was quickly warranted by the desires of all the people with loud
acclamations, so that Brisania turning about to Saxanius with a blush that more
enflamed his joy, after a little pawse saluted him with this language: My Lord
said she, for so it should seem the destinies have designed you against all
difficulties, though whether I shall be now esteemed worthy in your virtuous
thoughts to give you that Title may be some question, since your noble
addresses formerly received not those ready entertainements they merited:
however, I shall endeavor to persuade you to believe that the heavens have had
a secret influence whereby the better to unite our selves, since my
preposterous affection to my Brother upon small grounds endeavored something
to obscure your perfections in my apprehension, which now appear to my
knowledge in a most full and affectionate prospect, that absolutely delights
all my senses. And with that, as if she had been too liberal in her language,
like a Rose over-prest with the nights dew, by little and little cast down her
lovely looks upon the ground. Saxanius instead of delivering his judgment
concerning Brisania's plea, put in execution his intended decree by a gentle
kiss upon her fair lips, which gave the people sufficient intelligence of his
thoughts, so that the marriage became presently solemnized, to the content of
all the standers by, but more specially to themselves, whose happiness could
not fully be apprehended but in the fruition only. And this Madam, I say, is
the delightful, though intricate story of Cassianus adventures, since his
departure out of Lydia, which he was pleased to signify in waiting under his
own hand; however to none but to his faithful friend and chiefest counselor
Dimogoras.

But now that I have entertained your ears with these strange though pleasant
passages; as I may say, seemingly rather miracles, then accidents, I shall come
nearer a great deal to your concernments: This intelligence of the safety of
the Prince, you must know, enflamed the thoughts of Dimogoras; whereupon he
began to consider if a marriage could be compassed, between Cloria the Kings
daughter and Casstanus, it would undoubtedly, not only strengthen his own
greatness, but exceedingly fortify all manner of contentions of the Senate,
with Euarchus the King, since by this means his daughter should not be matched
to any foreign Prince, that might give her father assistance; but rather by
degrees would be wrought to be an enemy to his pretentions and desires.

With these considerations he went presently to the Senate, whereby to make
them acquainted with the intelligence he had received. To this purpose, being
sat in the Council, he uttered this kind of speech, with as much eloquence as
his natural roughness, and want of education could deliver.

My Lords, said he, as it is most evident, the gods have hitherunto prospered
our attempts in a most admirable manner, to the wonder of all Asia, so of the
other side may we again behold, a kind of miraculous influence depending upon
those accidents, signified unto you by Prince Cassianus Letters: These things
being considered, I see no reason, nay I may boldly affirm there is a great
deal of piety in the resolution, both belonging to the service of the gods, as
also toward the establishing of our own affairs, to endeavor all ways
possible, to unite the persons and affections, of Cloria the Kings daughter,
and Cassianus the adventurous Prince, in such indissolvable ties of love and
marriage, that may not only render them happy themselves, but secure us from
all fear of a foreign conjunction, that undoubtedly would disorder (if not
destroy) that work we have already wisely begun, and hope shall fortunately end
in this Kingdom. For my part, I must confess, I do almost tremble yet, when
I consider in how great a hazard our affairs stood, before your Admiral
surprised the Princess at Pergame; for that the alliance intended between
herself and Narcissus, could not have been other than ominous; when as of the
other side, we are most assured, to sinde Cassianus upon all occasions, not
only a^furtherer of our designs, but a lover of our persons. Perhaps you may
be a little startled with the doubts, that Cloria will scarce be brought to
think of such Nuptials; but truly these are meely frivolous considerations, in
comparison of benefits of States, and Kingdoms; wherefore I say, If she cannot
be persuaded to yield her consent, by the influence of his Courtship, she must
be compelled by your power and authority. So that my opinion is, that Cassianus
be presently sent for, not only to put in execution, with all expedition, what
we shall determine for our own happiness, and the Kingdoms welfare; but also
to be honored and maintained by our loves and affections, according to our
former resolution and promises. Let it suffice there seems already a sympathy
in their years, beauty, and religion; and what wauts of Titles and possessions,
our authorities wust make up, to be supplied according to accidents and
occasions; for that in point of honor, as I intimated before, we are obliged
by many promises, not only to settle this injured Prince, again in his lost
dominions, but to render him as happy as we can by our endeavors.

This oration being delivered with more violence then rhetoric, he sat down in
his place expecting the issue: which produced not only several discourses,
but much seeming contention, in regard of diverse and sundry interests: yet
Dimogoras, with others of the same faction, so far prevailed at last, that it
was absolutely decreed that Cassianus should with all expedition be sent for,
with an assurance of the intended match between him and the Princess Cloria.

When Creses had made an end of thus much of his discourse, he refted silent,
as it were expecting some kind of reply from Roxana: but finding the old woman
at leastwise troubled, if not something confounded at the relation, he began
anew with her in this manner:

Truly, said he, it were a kind of disservice, only to mention dangers to
torment your apprehension; and not at the same time to-propund remedies that
might probably cure the disease; which would turn all my professed courtesies
into nothing but causes of jealousy and suspicion: Wherefore Madam, as the
time that will be given, for the solicitations of Cassianus cannot be long; his
arrival being expected every hour, many weeks being past since he was sent
for to Sardis: so must you speedily resolve upon the prevention, unless you
are willing to comply with the Senates intentions. In short, be your thoughts
and resolutions what they will, I make bold to assure you, if you dare but give
sufficient confidence to my promises; or doubt not my capacity to perform them,
to deliver the Pincesse Cloria and your self free from your present
imprisonment; which being effected, you may retire under the protection of
Euarchus the King at Philadelphia; yet I must leave the particulars to further
discourses, when I may be assured of your resolutions: but if neither my
design, or faith please you; for that perchance I seem to be at present, what
notwithstanding I intend not to be many days, I must conjure you not to
discover these motions to any, but to your Lady; which is a justice I hope your
honor and goodness cannot deny me.

It was a question whether this story and offer did more amaze or content
Roxana, since as she did not expect the one, so she could not hope for the
other: notwithstanding with few circumstances, and a great deal of thanks, she
entertained his motion, confirmed with her strong protestations of all their
gratitudes to that service he should perform; which was enough to part them at
present, by reason of the passion the old woman had to inform the Princess.

Roxana, although she acquainted her Mistress with these pleasing
propositions, (who apprehended them sent by the gods for their good) yet she
resolved in her thoughts to enquire after the party and his interest, by which
she intended to lay the ground of those Councels she would use. To this
purpose, after some few days she became informed, that he was a young Nobleman
of Lyria, called Creses, employed by the Senate in the government of the
Country about the Castle, which made her also observe his actions, whereby she
might learn, whether it were a new instructed duty that taught him better
obedience to the Kings service then formerly; or whether some discontent of his
other Lords proceedings at Sardis, in regard of his own person, caused him
revengefully to put off his trust. But as within the compass of some weeks she
was satisfied it was neither of these reasons that gave him an appetite to
leave his command, and begin a new loyalty to his King; so of the other side
she became assured in her opinion, that his secret love to the Princess Cloria
was the principal cause that made him offer so acceptable a service, to the
hazard of his own life; and with this knowledge fell into many considerations
with her Mistress, whether it were better with security of their persons,
still to remain in the Castle, where they were under the jurisdiction of the
Senate, and to expect the vexations of Cassianus importunity upon his arrival,
as Creses had informed them, or hazard themselves under the protection of the
new lover, whose disposition and intention they were not acquainted withal;
nevertheless, after long debate they fell upon the latter, which was rather
absolutely to trust his passion, then expect the Senates goodness; And to that
purpose Roxana told Creses in the Princesses name, that she was resolved wholly
not only to rely upon his fidelity, but to be directed in her journey to her
Father by his care; which gave Creses a world of content, not alone that he was
thought worthy of so great a considence, but by this means he should free his
apprehension from the danger of Gassianus courship; so that within a weeks
space he provided all things necessary for their escape: whilst in the mean
time Cloria pretended a sickness that caused her to keep her chamber, whereby
no suspicion of her flight, might remain for some days after her departure,
as Creses did of important business, which called him to a necessary
attendance at Sardis:

When the designed night came that they were to begin their journey which was
expected with some impatience, the Princess Roxana, and their entrusted
dwarf, the only attendants they would use for fear of discovery, repaired to
a place at the foot of the Castle hill, where one Sentinel being more curious
then the rest, would have interrupted their passage, but their ready knowledge
of the word, gave him a quick discharge, and so consequently set them free to
take their Horses, that were provided not far off by Creses care, who was
there also attending himself to mount the Princess and the other company: But
scarce had the cheerful morning appeared in the East, after a redious nights
travel in rough and unbeaten ways, when they arrived at an even plain, that
not only afforded them some consolation to sweeten their past inconvenience,
but gave opportunity to Creses, reflecting upon his own trust, and enflamed by
his secret love to use this language to the Princess.

Madam, said he, as I envy not the Gods happiness in the conversation I have
power to enjoy, so the trust that is committed to my care, deserves a diligence
beyond expression, wherein if I had a thousand lives they were all too few to
be employed in such a service; yet give me leave to say without profanation of
your sacred self, that love is the only price that ought to purchase your
person by an honorable pity, which cannot be wanting where there are so many
other admirable perfections; for since none can merit your virtues, your
goodness will appear in the greatest luster, when it shall be seen you
choose, because you intend absolutely to oblige, like the heavens that take most
pleasure in forgiving highest offenses. It may perhaps be esteemed by ignorant
apprehensions, a kind of an equality in worth, when Titles are united, but you
know that dark foyles are used to illustrate bright Diamonds, wherefore let
not honors be the object of your looks; which however, although they cannot
outshine yours, yet certainly the clearness of your beauty will best appear
when others are removed, like the fair Moon when the Sun is most obscured
that offends by his too much violence; Flowers seem more delighfull in
innocent fields, then in stately Gardens; and crystal streams are
plentifuller replenished with variety of watery inhabitants, when the green
meadows give them bounds, rather then where Marble structures enrich their
aboade; then kissing her hand with a passionate earnestness, he bathed her
white glove with a few of his own Tears, that quickly gave Cloria Items of
his intentions; but she would take no notice of his discourse being unwilling
to disquiet her protection, since she could not condescend to his desire, so
that she was constrained prettily to divert the occasion by calling her
Governesse to the communication, pretending that else her rigid gravity might
chide them both for their dis-respect; when Roxana was arrived at a nearer
distance, the Princess perceiving her to be much troubled, if not altogether
tired with the past nights travel, by her often removing her self upon her
Saddle, not being accustomed to many such exercises, after she had bid her be
of good cheer, began to question with her concerning the practice and
employment of her youth; and whether or no women in those days did use to ride
a hunting according to the fashions now of Lydia? faith no Madam said Roxana,
in those times maids were more modestly bred then to exercise such hoyting
recreations; for if their mothers suffered them to walk a turn or two in the
garden, after they had performed a good days work upon their Samplers, and of
holy days to go eat a mess of Cream in some honest neighbors house, it
was esteemed a large liberty; besides there was a careful provision by their
parents, that no men of any son should accompany them; although they were such
as pretended to be Suitors, and the conditions of marriage already agreed upon;
but now by my truly there is nothing but private courtship, and public love
with continual divertizements, from one pleasure to another; so that young
girls endeavor nothing more, then to become bold and scandalous: nay I can
assure you Princess said she, a Maid durst not so much as smile before her
Father and Mother, scarce looking upon their woers before they were married; in
which bashful posture on the night of their Nuptials, they entertained their
husbands with tears only.

This discourse or rather passion of the old woman, proceeding as 'twas
supposed from the hard going of her horse, gave Cloria occasion to tell her in
a gentle smile, that the reason why they did not practice such pastimes, was
because they wanted good horses for the sport, and Coaches at she had heard
were not then in use: good horses said Roxana, I cannot tell what you call
good, but for my part I was never worse carried then at the present; at which
the Princess began to laugh outright, since she had so directly hit upon the
disease of her Governesse. However Creses that he might prevent all quarrels
told her, that since she found hers not easy, she should ride on his, which
perhaps would better please her, although he protested he had no design but to
accommodate her before himself; whereupon taking her down from her saddle, in
a quarter of an hours time made the exchange, though the labor seemed
fruitless; for the old woman being no whit amended in the choice, showed the
defect proceeded from her age, and not from her Steed: Nevertheless, most
courageously (though she did sweat for the business) she arrived at the
Forest, where they intended to repose themselves for the noone season, that
required some shade against the Suns violence; Creses chose a flourishing Tree
for the Princess accommodation, which contented her thoughts as well as the
richest Canopy of State in her fathers Court, and the provision that the dwarf
had brought with him abundantly satisfied instead of other curiosities: these
satisfactions exacted from Cloria another necessary duty, that the night past
had absolutely deba^red her of, which was showed by the gentle closing of her
fair eyes from the days light; whilst in the mean time Roxana had
convenience, after she had put something under her Ladies head, to retire her
self under another tree to be indulgent also to her own senses.

But Creses whose love and care caused him to be a diligent Sentinel over the
Princesses rest, afforded him also the happiness of this contemplation, in
which feign he would have stolen a kiss, but that he feared the heavens would
have revealed the theft: can the gods (thought he) be altogether stupid to
suffer so divine a creature upon earth, and leave their own habitation barren
of such excellence, since more then a thousand Cupids are ready to offer
sacrifices upon the pure Altar of her fair forehead, perfumed by the incense
of her odoriferous breath? can these two illustrious cherries said he, that
only kiss one another, because they cannot meet with the like perfections, be
less powerful then to invite Jove from Olympus to taste of the dainties; but
beholding a presumptuous fly boldly to entertain it self in the delicious
garden of her face, where mixed Roses and Lillies gave it both nourishment and
delight, notwithstanding the many gentle prohibitions of her white hand, he
began passionately to exclame against the rudeness of the creature; yet when
he saw its black color and curious shape served instead of a foil to become
her beauty, as if put there rather by art then nature, he not only let the
filly beast alone, but commended his industry; however finding her sleeping
importunity, desired something earnestly to be rid of that troublesome
ornament, he could do no less then contribute his assistance, and hastily
endeavored to chase the fly from that paradise, where it wanted neither
flowers nor exercise; at which the Princess suddenly wakened with a demand
what had disturbed her in her rest: But poor Creses durst not own the
disquiet, and so she fell asleep again, in which innocent calm she remained
until Roxana's confident authority made her know, it was time to prepare for
the afternoons journey; and this injunction was sufficient to render her
obedient against the inticements of her wearied senses.

Many days they had not traveled in this large Forest, to seek out obscure
ways to prevent surprise, since they supposed they should hastily be pursued
if not encountered by some of the Senates Forces, lying in a manner every
night, either in a poor Cottage, or in the open air, which the courageous
Princess underwent with an admirable fortitude, hoping her reward at last
should be not only to see her dear Father, but to hear some news of her
love Narcissus, for whose sake her thoughts were chiefly tormented; before they
arrived at a small plain encompassed with wood, which the more flourished,
because Phoebus had not so absolute a dominion in that place as elsewhere. At
the farther end of the Plain upon the rising of a little hill, that directed
its view toward the East, they might behold a house; though not of any
appearing capacity, to contain many persons: but long they had not
contemplated the commodity of their supposed nights lodging, ere they spyed an
old Father with his book in his hand, sitting under a Tree, which gave
occasion to Creses, whilst the Princess and Roxana were content to take some
pleasure in that solitude, to present himself to the aged man, as well to be
informed who he was, as also to receive some benefit by his assistance.

Wherefore after they had civilly saluted one another, and that Creses had told
him he conducted certain distressed Ladies toward Philadelphia, where their
friends remained in the Kings wars, and also that they wanted for the present
accommodation of lodging for the approaching night, the old man seemed not
only willing to pleasure him in any thing, but of the sudden burst forth into
abundance of Tears and complaints, as it should seem at the remembrance of
Euarchus and his fortunes, which made Creses the more passionate to be informed
of his condition, and to that purpose desired him that he would be pleased to
let him know what accident had driven him into that solitary course of life; so
both seating themselves upon a little rising hillock, because the old Father
was not capable of a long discourse without some repose, he uttered this
language:

Sir said he, since you will needs be acquainted with my fortunes, you must
know in my youth I was bred by the careful industry of my parents a scholar,
which profession brought me first in credit with my Prince Euarchus Father, who
was himself not only learned, but exceedingly loved the conversation of those
that were possessed with such qualities, which at the first Joined with the
ambition of my own nature, made me a Courtier, and that vocation as I thought,
exacted from me a diligence to preferment, however, honors were but moderately
conferred upon me, during the life of the old King; though after his death his
son Euarchus, whether mistaking my ability or being in love with my fidelity,
showred down so many favors upon me, that I not only in a short time, became
chief Flamin of all Lydia, but in a manner governed the whole State under the
King, which heaped on me sufficient envy; and the rather since I conferred many
offices possessed formerly by the Nobility upon those of my own profession,
whereby the better to strengthen my party, and dignifie my condition: In this
posture I remained until the great Senate that now rules in Lydia chaced me
from Court and Commonweal, which made me seek out this private habitation,
until the fate of Euarchus government shall be so determined that I may again
return to his service, or resolve to end my life in this solitude; and with
that wept, which for some time continued them both in a pensive silence, until
Creses importuned the aged father to put off his sorrow; or at leastwise suffer
him to be a sharer with him in his grief, by letting him know more
particularly the causes: this gave occasion to the old man to tell him that
many Soldiers were newly arrived in the Forest to shelter themselves by the
protection of the woods, from the rage of their persecutors, who followed them
after a Battle that was lately fought between Thyasmus and the Senates Forces,
where both he and almost his whole Army being surprised by an Ambuscado of the
enemy, had lost the day to the absolute destruction of the Kings affairs, and
an utter undoing as 'twas believed of all his friends, since Euarchus expects
every hour in person to be besieged in Philadelphia.

This unexpected news did more then trouble Creses, not only because it did
in a manner destroy his own hopes that seemed to depend upon the success of
the journey he had in hand, which was to present the Princess Cloria an
acceptable offering to her Father, but in denying them all means to avoid a
dangerous consequence, since they neither could advance toward their first
intention, for doubt of interruption in the passage by scattering Troops of
the Senates garrisons, nor durst retire back again to the Castle for fear of
being cruelly punished for the escape: so that he was forced to make the old
father acquainted with the personal presence of the Princess Cloria, and the
rather since he could no way entrust his fidelity, but of the contrary by that
knowledge procure a reception of her in his house until his own return from
Philadelphia, whither he intended secretly to go, that he might the better be
informed of the Kings condition, and by that direction more conveniently secure
the Princess Gloria either by flight into some foreign Country, or deliver
her person into the protection of her own Father as he had promised: yet he
conjured the Flamine, after he had laid open unto him his thoughts,
intentions, and desires, not to discover the least syllable of these
disasterous accidents to the Princess, for fear of disquieting her gentle
bosom with misfortunes, no care of hers could remedy; though he determined to
persuade her to be contented to dispense with his own absence for some time,
to perform pretended necessary service for her safety. When they had
sufficiently digested these resolutions and agreements, they both rose from
their seats to present themselves to Cloria; the Princess at their approach
entertained the Flamine, with the same affection she conceived to be due to
one, that had been formerly honored by her Fathers favors; whilst he with
Tears in his eyes, presently conducted her and the rest of the company to his
small habitation; excusing notwithstanding in a courtly phrase, the poorness
of the welcome she was to expect: but long she had not enjoyed the pleasing
security of that retirement, before she was overtaken with a most horrid and
insolent treason in this sort.

The Soldiers that cowardly were fled from the battle, as the Flamine had
related to Creses, and were retired within the Fortifications of those woods,
for their better security against their pursuers, understanding by some
intelligence that the Princess Cloria was lodged privately within the old
Fathers house, began to consider, that if they returned her back again to the
Senate at Sardis, from whence they understood she was escaped, it would prove
so acceptable, that they should not only thereby purchase all their pardons,
but probably many of the chief actors might receive considerable rewards. This
opinion they no sooner entertained in their wicked and disloyal breasts, but
the execution followed with so much violence, that they not only seized Cloria
and Roxana, but also carried with them the old Flamine, as a full period to
their supreme villainy, notwithstanding all the persuasions could be used
toward them; but the gods hating the traitors, though the Senate made use of
the treason, all they could procure for this acceptable service, was to have
their lives saved, upon condition, they should within ten days depart the
Kingdom; or else, to suffer present death wheresoever they could be found
after the limited time, which caused them to curse the very day of their births.

However this just sentence was a deserving reward for their offenses, yet
poor Cloria enjoyed no comfort in her captivity, but rather her crosses were
augmented by the arrival of Cassianus: one day when she was retired into the
innermost part of her lodgings, with an intention to contribute a large
proportion to her sorrows, esteeming it the best conversation she could
possess in these sad times, she was of a sudden saluted by the Prince, who
conceived his power gave him a sufficient warrant for any intrusion; where,
after he had continued his courtship with a few complements, he strived to
protest his affection, with all the reasons that the same religion, neernesse
of kindred, and his vowed service to her father could pretend unto; which
plucked from the Princess this sharp and sudden reply, contrary to her nature.

Cozen, said she, although your own thoughts can best witness the Religion you
hold, yet give me leave to tell you, that my knowledge receives no satisfaction
by your profession, since you violently seem to run along with that current,
that seeks by all means possible to destroy the Lydian rights, in taking away
the Flamins out of the Temples, the only pretended occasion now of these wars
between my father and his Senate, in which customs I have been brought up from
my cradle. Again, for your blood, I must confess it is of so near kindred
with mine, that I wonder you do not blush to see me suffer an injurious
captivity, without revenge or assistance; much more, to be a principal cause
of my imprisonment, since your preposterous affections adds flames to the
Senates cruelty; when as my love in all justice should rather be persuaded then
compelled. And lastly, concerning the service you profess to my father, as I
would be glad to see some effects thereof by real actions, instead of ayerie,
and perhaps of false professions; so of the other side, I must desire you to
remember, that Prince Cassianus was always entertained, and cherished by King
Euarchus, with all humanity and bounty, when his regal power was not
diminished: Wherefore in my opinion, you have no reason to tide with that
faction, that strives to pluck the Diadem from the brows of him and his
posterity; in which number I have, or ought to have a considerable interest.

Cassianus, after he had received this bit^er reply, with a certain pale, if
not guilty look, rested for some time, as it were frozen in a kind of despair,
not being able to utter one syllable in defense of himself, against such
desperate language, as he thought delivered by a heavenly Oracle i^ yet at
last, lest he might seem altogether conquered by the force of her reasons, when
it was impossible her sweet words could wound, tut with the darts of Cupid, he
fearfully returned this answer, which reached her ears, but not her belief.

Madam, said he, for the differences in Religion between your father and his
Senate, I esteem them no why essential; consisting only in matter of
ceremony, which with a little labor may easily be reconciled to both their
advantages. And for that blood of yours, that so much honored my birth, I
could wish to have an occasion to let (...) (...) against him, with such
prejudicate resolutions for his ruin, that the old man had not force enough,
to sustain the weight of the prosecution, though he expressed a competent
courage in his defense, and so was condemned publicly to lose his head upon a
Scaffold in the view of all the people, who at leastwise appeared contented if
not pleased at the novelty.

But Cloria when she heard of this sudden, and as she conceived horrid
determination, was possessed with a noble compassion, not only considering the
old man to have been a most faithful servant to her Father, but unfortunate by
this intended Tragedy, only for entertaining her at his house, as a testimony
of his loyalty to the royal Family, which wrought in her gentle soul diverse
perturbations: First she considered, that if he suffered, it would be some
stain to her honor, since he appeared rather to be a Martyr for her, then for
himself; which obligation she was unwilling, to undergo without some
testimonies of a supreme gratitude; yet then when she reflected upon that
submission she must use to beg his life of the Senate, she thought the
sacrifice of an old Flamine, who e're long could not choose but be an offering
to the earth, would not prejudice his own happiness, much less tax her of
ill nature; And therefore became half persuaded to let him run his last
period with glory, rather then become a supplyant to her Fathers Subjects for
mercy: yet after much contestation with her self, the virtuous Princess fell
upon this apprehension, that she in a manner became the author of ill, by
omitting that good she had power to do, and by that means should deserve the
worlds censure: so that pity, gratitude, and religion, seemed to contend with
courage, honor, and disdain, till at last she flew to this resolution, to
send for Cassianus, and conjure him by the hopes of his desired love, to be so
far an intercessor in the poor Flamins behalf, as to preserve him from
destruction by his power or interest; though again when she entered into
consideration what a jealous scruple the request might raise in Narcissus
thoughts, if ever he should come to know of the action, it almost destroyed the
piousnesse of her intention: nevertheless she called Roxana, and wished her in
her name to fetch Cassianus to speak with her, since her resolutions were not
long to be protracted, if she had a will they should prove effectual; yet as
the old woman was going out of the door to perform her message, she suddenly
commanded her back again, laboring as it were in her inconstant constancy,
until Roxana her self being displeased with her fruitless irresolutions, at
length went without her leave.

When Cassianus came, he found the Princess seated not only in a dark
chamber, but environed with those mourning Curtains about her bed, which she
had caused to be hung up since her last imprisonment, as testimonies of the
discontented State she conceived her self in: when Roxana had informed her of
the Princes presence to attend her pleasure, after she had with a low voice
desired him to sit down in a chair near her, she used this discourse unto
him.

Cousin said she, is it possible you can think, that the blood of the poor
and aged Flamine may be so acceptable an offering to the gods, as to make them
thereby more propitious to your desires? or do you believe, that my love which
you seem to hope for, will be persuaded easily by the cruelty of so horrid a
sacrifice? if you mean to threaten instead of intreaing, perhaps you may
please your own nature, but never I can assure you, compel my liking, since I
find in my soul so much courage yet left, notwithstanding all my misfortunes,
as not to give away my affections to one that has merited so much just hate
from me. Certainly you are mistaken to think Cypres branches are fit
ornaments to become a marriage bed, for the many examples in that kind have
been always prodigious; can you flatter so far your own imagination, as to
apprehend the slaughter of my friends, and slaughtered chiefly for my service,
can create less effects in me, then a revenge when I shall have power to
execute it according to my will, upon those that have occasioned my
displeasure? It should be strange they should expect to be entertained in my
bosom, that have spightfully procured my disgraceful discontent. No Cousin,
assure your self, these are not the ways to captivate a Virgins gentle heart,
or to trust protestations of such a Suitor, that wanted not hate in the highest
professions of his love.

Cassianus after he had heard these words from the Princess, hastily without
any reply at all took his leave; which not only gave occasion of many
conjectures both to Cloria and Roxana, but also of some discourses that
produced hopes and fears, until within three hours of his departure, he
again returned into the Princess Chamber, with a reprieve for the old man's
life, signed by the hands of the Senate; though with this condition, that she
must be pleased to follow the direction of the whole Kingdom in her marriage,
however Cassianus vowed by the heavens, he employed all his power to have
procured it absolute.

Cloria notwithstanding she was not well satisfied with the restriction, yet
she was pleased with the pardon, and presently sent it by Roxana to the
officers that had the custody of the old Flamine, whilst in the mean time she
conceived some dissembled satisfaction was necessary, that he might continue
still his begun courtesies to the aged father; withal to possess him with the
knowledge of the impossibilities that hindered the progress of his love,
whereby he might be less violent in pressing the Senate to the accomplishment
of his desires; and the rather she fell upon this resolution, for that
Narcissus absence secured him from all danger by underhand practices, though
her self could not be confident of his safety, since she had heard nothing
from him; which consideration at the present drew from her fair eyes some
tears before she used these words to Cassianus:

Worthy Cousin said she, (for so I will now call you, since I find your words
real, and your love noble) if the Gods did give me the possibility of being
your wife, I should a great deal rather, declare my self persuaded to the
choice by your own virtues, then by the Senates wisdom, since the interest
of a kingdom is not to be put in the balance with the unity of affection; the
one proceeding only from forced reasons, that last no longer then the motives
have power by the operation of private ends, when the other arising from the
secret influence of the heavens, engraves a perpetual affection in the heart,
not to be removed by humane Tyranny. Wherefore I say, interests of Crowns
cannot contribute any thing to the felicity of Nuptials, however sometimes
they pretend false shows to cover hidden discontents, and so by that means
couzens the world into a belief of what the married couple never enjoy, of the
contrary enduring millions of concealed torments, that are increased in
violence when they burst forth like imprisoned flames, which by accidents
procure their own liberty: Therefore I say, nay I will boldly profess the
undergoing the punishment of a thousand deaths, before I be ever compelled to
marry by the prescription of earthly respects, much less be commanded to take
any for my husband, that has not really persuaded my judgment, or absolutely
wrought upon my fancy; let it suffice your perfections carry with them more
powerfullnesse in my consideration, then the Senates desires do weight in my
understanding, though I should be sorry to choose rashly, or to be guided wholly
by mine own opinions; which is enough to let you see my unconquered, and I
hope pure love cannot be constrained, although my dear life pay the ransom of
my seeming wilfulness: for though Tyranny may shut up my weak body within
strong Walls, until the just gods punish the wickedness, yet my resolved
soul will be free to make election of death, or life, as the occasion shall be
presented; so that as your actions have changed already my belief of your
intentions; do not again change your actions, that I become of an other
mind, wherein you will but lose honor instead of gaining love; and that loss
perhaps may make you incapable of all other fortunes; it is enough, I value
your blood, I esteem your person, and love your virtues; however I cannot be
yours in possession as long as Narcissus lives; and with those words wept
again, as at her former apprehensions of his safety, which continued her in a
silence, until Cassianus reply gave her thoughts new matter to work upon:

Madam said he, as I cannot but be persuaded, though unwillingly by your
powerful and excellent Rhetoric, yet give me leave to tell you, that I
understand not your conclusion, since you have been pleased to say in your
discourse, that as long as Narcissus lives you cannot be mine; a chovce I must
confess, that the gods have never to this house revealed unto me, since at my
leaving of Lydia, a match of a far greater dignity in Titles, seemed to be
the obstacle that destroyed my hopes, and so consequently all motions I could
make of my secret love: but however, if my ears have not much deceived my
knowledge, I have heard it generally reported, that some accident many months
since has deprived Narcissus not only of the share you pretend he has in
your affection, but also of all the claim he can expect in this world. If it
have said Clorias your pretentions are the nearer; and with that fell a weeping
again so bitterly that Cassianus could not choose but accompany her in her
grief; but after some time that his thoughts had liberty to enter into
consideration both of the Princesses words and of his own concernment, scarce
yet believing her relation, he told her, that he had no reason to claim the
interest of another; yet if Narcissus were dead, he hoped his love and service
should expect the next place in her affection: and with that parted from her,
with an intention to make a more particular enquiry, into the truth of the
intelligence, which afforded the Princess a kind of a calm for the present,
that contented her thoughts.

And this calm having made her discontents something to erable, she was
persuaded one afternoon by her Governess, to take some little delight or
recreation, in a green Meadow within the limits of her imprisonment, that
usually was not frequented by strangers, where a River in the midst divided the
field by a seeming equal arbitration; which afforded a kind of a sad
entertainment to the Princess, whilst Roxana was persuaded also by her many
solicitous thoughts, to search out solitary walks in the neighboring woods,
for the exercise of her contemplation: To this purpose Cloria sitting down by
the Brook side, supporting in the interim her fair cheeks by her white hand,
whilst her knee underpropped both, as a rich foundation that nature had
created, for the establishment of a most noble building, her fancy was carried
as it were with a steadfast melancholy to behold the running stream, that
represented to her troubled imagination, her own inconstant fate, that had
formerly afforded her some moments of happiness, in the conversation of her
dear Narcissus, whom now she was not sure ever to enjoy again, which by a
quick course seemed to hasten to the Sea to be drowned in that vast confusion,
as her past delight was buried in her Fathers misfortunes and her own. And as
she was sending also her tears along with the course of the River into the man
Ocean, to be confounded in the multitude of those rude waters, of a sudden she
saw a Pilgrim to travers the Meadow, as if his ignorance in those parts had
rendered him altogether unskilful in the ways: But the Princess being yet
fuller of charity then sorrow, dispensed for the present with her grief, to
give him some instruction; and to that purpose calling him to her, began to
question with him about his name and business: The Pilgrim in a kind of amazed
reply told her, that as his name scarce deserved any remembrance amongst those
that enjoyed happy conditions, by reason of his many misfortunes, so for his
business, he should be loath to impart it to any, before it did reach the
ears of the Princess Cloria to whom it was directed, whose abode as he was
informed was not far off that place. Truly answered the Princess if you
mean that happy condition by my self, you are as much mistaken in your
opinion as you were in your way; however perhaps I may prove so fortunate to
your intention, as to help you to the speech of that Lady you mention,
although I must tell you, this passage is not open to all travelers, being
only kept for the Princess private recreation, and such company as are
confined with her in the Castle: At which words the poor Pilgrim fell upon his
knees to ask^ pardon for his fault, though he protested he was altogether
ignorant that any prohibition, had forwarned passage into those private walks
reserved for the Princess pleasure; however his journey into Lydia was chiefly
intended to her presence. The Princess quickly commanded him to rise, assuring
him, that as the limitation of those fields did not belong wholly to her
jurisdiction, she being her self a prisoner also under authority, so if she
were an absolute commandresse (as he did imagine) she was so well acquainted
with the reverance due to his sacred habit, that his free absolution would
soon have been procured at her hands. At which words the Pilgrim began to
weep, and notwithstanding her earnest entreaty, would by no means rise from
the ground where he kneeled, which made Cloria wonde^ though not more at the
business then at his passionate carriage. Wherefore, after some few
circumstances, finding no importunity of hers was able to remove him from his
settled humility, she told him she was the Lady to whom the intention of his
travels was directed. When the Pilgrim had received this information, he
beseeched her a new to pardon his rude error, since as he said, being lately
come out of Syria, he could not be informed of the dignity of her person, not
having any attendants about her to instruct his knowledge; and then wept again
as if his business had been nothing else, but mere expressions of sorrow;
until at last having wiped his eyes with a Handkerchiefe hanging at his
girdle, he entertained the Princess with this language:

Most virtuous Princess said he, be pleased to know, that it was my fortune to
be in the City of Tire, when young Narcissus was brought into the Town
mortally wounded by a ship of the same Town, where by the courtesy of the
Captain he was soon provided of convenient lodgings for his repose, and an
assembly desired of the best Physicians of the place for his cure, although his
name and condition was concealed from all but those that had conveyed him
thither: thus he remained with some hopes but more doubts for many weeks of
his recovery, until at last a dangerous Feavour made every one in the house
despair of his safety: amongst which number it was my chance to be preparing
my self for a voyage to Delphos, according to a serious v^^ I had made to the
Gods for the expiation or certain offenses. But he understanding of my
intention, and conceiving my best way would be to pass by the Kingdom of
Lydia in the journey, one day when the violence of his sickness gave him some
more ease, then accustomed, and that the chamber by hazard was freed from all
company but my self, by reason of a certain holy day near the Town, he
desired me to approach his bedside, where after I was seated, and that by many
sighs, he had made me acquainted with your unfortunate l^ves and his own
condition, he conjured me by all the charity that ought to accompany my
thoughts in so sacred a journey, that in my passage I would visit you in Lydia,
where he understood you were newly arrived: and not only declare unto you all
the circumstances of his untimely death, with the assurance of his most
constant love to his last end; but withal obliged me to deliver this Ring
which he said was the dear testimony of the contract that had been between
you; and presently putting this hand in his bosom drew out a paper wherein was
contained that unwelcome token.

When Cloria beheld the pledge of their unfortunate loves now ended in the
worst of periods, she looked upon it as if she expected a miraculous remedy, or
a miserable distraction; till at last conquered by the very depth of her
desperate imagination, she became exceeding pale, and scarce was so for any
time before a more earthly color, by little and little seemed to change that
yet lovely white, which death it self a great while had no power to overcome.
B^^ alas the procession was too wilful, for not long after her dainty,
though weak legs not being able to support the weight of her fair body, since
her pure soul could contribute no assistance, she sunk down to the ground,
like a rich marble statue built upon snowy bases: which caused the poor Pilgrim
with a haste, composed of an amazed sorrow, and a desperate fear, to fly to
her relief, cursing not only his relation, but his very journey that
occasioned it: his violent execrations had not power to breath the least show
of life into her sweet body, as if the gods were resolved to keep possession of
so heavenly a spirit (notwithstanding he continued the rubbing of her Temples
with more then ordinary passion) until he spoke in her ears, that Narcissus
was not dead, but falsely so alleged by his malicious and wicked tongue; and
for a testimony of his last affirmations (which he wished might be confirmed by
his perpetual torment, as a punishment for his offense) he sudden pulled off
that deceitful beard, that had so unluckily disguised his person from her
knowledge. Cloria after she had for some time continued in her sad sleep, that
feign would gently have sent her without noise to a better habitation, she
softly again opened her eyes, that seemed something ecclipsed of their former
brightness, and fixing them upon that object that only had power to keep them
from entertaining an eternal darkness, she used these low words: And is it
possible that Narcissus still lives? or is it my flattering fancy that ever
couzens me into new miseries? then shut them again, as if either yo^ she was
not absolutely persuaded of his truth, or had a mind to reprove him for his
unkind concealing of himself; But Roxana's arrival, both afforded Cloria
more remedy, and proved a means to beg Narcissus pardon, who was not able by
any Rhetoric to excuse the sin, he had committed against the Laws of love, in
borrowing a disguised shape, to hide that which Cloria had only a desire to
see: however lovers quarrels although they are violent, yet never or very
seldom are lasting; beside the sweet Princess had no room left in her bosom
for revenge, where there was already inspired so much joy; so that in a short
time a perfect truce was not only made between them, though chiefly expressed in
contemplation, wherein their hearts spoke more then their lips: but after they
seemed sufficiently to have surfeited of their joy, Narcissus was persuaded to
make a perfect relation of his own adventures: Wherefore, taking her fair
hand, and gently kissing it twice or thrice, as a sworn testimony of the truth
of his story, he began in this manner, whilst in the mean time the poor
Princess read a lecture in his looks, that appeared amply to instruct her
thoughts.

Most sweet Princess said he, as I know not what accident, or rather I may
call it a fate, separated our ships one from another coming from Egypt, so no
sooner were we out of sight of your vessel, but the winds, as if they intended
again to remember us of a meeting, though they seemed to deny the opportunity,
began most furiously to rage upon the waters; in so much as being tossed from one
billow to another, with a kind of a rude uncertainty, we became at last in a
manner desperate of our own safeties: but then O you gods, how were my thoughts
transported in your behalf, knowing you to be in the same condition of danger
and hazard? how many lives would I have willingly sacrificed of my own, with
what torments soever, but to have rendered you secure in my own thoughts, in
some Haven or Harbor of quietness, free from the inconstant cruelty of the
winds; and raging tempest that appeared rebellious to all our wishes? what
infinite damages did I conceive the whole world would sustain by your loss,
since with you went away all virtue, honor, and beauty from the face of the
earth? sometimes I would call the Mariners from their necessary employments,
to ask their opinions concerning your danger and condition, whilst they
barbarous and ignorant wretches, rather minded their own present affairs, then
gave me any satisfactory reply, as if they understood not the consequence of my
demand, but rather amazedly preferred their own safety, before those thoughts
appertaining to your particular: which caused me equally to bestow both curses
and prayers in your behalf: The Princess finding Narcissus in some sort
transported with these imaginations, whereby probably she should be delayed
from hearing the story of his adventures, with a pretty kind of jeering smile,
wished him to leave off now any more care for her particular, since as she said
he found her safe, and rather follow that relation she expected from him, as a
more necessary duty for the present; This made him quickly fall to his task
with fewer circumstances then formerly in this manner:

A night and a day said he, having kept us upon the Seas in this storm, at
last the sky cleared it self from its cloudy incumberance, which made us
perceive, that we were near the Island of of Rhodes: wherefore finding our
ship was much beaten with the Tempest, and most of our company unable to
undergo a farther journey without some refreshment, I gave my consent to have
the vessel put into the Haven, the rather because I hoped to hear some news
of your safety in that City. The chief commander of that Island for the
present is a great noble man of Lydia, who however he keeps a certain
correspondency with the Senate for his own more convenient security, yet in his
heart he is an entire servant to the King your Father, which not only made me
think my welcome so much the better in his Country; but his wife being my most
near kinswoman, I was persuaded to make my abode for some few days in that
place, whilst in the interim we sent out many small vessels, to enquire after
your condition: but however I could have been very well content, to have
remained there longer, in regard of the virtuous and noble entertainment both
of the Lord and Lady, yet upon the messengers return finding no advertizement
could be given concerning your particular, with a certain kind of melancholy
rage I retired into my chamber, where I continued notwithstanding any
perswation to the contrary, until another ship was fitted for our
transportation, in regard ours was held forth present altogether incapable of
another voyage, without a great deal of mending and reparation: within two or
three days I took my leave of my kinswoman, and her Lord; though the gods knew
in a very blunt manner, (my thoughts being over burdened for complements) and
presently directed my course to the Island of Cyprus, where I hoped you were;
or at leastwise by my coming thither would be arrived; notwithstanding I could
not in my fearful apprehension but doubt the worst, notwithstanding those in
the ship, endeavored by many circumstances, to confirm me in a certain belief
of your safety, which made the journey something less tedious and distasteful:
I conjured the whole company entirely to conceal my name, from any person
whatsoever until you were found: when we landed at Salamine I understood the
Queen your mother and my father were both lately removed from thence to
Paphos, where again strictly enquiring after you, and not hearing any news
whatsoever either of your abode or safety, after I had spent some time in
tearing my hair, and using other fruitless complaints, I resolved in a
disguise to seek you out in the country of Pamphylia; whither very probably I
conceited the winds and the storm might have driven your ship, and by that
means have committed your person to a new imprisonment, since that Territory
is known to belong unto the King of Egypt: To this purpose having changed my
habit (being only accompanied by a few of my attendants I could best trust) we
put Egyptian colors upon the top of our vessel, as if we had only belonged to
the principality of Pamphylia: thus we salled with all possible speed toward
the confines of the lesser Asia, in regard we understand by certain Merchants
of Syria remaining in Salamine, no news had been heard of you in that
Kingdom, since your departure from the City of Memphis: but the gods perhaps
intending by this diversion, to bring about other purposes according to their
divine and inscrutable decrees, before we approached the shore of Pamphylia by
some hours sail, we were suddenly set upon by two vessels of Tire, and
presently commanded to yield our persons to their power and dispose, without
dispute or contradiction, unless we would hazard our selves in a contention
most dangerous and desperate. This language meeting my discontents and
despair, caused me to make a greater resistance, then was either convenient or
necessary for our welfare, until at last being wounded in many parss of my
body, and not a few of the company slain or hurt, our ship was not only seized
upon, but my self carried to the Castle of the Town, where an Officer
belonging to Philos commanded me to custody, for that Philos was for the
present gone to Damascus; within three days Philos returned from Court, and
not long after coming into my chamber, he quickly knew who I was: so bestowing
upon me some few complements (I desiring him in the interim to conceal my name
and qualisy) he presently gave order, for my respectfull attendance and
necessary cure: also he appointed me to be removed to the best lodgings in his
Castle, with a promise absolutely not to discover my person to any, but his own
sister Artemesia, who, as he said to his knowledge, would contribute her best
assistance to my recovery: in this condition (though extremely afflicted
inwardly by reason of your self) I remained for at least a weeks space; when
again one day Philos came and seated himself by my bed side, telling me after
some few complements, that as his sister had provided such rare simples for the
practice of my Physicians, as could not otherwise be procured, by all the power
and ar^^ the great and rich Kingdom of Syria, so was she resolved shortly in
person to give me a visit, if not daily accompany me in my distempers, when I
should be rendered as he said more proper for the conversation of ladies: then
he made me exactly tell him the story or manner of our unfortunate separation
at sea; seeming extraordinary inquisitive, as well in what posture I left you
at parting, as what my opinion was concerning your safety: Although this
relation with so many particulars, brought to my remembrance by the discourse,
increased my torments, like so many sharp daggers piercing my heart, with a
thousand mortal wounds, yet I could not well deny the civillity, in regard
that I was not only in the Country of Syria, where I knew it would have been
held a kind of a rude barbarism in conversation, not to comply in all
discourses whatsoever, notwithstanding any discontent or passion, but that for
the present, I seemed to be also entertained with the best expressions of love
and kindness, could be imagined in his house: after I had made answer to what
he could possible require at my hands in that nature, I both desired and
conjured him to send speedily, what ships he could spare out of his Harbors,
to enquire after your welfare and aboade: which being promised (some of the
Physicians at the same time coming into the room) he necessarily left me to
their dispose and directions.

As I began to recover my health, I became every day m^^e then other persuaded,
and satisfied concerning the certain hopes of your safety, in regard we cold
not hear of any shipwracks, that had happened upon any of those coasts, or seas
near Syria, Pamphylia, or Cyprus, how diligent soever the messengers had been
in their enquiry: which in a short time so mended my condition, if not repaired
my disability, that oftentimes I was not only able, but prescribed to walk into
the garden, and other places of pleasure for my better recreation: And this was
an occasion, that one afternoon I was sent for by the Lady Artemesia ( Philos
being for the present somewhere out of the way, attending upon his necessary
occasions) at my arrival I found the Lady her self seated at the upper end of
the room with a Sampler in her hand, and a waiting woman attending by her, that
furnished her with those silks she had occasion to use; however at my approach
she rose up, to give me a respectfull salutation, and that drew from me some
complements in regard of the dainty work she had designed, which in truth
appeared excellent to my apprehension, being only the pretty banquet of the
gods, where Juno sweld with over much jealousy because Ganymed was so near her
husband: but that which pleased most my opinion, was to see the angry looks of
Cupid, because his mother courted her deformed Vulcan in such an assembly,
whilst Mars appeared to be out of countenance at the action. After I had not
only viewed but commended the artificial hand, that had so lively described
the delightful story, Artemesia made me this reply; that it was no wonder if
humane creatures were given so much to love, when the very gods themselves were
troubled with those passions. Truly Madam said I, although I cannot but allow
of the passion, when it is ordained to produce only noble effects, yet
certainly the gods could never be subject to those imperfections, when for the
most part their flames were unlawful, as either preventing of other men's
loves, or destroying the chastity of virgins, as the Poets mention: for my
part said she, I am of opinion, although most of their actions described by the
wandering fancies of Poets, were but mere fictions, yet it cannot be but the
stories of Perseus and Hercules, both sons to Jupiter were true, and
consequently do show to our example, the lawfulness of the passion, when such
Heroes were produced: the one of a married wife, the other of a maid, to free
the world from oppression and injury, since they appeared busied in no other
employment; who for their excellent qualities and justice, have been since
esteemed gods. This discourse I must confess coming from a virgin, did
something amaze me, yet we continued our disputation until the time of the
day, and Philos coming into the room, prevented any further contention, in a
subject I as much delighted in as her self. At which expression the sweet
Princess smiled, as if some cause had been given her of jealousy, however she
told him, although his story began to be suspicious, yet she had so much
justice in her resolution, as to attend the end of his discourse, hoping that
his relation at last would clear all difficulties: but by my honesty Madam
said Roxana, you will perchance be deceived in your confidence, when you may be
sure he will never accuse himself what fault soever he has committed
privately; which words proceeded so sharply from the old woman's delivery, that
it might be easily conjectured, that in her youth she had been sometimes
couzened in her love; or at leastwise was of that opinion: nevertheless Cloria
bid Narcissus go on, protesting she would not do that wrong to her own
innocent and noble thoughts, as to suspect him whom she had in her judgment
esteemed worthy of her affections: At which declaration the poor Pilgrim
seemed to be transported with a new joy; and after he had given her humble
thanks for the confidence she had of his virtues, that became increased by
that opinion, he took her white hand again, upon which he imprinted a
multitude of vows able to drive jealousy out of the world, and then proceeded
in this manner.

But this interruption as I said, not only put off the exercising of my wit,
and perhaps Artemesia's intention, but also carried us all to supper, where
many looks of the young Lady to invite my eyes to the like encounter, gave my
thoughts more then enough suspicion, and so consequently my mind a great deal
of trouble all the night following; until the morning brought into my chamber
an old woman, whom I had often seen in those visits her mistress had bestowed
upon me in my ficknesse, and boldly seating her self upon my bed, abruptly
used these words:

Of all the men in the world said she, I wonder at your stupidity, since your
youth and beauty should be such flames to love, rather to consume your quiet
rest, then coldly thus to entertain the more then offered affections of
another Venus, whose perfections are only subjects of admiration. Is it
possible that so bright a star as Artemesia, has not a powerful influence
in your dull soul? When the earth seems to tremble at the greatness of her
Uncle, which renders all people in a manner willing to become his slaves,
whilst you appear loath to be his friend. Can you think these frequent visits
that this fair and great Lady made to you in your sickness, and since her
free conversation, proceed from ordinary respects, when the greatest Princes in
Asia are not thought worthy of the favors without coming clothed with the
pretensions of being her husband; And alas, who can be esteemed so happy as
to meri^ such a Title, however far above you in dignity, though I could wish
she had chosen long ago to have prevented her unhappy fate, by casting her
eyes and heart upon such a subject: if you do not yet understand this old
Philosophy, at leastwise believe the new logic I deliver that am her nurse,
and consequently should know her mind. Let it suffice, if you list you may be
happy beyond Kings; but if your perverse fortune intend you not such a
blessing, certainly no less a curse then destruction will accompany the
disaster; since there is no mean to be expected, between possession in love or
ruin by hate; And after some time left me to be accompanied only by my own
imagination, which soon represented unto me these considerations. First the
dangerous consequence of being in the custody of Artemesia's brother, who had
the commodity as well to destroy as to speak the word; and next the rage of the
whole family if they should conceive themselves dishonored by the refusal.
Yet dear Cloria said he, my not to be conquered loyalty to you, was sufficient
to resist, though not to prevent all difficulties. At which expression, the
Princess only with another pretty smile, bid him go on in his story; but the
first said he, most troubled my thoughts, since Philos love to his sister as I
believed, would easily be persuaded by my death to make a greater distance
between our affections, when he should find my constancy could not be removed
by his milder art, rather then hazard Artemosia's honor; but for the second,
although I supposed the whole family would hold it for a supreme indignity, to
have their kins-woman refused by my neglect, yet the revenge could not well be
executed without the discovery of the Ladies passion: but I reresolved as my
best defense, neither to take notice of the old woman's discourse, nor of her
Mistresses courtship, until I were yet pressed by some new overture, not to be
waved without a peremptory reply, and then to show my courage in our loves;
since the Ladies passions, I supposed would not break out to any dangerous
violence, until she became absolutely desperate in her hopes. After I had
dressed my self, and was entertaining my thoughts in a retiring place belonging
to my lodging, I became suddenly invited by a messenger sent by Philos, to
accompany him to a certain place belonging to his Uncle Philostros, not above
four hours voyage in a Coach; where the great favorite had employed
abundance of wealth, with more industry, to render it an habitation both
curious and stately, as being the place not only of his birth, but bearing the
name of his family. The first object that presented it self to our eyes, was a
beautiful Town, though more in the quality then in the quantity of the
houses, built in such a just uniformity, that it became a question to my
imagination, whether the order or the materials should have the greater
pre-eminence in my opinion, since the one in a pleasant prospective pleased the
sight, as the other in a mature consideration satisfied the understanding: for
as Cypres ^rees being mixed with the several buildings, afforded a most
delightful variety, so the richness of the stone showed it was designed to be
lasting; both which being joined together, the whole could not choose but be
admirable, in so much as I had much ado to get my looks off those rarities,
until greater wonders appeared ready to entertain me, which was the Palace it
self seated in a convenient ascent, built all of Tuscan work, with such exact
skill, that the Architectures of the wonders of the world, might have been
present at the design: It was framed into a perfect square, each angle
supported by a goodly Pavilion, elevating their gilded heads above the rest of
the Fabric, whilst two Galleries of either side joined by a portall of
several colored Marble, enclosed in a large Court that only at the further
end made a brave Tarras, paved artificially with Moysayck work, and bounded by
rail and baller of Corinthian Brass, where upon both sides the stairs upon
double pedestalls of Porphir, were placed the two statues of Saturn and
Jupiter; The outward Court round about the walls seemed to be crowned with
Urmes, mixed with half statues of the ancient Grecians, whilst the entrance
being open at the top the architrave freeze and cornish were cut off in the
middle, and finished with Cartooses instead of meeting. The gate of either part
was supported by Jonick pillars, two behind and one before, which made a
return in the building, and four gilded Lions upon low pedestals seemed to
guard the passage. After we had traversed these beautiful enclosures, we were
let into the gardens for the more convenience of shade, since the day already
began to be enflamed by the Suns violence, which for the more curiosity were
ordered into several discents, supported by huge Arches of white Marble, and
in many places so covered with excellent Fruit trees, that they seemed a far
off, to be painted over with delightful Landskips of woods, whilst the Birds
and water enclosed in the vaults sent forth a pleasing murmur to the air. The
first garden although it were less then all the rest, because it might afford
a better prospect upon the other, was divided into four squares, each
containing a magnificent fountain, the one having the brazen statue of
Hercules with his club in his hand, environed about with a Crystal lake,
wherein were Fishes so gentle by education, that they waited in the water to be
fed by those that viewed the curiosities. The superfice of the pond was formed
into twelve angles, and raised three foot high by a certain call of cut
stone, that resembled a hedge, whereupon each point was put, one of his labors
artificially cast in mettle. The second water work represented the naked
figures of Diana and her Nymphs in white Marble; however so shadowed by a
dainty grove planted by Art for that purpose, that their whole shapes could not
perfectly be discovered, though there appeared enough for delight and
admiration, whilst poor Actaeon without the trees in a green plat of ground
seemed to be torn in pieces by his own hounds, according to the judgment
given against him by the revengefull goddess, though his friends in every place
out of the bushes, appeared to haste to his rescue. The third fountain was
only of Perimus and Thisbe, with the tragical event of their loves. And the
last figured the fates of Hero and Leander, where her Tower being built in a
certain other lake, which received its current from the first, made a kind of
confused, though little Sea, wherein the compassionate Nymphs by exact
expressions, were apprehended to bewail the lovely Youths death, whilst his
distracted love, cast her self from the battlements of her own lodgings, to
accompany him in his burial. But that which most delighted my senses (because
it afforded a pleasing prospective between diverse rows of even set Trees) was
a certain banqueting house, built after the form of a round Temple, with
large windows of bright glass, divided by gilded pillars, notwithstanding it
had a portall, to give it entrance, of many transparent columns, or at
leastwise they so appeared to my view at a distance; the materials that built
it, were yellow minerals, enterlaced with shells of mother of Pearl, so that
the structure resembled a Tower of gold garnished with jewels; and being
shelered over head in every place but before, by united cypresses, it
represented to my imagination, a rich Tabernacle in a stately Pavillions since
the Trees were so tall, that they gave it rather a shady luster, then a dark
coverture. Scarce had I contemplated this pleasant object, but that Philos
invited me to a nearer taste of the beauty, it being to be past over by a
Bridge silvered over, since the house it self was seared in an Island made by
the winding course of a natural River, though many artificial streams from
it, seemed to contribute some assistance to the running Brook.

At our arrival (having spent a quarter of an hours time in descending the
several sorts of stairs, that carried us into the lower Gardens) we might
encounter with our eyes, at the first opening of the door, the Lady Artemesia,
newly come out of the water, scarce having covered her modesty with a Lawne
smock; neither did our surprisall seem to hasten the accommodation of that
light coverture to the best advantage, as if she were so far from being
ashamed to be taken in that posture, that she rather expressed a desire to have
her beauties still seen; her hair was at full length, though curiously curled,
which pretended to design, and not to accident, since two waiting-women in
Nymphs attire, held a great Looking-glass before her, whilst she carefully
dressed her face with certain black patches, cut into the forms of Flies, and
other small creatures, for the better ornament of her looks: her legs were
bare, only she wore upon her feet a pair of rich embroydered pantobles: This,
as near as I can remember, was the state we found her in. And very near
certainly you were, said Cloria, that you could discover so much. At which
words Narcissus began to blush, protesting also with a pretty violence; that he
was so far from liking her in that posture, that he was as much displeased as
ashamed at her immodesly. Well, well, replied the Princess, go on in your
story, without these impertinencies, since none lays any fault to your charge.
Which command was too peremptory from his fair Mistress, to continue him in
any longer disputation; so he proceeded.

But however, said he, although she put on no bashful amazement in her
countenance, yet with a disdainful frown she seemed to entertain our company,
which was a sufficient injunction to cause us speedily to retire; and that gave
occasion to Philos (since we had already traveled enough over those walks) to
command us to be conducted up into the house, where we might be more
conveniently shaded from the heat of the day; and that quickly brought us into
the Galleries, where excellent pictures, not enough to be esteemed, and rich
cabbinets beyond valuation, gave our thoughts and eyes an abundance of
employments, until a delicious dinner called us into another room, where we
found Artemesia, searce seeming to be the same woman we left her in the Garden;
having not only put off altogether her choler, but also being trimmed up with
so exquisite a neatness, as if she had been prepared for her Nuptial Feast;
which confirms my opinion, that all those postures were designed of purpose,
to make me think she was admirable in every shape, as well when nature played
the careless wanton, as when art became the curious painter. But in
conclusion, a few complements set us all at table, where lovely pages like
Ganymeds filled our Wine rather in Diamonds then Christiall glasses, whilst our
fruit seemed to be fetched from the Hesperides, all so excellent; that could not
be imitated, much less equalled; yet that excellency was elevated, I will not
say augmented by ravishing Music, both of voices and Instruments, that with a
gentle harmony, rather bewitched then burdened the ear; which continued until
direction was given to take away the cloth, that the room might be emptied of
all attendants, to give us the greater liberty for our private conversation, a
custom in that Country for the better recreation, since they used not to
remove presently after dinner: however we all continued for some time in a
perfect silence, they perhaps expecting what I should say of my noble
entertainment, and their uncles greatness; and I, not being over willing to
administer occasion of discourse, till at last Philos himself brake out in
this manner.

Sister, said he, although I must confess we have largely tafted of your
bounty, though more of your near curiosity, a property I must acknowledge, that
better becomes youthful Ladies; yet it should seem before dinner, you were too
careless of your retiredness, in suffering strangers to be eyewitnesses of
those beauties which you have designed only for him that is to be your husband,
as rich Jewels that are to be locked up in close Cabinets, not to be exposed to
the vulgar view. Brother, answered Artemesia, with a spightfull haste, although
it be true that it was contrary to the intention of my innocent modesty, in
that posture to be surprised by your wandering intention; yet certainly I am
less ashamed of the accident, when I consider you beheld nothing, that either
I may be deprived of, or eafily can be equalled by other Ladies of my years;
only all the fear I have is, lest the scandal may prove offensive to this
worthy stranger, that I have so great ambition to content, that I should
beshrew any occasion that might render me suspected in his opinion, since the
interest of my blood and conversation I know must always keep me safe in yours:

I must confess this complement, or rather strange expression of Attemesia,
put me in some confusion; considering of one side; if I gave her no answer at
all, it might be interpreted an ungrateful rudeness, having received such
exquisite entertainment, pretended only for my disvertisement, after my long
sickness; and of the other part, what reply soever I could make, proceeding
from accustomed rules of civility, would of necessity engage my words to the
acknowledgement of her perfections, which might encourage some other passionate
progress of that love I so much disliked: however, at last I fell upon this
resolution, to involve my answer into such a riddle, that either could not be
well understood, or being so, it might imply a double fence, which I delivered
in this sort: Madam, said I, your beauties resemble the innocence of the first
Ages, that thought virtues were not to be hid from the ignorant world, nor
imperfections to be masked by any art, whereby the rude multitude might always
have a book open, to learn knowledge, and practice goodness, which was the
best way to avoid ill, when naked truth was the only written character for
their instructions. This reply, although it did not for the present well
satisfy, because it seemed not to flame by the stroke of the flint, that had
produced sparkles, as they believed, to set on fire the youthful Tinder of my
heart; yet of the other side, it left not an absolute despair in their
opinions, that at last I might be warmed by their motions: nevertheless, for
that time the coldness of my answer, changed the subject of our discourse to
other talk, that I confess, I approved of; which with many varieties,
continued us until the evening warned us to depart, and brought us to our old
habitation; where, at our arrival, we found a Messenger newly come from
Damascus, attending to certify Philos, that his great uncle Philostros was
taken suddenly with a dangerous sickness, insomuch as many of his Physicians
very much doubted of his recovery; but however he concealed the news from all
the house, yet the next morning very early, it caused him to take his journey,
leaving me in the interim only to be accompanied by his gallant sister; who
having the raines absolutely in her own hands, let her passions run with a
full careere; for finding that all these trials had not wrought at all upon my
affection, or got the least ground of my constancy, since the burning coals
brought by Cupids diligence from his mothers luxurious Altars, had not yet
thawed my icy thoughts. Artemesia fell to work new stratagems, so that one
morning, I being in a private Library belonging to my lodgings, where commonly
I spent some hours in the day, in conferring with those books I most desired
to read, and viewing the Maps of several Countries for my recreation; of a
sudden I might hear the doleful voice of a certain person, divided from my
knowledge by a partitian wall at the end of the room, which quickly made me
curious enough to be informed of the nature of the complaint: wherefore
approaching nearer and leaning my head close to the division, I became
instantly satisfied, that the noise proceeded from no other then from
Artemesia, which did not a little increase my wonder, since I conceived her
much beyond all misfortune: however I was resolved to be fully instructed, and
to that purpose settling my ears to an entire attentiveness, in distinct words
I heard this language.

O unhappy Artemesia, said she, is it possible that thy own beauty is of so
poor a value, that it has not the power to attract the least regard from a
youthful eye, which has been accustomed heretofore, to inflame all the hearts
of Syria? or is thy Uncles dignity fallen in the estimation of all the world,
since a stranger in thy power as a prisoner contemnes both? O you gods of love
and honor said she, permit not our family to be disgraced though you be
determined I shall perish, since I cannot persuade him I must hate my self;
and by consequence become a destroyer of us both; for as I am resolved not to
breath only to suffer, so must not he live chiefly to triumph; with much other
goodly stuff of this nature, which I leave to repeat, because I will not
profane your most chaste ears, with all the particular's of her violent and
ridiculous passion; however I was forced to dwell with my consideration upon
two points in her mad expression; the first was, that she seemed to declare me
a prisoner, which until then I never understood; though I must confess, I
found my liberty oftentimes restrained under the pretense of a loving care of
my he alth: And the other that appeared more terrible, her seeming resolution,
either to enjoy or to destroy. Which made me when I had heard enough, to retire
to my own chamber; but many days I had not continued there, before I perceived
by the apparent neglect of the whole house, Artemesia not sending for me
according to her custom, that I was held for no other then a prisoner, being
every night locked into my lodging by an officious Groom. All which was done as
I understood to bring down my proud and Icy heart, to comply with her desires;
her nurse in the interim giving me many items of her intention; besides, I
might behold every day out of my chamber window, the rich and glorious
triumphs of my insolent Mistress, when she mounted her Chariot to take the
air for her recreation, or performed some other visits for her pleasure. And
that the splendour might more appear to my thoughts, as intended affronts,
contemning my low condition and captivity, she caused an ordinary way to be
made by my door, where she daily past with mirth in her countenance and scorn
in her language; to show she had not only forgot her old love, but the very
remembrance I was in the house; whilst in the mean time the foresaid nurse
would now and then give me a visit, as it were covertly out of pity, to
comfort up my thoughts against her Ladies rigor; however I very well knew her
intention was but the better to discover my resolutions; nevertheless, with
all which humors I was content to play, to avoid any further encumbrance of
her Mistress offered affection, not doubting but at her brothers return I
should be able to procure my releasement, the only happiness I aimed at,
though my endeavors were not of force to prevent this following mischief; for
Artemesia finding that no artifice could make me entertain her love, or adore
her person, since the heavens knew I had a brighter deity to worship, which
kept me from all superstitious Idolatry, began to be enamoured with her own
revenge, and so resolved to make me become a Martyr before my time: wherefore
one day coming into my chamber, when I least looked for her company, her own
pride as I thought, having forbid her entrance, bearing in her hand a short
dagger, as in her countenance a rough tempest, saluted me with this desperate
language: Villain, said she, do thou think to carry the Trophies of my
dishonor into thy own Country, to adorn the chariot of thy Mistresses
triumphs, with those spoils thy disdain has purchased in this Castle, to
the disgrace of our whole family? and with that struck at my naked breast,
being newly unbuttoned by reason of the heat of the weather, with such a woman's
violence, that I must confess, my quick prevention had fortune enough to avoid
the danger of the stroke, though not so much power as to hinder her rage; for
finding I had not only defended my self against her intended and malicious
fury, but endeavored to become an absolute conqueror over her mad passion, by
striving to dispossess her also of her weapon, with a spleen more infernal
then humane, because she could not hurt me, she resolved to wound her self,
whereby I might be esteemed the greater criminal, to take off that blemish
which hung upon her reputation by her too violent love; but the stroke proved
more deadly then perhaps she imagined, for it not only pierced her arm, where
she only intended it, but by reason of the sharpness of the point, entered a
great depth into her naked side, which with the effusion of a great deal of
blood (that at last called up most part of the house to her assistance) left
her dead in the view of all the spectators. This sad disaster, as you may
imagine, sufficiently enraged the whole company, and conceiving me either the
actor, or the instrument of the Tragedy, with all violence haled me to a closer
prison in the Castle, whilst according to the custom of those parts, my
process was to be made the next morning by the Justice of the Town, before
the body could either be buried or imbalmed. This accident gave my confused
thoughts sufficient employment; however I made a great question whether I
should confess my name, or conceal my condition, finding by my citation, I
was only called the ungrateful stranger, which gave me some opinion that my
quality was not generally known in the City; believing as the one would not at
all help to lessen the crime pretended against me, but rather give the more
suspicion of a hidden design, in that I durst attempt a murder of that horrid
nature, which an ordinary person would never have performed, so the other might
in some sort help to hide the shame to our Family, in being called to a
public defense in a case of such a wickedness: wherefore I determined not to
reveal my self, until some apparent necessity procured it.

At my arraignment, there was alleged against me besides the breach of the
rules of hospitality, how that it was impossible any other could commit the
murder, since Artemesia was found alone with me in my chamber; and it was not
to be supposed she had killed her self. On the conteary, I pretended that
being a mere stranger in those parts, it could not be imagined I should harbor
so much malice in my breast, as to become the murderer of one that had treated
me in my sickness with abundance of humanity; besides I said, the weapon which
had given Artemesia her deadly wound, was found by all the company in her own
hand: but the business being thus to and fro violently disputed, Artemesia's
nurse was sent for to give further restimony of my carriage toward her
Mistress during my aboade in the Castle, which could not choose but give in the
opinion of all there present, a great deal of light in the disputation;
however, the malicious old woman imagining her declarations might afforde me
some assistance, refused to come, pretending she was necessarily employed in
the Funeral of her dead Mistress, being locked up with the body in her
private chamber; though the truth was, she thirsted after my life to save the
honor of Artemesia, and the whole family, since by that means I should not
have the opportunity to divulge her preposterous love; so that at last I was
not only found guilty, but condemned privately to lose my head within the
Castle court; fearing belike in my last speech I would publish some passages,
that might render the people satisfied of my innocence, and Artemesia's
lasciviousness. Thus finding all my honest Rhetoric, could not prevail in my
just defense to secure me from condemnation, I resolved to declare my person,
hoping that although it might not prove of sufficient force to divert my
judgment, yet nevertheless it would be a motive to prot act my execution
until Philos returned from Damascus; which declaration happily met with my
expectation: For after the Judges with much amazement had entertained the
knowledge of my condition, being the son of him who was esteemed so intimate a
friend to the Kingdom of Syria, they not only presently signed my reprive, but
conveyed me with all the respect their laws would give them leave, back again
to the prison, where I remained until Philos return, who brought with him the
news of Philostros death and burial, though four days time was spent after
his arrival before he offered me a visit, in which space I had liberty enough
for consideration what would be my fate: At last he came and saluted me with
this discourse to my no small admiration.

My Lord said he, I must not only desire you to forget all your ill usage in
this Castle, but to interpret the reasons, to have proceeded from a woman's
unruly passion (for I cannot give it a better Title) without my privity, which
my future actions, and my present discourse shall testify, if either you will
believe my words, or pardon my intentions. Be pleased then in short to know,
for my resolution is to make unto you a particular confession, and after commit
my self unto your goodness and mercy, that when you and the fair Princess
Cloria were at Memphis with Orsames, it was my fortune to be conquered by the
power of love, proceeding not only from the excellency of her beauty and
conversation, but as I may say was thrust upon me by such a forcible and
precipitate fate, that could not to be contradicted by the power of any reason
or temper; in so much as I must tell you, in regard of those passions, I could
neither eat, sleep, nor rest with convenient satisfaction; so that I conceived
my self obliged for my preservation, to contrive a project with the Lydian
Ambassador then remaining at Memphis, which was to interrupt your passage at
Sea going into Cyprus, whereby the better to make a separation between your
love, and that which the Princess bore you, that both mine, and my sister
Artemesias might succeed in the places: And however the gods prevented rather
the manner of the execution, then the effect of our designs, by contrary
storms and accidents at Sea, yet I must now inform you, that as your self by
fortune were taken by our ships, which has since produced this late dismal
mishap concerning my sister, so the Princess Cloria, by chance falling upon
the Coasts of the Island of Creet, is now delivered into the possession of the
Senate of Lydia; and they as I am informed, from those Ambassadors of our
Country that are at Sardis, intend with some violence to bestow her in marriage
upon her Consin Cassianus Prince of Iberia, whereby the better to fortify
their pretentions and Titles against King Euarchus her father; however they
seemed for a long time to play with my hopes, as if they only intended her for
my satisfaction, belike imagining that such an expectation would always be
sufficient to continue our family faithful to their purposes, and so
consequently make my Uncle Philostros ever willing to employ his power with
Orsames for their advantages; but he being now dead (which news they have
already received in Lydia) they publicly disclaim from having any such
intention, as believing now we can no more contribute profitably to their
designs: wherefore as my thoughts and resolutions intend a present retirement
in some place of religion, to seek pardon of the gods for my many violent and
unjust ambitions, so did I very well know, their mercies in no kind were to be
obtained, without such a particular declaration of my own faults, which I have
now made unto you: as I can no way doubt of your charity and compassion in my
behalf, according to the nobleness of your nature; so may you be pleased to
take what free liberty you please for your departure, with a promise also on my
part to be ready to assist you with my best services, either in your loves to
the fairest Princess, or upon what other occasion soever that may make you
better honored and esteemed in the world. After he had delivered thus much, I
must confess I was so well satisfied with this discourse; not only in regard
of your safety, but also in respect of my own releasement, that Philos imagined
as I then thought by my present actions and expression, that I meant to run
away from him, for suddenly taking me by the hand, he said he had a few more
words to deliver unto me, that concerned his sisters proceedings, since he held
it most necessary his own innocence might be cleared; for that in no particular
he protested, was he guilty of my last usage.

As I cannot deny said he, but that I kindled the first sparkles by my
commendation of your person and worth, that afterward flamed so violently in my
sisters bosom; so of the other side, I never expected it should have broken
out to such an ominous passion, whereby you were to be injured without measure,
as my sister destroyed beyond example: But as the Gods have their secret
workings in all humane things, we must with patience and reverence submit all
our endeavors to their pleasure, which will for the most part keep us from
extravagant and wicked actions; since however sometimes we might fail by
misprision, yet by a small repentance we should again be brought into our
accustomed temper, when as letting loose the reins of our desires without
moderation, we are borne into a vast Sea of confusion, that produces nothing
but prodigious destructions, as it fared with Artemesia, who was resolved
because she could not obtain suddenly what her own thoughts perhaps esteemed
lawful, to convert that passion to so strange a hate, that of necessity would
not only render the object of her wishes nothing, but her self miserable
without hope of ever being able to enjoy what she so much longed for; however
her old nurses counsels, although they did not contribute to her passions, yet
they produced those projects that caused your ill usage; for finding you were
not by any fair means to be won to my sisters desires, she advised her to
assay the contrary, to try if that course could terrify you to consent: All
which Artemesia confessed before her death, her body again reviving after it
was brought into her private Chamber, as also with many Tears and sighs
entreated your pardon, which I thought good to acquaint you with, that her
unfeigned repentance might procure your charitable forgiveness: And with that
taking me by the hand again with teeres in his eyes, he desired me as a
testimony of a perfect reconciliation, I would vouchsafe the pains to visit
the dead Corpse before the Funerals, which shortly were to be performed.

Although I went with him as fully contented in my mind, as he seemed
oppressed with sorrow for his sisters death; yet I could not choose but have a
noble compassion at the remembrance of the Ladies hard fate, especially for
that the cause was only for over much loving me, but at my arrival instead of
embracing the dead body, to my wonderful amazement, I was saluted with these
words from living Artemesia.

My Lord said she, that you may not think you converse with dead, (though
changed) Artemesia, you must first know, that after I had performed in your
Lodgings that unparalleld action of my mad rage, bathed all over with mine own
blood, I was carried into my chamber, whilst you unknown to me was in danger
to have suffered unjustly for my fault: And being there by the careful
industry of mine own Physician, without the privity of any, but such as were
entrusted about my person, I was not only recovered from my trance, but before
my brothers arrival put out of danger of death; however, I desired the
business might be kept secret from the knowledge of all but my intimate
servants, since I was resolved to quit the world by a more religious way, not
being willing to support the shame of so detestable a fact: yet considering
that an absolute repentance could not be, where there wants an intention of
full satisfaction, I was desirous with my own mouth, to make this declaration
before I enter into the strict rules of my penance, by which I humbly and
sorrowfully beg your pardon, wishing a perpetual prosperity to the chaste
loves between you and the Princess Cloria. And this, my Lord, being all I have
to say to you, I desire you will have no more remembrance of me, then merely
what charity instructs your pious thoughts. And with these words she drew close
the Curtains of her bed, not willing to be seen, or any more spoken withal.

These things, I must confess, rather appeared to my imagination visions then
actions, until with as much honor as could be devised, I was set free by
Philos, who also courteously offered to accompany me with his best service in
my journey; but because I was resolved to visit the place of your abode in a
disguize, not only for that I knew you were in the custody of your enemies;
but also in that I had a desire to understand by the way, the secrets of the
Senates intention concerning Cassianus love, which I must confess gave my
thoughts some trouble, I refused his offer.

As this discourse seemed to give a singular content to the lovely Princess,
demonstrated by many visible signs, both in her eyes and blushes; so Roxana,
who had all the while, with a most exact attentiveness, given ear to his
several relations, uttered this language, with a kind of a formal gravity:
Truly my Lord, said she, you have not only gallantly now cleared all our
doubts and fears, but also in my opinion have carried your self in your
difficult adventures, more like a valiant Martyr, then a constant lover, which
I must confess deserves both praise and requital: and yet Governesse, said
the Princess, we must not commend him overmuch, lest he expect a greater
reward then we shall be willing to afford him. Dear Cloria, replied Narcissus,
I cannot but confess my own covetousness, since no less a present can
content my thoughts, then your admirable self, which is a Jewel beyond the
price of the whole world: But said Cloria, the chief property of Jewels, are
to be looked upon at a distance; wherefore, if you will be satisfied only with
that liberty and moderation, perhaps I shall without much difficulty grant your
request, Yet Madam, replied Roxana, it is most necessary he make choice of some
other apparel, better to become his person; so may you have both the
convenience now and then to meet in these walks without suspicion, until the
confusion now in the Kingdom afford you a greater liberty. But Narcissus most
earnestly entreated to be entertained at a nearer distance; however without
fruit, in regard both Cloria and Roxana apprehended, that his passion to see
Cassianus sometimes received as a suitor, though but with appearing
complements, would provoke him to some actions, which might either prejudice
their liberties, or discover his person; for that neither of them could yet be
over-confident, of Cassianus intentions and fidelity concerning the old Flamin,
although he had not since their late discourse, either showed any manner of
discontent, or so much as troubled them with visits. Narcissus, when he saw he
could not by any means prevail in his desire, as if he had been at the instant
possessed with some Poetical fury, began this complaint in verse; which the
Princess, being excellent also in that faculty, as quickly answered extempore.

Narcissus.
Most dearest Love, recall thy hard decree,
that seems both rigorous to thee and me;
The coldest rocks, though covered all with Snow,
upon the Suns approach begin to thaw.
Cloria.
But virtue must not so admit a flame,
to be it self end angered by the same;
As appetites do kindle false desires,
discretion must oppose to allay the fires.
Narcissus.
O do not so profane a holy name,
by scruples that do only virtue stain;
Long since I have your word, yours is a debt,
wherefore unjust the payment to neglect.
Cloria.
Yet it is extortion, not a lawful due,
to take by force, and never rightly sue:
When contracts name no time (you know) we may
defer the payment to a longer day.
Narcissus.
But its unjust for to defraud a law,
only by sleights, that feign would overawe
Prformauce: No Cloria, you ought to know,
The race being won, the prize you must bestow.
Cloria.
I partly grant your argument; howere
you must not be the judge, my parents bear
The greatest share in government, since I
am theirs, and borrow but my liberty.
Narcissus.
Surely that Tye's dissolved and free, when they
have neither power to give, or we to pray;
If the exigence be such to them and we,
no reason that our right should hindered be.
Cloria.
You still mistake; I do no right refuse,
but for prevention only physic take,
To temper heady sense, which well I see,
looks chiefly at it self, and minds not me.
Narcissus.
O heavens above, when did you ever read,
of such a temper, which you seem to plead?
Have not the gods approved the influence,
that your philosophy would make but sense.
Cloria.
Such false Deities as you example were,
but only Poets gods, whose lust and fear,
Rendered their Nuptials rapes, vice their design,
and did but cozen fool; with names divine.
Narcissus.
Where shall we seek to find Religion then,
if not in love of either gods or men?
This paradoxe observed, will surely turn
the world into a Chaos, and men to burn.
Cloria.
Rather such loves were naught but sensual dreams,
that made their thoughts a Chaos of extremes;
Still craving more, without the harmony
of souls, that only us can satisfy.
Narcissus.
Alas, dears soul! although your rhetoric,
would fain persuade my trembling heart that is sick,
To what you please; yet 'twere hypocrisy,
for me to seem to like your tyranny.
Cloria.
Nere did a tyrant practice temperance,
my innocence seeks only to advance,
The laws of love and honor, those being left,
marriage is a thraldom or a theft.
Narcissus.
How should I plead for love, much less contend,
when you in love will not become my friend?
But leave me with tortures the fruit to catch,
that you with crafty slights from me do snatch.
Cloria.
It Is passion not craft, that injures love,
and from your self not me, your torments move,
Which ought be checked, least our expected joys
in future times prove but confused toys.
Narcissus.
At leastwise I must call that temper cruel,
that starves my flames for want of fitting fuel,
Since I can neither quench those fires that burn
or warm my self which way so ere I turn.
Cloria.
There is no means so good to still a stame,
as for to cast on milk upon the same:
Calm then your thoughts, and be content to bear
the just decree, which passion will not bear.
Narcissus,
Certainly fair Creature you feel no pain,
that wooes me thus my passions to refrain;
For those that tortunes taste upon the rack,
cannot be blamed if they some courage lack.
Cloria.
Yet such as fail in their own constancy,
imply a guilt, and do as faulty dye;
When others that their trials overcome,
do save their lives, and gain a laurel Crown.
After the Princess had thus persuaded Narcissus to be contented, finding the
time of the day gave them no more opportunity, she rose up to return to the
Castle; however assuring him as often as she could without danger to her self
she would frequent those walks for his satisfaction; This being the decree all
the favors poor Nacrissus could obtain further of the wilful Princess was,
only one parting kiss, in recompense of all his travells; which being
obtained, she and her Governesse went home joyfully discoursing of their good
fortune, which continued Cloria's thoughts in such a paradise all the night
following, that scarce did her fair eyes entertain any rest at all; Thus as I
say, she took pains to please her imagination, whilst her body wanted that
sleep it necessarily required; which was an occasion that after dinner the next
day she cast her self upon her bed, something to supply the defect of the
night past; but presently upon her waking her Dwarf told her, that a young
handsome Priest at the gate, humbly desired to be admitted to the speech of her
highness, having as he said, business of great consequence to impart unto her.

This sudden intelligence gave Clorias thoughts some trouble, doubting a
disasterous adventure, the rather for that her newly being wakened from the
Ideas of her chief delight, it seemed to interrupt her apprehension with a
contrary fear, of being dispossessed of what she had enjoyed by her flattering
fancy; however she called Roxana to accompany her in the expectation,
commanding the little messenger not only to usher in that stranger, that seemed
so importunate, but afterward himself to wait in the outward room, because
she would have none privy to the business, before she and Governesse were
informed of the contents.

But no sooner did Cloria view this new intruder, but but she knew him to be
him whom she most desired to see, her young servant Narcissus, who had borrowed
the habit of one of Apollos Priests, in a Temple where he lodged the night
past amongst the woods, to keep him from every ones knowledge but her own, and
her entrusted Governesse Roxanae: nevertheless the rigid old woman began to
rail down right at his presumption, vowing with his too much passion he would
destroy the all; this gave Cloria occasion to laugh heartily, seeing her poor
servant with innocent looks, to undergo the choleric reproof of Roxana,
without replying one single word to her hasty language, yet his patience not
only by little and little procured him his peace; but after a long conference
with his compassionate Mistress, by the free consent of her Governesse, who at
last became persuaded, he was entertained for a household servant; however the
sweet Princess seemed unwilling to prophance his sacred robes with any
hypocrisy.

But one day Cassiamus coming to visit the Princess, the gods know with what
an envious jealousy Narcissus underwent this ceremonies; sometimes he had a
will to have interrupted his passage at the entrance into her chamber; other
while again he thought to have alleged she was asleep, and could not be
disquieted in her rest; and last of all he began to have a resolution to quit
his borrowed habit, and challenge him for his boldness, in pretending in his
presence to his right: And a thousand other fancies entertained his
imagination, almost in an instant, when there was no more time lest him for
these considerations derations; but whilst Cloria was advertized of Cassianus
arrival, and he admitted into her chamber; whither Narcissus followed him with
greedy steps to be a curious eye witness of his behavior: And when he saw
Cloria with a gentle modesly admit of her Cousins salutation, she being not
willing to give him any discontent, by reason of the old Flamine that was at
his mercy, his color began to change in his face; one while the beautiful red
seemed to claim an interest in revenge, notwithstanding all the prohibitions
of his sweet Mistress: then again the fair white had the prerogative, and
pretended fear to Clorias commands; so that in this manner they never lest
combating in his lovely countenance, until he was rid of the occasion of those
disorders.

Not many days after Cassianus had performed his unwelcome visit, the Senate
belike jealous of the Princess safety, in regard the King her father had been
strangely rescued from their power by that Army that not long before they
esteemed their Subject, suddenly commanded not only those servants to be
removed from their accustomed attendance that had been about her person, but
her self and Roxana to be conducted to a stronger Fort, there to remain with
better security, and more honor as they pretended, until the present
distractions of Lydia could in some sort be pacified; in which number poor
Narcissus became also prescribed, which converted his past content into an
unexpressible rage; some time blaming the heavens for not punishing the cruelty
as he interpreted it, of the unjust and barbarons decree, then again he
absolutely fell out with himself, that he had not ability beyond humance
force, to prevent the execution of such a pernicious command. But alas, his
vain passions were so far from defending the Princess Cloria against that
violence offered to her person, that he had not so much liberty as by one dear
kiss to take leave of her white hand, amongst the rest of her train, who were
admitted to that sorrowful honor: for the rigid guard finding by his
distracted looks, and extravagant words, that he had not patience enough in
his breast, to comply punctually with their strict commission, quickly
discharged him from his ordinary attendance, before they disposed of the rest
of the servants. This accident soon retired Narcissus into the neighboring
woods, there to complain only to Rocks and stones of the greatness of the
Princess injury, and his own misfortunes, in which place he remained in his
wild passion, until want of food and lodging, constrained him to turn his
thoughts to consider his present necessity, and to that purpose resolved to
seek some habitation, where he might receive entertainment, until he could
further dispose of his determination; since he found these fruitless sorrows
and distracted expressions, neither eased his grief or profited his love.
Wherefore after he had traveled three or four days in the vast Forest, with
such provision only as he could get in poor and contemptible Cottages, as he
past through a thick wood, which seemed to obscure a certain Plain that lay
beyond it, his melancholy ears of a sudden were saluted with a certain kind
of rude music, that appeared also more confused, for that it was at many
periods accompanied with the loud acclamacions of common people. As this seemed
a strange adventure to his imagination, after such an absolute silence for so
many days in his solitary perambulation, where doleful echoes appeared to
have been in a manner his only companions; with the uncouth fall of waters
from high and unaccessible precipices; so the unexpected newness again of
probability of humane conversation, put on a little his desire to be curious,
though scarce was he willing to allow himself any content at all, since she
that was the delight of his soul, had been forcibly separated from his sight;
nevertheless prosecuting his intention, he directed his steps toward the
place where he heard the noise, through the entangled Briars, and almost
impassable bushes, which sufficiently moderated his haste, and protracted his
march, yet at last with much pain, he arrived near the outside of the wood,
where he might perceive through the branches of the trees, in a spacious
Plain, a great many of Country people gathered about a little Altar, raised
six steps above the ground; at which stood an old Priest offering sacrifice to
the god Pan, as appeared by his statue placed upon certain bases composed of
rough stone, and with more unpolished workmanship. This discovery invited
Narcissus to attend the issue with silence, and the rather for that at every
full point, and stop of the Priest in his devotions, the multitude suddenly
took hands in a joyful agreement one with another, and danced many rounds,
about the Image in a rural manner, to the only Music of their untunable
voices, though a certain ditty, which he could not understand by any words
they uttered, appeared to express the intention of their mirth, though only
known to themselves in respect of the rudeness of the language, and the
harshnesse of the delivery.

When Narcissus had a long time enterteined his wonder with the sight of this
understanding of the reason of their assembly, he approached nearer the
company, with an intention to enquire of some standing by, not only what the
occasion might be of that solemnity, but how he should the readiest way find
out the next convenient Town to give him reception; And the opportunity fitted
well with his desire; for the Priest having performed all the rights and
ceremonies belonging to his office, was newly retired some distance from the
multitude, to a small rising bank; as well to repose himself, as to behold
with greater convenience the continued sport, wherein he seemed to have more
then an ordinary interest, which made Narcissus quickly address himself to
him with this courteous language.

Father said he, I hope it is the custom in these parts, especially amongst
those of your profession, not to take ill any curiosity of a stranger, that
seeks civilly to be informed as well in the manners of the Country where he
passes, as of a convenient place that may give him entertainment: And that I
may prevent your demand which I make no doubt will seem necessary to your
judgment, be pleased to know that I am by birth of the Island of Cyprus, and
intending a pilgrimage to the Temple of Delphos, am by chance fallen into your
company.

The Priest seeing himself saluted by a young man, though in his own habit of
such an excellent beauty, and so perfect a shape, presently not only rose up
from his seat, to give him the more respectfull welcome, but told him for his
lodging the night to come, since the time of the day perhaps might prevent him
of a better convenience, he should hold it an extraordinary honor, that his
own poor habitation might perform the service: and the rather as he said for
that their professions seemed to agree by the outward resemblance of the Robes.
Narcissus was not much displeased with the offer, as well because he found
himself something weary by reason of those extravagant and uncertain
journeyes he had made, as also that he might hope by this opportunity to get
further information concerning his own resolutions, that yet he had not fully
determined. Wherefore after he had returned the Father a civil thanks for his
favor, with an intimation he was willing to accept of his charitable
kindness, they both sat down together upon the bankside, to behold the
finishing of those rural delights, that passionately seemed to employ the
Country people, which gave occasion to Narcissus to demand the reason of that
extraordinary mirth, that possessed the thoughts of the whole company. The
Priest after he had a little similed to think of the strangers apprehension,
told him, since he perceived his curiosity went so far as to be satisfied in
those petty affairs, he would take the pains to let him know the original
that produced the effects, which as he said was the more proper for his
entertainment; since the occasion at the present detained almost all Asia both
in expectation and wonder; however he feared his story might be too tedious for
his patience. But Narcissus seeming rather passionate at the satissaction then
distasted at the offer; the Priest retired something further into the woods, to
be more out of the noise of the people, where after he had settled the strangers
expectation to a silent attentiveness, he began this discourse.

Sir said he, you must be pleased to know that our King Euarchus grandmother
called Minerva, (by whose right he came to wear all those Crowns he was once
possessor of, and might still have enjoyed in a prosperous measure, if his
fortunes had been equal to his goodness, or his Subjects loyalty answerable
to his own eminent worth) was a Princess of such excellent virtues, that it
had been a controversy between art and nature, whether had more bountifully
contributed to the adorning of her royal person; however, she only reigned in
Mysia, a Country not only barren in production of the fruits of the earth, but
luxurious in the unfaithfulness of the people, though her birth justly claimed
the inheritance of this rich Kingdom of Lydia after our Queen then reigning
here; I say this admirable Princess had a base brother also, named Leonatus,
who wanted not ambition enough to desire the Crown of Mysia, though he were
not furnished with sufficient virtues to merit such a dignity; and to this
purpose left nothing unattempted that might either advance his own esteem or
deprave his sisters actions; and to that end insinnated himself by all means
possible, not only into the good opinion of the Lords, but much more into the
favor of the common people; in which interim the young Princess being
furnished with youth and beauty, was persuaded by the chief nobility to think
of a noble husband that might accompany her in her conversation, and give the
Kingdom a hope of posterity, two essential parts as they pretended of her own
happiness; in prosecution of this desire, there was presented unto her view a
handsome Lord of this our Country of Lydia: in conclusion the nuptials were
quickly solemnized to the appearing content of both parties; and the rather for
that the then Queen of Lydia was well satisfied with the choice, not doubting
to maintain by this means a continual and strong interest in the Kingdom of
Mysia, since she had married to the Princess one of her own Subjects.

But now Leonatus began to play his part; for finding this conjunction proved a
bar to his pretention for succession, he thought it his bestway to establish
himself notwithstanding, a certain power in the government, and to that
purpose strived by all means his malicious will could instruct, to gain the
good opinion of the young King, whereby to set him at difference with the
Queen, who began to be a little distasted, to see his wife take upon her so
absolute authority, he only bearing the name of a Prince; which at last grew to
such a height, by the underhand provocation of wicked Leonatus, that one day
when the Queen (being great with child) was retired into her private chamber,
to confer with a certain Secretary of State, most employed in the Kingdoms
affairs, her husband of a sudden rusht into her presence with his sword
drawn, and there before her amazed eyes slaughtered her poor servant. However
this was an act of some horror to the great bellied Queen, and so consequently
might be thought sufficient motives of her lasting indignation, to see her
self and authority so affronted by one she had lately raised from being a
Subject to be her husband; yet religion and good nature proved so powerful in
her noble disposition, that upon the Kings sorrow and submission, she was
content both to forgive the injury, and forget the dishonor by a perfect
reconciliation. But Leonatus not weary yet of his own wickedness, though
despairing of his further ability to retain his interest with the young King,
since the Queen as he thought had so absolutely circumvented him in that
project, of a sudden stroke into friendship with certain factious Priests,
that had newly brought in a religion into Mysia, that taught this dangerous
Doctrine; That Princes deserved no longer to govern, then whilst they
contented the People. Which opinion you may very well imagine, took feelingly
with the multitude, in so much as in a short time the Queen had employment
enough, to defend her person from reproaches, as her Kingdom from civil
war; This exceedingly tormented her thoughts, until the birth of her young
son again revived her spirits: however Leonatus still prosecuting his horrid
designs to supplant the Queen in her just right, whereby to bring the
government of the Kingdom under his own jurisdiction, one night secretly
caused not only the young King to be cruelly murdered in his bed, in execution
of his revenge, because he had quitted his party, but also laid the bloody
slaughter, by way of private aspersions, upon the innocent and religious Queen,
the more to bring her in hatred with the common people, who seemed already
sufficiently poisoned, by the late pernicious doctrine brought into the
Country by the turbulent Priests: Although these crafty practices had not as
yet power to shake, or rather absolutely to destroy her grounded authority,
which had been cast upon her by so rightful a succession, yet by little and
little they so wounded her reputation, that they made her desire to have a
faithful companion, to assist her in her government; which politic Leonatus
perceiving, judging it a love passion in the Queen, put on some of the nobility
underhand to persuade her, not only presently to marry, but to take for her
husband a valiant Gentleman his intimate friend, who a long time had pretended
unto her love, however he was not without some suspicion, that he had been an
actor in the Kings death; with these baits I say Leonatus so far entangled
the Queens innocence, that she was won by persuasion to make this election,
being councelled thereunto by the chief nobility, set upon her to that
purpose, though she first caused a decree to be past by the unanimous consent
of all, that this Lord had been no way guilty, of the false aspersion his
enemies had cast upon him, concerning the Kings murder. No sooner were these
nuptials solemnized, which was the thing Leonatus desired, but secretly he
admonished the new King to fly, assuring him as his friend, that either he
would be suddenly slain by many that had conspired his death, or publicly be
apprehended and brought to his Trial by the consent of the whole Kingdom; so
that he, whether knowing himself faulty indeed, or fearing the power and
injustice of his enemies, since emulation amongst his equals had procured him
a world of envy, quickly followed his advice, and privately without the Queens
privity, quitted his Country and Fortunes.

Leonatus conceiving now he had compassed the hardest part of his projects,
sent secretly into Lydia to possess the Queen there, with an assurance of
Minerva's guilt, since she had married the murderer of her first husband; too
apparently, as he pretended, discovered by his strange flight: at the same time
also, by the help of his factious priests, he raised tumults against her, in
her own kingdom, whereby she became imprisoned, because she would not quit her
government. This you may believe, gave the poor Queen sufficient employment;
insomuch as being wearied by continual troubles, and invited to the Court of
Lydia by her kinswomans promises for her better and quiet protection, she was
content to resign the Crown to her son, and accept of those offers she
esteemed real. But alas, no sooner was she arrived within the bounds of this
kingdom of Lydia, but contrary to her expectation, wherefore amazed in the
execution, instead of being admitted into the Queens presence with love and
honor, she was commanded as a prisoner to a Castle not far off; whilst in
the mean time her young son was committed to the tuition of Leonatus her
worst enemy; however with this pretention, that as soon as she could clear her
self of those aspersions and accusations that her subjects brought against
her, she should enjoy those respects at Court which had been largely promised
her; though in the interim she must be content with her fortune, since the
State of Lydia thought it not fit for one in her condition, bespotted with the
opinion of so black a crime, should have any correspondence with their Queen,
as 'twas pretended, of so bright a virtue; when the gods know, it was either
the too much cleernesse of her own good parts, or the rightfulnesse of her
title, being of a contrary Religion, that was the only obstacle of her
happiness. But whilst Minerva under-went for many years a hard imprisonment
in Lydia, since the Queen her self was so far from easing her of her bonds,
as she would never give ear to her complaints; the King her young son began
to approach to man's estate, and that maturenesse in age, gave him a feeling of
his mothers oppressions; but her enemies in Mysia being also backed from the
States in these parts, who had an intention all they could to suppress his
greatness, that he might have no power to claim his right in the kingdom of
Lydia, gave his thoughts and actions not only continual interruptions, but at
last imprisoned his very person in his own kingdom. Notwithstanding all this,
the wise King bore these insolences with unexampled patience, knowing that as
it was not in his power to free himself from their tyranny by any Kingly
pretention; so of the other side he hoped that factions amongst themselves
would at last purchase his liberty. In this state he continued, until his
Guard found that it might be prejudicial to his Titles in Lydia, after the old
Queens death, to keep him thus as a prisoner, whereby they might also be
debarred from a plentiful share of the gain, when Lydia by succession should
fall to him; upon these considerations, they of a sudden, not only released
him, from his confinement, but every one of these men themselves strived who
might be most in his favor; when as he not only as a good natured Prince,
forgot all his injuries, but became sufficiently pleased to be at liberty, upon
any terms. But the old Queen of Lydia, drawing now to her last period, both of
life and Kingdom; conceiving it was reason sufficient for a just jealousy, to
have the heir apparent so near her jurisdiction, whom she imagined looked
upon her continuance; like a young blossom, that strived to thrust out the
ancient and withered flower from its stalk, began suddenly to question the
poor Princess (her self also being almost worn out by her hard usage) about
her correspondence with those foreign powers, who were of her kindred; And not
content with any answer the truth of her proceedings could make, called her to
her trial before ordinary Commissioners. As these might be evident marks of
Minerva's ruin, so were they not undiscovered by the sharp apprehension of the
wise Lady, though her spightfull fate, would not afford her preservation,
notwithstanding her excellent endowments: yet as she had good cause, she
excepted against those partial Judges designed for her destruction, by all the
pretentions that a free Princess, or an oppressed woman could allege, though
the Queen seemed as deaf (...) her just and reasonable request, as her enemies
were violently bent to satisfy their cruelties; until in the end she was
forced to desist from her importunities, and stick wholly to the confidence her
goodness had merited in God mercies. This not only brought her to a
judgment seat, prepared with some outward circumstances fit to entertain her
dignity, but to a condemnation prepared with ceremony, to bewitch the
understanding of the common people, who rather desired to behold strange
spectacles, then to be delighted in just actions; and in this May Game, as I
may call it, of the worst cruelty, when the form of Law was only made use of
to hide bad intentions, was this brave and religious Queen, as a period to all
her fortunes, sentenced to lose her head. Notwithstanding this condemnation,
the Queen of Lydia for some time deferred the execution, conceiving her own
honor could not but suffer abroad, in the opinion of all other Princes, her
equals, as her kinswoman in person did at home, under her jurisdiction. But
ambition, jealousy, and revenge, at last got the victory over all her other
virtues, by the malicious and crafty persuasions of Minerva's enemies; who
believed, they could not be safe as long as she lived; since it was probable,
if ever she came to wear the Crown of Lydia, she would always be mindful of
their disaffections; these reasons procured the Queen underhand, to sign a
warrant for Minerva's death, which by the Laws of the Country could not else
be taken away by any power; and with this authority a messenger presently was
sent to the chief officer of the Province, to give Minerva warning of her
approaching doom. When the sad Princess beheld this bloody character written
with the royal hand of her nearest kinswoman, it was a question whether
amazement or courage governed most in her noble thoughts; for as of one side
she could scarce believe, that the Queen had been drawn to an act so
prejudicial to the honor of her Sex, so of the other side, she entertained
the news with a gentle smile, as a wished period of all her miseries, only
with three or four deep sighs, she desired these requests of those
commissioners that had authority to see the sentence put in execation: First,
that she might have all her servants about her at the time of her death, to
bear true testimony to the world, that she neither staggered in her religion,
nor derogated from her sons honor: next that the Queen would be so
charitable, as not only quietly to suffer those that attended about her person
in safety to quit the Kingdom, but to pay them their due wages, if not reward
them according to the just service she had received: and lastly, that she might
have a Priest of her own profession, to comfort and instruct her in her last
suffering. To the first, they only answered, that as they could not give her
leave to have all her attendants about her for fear of tumults, by reason of
their multitudes, so were they willing to allow her some few to satisfy her
desire. For the second, they promised to be intercessors to the Queen in her
behalf. But for the last, they absolutely refused her request, pretending it
would be a dishonor to the religion professed in Lydia. With these answers
Minerva retired into her chamber, the better to prepare her religious thoughts
against the next days combat, where she remained all that night with so
constant a zeal to the worship of the gods, and so cheerful a demeanor in the
persuading of her servants to patience, by contemning of all worldly
prosperity, that it was easily to be perceived, she rather entertained death as
a kind friend, that intended to put her in possession of a better life, then as
a fierce enemy that set before her imagination frights of a horrid destruction;
Thus she continued her employment, until the early morning, and watchful
cruelty brought to her chamber door the instruments of her destruction: This
warning was sufficient to make her prepare with Majesty, to act the last scene
that should render her famous to posterity. Wherefore with a pleasant look, as
if she intended to laugh at deaths worst shape, when she came out she bid the
company good morrow, and then proceeded to the Scaffold with all the
circumstances belonging to her dignity, that was covered over with black
Velvet; where being set in her dismal Chair of State, she told the
spectators, that as they must not expect many words from her, in regard her
sister the Queen of Lydia was not present, to whom she would only have directed
a discourse; so of the other side, she wished them all to bear witness, that
she constantly expired in that religion she ever professed to the world, for
which she both did, and was joyful to shed her best blood, which being said,
by one and one she took leave of her servants, who being over pressed with grief
and tears were scarce able to perform their last though constrained duties to
fit their glorious Mistress for her execution; And with another sweet smile
holding up her white hands to the omnipotent gods for mercy, not long after
without the least unquiet motion, she received that fatal stroke that sent
her soul to an eternal habitation.

When this unexampled Tragedy became spread over Asia, which gave sufficient
occasion of large discourses, it could not but with speedier wings fly to her
Sons Court, with all the particular circumstances of her death, where it rested
until an Ambassador from the Queen of Lydia was sent in some sort to lessen
the fact, as being absolutely done without her privity, as he pretended, to
which purpose some of her principal Counselors had been punished: but this
Balsame a long time had not power to heal the deep wound this apprehended
cruelty had made in his dutiful bosom, until his people finding that Myssia
was not able to contend with Lydia in any revenge, and that the smallest
attempt offered by way of force to vindicate his honor, might interrupt his
quiet and peaceable succession to a Crown so rich and flourishing, which ere
long he could not be course of nature but expect, since the Queen was both old
and decayed, not only dissuaded him from any hostile evasion, but also
counseled him to entertain a firm correspondency with the State, he was to
possess; and the rather, for that the Lydian messenger threamed him with a
legal deprivation from his royal right, by the consent of the whole Kingdom,
by whose judgment as he said, his mother had been condemned, if any way he
stirred violently to disturb the peace established in both Countries.

These reasons I say rendered him as well satisfied in show as in effect, who
was esteemed extremely peaceable if not slothful in his nature; which was the
occasion, that as he could never be brought willingly to enter upon any actions
of glory, so did it make him for the most part as it were a captive, to the
pressing importunities of his covetous, and insolent Country men the Myssians,
who scarce would be satisfied with any gain or preferment whatsoever he could
bestow upon them: But to be short, at last the old Queen of Lydia dying he
without any contradiction, quickly took possession of her Kingdoms, in which
government he continued with all the prosperity in the world during his life;
but that finished, the Crowns of Lydia, Myssia, and Creet, descended by a just
right upon his hopeful Son and Successor Euarchus, then newly married to
Hyacinthia, Orsames sister, our now Queen, who enjoyed also those possessions
(I must needs say) with as much happiness (until these last stirs) as it was
possible for mortality to expect.

But the Myssians who as I said before received golden liberalities in the time
of the old King, (he being a Prince that knew no way how to be provident) when
they found that Euarchus numerous issue, and the Queens necessary expenses did
in a manner drown all their expectation; first, began to mutter in words
against the accustomed vanities of the times; and lastly they found fault that
only smooth faced boys enjoyed, as they said, all the credit of the Court, when
Soldiers and men of valor wanted both countenance and means to live, the
King being so bewitched to his own ease, and his wives content, that he could
not be drawn to help his own brother in law, against the oppression of the
King of Armenia; by which war many might be employed that now wanted
subsistence: nor was there wanting in Lydia it self many factious spirits,
that not only received encouragement by this bold language, who also coveted
state preferment in the government of the Common weal; yet these begun
discontents lay hid in the cinders of some duty, until new taxations of the
Subjects gave more desperate distastes; besides, the accidental arrival of
Prince Cassianus in Lydia after his Fathers death, stirred up the pride of one
Dimogoras to a new spleen against the King, by which means he believed he
should be the sooner employed. But that which seemed most to contribute to
Euarchus prejudice, was the sudden arrival of an old Myssian Captain out of
the wars of Armenia called Lycius, who having gained in those services good
store of wealth, sued to the King to have himself rewarded by Titles of
honor; which being denied him by some neglect, as also Cassianus request for a
competent assistance, a little protracted, this insolent Commander quickly flew
from the Court with execrations in his mouth, and malice in his heart; and
coming into his own Country omitted no diligence that could withdraw the
people from their lawful obedience, which he had the better opportunity to
effect, since he found not only the nobility ambitious, but the Priests
violent. The one he persuaded with brave spirits again to look upon the
courage of their Ancestors, who had by force of Arms torn privileges from
their King; the other he admonished to cast their thoughts upon the recovery of
that religion now almost lost, that had formerly chaced their former Queen both
from her Kingdom and life; and for the common people it was sufficient to
plead to their imaginations liberty; by whose persuasion the nobility not only
raised a power absolutely to contemn the Kings authority, in their own Country
of Myssia, but also led a great Army into Lydia, whereby to compel Euarchus to
summon the great Council of the Kingdom.

To be short, when this eminent assembly was met, as it was designed in the
City of Sardis, which was also assured to be made a free Town (as much as to
say, as not to be compelled to any obedience to Euarchus and his posterity) the
chiefest discourses that were made there, were in disgrace of the Kings
actions, and almost all the Acts that past were to destroy his authority: All
which the mild King suffered with a world of patience, hoping that time, after
they had wearied themselves with their violent passions, would let them see
their own mistakes, or the gods at leastwise would defend his innocence:
however these unexpected proceedings not only continued, but their rage grew to
such a height against his person whereby as 'twas thought to bring him into the
greater contempt amongst the common people, that by diverse tumults countenanced
in the multitude, he was at last forced from the City of Sardis, whilst the
Senate in the interim instituted a strong guard of Soldiers of the Town
Forces, to wait upon their Councels, because they would show to the Subjects,
greater marks of Sovereignty in their Assembly, then in the Kings dignity.

But whilst many were brewing their own passionate designs with uncredible
insolency, being chiefly supported by the votes of the common people, who were
persuaded they should recover by their authority an absolute liberty, the poor
King with a very small train retired to the City of Theatyra: where however,
contrary to the expectation of the Senate, who believed that their
discountenance, was sufficient to render him abandoned by the whole Kingdom,
he not only received better welcome, but was entertained with the general
commiseration of most of those parts, who bitterly complained of his hard and
as they thought unjust usage; and the rather did this pity prevail for that
by his eloquent and fluent Pen, he seemed fully to beat back all the aspersions
his enemies sought daily to cast upon him, which brought as I say to his Court
multitudes of gentry and nobility, both from the City of Sardis and other
parts, who vowed perpetual faithfulness to his person, with other essential
services.

These encouragements by the persuasion of his trusty Counselors, made him
employ his best industry to raise Soldiers, whilst in the inte^im he sent to
the Queen, whom he understood was in the Island of Cyprus, to procure him
Arms, by the credit she had purchased with the Duke of that Country, since the
Senate had already seized upon all his Magazin and ships: After which he went
from one Province to another, to feel the inclination of the people; yet as he
found most of them for him in their words when he was amongst them; whether out
of the inconstancy of their own natures, or unwilling to be at any charge to
maintain new troubles; as soon as be left them personally, they were for the
greatest number carried from their former professions, so that he perceived the
success of his whole fortunes, was chiefly to depend upon the gallantry of the
better sort. And truly this expectation did not deceive him; for in a short
space, beyond all belief they so furnished him with moneys, besides their own
attendance; that he became master of a brave Army commanded by his nephew
Prince Thyasinus, who was newly arrived in his Camp from the Armenian wars.

The Senate, who before had raised Forces to contend against the Kings
intentions, according to the intelligence they had received not to be
sloathfull in their affairs, quickly created Dimogoras general in the
design, whom they knew was a man never to be reconciled to his Sovereign, by
reason of the spightfulnesse of his own violent ambition; no sooner was he
established in his office, but he was commanded to march, as they pretended to
separate the King from pernitions Councels, and bring him safe to Sardis, there
to be better governed; to which purpose that City had plentifully furnished
money, conceiving their prosperity depended upon their Princes ruin.

This resolution was quickly known to Euarchus, and not long after considered
by his Council that it was high time to advance with the whole Army, to try
the fortune of a battle with the Senates General, since the King wanted
provision, and could not expect supplies of money to furnish out the necessary
expense: with this determination termination after two or three days march,
they met the Senates forces upon an ample Plain, spacious enough to have
desided the controversy for the worlds Empire: the conflict of a sudden grew
so desperate, that it was a question whether they sought more to satisfy their
own spleenes, or to gain a beneficial Victory; which however was prosecuted
for some hours with doubtful fortune; for although the Kings horse commanded
by Thyasmus in person, at the first charge defeated their enemies, in so much
as for many Furlongs, they had the chase of their Troops, yet the Foot Forces
in their absence, that for the most part wanted arms, had sufficient
employment to sustain the fury of the Senates Soldiers, being better
provided: which however was bravely supplied by the noble valor of the King
himself, in so much as he sustained the violence of the tempest, until his
own horse again came into his rescue, though with such a slaughter of his poor
Subjects, that it created a passionate compassion in his royal breast,
although the determinable fate of his Crown might very well have given a full
employment to his thoughts: Upon Thyasmus appearing with his victorious
Troops, Dimogoras retired with his worsted Forces, and the night hindered
farther prosecution for the present, which as I may say, enviously shaddowed
the Kings glory, who else could not have been defrauded as 'twas thought of a
most absolute Conquest to his immortal honor, if not to his Kingdoms
prosperity.

However he resolved the next morning early, again to set upon his enemies,
who were retired for their better safety, within the protection of their secure
Trenches; but contrary to his expectation Dimogoras (belike fearing Euarchus
intention, and unwilling to hazard the Senates fortunes in one doubtful
adventure) had made use of the dark coverture of the night, to convey himself
and his whole Forces, to a strong Town not far off, remaining under his
jurisdiction: Nevertheless, so much opinion this half Conquest got amongst
the common people, that many Cities presently returned under the obedience of
their lawful Prince, whilst in the mean time, the King made Philadelphia the
chief residence of his Royal Court, where again he began to rule like a
Monarch, and suffered his other Generals in many parts of the Kingdom, to
prosecute his commands with such prosperous success, that in a short space he
became in a manner master of all Lydia, though the great Town of Sardis seemed
still with most obstinate pride to contemn his power, being more in love with
that passion, that made them hope to be a free City, and the covetousness to
obtain that money they had disbursed, then mindful of their own safety and
obedience. The King who began to think now the difficulty of his affairs were
past all danger, began a little to play with the weakness of his enemies, in
so much as his Soldiers became neglected in their discipline, as the
commanders licentious in their course of life, which certainly contributed
extremely to all his misfortunes: for being provoked either by unwise, if not
Traitorous Council, or put on by his own just spleen, to see himself in the
height of all his Victories disobeyed by weak Forces, suddenly besieged a
small City that lay in the very heart of his new Conquests, conceiving his
enemies wanted power of resistance, or at least ability to bring him any
incommodation, which made his Troops less careful to prevent correspondency;
But the Town finding it could not hold out long against so strong a siege,
gave private intelligence to the Citizens of Sardis, who apprehending the loss
would absolutely turn to their ruin, since the King would be sure, as they
believed, after to employ the rest of his endeavor in their subversion, when
he should have finished the desgine in hand that only opposed him, of a sudden
sent out under the command of Dimogoras the Soldiers of Sardis it self, that
until then were never known to remove many Furlonges from the smoke of their
own chimneyes, to try if it were possible to raise the Kings siege; and with as
quick an expedition as they were able, marched toward the Camp, imagining
that the success of this voyage was to determine their fates, whether to
remain free Citizens, or become conquered flaves. Euarchus when he heard of
this new and unexpected supply, so much contrary to his imagination, however
rumors thereof had formerly come to his ears, thought it his best course,
rather to fight with them in the open Fields, then in continuing in his
Trenches, to hazard the danger of being starved for want of provision: with
these purposes, after he had quitted the Walls of the Town, he advanced
toward their quarters, with a hope to set upon them in the plain Champaine,
since he conceived he had much the advantage of horse, though his foot was of a
far less number. But though the King omitted no industry to compass his
design, yet being betrayed by the common people in his intelligence, who ever
favored the Senate more then their Sovereign, Dimogoras got some days
journey toward the City of Sardis, before Euarchus knew of his remove; the
design of the General being no other, now he had freed the City from danger,
but to get again safe with his whole Army to the place from whence he came:
The King as he was enraged with this secret escape, so was he resolved if it
were possible to fight with him upon any terms, since the contrary as he
imagined, would prove in the opinion of the multitude of no less a
consequence, then a Victory obtained by his adversaries: To that effect, as
soon as he had overtaken his enemies by tedious marches, he set upon them with
desperate inconveniences, not only for that they had locked themselves in
enclosed Countries, but never came out of their Trenches to s^irmish, by which
means the Kings Cavalry proved of no service; so that as I may say by reason
of these unfortunate disadvantages, Euarchus after twelve hours fight could
pretend but to a very small Victory; which success returned Dimogoras to the
City of Sardis with some honor, in regard that however he had not beat the
Kings Forces, it might be said upon the matter he had worsted his designs.

Nevertheless, although this gave the Generals party not only encouragement
for the present, but hopes in abundance in the future; especially for that the
Kings Soldiers every where; began both to be negligent and treacherous; more
seeming to rely upon the supposed justness of the cause, then resolving
constantly to defend it by any hazard, yet the Senate at Sardis doubting
something their own fortune or success, notwithstanding what policy soever
they could use in the Kings Camp, resolved again to bring in the Myssians
into Lydia with a powerful Army: To this purpose they made a contract with
them, not only to pay them a very great sum of money, both to defray their
charges and reward their endeavors, but also promised to establish in the
Kingdom of Lydia it self, the same manner of worship of the gods as was
practiced in Myssia: As this seemed in effect to be the whole agreement between
them; so the Myssians wanted not in their meaning, underhand designs, which
was to bear at leastwise an equal share in the government of both Kingdoms,
whereby the better to satisfy their pride and avarice; for the latter which as
'twas said they would have sold the gods themselves, if they had been upon the
earth vendible.

By this means again Euarchus became involved in new troubles; for presently
after the Myssians having made this unhandsome accord to the Kings
disadvantage, notwithstanding their so many vows and promises to the contrary,
there was employed at the same time an Ambassador from the Kingdom of Syria
to Euarchus, not only to persuade him to entertain a new Treaty and friendship
with his Senate sitting at Sardis, but also absolutely to break all
correspondency and friendship between himself and the State of Egypt; which
being condescended unto by the King he undertook, as well to keep back the
Myssians from entering Lydia, as to settle an absolute peace in all the rest of
his dominions: whether these were only brags or no is altogether uncertain;
rather may it be thought, either the Kings Fate or unhappy Council, thrust him
on upon those ways, that were most prejudicial to his affairs: in conclusion
he did not only deny the Ambassador the least entertainment of these
propositions, but at the same time also was persuaded to publish a declaration
against the City of Sardos; though at present it seemed to contend with the
Senate, about the payment of that money promised to the Myssians, in recompense
for their expedition into Lydia. This I must needs say, so much exasperated the
Town, that presently they went on with their accord by the general consent of
all: when these sums were received, presently the Myssians marched into the
Country with a huge Army, whilst another was sent with Dimogoras against the
Kings own person: As by this means Euarchus was constrained to divide his
Forces, so he sent the greatest part of his Army along under the command of
Thyasmus his Nephew, for the necessary raising of the siege before the City of
Theatyra, where the Myssians were already encamped, however their power was
increased with such Troops, as the Senate had commanded to join with them in
that service: Prince Thyasmus upon his approach (whether being as I may say too
precipitate in his conduct, or that he was betrayed absolutely in his
intelligence) when he came near the Town, thinking either to surprise or
defeat the enemy in an instant, of the contrary suddenly he became involved in
a most desperate Ambuscado, which in a manner destroyed the persons or the
courages of his whole Army, though in truth the Myssians performed the least
part of the service: But the King being followed and furiously attempted in his
march as I said by Dimogoras, he kept himself and Troops (though fewer by many
in number) upon such sure and courageous grounds, that the General at last was
brought into so many desperate inconveniences, by reason of his want of conduct
and providence, that although Euarchus at that time fought not one stroke, he
was forced to compound for the lives and liberties of all his Soldiers, which
was an occasion that presently turned out Dimogoras out of his office, whilst
in the interim there was put into his place one Farezius, whose melancholy
valor in a very short time prevailed exceedingly, for that the Myssians had
caused the King to divide his Forces into so many several commands, that he
could not conveniently maintain a considerable body together under any
Captain, to be able to contend with power sufficient: wherefore after some
Council taken with his best friends, the King resolved himself in person, to
endeavor to stop the fury of this new and prevailing General, that seemed
like an outrageous Torrent, to carry all before him, whether he marched against
Towns or Armies.

The King besides the inflammation of his own natural courage, was put on to
fight with Farezius, as 'twas thought upon these reasons: first to prevent a
conjunction between him and the Myssians, who were as yet at some distance:
next to continue a life in his own party, that seemed something to decline his
assistance in many places of the Kingdom, in regard of the others
extraordinary success: And last of all, for that both money and other
provisions failing, he began to contract many necessities in his army: It was
not long before they both met upon a large Plain in an open Country, that
afforded room enough for an equal contention, if the Fates had at all proved
indifferent in the encounter; The first charge was given with fury sufficient
by both sides, however the Kings horse without any known cause whatsoever of a
sudden gave back, and not long after most shamefully turned their backs, though
the foot with incredible gallantry, still continued the fight with honor and
safety: Euarchus upon this (however not being so much amazed as displeased)
presently rid amongst the flying Troops; as it were calling both gods and men
to witness, concerning the justness of his cause, and the unfainednesse of
his intentions; withal persuading them either to show more courage or less
disloyalty: not only in his words, but by his own unexampled courage,
evidently expressed before their faces, he conjured them to fight, or at
leastwise to stand their ground at some distance, whilst he and the rest
exposed their lives to the fury of the enemy; calling them sometimes his
country men and subjects; other while he termed them no better then unworthy
slaves, that precipitately followed their own destruction and captivity; when
as they had a fair occasion offered them to be both glorious and happy: but at
last seeing nothing would prevail, he looked up to heaven with tears in his
eyes, beseeching that the gods would take pity on him in his necessities, at
leastwise prove propitious to the Monarchy of Lydia, that seemed absolutely to
depend upon this days adventure: Thus between praying, fighting, and
persuading, he continued, until he saw most of his Soldiers either taken or
slaughtered: so that at last, being constrained with a very few number in his
company to quit the Field, he left his Camp to the courtesy of the enemies
mercy, whilst by obscure passages he got again safe in person (though much in
his thoughts dejected) to the strong Town of Philadelphia, where not long
after by the whole power of Farezius, he was besieged with the rest of his
Court, friends, and family.

As this, said he, was the proceeding of that fatal day, so may I suppose by
the dispersing of the most part of the company, it will be also time for us to
retire: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he promised he should have the rest of
his discourse at home.

His house was seated at the end of a small town, only divided by a pleasant
grove of wood, that encompassed a round Temple, built with Jonick Columns;
within which was the statue of Apollo^ when they had performed some few
devotions, according to the manner of the country, amongst other Priests of
their own order that remained in the place, the old father led him to his
habitation; being entered into the Parlour, he presently showed him the picture
of Euarchus, which for some time he had kept as he said in an obscure corner of
his house, though now he seemed to expect more freedom; whereupon he began to
read a lecture concerning his life and disposition: which gave him an occasion
to discourse in this manner:

The father of Euarchus our now King, being a Prince wholly given as I may say
to his own pleasure, only studied ways to keep himself during his life in a
quiet security: and to this purpose he not only brought up his son, after the
death of his elder brother in learning and domestic exercises, under the
protect of his own eye and jurisdiction, but when he came to years of consent,
he endeavored with some violence, to marry him to the King of Aegypts
daughter, by whose greatness he thought to establish his own regal power the
better in Lydia, preceiving his subjects were apt enough upon all occasions, to
kick against his authority: But finding the Treaty was protracted, he sent his
son in person with an intimate favorite of his, into Africa to court the young
Lady: To be short the journey produced no effects at all answerable to his
desires: for the two favorites of each Prince clashing together, although a
certain day was appointed for the marriage, yet the match broake, though upon
what grounds I neither know, or can well dispute: after this breach Euarchus
made presently his address to Hyacinthia our now Queen, being sister to
Orsames King of Syria, esteemed a most mortal enemy to the greatness of the
Kingdom and Monarchy of Egypt: no sooner was this match concluded, but the
old King dyed, leaving young Euarchus to inherit in outward appearance, as much
glory and prosperity, as was possible to be enjoyed by mortality upon earth;
and so continued for many years, until these late unhappy difference
obstructed his felicity: which truly I must the rather bewail, in regard that
he is a Prince given to no manner of vice: however perhaps some will say, he is
more beholding to nature for his inclination, then to resolution for his
temperance, unto which I must needs answer, that as the world ought not to take
any notice of the inward thoughts of man, when people receive a general
commodity by the outward expressions of virtues; so of the other side, when
good and laudable actions are accompanied with an entire justice in appearance,
it is unpossible but either the gods have placed such upon earth, to become
rare examples for imitation to others, or else have ordained them to be
extremely beneficial to themselves; so that both ways deserve singular
countenance and preservation: and this without any partiality, may be said to
be the right character of the disposition of Euarchus: now for his active
parts, that are and have been obvious to all the world; no man can accuse him
of cruelty or pride: his dear affections to his wife and children, are beyond
the pattern of all his predecessors: his activity and solicitation almost not
to be imitated: his moderation in Diet and Apparel, scarce equals any of his
subjects: if his parcimony can be imputed to him for a fault, let his numerous
issue, and the small extent of his own revenues, make for him at leastwise a
probable, if not a sufficient excuse: besides, and over and above these
specified virtues, I must commend his discreet valor, and entire patience,
since as in the one he never declined any engagement, when the necessity of his
fortune, did any way stand in need of the demonstration of his courage, so did
he never yet appear overcome by passion, when he tasted the greatest
bitterness of what affliction soever: with these words the Priest, as if he
had been transported with the very apprehension of his suffering, seemed to end
his discourse both in tears and sighs; and certainly had so continued for a
long space in a certain kind of ecstasy, if an old woman and a little youth
(the whole family with himself of his private habitation) had not interrupted
his sorrowful contemplation, by bringing into the Parlour Wine and other
junkets to entertain Narcissus, who notwithstanding, after he had tasted
sufficiently of that civility, put him in mind again of his promised relation
in the field, which was to make an end so far of his information, concerning
King Euarchus fortunes, that he might be instructed in the reasons of the
joyful assembly of the people, dancing about the Altar and Statue of god Pan.

The Priest, after he had acknowledged in some sort his own digressions from
the matter intended, he let him know that as it was no part of his meaning to
deprive him of his due, according to his own obligation, so he desired him to
excuse his passion in the Kings behalf, occasioned only by the sight of the
picture that suddenly brought into his mind a certain kind of representation
of his heroical virtues, proceeding from his nature and education: whereupon
presently leading Narcissus into his Garden furnished him with many dainty
flowers of all sorts, in which curiosity he seemed to take an extraordinary
delight, at last they both seated themselves in one of the Arbours, neatly
contrived to defend the inward part of the habitation from Phoebus oppression,
which afforded a sufficient convenience for discourse, and that joined with the
opportunity, quickly entered him into his new relation after this manner.

Euarchus said he, being as I told you retired to Philadelphia after the
Battle, as soon as he came into the Town, he went presently to his Garden
without speaking one word to any person, although many Troops followed him
with passion to know some particulars concerning his fortunes, the rather for
that they conceived themselves also to be sufficiently interested in his fate;
There he walked with a quick pace according to his custom, sometimes casting
his arm abroad, and otherwhiles again beating his breast with no small
violence; then would he look up to the heavens, as if a little he accused the
gods determinations, to suffer him that intended nothing but justice and
goodness, to be so cruelly persecuted by his own Subjects, without any known
cause whatsoever; so that in truth the whole company with tears in their eyes,
began more to consider his inward sufferings, then their own outward state and
condition: thus I say he continued, until Prince Thyasmus his unfortunate
Nephew (who not long before had retired thither with his beaten and scattered
Troops) came also with a few Attendants into the Garden: when he had saluted
the King with a sad look (walking with him in that manner two or three turns)
he at last humbly desired him to let the company understand a little of his
unfortunate passages, since they could not be worse as he said then they
imagined them to be, and for ought they knew they might be better then they
supposed: the King went presently and seated himself upon a Bench, whilst all
the company flockt about him, though he only made a discourse to them in this
nature:

Gentlemen, said he, you now behold Euarchus tumbled from his Throne: it is
apparent the gods are displeased with our actions; neither do I well know what
will become of this unfortunate Kingdom, for however they punish and
demonstrate their indignation oftentimes by evil and wicked instruments, yet
they never show their displeasure and indignation, but where offenses are
apparent enough to deserve that ch^stizement: whether these faults (for which
for the present we are scourged) abound most in my own Court, or the poison
has too much dilated it self over all my dominions I will not say; only sure
we are, that sins of all sorts are increased in such a measure, that it is
probable the gods no longer could abstain from demonstrating the very height of
their fury and wrath; I could be contented to suffer for you all, so that would
be sufficient to pay the score of our obligations, we owe the heavens justice
for our crimes; but I fear ni^ we are designed to be more generally ^wolved,
whereby to satisfy the divine exasperated indignation, who can be no more
cozened in its knowledge then restramed in its power? In my opinion the best
way is, instantly to take usunder by way of profitable consideration all our
particular ^^tions and thoughts; and so by wholesome, and true repentance if it
be possible to give some stop to the furious Torrent of our misfortunes, before
they come to such a Sea of confusion, that necessarily a general destruction
must follow: when I consider the pride, covetousness, and dissimulation of my
own family, I am partly convinced in my thoughts, that the ills we have
suffered, wholly proceed from that original: again, when I look upon the
disobedience, luxury, and atheism of the whole Kingdom, I may suppose from
the peoples impieties have come our misfortunes: If I have been too blame for
either, I must rather implore the gods pardon for my omissions, then overmuch
accuse my own intentions that made them so; since however my nature may be too
passively indulgent in such particulars, yet my disposition was not at all,
prone to give them allowance and approbation: I must confess I cannot
altogether free my self from every impatation, that has been cast upon my
government; for it is no small fault to be remiss in punishments, where crimes
any be encouraged to example; though much more to be countenanced in
oppression: And where inferior officers are permitted though not commanded to
be unjust, the Prince ought to bear a share in the active part, fort that he
had the power to have restrained the mischief; which perhaps is the occasion
of my present suffering with the rest of my Subjects, and what more indignation
the gods have in store, I cannot be certain to prevent; only I am confident,
without a deep examination of our inward thoughts, the couscience will not be
sufficiently understood, whereby to be clear in any kind to purpose, however
our principles may be right and good, for without it, neither sorrow nor
satisfaction can follow of any considerable value to blot out the remembrance
of such evils, and so consequently a continuation of the punishment due to the
nature of our offendes will not be taken away. It is not enough to say our
enemies want justice and legality in their prosecution, for that they may be
made for the present only devine revengers, though themselves be reserved for a
higher and more exemplary torments: for however actions of prosperity and
success, be not always marks of favor and approbation, yet ought they
justly be esteemed testimonies of distaste against those Nations, and such
persons that unfortunately are rendered Subjects of misery and chastizement,
since none ever suffers without a cause: when revolutions happen (if we would
but seriously enough look after the reason) in the general we should find,
matter sufficient to convince our belief, that we are not totally innocent
almost in any particular; when as the gods are oftentimes accustomed to
preserve the whole, for their sakes, that may pretend justly to any thing
extraordinary: No my friends, this Kingdom has been for some years past,
involved in too much superfluity, to expect long a continnation of their
felicity; which no doubt made us too unmindfull from whence proceeds originally
all good and commodity: when peace and tranquillity exceedingly abound in any
region, without being at all bridled and restrained, by voluntary temperance
and consideration, there is nothing to be expected soon after but captivity or
destruction, to recall again men's thoughts and actions to moderation,
necessary for a new settlement and preservation: this world was created but as
the tryer and touchstone of our dispositions for the better establishment of
our eternal conldition hereafter, since otherwise certainly is had not been
made at all: In this consists the only mistake of mankind; that we look at
present as essential acquisitions belonging properly to our persons, without
any relation to the future, when as they are I say intended either as accident
all benesits, or natural consolations, necessary in some sort for our
temporary subsistence: if we be great, mighty, and prosperous, we expect ease,
pleasure, and observance, as mere duties that should attend us, instead of
making our thoughts thereby become more grateful, humble, and solicitous in
all our endeavors, not only to augment virtue and purchase grace, but to
distribute our endeavors also by charity and reason, to those that are more
indigent upon earth: what a King or commander has in honor and power, should
be employed in care and industry for the general good: and if a beggar or
inferior person wants in riches and prosperity, it ought to be supplied by
being free from hazard and perturbation: by which means all sorts of people
may participate in a kind of an equality, according to the intention of their
first creation; since the gods certainly intended no absolute difference but
what their inscrutable decrees have determined in the future, answerable to the
endeavors of every one in particular: for however the things belonging to this
life sometimes may vary by way of accident in the world, yet the reasonable and
more noble part of man, should be alike free in every one of us by the same
rule of estimation and pretention. This consideration makes me at present look
upon my self and you in this common misery, with the same eyes of pity and
commiseration: wherefore being determined to call my own thoughts to a most
strict account, what I have acted, and how I may suffer; so would I have you
also examine your consciences, wherein you have offended, and in what nature
you may be remedied; by this means, if it be yet possible to procure some
mercy from the gods in our pressing necessities; These I say are intentions not
only most pious, but extreme sase: with these words he instantly rose from
his seat, and retired into his private chamber, that not only forced tears
but occasioned discourse from most of the company.

But whilst the King, and the Inhabitants of Philadelpha with desparing
thoughts, were busily employed about the better fortifying of the Town,
against the expected siege of Farezius, who every day was looked for which his
Troops to attempt the same (though most part of them intended, rather to mend
their conditions by yielding at last upon milder terms, then entertained in
their hopes any probability of prevailing against his Forces) of a sudden the
Myssians fea^ing lest they might be deceived in their expectations, both in the
money they expected from the Senate, as also concerning an equal share in the
government of the Kingdom of Lydia, for that they had procured, to themselves
and nation in the Battles, rather contempt for the little valor they had
showed, then any way gained credit in the Wars, besiedged another Town
belonging to the Kings party, not yet reduced under the Senates jurisdiction;
where however they had continued for some weeks, yet at length they were
beaten off both with loss and disgrace; in so much as then not knowing well
how to play their Cards with any advantage, they began as their last refuge,
not only publicly to dispute the Kings Titles, whom as they pretended the
Senate had oppressed beyond their intentions; but employed the interest of d^
certain Ambassador of Syria in their Army, to persuade Euarchus, if it were
possible to make an escape from the City of Philadelpha, whereby to put his
person into their hands, promising in the interim his hopes, both present
safety and future prosperity, as people being (as they s^id) his own native
countrymen, who intended his condition nothing but good and advantage by their
assistance according to his own desire.

The King having received this comfortable message, which pretended a lucky
O^en as be imagined to the rest of his occasion,, notwithstanding Farezius had
newly besieged Philadelphia, one day he called me privately into his
Bedchamber; when he had made fast the door with a certain kind of
extraordinary earnestness in his countenance, according to the manner he used
in any thing he went about (being in truth a Prince, that it not only
sollicitous in his thoughts but indefatigable in his pains and actions) he
told me, that as he had a secret of much consequence to impart unto me, so was
he afraid lest it should come to the knowledge of any that were not intended
to be employed in the bufinesse, doubting he had so many Traitors attending
about his person, that it was impossible almost, for any design to be put in
execution, without the Senates privity and knowledge: wherefore though he were
sufficiently confident of my fidelity, by reason of the long experience he had
had of my service, and the try all he had experimented of my honesty and
religion, yet for that one or two more were necessarily to be used in the same
adventure, he resolved to exact from me, not only my faithful promise, but a
religious oath, concerning the performance of my trust tending to his commands:
after I had assured him by verbal protestations, that I would be ready to lay
down my life in any thing his Majesty should think me capable, either of
acting or suffering for his advantage, he made me presently kneel down before
the Statue of Jupiter, which he had always standing in his chamber: and where
most commonly he made his own morning prayers: there most solemnly I renewed
those undertakings: after which he discovered unto me his disignes, which was
in a disguised habit as my servant to pass through Farezius camp in my
company, and so privately to convey himself into the Myssian Army, whither as
he told me he had been lately envited, with assurance of their assistance
toward his prosperity and protection: although I must confess I was not much
enamoured of the project, knowing the base esteemed falsehood of that people,
yet lest the King might suspect any unwillingnesse in my disposition, to
hazard my person in his service, I durst neither open my thoughts, or deliver
my opinion, although perhaps I might have showed him some reasons, that would
have procured alteration; however I knew of the other side, his straights and
necessities were sufficiently pressing in regard of the siege, to cause him
almost, to venture upon what desperate design whatsoever: in conclusion I
undertook to provide within three days space, both horses and other
conveniences to that purpose, whilst the King in the interim writ a Letter with
some few directions to his Nephew Prince Thyasmus, whom he had lately made
Governor of Philadelpha, which was to render the Town to the enemy after such
a time mentioned, with the best conditions he could make for himself, a
consideration also being had both of his Court and friends: besides he directed
other writings to his eldest Son Arethusius, who remained then in the farthest
part of the Kingdom, attended by some few Forces of his own, to transport
himself with all expedition to his mother the Queen, to whose commands he
wished him to be obsequions in every thing that concerned all their affairs;
she being in truth not only a Lady he loves beyond measure: but whose birth and
interest may procure him assistance.

To be short, within three days time I had provided all things necessary for
the Kings journey: To this purpose he was clothed after the manner of the
Grecian slaves, who are accustomed to be employed about servile works in the
field; only he had over his under apparel, a blew mantle with short and
large sleeves: he wore upon his head a high bonnet in color red, with three or
four feathers taken from a cocks tail: upon his legs were fasmed certain
black buskins of leather, with buckles; betimes in the morning we issued out of
the Town both on hors-back, my servant riding before a great bag that was oyled
all over to prevent the prejudice of rain, since I had put some necessary
accommodation for our voyage therein; however nothing at all that could be any
way suspicious, although it might be our fortunes to be taken by the enemy,
which in truth so fell out accordingly; for passing through the first watch, we
were not only commanded to stand, the soldiers presently demanding of us from
whence we came, but also as suspicions persons we were carried before an
Officer of the Army to be examined: I did not deny but that I came out of the
Town of Philadelpha; however I told them, that as I was only there by
accident, to visit some friends and dispatch other necessary businesses, with
certain scholars that lived in the Academy, who meddled with nothing but what
concerned their studies, so was I again repa^ring to the City of Sardis, where
for the most part I remained, being by profession a Priest that observed the
Mysfian rights in my ordinary sacrificing to the gods. This smooth tale I had
hoped would have freed me presently; yet they kept us all that day and the next
night, with a pretention the general was not at leisure, without whose
discharge and allowance (as they said) we could neither pass, or be at
liberty: it is true, their chief intention was to get money from us; but I must
confess I durst not overbountifully offer them any, in regard it would have
given the more occasion of jealousy and suspicion: Nevertheless,
notwithstanding they seemed to detain me as a prisoner, yet I got leave for my
servant, to be in some sort free in the camp, whereby to have the convenience
(as I pretended) to provide some accommodation necessary for the horses, who in
that office performed his duty so diligently, that I must tell you he was
constrained all night to lie in the open field, without any coverture
whatsoever over his body, though in truth it proved to be a very tempestuous
season: in this manner we were perplexed between fear and suffering, however I
must confess I little doubted the Kings discovery; not only in respect of his
habit, but that he had also shaved his beard in a most antic fashion. In
conclusion the good humor of the General the next day, or rather the
Soldiers finding there was but little to be got from us, not only discharged
me from my further attendance, but gave a Pass for me and my servant to
travel freely to the City of Sardis, without any let or hindrance from any of
their party; which proved to be of no small convenience unto us in all our
journey; for although the protection only mentioned that Town, where we least
intended to go, yet as soon as I was out of the camp, I so finely mended the
writing with my own pen, that I made it most aptly serve for every place and
region; in so much as by reason thereof in our journey, we were neither let
nor troubled to any purpose, having a discharge presently amongst all manner of
Officers of theirs, as soon as we produced the paper, when as without doubt
otherwise we had been infallibly taken and imprisoned, since those parts where
we traveled, were become extreme suspicious by order from the Senate, in
regard of the Declarations of the Myssians, of purpose so commanded, the better
as they thought to prevent all intercourse and correspondency between the Kings
party and the people of that Nation.

In this manner at last we arrived in the Myssian camp, and with a great
satisfaction (I must needs say) to the Kings thoughts, however his resolutions
were not presently to discover his person; so that retiring into a little
Village not very far from the Army, he sent me (after I had taken some small
refreshment) to enquire for the Syrian Ambassador, upon whose score he rather
seemed to have put his undertaking this dangerous adventure, then upon any
absolute confidence he could have in the Myssians fidelity, in regard that they
had already so often deceived him with their fair promises and false actions;
it was my part, in complements to tell him as much, after I had made him
acquainted with the Kings arrival. As the Ambassador appeared somewhat amazed
at the news, so did he not stick to assure me, that he knew his Majesty would
be received by the Army with all honor and safety, and presently went along
with me to find him out. The King after some few civilities, used this
language to the Ambassador.

Sir, said he, as you now see me in a posture far below my birth and dignity,
so the gods, to let us know we are but men, have for the present suited my
person according to my misfortunes, whereby to comply the better with my
necessities; this I hope is sufficient to show what a desire I have to put my
self into the hands of my native Countrymen: if either the consideration of
my past benefits, bestowed upon them in the general, or any compassionate
reflection upon my unfortunate state, at the instant are motives sufficient to
work upon humanity, I shall be safe here, and may be prosperous hereafter;
wherefore, as I would not have them to work upon my miseries for poor and
contemptible gain, so shall not I remember them any more of their former
ingratitude and disobedience: but rather let us both unite in such a constant
conjunction, that as by their means I may come again to be King, so will they
ever by such an act of kindness oblige me to govern for their benefit: they
cannot but consider with what little probability they can hope for any
establishment in Lydia, but by my means, when as already the Senate does not
only disvalue their actions and proceedings by most disgraceful and
contemptible speeches, but now that they have brought (as they believe) their
affairs to a prosperous issue (whereby they have no more need of their
assistance, and so consequently would be rid of the trouble) they not only
dispute with them the Titles and reasons of their own interest, but even deny
them the payment of their just due, for all those services they have performed
for their advantages in Lydia.

As the Ambassador did not make any great reply to the Kings discourse, but in
a few complements, concerning his own services, so did he presently conduct him
to his house for his better accommodation; where he gave present order to have
him furnished with apparel and other necessaries, whilst in the interim (as it
was supposed) he acquainted Lycius the General, and the rest of the Officers
of the Army, with his arrival in the camp: After two or three days time the
Ambassador not only exposed the King to the view of the people, but delivered
him into the protection of the soldiers; where however Lycius and some of the
principal of the Nobility, entertained his present with an extraordinary
outward humility; yet nevertheless with certain kind of sad and distrustful
looks and countenances, they performed their duties and respects in kissing his
hands, and using other ceremonies, as if they were not any way privy, much
less consenting to his journey; the King, notwithstanding he seemed not to
take any notice of their actions in public, but of the contrary gave
testimonies of joy and gladness, at the apprehension of his happy fortune; yet
in private, by many words and sighs, he expressed his own doubts, and opinion
concerning his future entertainment; the rather, in regard they presently set a
strict guard upon his person, though pretending it to be done for no other end
but for his greater honor and safty: however his hopes became something better
satisfied, for that they admitted freely to his conversations, not only many
of his household servants that were come from Philadelphia, after the Town was
surrendered to Farezius, but some of those Priests also of his own faction,
that were under the jurisdiction of the Flamins.

In this manner the King remained for diverse weeks, delighting his thoughts
with such recreations, as had been almost made customary to his nature, by
continual practice from his infancy, which made not a few wonder, how he could
seem pleased with such trivial things in the height of his vexations and
discontents. Again, it was spightfully laid to his charge by his adversaries,
that he had no great prejudice in being tumbled from his throne, when as he
appeared not to have apprehention enough to be sufficiently sensible, of what
consequence the loss of a kingdom was: but probably either he had so much
wisdom, as to reflect upon the uncertainty of all worldly things with a right
consideration, or was endued with such a supreme goodness in his disposition,
as persuaded him to bear his afflictions with no ordinary temper and
pacification.

In the interim the Myssians were not idle, to play their game to the best
advantage, both with the Senate and the King: for as of one side they made the
Senate believe, they had a mind to dispute the Kings injuries and sufferings,
both out of honor and Religion; so did they always tell the King, that he
must give satisfaction to the demands of either Kingdom, before they could
become isntrumental in his establishment; which drew on their consultations to
the length of many weeks expectation, the Senate urging the delivering of the
Kings person into their possession, out of right and justice, in regard they
had been only hired in the warns and service of Lydia, by their money; so that
consequently they were obliged with a punctual decorum to observe their
commands in every thing: of the other side Euarchus party affirmed; that he
being King of Myssia, as well as Lydia, the Myssians ought to have as
particular an interest in his person and preservation, as the Senate of Lydia,
in prosecution of which, they were to see him again restored to his Crown and
dignity, notwithstanding any desire to the contrary: but whilst these
disputations lasted, as I may say, with some seeming bitterness of either
side, which as 'twas thought, would instantly have caused a cruel and bloody
war between both Nations, one Argilius a Nobleman of Myssia came suddenly
from his own Country into the Camp, who from the very beginning of the stirs
had been a main opposer (by reason of his own covetousness and ambition) of
the Kings interest in that Nation: intending thereby more absolutely to govern
all the affairs of that kingdom himself: when he arrived he presently went
to the counsel of the Army, where he made this oration unto them.

Gentlemen said he, I understand you are now assembled about these
consultations, that may belong to the Kings particular concernments; partly
proceeding from the earnest solicitation of the Syrian Ambassador: and partly
in regard Euarchus is now present amongst you in the Camp: In my opinion it is
more just and convenient, in the first place to look upon the gods worship: in
the next to mind our own preservations: to this purpose in my judgment it
ought to be considered, why we took up Arms at all in the beginning to oppose
our Prince, if now without any other condition whatsoever we should lay them
down, and again restore him to his ancient dignity without conditions? I
pray, remember we have made a solemn protestation to the gods, as of the other
side a confederation with our friends: and if we break with both, no doubt but
heaven and earth will accuse us as well of perjury as indiscretion; since we
should seem, neither to reverence sacred things as we are bound, nor preserve
humane obligations as we ought: may you not remember, we took from our King his
power for no other reason, but because we thought him not fit to reign over
us, accompanied with his stubborn and wilful crimes; and shall we presently
restore him to that State again without amendment? are we not tied by promises
to the Senate of Lydia, faithfully to perform their businesses in these
Wars, whilst we are under their pay and jurisdiction? and shall we detain
the very object of their intentions against their minds, as a protected person
by our Army, who was the only booty they aimed at to purchase by our
endeavors? O horrid injustice and more pernicious indiscretion, since in the
one undoubtedly we exasperate the gods anger, as in the other we apparently
endanger our own safeties; for as they cannot but revenge, their own dishonor
in the highest fury of their wrath, in regard of our perjury, so justly may the
people of Lydia overrun our Kingdom, for not performing those conditions we
contracted for, before we entered their Country; which however may be a War
of some long contention and dispute; yet the effects must needs be bloody and
expencefull; whereas, if we go hand in hand with our friends, (I mean the
great Senate at Sardis) we shall not only preserve such an amity, as probably
will make both Nations happy, but for the present fill our coffers with
sufficient gold, to render us in Myssia, equally rich with other Countries of
Asia.

By releasing the King I say without their consents, we give him only power and
convenience, instead of being grateful for the benefit, to punish us for
having been at the first the chief occasion, that made him at all stand in need
of such a kindness: This disposition of his has bin sufficiently experimented
in his necessities, when as he will not so far gratify us as to put the
Flamins out of the Temples: These reasons being considered I say, let us
presently dispatch messengers to the Senate of Lydia, with full power and
commission from this Army, not only to Treat of conditions, but to conclude
with that Council, concerning those conditions and Articles which shall be
thought fit to be offered to the King to confirm, either before he be restored
to his Crown, or released from his imprisonment: so shall we be pious to the
gods, just to our friends, and beneficial to our selves.

Although there was much contradiction, and strong disputes concerning this
oration of Argilius; yet in regard Lycius the general, with many others of his
faction in the Council, were against the Kings desires; An absolute
determination was presently there taken, to send Argilius with some other
Commissioners to the City of Sardis, whereby to conclude such propositions, as
should be held most advantagable as they said for both Nations; Though it was
well known the Myssians had only an intention to good themselves; not only in
the payment of that money, which they expected from the Senate, but in regard
of their secret intentions by Euarchus suppression, to have an equal share in
the government of the Kingdom of Lydia: but however they concluded, to put in
execution their resolutions with all expedition, yet they still kept the King
in hopes by fair promises of his restoration, as well to cousen and deceive
his expectation, that he might not entertain new thoughts, or fall upon other
Counsels, as that he might not be irreconcilably distasted with their actions,
if they should miss of their agreement with the Senate of Sardis, who they
doubted might be something unwilling, to part with those vast sums that were
demanded; which sailing, they intended to make use both of the Kings Titles and
countenance, to prosecute their other designs, either in Lydia it self or any
other part of Asia, as there should be occasion.

The propositions they offered to the Senate were these: First, that the
solemn protestation formerly agreed upon should be taken by every person of
both Nations without exception, out of which not the King himself to be
exempted: secondly not only the jurisdiction but the very name of the Flamins
to be absolutely abolished, and no other rights and manner of worship of the
gods, to be used but according to the customs of Myssia: Thirdly, that both
Euarchus and his posterity so far to be disinabled in their authority, that
each Senate in both Kingdoms might be sufficiently confident of their power,
whereby to be freed in their own opinions from all danger and suspicion in the
future: Fourthly, that such sums of money should speedily be paid to the
Myssians as was promised for their satisfaction; and Lastly, Commissioners to
be chosen out of either Country, to whom the common transaction of affairs
should be equally committed.

Although these two latter Articles were something disputed, yet it was not
long before it was agreed, that these conditions being presented and the King
refusing to subscribe them, he should be detained as a prisoner, and not
acknowledged for a Prince: Argylius and the rest returning to the Camp, (where
the King to be short refusing his subscription and consent) within a very few
weeks, employed for the circumstances necessarily belonging to every
performance, Euarchus was by the conduction of some Troops of horse, delivered
into the custody of Farezius, who presently conveyed him with his own
Soldiers, to a fair house formerly belonging to the Kings of Lydia: Of the
other side, both Argylius and Lycius, marched into their own Country of
Myssia, with money and triumph, as if they had deserved immortal fame, for
their disloyalty, which for the present must end my doleful story, since the
time of the day envites us to take part of a slender supper, according to the
warning of the little Bell I hear: however before you go to bed, I engage my
self, to furnish you with another relation, much more pleasing to my thoughts,
that occasioned the late meeting of the people in the Fields, with such
expressions of joy as you beheld: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he led him
into a pretty room, where they found two or three dishes of meat newly set
upon the Table, attended only by the old woman and the youth. After they had
given thanks to the gods, within an hours space they ended their supper; the
cloth being presently taken away, and some few other discourses of delight
fittest for digestion past over, the Priest again began this new relation.

Euarchus said he, being thus entered as I told you into a new captivity
(though far more nobly used) was constrained to attend the coming of the
commissioners of the Myssians to Sardis, for the further disposure of his
person and affairs: but in the interim the Soldiers, whether contrary to
their custom and vocation, reflecting principally upon the miseries and
afflictions of the King, or rather being willing to make that the ground or
pretentions for their future intentions, to quarrel with the Senate, about
their own discontents, in seeing the Myssians esteemed and themselves
neglected, not only by degrees began to use the King gently, but openly to
complain, that themselves were so far from receiving rewards for their
services, as that they had not been justly paid their wages: when as the
Myssians as they said, received great sums of money, for doing nothing else
but running away, and betraying their King: also they seemed exasperated, to
have them countenanced in setting up their manner of worship of the gods,
throughout all the Kingdom of Lydia, to the enslaving as was urged of the
Nation in the free liberty of their consciences; when as the people according
as had bin promised them, could not exercise their own manner of worship:
besides they seemed extremely to repine that Myssian governors should be
joined with those of Lydia it self, in the management of State affairs, that
belonged properly only to the Nation: neither did these discontented
discourses end in this manner; for they daily assembled in private Counsels, to
produce something for their advantages, though they yet knew not very well what
either to demand or act: however these proceedings were soon brought to the
knowledge of the Senate, who being jealous also of their own intentions, were a
great deal the more fearful of any dangerous accidents; so that presently,
they sent messengers to the Army, though as 'twas said with intentions to
persuade, yet with authority to command the Soldiers to a better obedience:
but as these officers were extremely deceived in their expectations,
concerning their own power and interest in the Camp, so were they forced with
expedition to return to those that sent them, with some terror in their
countenances; As this for many days, caused sometimes distracted Counsels,
otherwhiles more peremptory discourses, so was it not over long before the
Senate, was saluted with a declaration from the Soldiers, wherein they not
only taxed them, with want of justice and extreme ingratitude to the Army,
that had fought so many Battles, and shed so much blood for themselves and the
privileges of Lydia, but also presented their considerations with these
following proposals, wherein they wished to be speedily satisfied: first, that
they might with all expedition not only be paid their just dues, but in a
convenient time be farther rewarded according to their deserts: Secondly, that
no part of the Army should be disbanded without their own consents: Thirdly,
that such laws and decrees might presently be established, to assure the
people of Lydia of their convenient liberties; and Lastly, that the worship of
the gods according to the Myssian rights, might not be imposed absolutely upon
any person or condition: These demands being sent to the Senate by messengers
of their own, that before never expected to be contradicted, much less
circumscribed by any power whatsoever, began to think, that it would be now
their safest way, rather for the present to endeavor to temper the Soldiers
passions, then further either to tempt or hazard their fury; To this purpose
they returned back their messengers, with faithful or at leastwise fained
promises, that speedily they should receive satisfaction, according to their
hearts content: Nevertheless the Army finding after some weeks expectation,
that the Senate endeavored, rather to deceive their expectations by sowing
underhand and private factions among the Soldiers, then that they intended
really to perform in effect, any thing that was actually for their good, after
they had as it were chosen Farezius as their Captain General for their
privileges, as well as the Senate had chosen him for the Wars, not only
seized presently upon most of the Magazins of the Kingdom, but also sent some
Troops to take the King out of prison where he remained: Euarchus being a
little amazed at this new and sudden attempt, as he could not well interpret
their meaning, although it is probable he might like well enough of their
actions, so at the first, did he make some stand at their proceedings; yet at
last being persuaded of their fair intentions, and having of the other side
assured them of his affection, they instantly carried him in a certain kind
of triumph through most part of the Kingdom of Lydia, until at last they
lodged him in a brave Castle of his own, where he now remains (as it is
believed) with a great deal of satisfaction; And the rather, for that (it
being so given out) they do not only in an honorable manner, suffer him to
exercise his own rights concerning the worship of the gods, with a free
admittance of all companies to be entertalned, with what conversation he
pleases, but have lately envited him to send for the Queen and all his
children, who shall be as they say joyful witnesses of his being again
established in his Throne and dignity: and however they be something suspicious
of the practices of the Commissioners of Myssia, and those belonging to that
faction, least they might persuade the Kings heart from the interest of the
Soldiers, yet the better to give him satisfaction, concerning the opinion of
his own liberty; neither they or any else are debarred either from his presence
or communication; whilst of every side they have promised the common people a
happiness according to their expectations, both in their manner of worshipping
the gods, as well as belonging to all other privileges, that can possibly any
way appertain unto their future condition: which in truth I must tell you was
the only occasion of our assembly this day; Not only to thank the gods in the
general for this appearing happy change, but also a little to exercise their
ancient decorums in their rural sports, in regard they had been for some time
debarred from such sports, by the rigid severity of the Myssian customs; which
as I told you have been brought into Lydia, by the Priests and others of that
Nation, that at last was imposed upon the people, as an absolute injunction by
the authority of the Senate: This being what I can say for your satisfaction,
concerning the present affairs of the Kingdom, wherein I fear me I have too
much offended in the general by my long discourses, though upon the matter I
do not see how they could have been well omitted in any particular, so I hope
you will now give me leave to end. After that Narcissus had thanked him for the
pains he had taken, and the favor himself had received, (having past away
some time longer in other discourses upon the same subject) the Priest calling
his boy to take the lights, he conducted Narcissus into his chamber, where
after a while, with some Court-complements, he left him to take his rest,
promising in the morning to show him the Liberary, as one of the best
curiosities he could present him withal.

It was not very early the next morning, that the Priest interrupted Narcissus,
conceiving belike that his travel required something more then ordinary rest,
though in that he was much deceived; for he was not accustomed to let pass
much time, without thinking upon his dear Cloria: when he came into his
chamber, he invited him, according to his promise to the sight of his Library.
As in that place they turned over many books of diverse kinds, so beholding
amongst other things, Maps and Spheres of the world, they fell in diverse
discourses concerning the opinions of some in the Primitive age, that did not
believe there were any Antipodes; as also, others again, that thought the Sun
stood still, and the earth turned round; besides, a third sort of people which
would not believe, but that there was another world in the Moon. This gave
occasion to the old Priest to say, that as he would not much trouble his
thoughts with the disputation of those questions, since it could no way
concern either his present or future being, so was it an unanswerable argument
for the immortality of the soul, that the Sun being of so vast a greatness,
and of so excellent a clarity, no way to be know or imagined, of what matter it
was made of, could not in all reason but be created for a thing more worthy
then it self; and that not appearing in this world, of necessity it must be the
reasonable soul of man, and nothing else, which was at first ordained to be the
object of such an intention, in regard that only remaining here, pretends to
eternity, and so consequently more worthy then all other things. From this
discourse, they fell to a disputation about the privilege of Arms and
Learning, which of both ought to have the greater prerogative in peoples
esteem: Narcissus said, that as action was more Noble then contemplation, since
the one did but think what the other performed; so in probability arms was to
be preferred before letters, in that it created really the subject for the
others employment: besides, he said that action did not only nourish it self,
but gave life to other things, as namely History, the worlds looking-glass,
and times recorder: again, the undergoing of dangers and difficulties, as he
said, was a means to warm men's apprehensions, and desires with Noble flames;
whilst Learning, in a more obscure way, did but hold it the best honor it
could merit from posterity, to remember truly what other people did worthy of
commendation; however perhaps it self was only contented to lie drowned in a
certain kind of sensuality, pleased with an imagination, that coveted but to
know tho^ things perfectly, which it never intended at all to practice; since
the dignity of Crowns and Empires depended not upon the information of who
possessed them, but in having the free dispose of such glories themselves, for
the most part not to be compassed and enjoyed, but by active valor; when as
books did no otherwise then make relation of those passages, like Generals in
triumphant Chariots after the battle, showing to the people what was deserved
in the field; or rather representing an excellent Comedian, appareld in most
glorious attire, that plays to the life without wounds, the part of him that
acted nobly and dangerously against his enemy. Books I must confess, said he,
are commodious pictures, to teach present times by predecessors examples, what
men ought to do in their own persons; whereas by activity and arms, we are
put in possession of the honor it self: The one, as I may say, being only
the shadow, that may in some sort satisfy a soul not sufficiently knowing or
inflamed; like old people that repeat with delight their old stories in their
youth, when they have no more power or will to act to any purpose: whereas the
other continues us enjoying our own virtues, like a plentiful and flourishing
Harvest, producing variety of new fruit to the industrious Husbandman. He
further said, that Letters were only useful in seasons of quiet, whereas
arms could only secure and protect-learning at all times, to make it become
profitable, for that men's unruly and preposterous courses, and actions were to
be restrained and regulated, more by power then persivasion. This being said,
Narcissus with a gentle smile, gave the Priest also occasion to show his
reasons.

The Priest told him, as he hoped without offense he would give him leave to be
of a contrary opinion, however he honored sufficiently the profession of
arms, so with a courteous smile he began the question also in this manner:
although I will not deny, said he, but my self to have been a soldier in my
youth, yet I cannot but stand for the privilege of the pen, according to
reason and justice; wherefore as contemplation does not destroy the exercise of
the body, so of the other side, books render a man more capable to act with
advantage, without which attempts would not be much profitable, since man's life
is too little a space to learn sufficiently, what were best to be done in many
things: he said further, that Military discipline it self, could not subsist
to any prevailing purpose, without those rules and orders which were before
thought upon, and learned by method and instruction; for that it is not only
the running precipitately into hazzards and dangers, that ought to render a
person deservedly admired, though sometimes blindfold fortune, crown the
action or attempt with success; but rather when as by a knowing valor, we
have either prevented a mischief or procured a victory, deserves estimation: A
prudent and valiant General, said he, goes not so much into the field to
hazard and destroy, as to preserve and overcome; which certainly cannot be so
well effected, as by least slaughter, and most policy; or although Monarchies
and Countries are oftentimes conquered by force of arms and power, yet seldom
without stratagems and prudence can they be long and quietly enjoyed, for want
of good established laws to maintain them in peace and security; Wars he
affirmed resembled furious winds and storms that overthrow buildings, and
productions, but order and quiet like good builders or provident husbandmen,
make up again the breaches to fairness and commodity: even as a rough and
harsh hand may quickly disorder the strings of instruments for want of
sufficient skill, but it must be skillful Artists that makes them sound
delightful to the ear: A disorderly commonwealth said he, may sometimes
necessarily be chastized with the sword, as dangerous putrifactions, which are
to be cut away from the rest of the members, to save the whole body from
perishing; yet good and knowing government must be always applied as a s^lve
to render the rest again whole and sound: in conclusion, said the Priest, a
State or Kingdom may stand without War, but without learning it cannot
possibly subsist, since armies themselves that are esteemed the very
instruments of glorious acquisitions, must, to preserve their own being, much
more to purchase them considerable success, be obliged punctually to observe
those rules prescribed them in times of peace: To this discourse Narcissus only
replied, since he had so well defended learning by learning, he had no reason
any more to endeavor by the sharp lauguage of his tougue to destroy the
excellency of the subject.

These and the like discourses at last carrying them to dinner; which being
finished and the cloth taken away, of a sudden the Priest was whispered in the
ear by the little youth: Narcissus civilly removed from his place to give them
the more freedom of speaking: when he had done, the Priest told him that he
was sent for by one Creses, a young Nobleman of Lydia, unto whom he had been
formerly be^^olding, not only for the saving of his Library, but for many other
courtesies, during his being employed in the Senates service; who was just now
(being come out of Syria) arrived in the Town hard by, from whom he doubted
not as he said but to have some relations of consequence, to which purpose he
did intend to bring him along with him to supper: He farther informed him, that
he had formerly enjoined him to write the passages of these Times which gave
his studies some daily exercise: with this he took his leave of Narcissus;
wishing him to think upon what employment he pleased in the interim, either in
his gardens or amongst his books.

Narcissus after the Priest was gone, as he reflected upon Creses arrival, who
might bring news out of Syria as he hoped toward the establishing of Euarchus
in his Throne, by which consequence he doubted not, but the sooner to come to
the period of his own love, so of the other side'did he resolve, upon his
quitting suddenly the Priests house, to put himself under the command of the
revolted Army, not knowing which other way to do his sweet Princess any
considerable service; especially for that the King her father seemed now to be
only under the care and protection of the Soldiers: The next consideration
that came into his mind was, by what means be might with the least suspicion
provide himself with horse and arms to that purpose; since he d^rst not
discover his intention to the Priest, for fear of the more notice to be taken
of his quality and condition: The whole afternoon in a manner he spent in
these considerations, until the old Priest returned with Creses in his
company; who yet had not informed him of any news at all concerning his
Travels, by reason they had neither privacy or convenience, in regard of the
many visits and other complements they received from the Townsmen: As soon as
Creses entered the room, the Priest made him acquainted with Narcissus, who was
one as he said that belonged to the Country of Cyprus: whereupon Creses
replied, that as his person merited in outward appearance, the best respect
that could be given by all civil people of any Nation, so was he extreme
happy in the encounter, for that his Travels perhaps might furnish him with
something out of his own Country, if lately he had not heard from thence, of
some consequence: after that Narcissus had returned him a suitable complement,
both the Priest and himself seemed somewhat passionate to hear his relation,
which quickly carried them all three to a convenient feat in the garden, where
Creses without much circumstance used this discourse unto them, whilst their
supper was preparing in the kitchen in the interim.

As it is sufficiently known said he, how unfortunately the Princess Cloria
(after she was delivered out of the Castle by my self) was carried back again
to the Senate, by the Treason of certain Soldiers fled from the Bartell which
Prince Thyasmus lost to the Myssians, so will I only begin my relation from my
own quitting of Lydia upon that occasion: to which purpose you must know, that
it being my intention in the first place to visit our Queen Hyacinthia, to
inform her fully of all occurrences in Lydia, since I was rendered by reason
of that accident, altogether incapable of other services any way beneficial,
either to the Princess or her self; finding upon my arrival in the Island of
Cyprus, that the Queen was newly parted from thence, I had some leisure granted
me to be informed of the late strange news of that Island, which were
delivered me in this manner: the passages I am the more willing to relate for
the satisfaction of this stranger.

The Dukes daughter of that Country named Eretheria, one day walking by chance
by the Sea side with one attendant only, near a certain kind of religious
house where she was retired for her devotions, of a sudden casting down her
eyes toward the bottom of the rocks, she might see something lie, that
however so far off she could not perfectly distinguish; Nevertheless
continuing her looks fixed for some time upon the object, which she thought
according to the fancies of her imagination, not only to be a body that had
been cast up by the Sea, but that it also appeared to have some motion in it:
so that there being in that place certain steps cut in the stone, that
afforded convenience enough for descent, she resolved her self in person to
make the experiment, whereby the better to satisfy her curiosity: where being
arrived with her maid servant, she soon perceived a handsome young man lying
upon the sands, with a piece of round Timber under his body, as it were
infolded within one of his arms, whilst the other lay at some distance: This
prospect however it something startled her thoughts, with a little kind of
horror, yet her courage more prevailing then the natural feare-fulnesse of
her sex, as she approached nearer, the youth seemed to have some motion, and
this gave both her apprehension and charity a Subject as she thought to work
upon: wherefore presently sending her attendant to call some Fishermen at a
pretty distance that were mending their Nets, she caused them presently to
transport the youth to a small house by the water side, who in the interim
began to recover more and more life: To be short, within a while she applied so
many remedies with her fair hands to his distempers, that in a few days he
recovered from the greatest part of his danger, though not altogether out of
the troublesomenesse of his sickness; which kept him in his bed for a very
long season, though in a manner daily visited by the fair and charitable
Eretkeria; not yet having yielded an account to any of the accident by Sea,
that was the occasion of his being cast in that sort upon the shore: But
finding at last, that he not only had gained a competent strength for what
expression soever, but also that that faculty restored to him was at present
necessary to be used for his advantage, one day when Eretheria came according
to her custom to visit her sick patient, the room being freed by accident
from all company else, the youth to her no small amazement prosecuted this
discourse.

Alas sweet Eretheria said he, what serve these outward remedies you apply to
my weak body, when you leave my heart still subject to a dangerous and
painful disease? these words seemed so strange to the ears of the young Lady,
that with a certain kind of amazed look, she only entertained his expectation
for some time; but at last apprehending a few sparcles of love might proceed
from her frequent visitations, that hadin^boldned the youth to higher
ambitions, then any way his condition could merit, or she admit of, had drawn
from him these extravagant expressions; turning her countenance instantly into
a frown, she told him, she was of opinion that his distructed spirit, by reason
of his long sickness, had caused him to very ridiculous fancies instead of
using fitting respects: To which he suddenly replied; no, no, most dear
Eretheria, know that I am not mad by these new distempers, but long since
wounded by your bewitching beauty; so that as the guilt justly belonges unto
you, so ought you also to take upon you the blame: for you may be satisfied if
you please, that your patient is no other but your unfortunate servant Eumenes,
preserved as I may say miraculously from the rage and violence of the Seas
unkindnesse, to be more again tormented and endangered by your cruelty: This
was enough to have put Eretheria beyond all degrees of wonder and amazement,
since Hyacinthia our Queen had brought news of his and Prince Cassianus
miscarriage, as she had been informed by an unfortunate shipwreck in her
company: but when again she had computed inwardly in her mind the time of the
accident, and the finding of his body lying upon the sands, to agree punctually
together, it rendered her absolutely certain in her belief, that he was no
other then the right Eumenes: besides both his voice and countenance, though
much changed by reason of his sickness, at last lively came into her
apprehension: so that after she had a long time rested silent, as if her
consideration labored to digest her thoughts into a method, or rather seeming
to labor inwardly by the force of many passions, she at last broake out into
these expressions, wherein both her words and her tears were sufficient
witnesses of her extraordinary distemper: O you gods said she, must I be an
instrument to protect murder, under the pretense of using charity; much less
certainly ought it be imagined, that I should embrace such a love without my
fathers consent; who undoubtedly can never be pleased with an election of these
oppositions; And with that flew out of his chamber with some violence: This
gave Eumenes considerations sufficient employments, fince he was not only in
despair that Eretheria would never entertain his affections, but doubted
whether or no she might not deliver him up into the hands of justice: but
again reflecting upon the nobleness of her nature accompanied with so many
rare perfections, he could not believe so pure a whiteness of disposition like
the rich Ermin, would suffer it self to be defiled by any provocation to
false-hood: Nevertheless the grief to be left in that manner by the fair
Eretheria, as it were confounded in a vast Sea of confusion, when as before he
had raised his hopes to some pitch of probability, by reason of the
opportunities he enjoyed with those respects he had received from her after the
tilting, continued his distempers a long time upon him; which also became
extremely augmented, in regard that Eretheria absolutely forbore her accustomed
visits: that caused her belike in the interim, more closely to retire her self
amongst the holy Virgins, in the place where she then remained; either being
struck perhaps with the sensible feeling of the youths sufferings (withal a
little jealous of her own honor) or the more conveniently to avoid the
importunity of such suitors, that her father had proposed to her choice:
however not to detain me over long in the relation, or you in the hearing, by
laying open all the circumstances, that might appertain to so passionate a
story, Eumenes, after he was in a sort perfectly recovered of his sickness;
found means by a certain disguise he borrowed of a young Novice belonging to
the order, not only to procure admittance into the conversation of Eretheria
(who not being absolutely professed, he might the more conveniently do) but in a
short time after he had one day discovered himself to her knowledge, with
tears, sighs, and other services, obtained some kind of entertainment in her
favor: Nevertheless in the interim she conjured him, by all those affections
that he could expect from her condition, so to conceal his person from the
knowledge of any, that her father might never suspect either his pretentions,
or that he was living: Eumenes although he thought himself sufficiently
honored, that his beautiful Mistress, would in this manner allow him the
freedom of her chaste conversation, yet considering he was not much nearer his
journeyes end by the favor, then the Suns revolution, that did but rise and
set, to prosecute the one course without alteration, conceived himself to be
in a manner in the same predicament as tormented Tantalus; her permittance
being only remedies to keep his thoughts always in an appetite, without
tasting of that fruit which he so much coveted: however his hopes were
sufficiently encouraged to keep despair from seizing upon his soul: Thus I say
he continued enjoying though he never enjoyed, until the unexpected death of
the Duke her father, gave Eretheria full liberty (as she thought) to dispose of
her self without contradiction; At these words Narcissus began to grow pale,
in so much as the Priest asked him how he did? but he reflecting upon the
necessity of concealing himself, in regard of the Princess Clorias desires,
where as she only upon those conditions, was content to allow him her
conversation, and besides considering that the demonstration of any passions
could not again call his father to a new life, told them, that as a little
quame had something overcome his stomach so was he for the present pretty well
recovered: wherefore desired Creses, without any more interruption in his
behalf to prosecute his story, which made him quickly return to the matter in
this manner: Eretheria said he, being thus the absolute possessor of her own
liberty, as by descent the only heir to her fathers fortunes, fince her
brother Narcissus had miscarried unfortunately some time before at Sea, as was
generally conceived throughout the whole Island of Cyprus was presently
persuaded by the State of the Country, to make election of some Noble and
worthy husband, that might be capable to execute that charge and command, that
belonged formerly to the Duke her father; for that by reason of her sex, she
could not entirely of her self enjoy the office; being willing as they said,
if it were possible, to continue the jurisdiction in the same blood, in regard
of those extraordinary benefits the Island had received by the government of
the late Duke her father: As Eretheria could not but accept of these
propositions, that pretend to so much love to her self and family, after she
had returned them a grateful acceptance of their kindness, with all the
fitting expressions she could use to that purpose, within a very few days,
Eumenes was produced to the consideration of the people, as the person she most
defired to affect, which without any great opposition was approved of in the
general, as being a man who had not only borne a long affection to the
Princess, but upon all occasions had demonstrated a sufficient courage and
judgment, worthy of any employment: As in this manner he was created both
Prince and Governor at the same time, so I left the Island of Cyprus,
providing not only for the Nuptials of the young couple, but for the Funerals
of the old Duke: whilst my occasions and passions carried me after the Queen
Hyacinthia into Syria, being thither retired as I heard after the death of
Philostros, who during his life had absolutely obstructed her passage and
intention: where being no sooner arrived, but as the world had bin turned into
nothing but wonders, I found also Orsames dead, and his Queen newly brought
abed of two sons, which afforded the Kingdom of Syria an equal share both of
joy and sorrow: This notwithstanding so far protracted my designs, that as I
had but little convenience to present the State of our Lydian affairs to
Hyacinthia with all the particulars concerning the Princess Clorias fortunes,
so had she less hope her self to determine of any thing speedily, in regard
of the unsettlement of businesses and governments in Syria, by reason of those
new changes that had so lately happened: so that for some time I was constrained
to quit the City of Damascus, and to retire my self to a more private place of
habitation, finding at Court how unwilling they were to entertain any occasion
of charge and expense; the rather for that Prince Arethusius the Kings eldest
son, was only to be furnished out of his mothers pension and allowance: but
long I had not continued in my voluntary retirement, but sudden intelligence
was brought to Court, not only of the general revolt of the Senate of Lydias
Army from their service, but also that it was reported they had taken King
Euarchus out of Prison into the Soldiers protection: as this gave all our
thoughts, fresh hopes of something speedily to be acted for his good and
restoration, so am I at present sent to him with Letters from the Queen, though
to what effectual purpose I cannot tell, for that I find not only her self,
but the whole State of Syria to be extremely addicted to the Myssian interest,
which as I suppose the Army will never willingly consent unto, in regard they
have already so publicly and violently declared to the contrary; having made
it the chief occasion of the quarrel between them and the Senate, which in
effect is all I can say either of my journey or employment: Then turning
himself to the Priest he told him, that he must entreat his company to Court:
and this presently carried them all three to supper.

When they had ended, the Priest told Narcissus, that although he feared his
occasions would constrain him for the present to take a journey to Court,
whereby to have the happiness again to see his old master the King, and so by
consequence not to be longer in a capacity, to do him that farther service in
his own house he desired, yet he hoped they should have the honor of his
company along with them, where he durst undertake his reception should be
equal with either of theirs, in those contents they should receive by so
fortunate an occasion.

Narcissus after he had thanked him, as well for his past favors as his
present offers, assured him that as he could not but be extremely joyful at
the opportunity he should have by that voyage, again to behold his great
master in some probability of being restored to his ancient right and dignity,
so did he wish him unfainedly to believe, that notwithstanding he could most
willingly participate of his good luck in personally accompanying them to
Court, whereby to be an eye witness of their entertainments, yet such were his
pressing occasions (especially in regard of those accidents that had lately
happened in the Island of Cyprus) that he was obliged to make what have he could
possible into his own Country, where notwithstanding he should study what
requitals he should be any way able to perform in lieu of those civillities he
had received by his means in the Kingdom of Lydia: These complements with
other discourses continued them in communication, until the time of the night
caused them all to retire into their several lodgings: and the rather was the
have more necessary, for that the Priest was to make some convenient
preparation for the next days journey.

When Narcissus was come into his chamber, and being there only accompanied by
his solitary thoughts, instead of sleep he fell upon these melancholy
considerations: First it came into his mind, that he had not alone loft a
dear and loving father, whose wisdom would have been a continual support
unto him in all his difficult affairs, but by that unreparable loss, he was
also in danger to be deprived of the best part of his esteemed hereditary
honor, and command, by the marriage of his sister with Eumenes, since in his
room he was elected chief governor of the Country, in regard of the
general opinion was amongst the people of his death: yet again
notwithstanding this possession, he had some hopes by the affection of the
Inhabitants to be restored to his right, when they should by his personal
appearance, be made fully acquainted with the mistake of his death without
either blood or trouble, since as he doubted not of the natural affection of
his sister Eretheria, so would he not suspect the noble disposition of Eumenes:
but when he reflected upon the luster and sweetness of Crowns and Dignities,
being once enjoyed either by ambitious and high spirits, he conceived there
might be more difficulty in the attempt then ordinary, and so consequently an
occasion given of contention and slaughter, not possible to be ended between
them without destruction to one or other: besides he doubted for the present
which seemed most to trouble him, that these sudden changes, might so far
alienate the thoughts and affections of the Princess Cloria from his
parsicular, that she might be induced in the interim, to entertain the
addresses of Cassianus, that were most violently as he knew proposed to her
choice by the powerful Senate of Lydia; And as he imagined would be the sooner
entertained, in regard of the King her fathers present necessities, who by that
means might hope the easier to come to the possession of his rights,
especially when all opportunities were afforded, either for courtships or
solicitation; and probably could not long be resisted, by reason of her
constrained condition, that obliged her without prevention, to endure all
assaults and affronts to that purpose, that should from time to time be
attempted upon her person: As these last considerations most strugled inwardly
with his uncertain thoughts, not knowing well whether he should leave Lydia or
not, so did he begin to think, that there being no Army in the Field that was
in action, and not knowing how to be admitted to Clorias presence, it would be
too little purpose longer to continue in the Kingdom; and therefore resolved
presently to go for Cyprus; where he seemed not to doubt, but that the people
(if not Eumenes himself) finding him alive contrary to their expectation,
would soon be persuaded to reason in his behalf: And to this purpose being
settled in his fathers command, he should be not only able to bring assistance
to King Euarchus occasions, but also contribute much to his dangers
releasement; whereas the contrary would both confirm the opinion of his being
dead, and in some sort accuse himself of too much sloth in his own nature,
for not appearing activer in those concernments of his own that belonged so
exceedingly to his honor and welfare: with these resolutions h^^ quickly fell
asleep.

In the morning the old Priest came to Narcissus to take his leave with these
complements, that as he had hitherto been ashamed, that his own disability to
render him those services due to hi^ worth, had made him want he feared such
entertainment as was fitting in his poor habitation and much more since he was
now forced to leave him by the accidental journey, he was constrained to make
to Court in the company of Creses, so if he pleased to design any longer stay
in the Kingdom of Lydia, he should take it for some part of satisfaction to
his fortunes, that he would resolve to make use of his house in his absence, a
place should be always ready he assured him, to afford him the best
convenience it was able for his aboade: which he refusing with the like
complements, they both presently descended into the Hall, where they found
Creses ready prepared to take horse: After they had eat a bit or two, and
performed some other few ceremonies belonging to their departure, they quickly
mounted their Steads.

The Priest and Creses had not traveled many Furlongs together, ere they met
with a most even and direct path way; and that commodity as it should seem
invited them both to a new discourse, since the Priest seemed extremely
unsatisfied as yet, why the State of Syria, and much more the Queen Hyacinthia,
should be so unwilling to entertain a correspondency with the Army, that had
delivered the person of Euarchus out of Prison, though passionately desirous to
retain an interest with the Myssians, that had apparently betrayed him
thither, according to the common opinion almost of all Asia.

Father, said Creses, as I have already made unto you a relation of my voyage
into Cyprus, with some part of my proceedings in Syria, so having for the
present so fair an opportunity, I shall endeavor to let you know my thoughts,
in many other particulars that I have not yet mentioned: To this purpose you
must understand, that however the people of the Island of Crese, seem to
profess the same worship of the gods with the State of Syria, yet cannot they
obtain the free exercise of their religion, either from King Euarchus or his
Queen Hyacinthia: though Euarchus by the Court of Syria has been pressed not
only to sign all the chief articles of the Myssians, but also even to
subscribe to their tenants in matter of Doctrine, notwithstanding they be
altogether destructive to Kingly rule or the religion of Syria: As this gives
me not so much encouragement in my journey as I could wish, in regard the
Soldiers will not be willing to allow of any interest but their own, toward
the placing of the King again in his Throne, so the Commissioners of the
Myssians as I hear, are extremely busy about the Kings person, to the no
small coffeehouse of the army, that has him now under their jurisdiction:
the Queen when I parted from her at Damasers gave me express order, that
however I might complement with the Soldiers, and draw from them all the
advantages that possibly I could, tending to her husbands service, yet I must
be sure as she told me in the first place, to possess the Myssians with an
opinion, that Euarchus chief trust must still rest in their fidelities and
assistance, though he be forced for the present to comply with the Army, that
delivered him our of the hands of the Senate: but here I make no doubt but you
will ask me why the State of Syria, much less our Queen Hyacinthia, should be
so wedded to the Myssians particular? when as probably they can never be
brought, to be hearty in the Kings affairs, since not only in the beginning of
these times they opposed his authority, with all the craft and violence they
could possibly use, but at last as I may say delivered him betrayed and bound
hand and foot, into the hands of those that were esteemed by himself his
greatest enemies, when as he had chosen for his protection, rather the Myssian
Army then the Senate of Lydia: And this expression of ill nature and treachery,
was only to obtain the payment of a small sum of money, not to be valewed in
regard of a Kings ransom: so that I say it may be supposed, they have some
other hidden mystery in their thoughts against his prosperity, which perhaps
the State of Syria will never be able sufficiently to understand, whilst it be
too late to repair the Kings losses only procured by those people: for it is
well known, during the time they gave Euarchus the best hopes concerning their
affections and fidelity, they were then by their false instruments, contracting
with the Senate for his speedy imprisonment; a plain demonstration of their
harsh and cruel intentions toward his particular; for that when they most
betrayed him, they professed themselves then his faithfullest servants; as it
were smothering him in a bed of roses, and killing him with deceitful
language: whereas of the other side, these Soldiers that have not only the
Kings person, but his authority under their jurisdiction; and so by consequence
may either shorten his life or preserve his dignity, notwithstanding they have
heretofore always declared themselves mortal enemies to his interest, and
proceedings, as never having any dependency upon the Court or his affairs, yet
now appear to the outward view of the world, to be his greatest friends,
either being converted and altered in their opinions, or more compassionate and
just in their dispositions: which certainly cannot but extremely augment the
Kings obligations, if they perform any thing remarkable according to their
professions; but as I will not trouble you with my thoughts, what may be the
issue of their intentions or actions, so must I a little discourse unto you,
what may be the suppositions of the Syrian State, that seems so much to
countenance the Myssians before the Soldiers; and to say the plain truth do
more favor them then any other people, that have seemed most affectionate
toward the Kings interest.

First you may suppose, that they think the Myssians, not only in regard that
most of the gentry and Nobility, have either command or employment in the Army
or Wars of Syria, but the common people and inferior sort, have such a
dependency upon the Nation, by reason of certain privileges granted them time
out of mind, by way of a free Trade and commerce amongst them, that it is
unpossible for them to quit their interest, for any other benefit that can be
proposed to their consideration: And the rather for that the Court maintains
always some Ambassador or Agent in their Country, both to direct their
actions and designs, and to inform the State upon all occasions of their
proceedings; which joined with the large pentions are bestowed amongst their
rulers, and other eminent persons of Myssia, will prove as they believe
necessary ties and obligations to retain their fidelities constant to the
Syrian ends; And so consequently can they never attempt the destroying or
lessening of Monarchy, but as they shall direct and approve of: besides most of
the factions now prevailing against Euarchus authority in Myssia, are composed
either of Lords or Priests, who are most commonly not so envious to royalty (or
at leastwise as they may believe more to be persuaded by reason) then
extravagant people, that have learned no rules necessary to government and
order, by any manner of fitting education; wherefore not so much to be feared
in their courses and prevailing jurisdiction, if they should be suffered
something too much to prosper in either proceedings against their King:
Secondly, it cannot be doubted, but that Monarchy in the general, is a great
deal more conducing to the commodity of the Myssians, then a common
government, either in Lydia or Myssia; and therefore not probable they should
join in such a strict amity with the Senate, as absolutely to destroy the
prerogative, and Kingly jurisdiction of Euarchus, since by that conclusion,
they would neither be able to temper their own factions at home, amongst the
Nobility and persons of greatest quality, nor have any hope to receive benefit
from other Princes abroad in their occasions: and whereas many may be persuaded
to believe, that by agreeing in those designs, for the absolute overthrowing
of Monarchy in Lydia, they might in time come to be equal sharers in the
government of both Kingdoms; and so consequently participate alike in the
profit and gain, being the chief (if not the only) thing their covetous
dispositions look after, such thoughts are mere fancies and chymeras: for
certainly the Senate understanding well the poorness of the Country of Myssia,
and not being ignorant of the secret intentions of the people, withal how
insulting and encroaching they are in their natures; will be sure to take
order, they shall have no more interest in the affairs of Lydia, then is
entirely necessary for their own service and commodity: so that when the
Myssians shall find their aims to fail in these particulars, it is to be
imagined that they will not only be persuaded, upon the least endeavor of the
State of Syria, to fall off from the Lydian faction, but even to make a War
with that Nation it self, for the establishing again of their King in his
ancient glory and command; and to that effect adhere either to Syria or any
other Nation that may assist them in those proceedings: only this doubt in
some sort may be made, that Argilius and Lycius, who so unworthily have
betrayed the Kings person for a sum of money, will never by their good wills
trust themselves any more under his power, for fear of revenge answerable to
their deserts; And they being the most principal men of the Country, it is to
be suspected, they will have so great power and influence, over the actions and
determinations of the rest of the Inhabitans in the general, that they can
never be brought in any kind to own the Kings interest to purpose,
notwithstanding all the labor and industry of the Kingdom of Syria: But to
this I shall only make this answer, that however these people prevailed in the
Myssian Army for the selling of the Kings person, against the thoughts and
wills of many, yet that very action of theirs, has procured them since so much
hatred in their own Country, that it may very probably be believed by the State
of Syria, there must of necessity arise daily new factions amongst them,
neither want they intelligence at the present, that assures them that an Army
will suddenly march into Lydia from Myssia, in King Euarchus behalf: which
advertizement I suppose is sent, them by their Ambassador there remaining:
Last of all I may add that the Court of Syria may imagine, the Soldiers who
have now the King in their possession, having no other relation but to their
own wills and uncertain principles, will prove from time to time as inconstant
in their resolutions, as they have been heretofore desperate in their fortunes,
and be rather in the general inclinable to affect equality, then continue long
contented to be governed by Kingly authority, or to say the plain truth
willing to be under any jurisdiction whatsoever; witness their falling off
from their command both under the Senate and their old General: besides it is
esteemed a maxim among their tenants, to have scarce dependency upon any
power, neither in those things that belong to the gods worship, or concerning
other their humane actions, pretending by such constraint, an absolute freedom
cannot be enjoyed, either in mind or body; so that however the King may seem a
little to revive by their proceedings, yet I can assure you in Syria, there is
a great doubt made of the reality of their actions: but whether these opinions
be grounded, either upon the persuasions of the Myssians, or upon other more
solid though secret reasons, I will not take upon me at present to determine,
but rather shall expect, both with hope and patience the issue, in the interim
apply my self to my direction and commission, as well in keeping a
correspondency with the Soldiers as with the Myssians: by this time again the
way began to be something uneven, so that they could not well prosecure any
farther discourse.

At night they took up their lodging; not above half a days journey where
the King remained, and not much farther distant from the City of Sardis, where
encountering with a jovial companion master of the house, as appearing also
faithful to Euarchus in his intentions, after they had accommodated themselves
to their minds in their chambers, they desired their host with an equal
indifference to let them understand, as well the news that concerned the
proceedings of the Senate, as that which belonged more properly to the Army,
since as they said, they could not choose, but be of a nature something more
remarkable then ordinary, in regard of the late transactions of both parties,
which seemed at present to put most of the Kingdom to a kind of a vast
consideration concerning the issue: the rather were they curious of this
information, the better thereby to taste the inclinations of the people.

Truly gentlemen, said the Host, as I must not take upon me the understanding
of either of their proceedings and determinations, when as perhaps they are not
very well acquainted with their own intentions themselves, so shall I to supply
that defect inform you if you please, of those discourses that have lately
passed in the Senate, concerning the Kings government, notwithstanding the
Soldiers have him personally at the present under their jurisdiction; who to
say the plain truth, use him with that civility and respect, that it gives his
friends more then ordinary hopes, of his speedy restoration again to the
honor of his Crowns and Dignity; however the gods only know what the issue of
their determinations may be: some of the Senate would have no King at all,
pretending that it would be too miserable a condition for all sorts of people,
to be Subject both in their persons and estates to an entire Monarch, not
suffering them so much as to ask a reason concerning any thing that should be
done amiss, although their purses and pains were forced, upon all occasions
to pay for the honor, and the pride belonging to the dignity: whereas a common
government as they say, gives a certain kind of encouragement pleasing, in
some kind or other to all sorts of people, as having an appropriated share in
every action, that concerned the good or ill of the Commonwealth: others again
of a contrary spirit pretended, they are afraid, that if the government should
be absolutely changed to a popular State, though it might seem in outward
appearance, to have more freedom, it could not nevertheless but be of less
security, in that it would be always Subject to faction and confusions, in
regard of the inconstancy of dispositions, and therefore are rather of opinion,
that the government remain in the same nature as it does, with some necessary
restrictions to their King: A third sort made some doubt, how to find out
ways to limite a Monarch in any kind, by what laws soever could be
established to that purpose, it being almost impossible to take from a Prince
altogether the sword of Justice and power, and yet suffer him still to remain
in the condition of a governor; which in effect would be no other, then a
common government varnished over, with a glorious Title to no effect, leaving
the whole as subject to faction and confusion, as if there were no King at all;
in that he should want the authority, although he were honored with the name
necessary to that purpose: there were others that suddenly started up in the
Senate House, who imagined they had thought upon a way, to remedy all in
conveniences; which was to have only a King by election, either of Euarchus
family or some other: but the proposition was quickly answered with these
doubts: that if the Prince intended, should be elected out of the same blood,
if not according to the direct line of succession, it would endanger a new
slaughter and faction, through the whole Kingdom, by reason of several
ambitious interests; of the other side, if he were absolutely chosen out of
another family, as no doubt but there would be many opposers, in the very
election it self, so not possible to have any, of an extraction illustrious
enough, to warrant his kindred from being a burden to the Commonwealth in
their maintenance and support; which probably would prove a sufficient
inconvenience to the people; for that oftentimes justice would be sold, and
other oppressions committed, only to supply a needy and indigent family: in
conclusions, however many seemed willing again to restore Euarchus, and his
posterity to their ancient rights and dignity, yet fearing in regard of their
own proceedings, that they might be strictly called in question for their past
actians, they utterly desisted from that resolution: and notwithstanding these
several and violent discourses, for that time they settled upon no
determination whatsoever; only at last they ordered, the government should
remain as it was at present in the Senates power, though bearing still the
name of Euarchus, until farther consideration: I must tell you, as these were
the manner of disputations in the Councels at Sardis, both before and since the
revolt of the Army, so now by their favors as we suppose, they must ask leave
of the Soldiers, before they settle either a government in themselves, or take
it away from others; And the rather am I induced to this belief, for that the
common people, appear not yet much scandalized at the late revolt; but of the
contrary, as it is thought, would be extremely satisfied with again turn the
stream into its right course; however in that I shall say the least that may
be, until I be more instructed in the constitution of the world: with these
words he ended his discourse, and presently took his leave; pretending some
other company in his house, needed also another part of his entertainment.

This information of the Host, gave Creses and the Priest occasion, to fall
into a more serious disputation, concerning the nature and property of Monarchy
and other governments, according to diverse opinions and judgments, with the
several benefits and inconveniences belonging to them: The Priest would needs
take upon him the defense of the Kingly part; whilst Creses was to be content
with the more inferior degree: both notwithstanding grounding their
discourses, from the hopes they had, that the Soldiers would shortly again
restore Euarchus to his Crown and government: The Priest first began in this
manner:

As Monarchy in the general, said he, has been held by writers, to be the
best and most absolute way of government, so ought it as well be granted, that
a Prince by descent and inheritance, is the freest of all others from burden
and inconvenience to the people; since the making up of new families upon every
exchange, and the many dangerous factions would arise by reason of elections,
would at one time or other, either hazard or ruin the Commonwealth; for that
all ambitions, could never be suppressed totally in every person, with the only
consideration of the common safety: but that I may more particularly make good
my argument, I shall endeavor from certain principles of Divinity, nature,
and institution, to prove my affirmation and opinion: In the first place
according to the example of the divine providence, there is but one God that
made and now rules the heavens, since if there were more, none could be
absolute, much less omnipotent in any kind, and so consequently the
government, should still be subject to variation, both in part and in the
whole; for as diverse persons must have several wills, so that of necessity,
would confound commands and distract obedience, whereby executions, could not
choose but be protracted to the rending of all actions and endeavors, of no
considerable force and validity to the convenient and orderly rule of the
world: wherefore we see, subordinate offices are appointed in every degree, by
this great and all powerful God; every distinct orb being so involved one
within another, until they all become governed by the first motion, only to
avoid equality and confusion: so that we may easily perceive by that decorum,
that there is an entire necessity of one governor: As for example, there is
but one Sun that governes the day, as another light shines in the night,
neither of which being accompanied with any of equal authority or influence;
as it were both pretending, to a certain manner of absolute Monarchy in their
in their several kinds of motion and luster: in the second place, by the very
rules of nature we have experience, that some one in every species pretends
above the rest to dominion and jurisdiction: as for the purpose, the
industrious and painful Commonwealth of the Bees, have always one to go
before them, whose person and voice they only obey and follow, with a seeming
care and extraordinary obedience: The silly Ants in like manner, have their
Prince amongst them, who seems by his absolute authority, only to govern and
direct their labors, tending to unity and benefit in their small and innocent
Commonwealth: so that these being creatures no way given to exorbitancy of will
as men are, if it be necessary for them to have but one governor, much more
for us who are given in a manner to nothing but malice and pride, whereby to be
kept in order and regulated in our dispositions; which certainly cannot long
be without the authority of some single power, that must not be equalled or
contracted by any other: we see if two strange Balls be but turned loose
together in any pasture, their contention one with another never ends, whilst
one of the two have gained the absolute maslery over the other: with what
extraordinary hatred and malice will two little Cocks of the game, persecute
one another in blood and wounds, until the one of them have obtained the
victory by the others death and ruin? Ney example me if you can, any two Males
of any generous kind whatsoever, that will endure the others society, without
an absolute subjection to his power and courage; as it were never but striving
till one have procured the entire jurisdiction of the place; as if nature by no
means could admit of an equality in government; whereas of the contrary, the
Females, as being not at all ordained for rule and command, are seemingly
contented with the society, and company of their fellows: which shows in my
opinion a certain kind of necessity in all governments of one only Monarch,
not only to avoid faction and confusion, but to unite desires and industry,
toward the welfare and benefit of any Commonwealth; since without such a
known power and command, it is almost impossible, to bridle and keep in order
at all times, the unruly fancies and exorbitant desires of mankind: whose very
nature or inclination, does swell as it were with nothing but appetites of
contention: Lastly concerning the very institution of governments upon earth:
the first certainly was Monarchy; for as in the beginning a man in his own
private family, appeared to be the only absolute Prince to be obeyed, so
dominions and Kingdoms, became no other way established in the infancy of the
world, but by the uniting together of several houshols, either by accident or
conquest; And though sometimes people merely out of necessity, to keep
themselves the better in peace and quietness, were forced to choose and form
commonwealths, yet we scarce read of any juridiction to be enterteined (at
leastwise to be continued for any considerable space) but where one single
power chiefly if not absolutely commanded over the whole; as if the multitude
by the very light of nature, being led thereunto by the mere dictates of
reason, without any manner of science or experience, were constrained to
believe, that no other government, could be safe and lasting; however their
Lords not seldom proved the cruellest Tyrants could be imagined: as I cannot
deny, but by reason of the exorbitancy of pernicious, and wicked Princes, a
State has been changed from a private to a popular Commonwealth or
government; yet scarce did I ever hear of any, but that both began and ended
in Kingly authority; as being still by some accident or other, constrained to
that election or conversion, either in absolute power, or mixed representation,
as if some kind of necessity, required such an establishment to render it
lasting, and convenient to the people.

Nevertheless said Creses, it is a most miserable condition for the people, to
be in a continual subjection, under the power and command of either an
impotent or an exorbitant Prince; for though he should know what were best to
be done, yet his perverse nature and disposition, would not suffer him to put
it in execution. And if he knew not how to govern, he becomes led by the pride
and covetousness of others: Again, put the case government might fall into the
hands of a mad man or a fool, what remedy then could be expected, whereby the
people might in any kind have the least hope of redress? since by the Laws
and rules of inheritance, he were to continue still without prevention and
obstacle; which of necessity sometime or other would happen; and consequently
cast the government into the hands of such as he should choose, that probably
were not far from his own temper in any thing: in like manner, it must be the
same during the time of the Princes infancy, being by that means rendered
altogether incapable either of governing himself or others.

It Is true answered the Priest, the misfortune to a Kingdom is not small when
either of these happen: but however as no private interest can be so destroying
as general confusion, so can it not be but much safer for a Commonwealth, to
be under the jurisdiction of one vicious or impotent Prince (who it is likely
will be glutted by his excesses, or may be assisted in his Councels) then for
it to be wholly governed by many disagreeing heads, and factious dispositions,
that direct several ways in their intentions and consultations, which of
necessity must distract all profitable determinations, and at the best cannot
but protract, if not absolutely hinder those executions tending to peace and
prosperity; being scarce to be avoided in a common government, where opinions
and interests are several in the rulers: besides, it is well known that in
such Councels, secrets of the most highest nature (for that they are committed
to many) are subject to be revealed if not betrayed.

But according to my sense and belief said Creses, such a Magistracy might be
created out of the whole, that when good and necessary fundamental Laws were
agreed upon, might easily govern with secrecy and moderation to the benefit of
the people, who would be pleased sufficiently, in having the name of the
election of such Ministers.

If you mean said the Priest, that this jurisdiction should be eternal, it
were a great deal worse and more dangerous in matters of Tyranny and
injustice, then to be under one single Prince, by inheritance, since he might
dye, and by that means, his successor might again bring ease and remedy, but
the other assembly being once in the greater part corrupted, it were unpossible
ever to expect any redress at all; for that those that should happen to
succeed, would come to their places but one by one, and consequently could not
have voices in number sufficient to countervaile the opinions of the rest,
remaining in the Council or Magistracy: besides if any should have received
injury, or endured oppression by the casting voices of the whole assembly, to
whom should he fly for remedy and redress? since every one singly would put
off the blame from himself; pretending not to have authority and power
sufficient, without the generality of that congregation, to repair the injured
person; which seldom or never could be procured: whereas being wronged or
oppressed by a Prince, orany of his Officers or Ministers of State, it would be
no great difficulty, to make the particular complaint understood at one time or
another to himself; And more facile it would be a great deal, for the Monarch
or governor speedily to afford the remedy, either in that, that concerned his
own person, or belonging to any of his Commissioners; for else he should be
forced to take upon him the blame, before the face of all the world; whereas
the others actions, (that is to say concerning the particular) would be so
involved in the dark, that it were almost impossible to make it appear where
the fault lay but in the general assembly; who without an infinite labor
could not be brought to understand, much less to redress the grievance: And
if you mean this magistracy or supreme authority, should be only temporary,
and so consequently be made subject upon all occasions to the election and
questioning of the common people: what a world of inconveniences would it
bring? not only by continual factions and disorders, in the choosing these new
Magistrates, but in the very spite and heartburning, would be occasioned
thereby amongst the people, being carried on to this election, by a certain
conceived greatness in their own opinion, that might render their rude
ambitions extremely unsatisfied, if they should be at any time crossed in their
choice; with a thousand other inconveniences that I cannot mention.

Yet said Creses, alshough it should be granted, that in those particulars you
have mentioned, Monarchy were to be esteemed the most convenient government of
all others; however it cannot be denied, but that the common people are in that
slavery under such a jurisdiction, that they cannot possibly have hearts
sufficiently affectionately to render them entirely industrious, toward the
profit and good of the Commonwealth in the general, in regard that however
they toil and take pains in abundance, they can never attain to any places
of dignity or respect in the Kingdom, either to content their thoughts or
advance their esteem; whereas in a popular state, the meanest is in the same
capacity of preferment, as the highest borne person in he Country.

Although this be true said the Priest; yet the defect proceeds not from their
natural unhappiness, but from their disabillity or want of knowledge in
regard of their deficiency in education, which inconveniency and defect, they
will as well suffer in a popular government, as in a Kingly authority, since no
worthy person whatsoever is debarred from preferment in a Monarchy, if his
industry and parts can merit the honor and advancement; and although he should
in any kind miss of his expectation, yet it would not grieve him so much to
be under the jurisdiction of the Nobility, that are by birth and extraction
above his condition as to find himself much subordinate and inferior, to
those of his own rank and quallity: to be esteemed of all others most irksome
to humane nature: so that you see it is but mere fancy, that engenders these
considerations and opinions: besides there are other inconveniences and
omissions appertaining to a popular government; as for example, it seldom or
never preferres or rewards worthy persons according to their deserts and
merrits; when as for the most part smallest crimes and defects are punished by
most fearful and horrid severity; proceeding either from envy or jealousy,
which is the occasion that oftentimes, when Generals, Commanders, or States
men have procured a sufficient interest and esteem amongst all sorts of
people, whereby to be able to contend, doubting their own safeties from the
Magistracy, they enter presently into such rebellions that either turn the
Commonwealth into a Tyrannical Monarchy, or occasion at the best so much blood
and slaughter, that every Subject thereof has reason enough to fear his own
loss, if not general destruction; whereas a Prince being of so eminent a
condition himself, not to be equalled by any of what quallity soever, has no
cause to be envious or suspicious: again the Prince has a more near interest
in his Countries good then all his subjects besides by way of personal honor;
wherefore a greater benefit or loss attends him in every thing, that is acted,
since he creates not only the officer that commands or executes, but enjoyes
the profit or disprofit of the success, whereas the people in a Commonwealth
receive it but in the general, no one man being able to appropriate any
public action particularly to himself; which is a principal motive to enduce
the Prince to attend earnestly the prosperity of the government, because he may
be said truly to esteem it his own, which no other prison can do in what
constitution some ever, if there be others in equal authority with him; for to
join interests, will never take so much the fancy and opinion of the owners,
as those which are singly appertaining but to one only.

Well said Creses) although I see upon any terms you will needs have a
Monarchy, to be the best government, yet nevertheless I must not have a Prince
altogether unlimited, as it were threatening a kind of a fearful apprehension
of Tyranny to his people; by which means they would be hindered from
endeavoring industriously, either the common good or their private welfare:
but rather I should wish a king, in some sort bound by laws fundamental,
establtshed by a lawdable constitution at the first; however not to be so
strictly chayned up, that he were left no any power or prerogative at all,
without his Subjects leave, or be so let loose to his own will and pleasure,
that he might injure, and oppress his people as he list: that is to say, to
have the government to enjoy such a mixture in the whole, that the Subjects
might not be over-bold, to approach his presence without an awful reverence,
or he to be puffed up with a vain opinion (by reason of his dignity) that the
Kingdom or commonwealth was bestowed upon his condition, more for his own use
then the good of his people, nor I neither said the Priest: whereupon being
called away to supper they suddenly broake off the rest of their discourse.

The next day about noone they arrived at Court, or rather was it to be called
a camp, since the Soldiers seemed to bear all the sway, notwithstanding
others had a civil liberty allowed them, to be admitted upon every occasion
needful into the Kings presence.

When Euarchus was informed not only of their arrival, but that Creses had
brought him letters out of Syria from the Queen, he with a great deal of
passion sent presently for them into his presence: upon their entrance they
found him seated in a kind of a confined Majesty, Farezius being on his right
hand not far from his person, and a little below him stood one Hercrombrotus
his Lieutenant General, a man that seemed to carry not only design, but
policy in his countenance: about them, were placed many common soldiers in the
nature of a guard; however expressing more then ordinary freedom both in their
looks and demeanor: Creses after he had performed his wonted reverencies,
approached the King with a humility answerable to his Titles, though not his
condition; presenting him with the Queens letters, which Euarchus hastily
taking out of his hands read them with tears in his eyes, and then asked him
sundry questions both of his wife and son Prince Arethusius; wishing withal he
might once more have the happiness to enjoy their company in Lydia: whereunto
Creses soon replied, that he did not doubt but that the gods ere long, would to
that purpose be favorable to his pious intentions: Truly said the King turning
at the same time to Farezius, this brave commander, does give me more then
probable hopes to this effect: but Farezius made him no other answer, then by a
kind of humble bending of his body, seemed to intimate a willingness in any
thing to comply with his desires.

Having for some time thus discoursed together in public, the King (also
taking notice of the old Priest with more then ordinary affection) he led
Creses into an out window in the same room, that was sheltred from the view of
the common people, by large Curtains that reached to the ground, where after
they had continued for the space of an hour in private conference, the King
calling unto him Farezius used this language, with such a look, as might
procure compassion from the cruellest Tyrant in the world.

Farezius, said he, as I have sufficient experience of your civilities, since
it was my good fortune to be absolutely under your jurisdiction, so cannot I
but presume upon the continuance of these courtesies, finding your nature to be
both noble and constant: wherefore to this purpose I would have you know, that
it is not alone my own desire at this present, to have some comfort and
consolation by the sight and conversation of my children, kept so long from my
possession by the power of the Senate sitting at Sardis, but laso have received
conjurations by these Letters from my wise remaining in Syria, if it be
possible so far to procure my own information concerning their particulars,
that I may give her a true account both of their comportment and education,
whereby the better to satisfy her motherly affection, and natural
inclination: when the King had ended this supplication, so far (as I may say)
beneath his dignity, though consonant in some sort to his condition, Farezius
after a short pause returned him this answer.

Although I must confess your Majesty's desires, are grounded upon all the
principles both of nature and morallity, yet you must be pleased likewise to
know, that at present I find my own power and interest so far weakened in
Sardis, by the prevailing faction of the Myssians, that I dare not be over
confident of any request I shall make in your behalf; especially for that I am
neither assured to continue still the Senates General, or can procure those
Senators to be punished that with so much violence, exclaim howerly at that
attempt of ours concerning your releasement: but nevertheless if you please
that Creses now in communication with you, may be employed as a messenger to
demand these conditions, I shall procure him as large a commission as possibly
I can from the whole Army to that effect, and being denied by the Senate any of
our just desires, we may add your authority to the willingness of the
Soldiers to force them from the opposers: as these motions were quickly
embraced by the Kings apprehension and consent with many thankful expressions,
so Creses wanted neither courage nor loyalty to take upon him the execution to
the best advantage both for Euarchus service and the armies profit.

When Creses arrived at Sardis, and had with some eloquence and more judgment
delivered his message, being again retired for about half an hours space, he
received these answers to every particular from the Senate: first it was told
him that whereas it was desired, the Kings children might not only perform
their natural duty to their father by a speedy visit, but might also for some
confiderable time remain in his company and conversation (however they
conceived it against the rules of State policy to have any single person
pleasured before the public good) yet that Farezius should see how much they
valued his request, the Senate had determined the children might make a journey
to that effect, upon assurance given for their safe return after some few
days of salvation: again whereas the General seemed to desire a continuation
of his power and command under the Senates authority, they not only granted him
his own demand, but wished Creses to assure Farezius, that as they had never
any intention to out him of his office, contrary to his own consent, so would
they ever be most sensible of his brave and gallant services: but for the
proposition that concerned the accusation of some of their fellow Senators,
they conceived it a derogation to the high places they held in the
Commonwealth, to have them so much as suspected, much less to suffer them
brought as guilty Malefactors before another Tribunal then their own, being
persons (as they said) whom they had found most true and faithful to the
common interest: Nevertheless they condescended by way of persuasion, to cause
them voluntarily to leave the Kingdom for some small time, whereby the better
to allay the rage and discontents of the Soldiers, until they could be fully
satisfied in their endeavors and fidelities; these answers did but in part
give content to Creses expectation; especially for that the Senate seemed, not
only as he conceived, to put on a kind of more then ordinary insolency in
their demeanors, but withal did not so much as take any notice at all of
Euarchus dignity, or that they intended any of those respects for his sake.

Though Creses with a great deal of indignation had attended their
deliberations, yet he was content with some humility, to beg leave to visit the
Princess, which being obtained, he found her seated in a melancholy room,
that had no more light bestowed upon it, then what was merely necessary, for
the performance of those services due to her condition, her person being shut
up in a black Couch, so obscured with diverse Curtains, that scarce could her
rare beauty be otherwise discovered, then as the fair Moon, shaddowed by too
many black clouds; however, now and then as the Princess moved, there
appeared bright and gentile rays of those perfections, which could not be
altogether hid; in this manner being admitted to kiss her white hand, with
many sighs, and not a few tears, she asked of her fathers health, with some
other circumstances; but the uncompassionate guard would not suffer her to be
so punctual in her questions as she desired, until at last Creses was
separated again from her presence by those watchful spies, that had the
nearest custody of her person, who belike as guilty men, feared Treason in
their very looks, since no words were uttered but what they understood; so
that he was conducted to the Castle gate only by Roxana's ample complements,
instead of her Mistresses more full expressions.

But however the Senate had made these large promises during Creses his
presence; yet afterward upon other considerations, they not only denied the
Princess Cloria access to her father, being unwilling belike to hazard so
precious a Jewel out of their custody, but those Senators accused of Treason,
with the City of Sardis assistance, within a very few days beset the Senate
house with multitudes of their faction, not only denying to stand to the
former Orders of giving Farezius possession of the Castle of the Town; but also
professing, not to consent to their own banishment, alleging that the General
rather deserved to the punished as a Traitor; for having made so unjust and
insolent a demand, then themselves to be judged for any crime, and were not
only liberal in their language, but caused the Senate to disannul their
former Decrees.

The news of this enraged multitude was quickly brought unto the knowledge of
the whole Army, and so consequently to Farezius, who after he had for some
hours consulted with the rest of the Officers, resolved to march toward the
Walls of Sardis; where after a short siege, and no great slaughter, the proud
Inhabitants yielded absolutely to his mercy, whilst the chief Magistrates of
the City, issued out to give him friendly entertainment, finding he had the
greater party in the Town. In this manner, with a most magnificent Triumph,
they brought him to take possession of that command, that before with some
obstinacy they had refused, and afterward most ceremoniously conducted him to
the very Senate, in which place he was received with new honors.

Cloria having notice given her of the Generals intention, to visit her, began
to consider with what reception she should entertain his presence, since he
appeared to her thoughts not only one, who had lately conquered the whole
Kingdom by his prosperity; but seemed at the present to graspe the very fate of
her Father, and therefore believed she was not to receive him in her accustomed
sad posture, least he might interpret it either a contempt of his power, or a
sorrow for his fortune; so that she commanded her Chamber to be adorned with
Hangings of green Velvet, belonging to the Kings Wardrope, imbrodered with
compartments of gold, wherein was wrought the several armories of her
ancestors of both sides, divided by certain colors of rich cloth of Tissue,
interwoven with such variety of beautiful flowers, that it seemed the Princess
had placed her self in a delicious Garden, to give Farezius the more
delightful welcome; which was increased by her own sweet countenance, seated
upon a bed of the same Livery: though the inside differed in invention, however
it exceeded in curiosity, wherein with artificial needlework, was designed the
story of Venus and Adonis with that lively art, that the blushing anger
appeared in the boys cheeks, at the lascivious carriage of the Queen of Love,
whilst in other places he seemed to have put on a smiling countenance, that he
had broke from the forcible imbracements: but that which was admirably
expressed in death it self, accompanied with a lively sorrow, was the amazed
grief of the Goddess, when she beheld her slaughtered Servant, lying in his own
blood, torn with the rude Tusks of the salvage Boor, and his dejected
followers, seemingly confounded at the object: Nor was it little less
pitiful, to behold his poor Dogs here and there dispersed, as if also they
apprehended their own loss, by their Masters destruction. Over the Chimney was
a large Picture of most excellent workmanship, wherein was set forth the
banishment of proud Tarquin, by his enraged Subjects.

As soon as Farezius entered the room, he pawsed a while (being surprised with
an entire amazement) before he approached the Princess, as if he apprehended
some fear of sacrilege in attempting such an appearing deity; but being
invited by a gentle smile, that afforded not only a greater encouragement to
him, but added new grace, to her own beauty, he advanced with slow steps to
perform those reverences due to her dignity, which at last brought him to that
distance, that gave her convenience to ask him concerning her Fathers State;
in which demand she put on such a look, that showed she desired something
(though in works she begged nothing) that easily lay within his power to grant.
But the Gods seemed too cruel to make her a mendicant, whose perfections
deserved rather to have sufficient authority to command all hearts: However,
the General, as if at the present he understood little else but admiration,
for a long time answered not her questions, which gave occasion to Cloria again
to redouble her passion, with other interrogations upon the same subjects; so
that Farezius at last breaking through his amazement, told her that he was in
as prosperous a condition, as the unfortunate affairs of the Commonweal
would permit, wherein he had employed his best service with all loyalty.

This answer scarce gave satisfaction to the Princess, since she conceived
Farezius had designed his whole endeavors for the present establishment of the
King in his ancient dignity; and therefore turned away from his sight with a
few gentle tears in her fair eyes; which being perceived by the General, he
humbly besought her to put off all sadness from her heart, for that he did not
doubt, but prosperity would succeed to her Father, according to his merit, and
her own wishes; however the issue as he said, must be attended yet with some
patience, since first the Soldiers were to be paid, who had spilt their blood
freely for the liberty of their Country; and the common people in like manner
must be satisfied, that had hitherto paid for the purchase. But what the sweet
Cloria would have answered to this discourse could not be known, since Farezius
occasions called him suddenly away from her presence into the City, not so much
to receive those Triumphs prepared for his further entertainment, as to procure
money for his Army.

Though the General continued some violence against the rich Town of Sardis in
imprisoning their chief Officers, as also in causing those Senators which he
had formerly accused to be sent into banishment, yet the affairs of Euarchus
became no whit more amended, since he was not only still detained as a
Prisoner, though with something a greater liberty and freedom, but the Senate
was permitted to press his patience, with those former propositions they had
sent by A gyllius prejuditiall to his Crown, and in truth to the absolute
taking away of all his royal authority; which gave occasion of many discourses
amongst all sorts of people: some said that Farezius was in love with the
Princess Cloria, and by that means endeavored to force the Kings consent to
the marriage, whom he thought else could not be brought to yield to such
unequal Nuptials, much less would his Daughter be won to give up her person
to those disadvantages, who had been courted by all the great Princes of Asia,
with multitudes of glorious offers. Others again believed, the contrary faction
began to prevail, and had by some means either bribed Farezius to their party,
or outwitted his designs. Neither wanted there a third Company that imagined,
the people grew weary of their own sufferings, by reason of the Armies free
quarter, suspecting the Generals power and intentions only to make himself and
his Soldiers mighty, without looking upon their liberties and prosperity. For
a testimony of which as they supposed, the Nobility carried the chief sway in
the Senate House, contrary to their desires; however, certain Trybunes were
chosen in the Army, to prefer the rights of the ordinary Soldiers and common
people.

Whilst these thoughts, or rather fancies were tossed to and fro, almost in every
man's bosom; for that the whole affairs of the Kingdom were at a stand, and
Euarchus seemingly no nearer his enlargement then the first day he was
imprisoned; nay farther off in most opinions: Roxana one morning, according to
her custom (being troubled with more fears than ordinary; for that the
Princess her Mistress, appeared to her imagination, not a little concerned in
the business, since it was not improbable, some sparkles of love joined with
Farezius ambition, might be obstacles against the Kings prosperity) came to
entertain her self, within certain groves belonging to the Castle, which were
ordered into many delightful walks, that here and there crossed one another,
for the more convenience of the Company, that should frequent them for
recreation; where long she had not remained, disputing with her doubts and
hopes, but she met accidentally with Creses, who seemed to be there with the
same intention; they both appeared pleased at the encounter, whereupon Creses
quickly asked her after some short salutation, what she thought of the
strangeness of these times, so much changed contrary to both their
expectations, when as they looked rather for the King to have been royally
received in Sardis, then to have been still continued a prisoner, much less to
be pressed with new propositions, dishonorable to his person, and destructive
to his authority. Truly my Lord, answered Roxana, as my thoughts are in a Wood
about the actions of the times; so no doubt but some mystery waits up^ the
issue, however I must confess myfears outgoe my faith, in any good they mean the
Kings power, since both the delays used, and much more these Articles
presented, are no good Omens to Euarchus prosperity; but take off rather that
glory which Farezius should have obtained to himself, if he had made the Kings
restoration to his rights, his first and chiefest work, since by his power and
authority, the rest of the necessary affairs of the Kingdom, would in all
probability have been better and surer settled, when they should have carried
with them both Law and Justice. You are in the right Madam said Creses,
wherefore if I may not be thought over tedious to your patience, I will
discourse to you some things which I have not only heard from the Kings own
mouth, when I last waited upon him; but other observations I took when I was in
Syria, by which you may make what conjectures you please. So taking the old
woman by the hand, he led her to a little banqueting house, not far off for
the more privacy; where, after they were both seated, he made unto her this
Relation.

Madam said he, first you must understand, that Euarchus the King is opposed in
his just government, or rather legal authority, by four factions, that for the
present seek to undermine one another, all having absolutely in their hearts,
cast off their obedience to the Kings Person and Prerogative. The Senate
strives with violence to maintain that jurisdiction, it has extorted from him;
as the Mysians endeavor out of a high covetousness, to be shares in the
Government and Riches of this flourishing Kingdom. Neither wants the Army
pretentions, by reason of the service they have done in the late Wars, to
claim reward and subsistence. And last of all, the wealthy City of Sardis, in
regard it has for the most part furnished the Soudiers and Council with
money, requires to be made a free Town; that is to say, to depend upon no
subjection, but what Magistrates created by themselves shall prescribe. This
contention of all sides, is the chief occasion as it is thought, that makes
every thing at a stand, whilst in the mean time, the people seem to cry out,
being overburthened with oppressions and payments, which in the end certainly
cannot but turn to an absolute confusion, since there is scarce possibility
left to satisfy all parties: And thus much shall suffice for the common state
of things.

Now concerning the proceedings of Syria, which I have most from the Kings own
mouth, be pleased to understand, that when he was forced to assemble this great
Council, that has proved so unfortunate to his happiness, there was sent into
Lydia from Philostros an Ambassador, as Euarchus imagined for his consolation
and assistance, against the violent proceedings of his Senate; but presently
after his arrival, he was so far from complying with the Kings occasions, that
he kept a frequent correspondence, with those persons that seemed most to
oppose his authority; in so much, as the King was constrained at last with some
violence, not only to forbid him any longer attendance upon his person; but
earnestly to desire the State of Syria, to recall him home from all further
employment in Lydia, which settled the thoughts of Euarchus in some quietness,
whilst his own victories over his disobiendient subjects, and the death both of
Philostros and Orssames, gave the King more then probable hopes of a small and
happy success in his enterprise, which was again in a very short time, to
reduce all Lydia under his lawful jurisdiction: but belike the State of Syria
following the same maxims of government, under the young, son Orsames had left
behind him, contrary to all humane expectation, sent presently after the death
of Orsames another Ambassador to Euarchus, not only a new to invite him to
break the League which he still continued with the King of Egypt, but to
allow his contesting Senate to be a lawful and continued Council by his
absolute approbation; thinking belike, that it would better conduce to the
affairs of Syria, to have Euarchus power limited, then to suffer him to
remain in his high prerogative: but these demands the King most violently and
disdainfully refusing, the Ambassador not only with some seeming discontent
took his leave, but as it was thought invited the Myssians again into Lydia,
which has been as you know the reason of Euarchus overthrow, since the Senates
single power, had never probably prevailed against his fortune and success;
however, the business did not yet rest; for after the King had notwithstanding
strugled with infinite difficulties, to make good still his declining cause
(his son Arethusius Forces also being destroyed in many set Battles, who after
fled into Syria to the Queen his Mother) Euarchus was forced to put himself
under the protection of the Myssians Army; yet with so little benefit to his
affairs, that in a short time after he was delivered in person into his
enemies hands, who treated him with all manner of hardness, until the Army
took him violently from that jurisdiction: As this Madam, is the sad
particulars I can relate unto you, of the Kings misfortunes and captivity, so
may you very well make conjecture of the consequences.

Roxana after she had thanked him for his discourse, wherein as she said, he
had made her acquainted with some passages, she never understood before, yet he
should oblige her much more if he would be pleased to deliver his opinion, what
might be the intentions of the Syrian State, in thus desiring to lessen, or
rather to outward appearance to overthrow the Monarchy of Lydia, since the
example seemed of a dangerous consequence for its own government, for that
those Subjects might also fall upon the like pretenses.

Truly answered Creses, what I can say of that Theme is, that either they
think it more convenient for the glory of Syria, to reduce all Kingdoms but
their own, into Commonwealths, whereby theirs may appear to Asia the only
Empire: or they have an intention to make a conquest of ours, by reason of
those multitudes of divisions, they see arising amongst our selves; or perhaps,
they aim to set up Prince Arethusius in his fathers Kingdom, because he is of
the Syrian blood, whereby they believe they shall purchase both honor and
friendship.

But if I thought I should not prove over harsh in my unpollisht language,
whereby too much to injure your patience by my tedious relation, I would
discover yet a story, though acted long time since, that in my opinion, has
been the original of the sad effects of this last War: it will prove the
longer, in regard it touches the proceedings, not only of the Kingdom of
Lydia, but the Countries of Syria and Myssia, that formerly have been all three
interwoven in dangers, slaughters and civil broils, by the spightfull
proceedings, and factions maxims, of a certain Priest called Herenzius.

Roxana glad to entertain any convenience, that might instruct her farther, in
the Mysteries of these unlucky times, although many things she had read of
Herenzius violent spirit, told Creses, that as no language proceeding from his
lips, could prove tedious to any ear how ignorant soever; so did she not
doubt, but the consequence of the present affairs, required rather ample
stories, then short descriptions, which gave him a sufficient warrant to use
his own pleasure, both for the manner and matter of his discourse, until his
endeavors produced this following relation.

You must know said he, that this Priest Herenzius some years since, when all
the world seemed to yield obedience to the great Flamine of Delphos, as the
only Oracle upon earth to prescribe the manner of the worship of the gods,
suddenly started up in the Kingdom of Syria, who by reason of an ignominions
punishment he had undergone (as it was reported for a heinous offense committed
against humane and divine Laws) began violently to fall out with heaven and
earth; in so much as in the first place, he quarrelled with the form of the
service to the Gods then used; and in the latter, he denied Kings and Princes
obedience, or rather loyalty from their natural subjects; To this purpose to
execute his malice against all authority, because he had suffered by it; and
withal thinking again in some sort to recover his lost reputation, in doing
notable actions, how wicked soever, of a sudden flew to a certain Town upon
the confines of Arabia, whose people had newly, not only disobeyed their
Flamine but cast off their government to his authority, which quickly gave him
admittance, with his Doctrine, since they knew his opinions suited with their
designs; yet being rather friendly entertained, then perfectly established by
their welcome, his insolency and pride in a short time, banished him again
from the City, seeing he could not show temper in his first entrance; and so
remained until the fear of the inhabitants, of coming once more under their
old government, for that they understood their Prince prepared for a siege,
constrained them, not only a new to desire his company, whereby to be assisted
by his Council, but were forced to bind themselves by a solemn oath, to
submit absolutely their wills to his institutions: with these conditions he
became fully possessed of that power, that gave him opportunity, both to
govern as he pleased, and instruct as he listed, until he had fitted all
their thoughts, for the impressions of his designs by the eloquent language,
and cunning practices he used, which in a short time so prospered, that many
disciples were found of such towardly dispositions, instructed by his
principles, that he sent many of them also into other Countries, to poison the
peoples loyalties, since obedience is the most assured tie, that probably
warrants the safety and prosperity of Kingdoms. But these men having as I
said, taken their journeyes with these intentions, the first prevailing
progress they made, was in the Country of Myssia, where finding some
discontents already ingendring between the young Queen then reigning
grandmother to Euarchus: and some factious and ambitious Nobility, soon
introduced their new and dangerous opinions, into the hearts of the common
people, by which means the Lords became also so powerful by their assistance,
that the poor Princess in a short space, was forced to quit both her Kingdom
and Life, a Tragedy too pitiful now to be related, whilst the Rebels took
possession of her authority, from which usurpation proceeds Lydia's miseries,
since by a continuance of the same desires in those people toward her
posterity, they have now filled this Kingdom with tumults, troubles, and
blood, the better to make good their own jurisdictions so unlawfully purchased
in former times: but however, these opinions of deposing of Kings, and altering
the worship of the gods, prevailed entirely in Myssia, by reason of those
crafty and factious actors that Herezius had sent; yet his Doctrine found not
so ready acceptance in the Kingdom of Lydia, for that the Queen then reigning,
endeavored against the violence of all their endeavors, both to conserve
Monarchy, and maintain their Flamines, though the State altered many Tenants
in Doctrine, until the late agreements of each Nation to oppose Euarchus in
the same design, contrived an accord to extirpate in effect both King and
Flamines: This may pass my discourse to the Kingdom of Syria, that has not
only formerly borne part in the suffering, by reason of these opinions sowed in
the world, but has been a principal occasion to give the Myssians protection,
by whose power Euarchus has been chiefly destroyed.

To which purpose you must understand, that although Herezius other messengers,
could not so easily beat down the strong Walls of Monarchy, established by
so many ages in Syria, against the power of great Armies always kept in pay by
that Nation, yet oftentimes they filled the whole Kingdom with most lamentable
slaughters, to gain entrance for their opinions, and freedom for their
Doctrine; in so much as the Prince himself then governing, finding the Temples
overthrown, his Country spoiled, and his Subjects destroyed by the fury of
the contention, was forced at last, so far to give way to the Herezians
religion in Syria, that they had not only granted them, a free exercise of
their consciences throughout all his dominions, [but many fortified Towns were
delivered into their hands; wherein they put their own Garrisons, to secure
better this agreement, which both afforded him peace, and seemed to give them
satisfaction for the present: however, every year almost after notwithstanding
these benefits, produced new stirs by that faction, to the disquieting of the
Kingdom, that gave sufficient cause of vexation to many good Princes, since
they could not be assured of the loyalty of their obliged Subjects, nor of the
continuation of their own prosperities, when neither graces could win them by
reason of the spleen they bore to Monarchy, or power could compel them in
regard of those Forts they had in their custody.

But to be short, before the great and wise Favorite Philostros, durst take
upon him the huge work he intended, which was to suppress the gloriousness
of the Egyptian Empire, he imagined he could not be absolutely safe at home,
and so consequently not fitted for so large a conquest, as long as he should
leave behind him in his own bosom, so eminent a danger as those he esteemed
lawless Subjects in Orsames Kingdom, knowing they would upon all occasions,
be ready to join with foreign Forces, to overthrow their own Kings
government, and therefore resolved first, before he undertook any new design,
to subdue their power, to the absolute obedience of his great Masters
jurisdiction, as in times past it had been to some of his predecessors; to
which purpose he not only suddenly besieged the strongest Town they had in
Syria, but within a short space, left them never a Fort in the whole Kingdom,
that was not constrained to deliver up the Keys of its Gates, to the will and
pleasure of fortunate Orsames, who began to grow great in the opinion of the
world, by the conquest of his own Subjects, that were accustomed to give
sufficient employment to other Kings.

However, after that Philostros had made this speedy progress in glory, as
well as in security for his Masters apparent advantage, both in quietting his
Subjects at home, and terrifying his enemies abroad, which proved mighty
advantages for those designs he had contrived in his politic brain, because
it was not convenient, and scarce safe to continue desperate discontents in so
dangerous a body, that had vastly spread it self thorough most Countries in
Asia, whilst his thoughts and endeavors were otherwise to be employed; he
began by little and little, to smooth his brow toward that sect, and at last
not only assured them of his absolute forgetting all faults past, but made many
of them chief officers and commanders in that Army Orsames provided, to go
against the Egyptian Forces, wherein he crastily procured a double commodity
to his affairs, the one in winning a party he had good cause to suspect, and
the other in rendering them engaged in the quarrel, he intended against
Sorastros; besides he was most assured, that they would fight with spleen
against that religion by nature they most hated, since the Egyptians of all
others were held obsequious to the rights and ceremonies of Delphos, which also
was a means to bind the Myssians to the affairs of Syria, since no Nation or
people in Asia, professed more violently the same worship of the gods
introduced by Herenzius, and exercised by his followers in Orsames dominions,
which were not only reasons to tie Philostros to that sect, by all the favors
he could procure it in his own Country, whereby to make them serviceable in the
Wars, he had with Sorastros, but by that means gave countenance to the
Myssians against Euarchus their lawful Prince; which by consequence afforded
the Senate of Lydia convenience also to suppress his power, that they might
not seem to go less in jurisdiction in mastering their King, then those
people they had bought with their money, only to do them service, so that by
this means the Favorite gave work enough at home to Euarchus, that he should
not have the opportunity, although he might have the will to assist the King of
Egypt, which the policy of every Nation requires according to some opinions,
when a Prince is not able to make good his party against another prevailing
Monarch.

This Madam as I say, has been the fate of these mighty Kingdoms, only
troubled by the cunning industry of one factious and ambitious Priest, as if
the Gods had sent him into the world to let man see his own frailty; and the
rather for that Euarchus not many years ago, appeared so glorious and
fortunate in his government, crowned with a flourishing prosperity, in wife,
children, peace, and power, that he was not only the absolute envy of all Asia,
but seemed to carry in his hand the arbitration of the world; being now cast
down into so low, and I may call it miserable condition, by a little faction
of his own people, that he is not only denied to be a King, but deprived of the
comfort of all that ever was his, with an addition of a sharp and lasting
captivity, according to the discretion sometimes of his meanest Subjects;
whilst in the interim, honor, love, justice, and gratitude seem to be laid a
sleep in the deep Center of the earth, other Princes only watching to their own
preposterous spleen, not considering how soon it may be their fortunes, to fall
under the same Fate, for that all men naturally covet liberty; with these words
he rested silent with his arms acrosse, as if yet his imagination, went higher
then his tongue was able to express. This discourse gave the old woman also
some leisure to shed a few tears, in considering the Kings misfortunes,

But as he was proceeding farther, they were both interrupted by the sudden
arrival of the little dwarf, who told Roxana, that he had been a long time
searching her all over the Park, to inform her, that the Princess was newly
descended into the garden to take some recreation before dinner, and desired
earnestly her company, to impart something of consequence to her knowledge;
This gave Roxana no more opportunity, then civilly to thank Creses for those
informations he had given her, professing again she was instructed in many
things she had never heard before, that might afford light as she said, to her
comportment and conversation, since she was daily to dispute with some enemy or
other in Euarchus quarrel; and withal desired him he would be pleased, to put
on a resolution often to accompany her in that place, not only for her better
information, but for there Mistresses consolation, which you may be sure was a
tickling motive to invite Creses to the service, being persuaded, the Princess
should partake of his discourse; and love speaks the most effectual language,
though it want never so much probability to enjoy,

Roxana when she came into the Garden, she found the Princess retired into a
close walk, defended by interwoven branches of green leaves from the Suns
oppression, which also obscured her in some fort from the sight of her
attendants; so that the old woman had occasion given her by that retirement, to
believe new accidents had caused the solitude: Wherefore approaching at a
nearer distance, she might perceive a paper in Clorias hand, whilst she stood
still lifting up her fair eyes to the heavens, then again cast them down
upon the ground, and in this posture advanced two or three steps, with a kind
of a violent motion; this continued Roxana the longer before she discovered her
being there, until the Princess turning that way, she was necessarily invited
to present her self; however she had not come near her by a few paces, but
Cloria with a deep sigh, instead of other expressions, cast her the paper she
held, which the old woman presently reading, found it spoke this matter:

MAdam, As I should not for a long season, have omitted those services due to
your person by many visits, that my love and your virtues required, if the
distempers of these times, had not proved prohibitions beyond my ability to
resist, since I durst not contend with the power of the General, whose will I
found absolutely obeyed: so now having an unexpected occasion to give you
advertisement, I cannot again but present my dear affections to your sacred
self, hoping that my former love is not altogether out of your remembrance,
not only since the Senate begins anew to possess themselves of their ancient
authority, but that the King your father is lately fled from the protection of
the Army, though by whose means, or to what region cannot yet be learned by
any examination.

Your most humble Servant, and faithful Lover, CASSIANUS.


Roxana after she had read the Letter, stood still sometime in a Muse, until
at last passionately she broake out into these words: Truly Madam said she, las
I cannot but smile at the former part of the writing, so must I needs wonder at
the latter, since it seems as preposterous, Prince Cassianus should after a
long silenee, attempt your love, when he remained quiet during the Generals
supposed greatness, as it appears stranger to my thoughts, the King has now
removed his Quarters, when he was supposed secure in Farezius protection. But
alas said Cloria, I rather marvel whither my Father can possibly be fled to
purchase more hopes, for that all the Kingdom is probably out of his
jurisdiction; therefore I should be glad to flatter my self with some
opinions, that the design was undertaken upon good grounds. As I cannot
promise that answered Roxana, yet certainly the King being so wise, would never
have ventured upon such a dangerous attempt, without long consideration and
assured friends to conduct him to his journeyes end; but if I may rove
according to my wild imagination, either he is gone into Syria, since I cannot
believe he would any more trust his person with the Myssians, who have diverse
times deceived him; or is invited into Creet by his Subjects there in Arms
against the Senate, the better to make good their cause against the new Lydian
Forces, preparing to bring them speedily under subjection. The gods will be
done said the poor Princess, but I fear the worst; These discourses brought
them to the rest of the company in the Garden, to make them also sharers of the
unexpected news.

Roxana the next morning had scarce leisure given her to welcome the day, when
she was advertised by a messenger sent from Creses, that within two hours
space, he would attend her if she pleased, at the banqueting house amongst the
Woods, not only to finish out the rest of their discourse, but also to let her
know other passages worth her acceptance. The old Matron conceiving, it was
some intelligence more particular concerning the Kings departure, sent him
thanks, and promised with all diligence to wait upon the summons, which she
performed a pretty while before Creses arrival, that gave her opportunity to
examine her own imagination; but it was not long before she was interrupted by
his appearance, which with a few ceremonies seated them both together as the
day before, whilst Creses used this language.

Though I may suppose (said he) you have heard something of the Kings departure
from under the protection of the Army; yet perhaps you have not as yet been
informed of the reasons and particulars of his retirement; or rather I may call
it an escape, since he was persuaded it would be for his better safty: Roxana
confessing, she knew nothing of the manner much less the cause, though common
fame had brought the report to her ears; Creses gave her this farther account
of the passage, according to the relation he had from an officer entrusted in
the service as he said.

The King said he, being not only suspicious of the security of his person, by
reason of the many divisions of opinion in the Camp; some desiring a Prince,
others none; especially considering the diversity of humors amongst the common
Soldiers, who generally labored for an universal equality, as also being
credibly informed that unless he would presently condescend to those
propositions formerly sent unto him, with the addition of some privileges
demanded that were more destractive to his Crown and dignity, he should
infallibly be murdered, he was constrained to this sudden retirement; however
I must tell you these rumors were given out as 'twas believed, only to fright
him to seek another station, where he might be again imprisoned with some
color and better security, as pretending his intention was to escape out of
the Armies jurisdiction and power: so that the poor King finding causes enough
for a suspicion, acquainted two of his servants both with his fears and
intentions, who to be short, persuaded him to fly to an Island upon the borders
of Caria, where remains as governor a valiant commander, though formerly
employed by the Senate, yet at the present was conceived to be wholly at the
dispose of Farezius and the Army: this Captain they assured him would be
entirely faithful to his designs, though upon what grounds I can neither
inform you or satisfy my self, since the consequence proved otherwise: for
no sooner was the King arrived under his jurisdiction, but he entertained him
not only with a sad and sour countenance, but after he had secured his person
in the Castle, and sent away his two officers, he presently gave information to
the Senate of all the proceedings, desiring further directions in what manner
he should be treated; though he carries still in his demeanor, a kind of a
reverence to his dignity: all these passages as I told you before, I have from
one of those persons newly returned, that accompanied him in the journey, with
this advertizement also that before the Kings departure from the Camp, he left
in his chamber under his own hand, the reason of his fears and his escape: all
which Madam I may say is in such a mist, that no less a knowledge then some
divine Oracle can inform us concerning the certainty of the mystery: only we
may be confident that Euarchus has employment enough for his courage and
patience: At these words Roxana wept again with the very fence of the Kings
dangers and miseries: Nay said Creses, his suffering of all sides are so
extreme, that notwithstanding he has sent to Farezius and offered to accord
every difference and interest in the Kingdom, being heard; yet neither the
General nor Senate will entertain the motion, or allow him that privilege,
fearing belike he should speak too much reason to render his Subjects
satisfied, whereby they might be endangered to lose that authority which now
they possess without contradiction. But said Roxana, why do the common people
desire violently no King, since Euarchus shows such testimonies of his
goodness? Truly said Creses, as that opinion in the General is erroneous,
since all be not of that faction, so of the other side, there be too many that
wish an universal equality, not considering the confusion it would bring upon
the whole Kingdom, being as it were bewitched with an ignorant pride; for most
of them by such a parity, would be in more slavery then they are now, since
they could never be capable of any command, and necessarily must obey those
that would govern with more rigor, though elected from amongst themselves:
besides they are now so weary of the Senates rule in the same posture, having
had some experience of their managing affairs hitherto, that they believe
their own cure can proceed from nothing but desperate change, which is
incident to all distempered minds; since they that could not be well under
Euarchus peaceable government, wherein they enjoyed all wealth and prosperity
(though no doubt but there was some abuses) certainly now will not rest
satisfied when they shall feel nothing but want, oppression, and instability;
besides many fear that things are not yet at the worst, when so many contrary
interests with violence seem to contend. These discourses brought them both at
last in dispute; whether active valor, or passive courage were the greater
virtue, in that Euarchus seemed to possess them in a high kind. But Creses
who had a dainty wit, defended the latter with these arguments: first said he,
before we can well consider what has been the Kings sufferances, we must
rightly state his misfortunes, which will appear to be the greater, when it is
well known to the world, he has always showed courage in the Wars, by
ventaring boldly his person upon all occasions, as also eloquence and judgment
both by his Pen and language, when those faculties of Art and Nature were
thought necessary and useful; a plain demonstration that he wants not sense
and knowledge fully to apprehend his own oppressions: and the rather may it be
so thought, for that those who have most gained by his favors, the ungrateful
Myssians, with some others of his own Court, have been the chief Instruments,
or rather I may say the only cause that have deprived him not only of the
privilege of his royal Crown, but of all the personal happinesses he
enjoyed in his prosperity; besides his want of liberty now at last to make up
the full Catastrophe of his misery, none almost giving ear to his complaints,
or pitying his captivity: though they have separated him from his beloved
Queen, in whose beauty and virtues he took an unspeakable felicity, as also
the comfort of beholding his sweet children, being a real part of himself,
which the gods and nature have ordained to man as a humane right; accompanied
with the detention of his revenues that should maintain him and them: besides
prosecuting him with as many slanders as they can invent.

This Madam as it may be supposed, being the true condition of Euarchus
misfortune, it may easily be conjectured, his sufferings are equal, if not go
beyond example, and yet his noble heart holds out still to endure as you see,
what malice can invent without breaking; who notwithstanding offers love, mercy
and patience to his whole Kingdom and worst injurers: things being in this
postare I shall proceed to the making good of my promised argument; which is,
that passive courage is a greater virtue then active valor; if my discourses
do not seem too tedious for your more necessary employment.

As I must call the Kings constancy a noble fortitude, since he has neither
Subject of hope, nor object of diversion, so certainly is it the highest
magnanimity for a Prince to suffer patiently and without confusion from his own
Subjects that owe him duty and gratitude; for those men that hazard their
lives freely in desperate services, either aim at victory or conquest, by
which they intend to purchase gain or glory, which enflames their bloods with
continual agitation, that scarce gives leisure to reflect upon the dangers,
much less time for cold and apprehensive consideration; and yet we see such
have for the most part need of noise of drums and sound of Trumpets to waken
their courages, or lay asleep their fears, to continue them better in action,
whereas suffering has nothing to help or comfort it, since the mind is still
prepared to entertain the misery it sustaineth, with a pale expectation of the
same or worse, when as I say it is known it must be endured without hope,
having no diversion: like a person sick in the night, wanting objects of
variety, thinks that season longer and his torment greater by much then in the
day time; for where the mind is kept high by ambition to compass something it
coveteth, it has power enough in that interim to hold up the body from falling
to its proper center the earth, where naturally it inclines: but being without
comfort, if a man do not make strong use of his noble part his soul, to
maintain his courage and resolution, the suffering or captivating of flesh and
blood, will render a man quickly totally overcome, and that is the reason that
long and tedious persecutions have destroyed more competent spirits, then sharp
and violent tortures, since they were prepared for the one with expectation,
and only weared by the other with continuance. We know that old men strive more
greedily to preserve their lives that short time they are to live, then young
men in their most flourishing years; because diversity of prospects operates
so much in youth full bosoms, by reason of continual activity, tending that
way, that they have not leisure to settle their imaginations upon horrid
apprehension; when old people have so much time to think (wanting power of
action) that the object which is natural appears often before their eyes to
fright them, and so fares it with a person that only suffers, in comparison of
him that does both suffer and act together: wherefore that person has need of
a double courage, because there is nothing to accompany his thoughts of variety
or diversion; for certainly it pleases a man rather to contend for his life,
though he know he shall be deprived of it, then to lose it without any strife
at all; which seems to be the case of Euarchus, since they will not so much as
permit him with reason to dispute his rights, but force him unheard to deliver
up his Crown: and more grievous a great deal is his condition, in that he
appears to be left of all those friends that have been most obliged to his
goodness. What is the reason that a delinquent upon the Scaffold is accustomed
to have his eyes banded before the stroke of death, to take away from him the
apprehension of the blow which he knows he shall receive? When a valiant
Soldier in the Field without shadow will charge against a thousand weapons,
with as much certainty of destruction, but because the ones action frees him
from the others terror: All which show, that a sad expectation of an ill,
augments the suffering, when a diversion by employment of the body, or busying
the senses by diversity of objects, take away that apprehension that makes any
danger or misery excessively horrid; as for example, men for the most part are
put to torture in uncouth places, where there is nothing but silence, or low
whispers, to render the sufferer more sensible of the pain, by the quieting of
the imagination; and so it fares with such as pass through dark places, being
afraid of every small rustle, when in the day time, the same way perhaps is
pleasant; so that as I say without doubt, all smart, grief, and discontent is
increased by want of action and too much leisure for consideration; for I must
conclude, that it is a great deal easier for a person to dye fighting in the
Field, though he should be cut in sunder in a thousand pieces, then to endure a
long and tedious captivity, which is Euarchus present condition; in so much as
at last if he should in some sort yield to this cruelty, I must not find fault
with his courage, but if he gain the victory, I shall esteem him a miracle of
nature.

As I must not said Roxana, go about to disprove your arguments grounded upon
such reasons, and more delivered by the known authority of your excellent
judgment, so of the other side, I could wish the King had some Counsel to
assist him in these difficulties besides his own capacity and courage, since it
is impossible but humane nature at the length will be tired with over much
suffering, and by consequence fail for want of true information: there is no
contradiction of your opinion said Creses, but such is the crafty spite of
some, that they will permit none to be about the Kings person that dares
loyally afford him any profitable consolation, because they may the sooner
bring him to consent to their desires: Yet replied Roxana, it is not well known
what those desires are, since they never durst for all I could ever learn,
publicly declare their intentions, but do as it were in a dark mist endeavor
to possess the people, that the King refuses something he is obliged to grant
for the good of his Subjects; by which means they strive still to maintain
their credits and opinions amongst the common sort. It is so Madam said Creses;
however since you are fallen upon that point, I shall let you know, how far
the King has yet condiscended to their demands, whereby the better to
dispossess the People of that belief they are persuaded to have in the
Senates integrity, though I verily think, they now more fear their power,
then trust their intentions; for whereas not many days ago, they proposed to
Euarchus to have the power of the force of the Kingdom for twenty years both
by Sea and Land, the King has yielded to grant them that jurisdiction during
his life, though not for that term, which appears now to be the greatest
difference between them, since the Senate seems not content with this offer:
whereupon the Myssians have lately put our a furious declaration against the
Senate pressing the King to such unreasonable conditions: In good earnest
answered Roxana, I cannot tell, whether I have more cause to smile at the
seeming ridiculousnesse of these proceedings, or be amazed to see men grown so
foolishly unreasonable, since Euarchus appears to my understanding, to be
willing to part with more from his own hopes, then what the Senate requires;
for that if he grant the power of the Kingdom out of his hands during his
life, it gives more assurance to the Senate that he intends no more to reign,
if he had quitted his power for so many years only, since he might have some
thought to over live that prescribed term; again for the Myssians I wonder
most of all at their new loyalty to their Prince, when they have been as I may
say, the only cause that has made him no King, though now anew, they seem to
desire to re-establish him in his ancient authority, which certainly cannot be
but upon other designs of advantage to themselves, more then for Euarchus
prosperity.

Truly Madam said Creses, in the general it is as you say, but yet there are
so many mysteries hid under these proceedings, that they are capable to deceive
the sharpest judgment, if some light be not given by information: Wherefore
you must know that both Euarchus and the Senate know very well, that the
consequence of all the Affairs, chiefly depend upon the assurance of the
safety of the Kings person, since he cannever hope to be again re-established
in his rightful authority, but either by the humors and inconstancy of the
common people, who when they find the Kings absolute oppression brings no
prosperity to them, will probably become exasperated against the Senates
proceedings and power, or by an unreconcilable difference between the Senators
themselves, who may most command when they shall sinde no other jurisdiction to
oppose them: both which in all likelihood will conduce to the Kings benefit, if
he sit quiet sometime under his injuries, which I conceive to be the reason
that he has in outward appearance yielded so much to their demands. And for
the Myssians perhaps by this opposition they would persuade the world to a
belief of their integrities, as if at the first they cousented not to the
Kings hard usage, whereby to obtain a greater party, not only in the Kingdom
of Lydia, if they have an intention to dispute their own profit: but in other
Countries if they mean to make War upon our people, because they cannot be
sharers in the government as they hoped, the only cause certainly of the now
seeming quarrel; so that in my opinion Euarchus has done like a wise and
politic Prince, in seeming not to contend, where he was sure not to prevail,
especially since by the dispute, he might have endangered those hearts that
will now be of his side, if the occasion be offered, either out of pity to his
sufferings, or out of hate to the Senates government; And besides, it is to be
considered, that no act he shall pass in this condition of constraint, can
bind either himself or posterity by all humane and divine laws, if his Sword
ever become more powerful: in the mean time, the Senate will seek to preserve
the Kings life and person with their best care, since their own authority falls
entirely by his death, which as I say is the reason they desire more a term of
years in the continuation of their required government, then the determinable
fate of the Princes life, because they may have always the liberty to press
him to new conditions, if they find by experience they have notyet obtained
sufficient, since they shall not need to fear the vexations of his person, may
bring any hazard upon him.

I cannot deny said Roxana, but these reasons are sufficient to render me
wholly satisfied in my doubtful opinions, but the gods are only capable to
foresee the event of things. And with that looking upon the Sun, she perceived
the time of the day called her to the attendance of the Princess, which made
her for the present take her leave. Upon her arrival she found Cloria only
accompanied by her Late in a small withdrawing room belonging to her own
chamber, where none but her self had permission to be admitted: not long after
she had saluted the Princess, she discovered she had been weeping, by the red
circles about her eyes, that gave the old woman occasion further to be
inquisitive after her employment; until she spyed this complaining ditty lying
written before her upon the Table, that quickly gave her satisfaction of the
occasion, though her excellent voice and rare skill rendered the Music heavenly.

If Justice could some savor find,
Or were not rather truly blind;
Ambition sure durst never we are,
The spoils of such a virtue hear,
When every hour
Does need her power
To set both Crowns and Kingdoms free.
For love I see is but a flame
That only bears a constant name;
And is by interest as a wave,
Tossed here and there as others crave,
If objects seem
Of more esteem
To summon sense unto the call.
But whatsoever dwells more high,
Shoot but your Commets from the sky,
Against the hate that mortals bear,
To such as lawful Scepters wear,
And we will adore
For evermore
That action as a Diety.
Yet whilst that fate and pride contend,
Whether shall conquer at the end,
The Gods themselves have cause to fear;
A revolution of the Sphere,
And then like we
May Martyrs be
In the vast Chaos of the fall.
But the Princess after she had made an end of her Music, began with many
complaints and more sighs to blame absent Narcissus for his too much
negligence in his love, since in all this time of her last restraint he had not
found as she said some disguise to visit her person, though he might want the
power to procure her liberty; which she continued with a certain passion,
until Roxana not only chid her for those sad expressions, that as she told her
had destroyed in part the ravishing delight of her song, but seemed unjust in
accusing her servant, that had in so many dangerous adventures showed always
the entire constancy of his affection, who was no doubt at the present retired
into some region, where he might best advantage her service. However Cloria was
willing upon any hopes, to be satisfied with the proceedings of Narcissus, and
much more with his intentions; yet could she not but tell Roxana, that although
she was pleased to be his advocate that seemed to have a powerful persuasion
in her belief, yet were the loves she feared from Farezius, and the
importunities she expected of Cassianus, in her apprehension, arguments
sufficient to make her think Narcissus wanted much diligence, at leastwise
violence, that he did not endeavor to scale the very Walls where she remained
a prisoner, rather then to endure her to be so injured. Truly Madam answered
Roxana, as I cannot tell why you should expect miracles instead of services, so
have you no cause to doubt the importunities you mention, since I am not
certain Farezius love was ever presented to your liking: either from himself,
or any of his instruments; And for the Addresses of Cassianus, you have been
already so accustomed to refusals, that I conceive you have not any other hard
part to play then to continue the same course still. Besides, you may well
remember by Cassianus own Letter, that his affections are not so hot, as to
press you upon over great inconveniences; and therefore, in my opinion you may
very well quiet your thoughts concerning his courtships.

O Roxana said the Princess, you are much deceived in both these particulars,
for as to my knowledge (which I have understood since I saw you last) Farezius
has already intimated his desire to my father, whom you may be sure will
comply almost in any thing that concerns the General, So does Cassianus
labor the Senate underhand, to be propitious to his love, since as he says,
their own honors are engaged in the issue, for that the world takes notice of
their protestations, which are to see him established in a prosperous condition
both in power and affection: And the rather as he pretends for that they
formerly sent for him, according to their professions, to see them put in
execution. Roxana replied, as there be many reasons of sufficient force to make
me give way to your opinions, since your own beauty, honor, and virtues are
loadstones attractive enough to entangle all the world in an intricate
labyrinth of love and desire, notwithstanding what difficulties soever, yet it
cannot but seem most strange to my thoughts, that Farezius low condition,
though his fortune has been eminent, should aspire to such a supreme
excellency with any hope to enjoy. Hold your self content woman said the
Princess, there is no limitation of self-love and ambition, when they have
once taken possession of a proud heart, though covered with never so mean an
extraction; And you know that Farezius is a gentleman, which joined with his
former success in the Wars, and his present command now in the Army, cannot
want perswafions to make him attempt any enterprise for his own glory,
especially since the King seems merely to depend upon his assistance, or
allowance for his future prosperity; and being so, what counsel can you give
me either to prevent his violence or insiruct his passion, since I dare not be
too bold, in hazarding my fathers fortunes by provoking the Generals spleen by
a harsh and disdainefull denial.

In good sooth said Roxana, I am very glad to see, you have learned some temper
since you were in the possession of Osiris, where as you may remember, I had
much ado to persuade you to entertain reason, or continue you in patience,
wishing then, you had hazarded a thousand deaths rather then have dissembled
your love in any kind; but perhaps Narcissus is now farther from your
remembrance, though nearer your person. No by all the immortal gods answered
the sweet Princess, my affection is as pure and constant as it was in Osiris
Court, if not increased by the effects of more trials to render it absolutely
juditious, only the consideration of my fathers present captivity, and future
danger makes me so far willing to dispense with my own dear love, as to
mask it over with some hypocrisy, for his sake, which formerly I was
unwilling to purchase with the assurance of my own life, when I remained in the
City of Memphis; only the consideration of a necessarily jealousy in Narcissus
breast, when rumors shall bring such reports to his absent ears, I must
confess something deterres my resolution, from any dissimulation at all in
love, though no way prejudicially to his right or my own honor.

Indeed Madam said Roxana, I do not now only, begin to love you for your
wisdom, but will endeavor to put a project into your head, that may both keep
your father safe, and perhaps destroy your enemies, at leastwise it will
protract if not divert your violent prosecution; certainly governesse answered
the Princess, if you prove as good as your word, I shall esteem it the
greatest piece of service that ever your wits produced, since in my opinion, it
not only equals all others in benefit, for that the King as well as my self
is concerned in the business, but out goes the rest in difficulty, considering
how many powerful adversaries you have to deal withal. Well then said
Roxana, sit still and hear my propositions, and afterward prepare your self
without resistance to put them in execution, though never so much against your
appetite; if not return me such arguments as may convert my judgment as well
as satisfy your own fancy: Cloria told Roxana that her injunction was so
reasonable, that it was not to be contradicted by any that had common sense, or
was not desperate against their own good, promising withal to be punctual in
her obedience, as a principal duty she esteemed her self bound unto, in
regard of that charge she had had ever since her infancy over her, and then the
old woman began this discourse.

For these two Suitors said she, that seem likely to trouble your patience, and
the Kingdoms quiet, since the one commands the Army, as the other is possessed
of the hearts of the Senate, I make no doubt, but you may oppose their own
interest one against the other, if you can dissemblingly but entertain the
love of either; by which jealousy certainly there must needs rise discontents
and factions toward your safety and fathers advantage; for if you entertain
the addresses of Cassianus, the Soldiers will think their General
undervalued, who appears now to the public view to carry upon the point of
his Sword the absolute power and strength of the whole Kingdom; And if you
accept of Farezius Courtships, no doubt but the Senate will esteem their own
authorities dishonored, since they have proposed Prince Cassianus to be the
subject of their chief care: Besides, if Farezius should fail in any thing he
attempts, many of the common people would conceive with some violence, that the
Senate has an intention to cousen them o^t of those privileges, they have
been promised when their greatest patron shall be debarred of his own desires,
and if Cassianus should miss of what he has hitherto expected by the Senates
liberal offers, the Nobility might very well imagine, that the people and Army
endeavored to become their Masters, which would not be lessened by other
jealousies already growing between the two factions, since the Nobility does
not only with all the secret policy they can, seek to curb the insolency of
the common sort, who strive for nothing more, then to bring down all dignity to
an universal equallity, but the multitude have already so far declared their
dislike of the Lords proceedings, that publicly they have required to have the
authority of their jurisdiction taken away, and made liable to the peoples
allowance, who now enjoy their privileges by inheritance from their Ancestors,
purchased either by their own merits, or the Princes grace. And last of all,
though the factions of the two Rivalls should not inflame at the particular
disgrace of either Cassianus or Farezins, yet certainly their own Swords in a
private combat would be very likely to decide the quarrel, which would give
you a fair pretense to refuse the Survivor that should covet to embrace you
with hands imbrued in blood.

Governesse answered the Princess, although I should be very glad to be an
occasion to raise any faction for my own present advantage, and my fathers
future prosperity, yet I cannot deny but I am most extreme sorry to hear of
new troubles, whereby the Kingdom should be engaged in more slaughters. You
are very pitiful replied Roxana, but I pray consider, whether it be not
better to procure the discomposure of those that have sought all this time by
their authority to establish another government, destructive to Monarchy,
whereby of necessity a general confusion must follow, for that it is not
probable so many interests can be satisfied, or give occasion to prepare Lydia
for the conquest of foreign Forces, since it is impossible your fathers many
children would be content to sit down quietly with the perpetual loss of
their own Birthrights extorted from the King by his unruly Subjects, during
their minorities, and able enough certainly they will be to contend for their
dues, seeing all the Princes of Asia are interessed as well in the example as
in their blood. No, no Madam said she, rather dispense with your unprofitable
commiseration then be careless of future safety, for it will be much better
now to destroy these unlawful designs by a little civil Wars amongst
themselves, that would but parge the Kingdom of its corrupt humors, engendered
by excess in pride and prosperity, then in the times to come to expose all
conditions to a perpetual slavery, under a Tyrannical government, gained by
the power of lawless Soldiers, brought in by other Princes not acquainted
with the natures of our people, much less sensible of their sufferings, since
they will only consider their faults past, and not look upon their miseries
present, for they would rather judge them by the manner of subjection of their
own Country, then by the sweetness of the Lydian Laws: Wherefore I say you
must think, whether of the two Saitors you will make the object of your
choice, to render the other jealous of his actions and your favors, whereby
some sudden difference may arise between the factions to bring the sooner
confusion into the Kingdom, which certainly is the readiest way again to
establish your father in his right, since the noise of foreign power at
present, will not only be an occasion the better to unite them together to the
Kings disadvantage, but at the best, hazard the destruction of all property and
government, since the Sword will be the principal Arbitrator of every man's
right, and the victory a change of his condition.

Truly Roxana said the Princess, as I cannot in my own reason esteem your
discourse apocryphal, so of the other side, you cannot deny, but that I have
been ever willing in all my necessities to follow your Counsel, and therefore
since you have prescribed the Law; certainly the election will be easy; for
considering that Farezius has not yet publicly pretended to my love, at
leastwise by any expressions to my self, me thinks it would appear some
injustice for me to refuse Cassianus Courtships, who has already as you know a
kind of an engagement from my own mouth concerning the old Flamine, though he
be since destroyed: besides his blood, Titles, and condition, more suite with
my honor and professions, in which the Nobility of the Kingdom will have the
greater share, whose dignities certainly if it were not for particular ends,
would preserve Monarchy; whereas the people and common Soldiers endeavor
nothing more then to destroy it from the face of the earth.

Why then Princess said Roxana, if you be so resolved, I must give you your
lesson; but first I will tell you of a third Suitor, who also as best deserving
must have some employment, and that is Creses; one whose affection might merit
a requital with your love, if your other engagements, and his own
disproportion were not obstacles beyond removal: however, it is your part to
trust his fidelity, and reward his trust, especially since his endeavors may
bring you advantage as well as himself preferment. Wherefore I will design
him to this office though he be not yet privy to my intentions, which is
presently to make a Journey into Syria, where the Queen your Mother, and the
Prince your brother both remain, to expect the pleasure of that State
concerning your fathers affairs, by which means he shall more particularly be
able to inform them concerning the Mystery of your resolutions that may render
the assistance they shall be willing to lend more advantageable, and the rather
for that I understand the Country of Syria, still entertaines an Ambassador
with the Myssians, whose force certainly will conduce much to our projects, if
they can be made faithful to Euarchus good, since the least power will
infinitely strengthen the faction that shall show it self for the King or his
son; and in the Journey I intend Creses shall visit the Cretans see whether
they may also be wrought to Join with our party here at home, which is not
improbable, since peace and settlement in Lydia will be an overthrow to their
prosperities, for that those people by this Kingdom are esteemed no other then
pernitions rebels: And let Creses alone to act his part when he is
sufficiently informed of our desires, whose sharp wit and excellent language,
cannot be equalled by any messenger can be sent, which are fortunate properties
to our purpose; besides his entire love to your sacred self, will be always
sure to continue him absolutely faithful, which afterward must be rewarded,
either by your fathers fortunes, or the Queens interest in Syria.

Without doubt Governesse said Cloria, you have hit upon a right plot, and the
rather for that I hear by a late edict sent from the Senate (as it should
seem upon the Kings flight) they have not only banished out of the City of
Sardis, all my fathers friends in general, but Creses in particular, as
conceiving him extraordinarily interessed in the Kings counsel and affairs,
for that he brought as you know to the Senate the first propositions of his and
the Armies desires.

Then Madam said Roxana, your next work must be, anew to invite Prince
Cassianus, by some hopes of your acceptance of his offered Love, which may
conveniently be grounded upon the late Letter he sent you, that you have not
yet answered, as also upon your discourse to him, when he showed both affection
and diligence in saving the old Flamines life at your request, in which service
you expressed so much liking to his person and virtues, that you professed him the
next person in your thoughts to Narcissus engagement, whom he will not be
persuaded is living: and I shall be very glad still to continue him in that
enrour, until the designs we have in hand may happily be brought to some
fortunate Issue, by which means Farezius may be spoiled of the peoples
affections, and bereaved of the power of the Army, that now seems to carry him
up beyond all other authorities, and so consequently enflames his thoughts
above opposition, in what he shall propose, much less wish; though truly for
my part I believe, he has a strong faction against him, not only by the
Nobility by reason of Dimogoras disgrace, and many of the chief Senators
fearing their own power, but also in diverse Provinces where he has so long a
space quartered his Soldiers without removal, though their own desires in
taking away the power from the Lords and destroying the Kings regality, yet
hinders them from complaining.

Well, well said Cloria, as we must leave time to discover these hidden
mysteries, so will I address my self to put in execution what your wisdom
has prescribed, and to that purpose must enjoin you to remain here in my
absence, until an hours space give you releasement; in which interim I shall
endeavor to contrive a Letter to Cassianus (in answer to his he sent me the
other day) convenient for our design. But scarce had the Princess remained in
her private Cabinet the time limited by her words, but she brought forth a
Letter imprinted in a fair character, but written by a much fairer hand, which
she giving to Roxana to read, it spoke this language.

COusin,
Although I can no way doubt of your affection, by reason of so many
protestations you have made upon all occasions, able to convert any misbeliever
from the strongest opinion to the contrary, since otherwise honor as well as
religion, should extremely suffer by so much falsehood; yet whether that love
or no be of so noble a quality as to merit my regard, is scarce a question,
when you dare not before the face of any enemy, own these professions you have
so often uttered: Alas, alas Cassianus, to what a miserable condition am I
brought, when he that my heart would pleasure, is afraid to receive the favor,
because he that I have no will to love, is pleased to be angry? What dazeling
beams proceeding from Farezius greatness, have power to captivate the soul
of so Illustrious a Prince, whose ancient blood has filled the veins of all
the mighty houses in Asia with luster and renown? If I be grown less in
virtue then I was, when you first made those large tenders, you ought to
express wherein, that I might desend my reputation; but if your inconstancy
proceed from fancy, or want of courage, you cannot expect I should remain the
same,

CLORIA.


When Roxana had read the Letter, she told the Princess, that as she did
approve the manner of her writing, since it wanted not force to stir up the
coldest courage to that violence which was necessary for their purpose, so did
it not give much advantage for future engagement; but however Cloria was not
able to hear her words without letting fall a few gentle Tears, not only to
show, that her heart consented not to the hypocrisy, but her soul melted at
the remembrance of her absent love, though she meant no way to prejudice his
interest; and in this sorrowful posture, gave her governesse commission to
send away the paper; whilst she her self quickly retired into her own chamber,
at leastwise to content her thoughts with those hopes she had been persuaded to
entertain by Roxana's discourse, though not many days did she spend in
diversity of contemplations, before she received this answer from Cassianus,

MOst admirable Princess,
as I cannot but confirm my former protestations by a thousand other new
oaths, not only to re-assure you of my fidelity in those pure affections I
firsi offered upon the Al^ar of my heart to your sacred perfections, but must
conjure your belief by all the powerful spells of honor and justice, to be
confident that neither the fear of Farezius greatness, or doubt of my own
safety, could give the occasion to lessen those respects so justly due from my
love to your worth, since I not only hold the Generals person of too low a
consideration for my thoughts, which are always employed upon that high
subject your excellent self, but my life to be of too small a value to be lost
in any thing that can possibly be named your concernment. No dear Madam, it
was nothing less then the horror my imagination apprehended to suspect your
unvaluable person might be in some danger by the unjust jealousy of the pround
Generals fears, to see you adored by any interest, and withal no small
doubt, least your royal fathers rights might again be restrained by his rage,
when he should perceive a foreign Prince of his own blood, began new
addresses without his leave to any of his posterity, since I believed Farezius
aymed'a lone at the honor to do the King justice: but now finding he has not
only changed the opinion with his fortune; but that I have a releasement by
the powerful warrant of your pen, the gods shall not withold my sury from
performing those services wherein I will esteem death a purchase, if the fair
Cloria do but own the Sacrifice of offered

CASSIANUS.


The Princess could not choose but read this Letter with a little kind of
trembling, as if she feared what she did not doubt, since the worst she was to
expect, as she thought from Cassianus, was to comply with her desire; but it is
the nature of all passion, to produce new violences, whether in those things we
wish or others we would not have. And so it fared with sweet Cloria, who in a
manner dreaded what she had designed to be, because it came. But after a lovely
smile had taken possession of that countenance, that for a while put on some
distraction, she told her governesse, that although their plot in all appearance
had thus far well succeeded, since she perceived her Cousin was won to be
sufliciently valiant; yet she made some question how she was to entertain his
presence, when he should make his addresses; for if she should as she said,
give him but ordinary welcome, he might again fall back from his seeming fury
against Farezius; and if too well, he might expect some greater engagement then
was convenient for her to grant. Truly Madam answered Roxana, make no scruple
to let him have as much as you can spare upon the old score, since my Lord
Narcissus appearance at any time, will absolutely blot outthe obligation, which
you know were the first conditions you treated upon in saving the old Flamines
life. I but said Cloria, I should be very sorry any suspected testimony did
remain, that so much as intimated my thoughts could ever be persuaded to
another choice. In good sooth said the old woman; your conscience is so tender
in matters of love, that I believe when you are married to your servant, you
will make a doubt, whether he be the same man or no, and by that means call
your affection in question to the raising of some desperate jealousy between
you. At these words the Princess smiled, but was prevented in her reply, by
the information she received, that her dinner waited her pleasure.

It was not long after this discourse before Cassianus himself in person came
into the Princess Lodgings, not only in confirmation of the truth of his
Letter he had sent, but as it were according to his profession to obraide
Farezius suspected, if not pretended love, although Cloria for that present,
was so busied by reason of some employment in her chamber with her maid
servants, that Roxana was constrained with some complements not only to give
him entertainment, but to make her Mistresses excuse, which at last seated them
both in a withdrawing room belonging to the Princesses lodgings, and that
conveniences drew on many discourses; amongst which Cassianus was persuaded by
the old woman's desires, to relate the passages of his own fortunes, with the
rest of the Princes of Armenia, pretended to be injured by the usurped power of
Artaxes their great King, which he delivered in this manner, as a greater
motive by Roxana's means to persuade Clorias affections.

You must know said he, that after the valiant King of Scythia had lost his
life in the Armenian Wars in defense of the Princes rights, who were esteemed
oppressed by Artaxes power, a story most sufficiently known to all, my self
came into Lydia to demand assistance of Euarchus my Uncle, to recover again my
conquered Country of Iberia, detained from me by Tigranes Duke of Colchis.
Orsames also at the same time began his Wars against our oppressor with the
same pretentions, since Philostros his powerful Favorite judged it a work
full of piety and justice, however he knew there would be much blood spilt in
the quarrel, since as his master was mighty, Artaxes was obstinate, and both
ambitious; And to this purpose, not only prosecuted his design with much
violence against the King of Armenia, but in a short time Orsames gained many
Countries, so that at last, he brought Artaxes to be willing to accept, if not
to demand a public Treaty; whereby as it was pretended, Asia again might be
reduced to its former happy condition, by the effects of a general peace,
since the discomposure of such mighty interests, seemed to threaten the whole
world with a fatal destruction; and to this effect, all the injured Princes
were called to show forth their accustomed privileges, in a City upon the
Confines of Syria and Armenia, which was a place chosen as most indifferent for
that effect: where their Commissioners then meeting, and yet remaining with
more disputes, then hopes of agreements, gave occasion to the Senate of Lydia,
to invite me to fly to their protection, as well for present subsistence, as
future hopes, since it appeared these two powerful Kings, only beheld their
own ambitions as the chief object of their considerations, though they pretend
a more charitable intention in their actions. But my Lord said Roxana, as I do
not desire to trouble my thoughts with the rights of other Princes that have
little relation to our affairs, but as they may concern your particular, so
in regard they may prove over tedious for our intended discourse, since the
Princess her self will be likely to surprise us before we have finished, I
must entreat the honor only to be made acquainted with those things, that
shall belong to your own Titles; and the rather for that I have heard some
disputes formerly to that purpose, which I was not very well able to answer,
and should be very glad to be better provided against other arguments of the
same nature.

Truly Madam answered Cassianus, as it is impossible for me to sever in all
respects the interests of other Princes from my own, so I will endeavor to
avoid what unnecessary discourse may prove either tedious or impertinent; after
that Roxana had acknowledged the favor by a few complements, he related these
particulars.

Although I am confident said he, that you are competently informed, that my
dead father was dispossessed of his fruitful Country of Iberia for taking up
of Arms against the power of Artaxes King of Armenia, yet may not be perhaps
sufficiently instructed how Tygranes became possessor of our Countries, Titles,
and Honors, wherefore be pleased to know, that after my said father was driven
forcibly from the possession of the Crown of Mesopotamia, (which he had
received by the free election of that people, who found themselves oppressed by
the Laws Artaxes had imposed upon their consciences; as well as many of the
Nobility deprived of such Lands belonging to the Temples, in their possessions,
which their predecessors had lest them, though formerly taken away I must
confess by violence from the Flamines) and my mother forced to fly to her
friends charity for succor and safety, the King of Armenia with the assistance
of Tygranes riches, prosecuted so far his begun good fortune, that in a short
space he not only quieted the stirs in his dominions, but advanced his power
into Iberia, which being without any support, but what few Forces Euarchus his
father, then King of Lydia had send to defend his daughters right, quickly
became master of what strong places he pleased, until at last he was Lord of
the whole; and being in possession he not only paid that debt he owed to
Tygranes with part of my Lands, but bestowed upon him in requital of his other
good services, all our Titles and honors which for many lasting ages had
remained in our family, as being the next of kin. As this cruel injustice
killed my father with grief, so after some years it brought to our assistance
the forenamed Scythian Prince, as one sent from the Gods in our apprehension,
to teach Artaxes a new law of obedience to the fortunes of so great a courage;
however this date of life became determined by the envious destinies, and we
left only to demand aid of Orsames power, to finish that work that we thought
so happily begun to the advantage of the injured Princes; in which number I was
to be reckoned the chief, since most eminent both in wrongs and honors: As I
may say my particular cause bearing the very name of all the rest: In this
sign, the Syrians continued a large progress within Artaxes Countries, until
the King himself was forced in a manner by the consent also of Sorastros King
of Egypt, to that general treaty I formerly mentioned; which notwithstanding
all the while has only produced disputations, instead of conclusions, for that
the War continues still with violence to the ruin of the whole Kingdom,
without the benefit of any in particular, began at first by the obstinate pride
of Tygranes, that would not restore those rights belonging to my self, which
probably might have given satisfaction to the other Princes of our faction;
however lately Tygranes being also oppressed by the burden of war in his
own dominions, begins to be more plyant to our desires, and to this purpose
many arguments are alleged of either side to give color to the unfortunate
actions of Soldiers, who are maintained more to satisfy the ambition of the
two mighty Kings, then to put us in possession of our rights. Tygranes
affirms, that as the King of Armenias gratitude bestowed upon him in
recompense of his services done the Crown, those honors and Lands that
belonged to our Family, so the money he has laid out in the Wars, makes him
a lawful purchaser of that benefit; and therefore in all equity cannot be
deprived of them without a full satisfaction, according to the damage he has
sustained by those actions. The State of Syria again pretends, that unless my
self be restored to my former dignities, the combination which is made with
the injured Princes, must of necessity be broken, and so consequently their
Kingdom of Syria dishonored in their agreement; and we further add, that
although Artaxes might have some color of displeasure against my father, for
taking upon him the Crown of Mesopotami'a, and defending the possession in his
life time by force of Arms, which however is a Title disputable, yet my self
ought not to be esteemed any way guilty of the fault being an infant; and
therefore too much injured by such a loss, when instead of enjoying the
greatest principallity of all Armenia for dignity, I am left naked of honor
and subsistence, whilst others of less quality triumph with those spoils that
should adorn my person. In conclusion, not to detain your expectation over
long with diversity of relations, although the Kingdom of Syria vows never to
lay down Arms without a full restoration of the Princes rights: yet many
Ministers of that State did underhand conclude a league with Tygranes to my
prejudice; which shows particular interest has the chief preheminency in
this War; but since, upon new breaches, the Duke again is fallen off from
that agreement: in so much as the difference may produce better effects; and
the rather do I hope it, for that Tygranes has lately offered to procure the
King of Armenia to grant me equal honors to those my father has lost, as
himself will be content to deliver up the possession of the Countries
belonging to my right, if a general peace in all Asia may by that means
succeed; provided he be competently satisfied by the State for those damages he
has sustained by the Wars; in which posture continue our present affairs;
without either moving backward or forward, to the amazement of the whole world.

Truly my Lord answered Roxana, it seems to me, nothing more is demanded in
the Kingdom of Armenia then what you have been pleased to mention, since your
interest is the bases, upon which the only occasion of the War has been
builded. It is true said Cassianus, however some differences in points of
religion that the Scythians stand upon, is a kind of an obstacle also; yet it
is thought, the State of Syria can when it pleases, moderate that particular:
but the truth is, that those contentions that depend upon Egypt and Syria, are
of so much consequence to this Treaty, that it absolutely hinders not only the
progress, but success of all the rest, whose ambitions as it is thought can
never be satisfied; until one of those States perish from its appearing
greatness; by which means the other may appear to the world more absolute.

By this time the Princess Cloria came into the room, which for the present
not only broake off their discourse, but gave warning to Cassianus to present
himself to his most glorious Mistress, as the chiefest deity his heart
pretended to adore; however, she, as if nature as well as art had taught a more
beseeming quickness then ordinary, fortified with those instructions she had
received from her Governesse that gave her confidence, prevented her kinsmans
addresses with these words:

Cousin said she, if my necessary employment has made me seem rude in that
entertainment your kind visit merited from me, I must desire you, rather to
interpret my omission to the presumption I had in those ties that have united
us in blood, then any fault my governesse has committed in my education, upon
which score I am bold to ask your pardon, for your over long stay in expecting
my company. Cassianus finding himself saluted in this manner, not only
contrary to custom, but his own expectation, since formerly all her discourses
were rather marks of civility, then testimonies of affection; stood some time
amazed, as if his imagination could not be satisfied in that truth which his
ears heard uttered; But after he had a little put off that pleasing
distraction that anew captivated his senses, though in a trembling posture, he
returned her this answer.

Truly Madam said he, if the greatest Emperor in the world had been so
bountifully repayed for whole ages of attendance upon so beautiful a goddess,
certainly he would have made no question of his satisfaction, but rather have
given his whole domination of the earth for such a purchase; much less must I
esteem my self injured that only live by your pleasure. O my Lord answered the
Princess, since your expressions fly so high a pitch, I shall begin to think
it necessary to defend my reputation against your complements; but yet upon
better consideration, I am of opinion it is much safer to confess my self
overcome by your courtesy, then venture more blows in so unequal a combat,
where your wit will be sure to have the victory: And with these words taking
him by the hand she led him into a fair Balcony that had a large prospect over
the goodly Rive^ of Pact^le, where long they had not remained (the Princess in
the mean time casting her eyes down the River, upon whose banks was seated
that pleasant house of her Fathers that first gave Cassianus entertainment when
he came into Lydia) before she used this language, though a sweet shower of
tears opened the passage for her words: I cannot said she but with some grief
remember the innocent times that gave both you and me meeting in yonder place,
when my Father seemed to triumph in glory, that is now unfortunately
metamorphosed into a Garrison of Soldiers, who perchance neither honor
dignity, nor know goodness, much less practice virtue.

Indeed said Cassianus, as I must confess those respects I then received from
your most noble Father, and my affectionate Uncle were far beyond my poor
deserts, which gives me more occasion at present to lament his condition, in
being Subject to such a cruelty, that no power of mine is able to redeem, yet I
cannot also but remember my own losses at that time, since even then I quitted
the liberty of my soul, that until this present I could never recover again;
though I have sought all ways of redemption; and unless you prove more
merciful then the Kings oppressors, I shall not only remain in as great a
captivity, but have cause to accuse you of the like Tyranny, though I dare not
be so bold in my complaints.

But yet Cousin said Cloria, I must make a great deal of difference in the
nature of your sufferings, though I should grant the quality; for as the King
has by all means possible strived to give his oppressors satisfaction,
provided it may not be against the right of his Successors, and good of his
people; so you of the other side violently aim at your own content, to the
injuring perhaps of another Title. Alas Madam answered Cassianus, was I not
your first and last lover? the silent rocks can give sufficient testimonies of
the one, when at that famous hunting, I retired under their protections, only
to make my complaints, and the whole Senate can witness the other: by my
importunities; wherefore no interest is to be esteemed equal to my
pretentions, either in affection or right.

Alas, alas answered the Princess, you never let me know those powerful
affections before other respects had taken full possession of that heart which
became also in some sort a prisoner not to be released, who perhaps might as
well have been your Captive, if your omissions had not proved most unfortunate
to your purposes. And whereas you say, you are my last lover, I beseech you do
but consider Farezius intentions, and look upon his actions, and you will
find both violence and power has discovered a later scene, then what you
moved in, when you saved the old Flamins life, so that I must tell you, that
unless punctually you observe the condition according to your former
agreement, which was never to press my love to any conclusion, if Narcissus
were living, to whose living, to whose memory I must still observe that
decorum, I vow by the gods never to entertain any motions from your addresses,
much less give any consent to a future marriage; besides you must perform
those actions that may render you capable of satisfaction, as my self freedom
in granting; which can never be as long as the General has opportunity to
prevent and power to constrain. Wherefore in brief, you are to study some
opposition answerable to his greatness for both our advantages, whereby the
better to merit my love, as to show your self worthy the name of a Prince of
so great an extraction.

These discourses of Cloria could not choose but nettle the ears of Cassianus
toward the resolution of sufficient ambitions; since hitherto he conceived
himself to have been over sloathfull, as well in her love as his own honor;
so that standing some time in a deep muse, as if he intended to setch his
determinations from his very soul, at last he broake out into this language:
Most fair and wise Princess said he, as already I have promised my best
endeavors with the expense of my dear blood (in which you have the dearest
interest) in your service against the proud General; so I must be prescribed
by your directions to such limitations and performances as I am to observe for
fear, that else my actions may either endanger your safety to be more valued
then the worlds Empire, or ruin your Fathers hopes, whose sufferings cannot be
exampled. Therefore I beseech you let me know how far your pleasure may
travel in that journey I intend to make against the pride of ambitious
Farezius.

Cousin said Cloria, as I shall leave my Governesses experience to treat with
you about the particulars, so of the other side, I am content to give you these
assurances of my affections, that after Narcissus you shall have the next place
in my consideration, provided you think of my Fathers sufferings, and be
mindful of your own honor, since without him I cannot give away my self, and
without your reputation you are but half a Prince. Upon these conditions you
shall find my Lodgings ever ready to entertain your visits, so they may be
seasonable and not scandalous, which I believe are favors sufficient to
nourish your hopes, according to those expressions you received under my hand
in that Letter, your seeming neglect of my condition forced from me, which is
all for the present I have to say upon this theme, unless it be to add to
your consideration, how is it possible you can either reap fruits from my
affection, if Farezius continue great? or what probability have you again to
recover your lost Country of Iberia, if all regality be suppressed? since in the
one his greatness may perhaps constrain me to an unwilling consent for my
own preservation, as the other by this means may so fill Lydia with popular
desires, that your birth and blood, much less dignity shall find no
entertainment in their considerations. Wherefore I say, join your thoughts only
to such designs as shall be contrived by the Nobility with the State of Syria;
wherein the Myssians seem also to have a share, in regard the Lords govern all
in their Country, and by that means you will best please my desires.

Although Cassianus could not disprove the Princess Rhetoric, for that it
taught him a duty belonging to his quality, which he had not hitherto
altogether followed, since he more looked upon his own private concernments, in
complying with his Uncles enemies, then those rights that belonged to the
dignity and honor of Princes, of which number himself was eminent by blood
and alliance: yet in regard of those hopes that Cloria gave him by her fair
language, and good entertainment, he was sufficiently pleased with her
discourse, for that it spoke at leastwise liking, if not love to his ears:
however, it seemed mixed with some reserved conditions, which he was content
only to interpret bashful assurances, though the gods were privy to other
intentions, that could not be altered; wherefore as if joyfully assured by the
Princesses words, and impatient of more delay to pat in execution what he was
enjoined after he had returned humble thanks not only for her free expressions,
but the confidence she had in his services, with some other complements
belonging to his love, and fit for the season, kissing her fair hands he took
his leave, yowing the absolute performance of all her commands to the uttermost
of his power: but being gone, the Princess used these words to Roxana, fearing
belike her own dissimulation was too great a crime.

Do you believe said she, that the gods will be content with my hypocrisy, in
making this poor Princes affections, a stale to our other purposes, since you
know my virtuous engagements are so far from suffering me to become his wife,
that my heart dares scarce think of such a persuasion in any kind; and as
little should I be willing such a report should reach the ears of absent
Narcissus, who perhaps will accuse my constancy for having only deceived, in
that nature for his better advantage: no no Roxana be confident, as plain
dealing is best in all moral actions, so certainly in love the contrary
procures either hate, jealousy, or despair, which may produce effects
dangerous, if not destructive. After the old woman with a kind of smile had
heard out her Mistresses discourse, she returned her this answer.

As I cannot deny said she, but dissimulation in it self, is a flattering vice
that steals upon many dispositions with certain possible if not probable
signs of lawfulness, because they are contented to be persuaded by their
imaginations, they mean no hurt in their intention, which notwithstanding I
must confess, destroys all moral conversation; yet in all respects of the
contrary, for a person to uncover his breast upon every occasion, without
leaving himself a defense against his crafty enemy, were a madness capable to
ruin his fortunes as often as the opportunity presented the means. Wherefore
Madam, in the general I can only give this rule, when a body is left at
liberty whether he will speak or no, let him rather hold his peace, then so
much as intimate a falsehood by his words, or in friendly conversation appear
not candid and satisfactory: but if in deep examinations that may produce
great consequences either of good or hurt, for my part I am of opinion, all art
possible may be used to avoyde the determination, provided a direct untruth be
not admitted; or the damage of a third party sustained by the concealment.

But Roxana said the Princess, for that you intend this discourse for my
satisfaction, I pray let us apply it to my case with my Cousin, whom you see I
have won into a belief of what I never intend. It Is true said Roxana, however
it does not appear you have engaged your self either by words or actions; and
therefore it is not any thing you have done has constrained or persuaded his
belief; wherefore it ought only to rest upon the fault of his own fancy, if he
prove deceived in his expectation hereafter. Besides, it may be considered,
that as he has been some part of the occasion of your suffering unjustly, so
is it fit he should endure a little penance for that offense; and put case it
may be granted that you have after a manner deluded his thoughts by the Letter
you wrote him, wherein you seem to envite his addresses to a new Courtship,
yet it cannot be esteemed false, for that you may have a resolution to
entertain his affection, if my Lord Narcissus (whom the Gods defend) should
misearry. I but there Governesse, replied Cloria lies hidden the deceit, since
my resolutions are fixed never to make any other choice in life or death. Why
then answered Roxana, at the worst you do but like an honest person in danger
to be robbed, that takes some liberty to make thieves fall out, whereby to be
the better secured: And seeing that Cassianus cannot be prejudiced by the
practice, but on the contrary reap benefit, for that his fortunes seem to
depend upon regallity and Nobility, which the rude multitude would destroy; I
see no reason why you should possess your thoughts with such scruples. Well,
well said the Princess, as you are my Governesse, in this doubt I will
persuade my conscience to observe your principles; however, the gods may punish
us both for our overmuch boldness, thus to play too freely with those
injunctions that concern religion; or at leastwise may have some relation to
it; however, I cannot deny, but that there is a necessity in my dissimulation
at this present; and the rather am I content a little to practice the faculty,
for that I know Cassianus can sustain no prejudice by my intentions.

Notwithstanding these and other reasons which Roxana used at diverse times,
proved sufficient motives to retain her mistress firm in prosecuting their
designs; yet understanding by Creses amongst other discourses, that the Duke
of Cyprus was dead, she could not in some sort but be doubtful of the safety
of Narcissus, for that they had heard nothing from him since his separation;
however, she was extremely careful to keep these thoughts from entering into
the bosom of the already too much troubled Princess, though in the interim
she omitted no opportunity whereby to instruct Cassianus in that part he was to
play by their appointment against Farezius.

Cassianus as I said, having received both commands from Cloria, and
instructions by Roxana, consulted oftentimes with himself as well as with her
how he might best put them in execution, until at last he fell upon this
resolution; that as Dimogoras his trusty friend, had been most injun'd by the
preferment of Farezius, having outed him of his place and command in the Army,
so would he be the fittest person to be communicated with all, concerning the
like lie way to prosecute his designs, according to the directions he had
received: To this effect he intended to make him acquainted with the hopes he
had lately received to obtain the favor of the Princess Cloria in his
pretended love; The rather for that he knew he was not only a man who had a
principal interest among the Nobility and chief Senators, but was also
extremely beloved in the Army, by most of the common Soldiers, that were not
absolute creatures of Farezius: wherefore one morning before Dimogoras was gone
out of his chamber, Cassianus came unto him with a smiling countenance, and
this language in his mouth: Dimogoras said he, as it were something impertinent
again for me, to reiterate the multitude of my obligations to your endeavors,
since they are not only generally known to all the world, but diverse times
have been acknowledged by my expressions in particular: so my business at
present is to make you acquainted anew, both with my thoughts and intentions
concerning some late passages: I came into Lydia as you know by your
procurement to prosecute my affections to the fair Princess the Kings
daughter when she was taken prisoner by the Senates Fleet in Pergame. It Is true
my courtships in that nature, were something retarded, if not absulutely laid
aside until the present, by reason of a certain correspondency between her,
and Narcissus the Duke of Cyprus son: This gives me occasion to tell you,
that however I found her then backward to my wishes; either proceeding from her
flattering fancy that Narcissus was living, or conceiving her own condition was
much more secure in the Senates custody, then at present under the jurisdiction
of the Army and Soldiers, or rather I may say being violently pressed to some
inconveniences, by reason of the extraordinary greatness, (both in command and
authority) of Farezius, who as it should seem pretends something violently to
her love and affection; Now she is become more tractable, and willing to
entertain those protestations of mine, whose effect I have ever consecrated to
her service, since I had the honor to be entertained by the good will of the
Lydian people: I need not trouble you much with the reperitions of your own
received injuries by reason of the generals greatness, notwithstanding all
those gallant services, which you have performed, in the defense and safety of
the Commonwealth, neither shall I mention the consequences thereby, that
threaten a kind of destruction to all the Nobility of the Kingdom; for that I
know your judgment, and their apprehensions, cannot possibly be wanting in
this particular: only I must needs tell you that the Princess Cloria her
self, extremely wonders how it is possible, you should dispense so much with
your honor and reputation as to bear those indignities that have cast you
from your authority and command, with such an extreme quiet pacification? Are
the Nobility said he of Lydia, so much degenerated in their souls and spirits,
as easily in this manner to quit their honor, to the lowest conditions the
people shall direct? what is become of the magnanimity of mind, once so
frequently reigning in the breasts of the better fort of men in this Kingdom,
that is now lost in a chaos of confusion with the rabble or common multitude?
does a little sensual fear, bury all considerations of valor and gallantry
in this Nation? people being only given to eat and drink, without affectation
of greatness or apprehension of disgrace: If it be so my Lord in the general,
my words will be as much in vain to be uttered, as your life in effect will be
miserable in the future: but I have more confidence in the courage of
Dimogoras, both for his own sake and my good: This being said, Cassianus rested
silent to hear what reply Dimogoras would make.

Dimogoras I may say continued altogether mute for something a long space: his
eyes sparkling out in the interim nevertheless a certain kind of seeming
desire of revenge, though his body overgrowne with flesh and humor, appeared
not to be much inclinable to action: but being wakened to some determinate
answer, by the importunities of Cassianus (who belike himself had been
strongly urged by Roxana, to be speedy in the execution of her design) at last
he blutterd out this reply.

My Lord said he, I must confess, that both my self and the rest of the
Nobility of Lydia according to the Princesses apprehension, (whose Father
however I love ^^ot, nor ever shall) have wound their dignities and honors,
into such a labyrinth of inconvenience, by complying so much with the violent,
and confused humors of the common people, that we have in a manner suffered
Farezius with the rest of his faction, to overthrow already the most essential
part of our hereditary honors and privileges; and by that means are become
less powerful, to act any thing with advantage either to our selves or
others: nevertheless perhaps; I may yet set on foot something of faction
amongst the Soldiers, (if they have not wholly lost the remembrance, that I
once commanded amongst them) that may perchance produce effects tending to
those purposes you have designed: with these words he entered into some rage
and passlon, as it were out of the very apprehension of his own loss of
reputation, in being so disgracefully turned out of his command: presently
after this he took his leave of Cassianus, as pretending he would go to the
Senate, to try his friends constitutions conceming those designs he intended:

Cassianus was glad he had got thus much from his resolutions (for
notwithstanding he did not at all doubt his affection, yet he might have some
cause to suspect his activity) so that he determined himself also, to use the
best interest he had, both with the Lords and the rest of the Senators, whom he
knew to be of a contrary faction to Farezius: withal he had upon all occasions
free admittance into the Princesses lodgings, according to her own allowance
and Roxana's directions; which as it may be thought, sufficiently contented his
apprehension.

It was not long before Dimogoras and the rest of the Nobility, raised
considerable factions and mutinies in the Army, amongst the Soldiers, they
also being enflamed by their want of pay, and not performance of other
conditions promised them upon their first taking up Arms against the King,
being since renewed again to their hopes, when he was delivered out of prison,
by some Troops sent to that purpose, which suddenly called away both Farezius
and Hercrombrotus to the appeasing of the stirs.

Though Farezius, did with fair language and promising words in a short
speech, seemingly pacify most of their discontents, yet Hercombrotus, who was
of a more violent and active nature, finding many of the Troops continue still
their mutinies, and insolences against their command, suddenly flew in amongst
those Soldiers with fury in his looks, and terror in his countenance, where
presently seizing upon two or three of those that appeared most refractory and
disobedient, he delivered them instantly over to officers to be executed and
punished: After this he not only offered a free pardon to the rest, but also
promised them a real performance of all their just expectations, provided that
from thence forward, they would continue obedient and constant in their
affections.

After this, when both Farezius and Hercrombrotus were on their way again
toward the City of Sardis, an officer of the Army began this discourse to his
General: Sir said he, by this late mutiny, you may see the danger not only of
Dimogoras interest amongst the Soldiers, but the power he has with those of
the better sort of Senators; from which original, I suppose, has proceeded in
part these now appeased troubles in the Camp: of the other side can you
possibly conceive that after so many testimonies of disaffection from Euarchus
the King, he will be ever brought to be either entire for the Soldiers
advantage, or be weaned from that affection without reason, he has always
expressed to be in his nature, for his false and ungrateful country men the
Myssians? in like manner, with what confidence can we any more trust the
actions of the wealthy City of Sardis, when as they did not only refuse, to
open their purses to our occasions in our greatest necessities, but denied us
entrance into their Town, by the persuasion of those Senators that we have
now sent to banishment? These things being granted to be true, the next
consideration ought to be had of the remedy for future prevention: In the first
place, to compass our designs, and procure our security, we must endeavor to
join with a prevailing party in the Senate, or at leastwise make them so by
the Soldiers power, who may pass an absolute decree, to have no more Treaties
with the King, in regard that those hopes and fears, do not a little distract
the whole Kingdom, from relying absolutely upon our commands and jurisdiction,
as you know most necessary for the peoples safety: in the next place we are
totally to suppress the interest of Dimogoras for the present, and the
Nobillities privileges in the future, which as I must tell you keep up such an
opinion amongst all sorts of people, concerning their greatness and
stabillity, that it will be a very difficult matter, to act any thing either
for the Kingdoms good or the Armies advantage: Lastly, we must not only drive
the Myssian Commissioners out of our Country, who only wait occasions to suck
up all the benefit to themselves and Nation, which the Lydians at any time
shall either fight or toil for, but in some terrifying way or other procure
money from the Citizens of Sardis, whereby to give just and fitting content to
those faithful and loving Soldiers, that have fought so many bloody Battles,
and obtained multitudes of signal victories in their Countries behalf,
against their numerous enemies.

Though Farezius by reason of his melancholy and silent nature, made no great
reply at the present, to those reasons that had been delivered, yet it was not
many days after their arrival at Sardis, before an absolute decree passed the
Senate, that not only there should be no more Treaties, or addresses made unto
Euarchus, concerning any agreement either in the general or particular, but it
was also ordered, that it should be esteemed a crime of a most high
consequence, for any person so much as to make tender of any proposition to
that effect, to the rest of the Senators there assembled: which resolution was
quickly published over the whole Kingdom of Lydia by a formal proclamation.

Of the other side Dimogoras finding, both his interest in the Army and his
credit with the Senators did not any way suit with his ambition and
expectation, upon the very apprehension (as it was thought) of these apparent
disgraces, in a very few days ended his life in this world; however there were
some that not only gave it out, but believed, that he had been poisoned, to
prevent a farther trouble and danger to the Kingdom: This also gave occasion
to Prince Cassianus within a very short time after, to quit personally the
Country of Lydia, as perhaps supposing, now his chief friend and Favorite
Dimogoras was gone, and the rest of the Lords not being in a capacity to
support his honor and designs, against the Soldiers, in the Princess
Clorias behalf, it was to little purpose any longer to prosecute his pretended
love.

Nevertheless the Nobillity, with many other of the Senators of the same
faction, prepared themselves to give the body of Dimogoras, most stately and
glorious Funerals: To this intent, when the day came, all attired in black,
they met the corpse with a world of ceremony, and so conducted it through a
multitude of people, to the place ordained for that purpose, where being placed
according to the custom of other Generals, the flames quickly consumed the
pyles whilst that which was immortal, had a farther account to give,
concerning his actions and thoughts during his life.

When the Princess Cloria understood of this strange and unexpected law, not
only pronounced in the Senate, but published all over the Kingdom, she began
now to repent her, of her too much belief given to the Kings enemies,
notwithstanding any persuasion whatsoever, she had entertained in her thoughts;
and consequently had more cause a great deal to doubt her own security,
having no other defense left her but what she could gather from the faithful
and wise Counsels of her entrusted governesse Roxana, which was the occasion,
that one day having for the most part spent her whole store of passion, she
used this kind of despairing discourse unto her.

Truly Roxana said she, as there might be noted at first, a strong jealousy
amongst the Soldiers, by the strict guard set upon the Kings person, so this
last action makes me fear, that there is some prevailing design, as well
against our liberties as his dominion, which we shall be scarce able to prevent
by any industry or assistance; for as I cannot rely much upon the Lords power,
by reason they have altogether lost their authority, by severing their
interests at the first from their Princes prerogative, nothing but to comply
with their own ambition and spleen; so is there as little to be hoped for, from
the endeavors of this great and rich City of Sardis, considering their late
carriages, when Farezius with his triumphant Army, not only entered their Walls
without resistance, but were content to receive his absolute commands, without
the least dispute, belonging to their long enjoyed privileges, never as yet
questioned by any former Prince or power; these representations being known
and granted to be the effects of the late transactions, what probabilities
remain, for the recovery of my fathers rights, though it should be
opinionated, that we our selves were out of all danger personally; since the
Kings party appears, not to have either abillity or will to do him good; And
Lydia being strongly united under the present jurisdiction, what foreign
industry and endeavor soever, can work any considerable effects to his
advantage? considering the many brave Vessels and shipping that are always
ready for defense and resistance, upon the Carian and Ionian shoares, to oppose
either sudden invasion or continued hostility.

When Roxana had for some time rested silent with tears in her eyes, she
returned her this answer: Lady said she, you must then give me leave to blame
your superstitious modesty (as I may call it) in not suffering your Uncle
Orsames to have performed those ceremonies belonging to your Nuptials at
Memphis; which perhaps in part if not totally, would have prevented these
inconveniences.

Indeed Governesse replied the Princess, although perhaps you esteem those
decor^ms of fitting duty, which I shall be ever ready to render my Father and
Mother, but bashful superstitions, yet I can assure you, I shall never be so
much wanting to my own honor, as rather not a thousand times to venture my
dearest life, then to give away my self to any love whatsoever, without their
inward consent and public approbation: but let us for the present leave that
subject, and only fall upon the consideration, or the means, whereby the King
may be redeemed from his miseries, which Rhetoric would not only far better
please my ears, but be a much more profitable discourse in my opinion, since
in the other point, I am resolved still to remain obstinate, notwithstanding
any persuasion to the contrary.

Truly said Roxana, as I must needs confess, the thing it self is difficult
to bring about and the ways more uncertain to know how; so of the other side,
I am so far from believing the impossibility of the Kings restoration to his
ancient dignity, that according to my own thoughts I shall give you very
probable reasons, whereby to persuade you to it, if my fancy does not much
outgoe my judgment.

For although I cannot deny, but that the Country of Lydia being thoroughly
united under a well settled government, with the addition of Ionia, and Caria,
that afford so many considerable havens, furnished with multitude of shipping,
is a condition scarce to be attempted by any power; yet considering the
impatience of the peoples natures, with the daily oppressions of them by the
heavy weight of Taxations, a quick division will be wrought in the hearts of
those, that must of necessity be won to the change of laws, and government
before the ancient constitutions (by which the Subjects have formerly lived
happily for so many ages) can be totally taken away: However for the present,
perhaps either fear or hope exercises so far men's thoughts, that hardly as
yet have they leisure for consideration: but when as, I say, they shall find
this is like to be perpetual, they will with much violence desire again their
old subjection, though at first they were foolishly persuaded to seek a new
government. And more especially if those two great Monarchs of Syria, and
Egypt once make that accord, that all Asia attends with a greedy expectation,
which may soon be effected, since the King of Armenia has already agreed with
his discontented Princes, and also has condiscended to give satisfaction to
the Scythian Crown, whereby to deliver his Country absolutely from that
power, that has so many years molested it with its arms.

But Roxana said the Princess, what will those agreements conduce to my
fathers benefit, when every Prince regards only his own concernments? besides
their extreme jealousy of one another glory will not suffer them to
undertake any conquest jointly: And put case they should accord constantly in
their purposes, yet when the people of Lydia shall see themselves ready to be
invaded by a foreign power, they will certainly more strongly conform their
obediences, to this jurisdiction they now live under, whereby the better to
prevent a new threatening danger.

It is true said Roxana until the Subjects be made more desperate in their
sufferings, the people will not be content to trust strangers with their
liberty; but yet the assistance that is desired from foreign Princes needs
not to consist wholly in numerous Armies, but in small and frequent supplies
both of men and moneys, which joined with the Kings party, and laying hold of
the many discontents already engendered in the hearts of most, cannot but
conduce exceedingly to the overthrow of this new government. Besides there is
another benefit that may be expected from other Countries, being at open
difference with the Senate of Lydia; and that is, denying their Merchants the
liberty of Trade within their dominions, which at last must of necessity
discontent and impoverish the rich City of Sardis, from whence the Soldiers
are (if not maintained) at leastwise supplied upon all urgent occasions.

But why answered Cloria may not these Princes, and especially the two great
Monarchs of Egypt and Syria, as well forbid the free commerce you speak of in
the time of their own differences, as when they shall be at peace between
themselves, if they have any intention to right my father, as I have heard they
do pretend?

Because, replied Roxana, they are both so full of their own ambition, that
neither dares offend the State of Lydia as yet, until their Wars be at an
end between themselves, least they might give too much advantage to each other
by the assistance of so powerful a Kingdom as this is.

Then said the Princess, there may be some hopes to better my fathers
affairs, when these Kings shall think it good to put up their bloody swords,
and not before.

I conclude not so Madam, answered Roxana, for although these exasperated
Princes against their own quiet should have neither temper in their actions,
nor find wisdom in their councillors, until mere necessity should
constrain their Subjects to seek peace with violence, which were too dangerous
a president; yet it is to be hoped that the Myssians with the Cretan Forces
joined to the discontents of Lydia, by reason of diversity of Religions and
interests would in time restore the King to his ancient dignity.

Pish Roxana, replied Cloria; for the Myssians, I have so little confidence in
their assistance, that what countenance soever their actions put on, I can
scarce be persuaded of their intentions, since they once sold my father to this
misery he now undergoes; when they had a gallant Army in the Field to have
redeemed both his person, and his Crown; And for the Cretans, besides that
they are of a different profession to ours concerning the worship of the gods;
there are also so many factions amongst them by way of private ambition, that
they rather go back daily in their own affairs, then show any probability of
helping others; And for the discontents of Lydia which you mention, with their
diversities of Religions, I do not find upon all occasions, but they can very
well lay down their own spleenes, when there appears a necessity to oppose my
fathers prosperity: Lastly, concerning the common peoples sufferings, I am
persuaded, they are resolved to endure any subjection, or almost bondage it
self, rather then to be willing the King should recover again his lost
rights, by force and power of the sword, without making first some conditions
with his prerogative, notwithstanding he has diverse times, given them by
protestations, what assurances could be desired from a just, and a religious
Prince.

Madam, answered Roxana, your opinion I must confess is grounded upon a great
deal of probabillity, considering how the Myssians not only sold the King to
the power of the Senate, but at the first beginning of these troubles came into
Lydia to dispute your fathers rights: But yet if you please to consider, that
the reason of their actions then proceeded from the extreme covetousness of
some eminent persons amongst them who find now they can expect no more gain
(the Senate having already compassed their ends upon them) you will easily
believe, that they are resolved to change the scene for your fathers
advantage, since by that means they may come to play a double game, and win
by the bargain: Next concerning the Cretans although I must confess their
foolish divisions amongst themselves have not only much hindered the Kings
affairs, and in a manner endangered the whole frame of their own designs, yet
is there such a disparity between them, and the people of Lydia, not only in
regard of the difference of Religion, but in that we have outed them formerly
of much of their Lands; that they will dye to the last man, rather then suffer
the Senate to bear rule over them: Thirdly, I must desire you not to dwell too
strictly upon your belief, that the common people of Lydia will so easily
accord their difference, and pacify their discontents, upon the appearance of
a strange Army; in regard it will only bring with it the right of the cause,
with a promise of amendment; especially when they shall by a little more
experience find, that their present grievances have neither termination nor
limitation; For I say, that as at the first they were persuaded to entertain
the assistance of the Myssians, whom they most hated, and feared of all other
Nations, against their King, who oppressed them in nothing, however their
fancies did injure their judgments, so will they as well accept of any
foreign assistance against the Senate, when they can no longer endure the
burden of their oppressions: And last of all give me leave to tell you, that
the divisions within the Army and Senate house, cannot but produce strange
effects, since no spleen is so great, as what is in gendred by the same
faction, when once they fall at odds, either by reason of gain or prerogative:
But as she was further proceeding in her discourse, the dwarf informed them,
that there was newly arrived in the Castle hall a young Maid of an excellent
beauty, who desired with much earnestness, to be brought presently into the
Princess presence, as pretending she had some secret to discover, not
convenient to be imparted to any other ear; he also said, that as her eyes
sparkled forth a kind of youthful Majesty, so did her neglectfull dress,
seem to have been disordred by her late journey, which made her appear more
Amazon like.

This strange advertisement put them both into a sollicitous consideration, as
well concerning the person of the party, as the occasion of the adventure; And
many loving desires would gladly have persuaded poor Cloria, that Narcissus had
borrowed another disguize, to have given her a new visit: but having more
exactly examined her little servant concerning all particulars, she found the
stranger neither in stature or countenance could agree with the proportion or
features of her absent Lord: Wherefore after some more displeasing
consideration, with a kind of a sad voice, as if her thoughts were troubled at
the mistake, she commanded the Page to conduct the Maid to her presence.

As soon as the damsel entered the room, with confidence enough, approaching
nearer to the Princess in an abrupt manner, told her though softly in her
ear, that her new guest was no other but her brother Ascanius broake from his
imprisonment under the Senates jurisdiction; wherefore wished her for some time
to discharge her dwarf, that he might more freely discourse to her his
advantures.

Cloria was so much confounded with a sudden joy, to have her sweet brother in
her possession, whom she could not be permitted to see during their
imprisonment; that her distractions could scarce find a way, to put in
execution, what her own judgment, should have thought convenient at another
season: But at last breaking through her pleasant amazement, she discharged her
little officer; for however she was accustomed to trust him in her own secrets,
yet she would not notwithstanding use any privilege to hazard her brothers
confidence, least it might render him less assured of his safety: When she had
passionately demonstrated his welcome, by many affectionate kisses, taking his
white hand in hers, which seemed also to have a near aliance in beauty, she
desired him to make her acquainted with the passages of his escape, since as
she said, they could not but be admirable, considering the strict guard the
Senate was ever accustomed to set over the Kings children; in the interim
Roxana curiously attended to understand the discourse that was to proceed from
such dainty lips.

Wherefore after Ascanius had saluted his sisters looks, with three or four
gentle smiles, in which he seemed lovely to congratulate his own fortune and
deride his Goalers carelessness, he began this repetition, though first he
excused himself, for many circumstances belonging to the story.

My father said he, as he had commanded my brother Prince Arethusius for his
better safty, into the Kingdom of Syria, there to attend the directions of our
noble mother, so was he persuaded by the Myssians (in whose power he then
remained in the Army) to get me into his own possession, whereby the better to
secure (as they pretended) as many as might be of the blood royal; To this
purpose he commanded me to make an escape, and presently to repair to his
presence; however with this caution, that if I should be prevented in the
execution, I must not by any means reveal his desire; least the Myssians
should be brought into suspicion, who were then treating with the Senate about
their payment.

But be their pretenses what they would, I strengthened my duty and obedience,
by all the thoughts my young years and less discretion could suggest,
advantageable to the design and the Kings command, which I must tell you
scarce gave sleep to my eyes in the night, or rest to my body in the day, since
truly I must needs say, my youthful ambition became more violent then
ordinary, to do something exactly that might pretend to care and wisdom.

Yet not to trouble you with long repetitions, where the success proved
unfortunate. I was to my intolerable grief taken in my escape, though more
perplexed I must confess, to be foiled in my first interprize, then sorrowful
at the consequence of the loss: being apprehended I was by order of the
Senate, exactly examined before such Commissioners, as their gravities ordained
to be judges of my actions: However the gods so far favored my weak
constancy, that neither tyranny nor flattery, was able to shake my dutiful
resolution, which so enraged their froward spleens, that they not only caused
me to be shut up in a dark room, but commanded some slight punishment to be
inflicted upon my person, as a small conibatant in my fathers quarrel, at
which I rather laughed then seemed to feel: But not finding these petty
sufferings could prevail against my spirit, they ordered a great part of my
diet to be taken from me, as supposing belike my belly was easiest to be
conquered, when truly I never esteemed meat the chief part of my
consideration; especially when I was assured for their own sakes, they would
afford me sufficient to sustain nature: yet at last having tried all other
ways to compass their ends, without receiving any fruit from their labors,
they withdrew from me those accustomed respects belonging to my birth and
quality, which I cannot deny, but most wrought upon my disposition; for that I
conceived the dignity of my parents, as also your self sweet sister suffered
in the omission.

To be short, finding themselves wholly overcome by the goodness of my cause,
rather then by my courage, they began of a sudden to change (though not the
theater) yet the manner of their action; which was not only to sweeten their
carriages toward me, but also to tickle up my young ambition, with hopes of
being their elected King. For as they said, my father having totally abused his
trust, and my eldest brother Arethusius being unkindly fled from their
protection, they could find none other so fit a person to undertake the
government of the whole Kingdom as my self, if I would but express love in my
nature and be ruled by their Counsels, for their intentions as they protested
were never to destroy Monarchy: But I being enflamed with a new rage to hear
them to scandalize my fathers goodness, and go about to withdraw my duty by
their intentions, I answered that as my father had been much too gentle a
Prince for such people; so was their dissimulation no more to be believed
concerning my self in these offers, then when they protested to the world to
make Enarchus the greatest King of Asia; And in the mean time had to the
uttermost of their power deprived him of his Crown and dignity.

This blunt and resolute reply of mine, belike gave them no further
encouragement to proceed; for telling me, I was a pevish child, and could not
be brought to understand my own good, they not only quitted my company, but by
degrees suffered again the stream to return into its right course, to my
singular content; which however continued me still a prisoner.

Having past over so great a storm without shipwreck either of my own honor,
or danger to my fathers affairs, I began to conceive good opinions of my
judgment, and beginning likewise to be extreme weary of my captivity, since
my years now required activity, I fell into many considerations of another
escape; and had encouragement to put it in execution, not only by daily rumors
I heard of the discontents of the people, for that they found no inclination of
the Senate to agree with the King; but also, for that I understood many of the
Kings ships had lately revolted from their service: All which I say enflamed my
thoughts to a new design, and these inflammations of hope, desire, and passion,
made me diligent to procure the good opinion of those that were entrusted with
my person, as a necessary consequence to my intention. I oftentimes demanded of
them to what end was it to use rigor in my imprisonment, when it might turn to
their prejudice, if our side should hereafter prevail; neither could it at all
benefit them for the present with their masters by any rewards, if they
continued still in authority?

These persuasions with other circumstances, took them off from the fierceness
of their speed, especially when they had heard that Farezius was forced to send
many of his Troops abroad, to reduce some Provinces again to his obedience,
that rather chose to run into desperate dangers, then still to continue under
the Senates power.

These encouragements I say, made me begin to frame those Embryons I had
already conceived in my unsettled brain to some shape, proper for production;
and to this purpose, descending from generals to particulars, I acquainted a
servant I have now brought along with me, (whom I always found faithful to my
intentions) that my resolution was, in this distracted season to gain my
liberty out of the Castle; and therefore wished him to provide for my escape
such necessaries as were convenient for a business of so great consequence,
that concerned not only my own safety, but my fathers prosperity, but in the
interim to color my design, I gave it out that I intended to solemnize the
birth day of my brother, by a public Mask, to be acted for the delight of
those Soldiers of my guard: When the night came (having all the afternoon
before filled their brains with the fumes of excellent Wine, as their
imagination with the expectation of the story of Jupiter, flying from the ill
natured rage of his cruel father) after they were all orderly placed in their
seats, I caused the scene to be discovered, which appeared to their view of
so taking a quality, that they had no leisure at all to attend their charge, so
that I had liberty sufficient by their willing or careless neglect, to pass
diverse times without my accustomed attendants, through the Galleries into my
private bed chamber, as pretending I had some necessary office in the Play; but
at last finding they were all either sufficiently secured in their employment
of curiosity, or past consideration by reason of their over liberal diet, I
more secretly retired into my Cabinet, where I had appointed my servant to
attend with woman's apparel: which robes being soon fitted to my person, so
well suited with my imagination, that I carried my self with much confidence
amongst the multitudes of company in every room, when I came into the common
hall, my servant ushered me as some Masquer to the door; where the Porter made
no difficulty to give us passage, as believing it was a necessary duty
belonging to his office, not to be at all jealous in such joviality, least his
fellows might have derided him for his ridiculous caution.

But however, I got thus prosperously from the danger of all the Courts of
guard, yet the last centinell either bitten with his servile attendance in the
open air, whilst his other companions in warm rooms enjoyed content, or
being by nature more suspicious then the rest of his fellows, began strictly,
not only to examine our intentions, but roughly to deny our passage, in so much
as my servant not believing it was safe to admit of such a hazardable
contention, quickly drew out a short hanger he had by his side, and gave him a
blow upon the pate, that made him ask counsel of the ground for the rest of
his proceedings, whether the wound was mortal or no, we left him only to
consider, whilst we made our passage, free in the night season, through a thick
wood not far distant from the Castle, until the breaking of the morning,
constrained us to seek refuge in a dark cave, where we continued all the next
day for fear of discovery, since we doubted not, but my flight would soon be
pursued with open cry.

When the sky began again to be obscured for our advantage after the going
down of the Sun, we thought it best to take a new journey toward the City of
Sardis, where confusion we supposed would secure us, until we could find a
convenient transportation for Syria; however our weariness, and want of food
compelled me the next day about noone, to take up my habitation in a small
Cottage under a hill side, in whose dwelling there only remained an old man
with his wife, having between them as the fruits of their long marriage one
daughter, which by the way must occasion a pretty short story: We no sooner
entered the house, but being provoked by a sufficient appetite, we called for
such provision as they had, promising a large payment, and they as willingly
condiscended to our desires, in which office the maid seemed most diligent, not
only in regard of her own good huswifery, but being exceedingly delighted, as
might be gathered by her smiling countenance at my strange attire; in the house
there was but two beds, the one where the old people lay, and the other for the
young wench; so that I was to take up my rest necessarily in the Girls bed,
where I must confess, I slept to my content, whilst my attendant made use of a
bundle of straw in an out house for his lodging: but in the morning I might
feel, not only one in bed with me, but the party to have her hand over my
breast, whom by more consideration I found to be the young damsel of the
Cottage; This I must confess put me to some confusion, until by a strict
examination of her intention, I perceived it was only her own innocent
curiosity, because she thought me a fine young gentlewoman: At which relation
the Princess could not choose but laugh; the rather for that Ascanius, did with
something a constrained earnestness, strive to defend the wenches chastity, as
if he had been jealous also of his own honor: yet nevertheless he was sorced
to confess, the Maid did much question him, because he had no greater breasts;
But having sufficiently cleared his repatation, and jested out the rest, he
again continued his discourse.

Although said he, I had sufficiently satisfied her in all questions concerning
my travels, yet I had much ado to persuade her to rise from me; so much was
she in love with my company, neither would she condescend to my request until
she had again embraced me, bestowing three or four of her kisses upon my
lips; This being performed, and having yawned a pretty space, as a testimony of
her youthful laziness, she suddenly started out of the bed in her smock, that
was not of the finest cloth, where she remained still discoursing with me
until her father, and mother lying in the lower room, gave her a call or two
to hasten her speed, yet I had opportunity enough to enquire of her, not only
the nearest way to Sardis, but of the convenience of the next Town, where I
meant to provide my self of some change of apparel, since I durst not trust
those, which brought me from the Castle.

In concl^sion, after I had employed my servant a few days near the place to
buy other Robes; and bestowed my old apparel upon the wench, for a gratuity
of her kindness, in affording me so freely her company the first night, I not
permitting the second I took my leave lovingly of the old people, who truly
had entertained me with an honest Country affection, so that presently
according to our direction, we repaired to the Banks of the River Pactolus,
where we quickly hired a Bark, that without any suspicion at all brought us to
Sardis, which Town sheltred us without discovery, until we found another
convenience to convey us to your Castle, where being arrived, we are confident
you will not betray your guests, but rather advise us by your Counsel, how to
prosecute further my affairs; since it is to be thought, they will make a
sudden and diligent inquiry after my escape. At which words with a pretty smile
the Princess Cloria cast her eyes upon her Governesse, as if she expected from
her experience the best direction for them both.

Roxana, when she had drawn the looks of Ascanius upon her in a curious
manner, since he had not been formerly acquainted with her conversation, and
also mused according to her custom for some short space, she gave this advice.

Truly, said she, as it is most necessary in the prime place, that my Lord
Ascanius provide for his own security, since it is impossible but some speedy
search will be after his escape, the Senate not being willing to part with so
many of the Royal family out of their own jurisdiction; So Madam be pleased to
think it convenient, that the Queen now remaining in Syria, may presently be
made acquainted with this fortunate delivery of my Lord your brother from his
imprisonment by some trusly messenger to be dispatched from our Counsels, which
party may be (as I conceive) this faithful servant, the companion of his
Travels, whom he has now brought along with him into this Castle, who cannot
well remain here in that he will rather prove a Subject of suspicion then an
officer of use, since the daily visits of this place by the Nobility, and other
people of quality must of necessity bring his name in question. And for this
beautiful runaway your brother, since he so well becomes a Maids attire, and
has so bravely given testimony of his own modesty, I see no reason why he may
not still live amongst us, without danger to his own person, or prejudice to
our honors, being entertained as your attendant in your chamber, until either
commands out of Syria call him away, or you your self be removed from the
jurisdiction of this Kingdom, by your happy marriage with my Lord Narcissus;
at which words the Princess became as red as Scarlet, not dreaming her young
brother should so abruptly have been made acquainted with her secret
engagement: But the fault was already committed, and Roxana had no time to ask
forgiveness, wherefore something confounded by her error, as well as she
could she went on with her continued discourse.

However said she, that we may not remain altogether ignorant of the
proceedings of the Senate, I shall industriously endeavor to instruct our
little dwarf, who wants no wit to make such inquiry abroad, as may be most
convenient for our affairs, for whose truth and honesty I will undertake, with
the engagement of my reputation; This may give you a full liberty to enjoy with
freedom each others company, a benefit that neither of you will repine at I am
sure, since the fates have been hitherto penurious to both your conversations;
with these words she rested silent in a kind of a grave smile, expecting the
young couple should sign their consents by some demonstration.

After that Roxana had fully ended her discourse, the lovely pair looked upon
each other, with such a sweet cheerfulness, as if their own passions had no
desire to enquire further after the depth of her reasons, since their hearts
abundantly approved of the consequence of her design, which was that they
might enjoy the felicity of one another conversation; at last Cloria asked her
brother, how he liked the wisdom of her Governesse, which gave him occasion
to tell her, that he did not now wonder how she had passed through the
intricacie of so many dangerous adventures, having had so faithful and
discreet a Pilot to guide her, in the vast sea of such desperate accidents.

In the mean time this delighted company past away their hours in such
conversation, as most tended to Euarchus wished prosperity, sometimes
complaining of the unrelenting cruelty of the Senate, that could so long
detain their just and merciful King in a dark prison, instead of casting
themselves at his feet humbly to desire pardon for their offenses, otherwhiles
again they would entertain their thoughts, with new hopes of his releasement
by powerful Armies sent into Lydia by all the Princes of Asia, in which number
Narcissus had no low rank in the opinion of lovepartiall Cloria; neither
seldom did they agree in belief, that the general distractions of the
Kingdom, would soon put an end to the differences without any other
assistance, until these diversities of fancies carried them one day into the
garden, where Clorias diligent servant in the view of other attendants,
observed so carefully the directions of her charge; that she made always
election of those fruit that the Princess intention did but only covet, and
presented them to be made more beautiful by the touch of her white hand.

In these entertainments I say they continued until an ancient Lord of the
Senate, who had not altogether put off his duty and affection to the Kings
posterity, with a seeming joy that made him forget his accustomed ceremonies to
the Princess Cloria, not only suddenly entered the Garden, but made a kind of
rude passage through the crowd of such as waited near her person; and with a
breathless voice informed her, that, that very morning, as the Nobility were
sitting in their own Council chamber, divided by a partition from the common
assembly of the lower Senate, they were saluted in a tumultuous manner by may
thousands of people (having their leaders of much greater quality) with a
petition, that not only complained of the proceedings of the Army, but desired
they might again speedily enjoy the liberty of their King, the freedom of the
Laws, and an establishment of their Religion, as they said absolutely
obstructed from their possession, by the licentious power of the Soldiers
under Farezius command, whom (as they intimated) they had formerly chosen to be
their Captain for some season, but not to be a tyrant against their
privileges for ever; vowing withal, that as they would not depart the great
City of Sardis without a direct answer, so were they resolved to procure an
accomplishment of their just requests, to the hazard of their lives, and
fortunes.

O Madam, said he, how these brave beginnings, inflamed our souls with new
courages: notwithstanding, we could not choose in some sort, but reflect upon
our own poorness of spirit, or at leastwise dullness in understanding, that
never went about to put in execution what these people propound at present for
their and our advantages.

Truly, replied the Princess Cloria, although I cannot but commend these
peoples understandings, that appear to have some sense and feeling of their
reputations yet must I a great deal more extol their courages, that dare
expose themselves to maintain those small privileges, which by a certain
kind of birthright they have received from their honest and wise ancestors;
when as you of the Nobility, of the contrary, seem altogether stupid in the
apprehension of such honorable rights that appertain to your qualities, left
you by the brave endeavor of your most Noble predecessors: who were at the
first so spleenative indiscreet, in your passions against your Prince (though
without any known cause whatsoever) that you were content to sacrifice your
known own advantages, above the common all people, only that you might but
destroy him and his prerogative; not leaving your selves so much power as to be
able again to recover your own dignities.

These words and reproof of the Princess almost put the Nobleman out of his
tale; but she finding him something out of countenance, encouraged him to the
prosecution of his relation:

Madam, said he, when we had thanked them for their prudent admonition (as we
termed it) what our own duties should have remembered, we presently dismissed
them, with other speeches and promises, that sufficiently contented them for
the instant. After they were gone, I must tell you, we were sent to the other
part of the Senate, sitting in another room distinct from ours; intimating we
desired some conference with them, whereby the people might be rendered
satisfied in their seeming just demands: upon our meeting, many things were
propounded to that purpose, as well concerning our selves as the soldiers; but
what will be the issue of these proccedings, for my part I am not able to
divine: only we are informed, that the multitude will not depart from the City
of Sardis, until they have received such answer, as may in some sort give
content to their thoughts: which either must settle the Kingdom in a probable
posture for peace and quietness, or so inflame the Armies resolutions, that
they will endeavor to become masters of the whole. With these words he
abruptly took his leave, as if his apprehensions had been transported only by
imaginary conceits.

As soon as the Lord had quitted the garden, and the rest of the attendance
being also removed some distance from them, the Princess, Ascanius and Roxana,
began to fall upon considerations and discourses of the Kings affairs:
sometimes their hopes were carried to assure themselves, that it was
unpossible, but those confusions must needs produce effects to that purpose;
since, as they believed, the soldiers of the Senate could not long agree, and
then the common peoples desires of necessity would again bring him into his
Throne: for they imagined, that however there might be obstacles and
contentions for the present, in regard of the extraordinary power of the army,
yet the soldiers at the last could not but admit of a King, more willingly
then any other General of their own rank to command over them: besides they
doubted not, but the Nobility, and the City of Sardis would join together to
establish Euarchus in the same honor and dignity as he was in before these
late troubles; since the consequences had already not a little impoverished the
whole Kingdom, and what it would do further if it should continue, might very
well be feared, though as yet not certainly known; In that the dignity of a
Court probably, would as well confirm the one in their hereditary privileges,
as enrich the others by traffic and commerce; seeing it was chiefly the
better sort of persons, that took off the commodities of the Merchants.

These pleasant apprehensions invited them all three to take some delight, in a
certain beautiful and refreshing Grote, encompassed round about by an
intricate Labyrinth, or Wilderness of flourishing Trees, that shaded it
sufficiently from the eyes of people: in the midst thereof there was a
Fountain upon the borders, in which was contrived many sorts of Chaces by
dogs and huntsmen; who by the turning of several artificial Cocks, seemed
not only to move in prosecution of their prey, but the hounds with open
mouths barked and made a noise. The prettiness of the conceit, for a long
space gave young Ascanius sufficient content: when they were weary of beholding
of this invention, they went to the viewing of other rarities. There they might
behold Andromeda, with the Sea Monster, coming out of the water to devour
her, whilst her sorrowful parents stood upon the bordering shore, to behold
that woeful and lamenable Tragedy, occasioned as they thought by the too much
severity and cruelty of the gods, until Perseus the son of Dane, that was
courted in a shower of Gold by Jupiter, descended from the skies upon his
flying horse, and seemed to rescue the distressed Lady. There were also to be
seen in that place, diverse Artificers, working in their Trades, only by the
force and current of the water: in like manner, others playing upon several
kinds of Instruments, both delightful to the ear, and pleasing to the
apprehension. Besides, Birds of all species, made of Glass and other
materials, that seemed to chirpe in a natural way, though only so contrived
by the mere invention of men, to give the greater satisfaction to luxurious
sense. After they had as it were glutted their contemplation with these
delightful vanities, the Princess Cloria being better skilled then her brother
in the use of such devices, suddenly turned one of the pip^s, which quickly
overspread young Ascanius, with a large Canopy of Water, that resembled a
plentiful, though sweet shower from the heavens, in so much as he knew not at
the instant, how to wind himself out of the inconveniency, until he was
forced to entreat his sisters favor for his redemption; neither did she
altogether afford him that grace, since he became a little wet to purchase a
convenient experience against another time. But Roxana, as if she thought her
Mistress had used something too much severity toward her young brother, began
a needless apology for the action, when she might have known Ascanius could
not be displeased at any thing his sister did. When they had as it were dwelt
long enough upon these watery pleasures, they again returned into their own
lodgings, in which place the metamorposed maid was most careful to observe
those decorums that belonged to her office, and attendance, least the contrary
might have occasioned the endangering of his discovery: where they remained, I
may say, entertaining themselves sometimes with hopes, and sometimes with
fears, until the dwarfes return brought them more certain intelligence, of
many passages both from Sardis and other Regions: however because they desired
to understand his information, in the most methodicall way, in regard the
circumstances as they apprehended, would give a great light to the intentions
on foot, they wished him to tell his story and adventures in order, which he
performed in this manner.

After said he, I parted from this Castle, according to your command I went to
the very door of the Senate House, the best place as I thought for
intelligence; where finding all those that stood without in a most confused
distraction, both in their words and looks, it was not long before many of the
chief Senators, of a sudden came out of the room; when presently they went
with a great deal of haste toward another chamber, where I understood by the
discourses of the multitude, they were designed to meet some of the Lords about
a conference, concerning the settlements of the disorders of the Kingdom. I
being both bold, and little, and so consequently as I thought not much to be
suspected, in the confused crowd thrust in along with them, where placing my
self in a nook of the chamber under a hanging it was my chance to hear these
several discourses from them.

The first sort of Senators that spoke, thought it convenient, if not
altogether necessary, again to settle the King in his ancient dignity, not
only in regard of the extraordinary cries of the common people to that
purpose, but also for that there were so many several factions within
themselves in the Senate, not probable to be reconciled, with any advantage to
the Nation: Others notwithstanding were of a contrary opinion, alleging that
it were better to hazard the ruin of the whole Country in a general
confusion, then to come any more under the jurisdiction of that Tyrannical
government, as they said they had with so much blood already endeavored to
destroy: A third number of that assembly, seemed in some sort to be willing to
restore again Euarchus to his Crown in full luster, but they doubted, least
his unrelenting spleen might put him on, to call the S^nate to a strict account
for their past actions, and severity used both against his authority and
person; wherefore wished rather to have some of his posterity Crowned in his
place, whom for such a benefit as they believed, would easily be persuaded to
forgive and forget his fathers injuries: This proposition a long time
entertained their fancies, until they considered, that not only Prince
Arethusius was in the Kingdom of Syria, prosecuting the Queen his Mothers
designs, and my Lord Ascanius his brother had lately by flight procured his
own liberty without their consents, that absolutely beat back any more
discourse upon that subject; however they thought it convenient, if not
extremely necessary for the present, to give what satisfaction they could to
the discontented people, who belike attended in great numbers, about the City
of Sardis to that purpose: yet it was considered with all, that if they should
endeavor altogether to please the multitude, without having their Swords ready
drawn in their hands, whereby to be able to chastize them, if they should
prove too unreasonable in their demands, they must expect dangerous and
insolent affronts, instead of quietness and obedience to their commands: In so
much as they thought it convenient in the interim that they entertained the
peoples expectations, with good words and fair promises, to send privately to
Farezius, wishing him to be ready to march with his Soldiers, to keep the
multitude in due obedience to the Senates authority if they should continue
these extravagant prosecutions of their designs, which in effect being fully
resolved upon by them all, they quickly broake up the Assembly.

So that when they were in this manner dispersed and I had freed my self
undiscovered from their companies, I thought it my duty, to gain what other
intelligence I could amongst the common people, since I conceived, much
consisted in their constant and brave resolutions, to which purpose they seemed
in some sort to have assembled themselves, with an intention to contend against
the present government, by some violent manner of prosecution, though for the
better color of their actions and intentions, they appeared only with
petitions in their hands, instead of other weapons of danger: With these
thoughts I held it my best course to retire into the very heart or body of the
City of Sardis, as well to feel the pulse and constitution of the Inhabitants,
as the likelier to be informed by their intelligence, concerning all other
proceedings of the Kingdom: neither in this design was I much deceived in my
expectation, for sorting my conversation, with wat^rmen and other inferior
people, I understood, that as the rich Citizens of the Town, although they
desire again to have their King to govern over them, though with some
restriction in his power, because they fear his revenge, since otherwise as
they believe, they could probably expect nothing but a general confusion, so
of the other side it is apparent the multitude for the most part desire a
change; not only in regard of the envy they bear to the Senate, who more
absolutely command over their persons and estates then the King ever did in his
greatest glory, but also in regard, they doubt the Soldiers at the last, will
come to be Masters of every man's fortune; which jurisdiction of all others,
they most detest in their natures and dispofitions: As I was sufficiently
satisfied in these inclinations of the people, I repaired to the public place
of commerce for the whole City, where (in short) amongst the Merchants I
understood, that not only a great part of the Navy was revolted to the King
(the Mariners being encouraged thereunto by some Senators which Farezius the
General had formerly sent into banishment) but that the Myssians were also
preparing a great Army, by the directions of the Kingdom of Syria, suddenly to
invade Lydia, on the Kings behalf. These news giving my endeavors sufficient
encouragement, still to prosecute my design, for other intelligences, within
three or four days afterward, I became certainly informed, that the Senate
being not able, or at leastwise not willing to give the multitude satisfaction,
according to the desire of their petitions, they had in great numbers not only
taken up arms for their own defense, in regard they understood that Farezius
had directions, notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords, to march toward
their assemblies with all his power, but they had also seized upon many Castles
and Towns, toward their enterprise and assistance in the Kings name; with whom
in like manner many of the Nobility join with considerable Forces. Last of all,
you may be pleased to know, That Hercrombrotus, Lieutenant General to
Farezius, is of a sudden called away with a great part of the Army, toward the
confines of Lydia, near the City of Smyrna, occasioned by reason of the revolt
of some of his own Commanders, who are joined with the power and force of the
Country to oppose the Senates proceeding: which in effect is the full
information I can give concerning my employment.

When the Dwarf had made an end of this relation, the Princess Cloria smiled
upon her brother, not only to see how well the boy had performed his office,
according to the confidence her Governesse Roxana had in his wit and fidelity;
but withal in regard of the inward joy she felt concerning the King her
fathers affairs, that seemed now to be in a better posture then they were,
almost since the beginning of his troubles: for she imagined by the
consequences, his subjects would be constrained for their own advantages, to
place him again in his Throne, in a higher capacity of power then before.
Ascanius of the other side, expressed also by his countenance the like
gladness, in so much as after a little space, as if he had been in a manner
transported with thoughts of delight and satisfaction, according to his
youthful conceptions, that were apt enough to entertain all Ideas of content
and felicity, presently run to his sister, and whilst both his arms were cast
about her neck, he sealed, as well his affection as his joy upon her Ruby lips,
by a multitude of sweet though more dear kisses: but she at last, either
something apprehending the too much importunity of such affections, or else
desirous to inform her self better of other particulars, told her brother in a
jesting way, that as she could scarce dispense with the rigid rules of her own
modesty, to have her virgin lips so assaulted, although it were from an
affectionate brother, whose innocent virtue was beyond all possibility of
scandal, so did she of the other side exceedingly wonder, that his own change
of condition, which only procured his safety, under the protection of the
Castle, where for the present they remained, had not wrought in his disposition
contrary effects, to that quality wherein he was born, since now he was to
esteem himself rather a servant to fortune, then a Prince by extraction: not a
Prince, replied Ascanius? the gods defend, I should ever harbor in my breast
such poor and unworthy thoughts, notwithstanding the injustice or malice of
any fortune whatsoever: no sister, be you assured, that both for your sake and
my own, I shall always endeavor by my actions, to show that I am son to
Euarchus and Hyacinthia, and I doubt not but you will do the like concerning
your own particular: But yet, replied the sweet Princess, we are obliged in
some sort to yield to our fates, when we have not means sufficient left us to
prevent them; for if the Senate, by a certain kind of a tyrannical power
granted them by the heavens (perhaps only in correction of our offenses) do
imprison and circumscribe our persons, what matters of consequence can our
minds afford us to our advantage in such exigencies? O say not so, answered
Ascanius; for the mind is able to be a noble conqueror over all unfortunate
disasters; since in my youthful studies I have read of many brave persons,
that in the highest expressions of tyranny, and afflictions imposed upon their
bodies, by their worst and greatest enemies, have at last in despite of all
their cruelty, born away the only palm and Laurel of victory; as it were
confounding their very perfecutors, with the extraordinary constancy of their
own sufferings. These, said Cloria, I must conf^sse are brave resolutions in
words, if they can be as well practiced by actions: for I must tell you, that
flesh and blood cannot easily put off all natural inclinations; though I will
not deny, but the soul may do miracles, being aided by divine considerations;
and oftentimes has demonstrated wonderful effects, merely out of some
extraordinary sense, or inflammation of honor, both by Soldiers and
Philosophers. Truly, said Ascanius, then it were very hard, being Kings
children, if we should not in our proceedings meet with some of these faculties
to our benefit; when as perhaps contemptible slaves in former ages have
abundantly exampled to our knowledge and edification, such heroical suffering.

As they were thus discoursing, Roxana, who had for a long space kept a most
formal and grave silence, thought it also convenient to show her own wisdom;
the rather, since her years and experience, pretended to a certain kind of
prerogative amongst those of the younger sort of people. Truly, said she, as I
cannot deny, but that this extraordinary courage you mention, is of a singular
benefit to many sorts of people, in their pressing and difficult occasions; yet
when with a wise (though not a base) compliance, we can avoid both the
inconvenience and hazard to our selves, with more ease and no dishonor, I see
no reason, why we should go about to strain nature to no purpose? especially
if we be not well assured to gain a beneficial victory by the contention; And
if we fail in that we seem to undertake, we contract thereby a further
mischief and disreputation to our selves, then if we had not at all offered to
contend against power and oppression at the first: besides oftentimes those
resistances in the dark shall never come truly to the knowledge of the world,
so that consequently we fail then of that glory, our foolish and preposterous
ambition aimed at by such resolutions: by which means we shall be rather
enterpreted to be blown up with vainglorious fumes, then seasoned with true
fortitude: In time the best mixture must be so to moderate our actions, that as
precipitately we put not our selves upon vain and needless sufferings, without
necessity, so ought not we too much to yield to the inconstant strokes of
fortune and oppression, when either honor or religion calls us to a public
demonstration of our bravery and courage. But however these disputatious might
either confirm Cloria, or convert her brother, yet Ascanius finding the
opportunity, for his own desired employment in the Kings affairs, he resolved
as soon as possible he could, to seek occasion for his own speedy departure;
which did not a little afflict the considerations of his sweet sister the
Princess Cloria, who began to contract a most singular delight in the witty
conversation of her dear brother. Nevertheless she resolved not to be so
great a friend to her own passions, as to become thereby an enemy to his
honor, and her fathers prosperity: so that this being after some consultation
determined on all sides, Ascanius intended in some new disguise, like a boy
belonging to the Navy, to steal privately away to sea, under the protection of
those officers that might afford him the convenience, to repair to those ships
that had revolted from the Senates service

FINIS.
