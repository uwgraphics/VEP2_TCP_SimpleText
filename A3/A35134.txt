A True and Faithful TESTIMONY CONCERNING John Samm, The Servant of the LORD,
Who finished his Course, by laying down his life in NORTHAMPTON GOAL, FOR THE
TRUTH of JESUS, The 26th of the 1st. Month, 1664.

Written by John Crook, who had perfect knowledge of him from the beginning.

With an Exhortation unto all the Righteous, to be watchful, to take due notice
of all the dealings of the Lord, especially of his taking away (of late) so
many faithful Laborers in his Work; and to you principally in the Counties of
Bedfordshire, (where his outward dwelling was) Bucks, Hertford, Cambridge,
Huntington, Ely, and Northampton, is this Testimony sent, who have partaked of
his Ministry, and been refreshed with the streams of Life, that often run
through him among you, to whom my Soul sends Greeting, and wishes unto you
all Love, Life, Mercy, and Peace. Amen.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1664.

A True and Faithful Testimony concerning John Samm, the Servant of the Lord,
who finished his Course, by laying down his life in Northampton Goal, for the
Truth of Jesus, the 26. of the 1st. Month, 1664.
DEarly Beloved of the Lord, although many of you are not ignorant of the
departure of John Samm, out of the body, and for what cause he was in outward
bonds, (which was for meeting with the servants of the Lord) and what his Life
and Conversation was, together with the Ministry committed to him by the Lord,
as well as his faithful discharge thereof, is well known unto you; and I might
be silent if this were the only end, to tell you of these things; for is there
such a stranger in Israel, among you all, as knows them not: But
notwithstanding, I have a Testimony in my heart from the Lord on this behalf,
and do desire it may find acceptance with you, to stir up your pure minds, to
be sensible of all the Lords dealings with you in your own particulars, and
also of his providence and disposings of those, that are near and dear unto
you all, as I know this Servant of the Lord J. S. was, unto all that thoroughly
knew him, and had inward acquaintance with him.

For his Education, it is well known in Bedfordshire where he dwelt; as also
his Conversation, which was just and honest among men, before he was convinced
of the Truth; for the sake of which he suffered five or six times Imprisonment
several times together, for bearing testimony to the same Truth which at last
he sealed with his life in Northampton Goal, where he first suffered
Imprisonment, about the year 1656. in which prison he ended his days, as he
foretold, saying, Northampton was the first, and will be the last.

For his Life and Conversation, I can speak to it, for I was perfectly
acquainted with him, both outwardly as a man, and inwardly as a Christian; as a
man, he was endowed with a competent measure of understanding, and did improve
it, unto that end (in the managing of the Creation) for which it was given him;
being discrete, sober, and of good report among men, and his carriage courteous
and loving unto all; much more might be said of this nature which I omit.

And as a Christian, he was holy and harmless, patient and meek, valiant and
bold, contending earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the
Saints, and in which he himself as a Saint, did walk, live and dye:
Christianity to him, was not a talk, but a life; for rather then he would deny
it, he suffered loss of Estate, Liberty, and Life it self, as he did: Witness
his often Imprisonment, and his laying down his life at last for the same Cause.

As a Minister, he had a dispensation of the Gospel committed unto him, in
which he was a faithful labourer in the work thereof, with great zeal and
fervency of Spirit, taking all opportunities and occasions in the wisdom of the
Lord, (as moved by him) to deliver his message unto all people, of all estates
and degrees, that he might be free from the blood of all men.

His gift was large, his utterance plain to be understood, his words savoury
and powerful, not painted with man's wisdom, but as given him of the Lord, being
often spoken with great Majesty, and in much Authority, cutting deep to the
wounding of the wicked one in man, and easing of the poor and needy prisoner,
being often mindful of the Captive Daughter of Sion, as of the pure Seed in
deep Captivity, that he might reach it help; and when his words began to reach
it, he was as one transported with joy; and when it was once raised and come
forth of the prison house, the Song of Moses and of the Lamb was in his mouth,
with much joy and great gladness of heart, unto the astonishment of the wicked,
and filling the hearts of the righteous with great joy, through the
overflowings of his Cup, and superaboundings of Gods love in his heart;
sometimes as one taken out of the body; in which state his eyes would sparkle,
and his face be full of dread, as one having authority, and not as the Scribes:
Besides the melody of his voice, sometimes sounding out the high praises of the
God of Isr^el, and at other times the blessed state of the righteous, as they
stood in Union with the living God, and one with another. Oh how have I seen
him make the earth to tremble, and the hearts of the upright to overflow with
joy and gladness, through that abundance of life that has run through his
Vessel unto the forcing of water out of the Rocks, and tears out of the eyes of
the Saints, unto great abundance: His Hymns and Sounds, sometimes were as
flames of fire, consuming the drossy matter, and at other times as Swords and
Spears, cutting down, and thrusting through the tall Cedars, and lofty Oaks,
and wild Beasts of the wilderness: Procuring an Echo to the true Seed in the
living babes, which often made sweet melody in their Assemblies, when but few
words were spoken by him: Methinks I hear his Instrument still sound,
Making the hearts of the just to abound
With living praises to the God of Heaven,
Without one jarring string or voice un-even:
Though this seems strange to those that dwell below,
Yet what I speak, I feel and well do know;
And look for more to be brought forth ere long,
In those that yet are learning the Lambs song.


An Exhortation unto all the Righteous, especially those that were partakers of
John Samms Ministry.
DId Joseph seek a place where to weep over Benjamin his Brother, though yet
alive? And can ye, Oh ye Sons and Daughters of Joseph, refrain from mourning
for the loss of a Father to many children, whom he had begotten in the Lord?
And is there a time when the true Ambassador of Peace may weep bitterly? Oh can
it be more seasonable at any time, then when the Lord takes away the Righteous
from the evil to come? And has he not done so to many Valiants of late, whose
Trumpets Alarmed the World, and made many dead to arise at the sound thereof?
What was the cause, and wherefore the Lord has done it, becomes every one to
make enquiery in their own hearts; and the rather, because there is need, yea
great need, of Valiants in this day, the Harvest being great, and the Laborers
few. And why the Lord should lessen the number, seems to challenge a diligent
enquiery, at every ones hand, to find out the cause thereof; And let me stir ye
up, oh all ye that love the Lord, to search every own his own heart with the
light of Jesus; And for this, let my Harp also be turned to mournings, and my
Organ into the voice of them that weep; For indeed I will tell you, oh ye
Children of my Father, my Soul has deeply considered this matter; And I have
this Answer, the Lord will do what pleases him, with the Instruments of his
choosing, and who has been his Counselor? He will raise up, and lay a side at
pleasure; for he will have no Idols of jealousy in this his day, least it come
to pass, as when he made the brazen Serpent, a Nehushtan: Neither will he have
his work neglected, nor his Servants slighted, whom he sends forth in Life and
Power; He would have his People to wait upon him, in their own measures, every
one as they have received, in it to keep close unto him, that they all may be
taught of him, and have the rejoycings in themselves, and not in another: And
the Lord will yet raise up Instruments to fulfill his purpose, for his work
shall prosper; and by all these ways and dealings of his, he would have his
Childrens Hearts made loose to all things under the Sun, with their Lamps
burning, and lights shining, having the loins of their minds girt about with
the Girdle of Truth; keeping close unto the Lord with a pure heart, that he may
yet further make known unto them his mind and will; for although you are now
become the Sons of God, it does not yet appear what ye shall be; but this know,
the more and oftener ye see him, the liker to him ye shall be; and let this be
your care, that he may be always before you, that you may not be moved: And my
dear friends, keep low in your minds, and delight to be often in the deeps with
God: Oh watch, I even beseech you all as dear Brethren, that by the Lords
taking away of his Servants of late, that have been blessed Instruments in his
hands, you may come the nearer unto that Teacher, and hear his voice daily,
which cannot be removed into a corner; that ye may all say in truth of heart,
we are come unto that Ministry which cannot be taken away by reason of death;
Oh that you may all feel more of this Ministry in your Assemblies daily, and
keep in that seed of life, where you live with the spirits of those just men,
whose bodies are removed from you: Indeed I feel, I feel the Lord mightily at
work in this his day, be but still, and you will see his wonders in the days
past: Let love abound among you as at the beginning, and be pure and clean in
heart, and you will see by all Gods dealings, what he aims at, which is
certainly, to raise up his own life in you all, over all the world, unto his
own praise, and your joy for ever: And all you that are sensible of the taking
away of dear J. S. as being often refreshed by his life, and comforted through
his Ministry, sink ye down, sink, ye down into the fountain, from whence he
has all his supplies, and drink ye of the same, blessing the Lord that the
fountain is in Christ the promised Seed, unto whom feel your daily access: Oh
ye beloved of the Lord, and say in your hearts with my soul, O God, it is
enough that we have thy self to go unto, and that we can in thy life enjoy
communion with the spirits of the just ones; And lift up your heads over all
the world, and be not dismayed with any amazement, either inward or outward,
for your Redeemer lives, and your Ransomer will not tarry; and you that are
full of sorrow, by reason of your temptations and trials, which are many, and
that your own strength is so small; I say unto you all, lift up your heads: For
you that cannot live without Christ, but feel your daily need of him, He will
not, not, not, leave you nor forsake you, for thou art the true heir of him,
that cannot live without him, to thee he will come, and will not tarry; and in
the mean time, as a good Soldier endure the hardship: It is but yet a little
while, and he will appear without sin unto thy souls Salvation: For I ^eel
thee, and do travail for thee.

Oh thou well beloved! how are my cries unto my God for thee, who laments in
thy spirit for want of the Lord, and can hardly be persuaded of his love to
thee; thou art so uncomely in thine own eyes, and thou look upon his
dealings, both within, in thy Spirit, and without, in his taking away those
instruments whom thou love, and by whom thou wast refreshed, as being in
wrath against thee, and for thy sake: Well I know thee, and am to testify unto
thee, in mine and thy Fathers Name, that he does behold thee, and his eyes do
pity thee, and he is waiting to be gracious unto thee, that in an acceptable
time he may commend his love unto thee, and thy Salvation is sure; Oh thou
traveling Soul, and I could even put my Soul in thy Souls stead to ease thee a
little.

Well, my cries are for thee, and it is prayed that thy faith fail not; So unto
our God give up, and when thou art sinking as to the bottom of sorrow, there
is a hand to support thee, and thou will feel it in the lowest dungeon, and
darkest deep. Be thou still, and my God will be thy Interpreter, to let the sea, know, and understand thy state and condition; with whom I leave thee, in
that bosom where Lazarus dwells safely, and at rest, when Dives is tormented,
and has not one drop of that mercy with which thou art filled, to the praise
of our God for ever. Amen.

The free flowings forth of my pure soul to J. S. whose Decease I do condole as
follows.
OH thou Valiant, was thy time so bounded,
That death had no power (till thou had sounded*)
To stop thy voice, or hinder thy sweet life,
From thoroughly conquering black envyes strife:
Well, well, It is enough what thou have done,
Who in thy day with patience did run
The race of the nobly descended,
And would not be stopped till life was ended:
What? Shall I speak thy commendation,
Or tell thy loss by lamentation;
To neglect the first, seems to injure thee,
And to pass by the last is so to me,
As well as to many brethren more,
Who for thee can scarce refrain to weep sore;
So then I must speak something to thy fame,
Who as a Minister wast made a flame,
To kindle the spark that in Ember lay
Raked up all night, in dark until the day;
Whose light shined clearly in thy holy breast,
As all that knew thee well must needs attest,
As I my self (for one) can truly say,
That light in thee shined clear as perfect day,
To the enlightening many with thy sun,
Whose feet before in darkness fast had run;
For who could withstand thy life, Oh dear John!
And not to thy words bow, or else be gone;
So powerful at times was thy sweet voice,
That to be in thy presence was my choice;
And besides thy comforting of them that mourned,
Many from darkness, to daylight was turned;
All sorts of men by thee received good,
For thou wast washed from sin, with Jesus blood;
Which made thy Journey Peace, and thy end gain,
In despite of death, and all outward pain,
Which was not a little in that noisome place,
But that life over all did thee embrace;
While thou lived, thy life made many tremble,
And in thy death, who can thee resemble?
Both for the patience which in thee dwelt,
As also for those sounds which many felt,
Flow from thee, like sweet streams of quickening life,
Which often in others have ceased strife;
And made great Babylon to tremble sore,
As well as the Scarlet and painted Whore,
Against whom he warred as a valiant man,
And did not cease till his strength was gone;
Which lasted till his breath began to fail,
For while he had any, he would not veil,
But kept his ground, and stoutly made it good,
And sealed at last, the conquest with his blood;
In that prison, where he at first was cast
For the same cause, for which he breathed his last:
Oh dear John, while I Am speaking of thy praise,
I am as one dazzled with the bright rays
Of that heavenly glory which Crowns thy soul,
From whence I cannot get thee to condole,
But a voice within me cries, Be thou gone
Out of thy vessel, and wear the same Crown;
Well I come, O God, with what speed I may,
Help me to finish the work of my day;
For haste I do, with all my strength and might,
Out of this house of clay to take my flight:
I come, I come, my work is almost done,
It Is finished so soon as this storm is gone;
Let the winds blow loud, and rain fall hard,
And the Seas roar, and waters swell a pace,
But thy great works O God do not retard,
Till thou become thy peoples dwelling place;
Let Judas do with speed, what he is to do,
That true friends may be known from deadly foe;
And thy Jewels made up in sight of all,
And that they which four thee, no more may fall;
But that the holy, may be holy still,
And no destroyer on all thy holy Hill:
But whither am I going in such haste?
Is the blessed day at hand for this great feast?
Methinks my heart is silled with great joy
To behold this good day so very nigh.
While many like the Prophets servant say,
With us it is night, but with the enemies day;
That Is because, the eyes not opened to see
Jehovahs strength, which is greater for me
Then all the world, or death and hell beside,
Which to them is known that in light abide;
Times and seasons are in the Fathers hand,
And let them fear who build upon the sand:
But my soul sees the work already done,
Which is the throwing down of Babylon
The great, into woe, grief, and constant pain,
There to lie, and never to rise again;
How can I now any longer withhold,
From condoling for him, that was so bold
To bear his testimony for the Lord
Against Babylons ways, by him abhorred;
Who like David's worthies, brake through the host
To refresh the thirsty, and find the lost,
And such a one was he of whom I speak,
Let the sense of Truths great loss, your hearts break;
For many such Soldiers are not behind,
Whose ease, estate, and life, could not him bind
From ventring all in Gods righteous cause,
Unto the end for which he valiant was,
In liberty, in bonds, in life, in death:
Oh how faithful was he until last breath;
He stood fast against all that did gainsay,
None being able to turn his mind away;
Saying often from his heart, in true love,
And zeal unto Gods ways, and precious dove;
(Meaning the Seed alone without a mate,)
Mind the poor and needy in all your breasts,
Which mourns alone, while crafty souls have nests;
And foxes have their holes to hide their heads,
It often wak't when others slept in beds;
His care was still, that it might live and reign,
That nothing might it is Fathers love restrain;
Was not this that love the Lambs ought to have
From true Pastors, who seek their sheep to save;
Yes, yes, and such are after Gods own heart,
That to save the sheep, they would feel the smart;
Methinks I feel his life, and hear his hymn;
Hark, hark, does it not make the babe to singe,
In those that remember his dwelling place?
Wast not in great peace over all disgrace?
Heeding nothing more then to be with God,
As his dwelling place from all stroke and rod;
Well, have ye thither, all ye chosen Flock,
That ye may dwell with him on Sions Rock;
In the dear Seed, where still he lives with you
In that union, where they are no more two,
But one with him, and me, and all in life,
And so your loss is gain, and end of strife;
Unto which life with him, God bring us all,
Where the loss is repaired to great and small.
Well dear John, with thee is my soul at rest,
For now I feel thou dwell within my breast;
Feel ye the same, ye dearest Lambs of love,
For he is a mate to thee thou loansome Dove;
And ye sweet children of your father dear,
Both inward and outward be of good cheer;
Your Father lives, and so shall do for aye,
Let his Counsel be embraced, and obey;
So shall all be made up in safety and peace,
With sweet gain to your souls, and good increase,
Where our home is, who dwell and rest in life
Far from all sorrow, out of all bate and strife
In one house, where we all have our bread sure;
Feed, seed ye babes, for it will still endure:
Farewell dear babes, and with our Father dwell
At home in God, with us, in spite of hell.
And thus to him, and you, I have paid my debt,
And to all the upright that with us met;
I take my leave, and rest in that, Amen,
After whom, the just cries, how long? when, when?
By John Crook, now Prisoner in Ipswich Town-Goal for the same cause, for which
dear J. S. laid down his life*
written the 7th of the 2d. Month, 1664.
FRiends in the Counties beforementioned, or where this may come, This is my
Testimony which I had in my heart to bear for that faithful man John Samm, who
was a Minister and sufferer for the Truth of Jesus, who has now finished his
Testimony in faithfulness, a prisoner in Northampton; by me who for some years
have had a right knowledge of him, and his integrity and faithfulness to Gods
eternal Truth, of which he was made partaker: He was a man of a sound mind, and
of an upright heart, a lover of righteousness, and hating iniquity; Him the
Lord was pleased to choose, with the first in the County of Bedford, who made
him sensible of the living word in his heart, by which the Lord brought him to
know the work of Redemption, who Redeemed him out of the worlds ways and
worships, and brought him to Truth in the inward parts, which truth he knew to
be powerful, which set him free from much which did entangle him, and feeling
the power of it, the Lord chose him to bear testimony in words unto it, which
he received not of man, nor by man, but of the free gift from the Lord, and
when he had received it, to wit, the Truth in the inward parts, and his mind to
it turned, then did he feel the sweet streams of the Lords love to his thirsty
soul, by which his heart was often filled with joy and great rejoicing; and
also the Lord in the strength of his Love, and in the sense of the living
virtue of his life, did open his mouth in praises to the Lord, to the great
refreshment and comfort of his children, who were begotten by the same word of
power unto the feeling of the life by which he was filled; many times as a Cup
that overflowes: and a good understanding had the Lord given him of the
mysteries of his Kingdom, and of those things which he had heard, learned, and
received of the Lord in the light of his Son, that did he faithfully
communicate unto others, in the demonstration of the Spirit of God, in season,
and out of season, without respect of time, place, or person; yea, prosperous
was he made in the hand of the Lord, to the convincing of many in the Counties
where he travel^ed, and to the turning of many from darkness to light, from
Satan's power to God; and a good instrument (he was) of comfort to the tempted
ones, and a refresher of the weak ones, and a confirmer of the tender hearted
in that present Truth which they had received; and these words would run
through him often, saying on this wise, As every one has received Christ the
Light, so let him walk in it: And he was also a man full of love, and very
zealous for the Lord, but not without knowledge; for a living sense he had of
the heavenly power of God, by which he was filled many times, as with new Wine;
and would often say, Who is able to contain of this heavenly Virtue, and not
praise the Name of the Lord: And the Lord, his Truth and People, was dear unto
him, for whose sakes he often suffered Imprisonment, and spoiling of his goods;
and did rather choose to suffer affliction upon Truths account, with the people
of the Lord, then to enjoy the pleasures of this life for a season; or sin
against the light of Christ Jesus, which did shine in his heart, and give him
the knowledge of the Glory that is Eternal; for the enjoyment of which, this
world and it is glory, was of little value to him; and both in prison, and out
of prison, the Lord did accompany him with his heavenly presence, and many
times fill him with the virtue of his life, by which his heart was engaged to
the Lord. These things I can boldly speak of him, having a right knowledge of
him, being once cast into prison with him, because we could not break the
command of Christ, in sinning against his Ligat, which said in us, Swear not
at all, according as is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth; for which at that
time we suffered eighteen weeks Imprisonment, with many more of the servants of
the Lord, who kept the Commandments of God, and had the Testimony of Jesus; and
our hearts was knit together, even as Jonathans was to David; and as Iron
sharpeneth Iron, so did the Lord by the manifestation of his love and life in
our hearts, cause us often to refresh each other. Well, what might I speak my
Friends, in Truth, of our deceased Brother, who fainted not unto the end, who
has now finished his Course, and made not Shipwreck of Faith and a good
Conscience, but has kept the Faith, and in it is fallen asleep; and now his
bodily presence we here no more shall see, bu^ his life is amongst us, and is
felt with the faithful; for while it was contained in that narrow compass, he
would often say, There Is no straitness in the Lord, but the straitness is of
man: And he would say, How does one drop from the presence of the Lord, cause
the Cup to overflow; saying, Who is able to contain of the exellent streams of
Life, and not praise the living God. On Friends, amongst whom he traveled, feel
his life among you, and remember his labor of love, for the labor of the
Righteous tends to life; and for this end did he travail, labor, and suffer
to death, as a valiant in Israel, that many might be made partakers of the like
precious faith, which he knew to overcome and to give victory, and to preserve
him to the Lord, that so being made partake^s of the riches of Gods grace,
rejoicing in themselves, they might witness this was the earnest desire of his
Soul; surely the memorial of the Righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance, but the name of the wicked shall ^ot: So this is my testimony on
the behalf of that valiant man, who counted not his life dear to himself, that
he might finish his course with joy.

And now dear Friends and Brethren, whom the Lord has called in this the day
of his mighty Power, and has made you partakers of his Divine nature, and has
caused the windows of Heaven to open, and has shoured down of the ^ertue of
his life upon you, and ye who have often sent the ^weet influences of the
Fathers love unto your souls; be not over much troubled at this our loss, but
feel his life among you, for affliction comes not out of the dust, neither
does trouble spring out of the ground, yet man is born to trouble, as the spark
fly upward, as says Job, but the Lord is the support and deliverer of the
Righteous; and he is their present help in the needful time, who brings them to
their expected end in peace, as he has this our friend, in a good age, like as
a shock of Corn comes in, in it is sea on.

And now ye children of the Lord, born of the same birth, wait ye for the
streamings forth of the Lords love into all your souls, that you may be as
channels, or as water courses, through which the Lord causes the water of life
to run, that you may not only be comforted in your selves, but may have
wherewithal to comfort others; keep in the tenderness and love one to another,
as children of one Father; all sucking at the same breasts of Consolation, by
which the Lords people in all a^e were consolated, that ye may grow up together
as trees of Righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that a blessing in his
hand ye may be, and by his living power, to the end ye may be preserved, to the
glory and to the praise of the Lord: This as a testimony for that servant of
the Lord J. S. whom I dearly loved, with a short Salutation of love, to the
children of the first born,

The 7th of the 2d. Month, 1664. By one who suffers for the same Testimony, for
which our Brother laid down his life; P^is^ner in the Town Goal of Ipswich in
Suffolk, your Friend THOMAS GREEN.
