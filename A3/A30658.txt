A COMMENTARY ON ANTONINUS HIS ITINERARY, OR JOURNIES Of the ROMAN EMPIRE, so
far as it concerns BRITAIN: WHEREIN The first Foundation of our Cities,
Laws, and Government, according to the Roman Policy, are clearly discovered;
whence all succeeding Ages have drawn their Original. The ancient Names of
their Garrisons within this Island are restored to the Modern, with their Site,
and true distances; Their Military Ways, and Walls; with many Antiquities,
Medalls, Inscriptions, and Urnes, are recovered from the ruin of Time.

A Work very useful for all Historians, Antiquaries, Philologists, and more
particularly for the Student of the LAWS.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, JOHN Lord GLYN, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of
Upper-Bench.
MY LORD,
I Esteem my self happy that before my Journey to another World, (which I
foresee, I am shortly to undertake) I have in readiness to present to your
Lordship ANTONINUS his ITINERARY through BRITAIN: Not that I conceive the
Present of that Worth that your Lordship can be much concerned in it; but that
I am able to leave some Testimony behind me, of my Gratitude and Observance,
which you (my Lord) may challenge by so many Names: for, not to mention the
particular favors conferred on my self, I can never think on those you have
bestowed on my near Relations, without the highest Sentiments of a grateful
Heart. Nor ought I to forget the happiness I enjoy by my Interest in our
National Rights (though a poor Proletarian) under the prudent Administration
of your Lordship; who like another Papinian (whose Story this Work affords)
may be justly styled Spartian. in Caracalla.
Juris Asylum and doctrinae Legalis Thesaurus. That I might testify my
Obligations after this sort, I have been encouraged from the Nature of the
Subject, which is a piece of Antiquity, and that no sterile piece (such as too
many are employed on) but such as may serve to illustrate the History of our
Nation; which I take to be a study most proper to the Lawyer. In Praefat.
Inflit.
Dr. Cowel tells us, that the Common Law of England, is nothing but a mixture
of the Roman Civil Law, with some feue^all customs; and though this Discourse
professes not to teach ought of that Law, yet it contains the Story of the
whole Roman Government here, which lasted near CCCLX. years, and a diligent
Student surely may hence gather some particulars that may give light to our
present Laws; and therefore it was, without doubt, that Mr. Seldom in that
Janus Anglorum.
Book of his, where he sets down the Original of our Laws, does not omit the
History of the Roman Times. And if the Lawyer be the fittest student, who can
be so apt a Patron as your Lordship, who is the Father of the Law? For mine own
performance herein, it is a Commentary that has cost me many years study, and
I may, without breach of modesty, say, it has been approved by him, then whom
in this or any kind of Phylologie no man knew more; yet do I not recommend it
as an object of your Lordships study, which I well know is conversant about
matters of a higher pitch, but only pray that under your Patronage and
Protection, it may come into the hands of the Lovers of Antiquity, and
particularly of the Students of the Law; And though this stranger will not
press upon your Lordships Business and more serious Studies, in which the Good
of so many persons are concerned, yet he craves leave to attend you in your
Circuits and Recesses, where, perchance, he may point to some Monuments of that
glorious Nation, both of Persons and things, not unworthy your observation. The
pleasure of such Contemplations are so great, that Lipsius in Epist. Cent. 1.
Epist. XXII.
Lipsius was not able to express it, Quanti (says he) and quam arcani gaudii
ista visio? Cum non animo solum, sed poene oculis sese inferunt Manes illi
magni and sola premimus pressa toties ipsis. My Lord; the Person that thus
offers his service, is no less then a Roman Or is at least supposed to be the
Emperor Antoninus Pius.
Emperor, to that purpose I have set him forth as like himself as I could, and
better (I may say without ostentation) then he has elsewhere appeared; if not
sufficiently well, the worthiness of his Person may plead my excuse, who, as I
have endeavored to do him due Rites, so had I by doing it in this public
manner no other aim, then to let your Lordship and the World know, that I am

My Lord, Your Lordships most grateful and faithful servant, W. BURTON.

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
THough all Nations have been apt to consecrate their own Originals, and the
History of Brute for that only Reason finds many Favorers; Yet certain it is,
that unto the Romans we owe what ever of Magnificence or Elegancy our Britain
could boast; Namque ut homines disperse ac rudes, eoque bello faciles, etc. For
whereas the Britains were rude and dispersed, and therefore prone to every
occasion of War, Julius Agricola (as Tacitus tells us) to induce them by
pleasures to quietness C. Tacit. in vita Agric.
and rest, exhorted them in private, and publicly assisted them in building
Temples, Palaces, and places of general Commerce; commending the Forward,
checking the Slow, and thereby imposing a kind of necessity, whilst each man
contended to ^nerit Favor from the Lieutenant. Thus were erected those
stupendous Fabrics, the Relics of which, even in their most deformed
Ruins, move Reverence and Astonishment in every Beholder, whilst the Vulgar
celebrate them as the Works of Giants; And the Learned by judicious view and
diligent inquiry restore in great measure the past to the present, and future
Ages. Amongst whom I may presume to say, None has deserved better from the
Lovers of venerable Antiquity, then our laborious Author, whether you consider
the Choice of his Subject, or the manner of his prosecution: For if ever any
thing required the pains of the ablest Antiquary in this Nation, I am
confident all men will determine it to be, a Commentary on Antoninus his
Itinerary: And if any Rules in this kind of writing ought to be preferred, our
Author has certainly made the most prudent choice, comparing the three
notable Editions of Aldus, Simler, and Surita, and by comparison establishing
the truth, correcting every where the errors of Scribes, reconciling, as much
as is possible, various lexions, supplying all copiously (but never
impertinently) with Marginall Annotations; Things familiarlie known, or of
little use when made familiar he lightly passes over, insisting every where on
the more material, and remote from vulgar observation; where certainty is to
be hoped, he discovers and determines; where it is only to be wished, he
guesseth so luckily, and yet so modestly, that ^ou will not readily conclude
whether more to admire the Man, or his Fortune: Proceed then in Your fair
Journey; The Ways are now again repaired and paved (as once by that excellent
^mperour Trajane) Bushes and Brambles rooted up and removed, unfordable Galen
lib 9. cap. 8. Method. medend.
Rivers supplied with Bridges, Fens dreined, Causies cast up in Valleys, the
inaccessable ascent of Hills made easy by winding Paths; which, declining the
Desert and wast ^ountry, lead you through the best inhabited and remarkable
places of the Nation; And wheresoever you find the ruined Fragments of a
Military Station, Temple, Bath, Urne, or Altar, and raise your thoughts to the
contemplation of their Original use and beauty, pay a thankful acknowledgment
to this worthy Person, from whom you received the happy occasion. Who is there
among us that does not reverence the Roman Name? Who is there that bears not an
indulgent fondness to his native Country? This Book then can want no
recommendation to the Gentry of this Island, since no man, though of ordinary
condition, would be thought either illiterate or unnatural: Which I presume to
say in the behalf of this Reverend Gentleman, whose death prevented a more
solemn Preface.

Farewell.

Out of ROBERT TALBOT.
What I have spoken ought to have that consideration and regard, that I might,
as well as I could, declare how much this one little Book ought to be weighed,
and esteemed of, which contains under ANTONINUS AUGUSTUS his Name, the ways
and Iourneys of all the Provinces of the Roman Empire, which yeildeth to us an
income of so wonderful Profit, that it affords most clear light to Strabo,
Pomponius, Mela, Pliny, most excellent Authors in the explication of the whole
World, as it were in great darkness. So far Robert Talbot.

Out of the Preface of the famous man Andrew Schot, set before Antoninu's
Edition of Surita at Coleyn M. DC. IX. Rutilius Whose learnedest Edition is
that of Caspar Barthius.
Numatianus afforded us his Itinerary in Elegiack Verses, but Antonius, or
whether he is Antoninus Augustus in bare name, which in a Land, Journey, and
military way and march, the Roman Captains made use of (of which kind we see
some in Italy and fewer in Spain used by Passengers, where at this day they are
carried on horses which are appointed for speed.) But for Itinerary Tables,
which are very useful in matter of War, Fl. Vegetius is to be seen lib. III.
De re Militari, cap. VI. Of what kind of Military Tables the famous man Mark
Velf^r, one of the seven Magistrates of the Commonwealth of Auspurg, very well
deserving of all Antiquity, lately found out in the Library of Conrade
Peutinger, a noble man there, and also adorned with Scholia's, or Notes. But
Ortelius our friend (the Prince of Geographers) set forth all of it also cut
into Brass; by the Printing of John Moret: in which kind I think nothing of
ancient Monuments to be extant, either to be preferred, or comparable to it.

I can bring nothing of certainty concerning the Writer; Only thus much, That
this Itinerary may seem to be written by some learned Measurer of Land well
acquainted with the places: but afterward who by the command of some Emperor,
it is likely after Marcus Aurelius, Antoninus Pius, for good lucks sake
retained the Surname, and publicly took the name and authority of Antoninus
Augustus; although most old Books have Antonii, perhaps by the usual fault of
the Transcribers, whereby they often confound Constantius and Constantinus.
Jerome Surita a very learned Spaniard, prefers this Work to Antoninus the Son
of Severus, by reason of the mention of certain places of BRITAIN: but
Critiques contend, and the strife is still before the Judge. Now it appears
that such an Itinerary was composed for the Captains and Soldiers with the
Proconsulls and Pretors marching into the Provinces, least they should mistake
their way, and fall into ambushes, mistaking the right way. How necessary these
Itineraries were Fl. Vegetius is the Author, and St. Ambrose in his Sermon upon
the CXVIII Psalm. Now the way did not always lead strait, as at this day, but
wheeling about, yet more beaten and safe, which are called by Ammianus, the
Kings Highway, and the Soldiers way and wonted Journeys. Concerning
Highways, Galen the Prince of Physicians is to be seen lib. IX. cap. VIII.
Methodius and Procopius in the beginning of the second Book, de bello Persico;
He writes: I believe that the City Strata was so called by the Romans from the
Military way which they called Strata. It remains that the account of my
undertaking may appear: for this was principally intended while I searchd forth
the Notes of Jerome Surita, a learned man, upon the Itinerary of That this
Itinerary was composed under the Empire of Antoninus Basiannus the Emperor,
the Son of Severus, in the beginning of the British Iourneys shall be showed,
that I was by conjecture persuaded. But Reader, if thou please, see the very
place.
Augustus, which lay hidden in the dark.

Out of John Annius of Viterbium.
Antoninus Pius Caesar Augustus wrote an Itinerary. Now the Itineraties which
we have now are not Antoninus's, but collected perhaps out of some fragments of
some former, to which many things added, many things diminished, more things
changed: an argument whereof, you have Certain'y Annius means by all this the
confounding of Antoninus with Aethicus, concerning which we have spoken
sufficiently, presently after the beginning of this book.
two Fragments; for the first Fragment, it belongs to the Preface: but to this
which we have in our hands belongs no Preface; besides the common ones use no
miles, which the Italians alone do use. Again, the common ones make use of the
succession of Towns, because you have described all the Journeys of the World
in all Nations: which succession of Towns is without miles, whence it appears
that By all means see Angelus Politians Epistles, one of the first of the first
Book.
Florence was not in the time of Antoninus; by which it appears, that these
vulgar Books are not all of Antoninus, but that there is a great corruption of
the Book by men in after times through addition, and diminution, procured by
private men's doings.

Out of John Leland, Antiquary under Henry the eighth.
Antoninus lived in the times of Constantine the Great, for he mentions
Constantinopolis, Dioclesianopolis, Maximinopolis, so unlikely it is, that
Antoninus the Emperor wrote the Itinerary, which goes about commonly in his
name.

Out of the excellent Doctor Usher in his learned Book which he has Entitled,
De Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Primordiis, page 78.
Hence also in the Itinerary (to which the ordinary Books give the title of
Antoninus Flodoard. Histor. Remenseccles. lib. 1. cap. 1. Thomas
Flodoardus of Aethicus; but the old MS. of Scotus.)

Roma, Romani. Hence came those words Pro. Alastore vel Sicarto a Romany.

Doctor Fulck a singular Ornament in his time, both as a Divine of the
University of Cambridge, and Antiquary, so illustrated this Itinerary, as I was
sometime informed by the Reverend and Learned Primate of Ireland Doctor Usher,
who was also the Author and Occasioner of my undertaking this same Work, as
many, yet living, of good credit, can bear sufficient witness. And for me to
have omitted a man, by whose diligence our Countrymen had the first notice of

A COMMENTARY On the ITINERARY of ANTONINUS Concerning BRITAIN. According to
the Editions of Aldus Manutius, William Harrison, Josias Simler, Jerome Surita,
etc.
ITER BRITANNIARUM.]

which goes commonly under Antoninus Pius, the Emperor's Name (I mean that part
thereof which belongs to BRITAIN) was one Abrah: Ortelio in Synon. Geogr: in

extant, and to be seen by such as can obtain the courtesy.

He then in his Annotations (so he calls them) upon the XVI Britain Iournies,
containing the removes and distances from one Station or Garrison to another,
is displeased with the very Epigraphe or Title before them, wishing for Iter,
to read Itinerarium Britanniarum; and so to make this a distinct piece from the
other before it, which is inscribed, Itinerarium Provinciarum omnium, etc. His
conceit is, that the mistake arose at first from the curtailed writing of the
word IT. which the Calligraphus, or Transcriber might at his pleasure, he
thinks, make Iter, or Itinerarium, or else he conjectures it might have been
written abbreviated ITINER. which some smattering Copyer (it being a word which
did never light in his way) might correct into Iter, although Itiner is a word
used by good Varroni. apud Noa Marcellum and alios.
Authors, and namely by Astronom. l. 1.
Minilius, a Writer in the time of Augustus, and had in high repute with the
Learned, in this Verse. Fecit and ignoti^ Itiner commercia terris.
And Travels, 'twixt strange Lands, fixed mutual Trade.


But in very deed there are some good reasons, which might seem to confirm
this conjecture of his, by which he divides the whole Work into II several
Itineraries. For besides that the Voyages, or Places which they usually
accustomed to touch at in their expeditions by Sea, set down after the
recension of our Britain Stations, have the Inscription of Itinerarium
maritimum, not Iter, for the Britains indeed were generally accounted by the
Romans themselves, during the several Ages they continued Masters of them, to

World. So that the Britains might very well seem to deserve a Notitia, or
Survey, by themselves apart in the Description of the whole World; Nature
having first separated them by the vast, and (sometime thought) (...). Clemens

More I could say by way of enlarging this Argument, but I purposely forbear,
and refer it rather to another place: Only this I add in this behalf, that the
word Iter does not so fitly serve the turn in this place. For first of all
observe, that here it does no way exactly agree with what either the great
Instit: l. 2. tit. 3. ex l. 1. D. rust. praed.
Lawyer, or De L. L. lib: 4.
Varro, make the signification or meaning of the word to be: in the latter of
whom, by the By, I cannot choose but take notice of a Paradiorthosis, or false
emendation of Vertranius in that very place, where he tells us what Iter is,
reading militare iter, for limitare; by which Varro understands nothing else
but a small Path made in the confines of several men's Land, ordered by a Apud
Cicer: de LL. lib: 1.
Law of the XII. Tables, to be not above V. Foot broad. For had he meant those
public Through-fares, or Ways, which the Soldiers raised by uncessant and
toilsome labor, for their more convenient march from Station to Station,
(called by Ammianus and others, Aggeres itinerarii, and actus publici; Histor:
lib: 8.
by Herodian (...), and Stratam, viam latini dicunt. Procop. de bello Persit.
lib. 2. initio V. Sealig: in Auson: lect. l. 2. c. 27. quem vide voce Gla^ea.

militare, but via militaris, the usual word indeed; Via, as Institut: d. l.
Justinian teaches us, containing in it, both iter, and actus; and in ancient
Authors iter militare, is only quantum uno die militari gradu, as Vegetius
speaks, conflci possit, or One days march; by Caesar and others called justum
iter; and by barbarous Writers, Ad S. Gem^am tertia dicta citra Ro^am. etc.

In the second place we may consider, that here are XVI. several Itineraries,
or set marches (not to be expressed by the singular Iter) described from so
many Garrisons to Garrisons, (it is likely of more Ideoque regales, ut videtur,
dicuntar, D. Ambrosio, v. infra.
esteem and concernment) through others perhaps of less note, here also set
down; to signify all which, Itinerarium must needs be thought far the more
proper and significant notion, by them that understand what it means, and know
besides to what excellent purpose such Itineraria were first instituted and
appointed.

For they that are conversant in Antiquities of this nature, cannot but take
notice, that to set down in writing, and likewise publish their particular
Journeys and Marches by the several Camps, Stations, Mansions, and Mutations
(so they were called by the Romans, being places from which, in after ages,
great Towns and Cities took their Originals) was a thing, for diverse useful
respects, always observed amongst the better managed and disciplined Nations;
and it was a business that tended to extraordinary advantage, especially in
great Empires and Dominions. The people of Israel, who had GOD for their Leader
through the Wilderness to the Land of Promise, most heedfully observed this
course in their whole pilgrimage, even from Exodus: 12. 37.
Romeses, the place of their departure out of Egypt, to the very Banks of
Jordan; and that not without the special Commandment Numb; 33. 3, 4. etc. see
chap: 21. 10.
of GOD himself. These are, says Moses, the Iourneys of the people of Israel,
which went forth out of the Land of Egypt, with their Armies under the hand of
Moses and Aaron. And Moses wrote their goings out according to their Iourneys,
by the Commandment of the LORD; and these are their Iourneys according to their
goings out. And then he sets down no less then two and forty Journeys, from the
beginning of the Chapter to the 50. verse, which S. In Epitaph: Fabiola ad
Oceanum.
Ierom calls Catalogum omnium mansionum, per quas de Aegypto egrediens populos
pervenit usque ad fluenta Iordanii. Having passed over Jordan, and under the
Conduct of their victorious General, either destroyed, or dispossessed the
Inhabitants beyond it: Jos: 18. 4, 9.
Three men are appointed out of each Tribe to go through the Land and describe
it. And the men went and passed through the Land, and described it by Cities,
into seven parts in a Book, and came again to Joshua to the Host at Shiloh.

As for the Kings of Persia, we learn from In (...) sive lib: 5.
Herodotus, that they had the distances from Station to Station, exactly set
down through their great and vast Territories. This is to be seen in him by
that accurate enumeration of the several Mansions, from the Sea Coast in the
lesser Asia, even to Susa the Royal Palace; containing in all C and XI.
Mansions: All which described in a brazen Table, with the What they were, v.

Parasangs they were distant one from another, Aristagoras the Militian brought
to Cleomenes King of Sparta, intending to urge the advantage he might gain
thereby, as a chief Argument to work him to the invasion of Persia. Although
indeed he missed of his aim, by unadvised and over-hastily telling him it
would prove an expedition of some three months Journey, before he had made it
appear to him with what ease he might perform it; his Marches and Quarter being
by that Table beforehand scored out for him. Rer. Scot: lib. 1.
Buchanan therefore needed not to have sought so low for the antiquity of
Draughts of this kind, as the authority of Prop Eleg: 3 lib 4. Cogor (...) e
tabul^ pictos ediscere (...).
Propertius, Maps and Chorographicall descriptions being of so long standing.
And for Alexander the Great, we may not imagine that so great a Commander would
neglect so requisite and necessary a piece of Souldiership, especially when we
find that the Commentaries of his Marches were extant in Plin: lib: 6. cap. 17.
Plinies time, described by Diognetus and Beton, whom he calls mensores
itinerum Alexandri; and he tells us a little before in the same Chapter, that
[Comites Alexandri M.] his followers diligently numbered and set down the Towns
of that Tract of India which they had conquered: and out of some of their
Commentari. s, it is very likely, was taken the sum of the 57. Chap. in
Solinus, inscribed (...) Indicum.

Having spoken of ^lexander, I may by no means leave out his great parallel,
Julius Caesar, who though he has left little to this purpose in those
immortal Commentaries of his own expedition; yet there are (a) that will tell
you, they have seen an Itinerary of his, or Description of the World: in which

being but late Writers, we will therefore hear what Aethicus in his Cosmography
says to it, who is indeed an Author ancient enough, as being transcribed in
some places by Paulus Orosius, in his Histories dedicated to S. Austin. Julius
Caesar, says Aethicus, Cum Consulatus sui fasces erigeret, ex S. C. censuit,
etc. So soon as he began to exercise his Office of Consul, made an Order,
confirmed by a Decree of the Senate, that the whole Roman World should be
surveyed and measured by Learned men, and well seen in all parts of Philosophy.
In his Consulship, therefore, with M. Anthony the World began to be measured;
from which time to the * third Consulship of Augustus which was with Crassus,
being * XXI. years V. Months, and IX. days, Zenodotus was taking a survey of
the whole East. From that Consulship of Caesar likewise to Augustus, his being
the X Cos. in * XXIX. years VIII. months and X. days time, the Survey of the
Northern part of the Empire was brought in by Theodotus. From the very same
Consulship also of Caesar, Quae habet Oros^de Britaniae specula, lib: 1. cap:
2. uti (...) alia non pau^, ex Aethico transcri^it.
to the Consulship of IV.
Saturninus and Cinna, the Southern part was measured by Policlytus in XVII.
XXXII. years I. month and X. days: So that in about the space of XXIII.
XXXII. years, the whole World was surveyed, and a general account thereof
brought in to the Senate. Thus far Aethicus: From which relation, we may
deservedly observe the greatness and vast extent of the Roman Empire, whose
Notitia, or Survey, was not taken under such a time, although just exception
may be made against the account of years here, as also in respect of the
Consuls Names; in both which he is foully out: And out of this very place of
Aethicus, I presume (else I am to seek whence) is taken that which I find in a
Farrago of diverse things, published when Printing first began among us, as you
may easily see by the English of it; Page: 65.
Julius Caesar used in his time to insearche and mesured the World in lengeth
and breed, and did make thereof great Books, and of all the Parties, Contrays
and Provinces, and Wondres in him contained; and that Book acorded to
Bartylmew, and to Marcus Paulus, and to Claudius Tholomeus, and to the great
Arystotell that went with stondynge, and ben proved tre^e be many dyvers
reasonable provynges, etc. We make use of Basilea An: D. LXXV.
Simlers Edition, which we conceive the best as bad as it is, till such time as
we shall have the good hap to meet with Salmasius his Aethicus, Long dissi*
milis a vulgato Aethico. Salm. ad Aug Hist: Script: p. 140.
great hopes of which he gives us in more then one place. In the mean while,
see Baronius in the Appar: Sect. 97. 98.
Apparatus to his Annalls.

Now that which here chiefly we shall take into our cognizance, will be, first,
To examine who this Aethicus was; and secondly, Whether Cuspinian, and
Malleolus, and others, who take upon them to have seen an Itinerary, or
Description of the World under Julius Caesar's name, do not mean this very piece
of Aethicus, with Antoninus's Itinerary, as they are commonly joined together.

For Aethicus, he is called by some Sophista, ex Istria oriundus; by our most
admired Roger Bacon Compend: studii The^l. part 4.
Francis Bacon, he is styled Astronomus. But you must take notice that they
have two distinct Cosmographicall Works, which bear the name of Aethicus: this
vulgar one, which has often been Printed, and another never yet published,
joined to the other Aethicus in Thuanus's MSS. but I have seen it in the
Bodleian Library in the same Volume with an ancient Solinus in Parchments. In
some Copies it bears this Title, Incipit liber Aethici Philosophico editus
oraculo, ab Hieronymo presbytero translatus in latinum, ex Cosmographia and
mundi scriptura. In the Preface you shall find, Hic Aethicus Istria regione
Sophista claruit, primusque codices suos Cosmographiam nuncupavit. And yet
Aethicus Ister philosophus is often urged in this very Book, which is the same,
I dare boldly say, which Bacon and others mention, and it is cited by Lib: De-
Navigiis.
Lilins Giraldus, under the Title of Antiquitatis Historiae, quae ab Hieronymo
in Latinum sermonem e Graeco conversae creduntur: A Book indeed containing many
things fabulous, and foolish, and unworthy S. I^romes pains in the translating,
if he ever did it. The vulgar printed Aethicus, whom we have now to do withal
(termed Monstrosorum vocabulorum auctor, by In Synonym: Geograph:
Ortelius) in Thuanus his ancient written Copy, is called Julius Orator (a
Writer mentioned by Cassiodorus) as Plin: Exercit. in Solin: p. 770. 836. 1113.
and in addend. 1339.
Salmasius, who had the use thereof, Witnesses in more then one place. And this
name Julius, which Cuspinian perhaps, and Malleolus found before their Books
(for they mention not the name of Aethicus) as also their finding of the
Senates Decree procured by Julius Caesar for the surveying of the Roman Empire,
in the very Preface of this Work, made them (as it is very likely) inscribe it
with the following Itinerary, which goes usually under Antoninus's, to Julius
Caesar's name. For that these two pieces are jointly intended by them, appears
plainly by the words of one of them before cited: [Gentes, and civitates
singulae in Itinerario] We referring the word Gentes to Aethicus, in whom you
have Oceani Orientalis gentes. Oc. Occid. Gentes, etc. And Asiae situs, cum
suis papulis, etc. And the Civitates cum suis did intiis, to Antoninus's
Itinerary. And indeed Flodoard H. R. E. lib: 1. cap: 1.
Flodoardus the Presbyter seems to make both these but one man's work; For
Aethicus is quoted by him for two several Journeys, which are not to be found
otherwhere then in Antoninus. In like manner is Ethicus cited by the learned
Welchman Powel in Cambr. Itin. l. 2.
David Powell (for Nemo contrarium says he) which is in Antoninus's second
Journey. And again, before that Itinerary, in a very ancient Copy, the Preface
concerning the Dimension of the Earth, belonging to Aethicus, was found
prefixed, as Praefat. in cap: 4. Antonin.
Simlerus informs us. And in a word, In Claudian. ad Paneg. in 6. Consul: Honor.
Caspar Barthius, the flourishing Philologer of this age, tells us plainly, he
had observed, that Aethicus was the Author of both Pieces.

Now from the foregoing Discourse, all that we can conclude, comes to thus
much; That, although the Title of Aethicus be exploded and utterly cashired
from having any thing to do with these Writings, as Salmasius (contrary to what
Barthius imagines) will have it; yet for all that we cannot (with Felix
Malleolus) absolutely say, that Julius Caesar was the Author of them, or
Antoninus Pius of the latter part, as most do; and that (not to urge other
reasons) because the names of many Cities and Places are to be found in both of
them, which had not any Being till long after their times. However, we being
none of those who dare Litterarum monumentis consecrata, as Val: Maxim. lib. 1.
cap: 9.
he says, Perinde ac vana refugere. Though we have the testimony but of an
Incertus auctor quem Aethicum vocant. Salm. in Solin: p. 318.
uncertain Author, we are bold from thence to affirm, that some such
Description, or Itinerary was published by Caesar's authority, and in following
times by Antoninus also, collected and framed; out of which, after many
alterations and additions, and interpolations by the injury of time, and bad
hands, we have only continued to us these unperfect, and corrupted Pieces,
which in some Copies may perchance have retained their names, by whose
appointment such Works were first instituted and begun, though now in a manner
wholly changed, and different from their first Originalls. So in like manner
the most learned Lib: IV. epist: 384. ad David. Hoeschel.
Scaliger was of opinion, that those Chorographicall, or military Tables, as
some call them, drawn out merely for the use of the Roman Armies, in regard of
their Marches and Quarters, and In Biblioth Conra^ Peutingeriano V. C.
found out and illustrated with Notes, by the Noble Mark ^lser of Auspurg, were
nothing else but a Description of Stations and Cities out of Antoninus, and
Ptolemies Geography.

But that we should any farther question Caesar's care and provision in this
respect, Suetonius will not suffer us; who plainly tells us, Suet. in Caesare
cap: 58. In obeundis expeditionibus exercitum neque per insidiosa itinera duxit
umqua^, nisi perspeculatu^ locorum situs.
That he never led his Army by any dangerous ways, but where he had formerly
diligently surveyed and observed the Situation of places. And to confirm it,
Suetonius here says, It is very observable out of his own Caes: de bello Gal
lib 1.
words, that when in his expedition against Ariavistus the German, not only his
Followers, and Friends, Centurions and Commanders of Horse, but beaten
Soldiers would out of Cowardice have abandoned the Service; yet pretending,
among other things, angustias itineris, the troubles and casualties of the
March, he roundly takes them up and answers them, That they dealt saucily to
cloak their fears with a false conceit of the difficulty of the ways; that it
was his duty to look to that, which they ought by no means to make question of;
Haec sibi curae esse: de itinere Ipsos brevi tempore judicaturos; They should
ere long see that he had well enough provided for that. Which he could not do
better, then by sitting and preparing Itinerary Tables and Descriptions to that
purpose. This wariness and forecast we see practiced by Augustus Caesar his
Successor, when he sent his eldest Son Caius with an Army into Armenia to
compose the Parthian and Arabian affairs, dispatching before him Dionysius the
Geographer, ad commentanda omnia, as Plin: lib: 6. cap. 28.
Pliny tells us, to describe and measure the distances of such Towns and
Stations, as he was to march by. This Dionysius he calls Terrarum orbis situs
recentissimum autorem: and yet Lib 3. cap: 2.
he mentions besides a Table of the World, which M. Agrippa described out of
his own Commentaries, and intended to set it forth in a Po^ticus for the
public view; which being begun by his Sister, and left imperfect, was
afterward finished by Augustus himself. Under whom when a Description was
taken (for it is not well translated Taxing in our Bibles, Luke 2. 2.) of
Judaea, (Quirinius, (...), the holy Text calls him, or Procurator) being then
President, and indeed of the whole World subject to the Roman power;
Proculdubio, faith Simler, Simler. praefat in Antonin.
singula oppida provinciarum omnium diligentissime descripta fuerunt: For truly
the Text says, they went to be listed, or enrolled, Luke 2. 3.
(...), Every man unto his own City.

Such kind of Itineraries, or Journying Tables, with the removes and distances
from place to place, accurately (for the most part) set down, were exceedingly
useful, as I said before, and advantageous in several respects. To let pass
the great use that Students, and men of Sedentary lives, made thereof, as often
as in the reading of Histories they chanced to meet with foreign Expeditions,
long Marches, Battelis, Sieges, and Descriptions of Cities, and Countries, and
the helps likewise that may be gained from thence, for the illustration and
correction of Geographicall Writers, such as Strabo, Mela Pliny, Ptolemie, etc.
The direction and benefit was extraordinary much, which Merchants, Pilgrims,

Psalm. 118.
and all kind of Wayfaring persons received thereby; But especially they were
intended for the use of Generals and Armies; the trouble and danger of marching
in strange Countries, being accounted the Itinerum primus labor and vel maximus

first and greatest care by wise men in Cicero's judgment, who was Commander
enough to know that, and the neglect thereof gave Sp. Posthumous the Consul,
with all his Forces, an ignominious overthrow by the Caudini, as Livy relates.
The use and benefit of such Tables, we shall best learn and find in Fl.
Vegetius, as in its most proper place, he being almost the only ancient Roman
Writer that is come to our hands, concerning Military matters. Veget. de Re
Milit: lib: 3. cap: 6.

solertiores duces Itineraria Provinciarum in quibus necessitas gerebatur, non
tantum annotata, sed etiam pict a babuisse firmentur, ut non solum consilio
mentis, verum etiam aspectu oculorum viam profecturus eligerat. He tells us
that wise and provident Commanders, had not only Itinerary Tables, wherein the
distances of places were noted by the number of miles, such as this in our
hands, which bears Antoninus's name, but exact draughts also, wherein the
windings of Ways, Rivers, and Hills also were lively described and expressed,
such as that Quo in genere autiouorum monumentorum extare puto nihil prius, aut
secundum. Andr. Schottus de eadem Tabula.
Table ((...)) is, whereof we spoke even now; which being curiously cut in
Brass, was by the care and directions of Ortelius first published at Antwerp,
and since by Bertius joined to his Edition of Ptolemie, the latest and very
best.

To this place of Vegetius, I will only add another out of S. Ambrose, who
indeed was some time after him, the one flourishing with the Title and Dignity
of a Comes at CP. under Valentinian, to whom he inscribes his Works, the other
being Archbishop of Millain under Theodosius the elder; It is a place very
pertinent, and will better then any, illustrate our present Discourse, by
informing us to what purpose such Lineraries were first instituted, and in this
regard it will make amends for the length of it; for I cannot forbear but
transcribe all of it hither Ambros: sermon: 5. in Psa: 118. ex D. Hilario, ut vid.
Miles qui ingreditur iter, says that Nectarian Doctor; viandi ordinem non
ipse disponit sibi, nec pro suo arbitrio viam carpit, nec voluntaria captat
compendia, ne recedat a signis, sed Itineratium ab imperatore accipit, and
custodit illud: praescripto incedit ordine, cum armis suis ambulat, rectaque
via cenficit iter, ut inveniat commeatuum parata sibi subsidia. Si alio
ambulaverit itinere, annonam non accipit, mansionem paratam non invenit, quia
imperator iis jubet haec praep^rari omnia: qui sequuntur, nec dextra nec
sinistra a praescripto itinere declinant; meritoque non deficit, qui
imperatorem suum sequitur. Moderate enim ambulat, quia imperator non quod sibi
utile, sed quod omnibus possibile, considerat: id^o and siativa ordinat, triduo
ambulat exercitus, quarto requiescit die. Eliguntur civitates in quibus
triduum, quatriduum and plures interponantur dies si aquis abundant, commerciis
frequentantur, and ita sine labor consicitur iter, donec ad eam urbem
perveniatur, quae quasi regalis eligitur, in qua f^ssis exercitibus requies
ministratur. I will not be farther troublesome by translating; only instead
thereof observe, that Itineraria among the ancient Latins, are in Greek
Writers called (...), i. The Discriptions, or Annotations of Mansions:

manner, which most anciently signified as much as Cubare, to lie, or rest all
night. Sometimes in long Journeys, I mean, they reckoned not so much by the
number of miles between Mansion and Mansion, as by the number of the Mansions
themselves, which we learn by this Apud Hieron. Capugnan. in Addit. ad Iran.

the Posthorses themselves, as the set places where they were kept and

age Itinerarium signified the charge given, in token the Army was presently to

as is (...), in Pollux. But to have spoken so much concerning Itineraries and
Mansions, by way of Preface to the whole, will be thought sufficient, if not
more then enough.

BRITANNIARUM] Britanniarum here in the plural number is not so to be
understood, as if thereby were meant all those British Islands which by one
general name were called Britanniae, according to that of Not: Hist: lib: 4.
cap: 16.
Pliny [Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes.] But by an
Archivism, or antic manner of speaking, we must take it for the greatest among
them, containing in it at this day England, Wales, and Scotland, and named, as
he says, to difference it from the others, Albion: and that by Fr. Patric:
Inscuss: Peripatetic: Tom: 1. lib. 6. Brissonius, Cra^anthorp: Portun. Licetus,
etc.
Aristotle, or Buchin: Rer: Scot: lib: 1.

Britain.
(...), if at least the same Ptolemie be Author of both works, which I see
Joan: Noviomagus, Baroecius, etc.
some have questioned, but certainly without cause, Lectur: in Euglidem.
as Sir H. Savile thought.

There are examples enough for this manner of speaking to be found both in
later and more ancient Writers, but the names of Provinces were especially so
expressed, as well in Prose as Poets: In Propert. lib: 2. Eleg: 17.
Propertius. Dic alias iterum navigat Illyrias.
Let him once more other Illyria's find.


In Polyhist. ex edit: Salmas. cap: 2.
Solinus of the best Edition, Graecias cogitamus. And the Grecians themselves
seem to have used it: to confirm which, as Homer (H' (...).)

And this Verse of Euripides is urged also. (...).
The Ilanders and Europe afar of.
For certainly he means Europe, which not only in Holy Writ is described by
the Gen: 10. 5.
Isles of the Gentiles; but in lib: De fa. die in Orb Lun^. in quem v. Joan:
Repleram.
Plutarch also the Inhabitants there are called Insulares, or Ilanders: As for
Britain in particular, these places out of the learned Catull: Epigr: 26.
Catullus may be sufficient. Hunc Galliae timent, timent Britanniae.
Let him the Gauls fear, and the Britains too.
And again, Epigr: 42:
Mavult quam Syrias, Britanniasque.
Rather then the Syrians or the British Stem.
Neither may we possibly imagine, that by this Plural expression any division
of Britain into smaller Provinces is meant in this place, such as that
Quadripartite, in Sextus, In Breviario Ad Valentin. Imp.
or rather Festus Rusus (Camden in naming but three out him was deceived by a
false Copy) into Maxima Caesariensis, Amm. Mercellin. lib. 28.
Flavia Caesariensis, Britannia prima, and Britannia secunda: of which division
they make Constantine the Author; Or into five Provinces afterward by
Valentinian Vide Notinam Oc^d. Imperii, and illic Gu. Pancitolum.
adding Valentia in honor of his Brother Valens; namely, Britannia I.
Britannia II. Maxima Caesariensis. Flavia Caesariensis.
For both these you see were of later time. Neither may we understand that
partion of it, which we find in Die Hist. lib. 55.
Dion Cassius, into the Brit. (...).
Higher, or nearer part of the Province, and (...).
Lower, or more remote, and Northern, called Britanniae pars interior, in Com.
de bell. Gal. lib. 5.
Caesar's language; except any one have a mind to read interior in that place,
which would not indeed so well answer to maritima, by which he distinguishes
the nearer part, and known to the Romans, but would better agree with Dio's
expression, according to whose division, we read in Hist. lib. 3.
Herodian also, that Severus distributed [(...)] The administration of
government in the Nation into two President-ships. But least of all may we
imagine that division (which the Britain History only is Author of) into
Lhoegria, Cambria, and Albania; although Cambria seems to Forte in Lib: De
obscur. Author. locis, and corrupt. nominibus. Neque, n. occurrit in Historia

But whether for this conjecture (among others) he may deserve the Title of
eruditissimus both in Greek and Latin literature from the Learned Gosner's
hand, I leave our Friends of Wales to be Judges. And for the division of
Britain in former time, I shall have occasion elsewhere to discourse more at
large.

If in the mean while any one shall be desirous to know more exactly the
Chorography thereof about the time that this Itinerary was written, if that be
true which In Bibliotheca.
Ierom Surita, a learned Spaniard, goes about to persuade us, namely, that it
was published by the command of Antoninus Caracalla, the Son * Prafat. ad Anton
Itiner.
of Severus (making the recension of our Britain Mansions therein, sited so far
Northerly, and conquered anew by them, as a ground of this his assertion:) he
cannot do better then to join thereunto Piolemic's Geograph: lib: 2.
annumeration of the several Provinces, or People that then inhabited Britain,
their more noted Cities, Rivers, Promontories, Havens, Islands, etc. he living
not very long before the time that Caracalla was Emperor. And somewhat after
Ptolemies age, you have the number of them all set down to your hand, I know
not how exactly, by In Periplo lib: 2.
Marcianus Heracleota, a Greek Writer also. (...), says he, (...). That is,
Albion or Britain contains in it, XXXIII. distinct Provinces, noted Cities

Havens. The number of Cities here exactly agrees with that in Ptolemy, to whom
I conceive he is beholding for the rest also: for that he was after him,
evidently appears by his citing him; as he was also junior to the other
Marcianus, of Heraclea also (a Writer of the same subject) whose (...) in
Iambick Verse we have published by Fred. Mcrellus.

In our Antoninus, the names of the Mansions or Towns, if you please to call
them so, are well near double that number, there being reckoned no less then
CXIV. in this Itinerary through the XV. Journeys. We may say then, that
Antoninus set down all he took in his way; Ptolemy only the more noted. In the
Notitia of the Western Empire Breviarium Theodosii dicitur Andr. Alciato Pare
rg^r. lib: 5. cap: 13.
under Theodosius the younger, you shall find not above XLVI. Garrisons in the
whole Island, whereof IX. were kept on the Seacoast, to hinder the frequent
Attempts and Invasions of the Saxon Pirates, under the Command of the Comes
Littoris Saxonici per Britanniam. XIV others more inland were commanded by the
Dux Britanniarum (who had the Title of Spectabilis, as had also the other)
whereof York is the first, under the notion of Legio VI. Besides XXIII. more
Per Lineam Valli, who had most of them their Stations very near the Wall, to
keep off the continual Assaults and Irruptions of the Scots, and Picts, and
other barbarous people. But the inland of the Country I believe was stored with
many other flourishing Cities, which being named by Antoninus and Ptolemie, I
cannot think were therefore sacked and ruined before this Notitia, or Survey was
taken, because we find them not mentioned there: And this we may the more
probably suppose, because that after the Romans had abandoned the Island, we
find many of them still remaining in good condition, however, in succeeding
times, and not long after their departure, we find not but XXVIII. Cities in
Britain. But certainly they were of principal note, (...), as Ptolemie's
expression is; and such indeed are they described to be by Venerable Bede, the
ancient glory of this Nation. Erat, says he, Beda Eccl: Hist: lib: 1. cap: 1.
[Britannia] viginti and octo civitatibus quondam nobilissimis insignita,
praeter Castella innumera, quae and ipsa muris, turribus, portis ac seris erant
instructa sirmissimis. He had for his Author our Countryman Gildas, who in his
Epistle De Excidio Britannia.
(the ancientest Writing of any Britain that is now extant) tells us, That
Britain was adorned, Decorata bis denis bisque quaternis civitatibus, That is,
with In quibus vulgares nostri Chronographi Flamines and Archistamines
constituunt: unde and Episcopatuum and Archiepiscopatuum per Britanniam
Noeitlas petunt: quod Commentum jam satis explosum.
eight and twenty Cities. The Catalogue of whose British names collected by
Ninnius the old Historian, being compared with the best Copies that are to be
found thereof at this day, is published and illustrated (as well with the Roman
names, as such as they are known by at this day) by the Reverend and most
Learned Iac. Vsser. De Britannic: Eccles: Primord. cap. 5.
Primate of Ireland. Having nothing therefore in my own poor store, to add to
so great abilities, and exact diligence, it is high time for us to bethink our
selves of our passage from the Coast of France, where the most usual Port to
set sail for the Island, while the Romans had the Command thereof, was
Gessoriacum; whence also our Autoninus begins his Itinerary as follows.

A GESSORIACO DE GALLIIS, RITUPIS IN PORTU BRITANNIARUM STADIA NUMERO CCCCL.
A GESSORIACO DE GALLIIS.] From Gessoriacum out of Gaul; for which in the
Sea-Itinerary, whereof we spoke before, you have A Portu Gessoriacensi, as
Simlerus mends it: for in the Venetian Edition of Aldus and others, it is
Printed Gesorigiagensi, as if the name of the place had been also called
Gessorigia; of which more anon: as for the last g. in this word, for c. against
the ordinary making, that is to be imputed to the frequent mistake of
Transcribers, who most usually confound these two letters, as all know that
handle written Books, and we shall see variety of examples for it, before we
have done with Antoninus. Among diverse others of the Ancients, Pliny also
mentions this Port, calling it, Gessoriacum Not. Hist. lib. 4. cap. 16.
Morinorum littus; which else where he expresses by Ibid: cap. 23.
Portum Morinorum Britannicum: for of this place I understand him there, rather
then with ((...)) Chiffletius that he should mean Portus Iccius; for indeed in
his time, and some while before him, Gessoriacum (e) Iac. Chiffl. in Portu
Iccio cap. 6.
was the only known accustomed Port, whence they set say I for Britain, as may
appear by a place in Pomponius Mela, who wrote some what after the time that
Claudius undertook his expedition hither, taking Shipping at this very place.
De situ Orbis lib. 3 cap. 1.
Nec Morini, says he, portu, quem Gessoriacum vocant, quicquam habent notius.
They have nothing of greater note then their Haven Gessoriacum, which Geogr.
lib. 2.
Ptolemy also confirms, in whom you find (...). Gisorriacum, the Haven of the
Morini; in whom by the Transcribers heedlesnes [(...)] I^cium the Promontory
(for he mentions not the Haven) is got into the place that Gessoriacum should
be in, as the learned Camden has observed. And yet we deny not but that
Iccius, Virgil. Aen. lib 8.
or I^us, was a Port also of these extremi hominum Morini, as Virgil calls
them. Strabo Lib: 4. in descript. Britanniae.
expressly witnesses it; (...). Although Ortelius Iccius Portus, Caletiuni pop.
in Gallia Belgica navales ut Strabo scribit. Ortel. in Synon.
make it belong to the Caletes, a People neighboring upon them, vouching for
it the very same Strabo's authority. Besides Florus L. Flor. lib. 3. cap 10.
tells us, That Caesar set sail a Portu Morino, which himself in his
Commentaries De bell. Gal. Comm. 5.
calls Iccius, ex quo commodissimum in Britanniam transjectum esse cognoverat:
Whence he had observed the most convenient passage was over into Britain.
However, because in aftertimes, Gessoriacum was thought to be so too; (Iccius
perhaps being stopped up and become less frequented) we may not therefore with
Cuverius Phil. Cluv. Introd. Geogr. l. 2. c. 12.
(having no more ground for it then his bare word) conclude that they were the
same, which, he indeed, does very resolvedly, without once question made
thereof: Portus Gessoriacus, says he, Qui antea itius, and postmodum Bononia,
nunc Boulogne; for this assertion has as little proof for it, as Dempesters
Tho: Dempster: Paralip: ad c. 10. lib: 10. Rom: Antiq Io: Rosini.
wild conceit, that the Inhabitants of Gessoriacum were the most valiant
people of Gallia, because he deduces the name from Gesum, a Weapon, by old
Authors of both Languages peculiarly appropriated to the Gauls.

After Julius Caesar's expedition hither, Strabo under Augustus and Tiberius
sets down four several places, from which they then used to put forth to Sea
for this our Island from the Continent Strabo Geogr. l. 4.
[(...)] From the several mouths of the Rhene, the Seyne, the Loir, and the
Gironne, where also he tells us, that they that took Shipping from any place
near upon or about the Rhene, sailed not directly out by the mouth of the
River, but from the Morini. (...), says he, (...), among whom also is Itium;
naming it here only occasionally out of Caesar's own description of his
passage (for he principally cites Casar's self about his own affairs, and the
condition of things at that time in Gau^) but by the context of his words, he
may seem to intimate also some other Haven upon their Coast, which sure enough
was Gessoriacum, though not yet used in his time: for from thence within a very
little while after Claudiur took his Voyage into Britain, as Suetonius relates:
Sueton: in Claudio cap: 17.
A (...) Gessoriacum usque pedestri itinere consecte, inde transmis^: After a
land march from Marseilles, he passed ^ver his Army from hence; and not he
himself only, but such also as at any time he employed hither with Command,
Aul. Plautius, P. Ostorius, Fl. Vespasianus, and others made use, it is most
likely, of this very same Haven.

Neither does that conjecture want great show of probability, that immediately
before him the stupid Caligula put his mighty Army in Battalia upon this very
Quod idem littus Bononiae Ammian. dicitur lib: 27.
littus Gessoriacum, as Pliny calls it: For in a Bravado and mere flourish of a
seeming attempt against Sueton in Caligula cap. 46.
Britain, at an ^bbing Sea he commanded the Soldiers upon the sounding of a
charge to fill their Bosoms and Helmets with Shells, as spoils of the Ocean,
whilst himself, and some selected Friends launched out in their Galleys. To
perpetuate the memory of which so vainglorious (or rather ridiculous) an
action, he built upon the place (o) altissimam turrem, an exceeding high Tower,
appointing it also for a Sea-mark, with ^e on the top by night, in imitation,
no doubt, of that Pharus at the Port of Alexandria. Out of this Tower, if not
the very same, there are learned men, who suspect that that was raised, which
the Dutch and we call The old man of Bullen, but the French name it Tour
d'ordre, at this day, standing very high upon the Port of Bologne, or Bononia,
which they will have to be a later name of Gessoriacum, as we shall see in what
follows. Neither does it any whit hinder that the Inhabitants entitle Julius
Caesar to be the Author thereof, for besides that in the Fasti Capitolini,
Caligula is expressly entered Caius Julius Caesar Augustus, etc. We know full
well from instances to be made at home, The Tower of London. The Bathe. Chester
Arthurs Oven, in Scotland, etc.
how uncertain and groundless the reports are, which are given out upon
tradition, concerning Caesar's structures. Moreover, the words of Dio, and
Xiphilint out of him, concerning this mock-show [Caligula (...). Dio lib. 54.

the most do place it; And he himself, as mad as he was, could not but know by
Julius Casar's example, there were nearer cuts over hither then so. However it
is very remarkable, that the Seat of so notorious a piece of Masonry should
become questionable to Posterity: the works of foolish Princes, as well as
their Councels, most commonly coming to nothing.

In succeeding times likewise, when Britain was now become a Province of the
Romans, this was the only frequented place for taking Sea thither. To say
nothing of Nero's Generals: For Julius Agricola's passage over under
Vespasian, (whose Pro-praetor, or President he was in the Island) methinks I
could out of In vita ejus legendo cum B. Rhenano Rutupensis, pro Tiutu^sis.
Tacitus corrected, prove it was from hence; of which more, when I shall speak
of Rutupiae. And for Hadrians Voyage hither, we do not once imagine that it was
begun from any other place; especially Gessoriacum being mentioned by an Author
of that time, who made himself pastime Apud Spartian in Hadriano.
in Verse with his expedition hither, for which he was then thought worthy of
no other payment, then in the same coin from the Emperors own hands. It is L.
Florus (whose elegant Breviary we have of the Roman History) where he takes a
view of the military actions of the Commonwealth in its Infancy, compared with
its well-grown habit and constitution in his time, and somewhat before. De
gest. Rom: lib. 1. cap. 11.
Idem hunc Fregellae, says he, quod Gessoriacum: By which he means that in
elder time to have attempted by Arms Fregellae, a small Town of the Latins,
was accounted of equal hazard to the conveying over an Army from Gessoriacum
in his days, for the settling of the Affairs of Britain; which it is well
known Hadrian did do. And upon the mentioning this passage, I list not now to
make stay to enquire what occasioned that foul mistake in learned Hadrian
Junius his additions to his Nomenclator, out of Ortelius's Theatrum, whereby
Iccius Portus is here said to be called Fregellae, by Florus: and instead
thereof we shall add in this place, that Albinus Caesar also did here land his
British Forces against Severus; which I conclude from his marching directly to
Lugdunum, or Lions: For seeing we are told by Not. hist. lib. 4. cap. 23.
Pliny that Polybius (I know not whom he should mean, except the Historian)
took the measure of distance from the Alps to the Portus Morinorum Britannicus
(which I think we have proved to be this Gessoriacu^; and Camden, I am sure,
thought so) by the way of Lions, where else should he, that was to give Battle
at Lions to Severus, land out of Britain, but at G^ssoriacum? And Herodian
means no other then this very Port, by his Herodian. lib. 3.
[(...)] Gaul just over against; which expression [(...)] at large, as they
say, he uses; not only for the arrival of Albinus at this place, but of
Severus's Sons also with their Fathers ashes, which they landed here to be
conveyed to Rome; where after the solemn Obsequies performed, they made him a
God, whose Body the Britains a little before had seen consumed in flames. As
for any other place to arrive at besides, the memories of this age, and of the
former are utterly silent.

And in following ages also the same Haven was continued during the time the
Romans had command of Britain, as a Province; however, they say the name was
changed, and that, it seems, somewhat before Constantius Chlorus had the
Government here assigned to him. We learn this by a Anonym. editus ab Henr.
Valesio, cum Amm Marcellino. Eundem scriptorem MS. laudat. Pecav. de Doctr.
Temp. ex Biblioth. Sirmondi.
Writer of those times, whose name is lost, though not his History, wherein he
relates, that Constantine his Son making his way with all speed through Italy,
to escape Severus, created Caesar by Maximianus, who pursued him, hockt all the
Posthorses he left behind him in the public Mutations, or Innes, and so came
safe to his Father [Apud Bononiam, quam Galli prius Gessoriacum vocabant] to
Bononia, which the Gauls former y ^led Gesoriacum. Zozimus also Hist: (...)
lib: 2.
remembers the fact in his new History, as also Aurel. Victor: and though they
add nothing about the names of the place, yet others observe the very same
concerning the change of them. The Author of this Military Itinerary Table
found in Peutinger's Study, formerly mentioned: Gessoriacum, quod nunc Bononia.
But we need not seek for more Authorities of this kind, nor yet too exactly
urge the distance of miles between the old Ambiani, and G^ssoriacum, in our
Itin: Gal: Belg. M. P. LXXIV. sive Leug. L. qua mensura potissimum usi sunt

Antonius, which is the very same, as it is said, at this day between Amiens
and Bullen; most certainly the same with Bononia in ancient times; for [Quod
instar omnium est] says In Cantio.
Camden, that which out-weighs all arguments, to prove that Bononia and
Gessariacum were [necessario unum idemque opidum] the very same Town, is this,

Pericope;) is by Cujus Pr: Facerem.
another to his Son Constantine said, Bononiensis oppidi littus insedere. And
it is not to be thought, as he adds, that men of that quality, speaking to so
great Princes, should either of them be mistaken in the place, or its name, the
memory of the Victory being as yet fresh. I herefore to him the name seems
changed in Constantine's days.

Yet as resolved as he concludes the business Ios: Scal: Auson: Lect: lib: 1.
cap: 23.
Scaliger will by no means have it believed. Ne credas unquam Bononiam
Gessoriacum dictam, semper enim eam appellationem habuit. Thinks not, says he,
that ever Bononia was called Gessoriacum; for it never had any other name.
B^nonia indeed, he tells us, was anciently Not: hist. lib: 4. cap: 17.
Pagi Gessoriaci (as Pliny calls it) by which he understands that whole Tract,
Qui pertinet a Normannis Belgis ad Bononiam; and in which even at this day, a
Town remains, yet called Gissore from thence, the word Pagus, being not oftener
taken for a Village, or Town, then for a great Lordship, or Territory. Neither
does he see any reason, as he says, why we should give it any other name
besides Bononia, seeing it is so ancient, as appears by Amm. Marc^ (whose
authority however is some deal lower, which we may observe by the way, then
that before out of the Panegyric) in his XX. Book: Notarius Bononiam mi^titur
observaturus sodicite, ne quisquam fretum Oceani transir^ perm^tteretur; that
is, into Britain: and there he tells us also, that L^p cinus dispatched by
Ju^ian, to compose the British affairs took shipping at the same place, and
elsewhere; that Ammian: hist: lib: 27.
Theodos. did so likewise, being sent by Valentinian. They likewise which
returned hence back again to the Continent, made this their constant
landing-place. Of Constantine the III, commonly called the Tyrant Zosim. Hist.

of Honorius the elder, Theodosius, and Honorius the younger; out of one of
whom, or both, Sozomen. lib. 9.
Sozomen the Ecclesiastical Historian relates the same thing, saving that his
Text is corrupt; for you have there (...), which the dexterity of the
Editioner, or Interpreter has turned into (...), whence is the Latin
Burbonia, which is just nothing in that place.

But by this time we have almost lost Gessoriacum, indeed about the ancient

are they from agreement where it might have been. Calligat. I'lin. lib. 4. cap.

Haven Town, he dare not seek for it in any inland place, though there be some
allusion to the same: Our famous Antiquary John Leland most judicially places
it at Bologne, or Bononia, which the Dutch call Bennen; And him does Camden

Hence then in good time let us set sail for Britain; for we cannot stay here
to dispute the question, Whether BRITAIN were not from antiquity, as remote as
the Flood rent from the main land of Gaul, Velut a corpore, majore impetu

per humilitatem obrutum e aquis, aut propter angustiam s^issum. Salust. apud

intelligence in Antiquities. As for our other Antiquaries, they are such, who
following the opinion the one of the other, as the same Verstegan well
observes, are rather content to think it sometime to have been, then to labor
to find out by sundry pregnant reasons, that so it was indeed. I always except
the learned Camden, whose resolution herein is very grave and discreet, making
it a high matter of Religion, De divinis operibus Supine sententiam far:
adding moreover, that lands scattered in the middle of the Ocean (the Divine
Providence seeing it good it should be so) do confer no less to the ornament of
the Universe, then great Lakes and Meers dispersed up and down in the firm Land
do, as huge Mountains near unto vast Plains. But Antonine calls us aboard: and
as I said before we cannot stay. Di^ nobis facilemque viam, ventosque ferentes.
Grant us, ye Gods, fair way, and prosperous Winds.


RITUPIS, or Ritupiis, IN PORTU BRITANNIARUM.] And now are we, in good time,
arrived in BRITAIN, at Ritupiae, or Rutupiae, (...). Ptol: Geograph: lib. 2.
as Ptolemie calls it, making it one of the two (for London is misplaced there
for a third) principal Cities of the CANTII, or Kent, not of the Atrebati^, as
Surita, by a foul oversight, tells us, they being far more inland. In our
Voyage from Gaul, we have passed over a boisterous and surging Sea, Attolli
horrendis aestibus adsuetu^, Am. Marcell. lib: 27.
says Ammianus of it, and therefore not without cause described such by Lucan
in these brave Verses. -- Lucan. lib. 6.
Veluti mediis qui intus in arvis
Sicaniae, rapidum nescit latrare Pelorum:
Aut vaga, cum Tethys, Rutupinaque littora fervent,
Unda Caledonios fallit turbata Britannos.
As who in midst of Sicily safe dwell,
When rough Pelorus barks can never tell:
As Northern Britains cannot hear the roar
Of flowing Seas against the Kentish shore. T. M.


Iuvenal. S^t: 4.
Juvenall expresses it by Rutupinus fundus, calling it so from this famous
Haven-town standing upon the shore, where he celebrates the Oysters taken
there, and conveyed thence to Rome, among other farfetcht Dainties, and
commends Montanus the Roman Senators judicious palate in the tasting of them.
-- Nulli major suit usus edendi
Tempestate mea; Circeis nata forent, an
Lucrinum ad sax^m, Rutupinone edita fundo
Ostrea, callebat primo deprendere morsu:
Et semel aspecti littus dicebat Echini.
-- in all
My time, his taste was most authentical.
If Lucrin Rocks or Circe's th'Oysters bred
Or were they with Kent:
Richborough water fed
He found at the first taste, and by the look
Of Crabfish told upon what Coast 'twas took.
Sir R. Stapylton.


And truly we are not to understand Val. Maximus, where he speaks of Fishes
Val: Maxim. lib: 9. cap: 1.
Ab Oceani littoribus, and infusae culinis Ostreae: or Senica's Consol: ad
Helv: cap: 9.
Conchylia ultimi maris ex ignoto littore, of any other then Oysters taken upon
these shoars. For Not. Hist. lib:
Pliny expressly mentions Ostrea Britannica out of Mu^ianus, making them indeed
somewhat less luscious then those of the Lucrine Lake, as likewise they were
not so large as those of Cyzicum: his words are, Cyzicena majora Lucrinis,
suaviora Britannicis. But in after ages Ausonius the Poet seems to have admired
them above others in these words. Sunt and Aremorici qui laudent ostrea ponti,
Et quae Pictonici legit accola littoris: and quae
Mirae Britannicus.
Caledonius nonnunquam detegit aestus.
Some do the Guien Oysters highly fame;
Some those are gathered by a Scottish Dame:
Some those the Flood leaves on the British shore.


They are in his IX. Epistle to Axius Pontius the Rhetorician; in which you
have variety of good Oysters: thither therefore I send you for better
satisfaction, or else to Apicius, and the Doctors of his School, the Gulae
proceres; for we must return to Rutupiae.

To pass by therefore the Interpreter, as it is pretended, of the British
History, who tells us, that not only Galfrid: M^num: Hist: Brit: lib: 1. cap:
22.
Julius Caesar landed here [in Rutupinum portum] at his third entrance (of
which yet himself Ibid: cap: 26.
makes no mention) but also that Vespasian, being sent hither by Claudius to
make all quiet; Cum ad Rutupi portum applicare incaepiss^t, was hindered from
landing here, and so forced to wheel about as far as Totnes in Cornwall: In an
unquestionable Writer, Cornelius Tacitus, we find this place called Portus
Rutupensis: for not only all learned men in general beyond the Seas approve
this correction of that place by B. Rhenanus; but Sir Henry Savile also his
most accurate Interpreter; whereas indeed before it was read In vita Agricola.
Et simul classis secunda tempestate ac fam^ Trutulensem portum tenui^, unde
proximo latere Britanniae tecto F. exierat.
redierat. i. And withal, the Navy with prosperous wind and success arrived at
the Port Trutulensis, from whence it had departed, coasting along the nearest
side of Lr. tanny, and so returned thither again. By which it is plain, that
here was the usual Harbor where the Romans Navy rode at Anchor, and
consequently that this was the ordinary landing-place from Gissoriacum, or
Bononia, in those times, as it was in after ages also, which we shall show. As
for this place of Tacitus, if it be not so to be mended, Trutulensis will sound
nothing, and be no where to be found.

But Ammianus will make it good; A Writer who began his History of the Roman
Emperors, just where Tacitus left off; and indeed he is the first after him
(except Juvenall) who mentions Rutupiae; the name of it being lost for so long
togegether, with the former part of his History, even to the times of
Constantius and Julian) under whom Lupicinus, being dispatched into Britain to
repulse the inrodes of the Scots, and Picts, Ammian: lib. 20.
Bononiam venit, and observato statu secundo, ventorum, ad Rutupias, sitas ex
adverso defertur, petitque Lundinium. And elsewhere he tells us, That
Theodotius appointed also hither by Valentinian, Idem lib: 27.
cum venisset, ad Bononiae littus, transmeato lentius freto defertur Rutupias,
stationem ex adverso tranquillam: Was carried to Rutupiae, a calm Harbor over
against; and therefore fittest for the Roman Fleet constantly to lie there,

Decius Ausonius the Poet, who under Valentinian Epiced. in Patrem. and in Mos.
as himself tells us, had the Praefectura of Gaul and Britanny, has also
preserved the memory of this famous Station in his Parentalia, where he
celebrates the Funeral of his Fathers Brother Claudius Contentus, who having
put out to use, and improved a Mass of money in strangers hands in Britain,
lost it all by his sudden death in this very place; if Ausonius do not rather
by tellus Rutupina, mean Britain in general, which some have thought. Et
patruos Elegia meos reminiscere cantu;
Contentum; tellus quem Rutupina tegit.
Magna cui, and variae quasita pecunia sortis,
Haeredis nullo nomine tuta, perit.
Raptus enim l^tis, and adbuc florentibus annis
Trans mare, and ignaris fratribus oppetiit.
My Kinsman muse, in mournful Nots deplore
Contentus buried on the Kentish shore;
TO whom Fortune gave great store of riches where
He without Issue died, and left no Heir:
In foraign Land Fate him deprived of breath
In's prime, whose Brothers knew not of his death.
For Clemens Maximus the Tyrant (who vanquished two Emperors) slaying Gratian,
and making Valentinian abandon Italy, being called Rutupinus latro by the same
Ausonius; many have from thence, as also from a place of Ecclesiast: hist: lib:
5. cap: 11.
Socrates misunderstood in his Translation (to speak nothing of our own Country
Qui plerique omnes Maximum fuisse forsitan volun^.
Writers in old time, and what they thought of him) concluded him a Britain,
although in very truth he were of Spanish birth and extraction, as both Zosin:
hist: lib.
Zofimus witnesses, and may most evidently be collected out of Latinus Pacatus
his Panegyric to Theodosius. All indeed that can he concluded from this
Epithet, given him by Ausonius, is only this, That in Britain he first put on
the Imperial Purple, and so passed into Gaul, as Socrates is to be understood,
and In Epitome de Imp.
Aurel. Victor plainly writes. Neither does that want some good show of
probability, which Mr. Camden has, that Maximus perhaps had the Government of
this Station, and of what forces else lay near upon this place; and therefore
was so called by him in this Verse: Punisti Au^onio Auson. in urbibus in
Aquileia.
Rutupinum mart latronem.
By thee the Kentish Rebel was subdued.
For besides that, Ausenius himself in his forenamed Parentalia mentions such a
Presidentship there sometime sustained by Fl. Sanctus his own Wifes Sister's
Husband (whom there he has asserted from oblivion, in this Epitaph; so that we
may see they do not wholly dye, who have a Poet to friend. Tranquillos Manes,
supremique mitia Sancti,
Ore pio, and v^rbis advenerare bonis:
Militiam nullo qui turbine sedulus egit:
Praeside laetatus quo Rutupinus ager.
Octoginta annos ^ujus tranquilla senectus
Nullo mutavit deteriore die.
With pious Lips, and holy Prayers thou must
Adore blessed Sanctus Soul, and quiet dust,
Who made War easy, and whilst he did Reign
Gave peace and plenty to the Rutupian Plain.
Full eighty years he lived with happy fate,
Then humane life changed for a better state.
The Notitia also, or Survey of the Western Empire, thought to be taken not
long after this time, lets us know, that the Praepositus of the II. Legion,
called Victrix Augusta, resided [Rutupis] at Rutupiae, sub dispositione V^ri
spectabilis Comitis Littoris Saxonici per Britanniarum, to hinder the Piracies
and inrodes of the Saxons, Comment. in Notit: Oxid: cap. 72.
Guide. Pancirolus in his old Book found Praefectus for Praepositus, which is
the better, being the usual word. As for the Legion it self, we shall have
fitter occasion to speak of it elsewhere in this very work.

Oros: hist: lib. 1. cap. 2.
Paulus Aurosius. the Spanish Priest, calls it a Pity, as well as a Haven:
Britain, says he, has Gaul on the South, Cujus proximum littus transmeantibus
civitas aperit quae dicitur Rhutubi portus. Out of whom Beda adding moreover
the site thereof, and name also in his days: Eccles. hist: lib. 1. cap. 1.
Britannia habet a meridie Galliam Belgicam, ^ujus proximum littus
transmeantibus ap^rit civitas, quae dicitur Ruthubi portus, qui portus a gente
Anglorum nunc corrupt (...) vocata, interposito mari a Gessoriaco Morinorum
gentis, littore proximo trajectu miliarum quinquaginta, sive, ut quidam
scripsere stadiorum quadringentorum quinquaginta. He says, That the Saxons in
his time corruptly called it Beptae^ster, which afterward was altered into
Ruptimuth, and Richbery, and of late ages into Richborow, all, no doubt, from
the old Rutupiae. which also before Bid in the Military Tables was corrupted
into Ravipis and Ratupis. As for the deduction of the name, Camden I see is not
(as usually his manner is) so confident in deriving it from the ancient Britain
Language: I would, says he, Si auderem.
if I durst, bring it from Rhyd Tufith, which is as much as A Ford stoptwith
sand. The denomination indeed is at this day very suitable to the place,
considering not only the obstruction of the old Haven, but of that too which
belongs to the new Town, risen of late ages out of the ruins of Rutupiae, and
called indeed Sandwich, from the store of Sand forceably by the Sea cast up
from the Godwin upon this shore. But that anciently it should be from thence so
called, when it was an Harbor for the Roman Navies, I would feign have some
body to satisfy me therein, how it might be, except they then had some
foresight of what in after ages would come to pass. Besides, if this be the
Etymon, I would be told also, by them that can, whence Plin: Not: hist: lib: 5.
cap: 1.
Portus Rutubis a Haven on the Coast of Barbary, mentioned by Pliny, was so
called; for to allude to the same Pliny's words in another place, Ibid: l: 3.
cap: 16.
Pudet a Britannis Africae rationem mutuari: We may by no means out of our old
British Tongue seek the Originations also of Towns names in Africa: Xenagog:
Cantii p: 90.
Will. Lambard had rather derive it from the British word, which signifies a
Net, in token that it stood by Fishing; or of Rwyd, which signifies Speed:
because from thence, as some thought, was the most short and speedy course over
the Seas.

The Island indeed which stands situate over against Rutupiae, retains yet some
parcel of the old name thereof in our British, being called Ynis Ruhin: Asser:
Menevens:
Ynys Rhuochim, that is, the Rutupian Island, as Humphr. Lhoyd interprets it;
But whether Rhuochim were the British name for this Rutupiae, in that famous
History, the Translator of which Geffrey of Monmouth (B. afterward of S.
Asaph, and Cardinal Alph: Gacco: de gest: Pontif: etc.
as some say) makes himself; to be where it is related, That King Arthur,
returning from his expedition against I know not what Emperor of Rome, with an
Army of CC. and LXX. M. men, arrived in Hist: Brit: lib: 7. cap: 7.
Rutupum portum; as also in those places before mentioned: they only can tell
us, who have looked into a British Copy thereof; one of which Xenagog: Canaeae
page: 75.
Mr. Lambard says he had in his possession. We call it Thanst, of which Jul.
Solinus in his Polyhistor thus, being the first of the Ancients that mentions
it: Solin: cap: 35. sive 22. ut Salmas.
Thanatos insula alluitur freto Gallico, a britanniae continenti aestuario
te^ui separata, selix srument^riis campis, and gleba ub^ri. Nec tantum sibi
soli, verum, and aliis salubris locis. Nam cum ipsa nullo serpatur angue,
asportata inde terra, quoquo gentium inv^ctasit, angues necat. All which is
very true, saving his last observation, That not so much as a Snake creeps in
this Isle; and that the Earth of it conveyed from hence, kills them
wheresoever they are found elsewhere, which proving nothing so, Isidore does
trifle, who says, It was so called Isidor: Etymol: lib.
from the death of Serpents brought thither. Aldus Printed it Athanatis. But
Salmasius finding Adtanatis in a very ancient book, mended it, At Tanatis,
assuring us that is the true name of the Isle; about which Annot: in Solinum.
Camers and Delrio (...).
so much trouble themselves, and of whom the former surmises it might be Pro
Vecta, sive Vectis.
Etta corrupted in Antonine; or else (but in that he is the whole Seas wide) to
be Ptolemies Agatha, which he places in the Mediterranean Sea, over against
Languedoc, and Province: whereas the site of Tanet is well known out of
Solinus, distant enough from thence. With far more probability does our Camden
conjecture it to have been Ptolemies Toliapis, especially finding it written
Toliatis in some old Copies. Beda calls it Tanatos, and exactly describes it,
as it was an Island in his days; whose words I will here set for better
satisfaction of them that seldom handle him: Eccles; hist: lib: 1. cap: 25.
Est ad Oriensalem Cantii plagam Tanatos insula non modica, idest, magnitudinis
juxta cortsuetudinem aestimation is Anglorum familiarum D C. (It is falsely
Printed miliarium in all Editions I have seen) quam a continenti terrae
secernit Vantsumu, qui est latitudinis circiter trium stadiorum, and duobus
tantum in locis est transmeabilis. Utrumq^ enim caput protendit in marc. That
is, On the East of Kent is Thanet, no small Isle, able to maintain six hundred
Families, which the River Wantsum divides from the main Land, above a quarter
of a mile over, and fordable only in two places, being brancht two several
ways, it runs into the Sea, making it an Island. But at this day it is but a
Peninsula, or By-land, one of the streams being dried up Pol: Vergil: Hist:
Angl: lib: 4.
some hundred years ago, or somewhat more, which parted it from the Continent
of Britain.

Now whereas Bid in the same place relates, That Augustine minor (for so
Ethel: Chronic: lib: 1.
Fabius Ethelwerd calls him, to difference him from S. Augustine of Hipps) the
Monk, who first converted the Saxons to the Christian Religion landed with his
Company in this Island, and that Ethelred the King of Kent came into the Island
to visit him: and also, that ancient Gotcel: Bertinian: in vita Augustini Cant.
Writers likewise report, That Ethelred had his Palace at old Rutupiae; I
cannot tell how Leland, Xenagog: Cantii page: 91.
Lambard, and Descript: Brit: lib: 1. cap: 8. See Camb: p. 3, 4.
Harrison could make it good, that Rutupiae stood in the Island; but that
since, as they say, the water changing its course, has shut it clean out.
Contrary to what Camden seems to have thought, and delivers concerning the
ancient situation of the place: Ad ausirale Wantsumi ostium, quod alveum
mutasse credunt, e regione insulae apposita fuit urbs, quae Ptolemaeo Rutupiae,
etc. At the mouth of Wantsum Southward (which some suppose, says he, has
changed its Channel) quite over against the Isle was a City, by Ptol. called
Rutupiae, etc. And so likewise long before him Talbot, whose conjecture also it
is, that Ptolemie therefore places it among the inland Cities Talbot: Annot:
MS. in A^onin.
Quod propter objectum Thanati, sive Tenedi, insulae pauso interrus sita
videatur; Because it seemed to stand more inwardly, by reason the Island Tanes
was placed just over against it. As for Ethelred's Palace, that it was
Rutupiae, no man will question their authority that writ it, who shall once
understand, that the old Saxon Kings through all Britain, constantly held their
residence in Roman Stations, which afterward by that meaas grew into great and
frequented Towns and Cities, as will easily appear to the not indiligent
Reader of Beda, and that in more then one place. And although I conceive much
may be said to prove that Rutupiae stood always on the main land, yet I, of
purpose, forbear to bring any thing of mine own the more to confirm it, till
such time as some good opportunity shall give me leave to visit the place, and
to become an eyewitness of the situation thereof. My main undertaking here is
only to illustrate the names in this Itinerary, with what I find in most
ancient memories, and Monuments of remotest times concerning them.

However in the mean while, we may do well to observe the strange and dismal
effects of the powerful execution of Time. Valleys exalted into Mountains,
and Juga montium diffluunt; totae desedere regiones. Ipsius naturae opera
vexantur. Sen. Ep: 92.
great Hills abased into Valleys; firm Land become a Sea, and the Sea again
turned into dry land: and in all things so great and various a change, that if
our Forefathers, who lived some Ages ago, could awake now for a time out of
their Graves (as they say Epimenides did out of his long sleep) they would meet
with so far a greate^ alteration then he, that they would either not at all
find, or else not know their own Country, and the very Land in which they were
born, and drew their breath so long together: So true is that of the excellent
Poet. Manilius Astron: lib: 1.
Eputae variant faciem per secula gentes;
Necse cognoscunt terrae vertentibus annis.
The Epulans still their Garb and Fashions change,
Whose Land, in time, unto it self grows strange.
And this is that Station, or City. -- Rutupiae notissima fama,
-- Rutupia most renowned:
Dives opum Veteri Roma dum regna manebant;
Nunc tantum simus and statio malefida carinis.
Rich whilst old Rome did the Worlds Empire sway;
Now a wild Road for Ships, and dangerous Bay.
So famous in old time while the Roman name and power was able to manage its
own Victories and greatness. Now it has little more to boast of then its
Ruins, which are themselves too How many, that I may so speak, whole Cities,
both men and Towns, H. Pomp-He^. and others, innumerable, are dead and gone.

almost perished; Some Roman Coins, as well Gold as Silver; The draught of its
streets crossing one another, which appear in the ^eilds, and are known to have
been so by the thinness of Corn in them after it is come up; the remainder of
some Walls of a Castle, of a rough Flint, and long British Bricks, in form of a
Quadrant: scarce, all put together, a shadow of its former Glory. And after so
many arguments both from the name, and other antiquities, to prove that Rutupia
had here its being, we shall have no need to confute them, who did so mordicu^
^en re (as Mr Frag: descriptonis Britan.
Floyd^ words are) Tooth and Nail maintain, that Dover was anciently so called,
any other ways than by a bare relating of their opinion; although indeed Dover
was a famous Haven-town, even in the Roman time, and named Dubris in this same
Itinerary, in which it is one of the three noted Havens upon this Coast. But of
that in its place; here, I am afraid, of Rutupiae too much.

STADIA] There have scarce been more great Nations in the World of ancient
times, then there have been also different Measures, thereby to know, not only
in Journeying the exact distance from place to place; but withal, the
quantities and space of Lands and Possessions. This we learn from Herodotus in
his second Muse, where he tells us, That the poorer sort among the Egyptians,
and such as had the smallest Possessions, used to measure by the (...), or
Passus, that is, by paces, which contained five Feet. They of a better
condition by the Stadium, which we take for our Furlong; of which more anon.
They that had larger Demeasnes then ordinary, by the Parasang. But the Owners
of great Lordships and Territories, measured altogether by the Schoenos. Now of
the two last, the former is by Grammarians said peculiarly to belong to the
Persians, the other properly to the Egyptians. But that indeed they were
promiscuously used by both Nations, appears not only by this Verse of Apud
Plut. lib. (...).
Challimachus, (...)
Nor measure Wisdom by the Persian Schoenes.
But by the Authority of Not: hist: lib: 6, cap: 26.
Pliny also, and other good Writers.

However the SCHOENOS was most properly the Egyptian measure, and it contained
two Parasangs, or threescore Stadia; as Herodotus also tells us in the same
place. Pliny observes how ancient Authors differ about the quantity of its
measure, as does Geograph: lib: 17.
Strabo likewise before him out of Art^midorus. But for further satisfaction in
this, the more exact and learned Reader may have recourse to the anciently
admired Geograph: lib: 1. cap: 11. 12.
Ptolemie, in whom you find it to consist not of above thirty Stadia. In Ioelem
cap: 3.
S Jerome, it should seem took it not for an Egyptian word (neither indeed have
I it in my Catalogue of such, collected out of old Writers) for he renders it
by (...), making it signify from the Greek: In Nilo flumine, says he, solent
naves sunibus trah^re, certa habentes spatia, quae appellant funiculos; they
use to tow, or hale their Ships with Ropes, for certain limited and distinct
spaces, which they call (...), along the shoars of Nilus. (...), signifying a
Rope, but especially such a one as is made of Bul-^shes.

The PARASANGA was, apud Persas viarum (...), a measure of ways among the
Persians, says Feslu^. The Etymologists deduce it from (...) Parash, A
Horsman, and Unde (...). Math. 5. 41.
(...) Angari, which in Hesychius, is (...) a Persi in word; and he interprets
it, The Kings Messengers, or Letter-Carriers (called also in the same Language
Hes^ch: Said. Eustath. (...).
Astande) placed in equidistant Stations, or Mansions; as does Suidas also,
following Herod: lib: 8.
Herodotus, and Antiq: lib: 11. cap. 6.
Josephus. This measure consisted of XXX. Stadi^, as Herodotus writes in the
place before cited, In (...).
and elsewhere. So Apud Suidam.
Xenophon, Hist: de Bellis Justin. l. 11.
Agathias, Hesychius, Suidas. But Strabo is very inconstant, according to the
diverse Authors he uses in several places, making it sometimes thirty (as the
most) sometime forty, sometime sixty Stadia. Agathias, though he follow the
former authority for the measure, yet he uses not the word, but for it sets
down (...), somewhat answerable to it, which signifies resting, or baiting
places. And for Hesychius, though he grant thirty Stad. for the measure, yet
you shall find in him moreover, (...) The Parasang contains four miles. But
then he counts but seven Stad. and an half to the mile, and so it agrees
exactly with his former reckoning, thirty Stadia; of which measure more anon,
it having in the mean while occasioned the mentioning of these others. And here
I may by no means omit, That by the Persians even to this day it is called
(...) Farsang; the name not yet quite corrupted, or abolisht; as also by Cod:
MS.
Abulseda the Geographer, who says it was esteemed but three miles by the
Ancients, as well as Moderns: Which observation we owe to the exactly learned
Mathematitian Praes: ad lib: de Pede Rom: ad Claris: Seldenum.
Mr. John Greaves of Oxford. But that I my self may observe some measure, and
have done with it; I will refer them that desire to know more, either
concerning the Arabian Parasangs, in the Nubian Geography of George Elmacinus,
or the Jewish Parasangs, in Benjamin Tudelensis his Itinerary, and how they
differed one from the other, to what he shall find in Constantinus, L'
Emperor's discourse, by way of Preface thereunto. And so much in this place of
the Persian Parasang.

The ancient Gauls journyed by the LEUCA, or LEUGA; which Histor: lib. 15.
Ammian. M^rcellinus in plain words does witness, where he describes the
beginning of Gaul: Exindeque, says he, non ^enis, passibus, sed (...) Itinera
metiuntur: From thence they measure not their Journeys by Miles, but by
Leagues. Now the Leuca or Lea^ue, as we call it, was exactly a mile and half,
or M D. paces. Iornandes sets it so plainly down, Leuga Gallica mill and
quingentorum passuum (...). A Gallic league is a thousand and five hundred
paces. And we may as plainly collect just so much out of the same His^: lib 16.
Ammianus, where, speaking of the Wars which Julian. Ca^ar made in Gaul, he
has these words, A loco unde Romana promota sunt signa, adusque val^um
Barbaricum, quarta l^uca signaliatur and de^ima; idest, unum and viginti millia
passuum: From the place, whence the Roman Ensigns were advanced, to the Wall
(so it is in English) or Fortress of the Enemies, were fourteen leagues; that
is, one and twenty miles. Such another passage is in the Acts of the Martyrdom
of S. (...), which I forbear not to transcribe hither; Ab Aurelianense Urbe
usque (...) civitatem, quae III. ^ugdunensis (...), perhibentur stadia (...),
milliaria sep^a, inta quinque; (...), quae adhuc veteri Gal^rum (...),
quinquaginta: From Orleance to Tour^ are said to be six hundred Stadia, seventy
five miles, fifty leagues, as they are yet called in the old Gallic Language:
Although this supputation agrees not with what it is at this day. Besides if
you look into this very same Itinerary of Antoninus in our hands, you shall
find some Journeys in Gaul, which indeed have the miles set down, but resolved
into leagues: others reckon it only by leagues, (neither of which he does in
any other Roman Province) and it exactly observes the forenamed proportion, as
Lunna M. P. XV. l^ng. X. etc. as far as Gessoriacum over against our shore, of
which you have former mention. So that Origin: lib: 15. cap: 16.
Isidorus by all means is to be corrected, and read, Luca finitur mill
passibus quingentis; in the Printed book mill being left out, either by the
oversight of the Transcriber of the Copy, or else of the Composer. This was
observed before me, by one who was (...). Concerning the leagues of later
people, and times, I refer you to the very same most industrious and judicious
Spelman: in Archaologo.
Antiquary.

The measure which the Germans of old times used, was the RASTA: Hieron: in
Joel; cap: 3.
Viarum spatia rastas appellat universa Germania. All Germany calls the
spaces of ways, Rastae. What quantity of way this contained, we cannot know
better then from the old Agrimensores, or Surveyors of Land, among the
Gromaticall Authors, where you read page 14. Edit. Paris.
M l^iarius and dimidius apud Gallos Leuvam facit, habentem passus mill
quingentos. Duae Levae, seu milliarii tres, apud Germanos unam rastem
efficient. A mile and half among the Gauls makes a league, which contains M D.
paces; two leagues, or three miles make a R^sta among the Germans.

To these we might add some other Dimensions of distances. intended for the
benefit of Travelers, as the DEXTRI: but to what people they belonged is
uncertain. The old Diction: M S. in Biblioth: Coll: K. Oxoniis.
Papias renders them, Passus mensurandi apud quosd^m; but he tells us not whom:
you shall meet with them also in Florentius concerning the Acts (...)

also consisted of paces, as an old Author urged by Salmt in Solin: p. 688.

we find in Plutarch; whence the usual expression grew, Ad tertium ab Urbe

Pillars which also were called Cippi, we find in Strabo, (...), because in the
high ways from Rome, such (...), or Pillars, were placed at each miles end:

Chronicler: yet by him, as also Suidas, it is described rather as an Edifice;
when as the other is expressly called (...). Plut.
A Golden Pillar. For the very same purpose, as the Learned Camden is of
opinion, was that Stone set up with us in Canning-street, called London-stone,
alleging to confirm his conjecture, the placing of it in the midst of the
City, where it runs on in length, and within that way the old Roman Street or
High way did lead, which, forth with going along from it, is called
Watling-street; of which elsewhere I shall have more occasion to speak. In the
mean while I must by no means let pass, that the miles used in this Itinerary,
are much shorter then the shortest this day in Italy, or any where else; they
being but precisely M. paces, as aforesaid: which in more places then one in
this ensuing work, we shall be put to it to remember you of. For whereas the
ordinary league now a days is accounted three miles, it may not be understood
of these in the Itinerary, but the usual ones, according to the measure of
later ages; This will appear by the intervalls of Stones remaining even to our
times, with their Inscriptions yet legible in diverse places; especially in
Portugal, wherein the Military, or Highway to Emerita Augusta (so called from
the Emeriti placed there by Angustus, now)Merida the several Pillars
inscribed, do distinguish the several miles, and they that have taken a
dimension of the space (among others is (...) sium Cent: 3. epist: 59.
Charolus Clusins a very learned man) do affirm that four of them do make up
one league, as it is considered now a days: And for the Mile so much.

The STADIUM (which occurring in this place, has given us occasion to mention
the foregoing measures) was the more especial dimension of the Grecians in
ancient times, and also in later, as well by Sea, as Land. For the use of it by
Sea, this Itinerary in this very place does show it; so that I need not much to
urge that place in S. John's Gospel: John 6. 19.
And putting forth about five and twenty, or thirty [(...)] Furlongs, as we
translate it. Nor that neither in Cicero Cic. ad Titonem lib: 16. epist: 9.

contains the description of a Voyage of his from beyond the promontary of

from Caesarea to Puteoli, and so to Rome, most accurately set down by Act: cap:
27. and 28.
Luke the Historian of the Acts of the Apostles, neither of them unsuitable to
this discourse. The Sea-stadium seems to have differed from that by Land, which
we observe from Thucyd: hist: lib: 6.
Thucydides, where he tells us, that the compass of Sicily is little less then
eight days sail for a Ship, and though so great, is yet divided with no more
then twenty Furlongs, Sea measure, from the Continent. We cannot seek beyond
Herodotus to learn the measure of the stadium, which thus he expresses, Herod:
Luterpe, sive lib: 2.
(...). The Interpreters thus render it; Centum autens justi passus sunt
stadium unum sex jugerum turnius: (...), by Passus, which indeed is described
by Pol: Onomast: lib: 2.
Pollux to be the measure, or space, from the extremity of each long Finger
cross the breast, when both arms are stretched out, which in English we call a
Fathom; and about that quantity Herodotus expresses it to be in the next
words, Passus inquam mensurae sex pedum, sive quatuor cubitorum. So then it is
mensura pedum sexcentorum. Herodotus his stadium will be of a hundred and
twenty ordinary paces, and just so many does Maximus Planudes, or whosoever
else translated Caesar's Commentaries into Greek, allow, resolving his miles
into stadia, as appears. Commonly they make a Stadium to be a hundred and
twenty five paces, and so eight of them will be just M. passus, or a mile; yet
others reckon but seven and a half to it; as Iae: Gothofr de Suburb: Reg: p. 13.

have spoken concerning the stadium, and other measures of ways, if not perhaps
more then enough. But I always think of that of Pliny, Plin. epist: 2. lib: 6.
Satius est supervacua dici, quam non dici necessaria. It follows.

STAD. NUMERO CCCCL.] In the Maritine Itinerary of Simlers Edition, which
follows this, you have but CCCCI. Certainly it should be mended from hence,
for it is right so in that of Aldus. We will here take a view of the several
passages in old time, and how they differed, according as several Authors have
set them down. And first Caesar, who had the credit first of any Roman to sail
hither, tells us, that not only Caes: Com: 4, and 5.
brevissimum a portu Iccio, but also Commodissimum in Britanniam transjectum
esse ignoverat, circiter millium passuum XXX. a continenti; the shortest, and
most convenient cut, into Britain was from Portus Iccius. In Caesar's best
Copies you have XL. as Merula witnesses, which, says he, according to our
reckoning at this day, will be thirteen leagues, or German miles: and much
about such a distance between the shoars by Gessoriacum, or Bononia (West of
which, and very near, he supposes Itius to have been; but Cluverius, as you
have heard, thought them the same) and the nearest Coast of England. This
Iccius in Ortelius is Sithien, as it were, Sinus Itius: and in Camden, it is
Vitsan. But De Portu Iccio, there is extant a particular discourse of one
Jacobus Chiffletius; and the learned Mer. Casaub. Comment. de 4. linguis ubi de
lingua veteri Anglica.
Doctor Casaubon gives us hope, we shall ere long see a Discertation of the
same subject by Master William Somner, an accute and industrious Antiquary of
Canterbury; and so clear those doubts which have so long held us uncertain,
notwithstanding studious and diligent disquisition about it. The correction of
this place the learned Is. Casaub. in Strab. lib. 4.
Is. Casaubon the others Father (for Casaubon is nothing but a name of great
learning) much approves of, especially because it was so in that Book of his,
which Strabo used so long ago (...), he arrived the next day having sailed
CCCXX. Stad. which will make XL. miles. Neither does Eustath. in Dionysij.
(...).
Eustathius his setting down, (...), that is three hundred Stadia; or thirty
seven miles and a half, where he in relating Caesar's passage, word for word
almost follows Strabo, trouble us at all, as knowing that he, as well as other
good writers, makes use of the round or even, little minding the overplus
number: except any one will say it is the Transcribers, or Composers
heedlesnesse, who for (...), might copy out (...) which yet I think not. Now
indeed the same Strabo writes, that there were, as I told you before, IV.
passages, (...), which they commonly make use of going into the Island; From the
mouths of the Rhene, of the Sein, of the Loire, and of the Garonne. He tells us
also in the same Book, that the passage, from the Lexobii and Casetes into
Britain, is (...), l^sse then a days sailing. Yet admitting that, whereas he
says that the passage from Rhene, and Sequana, is but 320. Stadia, the very
distance, (according to him) from Itius, or the shoares of the Morini, surely
therein he mistakes himself, being able to speak more exactly, would he but
have remembered himself. For the Sein is much remoter from the Coast of Britain,
and Zosim. Hist. lib. 4.
Zosimus the Greek Historian affirms, that from the parts lying by the mouth
of the Rhene to this Island, are 900. Stadia, which resolved into English miles,
make 112, and a half.

But others make the nearest passage into Britain X. miles further then Caesar.
As Plin. Hist. Nature. lib. 4. cap. 16.
Pliny; Britannia abest a Gessoriaco Morinorum gentis littore proximo trajectu
L. millium minimum: Britain is distant from Gessoriacum (which was Iccius, as
you heard, or very near it) fifty miles at least. Take notice of that minimum,
for others, as Antoninus here, make the distance 56. miles and a quarter. So
Dio Hist. Romans lib. 39.
Dio Cassius, speaking of Caesar's first expedition, (...), the very shortest
cut is CCCCL. Stadia, that is 56. miles and a quarter. Venerable Beda, the
ancient glory of our Nation, puts together, for better satisfaction, both the
sums. His words are, speaking of Rutupiae: Beda Eccl. Hist. Angl. lib. 1.
cap. 1.
Interposito mari a Gessoriaco Morinorum gentis littore proxima trajectu
milliarium quinquaginta, sive, ut quidam scripsere, stadiorum quadringentorum
quinquaginta. In the former he follows Pliny, in the latter, I am confident he
had his eye upon this very place of Antoninus. For Dio was an Author scarce
known, if at all, in his age. Later times made us acquainted with him, and with
what ancient memorialls of ours he has happily reskued from the devouring
jaws of oblivion and time, which soonest consume the best and noblest
Monuments. But I had wel-nigh forgotten the distance in Diodor. lib. 5.
Biblioth. (...). Appian. Alexandr. (...) Iberico.
Diodorus Siculus: (...). The least cut over is from the Fore-land of Kent,
which they say is distant from the Continent about a 100. Stadia, that is 12.
miles, and an half. What to think of it, I know not, but that the number is
corrupted in this place. It is to be greived therefore that we have lost
Diodorus his fortieth Book of his Histories, in this here mentioned by him,
wherein he tells us he would set down the British matters, or Caesar's invasion;
out of Caesar it is most likely (for in his age he lived) and so the loss
comes to be so much the less.

And now, having after an uneven passage, arrived safe in the Island, let us
more luckily, if we can, begin our journeying upon sure ground, which yet we
shall not do from this very place where we first landed. We must take our way
then in the Inland, as we see it set down, and scor'd out for us.

THE FIRST JOURNEY.
A LIMITE, ID EST, A VALLO, PRAETORIUM USQ. M. P. CLVI.] This first Journey is
from the LIMES, or bound of the Roman Empire in the North part of our Britain,
XIV. miles beyond the Picts Wall, as they call it, or Severus his Valum; to
Patrington, an old Haventown upon the Yorkeshire-side of Humber, called by
Ptolemie, (...), or Ptol. Geograp. lib. 2.^
Aestuarium Abi.

ID EST, A VALLO.] The learned Camden, by a right conjecture, advises to
exclude these words [id est a Vallo] as a glossema foisted in by some sciolus,
who endeavoring to illustrate the text, has made it more obscure, and the
site of the first station in this Journey, and so of the rest, less easily to
be guessed at. And yet two very learned men, but strangers indeed to our
Affairs, have still retained and asserted them: so much could the fame of
Severus Wall do. Itinerarium, Vallum, imperii limitem, appellat (says Guide.
Pancirol. Comm. in Notit. Occid. Imperii cap. 89.
Guidus Pancirolus: (The Itinerary) he means this in our hands) makes the Wall,
the Limet, or boundary, of the Empire in Britain. And Jerome Surita the
Spaniard, who has written a Commentary upon this very Itinerary (which yet in
Thuan. in Suritae Elogio.
Thuanus judgment might better have been entitled Variae Lectiones) tells us,
that ratio ipsa docet, reason it self shows, Bremenium opidum in Valli
limite, that Bremenium, a Town by the Wall, was made choice of, as a set place
to begin this Journey at. Whereas by this Itinerary, Bremenium which is the
Limes, must needs stand XIV. miles beyond the Wall, as we shall see hereafter.

Castles were ever thought of most efficacy, and serviceablenesse to repel the
Enemy; and there remaining, yet the carcasses, or ruins, of many to be seen
hereabout, we may well place the Limes, or bound of the Empire here, about the
time this Itinerary was published, in this place; the unreduced Northern people
having made their impression near so far, bearing down Antoninus Pius his Wall
in Scotland.

And yet, though we cannot admit, that the Vallum was the Limes in this place,
we grant however it was built and already reared up at that time, as appears by
the next journey, which begins at Blatum bulgium, or Bulnesse, an old Station
at the end of the Wall in Cumberland. And had Bremenium been so near the Wall,
he would have begun this Journey A VALLO, as well, and rather, then the next,
without A LIMITE; or else in the next to have added A Limite also. But if any
shall by way of objection urge that place out of the Novell Constitutions of
Theodosius the Emperor: M^jorum dispositione Vallo Limitis ab incursione
Barbarica defensatur, quicquid intra Romani nominis concluditur potestatem:
Whatsoever was Roman in old time, was kept with the rampire of a Limet from the
incursion of enemies; we have nothing then to say for our selves, but that
Bremenium was one of those Agraciae stationes, which Vegetius speaks of, used
in the Roman warfare, to be placed in solo Barbarico, upon the Enemies ground,
to descry and reveal what new attempts and stirs they made: such as were those
Exploratores, I may render them Scouts, placed at Bremenium for that purpose,
as we shall see by the following Inscription.

These Grounds and lands recovered from the Enemies, Alexander Severus, the
Emperor bestowed on the Captains [Limitaneis ducibus] and Soldiers of the
Marches, so that they became their propriety, if their heirs served likewise
there as Soldiers, supposing they would provemore heedfull and wary in defense
of what they supposed to be their own, Verba haec velim notes, says judicious
Camden, nam hinc vel species feudi, vel origo feudorum. But have recourse to
himself at thy leisure, Gentle Reader.

And here, having taken notice of Theodosius his Testimony concerning the
ancient fencing of the Limits of the Empire, we may do well to give notice of
those several Stations in his time, placed per lineam Valli, to keep off the
frequent inrodes of the more Northernly Britains, called the Picts, as also of
the Scoti Attacotti, and others. But a more special survey of them, standing
much nearer the Wall then Bremenium, will be taken more conveniently elsewhere
out of the Notitia Occidentalis Imperii, written not long before the power of
the Empire began to decline in Britain; and because it contains the State of
the Roman Affairs here in his days, it is called by Andr. Alciat, the famous
Lawyer of the last age, Theodosii Breviarium, as is already said in what goes
before. Concerning the Limes Saxonicus in Britain, you may see more in Comment.

M. P. CLVI.] From the Limes, or Bound, to Praetorium, or Patrington, are set
down in the foot of the Account 156. miles: and to so many do the particular
numbers arise, if with Aldus, and Simlerus, we make the distance from Isurium
to York to be 17. miles, not as in Surita's edition, 14. but he notes withal
that he found 17. in two of his Copies: And that is the distance between these
two Stations in the next Journey of his Edition: although in Aldus and Simler
it be 18. The Interpolation, and corruption, of numbers, not in Ptolemie only,
but in our Antoninus also, has been the maine cause of doubt and difficulty in
assigning the right places to many mansions in them both. But now we come to
examine, after this preamble, the particulars of the Journey it self:

A BREMENIO.] Here then we begin at Bremenium, some XIV. miles beyond the Wall.
The name of this Station has met with much interpolation, whether through the
transcribers fault, or Composers at the Press, or both, it much matters not.
Aldus has Ab Remaenio; but that may be soon mended. Simler Prints it Bramenio;
which Ortelius seems to accept of, and our Harris. Descrip. Britan. lib. 4. ad

William Harrison follows him. Bremenio, as it appears, was constantly written
in all those old Books, and they not a few, which Surita used; otherwise, he
would have noted it. So likewise all Ptolemies Copies have it, which I have
seen [(...)] except that, which otherwise is accounted the very best, published
by Petrus Bertius out of the Palatin MS. where you have (...) Aremenium;

It means thus much: The Companies of Scouts receiving double pay; or rather,
the Soldiers of the Band or Company of the Scouts receiving double pay,
dedicated an Altar at Bremenium to his Majesty (you must conceive some Roman
Emperor:) When they made good this their Vow willingly, as by him deserved:
Caepio Charitimus (for so it must be read) was then their Tribune, or chief
Commander.) It is a piece of Antiquity highly to be valued, almost near
veneration, which having still preserved the name and memory of the decayed
Station, may now be instead of a Tombstone to it fallen into 'its own ashes, as
well as it was formerly erected for a Monument to the Emperors honor, and for
his safety. And if Cicero could make such boast for finding out the Grave of
the Mathematician Cic. Tuscul. Quaest. 5.
Archimedes, humilis homunculi, as he says, a very mean man, not full two
hundred years after his Burial, yet quite unknown to his Country men the
Syracusians, how much more deservedly might our Camaen have taken upon him,
who, after thirteen hundred years at least, discovered the name and ruins of
the most valiant and resolute Garrison of Britain, the Bulwark sometimes, and
defense of the Natives, as well as the Provincialls. Wherefore to illustrate it
a little, in behalf of the Youth of this Island, studious of glorious things
long before their own times, I shall account no loss of time, or my pains.

DUPL.] There were in the Roman Malitia, Duplares; such as received double pay,
double provision of Corn, raiment, etc. and Simplares; who had only single
pay. The Duplares were also named Duplicarii; quibus ob virtutem duplicia
cibaria ut darentur institutum est, Varro de L. L. lib. 4.
says Varro. The Greeks called them Ian. Rut. Variar. lib. 5. cap. ^0: in

Maxim: lib: 3: cap: 2.
whose valor so extraordinarily appeared upon the British Coast, in Caesari
time, and whose name is so rife in our History, was the Centurion of this

every where here about upon the Limet, by excellent reason deserved double pay,
and encouragement.

N.] Numeri. In the ages of the declining Empire, the Legions themselves by
little and little came to be called Numeri. There is a special place in
Sozomenus his Ecclesiastical History; Sozomen. lib. 1. cap. 9.
(...) (by which word, as also by (...), not only the Auxiliae, and the
greatest Companies, and numbers whatever, but the Legions also are to be
understood in Zosimus, and others.) (...), which now they call Numeri. And the
command over such a Body of men, could not but be thought very honorable, when
as Valentinian the Emperor having made Fraomarius King of a Nation of the
Almains, somewhat overrun with war, to make him amends for his harassed
Kingdom, he dispatches him into Britain, and bestows upon him the
Tribune-Ship of the Numerus Alemannorum there, Amm. Marcel. lin. Histor. lib.
29.
multitudine viribusque ea tempestate florenti, excelling at that time for
multitude, and strength. The Tribune here, is C. Caepio Charitimus; of whom we
know nothing else.

EXPLOR.] They were the Scout-watch, always upon the Guard, to learn and
discover, what inrodes and invasions were attempted by the Enemies upon the
Frontiers. By the ancient Greeks they were called Ebr. 11. 31.
(...), who were sent out todescry the motions of the Enemy. But I conceive
they were no others, then such as by stealth, and in a skulking way, did what
they did; as the Spies, which Rahah entertained at Josh. 2. (...).
Jericho; Ulysses, and Diomedes; as also Dolon, in (...).
Homer, upon whom Eustathius, expounding the word [(...)] (for in him Hector is
called (...) Troiae; that is, Defender, and Guardian: and such are they, whose
careful watching preserves the people:) he does it by (...), interpreting it,
(...), they that are sent to the Enemies; that is, to spy out and discover
their doings. Hence have you in Cicero ad Atticum, and Plutarch. in Catone.
Plutarch, (...), Exploratoria navigia; and Catascopum, perhaps in Hirt. lib.

(...), and renders it Exploratores. In the later place Bon. Vulcanius restores
(...), which at that time was usual for Auscultatores, of which see especially
the admired Iac. Cujac. Observar. lib. 6. cap. 33.
Cujacius, besides Meursius in his Greek Glossary.

But to have done. In several places else there is mention of the Exploratores
in Britain; perhaps in, or near upon the same age. In the next Journey of
Antoninus there is, Castra Exploratorum. And in the Notitia, or Survey of the
Western Empire, Praefectus Numeri Exploratorum Lavatre; a place on this side
the Wall. And Praepositus Numeri Exploratorum Portu Adurni, sub dispositione V.
Spectabili; Comitis littoris Saxonici per Britanniam; an Haven in Sussex-coast;
all which you shall meet with, by that we leave off. Briefly, and not be
troublesome, the Stations appointed for the purpose we have all this while
spoken of, are handsomely called ^r, (...).
(...), i. Towns of view or discovery, by Aristides the Orator in his
Panegyric of the City Rome. Many of this kind did Dioclesian, after other
Emperors, out of his providence appoint upon the Limets of the Empire, as Ios.
Histor. lib. 2. (...), etc.
Zosimus relates, all which that Constantine the Great did afterward dismantle,
I have some good reason, from the writers no good effection to him, not to
believe. And thus much for this Inscription, so highly to be valued, as I said
before; without which we had never known for Antonine where Bremenium was to be
found; though Ptolemie indeed afford some light thereto, the situation well
enough agreeing with the numbers in him; and yet for all that among so many
several ruins of old Camps, and Fortresses near one another, hardly
otherwise to have been pointed out from the rest. That it was therefore at
Rochester, besides what has been said, the name at this day, as is before
hinted, will evidently conclude; it signifying as much as Castrum in Rupe, the
Camp or Station on the Rock; a fit place for the purpose it was here placed.
And indeed it is to be observed that all places ending in Chester, fashioned in
the Saxon times, arise from the ruins of the old Roman Castra; and therefore
the ancient Stations about the Wall, the carcasses of many of which at this day
appear, are called Chesters by the Country people. Besides, all the Roman
Colonies, Towns, Stations, or Forts, generally were set upon Hills: Manil.
Astron. lib. 2.
which Manilius the Poet does elegantly in these verses express. Ac veluti
nudis surgunt cum moenibus Urbes,
Conditor and vacuos muris circundare Colles
Destinat --
And as great Cities rise with Turrets Crowned,
Whose Hills when Builders skilfully surround,
With spacious Walls --


But it is a pitiful thing to see how other learned men have mis-placed this
Garrison, and in vain searched for it. Talbot looks for it at the East End of
the Wall: but at last resolves it was at Bamborough Castle near Berwick. Mich.
Villanovanus, and Paulus Jovius will have it at Berwick. Jos. Moletius sets
down Brevish (a Town I am yet to seek for in the Map.) to his Ptolemie, whom
our Will. Fulke, a studious Antiquary, as well as a great Divine, dissents not
from: but to Antonine he noted Bambarow, as Talbot had done before. And Camden
himself had pitched upon Bramton in Northumberland likewise, til he had the
good hap to light upon this Stone. And so much of Bremenium. We go forward.

CORSTOPILUM M. P. XX.]
Robert Talbot, though Priest and Canon, yet scarce shows himself to be
Sacerdos ad Grammaticam, as he said, when he tells us, Ad Iter. 11. in
Brovonacis.
that in this Itinerary, ferme est perpetuum, ut nomen loci, ad quem sit motus
in Dativo ponatur. Surita, though a better Grammarian, as putting the name of
the place, whereto motion is, in the Surita in Antonin. p. 188.
Accusative case, according to rule, not the Dative, yet therein also is he far
mistaken in these writings, and others. And though he lay the fault, for that
it is otherwise, in omnibus codicibus, upon the inscitia librariorum, qui in
summa earum rerum ignaratione, temporum vitio, versabantur; yet truly therein
he does but discover his own inanimadvertency; not taking notice, that from the
age Solinus lived in (not long after Pliny) and so downward, by a custom they
had, they pronounced the names of Cities in the sixth, or Ablative case; that is
as Monootes, or undeclined. Testimonies there are enough of this Vopiscus in
the life of Aurelian: Copto and Ptolemaide urbes cepit; and Salmasius desires
you to see what he says to that place. Solinus, though falsely corrected in
vulgar Prints, otherwise then in the old written Books Solin. cap. De Hispania.
Ibi Olysipone Ulyxi condituni: where you see no Concord. Fronto, the famous
Orator, in an Epistle to Hadrian the Emperor, cited by the Grammarians:
Durocortono Athenae vestrae, where you are to look for no Apposition. As
neither in the old Book De Colonijs, where you constantly find, Opidum
Corseolis. Colonia Veiis, etc. So that good Surita ad Antonin. page 188.
Surita needed not so earnestly to contest, and chafe himself, about Popleto
fiumen, in Antonie. But lest my credit should not be enough (for alas what can
a poor Country Schoolmaster do?) hear him, whose authority is unquestionable,
(...). Cl. Salmas. Exercit. ad Solini. cap. 23. and ibid. page 777.
Itinerarium, quod Antonini Augusti nomine publicatur, says Salmasius, sic
omnia fere urbium vocabula concipiebat; quod mutatum non oportuit a doctis
viris. We should then by this read here: Bremenio Corstopilo. But all editions,
and MSS. having it in the Accusative Case; and Salmasius himself, as you see,
dispencing somewhat with the general Rule, as it ordinarily happens; take
your pleasure, for me, which way you will have it written; However I must not
omit to note here, that all other Editions, as many as I have seen, except that
of Aldus, have Corstopitum; with little change of one letter; And Surita denies
not but that it was so in one of his Manuscripts.

By the distance, and site, it seemed to the learned Camden to be the same with
Ptolemies (...), Curia; though indeed formerly for Corstopitum, he had pitched
upon Morpith. Which conjecture, as it may be countenanced perhaps by the
distance from Bremenium, and also by a like sound of both names upon the close;
yet has it not to show any Roman Antiquity now appearing. Be it therefore
Curia (or rather (...), as Bertius his Ptolemy;) and then it will be Corbridge
on Tine, which here is laid over with a Bridge: But in Corstopitum, what the
last syllables signify, I am to learn; and which is worse, have none to teach
me. Henry of Huntington calls it Cure; so Antonines Curia among the Rhoeti, is
at this day called Chur; by the Italians Coira. Hoveden names it Corobrigg; to
have recourse to whom will be worth ones pains. And yet not precisely Corbridge
neither; but rather Rotchester, a place hard by, well furnished with store of
Roman ruins, and rubbish; which declare what it has been formerly; called
most likely by the Saxons Corchester, from this Coria; but in process of time,
as he said, Ovid. in Fa^is de Lemurib. (...) Remo.
Aspera mutata est in lenem tempore longo.

And from the ashes and carcass of this, had the present Town its rise.
Besides the termination from Castrum, that is, a Garrison; take notice, that
almost all our great Cities, and Towns in Britain and elsewhere, had their
beginnings from the Roman Casira; but were not always placed in the very same
site, but at some distance, though not very remote; as S. Abane, from
Verulamium; and most others. As for the account of distance here M. P. XX.] It
will be sufficiently convenient, and suitable, reckon which way so ever you are
pleased.

VINDOMORAM M. P. IX.]
Surita, telling us he could not elsewhere find any mention concerning
Vindomora, adds moreover, that all his written Books agreed in hanc auserendi
casu lectionem; which confirms what we said e'rewhile. From Corstopitum to
this Station are IX miles set down: and toward Newcastle, along by the Wall, at
that distance is situate, as the learned Pausanias of Britain tells us, a small
Village called Walls-end, which now seems to have possession of the Room of
this Station. The signification, says he, of the old, as well as the modern
name, is the same: for Vindomora, in the Provincial Language of the Britains
at that time, was nothing but Finis Muri, or, The end of the Wall. For beyond
it no Vestigia of the ductus, or tract thereof appearing ever to have been
there; the River Tine, it is to be thought, served for a Rampire, or
antemur^le, to keep off the Enemy. Neither does Vindobala (another ancient name
of the same Village, and of a like composition, mentioned in the Notitia
Occidentis:) signify otherwise then so. Wherefore from hence (besides that the
Wall in Salmasius his MS. Aethicus is called Ballum Britanniae:) we must take
notice of that fraudulent distinction in the learned Presbyter Beda: Beda
Eccley. Histor. lib. 1. cap. 5.
[Murus de lapidibus; Vallum de cespitibus, etc.] which so deceived the good
man, that he believed this Work of Severus (even where he relates the thing
done:) To be of Turfs, in which were great stakes fastened, not of Stone. But
if we compare Eutropius, Jerome, Orosius, Cassiodorus, and Aurelius Victors
Epitone de Caesaribus, where they use Vallum, speaking of this structure of
Severus; with Aurel. Victor set forth by Andrias Schottus; and others, which
have Murus, we shall certainly see, that they are but Synonima to express the
same thing. Spartinus, as the place in him is rightly restored by the famous
Salmasius, has it plain: Severus post Murum aut Vallum missum in Britannia:
And Bid himself makes mention of a Royal Town, Idem ibid. lib. 3. cap. 21.
qui vocatur ad Murum, aee Palle, as King Alfred renders it; because it was
placed by Severus Wall; and at this day therefore called Walton. So likewise
our Antonine reckons up among the Towns of Pannonia prima, or Hungary, a place
called Ad Muro. which Wolfanyus Lazius takes for the same with Murocincta Amm.
Marcellin. lib. 30. edit. Linde. brogianae nam in Rob. Stephani deest, cui
liber ille est (...).
in Ammianus; I believe for no other cause, or reason.

Now, as it is needless to bring authority from the ancients, to prove that
this structure was of stone, every one that at this day has been in the least
way an (...), or eyewitness thereof, certainly knowing it; so shall it serve
for enough to demonstrate that Murus and Vallum, signified the very same thing:
contrary to what the Venerable Bede believed and wrote; (...). And
consequently, that Vindomora, and Vindobala, though somewhat differing names,
do yet belong to the very same Mansion.

And for what Camden says, that they were so called in the Provincial
Language of the Britains, the studions Youth is to take notice, that, as the
Provinciated part of the Roman Empire was Civitate donata, or made free of the
City; and out of them their old Hinc miles provincialis, pro legionario: Hygino.
Legions recruited, and new ones also raised, the un-reduced serving for
Auxiliaries; and that by a Law of Antoninus Pius the Emperor, thus cited by
Ulpian. Ulp. l. 22. ad Edictum.
In Orb Romano qui sunt ex Constitutione Imp. Antonini cives Romani effecti
sunt. Which Claud. Paneg. 3. in Stiliconem.
Claudian the Poet, speaking of Rome, and instancing in Britain in particular,
has neatly, as his manner is, thus expressed. Nec stetit Ociano, remisque
ingressa profundum,
Vincendos alio quaestvit in orb Britannos.
Haec est in gremium victos quae sola recepit,
Humanumque genus communi nomine fovit;
Matris, non dominae ritu, civesque vocavit
Quos domuit nexuque piolong inqua revinxit.
Nor stops she there but crossed the Sea with Oars,
Britain, a new unconquered World, explores:
Then in her lap receives whom she did tame,
And to all Nations gives one common name;
She as a Mother not a Victresse calls
Them hers, the distant joining to her Walls.


So likewise in the Provinces (a constant course put in practice, by what ever
Conqueror, among a people newly subdued:) was the Roman tongue every where
commended, and urged for public use to the Natives: Imperiosa illa civitas
etc. That domineering City, Augustine. de C. D. lib. 19.
says S. Austine, not only put a yoke of servitude upon the conquered
Nations, but enjoined their Language also. As for Britain, there is a notable
place of Tacitus in his Agricola, where he speaks of the courses he took to
civilize them: Iam vero principum filios liberalibus artibus crudire, and
ingenia Britannorum studijs Gallorum ante far, ut qui modo linguam Romanorum
abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent: inde etiam habitus nostri honor and
frequens toga. That is, Moreover the Noble-mens sons he took and instructed in
the liberal Sciences, preferring the wits of the Britains before the Students
of Gaul, as being now curious to attain the eloquence of the Roman Language,
whereas they lately rejected the speech. After that our attire grew to be in
account, and the Gown much used among them. Thus far Tacitus, and so fully,
that I need not bring in hither that of Juvenall in his 15. Satyr. Gallia
Causidicos docuit facunda Britannos.
Eloquent Gallia Britains taught to plead.


Neither did the nobler sort only thus liberally employ their studies and
endeavors, but the meaner also generally had their Language interpolated, and
mixed with the Latin; which though now left and abandoned, yet there remain of
it in the British, those relics, that time it self will not easily wipe
away, and deface. Of some words therein Humfrey Lhuyd, a singular Ornament of
his own Wales and Britain in general, has gathered a list; and William
Salisbury in his British Glossary, and Doctor David Powell, in his accurate
writings, by no means deny it; men as learned as any of the Nation.

Vindobala, as this Station was otherwise named in the Notitia of the W.
Empire, had its being, Sub dispositione Viri Spectabilis Ducis Britanniarum per
lineam Valli, where there lay in Garrison Tribunus Cohortis primae Frixagorum.
For whom why Camden substituted the Cohors II. Thracum, who are placed indeed
in the same Notitia at Gabrosentum, or Gateshed against Newcastle, not quite
three miles off, I know not; except I say it is a light (...), or oversight of
his, such as may well be excused. But of what people these here were, I must
take day to tell you: Neither name of the Station has had the luck, to have
the right site found out, till Camden came. For Talbot making it his business
to illustrate Antonine, being come to Vindomora, he sends us to Vandnara in
Scotland, merely for some very small consonancy in the names: though truly he
confesses upon less extravagant thoughts, that so we take the wrong way:
Pancirolus upon the Notitia would have Vindobala to be the (...) Ptolem.
same with Vindogladia in Antonine, placed Westward in the Island far away,
whereas this is per lineam Valli in the North, or else, which is as bad, he
tells us that some read it Vindolana, which indeed follows after in this very
Notitia, and is a distinct Mansion, where the Tribune of the IV. Cohort of the
Gauls resided. Now what should be said of them both, but what I remember
Ortelius says of one in a like case? Non toto tantum coelo, sed and terra
quoque errarunt. The next Station is Vinnovia.

VINNOVIAM. M. P. XIX.]
It is not easily to be said, whether the ignorance of Monks, Bishopwrick of
Durham.
and other such Librarii, or Transcribers; or the heedlessenesse of the
Composers for the Print, has caused more foul faults, and errors, in old
Writers. Of the oscitancy of both, this work in our hands, if any other, will
give sufficient evidence. And particularly the name of this Mansion; which
Simler's Copy had written Viconia. Surita's written Books, had Vinovia and
Vinnovia; as it should be. Lhuyd, or his Printer, for Vinnovium in Ptolemy,
published Bimonium, and Binionium: from whence Alex. Nevill a deal worse
Bynionum. Camden, Binovia; and our Speed, Benovium. The Schoolboys know, that
V. consonant, (...). and (...). are sororiae literae, and of a near sound^:
and what to Ptolemy is (...), is to other Writers (...), Albion and (...), is
(...), otherwise spelt. What then in Ptolemy is (...), Antonine expresses
Vinnovia. As for the difference in Gender, we are to note, that the Ancients
pleased themselves in dealing licentiously therein, yea, and in number two: so,
Luguvallum and Luguballia; Tyana, Tyanae, for (...), for Lugdunum; Megara,
Megarae, for (...). And here we have mutuum muti. For as the right reading,
which had been corrupted into Viconia, is restored and asserted to Antonine by
Ptolemie: so from Antonine is the right posture of the Station recovered in
Ptolemy, who makes it to be (...), a City of the Brigantes. For in him, says
Camden, it is so should out of its place, that it had always lain obscure,
and undiscovered, except the other had pointed it out. By this direction then
it seems Humfrey Lhuyd first found it in the Bishop wrick of Durham (a part of
the Brigantes) upon the brow of a Hill, which over-looks the Were, not far from
Bishops-Auckland, which stands on the other side of it; and now, from the old
name of it, is called Binchester; In comparison of its former celebrity, at
this time it scarce deserves the name of a petty Village: yet great store of
rubbish of the old Buildings, and some remainder of the Walls yet to be seen.
So true is that of Mercury, to old Charon in Lucian: Lucian. Dialogo (...).
(...). I tell thee, Ferrimam, that Cities dye as well as men. And what
appears of it at this day, being but what is left of a City, plus quam
mortuae, as Camden says, it was most freindly done of him, to gather, as it
used to be done in the Adi sit Desc. Heraldum Adversar. lib. 1. cap. 7.
Ossilegia of the Ancients after the funeral fire, the scattered bones, as it
were, and relics of its former glory. Of his rescuing therefore from
Oblivion, and not falling into the same grave, which has quite overwhelmed the
City it self, are these Inscriptions Arguments of its out-worne splendour, and
magnificence. DEABUS

This first was reared up by Claudius Qnintianus, Consul under Maximimis the
Emperor, about the year CCXXXVI. according to Cassidorus, upon performance of
his Vow made to the Mother-Goddesses. But in the Fasti Consulares, more
commonly received, and esteemed; with L. Catilins Severus, you have the name of
L. Ringorius Urinatius inscribed before that year. And I cannot say that all
these names belonged to one man.

Besides this Stone, and another, the fairest and greatest Altar that has been
dug up in Britain, found out at Coccium, or Rible-chester, in Lancashire,
there is none else extant, among the Volumes of Inscriptions gathered through
the whole World, that mentions these Goddesses, so far as I remember, says
learned Camden. But since his time, this age, so curious after the inquiry of
the defaced steps of Antiquity, we meet Apud Gra^. and S^ittium.
with diverse. This other stone was set up by M. Ingenuus Asiaticus, a Decurio
of a wing of the Astures, a people of Spain residing here in the Roman service,
and dedicated DEIS MATRIBUS, somewhat differently; of which I can only observe
this, That the more ancient used abus, in Ablatives and Datives plural, rather
then is: not only to distinguish the female sex; but in other words also
signifying no sex at all: as, portabus, ol abus, etc. in Salust, and others,
affecters of archaismes, and taken notice of for it by the ancient Grammarians,
to whom, if you please, you may have recourse. Joseph Scaliger indeed upon
Varro quite contrary makes Dijs, pro Deabus, and equis pro equabus, an
archaism. See also in COCCIUM in the X. Journey.

Industrious Camden tells us, that with all his searching he could not find
out, what these Deae Matres were. However he cites a place out of Plut. in vita
Marcelli.
Plutarch very much for their antiquity, which would not be omitted here: There
is, says he, a City in Cicilie called Engyium: it is no great thing, but a
very ancient City of name, by reason of the traffic thither, for that there
are certain Goddesses to be seen, whom they worship, called the * Mothers. Some
say the Cretans were the first Builders and founders of the (...), apud
Pansaniam in Atti^is, idem sonare possunt.
Temple there, where you shall see Spears and Helmets of Copper, and upon them
are graven the name of Meriones: (He means the associate of Idomeneus, the
King of Creet in Homer. Camden, and his Translator also, has Metio; but
amiss: I believe by the Printers fault:) and upon others Ulysses name also,
which are consecrated to these Goddesses. Varro also has made mention of some
such Deities, as I find by a place of his urged by August. de C D. lib. 7. cap.
3.
Augustine: Dijs quibusdam patribus, and Deabus Matribus, sicut hominibus,
ignobilitatem contigisse. If it were worth my while to conjecture, and without
the offense of the severe ones, I should easily guess them to be the three
famous Goddesses, highly worshipped by the Romans; yet deduced from ancient
original among the Grecians; Vesta, Matuta, and Tellus: among whose
indigitamenta, or several names and appellations, you shall frequently find
Matter or Mother. And therefore it is likely that they may be (...) at least;
that is, worshipped upon the same Altar, and in some respects the very same
Goddesses. For Vesta, Cic. Orat. 30. Arusp. Respons.

She is of that antiquity, that the Homer. in Hymnis.
God of Poets makes her the Daughter of Saturn, the Father of the Gods. As for
Matuta, besides T. Live. lib. 5. 24, 25.
Livies testimony, which were enough to prove her called Mother, I might add
out of Verrius Flaccus, that her name is to be derived no way better, then from
Matter. Matuta, says he, potius a Matre, quae est originis Graecae. He means
(...), or as the Dorics pronounced it (...). And for Tellus Matter, it were
putid to heap Testimonies for it hither. Who knows not Homers (...), or his
(...); The Mother of Gods, or Earth, Mother of all; or that Vesta and Matter
Tellus were the same Deity; as Plutarch, Ovid, and others say. Now having
thought thus much long ago, merely by way of conjecture; and making farther
enquiry, whether Stata Matter, whom I found mentioned by Festus Pompeius, and
whose Image he says was worshipped in Foro, were not the same Deity with Matter
Deum, or Matter Tellus (as most probably it is) I luckily, after some good space
of time, resuming into my hand the so much admired Syntagmata de diis Syriis,
of M. Seldom, that incomparable M. Seldom I say (who was to borrow Ennius his
words, Multarum veterum Legum, Divumque Hominumque
Prudens --
There many ancient Laws of Gods and men
Well understood --


If any one man ever were: I found out of Apul. Metam. lib. 8.
Apuleius, that Deum Matter, called also Tellus Matter, was the same with
Astarte, or Dea Syria: and withal satisfaction sufficient for any man,
concerning these Deae Matres from so learned a Pen, that to what I have blotted
the paper with, thou may, favorable Reader, use thy spongia deletilis, if by
chance thou so please.

But let us hear himself, who in all doubts is our Apollo Aperta: Seldom. de
Diis Syris Syntagm. 2. cap. 2.
In Britain also, says he, there is an inscription, now shattered indeeed,
dedicated to the DEA SURIA, or Syrian Goddess by Licinius a Commander under
Autoninus the Philosopher, extant at this day in Sir Thomas Cottons Gardens at
Conuington in Huntingtonshire. I am not ignorant that the Mother of the Gods
was called also Terra by the Ancients: So Lucretius in his second Book
explaines the matter: And there is no body but knows that Heaven and Earth were
wont to be confounded by the worshipers of Idols. Seeing therefore Astarte or
the Syrian Goddess, was the same who at first was the Mother of the Gods, but
afterward called by many names; from hence perhaps may conjecture be made, who
those Mother Goddesses were mentioned in old Altars, never taken notice of
until this age. For as many names as there were, so many Goddesses were there
accounted to be; so many Mothers. Then instancing in those two places, brought
before out of Plutarch and Pausanias, and taking notice how this age,
inquisitive after the remainders of Antiquity; has found out in Europe many
Altars so inscribed, as also others to the Junones, all to be seen in Gruter
and Smetius; and mentioning these two already spoken of at Riblechester, and
here at Pinnovia, or Binchester, he brings us a third taken up likewise in
Britain, and communicated unto him long since by M. Camden. DEABUS MATRIBUS.
TRAMAI VEX CERMA, etc. It is to be seen at Louther in Cumberland. What TRAMAI
means, says he, I dare not once to guess: But now if Astartae were the Deum
Matter, it does needs follow that the Astarte were the Deae Matres; for so were
they called in the Plural number, Astartae: even as there were many Junos,
many Venus's, many Syrian Goddesses, by the reason of the multitude of their
Images. So also there were many (...); which perhaps they meant, who observing
as well the Asiatick, as their own Country Rites, did dedicate Altars to the
Mother Goddesses; at least it is very likely so. S. Austin indeed has said
almost as much in this that follows: Augustine. ad Iudic. II. quest. 16.
Juno without doubt is called by them (the Paeni) Astarte: And b^ those
Dial^cts (the Punic, and Phaenic^an) do not much differ, the Scriptu^e is not
amiss believed to speak this of the people of Israel, that they served Baal
and Astartibus, quia Jovi and Junonibus. N^ther ought it to m^ve you, that he
said not Astarti, that is (...): but as if there were many Juno's, he put this
nam^ in the Plu^ll number: For be would have the understanding referred to the
^tuide of their Images, because every Image of Juno was call^ Juno, and hereby
he would have so many Juno's understood as ^r were Images of her. So far the
all knowing Seldom. But of this more then too much. For the wise men of the age
will laugh broad at these nice and fruitless enquiries, and I am loath to
offend: Things, things! say they; not words, (...).

The other Inscription taken up at Binchester is this; but thus by time
shattered and broken, Tantum aevi longinqua valet mutare vetustas:
So much does time alter the state of things.
TRIB. COHOR. I.

The name of the Tribune of the first Cohort of the Cartovii, who erected this,
is quite lost: And so might well the name of the people be too, except we had
better information and intelligence concerning them, out of Geography or
History. The Dedication was made to Mars the C^nqueror; every one knows him:
next to him to the Genius or Tutelar Spirit of the Place, of whom a word.

may better read gignendarum; as I see S. Austin did of old; or else genendarum

excellent Scholar Peter Pithon, in his P. Pith^ Advers. lib. (...). cap. 2.
Adversaria, concerning the interpretation of this place. The Image of the
Genius was sometime exhibed by a Boys visage; most commonly by a Serpent; and
that for some mystery, not here to be discoursed of. When any City was
besieged, the enemies that lay against it, used to call forth the Gods or Genii
thereof; which if it were to be taken, straightway issued forth: of which see
Macr. Sat. lib. 3. cap. 9.
Macrobius out of others. In short, they that worshipped according to Pagan
superstition, thought that as men had souls given them, when they were born,
so Nations and Cities had their Genii bestowed on them when built. And thus
thought Symmachus a Heathen, and a man of great esteem with the Emperors of
his time: Q. Symma. in Relat. ad AAA. pro res^aur. Gentil. deorum culin.
Suus cuique mos, suus cuique ritus est, varios custodes Urbibus cunctis men's
divina distribuit, ut animae nascentibus, ita populis fatales Genii dividuntur.
Et obsessis Hierosolymis audita vox est, numen urbis alio migrare, id est,
Genium. But this opinion of his is stoutly impugned by Prudentius a Christian
Poet, whose brave Verses I cannot but set down, and then I will beg pardon for
my being troublesome. Romans dico viros, quos mentem credimus Urbis,
Non Genium, cujus frustra simulatur imago.
Quanquam cur Genium Romae mihi fingitis unum?
Quam portis, domibus, thermis, stabulis soleatis
Adsignare suos Genios, perque omnia membra
Uibis, perque locos Geniorum millia multa
Fingere, ne propria vacet angulus ullus ab umbra.
That Rome a Genius has we do maintain,
Nor stands its Statue there set up in vain.
Why do you think her Walls one Genius has?
When every Portall, Stable, House and Bath,
Their Guardians have; Her Alleys, Streets, and Rodes,
Deities boast, and many thousand Gods.
No Nook nor Hole, wants a peculiar soul.


Next to the Genius of the place, Bonus eventus, or happy success, is here
invocated by the Tribune: For the Ancients worshipped this Deity (so infinite
was their (...)) among others which were not Gods, but the fond conceits of
their own distempered brains, and less beneficial and useful then Stocks and
Stones, Gods the works of men's hands. However they worshipped them, which Varro
witnesses, Varro de R. R. lib. 1. cap. 1.
Nec non etiam precor Bonum Eventum; quoniam sine successu and Bono eventu
frustratio est, non cultura. The Image of it Plin. lib. 38. cap. 8.
Pliny has set down: Simulacrum Boni eventus dextra pateram, sinistra spicam
and papaver tenens. Neither do the Coins describe it otherwise; in that of
Titus it has in the right hand a Charger or broad piece, in the left it holds
some Popy only, with Bonus Eventus Augusti. In that of Severus it stands
robed, with corn in the Charger; Popy and an ear of corn in the left,
according to Pliny. Whether it were the same with Fatum Bonum in a like
inscription found at OLENACUM, or Elenborough in Cumberland, I will leave to
the Reader to bethink him, till I shall have occasion to speak of it
elsewhere. If in the mean while I have been somewhat tedious to you, this
saying will in some part excuse me: Lactan. lib. (...). cap. ult.
Primus sapientiae gradus est, falsa intelligere.

I have said nothing at all of the distance of the places, for it was not
needful; only this I may not omit, that there is a world of Roman Coin taken
up in this place, which the neighboring people of the Country call BINCHESTER
PENNIES.

CATARACTONIUM. M. P. XXII.]
So the best Copies. The Neapolitan had Catorastorium. Others Cataractone, and
Cartoni, abbreviatum pro Cataractonio, says Talbot. Besides Antonine, Ptolemie
also mentions it in the second Book of his Geography, among the Cities of the
Brigantes, calling it (...), Catarractonium; and elsewhere in the same Work;
Ptolem. Geograph. lib. 8.
(...). Cataractonium maximum diem habet horarum XVIII. and distat ab

Degrees. But whether this place may not receive light and correction, from that
we brought before out of his Geography, as has been formerly hinted by our
learned Antiquaries let them look to it whom it more concerns. The place it
self I would have transcribed hither for the Readers better satisfaction, but
the Book at this time is not in my hands.

The next time you find it, is not till Venerable Beda, in whom it is called

one place he tells us that Wilpapes-dun was near ten miles distant from it,
the site of which place if we did now know, we should have little cause to
doubt of Cataractonium: Remisit ergo [Rex Oswinus] exercitum. quem
congregaverat, ac singulos do^um redire praecepit a loco, qui vocatur
Wilfares-Dun, id est, Mons Wilfari; and est a vico Conteractone december ferme
milia passuum contra solstitialem occasum secretus. In the other place it is
expressed by a Periphrase; The Village by the Cataract or Waterfall: His words
are these, where he tells, Paulinus flying out of these parts, was by King
Edbald welcomed into Kent with the Bishopric of Rochester: Ibid. lib. 2. cap.
20.
Reliquerat autem in Ecclesia sua Eboraci Jacobum Diaconum, virum utique
Ecclesiasticum and Sanctum, qui multo ex hinc tempore in Ecclesia manens,
magnas antiquo hosti praedas docendo and baptizando eripuit. Cujus nomine vicus
in quo maxim solebat habitare juxta Cataractam usque hodie cognominatur. I
would I understood this place better, but however our great Antiquary tells us,
the place has its name from a Cataract, i. e. a Waterfall; and that (letting
us know first that by this Station, as we shall see anon, Catarick upon the
Swale is meant) there is such a one somewhat higher in the River toward
Richmond; which does there, to use his own words, rather ruere then fluere,
rush down violently, then run. Which if so, the reading methinks [(...)] might
have been righter in Ptolemie; none knowing better then he, what the meaning of
the word was.

In Matthew of Westminster it is named Civitas Cataracta; where he says it was
burned by Beornred the Tyrant-King of the Mercians, who afterward perished in
the same manner by a just talio, Anno gratiae, DCCLXIX. Cataracta civitas igne
cremata est a Beornredo tyranno rege Merciorum deposito. Sed ipse infelix eodem
anno, justo dei judicio, incendio periit. But it revived again out of its
embers, as I could show; but that it is my maine undertaking to illustrate,
especially, the Roman times.

It has been the study and trouble of learned Men, foreign and domestic, in the
last Age, as well as this of ours, so busy in new enquiries, to design and
set out the place where anciently it stood; but the greater part are quite wide
of it. Paulus Jovius makes it to be Allerton, not much wide I confess in this:
but how far his fashion is otherwise to be out in the ancient Chorography of
this Nation, makes me think of the witty, though sharp, censure of the Author
of Amadis de Caul, which I am sure I met with when I was a Boy, concerning his
other Writings; though the World took his Romances, as indeed they are, to be
but the fictions of his own brain, yet he doubted not but with after Ages they
would find as much credit, as his Histories of his own Times. Michael
Villanovanus thinks it was Carlisle; which, whether he had from Jos. Moletius,
who has so set it down to his Ptolemie, I know not. Yet every one knows that
Carlisle was Antonines Luguvallum, or Luguballia. But the vanity, not to say
imposture, of Hector Boethius the Scottish Historian (and he has his followers)
is notorious and shameless, who with I know not what Helktique Instruments
(unknown I believe, to Vitruvius or our late famous Architect Inigo Jones) have
removed Cataractonium out of Yorkshire, many scores of miles Northward, as far
as the Baillery of Corict in Scotland: Carictonium (for by that he means this
very place, or else just nothing) opidum in Caricta, vulgo Carik regione, cujus
pauca vestigia restant: olim Scotorum regia fuit; and he tells us moreover,
that it was called Caractorium, because Caractacus [gaza, and thesaurus] wealth
and treasure was kept there; who indeed never came nearer it then the
Brigantes; Tacit. Annal. 12. and Hist. lib. 3.
when being treacherously used by Cartismandua their Queen, on whose protection
he had thrown himself after a long resistance of the Roman power, to gain
favor and defense for her shameless Adultery, was by her more shamefully
delivered up to them. Polyd. Hist. Aug. lib. 1.
Polydor Virgil, Boethius his Scholar, with more show of truth, as one who had
read Tacitus with more diligence, brings it rather from Caricta the Region, in
which, say they, sometime it stood. There are who would tolerate this device of
Boethius in a Poet, but in an Historian (and thought no mean one abroad) who
can excuse it; except you mean by an Historian one utterly unskild in
Geography? But wonder not at him. Solens facile; for he has with the same
slight brought Camalodunum, the famous Colony sometime at Maldon in Essex, as
far as the Banks of Carron in Galloway, where likewise it is Pictorum Regia,
and has its quaedam vestegia too. So has he drawn the Ordovices out of Wales,
and placed them in his own Country, where the old Annals for sooth call them
Ordaci. But I have only this to say of him, Had not his Countryman Tho.
Dempster a Murisk written the Scottish History after him, he had been the
lyingest Historian that I knew of in the World. Vide frequentes de Dempstero

He outgoes him, and is indeed (...). Raph Hollinshed conceited it to be
Darlington. I have not ought to say to Cryton, or Cryton-bridge noted to
Cataractonium in Antonine by the Learned Fulke: But to the same Station in
Ptolemie he had set down Catarick-bridge. Very right; for so thought Talbot
before him; and after him the learned Camden. The name it self says as much,
and its Site upon the Military way, which here leads over the River, where it
divides it self. If the distance from Binchester hither, seem not to agree
with the number here, then think that the Italian miles used in Antonine, are a
great deal shorter then the Northern with their Wey-bits; and that they took
the Street way then, not the shortest cut they might, as we do at this day.

Of this difference in ways, observed by the Romans, I could give diverse
instances: and hence it is, that Julian. Caes. Or^. 6. (...).
Julian the Emperor opposes (...), or compendious ways, to public Roads,
raised and laid with Causies by the labor of the Soldiers.

I might add for the great antiquity of this place, which Camden does observe,
what a world of Rubbish is to be seen every where about in the Country near:
Besides more Eastward hard by the River, a mighty Mount, and four Bulwarks,
raised as it were with exceeding great labor, up to a great height: But now it
is viculus pertenuis, a very poor Country Village; and as famous as it was of
old times, we may at this day seek it in its ruins, and scarce, or not at all,
find it. I have done with it therefore, and will shut up all in the words of
the Psalmist, Come, says he, behold the works of the Lord; what desolations he
has made in the Earth. Thus much shall be said Psalm. 46. 8.
of Cataractonium.

ISURIUM. M. P. XXIV.]
The distance between Catarick and Aldburgh (which is put for Isurium) will
well agree with the number XXIV. here between that, and Cataractonium, if you
do but remember and observe, what I said e're now concerning the distances of
old times, and those at this day; Taking notice also of the course they then
took in their journeying; which quite through this Itinerary is to be heeded. In
the 11. Journey, this Station is called Isuria: and in the fifth Isubrigantum,
that is, Isurium Brigantum: for Ptolemie also makes (...) to be one of the
Cities of the Brigantes. They say Guil Harrison Descrip. Brit. lib. 1. cap. 11.
it had its name from the Confluence of the Isis, and the Urus; a little above
which it stood, not far from Burrowbridge, a place very famous of later ages:

says Leland, a little from the Highway. The Saxons called them, both met
together, by one name the Ouse, or Uyan.

That the old Britains had knowledge of Isis, not only as acquainted with the
Romans worshipping her, but otherwise also by their bearing arms for them in
Egypt, where she was most adored, is to be made good by clear record: The
Notitia of the Provinces of the East. Sub dispositione viri Spectabilis ducis
Thebaidos Ala quarta Briconum Isui. In the Itinerary it is Isiu. Both places
are to be mended Isij out of Plutarch; in whom, as also in Hesiod. Aethiop.

reason, which tells us Jo (that is Isis) the Daughter of the river Inachus, was
by Jupiter turned into a Cow; and so conveyed into Egypt, where, it should
seem, she and Apis were horned Deities.

But truly I must tell you, I had rather have met with one ancient authority
out of Ptolemie or some other of old time, whereby I might be assured these
rivers were so called sometimes by the Romans, then all that either Leland or
Camden have wittily said: for Leland seems to me, one who had rather devise
handsome names himself for any place, then diligently tread the very and
certain steps of Antiquity.

The Town out of its ruins is, as I said, called Aldburgh; the name
signifying, The old Borough, or Town. On the very ground, where Isurium
sometime stood, you may at this time see, either cornfields, or pasture: Virg.
Aen. lib. 3.
Et campos ubi Troja suit. L. Flor. de gest. Romans lib. 1. cap. 12.
Laborat annalium fides, ut Veios fuisse credamus; says the elegant Historian,
concerning the old Veii. And our Antiquary says, that such Writers, as mention
Isurium, would have much ado to make us believe it had once a being here, were
it not for the proportionable distance from York, here set down; and the great
store of Roman coin found daily hereabout.

EBORACUM LEGIO SEXTA VICTRIX. M. P. XVII.]
The distance here from Aldburgh to York is various, according to the variety
of Copies, and the several journeys in which we meet with it. In the first
journey you have seventeen miles, in some books sixteen; in the second,
eighteen, and in this fourteen, according to Surita; but in his diverse
readings, he takes notice of seventeen also: which Aldus, Simlerus, and
Harrison admit; and this will make the general number in the foot of the
reckoning, to agree with the particulars, as is before observed. Neither will
the distance at this day unhandsomely sure; if you conceive, as you must, that
the ancient site is somewhat altered.

The first mention you meet with of this place, is this in Antonine, except you
make Ptolomie antienter, as indeed he should be, if it be true that he wrote in
Antoninus Pius days, as the common Chronology gives it out. Truly, as it is
already observed, the time when this Itinerarie was published, though commonly
it bears Antoninus Pius name, is not certain: neither is it likely it was
extant till under Severus: For Britain indeed, being by Julius Agricola, the
Pro-Pretor under Domitian, Tacitus in vita.

above one half thereof, and that not very useful, or beneficial to them, and
in Antoninus Pius time the (d) Brigantes, of whom Eboracum was a principal
city, revolting from them; things, me thinks, could not be at this pass, as
(q) Pausanias. in Arcadicit.
they are represented in this Itinerary, till Severus time: especially if you
consider the stirs and turmoiles at home for the Empire, immediately before his
arrival here: the Britains from thence taking ground for their defection.

But omitting here a more exact enquiry after the just time when either of them
wrote; we are to take notice, that the VI. Legion that had the Title of Victrix
from it is conquests, brought over out of Germany, says Camden (and yet for all
Severus coin, which follows, he dare not assure it, by reason of this former
mention of it, as he says, in Ptolemie) by Severus, had it is residence at
Eboracum. It is plain in Antonine, as well as Ptolemie too. But in Ptolemie
then you must recover him from a violent luxation, (which he suffers in some
common Io. Noviomag. Coloniae An. 1540. and aliis.
Editions, where (...) Camalodunum, which should come after, is interposed,
between (...), and (...), Legio VI. Vict. which number also Z. as Surita

using a right Copy, of Ptolem^, as it appears he did, I wonder how he could
make any question here about it.

There are many such in Ptolemie: as where (...) is turned out of it is place;
and (...), or London made a City of the Cantii, and others. But far worse are
they out, who from abused Copies, would have that (...). as the all learned
Seldom has taken notice; to belong to Camalodunum, next to Eboracum (of which
see more in CAMBODUNUM in the II. Journey:) and it to be the De qua Tacitus
Annal. 14.
Colony placed by Clandius the Emperor so long before in Essex, and so far away
short of Eboracum: contrary to the evident testimony of a Coin of Severus in
the averse of which we read:

COL. EBORACUM. LEG. VI. VICTRIX.
Of nine Cities of the Brigantes, named by Ptolemie in the second of his
Geography, Eboracum is reckoned the eighth in order of naming: But there they
are placed according to their situations, not dignity. He mentions it likewise
again in the eighth Book of this same Work, in these words. (...). i e.
Eboracum maximum diem habet horarum: XVII. cum dodrante, and distat ab

you shall find it somewhat differently written. (...), Euoracum; whence
perhaps the Saxons speld it, Euo^pic, adding their own pic, or vicus, of which

great Construction published in Greek at Basil, it is named (...), Brigantium;
as you would say, The chief City of the Brigantes, says our learned Antiquary:
but withal he suspects the Copy to be corrupted. And not without some cause:
For, as we are taught by the most admired Primat of Armagh, that word is quite
wanting in the Greek MS. of the Library at Lambeth, (as in a Latin Copy
likewise in New College at Oxford, there is no word answering (...).) for
which notwithstanding there is to be found in the printed Latin Translation of
the same Work out of the old Arabic, Bericanas. For which in the MS. of
All-Soules College in Oxford you may find Bencanas. You shall have the whole
pericope, as it is in the Translation of Ptolemie from the Arabic; and just as
it was written in the copy I speak of, transcribed thence for me by the
singular courtesy of my excellently learned friend, Dr. Gerard Langbaine, the
worthy Provost of Queens College, then whom I know no man alive, who
furthereth Learning and good Letters more, either at home, or abroad; or with
the like pains: yet take first Ptolemies own Greek; and that after, Ptolemie,
Lib. 11. Cap. 6. (...), etc. The Latin out of Arabic in the MS. thus, Et
linea equidistans, 22. est, in qua longitudo Vide CATARRACTONIUM ex Ptol. page
diei longioris est 17. bore, and quarta here: Et ejus elongatio ab equatione
diei 55. parts; descripta super Bencanas terre Britannie majoris, etc.
Bericanas, or Bencanus here, are words that signify Mirmantum, i. e. Eboracum.

Yet for this we may give you some satisfaction in what follows; I mean,
discover the mistake: But for (...), I fear how well I may do it, (against more
then the single authority of the Lambeth Gr. MS.) except you will read
Brigantum urbs.
(...), and so take it for York as the chief City of them; which yet I like
not: for then would there remain some vestigium of that word (...) rendered into
Arabic, had it been ever in the Greek. What I hoped for from my Arabic
friends, that by chance in this flourishing age of those studies, and books,
they might light upon a Copy of Ptolemie in that Language, I now utterly
despair of. Or if perchance this might happen, yet I fear the genuine reading
in the Greek, may but very obscurely be restored, in proper Names, which the
most Joan Seldom. (...), Comm. in Eutychii Origine^, number. 16. p. 124.
learned has sufficienly taught us. Neque est, says he, quisquam literis
hijce [Arabicis] non prorsus alienus, qui nesciat etiam notissima nomina in
idiotism^s Orientales deformata, obscura nimis solere reddi. Etiam and nomina
ipsa Aegyptiaca, Africana, and alia, quae originis non sunt Latinae aut
Graecae, quamplurimum a nominibus Graecis ac Latinis in usu, saepius desidere.
It were to be wished, that Dr. Bainbridge, the learned Professor of Astronomy
in Oxford, (whom I have heard from his chair seriously commending a new
Edition of Ptolemie to the free Beneficence of some great Prince:) when he
collated the Gr. printed Text, with the Lambeth MS. and exactly noted the
various lections, in which the want of this (...) is taken notice of by him,
had also given us a note of his conjecture upon this place. For, I cannot see,
to speak truly, how (...), or some such word, can at all be missing here, that
signify just nothing. And yet, perhaps, as much as that we find in the Gloss
upon an old MS. in Biblioth. Praestantis. D. Armachani.
Ninnius; in that place, I mean, where it is added: Cair segint, i. e.
Eboracum. Mirmantum, i. e. Eboracum.

There are besides these, certain other appellations, or expressions rather, as
indeed they are, of this most famous place; which perhaps you would not I
should omit. Ninnius, the antientest Historiagrapher of the Britans, as who

U^dwick, says Leland, more contractedly indeed, and also more corruptly. For
Leland says, Ortelius stiffly maintains, that York is called Uroricum, a
Graecis and Latinis scriptoribus. For the Greek, truly I have little to say; as
much as nothing, who I believe, scarce knew what Vicus was. For the Latin, he
was good at it; hear him therefore, I pray, what he says himself in these
writings of his, which now I have under my hand, Joan. Leland in Geneth.

shall Fboracum be its Rome. But what shall we say then of France? Must that be

to suit with Eboracum. Later ages, after the very declination of the Empire, by
changing the termination of the name, as next before Isuri, Isurium, a thing
indeed very usual, and therefore scarce worth observing, expressed it Eboraca,
as Gregory the Gregor. M. lib. 12. epist. 15.
Great, or first Pope so named in his Epistles to the sanguinary Monk,
Augustine of Canterbury. And from hence, I believe, says our Giraldus
Cambrensis, Ciral. Cambrens. Dialog. de Menevens. Ecclesia, distinct. 2.
Eboraca, quae nunc Eboracum dicitur, XII. Suffraganeos (...), etc. And in his
Words, not far before these; you have; Previn^ia quarta Maxima, id est,
Eboraca, ab Imperatore Maximio dicta: as if Maximiano forte, vel Maximo, sed
potius a quantitate quod esset maxima.
Maxima Caesariensis (so he means) one of the five portions, or Provinces into
which Britain was divided by the Romans, containing all, they say, from Tine to
Humber; were otherwise named EBORACA; which yet seems not to me. To have
done; we find in a very ancient and credible Writer, Sextus Aurelius Victor,
who has succinctly written the lives of the Emperors, that Eboracum, which is
known by all, to have been a Colony, was a Municipium too, or Free Town, which
two have no coincidencie, or suteablenesse. It is in Severus life, where he
speaks of his death, which all agree was at York; Neque multo post Britannia
Municipio, cui Eboraci nomen, annis regni duo deviginti morbo extinctus est. A
Municipium was, as Agel. Noct. Aetic. lib. 16. cap. 13.
Agellius, one of the ancients, teaches us, where the inhabitants lived, as so
Rome, making use of their own Laws and Constitutions, capable only of
Honorarie Title in the State of Rome, and thence called, Municipes, otherwise
bound to no duties by any Law of the people of Rome. It differed from a Colony,
says all-knowing Seldom. in eximti poetae Poly. Cant. 16.
Seldom most of all, in that a Colonie was a Progeny of the City, and this of
such as were received into State-favour, and friendship by the Romans. But of a
Municipium more fully, as in its more proper place: see VERULAMIUM, or, Caer
Municip. by which name St. Albans was anciently known to the Britains. And yet
here too, let me tell you, that it was of old a thing frequent enough, that
Colonies were changed into Municipia, and contrary. Camden out of A. Gel^ius,
instanced in the Case of Praeuestint. And we may add the Puteoli very
anciently Vell. Patereul. Hist. Romans lib. 1. cap. 15.
a Colony, which not withstanding, in Ciceroes days, was a Municipium, as
appears out of his Oration; for M. Coelius. Afterward it was made a Colonie
again by Augustus, Frontin. lib. de Coloniis.
as Frontinus witnesses. Though Tacitus relates that they obtained the
privilege and name of a Colony from Tacit. Annal. lib. 14.
Nero. But that Eboracum was ever such a Colonie, or turned into a Municipium,
it is not this place of Aurelius Victor; nor these precedent places alleged,
can induce me to be persuaded. Camden truly our learned Antiquary tells us;
that this difference of names in the History of the Emperors, is not altogether
so exactly observed, but that one and the same place may be found indifferently
called both a Municipium. and a Colony; which if so, I judge it rather the
Historians oscitancie, and supine negligence, then so in the very nature of the
thing. But to expedite and clear the whole business: We are to know, that
there were two sorts of Colonies; one civil, drawn out from among the gowned
Citizens, as well as the miscellane sort of people. The other Military, taken
out of Legions, and cohorts, when they were past service, and settled in towns,
or elsewhere, for a reward of their blood spent for the Commonwealth. The
former of these became many times Municipia or free Buroughs, but the later
not so; it being thought derogatory, that such as had born arms, should admit
of an inferior, and less glorious condition. Much less when a whole Legion
had, by the Emperors beneficence and large indulgence, sat down any where; as
here at Eboracum. Yet they were called out upon any service, as exigency of
affairs required, and after returned to their quarters again. As this Legion,
after their assisting to raise the Wall, (which not long before his death,
Severus reared from Sea to Sea, to divide the Provinciated part of the Island
from the barbarous:) which we may very well conclude from an old Inscription
dug up there by, LEG. VI. VIC. P. F. F. that is, Pia felix fecit. Concerning
the Wall, there is a place of Aelius Spartianus, an old Writer, in his life:
Post Murum, aut Vallum missum in Britannia, quam ad proximam mansionem rediret,
non solum victor, sed etiam in aeternum pace fundata. He says, that Severus,
after his Wall drawn in manner aforesaid, (the place is no way questionable;)
retired into the next mansion. That this proxima mansio was Luguballa Itin. 11.
Carliel, appears, in that it was at that time, not only the chiefest Mansion,
and so continued quite along to be of a durable fate; but was also indeed, as
near as any other to the Wall, even when in after ages they had placed frequent
stations about it. Now, that the VI. Legion attended him hither to Carliel,
having dispatched the work they had been about, themselves have left a clear
monument, and testimony, a Stone there inscribed thus, with very fair and large
letters: LEG. VI. VIC P. F. G. P. R. F.

That they also departed thence with him to York, where not long after he died,
is a probability, as good as certainty. Great was the trust which Severus
reposed in them; great was the opinion he had of their valor and service in
the affairs of the Island: no less, perhaps, then Julius Coesars of the X.
Legion, Caes. Com. de Bello Gal. lib. 1.
which he brought thither along with him, and had made his Praetorian guard,
because, Et indulserat praecipue, and propter virtutem confidebat maxim, as
himself gives testimony of them in his own writings: but if you will hear him
speak in Dio, In Orat. ad legatos and Prefect. apud Dion. Hist. Romans lib. 38.
he makes his boasts of them, that if there were occasion, they would venture
naked through the fire for his sake.

This gallant Sixth Legion remained an Age or two, if not more, at York. This
Inscription, as Camden has transcribed it, witnessing its residence there,
seems not to me to be of the earliest antiquity; that is, very suddenly after
the Legions coming thither: M. VEREC. DIOGENES Quatuor vir
I 1111 I VIR COL. EBOR. Ibid. mortuus.
IDEMQ. MORT. Civis.
CIVES BITURIX. HAEC SIBI VIVUS FECIT.

The faults of the Quadrator, or Stone-cutter, being mended, as you see, the
meaning thereof is easily to be understood, and the state of the Colony learnt;
which, as all others, was a lesser model of the great City it self. Therefore,
as at Rome they had their Quatuorviri Barn. Brisson. Antiquit. lib. 4. cap. 12,
for repairing their Highways; so also at York, till the declining of the
Empire, the same Office was kept up here: he that waited upon it at this time,
with his other three partners, was M. Verecundus Diogenes, a native of Berry in
Guascoign; who, by wisely providing himself a Monument in his lifetime, has
had the good hap, to outlive the memory of his fellows.

Some fourscore years after the death of Severus, we meet with this Legion
again in its own room in Britain, mentioned by Dion. Cassius the Consular
Historian in his recension of the Legions of his time, showing what alteration
had happened unto them since the age of Augustus. These his words: Dion Cass.

which argues the fullness and great reputation of it of old. As for the

Richard White our Countreyman, and sometimes Professor of the Civil Law in

De ^fficio Praefecti Praetorii vocat. And hence perhaps we have the Original
of our Regiments at this day: As Colonel from Colonia: Shall we therefore (and
so set back the time, according to vulgar count, wherein Ptolemy wrote his
Geography, where is mention of this Legion in Britain: for there is no exact
proof that he published it under Antoninus Pius; though I forbear to define any
thing peremptorily, till learned men have agreed, whether the same Ptolemy who
is Author of the Almagest, and who indeed wrote I'^i constas ex eo Opere.
it then, be also of the Geography; which I see for good reasons questioned:)
Shall we, I say, then, to constitute this double President-ship, ordained by
Severus, place one of them at York with the VI. Legion Victrix in Lower
Britain; and the other in the Higher Britain (as Dio Hist. Rom lib 55.
Dio also directly says) at Vide Devam secundo Itinere.
DEVA, or Chester, with the XX. Legio Victrix? Perhaps not amiss. But how long
this bipartite, or joint power, continued, or whether it were not straitway
dissolved by the arrival of Severus himself (it being not usual among them to
dispose the main charge of their affairs in the Provinces into more hands than
ones:) it will be worth our considering. After Clodius Albinus his revolt, and
defeat, we meet not with any Propraetor, or Legate of Severus in Britain, save
Virius Lupus, whom he appointed to that undertaking about the time that moving
against Albinus, he took his eldest son Aurel. Antoninus to share in command,
and Empire with him. This we learn from an old Apud Camden. in Brigantibus.

Ulpian, the famous Civil Lawyer names him Praeses, or President of Britain. Of
any other I am quite ignorant. For whereas the learned Camden names with him
Heraclianus (he is diversely written Heraclius and Heraclitus:) I am sorry to
say he was very much deceived therein to make him a Legate in Britain, being
led indeed thereto by a corrupted Copy of Ael. Spartian. in vita Severi.
Spartianus where he read, Severus Heraclitum ad obtinendam Britanniam misit.
For Britaniam, you must by all means read Bithyniam: Casaubon offered very fair
at this emendation, but Salmasius ventured upon it in good time. Neither can it
be otherwise, will you say, if you heedfully read the same Author in Severus
life, as also in the life of Pescennius Niger; in the first of which you have
this, which confirms it: Bithyniam vero occupare non potuit Heraclius,
Byzantium jam tenente Nigro. Besides Heraclius was sent to Bithynia before
Severus had yet vanquished Niger, or thought of Albinus, who was Caesar, and
governed Britain at this time; no suspicion yet appearing between them.

Near upon CC years after the Consulship of the same Dion Cassius, if you will
admit of Poetical Authority, and theirs that interpret Poets, you shall find
this Sixth Legion departing out of Britain to serve Fl. Stilicho in his War
against Alarichus King of the Goths. It is the flourishing and neat Poet
Claudian who says so much, if his Expositor, one learned enough, Antonio Del
Rio, be not too far out in his conjecture. The Poet of the two may best be
excused, in whom you read: Claudian. l. de bello Getico. Idem de Nupt. Pallad.
and Celerina: quae Saxona frenat, vel Scotum legio. Nam mali in antiq. Par.

Cruiques censure of him: Ignobiliori materia depressus, quod deerat de
materia, addidit de ingenio. Which is true here. For this Legion is found in
Britain afterward, some good many years; if that be true, which Alciat,
Pancirolus, Camden, and others say, that the Notitia of both Empires was set
out by Theodosius the younger, as most probable. For that War against the
Goths was about the year CCCCIII. in the Consulships of Theodosius Junior Aug.
and Fl. Rumoridus, before Theodosius was sole Emperor. The mention thereof you
have thus in the Notitia of the West: Sub dispositione Viri spectabilis Ducis

to these last words [Praefectus Legionis Sextae] blunders fowly, and dreams of
some yet unknown place, called Sexta, setting it down so; and of a Legion that
had lost it is name. But at length he falls right upon the Legio VI. which, that
it constantly resided at Eboracum, or York, somewhat above CCC years, I suppose
is very sufficiently demonstrated, and made good. And now to tell you after all
this, that, about the time of the Norman Conquest, this so ancient and
magnificent a (...) Historiae Eadmeri Monachi Cantuariensis ejusdem seculi.
City, and seat of the Roman Greatness in the Province, was called Civitas
Fborunt, will be as perhaps needless after the tediousness, so fruitless and
long a discourse has moved, so quite besides my institutum and purpose, who
would sain confine my self in this whole business within the limit of those
ages wherein the Romans bore sway among us, and not lower. And yet there
remaining still, within the limits of that time which I have prescribed to
myself, some goodly memories of the glory and splendor of this so ancient a
City, and to this day flourishing (which argues the strong and sound
constitution thereof;) quite untoucht some of them, others very slightly
handled by such as have undertaken to set forth our affairs of old time, and to
adorn them; I shall here gather and sum up to what is said what else I have met
with, and conceive conducing to the luster of the place; and that in the behalf
of the Favorers and Admirers thereof; among whom I willingly profess my self
for very good reasons, though not in this place to be mentioned, or thought of.

It makes not the least for the fame and glory of it, that Septimius Severus
the Emperor of Rome, and Master of the World; one deservedly equalled with the
greatest Martialists of any age, not only had his Palace and residence for so
many years, Palatium Ael. Spartian.
but also here breathed his last. His Actions here, and manner of his death, we
shall leave to History, and a greater Work. His dying speeches are memorable,
and full of brave spirit. One in Dio Hist. Romans lib. 76.
Dio argues his earnestness and dispatch of business: (...). Lets see, my
Masters, what else have we to do? His last words related in Spartianus, contain
excellent and wise counsel to his Sons: Vide Dionem.
Firmum imperium Antoninis meis relinquo, si boni eritis, imbecillum, si mali.
Together with an exact survey of what he had done; so well becoming a man of so
great performance: Turbatam Rempublicam ubique accepi; pacatam etiam Britannis
relinquo. Neither may that in the same Author be omitted, which shows a
gallant despiciency in him of all human affairs, how great and glorious soever
they were which himself conceived thus in Greek: I have been all; yet never the
better for it.

Concerning the place where the Bustum was, our learned Antiquary tells us out
of Radulfus Niger, a writer of ours some ages ago, that by Ackham, not far off,
west from the City, is a place called Sivers, from Severus; and that it was
there, a huge heap of earth, yet to be seen, as he says, is a token to prove
it so. And truly that does not differ which you find in my Lord of Armaghs
Chronology, joined to his Primordia of the Britain Churches. Corpus ejus rogo
est impositum, in loco qui ad hunc usque diem. Severs hill, sive Severi collis
nomen retinet. Such kind of Monuments called tumuli, or cumuli, were with no
small cost and pains, raised by the Romans to the memory of their dead,
especially if they were of better note. We learn this expressly from Seneca
consola^. ad Polybium cap. 37. v. illie Just. Lipsium.
Seneca: Caetera quae per constructionem lapidu^, and marmoreas moles, and
terrenos tumulos, in magnam eductos alti^udinem constant, non propagabunt
longum diem: quippe and ipsa intereunt. The former times have wondered at so
great heaps, caussa parum gnara, says a learned man, to be met withal every
where almost, and yet were they ignorant, for what cause they were so cast up.
In several places with us they are to be showed. I have seen a very notable one
as you go to the Bath, in the Plains beyond Malborough. Barbarous Nations seem
to have imitated the Romans herein, as they did the more ancient Greeks, among
whom Camden in Belgis.

And these had it from the antienter Cen. 25 20
Jews. But return we to Severus.

Among diverse presages, or bodements of his death, taken notice of by the
Historian Spartianus, this one may not go unremembred here, because from thence
we are informed that Bellona, the famous Goddess of War, Sister or Wife to
Mars, had a Temple then at York. His words are: Et in civitatem veniens,
quumrem divinam vellet facere, primum ad Bellonae Templum ductus est errore
aruspicis rustici, deinde hostiae furvae sunt applicitae. Quod cum esset
aspernatus, atque ad Palatium se reciperet, negligentia ministrorum nigrae
hostiae usque ad limen domus Palatinae Imperatorem sequulae sunt. It were to be
wished that those two learned men, or at least one of them, whose lucubrations
are extant upon Is. Casaubonus. Cl. Salmasius.
these lesser Writers of the Augustian History (authors not every where so
perspicious, and plain) had not passed over this place so in silence: then
perhaps they had removed some difficulties therein, and cleared them, which
have occasioned great suspense to the ordinary reader, such I mean as my self
is. As first, (for I am not skilled in the Ammian. Histor. lib. 17. vide Illic

days. How much their knowledge was, in what they professed, appears by a
relation of Dio Hist. Romans lib. 42.

Minulius Felix. Bellona servum suum haustu ^ruoris humans imbuit. As also that
of Ael. Languidius in Commodo: Bellona servientes vere exsecare brachium
pracepit, studio crudelitatis. By which it appears sometimes they forbore this
cruelty. These Hieroduli, or sacred Servitors of hers, called otherwise
Bellonarii, were no where more famous, or frequent, than at Comana in
Cappadocia, in the valleys of Antitaurus, where, as an Author as old as Caesar's
time writes, Hirtius sive quis alius auctor lib. De Bell. Alexandrino.
was a most ancient, and most venerable Temple of the Goddess; and so much
reverenced, that her chiefest Priest by the consent of the whole Nation, was
accounted next to the King in Majesty, command and power: It was called also by
the Cities name Comana, according to Strabo: who says he found there, men and
women, not less then DCM. who all professed themselves to be (...), or divinely
inspired by Bellona. Strabo says not here indeed, that any of them were
dispersed about the Country, or so much as that in their mad frantic fits
they rambled and raved out up and down their dreary predictions. Yet we must
conceive it so: For that was most frequent and usual with them in their assumed
distempers. Testimony enough there is of that: take one, or two, which come
next to hand. The Heathen Poets: -- Iuvenal. satyra 4.

After whom it is not to be thought that eloquent Christian Lactantius can belly
them: Lactant. lib. 1 cap. 21.

alieno, sed suo cruore sacrificant. Sectis namque humeris, and utraque manu

esseruntur, insaniunt. But Tertullian is plain that the Bellonarii of Carthage
(and sure they had all every where the same tricks and fegaries) had their
place of recourse, or rendezvous, when they acted their seeming ecstasies, which
he calls Bellona montes; and not far from the City as it is very likely.
Tertullinn. lib. de Pallio.
Cum ob diversam affectionem tenebricae vestis, and cetrici supra caput

name and credit in learning, as any whoever of the last or former ages, which
notwithstanding about this place, and diverse others as often as they can lay
hold of occasion, sometimes in their own, sometime under forged names, they
have wounded, worse then ever the Bellonarii did themselves. They are Dionysius
Petavius, and Claudius Salmasius. The laters reading of it matters not here.
Petavius defends the former in these words D. Petav. Notis ad Orat. ^v. Iuliani
Caesaris.
Erant haud procul Carthagine, quantum suspicari licet, montes ita nominati;
forte quod Bellonae, ac Bellonariis sacrati, in quibus insanis illis
cursitationibus operabantur. And backs it with the like place, wherein, says
he, there is mention of one of those mountains, out of the Habentur post Acta
Collationis Carthaginae habitae inter Catholicos and Donatistas.
Acts of the Purgation of Caecilian and Felix, at Carthage: Victor respondit;
Fugeram hanc tempestatem: and si mentior peream. Cum incursum pateremur
repentinae persecutionis, sugimus in montem Bellonae. In a word, (for I
perceive by this time the Reader is weary of me, as well as of these mad
fellows:) as they were not unlike to the old Galli Sacerdotes of Cybele, or the
Mother of the Gods; so do they much resemble our Toms of Bedlam; or among the
Turks their Torlacchi, as they are described by the best writers: whose respect
was such with all sorts, that one of them being admitted near the person of
Bajazet II. he had almost slain him, but the blow failing his aim fell on his
horse, and wounded it: for which the whole gang was suppressed for a time, but
since have raised their head as much as ever. Marinus Barlerius in the life of
Scanderbeg, mistakes the Deroises, by far a more civil sect, for these ruffling
Franticks, and Assassins.

And now, if after all this, there be any Reader, that entertains not
satisfaction concerning this Aruspex rusticus; let him then please himself, and
follow his own fancy, by thinking, that this Temple of Bellona at York served
for the same purpose as that at Rome did, namely to denounce war against the
Enemies from a Pillar standing before it, which is reported by Sextus Pompeius:
Sex. Pomp. Festus de Verb. significat. ubi and Scaligerum consule.
Bellona dicebatur dea bellorum ante cujus templum erat colum^lla, quae bellica
vocabatur, supra quam hastam jaciebant, cum bellum indicebatur. Although, that
in Rome was put also to other uses; as for Ambassadors, from foreign Nations,
whom they would not admit farther into the City, here they gave them hearing;
likewise here they entertained their Generals returned from service abroad. And
that Sylla here held a Senate, we learn from Seneca, whose words deserve
transcribing: Seneca De Clementia lib. 1.
Cum Sylla in vicino ad aedem Bellonae sedens exaudisset conclamationem tot
millium sub gladio gementium, exterrito Senatu; Hoc agamus, inquit; seditiosi
pauculi jussu meo occiduntur. And then I must request such Readers to teach me,
what is meant by a Country Wizards lighting upon the Emperor, being in a
humor to sacrifice, as he entered into the City; how he came to lead him to
Bellona's Temple, and what he was to do there; wherein did appear this Wizards
Error, or mistake, and lastly in what of all this consisted the presage of
Severus death? If any one of them can give me content in all these, they shall
find me a man who never will be unwilling to confess per quae profecerim; which
every good man of duty is bound unto as he is ingenuo^s.

But if perhaps I was right, in what I thought before, then will I interpret
that [errore] in the Historian, by fanatica excursiones, with Petavius: for
what else does it mean? And gratify the favorable and candid, with a corrected
reading of the whole Pericope, or passage in him, thusz: ductus est errore
aruspicis rustici. Deinde hostiae furvae sunt applicitae: Quod cum esset
aspernatus. etc. putting a period, or full point after rustici. where was only
a Comma. That which follows [Deinde hostiae] by any means beginning a new
Presage. For what had Bellona to do with black Sacrifices, or indeed with any
color else? her Priests always sacrificing, as you have been taught in what
goes before; non alieno, sed suo cruore? A new, as I said, and another distinct
Presage it is, exhibiting black sacrifices, which ever were accounted unhappy,
except offered to infernal Deities, and such as they were proper to: which the
very boys of the Chapel know. Where this Temple of Bellona was sited at York,
perhaps is utterly unknown at this day. That in Vrbis regione XI. versus Portam

Rome where it stood, though I could tell you, yet it is nothing to our
purpose. We will not therefore have any more to say to either of them.

Herod. hist. lib. 3.
Herodian in his History writes, that Severus presently after his arrival here;
himself with his eldest son Antoninus going forth to find out the Enemy, left
his youngest son Geta in that part of the Island which was obedient to the
Romans (he must needs mean YORK:) to administer civil affairs; appointing him
for counsel and Guides the gravest of his Friends. More then three years after,
he and his son Antoninus sat also at York about common business, and gave
their judgment in ordinary cases, as in that of Caecilia about recovery of
right of possession. Their Rescript, or Law, thereabout is still preserved in
the CODE, to the great glory and renown of this City, and dated as you see from
thence, with the names of the Consuls of that year: neither can I forbear to
publish it here, as the gallantest monument of Antiquity which it has.

That is,

It seems just that a man may have right of Lordship and propriety in a foreign
slave (possessed (bona fide) as of his own proper goods,) and also of his
services. So that if thou had possession of the said Servant; and he, with
thy money, in the time of his servitude, purchased any estate, thou may be
relieved by the Law. But he that possesses a strange servant unlawfully, can
have no remedy, but shall be forced not only to restore him, but also his
services, and all the increase both of the women and cattle.

What the learned Io. Seldom Analect. Angl. Brit. lib. 1. cap. 7.
Cujacius of Great Britain has noted to this Law, I had rather you should have
from his own hand, than mine. This was the very year, wherein Severus built his
Wall, which Spartianus calls maximum ejus imperii decus, The greatest renown,
and ornament of his Empire: for which, he also says, he was surnamed Vnde
etiam Britannici nomen recepit. Spartian.
BRITANNICUS; and not so only, but Barthol. Marlian. Vrb. Romans Topograph. lib.
4. cap. 5. Alex. Donatus Roma V^. lib. 2. cap. 15.
MAXIMUS BRITANNICUS too, as some old Stones do yet witness. Of this Wall I
have said something already: to the next journey I have much more to say.

But in my judgment the greatest ornament, not only of Eboracum, but of Great
Britain also in those times, was Aemilius Paullus Papinianus. Step. Forcatulus
de Gallorum Philosoph. and Imperio l. 6.
Forcatulus, a French Antiquary, and not indiligent, affirms that the
Praetorium, or Tribunal at York, was very happy in that it heard Papinian, the
Oracle of Right and Law. So Camden out of him: for his own book is not now at
hand. What special Authority therefore Forcatulus had for this, I cannot
sufficiently tell. But confidently I believe, that here he was, and one of
those grave Friends of Severus, whom Herodian told even now, he joined to his
son Geta, for assistance in Civil matters. That Forcatulus was in the right
herein, that also does prove, that Severus on his death Bed left Papinian a
kind of Guardian to both his Sons. Now it is not to be thought, that so wise a
Prince would bequeath them to the care of an absent Tutor, who could not
receive instructions and directions what to do from his own mouth. But Dio
Cass. Hist. Romans l. 76.
Dio puts all out of doubt, where he relates an undutiful and unnatural attempt
of Antoninus upon his Fathers life: It is fit I set it down, as he tells it.
Antoninus riding along with his Father, the Army also following, in sight of
the Enemy checked his horse backward, and saying nothing, with a slight, drew
his sword, aiming at his Fathers back: they seeing, that were in company,
suddenly cried out; at which Antoninus affrighted, held his hand. Severus,
turning about at the cry, saw his Sword. But making no words of it, from thence
he repaired to the Tribunal; where dispatching some necessary business, he
retired to his Pavillion. Then calling for his Son, Papinian, and (...) Dio

first, because he had formerly made the like attempt: next, that he durst assay
so heinous a fact, his friends, as well as Enemies, looking on. Lastly, says
he, if thou desire to have me slain: here do it, for thou art of strength to
do it; I being both old and a decrepit man, do besides ly here fair for thee.
But if thou refusest it, or art afraid of it; here is Papinian (...) Dioni.
consta^. prafectorem pratorio gessisse. Victor de (...).
the Praefectus Praetorio, whom thou may command to s^e it done. For being
Emperor, he will not disobey you. You may read the rest in Dio. There is
another relation in S. Aurelius Victor de Caesaribus (him that Andreas Schottus
published; not the Epitome of the Caesar's, formerly set forth under the same
name) which because it is different from others, take here; yet for which
without doubt he had his Authors, as himself tells: Victor in Severo.
Quae victoria (he means the the Assassination upon the person of Geta, by his
brother:) Papiniani exitio soedior facta, ut sane putant memoriae curiosi:
quippe quem ferunt illo tempore Antonini.
Bassiani scrinia curavisse, moni^umque, uti mos est, destinando Romam quam
celerrime compon^ret, dolor Getae dixisse: HAVDQUAQUAM PARI FACILITATE VELARI
PARRICIDIUM, QUAFIERET. Idcirco morte affectum. By which words they out of whom
Victor took them, seem to have believed, that not only the murder committed
upon Geta, (it is likely, by this, at York:) but that brave saying also uttered
by Papinian, were both before their return to Rome. Those words show it
[destinanda Romam] says learned I^. Casaubon, and maintains that reading good.
And yet the same Victor writes out of others, confestim s^cessere; they
departed hence straitwaies. There is such a passage also in Spartianus life of
Geta, which says as much as Victor does in effect, that Geta was slain after
his Fathers death, before their return to Rome: [Geta prius rebus humanis
exemplus est, quam cum sratre tenerti imperium.] Yet their Father left them
joint Partners of the Empire, as we see by the History of his death: Spart. in
Severo Filios duos, Successores reliquit. Eutrop. Hist To. lib. 8.
Antoninis meis sirmum imperium relinquo, etc. Neither seem those disorders,
which the same Writer says hindered Antoninus departure out of the Island, to
proceed from any thing more than Geta's murder. Denique nisi querelis de Geta
editis, and animis militum delinitis enormib. etiam stipendiis datis, Romam
Bussianus redire non potuit. Which makes the same learned man judge, that
Spartianus was not the Author of both the Brothers Lives; the contrary being
related in Antoninus life out of Herodian and Dio as it is to be guessed. This
observe, that not Victor only, but those other Writers also of the Augustean
Story, huddle together what ever they meet with in former Authors, though never
so contrary one to another; never endeavoring reconciliation; which will
appear in other business, besides this. Victor then, and Spartianus, had the
same Authors, though but obscure ones. Whereas Salmasius endeavors to compose
the difference between the Writers of these two Brothers lives, telling us,
that of the two Sons of Severus, one was made Emperor by his Father, the other
Oeta saluted so by the Army, and that Geta was judged as an enemy, me thinks he
says nothing: For how can I think that he who more then once assayed to
deprive his own Father of life (I say nothing of his Brother, it is so well
known) and that too in the presence of his victorious Army, could spare his
Brother but for an hour, especially having brought the Army so much to his
side, that they published Geta, both his, and the States Enemy. However
Herodian, says Salmasius, a writer of those very times, and Dio Cassius twice
Consul of Rome, both Grecians, say Geta was killed at Rome in the Palace, and
almost in the bosom of his Mother. Were it not for other and more weighty
circumstances in the whole narration, considering withal Antoninus his violent
temper, I could easily be inclined to favor this suspicion of Geta and
Papinianus being put to death at York. For there also was a Palatium, or domus
Palatina: and their mother Iulia was there in Britain at the same time. Out of
Herodian. Hist. lib. 3. fin.
Herodian this is not obscurely to be gathered, but Dio Hist. lib. 76.
Dio witnesses it with a pretty passage, which he tells happened between her,
and a high spirited British Lady, the wife of Argencecoxus. But here we will
omit farther disquisition, though it be not impertinent at all to this place.

The fame, and known wisdom of Papinian, wherever dead, procured so high
Elogies to his Name, that nothing can be conceived above them. Zosim. Hist lib.
1.
Zosimus says he was a most just man, and one that excelled all Roman Lawyers
both before his time, and ever since, as well in the right interpretation, as
knowledge of the Laws. But Spartian. in Caracalla.
Spartian calls him the Asylum, or Sanctuary of Right, and the very Magazine of
Law-learning Now concerning the cause of his death, and the manner thereof,
Authors do somewhat differ. Zos. uti su. pra.
Zosimus tells us, that when he was Captain of the Guard, (if at least we do
well in rendering Praefectus Praetorio in those words) he was held in great
suspicion by Antoninus, for no other cause, but for that he, observing him to
bear a deadly disaffection toward his Brother Geta, did what he could to hinder
his designs, and preserve Geta. Therefore that Antoninus to remove this block
out of his way, by the Soldiers plotted Papinians death; and so having gained
opportunity slew also his Brother. Spartian writes he was beheaded with an Ax
in Antoninus sight, because he would not excuse Geta's death: by which
relation, his murder should seem to precede Papinians; contrary to what
Zosimus delivers. Dio lib. 77.
Dio tells us that Antoninus was much offended with the Soldier who put
Papinian to death with the Ax, being ordered to do it with the Sword. In old
time Malesactors were beheaded with the Ax; afterward with the Sword. This
punishment seemed the lighter, and more honorable. Hear Boethius: Papintanum
diu inter Aulicos patentem militum gladiis Antoninus objecit, He exposed
Papinian to the Swords of the Soldiers.

For SEVERUS times, thus much of EBORACUM. Which whether it became polluted
with the blood of this brave and innocent man, and a great part of that Sacred
JUSTICE which yet remained upon earth in his days; or else Rome, has not now,
as you see, been first of all brought in question. But for us, let Rome, as it
had rather, take all the glory thereof to it self; and for joy it quits us of
such bloody deeds, I leave those infected times, if first you will give me
leave a little to parodize: Ex Ovidio M^am. lib. 10.
Gratulor extremo, nostro jam gratulor orbi;
Gratulor hinc terrae, quod abest regionibus illis,
Quae tantum fecere nefas --
I joy for you Ismarians; for this Clime;
This World of ours; so distant from that Earth,
That gave to such a cursed Monster birth.

in ancient memories made of EBORACUM; only as I showed, in this mean while the

I will refer you to a work, and place, more proper for them. Only till then
take what follows out of the Panegyrist concerning his expedition into Britain:
Dies me ante deficiet quave oration; si omnia patris tui facta vel hac brevitate

Gests, the day would sooner come to an end than my oration. (They make Eumenius
an Orator of Augustodium or Flavia in France, to speak this to Constantine the
Great, the Son of this Constantius, of whom here we treat) Cujus and jam

certum est) expetivit, sed, Diisjam vocantibus, ad intimum terrarum limen
a^cessit: neque enim ille tot tantisque rebus gef^is, non dico Caledonum,
aliorumque Pictorum silvas and paludes, sed nec Hiberniam proximam, nec Thulen

videret illic diem poene continuum. Vere enim profecto illi Superum Templa
patuerunt, receptusque est consessu Caelitum, Jove ipso dexteram porrigente.
That is, And now whose last expedition was not to the British Tropaea's (as it
goes current commonly) but by the call of the Gods he came to the innermost
Port of the Countries; for he, having performed so many Acts, neither deigned
(I do not say the Chaledonian and ^icton Woods and Moors, but not) so much as
to attempt Ireland that lay next, nor Thule the furthest, nor those (if there
be any such) fortunate Islands; But (which he would tell no body) being on his
journey to the Gods, saw that Father of the Gods Oceanus recruiting the fiery
Stars of heaven, as being about to enjoy continual light; and now he observed
that it was almost perpetually day there. For indeed to him did the Temples of
the Gods truly ly open, and he was received by the consent of all the heavenly
inhabitants, Jupiter himself giving him his right hand. In this place, and
elsewhere too, surely he speaks of the Apothesis of Constantius celebrated in
Britain; which the coyns also do witness, says our diligent and learned
Antiquary. Whether that which follows be any of the fashion he had, I cannot
certainly affirm. It was dug up lately within a mile of Kingstone upon
Thames, at the end of Comblane in a gravel-pit. The U^ in which it was,
contianed more of his, as also of Dioclesian, the Maximiani, Constantinus
Caesar, who afterward was called the Great, Maximinus, etc. It seems by this,
that on Comb-Downes, or Hill, was a Camp, or station of Roman Soldiers; and of

to a farther search; being one (public fame reports it:) that does nothing

Country.

Rome in the height of its greatness had not a more glorious and gallant show
to exhibit, then what this poor piece of Copper would express. But before I
mention Constantius his Deification, I should have acquainted you with the
place of his death which was Eboracum. Not only Hieronym. in Chronico. Europ.
Hist. Romans lib. 10.
St. Hieron, but Eutropius also, an Heathen Roman Historian, affirms it:
Obiit in Britannia E^oraci, principatus anno tertio decimo, atque inter di^os
relatus est. If therefore he dyed at York, most certainly there also was his
body solemnly burnt. And if so; how comes it to pass, that so many ages after
we find his body again in Wales, and so far remote too? The good Monk of
Westminister is Author for it, where he Chronicles matters of Edward 1. times:

But the credulous Monk was abused: as we should be also, if we gave credit to
one far antienter then he, Nin^ius the old British Historian, who relates that
this man's Grandchild, Constantius the Son of Constantinus, had his Sepulcher
near Caernarvan; as says he, letters inscribed upon his Tombstone there do
witness: When as we know, by unquestionable circumstance; as well as authority,

That which our learned Antiquary says, he was told by very credible men of
this City, carries greater show of probability; That when in the age before
this, the Religious houses there were dissolved and ruined in a kind of grot,
or vault, where constant fame reported the Relics of Constantius were laid, a
burning Lamp was found. And withal he adds, that the Ancients used to preserve
in the Sepulchers, especially of greater persons, by artificial dissolving of
Gold into a fatty substance; fire still continuing for many ages: And for this
he brings the testimony of Wolfagius Lazius. Div^s other writers might have
been consulted about this custom; I will only name two for the Readers
satisfaction; Bernardus Scardeonius, a diligent Italian Antiquary, and
Fortunius Licetus, an excellent Philosopher of Padua. The death of Constantius
happened about the year CCCVI when as at York also his eldest Son Constantinus
of British extraction by Helen his first Wife, much opposing and gainsaying
it, had the Imperial Robe put upon him by the Army, which at length he could
not but accept of. He that especially urged him to it was Vict orin. in Epi^om.

to pass from earth to heaven, he saw whom he left his heir; for presently upon
his being taken from the Earth, the whole Army pitched upon thee, the eyes and
hearts of all designed thee for the place: and although thou repairedst to the
Senior Princes for the ordering (as they pleased) the chief dignity of the
Commonwealth; yet they came prae-resolved, by study, of what they soon acted in
the Counsel. Presently when thy first going out made plenty, the Soldiers,
serving the Commonwealth more than thy fancy, cast the purple upon thee,
whilst weeping: nor was it meet that a consecrated Prince should be any longer
bewailed. And they say also, O unconquered Emperor, that thou did spur thy
horse to have avoided the importunity of the Army, when they moved for thee,
which (to tell you truly) was done but weakly, and as a youth. For what
Cyllarus or Arion could deprive him whom the Empire followed? That, I say that,
Majesty which is subject to the nod of Jove was not committed to Iris the
Messenger of the Gods, but first to Victoria, so easily did she accompany thee,
as soon as things sent from Heaven come to Earth. So did the endeavor of
avoiding that dignity show, and the felicity of the Commonwealth overcome thy
modesty. O Fortunate, and now of all Nations most happy Britain, who first

by his Father, and the British Army; yet not Britain but Gallia saw him first

(...) proves at large. Somewhat before, he makes his addresses to him in these
Words: Sacrum istud Palatium, non candidatus Imperii, sed designatus intrasti;
confestimque te illi paterni Lares successorem videre legitimum. Neque enim
erat dubium quin ei competeret haereditas, quem primum Imperatori filium fata
tribuissent. Te enim tantum ille, and Imperator in terris, and in coelo Deus,
in primo aetatis suae flore generavit, toto adhuc corpore vigens, illa
praeditus alacritate ac fortitudine, quam bell^ plurima, praecipue campi
Vindonis idonei testes declararunt. Inde est quod tanta ex illo in te formae
similitudo transivit, ut signate Natura vultibus tuis impressa videatur. Thou
entredst that sacred Palace not dignified with, but designed to the Empire:
And thy Fathers Lares presently saw thee to be his right and lawful Successor.
Nor was it any doubt but the Inheritance should belong to him whose fortune it
was to be first Son to the Emperor. For he, that Emperor, on earth, and God in
the heavens, begot thee in the very flower of his youth, whilst his whole body
was vividand strong, endued with alacrity and fortitude, which many wars,
especially that of the Vindonian Camp, have fitly testified. Hence it is that
thou retainest so perfect a similitude of him, that thy original is even
plainly stamped in thy face.

It has been the strange fate of two Roman Emperors, the one as bad as the
very worst, (I except not Nero:) the other to be ranked with the best, That
their birth-places are exceeding questionable; not yet quite cleared by the
diligent enquiry and search into ancient Memories by learned men. They are
Caius Caligula, and this Constantine, called the Great. Of the former see

Yet before I have done, let me acquaint you, that such Strangers, as from best
and most remote authority (for what are a brace of your Graeculi (...),

Constantines birth to be from Britain, make also the time thereof to be about
the latter end of Aurelian's Empire. The whole number of the years of
Constantines life, assigned by the Writers of that age, must needs make this
good. And the British History is so far to be mended, as that it become
suitable to this Account. I would commend but two especially to you hereabout;

Province: And it is not to be thought that Aurelian, who restored every where
the limits of the Empire, East and West too; (For he was Restitutor Galiiarum,
says Vopiscus: Atque pacatis Galliis undique terris terrorem injecit; like
another Alexander the Great, or Julius Caesar, says In Epitome Caesarum.
Victorinus:) it is not to be thought, I say, he would neglect so considerable
a Province, as Britain was. But that also he sent aides at the same time
hither, witness the Mauri Aureliani; so called from him, says Guide. Paucirol.
Comment. ad Notitiam Occidentis cap. 89.
Paucirolus lying far beyond York at Appleby in Westmerland.

But that his birth was at York, directly and not any place elsewhere, though
we have no express proof that I know of, I mean among the Ancients; yet that
authority seems to be drawn from them, which the Ambassadors of England made
use of; and that in the hearing of the learned World then, both at the Council
of Constance, in the year MCCCCXIIII. as also that at Basil MCCCCXXXI. At the
Council of Constance, there being a Contest about precedence between the French
and English Ambassadors, the English has these words: Domus regalis Angliae
sanctam Helenam, cum suo filio Constantino Magno Imperatore nato in urbe regia,
Eboracensi, educere comperta est. The Royal house of England, it is known for
certain, brought forth Helena, with her Son Constantine the Great, Emperor,
born in the Royal City Eboracum. The English at Basil opposing the precedence
of Castile, say thus: Constantinum illum magnum (qui primus Imperator
Christianus (so are their words) licentiam dedit per universum orbem Ecclesias
constituere; immensa ad hoc conferens bona*) Peternnae natum in Eboracensi
civitate. That Constantine (who being the first Christian Emperor, gave leave
to build Churches through the world:) was born at Peterne in the City York. By
this they mean Bedern a College of Vicars there, sometime serving the Quire;
which, as also Christ-Church (called in ancient Charters, Ecclesia Sanctae
Trinitatis in Curia Regis:) is varily thought to have been part of the Imperial
Palace in old time.

After all this, the ingenuous Reader, and not captious, may easily yield way
to the formerly alleged weighty testimonies (in the Panegyricks spoken to
himself) for Constantines being born here; and among them give room likewise to
these two: The first is, Panegyric. cujus Pr. Dixerint licet.
Liberavit ille Britannias servitute: tu etiam nobiles illic oriendo fecisti.
(i. e.) He freed the Britains from servitude, and thou have enobled them by thy
birth amongst them: Which our men do as well apply, by Petavius leave, to his
birth here, as he does to his first being made Emperor in Britain. The other
this: Panegyr. cujus Pr. ^acerem.
Dii boni, quid hoc est, quod semper ex aliquo supremo fine mundi nova Deum
numina universo orbi colenda descendunt? Sic Mercurius a Nilo, cujus fluminis
origo nescitur, sic Liber ab Indis prope consciis solis orient^s, deos se
gentibus ostendere praesentes. Sacratiora sunt profecto mediterraneis loca
vicina coelo, and inde proprius a Diis mittitur Imperator, ubi terra finitur.
(i. e.) Good gods, how comes it to pass, that always new Deities do come from
some utmost part of the World to be worshipped by all? So Mercurius from Nilus,
the head of which River is unknown; So Bacchus came from India a place near
neigbouring with the rising Sun, and showed themselves to be Gods whilst
conversant with the Nations. Certainly those places being nearer the heavens
are more sacred than our inland Countries, and from thence, it being the Lands
end, and so nearer the Gods, our Emperor was sent unto us.

And now, when I shall have spoken a few words concerning the Ecclesiastical
glory of Eboracum, as I have already many, tending to the Civil and Military
renown thereof, I will have quite done with it. That it was adorned with an
Episcopal Seat by Constantius, whom we formerly mentioned, our learned
Antiquary tells us ex patriis scriptoribus, as himself gives in his witnesses:
quorum nullum adhuc mihi vid^ contigit, says my Lord of Ar^agh. But how then
could Anonym. qui de Archiep. Ebor. scripsit Anno 1460.
Faganus (the Companion of Duvianus:) sent hither by PP. Eleutherus to King
Lucius, to plant Christian Religion, be the first Archbishop thereof, which yet
is related? Or how then could King Lucius place here one Harris. Descrip. Bri^.
lib. 1. cap. 7.
Theodosius; which yet William Harrison affirms? or lastly, how could Sampson
under the same King be Bishop of York, as, it appears by Godwin, some have
written? The first beginnings of all things are full of obscurity, and
uncertainty. In all these Narrations there is no (...), nothing to persuade a
credit of any of them. For that of the last, Godwin himself holds it suspected,
because at the first entertainment of Christianity among us, nor Hebrew, nor
Greek names of the New Testament were so rise among the Britains. Again, this
Sampson is more generally reserved to some ages after till King Arthurs time.
As for the testimony concerning Theodosius, and the other, is so (...), without
Author or Abettor of sufficient age, that it will be cast forth and rejected.
Besides, though we by no means reject the story of King Lucius, and know, that
here the Romans did permit, and had, reges, instrumenta servitutis, as Tacit.
in vita Agricolae.
Tacitus speaks, Kings in Britain, as instruments to keep the people slaves,
and themselves no better; as Cogidunus, Venutius, Prosutagus, etc. Yet, though
Lucius were such a one, (for we want sufficient authority for it) we may not
reasonably think, that either his Territories, or jurisdiction was so large, as
in the presence of the Romans he might constitute Bishops, and Episcopal Seas;
especially at York, the Imperial City then of Britain. And therefore there are,
who referring the History of Lucius almost to Severus time, do leave him no
place in Britain, except the more Northern parts beyond Antoninus Pius his
Wall, which he made of Turfe to sever, and shut out the barbarous and unreduced
Britains from the Province: induced perhaps thereto, by the authority of
Tertullian, who indeed wrote under Severus and in whom you have these words:
Tertul. lib. ad versus Iudaeos cap. 7.
Britannorum inaccessa Romany loca Christo subdita. Places in Britain not to
be come at by the Romans yet made subject to Christ. And for Constantius
Chlorus to do any such thing, seems to me very improbable, as who died a
Heathen, as you have heard formerly; albeit it is very certain he favored the
Christians, and suffered no rigor to be used toward them.

We must then seek for the first Bishop of York but not 'till Constantines
days; and we shall find him at Arles in the Counsel there held about the year
CCCXIV. whither as himself writes in his Epistle to Apud. Eusebius. lib. 10. Hist.
Ec. cap. 5.
Chrestus Bishop of Syracuse, he summoned, to hear the Cause of the Donatists,
many Bishops from diverse, almost infinite places. In the last Edition of this
Council published by Jacobus Sirmondus at Page 9.
Paris, among other Subscriptions thereunto, you have these out of Britain.

Not but that they were put to former Editions, but they were such as were set
forth out of corrupted Copies, that nothing could be made of the Subscriptions,
till compared with this by the admired Seldom, whose words I had rather
transcribe for you then translate: for he that cannot understand his Latin,
will make nothing of them in my English: Selde^. ad (...) Origines page 122.

I call this Fborius the first Bishop of Eboracum; who indeed was never heard
of by the nameless writer of the lives of the Bishops of York; Thomas Stubbs in
his Chronicle of them, or Godwin himself who wrote the Catalogue of our British
and English Bishops. This last reckons Taurinus placed here by Constantius, the
father of Constantine. I believe he was deceived by Harrison, or both certainly
by a corrupt Copy of Belluac. Speculi Hist. lib. 10. cap. 76.

Eboracensis, for Euveux. Mediolanum Aulercorum. Eburovicum. Ios. Scaliger

of two good old Chronicling Germans; Wern in ^asciculo Temporum.
Wernerus Roulwinke de Laer, and S^hed. in Chronico.
Hartman Schedel, who no doubt took it from Vincentiu^, who was more then two
ages before them both. But that which deserves to be noted in Schedel, is that
among those, that he writes flourished in Trojans time; Thaurinus Episcopus
Eb^racensis is set down by him.

In the Subscriptions to that Council brought ere while, there are some things
may be observed: As first that York was no Archbishopric in these times, as
neither was Rome it self, whence since notwithstanding we have had all
Dignities, and Titles in the Church. Our Malmesb. de ^estis Pontif. Ang. lib.
1. pr^logo.
Malmesbury confesses, that in the antienter times of the Britans, it was
unknown where the Archbishopric was. At this very Council, as appears by the
Nomenclature, of those that were at it, Sylvester the Pope is but Plain Bishop:
Henricus Spelmanus, V. doctiss. in Archaeologo.
The High title of Archbishop was long time in use in the Eastern Church,
before it came into the West. For whereas our Beda Eccl. Hi. Anglor. lib. 1.
cap. 27.
Beda tells us, that Augustine was ordained Archbishop of the English nation by
Etherius Archbishop of Arles, he follows the manner of speaking in his own
times: for Gregory the Pope then, in his several letters written to them,
affords neither of them that Title; no not when he bestows the Pall upon
Augustine, and gives him precedence and priority in respect of York, and all
the other Bishops of Britain.

In the next place we may take notice, that Eborius Bishop of York, at this
Council takes place of Restitutus Bishop of London, where the Primacy always
remained till translated to Canterbury, as our Writers please to affirm, I know
not upon what grounds. The uncomparable Usher D. Vsseriu^ in Primord. page 97.
interprets the foregoing words of Malmesbury so, as that they did not quite
deny Archbishops among the old Britains, (for he proves they had:) but that all
memories were lost, where the Archiepiscopal, or Patriarchical seat resided.
For although London be at this day, and has been for many ages the chiefest of
Britain, and were near CCC years ago accounted Ammian. Marc. lib. 14.

affirm: but also the Emperors Palace, and Praetorium likewise, Tribunal, or

made mention for above DCC. years ago: and that it has continued till our
age, Manutius and Stephanus (...) do witness. And now I am more inclined, than
I was before, to embrace the learned Casaubons conjecture, that Adminius, the
name of a Britain Prince in Suetonius, is to be mended, and read Arminius.
Forte etiam in nomine Adminius d pro r irrepsit: Nam (g) Is. Casau. in Sueton.

Cherusc. principe.
Tacitum. Names, either common to the Germans, Gauls, and Britains, or not much
differing, would prove a fit study to take up the time of a good Antiquary:
here is no place for such speculation.

As these British Bishops were at the Council of An. Christi CCCXIV.
Arles, so is it more than probable, that they were also at the great Council
of CCCXXV
Nice; which was held not above ten years after, or as others say, not so much;
that they were at the General Synod, (so they called it) at CCCXLVII
Sardica, Athan. Apolog. 11. To. 1. pa. 720. 756. and 767. ult. edit.
Athanasius witnesses, who himself was one of them, speaking of the Bishops who
met together there, says expressly that some were present (...) out of the
Province of the Britains: although in the Title of the Epistle of the Synod it
self to them of Alexandria, Britain be left out among the Provinces there
reckoned up. (...) Restitutus also is named there, but, as many others, without
the place set down whereunto he belonged: yet very likely it was Restitutus
Bishop of London, mentioned before at the Council of Arles. It is probable also
that Eborius Bishop of York, might be there too; though with others he be quite
left out.

And now, says the most learned In Eutychium. page 123.
Seldom, can it seem credible to any man, that Bishops out of Britain should be
present in two Synods, the one not so long before that of Nice, the other not
so long after it: and yet that in this famous one at Nice between them both,
they should have no place: unto which notwithstanding, by the Emperors Edict,
all the Bishops through the Christian World were called. CCCLIIX
Hilarious Bishop of Poictiers in France, not very many years after this
Council, writ a Book in Phrygia, where he was then banished, of the Synods held
against the Arians, which begins thus: Dominis and beatissimis fratribus and
Coepiscopis provinciae Germaniae primae and Germaniae secundae, etc. Et
Provinciarum Britanniarum Episcopis; Hilarious servus Christi in Deo and Domino

Lord, sends greeting, to the Rulers, and our blessed brethren and fellow
Bishops of the Provinces of the first and second Germany, etc. and to the
Bishops of the Province of Britain. The next year after this, the Bishops of
Britain were likewise at the CCCLIX.

Bishops, and odd, were summoned, or, indeed, compelled; to all of whom the
Emperor commanded provision to be apportioned, and Storehouses: which to those
of Aquitain or ^uyan, France and Britain seemed not decent; who, refusing the
Kings stipends, chose rather to live upon their own purses: Only three out of
Britain, for want of maintenance of their own, made use of the public
^llowance; having first refused the contribution the rest offered them:
thinking it fitter to ly upon the public stock, than these private m^n.

How they were provided for at the Council upon the Emperors cost, I cannot
tell: But it seems at home their allowance was not much better than those
IrishBishops, which was no more than three Milch Cowes, and in case any of them
became dry, the Parishoners supplied them again; as their own relation was to
Adam of Br^me in Germany; whom they took in their way from Italy homeward. I
may fit both with that excellent character of those poor Country Bishops of
Italy in Ammianus Marcellinus, an Heathen Historian (...). lib. 27.
Quos tenuitas edendi, potandique p^rcissime, vilitas etiam indumentorum, and
super^ilia humum spectan^a perpetuo Numini verisque ejus cultoribus, ut puros

drinking, the meaness of their apparel, their countenances conversing so much
with the ground, and always looking to God, and his true Worshippers,
commended as pure and meek. Not but that then there were swaggering Bishops,
and far unlike these, as appears also in him.

Thus much, (upon occasion of mentioning EBORIUS Bishop of York, hitherto
unknown to our History) Concerning the ancient Britain Bishops; men of a more
golden, and godly age, then we have known.

But these are dangerous examples to urge for imitation, or practice in our
days. I have therefore instanced in them but sparingly, and scarce let them
speak in English. What have we to do with Bishops? will they say, who I fear
are neither so painful, or so poor; I am sure not so humble.

I will have done because I will not (...). If they therefore, or any other
whatsoever, think this last part, or any else, in this Discourse; which I have
intended to recover the old glory of Eboracum, too tedious; let them read
nothing at all of the whole, and by that means make it the more compendious. I
ever thought with the wiseman: Sen. ad Gallion. fr. de vita. beata cap. 1.
and vulgus non tam Coronam, quam Chlamydatos appello. -- Equitem mihi plaudere

To my applause a Herald do provide.


DERVENTIONE M. P. VII.]
Upon the River Derwent, some seven Miles from York, there is seated a
Village, called at this day Aldby. And in the Itinerary, you have just at that
distance from Eboracum, a Roman Mansion, or rather Station, called Derventio.
That it was placed, where now the village stands, or not far from thence, we
have sufficient assurance. This place a long while after this, continued a
station of Roman Soldiers, with their Commander, who also had their Title, or
Denomination, from it, about the time of the Declination of the Roman glory in
Britain, under Theodosius the younger. This we learn from the Notitia, or
Survey of the Western Empire: Sub dispositione Viri Spectabilis Ducis
Britanniarum, Praefectus Numeri Derventionensis Derventione. Vide BONIVM. Iud.
11.
We have observed out of our Beda in several places, that those Stations, which
were left unruined after the Romans time, became the Palaces and residing
Houses of the former Saxon Kings: As this for one; and Beda tells us this
story. Beda Eccles. Hist. Angl. lib. 2. cap. 9.

Northumberland, with an intent to deprive him of Kingdom, as well as life;
having with him a two-edged weapon Sicam toxicatam.
empoisoned; that if the wound would not speed him, the poison might. He came
to him, says he, juxta amnem Doroventionem, ubi tunc erat Villa Regalis; and
pretending a Message to him, drawing his tool when he saw his time, he made an
attempt upon the Kings person with that violence, that he wounded the King
through the very body of one of his Guard, who stepped between for his safely,
yet without any danger of the Kings life: the faithful Soldier lost his, and
the Mat. Paris an. MD^. Hos tam Saraceni, quam Christiani Assissino^ appellant
^ymologcam nominis penitus ignorantes.
Assassin or Murderer was soon dispatched by the rest of the Guard.

You see here, how Beda names this River Doroventio, which other wise is
Derventio, or Derwent; as he does likewise Canterbury, Dorobernia; which to
Ptolemy, and Antonine, is Darvernum, or Durarvernum. However our Antiquaries
deduce the name so, as that it signifies The White Water. For that Dour-guent,
is as much as aqua alba, the learned Cambro-Britan, Lhuyd. Breviar. Descript.
Britan.
Hum phrey Lhuyd, is sufficient witness: though indeed when he says so, he
speaks not of this, but of another Derwent, which runs by Darby. But there are
stranger readings of it, then this of Beda, and in old Books too: By Ninn. MS.
in Bib. D. Armachani.
Ninnius an old Britain Historian, in a written Copy, it is called Fluvius de
Revent, by a mistake undoubtedly: as you have it likewise printed in an old

Edition of G^ffrey of Monmouth, Galfrid. Monmouth. Hist. Britan. lib. 3. cap.
2.
Deriment: Vor^uerus, says he, pugnabat contra Saxones super fluvium Deriment.
Indeed there were, says he, many Rivers in Britain of the same, and a like
name, which as the only cause, has made In Cambriae est fluvius. cui nomen

learned men, as we shall see, wide the whole Heaven and Earth in search of
this station; never observing the account of Itinerary distance, a thing most
to be observed: though the numbers truly sometimes are very corrupt.

But that it is no where to be found, but here, diverse good reasons meeting
together do more then persuade. First, The almost exact distance, and
constantly so written down in the Itinerary, as it is observed to be at this
day. Next, the station, and Rivers being both of the same Name, a thing not
strange to Ianus Rutgers. Variar. lib. 3. cap. 13.
either Greeks or Romaens: and frequently to be taken notice of in old
Chorographical Descriptions. Then the present name at this day Aldby; which our
Antiquary renders out of the Saxon, Antiqua habitatio, argues that in much
elder times there was here some antienter City, or Station; as you may also see
in Aldborow, next before York, as this is next after, formerly called Isurium:
and many places besides in this work. I might very well add hereto, among
other reasons, such remains of Antiquity, as do yet appear about the place,
which do yet plainly testify the residence of a Praefectus here, and company
of Soldiers, in the Romans time; which the Notitia also mentions: The words of
our learned Antiquary, who also was an eye witness, are these: Ibi nonnulla
vetustat is indicia, and in Editiori ad flumen colle antiqui castri extant
adhuc rudera.

All this put together, serves to disprove the Wild and extravagant dreams of
such, Talbotus, Lhuyd. and qu^ eoram sequaces.
as search for Derventio at Darby, for some small agreement in the first
syllable of the names; when (besides the irreconcilable distance:) according
to the old writing of the English [Deoraby] in Fabius Ethelooerdus, there is no
consonancy at all. Yet this opinion is followed by Talbot, and Lhuyd. Harrison
has set down Tadcaster to Derventio, in both his Editions of Antoninus: and it
seems he followed Leland. No reckoning to be had of such Conjectures. All being
fowly out.

DELGOVITIA M. P. XIII.]
This Mansion has not sped so well as the foregoing Derventio; none of the
Ancients, except here, making any mention of it. No not so much as our good
Beda. Our learned Antiquary therefore has showed very good judgment in
descrying the ground, where-nigh it stood of yore. And though the name be lost
in Beda; yet by the light he borrows out of him, we have a near ken of the
place where some time of old it had its being. Let us therefore first hear
Beda, and by some observations taken from him, I hope we shall find out
Delgovitia. He then tells his story thus briefly: Beda Ecclesiast. Hist. lib.
2. cap. 13.
Eadwin King of Northumberland entering into a serious Deliberation with his
Noblemen, and other his chief Subjects, concerning the entertaining of the
Gospel, preached in these parts by Paulinus, the first Bishop of York among the
Saxons, he that showed himself most for ward to abolish Idolatry, was Coyfi a
chief Priest, and observer thereof, having first gained liberty of the King for
the same purpose. The place where he first executed this his so earnestly
sought for power, to the great astonishment of the vulgar, who thought he had
been mad. Beda thus describes: Ostenditur, autem locus ille quondam idolorum
non long ab Eboraco ad Orientem amnem Doroventionem, and vocatur hodie
Gotmundin Gaham, ubi Pontifex ille; inspirante Deo vero polluit ac destruxit
eas, Locus Virgil. Aen. 2. verse. 501. 502.
quas ipse sacraverat, aras, Observe first from his words, that it was locus
quondam Idolorum; and they may be meant as well of Roman Idols as Saxon. Now
Delgovitia, being rightly deduced, as our learned Antiquary informs us, of the
old British word Delgive, which signifies Deorum Gentilium statu^s, (and I find
elsewhere in their language delio for an image or Statue:) we may well collect,
that it was this place of Idols described in Beda, especially if we consider
the situation of both in the same distance and Tract: That of Delgovitia in
Antonine somewhat about XX. miles from York: VII thence to Derventio, then
XIII. to Delgovitia: and that in Beda, non procul ab Eboraco ad Orientem amnem
Doroventionem. Here note, that York was the best known place by which to find
out that place he aims at; which he, as you see, calls in his times
Godmundingham, at this day Godmanham, almost in the same sense as Delgovitia:
rendered Deorum Fanum, sive Habitatio. And whereas he sets down the site thereof
by the River Derventio running from the East, we are, (the place being indeed a
good way distant from it:) to make no more of that, but that it was the notedst
River near it. Neither was Beda any more, then I, any diligent (...), or
eyewitness, of his own Chorographical Descriptions. Every one knows, how
constantly close he kept to his Monastery: But well may his non procul be
excused for denoting XX. miles, when far longer distances are expressed by Not
far. One notable one I bear in mind out of the Herod. lib. 2. (...).

thousand Miles. The even distance, and upon the matter quite answerable by
Itinerary account, suites exceedingly well here: which it would by no means do,
if Delgovitia had ever been Wenbridge, (be it where it will; for I know not
yet:) which Harris. in utraque Antonini edit. ad calcem librorum ejus Descript.

Harrison however, and that upon second thoughts too, has not doubted to
publish; I am afraid, too unadvisedly.

PRAETORIUM M. P. XXV.]
It will be required, that I speak in the first place concerning the various
acceptions of the word, or name; whereby this Mansion is called. Praetorium
then was in the Roman Camp the place where the Generals Pavilion was pitched,
whether he were Consul, or as Praetor: the Preparation and Furniture of which,
after their excessive enrichment by the Conquest of Asia, was such, that their

signified so, Polybius, and the Greek Historians, render it by (...).

Out of the like affectation of magnificence they came at length to call their
Country houses, or dwellings for pleasure, Praetoria also. In former times they
named them villae. In Sen. Epist. 55.
Seneca you may see the description of such a one belonging to Servilius Vatia,
whom thence he styles divitem Praetorium. This may elsewhere appear. For
Spelunca, a Manor House of Tiberius by the Sea side, which is termed plainly
Villa in Tacit. Annal. 4. ad quem adisis Lipsium.
Tacitus, is the very same in Sueton. in Tiberio cap. 39.
Swetonius, according to the use of that age he wrote in, called Praetorium.
And so were all the nearer villae, and not of rustical employment.

Praetorium, in another sense, is as much as (...), a place of Judicature, or,
as in our English Bibels you have it translated, A Judgment H^l, from
Praetorium, ut (...), etc. in Gr. quoque contextu asservata, c^ si^ tamen

thereto:) as he was made King of the Jews by Augustus; otherwise he had

the Prince, every one knows, that does also the History of Massinissa, or Quam

Tacitus does truly observe, the Romans had every where instrumenta servitutis

Pontius Pilatut, who had likewise his John 18. 28, 33. Io. 19. 9.

old Interpreter renders by Procurare, contrary to his custom: who still uses
to translate (...) into Prasidem: except you will say his Copy had (...), which
we find by the diverse Readings to remain yet in some books. For indeed Palate
was not in Judea, with the power of a Praeses, or Leg^tus pro Praetore, which
are all one; but only as a Steward, or Procurator: as it was usual also in
other less considerable Provinces, which the authority of Tacitus sufficiently
confirms: Tacit. Annal. 15.
Auctor nominis eius Christus, qui Tiberio imperitante, per Procuratorem
Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat. True it is the Government of the
Provinces was diverse, accordingly as they were either belonging to Caesar, or
the Senate. Let us hear Tacitus concerning Britain reduced into the form of a
Province: in firm the Britans thus complain: Apud Tacitum in vita Agricolae.
Singulos sibi olim Reges ^uisse nunc binos imponi, e quibus Legatus
insanguinem, Procurator in bona viret: aeque discordium praepositorum, aeque
concordiam subjectis exitiosam: alterum manus, centuriones, alterum vim and
Contumelias misc^re: That whereas in former times they had only one King, now
were there two thrust upon them, The Lieutenant to suck their blood, the
Procurator their substance, whose disagreeing was the torment of the Subjects,
their agreement their undoing; the one vexing by Soldiers and Captains; the
other by wrongs and indignities.

Now whereas we have sufficiently showed, in the foregoing discourse about
EBORACUM, both out of Spartian and otherwise, that the Chief Praetorium in
britain, from before Severus times and long after, was at York under the power
of the several Legati Augg. for the time being; I cannot see what should hinder
us, why we may not think, that the respective Procuratores also may not have
had their residence here at Praetorium. And that not without very good reason
too. For, as Ulpian the Lawyer tells us, all ways and journeys ending most
commonly at the Sea, or at least great Rivers; and the whole ductus, or Tract
of this journey leading to the Sea side, (which others not observing have fowly
mist their way:) whom may I better conceive to have had his abode there, then
the Procurator, notwithstanding that all memories thereof are quite
extinguished by the all-whelming deluge of Time. All yearly Pensions, T^tes, or
Customs, from this part of the Island being by this j^urney, from the very
Bound of the Empire, conveyed hither unto him, as to the most convenient place
for exportation, and dispatch to Rome. And therefore with very good reason, as
I believe, did our great Antiquary assign the ancient being of Praetorium at
Patrington in Holdern^ss, near to the Sea side, near upon the (...) olim Ptol.

Praetorium was at Patrington the proportionable distance from Delgovitia, or

miles, but those copies which have XXV. best serve to make the particular
numbers to agree with the Summary in the head of the journey: the others have
but XXII. less suiting with the distance from Delgovitia to Patrington. Which
name, if it seem to any not handsomely made from Praetorium, let them consider
also, says Camden, that the Italians from Praetorium there have made
Petrouina. I might add that Joseph. (...) us ad Ptol. Geograph. lib. 2. and

this name, are to be met with. The Natives of the place glory much of what our
Praetorium has been in old time, and no less of the ancient commodiousness of
the Haven. Now they may also of the prospect into the most pleasant green

To tell you how pitifully learned men have been mistaken in assigning the
ground where this Praetorium of old had its standing, without having the least
heed to Itinerary distance, which shamefully most an end they neglect, were to
press upon your patience. My own pains however I will not spare: perhaps it may
delight some to know this too. Talbot then in the first place would have it to

And thus have we restored this first Journey, beginning beyond the WALL, where
the Limit of the Empire was in the Island; and ending here.

ITER. II.
THis second Journey is begun from the Western end of the Wall, which is
reported to have been drawn by Severus, when he saw he could do no more good
upon the Northern Britains, some good way beyond Carlisle, near upon the mouth
of Or Eden, in Cumberland.
Ituna; and it has its ending in the East of the Island at Rutupiae, or
Richborow, now called Sandwich in Kent. It is as it were the Diametre of the
whole Island, however of so much, as the Romans held subject to them.

The way this Journey takes, as Talbot thinks, is by the Watlingstreet, or,
as he says he met with it written in an old Book, Waeclyng-street, so called
because it passed thorough Watlingcester, by which name among the Britans, Hum.
Lhuyd. descript. Britan.
as well as Saxons, Verulamium of old was known, and for which at this day we
have S. Albans. The chief ancient ways, or thorough-fares of Britain, are by
the Interpreter, or Author, choose you whether you please, of the Galfrid. Hist.
Brit. lib. 1. cap. 16. and 18.
Britain History, ascribed to Dunwallo Malmutius; which afterward his Son
Belinus confirmed. Their courses are differently reported, and in some part
their names also: They are commonly made four in number; thus called, and
briefly described?

I. Watling-street, Out of the South East into the North East, from Dover to
Cardigan in Wales at the Irish Sea. II. The Fosse, from the South to the North,
from Totness in Cornwall, to Lincoln. III. Ermingstreet, Out of the West North
West, unto the East South East, beginning at S. David's, to Southampton. IV.
Iknel-street, by Worcester, and so by York, unto Tinmouth.
So commonly, I say,

To endeavor certainty in all these, were to obtrude (says Io. Seldom an^
not. in Polyolbion Cant. 16.
one, who was, if ever any one else among us, (...) (...):) unwarrantable
conjectures, and abuse both time, and the Reader. Of Watling it is said, that
it went from Dover in Kent, and so by the West of London (yet part of the name
seems to this day left in the middle of the City:) to S. Albans, and thence
having crossed the Fosse in a crooked line, through Shropshire (where yet also
the name abides:) by Wrekin hill unto Ranulp. Higden. Poly^b. lib. 1. cap. de

Cardigan by the Irish Sea side. But Hen. Huntingd. hist. lib. 1. vide An. 39.

British Historian, and Polychronicon; another Rog. Hoveden Annal. parpr^sol.

tells you, that the Sons of (I know not what) King Wetle, made and denominated
it. Now whereas our Talbot thinks, that the course which this journey took
was along the Watling street, sure he means it not of the whole Journey from
the beginning: for Chesler being the utmost bound, that we have set down, of
the Watling, he has not any authority for what he says, neither is it
probable there should be any elsewhere found. The Fosse is derived, by one
consent, out of Cornwall into Devonshire, through Somerset, over Cotes-wold by
Tewksbury, along near Coventry to Liecester, through Lincoln to Berwick, and
thence to Cathness, the utmost of Scotland. Our Antiquary supposes the
ditching of it on either side, was the reason of the name. Of Restitution of
the other you may be desperate. Rickneld street is to be found in Randall of
Chester, and by him derived from S. Dewies in Pembroke into Hereford, and so
through Worcester, Warwick, Derby, and Yorkshire to Tinmouth; which upon the
credit of the learned Poet Michael Drayto^ reporting it, is also justifiable by
a very ancient deed of Lands, bounded near Bermingham in Warwickshire by
Rickneld. In Henry of Huntingdon, no such name is found, but with the first
two, Ickenild, and Ermingstreet. Ickenild, says he, goes from East to West;
Ermingstreet, from South to North: Another tells us that Ermingstreet begins at
S. Dewies, and conveys it self to Southampton, which others attribute to
Ichning, begun (upon the words community with the Norfolk, and Suffolk.
Iceni) in the Eastern parts. It Is not in my power to reconcile all these,
says the most knowing Seldom, or elect the best. I only add, that
Ermingstreet being of English Idiom) seems to have had its name from (...), in
that signification, whereby it Adam Bremens. Eccles. Hist. cap. 5. Seldom. ad
Can. III. Polyolb. Anton. Corvin. Hist. Monasteriensi.
interprets an universal pillar worshipped for Mercury (others say Ernstiu^
Observe. lib. 1. (...). 17. Claris. Spelmanus in Arch^ologo.
Mars; however some Viacus or one of the Lares Viales) President of Ways: and
is like enough (if Huntingdon be in the right, making it from South, to North:)
to have left its part in Stanstreet in Surrey, where a way made with Stones and
Gravel, in a Soil on both sides very different, continues near a mile; and
thence near the Easternshore in Sussex, or some places seeming as other
Relics of it. But I here determine nothing about the public ways of Britain
in old time, either as set forth by King Belinus, or since drawn out and
described by our Monks, We see nothing therein but obscurity, and great
uncertainty; We rather adhere to what our learned Antiquary supplies us with,
where he informs us with more polite conceit, and judicious authority, that
they were a work of the Romans, for the better and more convenient marching of
their Soldiers, from Station to Station, and therefore called by them,
Militares viae; as also Consulares, Praetoriae, Publicae, etc, This we may
easily believe if we do but think how untaught, how uncivilized, how little
seen and furnished they were in regard of public conveniences any way. The
Britains themselves make it their complaint, by the mouth of their gallant
Prince Galgacus, in his brave Apud. Tacitum in vita Iul. Agricola.
Oration for Liberty, that such hard service as rearing, or making wales, was
first imposed on them by the Romans: Corpora ipsa (says he) ac manus sylvis ac
paludibus emuniendis, verbera inter ac contumelias, conterunt. And such was the
course they took in every Province where they bore sway. Vias publicas and
militares stratas ubique lapide aut glorea scimus, says Lipsius ad Nic.
Micault. lib. 3. Epist. 59.
one well skilled in such matters, atque ita aequabiles, and sine salebris,
faciles and meabiles curribus fuisse. Whence these Ways or Streets, were
called Stratae, of which we have spoken in what goes before. And now it being
warranted (for indeed so it must) that the Highways of Britain were of the
Romans raising, it cannot seem likely that in a Province so abounding with
Stations, or Camps, Fortresses, and Cities, to be seen in this Itinerary and
elsewhere, should have so few as four ways of any note in it; the Stations
being very many of them to be marched into by courses, no way holding with
these principal Ways; whereof they speak so confusedly.

I may add that we have sufficient testimonies by our eyes from the ruins of
many such, which yet visibly remain and appear to the Traveller; besides such
as we read of. As of Camden. in Siluribus.
Julia Strata in Monmouthshire, mentioned by Alexander Neckham, our old
Poetaster, in these verses: Intrat, and auget aquas Sabrini fluminis Osca
Praeceps: testis erit Julia Strata mihi.
Osca who entering, swells the Severne Flood
Clearly sets forth to me the Julian Road.


And from the very name it is the conjecture of learned Camden, that this way
was raised by order from Julius Frontinus, who by Tacit. ibid.
Tacitus is called vir magnus, and he tells us besides, that he brought under
with his power validam and pugnacem Mon^h. shire; etc.
Silurum gentem, super virtutem hostium, locorum quoque difficultates
eluctatus. I might here also mention Strata Marcella, which we find in
Cambrens. Itin. Cambria lib. 1. cap. 5.
Giraldus Cambrensis, at no very far distance from thence in his journey of
Wales, which with the same probability we may denominate from U^pius Marcellus
who was Propraetor here among us in Brit^n under Commodus, not very long after
Frontinus; and whose strictness and extraordinary severity in Military
discipline the excellent Roman Dio Hist. Roman. lib. 72.
Historian so much celebrateth.

A VALLO] This Vallum here, said to be raised bv Severus the Emperor, cutting
through the higher part of Cumberland, called also, as our learned Antiquary
has collected the several ^nonyma thereof, Vallum Barbaricum, was a Clusura,
or Mound of defense to the Provinciated part of the Island. The Roman Writers
call it thus commonly, as we see here in Antoninus, besides C^ssiodorus, and
some others; some Murus, as S. Aurelius Victor: some by both names, as Aelius
Spartianus in the life of Severus. The old Britains named it Gual. Sever, and
Gal. Sever, from the founder of it, and also Mur Sever. The Scots called it
Scottish-Waith. The English generally gave it the name Picts or P^hits Wall,
calling it so from the unreduced Britains, that were excluded thereby: and they
were named Picti, for that not being civilized by the Romans, they still
retained their ancient Country manner of painting their naked bodies; of which
writers say enough But to such as neighbor not far from it, it is known by
being called The Keep-Wall, or plainly The Wall, by a transcendant way of
expression, called in Greek commonly (...).

That huge bulk of the Body of the Roman Empire, being now come to its (...),
and to that vastness, that it became unweildy and cumbersom to it self, the
wiser Princes began to think of setting it some boundaries and limits. Hence it
is that Cornelius Tacitus Tacit. Annalium 1.
speaks thus of Augustus: Addiderat consitium coercendi intra terminos imperti:
incertum metu, an per invidiam. And some deal plainer, he speaks Tacit. in
vita Agricola.
elsewhere: After the death of Julius Caesar, says he, mox bella civilia, and
in rem publicam versa principum arma, ac longa oblivio Britanniae etiam in
pace. Consilium id Divus Augustus vocabat, Tiberius praecipue. Augustus called
it Advice or Policy to bound in the Empire, especially Tiberius: except you
will read in Tacitus, for praecipue, according as Fulvius Ursinus tells us it
was in his old book, praeceptum; and so interpret it, as a lessi^ which
Tiberius had learnt from his Predecessor. Now for the bounds of the Empire set
by Augustus, the same Tacitus will tell you, near the foregoing place out of
the I. Annal, what they were: Mart, Oceano, aut amnibus longinquis, septum
Imperium. For the Ocean, he never, either in person or otherwise, troubled it;
whatever some Servius Honoratus, Iun. Philargyrius. Christ Londinu^ in Virgil.
Grammarians, from a few places of Horace and Virgil misinterpreted, with such
like impertinent authorities have unadvisedly concluded; and for those amnes
longinqui, himself will tell you what they were in (...), (...) de Caesaribus,
not without arrogating to himself something for his moderation in this kind.
They were Ammianus bist. lib. 16.
Euphrates and the Danow; and he glories, that (...), etc. not giving way to
unmeasurable desires of conquering still more and more, I contented my self
with those two limits, as it were appointed by nature. The diligent Student may
also if he please see what the Dio Cassius Hist. Romans l. 56.
Historian says to this very purpose, concerning him.

Concerning the several kinds of Limets used sometimes in the Empire, enough
has been said in what Ad init. 1. Itineris.
goes before. Therefore having first acquainted the ordinary Reader, with the
frequent use of the several sorts of such, let me tell him too, that they were
by a peculiar name called Praetenturae, as by us in English Boundaries,
Fore-fences, Munitions, or the like: And not only by the Romans made use of
against the neighboring Barbarians, but by themselves also all along: for since
Constantines time we often read of them; as under Ammian. lib. 16. Historiae.
Julian of a Vallum Barbaricum in Germany: And we read likewise of a long Wall
raised from the Great Sea (so the Zanaras Hist. Tom. 3.
author speaks) by the Emperor So called for having his eyes doubly pupild.
Anastasius Dicorus even to Selybria; to keep off the Incursions of the

the eloquent Spaniard will tell us in the story of Emanuel King of Portugal,
that those ingenious people, whom they called the Chinois, did with a Wall of
many hundred miles hinder the hostile irruptions of the barbarous and inhumane
Tartarians; but of late years in our memory, it was demolished by a deluge of
the same barbarous people, to the unspeakable grief of the more civilized
world. Now whether the ancients borrowed this kind of fence from the Murus
Decelicus at Athens; or rather, to go higher from the Apud Homer. Iliad. M.
quem locum inspicere non gravabitur studiosus lector. Item (...). (...) ubi
Achilles de Aga^emnone verba faciens: (...).
Grecians Wall, which they made for safety of their Navy, against the violent
impression of Hector, and his associates, I permit to others, whose leisure is
more then mine, to take it into consideration. In this place then I shall only
refer the more industrious Student in this whole business, to the excellently
learned Frenchman, the honor of his Country, Pierre Pithou, in his first Book
of his Adversaria cap. XIV. not forgetting in the mean while those two notable
places of the neat and smooth Poet Claudian, in the former of which, he does
most accurately raise us a Vallum: Claudian. in Ruffinum lib. 2.
Tum dupli^i fossa non exuperabile Vallum
Asperat alternis sudibus, murique locatum
In speciem. --
There Trenches were, and Bulwarks made,
Well strengthened with a Pallasade.


And in the latter he describes to us that living Praetentura of men, always
by good reason thought the more substantial and effectual: V^nit and extremis
Legio praetenta Britannis Claud. lib. de Bell. Getico.

Quae Scoto dat frena truci.
The Legion to the Britain Borders came,
Proud Scots to tame.
And I urge it the rather, because it is such a Praetentura, as first occurs in
order, in the recension of such as we shall meet withal in the Island.

The first Praetentura, or Fore-fence, that we read of, placed here in the
Island by the Romans, was a Guard of Soldiers appointed by Julius Agricola to
keep the narrow passage between the two Seas or Friths, against the unconquered
Britains, by Sterlin in Scotland. But concerning it, it is better to hear
Tacitus in the life of that famous man his Worthy Father-in-law: Quarta aestas
obtinendis quae percurrerat insumpta; ac si virtus exerci^uum and Romani
nominis gloria pateretur, inventus in ipsa Brittannia terminus. Nam Glota and
Bodotria diversi maris aestu per immensum re^cti, angusto terrarum spatio
dirimuntur, quod tum praesidi^s firmabatur, atque omnis proprior sinus
tenebatur, summotis velut in aliam insulam hostibus. All which in English you
shall take from him, who in the age of our Fathers was deservedly accounted
another Tacitus both for gravity and wisdom. The former Summer was spent in
perusing and ordering Sr. Hen. Savile, doctis. Taciti Interpres.
that, which he had over run: and if the valiant minds of the Armies, and glory
of the Roman name could have permitted, or accepted it so, they needed not to
have sought other Limets of Britanny. For Den-^ Frith.
Glota and Edenborough Frith.
Bodotria, two arms of two contrary Seas, shooting mightily into the land, are
only divided asunder by a narrow partition of ground; which passage was
guarded and fortified then with a Garrison and Castle: so that the Romans were
absolute Lords of all on this side, having cast out the Enemy, as it were,
into another land. This happened not while Vespasian was yet Emperor, by whom,
says that famous Benedictine Monk Witichindus, some seven hundred years ago,
Witichindus in Saxon. Hist. lib. 1.
this Island was reduced into the form of a Province.

The next, but the first that ever drew a Wall-fence in Britain, was Hadrian
the Emperor; for before his time, as we have sufficient authority from
approved good Writers, the Romans made use of Camps and Stations, instead of
Walls: Herodian witnesses this of Augustus: Herod. (...) Hist. 1. initio.
(...). Tacitus using the peculiar Word proper to express a Wall drawn along:
Et quicquid Castrorum Armaeniis praetenditur. Aurelius Victor, speaking of
Trajan: Castra suspectioribus and oportunis locis extructa. Besides many other
places. But Hadrian being Emperor, as the Ael. Spart. in vita ejus.
Historian tells us. Frequenter in plurimis locis, in quibus barbari non
fluminibus sed limitibus dividuntur; stipitibus magnis in modum muralis sepis
funditus jactis atque connexis, barbaros seperavit. There are, who in this
place for muralis sepis, would have, militaris sepis, read. I say not how well;
yet a place in Varro de R. R. lib 1. cap. 14.
Varro comes into my mind: militare sepimentum est fossa, and ^erreus agger:
which may seem to confirm it. He did frequently in many places rear such Walls
as we mean here. And for Britain he speaks expressly. For having been put to it
by his Predecessors, who had let all of late go to ruin here, either by
Domitian's stupendous carelessenesse, or else by Nerva and Trajans being
elsewhere employed. Britanni teneri sub Romana ditione non poterant. There was
no keeping the Britans in subjection, says the same Historian. He then having
ordered the City affairs, took a Journey abroad to view what state the
Provinces stood in, and to visit them, which he did rigorously enough, as
appears, and going into Britain: Spartian. ubi supra.
in eo multa correxit, murumque per octoginta millia passuum primus duxit, qui
barbaros Romanosque divideret. This Wall was raised of Turfs, such as were even
now described: between the Mouths of the Rivers, Tine and the Esk. Then was he
fain to draw back the Roman forces about an hundred miles: so that I know not
how true that was of him in Britain, which S. Austine says of him in the East.
August. de C. D. l. 4. cap. 29.
Deus Terminus, qui non cessit Iovi, cessit Hadriani voluntati, cessit Iuliani
temeritati, cessit I^viniani necessitati. He had not so good luck here, as to
have God Terminus give place to him, but was fain to give way himself, and
retire back. Yet where he did sit down, he left a World of Monuments of his
memory behind him, as will appear all along by his Wall, upon the foundation of
which, most deal, that of Severus in after times was built: for learned men
direct us to * Nicetas Choniates hist. lib. 2.
think so: I might very well add in this place, in behalf of the studious
youth, that these kind of Walls are called by the later Grecians (...), for
(...), of (...), which signifies just as much as cespes.

The very next to this of Hadrian, was one raised under Antoninus Pius reign,
by Lollius Urbicus, who also did excellent service in the Island for him; which
because it was managed by his Lieutenant, Fronto, that Romanae eloquentiae ron
secundum sed alterum decus, Panegor. X. ad Constantium Caes. dicto.
thus tells Antoninus, That though like a Master at the Helm, he sat in his
Palace at Rome all the while, yet having given out the main order for the War
in Britain, he had deserved the whole glory of the voyage. He did particularly
conquer for him the Brigantes, as we readout of Pausan. (...).
Pausanias in his Arcadicks. But concerning the whole let us hear the testimony
of Julius Capitolinus in his life: Et Britannos per Lollium Urbicum Legatum
vicit, alio muro cespetitio, submotis barbaris, ducto. In which words Io.
Livineius would faign turn alio, into aleo such are our great Critics, or
rather (...): when as by alio the Historian would have that other Wall of
Hadrian understood: distinct and quite another from this. For that there were
several Walls in Britain, and raised by several men, upon several occasions, I
could produce the authority of Eumenius the Rhetor, where a little before he
had mentioned Britain; Eumen. orat. pr^ schotis instanr^ndis.
Quot ubique muri, vix repertis veterum fundamentorum vestigiis excitantur? Of
the ruins of this, or the former, or both, is Dio, or rather Xiphiline out of
him to be understood. (...). Murus qui dividit Brittannos, and Romanorum
castra. And very likely Aristides the Orator alludeth thereto: (...). Arissed.
(...) seu Romae Laudatione.
Hic etiam opposuistis muros, and urbes exploratorias condidistis. Beyond
Sterlin most certainly was not this Wall made, as will appear by inscriptions
found thereabout to be seen in Camden: and that either for the convenience of
the strait passage between the two Friths: or else for that the Land beyond was
not worth owning, the Romans having already the better part of the Island, and
Page 65. and 69^.
that too, not so useful, as an Appi^n. Alexandrin. Prooem. ad Histor. (...).
Author then living in Antoninus days puts it out of all question. However
Fuit and alius post eum Lollius Urbicus: qui sui temporis Historiam sub
Heliogabalo conscripsit: de eo videndus est Casauhonus ad Aug. Hist. Scriptores.
Lollius Urbicus, the undertaker for the whole here, was certainly a most
gallant man, and Commander; and I remember in Apuleius his Apology I find him
Lollius Urbicus V. C. Praefectus Urbis. And in ancient Coins I find that he
deserved the Title of BRITANNICUS.

The Romans after Commodus; (as if by him they had not had loss enough:)
falling out at home among themselves, occasioned in the Britains some attempts
near to a revolt, and from thence another Wall far exceeding the former, in
fame, as well as magnificence, was erected. For Albinus Caesar, sometimes

he afterward made an expedition, with both his Sons, into Britain; where lately

Dio:) with the loss of about fifty thousand men; and then having made a league
with the natives, on condition they would agree to retire so far, he then began
to erect a Wall, of which hear Ael. ^rt. in vita Severi.
Spartianus speaking of him: Britanniam (quod maximum ejus Imperia decus est)
muro per transversam insulam ducto, utrinque ad sinem Oceani munivit: unde
etiam BRITANNICI nomen accepit. And elsewhere in his life. Post Murum aut
Vallum missum in Britannia, quum ad proximam mansionem rediret, non solum
victor, sed etiam in aet^rnum pace fundata. In Severi ult editore Schotio.
Aurelius Victor also seems to have taken what he says, out of the same
Author, which Spartian made use of. His majora aggressus, Britanniam, quae ad
ea utilis erat, ^u sis hostibus, muro munivit, per transversam insulam ducto,
ulrinque ad finem Oceani. The learned Casaubon reads it: quo ad ea utilis:
which I only note here, but the discreet Reader may follow his own judgment in
whether reading he please. And I may add hither also that testimony of Dio
concerning the Wall, where he tells us that the Maeatae had their being about
it: Dio Cassius Hist. Rom ubi de Severi gestis.
(...). The Maeatae, says he, dweil by the very Wall, which divides the Island
in two parts. Now the place where that was, if it be true which we find all men
affirm, is where Hadrians Wall was first raised, for on the foundation of that,
they say, was this Wall of Severus built, and near the whole way along too from
Sea to Sea, save that this had its ending toward the West or Irish Sea, in
Itunae aestuario, or Sol^ey Frith, the other in the Mouth of the Esk, called by
some Scots Wa^h: and that (...) Wall was led strait along tramite dir^ (...)
speaks; Hadrians Wall in somewhat an uneven passage or draught, as they can
tell that have seen such ruins of it as are at this day extant. This being
cleared, and confessed on all hands, there remain yet two doubts: First,
whether this Pr^tenture, or Wall, was made of Stone, or of Turss: and secondly,
what the length thereof was, and how the numbers, for that, are to be read in
old Writers? First then the common opinion among our Saxon Authors, and some
others less ancient, is, that it was Vallum CCespititium, or made of Turses,
and slakes: our Writers follow Beda, and so does the learned Camden seem to do,
whom we worthily call our chief Antiquary; to him therefore have recourse, for
what they say. The famous Salmasius also, a man thou^ht by many to know all
that is to be known, says so too of ^is Wall, Salmasius in Spartianum.
Murus ille Cespititius suit, nec ^ovum est vocari Vallum murum Cespititium. He
tells us besides that inter Oceani Occidentalis famosos montes, in A^hicus his
Cosmography, that where in the printed ones you have Trienum, Alps plucimas,
Appenninum Balearem; in his written Copy, much differing from those extant, for
Balearem, there is to be found Ballum Britanniae; quod de hoc vallo manifesto
accipiendum est, says he; and tells he will plurimis ad ipsum Aethicum docere.
But we have not yet had the luck to see his edition of Aethicus, neither indeed
know I, whether it be yet abroad; and therefore can say yet very little to it.
The place of Beda is very much noted; and it will be worth the while for us to
take notice of his learned Criticism: Beda Eccl. Hist. lib. 1. (...).
Severus, says he, receptam partem insulae, a caeteris indomitis gentibus non
muro (ut quidam aestimant) sed Vallo distinguendam putavit. Murus etenim de
lapidibus; Vallum vero (quoad repellendam vim hostis cum castra muniuntur) fit
de Cespitibus, quibus circumcisis e terra, velut Murus exstruitur altus super
terram, ita ut ^arn. Gr.
in ante fiat fossa, de qua levati sunt cespites, supra quam sudes de lignis
fortissimis praefiguntur. Itaque Severus magnam fossam sirmissimumque Vallum,
crebris insuper turribus communitum, a mari ad mare duxit. But now on the other
side, with this whole passage here is the most discerning Quem adi in Primord
Eccles^ Brit. page 1025, 1026, 1027.
Dr. Usher directly offended, imputing it to ignorance, that the good old
Presbyter never heard of Hadrians Wall, which Quod in sibi persuadi non v^li
Geo. Buchananus Hist. Scot. lib. 4. in Reg^ XXIII.
occasioned his mistake, to erect Severus Wall of Turfs: and that the Latin
word Vallum (in like manner as the English Wall, and the British Gual, both
thence derived:) does signify and mean the very same that Murus, which yet
Salmasius does readily acknowledge: and hence it is that he mends Spartianus,
as you see before, thus: Post murum aut Vallum missum: of which, says Usher,
recte restituit: for formerly, says Salmasius himself, what is Murum apud
Vallum mittere? Again he tells us that Beda was deceived by the fallacious
distinction between Murus and Vallum: For I know no good authority for it out
of any Latin Writer: Varro de R. R. lib. 1. cap. 14.
Varro will tell you, that they used to call Murum, aggerem sine fossa. A mound
without a ditch. Which by no means suites with the Vallum they think of here,
where they dream of their sossatum magnum, and that on both sides sometimes.
But neither do the Elogia bestowed on this Vallum by ancient Historians, any
whit suite with it, were it but simply raised with Turf, and Earth. His majora
aggressus, says Victor before. Maximum ejus Imperii decus, says Spartian of
this Wall. Did he nothing then to out value a dirt Wall? Was his Septizonium of
no greater esteem? Well then might Aethicus rank it among the Western
Mountains. But I recommend the inquisitive Reader to the very place, where the
learned Doctor urges his irrefragable arguments to prove that Severus his Wall
was set up of firm Stone. And will see what I can do to rectify the numbers of
its length from shore to shore. To let pass therefore Fordon, who as he is not
ancient enough to be corrupted, so he was not too old to be deceived, defining
the length of this Wall to have the space of but XXII. Miles. Aurelius Victor
(I mean the ordinary one; not that of Schottus Edition forementioned:) may well
be numbered among the ancients, and yet he is as foully out almost: Hic [Severus]
in Britannia Vallum per triginta duo passuum millia a mari ad mare deduxit.
Eutrop^s in his Eutrop. lib. 8. ad Valent. Imp.
Roman History has little mended the matter: speaking of Severus. Novissimum

Vallum per V was soon made out of the two strokes of II.
Triginta quinque millia passuum a mari ad mare deduxit. But his most ancient
Copies a great deal farther exceeded, then these now adays come short of the
true number, for they had the note of a Centenary C. set before this number
here, as may be concluded from old Latin Writers who had him for an Author,
and exscribed him, as Hierom in his Edition of Eusebius his Chronicle, commonly
called Eusebius his Libellus Temporum in some MSS. Severus in Britanniam
transfert bellum, ubi ut receptas provincias ab incursione Barbarica faceret
securiores, Vallum per CXXXII. M. P. a mari ad mare duxit. So likewise Orosius

testimonies? That his most ancient Copies had it so, is plain out of ^anius,
the Greek Metaphrasi of Futropius, in whom you read (...). Two and thirty

time we may easily g^s at the ground of the mistake of the Librarius or
Transcriber, whence this Error proceeded. It was first truly written LXXXII.

it was made CXXXII the L. (which might easily be done) being turned into C.
especially if we consider the fashion it was of in old time (...) by other
Libraries, the L. scarely appearing, it was quite left out, and so the number
became XXXII. That by this means and occasion the error happened in so many
Authors, I presume we may be very consident. And more then that Adi Spart. and
Camden page 650, 651
middle number LXXXII. the space of the place between Sea and Sea does not
afford. As for Geo. Buchan. Hist. Scot. lib. 3.
Buchana, we mind him not, who would men O^sius, and for CXXXII. would have it
read only XXXII

And this is all that shall be spoken in this place of Severi Vallum; only
this may be added, and that me seems very confidently, that it remain^d till
after ages, wherein Theodosius the youngers time there lay near by it, per
Lineam Valli, says the Notitia Occidentis, V. Spectabilis Dux Britanniarum,
with no less then XXIII. Tribunes of Cohorts, and Praefecti Alarm, etc.
disposed up and down as he thought most convenient.

The next Praetentura, or Rampire, we meet with in the Roman History,
pertaining to Britain, is that which C. Carausius made in the narrow passage
where formerly Julius Agricola had placed his Watch or Garrison between the two
Friths of Edenbrough and Dunbritton against the Inrodes of the barbarous
Britans. This Carausius being S. Aureliu: Victor Schotti.

(...) in Belgica, theirs being by him named Castellum:) yet for all that
Camden, or Usher have alleged, he may be of Belgic etraction, being plainly
called by Eumeins the Rhetor terrae Batav^ae alumnus. This Carausius, I say,
about the III. year of Dioclesian, being brought up a Seaman from his youth,
was by him employed to guard the British Seas against the roving Pirates Franks
and Saxons, and being for some attempts threatened with death by Maximinian
Augustus, Aurel. Vict. Eutrop. l 9. Oros. l. 7. cap. 25. Beda lib. 1. cap. 6.

when no good could be done upon him by the Emperors, he was let alone with his
Government. Vict. Schotti.

During the time of his sway in the Island, say the Galf. Mon. Hist. Brit. lib.

memories and records of our own Nation, if perchance not excepted against;
that the Scythians having been formerly invited by Fulgenius to oppose the
Emperor Severus, this Carausius granted to the portion of them, yet remaing
room among the Britains, in Caledonia; and that he shut them out from the other
inhabitants of the Island with a Wall, as is aforesaid. Our authority for this
is to be had out of Histor. Britonum.
Ninnius, or his Interpolator at least, who ever he was: Carausius Postea
Imperator reaedisicavit, and septem castellis munivit, inter utraque ostia:
domumque rotundam politis lapidibus super r^pam fluminis Carun, quod a sua
nomine nomen accepit, fornicemque triumphal^m in victoriae memoriam erigens,
construxit. Besides that Aurelius Victor does hint at it in his foregoing
words. This Wall at this day is called Grahamsdyke, and the house Arthurs Oven,
and Julius H^ff: Which Buchanan Buchanan. Hist. Scot. lib. 4. in Rege XXVII
conceited to be a Temple of the God Terminus; as you may see by his Words. Id
opus nonnulli falso prodid^runt templum Claudii Caesaris fuisse. Nos, quantum
conjectura possumus assequi, Aedem Termini suisse credimus. Erant item in

satis apparet) congesti. Minoris, qui magis ad occasum vergit, bona pars
alluvione amnis est ablata. Dunos pacis adhuc accolae vocant.

Besides, now we must take heed that from hence, or the like passages, we do
not with strangers and foreiners feign to our selves that usual and
acknowledged separation and division, wont to be for very many ages between us
and Scotland; as Ioannes Sichardus has noted to that of Eusebius [Carausium
sumpta purpura Britannias occupavisse.] these words: Hic puto Scotiam ab Anglia
primum divisam: And with the like judgment Henricus Glareanus on Eutropius;
when he, speaking of Severus Wall, the other very learnedly, you will say,
observes upon him: and sic body separatur Scotia ab Anglia.

The next after him; for I forbear to mention Dioclesian, although Zosimus
Zossm. Hist. lib. 2.
highly praises him, for that (...) every where in the limets of the Empire, he
did so providently fence the whole Vrbibus and praesidiis and burgis.
(...). For he never having been in Britain, the Historian meant, it is likely,
the Empires bounds elsewhere. And I may make near as good an excuse, for
leaving out Constantine the Great: for though he were sometimes resident here,
and ordered things exceedingly well in the Island, yet is he by the same
Historian much traduced, as who broke down such Munitions and defenses as were
formerly made; that he removed the Soldiers from praesidiary Towns that stood
on the borders, to such as needed no garrison; and finally laid open to the
enemies incursions, such as were already frequently alarmed and assaulted by
them. Such and more heinous, if might be, are the criminations wherewith that
lying Historian does asperse Constantine, whose parallel in such suffering in
future ages I only name Justinian; a worthy gallant Prince, standered by a
Procopius, in Historia (...) Romae a Nicol. Alemano-edita, G^co-Lat.
blackmouthed relater of his great and glorious actions.

The next then, as I was saying, after Carausius, was Theodosius, who
strengthened and fenced Britain, and whose prowess and gallantry I had rather
you were made acquainted with in Am. Marcel. H^st. lib. 28.
Marc^llirus his words, then mine: Hinc ad corrigenda plura conversus and
necessaria, periculo peni^us dempto, eum aperte constare nulla ejus caepta
propitiam deseruisse fortunam, instaurabat urbes and praesidiaria ut diximus
castra, limitesque vigi^is tuebatur and Praetenturis (...) provinciam, quae in
di^nem concesserat ho^um, ita reddiderat sta^ui pristino: ut eodem referente,
and rectorem haberet Legitimum, and Valentia deinde vocaretur arbitrio
Principis. And here I cannot moderate my self, but bring out of the same
Historian the very Ibidem, nisi, quod in (...) quaedam sit and hiuus; (...) an
temporum an magis hominum ^io.
next words, giving a clear testimony of his provident care for preserving the
limets, in punishing the Areani then fallen into foul neglect and abuse of
their office: Areanos, says he, genus hominum a veteribus inst^utum, super
quibus aliqua in Quibus apud eum deperditis damnum contigit haud reparabile in
rerum Britanniarum historia.

allectos, quae apud nos agebantur aliquotiens barbaris prodidisse. Id enim
illis erat officium ut ultro citroque per longa spatia discurrentes vicinarum
gentium strepitus nostris ducions intimarent.

So deserving a Commander (for Hist. lib. 28
Marcellinus compares him with Domitius Carbulo in Nero's time, whom the
Tacitus.
wisest Historian so surpassingly advances:) whose Tropaees and triumphs were
every where extant and conspicuous, and whose providence for the safety of the
whole Empire was not inferior to, but exceeded, that of the best Princes, came
by ^
free Election at length to take charge of all, being a man, both for his
excellent Natural Endowments, as well as for his wonderful stately
comeliness, born and made to command the whole World. And had I not said
enough of him out of Marcellinus, I would recommend to the studious youth, (and
yet however I will do it) the excellent and eloquent Latini Pacati D. repani.

Britain. And that learned Author, who ever he was, who wrote the Book De Rebus
Bellicis, ad Theodosium and filios, seems not to me so much to have directly
advised them, to what was fitting in this kind for them to do; as to have
expressed lively the Imitable practice and performance of so renowned a Chief
and Soldier.

And the Younger Theodosius also directly trod in the steps of so glorious ^an
example; as may be seen by the Laws of his time; enjoining Cod. Theodos^.
Magister Officiorum yearly to acquaint the Emperor in what case the Rampires,
Garrisons, and Soldiery in General every where stood; as the Studious Reader
may see at his pleasure.

And here in a discourse De Limitum cura and custodia; and that in Britain too,
is it possible I can omit the glorious name of Flavius Stilicho, whose (...)
here, peace I mean and security in this Island, the brave Poet Clau-Claudian
does so highly advance in verse, which shall outlive time, and a worse vermin
then Mothes, ill men. For thus he brings in Britain, speaking by a
Prosopopoeia: Claud. Panegyr. 2. in Stili^onem.

Me also, thou, O Stilicho, did aid,
By neighboring Nations overran, she said;
When Scots brought Irish to my fertile shores,
And Thetis foamed, plowed with invading Oars.
Yet I not feared the Scots, nor Pictish Host,
Nor Saxons sailing to invade our Coast.


Elsewhere he affirms the same thing, as thus: Claud. lib. de Bello Getico.
Venit and extremis Legio praetenta Britannis,
Quae Scoto dat fraena truci; ferroque notatas
Perlegit exanimes Picto moriente figuras.
The Legion on the British borders lay,
Which curbed the valiant Scot, and did survey
The steel-cut figures on the dying Pict.


And again in another place. Claud. lib.

The waves to beaten Saxons were more mild,
Or Britannie the Picts by force exilde.


I know well enough, that the actions of Sti^cho are diversely related by
others, from what you meet with in Claudi^n, and therefore what he says,
Carol. Molinaeus De Orig. Monarch. Franticae part. 1. aliique.
is reputed but for Poetical sigments. But as wise men as them think not so;
for whatever you read of in Claudian about him, depends upon sure grounds, and
granted by such, whose knowledge of the Saxons outgoes Hengists time. For that
they a long while before, in the beginning of Valentinians Empire, annoyed the
Britans and their Coasts, we have good authority. Saxones Brittannos ^nis

Theodosius his time they are near spoiled at Sea, where they used to rove. And
within not so long after, we find that to keep off their violence and fury from
the Island, Notitia Im perii Occidentis
Comitem littoris Saxonici per brittanniam placed here, with forces assigned
him for that purpose, so that I need not to look for further proof, out of the
forenamed Panegyric, or else out of Sidonius Apollinaris, or any where else,
to defend our good Poet: sure I am there are far worse fictions told by some of
our Historians in prose.

I more hearken after them, who cry out, Enough of this Vallum. There is more
than sitting said of it already. Well then be it so. We will therefore have the
less to say to Gallio Ravennas, and his Legion, with the Wall he built here for
the Britans safety: for which I refer you to Paulus Diaconus, Blandus, and
others. As I would also have you, for those raised afterward by the Britans
themselves, for the same purpose to go to Gildas in his Epistle, in which you
have the miseries of those, and the times near thereupon lively described, And
to him you may add the Venerable Bede, who as is well known, has most out of
him, in the twelfth Chapter of his first Book of his Ecclesiastical History of
the English, as it is vulgarly entitled. As for Gildas his Latin, because it
is generally harsh and forced, I let it alone, and commend the Reader to his
English, which is commonly to be had in Paul's Churchyard. Take Beda then, as
smoother, and easier to be dealt withal, by the ordinary English man, if ever
he were at the Latin School. Exin Britannia, says he, omni armato milite,

sunerum, aut jugulamue, aut mergimur. This sad misfortune, and comfortless
condition, happened to the Britans during the Consulship of Aetius the III.

Theod^sius the younger; and in the 446 of Christ; according to Eccles. hist.

If any, with our ((...)) Camden, following Baron. An. 446. sect. 1.
Baronius, be offended (c) Camden. Brit. page 77. 94. 95.
either with the Consuls name, (for in the most copies of Beda, I mean not the
best, you have Boetio for Aetio, which Camden seems to maintain:) or with the
account of years, he shall find Beda justified and cleared by the incomparable

down the draught and course of the Vallum, here principally intended, and that
from as sufficient Sr. Rob. Co^* Eq. Baronets. Guil. Camdenus Claren Cieul^.
(...) inspectores, as any ever beheld it, since the first raising thereof.

The course of the Vallum then began at Blatum-Bulgium, or Bullness, by the
Irish Ocean, and goes along the Frith, or mouth of Eden, by Burgh upon Sands to
Carlisle, where it passes the Eden, from thence it goes along, and having on
one side the River Irthing, it passes over the small River Cambeck which has
in it many windings, and where many relics are of an old Castle, afterward
passing the Irthing and Poltrosse, it enters Northumberland, and amongst the
frequent heaps of hills holding on along the river, which they call the
Southern Tine, (only divided by the Northern Tine, making a breach in it, where
of old time a Bridge was laid over it:) it goes on even to the German Ocean.

AD PORTUM RITUPIIS.
Of this Station I have spoken enough at the very beginning of this Itinerary.
It is the very last of this J^ney.

CCCCLXXXI. M. P.] The whole sum of the miles in this Journey, is in the vulgar
Copies of Antoninus 481. set in the beginning thereof, and it is mended in some
491. But neither number will near agree with the particulars, if you sum them
up together; for they come to 510. Surita the Spaniard, who used good store of
Manuscripts, of which yet we are wholly destitute, brings us here among his
Var. Lectiones (for so Thuanus had rather call them, then Commentarii, as
himself does:) no help, or direction by them. That no fault should happen among
so many worthy Transcribers, was a thing not to be expected. But our good
Antoninus has been so unlucky (which is the complaint of all that have had to
do with him:) as to be corrupted in things least curable by the very Chirons of
Criticism, yet most proclive to error in such unlearned and heedless hands,
Numbers I mean, and proper Names, of which yet he only consists.

Have the whole Journey therefore, as it is in the vulgar Editions. As we go
along, we will take notice of what may be rectified, in hope to reconcile the
particular numbers, with the summary, if possibly it may be.

BLATUM BULGIUM.] This Station was not distant a full mile from Severus Wall;
whose foundations are easily discerned in Ituna at an ebbing tide. So is Eden
called by Ptolemy, by which this place of old stood; so that Robert Talbot was
quite out, seeking for it by Glota or Edenborough-Frith. Some part of the old
name being yet preserved, it is at this day called Bulnesse, which is said to
be but a very small village, yet has it to show what it was, a Bulwark yet
remaining, besides the draught of the old Streets, and ancient Walls; as our
Antiquary witnesses; who also derives Bulgium from a word among the old
Britains Bulch; signifying a partition, or Separation; because the Wall being
somewhat like some God Terminus, as he speaks out of the Poet; -- Geo. Buchan.
Ausonii signet divortia regni; or seperates the Roman power from the rest of
the Island not yet fully reduced. Josias Simler mistakes it for Aballaba, a
Station also in Cumberland: of which see more out of the Notitia of the Western
Empire. As I know not what Blatum means; so I know that to read it Blotum, with
Holyoke is against the Authority of all Copies. This and the like is noted for
Schools, that young men there may not be deceived, what ever the word Blatum
stands for.

CASTRA EXPLORATORUM. M P. XII.]
The remoteness of this Station from Blatum Iulgium is everally set down: as
XII. M. P. in Aldus, and others: which is altered into X. and XV. as not only
appears by Simler, but by the several Manuscripts which Surita brings. The
distance here however, where (as I must elsewhere also often warn:) the way is
not always by the shortest cut, but most an end by the more noted Garrisons;
does suite well, as well from Bulness, as Carleil, to make it, as our
Antiquary, an eyewitness of the Situation of the place, and that upon second
thoughts, is persuaded, to have been that which we now call Burgh upon Sands;
for he waves their opinion, as besides the mark, who would have it to be
Drumbough Castle. And we may also neglect Talbots conceit, who was quite wide,
when he dreamt this to be Alata Castra in (...). Ptolemy Edenborough.
Ptolemy. Castra indeed was the usual word for a Camp, or place of refidence
of Soldiers. But these Castra being called Exploratorum, they are in all
likelihood to be sought for upon the Frontiers. The Grecians called them (...),
or Limitaneae Urbes: as Aristides the Aristid. Encom. 11. Roma.
Orator; after whose time also they began to name them (...), or (...). One of
these two words must necessarily be restored in Menander in Methodo laudandar.
V^bium. flor. sub Mauritio Imp.
Menander the Rhetorician, for it is read in him hitherto without any sense,
(...): which being turned into (...) would clear all doubt. For naught else in
this place of the Author can be meant. Not to defraud any man of his due right,
the emendation is learned Casaub. in Spartian.
Isaac Casaubon's.

Many else of this kind may be observed to have been in Britain, to watch the
courses of the Enemy. Besides the Areani, spoken of erewhile out of Marcel lib.
Hist. 29.
Marcellinus; you may remember the Numeri Exploratorum mentioned in an old
Stone in BREMENIUM in the first Journey beyond the Wall. On this side the Wall
too you have at Lavatres sub dispositione V. Spectabilis Ducis Britanniarum
Praefectum Numeri Exploratorum. So that I need not have recourse to the South
of the Island, to ADURNI PORTUS; where also was usually a Notitia Imp.
Occidentis.
Praepositus Numeri Exploratorum sub Dispositione Viri Spectabilis Comitis
Littoris Saxonici per Brittanniam.

The situation of the place is round about here, says Camden, who was there,
ad explorandum commodissimus, and gives good reason for it, as you may please
to see. To speak a word or two at large my self to the youth concerning these
Exploratores.

In Greek they were called (...), which Eustathius renders Eustat. Par. in

Lawyer at his leisure, when he thinks good.

As Cumberland, of all the shires we have, is accounted the best furnished with
Roman Antiquities, so does this portion of it hereabouts supply us with the
knowledge of somewhat in our affairs, whereof in books there is altum
silentium. As some matters of Commodus the Emperor. First Fuscianus II.
Silanus II. Coss. Then how Atticus and Praetextatus being Coss. under Gordian,
that Nonnius Philippus was Propraetor or Legate in Britain, and Aemilius
Crispinus, an African, was Commander of the Ala Augusta Gordiana. Next there
may be seen Inscriptions to M. Julius Philippus the Emperor, and his Son;
neither the same with Gordians Legate here: yet both succeeded in the Empire.
There were found Inscriptions also to some Topicall Gods; as Vide Clariss.
Seldom. De Dis Syriis Syntagm. 2. cap. 1.
Deo Sancto Belatucadro, and Deo Ceai: of which in another place better.

LUGUVALLUM M. P. XII.] That Luguvallum here, or Lugubalia among the Monks, was
Carleil, is past all doubt, by the affirmation of all ages down along. The
difference in the names has already been satisfied for, as where you say
Ballum for Vallum, and V. BINOVIVM Itin. 1.
elsewhere too. So there will be no trouble about that. But rather about the
origination of the name, wherein Leland does fowly boggle, and yet not clearly
expedite himself. Camden some deal better, as who was far more skilled in
learned Antiquities. He then deduces it from the famous Vallum near which it
was, and Lugos, or such a like word, which signifies a Tower, and concludes it
so, by comparing Ptol. Geog. lib. 2.
Ptolemy with Mela l. 3. De situ Orbis. c. 1.
Pomponius Mela. For in the former the place that is called (...), is in the
later named Hodie Oluca vel Luga Siml. in Anton. p. 281
Turris Augusti. So that Luguvallum must signify the Tower or Muniment by the
Vallum. And had the French Antiquaries taken this course in deriving the names
of their two ancient and principal Cities Lugdunum, and (...), Ptol.
Lucotetia; they had not made themselves so ridiculous to strangers, deducing
the one from Lu^um, Dirt; and the other from Lugdus, I know not what imaginary
King who built it; which I will as soon believe, as the building of Turonunt,
by Turonu^, in Gal. Monm. in Brit. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 8.
Geofrey of Monmouth, vouching for it Ho^ter; but it is not my good luck to
know where. I like better the origination thereof, which I find in Plut. lib.
de fluminibus.
Plutarch if he be the Author of the Book (...), where he says out of
Clitophon's (...) I^ that Lugdunum was so called because * (...). Dio l. 46.
the foundations of the City being laid, the Crows suddenly appearing with
fluttering wings, filled all the Trees thereabout. (...). says he, (...)
(...). So that Vide Geo. Buchan. Rerum Scoticarum l. 2.
Lugdunum by this must signify the Crows hill. And truly as many Cities of
Gaul and Britain as end in Dunum, and there are not a few, are found placed
upon hills, or rising grounds. The Grecians called such kind of higher places
(...), which word the Grammarians Herod. in Melpoment.
out of Herodotus say, is Libyan. See more in Eustat. in Odyss. ipso stat^
initio.
Eustathius upon Homer. But much rather do I like that which is to be had, set
before the Itineraries published by Andr. Schottus being a short glossary out
of P. Pithaeus Library, expounding certain Gallique words, among which you have
Lugdunum, Desideratus mo^s, wherein you have likewise the signification of
Dunum asserted and made good. For though other Writers consent not with
Plutarch, concerning the deduction of the former part of the name, as we see,
and may do also by Henricus Benedictus Altissiodorensis, who wrote near eight
hundred years agone, in the age of Carolus Calvus, in Altiss. de vita S. Ger.
l. 4.
the life of St. German, in these verses. Lugduno celebrant Gallorum famine
nomen
Impositum quondam, quod sit Mons lucidus idem.
The ancient Gaul, thy noble Pile,
From thy bright Hill, Lugdunum style.
Yet they do generally in the hinder part thereof. As besides others Sen.
Epist. XCI.
Seneca, in that Epistle where he tells of the burning of Lugdunum: Civitas
(says he) uni imposita and huic non altissimo monti. Wherewith the learned De
Gracit Hist. lib. 3.
Vossiu^ with very good judgment mended that place in Strabo Strab. Geog. lib.
IV.
(...), reading it (...). Such being the situation of the place. Now whereas it
cannot be denied, but that Luguvallum was a Station or place near the Vallum,
give me leave to speak freely what I think of it, namely that Ael. Spartianus
in the life of Severus does intend no other Mansion but it, in these words.
Post Murum aut Vallum missum in Britannia, quum ad proximam Mansionem rediret,
non solum Victor, sed etiam in aet^rnum pace fundata, volvens animo, quid
ominis sibi occu^reret; Aethrops quidam e numero militari, etc. The very
situation leads me to think, that he means none other by that Proximam
Minsionem, then Luguvallum, or Carleil. Besides, that which mainly induces me
to believe so, is that the Sixth Legion, having dispatched the service Severus
set them upon, the rearing of the Wall, left behind them here a remembrance of
themselves, yet to be seen, in large and elegant Characters. LEG. VI. VIC. P.
F. G. P. R. F.

There is to be seen here likewise another Inscription, but of a later age,
made to preserve the memory of Marcus Trojanus, set up by his Dearest Wife,
which they that will, may see in Camden.

About the times of William II. William of Malmesbury, speaking, has these
Words. Visum erat triclinium Romanum ex lapidibus forntcibus concamtratum, quod
nulla unquam tempestatum contumelia, aut ignium flamma labe factari potuit, in
cujus front inscriptum erat MARII VICTORIAE. The Wits of the former age, did
severally exercise themselves, to know what the meaning might be; some
contending it belonged to Arviragus, who in the British story is called Marius;
others thought it that Emperor but for three days; He had been a Smith, and
was killed with a sword of his own making, by a servant of his slighted by him.
Treb. in 30. Tyrannis.
Marius, who in Gallienus his time was saluted Emperor. But much amiss. Our
Antiquary informs us that the best Copies of Malmesbury had written MARTI
VICTORI: and that he likes best, as I do also. Such Inscriptions are not
difficultly to be come by every where. And having no Manuscripts of Malmesbury
at hand, I must be content. So much therefore of Luguvallum shall be said at
this time. Adding this only, that Lugubalia, from which contracted the Saxons
name Whence Cair Luel, and in time Carleil.
Luel, by which they called this Town, was written at the Monks pleasure, with
a single or double L. but the later is the best. The Reader I hope will of
himself take notice of the Enallage genetis: and why, with others, I refer him
not to Lucopibia in Ptolemy, he shall know, when I come to it.

VOREDA M. P. XIIII.] The distance of this Station from Luguvallum (though a
long while I thought it to be incertae positionis and that for the very names
sake it self:) is such that I can better confute Talbot in assigning where it
was, then positively affirm any thing my self. He would have it be Ptolemies
(...), far away remote among the Venicon^s, a people in old time of that we now
call Scotia, which he with others say was Newcastle, but that too is too too
much distant, then that it can agree with the number of miles set down here.
But more of that God willing to Ptolemy.

Camden in his Catalogue of the ancient Cities of Britain, sets down to this
^oreda, Old Perith, and says nothing else of it in his great work; of which I
know not what to say, but that it was an (...) of his: for Old Perish is
elsewhere called by him Petriana, mentioned in the Notitia, called so either
from the river of a like name running near or from the Ala Petriana residing
there, as is to be seen by an old Inscription, which might occasion the
alteration of the name Voreda into Petriana, I list not here to determine.
However look for Petriana as you were before directed.

The learned Fulk will have Voredae to have been Wederuud, not without some
kind of agnomination; but because I know where it has its being, I will say
no more of it.

BROVONACIS. M. P. XIII.] So here. But in the fifth Journey Brocavo; as Talbot
and Surita read it, but Brocovo, as Aldus and Simler. They are both the same
Mansion: for in both Journeys you find it between Luguvallum and Verterae;
saving that here Voreda interposes between it, and Luguvallum. Yet is not
Talbots conclusion so sure: Talbot. Annot. in Anton. Itiner. Ms.
Porro quae hic est Voreda inter Brovonacas, and Luguvalium, illic est omissa;
and numeri aut hic aut illic sunt mendosi, and depravati. Nam cum hic sit
Luguvalio Voredam, XIV. and Voreda Brovonacas XIII. si in summam redigas,
habebis. XXVII. Quamobrem aut illic esse debet Brovo. Luguvalium XXVII. aut hic
duo particulares numeri sunt minuendi, aut certe eorum alter; sic ut simul
uniti non nisi XXV. faciant. For some miles may be gained, in not taking in a
Town by the way, but directly going on. For they usually marched not strait
forward, but wheeled about sometimes, as we see plainly; according as their
occasions required. In the V. Journey Talbot would have it read Brovo, the
syllable ca being superfluous, Debetque esse, says he, Brovo, quod est
breviatum pro integro Brovonacis Itin. II. That it was the same Station with
Brocovicus in the Notitia, our Harrison has observed after Simler; but both
are overseen in the name. But plainly it was the same Station with Bravoniacum
there, where it is also placed next to Verterae, as not only Surita, Camden,
and Pancirolus (who amiss names it Broconiacum) have observed: but even the
matter it self tells us. The very words of the Notitia are: Sub dispositione V.
Spectabilis Ducis Britanniarum Praefectus Numeri Defensorum Braboniaco. At this
day it is called Brougham in Westmerland, in which some relics of the old
name yet remain. Besides Roman Coyns here often dug up, it is taken notice
of for an ancient Camp or Castra; other Antiquities age it self has consumed.

VERTERAE. M. P. XIII.] But the emendation which Talbot brings, is XX. and that
is confirmed by two of Surita's Manuscripts in the other it is XIII. as here.
But in the fifth Journey it is XX. miles from Brovonacae to Verteris: and it is
thought the better reading, because as they say; Arist. Phys. lib.
Eadem est via Athenis Thebas, and Thebis Athenas. Verterae, it is thought,
stood not far off Ituna or Eden in Westmerland; where it joines it self with
other Streams. Now it is decayed into a small village, and its name is turned
among us into Eurgh. For our Country men call it Burgh under Stanemore; or as
our Monks name it Burgus sub Saxeto. Vegetius Veget. De via militari lib. 4.
cap. 10.
tells us that under the later Emperors, small Castles, convenient for War,
and well stored with Corn for provision, began to be called A. Gr. (...).
Burgi, and that the Burgundians had their name from living in such, Hist. lib.
7. cap. 22.
Paulus Orosiur is sufficient Author. Burgundionum qu^que novorum hostium novum
nomen, qui plusquam octoginta millia ut ferunt armatorum, ripae Rheni sluminis
insederunt. Hos, qu^ndam subacta interiore Germania a Druso and Tiberio,
adoptativis filiis Caesaris, per castrae dispositos, aiunt in magnam coaluisse
gentem, atque ita etiam nomen ex opere praesumpsisse, qui^ crebra per limitem
habitacula constituta, Burgos Vulgo vocant: eorumque esse, praeva^idam and
perniciosam manum, Galliae hodieque testes sunt: Camden does boldly assure that
this Burgh was this Verterae; both in regard of the exact distance from the
next Stations on both sides Brovoniaca, and Lavatrae, our miles being resolved
into the Italick; as also because it stands upon the High Way, whose ridge here
plainly appears. The Notitia also of the West, mentions this Station: Sub
dispositione Viri spectabilis Ducis Brittanniarum Praefectus Numeri Directorum
Verteris. The name of this Station in the Notitia had quite perished, had it
not been recovered out of this place; for before it was Veneris, Veterum,
without sense or probability of tolerable meaning. But finding it here it seems
to me to have lasted so long, till the Roman power expired in the Island.

LAVATRIS. M. P. XII^I.] The Military Port way hence tending somewhat more
S^uthernly, brings you to old Lavatris, as it is called here. So in the V.
Journey it is Levatris; yet the same distance there between Verteris and it,
exactly as is here. That which principally shows forth its Antiquity is a brave
Stone (such sure the Parson and Parish thought it, when they used it for an
Altar in their Church:) found out there inscribed to Hadrian the Emperor thus:

Imp. Caesari Divi Trajani Parthici Max. Fi^io Divi Nervae Nepoti Trajano
Hadriano Aug. Pont. Maxm. -- Cos. I -- P. P. Coh. IIII. F. -- Io. Sev.

There was another Inscription likewise taken up here, but somewhat maimed; yet
thereby it appears that I. Cohort of the Thracians resided here under the
command of one Frontinus, Neither lest they the Island so. For again under
Severus we find in the same place, that the same Cohort who are said to have
rebuilt the Bath there consumed with fire under the oversight and care of Val.

from his colors. And that judgment of the Wisest Tacitus in Agrico^ vita.
Historian concerning the more civilized Britains, and reduced to the Roman
fashion of feasting and bathing is very home and free. Vide Consultiss. Virum
Gulielmum Burtonum in Descriptione Leicestriae de quodam ibi Roman. Lavacro in
ipsa urbe inven^o. page 161.
For after that, says he, our attire grew to be in account, and the Gown much
used among the Britains: Paulatimque disc^ssum ad delinimenta vitiorum,
porti^us, and balnea, and convit iorum elegantiam idque apud imperitos
humanitas vocabatur, ^um pars servitutis esset. There is farther mention of
this Station as in the Notitia Occidentis: Sub dispositione Viri Spectabilis
Ducis Britanniarum Prafectus Numeri Exploratorum Lavatris, of whom before I
have given notice. And yet our learned Antiquary, though his mind run too much
upon the Balineum here vi ignis ex ustum, had rather deduce the name of the
Mansion from Laver, a stream that runs by very near, then a Lav^ris. However he
is confident upon good reasons, the sit distance from the next place already
spoken of, and his finding it upon the Military Way, to affirm that it is at
this day called Bows: but the reasons for the name, I had rather you should
have from him then me: and indeed, which is my rusticity, I understand not old
British or W^lsh so well.

CATARACTONI. M. P. XVI.] This Station is written so curtailed for
Cataractonium, or if you will Cataractonio. As this is the distance here from
Lavatris, so in the first Journey from Binovia it is distant XXII. M. P. of
this I have already spoken.

ISURIAM. M. P. XXIV.] The very distance in the first Journey, save that there
it is set down Isurium.

EBURACUM. M. P. XVIII.] In the first Journey it wants a Mile of this distance.
You have also there added Leg. VI. Victrix.

CALCARIA. M. P. VIIII.] It is otherwise called Cacaria. Our Antiquary places
it by In English Wherf.
Verbeia, at Tadcaster, agreeing therein with Robert Marshall, politi judicii
Viro, whom he names, as he says, honoris causa. The same before them thought
Humphrey Lhuyd: yet therein he is out, that he delivers it to be Ptolemies
(...), which is rather Antoninus his Gallacum. But the former opinion is
confirmed by the distance from York, for it is just IX. Italick Miles thence,
which is the number also here. Again the nature of the Soil, and the very
account of the Name, makes it good. For it was called Calcaria a colce, a place
well stored with Chalk. That Calcaria signified so much, there are sufficient
Authorities. Tertullian de carne Christi cap. VI. de Calcaria ad carbonariam.
Ammianus lib. XXVII. Libentius se vino proprio Calcarias extincturum, quam ad
venditurum preciis quibus sperabatur. That to these Calcariae offending persons
were condemned Vip. de poenis leg. and VIII.

Code we read of the Calcarienses. From the Calcariae therefore, or Limekills
here (as also to a place near to Marsilia in this very book, and elsewhere
also;) was this name Calcaria given, and there is no reason we should doubt of
it: for Chalk scarce any where else in this whole Tract is to be found; yet
about this Town it is still plentifully dug up, and for building conveyed to
York, and the whole Country round.

Nor want there other Arguments to prove its Antiquity, to let alone the
Situation by the Rode way, Coins of the Roman Caesar's, are often turned up,
there remains the Relics of the Fosse or Ditch, with which it was environed,
and the ruins of an old Castle, of which the Bridge was whilome made, which
when the River Wherf had past under, it mingleth its Water with the Ouse,
besides a Hill by the Town called Kelk-bar, seems yet to retain some part of
the old Name.

After Antoninus Beda Eccles. Hist. lib. 4. c. 23.
Beda also makes mention of it, out of whom take the story too, if you will,
which he relates. Heina religiosa Christi famula, qu^ prima foeminarum fertur
in provincia Nordanbumbrorum propositum vestemque sanctimoniablilis babitus
consecrante Aidano Episcopo suscepisse, secessit ad civitatem Calcariam, quae
agente Anglorum Calca-cester appellatur, ibique mansionem sibi instituit.

CAMBODUNO. M. P. XX.] Besides Antoninus you shall find mention also of this
Mansion in our Beda. Paulinus, says he, in provincia Deirorum, baptizabat in
fluvio Sualva qui vicum juxta Cataractam praeterfluit. Non enim Oratoria vel
Baptisteria in ipso exordi^ nascentis Ecclesiae poterant aedificari. Attamen in
Campo Dono (ubi nunc etiam villa Regia erat) fecit Basilicam, quam postmodum
pagani, a quibus Edwinus Rex occisus est, cum tota eadem villa succenderunt.
But he writes it with a P. in the second syllable, as Strabo writes (...),
which Munster renders Campidona, that City of Vindelicia which in ptolemy is
called (...): moreover Beda divides the word Campo-dona, whence it is that of
old K. Alfred. (...), who translated his Ecclesiastical History into the Saxon
or old English language above DCCC. years agone, renders it Dona-^eloa;
although it was written in the Manuscript Copy of Beda, which was in the hands
of that excellent Divine, Doctor Samuel Ward, Professor at Cambridge,
Campadono, as we are taught by our Learned Friend Abraham Wheclocke, the
Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, and public Library keeper there.

In Ptolemy amongst the Cities of the Brigantes it is printed (...) And so
published amiss in Antoninus here.
Camulodunum, for which in the Palatine Copy you have (...); so that none now
may wonder with In Synonimia Geograph.
Ortelius whence Ferdinand. Pintianus had that reading. Which Ortelius
notwithstanding not only much thinks amiss, wherein he takes this Cambodunum
here to be the same with Pl^. Not. Hist. lib. 2. c. 7^.
Pliuies Camulodunum, which he says was distant from Mona about CC. miles: but
also that he affirms that Talbot, and a man of singular learning, as he calls
him, William Camden, did think that it was of old time called West-chester. For
Camdens part he thought long ago that the Situation of this Cambodunum was in
old time near the right hand bank of the River Calder in Yorkshire by
Almondbury, and that from the distance on oneside from Mancunium, on the other
side from Calcaria, which Antoninus himself sets down. Near this village, says
he, Cambodunum sat, upon an hill sufficiently enough steep, to which there was
no access, but upon one side only: on it were some ruins of Walls, and
manifest signs of a Camp. But Secula vicerunt, as the Martial. lib. 7. Epig.
18.
Poet says. That it was indeed seated upon an Hill the very name sufficiently
shows, for all Towns, for the most part beginning or ending in Dunum, are
placed upon Hills. For in the old Gallick Tongue, the same with our British,
Dunum signifies (...) a hill or rising piece of ground, as I have ere while
told you out of Plutarch. In the first Saxon times it flourished in great
honor, as the place before brought out of Beda sufficiently witnesses. But
whereas he writes that the Church which Paulinus built, and dedicated to Saint
Alban (whence the place was called Albanbury, at this time corrupted into
Almondbury:) was burnt by the Pagans. Camden who was an eyewitness affirms
that to this day the color of burning remains in the stones. William Fulks
Antoninus to Cambodunum had Camborough noted: of which place yet, as unknown,
we can suddenly determine nothing.

MANUCIO. M. P. XVIII.] The reading of the name of this Station is very
diverse. Manucio here. Otherwise Mammucio, Mammunccio, Mamutio, Manutio,
Mancinto, as may be seen out of Surita and others, in whom yet there is no
difference in matter of distance of the Miles: and in the X. Journey there is
another Station set before it, there is the right name of it to be found
Mancunio: of which see there. It is doubtless near Manchester in Lancashire,
which though it be said to belong to the old Brigantes, yet was not Mancunium
one of their Insignes urbes.
(...), for we miss it in Ptolemy, and we may judge it to be that which at this
day we call Mancastle, a Park near the Town belonging sometimes to the Earl of
Derby, where are to be seen antiqui propugnacul, radices quadrata forma;
although our Antiquary is unwilling to say so much because of its angustum
spacium or narrow continent. Dr. De^ the famous Interpreter of ^uclide, who
lived there communicated to our learned Antiquary what Monuments of the Roman
times remained, found there: among which one m^ns the first Qui illi fuerint,
praeter Geographos, adisis Doctissimum Vossium. lib. De Latin. Hist. page 428,
429. contra insignem errorem Aentae Sylvii aliorumque.

Mauchguid in Nin^ his Catalogue of British (...) of the recension of the
Incomparable Primord. Eccles. Brit. P. 61.
Dr. Ushur, and compared with the best Manuscripts is by him thought to be
M^unium: in case it be not rather Manduessedum in Warwickshire, or Manchester,
which he seems more inclined unto.

CONDATE. M. P. XVIII.] Congleton is a Town generally noted in Cheshire. That
it has its standing where condate, celebrated of old by Antoninus XX. miles
from Deva, had its being is unanimously agreed upon by Talhot, Camden, and
others, as we see; save that Dr. Fulk has set down to it Standish a Town it
should seem not far from thence. As for C^date there is great probability that
it was in ancient times a Colony deduced from Condate in Gallia, on the hither
side of it. It was a place famous for the Exequies of Saint Martin: for De
Transl. S. Martin. and (...). 3.
Suspicius Severus is our Author: Illum apud The city of Rhenes in Brittanny
Condatensem Dioecesis suae vicum excessisse e vita; that he dyed at Condate a
Town of his own Diocese. Ptolemy assigns the situation of it more plainly
calling it (...) in Rhedonibus, and it was by the L^geris or Loir. The
probability of it as I said will appear out of De Bello Gallico lib. 5.
Caesar: for even in his time out of that part of Gaul they translated
themselves into Britain; omnesque it is civitatum nominibus appellabantur, quibus
orti civitatibus eo pervenerunt.

I might here say something concerning the corruption of Condate into Congleton
But what is obvious to every eye I trouble not my self withal, as knowing the
truth of that saying of the old Aristid, (...). Rhet.
Orator; (...).

DEVA. LEG. XX. VICT. M P. XX.] From Condate, we pass on twenty Miles to Deva,
now Westchester, where as by Antoninus appears here, the XX Roman Legion had
its abode. So Ptolemy says also in the second of his Geography, if you mend
him first, as you must: The C^rnavii [(...)] whose Cities are, says he, (...),
((...) Deunana it is printed; and there is in him anot^ of a like name
belonging to the Texali of our Britain, but far more Northern:) (...). For
whereas the ordinary Latin Copies have Devena. Et Legio XX. they are to be
mended out of the Greek, and Antoninus, not to be expressed so as distinct
places. Dion Cassius the Consular Roman Historian in his notable recension of
the Legions from Aug^ his time to his own, has by no means omitted this
Legion, we will bring his own Dio Hist. Romans lib. 55. page 564.
words, because in them there is some obscurity, which by this means I hope may
be better cleared: (...). (...) ^rum and Victrix, in Brittannia superiori
versantes: quos ipsos, ut mihi videtur, cum ea Legione, cui nom nest ^gesimae,
ac Hiberna in superiori sunt Germania, ac non ab om^bus Vale^an (...) dicitur,
neque body idnomen retinet, ipse acceptos servavit. This place, as I said is
obscure, and by no means easily intelligible. And indeed the Translator himself
Gulielmus Xylander thought it not to be locum integrum; nor it seems Stephanus,
who came after him and reviewed what he had done. Quoid verbum referendum est?
says he: Whitherto shall we refer that verb (...). Yet though the cure seem
past our skill at present, thus much we may learn from the place. That the
Twentieth Legion was in the Upper Britain in his time; That they were in the
opinion of some called the Valeriani: but that in his judgment the Twentieth
Legion was not ever generally called Valeriana, no not to his days. The
learned Savil. lib. De Rebus Romonorum Militaribus.
Savile to whom also this place in Dio savoured of some corruption, tells us
from it (for he can mean none else:) that there were two Legions of that name
continued from Augustus I. to his time, which whether it be the meaning of the
words you see, I leave to others to judge, I am sure there are neither two
Vicessimae, or a Valeriana Legio among the old ones, that appear in a Apud
Lipsiam ad Tacitum aliosque.
Column yet remaining at Rome, or any newer recension of them. However the
Roman Antiquaries, very knowing men, of late have imposed it upon our belief,
that Io^n. Rosinus Antiquit. Romans l. 10. c. 4.
Vigesima Valeriana and Victrix in Britannia superiori versabatur, and this is
done hand over head, never minding withal the Historians words, who was bound
in a double respect, both as a learned man, and then as a Consul, not to be
ignorant of what he said Of the division of Britain into Upper and Lower here
mentioned, we have said In EBORACO.
enough before out of this same Dio, and Herodian. As for the Inscription found
among us, although I think not made use of by these Antiquaries, I will make
such answer as may be received for very good and sufficient. And thus it is, as
it was taken up at Crowdundale-waith in Westmorland.

VARONIUS -- ECTUS LEG. XX. V. V.
By this we understand, that Varronius was Praefectus of the Twentieth Legion,
which had the Titles of Victrix and Valens. For the second V. means nothing
else, as can be proved by Valerius Probus, or any other examples to be produced
from any whereelse; so that we cannot think that Valeriana is intended thereby.
Again the learned Casaub. ad Spartian. Didium Iulianum.
Casaubons judgment is of this place of Dio, that though he with others admit
of two Vicessimae Leg^ones, whereof the one had their Campin in the Upper
Germany, but was named by few, and before G^rman, Xylander leaves out (...):
yet does he not press upon us that either were called Valeriana, there being
none such, as we said, to be found any where. And therefore Camden said truly,
where he tells us that they who call the XX. Britannicam, atque Valerianam
Victricem, do falso dite^e: but that to them he adds also Valentem, that
indeed I marvel at, when as himself had the serious view of this stone.

That Chester flourished with the Honor of a Colony, if the authorities which
I have already produced were not sufficient, I could prove it by a Coin of
Septimius Geta the Son of Severus, which is in our learned Antiquary, and on
the adverse side whereof you have these Characters:

COL. DIVANA LEG. XX. VICTRIX.
But I would that other Testimonies of the antiquity and glory of the place
came from such abetters as could cause a belief in us, as well as we are
prepared to hear any thing that might enlarge its luster and fame. Such I mean
as our Monks are. Among whom William of Malmesbury deserves the principal
place: Hear the most honored Seldom ad Polyolb. Cant. XI.
Seldom in his Annotations upon the Polyolbion: You have largely in that our
most learned Antiquary, the cause of this name Caerlegion from the Tents of
Roman Legions, there, about Vespasians time. I will only note, that Leland
has long since found fault with Malms. de Gest. Ponti. l. 4.
William of Malmesbury, for affirming it so called; quod ibi Emeriti Legionum
Iulianarum resedere: whereas it is plain that Julius Caesar never came near
this Territory. Perhaps by Julius, he meant Agricola (then Lieutenant here) so
named, and then is the imputation laid on that best of the Monks, unjust: to
help it with reading Militariu^ for Iulianarum, as the printed book pretends, I
find not sufficiently warrantable, in respect that my Manuscript is very
ancient, as near Malmesbury's time as (it seems) may be, and hereto fore
belonging to the Priory of St. Augustines in Canterbury, evidently persuades
the contrary.

Now if, as it fares among good fellows, our Monks might pass their words one
for another, then would not Malmesbury want a surety and witness for what he
says of Julius Caesar's having some knowledge of Chester: it is Ranulphus
Cestre^sis, who tells you of his coin dig'd up there: Viae sunt hic
subterraneae lapideo opere mirabiliter testudineatae, triclinia concamerata,
(...) In Polychronico.
lapides praegrandes antiquorum nomina praeferentes, hic and numismata Julii
Caesaris aliorumqui illustrium inscriptione insignita quandoque sunt eff^ssa.

But they are only sit to study Arcadique Antiquities, who hold us in hand
that this Chester, by the British called Caerlegion, or Cair Lheon^ar d^ur an^
[i. e. The City of Legion upon the River Dec.] was so named from a Giant the
builder thereof, I nor they knew not who he was, or when he lived, or indeed
whether he came down out of the Moon, or no. Far more learnedly have the
Spaniards done, who enquiring for the Antiquity of that Town which gave name to
the Kingdom of Leon among them, and particularly from the Seventh Roman Legion
quartering there under the Emperor Nerva. And indeed Roger a good Monk of
Chester, being ashamed of such fabulous narrations as ascribe, and truly he
might, the origin of his City to other than Roman beginning: hear him: Intuenti
fundamenta lapidum in viis enormium videtur po^ius a Romano, sive In
Polycratico.
Giganteo labor, quam Brittannico ^udore fundata.

But in very good earnest, the most famous Cities of Europe, as is before
proved, taking their original from Roman Camps and Stations, it is most
probable, not to say sure, that Deva or Chester here had such beginning: for
that the Roman Soldiers were better builders than Giants we may be all very
confident. But at what time precisely it became so, that shall be our enquiry.
We are then to seek at what time they first arrived in the Island. We find
mention of them before in Tacitus, speaking of them in the Lower Germany, and
their boisterous behavior there: and this could not be long before their
coming hither. So he in his first Annal, in Tiberius time: Primam ac Vicessimam
Legiones Caecina Legatus in civitatem Ubiorum reduxit, turpi agmine, cum sisci
de Imperatore rapti inter signa interque aquilas veherentur. You have heard
even now that Seldom says, they were here about Vespasians time. Our great
Antiquary Camden writes, that they were conveyed hither in Galba's second
Consulship with Titus Viniu^, which being troublesome both to the Consular and
Praetorian Legates, at length received from Vespasian, Julius Agricola for
their Governor, and sat down in this City, after, as he thought, they had
lain heavy upon the necks of the Ordovices. But before this in Nero's time we
find their good service in the memorable overthrow which the valiant Suetonius
Paulinus his Propraetor gave to the numberless forces under Queen Boadicia.
Read Tacitus after her death, almost in the Tacit. Annal. lib. 14.
very next words, and before he mentions the Vexillar^i Vicessimar^i. Afterward
the same Tacitus tells us in another place, that Roscius Coelius was Legate of
the XX. Legion; a bold man, that out baffled the then Propraetor here,
Trebellius Maximus, and made him flee to Vitell^us for refuge. In Vespasians
time he was eased of his office by Julius Agricola that deserving Roman, sent
at length to take upon him the charge of all, but first of his place; of this
the same Author: Is (that is Mucianus, who had the command at Rome for
Vespasian,) missum ad dilectus agendos Agricolam, integreque ac strenue
versatum, Vicesimae Legioni Tacit in vita Agricolae.
tarde ad sacramentum transgressae praeposuit, ubi Roscius Caelius.
decessor seditiose agere narrabatur: quippe Legatis quoque consularibus nimia
ac formidolosa erat. Nec Legatus Praetorius ad cohibenoum potens, incertum suo
an militum ingenio: ita successor simul and ultor electu, rarissima moderatione
maluit videri invenisse bonos, quam fecisse.

And concerning the affairs of the Twentieth Legion, as also Deva, the
principal place of their quarters while their abode was in the Island, thus
much may serve to be spoken; being all that is to be found in Roman memories,
whether Latin or Greek.

If you please we descend to the age of Beda, a faithful Treasurer of some
Roman matters, near decayed among us; you shall find this City, when he has
occasion to mention it in his History, only called Beda lib. 2. cap. 2.
Civitas Legionum, qua a gente Anglorum Legacester; a Eritonibus autem rectius
Cairlegion appellatur. Whom the general current of our Latin Writers follows.
But our English at this day name it Westchester (sure in respect of the VI.
Legion at York, theset woe being (...), into which Severus, as Herodian. lib. 3.
Herodian tells us, disposed the whole jurisdiction of the Island in his time;)
and Chester, by reason of Excellency, as the Saxons judgment was; according to
the common verse, Cestria de Castris nomen, quasi Castria, sumpsit.
Thou Chester from a Castrd.
Camp received'st thy Name.


Now whereas Florilegus, or Matthew of Westminister, to the year DCCCCLXXXV.
says, this City, or Legacestria, was sometime Anglic^ WIRHALE dicta; as I
studied upon the cause thereof, I received satisfaction at length from the
lately most learned, and still admired Doctor. Usher, my kind and ever
honored friend, that it proceeded from a place in the Since printed by Mr.
Wheelock.
old Saxon Annals joined to Beda, not rightly understood by Florilegus: and
this it is. Hie (...) on anne werene cearone on (...) healum. (...) le^ dearene
^ehaven. But why as the same Author writes; it was also of old time named
Cynenge Cestria that indeed I am yet to inquire after.

Again I am not well satisfied in that piece of Antiquity, which we have
produced by a learned man of the former age (...). descript. (...). lib. and ex
eo nostri Chrono.
William Harrison, who me seems too confidently delivers, that Deva was builded
by the famous Roman Propraetor under Claudius Caesar, De eo Tacit. Annal. lib.
12.
P. Ostorius Scapula: for to spare other reasons, his being here was before the
XX. Legion landed in the Island: and they in all good reason seem to me the
Founders, whose Seat it was and constant abode; except occasions now and then
drew another way.

Much more do I marvel at that slip of memory, and it is a notable one, of so
great an antiquary among us, John Balaeus, who Balaeus Scrip. Brit. Cen. 1. c.
47. quem sequitur Rich. Stanihurst.
confounds the two Caerleons, that upon Usk in Wales, where the Legio 11.
Augusta bore the sway, and this here upon the D^e: whence Deva doubtlessly had
its denomination: Cities Ia. Rutgers. Var. lib. 3. c. 13.
and Rivers, as may be observed in most Countries, being found to be many times
cognomines. For truly Ptolemyes books must be mended, in which you shall find
(...) for the River here: which must indeed have been (...), or some such thing.

But Mich. Villonovanus ^lk, etc.
they are quite out too, and they are not a few, (for error gets followers
apace:) that say Deva was Doncaster, more in the North; when as by that the old
Station Danum in Antoninus is meant, far away distant, as may be seen in its
place.

The curious may know, that they owe their Original of their City from the
great Giant Leon of yore, to Henry Bradshaw some ages ago; except the Citizens
had rather own it themselves, and so be thought to be of the Giants race.

BONIUM. M. P. X] It is in some Copies, but falsely, read Bovium, and Bomium.
Talbot acknowledges this reading of the name to be righter: though he could
not divine where the place was; Harrison too mends it so and Camden approves it
in both. This without any controversy is that, which at this day we call
Banchor, or Bangor in Flintshire. There remains sufficiently express marks of
the old name still therein. And if you heed Pancirol. in Notit. Occident.
Guido Pancirolus, he will tell you, that the Numerus Bonensium, so called
hence, did reside with their Praefectus in the Island at Derventio; though I
confess the vulgar reading there is differing.

But the former conjecture is very probable: if you change the fourth vowell
into the first; then which nothing is more easy or usual. Neither can any
scruple be raised at the distance from Deva; here just ten Miles. Hear then
Renulphus Cestrens. Polychron. l. 4. c. 31.
Cestrensis. Tradunt nonnulli Pelagium fuisse Abbatem apud famosum illud
monasterium de Bangor, quod per december milliaria a Legecestria distat. Now this
Monastery Ranulpbus speaks of is by our Beda Eccles. Mist. lib. 2. cap. 2.
Beda called Bancornabyrig lingua Anglorum, in quo, says he, tantus fertur
fuisse numerus monachorum, ut cum in septem portiones esset cum praepositis
sibi rectoribus monasterium divisum, nulla harum portio minus quam trecentos
homines haberet, qui omnes de labor manuum suarum vivere solebant. An example
which these times abhor to imitate; though these good souls I believe followed
therein no worse, then 1 Cor. 4. 12. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 8.
Saint Paul's own practice. But certainly these were such foolish Monks, as in
the Island Capraria by Italy, the Heathen Rutil. Numatian. Itin. l. 1.
Poet pleasantly lets fly at. Squallet lucifugis insula plena viris.
Ipsi se Monachos Graio cognomine dicunt,

Quisquam sponte miser, ne miser esse queat?
Quaenam perversi rabies tam stulta cerebri,

Least any might their customs know,
They fear what Fortune does bestow

who fearing storms, a Halcion calm rejects.


See the rest in him. For this is no place for them, as neither for those of
Egypt, men of most strict severity, and outgoing the Essens rigidness among
the Jews. Leland, and Camden, agree in deducing the Monasteries name in Beda
from Bonium, Chorus, and Burgis, as if it signified Burgum Chori Bonii, yet
Leland has a fetch beyond him, making the syllable Ban in that word to
signify a high noted place, easy to be seen. Now it lies all wast, and is at
best but arable Land: but the fame of the place is not with all decayed. For
Ranulphus of Chester, as you see, beside others, say Pelagius, that Arch
Heritique, was Abbot here. Truly that he was a Britain, August. Ep. 106.
St. Augustine, Prosp. in Chronico, and de Ingratis cap. 1.
Prosper Aquitanus, Oros Apologet. De arbitrii liberate contra Pelag.
Paulus Orosius, who lived in the same age with him, do affirm. This is that
Pelagius, who under Honorius and Arcadius, about the year CCCC. Beda Eccles.
Hist. lib. 1. cap. 2.

Rabbis themselves let him not escape their censure for one speaking of him,
uses this expression: (...) They make him to have but one eye, and say at home
he was called Morgan, which indeed in old British signifies Merigenam, or
pelago ortum, that is Pelagius.

That Gildas, the most ancient of our British Writers, was an inhabitant of
this place, I could easily believe, says John Leland. But it is certain out of
Beda Eccles. Hist. lib. 2. ca. 2.
Beda, that Dionothus was the Abbat there, and sent for to meet Augustine that
sanguinary Monk, and Pseudo-Apostle, at the Synod which he called here in the
Island. See the whole story in Beda.

The ancient magnificence of the place, the store of ruins in former ages
enough witness. To which let us take Malmesburies words: Tot enim superfuerant
hic antiquitatis indicia, tot semiruti parietes, tot anfractus portarum, tanta
turba ruderum, quantum vix alibi cernas. Yet has it nothing left of its wonted
luster, but the bare names of two Gates, distant the one from the other some
half a Mile; that more North, called Port-Hogan; that on the South Port-Clais.
In the mid-place between, the River Dee runs along; the old buildings being
wholly ruined, and corn fields now only seen in their rooms. Harris. descr.
Brit. lib. 1. cap. 14. ex Leland.
William Harrison, and Leland relate, that the ploughmen usually find, as they
are at Work, Monks bones, and vestures (much they should ly so long in the
earth:) squared stones, and Roman Coin.

But by no means may we let pass that (...) of Malmesbury, which through
heedlessnesse has happened in his Malmesb in Hist. and lib. 4. de Pontisic.
writings, making this Monastery the same with the Episcopal Seat which was
sometime at Bangor in Caernarvonshire: and so follows a vulgar error: when as
this latter was like a Colony drawn out of the former. But see that nobile par
eruditorum, Seldom upon the Polyolbion Cant. XI. and Usher in his Antiquities
of the British Church, cap. VIII. Holyoke, as elsewhere also, following the
vulgar mistake, has Bomium. But the prodigious carelessness in publishing such
kind of Authors is a business deserves the public Magistrates inspection, and
severity withal, (if it be only the Printers fault:) rather than mine.

MEDIOLANUM. M. P. XX.] This very Station is also mentioned in Ptolemies Ptol.
Geogr. lib. 2.
Geography, called by him (...) Mediolanium; whence there is great light to
Antoninus in the finding out, where this place was situate of old: for Ptolemy
makes it belong to a people in Britain, whom he names (...), or Ordovices, ad
extremum Occidentis: spoken of by Tacit. Annal. 12. and vita Agricolae.
Tacitus too, in more than one place: And in the way or journey, which passes
through their Territories, we meet with it in Antoninus. The learned Powel in
Giraldi Cambrens. Itinerar. Cambriae lib. 2. cap. 4.
David Powel of Wales, following some others judgment, as well as his own,
will have it to have been Ma^rafal in Montgomery shire: Ma^rafal, says he,
quod praecipuum erat totius Provinciae palatium. Hic Mediolanum (quod
Ptolemaeus and Ethicus, ad Occidentem per Ordovices posuerunt:) olim fuisse
nonnulli affirmant. Extant ibidem adhuc (praeter constantem incolarum
asseverationem (...) parentibus ad posteros transmissam:) quamplurima
venerandae antiquitatis monumenta, quae urbis ejusdem vestigia maniseste
indicant. Here take wenotice, that by Powel, for Antoninus, the name of
Aethicus is set down, (a thing whereof we have spoken enough in the beginning
of this work:) And whereas, by our Historians we learn that the Princes of
Powis land had their Palace here, we the rather incline to believe that this
was sometime Mediolanum; because in the perusal of Beda up and down, we see
that British, as well as Saxon Princes, had their Palaces, where formerly Roman
Stations had their situation and being.

But our great Antiquary goes a little farther, and out of the strait way, in
respect of the number of miles in the journey, though not of the Itineraria
ratio; often before observed in this work; to Lan-vethlin, a market Town not
full three miles off, in the same shire; for Methlin, by a peculiar Idietism of
the British tongue: whereby also they say Caer-Verden, for Vrbs Maridunum. Ptol.
Caer-Merden; Ar-von, for Supra, sive ad Monam insulam.
Ar-mon; Lhan-Vary, Fanum Mariae Ad Humsr. Lhuyd. in Breviario de Rebus Britann.
for Lhan-Mary, and the like. And this cognation in the name, coming as near
to Mediolanum, as either Millano in Italy; Le Million in Xan^ign in France; or
Methlen in the Low* Countries; he thinks it sufficient to strengthen his
conjecture; modestly leaving the censure touching the truth of the whole, to
the judicious Reader.

Mediolanum in Italy, as the T. Livius lib. 5. Polybius, Strabo, etc.
Roman Historians affirm, was a Plantation of the Gauls; but how later ages
came to give the original of the name from an Hog found there in the
foundations, whose skin bare half wool, I am nothing at all solicitous. And I
should not be troubled with Claudian's saying it, where he calls Millain.

The never sufficiently praised Usher out of Ninnius apud Vsserium de Primord.
Eccles. Britann.
Ninnius Collection of the ancient British Cities, restored by him out of the
several Manuscripts, lets us know, that this Mediolanum in Ptolemy and
Antoninus, was sometimes called by the old Britains Cair Meguaid, aliter
Metguod; or as commonly Meivod in Montgomeryshire. As for other Antiquaries of
the inferior bench; who swallow all without chewing, it will be enough to name
them; for they need not much confutation; such are Cooper, who to Mediolanum
sets down Manchester; as also Lhuyd, and Nevil with Fulk; who both follow him,
and with as little heed and judgment note to it Lancaster.

RUTUNIUM. M, P. XII.] There are the Ruins of a very ancient Castle, lying on
the Western side of Shropshire, and not far from the Seaverne, called at this
day Rowton. In the Romans time, when it flourished, says our Antiquary, it was
named Rutunium by Antoninus, nec in hoc falsi esse possumus, says he; (you see
how confident he is:) seeing both the name and distance which he sets down from
Uriconium, a generally known Station, does most exactly agree. I have no more
then to say of it, but that the diverse reading of the old name [Rutimio] which
is found in the Quo usus Hier. Surita, doctiss. Hispanus.
Neopolitan Manuscript, is as much as comes to nothing, and that the ordinary
or common one is to be acknowledged and followed.

So that now whereas consuming Time has wrought all its other usual despites
upon it, according to that of the Poet: Aevum cuncta rapit, furtivaque tempora
mutant;
Naturam, sortem, nominaque and faciem.
Age and incroaching time makes all things strange,
And does their natures, names, and faces change.


Yet does its Name still survive, a happiness which but with a few other
Stations, this can yet boast of: But let it have been as great as it will,
there only remains now the shadow of a Name. And there will be a time, when
that too shall expire: however; if that be any comfort, it will be the last
thing left.

URIOCONIUM M. P. XI.] Me thinks they do not amiss, who mend the name of this
place in Antoninus in this Journey out of Ptolemy, and read it Viroconium. For
so indeed he: (...); Viroconium: making it the second of the two chief Cities
of the (...) or Cornavsi: and so indeed it is printed in the XXII Journey of
the same Antoninus in Aldus edition; though in that of Simler it be somewhat
faulty Viriconium. And the written books which Surita made use of do maintain
as much. This City, none of the meanest in old time, as appears by Ptolemy,
near four miles on this side Shrewsbury, stood by the hither side of Seavern;
even where the river Tearn exposes it self into it. In Ninnius you find it is
named Caer Vrach; which though it come near enough, it differs yet from Usher's
Ninnius, to the which you have that rich Magazine of human, as well as divine,
learning noting this: Caer Urnach quae Camdeno, Uriconium Autonini, Viroconium
Ptolemei, and Salopiensium Wroxceter suisse creditur. And in another place:
Cair Guricon, vel Guorichon quae vel Warwicum est; vel Ptolemei Uriconium.
Wroxceter in Salopiensi Comitatu. But his other conjecture perhaps will hold
best. In the Anglo-Saxon time it was (...). from whence our Wroxceter at this
day comes; nearer, me seems, in sound to the old Roman Name, as who would say,
Uriconii Castra, vel Urbs.

It was an usual piece of Policy among the Romans, and that frequently beyond
Sea observed, as upon the Rhene, and other Rivers, as well as in Britain, to
fortify the banks of Rivers that were inmost to them, and to place garrisons
for better fence upon them, as here, where most danger of the irruption of the
enemy was; the water not being more easily fordable then here even to the mouth
of the Seavern, what ever of Magnificence it had, the hostile Saxon in the
Island left untouched, that the furious and savage Dane quite harrased, and
laid waste: so that now it is but a small village, having nothing that remains
of that state it enjoyed in former ages save some disorderly ruins of Walls,
which the by-inhabitants call, The old Work of Wrockcester. And although I my
self have formerly viewed the place, yet it is so long ago, before I intended
any such work as I am now about, and observed nothing then besides the sight of
a few Urnes lately taken out of the ground, which have not already been taken
notice of, and set down by Cambden our learned Antiquary, I will save my self
the labor and give you all out of his words. That which he speaks concerning
the Roman Emperors Coins found here by the Plough, is very true, for I my self
have had diverse presented to me while I was there, so long after. For the Ruins
of the Walls yet remaining, he says they were, e lapide structili septemplici
Britannicorum ordine exterius distincta, interius arcuato opere extructa
fuerunt. Where all this appears, he conceives was a Castle, or Fortress by the
unevenness of the ground, and raising thereof; as also by the rubbish and decay
of the Walls there to be seen. The place where sometime the City stood, and
that too spacious enough, has the ground blacker than elsewhere, where most
excellent Barley comes up plentifully. And here I could not, but remember, what
I have sometime read of Pomponius Laetus, the great Roman Antiquary, who when
he saw any part of the ruins of the CITY dug up, he would strait fall a
Ralph. Volaterranus.
Weeping, and being asked why; he used to answer, Admonitu meliorum temporum
ploro. But to speak seriously, we have reason to rejoice, that we by the Divine
Providence are cast upon this present Age, had we but the wit to make right use
of so many golden opportunities, and advantages. About this Station did the
famous Roman Way, commonly known by the name of Watling-street, pass either by
foard or by bridge not far off: but the ridge appears not any where to be seen;
the foundation yet, as they say, being detected by laying a Weere in the Water.
However express relics of the ancient name, are yet left in the near
adjoining Mount, which some call Gilberts, commonly called Wrcken-Hill, quasi
Uroconii Mons; of extraordinary height, if you think of meaner hills; and a
notable Landmark to the whole Country round about.

And now having said all I have to say concerning Uroconium, Longnor, being
upon the Seavern a little higher between it and Shrewsbury, the dwelling and
House of my near and very good Kinsman Francis Burton, Elquire, I shall beg
leave of the not fastidious Reader, to remember a piece of Antiquity, not, it
is very true, of any remote time, and so less suitable to the rest here, but
yet touching our own Family: and here I could not moderate my self from setting
it down: and some perhaps will say I did well in it.

The Burtons were of Shropshire, a family sometime, for no ordinary relations,
not to be mentioned in this place, very gracious with the several Princes of
the Royal House of York; and we have yet some memories that Sir Edward Burton
Knight served that side in fourteen set Battles. From him line^y descended
Edward Burton Esquire, a Religious Assertor of the Gospel in Q. Mary's time,
and by the Author of the Acts and Monuments of the Church of England named
among those that escaped the Persecution then for that cause. But the whole
story is this: He was a man indeed, who by many ways and courses he took for
his safety (too long to be told here:) and to evade the hands of such as lay in
wait for him: When one day sitting alone in his upper parlour at Longnor, in
meditation no doubt of Gods deliverance of his people; he heard a general Ring
of all the Bells in Shrewsbury, whereunto in St. Ceadda's Parish his house
belonged, when strait his right-divining soul told him, it was for Q. Mary's
death, yet longing to know the truth more certainly, and loath to trust his
Servants therein for some reasons, he sent his Eldest Son, my Grandfather,
being then but a boy of sixteen years of age, willing him to throw up his hat,
if it were so, so impatient was his expection: Who finding it, and doing
accordingly as he was directed, the good man retiring presently from the
window, and recovering his Chair, for extremity of joy which he conceived, for
the deliverance of the Saints of God, he suddenly expired. And this was his
Nunc dimittis, Domine. But neither was the storm of persecution so quite blown
over hereby, but that still some scatterings did fall upon the Servants of God,
for they suffered some grievances still, among which was their being debarred
from Christian interment in Churches. But facilis jactura sepulcri: His friends
made a shift to bury him in his Gardens by the Fishponds, and set a Monument
over him, which being defaced by time and rain, it happened in the year. DC.
XIV. that Edward Burton Esquire his Grandson, inviting to Dinner the noble Sir
Andrew Corbet, then Lieutenant of the Shire, with diverse other Gentlemen of
quality; that the good Baronet, desirous to see the place which preserved the
relics and memory of that excellent man: as good men are still inquisitive
after them, whose virtues they honor: but finding it much decayed by the
weather, after a friendly correption of his Host, and serious injoynment to
repair the Tomb, whereby the memory of his most deserving Grandfather was kept
alive; he without any ado, effected what he spoke for, and promised himself to
become the Poet for an Epitaph. And this is it which follows, turned also into
Latin verse: but ex Anglicanis bonis, Latina non item bona.

Haec mihi non vani (nec erat cur fallere vellent:) Narravere Senes. -- Here
lies the body of Edward Burton Esquire who deceased Anno Domini 1558. Was It
for denying Christ, or some notorious fact,
That this man's body Christian burial lackt?
O no: his faithful true profession,

When Pop'ry here did reign, the Sea of Rome
Would not admit to any such a Tomb.

And now have we done with Wrokcester, and Long^or, the former whereof, I have
finished as part of my task undertaken: what I have said concerning the other,
the great respect I had of my worthy Progenitors memory would not let me omit.
And I might also take my leave of Shropshire, but that Usocona, an old Station
in Antoninus, and thought sometimes to have been near the limits thereof, makes
me some short stay.

USOCONA M. P. XI.] Not very far from the foot of the Wrekin, in somewhat a low
bottom, stands a small village, called Oken-Yate, not famous at this Day for
any thing, except it be for the much frequented Coal-pits. Of old time that it
was Usocona, (written also according to the variety of copies Usoccona, and
Uxacona:) a Roman Station mentioned here in Antoninus, is the conjecture of our
great Antiquary, for these reasons: First, that it is by the Military, or
ancient Roman Highway; an infallible sign in his judgemeut, especially if there
accompany it any proportionable distance; which he next observes. The
equidistance between Wroxcester, and this village on the o^e side, and
Pencridge on the other, agreeing with that in the Ininerary exactly confirms
it; so that he concludes it with that peremptoriness, that there is no cause,
says he, our quisquam dubitet. He adds then, nec abnuit ipsum nomen, deducing
it, as his manner is, from the old British; the ignorance of which I have more
then once in this Work openly professed. Nam haec dictio Y S, says he,
Britannis inferius notat: and is, it seems, added to notify the Low situation.
And though the Language of the ancient Britains endured not an X. as is
somewhere else taken notice of, yet the reading of the Name so [Uxacona] among
the Romans, it being frequent in old books, is thereby nothing hindered at all.

PENNOCRUCIUM M. P. XII.] The diverse readings in Surita. Annot. in Anton.
Surita, are not worth the heeding. Talbot first of all assigned it to
Pencridge in Staffordshire, where is the notable Horse-^air. Both names, as
well that which was in use in the Romans time, as that which is at this day,
seem to be derived from the River there, named Penck; by a stone bridge over
which, the Military way; which being there parted asunder, is in a manner
thereby joined again. The distance of Miles in Antoninus, from Uxacona also,
does very handsomely suit.

ETOCETUM. M. P. XII.] The diverse readings of the Name are to be taken notice
of; for besides that set down, you have in some old Copies Etoretum, in others
Erocetum: But we follow the most common. The learned Antiquary Camden
confesses he was out in his conjecture, in the (...) of his great Work,
entitled BRITANNIA; conceiving it to have Or former Edition.
been U^exeter or U^r: which is also the mistake of William Fulk in his time.
Yet I dare say boldly, they two conferred not notes: The error I am persuaded
was the sooner entertained, because of some light consonancy in the Names, as
if the late one had signified as much as Etoceti Urbs. But he upon farther
Enquiry, and second thoughts, is confident he has found it, there being the
karcass of an old City, as he saics, lying by the ancient Roman Highway,
distant from Lichfield, which is South of it, scarce a whole mile. At this day
it is called the Wall in Staffordshire, from the ruins of Walls, there yet to
be seen, and which at this day enclose some two acres of ground, which they
call Castlecroft, as it were Castri Campum. To this the inhabitants of the
place, by constant tradition, say, an old City was joined, standing on the
other side of the way, guessing by the rubbish in such store, the place where a
Church sometime stood, and which is the best proof of Antiquity, they produce
to show the Caesar's coins found here. So that to borrow Tacit. de Morib.
German.
Tacitus words: Veteris famae latae vestigia manent, spatiumque cujus ambitu
nunc quoque metiaris molem. Or if you had rather take that of Vel. Pater. Hist.
lib. 1.
Veleius Paterculus the Court-Historian concerning the very old City Cumae:
Vires veteris ejus Urbis hodieque magni. udo ostentat moenium. The distance
from Manduessedum in the Itinerary suits well with the places now; and what
ought to move also; the old Highway, with a fair, visible, and continued ridge
comes from the Pen^ks bank, even hitherto.

MANDUESSEDUM. M. P. XVI.] Manduessedum was sometime a famous Roman Mansion, as
appears by Antoninus. To find out the place where of old it stood, among our
many Antiquaries, is not worth the while, for even Talbot confesses, and so
must they, that he can neither divine nor devise, whereabout it should be, and
yet he tells us that Man^field in Sh^wood comes the nearest. The difficulty in
discovering it proceeds, I conceive, from not following a certain course for
the finding it out: next the uncertainty of distance: Talbot telling us that
the book he used having XVI. M. P that the notes in the end would have it
mended VI. the contrary of which was in the Longo^an Manuscripts, in which as
Surita witnesses, was to be found M. P. VI. and XVI. corrigitur. Our very
learned Antiquary Camden taking a sure course in these parts along
Watlingstreet, has light uponit most luckily, at a proportionable distance
from Etocetum, and thereby has he found it, not far from the River Anchor,
where it is laid over with a stone bridge: Neither is the English Name at this
day so totally dissonant from the old one, but that it still retains some part
of it: for it is called Mancester; in which what the addition of chester
betokens, you have formerly had notice given you. In Ninnius his Catalogue of
our old Cities, it is named Mauncega^d; and the all-knowing Usher agrees to all
that is said here, only as he was more plentifully accomodated with Copies of
Ninnius, he produces more varieties of reading Cair Maunguid alias Mauchgnid;
which whether at all material, our friends the old Britains have most reason to
know best. Now whereas there is a Quarry of stones here by, whence they have
supplied their need formerly cutting thence; and seeing we are informed by the
Glossaries of the British Language, that as Main is a Stone; so Fosswad in the
Provincial speech, has the signification of digging: from which two words
joined together, as they may easily produce Manduessedum; so do they to the
life express the Nature of the place. The other course I was thinking on to
find out the meaning of Manduessedum, was to learn if possible I might meet
with any one who could tell me, what that sedum might signify, as I had seen
the terminations of other Stations made significative: for example, dunum,
durus, briga, magus, and diverse others. The studious youth may think of it, as
besides this here, M^iosedum Casar de Bello Get. comment. 7.
in Caesar, and elsewhere more. For my part I surcease all farther enquiry,
except I were better furnished with helps and means wherewithal to effect it.
And whosoever shall attempt it, let him always have this in his mind, that
the old Gallique tongue, and the British were the very same. How great soever
it was in old time, I know not; now it makes show of nothing ancient, praeter
antiquam molem, says Camden, which they call Aldbury, and is as much as
Antiquus Burgus. The Town consists not of above fourteen houses, Atherstone, a
Market Town on one side, and Nonmeatus on the other side, having, in a manner,
exhausted it.

VENNONIS. M. P. XII.] alias Bennonis; for so it is other wise called. Take
therefore what is to be said concerning this Station from an eyewitness
thereof after Camden, the diligent and judicious William Burton Esquire, in the
LXXII. page of his Description of that Shire.

Cleybroke, in the Hundred of Guthlakeston, standing upon the edge of
Warwickshire near Watlingstreet. Near unto this Town (many ages since) stood a
great Roman City (out of the ruins whereof this might seem to spring) of the
station called Bennones, but by the Saxons after called Claycester, through
which went the great street way called Watlingstreet; for on both sides of the
Way, have been plowed and dug up many ancient Roman Coyns, great square
stones and bricks, and other rubbish of that ancient Roman building: not far
from a Beacon, standing upon the way now called High Cross, of a cross which
there stood sometimes, upon the cross meeting of another Fossway; una quoque ex
samosis Brit. Vii^ Adisis Camdenum in Cori^an. page 386. Ibi bideiur (ad
Bennones scilicet:) fuisse diver^culum ut a Londino Eboracum prosecturus, si

(Leicester) si^ per Devam (Chester) ire decrevisses, ad sinistram opor^et
declinare Manduessedum. Rob. Talbot. Annot. in Antoninum.
Great way. Many of these coins here found have been delivered to me, of which
I will only set down two, the one the antientest, the other the latest; though
that the rest (being well viewed) might give light perhaps to some other
passages; for as that excellent Grecian Agel. noct. A^c. l. 1. c. 1,
Geometrician, that finding the length of Hercules foot upon the sand of the
Hill Olympus, drew all the lineaments of his whole body, by the proportion of
that one only part: So by the learned and judicious, out of the observances of
these small Coyns, Inscriptions, and such other Relics, may be found the
Antiquity, continuance, greatness, and other circumstances of this ancient
City, now utterly perished and extinct.

The first and antientest of these Coyns here found is of the Emperor Caius
Caligula in Copper, stamped as Occo sets down, An. Dom. 42. upon the one
side the Emperor with a Laurel wreath, with this Inscription, viz.

C. CAESAR. DIVI. AUG. PRON. AUG. P. M. T. R. P. IIII. PP. Upon the reverse:

VESTA. S. C. Vesta sitting in a chair, holding in her right hand a dish.

The other Coin is of Constantine the Great, Emperor, in Copper, stamped An.
Dom. 306. upon the one side, the face with a Laurel wreath, circumscribed, viz.

CONSTANTINUS. P. F. AUG. Upon the reverse:

SOLI INVICTO COMITI. T. F. P. R. The figure of the Sun.

The Roman Emperors (as Marguard Frehere in his Diatribe upon a piece of Coin
of Constantine Palaeologus, the last Emperor of Constantinople well observes:)
were very careful in the graving and stamping of their Coins, holding it no
small luster and ornament to their Majesty's, to have their devices neatly cut,
and their faces made to the life, which was performed with that exquisite Art,
that though many of them (of several sorts) were mingled together; yet by a
judicious beholders view of the favor and Physiognomy, without reading the
inscription, they might very easily be distinguished: which curious observance
of theirs continued from the time of Julius Caesar, until about the reign of
Constantine the Great; at which time it began to decline, and was not revived
again, until many hundred years after. Of these Coins many have written, as
Levinu^, Hulsius, Abraham Gorleus, Aeneas Vicus; but chiefly Adolfus Occo, a
Physician of Ausp^rge in Germany, who has set down the Inscriptions of them,
and in words has described the devises. Others have caused the Coyns to be
cut, and printed, as near to the medagle it self as they could; as namely
Erizzo an Italian, Jacobus a Bre, from Julius Caesar to Valentinian, printed
1611. but more general and curious are Hubert (...), whose large Thesaurus of
them, in several Tomes, show his industry and genius therein. And Octavius de
Strada, a Rosberg Courtier, and Antiquary in Ordinary to the last Rodolf,
Emperor, who from Julius Caesar has written briefly the Lives and genealogies
and set down the Coyns and medaglies of all the Emperors, both of the East and
west, unto Matthias the Emperor, curiously cut in Copper, and printed 1615.

Of the Roman Inscriptions have written M^us Vels^r, Johannes Gruter, Martin
Smetius, Justus Lipsius in large Volumes, and John Boissard in six Volumes,
with the Prints in Copper, printed 1600. And for our own Country, the right
worthy, judicious and nobly descended Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and Baronet,
has collected together so many as hitherto have been found or discovered in
this land.

BENNAVENNA. M. P. XII.] It is read here also, according to the variety of
Copies Bennaventa, or Benneventa: see Surita. You have it twice again repeated
in this Itinerary, but with much interpolation of the name. For in the VI.
Journey from London to Lincoln, you have Isannovantia; for it is that very same
Station. And in the VIII you have it called Bannavantum in that from London to
York; thence also you must mend the number here says, Talbot, and make it XIX.
see the reasons thereof in him on those two places following.

That Northampton stood where this sometime had its being, John Lel^nd, a
painful Interpreter of our British affairs, and Walliam ^ulk also thought:
whose opinion Camden at first thought good of; but upon second cares and more
diligent observation of the place, he sets it VI. miles thence, where now Wedon
on the street is: so called because it stands upon that Praetorian Way which
the Romans built, and along which Antoninus deseribes his Stations. Moreover
this is confirmed by the exact account or tale of Miles to the Mansions on both
sides, an undoubted argument: Not to make that one, says our Antiquary, that
the springs of Avon hard by here seen, and are, be concluded in the composition
of the name Bennavenna. As for the first part of it, I know not what to say to
it. Perhaps some bold Britain would have added Pen, for which yet you see Ben:
because we say in Latin, as well as in English, Caput fluminis. You know
formerly that I am not skilled in, and less taken in such deductions of names.
Therefore though I could tell you that Benna in the Gallique Language, and
consequently in the British, did signify as much as Sex. Pomp. Fest. de
signif. verborum.
Vehi^ulum, yet doubting I should not please the best therein, any more then if
I should say this B^neventa was a Colony deduced from Beneventum in Italy; I
forbear both; the first, because I have no cause or reason for it: the second,
because I have no authority, or sufficient warrant to make it good; neither is
it likely I should. This though an ancient City has not much to set forth its
memory, or which can assert it much from the injury of oblivion, but the very
name only thrice mentioned in this Itinerary. Yet if our conjecture has any
verisimilitude, those Camps and muniments were near upon this ground, wherewith
P. Ostor^us Scapula the Propraetor here, under Claudius, Antonam fluvium,
finxit quibusque Petilius Cerealis defensus est ^um a victore Britanno fusa
Legione nona, and quod erat pedi^um interfecto, huc ^um equitibus evasisset.

When the Roman power in the Island was come over and gone, K. Wolpher had his
palace here; the miracles of whose daughter Werburg a virgin, are much
celebrated by our Writers. Which I take notice of, not so much that I am taken
with such relations, as to bring in an observation, that the Roman Stations
here became afterward the dwelling of the Saxon Princes. And this is not the
first place where that has been done.

LACTODORO M. P. XII.] Our Antiquary had rather read it Lactorodum, as it is in
the written books. Ort^lius has it both ways by U. Lactorudum: the Neapolitan
Manuscript, had it Lactodrodo M. P. XII. as the rest have it. In the VI.
Journey it is constantly read Lactodorum: see there. To the name says Robert
Talbot, alldunt Lutt^rworth and L^ughborow. But the distance from other
Mansions here, will by no means suffer it. Though some Folk would have it to be
the latter, yet, he mends it for Bedford as does Camden also set it down so; in
his (...) of his excellent Work. But it could not be Bedford, for that stands
not upon the military Highway, which is certissimus index ad stationes and
mansiones ab Antonino memoratas reperiendas, nor has it any token else of
Roman Antiquity. Although sometime he thought it to be so by reading it
Lectodorum, and deducing it from Lettui, that is in British, diversoria, Inne^;
and dur aqu^; as if the name had been Lett^dur, or Diversoria ad aquam. De
Lactorate adi Joseph. Scalig. in (...) l. 2 cap. 7. Epist. item 406. lib. qua^s.
Lact^rate the old Town in Gaul differs as you see in the termination only:
perhaps this may have had some relation, or dependence thereupon, like others
in Britain. See CONDATE in this same Journey. But in his last edition thereof;
he takes it rather to be Stony-Stratford. The proportionable distance persuaded
him to it. And its standing upon the famous Strata, thoroughfare, or street, as
it does: he concludes all, in giving the signification of both names together,
which are suitable and alike: for he lets us know that in the old British
tongue Stones are called Leach: now you were acquainted but now that it stands
upon the Watlingstreet; and ryd, signifies a ford: So you have, he being the
interpreter, Lactodorum, i. e. Stony-stratford.

MAGIO VINIO M. P. XVI.] Commonly XII. in the public Books. You have this
Station twice again in this Itinerarv, the VI. and VIII. Journeyes. There we
will speak of the diverse readings of the names, and look to the numbers of
Miles. We find Magioninium, Migiovinium, Magiovintum, Magintum. But the first
seems most likely to be the right. Dunstable is a Town well known upon the
rode, standing upon the Chiltern in Bedfordshire, every body knows it. That
this was so many ages ago named Magiovintum, our Antiquary is so confident, as
nothing can be more. For besides its standing upon the Military Roman-way, the
Caesar's Coyns are usually found by the Swineheards, says he, in the fields
about, which they to this day call Ma^ning Money, reserving still some
relics, though corrupt, of the ancient name. And hard by at the very descent
of the Chiltern Hills, there is a Military Fence for the space of IX. acres
made round, such as De bello Gal. lib. 5.

Strabo, describe the Britains Towns to be commonly called Mading-bower, and
Madinbour by the By-dwellers: in quo nomine, they are the words of that learned

ruined by time, or otherwise Ex historia privata Dunstole, apud Camdenum in

King Henry I. repaired the Town, rooting out thence Dun, and his fellow
robbers. He had his residence there sometime himself. By this you know the
original of the name of Dunstable. But in his (...), or former edition, he puts
down Ashwel in Hertfordshire for it.

DUROCOBRIVAE M. P. XII.] This station is repeated twice again in what follows,
alike in all, save that in the VI. and IIX. Journeys it is corrupted into
Du^ocobrius. Our former Antiquaries are foully out, setting down to this
Dunstable, Stony-Stratford, etc. all which we have already past. But our
Antiquary with better judgment places it at or about Redb^urne, which if
interpreted is as much says he, as aqua rubra, although the water that runs by
it is no redder than that of the Vide Agath^. de Mari Rubra.
Red Sea. The place, they say, is famous for the Relics of Amphibalus, as
formerly for his Martyrdom. The story is in Beda Eccl. Hist. Angl^r. lib. 1.
cap. 7.
Beda, thus: Alban as yet a Pagan, when as the commands of cruel Princes raged
against the Christians, gave entertainment to a certain Clerk running away from
the pursuers. Whom when he saw day and night employed in continual praying and
watching; suddenly being visited by the divine Grace, he began to imitate him
as an example of faith and piety; and by little and little being instructed by
his wholesome exhortations, leaving the darkness of Idolatry, he became a
Christian from his whole heart. Now when as the aforesaid Clark remained some
days with him, news came to the ears of the wicked Prince, that this Confessor
of Christ, lay lurking with Alban, having not as yet any certain place
appointed for his Martyrdom. Whence the Soldiers were commanded with more
diligence to search him out. Who coming at Albans dwelling; he presently for
his ghuest and Master, yielded himself to the Soldiers, arrayed in his very
habit, and Caracalla.

I think of this learned Clerk. We return to our old Station Durocobrivae or
Redbourne.

At this day it is taken notice of for standing upon the Watling-street, and
for the brook Weamer hard by it, which never bubbles up or rises, but against a
dearth of Corn, or hard times, as the neighbors say, and believe. Hereby stood
that ancient station Durocobrivae, though the distance seems to say no such
thing; now Redburn, for they both signify the same aquam Rubram, or Red-water.
For ancient places are most an end best discovered, either by old Inscriptions,
by the course of Journeys, by the likeness and significations of names, by
Rivers and Lakes adjoined, when otherwise the numbers and distance in the
Itinerary do not so well suit, as which may easily be corrupted, as here too
often, and the short cuts in ways quite lost. And XVI. is not so hardly made
of VII. Besides Rivers themselves dye and decay in time, as you have been
formerly told. And therefore whether it should be briva or briga rather, which
Vide Stephanum Ethnicograpbum. adi etiam Geo. Buchan. Hist. lib. 2.
Strabo says among the Gauls signified a City, at least such a one, as had in
it a water passed over with a bridge: the word in all modern languages almost
for pons coming from (...). And therefore we will take Cluverius observation
in his Geography: That Briga signifies what pons does, among the old Celtae.
And that, omnia opida per Galliam pariter ac Hispaniam and alias regiones ita
desinentia ad sluminum ripas posita sunt. Hence is it that in Caes. Com. 5. De
bell. Gall.
Caesar's several copies you read Samarobriga, and Samarobriva; as it is also
in Ptolemy (...). In Antoninus ^riva Isarae, which Simler otherwise calls Briga
Isarae, for Pontoise in France. So by this Durocobriva will be as much as Pons
seu Trajectus aqua Rubrae, i. e. The pass of the Red water, or Redbou^n.
However I cannot dissemble, but that the same great Antiquary, in his (...),
that is, the first edition of his BRITANNIA, believed it to be Hertford. His
words are: Hertfordiam semper Durocobrivas esse credidit Durioh, i. e. Rubra
aqua. H^rudford, i. e. The Redford; distantia convenit. But since he has
changed his opinion.

VERULAMIUM. MP. VII.] Had I had the Fortune, which I remember good Robert had
by the courtesy of St. Albans ghost, to be carried up and down, and acquainted
with what ever concerned the Town, Matthew. Par. A. 1178. sub H. 2. page 133. etc.
de maeniis dirutae civitatis, de amne diminuto, de strata communi adjacente
civitati. I might save my labor in turning over other men's books: but seeing
that will not be, take in good part what I have collected, and got to know, by
perusing the Writings of other men before me.

First, then take we notice of the name, which is thrice remembered in this
Itinerary, but somewhat faulty the best: Verlamio, Verulami, and Verolamo; for
Verulamio. Ptolemy also would be noted, in whom you find, but amiss (...),
making it one of the Cities of the (...) Catyeuchlani, It stood indeed near
where the famous old Town St. Albans now flourishes, which grew by its ruins;
in Caishow Hundred, which place the Cassii, mentioned by Casar. Com. 5. de
bello Gall.
Caesar, without doubt says our Antiquary sometimes possessed. Of these then,
says he, the famous Commander Cassibeltamus had his name. Among the Britain
Cities, which we have set down by Ninnius, it is called Caer-Municip. Because
it had been a Muncipium in the Romans times, as you shall hear anon: though for
it you find in Hist. lib. 1.
Huntington, Caer-Mercipit; but corruptly. And our Antiquary needed not to have
made any doubt, that this was Caer Municipium which Golizius found in old
Inscriptions. By the Sacons it was called Wenlam cester and (...), from the
Watlingstreet Way, and at this day it is still called Verulam, though thereof
nothing remains, but the ruins, to say that ever it was. Hence had the truly
Noble St. Francis Bacon his Honors, Lord Verulam Vicont S. Albans. A man, as
one says of him, Uno omni laud and invidia major; acerrimi ju^icii, (...)
ingen^i, eruditionis v^ro minime vulgaris, (...) inter mori^ura post se
r^liquit ornamenta: qui seculi sui ingenia long supergressus, cum omni
antiqu^tate certainen habuit. But what our Comes Municipii was, if our learned
Heralds cannot tell, as I fear they will be to seek, I refer them to Galfr.
Hist. Brit. lib. 2. ca. 3.
Galfridus in his British History: Comes ergo oppidi Municipii, qui ipsum prae
caeteris diligebat, praeceptis illius parere non distulit. But his followers,
because they understood not him, cared not that we should understand him, for
what means one of them by (x) Comes quidem sub municipio oppidi Matt. Westminster.
Anno.
etc.

The whole current of our Antiquaries, and those too such as would not take it
well to have their judgment slighted, thought this Verulamium, to be that
Cassi bellani opidum, which we find in Caesar comment. 5. de bello Gallico.
Caesar, speaking of his conquest of it, Syivis paludibusque munitum, quo satis
magnus hominum pecorumque numerus convenere. Oppidum autem Britanni cum sylvas
impeditas vallo atque fossa munterunt quo incursionis hostium vitandae causa
convenire consueverit. Locum reperit egregie natura atque opere munitum. I
confess I was not at first so much resolved as to think so, yet better inclined
to it, since I understood that Camden himself thought it probable: Neither have
I met with other Antiquities of it till Nero's time; seeing that the same
learned Antiquary, thought that the vallum, which now is commonly called Oister
hills, was of old in Claudius time the Castra or Camp of Tacit. Annal. 12.
P. Osterius Scapula, his Propraetor here.

But in Nero's time it met with a sad fate: The story out of Tacitus is thus:
Under Nero then, the Britains intolerably laden with weight of the Roman
government, and especially the Icens (now Norfolk and Suffolk men) provoked by
that cruel servitude into which not themselves, but the wife also, and
daughters of their King Prasutagus were, even beyond right of victory,
constrained: at length, breathing for liberty (and in a further continuance of
War, having for their General Tacit. lib. 14
Boadicia, Tacit.
Boudicia, Tacit. in Agricola.
Voadica, or (...). Dio.
Bunduica, ((...), as the Poet says, of another:) their Queen, rebelled
against their foreign Conqueror, and in Martial opposition committing a
slaughter of no less then LXXX. M. (as Dio has, although Tacitus miss CMC. of
this number:) ransackt and spoiled Maldon (then Camalodunum:) a Colony of which
in the IV. Journey; and also this Verulamium which were the two chief Towns of
the Isle; for so is Suetomus understood by learned men; if London be not meant
by one of them; his words are: Sueton. in Nerone. cap. 26.
Accessit tantis ex Principe malis clades Britannica, qua duo pr^cipua oppida
magna civium Romanorum sociorumque cade dirept^. And though no body has
questioned this: yet there want not, who make it a doubt, whether this Free
Borough Verulam, having tasted of the same miserable Fortune, which London it
self did, which Corn. Tacitus witnesses, were first or in suffering rather
last, in the order as Tacitus ranks it. For how say they, does that reason hold
good, Suetonius Pauliuus rendered as the final cause of his quitting London, by
the loss of one Town to save the whole residue, if Verul^ here were overwhelmed
after? But being it is clear for the disorder of the fact, the strife, or doubt
concerning the order of the time, may very well cease, and we may follow what
we find. But we were best take a view of Tacitus words, as corrupt as they are.
Tac^. ^nal. XIV.
Eadem clades municipio Verulamio fuit: quia barbari omissis castellis
praesid^sque militari^, quod uberri^um spoliant and deserentes intutum, laeti
praeda and aliorum insignes pet^bant. Ad Septuaginta milia civium and sociorum,
iis quae memoravi locis, occidisse constitit. Neque enim capere aut venundare,
aliudve quod belli commercium, sed caedes, patibula, ignes, cruces, ^anquam
reddituri supplicium, ac praecepta interim ultione festinabant. Nothing did
more unmask the covetous, corrupt, and in wardly most vicious intents of the
followers of Boadicia, then the injury done hereunto. For in Camalodunu^ the
main body and stock of the people were Romans, and London likewise was full of
them, which ministered some color for their merciless carriage; but why they
should deal in that manner with Verulamium, the Magistrates and communalty
whereof were Britains, no tolerable cause can be well assigned. True it is they
had the dignity and benefit to be free of Rome, but were not otherwise Roman. A
principal difference between the persons of a Colony and those of a Municipium,
this; that in a Colony they were evermore drawn out of the Corporation it self
of the people of Rome, as members before, but in the other, they were not any
part of that Imperial body till favorably received by municipial privilege
into the freedom; men generally foreign else, and but by admission capable. You
may if you please see Agellius and other Roman Writers, but if you have not
leisure, Camden alone will be enough. However in this very work have recourse
to ^boracum, for that too by Aurelius Victor is said to have been a Municipium.
The Verulamians therefore were Britains, though now they smarted as Romans; and
found their riches to be their undoing. It might be supposed (if Histories were
places for supposals:) that King Cogidunus (of whom there is already sufficient
spoken) was Lord of the Soil about, which being upon the frontier of the
revolted Trinobantes, the Town for that cause suffered mischief, in hatred and
despite of his constant friendship to his great Benefactors the Romans. And
here among many others the like, in the Tacit. de vita Agricola.
CORNELIAN Annals, the infelicity of the Text, corrupted by transcription,
breeds confusion. Nor does the Surgery of Critics so heal it, but that new
Galls and Blisters may still arise. What Tacitus would principally say is not
obscure: For he has told us; That the Britains, omitting Castles and
Garrisons, as tedious and troublesome to conquer, ranged loose about, and made
booty or havoc of that which was most of worth abroad; and although disordered
shufflings of the vulgar Text, which is, that the followers of Boadicia carried
their pillage and robberies to places of safety, (whether Woods or Boggs, or
whatsoever else) and full of gladness for their chevisance, did then come
again to fetch more, which every man will repute reasonable to suppose) yet
those Adi V. olim ^ruditiss. ac acerimi ingenii E. B. de Iceconis rebus Gestis,
quas vernacule edidit cap. 25. sect. 22.
learned masters from other conjectures; are best to be seen in their own
writings. The most judicious of them agree in this to be the sense, that
Boadicia's men sought for that which was most gainful to themselves, and
withal unsafe for the owners to defend; a people forward to Boot-hale, and
consume, but backward to the duties of War. A censure they well deserved, and
extends to all others, who propounding to themselves no laborious nor honest
means of life, long for civil confusions, that they might have what to lavish,
though but for never so short a while, and with whatsoever lasting misery to
the innocent and industrious.

But after this storm and stound, as great as it was, it flourished again, and
attained to much fame and renown. Among other things, there is a Coin, extant,
stamped here, as they say, and is most probable, having on the one side TASCIA;
on the other VER: let the learned judge when they see it: VER
obverse side of a coin TASCIA
reverse side of a coin

The learned Divine of Wales, and Antiquary too, David Powel, a man well
skilled in British memories of old time, persuaded Mr. Camden, one upon whom
you could not easily put a false die, that in their ancient Language this piece
TASCIA denoted and signified as much as Tributi d^arius, as Tastyd was
praecipuus Tributi col^ector. So that this Coin meant as much as the Tribute
money of Verulaminum; Now whereas many will have these Coyns antienter than the
Romans coming in hither, the learned Antiquary will not hear of it: Money
indeed from all Antiquity was tributurary here, and abroad, either by the poll,
or quantity of Land: but before them to whom should the Britains pay tribute?
And yet they had money: ask Caesar else, speaking of their money.

The reading of late, whether from Scaliger or Lipsius, it matters not which,
has taleis ferreis, for annulis ferreis: However our Speed makes his boasts of
having so many Iron Rings lying by him, remainders of Caesar's times. But for
this place, being as perplexed as any in Caesar, I refer you to my Britanniae
Romanorum, where we illustrate what he has concerning our affairs. There are
many interpolations, it must be confessed, both before and since Julius Celsus
his recension of him, and his times; but we do not therefore disavow and reject
with Franciscus Floridus, or Adisis Joan. Gerar. Vositum de Hist. L. lib. 1.
cap. 13.
Ludovicus Carrio, and others, those immortal Commentaries, which deserve the
^ading and memory of all ages.

But return we to Verulam^um, in which the first Letters VER, should seem
somewhat to sound honorably in the British tongue, because Cas. Com. 1. de
bello Gall.
VER-gobret was the name of a chief Magistrate among the Galls (whose language
was the same with the Britains:) and their most heroic Champion was called
Verringecorix: But this is more easy to imagine, then to prove: That it
signified the same with Mawr, is probable, if the sense of Ver, or Vawr in some
British dialect, be likewise equivalent in English as Mawr is. Great and apt
additions in these particulars.

Humphrey Lhuyd one of the learned late Antiquaries among us (I ever except
the Trium-viri:) will have it, that the petty stream that runs thereby was
denominative of the place, and Verham to have been Ver-^han; the F^e or Temple
upon the Water Werr, he supposing that to be the name thereof.

That the Thames once held its course by this Town, and that Ships of great
burden passed by, many have delivered. But the cause why some thought so, is
for that, Gildas, speaking of St. Albans martyrdom, and his miraculous passing
through the River at Verlamcester calls it iter ignotum trans Thamesis fluvii
alveum: so by collection they guest that Thames had then his first course this
Way, being thereto further moved by Anchors, and such like, here dug up.
This Conjecture has been followed by that Noble Muse thus, in the person of
Verlam. And where the Crystal Thamis wont to slide Spencer.

In Sylver Channel down along the Lee,
About whose flowery banks on either side,
A thousand Nymphs, with mirthfull jollity,
Were wont to play from all annoyance free
There now no Rivers course is to be seen,
But Moorish Fens and Marshes ever green.
There also where the winged Ships were seen,
In liquid waves, to cut their foamy way;
A thousand Fishers numbered to have been
In that wide Lake, looking for plenteous prey
Of fish, with baits which they used to betray,
Is now no Lake, nor any Fishers store,
Nor ever ship shall sail there any more.


But for this matter of the Thames, those two great Antiquaries, Leland and
Camden, have joined in judgment against it: and for the Anchors, they may be
supposed of Fish boats in large Pools which have here been, and yet are, left
Relics of their name.

Of such a great pool there, hear what an ancient Historian says: the Ruins
of Verulam are a Wall of Flints and Bricks, eaten down into the earth with age
and weather, and deep double Trenches about, which remain at this day looking
sadly with an overgrown face upon the Town of St. Alban, and yet retains the
ancient name:

Alfricus Abbas Piscinam magnam and prosundam Ecclesiae S. Albani nimis nocivam
and vicinam, quae Fishpole dicebatur, magno pretio comparavit. Erat autem Regum
piscaria, fueruntque regii ministri and piscatores molesti coenobio, and oneri
Coenobitis, Equa ille aquam aliquando derivavit, and aridam redegit.

Personating the Genius of Verlam, that ever famous Ruins of Time.
Spenser sung. I was that City which the Garland wore
Of Britains pride, delivered unto me
By Roman Victors, which is won of yore;
Though naught at all but ruins now I be,
And lie in mine own ashes, as you see:
Verlam I was; what boots it that I was,
Since now I am but weeds and wastefull grass?


As under the Romans, so in the Saxon times afterward, it endured a second
ruin, and out of its corruption, after the Abbey erected by K. Offa, was
generated that of Saint Albans; whither, in later times, most of the
stone-works and whatsoever fit for building was by the Abbots translated. So
that, Spens. Ibid.
-- Now remains no Memory
Nor any little monument to see,
By which the Traveller that fares that Way,
This once was she, may warned be to say.


And now if to this place of our English virgil, concerning the decay of
Verulamium, I bring as parallel the overthrow of Carthage, out of Jacob.
Sannazarius de partu Virgin. lib. 2.
one, who if any other, had his genius as well as house, I know no reason why
any one should be offended: for my part I am delighted in it: -- Qua devictae

So wealthy Carthage Walls did fall before,
And ruined Bulwarks on that hapless shore.
What Wars, what troubles might she boast?
She brought on Rome, and the Laurentian Coast.
Now scarce her relics, nor her name is known
Nor the uncertain ruins of that Town.
And we complain of our sad lives short date,
When Realms and Kingdoms perish by like fate.


Si quanta Romanorum numismatum copia, quot imagines ex auro, and argento
consiatae, quot vasa, quot columnae marmoreae, quot epistylia, quotque antiqui
operis miracula hic eruta fuerint, ex vulgi relatione percensore velim, omnem
fidem superaret oration! says our Antiquary. But he thinks Verulamiuns, was
equally famous for nothing, as for that in Dioclesian the Emperors time, under
a grievous persecution of Christians it produced Alban the Protomartyr of the
Britains, a stout Champion of the Gospel: to him therefore have recourse for
his Story; but especially to the never to be enough praised Dr. Usher, lately
Archbishop of Armagh, who therein has detected many errors and mistakes,
cleared all doubts, and set right the whole Narration of his life and death;
and Eccles. cap. verse. 12.

London, and Papin. S^. Sylvarum. 2. 7.
-- Longarum territor Regina viarum;
As he said of the Appian. But there is some deflection in the course now,
which gave cause to Harrison to mistake Barnet for Sulloniacae. But Talbot, I
know not what reason he had for it, rather puts Edgeworth for it: And Fulk
Shelney, between St. Stephens and Ilstree; if by this he means Ellestr^e,
perhaps he is not much out of the Way; for much about this distance from
Londinium is Sulloniacae to be found: and our Antiquary has light upon it at
Brockley hill, where are the remains of an old Station and very much rubbish
dug up. The Roman power at length expiring in the Island, and all being set
on fire by the Saxon with War, an universal face of Barbarism overrun all, and
among the rest all that lay between the Chiltern was all overgrown with trees
and bushes, and almost to London, and not restored again, nor the way quitted,
till by Leoftan the twelfth Abbot of S. Albans a little before the Normans
entrance: Mat. Paris in vitis Abbatum S. Albani, in Leofstano 12.
Ille, says the Historian, opaca nemora, qu^ a limbo Ciltri^ usque Londonium

deserted, another by the license of the Bishops of London, between three and
four hundred years ago, through High-Gate and Barnet being laid open, as is
already observed, by our learned Countreyman and diligent Antiquary.

confesses himself to have had, as often as it chanced to be set on fire; Roma
sihi incendia ab hoc (...) dolori esse, quod scire^ (...) refurrectura, quam
arsissent: He knew they would be built more stately after the burning. All
which argues and confirms thus much, that London is a body well complexioned:
or if you had rather have so much in Latin from the most polite, but
unimitable Com. in Tacit. Annal. 14.
Lipsius speaking of it: Londiniu^, says he, upon occasion of firing it under
Nero, by the incomparable woman B^dicia, urbs nobilissi^a, vitali genio
condi^a, hodieque celebre. The place which I mean is to be found in his
Commentaries upon the Immortal Annals of Cornelius Tacitus, wherein is almost
the antientest mention of Londinium, which we may by no means neglect to bring
in here: At Suetonius mirae constantia medios inter hosts Londinium perrexit,
cognomento quidem colonia non (...), sed copia negotiatorum and commeatu maxim
celebre. Ibi a^biguus a^ ill^ sede^ bello detigeret, circumspecta insrequentia
^litis. Satisque magnis documentis temeritatem Petilii coercita^, ^nius op^di
damno serv^re universa statnit. Neque fletu and lachrimis (...) ejus orantium
flexus est, quin daret profectionis signum, and (...) in partem agnimis
acciperet. Si quos imbellis sexus aut fess^ (...), vel loci dulcedo attinnerat,
ab host oppress sunt. Here the name of London, as said, is first to be found
in any ancient authentic writing, and that for the calamities sake, which at
this time it suffered most extreme. But that violence which could abate, and
desolate happiness for the time, advanced the name thereof to immortal
remembrance by Annal. 14.
Cornelius Tacitus, her principal Historian, and witness. Tragical effects
the most natural matter of renown. Prosperous successes vanish in the warmth
of their own fruition. His memory therefore deserves a special honor there.
And if ever the most Civil, pompous, and thankful uses of the magnificent Acts
of Statuarie, Founding, Mowlding, Musive, and Graving, prevail to come up here,
as among the Greeks and Romans, both he and others shall undoubtedly enjoy it.
In the words last cited the excellent Historian tells how the Roman General,
or Pro Praetor, out of an apprehension of the scarcity of his Soldiers, not
daring to stand Boadicia's Forces, quite abandoned and deserted London to the
cruelty and rape of the enemies, neither would be persuaded otherwise by any
tears or entreaties of the Citizens. And out of his positive words, we may know
that London was not a Colony, Londinium cognomento quidem Coloniae non insigne:
wherefore Onuphr. P^ninus in Imper. Romans
Onuphrius can be no way excused, who expressly against Tacitus words, says,
there was a Colony there. But there are two several translations, each of them
in Print, who out of that very place of Tacitus would make London seem a
Colony. If there be any hope, that he could have such a meaning; it must shine
from out of other words in his Agricola, where summing the hurts, and mischiefs
of Boadicia's darings, he speaks plurally, as if Colonies were destroyed, and
not one Colony alone. That reading of the place being literally urged, London
then may best put in for that title, with Camalodunum. But some of the most
learned neither read the Latin Word as in the number of multitude, and there is
also another commodious answer; figure of speech; which not rarely admits a
plural for a singular, as a graceful excess. London was never said to be a
Colony. The honor so much the more, that having no such support, it should
grow so superlatively eminent. These are some few among the infinite
innovations of Translators. Description of Places is an express office of
History, as the clearing of doubts, a necessary right of description.

As for the word commeatu, besides which there is no difficulty in the Text,
you may render it, if you please, for the great company of Merchants, and
multitudinous passages, that is to say, for great resort and flocking too and
again by Sea: but if this word of his will not properly bear this meaning, then
are we to substitute in the room thereof this, or the like English, A Town
abounding with all sorts of victuals, or provisions so that he may mean what
Adi v. Clariss. Is. Casaub. in Augusto cap. 98.
Salust does, speaking of the City Vacca in Africa, because it was forum rerum
venalium totius regni (...) celebratum: for it was ever famous frequentia
negotiatorum. And voyages, fleets, embarquements, and passages usually made, as
we see in this present journey, do necessarily imply an overflowing plenty in
the station. Both interpretations are true concerning it. Now I am not
ignorant, that the date of Londons building was very much more of yore,
according as it assigned in the Galfrid. Monmouth. Hist. Brit. lib. 1. c. 10.
British History: and more anciently inhabited then Rome it self, according to
some. It was built says Galfridus under Brute: his own words are, Condiditque,
civitatem, eamque Trojam novam vocavit; and hoc nomine multis postmodum
temporibus appellata: tandem per corruptionem vocabuli Ternovantum dicta fuit.
Which name may seem to be derived from the Trinobantes in Caesar and ^olemy, to
which people it most certainly belonged: yet we find it constantly expressed by
Troinovant or N^w Troy: not unlike to the conceit in the Historian, who
deducing the name of the City Tralleis, conceives it to be, as much as Niceph.

understand, what civitas means in him: and though he in his Commentaries, with

learned man, who doubts not to have undertaken the business; but that he had
at that time formerly engaged himself in another subject. But it is most of use
for the present and most certain for the story, that the estate and quality of
London, immediately before the burning under Nero, was most flourishing; at
leastwise comparatively with all other places of Britain, for the points of
Trade, resort and plenty. And those few words of Cor. Tacitus, formerly cited,
confess somewhat either of a wrong, or wonder; that London being worthy indeed
to enjoy the title, and privileges of a Colony, it was left notwithstanding
under the inferior name of but only a Town among the Romans. A City among the
Britans and their principal. The very last joints in the composition of the
name Londinium (if nothing else) would prove it well. For the word Dinas in
ancient British, signifies (as they say) a city. Among Ca^dens Roman Copper
coyns touching our Country, there is one in honor of Britannicus, the son of
Claudius Caesar, which has nothing legible upon it, but....PETANNIKOS --

nothing to answer, but that it may probably be so, till we find out better to

And diverse other Greek Writers before Christ's time. But hear how my Author
gratulates to his own good luck this discovery, and wonderfully pleases
himself thereat. And, if nothing shall hereafter infirm it, Great BRITAIN must
no longer incur the barbarous note, of being City-lesse in CAESAR'S days; and
then also must LONDON undoubtedly owe, the best proof, and clearest light, as
well for dignity as Antiquity, that has hitherto been seen among us, unto me,
who first of Mortals have duly asserted the honorable name thereof into the
title of a civil Metropolis, till this present hour overwhelmed in the rubbidge
of BRITAINS ruin. For though OCTAVIUS STRADA (to whose memory immortal thanks
are due;) has afforded the Medalia, he has not meddled with the life of the
thing, the meaning: that is only mine. Special History depends upon the rare
argument of the Coin; for both the which, one act of exposition shall serve in
their more proper place and time. And that LO. being the initial Letters of the
name, should in STRADA'S coin signify LONDON, cannot seem strange either to
the learned, or the ignorant; when in other Coyns concerning Britain, the mere
Vt in v^* ^mmis P. L. S. i. e. Pecunia Londinii (...)
single L. it self imports as much. Nor will it be the fortune of any man to
find a Town in Britain, whose name beginning (...) aliud est Britaniae oppidum

with those letters, can be fit to bear the stately title of a Metropolis, but
this alone.

London to say the truth (say those famous Annals:) was not enobled with the
surname of a Colony. The Romans therefore who had settled their households in
London (for as wise Seneca observes, they made their Country every place where
they overcame) were so many, that nothing wanted to erect it into a Colony, but
an act of the Senate of Rome to authorize the title, and rights; their numbers
appearing to be already sufficient for support of the charge, and dignity.
They therefore and their fellows, the natural Britains, together with the
ordinary sequels of their persons and professions, who dwelt therein, amounted
to an extraordinary multitude, which made the place not more populous then full
of houses. For the proportion of habitations answers the proportion of
inhabitants. How many the Londoners were of either kind, is a matter less known
then how far every way the buildings went, which neither could be narrow, nor
ignoble; but large as for copious Merchants, and magnificent as for
magnifico's. For as the most learned Carolus Sigonins observes out of Cicero,
the Gentlemen and Knights of Rome, dealt in merchandise at home, and abroad,
and were members of the College of Mercury, whose stately Seat was upon Mount
Capitoline it self, and whose limbs and parts were spread through the Roman
world. One of the suburbs of Nero's London abutted upon the Fields Quibus more

the Coyns of other Emperors dug up there, among the Monuments of the dead,
do abundantly witness.

Our learned Antiquary Camden adds to Nero's, some of Claudians and Vespasians
Coyns also; and besides other Crockets and earthen Vessels, he mentions glass
vials, in which remains still some liquid matter, which he thinks, might be
either of the libations, of milk and wine, which in the burning of bodies, the
ancient Romans used at Funerals; or else of the odoriferous liquors, whereof
Statius speaks: -- Vidaeque liquores
Arsuram lavere comam.

The very bigness of London a cause why Paulinus forsook it the rather, as
having not men enough to keep it. So ancient a City of the Britains, the same
in like sort so new a Seat of the Civil Romans, could neither want Temples,
Bains, Aquaeducts, Courts of Counsel, and Justice, nor other Public works to
render it complete in it self, and afar off worth the beholding. The River full
of Ships (for Merchants and Ships do always suppose one the other) the rivage
full of seafaring men, the In nsfull of strangers. Here was the staple of
Trade, and the capital Mart of Britain, the Bower of the Noble (for they had no
where else to be so furnished) the bliss of the thrifty (for they had no where
else to be so enriched) the delight of all. Here also, or no where rather, the
public storehouses, granaries, and Magazines, the safest stowage of gotton
spoils, the Soldiers packs, and baggage the hostages of the British States,
the public Records (as at Samarobriva under Julius Caesar in Gallo^elgick)
and whatsoever stuff, or provisions Suetonius Paullinus in his aspiring spirit,
might design for a triumphal, or an ovant show at Rome; For by his good service
in Britain he atohieved as great glory and fame, as ever he had done in Prius

Africa. His care to reach to London before the cruel Rebels, an argumet of the
premises, and of this also, that it was the top it self of all the Roman
interest in Britain. His purpose moreover to erect the same into the seat of
War, makes it credible, that it was not without a Wall even then, but every way
defensible; had it met with a season more favorable, or with a Captain as firm
as the faith of the people. Within it the splendor of arms, and the furnitures
of peace, which till the most fierce Boadicia struck up for battle, was every
where most deep and still. And whereas the place of store had evermore a strong
guard within it, as at Cas. de bello Gallico lib. 5.

Ptolem^ns days under Adrian. And the infrequency of Soldiers which is
alleged in Tacitus for a cause why Suetonius did dislodge from thence, was the
infrequency (if conjecture hits right) of that brave bold Legion, whose bands
and troops were not full as then, by reason of absences by leave, or far
dispersion of the parts, which all came in before the battle, though wanting at
the musters. Thus richt, thus populous, thus great, thus strong, thus goodly,
and thus abounding with the necessaries, and pleasures of life, Suetonius
Paullinus possessed London at his return from Mona, for the service of Caesar,
and of Caesar's Roman-Britain. And the utter desertion of it by him, to the
merciless cruelty of the incensed and victorious Britains, you have, in what
follows in the same judicious and acute writer. For such, both here and
elsewhere is all that proceeds from him.

Now if you please in the mean while take a nearer notice of the names of this
great City, by way of Etymology, and deduction thereof, being very likely from
thence to confer somewhat to the illustration of so ancient and famous a place.

the old Copies: and in the written Copies as Simler and Surita both witness:

Longidinium. In Ptolemies Geography there is a people mentioned near upon
Sweden, called by him Longididuni: but between whom and Longidinium I know no
more relation either of old time, or now; then I believe that our Londinum or
Londinium was so called from Linden a See Fynes Morysons Travels part 1. lib.

Let us descend a little lower to the age of Constantius; and in a Panegyric
to him, we shall find Oppidum Londiniense, the Latin Gentile name, which must
needs confirm what we say: but for the Courteous Readers sake we shall not
think it much to transcribe hither the whole place of that eloquent writer:

denique ad perpetuam quietem maria purgata sunt! He means here the utter rout
and overthrow given to the Franks by Constantius his men, after they had
plundered the goodly City: but concerning this, I shall refer you to our
History of Britain. But the last words of Fumenius put me in mind, of the Naval
strength and glory of Britain in those days, and withal of Camdens Etymology
of Londinium, which be pleased to take in his own words: where he tells us,
that this City, unde celebritatem, inde and appellationem consecutam esse; a

Augusti, etc. In the very next age to Constantius, unless, you shall find
Londinium again in the best Editions of Ammianus Marcellinus, and Lundinium too
by the fault of the Librarii; which gave occasion, I do not say sufficient, to
Fr^derick Lindenbrogius to Print it so in all the three places of the Historian
wherein it is mentioned, as is in the first place, where under Julian he tells
us that A^m. Mar. Hist. lib. 20.
Lupicinus the Migister Armorum was sent into Britain ad rations componendas,
thus: adulta ^yeme dux Lupicinus Bononiam venit: quas^tisque novigiis, and omni

speaking of the same Ibidem lib. 28.
theodisius, Vero dux nominis inclyti, animo vigore collecto ab Augusta
prosectus, quam veteres appellavere Lundinium. And in N^nius his Catalogue of
British Cities it is accordingly written Caer-Lundei^. And here by no means may
I leave out that which the same Historian there relates, concerning this
gallant General, who presently after the landing here, and in his march up to
London, dividing his strength into diverse bodies, set upon the straggling and
boothaling Companies of such as had lately plundered London, encumbred with
their booty: and propere sus^, pradam excussit, quam tribut arii perdidere

fessis, mersam difficultatibus suis an^ac civitatem, subito que solus sperari
po^ recreatom, in ovantis speciem latissimus introi^t. You hear that in
Ammianus time it was thought Vetus Oppidum: but then it was of new called
Augusta. A name full of the highest Dignity, full of Majesty. And the builders
or restorers of Cities when as either they hoped or desired that their Cities
might become flourishing and powerful, they headfully looked to it, that they
had lucky names imposed. Now amongst the lucky, and most fortunate there was
none more lucky or auspicate, to borrow a word then that of Augusta. For that
best and greatest Emperor Octavius, did not without the Judgment of the
learned assume this name to himself Augusius, says Dio lib. 54.
Dia [(...),] who was so called as it were somewhat larger then humane nature.

Romans themselves that they might gain the Gods to themselves and so deal more
happily by their favor and assistance, call them too as they did their Caesar's
also Augustos as they were Prastites Imper^: Hence it is that we frequently
meet with such inscriptions as these.

Country, that Constantine the great, at the suit of his Mother Helena, did

Coyns of her^ are often found about the Walls; I am brought to believe, that it
was called Augusta by Constantinus himself, in honor of his Mother H^na. For
he exceedingly honored her, in so much that he gave order that she should be
styled Augusta Regina. And for this we have (...). Euse. de vita Constan. M.

of a thing lately done. Although indeed Harris. desc. Brit. lib. 11. cap. 7.

William Harrison says it was called so from the famous Roman Legion here,
named in inscriptions as well as old Writers. Augusta secunda. But he has no
reason nor authority for it. For that that Legion ever was resident at London,
there is no testimony at all extant. That it lay indeed sometime a^ Sandwich in
Kent, or Bu^upiae, the No^ia Imperii Occidentis sufficiently informs us. And
that some part thereof at least had sometime their being near about Sterling in
Scotland, we are taught by inscriptions dug up there.

But that the main body of the Legion kept its constant rendevouz at Isca, or
Caer-Leon in Monmouthshire, is as certain, as it is most uncertain that ever it
was at Exce^r: though Ptolemy seem to say so: but it is one of those many
mistakes to be taken notice of in him.

In the forenamed Notitia, you shall light upon the Praepositus Thesaurorum
AUGUSTENSIUM in brita^, sub dispositione viri illustris Comitis sacrarum
Largi^ionum Occidentis. Such kind of Praeposita with their Officers, are called
by C. de Pal. Sa^r. Larg. l. 2.
Valentin^ the Emperor Thesaurentes, and are thought to have transported in
Ships such species as were counted fit for the sacred or Imperial Largitians,
or Beneficence. It is the learned Camdens conjecture, that this Praepositus
here, was over some officina monetaria, instituted by Constantine the Great:
for we read, says he, in his coyns, which he stamped in honor of his Father
Constantius, and others also, P. LON. S. that is to say, Money stamped at London.

Peter de Natalibus, out of the Martyrologies of the Ancients, records one
Augulius Pontifex Augustae Civitatis Britanmae, in the year 304. which is
before Constantine came to the Empire two years. I know not of what esteem the
word of Petrus De Natalibus is among learned men: as also of Gilbert
Genebrards, who alike also on the seventh of February celebrates the departure
of Augurius (so he calls him:) Bishop of Ireland, in the year CCCLXI. under
Valentinian (he means Julian.) But let others look to that: I shall refer my
courteous Reader for-better satisfaction to the all-knowing D. Vsserius de

together with all the Counsels of Gallia, which we owe to the care and
diligence of that excellently learned man Jaques Sirmond, a French Jesuit: thus

Restitutus Episcopus de Civitate Londinensi provincia suprascripta. Adelfius

So that out of Britain, besides this Restitutus of London, there were present
at the first Council at Arles, Eborius Bishop of York, and Adelfius Bishop de
Civitate Colonia Londinensium, as he is called here, with Sacerdos, a Priest;
and Arminius, a Deacon.

But what means Civitas Coloniae Londinensium, in this place says the
excellent Seld. Com. in Eutychii Orig. Alexandr. page 118.
Seldom? That signifies nothing at all in the Topography of Britain. I know not
what credit may be given to the book of the Abbey of Corbey; neither have I ever
heard of what antiquity it is. Yet if so be the subscriptions out of it are to
be admitted, I can scarce doubt at all, says that great Scholar, however
Vsser. Diatriba de Episcopatu Anglicae page 12. 13. and de Primordiis. etc.
page 195. and 317.
others conjecture otherways (he understands the most excellent Usher:) but
that this Adelfius was Bishop of the Colony Camalodonum, or Camalodunum. For we
are to take notice that this Colony was of old time famous amongst us, so long
as the Roman power and sway prevailed here. For the name thereof, which,
whereas perhaps it was written curtail'dly (as Col. or Colon. Camalodun. or as
sometimes it is found, Camalodon:) might be by the Transcribers, unto whom
London, and the name thereof was very well known, and in the mean while, that
of the Colonia, Camalodunum altogether unheard of both by the cognation of the
sound, as also the unskilfulness of reading, be changed into Colonia London, or
Londin. So the great Seldom. And now to have done with Restitutus, Athanasius,
where he speaks concerning the Bishops which met at the Council of Sardica;
where himself also was present; not only expressly says, that were there (...)

London, mentioned in the Council at Arles: and therefore the learned man named
by us ere-while, concludes it a thing very improbable, that Bishops should be
present out of Britain, at a Counsel but a little while before; he means that
at * Arles: and also at another not so long after he means that at * Sardica:
and yet none to be heard of at that cccxiiii. An. cccxxxv. An. cccxlvii.
at * Nice, which was called between them both: when as notwithstanding all the
Bishops through the Christian World were by Constantines Edict summoned hither:
and that too, out of a Province whereon the Emperor had no trivial or ordinary
Engagements. And I might here as well mention the Britains, which were at the
Synod of Ariminum. Sulpit. Se-Eccles. Hist. 2.

three Bishops only, reckoned at the Synod out of Britain, it is more then very
likely, that one of them was of London: especially we having so good
testimonies of Bishops there in those Primitive times, and particularly called
to the Counsels abroad. But surely I should be highly censured, by the
admirers of certain who would be accounted principal Antiquaries among us, if
I should leave out in this recension of London Bishops, Fastidius, who they
say, sat there, making him, some an Io. Pits. De Britanniae scriptorib. ^tat.

but one Author for it, Gennadius: Fastidius Brittannorum Episcopus, scripsit ad

Church a Presbyter of M^ssilia, or Marseils; who wrote a Catalogue of
Ecclesiastical Writers, which were before him. Fastidius is said to have lived
in the days of Honorius and Theodosius, Anno Dom. CCCCXX. Not only Honorius
Augustodunensis in his Catalogue has all in a manner out of him: but also,

that it is of late years published at Rome, with the Annotations of a very
learned man Lucas Holstenius, and with the very same Title, and dedicated by
the Cardinal Francisco Barbarino to Charles last King of Britain.

And very such men as these, whereof I speak, will expect as consequent, after
this my discourse of the most ancient Bishops of London, something also to be
said of their Church, which is also very ancient. I shall have no need to
mention old King Etheldred; Alas they can tell us that it was sometimes
formerly a Temple of Diana. But what (...), and probabilities, the learned

Camden brings for it. I had rather the studious Reader would fetch out of his
own book, then that I should transfer them hither. For neither do I here
institute any dispute concerning the lawfulness of making use of heathen
Temples to the service of the true God. For he being only sufficiently
worshipped in spirit and truth, I cannot see, how any place can be so much
polluted, by either Pagan or other idolatry; but that he both can and will hear
the prayers of such as truly serve him. But seeing that men will have it so, and
are wholly bent upon it, let them if they please then, make a right and holy
use of places dedicated in Christianity, according as convenience shall best
direct them. Only this much troubles me, that formerly I have seen, and do
still see among Christians, so many Pagan superstitions rites and customs;
among them I say who have given up their names to Christ. Concerning the
occasion, which urged so much from me, I only add this; that Diana indeed was
worshipped here in the Roman time, and had Temples here too, this inscription
will witness abundantly: Extat apud Camden. ad V^k in Monmouthsh.

But this Tradition (for I may call it no better:) that St. Paul's Church was
formerly a Temple of Diana, was believed by many: I by no means mean Mr. Seldom
among such; Claris. S^ld. illust. in Polyol. Magni Poetae Anglici Cant. 8.
yet he is pleased to sport (for I have no reason to say he was in good
earnest:) his wit, which he had extraordinary, and in most weighty matters
surpassing other men, in deriving the name of London; and conjecture being
free, as he says, he could immagine, it might be called at first Lhan Dien, id
est, the Temple of Diana: imitating the conceit of Humphrey Lhuid, which you
heard even now, deriving Verulamium from Verlhan, that is the Church upon the
River Were: Now, says he, that the antique course was to title their Cities ost
times by the name of their power adored in them, is plain by Beth-el among the
Hebrews, Heliopolis (which in holy Writ is called Ier. cap. 43. com. ul^.

and Eubaea, and that Stephan. (...). in (...). Herodot. lib. C.
Bubastis in Egypt, so called from the same word, signifying in Egyptian both

The same may be said concerning the Temple of Apollo, on the Ruins of which,
the report is, St. Peter's in Westminster was founded not very far off, (for
though the houses be quite contiguous now, yet heretofore in our Forefathers
days, as I find it Guil. Stephanides descript. Londoniae.
written, it was accounted from London thither, two miles) but I find no
sufficient authority in any remote Antiquity for the Temple of Apollo.

The main testimony, worth speaking of, alleged for it, is out of a Monk, and
he too, but of obscure name and credit. And the learnedest man I have known
this last age in England tells us plainly, that in his turning over of Vsserius

slain, are said to have given it out, that Apollo fought against him; and that
that victory was not Maximus's, or the Senates, but of the Gods themselves.
There are many Vota of the ancients made to Apollo Belenus Augustus, inscribed
upon apiece Altars, which are to be seen in the Hercules Prodicius of
Stephanus Pighius, and also Gruter. The visible footsteps of this name are to
be found in Cassibelin, and Cunobelin, two Britain Kings mentioned in Caesar
and Dio. And the very name whole in the British History in King Galf. Monmouth.

Besides what has been said hitherto concerning this famous City, matters
gallant and magnificent enough, there remain many other great and glorious
things concerning it, which deservedly challenge, as their due, room also in
this place; but that I have formerly, wherewith too I have acquainted the
Reader in more then one place, confined my self to the limet and bound of a
certain set time, while the Romans exercised their power and bore sway here in
the Island. I have all along for that space been very scrupulous and
circumspect what authorities I made use of: Hence it is, that where I found not
sufficient proof for what I met with, were it never so specious for the honor
and interest of Britain, I rejected it as unvalid. As where Constantine the
Greats birth place is assigned to be London: and that by no mean Authors, among
whom is William Stephanides or Fit-stephen, an Author who above 400 years ago
wrote the Description of the City of London in Latin, a very learned man for
that age, whose Book, though it be of late left out of the Catalogue of his
works by Ioannes Pitseus, yet is he mentioned with good credit by as ancient a
Writer and better thought of than he, Ranulph of Higden in his Polychronicon
Lib. 11. cap. 25. Neither for some stately structures in London and elsewhere

fortissimam, cujus and area, and muri a fundamento profundissimo exurgunt:
ce^to cum sanguine animalium temperato. I could seriously with that that piece
were better mended in the hands of men, or at least better understood, then I
presume it is by the Translation thereof, published in the last large edition
of Stowes Survey of London.

I have somewhere given free way to conjecture, giving it, where authority of
Writers was wanting, equal strength, especially if the (...) thereof required
it so: As I think we may in that ingenious one of our learned Antiquary Camden,
who conceives, that the great stone pitched in Canning-street, did answer to the
Miliarium Aureum in Rome, and this the rather persuaded him to believe it,
because the ancient thorow-fare of the City passed here, as may be collected
from the Watling-Street, to the end of which this is near joined. And then will
the distance between Verulamium, and London, set down XXI. miles in Antoninus,
very well suite; if we withal reckon to this great stone, and consider too
that S. Albans is so much on this side Verulamium; accounting it but twenty
miles thither at this day, and those but very short ones. I Prius, ^ide
Miliari, sive millibus pastibus.
have spoken formerly enough I suppose concerning the Miliarium Aureum: Neither
am I yet satisfied about an ancient Law concerning it of Macer, or as other
Editions call him Martianus: D. De verb. signif. lib. 154.
Mill passus non a miliario urbis, sed a continentibus aedificiis numerandi
sunt. For that Gloss, or Scholion, which to miliario urbis, some do annote
(...), does in my apprehension do nothing. For Plus. in C^atchis.
Plutarth and other good Authors seem to say otherwise, whom the diligent
Readers may peruse at their leisure.

I cannot think therefore of any thing else proceeding from the Romans times
here or Equavous to their greatness, in so great a decay of ancient memories,
except it be the Thames; which as it has exceeded the original of this brave
place in time and being, so deserves it to have a few words spoken of it.

to flow and to ebb so far as the banks, but inserteth and windeth it self into

The state of London, and the Trinobantes, whose chief City it was, at the
coming of Julius Caesar, and after him, was thus, as himself has left
recorded. Cassibelaunus, so he calls him, had lately made War upon them, and
slain Imanuentius, the chief Governor and Commander: Whereupon M^ndubratius

applying himself unto Caesar, and he having brought Cassibelaunus to terms of
yielding, he received likewise from him special Command, at his last quitting
of the Island, that he should not presume to annoy Mandubratius, or the
Trinobantes, as friends of the Roman State and Caesar. Caes. de bel-Gallico

Thus much himself. As for the gallant City, I will take my leave of it, and
its admirers, in the words of Otho, out of that wise Oration of his (for Tacit.

Tacitus made it for him:) a little before he became Emperor, and his words
concerning Rome very little altered:

possunt. Aeternitas rerum, and pax reipublicae, incolumitate urbis firmatur.

mentioned by Ptolemy, who calls it (...), and names it as the chief City of the

am that our Chorographers are a great deal farther wide then he, while some of
them will have Noviomagum to have been, where (i) Chester now stands; as Sir
Thomas Eliat: others at Will. Harris. descript. Britain. lib. 2. cap. 7.

better authority by far, we may learn, that Magus amongst the old Gouls, and
so consequently the Britains, signified oppidum, or a Town. Camden, our learned
Antiquary, seems in his opinion to have lighted pat upon the place, where this
old station sometime stood, in Surrey, at Woodcote, two miles Southward of
Wimbledon, on an hill, in quo modicae urbis manifesta visuntur vestigia, says
he. And he thinks he is in the right, both from the situation, as also distance
from London. And before him a learned man Robert Talbot, sought for it near
there about at Croydon, adding, that juxta Ptolemaeum non potest long remota
esse a Londino, cum nec in longitudine, nec in latitudine plene dimidiatum
gradum: And it is well known how easily and frequently Ptolemy both is, and may
be corrupted. But a very rational Mr. Will. Summer, Descript. of Canterbury.
Gentleman is not pleased with either of these; and he says he cannot conceive
how Noviomagus should be a stage for this Rode (A Londinio Rutupias:) and lie
wide of London, as Woodcote does, so many miles, and consequently set the
Traveller at as great a distance from the place whither he is bound Rutupiae.
Richborough as when he first set out of London. Considering this, and the
distance between London and Rochester, by the Itinerary, I should rather place
it about Crayford, much about ten miles from London, upon or along some Hill or
Down, since it is otherwise called Noviodunum. Thus far he; very judicially as
he does other things. Yet we may be permitted to request satisfaction in some
doubts, which cause us not to give such assent to his words, as we would be
willing otherwise to do. As first, what we shall say to Ptolemy, who places it
among the Regni, not amongst the Cantii: and it is not likely, that he there,
where he reprehendeth the want of care in Marinus Tyrius.
another about the position of this place, would himself be so overseen:
neither may it be said that the Cautian Territories were more contract then,
than they are at this day: we would know likewise, what ground or place may be
the likeliest to be assigned and set forth for this station in old time to have
stood upon: for it cannot be that there are no vestigia, or so much as the very
ruins to say, Here once it was. We would gladly know likewise where these
diverse readings are to be found, which tell us that Noviomagum is otherwise
called Noviodunum. We know very well what Dunum signified among the old
Britains and Gauls in composition of the names of Towns and Cities. We have
heard also, but never in Britain of Noviodunum among the Aedni in France or old
Gallia; for we have it described by Iul. Caesar. de bello Gallico l. 7.

answer for the Travelers much going awry, and out of his way, that setting out
of London, and bound for Sandwich, or Rutupiae, goes first 8. or 10. miles wide
of London, to Woodcote: or as himself pleases, to old Croydon, and from thence
to Maidston, and so forward, speaks of two several ways, whereof the one was
Rob. Talbot Annotat. in Antonin. MS.
via longior quidem, sed per loca inhabitatiora planioraque, and prorsus
aptiora ad conductum exercitus: Haec autem directior, magisque compendiaria. He
adds moreover that Croydon, being the possession of the Archbishops of
Canterbury, with other Towns was assigned, per quas commodius parvis itineribus
ad Concilia Regum ascendere Londinum, and descendere inde possent. Sic prima
die veniant Londino Croydonam; secunda Otfordidiam, quae super eandem viam sita
est; tertia Maidstonam; quarta Charingas; quinta demum die Cantuariam: Quo vel
uno die expiditiores properantioresque pervenire possent perviam
Rochesiriensem. Now he says that he means old Croydon; for that near there is
showed a place, which is called The old Town, taking up almost a mile in
length, and farther off London then new Croydon; so ceking out the way, for the
better consonancy of the distance.

VAGNIACIS. M. P. XVIII.] This is a station of very uncertain positure, and
therefore Lhuid, a knowing Antiquary, lets it pass with these words only. Quod
nomen hoc tempore habet penitus ignoro. The corruption of the numbers of the
miles is to be thought the cause of this ignorance and difficulty. And
therefore Talbot considering that at this day it was but ^7. miles from London
to Rochester; he mends the number in his journey and of ^8. he makes 8.
reckning thus: from London to Noviomagus 10 from Noviomagus to Vagniacae 8.
from Vagniacae to Duroprovae or Duropronae (for the reading of this name is
very diverse:) 9. which small numbers being put together make up the fore spoken
number. Now he takes no notice of the obliquity of the way, for somewhere he
says, that Croydon is not multum extra viam Cantuarium versus: but so have
others done. In editions Antonin. altera.
Will. Harrison, another Antiquary of ours, complaining much of the depravation
of the numbers here; lets us know, that in one copy which he used to better his
edition of Antoninus, he found after Vagniacis only VI. miles; and that perhaps
faulty, though not so much as XVIII. on the other side: Talbot thinks that
Vagniacae is now Wrotham a Village at the foresaid distance. And he has to
back him that prudent and learned Lawyer, who lived not long after him, and who
also wrote the description of his own Country Kent, Will. Lambert, sometime of
Lincolns Inn. The reason why I say what I do, is because upon my knowledge
Talbots book was in great request with him; besides that he cites him diverse
times in his Xenagogus or Perambulation of Kent. But I could have wished that
either of them, had brought us some reasons or grounds for what they say. This
later indeed tells us that the English name is corruptly written Broteham in
Doomsday book: and Cuil. Lamb. Xenagog. seu Peramb. of Kent. page 170.
that he supposes that Wyptham is the very right name, given for the plenty of
worts and good herbs there.

But Camden, who lately was known to have been K. of Heralds, and is reputed
still by many of the best K. of our English Antiquaries, is thought to mistake,
by keeping to the old number of miles XVIII. and so concluding it to be
Maidston, a noted Town, called anciently by the Saxons Pebpea^on; induced
thereto, as he confesses himself, by the answerable distances set down in the
journey; there being something sounding like the first syllable of Vagniacae in
the Saxon name; though he take no notice of it to the Reader; but say some the
journey will prove enormiously awry, and out of the way to travel from Maidston
to Rochester, and thence to Lenham, and so to Canterbury. And even so it may be
said, that to go up to London, from York through Wales, is no straight or
direct journying, if we would be judged by any Northern Carrier, and yet so is
all the former part of this very Journey, as is to be seen. And although there
be, who think that Durobrovis or Rochester, is rather intended by Ninnius in
his Catalogue of British Cities by his Caer Medwag, then Maidstone; yet can no
body deny him this, that in the declining time of the Roman power in Britain,
Maidstone was anciently called Tab. Milit: vetus a Marco Velfero edita. Habetur

Madus.

DUROPRONIS. M. P. IX.] This Roman station is scare met withal, I mean in any
ancient author, except it be in this Itinerary again. But here also so various
is the reading of the name, as well in regard of the several Copies, as the
journeys here, which you would take to be the right, is thereby rendered most
difficult. In regard of the journys there is this difference: in this second
journey you find Durobrovis: in the third Dubobrus M. P. XXVII. in the fourth,
Durobrius, and again M. P. XXVII. That the same place is intended in all three,
there need no doubt to be made at all; and for the two last, Simler a mere
stranger, could say so too by finding the same distance from Darvernum, or
Canterbury. In regard of the several copies Hieronimus Surita, the Spaniard,
who diligently compared many of them, and diverse others will acquaint you: for
he found Duroprovis, Duropronis, Durobrivis, Dubobrius, Durobrovis. In the
Peutingerian Military Tables you have written Ro^bis for it, concerning which
see Petrus Bertius his edition. From that contracted and the Latin word
Castra, a Camp, changed into Cea^, signifying to our forefathers a City, or an
assembly of men enjoying the same rites, and privileges, Rofchester has
proceeded, and at this day Rochester: Venerable Beda conceited it to be so
called from one Roffus, it is not known, who he was; and to me it is uncertain
whether ever. Hence is it that we have these words in him: Beda Eccles. Hist.
l. 2. cap. 6.
Et justus quidem ad civitatem Rhofi, cui praesuerat, rediit. And before these,
this is also cited out of him, but not mended: Ibid. lib. 2. cap. 3.
Justum vero in ipso Cantio Augustinus ordinavit Episcopum in civitate
Doroverni, quam gens Anglorum a primario quondam illius qui dicebatur
Rotschester cognominat. Distat autem a Doroverno milibus passuum ferme viginti
quatuor ad Occidentem, Beda calls it also Castellum Cantuariorum. And in an old
book Qui dicitur Texius Roffensis MS.
belonging to Rochester you read, Dabo unam villam L. quam.
quod nos Saxonice An Haga dicimus in Miridie Castelli Hrobi; whence often in
Deeds H^oue coa^; the R. it seems having an aspirate before it, like'p in
Greek. Harrison, Camden, and Ortelius seem to have found among them Durobrevis.
Yet our Talbot witnesses, that in the Charter of the foundation of the
Monastery, it was called expressly, and, as his own words are, disertis verbis,
Durobrivae. Hear his own words: Quod Rochester olim Durobrivaevocabatur, Charta
Fundationis Monasterii, quim Prior, qui nunc Decanus est ibidem mihi aliquando
ostendit; And he deduces the name from Dorbryf i. e. Quick-stream: for here
indeed the current of the Medway is very impetuous and violent. But this as I
remember, he owes to Leland.

DUROLEMO. M. P. XIII.] The distance otherwise is set down 16. miles. Many
learned men have busied their brains about this station. I will barely deliver
their opinions at this time; others, as Lhuid, will not venture upon it.

First Talbot, who dreams of Charing; and another time of Seethingbourn; and
knowing, that the first part of the name might come from Dour, which in British
signifies water; and also that Bourn in the Saxon noted a torrent or stream
increased with rain water; and seeing there a large Channel sometime
replenished therewith; he would if he had had a little more Welsh, and known
what Leve had signified in that language, have concluded something: but however
he says it is Aqua levis, and so speaks nothing at all to the purpose. But the
old name of it in the Peutingerian Military Table, Burolevum, confirms his
reading the Name by V. though indeed that B. has crept in for D.

But Camden, the next that says any thing, who reads the name Duro lenu^,
thinks it Lenham: and that it signifies, The dwelling, ad Lenu^ aquam; telling
us that at this Town a Water meets with the Medway. Besides the relics of the
name, as he pleases, the distance he says also, from Du^overnum and
Durobrovis make it good that this is Durolenum: to say nothing that it is sited
by the Roman Consular Highway, which from Dover, through the midst of Kent, is
continued on still; for which he brings Higden of Chesters testimony.

The last is William Somner, a knowing Gentleman, who for his Courtesy, and
love to ancient studies, I singularly respect, who, it being distanced by the
Itinerary XIII. miles from Durobrovis, takes it to have been seated not far
from Newington, a Village on the road between Rochester and Canterbury. In this
particular not a little strengthened and upholden in his conjecture, by the
multitude of Roman Urns lately found in digging there, at such place as is
already discovered, and discoursod of, by the learned Meric Casaubon, his ever
honored friend.

If any shall stumble at the disproportion of miles between it and Durovernum,
let them know, says he, there is even as great between Lenham and Canterbury.

He goes on: Why it should be called Durolevum, I am altogether ignorant. What
if I conjecture, (because the Itinerary lays out the rode from London to
Richborough, and not e contra) from having the River or Water of Medway on the
Verum hoc in sensu Laevus dicitur a Gr. (...).
left hand of it, as by the inhabitants tradition, Newington sometime had, and
within about two miles of it yet has?

If any looking for better Remains of a Roman station, shall object the mean
condition of the present village, such may know that Newington has been a
place of more note in time past, then now. I read of a Nunnery there of ancient
time, etc. and he quotes his Thorn. in vitis Abbatum S. Augustini.
Author for what he says. But having had such thoughts my self that way many
years ago, ever since the first publication of Antoninus (...) by that
incomparable man, the generally acknowledged Heir of his Fathers virtues, and
great learning, I could not temper my self, with the Readers good leave, from
causing his discourse to be transcribed hither, being so suitable to the
present business, and coming from so learned an hand: He therefore, having out
of Lucian de Luctu, cited a place treating of the several sorts of burial used
by sundry nations: (...). i. e. The Grecian did burn; the Persian bury; the
Indian does anoint with Swines grease; the Scythian eat; and the Egyptian
powder, or imbalm. Begins that discourse thus:

When Antoninus then says, (either an imbalmed carcass, or ashes;) he does
allude to the custom of his days among the Romans, which was either to bury
(the bodies of the richer sort being first imbalmed:) or to burn: though indeed
the later, through the increase of Christians, began soon after Antoninus his
time to grow much out of use every where. Now they that burned, used to gather
the relics of the dead corpse, consisting of bones and ashes, and to lay them
up in Urnis, Ollis, Ossuariis, in Pots, Urns, Crocks, and the like earthen
Vessels made of purpose; and so to bury them. I would not note it, (I must
confess) as a thing that I thought worth noting (for I think there can be
nothing more common:) but that I am glad to take this occasion to impart unto
the Reader a memorable curiosity in matter of antiquity, which by the learned
Antiquaries beyond the Seas, I am sure, would be much esteemed. Some two or
three miles beyond S^tingborn in Kent, West, as you go to London, there is a
little Village in the way called Newington. It has not been my luck hitherto in
any either later book or ancient Record, to find any thing concerning this
Village worth the noting. All that I can say of it, is, that the inhabitants
show a place, to which they say that in former times the water came, as indeed
by many circumstances it is very probable: and that Milton (a Town before the
conquest of great fame, and of very great antiquity) is not above two miles
from it. About a quarter of a mile before you come to Newington, not much above
a stones cast from the highway, on the right hand as you come from
Sittingburn, there is a field, out of which in a very little compass of ground,
have been taken out by digging within these few years, Roman Pots and Urns,
almost of all sizes and fashions, and in number very many: some thousands, I
have been told upon the place; but many hundreds I am sure I may say, and speak
within compass. And though so many have already been found, and carried away,
yet does the field afford them still (as I am told) now and then, according as
you prove either skilful or lucky in the digging. The figures of some of them I
have here caused to be represented to the Reader.

Roman urn Roman bowl Roman amphora

The first and greatest, with an Inscription graven and cut in and about the
neck of it SEVERIANUS, etc. was above a year ago by the pious and ingenious
Vicar of that Parish, Mr. Henry Dearing, bestowed upon me, which I keep as a
great Treasure: as also was the last not long after, with the cover of it over
it, so severally represented of purpose, that the form of either might the
better appear. The words of the Inscription of that first (as near as they
could be imitated) are these: (...) Casaub. Notis in M. Antonin. page 3.
(...)

In the writing of which words although something may be observed not ordinary,
as Ola, for Olla, and those kind of A. and L. etc. yet is there nothing so
singular, but a learned Antiquarie well versed in Gruters Thesaurus of
Inscriptions, will soon find examples of it. As for the sense and meaning of
the words, though not so obvious perchance as might be wished, yet must I
(because few words will not serve) suspend my opinion till some fitter
opportunity. That in the middle, with the Inscription COCCILLIM Vide A D ANSAM
in sequentibus Itin. 4.
was by the means of a worthy friend, M. Dr. Winston, (that great ornament of
his profession) procured unto me from the Right Honorable (for his worth, and
love to learning as well as by his place,) Richard, Earl of Portland, Lord High
Treasurer of England, etc. whom, with some other rare Antiquities it was sent
unto, some years ago. I was desirous to compare these that I had (for the
Inscriptions sake especially) with some others of the same kind. But I find
this difference, That whereas mine were much perished and worn by age, such was
the brightness and smoothness of this middle (of the cover of it I mean, which
is of a read colored earth) as that it rather resembled pure Coral, then
ordinary red earth: and as for the Letters of the Inscription, that they were
not as mine rudely engraven in with the hand, but in the same mould, and at the
same time when the cover it self was formed, very artificially printed, or
imbossed rather? as by these figures, that are represented you may in part
perceive. Since that, when I passed last by Newington coming from London, among
many other fragments of Antiquity in M. Dearings Garden I found the pieces of
just such another Cover (but that the color of it is nothing so fresh) with
this Inscription in the middle likewise, PRISCIAN. Now as the multitude of
these Newington Urns (for I do not remember that ever so many in so narrow a
Compass of ground were found: is observable; so is the manner of their laying
in the ground. They that have been present often at their digging up, have
observed, that where one great Urn is found, diverse less vessels are; some
within the great, some about it: all covered either with a proper cover of the
same Earth and making as the pot it self is; or more coursly, but very closely
stopped up with other Earth. Of all those small vessels of what fashion soever
that are found either in or about these Urns, I know no other use (to satisfy
in some part their curiosity, that wonder at them when they see them) that was
ordinary among the Romans, but either to contain some fragrant odoriferous
liquor, and durable confection; or that libatio of wine and milk, that they
used about their dead; or lastly (not to speak here of those burning Lamps that
have been found in some ancient Urns and Monuments, which so many have largely
written and disputed of) to receive and preserve the tears that were shed by
the friends of the deceased for grief of their death, as for the difference of
the greater and lesser Urns, Fabricius in his Roma, and Marlianus in his
Topographieal description of the same, are of opinion, that when Urns of
different bigness are found in the same place; the greater were for the greater
and richer, as the Masters and Patroni; and the lesser, for the poorer and
inferior, as the Servants and Clients. In things of the nature, which were I
mean altogether arbitrary, there is (...) but different fashions were used in
different places* (...) and likely in the same place, as every man's particular
conceit or humor served him. And therefore it were hard to determine any thing
as certainly and generally true. But as for these Newington Urns this seems to
have been the custom there used. One great Urn was appointed to contain the
bones and ashes of all one, either household or kindred. As often therefore as
any of them dyed, so often had they recourse unto the common Urn, which so
often was uncovered. To prevent this, I find that the fashion has been in some
places, to let in the ashes through some holes made and fitted for that purpose
See Gruter fol. 814. Now besides the great and common Urn, it is likely that
every particular person that dyed, had some less Urn or Vessel, particularly
dedicated to his own memory, whereby both the number of the deceased, and the
parties themselves might the better be remembered. There might be also another
use of these lesser pots, in my judgment very necessary, and that is, that by
them the common great Urns, might the better be known and discerned one from
another, which being so near, in so small a compass of ground, and not much
unlike one another, might otherwise easily be mistaken. And this is the more
likely, because of those many hundreds that have been taken up of the lesser
sort, scarce have there been found any, of one and the same making, I hear not
of any thing that has hitherto been found, in these Newington Urns besides
bones, and ashes: and sometimes clear water. And so do I read of Urns or
Earthen Vessels plenis limpidissima aqua, that have been found elsewhere, as
that which is mentioned in Gruterus, fol. 927. I doubt not but many would be
glad as well as I) to know certainly what this place has formerly been. But
alas, how should we (who are of yesterday and know nothing) without the help
of ancient Records, recall the memory of things forgotten so many hundred years
ago? Thus much we may certainly conclude: First, from the multitude of these
Urns, that it was once a common burying place for the Romans. Secondly, from
the History of the Romans in this land, that no Urn is there found, but is
1200. or 1300. Years old, at the least: so many ages of men have these poor
Earthen Vessels (of so much better clay for durance then humane bodies are)
outlasted both the Makers of them, and the persons to whose memory they were
consecrated. Lastly, from the place, which is upon an ascent (and for a good
way beyond hilly,) not far from the Sea, and near the Highway: we may affirm
in all probability, that it was once the Seat of a Roman Station. If any man
can teach me more of it, I shall heartily thank him. Since this was written, I
made another journey to the place, and spent some time there in digging, but
with no success. However, that I might not return home empty, the same Mr.
Dearing gave me a piece of Urn, which has this Inscription, FULL. LINUS.

DUROVERNO. M. P. XII.] It is also written according to the diverse Copies of
Antoninus Durorverno, and Duroverno; as Simler and Surita have noted, and in
the 2. next journys, Durarvenno: in Ptolemy too not much unlike in the Petri
Be^ii editio Geograph. Ptolema.

of Conradus Peutingerus you find it named Duraverus, corruptly I suppose. In
Beda and other of our Writers, it is Dorobernia; later Writers have given it

What and how great its fame was in the Romans time, is now unknown and forgot;
but for its modern splendor and glory, I refer you to courteous Mr. Somner's
Description thereof, not leaving out among others the great Colloq. de

usually extant, you shall find if you look back to Rochester. Out of the long
list of the Metropolitans of this famous City; I only mention Theodorus, a man
unlike the Sanguinary Monk Austen, his predecessor; and that not so much
because he is ancient, or Countreyman to Saint Paul, born at Tarsus in Cilicia;
as for that he was in his time a great Adi Historiam nostram Graecae linguae,
quae nuper prodiit page 52.
restorer of the Greek studies, in this Island; of whose Greek books we have
diverse yet extant, after a thousand years in our well furnished Libraries at
Cambridge.

The River Stour, somewhat violently passes by this City whence it is, that
our learned Antiquary derives the name, as his manner is, from the British
Durwhern, which is, says he, as much as Fluvius rapidus: Lhuyd before him, and
a natural Britain says, that Dury^hern, in his language was plainly what aqua
ex alueto fluens: but Talbot who was before them both writes, that a Welchman
rendered Darvernum to him, Dour arguern, qu^si Aqua juxta paludem, aut Marisium:
and thence he deduces it.

AD PORTUM RITUPUS. M. P. XII.] And so have we done with this journey. For we
have spoken concerning this station, and haven likewise, somewhat largely in
the head or very beginning of this same journey. If you desire to have more of
it, you had best have recourse thither.

who to make it more ancient, have devis^d that Julius C^sar was the founder of
the Castle there. I have elsewhere taken notice, how the Antiquaries both at
home and abroad, have pleased themselves with ascribing and entitling to him
their stately and magnificent Buildings; when as in the mean while, they have
none the very least authority for it: a thing which neither learned men should
commit themselves, or admit of, done by others. But they, who did this for the
credit and greater fame of Dover, added likewise that Arviragus fortified it
against the Roman power, and particularly against Vespasian: which though it be
probable enough, yet I would be held excused from peremptory delivering any
thing, for which I had not sufficient good authority, and witness from approved
Writers. And especially for Arviragus, I am much at a stand, because I find so
little mention of him, in any Writer, whose word I dare safely take. I hear of
him only by Iuvenal. Sat. 45

think it no better than a dream, to say that Julius Caesar was the founder: yet
he conjectures that it was first built by the Romans, and that by reason of the
British tiles, or bricks, in the Chapel, wherewith they used to lay their
ground-works. That after the times of this Itinerary the Romans had a garrison

this Garrison, were those great Arrows, used to be shot out of a Basilisk, and
now adays showed strangers for rare things, as Camden tells us. But enough of
them. That at Dubris there was Portus, or an Haven to land in Britain in those
days, Antoninus his witness is a sufficient proof After the Romans days, the
Saxons named it Do^a: and hence it is, that you have it constantly called
Dosris in Eadmerus his Historia Novorum, published by the learned Seldom; and
out of the same Monk they bring the reason of the name, quia clau^us and
impeditus erat. But Will. Lambert more probably deduces it from Dusyrrha, which
in British signifies a steep place. Of the later Haven, so many have already
spoken, I may save my self a labor. The steep cliffs there by the Sea side are
called by Cicer. ad Auie. lib. 4. Epist. 16.

For two reasons Antiquity conceited this Sea most dangerous, and unpassable.
First, for the great abundance of huge Sea Monsters, believed to be bred
therein; which not only Lib. 4. Od. 14.
Horace intimates in these words: -- Belluosus, qui remotis
Obstrepit Oceanus Britannis.
The Monster bearing Sea, which roares
About the dangerous British Shoares.

Appian tells us he did Neither did time, or improvement of skill in

reducing a small part of the Island, (which indeed he entered with some
success, but I remember not whether with any danger in the passage:) after his
return, he caused to be placed upon the top of his Palace a Navall Crown, as if
he had tamed and subjugated the Ocean, like another Xerxes, in despite of the
power of God appearing in that fierce Element; for which he is deservedly
scoffed at by Seneca, I^ (...).

But what shall we say to Julius Firmicus, a Christian Writer, (shame on such
flattery:) who would seem to persuade Constans the Emperor, and Constantius
his Brother, that they might expect little less then a Triumph, only for their
bare adventuring over into the Island: Hyeme, Lib. de errore prof^. Religionum

he tells them, (quod nec factum est aliquando, nec fiet: tumentes and

AD PORTUM LEMANIS. M. P. XVI.] Lime, or Limen, was very anciently a Town in
the East part of Kent, and a Haven withal, which Antoninus witnesses, in whom
some read Limenis, as well as Lem^nis, the common reading indeed thereof.
Wherefore Surita's edition is quite faulty, which has AD PONTEM LEMAN. for
PORTUM. The distance from Durovernum, or Canterbury, appears by him to have
been XVI. M. P. And that that way was in Talbots time pulcerri^e strata,
himself bears witness. Neither since him is the learned Ca^den silent thereof.
And they both mention the ruins of an old Castle, the walls of which being of
British bricks, flints, and the cement consisting of Lime, sand and pebles, so
coagmentated, that they seem not to yield to time it self. If in Ptolemy you
find it any where P^lem. Geograph. lib. 2.
it is sure (...); whereof the last word being significative in Greek, besides
that it was the usual name of the place, the Transcriber to supply the defect,
as he thought, devised and added the other Word (...). Although it be the
conjecture of others, that from the very first it was so in Ptolemy, and the
name seeming too long, was afterward made shorter by the first word, it being
called here at first Limen, or Leman, or as some have added Limpne: and of that
intersertion of P. in many Latin words too, as in sumpsit, prompsit, dempsit,
etc. I would have the industrious Reader to look out, what the old Grammarians
have observed. In the declining condition of the Roman Empire in the world
abroad, suitable to Antoninus, ye have it called Lemanna in the Notitia or
Survey of the Western Empire: Sub Dispositione Viri Spectabilis Comitis
Littoris Saxonici per Britanniam Praepositus Numeri Turnacensium Lemannae
stativa habuit: placing it, as indeed it was one, among other the Ports, or
havens of the whole Island then in use. They that render Lomanis, Hith, make
use of a word, that signifies in our forefathers language as much as (...)
does in Greek, a Port, or station for Ships: though there be now none there.
But such it was sometime, as some of our own Writers still extant can make it
good; and I will cite one of the antientest of them, Ethelward; In Limneo poriu
constituunt puppes, Apoldre (so I read, for the Print is corrupted) loco
condicto Orientali Cantiae part, destruuntque ibi prisco opere caestrum
propter quod rustica manus exigua quippe intrinsecus erat, illicque hiberna
castra confirmant. And Henry of Huntington shall follow him, who lands the
Danes (whom Ethelward means) ad Portum Limenecum CCL. navibus, qui porius est
in Orientali part Cent juxta magnum nemius Andredslaige. In which two several
narrations you need not take notice of any difference, more then the
transposition of Letters in the name. But of the amnis Limen out of our
Historians, and the differing relations among them concerning the Danes landing
here in King Alfreds days, as a business beneath the time of my undertaking, I
forbear to speak, commending the curious Reader, for better satisfaction, after
Talbot and those antienter, to what Lamb. Xenogog. Cantiae.
Lambert, and Camden, two most diligent Antiquaries, have to that purpose,
besides that glory of our nation, as Grotius calls him, in this last age, John

which were said in old time to have resided here, were so called of Tornacum, a
City of Gallia Belgica secunda, called at this day Turnay, taken by the English
in our Grandfathers days.

ITER A LONDINIO LUGUVALLO AD VALLUM.] Talbot conceives, that this AD VALLUM
was added by the hand of some Sciolus or Smatterer, seeing it is plain, as he
says, from the second Journey, that the Wall was beyond Luguvallum above XX
miles But by his leave, it was so near unto it, that it may well challenge to
it self the words of the Ael. Sport. in vita Severi Imp.
Historian, being proxima mansi^ to it, and so it will appear to them, who with
their own eyes make a diligent search after the site and distance thereof. But
you must understand me so, as speaking of the more noted and spacious kind of
Stations.

CAESAROMAGO] This station you have again repeated in Antoninus his IX.
Journie, which is described from Venta Icenorum to Londinium. Baromagus is put
in the place thereof in the ancient Itinerary table, which was set forth out of
the Library of Conrad Peutinger. But that came to pass by the heedlesnesse of
the describer, as the noble and learned Qui edidit cum Notis suis.
Velfer, who published it, has rightly observed. For when as he made no good
use of his eyes, and the former letters being blotted, were scarce discernable,
it is plain that he mistook B. for S. that thereby Caesar's City, or Town, is
signified; and that we the rather believe this, Plinies authority causes us,
who not obscurely tells us, that amongst the ancient Gauls, by the word
Magus, a Town was understood: Plin. lib. 3. cap. 16.
Industriam Oppidum ad Bodincum, id est, Padum fl. vetust^ nomine Bodincomagum
appellari, quasi dicas, Oppidum ad Bodincum. And truly in all the Provinces, in
which there was any public use of the Gallique tongue, in the expressing of
the Names of Cities this termination is frequent: which sufficiently shows it
to have been a Gallique word. Although Geo. Rerum Scot. lib. 2. hoc magis
suspicari nos poss quam pro certo affirmare.
Euchanan contend, that we may rather surmise this, then they can for certain
affirm it. To omit the names of Cities abroad, among which The Town of Drusus.
Drusomagus, which we meet withal in Ptolemy, is especially to be observed;
with us are found Noviomagus, Citomagus, besides this Caesaromagus here: all
which names whilst Vitus Hist. Britan. libro 1. n. XIX.
Richard White deduces from Magus, I know not what imaginary King of the Celts,
he would stir the spleen, as well as the Cholar of many, who knew not, that he
held it of custom to dote now and then: so small a matter was it with him still
to have his fancy running upon the Trojan war, except he also bring down our
Britain affairs from beyond Cecrops and the Arcadians themselves. But sober men,
and such as have their eyes open as they know that there were many Cities built
throw the Provinces, for the honor of the Augustaean Name, called Augustae and
Sebastae, of which we have spoken before; so may they learn from the Roman
Historian Suestom. in Augusto cap. 60
Reges amicos atque Socios, and singulos in suo quemque regno, Caesareas urbes
condidisse. And particularly: Festus Ruffus Breviar. ad Valentinian. Im.
In honorem Augusti Caesaris Mazaca civitas Cappadociae maxima Caesarea
cognominabatur: Jornandes, or Jordanus, as others call him, is witness of the
same thing. Cappadoces magnam vivitatem suam Mazacam in honorem [Tiberii]
Caes^saris (i) Libro de Regnorum success.
Caesaream appellave^unt. Tiberius had both Titles, Caesar, and Augustus, as
well as others. And though in the very age of Augustus, not so many (t) as is
observed, so many Casorea urbes are not to be met withal among Geographers,
yet in the following, (l) Is. Casaubon. ad Sweton.
when flattery grew more ripe, many were new built, and new named so: and so it
came to pass, that adding to the name of Caesar, either Dunum, which with the
old Gouls either was as much as Test Plutarcho, sive quis alius auctor est
libri fluminibus.
Collis, or a City set upon a high place; you have Caesaro Dunum: or by putting
thereto Magus, this Casaromagus in this place, and another in Gallia Belgica,
named also by Ptolemy (...), belonging to the Bellovaci. A great argument and
token, that the old language of the Britains was the same with the ancient
Gallique tongue, accordingly as we see learned men are pleased to have it so.

Two excellently learnedly men, and most diligent, in the explaining of the
matters of their own Country, Talbot and Camden do seek for this our
Caesaromagus, according as the ratio Itineraria does require it, yet in several
places: of whom the Talbot. Annot in Itiner. Antonin. MS.
first, believes it was that Town, which now commonly is called Chensford, or
Chernsford. The distance, says he, (for I do not think it much to translate
his words hither, because his Lucubrations upon Antoninus are hitherto
unpublished) very fitly agree; for it is from London by modern computation XXV.
miles, which indeed will make XXVIII. Italick miles (as you have in this
Itinerary) neither does the name very much ablude. And in the IX. journey
Caesaromagus is placed in the way which leads from Colchester to Londinium. But
you will say, who at this day being to take his journey from London to
Carlisle, does choose his course by Chensford? I answer, that perhaps they did
so some times formerly. For also the Kings of Scotland, as we have heard, were
wont to come up to the Parliament here this way, and that they, or some one of
them, built a Covent of the order of Dominicans, or preaching Friars; as they
did also a house of Nuns at Elstow or Elinstow by Bedford. Add moreover,
that the Author of this Itinerary, who ever he was, seems not to have followed
the shortest cuts, and straitest ways, but thereafter as he attended the
Proconsul or Legate, who for his pleasure, or business sake; as, either to hold
Courts of justice, or to list more forces, or sometimes to confirm his
Soldiers, turned aside into greater Towns not quite out of his way; might seem
to have set down those places, through which the Legate, or Propraetor passed.
And this very journey, which we have now in hand, seems to be of such an one:
wherein he rode through Essex, Suffolk, Cambridge-shire and Huntington-shire,
to Lincoln, and thence to York, and so to Carlisle: other wise what meant it,
as it is here, two hundred and fifty miles, more or less? when as in the next
journey to this, from London to Lincoln, there are but an hundred, and fifty.

Wherefore we must confess, by what has been said, that here the Pro-consul,
or what Magistrate soever, took his journey through the Eastern, and more noted
Cities of the Maritine Countries; and so perhaps they used to set forth: but in
the return, they visited the more Mediterranean, or Midland (...)
and Western places: or on the contrary these in their setting forth, the
others in their return. And hence perhaps it is, that in the second journey
between York and London there is so great a distance: a brief and compendium
whereof he sets down afterward; namely in the third journey after this. This
wheeling and fetching compass about, must needs be on this side York and
Lincoln, by reason of the breadth of the Island there, that the people might
more conveniently appear before the Magistrates: beyond York there was no
necessity of it, by reason of the narrowness of the Island in those parts, that
they might meet from both the Seas to some one Town, as Cataractonium, or the
like, without any great grievance of the people. Casaromagus seems to have
signified as much as Caesaris Burgus; as Neomagus in Ptolemy, Novns Burgus;
Rotomagus as much as Rotonis burgus, etc. This I conjecture, but I know not
certain. So far Talbot, whose words I have translated hither, because they seem
to confer much to the explaining of the course of journeying here in Antoninus.

After Talbot, comes Camden in the (...), or former edition, of his great work:
who in the place thereof has Burgsted, Near Billiceray.
that is, Burgi locus: by which name the more ancient places are commonly
expressed, at this day only a Country village, called by the Saxons heretofore
(...) where by Florence of Worcester in the year DCCCXCIV. the Danes are said
to have raised firmam munitionem. But after his second cares, he supposes
Caesaromagus to have been near Brent-wood. Yet himself questions his own
conjecture, because says he, both the numbers in Antoninus are very corrupt,
and because he cannot bring the military way of the Romans, as an argument
thereof: neither remains there any likeness of the name, but very small in
the Hundred of Ceasford, now called Cheasford. Wherefore as in a dead and
forlorn business with age and antiquity, we have nothing that we can ^y for a
certainty; when as this Town perhaps fallen deep into the Earth has lain in the
bowels thereof some Centuries of years. Only may we lament the fate of famous
Cities, whose tops and Towrs age has not only demolished, but sunk them down
deep into the ground; so that coucerning them I may make use of that, which
Demosthenes said of Olynthus, and other neighboring Cities; (...) Apud
Strabon. lib. 2.
That they were so defaced, that if any one came to the places where they
stood, they might call it in question, whether ever men dwelt there, or no: so
true is that, which Rutilius Numatianus in his Itinerary has expressed in
elegant verse: Agnosci nequeunt aevi monimenta prioris,
Grandia consumpsit mania tempus edax.
Non indignemur mort^lia corpora solvi;
Cernimus exemplis oppida posse mori.
For ancient Monuments cannot be known,
Since eating Time devouts great Walls of Stone;
Why should we grieve at this our lives short date,
When Cities be examples of like Fate.


COLONIA M. P. XXIV.] This famous Station named Colonia, is only to be found in
Antoninus, and it differs from Colonia Camolodunum: for you shall have them
both in this same Journey in him. In the last Edition of the Gallique Councels,
set forth by Jaques Sermond the Jesuit, you have among the Subscriptions of the
first Council at Arles Adelphius de civitate Colonia Londinensium; for one of
the Bishops that came out of Britain, and by the learned Vsser. Tractat de
Episcopis, and in Primordiis, etc. p. 195.
Usher Colonia there is thought to be this very Station, or City: but the
incomparable Seldom Comment. in Eutychium page 118.
Seldom rather judges it to be Camolodunum; whom take the pains to consult:
and it will be worth your while. There is a World of Roman Coin found near
about Colchester (for that all our Antiquaries acknowledge to be the place
where Colonia sometime had its being:) a great argument of the flourishing
thereof under the Roman times and Command; yet I hear of none ancienter then
Gallienus; the Tetrici, the Victori^i, ^osthumus, C. Carausius, etc. But its
greatest glory was, that it brought forth Flavia Julia Helena, the Mother of
Constantine the Great. There are those which contend for that, tanquans pro
aris and fo^is; and Galfrid. Mon. lib. 5. Brit. Hist. cap. 6. and ejus seq^.

as her glorious Lipsius in Notis ad Admiranda sua, etc.

others, asserts it to both of them. By the Inscriptions of that age wherein
she lived, we may gather, what opinion and esteem the World had then of her,
for she was called Piissima therein, and Venerabilis Augusta.

Many have thought, that the City it self was called Colchester, from a Colony
in the Roman Time placed there. But no such matter, rather think we it so named
from Coln the River whereon it stands, as many other Towns else, and whence also
we find this of old time written Colon, or Colun.

But of all, we must not once think that this is named (...) in Ptolemie, which
it seems Surita did; for first that was a City of the (...), Damnii, a People
far away remote in the North of the Island: then Ptolemie and other Greek
Writers, when they borow the Latin word Colonis, they commonly spell it by
(...). whenas this is read (...) and no Colony at all.

VILLA FAUSTINI M. P. XXXV.] During the Romans Power and Sway in the Island,
this Station flourished there XXXV. miles beyond Colonia; but in some Copies it
is only XXV. It is not certain in what age, for there is no mention left of it,
but here in Antoninus: and once to imagine, that Villa Faustini in Martial.
lib. 3. Epigram 58.
Martial were meant of it, will be extremely rediculous. It is thought to have
taken up that ground, where at this day the Hourishing Town of S. Edmunds-bury
stands: so heretofore though Talbot, whose opinion our great Antiquary confirms
by the distance thereof, as well from Colonia, as Iciani, the two next Sations
on either side. Abbo Floriacensis, who wrote the life of King Edmund, so foully
murdered by the Danes, calls it Villam Regiam, and King Sigebert built a
Church there; an argument that it was in those times a place of good note: for
as we have formerly noted in several places out of Beda, the Villae Regiae of
the Saxon times had still their abode, where in the former ages the Roman
Stations had been placed. Let us note this after the learned Camden, that the
name of this place was in the Saxons time changed into (...), which the same
Abbo interprets Bederici Cortis, id est, Villa. Now Bederick, as well as
Faustinus in the Latin (it is not known who principally is intended either by
the one, or the other) having the bodement or signification of felicity, or
favor; we may imagine that the Saxon name does but merely render the sense of
the Roman; especially if we believe Hadrianus Junius, who giving a reason of
the name of Bateris the Son of Melon, the Sicambrian (such is the (...) of the
learned man: for in Strabo it is Strabo libro. (...)
(...), that is the Brother:) makes it to mean as much, as felicitate and
favore plenus. Among our Antiquaries I find this Bederics-gueord is severally
written, as Beatrices worth, Beodrices curte. Out of an ancient Apud Seldom
Notis in Eadmerum, ex Schedis Cotton.
Diploma, or Privilege granted in the year M LXXI. to Baldeguinus Abbot of S
Edmunds-bury by PP. Alexander, it is called Badrices hurde. But you shall see
in Weever's Monuments, Budrices Yurthe, out of a In (...). chiv. Turris
Londinens.
Charter of King Knute, and he interprets it Bederics Court, Farm, or
Mansion House: Tantum aevi longinqua valet mutare vetustas
So great mutations works long-aged Time.


The learned Fulk had noted to this place, Halsted: but upon what observation,
or what other reason, I leave to others to find out. But of Villa Faustini,
thus much, and more perhaps then need.

ICIANIS. M. P. XVIII.] Among the many and several people of Britain, in the
Roman time, the Iceni were also reckoned, not only by Antoninus and Ptolemie;
but by Tatit. Annal. lib. 12, and 14.
Tacitus also, who mentions Prasutagus their King; the high undertakings of
whose Queen Dowager Boadicia, he has celebrated with an immortal Pen. A
portion of them these Iciani seem to have been: for there are many relics of
their name in Suffolk, especially Norfolk, both which they are anciently
thought to have inhabited. Among the later of whom this Station is judged to
have had its residence: though Fulk would have had it at Exuey by New Market;
or Hinkson between Cambridge and Walder. But Talbot (...), to use Strabo's
words in the like case, as more conversant and acquainted in these parts; and
so fitter to judge, if he cannot have it at Thetford, he judges it to have
been at Ic-borough near Suaffam: and herein does our Britain Pausanias, Camden,
follow him.

CAMBORICO. M. P. XXXV.] So had all the editions of Antoninus, which I made use
of; that of Aldus, of Simlerus, and Surita; and his written books also, saving
that of Longotius; which had Camboritum; the reading whereof our great
Antiquary had rather follow: for so as he says, very many Towns in Gaul also
were terminated. Now the name it self being interpreted signifies either the
Foard of Came; for so they commonly call that River whereon it stood: but Rith
sounded a Foard to the old Britains: or else it is a winding foard; for that
Hinc Camurum pro eo quod in se recurri^, inter peregrinas voces notas Erasmus.
Came signified also with them. Which the very nature of the place seems to
show, for it was set in the (...), at the very winding and compass of the
River, as Ptolemy speaking of Euphrates; so that it was called Grantcester
afterward by the Saxons, the name being wonderfully changed: it is at this day
a very small village, where I said by the River; yet heretofore reckoned among
the XXVIII. most famous Bed. lib: 1. Hist. Ecclesiast. cap. 1. and H. Huntingd.
Hist. lib. 1.
Cities of Britain, the Catalogue of which Ninnius has written; and wherein it
takes place of London it self. But out of the ruins thereof that Cambridge did
grow, the other ornament of the Island of Britain, or if I should call it the
(...) rather as Synesius elegantly concerning Constantinople; there is no body
a little more then ordinarily versed in humane studies, that is ignorant
thereof. Henr. Huntingdoni^nsis Hist. lib. 1. Granteceastria, quae modo dicitur
Cantebrigia: the name being compounded from Oranta, which the same Author in
the fifth book calls fluvium Cantabrigiae. Therefore this River seems named
Granta, by the Saxons, which in old time was called by the Britains Came. There
is mention thereof in William de Ramsey, Abbat of Crowland, in the life of
Guthlac, thus: Est apud Angligenas a Orontae flumine longo
Orb, per anfractus stagnosos and fluviales,
Circumfusa palus --
Oronta with meandring streams,
Makes many Marshes, Lakes and Fens.


Camden therefore seems, that he would have deduced it from Oron a Saxon word,
which signifies a Fenny or Marshy place: for In vita Regis Alfredi.
Asserius Menevensis, says he, calls the marshy places in Somersetshire once
and again Gronnas paludosissimas, by a Latino-Saxon name: and a City of
West-Friesland, placed in a Marshie Soil, is called Groningen, as is well
known. Venerable Bede says, it was in his time civitatula desolata: Venerunt,
are his words, ad civitatulam quandam desolatam, quae lingua Anglorum
Gratacester vocatur, and mox invenerunt juxta muros civitatis locellum de
marmore albo pulcherime factum, operculo quoque similis lapidis aptissime
tectum. But the Students show also at this day the dwelling of Beda himself at
Cambridge, wherein because afterward there was a Proseucha or Synagogue of
Jews settled there, they name now the Jews House: and yet Beda himself in plain
words writes in his Epitome, which he has joined to his History, that when he
was, annorum septem, cura propinquorum datus educandus reverendissimo Abbati
Benedicto, ac deinde Ceolfrido; cunctumqueex eo tempus vitae in ejusdem
monasterii habitatione peregisse, inter observantiam disciplinae regularis, and
quotidianum cantandi in Ecclesia curam. But concerning the beginnings of the
University of Cambridge (for neither have we any need to have recourse to the
dotages, and fooleries of the Monks) we have the same Beda a most sufficient
witness: Beda Hist. lib. 3. cap. 18.
In these times says he, (about the year of Christ 637.) regno Orientalium
Anglorum, post Corpwaldum Redwaldi successorem, Sigberius frater ejus praefuit,
homo bonus ac religiosus, qui dudum in Gallia, dum inimicitias Redwaldi
fugiens, exularet, lavacrum baptismi percepit, and patriam reversus, ubi regno
potitus est, mox ea quae in Galliis been disposita vidit, imitari cupicus
instituit scholam, inqua pueri literis erudirentur; juvante se Episcopo Felice,
quem de Cantia acceperat, eisque paedagogos and magistros, juxta morem
Cantuariorum praebente. That word pueri in Beda, King Alfred rendered (...) and
(...) men, that is, Boys and young men; or as John Cains interprets it,
discipuli and juvenes. Now whereas Gervase of Tilbury writes that Castrum
Cantabriginse was anciently called Cantabricum, any one might believe that this
name was corrupted, and altered, from Camboricum, who knew not, that the Monks
(such was the acumen of that lurking crew) did deduce it from I cannot tell
what imaginary King of Spain, Cantaber by name. For Camboricum, William Fulk
himself also a Cambridge man, a Divine of great name, besides an Antiquarie, as
Dr. Usher informed me, has not noted down Cambridge, but Comberton, some three
miles thence, for it.

DUROLIPONTE M. P. XXV.] Talbot reads the number otherwise XXVIII. And thinks
it Huntington, for says he, there is Dour and Pons, which declare a place,
where the Water or River was past over with a Bridge. Camden goes a little
further, who thinks it was over against Huntington, and that it had its
original thence; but then he will have the name used in the Romans time to have
been Durosiponte, as if you should say, The bridge at the River Ouse, Use, Ose,
and Ouse being promiscuously used. And he will have the common name used at
this day Goodman Chester, to be read Gormon Chester, from one Gormon a Dane in
King Alfreds days; of whom see the History. The Itinerary distance likes him
well: and the place at this day being famous for nothing more then frequent
tillage, the fields so often broken up afford great store of Roman Coin. In
Huntingtons time it was Villa non inamabilis, and of old time it was nobilis
urbs, as he writes truly.

DUROBRIVAS. M. P. XXXV.] Henry of Huntington in his recension of British
Cities adds six to Ninnius Catalogue, whereof this is one Cair Dorm. id est,
Dormeceastre; quae sita, says he, in Huntedonensi provincia super flumen quod
Vocatur Nen, penitus destructa est. What is left of it at this day, is called
Dornford, near unto Walmsford. This in Camdens judgment is Antoninus his
Durobrivae here, which he interprets Fluminis trajectus: and it shows the
manifest tokens of a ruined City; besides the ancient coin, which are found
here in that abundance, that one would think they had been sowed here. Two
Military Ways, whose Causseys are yet plain to be seen hereabout, whereof the
Erminstreet leads directly from Huntington, as appears by very Ancient
Witness. And it seems, that the old City possessed both banks of the River.
See Camden concerning Caster in the County Northamptonshire, and the reason of
that name.

CAUSENNIS. M. P. XXX.] It is Talbots conjecture, that this Station Causennes,
or Gausennis, gave the name to the hithermost part of Lincolnshire, now called
Casteven: even as Lindsey, another part thereof, has its name from Lindum: but
Camden calls it his opinion; who yet pretends to no certainty of place, or its
ancient standing, except it be at Brigcasterton upon Wash, or Gwash; so making
some affinity of name between the old name of the Station, and the River at
this day. Better, says he, he could not light on at this time; the distance
not gainsaying it: The later name Brigcasterton also, in which as he says,
vetustatis nomen apparet, so called quasi oppidum Castrorum, or, a Castris
dictum, because of a Camp there sometime of the Romans. That Brig in the
beginning thereof denotes the passage of the River there over a Bridge, which
also parted the Roman Military Way. It is believed that the old Gausennae, is
now utterly ruined, at such time as the Picts and Scots plundered the whole
Country about as far as Stanford, as Henry of Huntington is our Author; when
our Hengist with his Anglo-Saxons, with unwearied prowess, and extraordinary
valor, so stopped the course of those outrageous Barbarians, that many of them
being slain, many taken Prisoners, the rest shifted for themselves by flight.

LINDO. M. P. XXVI.] Robert Talbot confesses himself here at a great loss,
about the ancient site of (...), or Lindum, in Ptolomy, who sets it down for a
City of the (...), or Coritavi, and one of them, which by him are called (...).
And no less appears by Antoninus, in whom we have the VI. journey from London
to Lindon, which confirms what Ptolemy says: there is also in him another
City, of the very same name, in the more Northern part of the Island: but of
that in its own place, when we shall come to it. The great doubt of Talbot was
whether of the two he might resolve on; for the old situation of Landum:
Nottingham; or Lincoln, or Lindecoln, as it was most anciently called. But he
rather pitched on the former, thinking that it was Nottingham: and we will
acquaint you with his particular reasons therefore.

First, says he, Nottingham was as ancient as any place of note hereabout; and
may be thought equal with the time of the Robert Talbot Annot. in Antonin.
anecdotis.
Saxons entrance. As for the old Town, whatsoever the name thereof was in old
time, the inhabitants show it, with a well fortified Castle also, a most
certain argument of Antiquity. What ever it was none rather, or more probably,
comes into my thoughts then Lindum. The River which through Nottingham runs
into the Trent is at this day called Lin, or rather Lind; which rising out of
Lindwood, a little above the Village Linsey, by the Priory of Newsted, in a
small Tract of ground, suddenly increased with the sources of many springs,
becomes an handsome River: then running down by Lenton, or Lynton Town,
Nottingham, it is swallowed into the Trent, before it has well finished twelve
miles from the Spring. But by Lenton, I think, says he, that Lindum in this
place is meant: for Nottingham is very near thereunto, so that it may seem
sometimes to have been part thereof: as which at this day is scarce one mile
distant: what if we should say, that the old Town was there; for it is not a
thing unseldome seen, that famous Towns have degenerated into little villages.
And bringing several arguments, for the Antiquity of Lenton, as also of
Nottingham: as that from London to York, no body will choose his road through
Lincoln, but ordinarily through Nottingham. Then that the distance from
Nottingham to York, according to the Itinerary, suits at this day exactly, so
also from Danum, or Dancaster, not amiss: nothing more conveniently: but from
Lincoln to York and D^oaster, it does not hit out so right. Again, by longitude
in Ptolemy, it is plain, that Lindum is not so much stretched out to the East,
as Eboracum. But Lincoln is just so much: but not so Nottingham: now though all
this may be well answered: yet by these arguments, says he si qui (...) mecum
in eam sententiam descenderent, facile adducerer, ui arederem Lindum, de quo
hic and apud Ptolemaeum, fit mentio, esse non quae nunc Lincoln, sed quae
Nottingham; aut quae Lentonvocitatur.

But Camden is none of those, who will come to be of the same opinion with him:
he then places Lindum, or Lincoln, at the Fosse way, where it, and the River
Wytham meet together: the Britains called this City Lynd-coit, from the woody
situation thereof, for which you have it misnamed in Ninnius, Luit-coit. The
Many believed it called Lindum from the River Wytham, which by an antienter
name they say was Lindis: but they have no authority for it of any standing.
With the Saxons it was Vide omnino Galfrid. Monumeth. Hist. Brit. lib. 9. cap.
3.
Lindo-colin (Camden knows not whether a collino situ:) and Lind-cyllan-cea^.
Camden rather deduceth it from Lhin, a British word signifying a Lake: and he
brings many instances of the like. The curious reader perhaps will look for
farther Antiquity: but there is none extant, besides what we have brought: yet
if he please I bring that out of Beda: Beda Eccles. Histor. l. 2. c. 16.
Pradicabat autem Paulinus verbum etiam provinciae Lindisi, qua est prima ad
meridianam Humbri fluminis ripam pertingens usque ad mare. Prafectumque
Lindocolina civitatis, cui nomen erat Blecca, primum cum domo sua convertit ad
Dominum. In qua videlicet civitate, and Ecclesiam operis egregii de lapide
fecit, cujus tecto vel longa incuria vel hostili manu dejecto, parietes
hactenus stare videntur, and omnibus annis aliqua miracula sanitatum in eodem
loco solent ad utilitatem ^orum qui fideliter quaerunt, ostendi. He mentions it
again in the XVIII. chapter: but Beda is beneath that authority which I pretend
to.

SEGELOCIM. M. P. XXIV.] This Station in this Journey is so called; which
elsewhere you have written Agelocum. And this also is noted by Talhot, and
Simler, by reason of the aequi-distance between Lindum and Danum, or Dancaster:
Agelocum therefore is to be reckoned among those words, to which the ancients
sometimes put an S. or Sibilus, sometimes they omitted it. So they called the
Alps, which in Lycophrons Cassandra we find written (...): And they, who are
called (...) Insula by Dionysius the Periegetes, the same in Geogr. lib. 4.
Strabo are (...); lying in the British Sea. Salamantica of Spain, is called by
Polybius (...), and Casars Swessiones, in Ptolemy are (...). To add one Common
Noun out of (...) lib. 1. cap. 7.
Dioscorides, what in Virg. Egloga 5.
Virgils Eglogues is Saliunca, in him is (...); or rather take the whole place
out of him: (...).

In our great Antiquaries judgment, this place possessed the banks of Trent in
Nottinghamshire, where at this day Littleborough (a little Town, but very
ancient) stands, and that upon second cares. At this day it is famous for
nothing more, then for the frequent pass of the River there. That the Romans
held it, there are many things which cause a belief. For the Military Way went
here, and the Tract of the Walls yet appears to be seen, which yet the
Inhabitants, such is their captu^, do think were raised there to keep in the
violence of the River. Then there is so great plenty of Roman Coins in the
neighboring Feilds, that they are often rooted up by the very Swine: whence it
is that they are commonly called Swinepennies. The distance moreover from
Lindum to Agelocum, or Segelocum, makes us not at all to doubt; although the
same learned man write, in the (...) of his Work, or former edition, that it
was Idleton, a Country Village, which is no where else to be found but by the
River Idle; whence also is the Name: And it produced his Conjecture, whereby he
would in Antoninus have Adelocum, restored for Agelocum.

For Agelocum, Aulerton in Sherwood, is the divination of Robert Talbot.
William Fulk, for some small (...), would have it to be Agle, a small Village
not quite VI. whole miles distant from Lindum; when as in Antoninus in any
Copies that are extant of him, Agelocum is from it fourteen miles at least.

DANO. M. P. XXI.] This was that Station, which in after ages was called
Dancaster, and the Name shows as much. It is Talbots conceit, that the Water
which runs here under a stately Bridge, was Ptolemies (...), called by him
Humber: for, says he, the numbers in him of Longitude and Latitude added to
this, and to York, are near the same: then there is none beside hereabout, to
which you may better apply it. I know not this: but I am sure Hieronymus Surita
is wide here, and that very much, who would have (...) of the Durotriges in
Ptolemie, corrected into Danum: as after Antoninus it is also called by the
Notitia Provinciarum Occidentis: where we read: Sub dispositione Viri
spectabilis Ducis Eritanniarum Praesectus Equitum Crispianorum Dano.
Chrispiana, says Pancirolus, is a Town of Pannonia in this Itinerary; whence
these Crispiani may seem to be taken: except, as he thinks, we had better read
for them Chrestini, out of Velferus his old Papers, who are a People of the
Country of Dorilania in Belgica along the Rhine, whence these might easily be
brought hither. In the Learned Doctor Ushers Edition of Ninnius, the old
Britains Catalogue of our Cities, this place is called Cair Daun. Other Writers
will tell you, that in the year Seven hundred fifty nine, it was ruined by fire
from heaven; and from those ruins it has not yet wholly recovered it self. See
those Authors.

LEGEOLIO. M. P. XVI.] We must observe in this place with Talbot, Surita,
Simler, Camden, and others, that this station is in the third Journey after
this called Lagecium. Besides their Authorities, the distance there from Danum
exactly XVI. miles makes it good, and it was at Castleford a Village, Marianus
calls it Casterford, where the very meeting is of Calder and another Stream
called the Ar^. Here are many and manifest remainders of Antiquity: as great
store of Roman Coin found hate, which the common people call Saracens heads,
taken up in a place named Beanfield, from the store of them sowed there by the
Church: I might urge also the distance from Danum and York, between which here
it is placed; to say nothing of its standing by the Military Roman way, and
that Houeden expressly calls it Civitatem, though not as Casar uses the words,
but as it is commonly taken and understood.

Leland, whom Ioannes Balaus Centur. XII. Sect. 62. and 63.
John Bail, Harrison, and Fulk do follow, thought it to have been Po^frel, or
Ponfract: but we let him pass with his conceit. In Josias Simlerus his
Scholia's upon Antoninus, you have it mis-printed Logetium, for Lagecium.

ISU-BRIGANTUM. M. P. XVII.] Some Books have M. P. XVI. which others correct
into M P. XXVI. but amise I think. It is curtailed here for Isurium Brigantum.
We have before said enough of that; we will here say something also of the
people called Brigantes.

The [(...)] Brigantes were a people in Pull. Geograph lib. 2. s^d Br^nia (...)
In^presi Pli^i (...)* men, pro Piolem^, hic ^emere (...).
Ptolemie of the Island Albion, inhabiting from both sides thereof; mentioned
also by Seneca Tacitus, Iuvenal, Pausanias, Antoninus here, and the old
Inscriptions. Hermolaus of Byzantium the Grammarian, who set forth Auctore
Suida.
Stephanus the (...), more contracted, has also in a more contracted word
[(...),] by which he names them: Geo. Buchan rerum Scotic. lib. 2.
George Buchanan says, that the right case of this word in Stephanus is
Brigas, unde inflectimus, says he, Brigantes, ut a biga^ bigantes. In Tacitus
you have in one place. Iugantes, pro Brigantibus, in all the ordinary printed
books, by the same negligence of the Printers, whereby you had formerly
Tigenes, for Icenos, a people likewise among us. His words are these, T^it,
Annal^* 12.
Praecipuus Scienti^ rei militaris Venutius e Iugantum Civitate, ut supra
memoravi, fidusque diu* and Romany armis desensus cum Cartismanduam reginam
matrimonio teneret. Truly it is exceedingly to be grieved at, that so many
books of the Annals of Tacitus are perished, to the great loss not only of our
British Affairs, but also of the Commonwealth of learning; and particularly,
that this place is corrupted, that there is no hope of finding out what we
would but by conjecture. Plainly then, we must restore Brigantum hither out of
him elsewhere: for it is constantly published so by him in all other places.

As for the several Etymons, and Originals of this name* I had rather then say
any thing my self here (for I have ^lse where In Britanniis Romanorum.

Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lanchashire, the Bishopric, and all Yorkshire. I
will set down the Cities, or (...) Ptol.
famous Towns of them, as I find them set down in Ptolemie; the explanation
thereof, you shall have recourse to, in what I have said upon him: in the mean
while briefly thus:

(...). Epiacum. This is remembered only by him.

O^ro Oulo^ Vinnovium. In Antoninus it is Vinoviae, and in some Copies, if not
carrupt, Viconia.

(...). Caturractonium. Cartaractonium, in Antoninus: in the same Antoninus,
and in Beda likewise, Cartaractone.

(...). Calatum. It is named Balacum in Antoninus, or Calcaria, it is not in
the same Itinerary; and Beda, as Humphrey Lhuyd thinks amiss.

(...). Isurium here also mentioned, as also Isuria.

(...). Rigodunum. Camden makes the site hereof to be the same with Coctium in
Antoninus Itin.

(...). Olicana. In other Authors there is no mention thereof to be found.

(...). In Cod. Palatin. test Petro Bertio. ita ert^ and Ferd. Non Pinti^.

(...). Legio Sexta Vitrix. Whence we know it was a Colony. However Editus

S. Aurel. Victor calls it Municipium: Britanniae municipio, says he, cui
Eboraci nomen. The same Ptolomie calls it Ptol. in Camne (...) qui inter
Canonesejus Astronomicos (...) habetur.
elsewhere (...), Evoracum. In the same Author in his P^l. Almagest. lib. 2.
cap. 6.
Great Syntaxis, which the Barborous call the Almagest, it is named (...),
Brigantium; if the Printed book be not corrupted, which Camden very luckily
suspected. It was indeed the head and chief seat (...), that is, of the
Brigantes; but the admired Doctor Usher has taught us that in the Greek MS.
Copy, of the Lambeth Library, the word (...), is altogether wanting, for which
the Latin Translations out of the Arabic have Bericanas; as it shall be
showed in its due place.

Iuvenal the Poet means these Cities by Castella Brigantum, which you shall
find in his fourteenh Satyr in this Verse: Dirue Maurorum attegias, Castella
Brigantum.
The Moorish Huts or British Towers destroy.
For most amend where the old Romans had their Stations, or Castra, there were
Cities and great Towns builded; where also in after ages not only the
British, but the Saxon Kings had their dwellings: as I could plentifully
observe out of Beds, if there were occasion.

The place which is mentioned only taken out of In A^* (...) sive Ludo in
mortem. Cl^dis Imp.
Seneca, I shall think good to bring hither, if it be but to show the several
readings thereof: these then are his words;

Ille Britannos Ultra noti Littora Ponti, Et De nigro, and caeruleo color:
vide Iul. Scaliger. Exercit. 325. Sect. 10. Aliis quoque in locis.
caeruleos Scuta Brigantes Dare Romuleis Colla Catenis Iussit, and ipsum Nova
Romanae Iura securis Tremere Oceanum.
For Scuta Brigantes Joseph (g) Scaliger, that great Dictator in (q) Ad Tibulli
lib. 4. Panegyr. in Messallan and Animadvers. ad Eusebii ann. LX.
Learning, pleases himself wonderfully in reading Scoto-Brigantes; and as his
manner is, slights all the Gainsayers: let the time be when it will, when the
Scoti came first to be made known to the World. He does well indeed to take up
In ipsum locum.
Hadrian Iunius, who has Cute Brigante; against the right reason and
observaoion of quantity of Syllables. Iunius is therein so confident, that he
does take his Oath for the reading: but he has not yet persuaded the learned
World of men to it. For the old reading yet with them takes place: For as
painting their bodies, generally was taken notice of amongst the Britains; so
is it not unlikely that they had also their Bucklers painted, as well as other
Nations: as we read Tatis. lib. de Moribus German.
that the Germans were Scutalectissimis coloribus distringuere soliti, and
amongst them the Ary had tincta corporas and also nigra scuta, and the Labici
are yet known by that place in Virgil. Aeneidos lib. 7.
Virgil: -- Et picti scuta Labici.
And the Bucklers of the painted Labicus.
About these Brigantes here Buchan. Rerum S^tiarum lib. 2.
George Buchanan does notably delirare, as became a man of such imperiousness,
and insolency.

It is not very certain how the Brigantes became first subject to the Romans;
but certain it is, they were often conquered by them. It is worth the while to
consult Tacitus, from whom we have a full relation of their Affairs. They were
doubtless in the defection of Boadicia, and a considerable part among the
Britains in that their revolt. Galgacus the Caledonian in his speech to his men
to animate them against the Romans, shows as much: Tacit. In vita Agricola.
Brigantes, says he, Femina duce exurere Colonias, expugnare castra, and nisi
felicitas in secordiam vertisset, exuere jugum potuere. Now whereas for the
Brigantes in this place, Camden does substitute the Trinobantes, I could wish
that he had not done it against the authority of all books: Galgacus his
meaning is to incite his Caledonians to Valor, and the study of liberty, by
the example of other Britains, all whom he calls Brigantes, who were better
known to his men, being a great deal the nearest unto them, and the most
populous people of the whole Island. But they were not wholly subdued till
Vespasians time, as we find by the same Author; when Petilius Cerealis fought
against them multa praelia, and aliquando non incruentia; magnamque Brigantum
partem aut victoria amplexus aut bello.

In Hadrinans days, therefore a main defection of all the Britains happened out.
Now if there be any place for conjecture, the (x) Aelius Spartian. in Hadriano,
Brigantes seem to have revolted, when Julius Severus was called out of
Britain, where he was President to go against the Jews, who then also
rebelled. Dio, or rather Xiphilin out of him, is our Author for it: (...). But
finally Hadrian himself in person came hither, who conversis, regio more
militibus Britanniam petiit: in qua multa correxit, murumque per octoginta
millia passuum primus duxit, qui Barbaros Romanosque divideret. Et compositis
in Britannia rebus, in Galliam transgressus est, as Spartianus writes. And in
our days too there are extant, taken up amongst the Brigantes, very many
Antiquities which speak Hadrians being here, and his doing many things amongst
them. Yet though subdued by him, they took Heart again, and as the Poets say,
victis redit in praecordia virtus: for under Antoninus Pius they overran
Gen^ia, an associat Country here of the Romans: but were again brought under
by his Legate here (it should seem Lollius Urbicus:) and lost part of their
own Territories. This is witnessed by a good Pausanias (...).
Writer of those times: (...).

There are many other things of Antiquity, which I might set down concerning
the Brigantes; as of their Nymph Verbeia, and their Topic God Dui: but as I
said, I will refer the Reader to my other Work which I have inscribed
BRITANNIAE ROMANORUM, where I have at large treated of them.

The other Stations of this Journey are formerly sufficiently spoken of in
their places: only here let me tell you, that Brocavio would better be Brovo,
as being abbreviated for Brovonacis, which you have in the second Journey.

In the next Journey to this, which is from London to Lindum, or Lincoln, you
have the way more contracted a great deal: thus then it is, as you see it
represented to your eyes in what follows.

THese five first Stations here, even to Pro Codda varietate, Isannavantio.
Isannavaria.
Isannavatia (which is altogether the same with Bennavenna.) you have before
explained in the second Journey, but converso Itinere, the way lying there
backward. Here at Vennonis there is a diversion from the public way, which
they call Watling-street. See Talbot in VENNONIS. But whereas in this Journey
between Isannavatia, or Bennavenna, and Vennonis, you see Tripontium put
between, that indeed is done as Camden thinks, loco non suo, out of its right
place. But see also Talbot in BENNAVENNA.

ISANNAVATIA. M. P. XII.] Go to BENNAVENNA, which seems to be the very same
Station or City with it.

TRIPONTIUM. M. P. XII.] Hierom Surita shows himself a stranger indeed to our
affairs, when he makes but so much as a doubt, whether Ptol. Geograph. lib. 2.
Ptolemies (...), an ancient City of the Selgovae here, had any thing to do in
this place. Camden supposes it to be that which now we call Torcester: and
that he has remaining for it such arguments, as are not languidae fidei. For
says he, if Trimontium a City of Thrace had its name, a tribus montibus; if
Triturrita of Hetruria, a tribus turribus: if Tripolis, a tribus urbibus: then
this Tripontium without doubt is denominated a tribus pontibus; as it may
plainly be seen also to this day: here may also be seen the Praetorian, or
Military Highway, which in very many places between this Town and Lactorodum
Stony-Stratford shows it self. Marianus Scotus has this Towns name written
Tovecester: and indeed there want not many who would have the Town called so,
from the Tove running by it.

Age and time have at length so wasted it, that now at length it owes to its
situation, name, and ancient Coyns, that it is believed that it is old. Of them
indeed there have been some good store taken up there.

VENNONIM. M. P. IX.] This is spoken to in the Second Journey already, to which
you may have a recourse:

RATIS. M. P. XII.] Leicester, called also by ancient Writers, and in old
Records, Legracester, Legecester, Legeocester, Leogora and Caer-Lerion, so
called, not of that fabulous King Leir, whom Geffrey of Galfr. Mon. lib. 1.
Hist. c. 15.
Monmouth will have to be the first Builder thereof, but for that it stands
upon the River Legra, or Leir, now called Sore; as Leland Colle^. 2. T. 323.
Leland holds, signifying as much as the City standing upon the River Leir.
Many other Cities and places in this land are so denominated, as Colchester,
upon the River Colne, Lancaster upon the River Lune, Riblechester, upon the
River Rible. It stands in the Center and heart of the Shire (as I have said
before:) bearing the proportion of an heart, and being in the very midst and
heart of the land, as by all Writers, and by the Topography thereof, it does
appear, and upon the great Rode-way called the Fosse, (as Ranulph Higden
affirms) which goes from the South into the North, which begins at Totness
in Devonshire, and ends at Catness in the utmost part of Scotland. It is
situated in a most rich, delicate, and pleasant soil, and a delicious air, and
(whether you respect health or wealth, pleasure or profit:) it is in this place
afforded. To parallel it with other Cities is not my purpose, but had it a
Navigable River, whereby it might have trading and commerce; it might compare
with many of no mean rank. For the antiquity thereof, I shall speak what I have
either read, or found in the best and most approved Writers. That this was a
City in the Britains time before the coming of the Romans, I should conjecture
by the name thereof, set down by Ninnius in his Catalogue of Cities, viz. Caer
Lerion: that is, the City upon Leir, What the name was in the Romans time, I
must assent unto Master Camden Clarenc^ux his opinion, who takes it to be
Prolemeo in Cori^ (...) altera. Talbotus ait se vidisse codicem in quo Ratae
haberctur. Certe Petrus Bertius ex cod. Palatino (...) mendose omnino edidit.
Ratae, induced thereunto, first by the situation thereof upon the said great
Rode-way, called the Fosse, the distance from Bennones, and Vernomet, agreeing
so justly with the Emperor Antonine in his Itinerarium, and a piece of the
name yet remaining in that old long Ditch and rampire called Radikes. That this
his assertion should stand probable and true, and that this was a great Roman
Station, these Roman Antiquities (here found and affirmed) will give strength
and confirmation. First, the ancient Temple here dedicated to Janus, which had
a Flamen or High Priest here resident, in which place great store of bones of
beasts (which here have been sacrificed) have been dug up and found and the
place yet called thereof, the Holy bones, which all Histories do agree to have
been here, and surely was the foundation of the Romans, as appears by their
God Janus Bisrous to whose honor the first Temple was built in Rome, by
Romulus and Tatius, or, ^s others say, Numa Pompilius, in a place called
Argiletum; and not founded by that feigned King Leir, to the honor of Janus,
as Geffrey of Monmouth, and (of later days) John Harding and John Reut of
Warwick will have it; which how fabulous and improbable it is any ordinary
capacity may conceive, in that it is known to all, that Janus was not adored or
thought of ever of any but the Romans. And this King Lier died (at least three
hundred years before Rome was built, as by their own Chronology and Computation
will appear. But this and many such improbabilities and contradictions, will
easily convince this forged History of Brute, and of his progeny.

Next the many Roman Antiquities here found, their Medaglies and Coyns in great
abundance, both in silver and Copper; of Vespasian, Domitian, Trajan, Hadrian,
Antonine, and others, which I my self have seen, and have of them. And within
these ten years, near unto the Town, somewhat deep in the ground, was found a
piece of Work of stone arched over; the stones very small, about an inch long,
and half an inch broad and thick, finely joined together with a thin mortar. It
was in length about five or six yards, in breadth about four, the roof covered
with a square kind of quarry with small Earthen Pipes therein. This I guess to
be a Stouphe or hot-house to bath in, for as Vitrivius writes, the Romans
growing to the excess of riotousnesse and excess, through the abundance of
their wealth, used these kind of Bathes in a wantonness to purge and clarify
themselves. All this hitherto has been transcribed out of the exact
Description of Lestershire, so far as it conduced to my present drift and
institutum. We shall also do the like in what follows to the next Station. If
we had known that the places about Lester had abounded with Fern, we would
presently have concluded, that the name RATAE had been from RATIS; (...).
which Dioscorides says in the old Gallick Tongue (and so consequently in that
of the Britains:) signified just as much. The good Readers I hope will excuse
this observation, who also know, that lame men, though they be never so much

any discovers, though never so studious and desirous thereof. Let those tell
us here of Rateford in Nottinghamshire, or Rutland, look well to their
Arguments, why they do it.

VEROMETUM M. P. XIII.] Master William Burton, the restorer of his own Country
and the antiquities thereof, in his exact description of Lestershire. page 62.

Burrow, anciently called Erdburrow, standing near to the confines of
Rutlandshire. Master Camden does conjecture that this place should be that
Vernometum, mentioned by Antonine the Emperor in his Itinerarium, by reason of
the true distance between Ratae and Vernometum; And (his words be these) the
name of Burrow also that it has at this day, came from (...), which An ancient
Roman Fort.
in the Saxon Tongue signifies a place fortified, and under it is a Town
called Burrow, belonging to an old Family of Gentlemen so surnamed. But (that
which makes most for the proof) in that very place there rises up an Hill,
with a steep and upright ascent on every side, but, South-eastward; in the top
whereof appear the express tokens of a Town destroyed, a double Trench, and the
very Tract where the Walls went, which enclosed about 18. Acres within, at this
day it is arable ground, and in nothing so famous as in this, that the Youths
dwelling near thereto were wont yearly to exercise themselves in wrestlings and
other sports in this place. And out of the very name a man may conjecture that
there stood some great Temple of the Heathen Gods; for the word Vernometum in
the old Gauls Vide Christopherum Boverum in Notis.
language (which was the same with the old Britains tongue) signifies as much
as a great Temple, as Venantius Fortunatus in his first book of his Songs does
show, writing of Vernometum a Town of Gaul in these verses. Nomine Vernometum
voluit vocitare vetustas,
Quod quasi fanum ingens Gallica lingua sonat.
Of old the place they Vernomet did name,
Which signifies among the Gauls a Fane.


In elder times, this place they termed by the name of Vernomet, which sounds
in the language of the Gauls as much as a Temple great. Thus far the diligence,
and the great ornament of his Country, William Burton Esquire of Linley; who
though now with God, has left the heir of his virtues, as well as other
fortunes, Cassibbelaun Burton, Esquire.

MARGIDUNUM. M. P. XIII.] Where Lincolnshire borders upon Liecestershire, there
stands Be^vior or Beauvior Castle, not far from whence, as our great Antiquary
thought, stood the Roman Station Margidunum in old time, in a most pleasant and
fruitful Soil. This the distance from Vernometum to which it stands next in
Antoninus, having Ad Pontem, or Paunton, also at not an unlike remoteness from
what is set down there, gives good credit unto. From the Marga, or Marle, and
its site upon a rising hill, its seems to have had its denomination. For the
later, I have several times taught out of Plutarch what Dunum signifies, namely
a rising place. As for the other word Marga, (...).
Plin. 17. cap. 6. cujus illud est lem^a.
Pliny in his Natural History tells us what it is there where he treats De
terra quam Britannia and Gallia amat. Alia est ratio, says he, quam Britannia
and Gallia invenere, alere eam ipsae quod genus vocant Margam. But Camden
speaks of little use of Marle in those parts: he indeed tells us of a kind of
Chalk found * A kind of plaistering stuff, gypsum.
near there; in which perhaps Pliny might be mistaken, for his Margu: else he
thinks it was never well searched for there. There is found there about also the
stone called from its figure (...), Astroites, the form of which Camden
describes, after Georg. Agricola Fos^um lib. 6.
Agricola and others: but I Will meddle not with it, as being nothing to my
present design in hand.

AD PONTEM. M. P. VII.] That it was that Town of Lincolnshire, which on the
banks of the River Wytham is yet called Paunton to this day, our Antiquaries do
generally believe For to say nothing of the distance from the two stations on
either hand, which very well agree with that at present, the reason of the name
from a Bridge (for the River) according to the report of the Inhabitants was
here in old time joined with the Bridge:) clearly evinceth the matter in hand:
not to say that Pavimenta tessell^ Vide Scalig^n Sphaeram Barbaricam M. (...)
pa. 454. Ald. editio Antonini corrects.
pavements of the Romans of Musive Work are sometimes dug up here. Wherefore
Aldus his Edition of Antoninus may be observed, where ye find it falsely
printed, Ad Pontum. Josias Simlerus in his Scholia upon Antoninus would have
this Town to have been otherwise called Pons Aelii, where sub Duce Notitia
Occidental. Imperii.
Britanniarum Tribunis Cohortis I. Cornaviorum kept his Guard: which Station
being long before first appointed by Hadrian the Emperor, was to be sought far
away off, by the Vallum. Him yet our Harrison follows, who has described unto
us Britain in English. William Fulk would have it to be rather Boston, that is,
S. Buttolphes Town in this same Shire; though the Itinerary account do wholly
reclaim, and gainsay it; as being nearer to the Eastern Sea.

CROCOCALANA. M. P. VII.] In the diverse readings collected to Antoninus there
is Crorolana set down, which in very deed signifies nothing and might a great
deal better have been quite left out. In Antoninus that Town is called so;
which at this day is Ancaster, nothing but a long street upon the Military
Highway. At the entrance from the South our Antiquarie says, he saw a Trench,
and it is evident that there was a castle about there. The British or old name
may seem to have been taken from the situation; for it lies under the side of
an hill; and Cruc M^ur with the Britains does signify magnum collem or a great
Hill; as Cruc Occhidient does a Western Hill, as we are taught by Giraldus
Cambrensis, and Ninnius very ancient Writers. But what shall we do then with
Colana? Camden our Antiquary knew not: neither have we time to think of it, as
we should: if we truly understood the meaning of (...) of Ptol. Geogr. lib. 2.
Ptolemy in the North of Britain, we should also better know this. In this Town
the Roman coyns keep up the Memory of Antiquity therein; besides the vaults
under ground, sometimes opened: to say nothing of the site by the Praetorian
Causey or Highway, and due distance between it and Lindum or Lincoln. William
Harrison Harris. Deser. Britan. lib. 12. cap. 17.
says Ancaster has been a great thing, for many square and colored
pavements, vaults, and arches are yet found, and often laid open by such as dig
and plow in the fields about the same, and among these one Vresby or Roseby a
Ploughman did erd up not long since a stone like a trough covered with another
stone, wherein was great abundance of the aforesaid Coins. The like also was
seen not forty years ago about Grantham.

LINDUM. M. P. XII.] Camden from the foregoing Station seems to have read the
distance to Lindum XIV. miles; and that where he speaks of Ancaster where the
foregoing Station had its being. Something is said, and perhaps more then
enough, concerning this Lindum in the former Journey.

THis seventh Journey is from Regnum in Hantshire to London: Hierom Surita
speaking of which, confesses indeed that the (...), Regni were a people of
Britain, bordering upon the Atrebatri and Cantii; whose chief City was
Noviomagus: but that by this Regnum it is to be understood, I can by no means
hold with him. Camden resolves the business very well, where he makes the
Midland of this shire to belong to the Belgae, as he does the more Maritime to
the Regni. That therefore this Regnnum belonged in old time to the Regni, is
most plain; the relics of the one name still remaining in the other. Our
Ancesters called it Regnewood or Ringwood, it seems for the Store of wood
thereabout. In Doomesday book it is written Rincewed.

CLAUSENTUM. M. P. XX.] Opposite to the Isle of Wight, in Southampton Port of
Haven, called of old by Ptolemy (...). Ptol.
Trisantonis fluvii ostium; from Traithanton, as I think, says our great
Antiquarie, that is Aestuar^um Anton. By the same name almost it is called by
Ninnius Trahannoni ostium. The river that runs into it at this day called Test,
in former ages, in the Saints lives, is named Ierstan, and formerly that it was
Ant, or Anton: Antport, Andover, and Hanton, Towns lying thereon, seem in a
manner to persuade. Sofar are we from believing, that it was so named from
Hammon the Roman, whom our British History fables to be slain hereabout by
Arviragus, as do also all such as follow and admire it.

Not far from this southampton, was Clausentum here placed, which appears by
its distance from Regnum, as also on the other fide from Venta, or Winchester,
and as of old time it was called Antoni Aestuarium, so Clausentum signified in
British the Port Entum; which, as I am told, signifies as much as in Greek
Portus effossa terra extructus.
(...) does mean. They that make any wonder at this let them also look into
Dooms-day-book, where they shall expressly find Hantscyre, and Hentscyre; from
whence the Town, from the Southernly situation is at this day Southanton. It
was seated especially where S. Martha's fields now are. What rubbish, ruins of
Walls, and Trenches Camden was showed there by an old Castle, himself will best
tell you. Whether it were the Castle of old time belonging to Clausentum, I
have not any thing to say: the several Coyns of the Roman Emperors taken up
hereabout are sufficient witnesses of its great antiquity. If those ruins which
Camden speaks of, were not of the old Castle; they were doubtlesly of those
muniments, and bull works, quae Romani in littore Oceani ad meridianam plag^, as
Gildas has it: ad reprimendas piraticas Saxonum depraedutiones collocarunt.

VENTA BELGARUM. M. P. X.] There were three Towns in Britain of this name
Venta, all mentioned by Antoninus, and this by Ptolemy also. Venta Icenorum is
in (a) Ptolemy too; were Ptol. Geograph. lib. 2.
but his Copies rightly published. The common books have (...), for Iceni: but
the Palatine set forth by Petrus Bertius, nearer the truth, (...). Caer-Guent
it was called by the Britains: which Leland makes to signify White, as if he
would say, The White City: of which there wants not examples: and this stands
in a whitish or chalkish soil, as do the rest they say elsewhere that are of
that name too.

After the Christian time, from this Venta in the most ancient Monks we find
the Bishop of Winchester called Episcopus Ventanus or Wentanus, as Beda,
Malmesburionsis, Eadmerus, and others: only the less experienced must take heed
when he meets with this word Vt apud Malmsb. de Gest. Pontif. lib. 1. page 117.
Venlanus misprinted for it, as he shall sometimes.

A City no doubt it was of very great request in the Romans time, which we
learn from the Notitia of the Western Empire, for here was resident in this
place the Procurator Gynaecii Britannis, (b) Edit. Land. and alibi.
(not Dremtensis, or Biennensis: but as it should be:) Ventensis. So the Ita

these Gynaecia were first appointed texendis Principis militumque vestibus,
naviumque velis, stragulis linteis and aliis ad instruendas mansiones
necessariis.

Yet Wolsangus Comm. de Republic. Romana.
Lazius, a learned German in his time, thought that these Procurators also were
employed in taking care, and making provision for the Emperors dogs: for the
Britist dogs carried away the Bell in those days from those of any other
nation in Europe. Strabo gives us good cause to say so, for they have his
commendation for hunting; being said by him to be, (...). Hence it is that the
Shepherd says in Nemes. in Eclogis.

Meaning our British Dogs. Of which long before him it is worth the while to
peruse an excellent trim Poem, written in Augustus age by Gratius Faliscus, who
intitles it Cunegeticon, published of late years by an excellently learned
Gentleman; and accordingly it is set forth in Latin by him, and translated also
into English. Quid freta si Morinum, dubio refluentia Ponte,

Si non ad speciem mentitur osque decores:

Et vocat extremo praeceps discrimine Mavors,
Non tunc egrogios tantum admirere Molossos;
Comparat his versuta suas Athamania frauds,
Acyrusque, Pheraeque, and clandestinus Acarnan.
Sicut Acarnanes subierunt pralia furto:
Sic canis illa suos taciturna supervenit hosts.
Would thou Morinum seek? and thee 'twould please
Britain to enter through uncertain Seas.
What profit there, what benefit would rise?
Would thou not choose for beauty and for size?
Both which they want; yet this the Britains boast,
In greatest need their dogs show valor most;
And will his life forsake ere he retire,
Not then Mollosian hounds thou will admire,
Sly Athaman Dogs, with Mastives not compare,
Acgran, Pheran, nor the close Acare
As the Acarnans steal in to battle, so
This breed with silence sets upon their Foe.


This is that Gratius, whom Ovid his Co-temporary thought worthy to commend to
Posterity, and prolong his fame in that Ovid. de Ponto lib. 4. Eleg. 16.
verse: Aptaqu^ venanti Gratius arma dabit.
Gratius for Hunting will accommodate.

brag of at Rome, and which he says were showed at the Circensian Games, to the
great wonder of the people that looked upon them; who could not think them
brought thither otherwise, then in Iron Cages.

In this City, as our own Historians relate, was that Monk Constans in the
Roman time, whom his Father Constantinus, who had put on the Purple against
Honorius, out of a mere conceit and confidence of his own name, had designed
first to be Caesar, and afterward Augustus: For, for a good while before this,
as Zosimus has it, speaking of that very time the Monks had frequent
Colleges, as well in Cities as Country Towns, who lived before lurking up and
down, and haunted Mountains, Woods, and solitary places forlorn, whence also
they had their name. Now those ancient remainders of Walls which are yet to be
seen of such a thickness, and lastingness, at the Western-door of the
Cathedral, seem to have been the ruins of that College. As for that
Caesarean Monk brought out hence, he soon by death satisfied for his Fathers
ambition, and slighted Religion.

Here many will tell you of King Arthurs round Table; but our Antiquary finds
it to be of a far lower age: not but that he acknowledges the use of such
Tables among the Ancients for avoiding b^oyles, and fallings out among them.
And this he might well do upon the Testimony of Athen^ Dipnosophist. lib. 4.
Athenaus: for out of him you may learn that the ancient Gauls, and so
consequently the old Britains, for they promiscuously used the same Instituta
as well as Sacra did sit about circular or round Tables, and that as Esquires,
or Armour-bearers waited on them behind their backs, bearing their Shields by
them.

The Ecclesiastical antiquity of this City belonging especially to the Saxon
time, is beside my purpose, and so as he said, Blandius est nostrum opus. Yet
having long ago transcribed from the Walls of Estiar House, sometimes belonging
to the Bishops of the Sea; a Catalogue of their names as they were set up a
long time since, by the Courtesy of my very good Friend Mr. George Price, whose
House now it is, himself being then Sheriff of the County of Surrey. Take this
therefore instead of a great deal more, which I could say, but that my present
design and project excuses me, and bids me have done with the Roman Age.

I had quite done with Winchester, as with the Bishops thereof, in whose
Catalogue I observed some difference from others published, with the addition
of the Insignia gentilitia of some more noted Families: but that the misplacing
of Venta Belgarum by some of our Antiquaries, according as my manner is first
to be taken notice of: Bishop Cooper therefore is much over-seen, who deceived
by Joannes Balaeus, or Leland himself, it matters not much, sets down for it
Bristoll the City, which is of much later antiquity, and has given occasion
to others to err: among whom, Pitseus is one, in case he drew not his mistake
from Balaeus self, which is most like: as for the Continuer of Thuanus his
History I know not well what to say; in whom also we as falsely read Eundem

CALLEVA ATREBATUM. M. P. XXII.] This was a principal City of Britain, when
the Romans were Lords of all here, mention of it is made in this Itinerary at
least four times; first in this seventh Journey from Regnum to Londinium, where
in Longolius his book it was called Galleva, or Gallena: Hier. Surita test.
At Rebatum rather, from the people it stood amongst: Then in a double Journey,
yet in both through distinct Mansions, or Stations, from Isca. Leg. 11. Aug. or
Caer legion upon U^k, unto it, whence it is manifest that it was a City; such
as Saint D. Ambros. V. Sermon. in Psalm. 118.
Ambrose calls Regales Urbes; ad quas cum perventum est, fessis exercitibus
requies ministratur. Lastly, in the last Journey here from the same Calleva to
the other Isca Dumnoniorum, or Excester. The (...), are indeed in Abion, or
Britain, mentioned by Ptolemy, and others, named Altrebates here, whose City is
corruptly in the later Greek books, named (...), and so in the Translations
thence: for in the ancient Latin Interpreter, it is turned Calleva; certainly
in the Palatine book it was written (...), by the Testimony of Petrus Bertius:
herein truly the vestigia of the old reading do more appear Joannes Balaeus,
who after Leland seemed especially to have illustrated the matters of Britain,
acknowledges the reading in Antoninus, yet retains Callena, in Ptolemy, and
deriveth the name from that Olenus Calonus, whom Plin. (...). Hist. lib. 28.
Pliny calls Hetruriae celeberrimum vatem. Istum in Britanniam, says Balaeus,
venisse quidem ferunt, and de suo cognomine urbem condidisse Calenam, quae nunc
Oxonia dicitur, antiquo nomine mutato. He cites moreover his good friend Conrad
Gesner about this very matter, in whom he had read in his Onomasticon: Calena
apud Ptolem cum civitas, in Anglia esse creditur, quae nunc Oxonia appellatur.
Gesner therein indeed seems to have followed Sir Thomas Eliot in his
Bibliotheca or Dictionary, who had said that Callena was Oxford: which thing
troubled John Cains the Antiquary of Cambridge, that some of Oxf^d had before
his time published so much in Lex^cis (he besides this Sir Thomas Eliot,
especially m^ans Thomas Cooper, at that time Dean of Christ Church in Oxford,
afterward Bishop of Winchester, who had enlarged and published the others

Jaannes Pitseus treading in his steps, who not content with him, to deliver a
matter from the uncertain report of men, namely that Calena was built by this
Olenus: lest he might seem to have said but little, he adds of his own, that he
quite finished it, and that this place was known by the name of Calena, till
the entrance of the Anglo-Saxons. But this to me is very wounderful, that he
would not dissent from Balaus, which he seems otherwise upon all occasions
willing to do, even when especially he borrows what he says well out of him:
so great was his despite against him, merely because he was Sacerdos Maritatus,
which forsooth he cannot name without a Sa-Reverence: yet the sagacious man
might with as easy a conjecture have deduced it from Julius Calenus the

who yet always had a very great cognation with the Galli, not only in
language, but in holy Rites and Customs also: which we could easily make
appear, were there but occasion. But sure this quaint Lawyer, as fine a man as
they thought him at Doway, was mistaken much, if he expected a reward for this
rare piece of Antiquity from the Oxford men, who well enough knew how much Gold
differed from any forged stuff. Thinking of this their near relation, there
came a place of Caesari into my mind, which because I let slip to the Belgae in
the last station, I will by no means let it pass in this to the Atrebates.
Caesar. de b^l. Gal. Com. 4.
Maritima pars ab iis incolitur qui pr^da, ac belli inserendi causa, ex Belgeo
transierant, qui omnes fore iis nominibus civitatum appellantur, quibus orti ex
civitatibus eo pervenerunt, and bello illato ibi remanserunt, atque agros
colere coeperunt. Which truly is plainly seen in so many people, and Towns of
Gaul, as well as Britain of the same name; as the Parisi, Condate, Casaromagus,
Noviomagus, Brige, Pontes, Mediolanum, and others; to be found in P^my and
Antoninus too. But let us seek farther for the true site of Gallena. Defens.
Hist. Britan. cap. 8.
Sir John Price, a noble Gentleman, and an earnest Defender of his Country
antiquity, thinks indeed that Caleva Atrebatum was Oxford, aut aliud circitur
eo loci oppidum suisse; the which thing because he affirms but very faintly,
let us therefore hear his Country man, Fragment. de sent. Britan.
Humfrey Lhuyd. who writes that Wallingford, eleven miles distant from Oxford,
does possess that place, whereon of old Galeva sometimes stood. Neque enim
illis astipulari possum, says he, qui Oxoniam ad Septentrionalem Tamesis ripam
Calevam faciunt. Alexander Nevil, and Camden himself follows him: for neither
could the Itineraria ratio stand otherwise good. He teaches us also, that in
Antoninus of old it was written Gallena, from Gual-Hen, which signified in
British as much as Antiquum Vallum. Since the change of G. into C. was easy,
they being sororiae litterae, as they say, that is Sister-Letters. Hence by our
Forefathers, the word Ford, by reason of the vadosity of the River there,
being added, was made (...) and (...): now more contractedly among us
Wallengford. But why do we not hear himself: I will give you his own words:

munitum, ut inexsuperabilis munimenti spes quosdam ferociores fecerit.

where he tells how William the Norman, having conquered Harold, led his army
thereunto. Our great Antiquary produces a silver coin, whence some luster may
perhaps accrue unto this place: REX CALL
obverse side of a coin reverse side of a coin

He imagines therein, that that CALL does come nearest to the name of Callena,
or Gallena, as he reads it, the frequented and famous station of old time. But
that REX may be referred to Comius, whom De bello Gallico lib. IV. Vide etiam
nummum, quem adduximus ad Caesa em in BRITANNIS ROMAN.
Caesar had made King over the Atrebates in Gallia, of whom, as it is said,
ours were deduced, and cum Legatis civitatum Britannorum, quod sibi ^idelem

authority: as for Pitseus who talks of Calena built in King Arviragus days,
we weigh him not; when he can better inform us concerning his reign, we will
heed him.

At Sinodun hill, not far from Gallena, its certain, there was a fortress of
the Romans; for they take up coin there very often.

PONTES. M. P. XXII.] A few miles from Eaton, the River Cole runs into the
Thames, parting Bu kinghamshire and Middlesex at Colebrook, where it bestows
the name upon it; which that it was Antoninus his Pontes, the distance on both
sides from Wallenford and London, do persuade. Neither is there any place in
that Rode, which may more conveniently suite to this name: for Cole here is
parted into four Channels, laid over with so many bridges, for the convenience
of traveling: we need not instance about the same business in (...) Vrb^

many seek Pontes at Reading: but besides that the distance here will not so
well fit, I do no more believe them, then I do admire their skill in Greek, who

LONDINIUM. M. P. XXII.] They who know at this day the count of miles between
London and Colebrook to be but fifteen miles, will sure wonder at this number
here XXII. In the mean while never thinking of the shortness of the ancient
Italick miles: so that it seems the kind Citizens of London, when good men!
they carried their wives abroad into the Country to air them, gave not first
occasion to observe that the miles about London were not so long as elsewhere.

THis Eight Journey is from Eburacum to London, not indeed altogether by the
same Stations, until you come to Vennonis, by which you see it expressed in the
second. For there indeed the Author of the Itinerary wheels about, and takes a
circuit, according as the occasions of the Legate or Propraetor, or whoever the
chief Magistrate was then in command, seemed at that time to require: but here
he follows the shorter cut of ways, beginning his journey with Lagecium; which
Town in the fifth Journey is called by him Legeolium, and is just at the same
distance, from York, that is XXI. M. P. Thence to Danum, and Agelocum, which
also in the fifth Journey is called Segelocum, which is distant too from Danum
twenty one miles, just as we see it here set down. The other mansions of this
Journey you have explained in the fifth and sixth Journeys, as far as Vennonis,
as I said, where the Fosse a public rode crosses the Watling-street, by which
turn this way goes strait to London as you see in what follows; only passing by
two Mansions unnamed (it should seem for speed and have sake, Lactorodo and
Sulloniacis:) but the account of the numbers of miles being kept entire, as in
that other.

MARGIDUNUM. M. P. XIV.] This Station is quite wanting here in the printed
Edition of A^us; as also in some Copies which Ierom Surita made use of: for
that somewhere Margitudis is put in by him, out of others, in what goes before,
it is just as much as nothing: and so much seemed requisite to be said
concerning the Eighth Journey; but that here also is B^nnavantum, or
Bennaventum; for what was before Bennavenna, and Isannavatio.

THis Journey is from Venta Icenorum or Caster, to London, some three miles
distant from Norwich; which place was so named from the Castra, or Camps, of
the Romans sometimes hereabouts; and not as the Cambridge Io. Caius Antiq.
Cantabr. lib. (...).
Antiquary writes from Castor a King here placed by Julius Caesar. In Surita's
MSS. and those Printed Copies of Antoninus, which we use, it is read Icinorum:
yet he following Tacitus, rather, and others, mends Ptolemy, making (...) to be
(...). For it seems not likely to him, that Ptolemy who wrote down the several
names of the Countries, Cities, Rivers, Ports, Promontories, etc. throughout all
Britain, should leave out so powerful a people, as the Iceni are said to be.
Tacitus: Tac. Annal. lib. 12.
Quod primi Iceni abnuere, valida gens nec praeliis concussa, quia societatem
nostram volentes accesserant. And a little after; Caterum clade Icenorum

and Tacit.
Tigeni in Tacitus his old Copies, to borrow his words elsewhere, pacem
exuebant magis nostra avaritia, quam obsequi impatientes, as plainly he shows
in his relation concerning them: of later Writers see by all means Camden.
Surita, for better distinction sake, calls the station here Secunda Venta

who would have the King Cynobellinus, mentioned by Di^ Cassius, to be as much
as the Bellinus of the Icenians. This station has not so much in Ptolemy lost
the right name of the people, among whom it stood, as it self too; for they
say, nothing thereof remains now, besides a few decayed Walls which enclose
some thirty acres that shows the ground there, sometime inhabited, and some
Roman Coin now and then taken up: else there is nothing remaining.

But out of the ruins thereof in after times, there arose Norwich, a City
whose antiquity the learned D. Alex. Nevillus.

stands near the confluents of (...) Ptol.
Garienis, and another River, which they call Bariden, Norwicus signifies as

of the (...), a people of Britain in Ptolemy, far enough dissite hence. Yet of
the name Venta, there are plain vestigia to be seen in the near River Wentsum,
or Wentsar; as some do call it.

SITOMAGUS. M. P. XXXII.] With this Station this journey goes on here. The name
whereof is corruptly set forth in Peutingers Military Tables SIMOMAGUS, and
sometime SINOMAGUS: but here in Antoninus it is right SITOMAGUS. From the Saxon
times it was called Thetford, from the little River Thet; and the Ford there;
besides the old British or Gallick word Vid. NOVIOM AGVS; ^illic lin. l^.
Magus a dwelling, or house; as you would say, The mansion by the Thet. Thet

ferunt, olim firmatam, quam Romanorum fuisse opus credunt nonnulli, vel potius

CAMBRETOVIUM. M. P. XXII.] So many copies have it, but amiss: There is a
small Town in Suffolk, not far from the Source of the Breton, lying low in a
bottom. This of old was Combretonium, as if you should have said, The Valley,
or bottom, by Breton. This sometimes it was: Now scarce any Comb, quid Antiquit
signi^ cares.
thing appears left else, to say that ever it was. In the room thereof you
have in Peutingers Military Tables, which the noble Mark Velfer set forth, but
corruptly (for how could it be otherwise after so long time, and so ungain
Transcribers?) Comvetronum, and Ad Coverin.

AD ANSAM. M. P. XV.] But you shall find, that it is six miles from
Camulodunum, the Colony. In Camden, our excellent diligent Antiquary, it is
thought to be a Terminus of this Colony, grounding his conceit upon the
authority of Seculus Elarcus; (for so his name is to be written, not Siculus)
and him you have published in the Volume of Writers, De limitibus Agrorum,
Agri, says he, Coloniis adjacentes variis Terminis definiebantur: in limitibus
constitutae erant pro Terminis res aliae atque aliae, alibi Hermulae, alibi
spatu^ae, alibi rhombi, and alibi, secundum vitalem and Arcadium, Termini erant
Lagenares, vel Orculares, id est, Lagenae, and Or. Upon which words that
learned man thus infers: Cur igitur, non and Ansa terminale signum fuerit, vel
diversorium aliquod ad Viam sub ejusmodi intersignio, Cum ad Ansam, non Ansae,
suo more dixerit Antoninus: Nec alia quam signa terminalia, vel diversoria,
erant, quae eadem loquendi formula Romano saculo nom^nabantur. Which we may
truly believe to be said by him, if we understand it concerning the Mutations
only, appointed in latter ages through the Provinces in public Roads, and were
called by the Greeks (...), and (...), furnished with beasts for public
carriage, as also with their meat and provender; but not with other

distinguished from Mansions. For otherwise places in the very City were
expressed in this form of speaking. Suetonius Domitianus natus est, regione
Urbis sexta, Ad Malum Punicum domo, quam postea in Templum gentis Flavia
convertit. P. Victor P. Victor. de Regionibus urbis.
also mentions it in the same Region of the City, and names it the House of
Domitian, where also he places Sueton. in Galba.
Ad Gallinas Albas. The name of this house was taken from the Vi^ntan
Countrey-dwelling of the Caesar's, which was called Ad Gallinas, from the brood

Ad Nationes. Certainly before the age Suetonius lived in, we observe not any
such Notations of the names of places.

Robert Talbot, Prebend of Norwich, who in our Forefathers days writ
Annotations upon this Itinerary, thought this AD ANSAM to be Catwad-Bridge, in
the Borders of Suffolk, where Stour the River dividing Essex, making a little
Island: which yet we know only by the Testimony of William Fulk, whose later
Interpreta ions of the old Cities of Eritain, we owe to the singular humanity
of that incomparable man, James Usher, sometime Archbishop of Armagh, and
Primate of Ireland: for in two Copies which I have my self happened to see of
Talbots Book, no such matter appears to be seen. Then there is a greater
diverticulum, and farther distance from Camulodunum, then that the Compendium
of this Journey can any way suffer it.

In William Camden in the (...) of his great Work, we see Vide ex Notitia
Provinc. OTHONA.
Ithamcester put for this place: yet after second cares, he thinks it was some
place near about Cogges-hall, out of whose ruins it might seem to have had
birth and increase. Truly the distance may seem to persuade it: for that the
Romans sometimes possessed these parts, an Hypogaeum or Grot, with arched work
opened not long since, by the Roadside, is sufficient argument. There was a
Lamp yet burning still in a glass Vial, covered with a Roman Tile, whose
Diameter was fourteen inches. There were also some Urnes, or Crocks, which
contained in them ashes and bones. Amongst them, there was one of a polite and
most fine substance, resembling rather Coral, then red earth, and had the
Cover thereof inscribed COCCILLIM Perhaps for COCCILLI. M. That is Coccilli
Manibus. In his Funeral Monuments.
John Weever indeed, no unlearned Antiquary, says. That his conjecture was,
that this was the monument of some Governor, who in Antoninus Pius his days
held these places under his command, that he writes the more confidently,
because there were found many of his coins, advising us moreover more
seriously to observe the great affinity or neernesse of both these names,
Coccilli, and Cogges-hall; as which had in them (...), to borrow Strabo's
words, no small force of persuasion: so that from this Coccilus the old Town
may seem to have received its name, remainders of which seem visibly to
continue yet in the present one even at this day. Meric Casaubon Is. F. in his
most learned Notes upon Marcus Antoninus the Emperor his Lib. (...).

Sometimes it was my conjecture, that for Ad Ansam we were to read Ad Arcam.
Now this Arca was a Monument also; such as they set up in the borders of
fields, and observed them for Termini, or Limets. These Arcae finales were ut
plurimum sepulchrales, and served to interr the dead; sometime they were only
placed ad siniendos Agros, that is, to limit men's ground. Hence it is that we
read in an old Glossarii: Arcae, (...). More may be seen in Frontin. aliique de

been let alone unobserved here.

CAMULODUNUM. M. P. VI.] before fifteen hundred years this was a noble Town of
Britain among the Trinobantes. There make mention of it besides an ancient
stone, whose Inscription Onuphrius first published, ancient Coyns, and Authors
too, Pliny, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Antoninus, and Ptolem us. But there is no
small difference about the writing of the name; while some will have the second
syllable written by the first vowel by Plin Not. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 75.
A. following especially the stone and sometime too the Coyns: and yet he seems
willing to deduct the name from a peculiar Deity, or Indigena among them, which
Camden says he durst not suspect. But if as he says Mars were worshipped by
them under the name of Camulus, then may the deduction hold good, and
Camulodunum be interpreted, The hill of Mars; so that there will be the same
reason of name, which was of the Areopagus at Athens. The Inscription runs
thus: CAMULO SANC. FOR TISS. SAC. and the habit thereof is martial; the name
remaining in Caesar in that of the famous and ancient Gaul, Camulogenus
Aulercus.

Ptolemy has its name much corrupted by the strange transposition of Letters,
(...), Camudolanum among the (...), for so he calls the Trinobantes in Tacitus:
This need seem strange to no body, seeing that not only in him, but in many
other ancient Authors, the like ^jections do frequently happen. For I could
produce many such luxations of whole verses, and periods, out of Virgil,
Manilius, Tibullus, Proper sins, and others, observed by learned men, if I had
a mind to it. However, we will not say that Ptolemy writ it so, though we find
it in his most ancient Copies, I, and in the Palatine too: and yet Lhuyd seems
to think so, while he conjectures that the last syllables of this name come
from Lan, which with the Britains was as much as Fanum, or a Temple. For says
he, Loca quae a Latinis in Lan desinunt vel incipiunt olim a Fanis Brittannice
dicta fuisse credo. Which although it may be true in other names, yet here it
seems to have no place. Therefore after so many Testimonies of the Ancients
concerning the name of this place, we will leave out all fond and futile
conjectures, it being neither the part of a knowing man to devise them, nor of
a wise man to admit of them.

As for this Camulodunum, it was of old the Palace of King Cynobellinus, father
of Adminius, Sueton. in Caligula cap. 44. nam mendosi sunt Orosii libri in ejus
nomine.
who Caius Caligula accepted homage of. This we learn from Dio: Dio Cass. Hist.

(...); He was King in Britain about the time of Augustus, or certainly about
Tiberius his Empire: which thing also his Coins, as yet to be seen in many

Afterward, when Claudius Caesar himself undertook an expedition into Britain,
and brought the hither part of the Island into subjection, a Colony of old
Soldiers were drawn hither. Tacitus speaking of the Britain affairs under
Claudius: Tacit. Annal. 12.
Colonia Camulodunum, valida veter anorum manu deducitur in agros captivos,
subsidium adversus rebels, and imbuendis sociis ad officia legum. And Ibid.
Annal. 14.
elsewhere: In Coloniam Camalodunum recens deducti, pellebant domibus,
exturbabant agris, etc. Coyns were presently stamped, and issued forth, which
witnessed as much, by their Inscription COL. CAMALODON AUG. which you see here:
CLAVD^CAES^AVG^GER^PM^^^^IMP(...)
obverse side of a coin COL CAMALODON AUG
reverse side of a coin

On the one part you have the Effigies of Claudius Caesar: The other Servius
Honoras. in Virg.
Servius will best of all explain: Romani, says he, condituri civitates,
taurum in dextra, vaccam intrinsecus jungebant cincti ritu Gabiuo, i. e. togae
part caput velati, part succincti, tenebant stivam incurvam, ut glebae omnes
intrinsecus caderent. Et ita sulco ducto, loca murorum designabant, aratrum
suspendentes cira loca portarum. But in an ancient stone, it is called Colonia
Victricensis, quae in Britannia Camu'oduni; and in the very same Cives Romani
of this place are mentioned. The whole Inscription according as Gruter
published it out of Onuphrius, is thus: CN. MUNATIUS M. F. PAL. AURELIUS BASSUS
PROC. AUG. PRAEF. FABR. PRAEF. COH. III. SAGITTARIOR. PRAEF. COH. II ASTURUM.
CENSITOR. CIVIUM. ROMANORUM COLONIAE VICTRICENSIS QUAE EST IN BRITANNIA
CAMALODUNI: CURATOR VIAE NOMENTANAE PATRONUS EJUSDEM MUNICIPI FLAMEN PERPETUUS
DUUMVIRALI. POTESTATE AEDILIS DEDICATOR. IIII.

Camden thinks that it was called Colonia Victricensis, because of the old
Soldiers of the fourteenth Legion, termed also ^mina Martia Victrix, whom
Tacitus styles Britannia domitores. Yet truly under Nero, ten years after, this
Colony Camulodunum being utterly razed, the Legion notwithstanding is reckoned
among those forces, which Suetonius Paulinus led against our Boadicia, and
those Britains, who had destroyed Camulodunum, and the very Colony. It may be
therefore that the Legion it self being cut off, yet the name thereof might
remain continued from a new choice, and muster. The same Legion also is
frequently spoken of by Tacitus in his Tacit. Hist. lib. 1.
Histories: Praecipui fama Quarta-decimani rebellione Britannia compressa.

But let us come to what we would, and see what ancient Authors have concerning
the deduction of this Colony, and their doings, a little more accurately
observed, with the Succession of affairs. Tacitus therefore in his Agricola
thus: That Caius had a meaning to invade Britanny, it is certainly known.
Claudius did first with effect prosecute the matter, transporting Legions and
Aides, and assuming Vespasian into the action, which was the beginning of the
Greatness whereunto he after attained: some Countries were subdued, some Kings
were taken, and Vespasian made known to the world.

The first Lieutenant General was Aulus Plautius, then Ostorius Scapula, both
excellent Warriors: and so by little and little was the nearest part of the
Island reduced to the form of a Province? and besides a Colony of old Soldiers
established there. Publius Ostorius in subduing the Silures, made use of their
help. The nation of the Silures, says Annal. lib. 12. and 14.
Tacitus, Non atrocitate, non clementia mutabatur; quin bellum exerceret,
castrisque legivnum premenda foret. Id quo promptius veniret, colonia
Camalodunum valida veteranorum manu deducitur in agros captivos, subsidium ad
versus rebels, and imbuendis sociis ad officia legum. Itum inde in Siluras.

Pontifices, and Flamens of Claudius, out of the Provincials themselves: by whom
sacrifices and offerings were to be made at their no small cost. Moreover Senec.

Seneca also mentions this Temple: Parum est quod Templum in Britannia habet,
quod hunc barbari colunt and ut deum orant. For Ara in Tacitus, it pleased
Justus Lipsius to write Arra, as if he called that Temple a pledge or assurance
of lasting servitude: but Valens Acidalius rather pleased to have it Arx.
Tacitus goes on: Neither did it seem any hard matter, to extirpate that Colony
undefenced and unfortified, which was not circumspectly forseen by our
Captains, whilst they had a greater care of pleasure, then good government.
Amongst these things the image of Victory set up in Camalodunum, fell down
without any apparent cause why, and turned back as though it would give place
to the enemy. And the women, distempered with fury, went singing, that
destruction was at hand. And strange noises were heard in their Court, and the
Theater gave a sound like to a howling, and a strange apparition of Houses in
an arm of the Sea, was a fortelling of the Subversae Coloniae. Imo sub

this place, out of Dio Cassius Romans Hist. lib (...). ex quo etiam Dionis loco

That is; and out of their Counsel-house, (the word is Curia in Tacitus:) a rude
and barbarous stir in the night time with laughter, and out of the Theater a
tumult and hallow with lamentation was heard, when as no body either spoke or
made any moan there, and certain houses in the River Thames were seen under
water. The same Consular Historian in that book adds moreover, That (...). The
Ocean between the Island and Gallia increased at the time of the tide of a

Ptolemies (...), which he understands in the same signification from the
British.

Such kind of noises with lamentation made in their Temples or Theaters, the
rattling of arms, and turning of Statues out of their places were noted
elsewhere amongst dire presages, so that there was not any more manifest
evidence of ruin hanging over head. Apollonius Rhodius in the (...) of his
Argonauticks: -- (...).


The neat and witty Roman Historian Luc. Florus lib. IV. cap. 2.
Dux ipse Pompeius noctur^ imagine Theatri sui audiens plansum in modum

Maxim. lib. 1. cap 6.
Constat in delubris deum, sua sponte signa conversa: militarem clamorem
strepitumque armorum, adeo magnum Antiochiae and Ptolemaide auditum, ut in
muros concurreretur. But what Tacitus Tacit. Annal. lib. XIV.
does add is most part let pass by Dio: Further the Ocean bloody in show, and
dead men's bodies left after an ebb, as they brought hope to the Britains, so
they drove the old Soldiers into a fear, who because Suetonius was far off,
craved aid of Catus Decianus the Procurator. He sent not above two hundred men,
and those hadly armed, and the number not great which was there before, trusted
to the franchise of the Temple. And those hindering which were confederates of
the secret conspiracy, troubled their designments: for they neither made trench
nor ditch, nor sending away the old men and women, and keeping the young men
only, being as secure as it had been in a full peace, they were surprised with
a multitude of barbarous people, and all overthrown, and wasted with violence,
or consumed with fire: the Temple only excepted, into which the Soldiers had
fled, which also within two days was besieged and taken. And the Britain being
thus Conqueror, and meeting with Paetus Cerealis Lieutenant of the ninth
Legion, which came to succor them, put to flight the Legion, and slew all the
footmen: Cerealis with the horsemen escaped to the Camp, and defended himself
in the fortresses. So the Romans found that to be of certain truth, which
Strabo by a sagacious conjecture foresaw of the Britains, and as a
south-telling Prophet also foretold: Strabo Geograph. lib. IV.
(...). Necessarily violence being offered, some danger would follow thereupon.
For the stubborn necks of the Britains; and not handsomely accustomed to the
reins of servitude, the violence of contumely and injury being added, easily
took head against the Yoke, and made opposition. The Leader in so famous a
design, and Dux foemina facti, was Boodicia Queen of the Iceni, under whom,
they as Tacit. ubi supra.
Tacitus says, contumelia and metu graviorum capiebant arma, commotis ad
rebellionem Trinobantibus. He joins to them Idem in vita Agricola.
elsewhere the Brigantes: femina duce exurere Coloniam, expugnare castra
potuere: sumsere universi bellum; ac sparsos per castella milites consectati,
expugnatis praesidiis, ipsam Coloniam invasere, ut sedem servitutis: nec ullam
in barbaris saevitiae genus omisit ira and victoria. Hitherto belongs what he
had said a little before: Non sane alias exercitatior magisque in ambiguo
Britannia fuit: trucidativeterani, incensae Coloniae: where, when as he says,
Colonies, in the number of multitude, besides Camulodunum he understands
Verulamium, or which is most probable, London it self: of which yet neither was
cognomento Coloniae insigne: for of London himself expressly denies it; and for
Verulamium, he calls it Municipium. Neither is Suetonius otherwise to be
understood: Sueton. in Nerone cap. 39.
Clades Britannica, qua duo praecipua oppida, magna civium sociorumque cade
direpta sunt. But some of the most learned neither read the Latin word as in
number of multitude; and there is also another commodious answer; Figure of
speech; which not rarely admits a plural for a singular, as a graceful excess.

But after so grievous an overthrow, Camalodunum yet after a few years began to
flourish again; which we may conjecture out of Pliny: for he makes mention
thereof as of a Town very famous in his days: In Mona, Plin. Nature. Hist. lib.
2. cap. 715.
says he, qua distat a Camaloduno Britanniae oppido circiter ducentis
millibus; For Pliny, in the Thirteenth Chapter of the same Book, makes mention
of the third Consulship of Vespasian, which happened in the tenth year after
the overthrow of Camalodunum: so that here it is nothing necessary to urge that
the same Pliny dedicated his Natural History to Vespasian, when as such
Inscriptions for the most part, and Preambles which no body is ignorant of,
were wont to be made, when all was done. Again, if the Colony yet standing,
Pliny wrote this, he seems not likely to have omitted the name Colony, as a
thing that deserved not to be left out.

From this time to Constantines age, the memories of ancient things being lost,
there is wholly silence concerning it; but that Antoninus here in this place
makes mention of it, as also the ancient Itinerary Table of Peutinger, which
Scaliger thought was compiled thence, as is observed before: whence no weak
conjecture may be brought that it is ancienter then the Notitia Provinciarum,
which they will have to be written under Theodosius the younger: because
therein those strengths were recorded by the Seaside, which were appointed for
the repelling of the piraticall Incursions of the Saxons: And they were sub
dispositione viri Spectabilis Commitis littoris Saxonici per Britanniam. Yet
for all that therein is no mention made of it, the site being known well enough
out of Dio, the matter it self I am sure seemed to require it, if it had been
still standing: It is doubtful therefore whether or no, some grievous
calamity, and very near to total ruin might not in this mean while have so
afflicted and prostrated it, that if it made it not wholly equal to the
ground, yet it might seem to have stricken off its head and Gallantry. But
certainly Camulodunum appears under the Empire of Constantine M. to be
mentioned with high praise and worth; the name of Colony being also added:
which thing I see pleases an extraordinary man, and one born for the promotion
of better Letters. I mean the most admired Seldom. Comm. in Eutychii Patriarcha
Alexandrini Origines sue Ecclesiae Arabice editas, P. 122.
John Seldom, who will have it to have flourished at that time with the dignity
of an Episcopal Seat; and that from the Subscriptions of the first Counsel at
Arles: to bring therefore hither his dissertation concerning this business, I
thought it to be most convenient, In the late Edition, says he, of the
Counsels of Gallia which we owe to Jaques Sirmond, the first Counsel of Arles,
out of an old Book of the Abbey of Corbey is Printed, where the names of the
Bishops are set before the places, otherwise then in the other Edition; and
there so far as concerns Britain, they are in this manner: Eborius Episcopus de
Civitate Eboracensi, provincia Britannia. Restitutus Episcopus de Civitate
Londinensi provincia suprascripta. Adelfius Episcopus de Civitate Colonia
Londinensium; exinde. Sacerdos Presbyter; Arminius Diaconus.

So out of Britain, besides Restitutus of London, there were present at the
Counsel at Arles, Eborius of York, and Adelfius de Civitate Colonia
Londinensium, as here he is called, with a Presbyter and a Deacon. But what is
Civitaes Coloniae Londinensium? That truly in the Topography of Britain,
signifies nothing. What credit ought to be given to the Book of Corbey, I know
not; neither have I yet heard of what Antiquity it is: but if those
Subscriptions out of it be to be received, I can scarce at all make any doubt
(however Maxim intelligit Praestantis. Dom. Armachan. qui Coloniam aliam esse
putat; de qua etiam in hoc opere alibi satis dictum.
other men think otherwise:) but that Adelfius here was Bishop of the Colony of
Camulodunum. Verily this Colony while the Roman Empire had any sway here, was
exceeding famous, which, when as perhaps it was not written whole and entire;
as Col. or Colon. Camalodun. or as sometimes, Camolodon. by the Transcribers,
to whom the name of London, or Londinum was very well known; and yet were in
the mean while quite ignorant what the Colony Camulodunum meant: as well from
the cognation of the sound, as ignorance of this particular reading; it was
changed into Coloniam, London, or Londin. So the old Maldon men had in times
past their Bishop. But rather let the studious Reader have recourse to that
uncomparable man's words, according as he is before directed. But for the
present Situation of Camulodunum, where I mean the place it stood of old: then
I must not dissemble, that some great Antiquaries, as John Leland, Humphry
Lhoid, and such as follow them, do seek for Camulodunum in Cholchester. Hinc
credo, says Lhoyd, fuisse Coloniam illam Claudii Caesaris Templo celebrem,
quam nunc Colchestriam vocant. Hector Boethius placed it in Scotland, and
says, Regiam Pictorum fuisse olim ad Caronae fl. ripam; which George Buchanan
his Countryman says is vanissimum mendacium. Polydor. Virgil seeks it in
Yorkshire: Puto, Camulodunum (quando de ea re ambigitur) eo loci olim situm,
ubi nunc est Dancastrum, quia vel Castrorum memoria videtur retinere nomen loci
ad belli praesidium electi: aut Pontifractum, quod paulo proprius, and etiam
citra Eboracum est, circiter millia possuum XVIII. loco magis amaeno, quam
munito. Extat castellum, and in eo aliqua vestigia Templi, quod ibidem Claudio
Caesari. In a word, Hector and Polydorus are in very deed alike, and according
to the Greek saying, (...). But others also will have it to have stood among
the Brigantes, or in Yorkshire, persuaded thence, because in Ptolemy there goes
next before it (...), or, Legio sexta Victrix; as if the title there of Victrix
had explained that which ere-while we brought out of the Stone, Colonia
Camulodunum Victricensis: when as it is plain enough, that that Legio sexta
Victrix, is to be meant of Eboracum, accordingly as it is put and to be
referred; which also is retained in a Coin of Severus: which see there. There
have been some also who have sought it at Chester, the Seat of the Legio
Vicessinia Victrix in Ptolemy. But what says the old Greek Proverb? (...).


Let us hear our great Antiquary Camden instead of all: It was verily no other
then Maldon in Essex. Maxima, says he, dictronis part etiamnum integra, and
superstite. Nec hoc solummodo expressum nominis vestigium persuasit, verum
etiam distantia a Mona, apud Plinium, a Vanonio apud Antoninum, and ipse situs
in antiqua Tabula Itineraria probationem praestant vel apertissimam. But what
is the complaint of the Poet? Manilius lib. 1.
Nec se cognoscunt terrae vertentibus annis.
In space of time the Lands themselves not know.


CANONIO. M. P. IX.] Our learned Antiquary Camden, when he saw the distance
from Maldon, to Chemsford, to be some six miles, he concluded it to be
Canonium, or at least that it increased and grew out of the ruin thereof, if
it indeed possess not the same ground. It is a Town at this day spacious
enough at the confluents of the Chelmer, and as some call it of the Can, which
if they say right, this Can gave name to the old place. The same Camden in the
Proecdosis of his Work, makes it to be Canonden; quite on the other side of the
Country, only the name somewhat alluding. Talbot before him, had set down to
it Keldon or else Esterford, of which we have Fulks testimony: for in his own
book no such thing appears: but himself sets down Coune to it: truly in the
ancient Military Marco Velsero Editore; dein aliis.
Table, about the place of its site Caunonium stands to be seen instead thereof.

CAESAROMAGO. M. P. XII.] I conceive there is sufficient spoken in what goes
before concerning this Station; We will go on therefore to the next.

DUROLITO. M. P. XVI.] Camden, (...), the learned Illustrator of the decayed
Antiquities of this our Island, ingenuously confesses, that he cannot show
signate quo in loco this station was to be found; yet he assures us and that
sine dubio, that it stood by the River Ley. His own words are once for all:
Vetusta hujus Comitatus loca, semel praemoneo, obscuritate ita involuta latent,
ut ego qui alibi aliquid viderim, hic plane cacutiam. But if his conjecture
hold good, Durolitum signifies as much as, The Town upon the water Ley: for
there is a Village at this day called Leyton V. miles from London, for which in
Antoninus, XV. through the heedlesnes of the Transcribers, has crept in.
Besides not far hence there was in old time a passage of the water whence the
name of the place is called Ouldford, that is, Antiquum Vadum, which gives
sufficient testimony.

LONDINIO. M. P. XV.] What was fitting to be said concerning this I hope is
enough expressed formerly, to which I refer you.

of his opinion, for himself makes the question, p'aces Glanoventa by the banks

of all, that it was the garrison consisting of the first Guard of the Morini in

testimony of the Notitia of the Western Empire: Sub dispositione Viri
Spectabilis Ducis Britanniaram per Lineam Valli excubabat Tribunus: Cohortis 1.
M^rinorum Glannivan^. Then with the old Britain Glanoventa signified, the
Shore, or banks of Venta; as in Pomp. Mela de situ orbis lib. 2. cap. 12. Nec

Pomponius Mela we find a coast City, or Maritime of Gallis, styled likewise
Glanos. Though in the Proecdosis or former Edition of his learned Work,
Bainbridge in Richmondshire be to be seen there.

GALAVA. M. P. XVIII.] So absolutely were both editions both of Aldus, and
Simlerus; And Hier. Surita confesses, that in Cumberland.

rather have it Gallants, and inclines to think it Wallwick, though in the
former editions of his learned work we find (...) in the Barony of ^all for it.

save the Springs of West Tine in a plashie ground, and an ancient Roman Way
paved some eight Else broad, leading out of Westmorland, which they call
Maiden-way, and where the stream Alon, and the same Tine do meet, upon the side
of an Hill some what yiedling, are the remainders of a very great Town and
Castle, enclosed with a fore-fold Trench, as likewise to the West: they call it
at this day Whitley Castle, in testimony of whose antiquity this Inscription is
yet to be seen: IMP. CAES. Lucii Septimi Severi Ara Virius Lupus.

All that is said in this old Altar here is confirmed very well, and witnessed
by the Notitia Occidentalis Imperii, which says as much: excubabat Tribunus
Cohortis III. Nerviorum Alione per Lineam Valli sub dispositione Viri
spectabilis Ducis Eritanniarum. Only Pancirolus following Camden is much
mistaken, when he says, that of this at this day it is called Lancester, as if
it were Alone, for the Britains Allone, id est, supra Lonum: Fl. much better we
find it in Francis Holyoke, Old Town upon Allone, id est, Vetus Oppidum ad
Alonem in Northumbria, or in William Fulk, Allenton, not far from Whitley
Castle. But by no means may we admit of that conjecture of Josias Simlerus. Who
in his notes to Antoninus very much amiss does set to it (...), a City of
Britain in Ptolemy.

CALACUM. M. P. XIX.] Galacum in this Journey is Cumberland.
the very same says our Camden, which in Ptolemy is Galatum or (...), the
fourth City numbered among the Brigantes, but Galatum in the one, and Galacum in
the other are both promiscuously taken the one for the other in Camden, either
through the Writers oscitancy, or the Printers oversight, or by both. In the
last Edition it is Whelp-Castle with Camden in Cumberland, but in the
Proecdosis of that Work it is Overburrow in Lancashire: but in the last Edition
as I said, Whealp-Castle in Cumberland. And with William Fulk it is Litchfield,
though quite against the The reason of account.

through Mediolanum. Camden, as we have said, in his Proecdosis, thought this
the very same with Brementuracum, in the Notitia; But upon second thoughts he
conjectured it to be Overburrow in Lancashire. Vide Suritam in Notis ad
Antoninum.


COCCIUM. M. P. XX.] Near Overburrow is thought to have been a great City, and
to have possessed large fields between the Lac and Lone the Inhabitants do

from hand to hand; and indeed this place does assert its Antiquity by several
Monuments yet appearing, engraven stone, pavements of Musive Work, Romans Coin,
and the very name hard by, which being denoted from a Burrow, plainly
expresses, and argues its Antiquity; and if there be any room for conjecture,
this is Coccium according as the learned Spaniard dis-joines it from
Bremetonacum in the Notitia very rightly, here the River imparts its name to
the Town, in which appears so many tokens of Antiquity as no where else more,
so many Statues, Coins, Pillars, the Bases thereof, Altars, Marble
Inscriptions, and such Remainders of ancient State; that not undeservedly the
Inhabitants boast, though in a halting rhyme. It is written upon a Wall in Rome:
Ribchester was as rich as any Town in Christendom.


The name is Riblechester from the River, as we said, and it might, as it
usually happens, anciently have altered its appellation; and so that which here
is Coccium, may be in Ptolemy (...), which he places in this situation, that is
eighteen miles, which he affirms from Mancunium. The name of the (...)
Aestuarium, which makes up toward it by the River Ribel is called by Ptolemy
(...): in which are some Remainders of the name, the Etymology of which I would
you would rather look for in Master Seldom, where he speaks of the several
Deities named from BELL. In this place is the famous Inscription, wherein the
Dea Matres are mentioned, of which Syntagm de Dis. Syriis.
I spoke formerly: thus.

him Libro Ecclesiasticae Historiae, 3. cap. 25.

The other three Stations Mancunium, Condate, Mediolanum, are already spoken
to: I will therefore refer the Reader to what goes before concerning them.

little Church, built sometime to the honor of Saint Publicius, the place had
its name from the River passing by, to this day called Seiont, issuing out of
Lin-Perith, or the Lake so called, in which a peculiar Fish is bred, which from
the ruddy belly the Natives call Tortoch. Now whereas a very ancient book of
Ptolemy, in this same site does place (...). i. Setantiorum Portum, if I, says
he, should read Segontiorum Portum, and though other Editions remove it

Ninnius and he who wrote the life of Griffin the Son of Conan, says, that
Hugh Earl of Chester, built a Castle i^ Hean Caer Custenni, that is, as the
Latin Interpreter turns it, in antiqua urbe Constantini Imperatoris, in the
ancient City of Constantine the Emperor, and Matthew of Westminster, is the
Author,: (but therein let himself look to his own credit for the truth of
this:) that the body of Constantius the father of Constantine the great, was
found An. MCCLXXXIII. and honorably placed in the Church of the new City by the
command of Edward the first, for he had at that time out of the ruins hereof
so drawn out of the City Caer-Narvon somewhat higher to the Ostium of the River
that it was upon the West and the North washed with its waters: which it self
as it was so called by reason of its situation thereof opposite to the Island
of Mona so gave its name to the whole Shire or Country, which at this day the
English do call Caer Narvonshire; the same Edward the first earnestly labored,
to pass his men into Mona, or Anglesea, to join this Island with a Bridge to
the Continent, but in vain. Long before his time this was the place where
Suetonius Paulinus the Roman General passed over his Army hither, which we
learn by the sufficient Authority of the excellent Tacit. Annal. lib. 14.
Tacitus: Igitur Monam Insulam incolis validam, and receptaculum perfugarum
aggredi parat, navesque fabricatur plano al^to, aduersus breve littus and
incertum. Sic pedites, equites vado secuti, aut altiores inter vndas, aduantes

Caesarem haeredem duasque filias scripserat, tali obsequio ratus regnum and
domum suam procul injuria fore, quod contra vertit, adeo ut regnum per
centuriones, domus per servos, velut capta vastaretur.

CONOVIUM. M. P. XXIII.] Caer-Narvonshire stretches Caernarvonshire
it self in a fair Plain as far as the River Conovius, commonly called Conwey,
which limiting on the East this Shire, terminates it. This River is by Ptolemy,
compendiaria Graece scribendi ratione, expressed, says the learned Camden, by
(...) Toosevius, for (...), or Conovius; for breaking forth of a Pool of the
same name, it speeds on, till near unto the mouth it grows less, where it
nourishes certain Shel-fish which fed with a certain celestial dew, bring
forth precious stones, giving its name to the old Station, here mentioned by
Antoninus, which though it be now ruined and extinct, yet by the new name it
declares its antiquity: for a very small village, out of its ruins appears,
called Caer-Hean; that is, Urbs antiqua: raised at the mouth thereof, out of
the spoils of the other, which Hugh Earl of Chester first fortified, and
afterward Edward the first, according as Leland relates; debellatis Venetis,
^uro quadrati lapidis pulcherrimo Vide Matthaeum Westmonast. ad annum 283.
cinxit, arcemque restauravit.

VARIM. M. P. XIX.] In the Confines of Caer-N^rvonshire Flintshire.
and this, where the Hills fall with a gentler descent, and afford an easier
passage into the Valleys, the Romans placed the City Paris in the very
entrance, which is said by Antoninus to be XIX. mile. This at this day with
little change of the name is called Bod-Vari, that is, the Mansion of Varus,
and they show in the neighbor Hill, which they call Moyloy Gaer, id est, ^ons
urbis, wherefore whereas elsewhere you find it interpreted Transitus, as in
Durnvaria, Isannavaria; and a nostra opinione facit haec Varis eo loci sita,
ubi solum patet facilis inter montes transitus; as says the all-learned Camden.

DEVAM. M. P. XXXIII.] Of this we have spoken before, Cheshire.
where we learn, that in the Roman age, the residence of the Legio XX. Victrix,
was here: according to Antoninus and Ptolemy; besides old Inscriptions. Whence

THis Author by the heedlesness of the Librarii or Transcribers is much abused,
for they have very coursly handled him, having confounded two distinct
Journeys, the last and this same here: and this oversight and error, is in
every copy, which is extant, and hitherto has escaped the curious eyes of the
undertakers of the several Editions of him: the main cause of the error was
the ignorance of Muridunum, and the taking it for Et non ul^erius sua itinerae
persequitur P^olemaeus: but he maintains the old reading of Antoninus, which i^
(...): of which s^ the last Journey.
Maridunum; which is known by most to be Kaer-Marthin in Wales, so that this
journey will prove from thence to Wrokcester in Shropshire, and it is by
Kaer-Marthin, or (...), as Ptolemy calls it here: the Journey which begins
Marodunum is exactly the same with the last, as you may see plainly in what
comes after: neither does Antoninus continue his marches beyond this Maridunun^.

The next Station which happens in this Journey, is Leucarum Glamorganshire.
in Camden in ^ilurib. page 500.
Glamorganshire by the River Logher, which also we now call Loghor. It is
famous from former time for that about the death of Henry the first, Howel Ap
Meridick, falling down upon the English, with his Mountaineers, slew many of
them of better quality.

NIDO. M. P. XV.] By the River Nidus, famous for the quicksand, is seated a
Town of the same name, mentioned here: which our Antiquaries have in vain
sought after; it stood of old near to Saint Lantwit, that is, fanum sancti
Illuti, at a proportionable distance to this: and the foundations of many
dwellings do show themselves thereby; besides Neath easily reveals it self,
in Nidus.

BOVIO. M. P. XV.] William Fulck, an Antiquary of Cambridge, calls it Rumey
(for so it is written f. Rumney:) thought Monmouthshire.
was the name of it which is a village a mile and a half, as he says, on this
side Landaff in Glamorgan-shire: Camden in the Proecdosis of his work, says it
was Cowbrid a known Town of the Shire, and it is most known, that this name
has some consonancy therewithal, as we could show also by many other examples;
that Euboea drew its name from Cattle, Strabo Geograph. lib. X.
Strabo is the Author: (...) [Euboea] (...). So that after it, it will be
needless to mention Bosphorus, Bovillae, Bovianum, as neither Baulos,
concerning the name of which village I am well pleased to transcribe the no
in-elegant verses of Symmachus, and the rather because he was the possessor of
it so many ages after Hortensius. Huc Deus Alcides stabulanda armenta coegit,
Eruta Geryonis de lare tergemini.
Inde recens aetas corrupta Boaulia Baulos
Nuncupat, occulto nominis indicio.
Alcides here his Cattle did improve
That he from triple Gerions stables drove;
Our age corrupting this Boaulia call,
Which hints the old denomination, Baul.


But seeing that in the repeated Edition of Camdens Britannia from second
cares, three mile from this Cowbridge, as he says, Boverton offered it self,
they are his own words, ita me veritas amet, non alibi Bovium indagare ausim.
Truly the Itinerary distance, both from Nidus, and Isca, on both sides,
mightily confirm this conjecture: not far from this Bovium is Saint Donatists
Castle, the Coins of the Thirty Tyrants, which otherwhere Inter eos nummos
Aemiliani item and Marii haebentur: quorum hic ((...) Zosimo dicitur lib. 1.)

are seldom found, are dug up here. Bonium in most Copies was written down,
as Surita informs us, and in the second Journey Bovium, in both places much
amiss, for there it should be Bonium, here Bovium.

ISCAM LEG. II. AUG. M. P. XXVII.] Although Ptolemie place this Legion quite
among a distinct people, Inter (...) Dumnonios Ptolemao quae and Romany Isca
Domniorum, ita a Britannis tesiante etiam usserio Milevensi in gessis Ae^phredi
Regis Anno 876. Cair Wise vel Cair Ise appellatum fuisse constat. Humfridus
Lhuydus, ex Giraldo Cambrensi.
yet the same Legion may be understood, where he has (...), Isca Sebasta
altera Legio. I will briefly in a welsh Antiquaries words describe this City
unto you, and that at full: Erat hac urbs antiqua and nobilis, cujus vestigia
adhuc supersunt, palatia immensa, turris gigantea, thermae insignes, templorum
reliquiae and loca theatralia, muris egregiis partim extantibus omnia clausa,

miro artificio conficta. Ibi jacent duo Martyrs, Julius and Aaron qui habebant
ecclesias sibi dedicatas. Erat etiam and Archiepiscopalis Ecclesia sub
Dubricio, quae cessit Davidi. There were, besides others in this place taken
up, the Inscriptions, whereof one makes mention of HATERIANUS LEG. AUG. PR. PR.

There is another, which mentions the Effigies of Diana, and witnesses that a
Temple to her was restored by Titus Flavius Postumius Varus Veteran. perhaps of
the Cohors of the second Legion. T. FLAVIUS POSTUMIUS VARUS V. C. LEG. TEMPL.

A Monument, which all that Gyantlike structure of Paul's cannot show the like,
though it be said most anciently to have been dedicated to this Deity. Next to
that is a votive Altar for Severus his Sons, but with Getas name scraped out at
such time as he being declared to be an Enemy, was at length quite removed by
his Brother Antoninus Bassia^us. PRO SALUTE AUGG. N. N. SEVERI ET ANTON NI ET

This Legion instituted by Augustus was taken into Britain by Claudius Casar,
and planted here, where by the leading of Julius Frontinus it recided against
the Silures, of whom Tacitus. How great this Isca was read a little out of
Giraldus in his Itinerary of Wales: Erat haec urbs antiqua and autentica, a
Romany olim coctilibus muris egregie constructa. Videas hic multa pristinae

reliquias, and loca theatralia muris egregijs, partim adhuc extantibus omnia

Siluribus page 489.

BURRIUM. M. P. IX.] It stands where the stream of Birthin is mingled with the
Isca. The Britains at this day, transposing the letters, call it Brubege for
Burenbege by Giraldus Castrum oscae, but by the English Uske; it now only
possesses the ground or room of a large and fortified Castle which most
pleasantly lies between the River Isca an Oilway the stream which under it
passes by the neat dwelling of the Earl of Worcester as Monmouthshire.
it were under a Castle on the East.

GOBANNIUM. M. P. XII.] At the confluents of Isca and Gobannius this Statio is
placed, whence Aber-Gevenne and contractedly Aber-Genne which signifies just as
much. H. S.

MAGMIM. M. P. H. S. XXII.] In Bland. and reliquis Magnis M. P. XXII. Sub Duce
Britanniarum in Notitia Provinciarum Prafectus Radnorshire.
Numeri Pacensium Magnis recensetur, tam etsi in Manuscripto, and vulgatis

Old Radnor in British called Maiseveth ^hean, and from the steep ascent
Pencrag, which in the Reign of King John, was by Rees Ap-Griffin burnt down
to the Ground. If I shall say that this which Antoninus seems to call Magnos,
wherein Theodosius the younger time the praefectus of the Milites Pacenses had
his being Sub Britanniarum Ducis, I should perhaps miss of the truth in other
men's opinion, however not in mine own; for the inhabitants of this whole Tract
are called Magaseses, and the Earls thereof As the learned Antiquary Doctor
Godwin, In recensu Episcoporum Duvolmensium.
Magesetenses and Masegetenses, in the writers of the middle Age, and the
Reason of the account of Miles from Gobannium, or Aber-Gevenne, so also from
Brangonium does not in the least differ from that of Antoninus, In lib. de
Notitia imp. Po. To. legitur, praefectum numerorum Pacensium in prasidio Magis:
item in eodem lib. Tribunum cohortis secunda Magnis collocatum. Magnos item in
Itin. Ant. invenimus unumne oppidum, an diversa sint non ausim pro certo
affirmare. Verum magis inclinat animus, ut credam diversa. Geor. Bukanan, Rerum
Scoticarum Fol. 24. An Chesteringwall, it is called by Camden.

BRAVONIUM. P. XXIV.] The name of a City of Britain in the way to Wrokcester.
But Simlerus has Bravinium, and Worcestershire.
so has he caused it to be published, but Camden has corrected it Brannomium,
most amendedly, if I am able to Judge any thing aright. In Piolemy it is called
(...), Brannogenium, which William Fu^k minded not, who set down to it Bangor,
following, as it seems, Joseph Moletius, and Paullus Iovius, who yet pleased
to have Bravium, heretofore to be called Bridge-North, as we see. It is a City
of the Ordovites, and therefore by Camden, who found it among the Cornavij,
rightly thought to be banished from its own Seat, it is famous to Posterity,
for the Antiquity of it, and the often variety of Fortune. First, it remained
content under the safeguard of the Roman gentleness, straightway the Danes
troubling all with boundless Fury, it passed diverse changes, yet always
after the ruin, it sprang up fresh again, as at this day it flourishes with
very great celebrity, whether you consider the splendidness of the Buildings,
and the magnificence of the Churches, or whether the frequency of the Citizens
themselves, and inhabitants, or whether the Nature of the Soil and Situation
by the River Severn, upon no very sleep Hill, on whose Eastern banck it was
placed by the Romans, As also many other great Cities, not upon this River
alone, to hold in the Transabrine Britains, as also those which lived upon the
bank of the Dee, and the Rhine beyond Sea, to hinder the irruption of the
Germans into Gaul, as it has been already observed by learned men who instance
in Strasbury, Spira, Mentz, Bing, Boppard, Confluents, Lonna, and others. John
Rossus of Warwick, a learned Antiquary in our Grandfathers days relates that
it was founded by King Constantius. In Ninnius his Catalogue of old Cities,
which he reckons to be XXVIII. where it is related that it was in old time
Romanorum superba moenibus, old writings affirm, and however I fear Camden is
somewhat mistaken, when he names to Worcester out of Ninnius Caer-Gorangon, and
Guarchon, which in Doctor Ushers judgment are thought rather to be Warwick or
Wrokencester; Worcester being commonly at this day Caer-Urangon, called by the
Cambro-Britains, as formerly, by the Saxons (...), and (...), from Wire, as
some will have it, a Woody Laune thereto adjoined.

In old time it flourished for nothing more then the Sanctimony and learning of
the Bishops among whom some also were famous for the opinion of Miracles among
the common people. The Bishops Sea was restored about the year DCLXXX. among
whom I will only name Baldwinus, to whom, adorned with the dignity of the
Archbishopric of Canterbury, Josephus Exoniensis, a man to be compared, not
only with the most excellent Wits of his own age, but also with any of the
Ancients, dedicated his Book De bello Trojano, so often published beyond Sea,
under Visard of Cornelius ille Nepos hic est -- qui solebant Catulli esse
aliquid putare nugas ut ipse ait.
Cornelius Nepos. And this the studious Reader shall understand, is the rather
set down by us, because he is thought the first to have called this City by the
name Vigornia, in this we have John Lelands own words for it, that it is not
nomen admodum novum in this very work; as they do also commonly at this day: In
numerum jam crescit honos; Te tertia poscit
Insula: jam meminit Wigornia; Cantia discit;
Romanus meditatur apex; and nausraga Petri
Ductorem in mediis expect at cymba procellis.
Tu tamen occiduo degis contentus evili,
Tertius a Thoma, S. Thomas Centuariensis.
Thomasque secundus and alter;
Soloriens, rebus successor, moribus haeres.
Felices quos non trahit ambitus. --
Thy Honor grows, Thee the third Isle requires,
Worster remembers and all Kent admires,
Rome Thee expects, and prays thou would appear,
Saint Peter's crazy Ship through storms to steer,
Thou in a Western Cure art pleased and want,
Who next Saint Thomas we a third place grant,
The rising Sun is to thy Virtues Heir:
Happy be those who not ambitious are.

friend in Queens College, and almost the only Ornament of Oxford, caused
these Verses to be thus written out of the MS. which were before wanting in the
Printed Books. This Baldwin following Richard the first in his Journey to the
holy Land, mightily assisted our Party by preaching, counselling, and
communicating his store to the needy, an example of most holy carriage, till at
length in the Siege of Ptolemais: (our men say Acre and Acon) being taken with
a grievous disease, died about the year c x c.

BLESTIUM. M. P. XI.] It is a Station in Antoninus in the Journey which is set
down from Isca Leg. 11. Aug. to Callena Atrebatum, Monmouthshire.
that it was that little Town in the limits of Herefordshire, which is called
the old Town, the exact distance from the two Mansions passed on either side
does sufficiently witness. Certainly if the reason thereof did not evince it,
the reason of the name would for as many as happen in Britain (and they are
not a few) the Romans being here Masters of all, were military Stations, and
possessed by their Soldiers at this day, they that are of the Britains issue

Malmsburyes age out of its ruins Hereford sprung famous for a Bishopric, which
Baldus calls Henefortensis, for Henford in British signifies Vetus via, or the
old way.

CLEVUM. M. P. XV.] Sabrina or Severne passes by the chiefest City of
Gloucester shire, which in Antoninus is Clevum or Glevum, but among the
Britains Caerglovi, but with others, Claudiocestre, from Claudius, who they
say, gave his daughter Genissa in marriage to Arviragus, of whom Iuvenall in
his fourth Satyr. Regem aliquem capies, vel de temon: Britanno

As if he had had more Daughters then Claudia, Antonia, and Octavia, all whose
Husbands Suetonius does plainly acquaint us withal, then what does he in
Claudius time, slight notice of whom we light not on before Domitians Reign
when he was called Arivogus, as Doctor Usher out of an ancient Coin would
persuade us, but the Scholia's upon Iuvenall would have him named Arbilas. Our
learned Antiquary had rather a great deal more willingly bring down the name
from Glovus, Gildas sapiens lib. de gestis Britonum.

scarce a mile from Newberry, a famous Town which sprung out of the Ruins
thereof, whence also it was called so, and part yet thereof is still to this
day called Spinam Lands, to witness its Original.

VENTAM SI LURUM. M. P. IX.] I before gave notice that there were three Venta's
in this Itinerary; one of Tacit Annal. XII.
the Belgae and one of the Iceni: and this last is attributed to the Country of
the Silures; Tacitus names them in an old Copy: the Nation of the Silures was
changed with no fierceness, nor with clemency, but that they would exercise
War. And in the life of Agricola that the Silures passed into Britain, he
conjectures as a Colony of the old Iberi, that says he, their colored looks
and curled hair for the most part, and their situation, over against Spain
cause a belief that the old Iberi passed over, and possessed those places. And
in the same Book; Julius also Frontinus sustained the brunt, a great man, as
far as he might: and overcame in arms the strong and stout Nation of the
Silures. Ptolemy made the Demeta the utmost people of the Island toward the
West; and the Silures after them more to the East. Amongst them is the Wy or
Vaga, the limit betwixt the Gloucestershire and Monmouth-shire men. In former
times this City was called Caer-Went.

TRAJECTUS. M. P. IX.] This is named by Antoninus over against Abonis where
there was wont to be a passage over the Sabrinian Sea, at a place which is
called to this day Oldbury, (i. e.) Vetus Burgus, now a days they pass over a
little beneath at Aust a Village.

signifies a Monestery.

is now called Marlburrow, named so perhaps from Marga in Plinnie which they now
call Marl, and wherewith, as by a kind of Melioration, they dung their Land as
with a kind of Chalk. For it is ridiculous to deduce it from Merlin the Wizard,
which yet however some anciently have ventered to do.

torpescentibus, admodum salubres. Humfredus Lhydus in sua Britanniae
descriptione efficacis earum virtutis se certissimum testem esse scribit. Nam
cum ex ictu inquit, equi Mediolani in Italia accepto gravissimo dolor
ischiadico duodecim continuis mensi^us laborarem, diversisque doctissimorum
medicorum auxiliis non convalescerem, his balneis cum tantum sex diebus usus
es^em, sanitati pristinae restitutus sum. Guil. Malmesburiensis de Gestis
Pontif. lib. II. Julium Caesarem earum auctorem fuisse tradidit; cum tamen has
parts illum nunquum adiis^e certo constet and, quod multo mage rediculum,
Equitum Balnei Ordinem heic primum eum instituis^e, (qualia sunt fere
Monachorum deliramenta:) idem sommat. Britannorum Commentarii, quorum nescio in
hac re an major auctoritas, ad Bladudum referunt veterem Britanniae rege^:
Quippe eum, cum cives suos jam rudes, and agrestes huminitates excolere
cuperet, studio literarum in Graeciam profectum esse, diuque Athenis operam
summis magistris dedisse. Inde digressum quatuor secum philosophos adduxisse,
qui Graecorum arts and disciplinas public in Britannia traderent. Ipsum vero
ut in omni liberali doctrina politus erat, ita in ea sapientia qua T. Magiam
alii, alii Necromantiam vocant, excellentem fuisse: and tandem progressu
temporis in opido quoda^, quod aedificasset ipse, quodque obeam rem (...)
Ptolemaeus vocat, calidas and m^dicatas aquas effecisse narrant. Certe
Necromantiam non posse effici, nisi sicubi loca sulphuratis and calidis aquis
Scaturiunt, ex veterum scriptis docet Servius ad Aeneidos VI. Britannos vero
olim tantis ceremonijs Magiam celebrasse, ut eam Persis dedisse viderentur,
auctor est Plinius in libri XXX. proaemio. Deinde referunt eadem art atque
audacia adhibita volare pennis innixum Bladudum hunc contendisse; idque ei
perhelle alliquandiu processisse. Verum dum longius connititur, Icarum in medio
cursu and artem and pennas defecisse, atque alte de subito cadentem, ad
Templum, quod eo quoque opido Apollini consecrasset, allisum peri^sse. Et de
Bladudo quidem hactenus Britannorum Commentarij. Quia vero Templum heic ad
Thermas Apollini dicatum proditur, ut inde Aquae Solis loco nomen inditum
suspicemur, (...), ut ille ait.

Certe major percrebrescit fama quae de Minervae heic aede posita diditur in
vulgus, quam etiam firmat Julii Solini testimonium, sic enim ille de Thermis in
Britannia (quas cave alias nobis investiges, quam Solis has aquas:) verba
faciens. Polyhistoris cap. XXXV. sive ut in Salmasiana editione habetur, XXII.
In Britannia magna, inquit, and multa flumina, fontes calidi opiparo ex culti

(...).


Quae nos ita reddidimus. Thermopylis olim huic caesta diva Minerva

Fuisse quidem apud veteres omnia (...) Sacra etiam Aristoteles docet, caussam

ut utrique Deo eorum tutela sit dicata. Erant quippe (...) Hercules and
Minerva, quod ex Strabone docemur in (...). ubi Augustum reposuisse narrat
(...) ab Antonino sublatos ex insula Samo. De praecipuo autem utriusque Numinis
apud gentes occidentales cultu, atque adeo ipsos Britannos, vide BELISAMA and
HERCULIS Promontorium.

Caeterum, ut heic quidem taceamus regionem quandam Mediolani, urbis Italiae,
fuisse, quae diceretur Herculeum Lavacrum aut Herculea Balnea; quod Ausonius in
Urbibus indicat isto versu. Et Regio Herculei celebris sub honor lavacri;
The Royal honor of Herculean Baths.


In hac ipsa quoque urbe nonnulla occurrunt monumenta, cultus ejus heic olim
luculenta indicia. In moenibus enim, inter portas Australem and Borealem, imago
ejus utraque manu serpentem constringentis extat; in Borealem quoque and
Occidentalem alia quaedam, sed nuda, ejusdem imago duos itidem serpents
comprimentis visenda apparet. Earum meminit Guil. Harrisonus, qui ipse
diligenter olim inspexit, praeter Harrison. Descript. Britan. lib. II. cap. 14.
Camdenum; qui effigiem insuper ejus sublata sinistra, cum clava dextra ibidem
cerni testatur.

Quantum ad Minervae tutelam hujus loci attinet, cum a Julio Solino scriptore
antiquo proditum sit calidis hisce fontibus Minervam sive Palladem praefuisse,
satis sibi esse ait idem Camdenus, si ex ejus anctoritate evicerit, hanc urbem
esse, quam Caer-Palladour sua lingua Britanni veteres dixerunt; hoc est urbs
Palladiae aquae, si Latin interpreteris: apposite enim, inquit, res, nomen and
significatio conspirant.

Quare quaedam aquae ealeant, quaedam etiam ferveant, plures caussae reddantur,
inquit Seneca Natural. Quaest. lib. III. cap. 24. Empedocles existimat ignibus,
quos multis locis terra opertos tegit, aquam calescere, si subjecti sunt solo,
per quod aquis transcursus est. Sed disputationem de hac re proponere, non est
instituti nostri. Illud satis est annotasse, calidos hos fontes, quorum aqua
sulphur and bitumine percolatur, ebullire maxim ad radiorum solis accessum a
XII. scilic^t matutina ad horam III. pomeridianam: quo tempore foedissimas

memorat Plinius lib. (...). 103. qui dulci^ circa meridiem and maxim frigidus;
mox paulatim tepes^ens ad noctis mediam fervore and amaritudine infestatur;
idque occulta aliqua nec prorsus diversa, masculi illius syderis vi atque
virtute. Certe ipsum hunc fontem, nomine his nostris magis consono, Aquam Solis
nuncupat Q. Curtius lib. IV. cujus verba huc transcribere non pigebit: Est
aliud, inquit, Hammonis nemus, in medio habet fontem Aquam Solis vocant. Sub
lucis ortum tepida manat; medio die, cum vehementissimus est calor, frigida
eadem sl^it; inclinato in vesperam calescit, media nocte servida exestuat:
quoque propius nox vargit ad lucem, (...) ex (...) calore decr^scit, donec sub
ipsum diei ortum assu^to tepore languescat.

Porro de nostris hisce Solis Aquis, sive Thermis, quae medendis corporibus
salubres adeo perhibentur, mihi non tempero, quin elegantissimos Challimachi
Cyrenaei versus usurpem, qui Hymno (...) extant. (...),

Having said so much concerning the Bath, I should highly offend against
gratitude if I should here omit his name whose house in London is as another
Akemanchester, and so would prove if Merlins prophecy should be fulfilled,
which I neither believe nor fear. The gentle cure of the Palsy effected upon
me this year makes me never think of him, but withal I have a remembrance of
the excellent Physician Apis who cures Aeneas in Virgils twelfth Book, these
are the excellent Verse wherein he describes him. Jamque aderat Phaebo ante
alios dilectus Iapis
Iasides: acri quondam cui captus amore
Ipse suas arts, sua munera laetus Apollo
Augurium citharamque dabat, celeresque sagittas.
Ille, ut depositi proferr^t fata parentis,
Scire potestates herbarum, usumque medendi
Maluit, and mutas ag tare inglorius arteis.
Stabat acerba fremens, ingentem nixus in hastam
Aeneas, magno juvenum, and maerentis Iuli
Concursu, lacrimisque immobilis, ille retorto
Peonium in morem senior succinctus amictu,
Multae manu medica, Pbaebique potentibus herbis
Nequicquam trepidat, nequicquam spicula dextra
Sollicitat, prensatque tenaci forcipe ferrum:
Nulla viam fortuna regit, nihil auctor Apollo
Subvenit, and saevus campis magis, ac magis horror
Crebescit, propiusqu: malum est. Jam pulvere coelum
Stare vident, subeunt equites, and spicula castris
Densa cadu^t (...): it tristis ad aethera clamor
Bellantum Juvenum, and duro sub Mart cadentum.
Heic Venus indigno ^ati concussa dolor
Dictamnum genetrix Cretaea carpit ab Ida,
Puberi^us caulem folijs, and flore comantem
Purpureo, non illa feris incognita capris.
Gramina, cum tergo volucres haesere sagittae,
Hoc Venus obscuro faciem circundata nimbo
Detulit, hoc ^usum labris splendentibus amnem
Inficit, occulte medicans, spargitque salubreis
Ambrosia succos, and ^doriferam Panaceam.
Fovit ea (...) lympha longaevus Iapis
Ignorans, subitoque omnis de corpore fugit
Quippe dolor: omnis stetit imo vulnere sanguis,
Jamque secuta manum, nullo cogente sagitta
Excidit, atque novae rediere in pristina vires.
Iapis Phoebus minion, now was there,
To whom the God did such affection bear,
That his own Gifts on him he did bestow,
His prophesying Spirit, Harp, and Bow,
That he might long defer the fatal hour
Of his old Father, he the use and power
Of Simples learnt, and to himself imparts,
By study, knowledge of despised arts.
Aeneas chafing, leaned upon a Spear,
With sad Iulus, and great concourse there,
Nor is he moved nor troubled at their tears,
Then old Iapis many things prepares,
His Vest girt back in the Peonian guise,
And Phoebus powr'full herbs in vain applies;
Vainly he labors to draw forth the steel,
Tries with his probe, and does with pincers feel;
No way will hit, no aid Apollo yields;
And horror more and more raged in the Feilds;
Dust clouds all Heaven, the horse draws near the wall,
Dangerous it grows, shafts midst the Camp do fall;
The cries of valiant Soldiers scale the Sky,
And those that in the bloody battle dye.
Here Venus troubled at her Sons deep wound,
Brought Dittanie, in Cretan Ida found;
The stalk has sprouting leaves, and on the Crown
A purple Flower, not to wild Goats unknown,
When winged Arrows in their backs are fixed;
Veild with a Cloud, this beauteous Venus mixed,
With purest water, in a Bowl, and strews
The healing moisture of Ambrosian dews,
And with its sweetest Pa^ax did compound (wound:
With which the old man, not knowing, bathed the
Then from his body straight all anguish fled,
And now the wound no more, though mighty, bled;
The steel now, uncompell'd, follows the hand,
And strength returns unto its old command.

VINDONUM. M. P. XV.] The Segontiaci were a people Hant-shire.
of Britain which yielded themselves to Caesar, and inhabited the Northen
parts of the Hundred of Holeshot, and their principal Silcester.
City was Vindonum Segontiacorum, by the Britains it was called Caer-Segont, as
at this day it is called Silcesier. The distance between Calleva and Venta
Belgarum in Antoninus persuades me to what I say here: as for what Richard de
Basingstoake says here concerning Vindonum of Gaul, I matter it nothing, nor
heed it no more then what he says concerning Sicula, in other writers, a Town
of the lower Germany, which he makes our Silcester in England. Ninnius and
others will have this City built by Constantius the Father of Constantine the
Great, and that it was named Murimintu^, for Muri-l indum, but elsewhere you
shall have more of this, in the mean while let this content you.

BRIGE. M. P. XI.] Or Brage an ancient Town mentioned Han^hire.
by Ptolemy nine miles distant from Sorb^odunum or Salsberry called Broughton,
near by the Banks of the River Test: otherwise it was overthrown when in the
time of William the Norman all things were rooted up, to make a Park there.
Whether it has any thing to do with that Brige in the third Book of Beda's
Ecclesiastical History, I had rather others should enquire. In loco qui
dicitur Brige. And a little after, Maxim in Brige and in Cale, and in
Andilegum M^asterio.

SOR BIODUNUM. M. P. VIII.] Besides the Frigid deductions Salisbury.
of the ancient name of this famous Town Severia and of Sarisburia, from either
Saron in Berosus, or Severus the Emperor of this name from the signification
which one well skilled in British Catalogue Epispocorum Sarisbur.
assured Camden was as much as collis siccus, or a dry Hill, for good reasons
which he alleges: I will only add the mistake of Francis Goodwin, who in his
learned work voucheth the name of Ptolemy for Antonins, for Sorbiodunum. The
rest I refer the reader to Camden for.

VINDOCLADIA. M. P. XII.] Which now is called Wimburnminster. It gained the
name from the situation: for Windugledy sounds as much in British as between
two Swords. Now that Rivers are called so, by a peculiar phrase or manner of
speaking, is known to all who are acquainted with the Antiquity of
Milford-haven, and is better known then that I need any way to tell. The latter
Wimburn is from Saxon deduction where Burn signifies by a River.

DURNONOVARIA. M. P. IX] This Town of principal note was called as the passage
of a River, and in Ptolemy it is according Dorsetshire.
to the variety of copies, (...), and (...) in English is called Dorchester,
and there are many Emperors Coyns found there, but the vulgar call them King
Dornies pennies, besides the military ways which appear there.

MORIDUNO. MP. XXXVI.] This is Seaton in Devonshire, between Dorchester and
Exeter. The fite in both Languages gives the name; as if he would say, the
Town on an Hill by the Sea. In Pentingers Tables so often mentioned, it is
called Ridnnum: but it is plain that the Book is corrupted.

Isca Dumnoniam Full. solin. editione lib. 3.
ISCADUMNUNNIORUM. M. P. XV.] They are otherwise called in Ptolemy (...) the
Devonshire men. Their other names out of Strabo and others we are to consult
Camden for; that denoted the Romans residing here; because it was called Camer.
afterward Urbs Sicariorum.
Caer-Ruffian, now it is Exeter.
