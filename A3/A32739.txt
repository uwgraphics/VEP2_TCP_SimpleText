FOR THE CHRISTIAN READER.
THis great and glorious work of Reformation, both been promoving upon the
wheels of Gods Providence thirteen years; The Lord who is omnipotent, could
h^v^ done all as perfectly at once, as in the duration and succession of many
ages, yet is he rat^er plea^ed by graduall accesses, to ^romo^e his own
operat^ons to the period of their perfect accomplishment. The Lord continued
the great work of his first Creation six days, when he might have done it as
soon as he raised Lazarus out of the grace, by the word of his mouth. The Lord
might have finished this great and g^orious work of Reformation at the ending
of the twenty seventh of Ju^y, 1637 But that his long contesting with the
contumacy of obstinate men, might make much more for the manifestation of his
power and glory, by so many wonders, changes, and battles, as also to show his
unconceavable love and free mercy in Jesus Christ, toward his poor
long-suffering covenanted people by their so many strange deliverances, And
then to show forth the gl^ry of his Justice in the great variety of his
Judgments upon so many obstinate opposers of this glorious w^rk, who now by
their obstin to res^sting the work of the Lord, have gotten the name of
Malignants. Whose hearts at yet God ha^dens and makes fat, and their ear^s
heavy, and shuts their eyes, lest they should s^e, and hear with their ears,
and understand with their heart^, and so convert and be healed; Sensual eyes
and ears, with strength of natural parts they lack not: But illumination, and
a spiritual apprehension of the use of Gods great works, and of the way of his
dispensation, in order to his own ends, they perceive, see, nor know not. That
it may evide^t^y appear, that all the wonders that can he wroug^t before their
ey^s, without the work of grace will nev^r avail for man's conversion; such is
the obstinacy of men, that they will not consider the sinfulness of their sin,
in their ^aring so to oppose the w^rk of the Lord: they conceive not how near
their sin is unto that sin which is unto death, 1 John 5. 16 When as poor silly
Curres they bark against heaven, the Saints, and the bright Sun of
righteousness, when Es^u-like, mocking not only the po^r in heart, but the
King of Saints himself, wh^ when he calls and knocks, str^tching out his arms
daily: they will not hear, and Phar^oh-like, have their refuge to the arm of
flesh, not considering that the holy Covenant, is as oil among the liquors
which will ever be upmost, they will not be cured; they will not believe, but
still practice against the holy Covenant with gnashing of teeth, and when they
have laid their account by their laborious policy, to bring ^bott ^he^r own
ends, they shall in end find, that they shall bring about nothing but Gods
purpose^ t^ their own confusion, and the lamentable ruin of their estates and
houses How rare a thing is it to see amongst them a since^e convert; in what a
deplorable and Christl^sse way go they to Scaffol^s, without con^rition,
fear, or trembling, but also as it were to a Stage play, scoffing and
contemning the censures of the Church, and Gods holy Ordinances, brainsick,
and giddie, with too much drinking of strong waters, at the very periods and
when they are about to enter in the very gulf of endless Eternity But he who is
love it self, ^v^n the God of love; had tho^ghts of l^v^ and mercy toward
this truly Noble and H^ly man, Alexander Charters who did long follow the
drove, of the perish^ng multitude, being long wrapped up in the guiltiness of
^alignancy: yet in him, the greatness of Gods love and free mercy has
appeared, that the Lord has still loved him, ev^n when he was burning and
b^yling in his lusts, when his heart and his hand were both lifted up against
Christ and his Saints, yet has the Virgins Son overlooked all, and by this
rare example of mercy, picked out this bla^k Swan, to make of a poor sinner a
^e^t Saint, and of a persecutour, a Preacher as may be seen by this
under-writen Declaration, written and subscribed with his own hand, before
Famous witness^s.

The Declaration of Capt. ALEXANDER CHARTERS.
GOod Christian people, God, in his wise providence, has thought fit to make
me an example of public justice a^ this time, that all those who have not
fallen, may be strengthened and confirmed in the way of truth, and others who
have bin, and are going on in those wicked courses, for the which now I am
punished, may be reclaimed, which is that my soul does desire, and shall pray
the Lord to open the eyes of their understanding, that they may see the
fearful guiltiness lies upon their souls, and the wrath of God hanging above
their heads for the same, that so by sincere and speedy repentance they may
turn unto the Lord, that the riches of his free grace may be evidenced in their
conversion, that they may all be made partakers of that eternal life, which I
trust through the merits of my Redeemer to be made partaker of, when this
natural life that I have now to lay down shall be taken from me; And truly, I
cannot enough magnify Gods free love unto me, that he did not destroy me when
I was in the height and heat of a sinful course, sighting against his cause,
but has reserved me unto this time, that the glory of his free love might be
so much the more magnified and extolled: Which cause he has so truly owned to
be his own by so many evident and undeniable arguments, that I dare say the
greatest enemy and opposer of the same, if he speak in conscience, and not
wilfully blind fold his eyes, will say as much. For look back to the beginning
of these troubles, and you shall clearly perceive that what ever was plotted or
contrived against the Lords people or his cause in this land, turned directly
to the shame of the contrivers and plotters, and how the Lord has rewarded the
prime opposers, both Churchmen and great Politicians, to a great many of you
is very well known. Secondly, look upon the prime undertakers employed against
this work (I am bound in all charity, to believe that our late Sovereign from
whom they did purchase commission, is now with the Lord) were men more
regarding their own private interest, then the glory of God, or the Kings
interest, which they had so much in their mouths; as was seen by the
consequence in joining with, and giving Commissions to persons desperately
sworn enemies and opposers to the true Reformed Religion, and how those men
should have advanced the same, or been faithful to our King, professing the
said Religion, I leave it to all indifferent religious and rational men to
judge. And though the Lord suffered the Rod of those wicked men to lie upon the
back of the righteous for a time, and that they did shed the blood of Gods
people like water, and made the fields and cities of this land to swim there
with, yet at last how the Lord did over take those bloody Irishes, Papists, and
others with his vengeance, and of late the prime undertakers, is not unknown to
you all; For the which this land has how reason to rejoice in the Lord, that
the strength of the wicked and malignant party is how broken, and all their
plots and machinations fully discovered: And the same Lord that has delivered
you from fear of the enemies within, will likewise deliver you from the great
threatenings of the insulting enemies of the neighbor lands, If you prove
thankful for this mercy and deliverance you have received, and keep close with
God by adhering courageously to his cause and Covenant. I shall now crave
pardon to speak a word concerning our now gracious King, whom I pray God bless
with length of days, and put the wicked from about him, that his throne may be
established in righteousness: And it is thus, that what Commissions have been
granted by him, (nay I may rather say, extorted) against this nation, that the
Subjects of this Kingdom may not conceive prejudice against him for the same,
or think, that of his natural disposition he inclined to that course he was
led upon, or that in any way he had, or has thoughts against the good of
Religion; No, God forbid you should thus think, but impute it rather to the
cunning and malice of those who purchased them, and to the immaturity of his
years, who at that time was too flexible to their counsels, For I dare boldly
say, and am very hopeful, that if the Lord put faithful counselors about
him, he shall prove as gracious a King as ever ruled this Nation: You will
pardon this my digression, I will now return to what concerns my self and
present condition.

Good People,

You see me here ready to lay down my life by a just sentence of Parliament, I
am an object for Gods mercy and your prayers, The sentence for which I am now
to receive this public punishment, was given forth against me, for joining
with those desperately wicked enemies to Religion, of the which I was speaking
just now; for the which I do not only stand guilty of temporal death by the
law of this land; but also of the eternal wrath of God, without his free mercy
in Christ Jesus my Redeemer, if I should be rewarded according to the merit of
my offense; For how fearful a guiltiness lies upon my conscience (I will now
glorisie God by a confession, though I should bring shame upon my self) I
shall now declare, that all those that hear me, may pray to the Lord to pardon
this my public guiltiness, and all other my personal faults and offenses
which are past number, yet the Lords mercy is above all his works, and through
the blood of the New Covenant, I hope all those my sins shall be purged and
washed away.

When this land did first enter into Covenant with God, Anno, 1638. I did swear
and subscribe the same, and did engage personally in the service in England the
first year; But what a fearful defection I made, by joining afterward with the
enemies of the doctrine and discipline, which I swore by that Covenant to
maintain, and the breaking of my vows to God for personal Reformation, which I
was likewise sworn unto, it is known to God and my own conscience, and not
unknown to some here present. And truly I must ingenuously confess, and that
with a sorrowful heart, that in all the courses I have been upon ever since,
in opposition to that Covenant, there was ever reluctance within, and some
light of conscience checking me, which I bore down, and smothered by setting
before my eyes worldly respects, as favor of Princes, and great men, and (that
enemy to my salvation) the point of honor, never to relinquish a cause though
never so bad; for which I do now acknowledge my unfeigned sorrow and
repentance, and begs pardon at the Throne of Grace for this my guiltiness.

And now I come to make known unto you, how Satan dealt with me when he drew me
to this Apostasy, and shall desire if there be any that are now my hearers, who
are or have been covenant-breakers, may examine themselves, if the like way
Satan has used with them, that so they may repent, and those that have not
fallen, may stand fast and be watchful by my example, to avoid such snares:
And first before I made public defection from the cause, Satan got in upon me
by seducing me to personal vices, in particular, drunkenness, and all other
vices acompanying that, as whoredom, swearing, profane and filthy
communication, lying, brawling and quarrelling, abuse of the creatures, nay in
a word, from a rational creature to become worse then a beast; of all which
vices and many more, occasioned by that sin, my soul is now guilty. Thus having
begun to grow dissolute and profane in my life, by giving my self over to
commit all manner of wickedness with wantonness and greediness, sin became
so customary, as the conscience thereof was quite gone, I became careless of
all religious duties, by profaning the Sabbath, neglecting all the public
Ordinances of Gods worship, as receiving the Sacrament, hearing of Sermons,
public or private prayer, nay in a word, I became a contemner of the Gospel,
a despiser of Gods servants, and a mocker of all that made conscience of
religious duties, or walking strictly before God, so that Religion became a
thing so indifferent unto me, that I could, and did go as frequently and more
to Mass, and to Idolatrous Churches, as to the reformed, when I was beyond the
Sea; And at my return to England, for Common Prayer I made no scruple of it:
being there, I joined my self with those parties that pretended for the King,
and how wickedly I lived there, the Lord he knows, and grant me pardon for the
same, for though naturally I inclined too much to wickedness, yet evil
society helped it; when I had thus lived for a while, the Lord essayed to
reclaym me by the Rod of Imprisonment, but in stead of making a sanctified use
of that affliction, I became worse, and lived more dissolutely in Prison, then
I had done before; so that my heart grew more and more hardened in wickedness.
Being got free out of prison, in stead of returning to Scotland, as I was
advised by my well wishers, I went back to Oxford, where I joined again to that
party I had been formally with, but remaining there but some few months, I was
engaged with Montrosse, he undertaking by his means, as he caled it, to reduce
Scotland to obedience But entering at Dumfreis, his stay was short, and his
success not great, where I left him, and did never again see him, whil he had
with his bloody Irishes and others his wicked Associates, made havoc of the
people of God in several conflicts: And after that deplorable fight of
Kilsyth, Satan again enticed me to join with that wick^d crew, but the Lord
did not suffer them long to prosper, in their w^ckednesse, for what reward they
received for their former cruelties and blood-sh^d, there may be some here were
eyewitnesses: And for my self, The Lord again showed h^mselfe displeased with
my ways, by making me prisoner, where I was kept in Sterling for a twelve
month; but the civility I received there being such, and my liberty not much
restrained, I did not take it as an affliction from God, never taking notice of
Gods hand or displeasure against me for opposing his cause; I being released
from that easy restraint (I cannot call it imprisonment) returned to that
place of the Kingdom, where I had greatest interest: and after I had given a
seeming satisfaction to the Church (I must ingenuously acknowledge the
deceitfulness and hypocrisy of my own heart, for it was not cordial) I was
after some conference with the ministry, admitted to subscribe the mutual
League and Covenant. Truly, at that time I did it something unwillingly, not
being desirous to join with those in England, I did conceive were enemies to
Monarchical Government, and no great friends to the person of our late King,
as by woeful experience we have seen prove too true: yet though there be a
wicked party now prevailing in England, who have shaken often all fear of God, by
subverting Religion, allowing of a detestable mixture of all Sects and
Heresies, destroying the Lords anointed our late Sovereign, and keeping in
exile our present King, overthrowing Monarchy, and in a word tollerating all
Atheism and prophanity; yet I am consident there is a party in that Kingdom,
who makes conscience of that Covenant, and whom the Lord will at last raise up,
though at present they be borne down by the tyranny of the Sectaries, and that
God will make them and the faithful party of this land, isntrumental for the
reestablishing and restoring Religion in doctrine and discipline to that
purity, which God in his word has allowed, and (it shall be my prayer) our now
gracious King to his just rights and inheritance.

Thus when I had lived for a time in the country, making little conscience of
performing either public or private duties to God, delighting more in the
society of those who were no great friends to his cause, then in the faithful
servants of God, or those made conscience to walk more strictly in their
ways; At last I was engaged in that late dishonorable Engagement in England;
what success that had, and how the Lord showed his wrath against us, by
rubbing dishonor upon our Nation, and punishment upon a great many both
leaders and others, I need not to relate; And among the rest, the Lord did
again afflict me with imprisonment; then, while the Rod was upon me, I began in
some measure to humble my self before the Lord, and to seek him more earnestly,
by making conscience both of public and private duties: and I was not wanting
of making vows and promises, that if the Lord would then deliver me from that
affliction, I should become a new creature, and forsake my former sinful
courses; but alas, It proved but a hypocritical ^lash, for no sooner had the
Lord removed his Rod, and restored me to my former liberty, but with the dog to
the vomit, and the sow to the pudle, fell I back to my former sinful course of
living. So returning from England, I went to Holland, vomiting out against the
cause of God, and the persons who had the chief managing of affairs, both in
State and Church, all the malicious invective raylings, and bitter expressions
that I could devise. And there again did I associate my self with James
Grahame, he having purchased, or as I said before, rather extorted a Commission
from this King to enter this Kingdom, that he might be the only man, (as he
would have made the world believe) to set the Crown upon his Majesty's Head.
But how the Lord has disappointed his vain projects, by bringing him to this
kingdom to make him a public example of justice, where he had been so
isntrumental in the shedding of the blood of Gods people, is known to you all.
And I cannot but acknowledge the great mercy of God to me in particular, who
while I was in the late fight, where I was grievously wounded and taken
prisoner, that the Lord did not destroy me as he did many others who fell by
the sword, but has reserved me to this time, where though I am to receive this
temporal judgment for my body, yet my hope is, that he intends mercifully for
my soul.

Now the main things that are to be here observed, are, First Gods deliverance
of his people from the Rods of their oppressors, though it did lie upon them
for a time, for some reasons seeming good to our only wise God. That so ye that
are Gods people of this land, who have faithfully adhered to his cause, may
stand fast, and those who have the public managing of affairs in Church and
State may prove faithful, and neither upon the one hand incline to that
accursed course of Malignancy, which the Lord has shown evidences of his
wrath against so much; nor upon the other hand, to the associating, or any
ways countenancing those Sectaries of the neighbor Kingdoms, enemies to
Religion and all Government; But that all the Land, Rulers and people, would
with their hearts and spirits, be thankful to the Lord for his former mercies,
and seek him in sincerity in time coming without by-respects or ends, only
having the glory of God, and the good of Religion before your eyes, and
consequently, the King (then) will get what is due. This being done, fear not,
but the Lord will deliver you from all your fears, (though they seem great)
and get glory to himself, in the destruction of all those shall rise up against
him; though they seem now to build on the high clifts of the Rocks, and that
the foundations they have laid are very strong, yet the Lord will let it be
seen, who builds not upon him, the foundation is sandy, and the building shall
not be of long continuance.

The next thing I would have taken notice of, is, That all those of my kindred
or acquaintance, and all others who ever have joined, or would join (if
occasion should offer) against the cause of God, would take notice of Gods
judgments against all who have hitherto opposed his work; and how that he has
carried on the same in despite both of all public opposition, and all secret
plotings and Machinations; Which things if they will lay to heart, and
seriously consider, and seek in unto God by unfeigned repentance for their
former guiltiness, and now prove themselves faithful at this nick of time, in
standing for the maintenance of his truth, they may be sure to meet with a
merciful God, who is slow to anger, long-suffering, and abounding in mercy:
But after so much convincing light, and so clear evidences of the wrath of God
against all the opposers of his truth, if they will still persevere in their
former ways, and malice to God, his cause, and servants, they shall be sure,
if God shall not overtake them with temporal judgments here; they shall not
escape, without repentance, his everlasting wrath.

The last thing which I shall now desire you to take notice of, is Gods dealing
with me in particular, who notwithstanding of the whole sinful course of my
life which I have been relating, both in relation to public and personal
guiltiness, has dealt so mercifully with me. And I shall draw to a period by
declaring how the Lord convinced my conscience of guiltiness. For being now
this while bypast in prison, I began after some few days were spent, to run
through some former passages of my life, and finding that I had twice relapsed,
I conceived by the laws of this kingdom, I could expect nothing but death;
yet being hopeful that friends would use all the ways they could for my
safety, (which truly was not wanting). It did not much sink into my mind; yet
sinding all worldly means to fail, and that death was determined by a certain
day (which afterward by a Petition I gave in, was prolonged for a week) then
began the terrors thereof to dismay, and much to dash me; but casting my eyes
beyond death, upon etetnity: and casting up the account of my former misspent
life, both for public and personal guiltiness, and laying before my eyes the
extremity and perpetuity of the pains of hell due to me for same, I was
extremely dejected and casten down, and the fear thereof made me frequently to
burst forth in tears. Thus finding the weight of sin, and of Gods justice lying
upon my soul, I was still seeking and striving to find out some way in my self
to satisfy Justice, but in this I found much matter of discouragement, and no
comfort, till God in his mercy did hold forth to me a better remedy, and laid
down a more sure foundation, by flying from the law to the Covenant of free
Grace, and free Love, which was opened up and explained to me by Gods servants
of the Ministry, and several other good Christians, that gave me a charitable
visit in that my distressed condition, for the which the Lord comfort their
souls in the day of their trials and Afflictions: And it shall now be my
prayer, and I shall desire the assistance of yours, that through the blood of
that Covenant, my sins may be washen away, and my soul may be received unto
eternal happiness, Amen.

At Edinburgh, 21 June, 1650. I do with Heart and Hand subscribe this
Declaration, ALEXANDER CHARTERS.
