THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
THese Mysteries, having lain by me for some time, I little thought once should
ever appeared to public view; especially in such a Scribbling age as this is,
wherein there is no end of making many Books: But having encouragement, and
approbation from some, I thought it not good to conceal any thing, that might
make for Gods glory, and Public profit. It Is far from my intentions (and I
hope my heart deceives me not in it) to seek hereby self-praise, or
self-applause, or that I might be known in the World, (good God! thou know
how vile I am, how unworthy to be numbered amongst thine Ambassadors,) but that
the Mystery of godliness might be more manifest, and perspicuous. We live in
an age that affords us a world of (which might indeed have been a strong
argument for me not to have written these) PARADOXES, which are not all
ORTHODOX; but (and I think I am not mistaken) thou have nothing here but
ORTHODOX PARADOXES. I must acknowledge they were very profitable to me, both
in making them, and in often reading them, yea the more I read them, the more I
gained by them; nay let me tell thee freely, I understood more in some things
by them, then ever I did before; many places of Scripture I could reconcile,
which before seemed to me really opposite: I wish thee (with all my heart) the
same profit, and more abundantly, so prays he
