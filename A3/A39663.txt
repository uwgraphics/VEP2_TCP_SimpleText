THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE OPENED: OR, A Display of Christ in his Essential and
Mediatorial Glory.

Wherein the IMPETRATION of our Redemption by Jesus Christ is orderly unfolded
as it was begun, carried on, and finished by his Covenant-transaction,
mysterious Incarnation, solemn Call and Dedication. Blessed Offices, deep
Abasement, and super-eminent Advancement.

In all which the great supernatural mystery of the wisdom and Love of God, in
his most gracious, plenary, and wonderful Salvation of sinners by Jesus Christ,
is distinctly explicated, and in its several parts as well as generally Applied
for the winning of Unbelievers to him, and the confirmation of all that do
believe in him.

LONDON, Printed by Rob. White, for Francis Tyton, at the three Daggers in
Fleetstreet. 1673.

To his much Honored and Beloved Kinsman Mr. John Flavell of London Merchant;
and his virtuous Consort; The Author wishes Grace, Mercy, and Peace.
My dear and honored Friends,
IF my Pen were both able, and at leisure to get glory in Paper, it would be
but a paper-glory when I had gotten it; but if by displaying (which is the
design of these papers) the transcendent excellency of Jesus Christ, I may win
glory to him from you, to whom I humbly offer them; or from any other into
whose hands providence shall cast them: that will be glory indeed, and an
occasion of glorifying God to all Eternity.

It is not the design of this Epistle to complement, but to benefit you. Not to
blazon your excellencies, but Christ's. Not to acquaint the world how much you
have endeared me to your self, but to increase and strengthen the endearments
betwixt Christ and you; upon your part. I might indeed (this being a proper
place for it,) pay you my acknowledgements for your great kindnesses to me and
mine; of which I assure you I have, and ever shall have deep resentments: but
you and I are Theater enough to one another, and can satisfy our selves with
the enclosed comforts and delights of our mutual love and friendship: but let
me tell you, the whole world is not a Theater large enough, to show the glory
of Christ upon: or unfold the one half of the unsearchable riches that lie hid
in him. These things will be far better understood, and spoken of in Heaven, by
the noon day Divinity in which the immediately illuminated Assembly do there
preach his praises; than by such a stammering tongue, and scribbling pen as
mine; which does but mar them.

Alas! I write his praises but by Moonlight. I cannot praise him so much as by
halves. Indeed, no tongue but his own (as Nazianzen said of Basil) is
sufficient to undertake that task. What shall I say of Christ! The excelling
glory of that object, dazles all aphension; swallows up all expression. When we
have borrowed metaphors from every Creature that has any excellency or lovely
property in it, till we have stripped the whole Creation bare of all its
ornaments; and clothed Christ with all that glory: when we have worn our
tongues to the stumps, in ascribing praises to him; alas! we have done nothing,
when all is done.

Yet woe is me! how do I every day behold reasonable souls, most unreasonably
disaffected to my lovely Lord Jesus! denying love to one, who is able to compel
love from the stoniest heart! yea, though they can never make so much of their
love (would they set it to sale) as Christ bids for it.

It Is horrid, and amazing to see; how the minds of many are captivated and
ensnared by every silly trifle. And how others can indifferently turn them with
a kind of spontaneity to this object, or to that; (as their fancy strikes)
among the whole universe of beings; and scarce ever reluctate, recoil, or
nauseate, till they be persuaded to Christ: and then, it is as easy to melt the
obdurate rocks into sweet syrrup, as their hearts into divine love.

How do the great men of the world ambitiously court the honors and pleasures
of it? the Merchants of the earth trade and strive for the dear bought
treasures of it; whilst the price of Christ (alas! ever too low) falls every
day lower and lower upon the Exchange of this world! I speak it as a sad truth,
if there were no quicker a trade (as dead as they say it is) for the perishing
treasures of the earth, than there is for Christ this day in England; the
Exchange would quickly be shut up, and all the Trading Companies dissolved.

Dear Sir, Christ is the Peerless Pearl hid in the field, Mat. 13.46. will you
be that wise Merchant that resolves to win and compass that treasure; whatever
it shall cost you? Ah Sir, Christ is a commodity that can never be bought too
dear.

My dear Kinsman, my flesh and my blood; my soul thirsts for your salvation,
and the salvation of your family. Shall you and I resolve with good Joshua,
that whatever others do, we and our families will serve the Lord. That we will
walk as the redeemed of his blood, showing forth his virtues, and praises in
the world? that as God has made us one in name, and one in affection; so we
may be one in Christ. That it may be said of us, as it was of Austin and
Alippius long ago; that they were sanguine christi conglutinati, glued together
by the blood of Christ.

For my own part, I have given in my name to him long since, woe to me, if I
have not given in my heart also; for should I deceive my self in so deep a
point as that, how would my profession as a Christian, my calling as a
Minister; yea, these very Sermons now in your hands, rise in judgment to
condemn me? which God forbid.

And doubtless, Sir, your eyes have seen both the vanity of all Creatures, and
the necessity and infinite worth of Christ. You cannot forget what a vanity the
world appeared to you, when in the year 1668. you were summoned by the
messengers of death, (as you and all that were about you then apprehended) to
shoot the gulf of vast eternity: when a malignant Fever, and Pleuresie
(whereof your Doct. Thomsons (...), page 91.
Physician has given an account to the world) did shake the whole frame of the
Tabernacle wherein your soul through mercy yet dwells; and long may it dwell
there, for the service and praise of your great deliverer. I hope you have not,
nor ever will forget; how the vain world then appeared to your eye; when you
looked back (as it were over your shoulder) and saw how it shrunk away from
you. Nor will you ever forget the awful apprehensions of Eternity, that then
seized your spirit; or the value you then had for Christ; which things I hope
still do, and ever will remain with you.

And for you, Dear Cousin, as it becomes a daughter of Sarah; let your soul be
adorned with the excellencies of Christ, and beauties of holiness. A King from
Heaven makes suit for your love. If he espouse your soul now, he will fetch it
home to himself at death; in his Chariot of salvation; and great shall be your
joy, when the Marriage of the Lamb is come. Look often upon Christ in this
glass; he is fairer than the Children of men. View him believingly, and you
cannot but like and love him. Ep. S.R.
For (as one well says) Love when it sees, cannot but cast out its spirit and
strength upon amiable objects; and things love worthy. And what fairer thing
than Christ! Oh fair Sun, and fair Moon, and fair Stars, and fair flowers, and
fair Roses, and fair Lilies, and fair Creatures: but oh ten thousand, thousand
times fairer Lord Jesus! alas, I wronged him, in making the comparison this
way. O black Sun and Moon; but oh fair Lord Jesus! O black Flowers, and black
Lilies, and Roses; but O fair, fair, ever fair Lord Jesus! O all fair things,
black, deformed and without beauty; when ye are set beside the fairest Lord
Jesus. O black Heavens, but O fair Christ! O black Angels but O surpassingly
fair Lord Jesus!

I hope you both are agreed with Christ, according to the Articles of peace
propounded to you in the Gospel; and that you are every day driving on
Salvation work, betwixt him and you in your family, and in your Closets.

And now my Dear Friends, if these discoveries of Christ, which I humbly offer
to your hands; may be any way useful to your souls, to assist them either in
obtaining, or in clearing their interest in him; my heart shall rejoice, even
mine. For none under Heaven can be more willing, (though many are more able) to
help you thither, than is,

Your most affectionate and obliged Kinsman and Servant. John Flavell.
From my Study in Dartmouth March the 14. 1671.
To the Christian Readers, Especially those in the Town and Corporation of
Dartmouth; and Parts adjacent: who have either befriended, or attended these
Lectures.
Honored, and Worthy Friends,
KNowledge is man's excellency above the beasts that perish, Psalm. 32.9. the
knowledge of Christ is the Christians excellency above the Heathen, 1 Cor.
1.23, 24. Practical and saving knowledge of Christ is the Sincere Christians
excellency above the self-couzening hypocrite, Heb. 6.4, 6. but methodical and
well digested knowledge of Christ, is the strong Christians excellency above
the weak, Heb. 5.12, 13, 14. A saving though an immethodical knowledge of
Christ, will bring us to Heaven, Ioh. 17.2. but a regular, and methodical, as
well as saving knowledge of him; will bring Heaven into us, Col. 2.2, 3.

For such is the excellency thereof even above all other knowledge of Christ
that it renders the Understanding judicious, the Memory tenacious, and the
Heart highly and fixedly joyous. How it serves to confirm and perfect the
understanding, is excellently discovered by a worthy Divine of our own, in
these words.

Mr. Baxters Directions to the Converted for their establishment. p. 96.
A young ungrounded Christian when he sees all the fundamental truths, and
sees good evidence and reasons of them, perhaps may be yet ignorant of the
right order and place of every truth: It Is a rare thing to have young
Professors to understand the necessary truths methodically: and this is a very
great defect. For a great part of the usefulness and excellency of particular
truths, consists in the respect they have to one another. This therefore will
be a considerable part of your confirmation and growth in your understandings,
to see the body of the Christian doctrine, as it were at one view, as the
several parts of it are united in one perfect frame; and to know what aspect
one point has upon another; and which is their due places. There is a great
difference betwixt the sight of the several parts of a Clock or Watch, as they
are disjoynted, and scattered abroad; and the seeing of them conjoined, and in
use and motion. To see here a pin, and there a wheel, and not know how to set
them all together, nor ever see them in their due places; will give but little
satisfaction: it is the frame and design of holy doctrine that must be known,
and every part should be discerned as it has its particular use to that
design, and as it is connected with the other parts.

By this means only can the true nature of Theology, together with the harmony
and perfection of truth, be clearly understood. And every single truth also
will be much better perceived by him that sees its place, and order, than by
any other: for one truth exceedingly illustrates, and leads in another into the
understanding -- Study therefore to grow in the more methodical knowledge of
the same truths, which you have received; and though you are not yet ripe
enough to discern the whole body of Theology in due method, yet see so much as
you have attained to know, in the right order, and placing of every part. As in
Anatomy, it is hard for the wisest Physician to discern the course of every
branch of Veins, and Arteries; but yet they may easily discern the place and
order of the principal parts, and greater vessels ( and surely in the body of
Religion there runs not a branch of greater or more necessary truth than these)
so it is in Divinity, where no man has a perfect view of the whole, till he
come to the state of perfection with God; but every true Christian has the
knowledge of all the essentials, and may know the orders, and places of them
all.

And as it serves to render the mind more judicious, so it causes the Memory to
be more tenacious, and retentive of truths. The chain of truth is easily held
in the memory, when one truth links in another, but the loosing of a link
endangers the scattering of the whole chain. We use to say, order is the mother
of memory: Ordo est matter memoriae.
I am sure it is a singular friend to it: Hence it is observed, those that write
of the art of memory, lay so great a stress upon place and number. The memory
would not so soon be overcharged with a multitude of truths, if that multitude
were but orderly disposed. It Is the incoherence, and confusion of truths,
rather than their number that distracts. Let but the understanding receive them
regularly, and the memory well retain them with much more facillity. A bad
memory is a common complaint among Christians. All the benefit that many of you
have in hearing, is from the present influence of truths upon your hearts.
There is but little that sticks by you, to make a second and third impression
upon them. I know it may be said of some of you, that if your affections were
not better than your memories, you would need a very large charity to pass for
Christians. I confess it is better to have a well-ordered heart, than a
methodical head, but surely both are better than either. And for you that have
constantly attended these exercises, and followed us through the whole series,
and deduction of these truths, from text to text, and from point to point: who
have begun one Sabbath, where you left another; it will be your inexcusable
fault, if these things be not fixed in your understandings, and memories, as
nails fastened in a sure place; especially since providence has now brought to
your eyes, what has been so often sounding in your ears, which is no small
help to fix these truths upon you, and prevent that great hazard of them, which
commonnly attends bare hearing: for now you may have recourse, as often as you
will to them, view, and review them, till they become your own.

But though this be a great, and singular advantage, yet it is not all you may
have by a methodical understanding of the doctrine of Christ: it is more than a
judicious understanding them, or faithful remembering them, that you and I must
design; even the warm, vital animating influences of these truths upon our
Hearts, without which we shall be never the better; yea, much the worse for
knowing and remembering them.

Truth is the sanctifying instrument, Ioh. 17.17. the mould into which our
souls are cast, Romans 6.17. according therefore to the stamps and impressions it
makes upon our understandings, and the order in which truths lie there, will be
the depth, and lastingness of their impressions and influences upon the heart.
As the more weight is laid upon the seal, the more fair and lasting impress is
made upon the wax. He that sees the grounds and reasons of his peace and
comfort most clearly, is like to maintain it the more constantly.

Great therefore is the advantage Christians have by such methodical systems.
Surely they may be set down among the desiderata Christianorum, the most
desired things of Christians.

Diverse worthy modern pens have indeed undertaken this noble subject before me:
some more Mr. Wall's None but Christ.
succinctly: others more Mr. Isaac A^bros. h^s Looking to Jesus.
Copiously: These have done worthily, and their praises are in the Churches of
Christ: yet, such a breadth there is in the knowledge of Christ, that not only
those, who have written on this subject before me, but a thousand Authors more
may employ their pens after us, and not one interfere with, or straiten another.

And such is the deliciousness of this subject that were there ten thousand
Volumes written upon it, they would never cloy, or become nauseous to a
gracious heart. We use to say one thing tires, and it is true that it does so;
except that one thing be virtually, and eminently all things; as Christ is: and
then one thing can never tire. For such is the variety of sweetness in Christ,
who is the deliciae humanigeneru, the delights of the Children of men; that
every time he is opened to believers, from Pulpit, or Press; it is as if Heaven
had furnished them with a new Christ: and yet he is the same Christ still.

The Synopsis praefixed to this Treatise, will show you, that the method is
wholly new, and the Treatise it self will satisfy you, that I have not boasted
in another man's line; of things made ready to my hand: which I speak not in the
least to win any praise to my self, from the undertakement; but to remove
prejudices from it: for I see more defects in it, than most of my Readers will
see; and can forethink more faults to be found in it, than I shall now stand to
tell thee of, or make answer for. It was written in a time of great
distractions, and did thou but know how often this work has dyed, and revived
under my hand, thou would wonder, that ever it came to thine.

I am sensible it may fall under some censorious, (it may be envious) eyes; and
that far different judgments will pass upon it, for pro captu lectoris habent
sua fata libelli: and no wonder if a Treatise of Christ be, when Christ himself
was to some, a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. I expect not to
please every Reader, especially the envious, Seneca.
magna debet esse eloquentia, quae invitis placet. It is as hard for some to
look upon other men's gifts without envy, as it is to look upon their own
without pride: nor will I be any farther concerned with such Readers, than to
pity them; well knowing that every proud contempt, and envious censure is a
Granado that breaks in the hand of him that casts it.

But to the ingenious and candid Reader, I owe satisfaction for the obscurity
of some parts of this discourse, occasioned partly by the conciseness of the
style, and partly by the mistakes of the Printer.

For the first, I have this only to say, that I was willing to crowd as much
matter as I could into this number of sheets in thy hand, that I might therein
ease thee, both in thy pains, and purse. I confess these Sermons were Preached
in a more relaxed style, and most of these things were enlarged in the Pulpit,
which are designedly contracted in the Press; that the Volume might not swell
above the ability of common Readers. And it was my purpose at first to have
comprised the second part, viz. the Application of the Redemption that is with
Christ, unto sinners, in one Volume; which occasioned the contraction of this;
but that making a just Volume it self, must await another season to see the
light. If the Reader will be but a little the more intent, and considerate in
reading, this conciseness will turn to his advantage.

And for the mistakes that have happened in the Press, they are not (for the
most part) very material; and the principal ones are collected to your hand;
which being corrected before you read, the obscurity which is objected, will in
great part be thereby removed.

This may suffice to show the usefulness of such composures, and to prevent
offense; but something yet remains with me, to say to the Readers in general,
to those of this Town in special; and to the Flock committed by Christ to my
charge, more especially.

To Readers in general, according as their different states, God was in Christ,
reconciling the world to himself: say not, all this is nothing, except God had
told thee so, and appointed some to treat with thee about it; for he has
committed unto us the word of this reconciliation; say not, yea, that may be
from your own pity, and compassions for us, and not from any commission you
have for it: for we are Ambassadors for Christ, 1 Cor. 5.19.

Say not, O but my sins, my sins, are greater than can be forgiven; the
difficulties of my salvation too great to be overcome; especially by a poor
Creature as I am, that am able to do nothing, no not to raise one penny toward
the discharge of that great debt I owe to God: for here thou will find upon thy
Union with Christ, that there is merit enough in his blood, and mercy enough in
his bowels to justify, and save such an one as thou art. Yea, and I will add
for thine encouragement that it is a righteous thing with God to justify and
save thee, that can not pay him one penny of all the vast sums thou owe
him, when by the same rule of justice he condemns the most strict,
self-righteous Pharisee that thinks thereby to quit scores with him. It is
righteous for a judge to cast him that has paid 99 l. of the 100. which he
owed, because the payment was not full; and to acquit him, whose surety has
paid all, though himself did not, and freely confess that he cannot pay one
farthing of the whole debt.

(2.) If thou be a self-deceiving soul, that easily take up thy satisfaction
about thine interest in Christ, look to it as thou valuest thy soul, Reader,
that a fond, and groundless conceit of thine interest in Christ, do not
effectually, and finally obstruct a true, and saving interest in him. This is
the common and fatal error in which multitudes of souls are ensnared and
ruined: Quam multi saptissent, nisi se prius s^pere p^tassent. Seneca.
for look as a conceit of great wisdom hinders many from the attaining of it;
so, a groundless conceit that Christ is already thine, may prove the greatest
obstacle betwixt Christ and thee; but here thou will meet with many Rules that
will not deceive thee; trials that will open thy true condition to thee.

Thou sometimes reflectest upon the state of thy soul, and inquire is Christ
mine? may I depend upon it, that my condition is safe? thy heart returns thee
an answer of peace, it speaks as thou would have it; but remember (friend)
and mark this line, Thy final sentence is not yet come from the mouth of thy
judge;
and what if after all thy self flattering hopes, and groundless confidences a
sentence should come from him quite cross to that of thine own heart? where art
thou then? what a confounded person will thou be? Christless, speechless, and
hopeless all at once!

O therefore build sure for Eternity: take heed lest the loss of thine eternal
happiness, be at last imputed by thee to the deceitfulness, and laziness of
thine own heart; lest thy heart say to thee in Hell, as the heart of
Apollodorus seemed in his sufferings to say to him. (...).
I am the cause of all this misery to thee.

(3.) If thou be one whose heart is eagerly set upon this vain world, I beseech
thee take heed, lest it interpoe it self betwixt Christ and thy soul, and so
cut thee off from him for ever. O beware lest the dust of the earth getting
into thine eyes, so blind thee, that thou never see the beauty or necessity of
Christ. The God of this world so blinds the eyes of them that believe not. And
what are the sparkling pleasures that dazzle the eyes of some, and the
distracting cares that wholly divert the minds of others, but as a Napkin drawn
by Satan over the eyes of them that are to be turned off into Hell, 1 Cor. 4.3,
4.

Some general aims, and faint wishes after Christ thou may have, but alas!
the world has centered thy heart, entangled thy affections, and will daily
find new diversions for thee, from the great business of life. So that if the
Lord break not this snare, thou will never be able to deliver thy soul.

(4.) If thou be a loose and careless professor of Christ; I beseech thee, let
the things thou shall read in this Treatise of Christ, convince, shame, and
reclaim thee, from thy vain conversation. Here thou will find how contrary thy
conversation is, to the grand designs of the death, and resurrection of
Christ. O methinks, as thou art reading the deep humiliation and unspeakable
sorrows Christ underwent, for the expiating of sin, thou should thenceforth
look upon sin as a tender Child would upon that knife, that stabbed his Father
to the heart! Thou should never whet, and sharpen it again, to wound the Son
of God afresh. To such loose, and careless professors, I particularly recommend
the last general use of this discourse, containing many great motives to
reformation, and strict Godliness, in all that call upon the name of the Lord
Jesus.

(5.) If thou have been a profane and vain person, but now art pardoned, and
do experience the super-abounding riches of grace; my request to thee is,
that thou love Jesus Christ with a more fervent love, than ever yet thou had
for him. Here thou will find many great incentives, many mighty arguments; to
such a love of Christ; poor soul! consider what thou have been, what the
morning of thy life was. What treasures of guilt, thou laidst up in those
days, and then think, can such a one as I receive mercy? and that mercy not
break my heart! can I read my pardon, and mine eyes not drop! What? mercy for
such a wretch as I! a pardon for such a Rebel! O what an ingenuous thaw should
this cause upon thy heart! if it do not, what a strange heart is thine!

Did the love of Christ break through so many impediments to come to thee. Did
it make its way through the Law, through the wrath of God, through the grave,
through thine own unbelief, and great unworthiness to come to thee? O what a
love was the love of Christ to thy soul! And is not thy love strong enough to
break through the vanities, and trifles of this world which entangle it, to go
to Christ, how poor, how low, and weak is thy love to Christ then?

(6.) Lastly, Art thou one that have through mercy at last attained assurance,
or good hope through grace, of thy interest in Christ? Rejoice then in thy
present mercy, and long ardently to be with thine own Christ in his glory.
There be many things dispersed through this Treatise of Christ to animate such
joy, and excite such longings. It was truly observed by a worthy Author, (whose
words I have mentioned more freely than his name in this discourse) that it is
in a manner as natural for us to leap, Mr. S. R.
when we see the New Jerusalem, as it is to laugh when we are tickled. Joy is
not under the souls command, when Christ kisseth it. And for your desires to be
with Christ, what considerations can you find in this world strong enough to
reine them in! O when you shall consider what he has done, suffered, and
purchased for you, where he is now, and how much he longs for your coming, your
very hearts should groan out those words, Phil. 1.23. I desire to be dissolved,
and to be with Christ. The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and
into the patient waiting for of Christ.

Having delivered my message to the Reader in general, I

You are a people that were born under, and bred up with the Gospel. It has
been your singular privilege above many Towns and Parishes in England, to
enjoy more than 60 years together an able and fruitful Gospel Ministry among
you. The dews of Heaven lay upon you, as it did upon Gideons Fleece, when the
ground was dry in other places about you. You have been richly watered with
Gospel showers. You with Capernaum have been exalted to Heaven in the means of
Grace. And it must be owned to your praise, that you testified more respect to
the Gospel, than many other places have done, and treated Christ's Ambassadors
with more civility, whilst they prophesied in Sackcloth; than some other places
did. These things are praise worthy in you. But all this and much more than
this amounts not to that which Jesus Christ expects from you, and which in his
name I would now persuade you to, and oh that I! (the least and unworthiest of
all the Messengers of Christ to you) might indeed prevail with all that are
Christless among you, (1.) to answer the long continued calls of God to you, by
a through and sound Conversion, that the long suffering of God may be your
salvation, and you may not receive all this grace of God in vain. O that the
damned might never be set a wondering to see a people of your advantages for
Heaven sinking as much below many of themselves in misery, as you now are above
them in means, and mercy.

Dear friends, my hearts desire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be
saved. Oh that I knew how to engage this whole Town to Jesus Christ, and make
fast the marriage knot betwixt him and you, albeit after that I should
presently go to the place of silence, and see man no more, with the Inhabitants
of the World. Ah sirs! methinks I see the Lord Jesus laying the merciful hand
of an holy violence upon you, methinks he calls to you as the Angel to Lot,
saying, arise lest ye be consumed; and while he lingered the men laid hold upon
his hand, the Lord being merciful unto him. And they brought him without the
City and said, escape for thy life, stay not in all the plain, escape to the
Mountain, lest thou be consumed, Genesis 19.15. How often (to allude to this) has
Jesus Christ in like manner laid hold upon you in the Preaching of the Gospel,
and will you not fly for refuge to him? Will you rather be consumed, than
endeavor an escape? A beast will not be driven into the fire, and will not you
be kept out? The merciful Lord Jesus, by his admirable patience and bounty has
convinced you, how loath he is, to leave, or loose you. To this day his arms
are stretched forth to gather you, and will you not be gathered? Alas! for my
poor neighbors. Must so many of them perish at last? what shall I do for the
daughter of my people?

Lord, by what Arguments shall they be persuaded to be happy? what will win
them effectually to thy Christ? they have many of them escaped the pollutions
of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior. They are a people
that love thine Ordinances, they take delight in approaching to God; thou have
beautified many of them with lovely, and obliging tempers and dispositions.
Thus far they are come, there they stick, and beyond this, no power but thine
can move them? O thou to whose hand this work is and must be left, put forth
thy saving power, and reveal thine arm for their salvation: thou have glorified
thy name, in many among them; Lord glorify it again.

(2.) My next request is, that you will all be persuaded, whether converted, or
unconverted; to set up all the duties of Religion in your families, and govern
your Children, and Servants as men that must give an account to God for them in
the great day. O that there were not a prayerless Family in this Town. How
little will your Tables differ from a manger, where beasts feed together, if
God be not owned, and acknowledged there, in your eating, and drinking? And how
can you expect blessings should dwell in your Tabernacles, if God be not called
upon there! Say not you want time for it, or that your necessities will not
allow it, for had you been more careful of those duties, it is like you had not
been exposed to such necessities; besides, you can find time to be idle, you
can waste a part of every day vainly. Why could not that time be redeemed for
God? Moreover, you will not deny, but the success of all your affairs at home,
and abroad, depends upon the blessing of God, and if so, think you it is not
the right way, even to temporal prosperity, to engage his presence, and
blessing with you, in whose hand your all is? Say not, your Children, and
servants are ignorant of God, and therefore you cannot comfortably join with
them in those duties. For the neglect of these duties, is the cause of their
ignorance and it is not like they will be better, till you use Gods means to
make them so.

Besides, prayer is a part of natural worship, and the vilest among men are
bound to pray, else the neglect of it were none of their sin. O, let not a duty
upon which so many, and great blessings hang, fall to the ground, upon such
silly (not to say wicked) pretenses to shift it off. Remember, death will
shortly break up all your families and disband them, and who then, think you,
will have most comfort in beholding their dead? The day of account also
hastens, and then who will have the most comfortable appearing, before the
just, and holy God? Set up I beseech you the ancient, and comfortable duties of
reading the Scriptures, singing of Psalms, and Prayer in all your dwelling
places, and do all these conscientiously, as men that have to do with God, and
try the Lord herewith, if he will not return in a way of mercy to you, and
restore even your outward prosperity to you again. How ever, to be sure, far
greater encouragements than that lie before you, to oblige you to your duties.





Who freely gave Jesus Christ out of his own bosom for us, and has not
withheld his spirit, Ordinances, and Ministers to reveal and apply him to us.
Here Is love, that wants an Epithete to match it!

Who engaged my heart upon this transcendent subject in the course of my
Ministry among you. A subject which Angels study, and admire as well as we.

Who so signally protected, and overshadowed our Assembly in those days of
trouble, wherein these truths were delivered to you. You then sat down under
his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to your taste. His
banner over you was love, your bread was then sure, and your waters failed not.
Yea, such was his peculiar indulgence, and special tenderness to you, that he
suffered no man to do you harm. And it can hardly be imagined any could attempt
it, that had but known, this, and no worse than this, to be your only design,
and business.

Who made these Meditations of Christ, a strong support, and sweet relief to
mine, now with Christ; and no less to me under the greatest exercises, and
trials that ever befell me in this world. Preserving me yet, (though a broken
vessel) for some farther use, and service to your souls.

Who in the years that are past left not himself without witness among us,
blessing my labors, to the conversion, and edification of many; some of which
yet remain with us, but some are fallen asleep.

Who has made many of you that yet remain, a willing and obedient people, who
have in some measure supported the reputation of Religion, by your stabillity,
and integrity in days of abounding iniquity, my joy, and my Crown; so stand ye
fast in the Lord.

Who after all the days of fears, and troubles, through which we have past,
has at last given us, and his Churches rest, that we being delivered out of
the hands of our enemies, might serve him without fear in righteousness and
holiness (which doing this mercy may be extended to us) all the days of our
life.

In testimony of a thankful heart for these invaluable mercies, I humbly and
cheerfully rear up this pillar of remembrance, inscribing it with EBEN EZER and
JEHOVAH IIEREH.

As I could not but observe these things to you, so I have

Look to it (my dear friends) that none of you be found

Get these great truths well digested both in your heads are both in vain.
These things that so often warmed your hearts from the Pulpit, return now to
make a second Impression upon them from the Press. Hereby you will recover and
fix those truths, which it is like are in great part already vanished from you.
This is the fruit I promise my self from you, and what ever entertainment it
meet with from others, Dabi^ posterior aetas tractabiliores forte animas,

in this Christ despising age; yet two things relieve me; one is, that future
times may produce more humble, and hungry Christians, than this glutted age
enjoyes; to whom it will be welcome. The other is, that duty is discharged, and
endeavors used, to bring men to Christ, and build them up in him; wherein he
does, and will rejoice; who is a well wisher, to the souls of men.

The FIRST Sermon. 1.
SERMON.
I COR. II.II. Opens the excellency of the Subject.
For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ; and him
Crucified.


THE former verse contains an Apology for the plain and familiar manner of the
Apostles preaching, which was not (as he there tells them) with excellency of
speech, or of wisdom, Non (...), sed (...).
(i. e.) he studied not to gratify their curiosity with Rhetorical strains, or
Philosophical niceties. In this he gives the reason, for I determined not to
know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, etc.

I determined not to know. (...) significat aestimare, aut eximium dur^^e, in
hoc autem non temnit, n^c da^^at omnem aliam scientiam, nisi ut opponitu
scientiae Christi, etc. Wall.
] The meaning is not that he simply despised, or contemned all other studies
and knowledge: but so far only as they stand in competion with, or opposition
to the study and knowledge of Jesus Christ. And it is as if he should say, it
is my stated settled Judgment, not a hasty, inconsiderate censure; but the
product, and Issue of my most serious and exquisite enquiries: after I have
well weighed the case, turned it round, viewed it exactly on every side,
balanced all advantages, and disadvantages; pondered all things that are fit
to come into consideration about it: this is the result and final
determination; that all other knowledge, how profitable, how pleasant soever;
is not worthy to be named in the same day, with the knowledge of Jesus Christ:
This therefore I resolve to make the scope and end of my Ministry, and the end
regulate^ the means. Such pedantick toys, and ayrie notions as injudicious ears
affect, would rather obstruct, than promote my grand design among you:
therefore wholly waving that way, I applied my self to a plain, popular,
unaffected Dialect: fitted rather to pierce the heart, and convince the
conscience, than to tickle the fancy: this is the scope of the words. In which
three things fall under consideration.

Jesus Christ. I determined to know nothing* (i. e.) to study nothing my self,
to teach nothing to you; but Jesus Christ. Christ shall be the Center, to which
all the lines of my Ministry shall be drawn. I have spoken and written of many
other subjects in my Sermons and Epistles, but it is all reductively the
Preaching and discovery of Jesus Christ: of all Subjects in the world, this is
the sweetest: if there be any thing on this side Heaven worthy our time and
studies, this is it. Thus he magnifies his Doctrine, from the excellency of its
subject matter, accounting all other Doctrines, but arrid things, compared with
this. that special respect or consideration of Christ, which he singled out
from all the rest, as the excellent Truths of Christ, to spend the main
strength of his ministry upon: And that is Christ as Crucified: and the rather,
because hereby he would obviate the vulgar prejudice, Vehementem habet (...)
quod adjecit, and hunc crucifixum. Pet. Martyr in loc.
raised against him upon the account of his cross: for Christ Crucified was to
the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness, chap. 1.23. this
also best suited his end, to draw them on to Christ: as Christ above all other
subjects, so Christ Crucified above all things in Christ: there is therefore a
great Emphasis in this word, And him Crucified. Thirdly, The manner in which he
discoursed this transcendent Christum crucifixum stylo crucifixo predicabat.
he Preached him in a Crucified style. This is the sum of the words, to let
them know that his spirit was so intent upon this subject, as if he neither
knew, or cared to speak of any other: all his Sermons were so full of Christ,
that his hearers might have thought he was acquainted with no other Doctrine.
Hence observe,
DOCT. Doct.
That there is no Doctrine more excellent in it self, or more necessary to be
Preached, and studied; than the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, and him Crucified.
All other knowledge how much soever it be magnified in the World, is and ought
to be esteemed but dross, in comparison of the excellency of the knowledge of
Jesus Christ, Phil. 3.8. in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge, Col. 2.3.

Eudoxus was so affected with the glory of the Sun, that he thought he was born
only to behold it: much more should a Christian Judge himself born only to
behold, and delight in the glory of the Lord Jesus.

The truth of this Proposition will be made out, by a double consideration of
the Doctrine of Christ.

First, Let it be considered absolutely, and then these lovely properties with
which it is naturally clothed; will render it superior to all other Sciences
and Studies.

First, The knowledge of Jesus Christ is the very marrow and Qui scientiam
secularem preponit studio aut cognitioni hui^ sacrae, is thesauro quisquilius
prefect. Daven. in Coll 2. v. 3.
the scope and center of all Divine revelations: both Testaments meet in
Christ. The Ceremonial Law is full of Christ; and all the Gospel full of
Christ: the blessed lines of both Testaments meet in him* and how they both
harmonize, and sweetly concente^ in Jesus Christ; it is the chief scope of that
excellent Epistle to the Hebrews, to discover: for we may call that Epistle,
The sweet Harmony of both Testaments: this argues the unspeakable excellency of
this Doctrine, the knowledge whereof must needs therefore be a Key to unlock
the greatest part of the Sacred Scriptures: for it is in the understanding of
Scripture, much as it is in the knowledge men have in Logic and Philosophy: if
a Scholar once come to understand the bottom principle, upon which as upon its
hinge the controversy turns; the through knowledge of that principle shall
carry him through the whole controversy, and furnish him with a solution to
every argument; even so the right knowledge of Jesus Christ, like a clew leads
you through the whole Laberynth of the Scriptures.

fundamental knowledge, and foundations are most useful, though least seen: the
knowledge of Christ is fundamental to all Graces, Duties, Comforts, and
Happiness.

First, It Is fundamental to all graces: they all begin in knowledge, Col. 3.10.
the new man is renewed in knowledge; as the old, so the new Creation begins in
light; the opening of the eyes, is the first work of the spirit: and as the
beginnings of grace, so all the after improvements thereof depend upon this
increasing knowledge, 2 Pet. 3.18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Savior: see how these two, grace and knowledge keep equal pace in
the soul of a Christian, in what degree the one increases, the other increases
answerably.

Secondly, the knowledge of Christ is fundamental to all duties: the duties, as
well as graces of Christians are all founded in the knowledge of Christ: must a
Christian believe; That he can never do without the knowledge of Christ; Faith
is so much dependent upon his knowledge, that it is denominated by it, Isa.
53.11. by his knowledge shall my righteous servant Justify many: and hence
Ioh. 6.40. Seeing, and believing are made the same thing: would a man exercise
hope in God; That he can never do without the knowledge of Christ, for he is
the author of that hope, 1 Pet. 1.3. he is also its object, Heb. 6.19. its
groundwork and support, Col. 1.27. and as you cannot believe or hope, so
neither can you pray acceptably, without a competent degree of this knowledge:
the very Heathen could say, non loquendum de deo sine lumine, (i. e.) men must
not speak of God without light: the true way of conversing with, and enjoying
God in Prayer; is by acting faith on him through a Mediator; so much of faith,
and Christ as is in a Duty, so much comfort, and true excellency there is in
it, and no more. Oh then how indispensible is the knowledge of Christ; to all
that do adress themselves to God in any Duty!

Thirdly, It Is fundamental to all comforts: all the Comforts of believers, are
streams from this Fountain. Jesus Christ is the very object-matter of a
believers Joy, Phil. 3.3. our rejoicing is in Christ Jesus: take away the
knowledge of Christ, and a Christian is the most sad, and melancholy creature
in the world: again, let Christ but manifest himself, and dart the beams of his
light into their souls, it will make them kiss the stakes, sing in flames, and
shout in the pangs of death, as men that divide the spoil.

Lastly, this knowledge is fundamental to the eternal happiness of souls: as we
can perform no duty, enjoy no comfort, so neither can we be saved without it,
Joh. 17.3. this is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou have sent: and if it be eternal life to know Christ, then it
is eternal Damnation, to be ignorant of Christ: as Christ is the door that
opens Heaven, so knowledge is the key, that opens Christ. The excellent gifts,
and renowned parts of the Moral Heathens, though they purchased to them great
esteem, and honor among men; yet left them in a state of perdition; because of
this grand defect: they were ignorant of Christ, 1 Cor. 1.21. thus you see how
fundamental the knowledge of Christ is, and essentially necessary to all the
graces, duties, comforts, and happiness of souls.

Thirdly, The knowledge of Christ is profound and large: all Ephesians. 3.14. yea,
(...) multi formis sapientia dei.

Caryll in J^b 11.6.


it passes knowledge: there is a manifold wisdom of God in Christ, Ephesians. 3.10.
It is of many sorts and forms, of many folds and plights: it is indeed simple,
pure and unmixed with any thing but it self, yet it is manifold in degrees,
kinds and Administrations: though something of Christ be unfolded in one age,
and something in an other, yet eternity if self cannot fully unfold him. I see
something (said Luther) which blessed Austin saw not, and those that come after
me, will see that which I see not: it is in the studying of Christ, as in the
planting of a new discovered Country; at first men sit down by the Sea side,
upon the skirts and borders of the Land; and there they dwell, but by degrees
they search farther, and farther into the heart of the Country: ah, the best of
us are yet, but upon the borders of this vast Continent.

Ephesians. 3.8, 9. Gods heart is opened to men in Christ, Ioh. 1.18. this makes the
Gospel such a glorious dispensation, because Christ is so gloriously revealed
therein, 2 Cor. 3.9. and the studying of Christ in the Gospel, stamps such a
Heavenly glory upon the contemplating soul, v. 18.

Omnis cognitio tuae veri^atis long^ ju^u^dissima est suavissi^a and
amaenissima, etiam quae prostat pro ^oribus, and obviam cuique sese s^onte data
quantu^ deliciarum est illius, quam in intimis penetralibus reconditam apud te
habes, multisque seris, and repagulis clausam? Brightman in Cant.
and springs of comfort, and the deeper you dig, the more do those springs flow
upon you: how are hearts ravished with the discoveries of Christ in the Gospel?
what ecstasies, meltings, transports, do gracious souls meet there? doubtless,
Philips ecstasy, Ioh. 1.45. (...): we have found Jesus, was far beyond that of
Archimedes: a believer could fit from Morning to Night, to hear Discourses of
Christ; his mouth is most sweet, Cant. 5.16.

Secondly, Let us compare this knowledge, with all other knowledge, and thereby
the excellency of it will farther appear.

no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any the father, save
the Son; and he to whom so ever the Son will reveal him: the wisest Heathens
could never make a discovery of Christ by their deepest searches into nature;
the most Eagle-eyed Philosophers were but Children in knowledge, compared with
the most illiterate Christians.

Secondly, Other knowledge is unattainable by many: all the I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth; because thou have hid these things from the
wise and prudent: and have revealed them unto babes, 1. Cor. 1.26, 27. you see
your calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh; not many
mighty, not many noble are called: but God has chosen the foolish things of
the World, to confound the wise, etc.

Thirdly, Other knowledge, though you should attain the integrity of parts, the
principal thing, viz. Christ being wanting: and in the purity of its nature,
for the knowing Heathens grew vain in their imaginations, 1 Romans 21. and in the
efficacy and influence of it, on the heart and life, they held the truth in
unrighteousness: their lusts were stronger than their light, 1 Romans 18. but
this knowledge has potent influences, changing souls into its own image, 2
Cor. 3.18. and so proves a saving knowledge unto men, 1 Timothy 2.4. and thus I
have in a few particulars pointed out the transcendency of the knowledge of
Christ.

The use of all this I shall give you in a few Inferences, on which I shall not
enlarge, the whole being only praeliminary to the Doctrine of Christ, only for
the present I shall hence infer,

The ^^sufficiency of the Doctrine of Christ, Infer. 1. Ple^e sapit, qui
evangeliu^ didicit; prorsus insa^it, qui co^nitionem salutarem alibi quaerit;
hi^ enim om^^^ thesauri. Dav. in Coll.
to make men wise unto salvation. Paul de^ired to know nothing else, and indeed
nothing else is of absolute necessity to be known: a little of this knowledge
(if saving and eff^ctual upon thy heart) will do thy soul more service than all
the vain speculations, and profound parts that others so much glory in; poor
Christian, be not dejected, because thou see thy self out-stript, and
excelled by so many, in other parts of knowledge: if thou know Jesus Christ,
thou know enough, to comfort and save thy soul; many learned Philosophers
are now in Hell, and many illiterate Christians in Heaven.

Infer. 2.
If there be such excellency in the knowledge of Christ, let it humble, all,
both Saints, and sinners that we have no more of this clear, and effectual
knowledge in us, notwithstanding the excellent advantages we have had for it.
Sinners, concerning you I may sigh, and say with the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15.34.
some have not the knowledge of Christ, I speak this to your shame; this, oh
this, is the condemnation; and even for you that are enlightened in this
knowledge, how little do you know of Jesus Christ, in comparison of what you
might have known of him? what a shame is it, that you should need to be taught
the very first truths, when for the time you might have been teachers of
others? Heb. 5.12, 13, 14. that your Ministers cannot speak unto you as
spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ, 1 Cor. 3.1.2. Oh,
how much time is spent in other studies! in vain discourses, frivolous
Pamphlets, worldly employments, how little in the search and study of Jesus
Christ?

Infer. 3.
How sad is their condition, that have a knowledge of Christ, and yet as to
themselves, Vide Za^ch in Ephesians 4. p. 161. de d^pli i cognitione Christi.
it had been better, they had never had it! many there be that content
themselves with an unpractical, ineffectual, and merely notional knowledge of
him; of whom the Apostle says, it had been better for them not to have known,
2 Pet. 2.21. it serves only to aggravate sin and misery: for though it be not
enough to save them, yet it puts some weak restraints upon sin, which their
impetuous lusts breaking down, exposes them thereby to a greater damnation.

Infer. 4.
Fourthly, This may inform us by what rule to Judge both Ministers, and
Doctrines; certainly that is the highest commendation of a Minister to be an
able Minister of the New Testament; not of the letter but of the spirit, 2.
Cor. 3.6. he is the best Artist, that can most lively and powerfully display
Jesus Christ before the people; evidently setting him forth as Crucified among
them; and that is the best Sermon that is most full of Christ, not of art, and
language. I know that an holy Dialect well becomes the lips of Christ's
Ministers, they should not be rude, and careless, in language or method: but
surely the excellency of a Sermon lies not in that, but in the plainest
discoveries, and livelyest applications of Jesus Christ.

Let all that mind the honor of Religion, Infer. 5.
or the peace and comfort of their own souls; wholly sequester and apply
themselves, to the study of Jesus Christ, I am sure (says an holy one) the
Saints at their best, are but strangers to the weight and worth* of the
incomparable sweetness of Christ: he is so new, so fresh in excellency every
day to those that search more and more into him, as if Heaven could furnish as
many new Christ's (if I may so speak) as there are days betwixt him and us; and
yet he is one and the same still: oh, we love an unknown lover, when we love
Christ.
and him Crucified; wherefore spend we our selves upon other studies? when all
excellency, sweetness, and desirableness is concentered in this one? Jesus
Christ is fairer than the children of men, the chiefest among ten thousands, as
the Apple Tree among the trees of the wood: quae faciunt divisa beatum, in hoc
mixta fluunt; these things which singly ravish and delight the souls of men,
are all found conjunctly in Christ. O, what a blessed Christ is this! whom to
know is eternal life: from the knowledge of Jesus Christ do bud forth all the
fruits of comfort, and that for all seasons and conditions. Hence Revel. 22.2.
he is called the tree of life which bears twelve manner of fruits, and yields
its fruit every month and the very leaves of this tree are for healing; in
Christ souls have (1.) All necessarys for food and physic, (2.) All varieties
of fruits, twelve manner of fruits, a distinct sweetness in this, in that; and
in the other attribute, promise, ordinance. (3.) In him are these fruits at all
times, he bears fruit every month; there is precious fruit in Jesus Christ,
even in the black month; Winter fruits, as well as Summer fruits. O, then study
Christ, study to know him more extensively, there be many excellent things in
Christ, that the most Eagle-eyed believer has not yet seen: ah it is pity,
that any thing of Christ should lie hid from his people! study to know Christ
more intensively, to get the experimental taste, and lively power of his
knowledge, upon your hearts, and affections: this is the knowledge that carries
all the sweetness and comfort in it. Christian, I dare appeal to thy
experience; whether the experimental taste of Jesus Christ in Ordinances and
duties, have not a higher and sweeter relish than any created enjoyment thou
ever tasted in this world? O then separate, devote, and wholly give thy self;
thy time, thy strength to this most sweet trascendent study.

Lastly, Infer. 6.
Let me close the whole with a double caution, one to our selves, who by our
callings, and professions are the Ministers of Christ: another to those that
sit under the Doctrine of Christ daily.

First, If this Doctrine be the most excellent, necessary, fundamental, then
take heed lest while we study to be exact in other things, we be found ignorant
in this: Cavete ne germinante indies arbore s^ientiae, sola sterileseat arbor
vitae, cav^te ^e do^is sp^ritus contenti, donum spiritum nihili aestimetis. S.
Ford amb. Sacr. p. 35.

Peritum esse, and sine doctrina pietatis periturum. Aug.

Melius est ut nos reprehenda^t gramatici, quam ut non intellegant populi --
^oi quanta eloquentia, sed quanta evidentia non rhetorice sed Apostoli^e, non
diserta, sed fortia. Quod a studiis scholasticae theologiae averteretur fere
na^sc^bundus, quoniam sicco carebant liquidae pietatis. Fuligat. in vita Bell.


ye know it is ignominious by the common suffrage of the civilized world, for
any man to be unacquainted with his own calling, or not to intend the proper
business of it. It Is our calling (as the Bridegrooms friends) to woo and win
souls to Christ: to set him forth to the people as Crucified among them, Gal.
3.1. to present him in all his attractive excellencies that all hearts may be
ravished with his beauty, and charmed into his arms by love: we must also be
able to defend the truths of Christ, against undermining Heretics; to instill
his knowledge into the ignorant, to answer the cases and scruples of poor
doubting Christians. How many intricate knots have we to untye? what pains,
what skill is requisite for such as are employed about our work? and shall we
spend our precious time in frivolous controversies, Philosophical niceties, dry
and barren Scholastic notions? shall we study every thing but Christ? revolve
all Volumes but the Sacred ones! what is observed even of Bellarmine, that he
turned with loathing from School Divinity, because it wanted the sweet juice of
piety; may be convictive to many among us, who are often too much in love with
worse employment, that what he is said to loath. Oh let the knowledge of Christ
dwell richly in us.

sanctified, out whole man must be damned: we and our people must be judged by
the same Gospel, and stand at the same bar, Gildas Salvianus, p. 27.
and be sentenced on the same terms, and dealt with as severely as any other
men: we cannot think to be saved by our Clergy, or to come off with a Legit ut
elericus, when there is wanting the Credidit, and vixit ut Christianus; as an
eminent Divine speaks. O let the Keepers of the Vineyards look to, and keep
their own Vineyard: we have an Heaven to win, or lose as well as others.

Thirdly, Let us take heed that we withold not our knowledge We may apply to
Ministers, what Tacitus speaks of Magistrates; Ita nati estis, ut bona, malaque
vestra ad Rempub. pertineant. Tacit. Annal. lib. 4.
I beseech you the Relations wherein you stand, and the obligations resulting
thence: Remember the great Shepherd gave himself for, and gave you to the
flock; your time, your gifts are not yours, but Gods. Remember the pinching
wants of souls who are perishing, for want of Christ; and if their tongues do
not, yet their necessities do bespeak us, as they did Joseph, Genesis 47.15.
wherefore should we dye in thy presence, give us food that we may live, and not
dye: even the Sea Monsters draw forth their breasts to their young ones, and
shall we be cruel! cruel to souls! did not Christ think it too much to sweat
blood, yea to dye for them; and shall we think it much to watch, study, preach,
pray, and do what we can for their salvation? O let the same mind be in you,
which was also in Christ.

Secondly, To the people that sit under the Doctrine of Christ

First, Take heed ye do not reject and despise this light: this may be done two
ways, (first) When you despise the means of knowledge, by slight and low
esteems of it. Surely if you thus reject knowledge, God will reject you for it,
Hosea 4.6. it is a despising of the richest gift that ever Christ gave to the
Church: and however it be a contempt and slight that begins low, and seems only
to vent it self upon the weak parts, inartificial discourses, and untaking
tones and gestures of the speakers; yet (believe it) it is a daring sin, that
flies higher than you are aware, Luke 10.16. he that despises you, despises
me; and he that despises me, despises him that sent me.

Secondly, You despise the knowledge of Christ, when you despise the
directions, and loving constraints of that knowledge; when you refuse to be
guided by your knowledge, your light and your lusts contest and struggle within
you: Oh it is sad when your lusts master your light; you sin not as the Heathens
sin, who know not God; but when you sin, you must slight and put by the notices
of your own Consciences; and offer violence to your own convictions; And what
sad work will this make in your souls? how soon will it lay your consciences
waste?

Secondly, Take heed that you rest not satisfied with that knowledge of Christ
you have attained, but grow on toward perfection: it is the pride and ignorance
of many professors when they have got a few raw and indigested notions, to
swell with self-conceits of their excellent-attainments, and it is the sin even
of the best of Saints, when they see (veritas in profundo) how deep the
knowledge of Christ lies, and what pains they must take to dig for it; to throw
by the Shovel of Duty, and cry dig we cannot. To your work Christians, to your
work; let not your candle go out, sequester your selves to this study, look
what intercourses and correspondencies are betwixt the two worlds, what
communion soever God and souls maintain; it is in this way: count all therefore
but dross in comparison of that excellency which is in the knowledge of Jesus
Christ.

The SECOND Sermon. 2.
SERMON. Sets forth Christ in his Essential and Primoeval glory.

PROVE. VIII.XXX. Then was I by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily
his delight, rejoicing always before him.


THese words are a part of that excellent commendation of wisdom, by which in
this Book Solomon intends two things, first grace, or holiness, Prove. 4.7.
wisdom is the principal thing; secondly, Jesus Christ, the fountain of that
grace, and look as the former is renowned for its excellency, Job 28.14, 15. so
the latter in this context, wherein the spirit of God describes the most
blessed state of Jesus Christ, the wisdom of the Father, from those eternal
delights, he had with his Father; before his assumption of our nature: then was
I by him, etc. that long aevum was wholly swallowed up and spent in unspeakable
delights and pleasures: which delights were twofold, (1.) The Father and Son
delighted one in another; (from which delights the Spirit is not here excluded)
without communicating that their joy to any other, for no creature did then
exist save in the mind of God, ver. 30. (2.) They delighted in the salvation of
men, in the prospect of that work, though not yet extant, ver. 31. my present
business lies in the former, viz. the mutual delights of the Father and Son,
one with and in another: the account whereof we have in the Text: wherein
consider,

then was I by him, or with him, so with him as never was any; in his very
bosom, Ioh. 1.18. the only begotten Son, was in the bosom of the Father; an
expression of the greatest dearness, and intimacy in the World: as if he should
say, wrapped up in the very soul of his Father; embosomed in God.

one brought up with him] the Hebrew word (...) is sometimes rendered a cunning
workman, (...) fidelem artificem significat, placuit hoc nomen sibi assumere,
ut declararet tandem conversionem cordis non a scipsis perficisci, sed ab hoc
fideli artifice. Brightman in Cant. 1^6.

Ridere, (...) ludere, laetari, (...) similem se facit nutricio, stanti apud
patrem. Luvat. in loc.


or curious Artist, as in Cant. 7.1. which is the same word: and indeed Christ
showed himself such an Artist in the Creation of the World, for all things were
made by him, and without him there was nothing made, that was made, Joh. 1.3.
but Montanus, and others render it nutricius and so Christ is here compared to
a delightful child, sporting before its Father: the Hebrew root (...) which our
translation renders rejoicing before him, signifies to laugh, play, or rejoice;
so that look as Parents delight to see their Children sporting before them; so
did the Father delight in beholding this Darling of his bosom.

(...) Di^, die ludens.
I was day by day his delights, rejoicing always before him: these delights of
the Father and the Son, one in another; knew not a moments interruption, or
diminution: thus did these great and glorious persons mutually let forth their
fullest pleasure and delight, each into the heart of other: they lay as it were
imbosomed one in another, entertaining themselves, with delights, and pleasures
ineffable, and unconceivable: hence we observe,

DOCT. Doct.
That the condition and State of Jesus Christ before his incarnation, was a
state of highest, and most unspeakable delight and pleasure; in the enjoyment
of his Father.
John tells us, he was in the bosom of his Father: to lie in the bosom is the
posture of dearest love, Joh. 1.18. Metaphorice intima communio filii dei cum
patre innuitur, quae consistit in aetern^ generatione, tum i^ arctissima
unitate naturae, tum in ardentissima dilectione denique in se cretissimorum
communicatione. Glass. Hieron. quem approbat, Pagn. and mont. complacuit animae
meae. Sept. quem s^scepit anima mea.
Joh. 13.23. now there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of his Disciples, whom
Jesus loved: but Christ did not lean upon the Fathers bosom, as that Disciple
did on his, but lay in it: and therefore in Isa. 42.1. the Father calls him
mine elect, in whom my soul delights, which is variously rendered, the
Septuagint quem suscepit, whom my soul takes, or wraps up: others complacuit:
one that highly pleases, and delights my very soul: and 2 Cor. 8.9. he is said
in this estate, wherein I am now describing him, to be rich: and Phil. 2.7. to
be equal with God, and to be in the form of God, (i. e.) to have all the glory,
and ensigns of the Majesty of God, and the riches which he speaks of, was no
less, then all that God the Father has, Joh. 16.15. all that the Father has
is mine: and what he now has in this his exalted state, is the same he had
before his humiliation, Ioh. 17.5. now to glimpse out (as we are able) the
unspeakable felicity of that state of Christ, whilst he lay in that blessed
bosom; I shall consider it three ways, negatively, positively, and
comparatively.

Let us consider that state negatively, by removing from it all he made himself
of no reputation, Phil. 2.7. it emptied him of his glory: for God to be made
man, is such an abasement as none can express: but then not only to appear in
true flesh; but also in the likeness of sinful flesh, as Romans 8.3. O what is
this!

Secondly, Christ was not under the Law in this Estate. I confess 'twas no
disparagement to Adam in the state of innocence, to Angels in their state of
glory, to be under Law to God; but it was an unconceivable abasement, to the
absolute independent being, to come under Law: yea not only under the
obedience, but also under the malediction and curse of the Law, Gal. 4.4. but
when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman made
under the Law.

Thirdly, In this State he was not liable to any of those sorrowful
consequents, and attendants of that frail and feeble state of humanity, which
he afterward assumed, with the nature: as (1.) He was unacquainted with
griefs: there was no sorrowing, nor sighing in that bosom where he lay; though
afterward he became a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, Isa. 53.3. a
man of sorrows, as if he had been constituted and made up of pure and unmixed
sorrows: every day conversing with griefs, as with his intimate companions, and
acquaintance. (2.) He was never pinched with poverty, and wants, while he
continued in that bosom, as he was afterward when he said, Matthew. 8.20.
the Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man
has not where to lay his head. Ah blessed Jesus! thou need not to have
wanted a place to have lain thine head, He that was in the bosom of the Father,
an expression showing the intimate, close, and secret delight, and love he had
from the Father: how unspeakable is it that he should deprive himself of the
sense of it? to put himself as it were out of Heaven, into Hell; this is deeper
love than ever we can imagine, or conceive: no wonder the Apostle calls it
(...), and (...), the unsearchable riches of grace: we are never able to go to
the bottom of it, but still there is more grace, and love behind. Mr. Anth.
Bugs, Lect. in Ioh. 17. p 503.
had thou not left that bosom for my sake. (3.) He never under-went reproach
and shame in that bosom, there was nothing but glory and honor, reflected upon
him by his Father, though afterward he was despised and rejected of men, Isa.
53.3. his Father never looked upon him without smiles and love, delight and
joy, though afterward he became a reproach of men, and despised of the people,
Psalm. 22.6. (4.) His holy heart was never offended with an impure suggestion,
or temptation of the Devil; all the while he lay in that bosom of peace and
love, he never knew what it was to be assaulted with temptations, to be
besieged, and battered upon by unclean spirits, as he did afterward, Matthew.
4.1. then was Jesus led up of the Spirit, into the Wilderness to be tempted of
the Devil. It was for our sakes that he submitted to those exercises of Spirit,
to be in all points tempted like as we are, that he might be unto us a merciful
and faithful High Priest, Heb. 4.15. (5.) He was never sensible of pains and
tortures, in soul or body, there were no such things in that blessed bosom
where he lay: though afterward he groaned and sweat under them, Isa. 53.5. the
Lord embraced him from eternity, but never wounded him till he stood in our
place, and room. (6.) There were no hidings or withdrawments of his father from
him, there was not a cloud from eternity upon the face of God, till Jesus
Christ had left that bosom: it was a new thing to Christ to see frowns in the
face of his Father: a new thing for him to cry, my God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? Matthew. 27.46. (7.) There were never any impressions of his Fathers
wrath upon him, as there were afterward: God never delivered such a bitter cup
of wrath into his hands before, as that was, Matthew. 26.39. Lastly, There was no
death, to which he was subject in that bosom, all these things were new things
to Christ, he was above them all, till for our sakes he voluntarily subjected
himself unto them: thus you see what that state was not.

Let us consider it positively, what it was, and guess by some Ioh. 1.1. God
you know is the Fountain, Ocean, and Center of all delights and joys, Psalm.
16.11. in thy presence is fullness of joy. To be wrapped up in the soul; and bosom
of all delights as Christ was, must needs be a state transcending apprehension:
to have the Fountain of love, and delight, letting out it self so immediately
and fully, and everlastingly upon this only begotten darling of his soul, so as
it never did communicate it self to any; judge what a state of transcendent
felicity this must be? great persons have great delights. (2.) Or if we
consider the intimacy, dearness, yea oneness of those great persons one with
another: the nearer the union the sweeter the communion: now Jesus Christ was
not only near, and dear to God, but one with him, I and my Father are one, Joh.
10.30. one in nature, will, love, and delight; there is indeed a Moral union of
souls, among men by love, but this was a natural oneness; no Child is so one
with his Father, no Husband so one with the Wife of his bosom, no Friend so one
with his Friend, no Soul so one with its body, as Jesus Christ and his Father
were one. O, what matchless delights must necessarily flow, from such a blessed
Union! (3.) Consider again the purity of that delight, with which the blessed
Father and Son embraced each other; the best Creature-delights one in another,
are mixed, debased, and allayed: if there be something ravishing, and engaging,
there is also something cloying and distasting: the purer any delight is, the
more excellent.

Now there are no Crystal streams flowing so purely from the Fountain, no
beams of light so unmixed from the Sun; as the loves and delights, of these
holy and glorious persons were: the holy, holy, holy Father, embraced the
thrice holy Son; with a most holy delight, and love.

(4.) Consider, the constancy of this delight: it was from everlasting as in
ver. 23. and from Eternity, it never suffered one moments interruption: the
ever-flowing Fountain of Gods delight and love, never stopped its course, never
ebbed, but as he speaks in the Text, I was daily his delight, rejoicing always
before him: once more, consider the fullness of that delight, the perfection of
that pleasure. I was delights: so the word is in its original: not only plural
delights, all delights, but also in the abstract delight it self; as afterward
from the abundance of his sorrows, he was styled, a man of sorrows, so here,
from the fullness of his delights: as who should say, even constituted, and made
up of pleasure, and delight.

Jacobs delight in Benjamin, whose life is said to be bound up in the lads
life: a dear and high expression, Genesis 44.30. such was that of Jonathan in
David, whose soul was knit with his soul, and he loved him, as his own soul, 1 Samuel 13.1. and such is the delight of one friend in another, there is a friend
that is as a man's own soul, Deuteronomy. 13.6. yet all this is but Creature-delight,
and can in no particular match the delights betwixt the Father, and the Son:
for this is but a finite delight, according to the measure, and abilities of
Creatures; but that is infinite, suitable to the infinite perfection of the
Divine being: this is always mixed, that perfectly pure.

(2.) Or if you compare it, with the delight that God takes in the Creatures;
it is confessed that God takes great delight in some creatures: the Lord takes
pleasure in his Saints, he rejoices over them with singing; and rests in his
love, Zeph. 3.17. Isa. 62.5. but yet there is a great difference betwixt his
delight in creatures, and his delights in Christ; for all his delight in the
Saints is secondary, and for Christ's sake: but his delights in Christ are
primary, and for his own sake: we are accepted in the beloved Ephesians. 1.6. he is

Suppose (says one) there were an Hell betwixt me and Christ, and Christ
should say, put in thy foot and come through, or thou shall have none of me,
would I not do it?


and accepted for himself. (3.) To conclude, compare it once more, with the
delights that the best of creatures take in God, and Christ; and it must be
confessed that is a choice delight, and a transcendent love, with which they
love and delight in him, Psalm. 73.25. whom have I in Heaven but thee? and on
earth there is none, that I desire besides thee: what pangs of love? what
raptures of delight, did the Spouse express to Christ? oh thou whom my soul
loves, but surely our delight in God is no perfect rule to measure, his
delight in Christ by: for our love to God (at the best) is still imperfect,
that is the burden and constant complaint of Saints: but this is perfect, ours
is inconstant, up and down, ebbing and flowing, but this is constant: so then,
to conclude, the condition and state of Jesus Christ, before his Incarnation
was a state of highest, and matchless delight, in the enjoyment of his Father.

What an astonishing act of love was this then, Infer. 1.
for the Father to give, the delight, the darling of his soul, out of his very
bosom, for poor sinners? all tongues must needs pause, and faulter, that
attempt the expression of this grace: expressions being here swallowed up. God
so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, Joh. 3.16. here is a
sic, without a sicut; so loved them, how did he love them? nay, here you must
excuse the tongues of Angels; which of us would deliver a Child, the Child of
our delights; an only Child to death, for the greatest inheritance in the
World? what tender Parent can endure a parting pull, with such a Child? when
Hagar was taking her last leave (as she thought) of her Ishmael: Genesis 21.16.
the text says she went, and sat her down over against him; a good way off,
for she said, let me not see the death of the Child, and she sat over against
him, and lift up her voice, and wept: though she were none of the best Mothers,
nor he the best of Children; yet she could not give up a Child. O, 'twas hard
to part! what an outcry did David make, even for an Absalom? wishing he dyed
for him: what a hole (as I may say) has the death of some Children made in the
hearts of some Parents? which will never be closed up in this world: yet
surely, never did any Child lie so close to a Parents heart, as Christ did to
his Fathers; and yet he willingly parts with him, though his only one, the Son
of his delights, and that to death, a cursed death, for sinners, for the worst
of sinners. O miranda dei philanthropia! matchless love, a love past finding
out! let all men therefore, in the business of their redemption, give equal
glory to the Father with the Son, Ioh. 5.23. if the Father had not loved thee,
he had never parted with such a Son for thee.

Infer. 2.
From one wonder, let your souls turn to another, for they are now in the midst
of wonders: adore, and be for ever astonished at the love of Jesus Christ, It
is admirable that Christ should not only put himself out of comfort, but also
from the enjoyment of that manifested glory and honor he might have retained
to himself, for he prays here for that glory which he had with the Father
from the beginning of the World: he had it in right, but not in possession: he
voluntarily divested himself of that to accomplish our Redemption. Burges on
John 17. v. 19.
to poor sinners: that ever he should consent to leave such a bosom, and the
ineffable delights that were there for such poor worms as we are. O heights,
depths, length, and breadth of unmeasurable love! O see, Romans 5.6, 7, 8. read,
and wonder, how is the love of Christ commended in ravishing circumstances to
poor sinners! you would be loath to leave a Creatures bosom, a comfortable
dwelling, a fair estate, for the best friend in the world; your souls are loath
to leave their bodies, though they have no such great content there; but which
of you, if ever you found by experience, what it is to be in the bosom of God,
by Divine Communion, would be persuaded to leave such a bosom for all the good
that is in the world; and yet Jesus Christ, who was embraced in that bosom,
after another manner than ever you were acquainted with; freely left it, and
laid down the glory, and riches he enjoyed there, for your sakes: and as the
father loved him, even so (believers) has he loved you, Ioh. 17.22. what
manner of love is this! whoever loved as Christ loves? whoever denied himself
for Christ, as Christ denied himself for us;

Hence we are informed, Infer. 3.
that interest in Jesus Christ, is the true way to all spiritual preferment in
Heaven: do you covet to be in the heart, in the favor and delight of God? get
interest in Jesus Christ, and you shall presently be there: what old Israel
said of the Children of his beloved Joseph, thy Children are my Children, the
same God says of all the dear Children of Christ, Genesis 48.5, 9. you see among
men all things are carried by interest, persons rise in this world, as they are
befriended: preferment goes by favor: it is so in Heaven, persons are preferred
according to their interest in the beloved, Ephesians. 1.6. Christ is the great
favorite in Heaven, his image upon your souls, and his name in your prayers,
makes both accepted with God.

How worthy is Jesus Christ of all our love, Infer. 4.
and delight? you see how infinitely the Father delights in him, how he
ravishes the heart of God; and shall he not ravish our hearts? I present you a
Christ this day, able to ravish any soul that will but view, and consider him.
O that you did but see this lovely Lord, Jesus Christ! then would you go home
sick of love: surely he is a drawing Savior, Ioh. 12 32. why do we lavish away
our precious affections upon vanity? none but Christ is worthy of them: when
you spend your precious affections upon other objects, what is it? but to dig
for dross with golden M^ttocks, the Lord direct our hearts into the love of
Christ. O, that our hearts, loves, and delights might meet, and concenter with
the heart of God, in this most blessed object; O let him that left Gods bosom
for you be embosomed by you, though yours be nothing to Gods: he that left Gods
bosom for you, deserves yours.

If Christ be the beloved darling of the Father's soul, Infer. 5.
think, what a grievous, and unsufferable thing, it is to the heart of God, to
see his dear Son, despised, slighted, and rejected by sinners: verily there is
no such cut to the heart of God in the whole world; unbelievers trample upon
Gods darling, tread under foot, him that eternally lay in his bosom, Heb.
10.29. smite the apple of his eye, and how God will bear this, that parable,
Matthew, 21.37. to the 40. will inform you, surely he will miserably destroy such
wretched sinners; if you would ^tudy to do God the greatest despite, there is
none like this: what a dismal word is that, 1 Cor. 16.22. if any man love not
our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha, (i. e.) let the great
curse of God lie upon that man, till the Lord come. O sinners! you shall one
day know the price of this sin; you shall feel what it is to despise a Jesus,
that is able to compel love from the hardest heart. O, that you would slight
him no more. O, that this day your hearts might fall in love with him! I tell
you, if you would set your love to sale; none bids so fair for it as Christ.

Galleacius left all for his enjoyment. Moses left all the glory of Egypt.
Peter, and the other Apostles left all, Luke 18.28. but what have we to leave
for Christ? in comparison of what he left for us. Surely Christ is the highest
pattern of self-denial in the world. (2.) Let this confirm your faith in
prayer, if he that has such an interest in the heart of God, intercede with
the Father for you, then never doubt of audience; and acceptance with him:
surely you shall be accepted through the beloved, Ephesians. 1.6. Christ was never
denied any thing that he asked, Ioh. 11.42. the Father hears him always; though
you are not worthy, Christ is; and he ever lives to make intercession for you,
Heb. 7.25. (3.) Let this encourage thy heart, O Saint; in a dying hour, and not
only make thee patient in death; but in a holy manner impatient, till thou be
gone; for, whither is thy soul now going but to that bosom of love whence
Christ came? Joh. 17.24. Father I will, that they also whom thou have given me,
be with me where I am: and where is he? but in that bosom of glory, and love
where he lay before the world was, ver. 5. O then, let every believer encourage
his soul: comfort ye one another with these words. I am leaving the bosom of a
creature, I am going to the bosom of God.

To sinners, exhorting them to embrace the bosom-Son of God: Heb. 10.28. O,
that these discoveries, and overtures of Christ, may never come to such a fatal
issue; with any of your souls, in whose eyes his glory has been this day
opened.

Sermon. 3.
The THIRD SERMON. Opens the Covenant of Redemption betwixt the Father and the
Redeemer.

ISAI. LIII.XII. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul
unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors, and he bare the sin of
many, and made intercession for the transgressors.


IN this Chapter, the Gospel seems to be epitomized; the subject matter of it
is, the death of Christ, and the glorious Issue thereof: by reading of it, the
Eunuch of old, and many Jews since have been converted to Christ. Christ is
here considered absolutely and relatively: absolutely, and so his innocence is
industriously vindicated, ver. 9. though he suffered grievous things, yet not
for his own sins; for he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his
mouth: but relatively considered, in the capacity of a surety for us. So the
Justice of God is as fully vindicated in his sufferings, verse. 6. the Lord has
laid upon him the iniquity of us all: Nortons Orthodox Evangelist, page 41.

The call of the Lord Jesus unto office includes election on the Fathers part,
and acceptance on the Mediators part; and is set down after the manner of
mutual transaction between God and Christ, whereby he was designed thereunto as
it were by way of Covenant. If his soul shall set it self an offering for sin;
(for so according to the original do good Authors read the Text) he shall see
his seed prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
hand, ver. 10.


how he came to sustain this capacity, and relation of a surety for us, is in
these verses plainly asserted, to be by his compact, and agreement with his
Father, before the worlds were made, ver. 10, 11, 12.

In this verse we have (1.) His Work, (2.) His Reward, (3.) The Respect or
Relation of each to the other. (1.) His Work, which was indeed a hard work; to
pour out his soul unto death, aggravated by the companions with whom being
numbered with transgressors: the capacity in which, bearing all the sins of the
Elect: he bare the sins of many; and by the manner of his bearing it, viz.
meekly, and forgivingly, he made intercession for the transgressors: this was
his work. (2.) The Reward, or fruit which is promised him for this work;
therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the
spoil with the strong; wherein is a plain allusion to Conquerours in War; for
whom are reserved the richest garments; and most honorable captives, to follow
the Conqueror as an addition to his magnificence, and triumph: these were wont
to come after them in chains, Isa. 45.14. see Judge. 5.3. (3.) The Respect or
Relation betwixt that work, and this Triumph, some will have this work, to have
no other relation to that glory; then a mere antecedent, to a consequent:
others give it the respect, and relation of a meritorious cause to a reward;
it is well observed by Dr. Featly, that the Hebrew particle (...) which we
render therefore, noting order, it is not worth so much contention about it;
whether it be the order of causality, or mere antecedency, neither do I foresee
any absurdity, in calling Christ's exaltation; the reward, and fruit, of his
humiliation: however it is plain, whether one, or other; it is that the Father
here agrees, and promises to give him, if he will undertake the redemption of
the elect, by pouring out his soul unto death; of all which this is the plain
result.

DOCT. That the business of man's salvation was transacted upon Covenant-terms,
Doct.
betwixt the Father and the Son; from all Eternity.
I would not here be mistaken, as though I were now to treat of the Covenant of
Grace; made in Christ betwixt God and us; it is not the Covenant of Grace, but
of Redemption I am now to speak to; which differs from the Covenant of grace
both in regard of the foederates, in this it is God the Father, and Jesus Christ
that mutually Covenant; in that it is God and man; they differ also in the
preceptive part, in this it is required of Christ that he should shed his
blood, in that it is required of us, that we believe; they also differ in their
promises, in this God promises to Christ a name above every name, ample
Dominion from Sea to Sea; in that to us grace and glory: so that these are two
distinct Covenants.

The substance of this Covenant of Redemption is Dialogue-wise expressed to us in
Esa. 49. where (as Divines have well observed) Christ begins at the first and
second verse, Vide Goodwins Triumph of faith.
and shows his Commission, telling his Father, how he had both called and
prepared him for the work of Redemption: the Lord has called me from the womb
-- he has made my mouth like a sharp sword, and made me a polished shaft, etc.
q. d. by reason of that super-abundant measure of the spirit of wisdom and
power wherewith I am anointed and filled; my Doctrine shall as a sword, pierce
the hearts of sinners; yea, like an arrow drawn to the head, strike point blank
into souls, standing at a great distance from God and Godliness.

Having told God how ready and fit he was for his service, will know of him
what reward he shall have for his work, for he resolves his blood shall not be
sold at low and cheap rates: hereupon verse. 3. the Father offers him the elect
of Israel for his reward; biding Low at first (as they that make bargains use
to do) and only offers him that small remnant, still intending to bid higher:
but Christ will not be satisfied with these, he values his blood higher than
so; therefore in verse. 4. he is brought in complaining, I have labored in
vain, and spent my strength for naught, q. d. this is but a small reward for so
great sufferings as I must undergo, my blood is much more worth than this comes
to; and will be sufficient to redeem all the elect dispersed among the Isles of
the Gentiles; as well as the lost sheep of the house of Israel: hereupon the
Father comes up higher, and tells him he intends to reward him better than so,
and therefore verse. 6. tells him, it is a light thing that thou should be my
servant, to raise up the Tribes of Jacob, and to rest over the preserved of
Israel; I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou may be
my Salvation to the ends of the earth. Thus is the Treaty carried on betwixt
them, transacting it after the manner of men.

Now to open this great point we will here consider, (1.) The persons
transacting one with another. (2.) The business transacted. (3.) The quality
and manner of the transaction, which is foederal. (4.) The articles to which
they agree. (5.) How each person performs his engagement to the other. And
lastly, the antiquity or eternity of this Covenant transaction.

First, The persons transacting and dealing with each Creditor, the latter as a
surety: the Father stands upon satisfaction, the Son engages to give it: if it
be demanded why the Father and the Spirit might not as well have treated about
our redemption as the Father and Son? Vide Roberts medulla ^ib. p. 1577. et.
life. Test. p. 83, 84.
It is answered Christ is the natural Son of God, and therefore fittest to make
us the adopted Sons of God. Christ also is the middle person in the Trinity,
and therefore fittest to be the Mediator or middle person betwixt us and God:
the Spirit has another office assigned him, even to apply as Christ's
Vicegerent, the redemption designed by the Father, and purchased by the Son for
us.

The business transacted betwixt them, And that was the Causa externae
satisfactionis a patre decretae, and a filio susceptae, est miseria nostra, id
est peccata and quidem aeternam panam promerentiae, and exigentia, in quam
miseratio dei ferebatur, and ob quam poenas omnes nobis debitas subiit filius
dei, ut per cum pristinae faelicitati restituerentur. Synop. pu^^or Theol. p.
350.
our eternal happiness lay now before them, our dearest and everlasting
concerns were now in their hands: the elect (though not yet in being,) are here
considered as existent, yea and as fallen, miserable, forlorn creatures: how
these may again be restored to happiness ( salva justitia dei) without
prejudice to the honor, justice, and truth of God, this, this, is the business
that lay before them.

foederal, or of the nature of a Covenant: it was by mutual engagements and
stipulations, each person undertaking to perform his part in order to our
recovery.

We find each person undertaking for himself by solemn promise; The Father
promises, that he will hold his hand and keep him, Isa. 42.6. The Son
promises he will obey his Fathers call to suffering and not be rebellious,
Isa. 50.5. and having promised, each holds the other to his engagement. The
Father stands upon the satisfaction promised him, and when the payment was
making, he will not abate him one farthing, Romans 8.32. God spared not his own
Son: (i. e.) he abated nothing of the full price he was to have at his hands
for us.

And as the Father stood strictly upon the terms of the Covenant so did Christ
also, Ioh. 17.4, 5. I have glorified thee on earth (says he to the Father) I
have finished the work thou gave me to do, and now father glorify me with
thine own self: as if he had said, father the work is done, now where is the
wages I was promised? I call for glory as my due, as much my due, as the hire
of the labourer is his due, when his work is done.

five things which he promises to do for Christ, if he will undertake that
work.

First, he promises to invest him, and anoint him to a threefold office;
answerable to a threefold misery that lay upon the elect; as so many bars to
all communion with, and enjoyment of God: for if ever man be restored to that
happiness, the blindness of his mind must be cured; the guilt of sin expiated;
and his captivity to sin led captive: answerably, Christ must of God be made
unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30. And
he is made so to us, as our Prophet, Priest, and King: but he could not put
himself into either of these, for if so, he had acted without commission; and
consequently all he did had been invallid, Heb. 5.5* Christ glorified not
himself to be made an High Priest, but he that said unto him, thou art my Son.
A Commission there for to act authoritatively in these offices, being necessary
to our recovery; the Father engages to him to seal him such a threefold
commission.

He promises to invest him with an eternal and Royal Priesthood, Psalm. 110.4.
The Lord has sworn, and will not repent; thou art a Priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedeck: this Melchisedeck, being King of Righteousness, and King
of Salem; that is, Peace; had a Royal Priesthood, and his descent not being
reckoned, it had an adumbration of eternity in it; and so was more apt to Type
and Shadow forth the Priesthood of Christ, than Aarons was, Heb. 7.16, 17, 24,
25. as the Apostle accommodates them there.

He promises moreover to make him a Prophet, and that an extraordinary one,
even the Prince of Prophets: the chief Shepherd, as much superior to all
others, as the Sun is to the lesser Stars: so you have it, Isa. 42.6, 7. I will
give thee for a light to the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, etc.

And not only so, but to make him King also; and that of the whole Empire of
the World: so Psalm. 2.6, 7, 8. ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for
thine inheritance; and the utmost ends of the earth for thy possession: thus he
promises to qualify and furnish him completely for the work, by his
investiture with this Threefold office.

Secondly, And for as much as he knew it was a hard and difficult work his Son
was to undertake, a work that would have broken the backs of all the Angels in
Heaven, and men on earth, had they engaged in it: therefore he promises to
stand by him, and assist and strengthen him for it: so Isa. 42.5, 6, 7. I will
hold thy hand, Ego cujus immensa ac infinita est potentia, sic tibi favebo, ita
te fulciam, ut nihil adversus te posuit omnes adversarii tui. Marlor. in loc.
or take hold of thee with my hand, for so it may be rendered, (i. e.) I will
under-prop and support thy humanity when it is even over weighed with the
burden, that is to come upon it, and ready to sink down under it; for so you
know the case stood with him, Mark 14.34. and so it was foretold of him, Isa.
53.7. He was oppressed, etc. and indeed the humanity needed a prop of no less
strength than the infinite power of the God head, the same promise you have in
the first verse also Behold my Servant whom I uphold.

Thirdly, He promises to crown his work with success, and bring it to a happy
issue, Isai. 53.10. He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days; and the
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall not begin, and not
finish; he shall not shed his invaluable blood upon hazardous terms; but shall
see and reap the sweet fruit thereof. As the Joyful mother forgets her pangs,
when she delightfully embraces and kisses her living Child.

Fourthly, The Father promises to accept him in his work, though millions
should eternally perish. Isai. 49.4. Surely (says he) my work is with the
Lord. And ( verse 5.) I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord. His faith
had therein respect to this compact and promise, accordingly the Father
manifests the satisfaction he had in him, and in his work; even while he was
about it on earth; when there came such a voice from the excellent glory
saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

Fifthly, He engaged to reward him highly for his work, by exalting him to
singular and supereminent glory and honor; when he should have dispatched and
finished it. So you read, Psalm. 2.7. I will declare the decree the Lord has
said unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. It Is spoken of
the day of his resurrection, when he had just finished his suffering. And so
the Apostle expounds and applies it, Acts 13.32, 33. For then did the Lord wipe
away the reproach of his Cross, and invested him with such glory that he looked
like himself again. As if the Father had said, now thou have again recovered
thy glory, and this day is to thee as a new birthday.

These are the encouragements and rewards proposed and promised to him, by the
Father. This was the joy set before him, (as the Apostle phraseth it) in Heb.
12.2. which made him so patiently to endure the Cross and despise the Shame.

And in like manner, Jesus Christ restipulates, and gives his engagement to the
Father; that upon these terms he is content to be made flesh; to divest (as it
were) himself of his glory; to come under the obedience and malediction of the
Law; and not to refuse any, the hardest sufferings it should please his Father
to inflict on him. So much is carried in Esai. 50.5, 6, 7. The Lord has opened
mine ear, and I was not Rebellious; neither turned away back; I gave my back to
the Smiters, and my cheeks to them that pulled off the hair; I hid not my face
from shame and spitting: for the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not
be confounded; I have set my face as a flint, and I know that I shall not be
ashamed. When he says I was not Rebellio^s, (...)
he means I was most heartily willing and content to accept the terms; for
there is a Meiosis in the words, and much more is intended than expressed. And
the sense of this place is well delivered to us in other terms, Psalm. 40.6, 7,
8, 9, 10. Then said I lo I come, I delight to do thy will O God, thy Law is
within my heart. O see with what a full consent the heart of Christ closes
with the Fathers Offers, and Proposalls; like some Echo, that answers your
voice twice or thrice over. So does Christ here answer his Fathers call, I
come, I delight to do thy will, yea, thy Law is in my heart. And thus you see
the Articles to which they both Subscribed, or the Terms they agreed on.

I will briefly show, how these Articles and agreements were Math. 3.15. And at
last his soul was made an offering for Sin. So that he could say as it is, Ioh.
17.4. Father I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work thou
gave me to do. He went through all the parts of his active, and passive
obedience cheerfully, and faithfully. (2.) The Father made good his engagements
to Christ, all along, with no less faithfulness than Christ did his. He
promised to assist and hold his band, and so he did. Luke. 22.43. And there
appeared to him an Angel from heaven, strengthening him. That was one of the
sorest brunts that ever Christ met with, it was seasonable aid, and succor. He
promised to accept him in his work, and that he should be glorious in his eyes,
so he did. For he not only declared it by a voice from heaven, Luke 3.22. Thou
art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: But it was fully declared in his
resurrection and ascension, which were a full discharge and Justification of
him. He promised him that he should see his seed, and so he did, for his very
birth dew was as the dew of the morning; and ever since his blood has been
fruitful in the world. He promised gloriously to reward, and exalt him; and so
he has, Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. And that highly and supereminently, giving him a
name above every name in heaven and earth. Thus were the Articles performed.

Antequam ab omnibus retro seculis tempora fluere inciperent decrevit Deus hanc
nobis salutis gratiam per Christum confer. Calv. in loc.
2 Timothy 1.9. What grace was that which was given us in Christ before the world
began, but this grace of redemption, which from everlasting was thus contrived
and designed for us, in that way which has been here opened? Then was the
council, or consultation of peace betwixt them both. As some sense that
Scripture Zach. 6.13.

Next let us apply it to our selves.

Use.
1 Use.
The first Use that offers it self to us from hence, is the abundant security
that God has given the Elect for their salvation, and that not only in respect
of the covenant of Grace, made with them; but also of this Covenant of
redemption made with Christ for them; which indeed the foundation of the
covenant of Grace. Gods single promise is security enough to our faith, his
covenant of grace adds ex abundanti further security; but both these viewed as
the effects and fruits of this covenant of redemption, makes all fast and sure.
In the covenant of grace, we question not the performance on Gods part; but are
often stumbled at the grand defects on our parts; but when we look to the
covenant of Redemption, there is nothing to stagger our faith: both the
foederates being infinitely able and faithful to perform their parts; so that
there is no possibility of a failure there. Happy were it if puzzled and
perplexed Christians would turn their eyes, from the defects that are in their
own obedience, to the fullness and compleatness of Christ's obedience; and see
themselves complete in him, when most lame and defective in themselves.

Hence also be informed that God the Father, and God the Son, do mutually rely,
and trust to one another, in the business of our redemption. The Father relies
upon the Son, for the performance of his part; as it is Isa. 42.1. Behold my
servant whom I uphold. (...)
Montanus turns it on whom I lean, or depend. As if the Father had said,
Innitar in eo mont.
behold what a faithful Servant I have chosen, in whom my soul is at rest. I
know he will go through with his work, I can depend upon him. And to speak
plain, the Father so far trusted Christ, that upon the credit of his promise to
come into the world, and in the fullness of time to become a Sacrifice for the
Elect; he saved all the old Testament Saints; whose faith also respected a
Christ to come, with reference whereunto it is said, Heb. 11.39, 40. That they
received not the promise, God having provided some better thing for us; that
they without us, should not be made perfect, (i. e.) without Jesus Christ
manifested in the flesh, in our times; though believed on, as to come in the
flesh in their times. And as the Father trusted Christ, so does Christ in like
manner depend upon and trust his Father. For having performed his part, and
left the world again; he now trusts his Father, for the accomplishment of
that promise made him, Isa. 53.10. That he shall see his seed, etc. He depends
upon his Father for all the Elect that are behind, yet unregenerated, as well
as those already called, that they shall be all preserved unto the heavenly
Kingdom, according to that, Ioh. 17, 11. And now I am no more in the world, but
these are in the world; and I come unto thee, holy Father, keep through thine
own name, those whom thou have given me. And can it be imagined, that the
Father will fail his trust; who every way accquitted himself so punctually to
the Father? It cannot be.

hence we infer the validity and unquestionable success, of Christ's
intercession in heaven; for believers. You read Heb. 7.25. That he ever lives,
to make intercession. And Heb. 12.24. That his blood speaks for good things,
for them. Now, that his blood shall obtain what it pleads in heaven for, is
undoubted: and that from the consideration of this covenant of redemption: for
here you see that the things he now asks of his Father, are the very same which
his Father promised him, and Covenanted to give him; before this world was: so
that besides the interest of the person, the very equity of the matter speaks

him; as the wages of the hyrling, when the work is ended: if the work be done,
and done faithfully, as the father has acknowledged it is: then the reward is
due, and due immediately; and no doubt but he shall receive it, from the hands
of a righteous God.

Hence in like manner you may be informed of the consistency of grace, with full
satisfaction to the Justice of God; the Apostle 2 Timothy 1.9. tells us, we are
saved according to his own purpose, and grace which was given us in Christ
Jesus; before the world began: that is, according to the gracious terms of this
Covenant of Redemption; and yet you see notwithstanding, how strictly God
stands upon satisfaction from Christ: so then Grace to us, and satisfaction to
Justice; are not so inconsistent as the Socinian Adversaries would make them:
what was debt to Christ, is grace to us: when you hear men cry out, here is
Grace indeed! pay me all, and I will forgive you; remember, how all mouths are
stopped with that one Text, Romans 3.24. being Justified freely by his grace, and

who complied with such hard terms for their salvation: they were hard and
difficult terms indeed, on which Christ received you from the Fathers hand; it
was as you have heard, to pour out his soul unto death, or not to enjoy a soul
of you: here you may suppose the Father to say, when driving this bargain with
Christ for you:

My Son, Father.
here be a company of poor miserable souls, that have utterly undone
themselves; and now lie open to my Justice, Justice demands Satisfaction for
them, or will satisfy it self in the eternal ruin of them: what shall be done
for these souls? And thus Christ returns,

O my Father, Son.
such is my love to, and pity for them; that rather than they shall perish
eternally, I will be responsible for them, as their Surety: bring in all thy
bills, that I may see what they owe thee. Lord bring them in all, that there
may be no after reckonings with them; at my hand shall thou require it. I will
rather choose to suffer thy wrath, than they should suffer it. Upon me, my
Father, upon me be all their debt.

But my Son, Father.
if thou undertake for them; thou must reckon to pay the last mite: expect no
abatements, if I spare them, I will not spare thee.

Content Father, Son.
let it be so: charge it all upon me: I am able to discharge it; and though it
prove a kind of undoing to me, though it impoverish all my riches, empty all my
treasures, (for so indeed it did, 2 Cor. 8.9. though he were rich, yet for our
sakes became poor) yet I am content to undertake it: blush ungrateful
believers, O let shame cover your faces. Judge in your selves now, has Christ
deserved that you should stand with him for trifles; that you should shrink at
a few petty difficulties, and complain, this is hard, and that is harsh, O if
you knew the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, in this his wonderful
condescension for you; you could not do it.

Yes, We may know without ascending into Heaven; or prying into unrevealed
Secrets: that our names were in that Covenant, if (1.) You are believers
indeed; for all such the Father then gave to Christ, John 17.8. the men that
thou gave me, (for of them he spoke immediately before) they have believed
that thou did send me. (2.) If you savingly know God in Jesus Christ, such
were given him by the Father, Joh. 17.6. I have manifested thy name, unto the
men thou gave me: by this they are discriminated from the rest, verse. 25. the
world has not known thee, but th^se have known, etc. (3.) If you are men and
women of another world, Joh. 17.16. they are not of the world, as I am not of
the world: may it be said of you, as of dying men; that you are not men and
women for this world, that you are Crucified and dead to it; Gal. 6.14. that
you are strangers in it, Heb. 11.13, 14. (4.) If you keep Christ's word; Joh.
17.6. thine they were, and thou gave them me; and they have kept thy word; by
keeping his word understand the receiving of the word in its sanctifying
effects and influences into your hearts, and your perseverance in the
profession and practice of it, to the end; Joh. 17.17. sanctify them through
thy truth, thy word is truth; Joh. 15.7. if ye abide in me, and my words abide
in you, ye shall ask what ye will; blessed and happy is that soul, upon which
these blessed characters appear; which our Lord Jesus has laid so close
together; within the compass of a few Verses in this 17 of John; these are the
persons the Father delivered unto Christ, and he accepted from the Father in
this blessed Covenant.

The FOURTH Sermon. 4.
SERMON. Opens the admirable love of God in giving his own Son for us.

JOH. III.XVI. For God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,
etc.


YOU have heard of the gracious purpose and design of God, to recover poor
sinners to himself by Jesus Christ; and how this design of love was laid and
contrived in the Covenant of Redemption, whereof we last spoke.

Now according to the terms of that Covenant, you shall hear from this
Scripture; how that design was by one degree, advanced toward its
accomplishment: in Gods actual giving or parting with his own Son for us: God
so loved the world, that he gave, etc.

The whole precedent context is spent in discovering the nature, and necessity
of Regeneration; and the necessity thereof is in this Text argued and inferred,
from the peculiar respect and eye God had upon believers, in giving Christ for
them; they only reaping all the special and saving benefits, and advantages of
that gift. God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son; that
whosoever believes in him, should not perish.

In the words are considerable.
benevolent, beneficient, or complacential; his benevolent love, is nothing
else but his desire, and purpose of saving and doing us good: so his purpose of
grace to Jacob, is called love: Romans 9.13. Jacob have I loved; but this being
before Jacob was, could consist in nothing else, but the gracious purpose of
God toward him: his beneficent love, is his actual doing good to the persons
beloved: or the bestowing the effects of his love upon us, according to that
purpose. His complacential love, is nothing else but that delight and
satisfaction he finds, in beholding the fruits, and workings of that grace in
us; which he first intended for us, and then actually collated, or bestowed on
us. This love of benevolence is that which I have opened to you under the
former head, Gods compact with Christ about us, or his design to save us, on
the Articles and terms therein specified.

The love of beneficence, is that which this Scripture speaks off, out of this
fountain Christ flowed to us, and both run into that of complacency; for
therefore he both purposed, and actually bestowed Christ on us, that he might
everlastingly delight in beholding the glory and praise of all this, reflected
on himself by his redeemed ones. This then is the fountain of our mercies.

the mercy as he is Emphatically called, Hic igitur unigeniti, nomen (...) est
ad commendandam i^ nos amoris divini v^he^entiam. Buling. in loc.
Luke 1.72. the marrow, kernel, and substance of all other mercies. He gave his
only begotten Son: this was the birth of that love, the like whereunto it never
brought forth before, therefore it is expressed with a double emphasis in the
Text, the one is that particle (...) so; he so loved the world: here is a sic
without a sicut: how did he love it? why he so loved it; but how much, the
tongues of Angels cannot declare. And moreover, to increase and aggravate the
mercy, he is styled his only begotten Son; to have given a Son, had been
wonderful; but to give an only begotten Son, that is love unexpressible,
unintelligible.

The objects of this love, or the persons into whose lap and that whosoever
believes in him should not perish: those whom he calls the world in that, he
styles believers in this expression; and the word [world] is put to signify
the elect, because they are scattered through all parts, and are among all
ranks of men in the world; these are the objects of this love: it is not
Angels, but men that were so loved; he is called (...), a lover, a friend of
man, but never (...), or (...) the lover of friend of Angels, or Creatures of
another species.

The manner in which this never enough celebrated mercy gave not he sold, or
barely parted from, but gave: nor yet does the Fathers giving imply Christ to
be merely passive, for as the Father is here said to give him; so the Apostle
tells us, Gal. 2.20. that he gave himself, who loved me and gave himself for
me: the Father gave him out of good will to men, and he as willingly bestowed
himself on that Service. Hence the Note is.

DOCT. Doct.
That the gift of Christ is the highest and fullest manifestation of the love
of God to sinners, that ever was made from eternity to them.
How is this gift of God to sinners signalized in that place of the Apostle,
Omnia dili^it deus quae fecet, and inter ea, magis creaturas rationales, and de
illis ea amplius quae sunt membra unigeniti, and multo magis ipsum unigenitum.
Aug. T. 9* in Johan.
1 John 4.10. herein is love, not that we loved God; but that he loved us; and
sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins; why does the Apostle so
magnify this gift, in saying herein is love, as if there were love in nothing
else? may we not say, that to have a being, a being among the rational
creatures; therein is love, to have our life carried so many years like a taper
in the hand of Providence, through so many dangers; and not yet put out in
obscurity: therein is love, to have food and raiment convenient for us, beds to
lie in; relations to comfort us, in all these is love; yea, but if you speak
comparatively; in all these there is no love, to the love expressed in sending or
giving Christ for us: these be great mercies in themselves, but set by this
mercy they are all swallowed up, as the light of Candles when brought into the
Sunshine: no, no; herein is the love, that God gave Christ for us. And it is
remarkable that when the Apostle would show us in Romans 5.8. what is the noblest
fruit that most commends to men the root of Divine love that bears it; he shows
us this very fruit of it that I am now opening. But God (says he) commends
his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners; Christ dyed for us;
this is the very flower of that love.

The Method into which I will cast this precious point, shall be this. (1.) To
show how Jesus Christ was given by the Father. (2.) How that gift is the
fullest and richest manifestation of the love of God, that was ever made to the
world. (3.) And then draw forth the Uses of it.

How was Jesus Christ given by the Father, and what is employed therein?

You are not so to understand it, as though God parted with his ^^terest and
propriety in his Son, when he is said to give him; he was as much his own as
ever, when men give they transfer propriety to another, but when God had given
him; he was, I say, still as much his own as ever: but this giving of Christ
implies. (1.) His designation and appointment unto death for us: for so you
read that it was done according to the determinate counsel of God, Acts 2.23.
look as the Lam^ under the Law was separted from the flock, and set apart for a
Sacrifice* though it were still living, yet it was intentionally, and
p^^paratively given, and consecrated to the Lord: so Jesus Christ was by the
counsel and purpose of God, thus chosen; and set apart for this Service; and
therefore in Esa. 42.1. God calls him his elect or chosen one. (2.) His giving
Christ implys a parting with him, or setting him (as the French has it) at
some distance from himself for a time: there was a kind of parting betwixt the
Father and the Son, when he came to tabernacle in our flesh: so he expresses
it, Joh. 16.28. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again
I leave the world, and go to the Father; this distance that his incarnation and
humiliation set him at, was properly as to his humanity which was really
distant from the glory into which it is now taken up; and in respect of
manifestation of delight and love. The Lord seemed to carry it as one at
distance from him. O this was it that so deeply pierced and wounded his Soul,
as is evident from that complaint, Psalm. 22.1, 2. My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? Why art thou so far from the voice of my roaring? O my God I cry
in the day time, and thou hear not, etc. (3.) Gods giving of Christ implies
his delivering him into the hands of Justice, to be punished. Even as condemned
persons are by sentence of Law, given or delivered into the hands of
executioners. So Acts 2.23. Him being delivered by the determinate counsel of
God, ye have taken; and with wicked hands have slain. And so he is said, Romans
8.32. To deliver him up to death for us all. The Lord when the time was come
that Christ must Suffer, did as it were say; O all ye roaring Waves of my
incensed Justice, now swell as high as heaven; and go over his soul and body.
Sink him to the bottom, let him go like Jonah his Type into the belly of Hell,
unto the roots of the Mountains. Come all ye raging storms that I have reserved
for this day of wrath, beat upon him; beat him down that he may not be able to
look up. Psalm. 40.12. Go Justice put him upon the rack; torment him in every
part, till all his bones be out of joint; and his heart within him be melted as
wax, in the midst of his bowels. Psalm. 22.14. And ye assembly of the wicked,
Jews and Gentiles that have so long gaped for his blood, now he is delivered
into your hands; you are now permitted to execute your malice to the full. I
now loose your chain, and into your hand and power is he delivered. (4.) Gods
giving of Christ implys his application of him, with all the purchases of his
blood; and settling all this upon us, as an inheritance, and portion. Ioh. 6.32,
33. My Father gives you the true bread, from heaven, for the bread of God is
he which comes down from heaven; and gives life unto the world. God has
given him as bread to poor starving creatures, that by faith they might eat,
and live. And so he told the Samaritaness, Ioh. 4 10. If thou knew the gift
of God, and who it is that says unto thee give me to drink; thou would have
asked of him, and he would have given thee living waters. Bread and water are
the two necessarys for the support of natural life, God has given Christ you
see to be all that, and more, to the spiritual Life.

God might have redeemed us in another way (for I suppose it is opus liberi
consilii) a free dispensation; but God so loved the world ( i. e) he took this
way that we might love Christ as well as believe in him. He might have redeemed
us so much in another way, but he could not oblige us so much in another way.

Manton in Jude. p 108. Mr. Wall in his none but Christ.


And this will be evidenced by the following particulars. (1.) If you consider
how near and dear Jesus Christ was to the Father. He was his Son, his only Son;
says the Text. The Son of his Love. The darling of his soul. His other self.
Yea one with himself. The express Image of his person. The brightness of his
Fathers glory. In parting with him, he parted with his own heart, with his very
bowels, as I may say. Yet to us a Son is given, Esa. 9.6. And such a Son as he
calls his dear Son, Col. 1.13. A late writer tells us that he has been
informed that in the Famine in Germany, a poor family being ready to perish
with Famine; the Husband made a motion to the Wife, to sell one of the Children
for bread, to relieve themselves, and the rest. The Wife at last consents it
should be so, but then they began to think, which of the four should be sold.
And when the eldest was named, they both refused to part with that, being their
first born, and the beginning of their strength. Well, then they came to the
second; but could not yield that he should be sold; being the very picture and
lively image of his Father. The third was named, but that also was a child that
best resembled the mother. And when the youngest was thought on, that was the
Benjamin: The child of their old age And so were content rather to perish
altogether in the Famine, than part with a child for relief. And you know how
tenderly Jacob took it, when his Joseph and Benjamin were rent from him. What
is a child; but a piece of the parent wrapped up in another skin? And yet our
dearest children are but as strangers to us, in comparison of the unspeakable
dearness that was betwixt the Father and Christ. Now that he should ever be
content to part with a Son, and such an only one; is such a manifestation of
Love, as will be admired to all Eternity.

And then (2.) let it be considered, to what he gave him, even to death and
that of the Cross; to be made a curse for us. To be the scorn and contempt of
men. To the most unparalleled sufferings that ever were inflicted or born by
any. It melts our bowels, it breaks our hearts to behold our children striving
in the pangs of death. But the Lord beheld his Son struggling under agonies
that never any felt before him. He saw him falling to the ground, Dolor Christi
major suit omnibus doloribus. Aquinas.
grovelling in the dust, sweating blood, and amidst those agonies turning
himself to his Father; and with an heart rending cry beseeching him, Father if
it be p^ssible, let this cup pass. Luke 22.42. To wrath, to the wrath of an
infinite God without mixture, to the very torments of hell, was Christ
delivered; and that by the hand of his own Father. Sure then, that love must
needs want a name, which made the Father of mercies deliver his own only Son,
to such miserys for us. (3.) It is a special consideration to enhance the love
of God in giving Christ, that in giving him, he gave the richest Jewel in his
Cabinet. A mercy of the greatest worth and most inestimable value. Heaven it
self is not so valuable and precious as Christ is. He is the better half of
heaven. And so the Saints account him. Psalm. 73.25. Whom have I in heaven but
thee? Ten thousand thousand worlds, Christus, and coelum non patiuntur
hyperbolem.
(says one) as many worlds as Angels can number; and then as a new world of
Angels can multiply: would not all be the balk of a balance, to weigh Christ's
Excellency, Love, and sweetness.

O what a fair one! What an only one! What an excellent lovely ravishing one,
is Christ. Put the Beauty of ten thousand Paradices, like the garden of Eden
into one; put all Trees, all Flowers, all Smells, all Colors, all Tastes, all
Ioys, all Sweetness, all Loveliness in one; O what a fair and excellent thing
would that be! And yet it should be less to that fair and dearest well beloved
Christ, than one drop of rain to the whole Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and Fountains
of ten thousand Earths. Christ is heavens wonder, and earths wonder.

Now for God to bestow the mercy of mercys, the most precious thing in heaven
or earth upon poor sinners: and as great, as lovely, as excellent as his Son
was; yet not to account him too good to bestow upon us, what manner of love is
this! (4.) Once more, let it be considered on whom the Lord bestowed his Son.
Upon Angels? No, but upon men. Upon man his friend? No, but upon his enemies.
This is Love; And on this consideration the Apostle lays a mighty weight in
Romans 5.8, 9, 10. But God (says he) commends his love toward us, in that
while we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us. -- When we were enemies we were
reconciled to God by the death of his Son. Who would part with a Son, for the
sake of his dearest friends? but God gave him to, and delivered him for
enemies. O Love unspeakable! (5.) Lastly, let us consider how freely this gift
came from him. It was not wrested out of his hand by our importunity, for we as
little desired, as deserved it. It was surprising, preventing, eternal love
that delivered him to us. Not that we loved him, but he first loved us. 1 Ioh.
4.19. Thus, as when you weigh a thing; you cast in weight after weight, till
the scales break: so does God, one consideration upon another to overcome our
hearts, and make us admiringly to cry, what manner of Love is this! And thus I
have showed you what Gods giving of Christ is. And what matchless love is
manifested in that incomparable gift.

Next we shall apply this, in some practical Corolaries.

Corolary 1.
Corol. 1.
Learn hence the exceeding preciousness of Souls; and at what an high rate God
values them, that he will give his Son, his only Son out of his bosom as a
ransom for them. Surely this speaks their preciousness. God would not have
parted with such a Son, for small matters. All the world could not redeem them.
Gold and Silver could not be their ransom. 1 Pet. 1.18. So speaks the Apostle,
You were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold; but with the
precious blood of Christ. Such an esteem God had of them, that rather than they
should perish: Jesus Christ shall be made a man, yea a curse for them. O then
learn to put a due value upon your own souls. Don't sell that cheap, which God
has paid so dear for. Remember what a treasure you carry about you. The glory
that you see in this world, is not equivolent in worth to it, Matthew. 16.26.
What shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?

Corolary 2.
If God have given his own Son for the world, then it follows, that those for
whom God gave his own Son, Corol. 2.
may warrantably expect any other Temporal mercies from him. This is the
Apostles Inference, Romans 8.32. He that spared not his own Son, but delivered
him up to death for us all; how shall he not with him freely, give us all
things? And so 1 Cor. 3.21*22. All is yours, for ye are Christ's, (i. e.) They
hold all other things in Christ; who is the Capital, and most comprehensive
mercy. To make out the grounds of this comfortable deduction, let these four
things be pondered, and duly weighed in your thoughts. (1.) No other mercy you
need, or desire, is, or can be so dear to God, as Jesus Christ is. He never
laid any other thing in his bosom, as he did his Son. As for the world and the
comforts of it, it is the dust of his feet, he values it not. As you see by his
providential disposals of it; having given it to the worst of men. All the
Turkish Empire (said Luther) as great and glorious as it is, Totum Iurcicum
imperiam quantum, quantum est; mica tantum est* quam Pater familias projicit
cambus. Luther.
is but a crum which the Master of the family throws to the Dogs. Think upon
any other outward enjoyment that is valuable in your eyes, and there is not so
much compare betwixt it, and Christ, in the esteem of God, as is betwixt your
dear Children, and the Lumber of your houses, in your esteem. If then God have
parted so freely from that which was infinitely dearer to him than these, how
shall he deny these, when they may promote his glory and your good? (2.) As
Jesus Christ was nearer the heart of God than all these, so Christ is in
himself much greater, and more excellent than them all; Ten thousand worlds,
and the glory of them all, is but the dust of the balance, if weighed with
Christ. These things are but poor creatures, but he is over all; God blessed
for ever. Romans 9.5. They are the common gifts, but he is the gift of God. Joh.
4.10. They are ordinary mercys, but he is the mercy, Luke 1.72. As one Pearl or
precious stone is greater in value than ten thousand common pebbles. Now, if
God have so freely given the greater, how can you suppose he should deny the
lesser mercys? Will a man give to another a large inheritance, and stand with
him for a trifle. How can it be. (3.) There is no other mercy you stand in want
of, but you are entitled to it by the gift of Christ. It is (as to right)
conveyed to you with Christ. So in the forecited, 1 Cor. 3.21, 22, 23. The
world is yours, yea, all is yours; for ye are Christ's. So 2 Cor. 1.20. For all
the promises of God in Christ, in him they are, yea, and in him Amen. With him
he has given you all things, (...). 1 Timothy 6.17. Richly to enjoy. The word
signifies rem aliquam cum laetitia percipere. To have the sweet relish, and
comfort of an enjoyment. So have we in all our mercys, upon the account of our
title to them in Christ. (4.) Lastly, if God have given you this nearer,
greater, and all comprehending mercy when you were enemies to him; and
alienated from him: it is not imaginable he should now deny you any inferior
mercy, when you are come into a state of reconciliation and amity with him. So
the Apostle reasons, Romans 5.8, 9, 10. For if when we were enemies, we were
reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall
be saved by his life. And thus you have the second Inference with its grounds.

Corolary 3.
Corol. 3.
If the greatest love has been manifested in giving Christ to the world, then
it follows, that the greatest evil and wickedness is manifested in despising,
slighting, and rejecting Christ. It Is sad to abuse the love of God manifested
in the lowest gift of providence, but to slight the richest discoveries of it;
even in that peerless gift; wherein God commends his love in the most taking
and astonishing manner: this is sin with a witness. Blush O heavens, and be
astonished O earth; yea, be ye horribly afraid. No guilt like this. The most
flagitious wretches among the barbarous Nations, are innocent in comparison of
these. But are there any such in the world? Dare any slight this gift of God?
indeed, if men's words might be taken; there are few or none that dare do so;
but if their lives and practices may be believed; this, this is the sin of the
far greater part of the Christianized world. Witness the lamentable stupidity
and supiness, witness the contempt of the Gospel, witness the hatred and
persecution of his Image, Laws, and People. What is the language of all these
but a vile esteem of Jesus Christ.

And now let me a little expostulate with these ungrateful souls that trample
underfoot the Son of God. That value not this love that gave him forth. What is
that mercy which you so contemn, and undervalue? Is it so vile and cheap a
thing, as your entertainment speaks it to be? Is it indeed worth no more than
this in your eyes? Surely you will not be long of that opinion. Will you be of
that mind think you, when death and Judgment shall have thoroughly awakned you?
O no, then a thousand worlds for a Christ. As its storied of our Crookback'd
Richard, when he lost the field and was in great danger by his enemies that
pressed upon him; O now (said he) a Kingdom for an Horse. Or think ye that any
beside you in the world are of your mind? You are deceived, if you think so. To
them that believe he is precious through all the world, 1 Pet. 2.7. And in the
other world, they are of a quite contrary mind. Could you but hear what is said
of him in heaven, in what a dialect the Saved of the Lord do extol their
Savior: Fie fie (says one) upon this condemned and foolish world, that will
give so little for Christ, and salvation; Oh! if there were but a free market
proclaimed of Christ and salvation in that day, when the Trumpet of God shall
awaken the dead, how many buyers would be there? God s^nd me no more happines^
but that which the blind world [to their ete^nal wo] leteth slip through their
fingers.
or could you but imagine the self revenges, the self torments which the damned
suffer for this their folly: and what a value they would set upon one tender of
Christ, if it might but again be hoped for: you would see that such as you, are
the only despisers of Christ. Beside, methinks its astonishing, that you should
despise a mercy in which your own souls are so dearly, so deeply, so
everlastingly concerned in; as they are in this gift of God. If it were but the
soul of another, nay less, if but the body of another; and yet less than that,
if but another beast, whose life you could preserve, you are obliged to do it:
but when it is thy self, yea, the best part of thy self; thine own invaluable
soul that thou ruinest and destroyest hereby: Oh what a monster art thou to
cast it away thus! What! will you slight your own souls? Care you not whether
they be saved, or whether they be damned? Is it indeed an indifferent thing
with you, which way they fall at death? Have you imagined a tolerable Hell? Is
it easy to perish? Are you not only turned Gods enemies, but your own too? O
see what monsters can sin turn men and women into! O the stupifying, besotting,
intoxicating power of Sin! But perhaps you think that all these are but
uncertain sounds, with which we alarm you. It may be thine own heart will
Preach such Doctrine as this to thee. Who can assure thee of the reallity of
these things? What should thou trouble thy self about an invisible world? or
be so much concerned for what thine eyes never saw, nor did ever receive the
report from any that have seen them? Well, though we cannot now show you these
things, yet shortly they shall be shown you: and your own eyes shall behold
them. You are convinced and satisfied that many other things are real, which
you never saw. But be assured, that if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast,
and every transgression, and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:
How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? Which at first began to
be spoken to us by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him:
God also bearing them witness, Heb. 2.2, 3, 4. But if they be certain, yet they
are not near. It will be a long time before they come: poor soul, how do thou
cheat thy self! It may be not by twenty parts, so long a time as thine own
fancy draws it forth for thee. Thou art not certain of the next moment.

And suppose what thou imaginest, what is Twenty or Forty years when it is
past? yea, what is a thousand years, to the vast eternity? Go trifle away a few
days more, sleep out a few nights more, and then lie down in the dust; it will
not be long ere the Trump of God shall awaken thee: and thine eyes shall behold
Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven, and then you will know the price of this
sin. O therefore if there be any sense of eternity upon you, any pity or love
for your selves in you, if you have any concernments more than the beasts that
perish, despise not your own offered mercies, slight not the richest gift, that
ever was yet opened to the world, and a sweeter cannot be opened to all
Eternity.

The FIFTH Sermon. 5.
SERMON. Treats of Christ's wonderful Person.

JOH. I.XIV. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, etc.


YOU have heard the Covenant of Redemption opened. The work therein propounded
by the Father, The incarnation is the miracle of miracles, a testimony against
unbelievers, Isa. 7.14. and a document to believers. None can declare his
generation, Isa. 53.8. Neither can any declare his incarnation, his name is
secret, Judge. 13.18. Wonderful. Isa. 9.6. A name that no man knows, viz.
perfectly but himself. The Trinity is the greatest, the incarnation is the next
mystery. Nortons Ortho. Evang. p. 38.
and consented to by the Son; is such as infinitely exceeds the power of any
mere Ceature to perform. He that undertakes to satisfy God by obedience for
the sin of man, must himself be God. And he that performs such a perfect
obedience, by doing and suffering all that the Law required in our rooms, must
be man. These two natures must be united in one person, else there could not be
a concourse or cooperation of either nature, in his mediatory works. How these
natures are united in the wonderful person of our Immanuel, is the first part
of the great mystery of of godliness. A Subject studied and adored by Angels.
And the mystery thereof is wrapped up in this Text. Wherein we have, First, the
incarnation of the Son of God plainly asserted. Secondly, that assertion
strongly confirmed.

In the assertion we have three parts.
The person assuming, (...), the word, (i. e.) the second person, or subsistent
in the most glorious Godhead; called the Word, either because he is the scope,
and principal matter both of the prophetical, and promisory word. Verbum
Substantiale non prolatium. Fulgentius lib. 1.
Or because he expounds and reveals the mind and will of God to men, as verse.
18. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father; he has
declared, or expounded him.

Nature assumed, (...) flesh, (i. e.) the entire humane Nature, consisting of a
true humane soul, and body. For so this word (...) in Romans 3.20. And the Hebrew
word (...), which answers to it, by a usual Metonymie of a part for the whole,
is used, Genesis 6.12. And the word flesh is rather used here, than man; on
purpose to aggravate, the admirable condescension and abasement of Christ:
there being more of vileness, weakness, and opposition to spirit, in this word
than in that, Voluit Evangelista uti potius carnis, quam hominis nomin^; ut
magis appareret, quo se divinum verbum abjecerit, cum caro factum est. Nam and
vilitas major in carne apparet, and oppositio major cum spiritu. Macco^^ loc.
Com.
as is pertinently noted by some. Hence the whole nature is denominated by that
part and called flesh.

fuit he was, (as Socinus would render, in design to overthrow the existence of
Christ's glorified body now in heaven.) But factus est, it was made, (i. e.) he
took, or assumed the true humane nature, (called flesh, for the reason before
rendered) into the unity of his divine person; with all its integral parts, and
essential properties; and so was made, or became a true and real man, by that
assumption. The Apostle speaking of the same act. Heb. 2.16. Uses another word,
He took on him, (...) fitly rendered, he took on him, or he assumed. Which
assuming, though inchoative it was the work of the whole Trinity, God the
Father,, in the Son, by the spirit forming, on creating that nature; as if
three Sisters should make a garment betwixt them, which only one of them wears:
yet terminative, it was the act of the Son only. 'Twas he only that was made
flesh. And when it is said, he was made flesh, misconceive not, as if there was
a mutation of the Godhead into flesh, for this was performed Non mutando quod
erat, sed assumendo quod non erat. Aug.
not by changing what he was, but by assuming what he was not. As Aug. well
expresses it. As when the Scripture in a like expression says he was made
sin, 2 Cor. 5.21. And made a curse, Gall. 3.13. The meaning is not, that he was
turned into sin, or into a curse: no more may we think here the Godhead was
turned into flesh, and lost its own being and nature; because it is said he was
made flesh. This is the sum of the Assertion.

This assertion [ that the word was made flesh ] is strongly He dwelt among us,
and we saw his glory. This was no Phantasm, but a most real, and indubitable
thing. For (...), he pitched his tent, or Tabernacled with us. And we are
eyewitnesses of it. Parralel to that, Ioh. 1.1, 2, 3. That which was from the
beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen, with our eyes, which we
have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of Life, etc. Declare
we unto you. Hence Note.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ did really assume the true and perfect nature of man,
into a personal union with his divine nature; and still remains true God, and
true man; in one person for ever.
The Proposition contains one of the deepest mysteries in godliness, 1 Timothy
3.16. Incarnatio est opus de^, quo filius dei secundum oeconomiam divini
consilii patris and sui, and spiritus sancti s^se humilians; veram, integram,
perfectam, sanctamque cara^m ex virgin Mariae, spiritus sa^cti operatione, and
efficacia; in unitate personae sibi assumpfit: ita ut caro illa nullam propriam
subsistentiam extra^dei filium habeat, sed ab illo, and in ^o vere sustentetur
and gestetur: duabus perfectis naturis inter se (...) unitis; unde constituitur
persona Christi (...), etc. Synopsis purioris Theologiae. p. 295.
A mystery by which apprehension is dazzled, invention astonished; and all
expression swallowed up. If ever the tongues of Angels were desirable to
explicate any word of God, they are so here. Great is the interest of words in
this Doctrine; We walk upon the brink of danger. The least tread awry, may
ingulph us in the bogs of error. Arrius would have been content if the Council
of Nice would but have gratified him in a Letter (...), and (...). The
Nestorians also desired but a Letter (...). These seemed but small and modest
requests, but if granted had proved no small prejudices to Jesus Christ, and
his truths. I desire therefore the Reader would with greatest attention of
mind, apply himself to these truths. It Is a Doctrine hard to understand, and
dangerous to mistake. I am really of his mind that said Reason (says one) can
never show it self more reasonable, than in ceasing to reason, about things
which are above reason. Quae sunt occulta, non sunt f^rutanda. Quae manifesta,
non negligenda. Prosper.
its better not touch the bottom, than not keep within the circle, melius est
nescire centrum, quam non tenere circulum. He did assume a true humane body;
that is plainly asserted, Phil. 2.7, 8, etc. Heb. 2.14, 16. In one place its
called taking on him the seed of Abraham, and in the Text Flesh. He did also
assume a true humane soul, that is undeniable by its operations, passions, and
expiration at last, Matthew. 26.38. and 27.50. And that both these natures make
but one person, is as evident from Romans 1.3, 4. Jesus Christ was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with
power; according to the Spirit of holiness, by the Resurrection from the Dead.
So Romans 9.5. Of whom as concerning the flesh, Christ came; who is over all, God
blessed for ever, Amen. But that you may have a sound and clear understanding
of this mystery, Nomina concreta non multiplicantur, nisi multiplicentur
supposita. U^um autem cum tantum sit in christo suppositum; Un^s t^atum sit
christus, necesse est. Trelcat. page 67.
I will (1.) open the nature (2.) the effects and (3.) the reasons or ends of
this wonderful union.

The nature of the Hypostaticall union opened.
That of three persons in one God, essentially. That of two distinct natures,
and persons; by one Spirit, mystically. And this of two distinct natures, in
one person; Hypostatically. This is my task to open at this time. And for the
more distinct and perspicuous management thereof, I shall speak to it both
Negatively and positively.

Neg. Non (...).
Think not when Christ assumed our nature that it was united consubstantially,
so as the three persons in the Godhead; are united among themselves. They all
have but one and the same nature, and will; but in Christ are two distinct
natures, and wills; though but one person.

Nor yet that they are united Physically, as soul and body are Non (...).
For death actually dissolves that, but this is indissoluble. So that when his
soul was expired, and his body interred; both soul and body were still united
to the second person, as much as ever.

Nor yet is it such a mystical union, as is between Christ and Non (...).
Indeed that is a glorious union, but though believers are said to be in
Christ, and Christ in them; yet they are not one person with him. They are not
Christed into Christ, or Goded into God; as blasphemous Familists speaks.

But this Assumption of which I speak, Pos.
is that whereby the second person in the Godhead did take the humane nature
into a personal union with himself, by virtue whereof, the manhood subsists in
the second person, (...), non quidem (...), aliud, ex aliis sed (...); duae
ipsae naturae, in personam unitae. Damasc.
yet without confusion: both making but one person, (...), or Immanuel; God
with us.

So that though we truly ascribe a twofold nature to Christ, yet not a double
person. For the humane nature of Christ never subsisted seperately and
distinctly, by any personal subsistence of its own; Hama^a natura non est
(...), per se s^bsistens, neque prius h^mana natura fuit, and postea assumpta
fuit, sed (...) atque in persona (...) subsistit. Et sic una est Christi
persona, in qua quidem est (...) aliud atque aliud; sed non (...) alius atque
alius. Ut Greg. Naz, apud Theodoret. Dialog. 2.
as it does in all other men; but from the first moment of conception,
subsisted in union with the second person.

To explicate this mystery more particularly, let it be considered.

First, The humane nature was united to the second person miraculously, and
extraordinarily: being supernaturally framed in the womb of the Virgin, by the
over-shadowing power of the highest, Luke 1.34, 35. By reason whereof it may
truly and properly be said, to be the fruit of the womb, not of the loins of
man, but not by man. And this was necessary to exempt the assumed nature from
the stain and pollution of Adams Sin, which it wholly escaped; in as much as he
received it not as all others do, in the way of ordinary generation; wherein
Original sin is propagated: but this being extraordinarily produced, was a most
pure and holy thing, Luke 1.35. And indeed this perfect shining holiness in
which it was produced, was absolutely necessary; both in order to its union
with the Divine person, and the design of that union; which was both to
satisfy for, and to sanctify us. The two natures could not be conjoined in
the person of Christ, had there been the least taint of sin upon the humane
nature. For God can have no fellowship with sin, much less be united to it. Or
supposing such a conjunction with our sinful nature, yet he being a sinner
himself, could never satisfy for the sins of others. Nor could an unholy thing
ever make us holy. Such an High Priest therefore became us as is holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, Heb. 7.26. And such an one must he
needs be, whom the holy Ghost produces in such a peculiar way (...). That holy
thing.

Secondly, As it was produced miraculously, so it was assumed integrally. That
is to say Christ took a complete and perfect humane soul and body, with all and
every faculty and member pertaining to it. And this was necessary (as both
Austin and Fulgentius have well observed) that hereby he might heal the whole
nature, Aug. de civitate dei l^b. 10. cap. 27. p. 586.

Fugen. ad Tra. lib. 1. p. 251.

Damasc. lib. 3. cap. 20.


of that Leprosy of sin; which had seized and infected every member and
faculty. (...). He assumed all, to sanctify all; as Damascen expresses it. He
designed a perfect recovery by sanctifying us wholly in Soul, Body, and Spirit.
And therefore assumed the whole in order to it.

Thirdly, He assumed our nature as with all its integral parts, so with all its
Sinless infirmities. Nec ulla peccati coatagio naturam illam humanam Christi
inficere potuit, cujus substantiam in se alioqui corruptam originarie,
ineffabilis spiritus sancti operatio ab omni prorsus macula sanctificavit and
purgavit plenissime; and ita fieri debait, utpot^ in qua purgatio peccatorum
nostrorum facienda erat. Trelcat. Jnstit. p. 58.
And therefore its said of him, Heb. 2.17. That it behoved him, (...),
according to all things (that is all things natural, not formally sinful, as
it is limited by the same Apostle, Heb. 4.15.) to be made like unto his
brethren. But here our Divines do carefully distinguish infirmities into
personal, and natural. Personal infirmities, are such as befall particular
persons, from particular causes. Such as Dumbness, Blindness, Lameness,
Leprosies, Monstrosities, and other deformities. These it was no way necessary
that Christ should; not did he at all assume but the natural ones, such as
Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Sweating, Bleeding, Mortality, etc. Which though
they are not in themselves formally and intrinsecally sinful; yet are they the
effects, and consequents of sin. They are so many marks, that sin has left of
its self upon our natures. And on that account Christ is said to be sent in the
likeness of sinful Flesh, Romans 8.3. Wherein the gracious condescension of
Christ for us, is marvelously signallized. That he would not assume our
innocent nature, as it was in Adam before the fall; while it stood in all its
primitive glory, and perfection: but after sin had quite defaced, ruined, and
spoiled it.

Fourthly, Neque tamen humanitas hac ratione exaltata, aut in deitatem mutata,
aut cum eadem est confusa; quasi ulli^s^uae deit^ti peculi aris existet. sive
qualitatis, sive proprietatis particeps facta: sed ab eadem distiacta mansit,
usque manet^; constans nempe fraito corpore consimilique quoad substantiam and
facultates essentiales hominum aliorum omnium anima. Bradshaw de justific. p.
79.
The humane nature is so united with the Divine, as that each nature still
retains its own essential properties, distinct. And this distinction is not,
nor can be lost by that union. So that the two understandings, wills, powers,
etc. viz. The Divine and humane, are not confounded: but a line of distinction
runs betwixt them still, in this wonderful Person. It was the Heresy of the
Eutichians condemned by the Council of Chalcedon, to affirm that there was no
distinction betwixt the two natures in Christ. Against whom that Council
determined, that they were united (...) without any immutation, or confusion.

Fifthly, The union of the two natures in Christ, is an inseparable Union. So
that from the first moment thereof, there never was; nor to Eternity shall be,
any Separation of them.

If you ask how the union remained betwixt them, Doubt.
when Christ's humane Soul and Body were separated from each other upon the
Cross? Is not death the dissolution of union, betwixt Soul and Body?

Resolution.
True, The natural union betwixt his Soul and Body was dissolved by death for a
time, but this Hypostatical union remained even then as entire and firm as
ever. Tolletus rem sic ^leganter ill^strat.

Quemadmodum homo habens ensem in vagina, q^ando vult exe^it ^^s^m, and tamen
un^ manu vaginam tenet and altera ^^ser; sic divina pe^sona per mortem, animam
a corpore veluti ensem a vagina s^peravit, utramque tamen partem sibi habuit
unitam: per resurrectionem autem a^imam corpori copulavit, quasi ensem repo^ens
in vagina.


For though his Soul and Body were divided from each other; yet neither of them
from the Divine Nature. Divines assist our conception of this mystery by an
apt illustration. A man that holds in his hand a Sword sheathed, when he
pleases, draws forth the Sword; but still holds that in one hand, and the
sheath in the other, and then sheaths it again, still holding it in his hand;
so when Christ dyed his Soul and Body retained their union with the Divine
Nature, though not (during that space) one with another.

And thus you are to form and regulate your conceptions of this Justin Mar.
commend that union which the Soul and Body have with each other. They are of
different natures, yet both make one individual man. Others Alexan. A^es.
fault this because both these united make but one complete humane nature;
whereas in Christ's person are two perfect natures: and commend to us a more
perfect emblem viz. that of the Cyens and the tree or stock, which have two
natures, yet make but one tree. But then we must remember that the Cyens wants
a root of its own, which is an integral part; but Christ assumed our nature
integrally. This defect is by others Roberts of the Covenant.
supplied in the Miscletoe, and the Oak: which have different natures, and the
Miscletoe subsists in union with the Oak, still retaining the difference of
nature, and though making but one tree yet bears different fruits. And so much
to the first thing, namely the nature of this Union.

The results of the Hypostatical Union.


First, The two natures being thus united in the person of the mediator, by
virtue thereof the properties of each nature are attributed and do truly agree
to the whole person: so that it is proper to say the Lord of glory was
crucified, 1. Cor. 2.8. And the blood of God redeemed the Church, Acts 20.28.
That Christ was both in heaven, and in earth at the same time, Ioh. 3.13.

Yet, Proprietates utriusque naturae toti personae, in concreto vere competant.
Filius hominis qui est persona duabus constans naturis, est omnipresens,
aeternus, adorabalis, adorandus, nempe secundum naturam divi^am cujus baec sunt
(...), adoramus deitatem incarnatam, ipsa autem deitas est proprium and
absolutum Divinae adorationis objectum.
we do not believe that one nature does transfuse or impart its properties to
the other, or that it is proper to say the Divine nature Suffered, Bled, or
Dyed; or the humane is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent: but that the
properties of both natures, are so ascribed to the person; that it is proper to
affirm any of them of him in the concrete, though not abstractly. the right
understanding of this would greatly assist in reaching the true sense of the
forenamed, and many other dark passages in the Scriptures.

Secondly, Another fruit of this Hypostatical union is the singular advancement
of the humane nature in Christ far beyond and above what it is capable of in
any other person, it being hereby replenished and filled with an unparelell'd
measure of Divine graces and excellencies, Natura humana ita assumpta, supra
creaturan vi^iversam assumptionis hujus virtute; mirum in modum est Exaltata,
Heb. 1.4.5.6. Gul. Bradshaw de justificatione p. 79.
in which respect he is said to be anointed above or before his fellows, Psalm.
45.8. And so becomes the object of adoration, and Divine worship, Acts 7.59.
This the Socinians oppugn with this Argument. He that is worshipped with a
Divine worship as he is mediator, is not so worshipped as God: but Christ is
worshipped as mediator. But we say that to be worshipped as mediator, and as God;
are not opposite, but the one is necessarily included in the other; and therein
is farther included the ratio formalis sub qua, of that Divine religious
worship.

Thirdly, Hence in the last place follows as another excellent fruit of this
Union, the concourse and cooperation of each nature to his mediatory works.
For in them he acts according to both natures. The humane nature doing what is
humane, viz. Suffering, Sweating, Bleeding, Dying: and his Divine nature
stamping all these with infinite value; and so both sweetly concur unto one
glorious work, and design of mediation. Papists generally deny that he performs
any of his mediatory works as God, but only as man; but how boldly do they
therein contradict these plain Scriptures? See 2 Cor. 5.19. Heb. 9.14.15. And
so much as to the second thing propounded, viz. the fruits of this Union.

The reasons of the Hypostaticall Union.
And we may say touching that. (1.) That the humane nature was not assumed to
any intrinsecal perfection of the Godhead, but to make that humane nature it
self perfect. The Divine did not assume the humane nature necessarily, but
voluntarily; not out of indigence, but bounty: not because it was to be
perfected by it, but to perfect it, by causing it to lie as a pipe to the
infinite all-filling Fountain of grace and glory; of which it is the great
receptacle. (2.) And so consequently to qualify and prepare him for a full
discharge of his mediatorship in the offices of our Prophet, Priest, and King.
Had he not this double nature in the Unity of his person, he could not have
been our Prophet, for as God he knows the mind and will of God, Ioh. 1.18. Ioh.
3.13. And as man he is fitted to impart it suitably to us, Deuteronomy. 18.15, 16, 17,
18. Compared with Acts 3.22.

In natura huma^a satisfecit, sed preciur, dignitas, efficacia, and applicatio
illius satisfactionis a natura divina prevenit. Ames Bell Enerv. lib. 5.
As Priest, had he not been man, he could have shed no blood, and if not God, it
had been no adaequate value for us, Heb. 2.17. Acts 20.28.

As King, had he not been man, he had been an Heterogenous, and so no fit head
for us. And if not God he could neither rule nor defend his Body the Church.

These then were the designs and ends of that assumption.

Let all Christians rightly inform their minds in this truth, of so great
concernment in Religion; and hold it fast against all subtle adversaries that
would wrest it from them. The Learned Hooker observes that the dividing of
Christ's Person which is but one, and the confounding, of his Natures which are
two; has been the occasion of these errors which have so greatly disturbed the
peace of the Church. Arrians.
The Arrians denied his Deity, leveling him with other mere men. Apollinarian

The Sabellians affirmed that the Father and Holy Ghost were incarnated, as

them. Seleusians.
The Seleusians affirmed that he uncloathed himself of his humanity when he
ascended, and has no humane Body in Heaven. Nestorians.

But ye (Beloved) have not so learned Christ. Ye know he is (1.) true and very

and seem as it were to forget my own relation and endearments to my own Son, I

solace and dispart himself in it neither; not to experience sensitive
pleasures in the body; for as he needed them not, being at the Fountain head of
the highest joys, so it was not at all in his design, but the very contrary;
even to make himself a Subject capable of sorrows, wounds, and tears. It was as
the Apostle elegantly expresses it in Heb. 2.9. (...). That he might sensibly
taste what relish Death has, and what bitterness is in those pangs and agonies.
Now O that you would get your hearts suitably impressed and affected with these
high expressures, of the love both of the Father and Son. How is the courage of
some Noble Romans celebrated in the story, for the brave adventures they made
for the Commonwealth! But they could never stoop as Christ did, being so
infinitely below him in personal dignity.

And here the infinite wisdom has also left a famous and everlasting mark of it

Had there been a general Council of Angels, to advise upon a way of recovering
poor sinners; they would all have been at an everlasting demur and loss about
it. Non est inge^ii vel humani, vel angelici etiam, ejusmodi aliquem inventum

It could not have entered their thoughts, (though they are Intelligencies, and
most sagatious Creatures;) that ever mercy, pardon, and grace should find such
a way as this, to issue forth from the heart of God; to the hearts of sinners.
Oh how wisely is the method of our recovery laid! So that Christ may well be
called (...). 1 Cor. 1.24. The power, and wisdom of God. For as much as in him
the Divine wisdom is more glorified, than in all the other works of God, upon
which he has impressed it. Hence it is that some of the Schoolmen affirm
(though I confess my self unsatisfied with it,) that the incarnation of Christ
was in it self so glorious a demonstration of Gods wisdom and power, and
thereupon so desirable in it self; that though man had not sinned, yet Christ
would have been made man.

down in flesh, and so intimately uniting our flesh to himself; that it has no
proper subsistence of its own, but is united with the Divine person, hence it is
easy to imagine what worth and value must be in that blood, and how eternal
love springing forth triumphantly from it, flourishes into Pardon, Grace, and
Peace. Here is a way in which the sinner may see Justice and Mercy kissing each
other, and the latter exercised freely, without prejudice to the former. All
others Consciences through the world lie either in a deep sleep in the Devils
arms, or else are rouling (Sea sick) upon the waves of their own fears, and
dismal presages. O happy are they that have dropped Anchor on this ground, and

as well as with our common nature? For by this Union with our nature alone,
never any man was, or can be Saved. Yea, let me add; that this Union with your
natures is utterly in vain to you, and will do you no good; except he have
union with your persons by faith also. It is indeed infinite mercy that God is
come so near you, as to dwell in your flesh; and that he has fitted such an
excellent Method to save poor sinners in; And has he done all this? Is he
indeed come home, even to your own doors to seek Peace? Does he vail his
unsupportable glory under flesh, that he might treat thee more familiarly? And
yet do you refuse him, and shut your hearts against him? Then hear one word,
and let thine ears tingle at the sound of it; thy sin is hereby aggravated
beyond the sin of Devils, who never sinned against a Mediator in their own
nature; who never despised, or refused; because indeed they were never offered
terms of Mercy, as you are.

And I doubt not but the Devils themselves who now tempt you to reject, will to
all Eternity upbraid your folly for rejecting this great Salvation; which in
this excellent way is brought down, even to your own doors.

our burdens. And indeed this was one end of his assuming it, that he might be
able to have compassion on us, as you read, Heb. 2.17.18. Wherefore in all
things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a
merciful and faithful High Priest, in things pertaining to God; to make
reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself has
suffered, being tempted; he is able to succor them hat are tempted. O what a
comfort is this to us, that he who is our High Priest in Heaven, has our
nature on him, to enable him to take compassion on us!

Seventhly, Hence we see, To what an height God intends to build up the
happiness of man, in that he has laid the Foundation thereof so deep, in the
incarnating of his own Son.

They that intend to build high, use to lay the Foundation low. The happiness
and glory of our Bodies, as well as Souls, is founded in Christ's taking our
flesh upon him. For therein as in a Model, or Pattern, God intended to show,
what in time he resolves to make of our Bodies. For he will (...) transform our
vile Bodies, and make them one day conformable to the glorious Body of Jesus
Christ, Phil. 3.21. This flesh was therefore assumed by Christ, that in it
might be shown, as in a Pattern, how God intends to honor and exalt it. And
indeed a greater honor cannot be done to the nature of man, than what is
already done it by this grace of union. Nor are our persons capable of an
higher glory, than what consists in their conformity to this glorious head.
Indeed the flesh of Christ will ever have a distinct glory from ours in Heaven,
by reason of this Union. For being the the Body which the word assumed, it is
two ways advanced singularly above the Flesh and Blood of all other men, viz.
Subjectively and Objectively, Subjectively, it is the Flesh and Blood of God,
Acts 20.28. And so has a distinct and incommunicable glory of its own. And
Objectively, it is the Flesh and Blood which all the Angels and Saints adore.
But though in these things it be supereminently exalted, yet it is both the
Medium and Pattern of all that glory which God designs to raise us to.

Use 8.
Lastly, Use 8.
How wonderful a comfort is it that he who dwells in our Flesh is God! What Joy
may not a poor believer make out of this? What comfort one made out of it, I
will give you in his own words. I see it a work of God (says he) that
experiences are all lost when Summons of improbation to prove our Charters of
Christ to be counterfeit, are raised against poor Souls, in their heavy Trials.
But let me be a sinner and worse than the chief of Sinners: yea a guilty Devil,
I am sure my well beloved is God. And my Christ is God. And when I say my
Christ is God, I have said all things. I can say no more. I would, I could
build as much on this, My Christ is God, as it would bear: I might lay all the
world upon it.

God and Man in one Person, Oh thrice happy conjunction! As Man, he is full of
experimental sense of our Infirmities, Wants, and Burdens; and as God he can
support, and and supply them all. The aspect of Faith upon this wonderful
Person, how relieving, how reviving, how abundantly satisfying is it? God will
never divorce the believing Soul, and its comfort, after he has married our
nature to his own Son, by the Hypostatical: and our persons also by the blessed
Mystical Union.

The SIXTH Sermon. 6.
SERMON. Shows the Authority by which Christ as Mediator acted.

JOH. VI.XXVII. For him has God the Father Sealed.


YOU have heard Christ's compact or agreement with the Father, in the Covenant
of Redemption. As also what the Father did in pursuance of the ends thereof; in
giving his Son out of his bosom, etc. Also what the Son has done toward it in
assuming Flesh. But though the glorious work be thus far advanced, yet all he
should act in that assumed Body, had been invallid and vain, without a due
call, and Commission from the Father so to do. Which is the import of the words
now before you.

This Scripture is a part of Christ's excellent reply to a selfended generation,
who followed him, not for any Spiritual excellencies that they saw in him; or
Soul advantages they expected by him, but for bread. Instead of making his
service their meat and drink, they only served him that they might eat, and
drink. Self is a thing may creep into the best hearts, and actions; but it only
predominates in the Hypocrite. These people had sought Christ from place to
place, and having at last found him, they salute him with an impertinent
complement, Rabbi, when came thou hither? verse. 25. Christ's reply is partly
disswasive, and partly directive. He disswades them from putting the secondary
and subordinate, in the place of the principal, and ultimate end. Not to prefer
their Bodies to their Souls. Their fleshly accommodations, to the glory of God.
Labor not for the meat that perishes. Wherein he does not take them off from
their lawful labors, and callings: but he disswades them, first, from minding
these things too intently, and secondly, he disswades them from that odious Sin
of making Religion but a pretense for the belly.

And it is partly directive, and that in the main end and business of Life. But
labor for that meat which endures to Eternal Life. To get bread for your
Souls, to live Eternally by. And that he might engage their diligence in
seeking it to purpose, he shows them not only where they may have it, [ Which
the Son of Man shall give you] but also how they may be fully satisfied that he
has it for them; in the clause I have pitched on, For him has God the Father
Sealed.

In these words are three parts observable.
First, The Person Sealing, or investing Christ with Authority and Power. Which
is said to be God the Father. Though all the Persons in the Godhead are equal
in nature, dignity, and power: yet in their operation there is an order
observed among them. The Father sends the Son, The Son is sent by the Father,
The Holy Ghost is sent by both.

Secondly, The Subject in which God the Father lodges this Authority [ Him]
that is the Son of Man. Jesus Christ he is the (...) first receptacle of it.
And he must here be understood exclusively. God the Father has so Sealed him,
as he never Sealed any other before him, or that shall arise after him. No name
is given in heaven or earth, but this name by which we are Saved, Acts 4.12.
The government is upon his shoulders, Isa. 9.

Thirdly, Here is farther observable; the way and manner of the Fathers
delegating and committing this Authority to Christ. And that is by Sealing him.
Where we have both a Metonymie, the Symbal of Authority, being put for the
Authority it self. And a Metaphor, Sealing which is a humane act, for the
ratifying and confirming an Instrument or grant; being here applied to God.
Like as Princes by Sealed Credentials, confirm the Authority of those that are
sent by them. As the Dutch Annatators well express the meaning of it. Hence we
Note.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ did not of himself undertake the work of our
Redemption, Doct.
but was solemnly Sealed unto that work, by God the Father.
When I say he did not of himself undertake this work, I mean not that he was
unwilling to go about it; for his heart was as fully and ardently engaged in it
as the Fathers was: so he tells us, Psalm. 4.7. Lo I come to do thy will O God,
thy Law is in my heart. But the meaning is, he came not without a due call and
full commission from his Father. And so it is to be understood in opposition to
intrusion, not voluntary susception. And this is the meaning of that Scripture,
Ioh. 8.42. I proceeded and came from God, neither came I of my self but he sent
me. Nihil aliud posse^x dicto Apostoli elici, nisi ho^; Christum ab eo vo^atum
esse ad munus m^diatorium, a quo genitus est Cameronis Myrothec. p. 317.
And this the Apostle plainly expresses and fully clears, Heb. 5.4, 5. And no
man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron;
so also Christ glorified not himself, to be made an High Priest: but he that
said unto him thou art my Son. And on the account of these Sealed Credentials
he received from his Father he is called the Apostle and High Priest of our
profession, Heb. 3.1. (i. e.) One called and sent forth by the Fathers
Authority. Our present business then is to open Christ's commission, and view
the great Seal of Heaven, by which it was ratified.

And to preserve a clear Method in the explication of this great truth, into
which your Faith and comfort is resolved; I shall First show what was the work
and office to which the Father Sealed him. Secondly, What his Sealing to this
work does imply. Thirdly, How, and by what acts the Father Sealed him to it.
Fourthly, Why it was necessary that he should be thus Sealed, and authorized by
his Father. And then improve it, in its proper Uses.


Ioh. 17.2. It was to give Eternal Life to as many as were given him. It was to
bring Jacob, again to him, Esa. 49.5. Or as the Apostle expresses it, Pet.
3.18. That he might bring us to God. More particularly in order to the sure and
full effecting of this most glorious design, he was Sealed to the offices of a
Prophet, Priest, and King; that so he might bring about and compass this work.

First, God Sealed him a commission to Preach the glad tidings of Salvation to
sinners. This commission Christ opened, and read in the audience of the people,
Luke 4.18, 19, 20, 21. And when he had opened the Book, he found the place
where it is written; the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has
anointed me to Preach the Gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the
broken hearted, to Preach deliverance to the Captives, and the recovering of
sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised. To Preach the
acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the Book, etc. And he began to say
unto them, this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.

He also Sealed him to the Priesthood, and that the most excellent. Authorizing
him to execute both the parts of it, viz. Oblatory, and intercessory. He called
him to offer up himself a Sacrifice for us. I have power (says he) to lay down
my Life, this commandment have I received of my Father, Joh. 10.18. And upon
that account his offering up of his Blood, is by the Apostle styled an act of
obedience, as it is, Phil. 2.8. He became obedient unto death. He also called
him to intercede for us, Heb. 7.21, 24, 25. Th^se Priests were made without an
Oath, but this with an Oath; by him that said unto him, the Lord Swear and will
not repent; thou art a Priest for ever. Because his Sacrifice is vertually
continued in his living for ever to make intercession. As it is verse. 24. Yea
he called him to his Regal office he was set upon the highest throne of
Authority by his Fathers commission, as it is, Matthew. 28.18. All power in
heaven and earth, is given to me. To all this was Christ Sealed and Authorized
by his Father.

What does the Fathers Sealing of Christ to this work and First, The validity
and efficacy of all his mediatory acts. For by virtue of this his Sealing, what
ever he did was fully ratified. And in this very thing lies much of a believers
comfort and security. For as much as all acts done without commission and
authority, (how great or able so ever the person that does them is) yet are in
themselves null and void. But what is done by commission and authority, is
Authentic and most allowable among men. Had Christ come from heaven and entered
upon his Mediatory work, without a due call, our Faith had been stumbled at the
very threshold, but this greatly satisfies. Secondly, It imports the great
obligation lying upon Jesus Christ to be faithful, in the work he was Sealed
to. For the Father in this commission devolves a great trust upon him; and
relies upon him for his most faithful discharge thereof. And indeed upon this
very account, Christ reckons himself specially obliged to pursue the Fathers
design and end, Ioh. 9.4. I must work the works of him that sent me. And Joh.
5.30. I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which sent me. S^ill
his ^ye is upon that Work, and Will of his Father. And he reckons himself under
a nec^ssity of punctual and precise obedience to it. And as a faithful servant
will have his own will swallowed up in the Fathers will. Thirdly, It imports
Christ's complete qualification or instumental fitn^ss, to serve the Fathers
design and end in our recovery. Had not God known him to be every way fit and
qualified for the Work, he would never have Sealed him a commission for it. M^n
may, but God will not Seal an unfit or incapable person for his work. And
indeed what ever is desirable in a servant, was eminently found in Christ. For
faithfulness, none like him. Moses indeed was faithful to a Pin, but still as a
Servant: but Christ as a Son, Heb. 3.2. He is the faithful and true witn^ss,
Rev. 1.5, For Zeal, none like him. The Zeal of Gods house did eat him up, Ioh.
2.16, 17. He was so intent upon his Fathers work, that he forgot to eat bread,
counting his work his meat, and drink, Ioh. 4.32. Yea, and love to his Father
carried him on through all his work, and made him delight in the hardest piece
of his service. For he served him as a Son, Heb, 3.5, 6. All that ever he did
was done in love. For wisdom, none like him. The Father knew him to be most
wise, and said of him before he was employed, Behold my Servant shall deal
prudently, Isa, 52.13. To conclude, for self-denial, never any like him; he
sought not his own glory but the glory of him that sent him, Ioh. 8.50. Had he
not been thus faithful Zealous, full of love, prudent, and self-denying; he had
never been employed in this great affair. Fourthly, It implys Christ's sole
authority in the Church, to appoint and enjoin what he pleases. And this is
his peculiar prerogative. For the Commission God Sealed him in the Text, is a
single, not a joint Commission he has Sealed him, and none beside him. Indeed
there were some that pretended a call and commission from God, but all that
were before him, were Thieves and Robbers, that came not in at the door, as he
did, Omnes ante me (id est me^non mi^tente, ultro cum no^ fueri ^t mi^si
cucu^erunt se p^o messia venditaru^t) s^nt fu^es, and latrones; latro^um mo^e
adul^^rino quaepiam ostia caeli co^m ^ti su^t and per ca homines in aeternae
damnationis spelu^cam precipitar^nt. Dietericus.
Ioh. 10.8. And he himself foretells, that after him some should arise, and
labor to deceive the world, with a feigned Commission and a counterfeit Seal,
Matthew. 24.24. There shall arise false Christ's, and false Prophets, and shall
show great signs and wonders: insomuch that if it were possible, they should
deceive the very Elect. But God never commissionated any besides him, neither
is there any other name under heaven, Acts 4.12. Thus you see how the validity
of his Acts, his obligation to be faithful. His complete qualifications, and
sole Authority in the Church, are imported in his Sealing.




First, By Solemn designation to this work. He singled him out and set him
apart to it, (...)
and therefore the Prophet Isaiah cap. 42. verse. 1. Electus (i. e.) e^imius,
praestans, Excellens.
Calls him Gods Elect. And the Apostle Peter, 1 Pet. 2.4. Chosen of God. This
word which we render Elect, does not only signify one that in himself is
eximious, worthy, and excellent; but also one that is set apart and designed,
as Christ was for the work of mediation. And so much is carried in Ioh. 10.36.
Vide Dutch Anno^ in ^o^.
Where the Father is said to sanctify him (i e.) to separate, and devote him
to this Service. Secondly, He was Sealed not only by Solemn designation, but
also by Supereminent, and unparalleled Sanctification. He was anointed, as
well as appointed to it. The Lord filled him with the spirit, and that without
measure, to qualify him for this Service. So Isa. 61.1, 2, 3. The Spirit of the
Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to Preach, etc. Yea, the spirit
of the Lord was not only upon him, A Christo Christiani dicuntur (^. e)
u^ctionis sanctae (...): non ^^im titulu^ gerunt si^e re, sed qui dicuntur vere
Christiani (...) etiam obtinent. Glassius.

Dona ista absolute and in se finitae fuere, sicut and ipsa Christi natura
f^ita est; nostri tame^ respectu sunt absque m^nsura Dr. A^t. Explicat. Cat.
pa^s 2. p. 170.


but he was full of the Spirit, Luke 4.1. And so full as never was any beside
him. For God anointed him with the oil of gladness, above his fellows. Psalm.
45.7. Believers are his fellows, or copartners of this Spirit. They have an
anointing also; but not as Christ had. In him it dwelt in its fullness, in
them according to measure. It was poured out on Christ our head abundantly, and
ran down to the hem of his garment. God gave not the Spirit to him by measure,
Ioh. 3.34. God filled Christ's humane nature to the utmost capacity, with all
fullness of the Spirit of knowledge, wisdom, love, etc. Beyond all Creatures;
for the plenary, and more effectual administration of his mediatorship. He was
full extensively, with all kinds of grace. And full intensively, with all
degrees of grace. It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell,
Col 1.19. As light in the Sun, or water in a Fountain, that he might not only
fill all things, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 1.22. But that he might be prompt,
expedite, and every way fit to discharge his own work, which was the next and
mediate end of it. So that the holy oil that was poured out upon the heads of
Kings and Priests, whereby they were consecrated to their offices; Exodus 3^.23,
24, 25, 30, 31, 32.
was but Typical; of the Spirit by which Christ was consecrated, or Sealed to
his Offices. Thirdly, Christ was Sealed by the Fathers immediate testimony from
Heaven, whereby he was declared to be the Person whom the Father had solemnly
designed and appointed to this work. And God gave this extraordinary testimony
of him, at two remarkable seasons. The one was Just at his entrance upon his
Public Ministry, Caryll. in Job 1.7.
Matthew. 3. ult. The other but a little before his sufferings, Matthew. 17.5. This
voice was not formed by such Organs and Instruments of speech as ours are, but
by creating a voice in the air, which the people hear sounding thereby this God
owned, approved, and as by a Seal ratified his work. Fourthly, Christ was
Sealed by the Father, in all those extraordinary miraculous works wrought by
him, in which the Father gave yet more full and convincing testimonies to the
world, that this was he whom he had appointed to be our Mediator. These were
convictive to the world, that God had sent him. And that his Doctrine was of
God. God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power, who went
about doing good; and healing all that were oppressed of the Devil; for God was
with him, Acts 10.38. And so Ioh. 5.36. I have a greater witness than that of
John, for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works
that I do bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me. Therefore he still
referred those that doubted of him, or of his Doctrine, to this Seal of his
Father: even the miraculous works he wrought in the power of God. Matthew.
11.3.4, 5. And thus the Father Sealed him.


First, Else he had not corresponded with the Types which prefigured him, and
in him it was necessary that they be all accomplished. You know under the Law,
the Kings and Highpriests had their Inaugurations, by solemn unctions; in all
which this consecration, or Sealing of Christ to his work, was shadowed out.
And therefore you shall find, Heb. 5.4, 5. No man takes this honor to
himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron; so also (mark the
necessary correspondency betwixt Christ and them) Christ glorified not himself
to be made an High Priest, but he that said unto him thou art my Son. Secondly,
Moreover hereby the hearts of believers are the more engaged to love the
Father, in as much as it appears hereby that the Fathers love and good will to
them, was the Original and Spring of their Redemption. For had not the Father
Sealed him such a Commission, he had not come; but now he comes in the Fathers
name, and in the Fathers love, as well as his name: and so all men are bound to
ascribe equal glory and honor to them both. As it is Ioh. 5.23. Lastly, And
Especially, Christ would not come without a Commission, because else you had no
ground for your Faith in him. How should we have been satisfied that this is
indeed the true Messiah, except he had opened his Commission to the world, and
showed his Fathers Seal annexed to it? If he had come without his Credentials
from heaven, and only told the world that God had sent him; and that they must
take his bare word for it: Who could have rested his Faith on that Testimony?
And that is the true meaning of that place, Ioh. 5.31. If I bear witness of my
self, my witness, is not true. How so? You will say does not that contradict
what he says, Ioh. 8.14. Though I bear record of my self, yet my record is
true. Therefore you must understand truth, not as it is opposed to reality; but
the meaning is, if I had only given you my bare word for it, and not brought
other evidence from my Father, my Testimony had not been Authentic, and valid,
according to humane Laws. But now all doubtings are precluded. Let us next
improve this.
Inference 1.
Hence we infer the Unreasonableness of Infidelity, Infer. 1.
and how little the rejecters of Christ can have to pretend for their so doing.
You see he has opened his Commission in the Gospel, shown the world his
Fathers Hand and Seal to it, given as ample satisfaction as reason it self
could desire or expect: yet even his own received him not, Ioh. 1.11. And he
knew it before hand, and therefore complained by the Prophet Isa. 53.1. Who
has believed our Report? etc. Yea, and that he is believed on in the world, is
by the Apostle put among the great mysteries of godliness, 1 Timothy 3.16. A man
that well considers with what convincing evidence Christ comes, would rather
think it a mystery that any should not believe. But O the brutish obstinacy
and Devilish enmity that is in nature, to Jesus Christ! Devilish did I say, you
must give me that word again, for he compelled their assent. We know thee whom
thou art. And it is equally as wonderful to see the facility that is in nature
to comply (mean while) with any, even the most foolish imposture. Let a false
Christ arise, and he shall deceive many. As it is Matthew. 24.24. Of this Christ
complains, and not without great reason, Ioh. 5.43. I am come in my Fathers
name, and ye receive me not. If another come in his own name, him will ye
receive. q. d. You are incredulous to none but me. Every deceiver, every
pitiful cheat that has but wit, or rather wickedness, enough to tell you the
Lord has sent him; though you must take his own single word for it: He shall
obtain and get Disciples: but though I come in my Fathers name, (i. e.) sh^wing
you a Commission Signed and Sealed by him; doing those Works that none but a
God can do, yet ye receive me not. But in all this we must adore the Justice of
God, in permitting it to be so; giving men up to such unreasonable obstinacy,
and hardness. It is a sore plague that lies upon the world, and a wonder that
we all are not ingulphed in the same Infidelity.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
If Christ were Sealed to his Work by his Father, then how great is the sin of
those that reject, and despise such as are sent and Sealed by Jesus Christ: for
look as he came to us in his Fathers name, so he has sent forth by the same
Authority, Ministers in his name. And as he acts in his Fathers, so they in his
Authority. As thou have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them
into the world, Haec Apostolorum a Christo ^issio is formula, ^atis evidenter
comprobat, Apostolici mu^^ris aig^itatem in Apostolorum authoritate, and
potestate quae fuit Summa; and incomparabilis. Cameron.
Joh. 17.18. And so Ioh. 20.21. As my Father has sent me, so have I sent you.
You may think it a small matter to despise, or reject a Minister of Christ, (a
sin in the guilt whereof I think no Age has been plunged deeper than this) but
hear, and let it be a warning to you for ever; in so doing you despise and put
the slight both upon the Father that sent Jesus Christ, and upon Christ that
sent them. So that it is a rebellion that how ever it seems to begin low, in
some small piques against their persons, or some little quarrels at their parts
and Utterance, Tones, Methods, or gestures: yet it ^^ns high: even to the
Fountain head of the most supreme Authority. You that set your selves against a
Minister of Christ, set your selves against God the Father, and God the Son,
Luke 10.16. He that hears you, hears me^; and he that despises you,
despised me; and he that despises me, despises him that sent me. God expects
that yon behave your selves under the word spoken by us, as if he himself spoke
it. Yea, he expects submission to his word in the mouths of his Ministers, from
the greatest on earth. And therefore it was that God so severely punished
Zedekiah, U^ si herus ^amulo praescribat prim^m quid debeat praescribere
agend^m in familia, tum subjurgeret, qui te audit, me audit; non inde se
queretur fieri non posse ut ille famulus discedat ab he^i praescripto: aut sic
ubi descesserit ^i esse pa^a^dum. Camer. Myro. p 130.
because he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the Prophet, speaking from the
mouth of the Lord, 2 C^on. 36.12. God was angry with a great King, for not
humbling himself before a poor Prophet. Yet here you must distinguish both of
Persons, and of Acts. This reverence and submission is not due to them as men,
but as men in Office. As Christ's Ambassadors: and must involve that respect
still in it. Again, we owe it not to them, commanding or forbiding in their own
names, but in Christ's. Not in venting their own Spleen, but the terrors of the
Lord. And then to resist is an high rebellion, and affront to the Sovereign
Authority of Heaven. And by the way, this may instruct Ministers, that the way
to maintain that veneration, and respect that is due to them in the consciences
of their hearers, is by keeping close to their Commission.

Inference 3.
Hence also we infer, Infer. 3.
How great an evil it is to intrude into the Office of the Ministry, without a
due call. It Is more than Christ himself would do. He glorified not himself. The
honors and advantages attending that Office, have invited many to run before
they were Sent. But surely this is an insufferable violation of Christ's order.
Our Age has abounded with as many Church-Levellers, as state-Levellers. I wish
the Ministers of Christ might at last see and consider, what they were once
warned of by a faithful watchman. Mr. Strong.
I believe (says he) God has permitted so many to intrude into the Ministers
calling, because Ministers have too much meddled with, and intruded into other
men's callings.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Hence be convinced of the great efficacy that is in all Gospel Ordinances, duly
administered. For Christ having received full Commission from his Father, and by
virtue thereof having instituted and appointed those ordinances in the Church;
all the power in heaven is engaged to make them good, to back and second them,
to confirm and ratify them. Hence, in the censures of the Church, you have
that great expression, Matthew. 18.18. Whatsoever ye bind or loose on earth,
shall be bound or loosed in heaven. And so for the Word and Sacraments, Matthew.
28.18, 19, 20. All power in heaven and in earth is given to me, God therefore,
etc. They are not the appointments of men, your Faith stands not in the wisdom
of men, but in the power of God. That very power God the Father committed to
Christ, is the Fountain whence all Gospel institutions flow. And he has
promised to be with his Offices, not only the extraordinary Offices of that
Age; but with his Ministers in succeeding Ages, to the end of the world. O
therefore when ye come to an odinance, come not wi^h slight thoughts* but with
great reverence, and great expectations, remembering Christ is there to make all
good.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
Again, here you have another call to admire the grace and love both of the
Father and Son to your Souls. It is not lawful to compare them, but it is duty
to admire them. Was it not wonderful grace in the Father, to Seal a Commission
for the death of his Son, for the humbling of him as low as Hell, and in that
Method to save you, when you might rather have expected, he should have Sealed
your Mittimus for Hell rather than a Commission for your Salvation! He might
rather have set his irreversible Seal to the sentence of your Damnation, than
to a Commission for his Sons humiliation for you. And no less is the love of
Christ to be wondered at, that would accept such a Commission as this for us,
and receive this Seal, understanding fully (as he did) what were the contents
of that Commission that the Father delivered him thus Sealed. And knowing that
there could be no reversing of it afterward.

Oh then, love the Lord Jesus all ye his Saints, for still you see more and
more of his love breaking out upon you. I commend to you a Sealed Savior this
day; O that every one that reads these lines might in a pang of Love, cry out
with the enamored Spouse, Cant. 8.6. Set me as a Seal upon thy heart, as a Seal
upon thy arm, for Love is strong as Death; Jealousy is cruel as the Grave; the
coals thereof are coals of fire, which have a vehement flame.

Inference 6.
Once more, Infer. 6.
has God Sealed Christ for you, then draw forth the comfort of his Sealing for
you, and be restless till ye also be Sealed by him.

First, Draw out the comfort of Christ's Sealing for you. Remember that hereby
God stands engaged, even by his own Seal, to allow and confirm, what ever
Christ has done in the business of your Salvation. And on this ground you may
thus plead with God. Lord, thou have Sealed Christ to this Office, and
therefore I depend upon it; that thou allowest all that he has done, and all
that he has suffered for me, and wilt make good all that he has promised me.
If men will not deny their own Seals, much less will thou.

Secondly, Get your interest in Christ Sealed to you by the Spirit, else you
cannot have the comfort of Christ's being Sealed for you. Now the Spirit Seals
two ways, Objectively, and Effectually; the first is by working those graces in
us, which are the conditions of the promises. The latter is by shining upon his
own Work, and helping the Soul to discern it. Which follows the other both in
order of nature, and of time. And these Sealings of the Spirit are to be
distinguished both ex parti Subjecti, by their Subject, or the quality of the
Person Sealed, which always is a Believer, Ephesians. 1.13. For there can be no
reflex, till there have been a Direct Act of Faith. Ex part materiae. By the
matter of which that comfort is made. Which if it be of the Spirit, is ever
consonant to the written Word, Isa. 8.20. And partly ab effectis, by its
effects, for it commonly produces in the Sealed Soul, great care, and caution
to avoid Sin, Ephesians. 4.30. Great Love to God, Ioh. 14.22. Readiness to suffer any
thing for Christ, Romans 5.3, 4, 5. Confidence in addresses to God, 1 Ioh. 5.13,
14. And great Humility and Self-abasement. As in Abraham, who lay on his face,
when God Sealed the Covenant to him, Genesis 17.1, 2, 3. This, O this brings home
the sweet, and good of all, when this Seal is superaded to that.

The SEVENTH Sermon. 7.
SERMON. Treats of the Solemn consecration of the Mediator.

JOH. XVII.XIX. And for their Sakes I sanctify my Self.


JESUS CHRIST being fited with a Body, and authorized by a Commission; now
actually devotes, and sets himself apart to his Work. In the former Sermon, you
heard what the Father did, in this, you shall hear what the Son has done,
toward the Fathers advancement of that glorious design of our Salvation. He
sanctified himself, for our Sakes. Wherein observe (1.) Christ's sanctifying of
himself, (2.) the end or design of his so doing.

First, You have Christ's sanctifying of himself. The word

Sanctificare est in usus divinos sep^rare.

Brentius in loc.


First, His Separation, or setting apart to be an oblation or Sacrifice. So Beza
nempe ut sacerd^s and victima. As the Priest, and Sacrifice. I sanctify my
self, imports

Secondly, His Consecration, or Dedication of himself to this holy use and
service. So the Dutch Annotations I sanctify my self (i. e.) I give up my self
for an holy Sacrifice. And so our English Annotations. I Sanctify (i. e.) I
Consecrate, and voluntarily offer my self, an holy and unblemished Sacrifice to
thee, for their Redemption. So that as under the Law, when any day, person, or
vessel was consecrated and dedicated to the Lord, it was so entirely for his
use and service, that to use it afterward in any common service was to profane
it, and polute it. As you see Dan. 5.3.

for their Sakes. Est igitur s^^^us ego sanctifi o meips^^^ (i. e.) morior pro
ipsis, ut ipsi per mortem ^^cam spiritu sanctitatis impleantur, and fiant
sancta d^i vasa, per revela^um d^i spi itum Ma^lorat in loc.
And that they might be Sanctified] where you have the finis eujus, the end for
whom, for their (i. e.) for the Elect sake. For them whom thou gave me. And
the finis cui, the the end for which, that they might be sanctified. Where you
also see that the death of Christ wholly respects us. He offered not for
himself, as other Priests did, but for us: that we may be sanctified. Christ is
so in love with holiness, that at the price of his blood, he will buy it for
us. Hence the Observation is.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ did dedicate and wholly set himself apart, to the Work
of a Mediator, for the Elect sake.
Doct.
This point is a glass, wherein the eye of your Faith may see Jesus Christ
preparing himself, to be offered up to God for us. Fitting himself to die. And
to keep a clear Method, I shall open these two things in the doctrinal part,
first, what his sanctifying himself implys. Secondly, how it respects us.

I sanctify my self. And there are seven things carried in it.

First, This phrase, [ I sanctify my self] implys the personal union of the
two natures in Christ. For what is that which he here calls himself, but the
same that was consecrated to be a Sacrifice; even his humane nature? This was
the sacrifice. And this also was himself. So the Apostle speaks, Heb. 9.14. He
through the eternal Spirit, offered up himself to God, without Spot. So that
our nature by that assumption, is become himself. Greater honor cannot be done
it. Or a greater ground of comfort proposed to us. But having spoken of that
union in the former Sermon, I shall remit the Reader thither.

Secondly, This sanctifying or consecrating himself to be a Sacrifice for us,
implys the greatness and dreadfulne^s of that breach which sin made betwixt God
and us. You see no less Sacrifice than Christ himself, must be sanctified, to
make atonement. Judge of the greatness of the wound, by the breadth of the
plaster. Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt offering for sin, thou would
not, but a body have thou prepared me, Heb. 10.5. All our repentance, could we
shed as many tears for Sin, as there have fallen drops of rain, Since the
Creation, could not have been our atonement: but God was in Christ reconciling
the world to himself. And had he not sanctified Christ to this end, he would
have sanctified himself upon us, in Judgment, and fury for ever.

Thirdly, This his sanctifying himself, implys his free and voluntary
undertakement of the Work. It is not I am sanctified, as if he he had been
merely passive in it; as the Lambs that typed him out were, (...).
when plucked from the fold: but it is an active verb that he uses here, I
sanctify my self, he would have none think that he dyed out of a necessity of
compulsion, but out of choice. Therefore he is said to offer up himself to God,
Heb. 9.14. And in Ioh. 10.18. I lay down my life of my self, no man takes it
from me. And although it is often said his Father sent him, and gave him; yet
his heart was as much set on that work, as if there had been nothing but glory,
ease, and comfort in it. he was under no constraint, but that of his own Love.
Therefore as when the Scripture would set forth the willingness of the Father
to this work, it says God sent his Son, and God gave his Son; so when it would
set forth Christ's willingness to it: it says, he offered up himself, gave
himself, and here in the Text sanctified himself. The sacrifice that strugled,
and came not without force to the Altar, was reckoned ominous, and unlucky by
the Heathen; our sacrifice dedicated himself. He dyed out of choice. And was a
free will offering.

Fourthly, His sanctifying himself implys his pure and perfect holiness. That
he had no Spot or blemish in him. Those beasts that prefigured him, were to be
without blemish. And none else were consecrated to that Service. So, and more
than so it behoved Christ to be, Heb. 7.26. Such an High Priest became us as is
holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from Sinners. And what it became him to be,
he was. Therefore in allusion to the Lambs offered under the Law, the Apostle
calls him, a Lamb without blemish, or Spot, 1 Pet. 1.19. Every other man has a
double Spot upon him, the heart Spot, and the life Spot. The Spot of original,
and the Spots of actual Sins. But Christ was without either. He had not the
Spot of original Sin, for he was not by man. He came in a peculiar way into the
world, and so escaped that. Not yet of actual sins, for as his nature, so his
life was Spotless, and pure, Isa. 53.9. He did no iniquity. And though he was
tempted to sin, externally, yet he was never defiled in heart, or practice. He
came as near it as he could come for our sakes, yet still without sin, Heb. 4
15. If he sanctify himself for a Sacrifice, he must be such as the Law
required, pure, and spotless.

Fifthly, His sanctifying himself for our sakes speaks the strength of his
Love, and largeness of his heart to poor sinners, thus to set himself wholly
and entirely apart for us. So that what he did, and suffered, must all of it
have a respect and relation to us. He did not (when consecrated for us) live a
moment, do an act, or speak a word; but it had some tendency to promote the
great design of our Salvation. He was only, and wholly, and always doing your
work, when consecrated for your sakes. His Incarnation respects you, Esa. 9.6.
For us a Child is born, to us a Son is given. And he would never have been the
Son of man, but to make you the Sons and Daughters of God. God would not have
come down in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the habit of a man, but to raise
up sinful man into the likeness of God. All the miracles he wrought were for
you, to confirm your Faith. When he raised up Lazarus, Joh. 11.42. Because of
the people which stand by, I said it: that they might believe that thou have
sent me. While he lived on earth, he lived as one wholly set apart for us. And
when he dyed, he dyed for us, Gal. 3.13. He was made a curse for us. When he
hanged on that cursed tree he hanged there in our room, and did but fill our
place. When he was buried, he was buried for us. For the end of it was, to
perfume our Graves, against we come to lie down in them. And when he rose
again, it was (as the Apostle says) for our Justification, Romans 4.25. When he
ascended into glory, he protested it was about our business. That he went to
prepare places for us. And if it had not been so, he would have told us, Ioh.
14.2. And now he is there, it is for us that he there lives. For he ever lives
to make intercession for us, Heb. 7.25. And when he shall return again to Judge
the world, he will come for us too. He comes (when ever it be) to be glorified
in his Saints, and admired in them that believe, 2 These. 1.10. He comes to
gather his Saints home to himself, that where he is, there they all may be, in
Soul, and Body with him for ever. Thus you see how, as his Consecration for us
does speak him set a part for our use; so he did wholly bestow himself, time,
life, death, and all upon us. Living, and Dying for no other end, but to
accomplish this great work of Salvation for us.

Sixthly, His sanctifying himself for us, plainly speaks the Vicegerency of his
death, that it was in our room or stead. When the Priest Consecrated the
Sacrifice, it was set apart for the people. So it is said of the escape Goat, And
Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live Goat, and confess over
him all the iniquities of the Children of Israel; and all their transgressions,
in all their sins: putting them upon the head of the Goat. And shall send him
away by the hand of a fit man, into the Wilderness, Levit. 16.21. Thus Isa.
53.6.7. He stood in our room, to bear our burden.. And as Aaron laid the
iniquities of the people upon the Goat, so were ours laid on Christ. It was
said to him in that day, on thee be their Pride, their Unbelief, their hardness
of heart, their vain thoughts, their earthly mindedness, etc. Thou art
Consecrated for them, to be the Sacrifice in their room. His death was in our
stead, as well as for our good. And so much his sanctifying himself [for us]
imports.

Seventhly, His sanctifying himself, imports the extraordinariness of his
Person. For it speaks him to be both Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar all in one. A
thing unheard of in the world before. So that his name might well be called
wonderful. I sanctify my self. I sanctify, according to both natures. My
self, that is my humane nature; which was the Sacrifice, upon the Altar of my
Divine nature. For it is the Altar that sanctifies the gift. As the three
offices never met in one Person before, so these three things never met in one
Priest before. The Priests indeed Consecrated the bodies of Beasts for
Sacrifice; but never offered up their own Souls, and Bodies as a whole burnt
offering, as Christ did. And thus you have the import of this phrase, I
sanctify my self for their sake.

Cor. 5.7. Christ our Passover is Sacrificed for us, Ephesians. 5.2. He loved the
Church, and gave himself for it. See Tit. 2.14. This will be made out by a
three fold consideration of Christ's Death, And First, Let it he considered,
that he was not offered up to God for his own Sins. For he was most holy, Isa
53.9. No iniquity was found in him. Indeed the Priests under the Law, offered
for themselves as well as the people: But Christ did not do so, Heb. 7.27. He
need not daily as those Highpriests, to offer up Sacrifice, first for his own
Sins, and then for the peoples. And indeed had he been a sinner, what value or
efficacy could have been in his Sacrifice? He could not have been the
Sacrifice, but would have needed one. Now if Christ were most holy, and yet put
to death, and cruel sufferings: either his Death and sufferings must be an act
of injustice, and cruelty: or it must respect others, whose persons and cause
he sustained in that suffering capacity. He could never have suffered or dyed
by the Fathers hand, had he not been a sinner by imputation. And in that
respect (as Luther speaks) he was the greatest of sinners. Or as the Prophet
Isaiah speaks, all our sins were made to meet upon him. Not that he was so
intrinsecally, but was made so; sc. by imputation. As is clear from 2 Cor.
5.21. He was made sin for us, that had no sin. So that hence it is evident, that
Christ's Death or Sacrifice is wholly a respective, or relative thing. Secondly,
It is not to be forgotten here, that the Scriptures frequently call the death
of Christ a price, (...) (i. e.) praetium ex adverse respondens.
1 Cor. 6.20. And a ransom, Matthew. 20.28. Or counterprice. To whom then does it
relate, but to them that were and are in bondage and captivity? If it were to
redeem any, it must be captives: but Christ himself was never in Captivity. He
was always in his Fathers bosom, as you have heard; but we were in cruel
bondage, and thraldom under the Tyranny of sin, and Satan. And it is we only
that have the benefit of this ransom. Thirdly, Either the death of Christ must
relate to believers, or else he must die in vain. As for the Angels, those that
stood in their integrity needed no Sacrifice; and those that fell are totally
excluded from any benefit by it. He is not a Mediator for them. And among men
that have need of it, unbelievers have no share in it. They reject it. Such
have no part in it. If then he neither dyed for himself, as I proved before,
nor for Angels, nor unbelievers: either his blood must be shed with respect to
believers, or which is most absurd, and never to be imagined, shed as water
upon the ground, and totally cast away. So that you see by all this it was for
our Sakes (as the Text speaks) that he sanctified himself. And now we may say
Lord, the Condemnation was thine, that the Justification might be mine. The
Agony thine, that the Victory might be mine. The Pain was thine, and the Ease
mine. The Stripes thine, and the Healing Balm issuing from them mine. The
Vinegar and Gall was thine, that the Honey and Sweet might be mine. The Curse
was thine, that the Blessing might be mine. The Crown of Thorns was thine, that
the Crown of Glory might be mine. The Death was thine, the Life purchased by it
mine. Thou payedst the Price, that I might enjoy the Inheritance.


We come next to the Inferences of truth, deducible from this point. Which
follow,

Inference 1.
If Jesus Christ did wholly set himself apart for believers, Infer. 1.
How reasonable is it, that believers should Consecrate and set themselves
apart wholly for Christ! Is he all for us, and shall we be nothing for him?
What he was, he was for you. What ever he did, was done for you. And all that
he suffered, Synechdoche hebraica, pro vos totos. Sic Pareus in loc.
was suffered for you; Oh then, I beseech you Brethren by the mercys of God,
present your Bodies (i. e. your whole selves, for so body is there
Synechdochically put to signify the whole person) I say present your bodies, a
living Sacrifice, holy acceptable to God; which is your reasonable Service,
Romans 12.1. As your good was Christ's end, so let his glory be your end. Let
Christ be the end of your conversation, Heb. 13.7. As Christ could say to me to
live, is you; So, do you say for us to live is Christ, Phil. 1.21. O that all
who profess Faith in Christ, could subscribe Cordially to that profession, Romans
14.8. None of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself, but whether we
live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to to the Lord: so then
whether we live or die, we are the Lords. This is to be a Christian indeed.
What is a Christian, but an holy dedicated thing to the Lord? And what greater
evidence can there be that Christ set himself apart for you, than your setting
your selves apart for him?

This is the marriage Covenant, Hos. 3.3. Thou shall be for me, and not for
another, so will I be for thee. Ah what a life is the life of a Christian!
Christ all for you, and you all for him. Blessed exchange! Soul (says Christ,)
all I have is thine. Lord, (says the Soul) and all I have, is thine. Soul
(says Christ) my person is wonderful, but what I am, I am for thee. My life
was spent in labor, and travel; but I lived for thee. And Lord (says the
believer) my person is vile, and not worth thy accepting, but such as it is
it is thine, my Soul, with all and every faculty; my body, and every member of
it, my gifts, time, and all my Talents are thine.

And see that as Christ bequeathed and made over himself to you, so ye in the
like manner bestow and make over your selves to him. He lived not, neither dyed
(as you hear) for himself, but you. O that you in like manner would down with
self, and up with Christ, in the room of it. Woe, woe, is me (says one) that
the holy profession of Christ is made a stag^e garment by many to bring home a
vain fame. And Christ is made to serve men's ends. This is to stop an Oven with
a Kings Robes. Except men Martyr and slay the body of sin in sanctified
self-denial, they shall never be Christ's Martyrs and faithful Witnesses. Oh, if
I could be master of that house-Idol my self. Mine own. Mine own wit, will,
credit, and ease, how blessed were I! O but we have need to be redeemed from
our selves, rather than from the Devil and the world. Learn to put out your
selves, and to put in Christ for your selves. I should make a sweet bargain,
and give old for new, if I could shuffle out Self, and substitute Christ my
Lord in place of my self, to say, not I, but Christ, not my will, but Christ's,
not my ease, not my lusts, not my credit but Christ, Christ. -- O wretched Idol
my self, when shall I see thee wholly decourted, and Christ wholly put in thy
Room? O if Christ had the full place and Room of my self, that all my aims,
purposes, thoughts and desires would coast and land upon Christ, and not upon
my self.

He set himself apart for you Believers, and no others. No, not for Angels; but
for you, will ye also set your selves apart peculiarly for Christ? be his, and
no others. Let not Christ and the world share and divide your Hearts, in two
halves betwixt them; let not the world step in and say, half mine. You will
never do Christ right, nor answer this Grace, till you can say as it is, Psalm.
73.25. whom have I in Heaven but thee? and on Earth there is none that I desire
in comparison of thee. None but Christ, none but Christ is a proper Motto for a
Christian.

He left the highest and best enjoyments even those in his Fathers bosom, to
set himself apart for Death and sufferings for you; are you ready to leave the
bosom of the best and sweetest enjoyments you have in this world, to serve him?
if you stand not habitually ready to leave Father, Mother, Wife, Children,
Lands, yea, and life too, to serve him: You are not worthy of him, Mat. 10.37.

He was so wholly given up to your service, that he refused not the worst and
hardest part of it; even bleeding, groaning, dying work, his love to you
sweetened all this to him: can you say so too? do you account the reproaches of
Christ, greater riches than the Treasures of Egypt, as Moses did, Heb. 11.26.

He had so entirely devoted himself to your work, that he could not be at rest
till it was finished. He was so intent upon it, that he forgot to eat Bread.
Joh. 4.31, 32. so it should be with you. His service should be Meat and Drink
to you; to conclude,

He was so wholly given up to your work and service, that he would not suffer
himself to be in the least diverted, or taken off from it. And if Peter himself
counsel him to favor himself; he shall hear, get thee behind me Satan. Oh
happy were it if our Hearts were but so engaged for Christ. In Gallens time it
was proverbial, when they would express the impossibility of a thing. You may
as soon take off a Christian from Christ. Thus you see what use you should make
of Christ's sanctifying himself for you.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
If Christ have sanctified or consecrated himself for us, learn hence what an
horrid evil it is to use Christ, or his Blood, as a common, and unsanctified
thing. Yet so some do as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 10.29. The Apostate is said
to tread upon the Son of God, as if he were no better than the dirt under his
Feet, and to count his Blood an unholy (or common) thing. But woe to them that
so do, they shall be counted worthy of something worse then dying without
mercy. As the Apostle there speaks.

And as this is the Sin of the Apostate, so is it also the Sin of all those
that without Faith approach, and so profane the Table of the Lord,
unbeleivingly and unworthily handling those awful things. Such eat and drink
judgment to themselves, not discerning the Lords Body, 1 Cor. 11.29. Whereas
the body of Christ was a thing of the deepest sanctification that ever God
created. Sanctified (as the Text tells us) to a far more excellent and glorious
purpose, than ever any Creature in Heaven or Earth was sanctified. It was
therefore the great sin of those Corinthians, not to discern it; and not to
behave themselves toward it, when they saw and handled the signs of it, as so
holy a thing.

And as it was their great Sin, so God declared his just indignation against
it, in those sore strokes inflicted for it. As they discerned not the Lords
body, so neither did the Lord discern their bodies from others, in the
judgments that were inflicted. And as one well observes God drew the Model and
Platform of their punishment, from the structure and proportion of their sin.
And truly, if the moral and spiritual Seeds and originals of many of our
outward afflictions and sicknesses were but duly sifted out, possibly we might
find a great part of them, in the Bowels of this sin.

The just and righteous God, will build up the breaches we make upon the honor
of his Son, with the ruins of that beauty, strength and honor which he has
given our Bodies. O then, when you draw nigh to God in that ordinance, take
heed to sanctify his name, by a spiritual discerning of this most holy, and
most deeply sanctified Body of the Lord. Sanctified beyond all Creatures,
Angels or Men, not only in respect of the Spirit which filled him without
measure, with inherent holiness; but also in respect of its dedication to such
a service as this. It being set apart by him, to such holy solemn ends, and
uses: as you have heard.

And let it for ever be a warning to such as have lifted up their hands to
Christ in an holy profession, that they never lift up their Heel against him
afterward by Apostasy. The Apostate treads on Gods dear Son, and God will
tread upon him for it. Thou have trodden down all that err from thy Statutes,
Psalm. 119.118.

Inference 3.
What a choice pattern of love to the Saints, Infer. 3.
have we here before us! calling all that are in Christ, to an imitation of
him. Even to give our selves up to their service, as Christ did. Not in the
same kind, so none can give himself for them; but as we are capable. You see
here how his Heart was affected to them, that he would sanctify himself as a
Sacrifice for them. See to what a height of duty the Apostle improves this
example of Christ, 1 Ioh. 3.16. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he
laid down his life for us; and we ought also to lay down our lives for the
Brethren. Some Christians came up fairly to this pattern, in the Primitive
times. Priscila and Aquila, laid down their Necks for Paul, Romans 16.4. (i. e.)
eminently hazarded their lives for him; and even he himself could rejoice if he
were offered up upon the Sacrifice and service of their Faith, Phil. 2.17. And
in the next times, what more known, even to the Enemies of Christianity, than
their fervent love one to another? Ecce quam mutuo se deligunt, and mori volunt
pro alterutris. See how they love one another, and are willing to dye one for
another.

But alas, that Primitive Spirit is almost lost in this degenerate Age. Instead
of laying down life, how few will lay down twelve pence for them. I remember
it is the observation of a late Worthy upon, Matthew. 95.40. that he is persuaded
there is hardly that man to be found this day alive, that fully understands,
and fully believes that Scripture. O did men think what they do for them, is
done for Christ himself, it would produce other effects, than are yet visible.

Inference 4.
Lastly, if Christ sanctified himself, that we might be s^nctied by [or in] the
truth, Infer. 4.
then it will follow by found consequence, that true sanctification is a good
evidence that Christ set apart himself to dye for us. In vain did he ^anctifie
himself (as to you) unless you be sanctified. N^que enim sic sanctifi^avi^
semeti^sum Christus pro nobis, ut nos maneamus pro^ani; and alieni a communion^
spiritus, and sanctificationis illius.

Qui illiuss^^t expertes, frustra sibi comm^rcium Christi pollicentu^, Musculus
in loc.


Holy Souls only can claim the benefit of the great Sacrifice. O try then,
whether true holiness (and that is only to be judged by its conformity to its
pattern, 1 Pet. 1.15. As he that called you is holy, so be ye holy) whether
such an holiness as is, and acts (according to its measure) like Gods holiness;
in the following perticulars, be ^ound in you.

First, God is universally holy in all his ways, so Psalm. 145.17. His works are
all holy; what ever he does, it is still done as becomes an holy God. He is not
only holy in all things, but at all times unchangeably holy. Be ye therefore
holy in all things, and at all times too, if ever ye expect the benefit of
Christ's sanctifying himself, to dye for you.

O Brethren, let not the Feet of your conversation be as the Feet of a lame
man; which are unequal, Prove. 20.7. be not sometimes hot, and sometimes cold,
at one time careful, at another time careless. One day in a spiritual rapture,
and the next, in a fleshly frolic; but be ye holy (...) 1 Pet. 1.15. in all
manner of conversation, in every creek, and turning of your lives; And let your
holiness hold out to the end. Let him that is holy, be holy still, Rev. 22.11.
not like the Hypocrites paint but as a true natural complexion.

Secondly, God is examplarily holy. Jesus Christ is the great pattern of
holiness. Be ye examples of holiness too, unto all that are about you. Let your
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, Matthew. 5.16. as
wicked men infect one another by their examples, and diffuse their poison and
malignity wherever they come, so do ye diffeminate godliness in all places,
and companies; and let those that frequently converse with you; especially
those of your own Families, receive a deeper Dye and Tincture of heavenlyness,
every time they come nigh you, as the cloth does, by every new dipping into the
Fat.

Thirdly, God delights in nothing but holiness, and holy ones, he has set all
his pleasure in the Saints. Be ye holy herein, as God is holy. Indeed there is
this difference betwixt Gods choice, and yours. He chooses not men because they
are holy, but that they may be so. You are to choose them for so your delightful
Companions, that God has chosen, and made holy. Let all your delights be in
the Saints, even them that excel in virtue, Psalm. 16.3.

Fourthly, God abhors and hates all unholiness: do ye so also, that you may be
like your Father, which is in Heaven. And when the Spirit of holiness runs down
thus upon you, a sweeter evidence the World cannot give, that Christ was
sanctified for you. Holy ones may confidently lay the hand of their Faith, on
the head of this great Sacrifice; and say Christ our Passover, is sacrificed
for us.

Sermon. 8.
The EIGHTH SERMON. Gives an account of the nature of Christ's mediation.

I TIM. II.V. And one Mediator betwixt God, and Men; the man Christ Jesus.


God is most holy, Man a lump of iniquity; extremes meet not, but by their
middle. Sinful man can never have communion with, or enjoyment of God, but in,
and by a Mediator.
GReat and long preparations bespeak the solemnity and greatness of the work,
for which they are designed. A man that had but seen the heaps of Gold, Silver,
and Brass which David amassed in his time, for the building of the Temple,
might easily conclude before one Stone of it was laid, that it would be a
magnificent Structure. But lo here is a design of God, as far transcending
that, as the substance does the shadow. For indeed that glorious Temple was but
the Type, and Figure of Jesus Christ, Ioh. 2.19.21. and a weak adumbration of
that living spiritual Temple, which he was to build: cementing the lively
Stones thereof together with his own blood, 1 Pet. 2.5, 6. that the great God
might dwell and walk in it, 2 Cor. 6.16. the preparations for that Temple were
but of few years, but the consultations and preparations for this, were from
Eternity, Prove. 8.31. and as there were preparations for this work, (which
Christ dispatched in a few years) before the world began; so it will be matter
of eternal admiration and praise, when this world shall be dissolved. What this
astonishing glorious work is, this Text will inform you, as to the general
nature of it. It is the work of mediation betwixt God, and Man; managed by the
sole hand of the man Christ Jesus.

In this Scripture (for I shall not spend time to examine the words in their
contexture) you have a description of Jesus the Mediator, and he is here
described three ways, viz. by his work or office, a Mediator, by the
singularity of his mediation, one Mediator. And by the nature and quality of
his Person, employed in this singular way of Mediation the man, and lastly his
name's Jesus Christ.

First, he is described by the work, or office he is employed about, A
days-man, to lay his hand upon both; to arbitrate, and award justly: and give
God his due, and that without ruin to poor man.

Secondly, he is described by the singularity of his mediation. One Mediator,
and but one, though there be many Mediators of reconciliation among men, and
many Intercessors in a petitionary way, betwixt God and Men; yet but (...), one
only Mediator of reconciliation betwixt God and Men, and it is as needless, and
impious to make more Mediators than one, as to make more Gods than one. There
is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and Men.

Thirdly, he is described by the nature and quality of his Person, the man
Christ Jesus. This description of him by one nature, and that the humane nature
also, (wherein as you shall see anon, the Lord especially consulted our
encouragement and Comfort) I say his being so described to us, Cur quaso
addidid bomo? nisi ad exprimeadam naturam, secundum quam Christus est mediator?
Bella de Christo med. lib. 5. cap 3. Tom. 2.
has through the corruption of men; been improved to the great dishonor of
Jesus Christ, both by the Arrians and Papists. The former took occasion from
hence, to affirm that he was but (...) a mere man. The latter allow him to be
the true God, but on this weak ground affirm, that he performed not the work of
mediation as God, but only a man. Thus what the Spirit ordered for our comfort,
is wickedly retorted to Christ's dishonor. For I doubt not but he is described
by his humane nature in this place, not only because in this nature he paid
that ransom; (which he speaks of in the words immediately following) but
especially for the drawing of Sinners to him; seeing he is the man Christ
Jesus. One that clothed himself in their own Flesh; and to encourage the Faith
of Believers, that he tenderly resents all their wants, and miseries; and that
they may safely trust him with all their concerns, as one that will carefully
mind them as his own, and will be for them a merciful and faithful High Priest,
in things pertaining to God.

Appellative name Christ, and his proper name Jesus. The name Jesus, notes his
work about which he came, In nomine Jesus totum latet evangelium hoc nomen est
luxcibus, and medicina animae, S. Glassius.
and Christ the Offices to which he was anointed; and in the execution of which
he is our Jesus. In the name Jesus the whole Gospel is hid. It is the light,
the food, the medicine of the Soul, as one speaks. The note from hence is.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ is the true and only Mediator betwixt God and Men.
Ye are come to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, Heb. 12.24. And for
this cause he is the Mediator of the new Testament etc. Heb. 9.14. I might show
you a whole vein of Scriptures running this way, but to keep a profitable and
clear method, I shall show you.

First, what is the sense of this word (...), a Mediator.

Secondly, what it implys, as it is applied to Christ.

Thirdly, how it appears that he is the true and only Mediator, betwixt God and
Men.

Fourthly, in what capacity he performed his Mediatory work,

Mediator, and the true sense and importance of it, Vocamus mediatorem ^um qui
inter aliquos diledentes aut certe non conjunctos medium se interpo^it ut cos
redigot ad uncordiam, vel novo foedere conjungat.
is a middle person, or one that interposes betwixt two Parties at variance, to
make peace betwixt them. So that Satan is medium disjungens, a medium of
discord; so Christ is medium conjungens, a medium of Concord and Peace. And he
is such a middler, both in respect of his person, and office, in respect of his
person, he is a middler, Nom^n media to is in sud propria significatione con
est nomen substantie, sed muceris, and officii substantia igitur and operatio,
non co^stituunt duo gene^a mediationis sed unum and idem. Dr. Ames Bellarm lib.
5. p. 117. Mediator dicitu Christus, tun qua medius, tum quam media^s, medius
persona, medians, officio, Trelcot. Justit. p. 78.
that is one that has the same nature both with God, and us, true God, and
true man, and in respect of his office or work, which is to interpose or
transact the business of reconciliation between us and God. The former some
call his substantial, the latter his evergitical or operative meditation,
though I rather conceive that which is called his substantial mediation, is but
the aptitude of his person to execute the mediatorial function. And that it
does not constitute two kinds of mediation, his being a middle Person, fits and
capacitates him to stand in the midst, betwixt God, and us. This I say is the
proper sense of the word. Though (...), a Mediator be rendered variously.
Sometimes an Umpire, or Arbitrator. Sometimes a Messenger, that goes betwixt
two Persons. Sometimes an Interpreter, imparting the mind of one, to another.
Sometimes a Reconciler, or Peacemaker. And in all these senses Christ is the
(...) the middle Person, in his mediation of reconciliation, o^ intercession,
that is, either in his mediating by suffering, to make peace, as he did on
Earth; or to continue, and maintain peace: as he does in Heaven, by meritorious
intercession. Both these ways he is the only Mediator, and he manageth this his
mediation.

First, As an Vmpire or Arbitrator. One that lays his hands upon both
Parties, (...) Sequester, Arbiter, Interpreter, Conciliator.
as Job speaks Job. 9.33. so does Christ, he lays his hands (speaking after
the manner of men,) upon God, and says, Father, will thou be at peace with
them and readmit them into thy favor? If thou will, thou shall be fully
satisfied for all that they have done against thee. And then he lays his hand
upon man, and says, poor sinner, be not discouraged; thou shall be justified,
and saved.

Secondly, As a Messenger, or Ambassador, so he came to impart the mind of God
to us, and so he presents our desires to God. And in this sense only Socinus
would allow Christ to be Mediator. But therein he endeavors to undermine the
Foundation, and to exclude him from being a Mediator by suretyship. Which is the

Third way of this mediation. So the Apostles speaks Heb. 7. he is (...), (...)
est sponso^, fidejussiot, praes, a (...); manus; and (...) quasi (...) i^
manibus, vel ut suidas (...) vel (...) terra, quae est fi^ma, stabilis,
immobilis.
the surety, or pledge. Which as the learned* David Pareus well expresses it,
is one that engages to satisfy another, or gives caution or security by a
Pledge in the hand, for it. And indeed both these ways Christ is our Mediator
by suretyship, viz. in a way of satisfaction, coming under our obligation to
answer the Law, this he did on the Cross, and in a way of caution. A surety for
the peace, or good behavior, but to be more explicit, and clear; I shall

In the next place enquire, what it implys and carries in it, First, At the
first sight, it carries in it a most dreadful breach and jar betwixt God and
Men, else no need of a Mediator of Reconciliation. There was indeed a sweet
League of amity once between them, but it was quickly dissolved by sin, the
wrath of the Lord was kindled against man, pursuing him to destruction, Psalm.
5.5. thou hate all the works of iniquity. And man was filled with unnatural
enmity against his God, Romans 1.30. (...), haters of God. This put an end to all
friendly commerce, and intercourse between him and God. Reader, say not in thy
heart; that it is much one sin, and that seemingly so small, should make such a
breach as this: And cause the God of mercy and goodness, so to abhor the works
of his hands; and that as soon as he had made man: for it was an heinous, and
aggravated evil. It was upright, perfect man; created in the Image of of God,
that thus sinned. He sinned when his mind was most bright, clear, and
apprehensive. His Conscience pure and active. His Will free, and able to
withstand any temptation. His Conscience pure, and undefiled. Yea he was a
Public, as as well as perfect man, and well knew that the happiness, or
misery of his numberless offspring was involved in him.

The condition he was placed in, was exceeding happy. No necessity, or want
could arm and edge a temptation. He lived amidst all natural, and spiritual
pleasures, and delights; the Lord most delightfully conversing with him. Yea,
he sinned while as yet his Creation-mercy was fresh upon him, and in this sin
was most horrible ingratitude, yea, a casting off the yoke of obedience, almost
as soon as God had put it on. God now saw the work of his hands spoiled, a race
of Rebels now to be propagated, who in their successive Generations would be
fighting against God. He saw it, and his just indignation sparkled against man,
and resolves to pursue him, to the bottom of Hell.

Secondly, it implys a necessity of satisfaction and reparation to the Justice
of God. For the very design, and end of this mediation, was to make Peace by
giving full satisfaction, to the party that was wronged. The Photinians, and
some others have dreamed of a reconciliation with God; De absoluta enim
bonitate, and voluntate salvandi, scriptura magis muta est quam Piscis.
Dieteric.

His po^itis sequitur dei neque naturam, neque justitiam summam pati, ut l^gis
transgressio ulla, sine compensatione-justa dimittatur, Bradshaw de Justific.
p. 68.

Nec in bonitate misericordiae perdit judicii severitatem; nec in judicando cum
severitate amittit misericordiae bonit^tem, Aug. in ps. 100.


founded not upon satisfaction; but upon the absolute mercy, goodness, and
free will of God. But conceiving that absolute goodness and mercy of God,
reconciling sinners to himself, there is a deep silence throughout the
Scriptures. And whatever is spoken of it upon that account, is as it works to
us, through Christ, Ephesians, 1.3, 4, 5. Acts 4.12. Ioh. 6.40. and we cannot
imagine, either how God could exercise mercy to the prejudice of his Justice,
which must be, if we must be reconciled without full satisfaction; or how such
a full satisfaction should be made by any other than Christ. Mercy indeed moved
in the Heart of God to poor man, but from his heart, it found no way to vent it
self for us, but through the Heart Blood of Jesus Christ. And in him the
Justice of God was fully satisfied, and the misery of the Creature fully cured.
And so as Augustine speaks; God neither lost the severity of his Justice, in
the goodness of mercy; nor the goodness of his mercy, in the exactness of his
severity. But if it had been possible God could have found out a way to
reconcile us, without satisfaction; yet it is past doubt now, that he has picht
and fixed on this way. And for any now to imagine to reconcile themselves to
God, by any thing but Faith in the Blood of this Mediator: is not only most
vain in it self, and destructive to the Soul; but most insolently derogatory to
the wisdom and grace of God.

And to such I would say as Tertullian to Marcion whom he calls the Murderer
of Truth; spare the only hope of the whole world. O thou who destroyest the
most necessary glory of our Faith. Parce unicae spei totius orbis, o tu qui
destruis necessarium decus fidei Tertul. lib. de carne Christi.
All that we hope for, is but a Phantasm without this. Peace of Conscience can
be rationally settled on no other Foundation but this. For God having made a
Law to govern man, and this Law violated by man; either the penalty must be
levied on the delinquent, or satisfaction made by his surety. As good no Law,
as no penalty for disobedience; and as good no penalty, as no execution. He
therefore that will be a Mediator of Reconciliation betwixt God and Man, must
bring God a price in his hand; and that adequate to the offense, and wrong done
him: else he will not treat about Peace, and so did our Mediator.

Thirdly, Christ's being a Mediator of reconciliation and intercession implys,
the infinite value of his Blood and sufferings, as that which in it self, was
sufficient to stop the course of Gods Justice; and render him not only
placable, but abundantly satisfied, and well pleased; even with those that
before were Enemies. And so much is said of it, Coll. 1.21. And ye that were
sometime alienated, and Enemies in your minds by wicked works; yet now has he
reconciled, in the body of his Flesh, through death; to present you holy, and
unblameable, and unreproveable in his sight. Surely, that which can cause the
holy God, justly incensed against Sinners, to lay aside all his wrath, and take
an Enemy into his bosom; and establish such an amity as can never more be
broken: but to rest in his love, and to joy over him with singing: as it is
Zeph. 3.17. this must be a most excellent and efficatious thing. Fourthly,
Christ being a Mediator of reconciliation, implys the ardent love, and large
pity that filled his Heart toward poor Sinners. For he does not not only
mediate by way of entreaty, going betwixt both, and persuading and beging
Peace; but he mediates (as you have heard) in the capacity of a surety; by
putting himself under an obligation to satisfy our debts. O how
compassionately did his Heart work toward us, that when he saw the arm of
Justice lifted up to destroy us, would interpose himself, and receive the
stroke, though he knew it would smite him dead. Our Mediator like Jonah his
Type, seeing the stormy Sea of Gods wrath working tempestuously, and ready to
swallow us up: cast in himself, to appease the storm. I remember how much that
noble Act of Marcus Curtius is celebrated in the Roman Story, who being
informed by the Oracle, that the great breach made by the Earthquake, could not
be closed, except something of worth were cast into it; heated with love to the
Commonwealth, he went and cast in himself. This was looked upon as a bold and
brave adventure, but what was this to Christ? Fifthly, Christ being a Mediator
betwixt God and Men implys as the fitness of his Person, so his authoritative
call to undertake it. And indeed the Father, who was the wronged Person, called
him to be the Umpire, and Arbitrator, trusting his honor in his hands. Now
Christ was invested with this office and power, virtually, soon after the
breach was made by Adams fall; for we have the early promise of it, Genesis 3.15.
ever since till his incarnation he was a virtual, and effectual Mediator, and
on that account, he is called the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world,
Rev. 13.8. And actually, from the time of his incarnation. But having discussed
this more largely in a former discourse, I shall dismiss it here, and apply my
self to the third thing proposed, which is.


Thirdly, How it appears that Jesus Christ is the true and only Mediator
betwixt God, and Men? I reply it is manifest he is so.

First, because he, and no other, is revealed to us by God. And if God reveal
him, and no other; we must receive him, and no other as such. Take but two
Scriptures at present, that in 1 Cor. 8.5. the Heathen have many Gods, and many
Lords, (i. e.) many great Gods, supreme powers and ultimate objects of of their
worship; (...). Plutarch.
and lest these great Gods should be defiled by their immediate and unhallowed
approaches to them: they therefore invented Heroes, Demigods, intermediate
Powers, that were to be as Agents, or Lord Mediators betwixt the Gods and them:
to convey their Prayers to the Gods, and the blessings of the Gods back again
to them. But unto us (says he) there is but one God, the Father; of whom are
all things, and we by him, (i. e.) one supreme Essence, the first Spring and
Fountain of blessings; and one Lord, (i. e.) one Mediator, (...). by whom are
all things, (...) (i. e.) Alia cujusquam auctoritas. Per nomen, res ip^a, hic
Christus ipse; (...) (i. e) ^spiam. Neque enim hoc loco coelum opponitur
terrae; quasi in coelo sint alij praeter Christum deprecatores; in terra vero
non item: sed in Heb. est P^ionas^us. Beza in loc.
and we by him. By whom are all things which come from the Father to us, and by
whom are all our addresses to the Father, so Acts 4.12. Neither is there
salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be saved. No other name, (i. e.) no other authority, or
rather no other person authorized under Heaven, (i. e.) in the whole World, for
Heaven is not here opposed to Earth, as though there were other Intercessors in
Heaven besides Christ, no, no, in Heaven and Earth God has given him and none
but him to be our Mediator. One Sun is sufficient for the whole World. And one
Mediator for all men in the world. So that the Scriptures affirm this is he,
and exclude all others.

Secondly, because he and no other is fit for and capable of this Who but he
that has the divine and humane nature united in his single Person, can be a
fit Days-man to lay his hand upon both; who but he that was God, could support
under such sufferings, as were by divine Justice exacted for satisfaction? take
a person of the greatest Spirit, and put him but an hour in the case Christ was
in, when he sweat Blood in the Garden, or uttered that heart rending cry upon
the Cross; and he had melted under it as a moth.

Thirdly, because he is alone sufficient to reconcile the world to God by his
Blood, without accessions from any other. The virtue of his Blood reached back
as far as Adam, and reaches forward to the end of the world: and will be as
fresh, vigorous, and efficatious then, as the first moment it was shed. The Sun
makes day before it actually rise, Sol nondum conspectus, illuminat o^b^^.
and continues day to us sometimes after it is set. So does Christ, who is the
same yesterday, to day, and for ever, so that he is the true and only Mediator
betwixt God and Men. No other is revealed in Scripture. No other sufficient for
it. No other needed beside him.

The last thing to be explained is, in what a capacity he executed his
mediatory work?

Divinitas sine humanitate, and humanitas sine divinitate; non est Mediatrix
sed inter divinitatem solam, et humanitatem fola^; Mediatrix est humana
divinitas, and divina humanitas, Aug. Hom. 2. Appellationes officii competunt
Christo secundum utramque naturam. Ames Belion cap. 5.
About which we affirm according to Scripture, that he performs that work as
God-man in both natures. Papists in denying Christ to act as Mediator according
to his divine nature, do at once spoil the whole mediation of Christ, of all
its efficacy, dignity, and value; which rises from that nature, which they deny
to cooperate, and exert its virtue in his active and passive obedience, They
say the Apostle in my Text, distinguishes the Mediator. from God in saying
there is one God, and one Mediator. Ours aptly reply, that the same Apostle
distinguishes Christ from Man, Gal. 1.1. not by Man but by Jesus Christ. Does
it thence follow, that Christ is not true man? or that according to his divine
nature only, he called Paul. But what need I stay my Reader here: Had not
Christ as Mediator power to lay down his life, and power to take it up again,
Ioh. 10.15, 18. had he not as Mediator, all power in Heaven and Earth to
institute Ordinances; and appoint Officers Matthew. 28.18. to baptize men with
the Holy Ghost and Fire, Matthew. 3.11. to keep those his Father gave him, in
this world, Ioh. 17.12. to raise up the Saints again, in the last day, Ioh.
1.54. are all these, with many more I might name, the effects of the mere
humane nature. Or were they not performed by him, as God-man? and besides how
could he as Mediator, be the object of our Faith; and religious adoration; if
we are not to respect him as God-man? But I long now to be at the Application
of this. And the first inference from it is this.

Inference 1.
That it is a dangerous thing to reject Jesus Christ, Infer. 1.
the only Mediator betwixt God and Men. Alas there is no other interpose, and
skreen thee from the devouring Fire; the everlasting burnings. Oh! it is a
fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. And into his hands you
must needs fall, without an interest in the only Mediator. Which of us can
dwell with devouring Fire, who can endure the everlasting burnings? Esa. 33.14.
you know how they singed and scorched the green Tree, but what would they do to
the dry Tree? Luke 23.31. indeed, if there were another plank to save, after
the Shipwreck, any other way to be reconciled to God, beside Jesus the
Mediator: somewhat might be said to excuse this folly; but you are shut up to
the Faith of Christ, as to your last remedy, Gal. 3.23. You are like starving
Beggars that are come at the last door. O take heed of despising or neglecting
Christ; if so, there is none to interceed with God for you; the breach betwixt
him and you can never be composed. I remember here the words of Eli, to his
profane Sons; who caused men to abhor the offerings of the Lord, 1 Samuel 2.25.
If one man sin against another, the Judge shall Judge him; but if a man sin
against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? the meaning is, in common
trespasses betwixt men, the civil Magistrate takes cognizance of it, and
decides the controversy, Conculcarant sacrificia, leges que omnes divinas,
atque ita quantum in se erat sustulerunte medio omnia praesidia sic Grotius in
loc.
by his authority: so that there is an end of that strife, but if man sin
against the Lord, who shall entreat or arbitrate in that case? Elies Sons had
despised the Lords Sacrifices, which were the sacred Types of Christ, and the
stated way that Men their had to act Faith on the Mediator in. Now (says he)
if a man thus sin against the Lord, by despising Christ, shadowed out in that
way; who shall entreat for him? what hope, what remedy remains?

I remember it was the saying of Luther and he spoke it with deep resentment,
nolo deum absolutum. I will have nothing to do with an absolute God, ( i. e.)
with God without a Mediator. Thus the Devils have to do with God, but will ye
in whose nature Christ is come, put your selves into their state and case? God
forbid.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Hence also be informed, how great an evil it is to join any other Mediators
either of reconciliation, or meritorious intercession with Jesus Christ. O this
is an horrid sin, and that which both pours the greatest contempt upon Christ;
and brings the surest and forest destruction upon the Sinner. I am ashamed my
Pen should English what mine Eyes have seen in the writings of Papists, Ma^iale
Argentin^nse, lib. 1. cap. 4. fol. 13. Vincent Brun. in meditat. fest. B.

ascribing as much, yea more to the mediation of Mary than to Christ, with no
less than blasphemous impudence, thus commenting upon Scripture. What is that
which the Lord says, I have trod the Wine Press alone, and of the People
there was no Man with me? true Lord, there was no man with thee, but there was
a Woman with thee; who received all these wounds in her Heart, which thou
receivedst in thy Body. I will not blot my Paper with more of this, but refer
the learned Reader to the Margent, where he may (if he have a mind to see more)
be informed, not only what blasphemy has dropped from single Pens, but even from
Concels to the reproach of Jesus Christ, and his Blood.

How do they stamp their own sordid works with the peculiar dignity and value
of Christ's Blood: and therein seek to enter at the Gate, which God has shut to
all the World, because Jesus Christ the Prince entered in thereby, Ezekiel. 44.2,
3. He entered into Heaven in a direct mediate way, even in his own name, and for
his own sake; this Gate says the Lord shall be shut to all others. And I wish
men would consider it, and fear lest while they seek entrance into Heaven at
the wrong Door; they do not for ever shut against themselves, the true and only
Door of happiness.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
If Jesus Christ be the only Mediator of reconciliation betwixt God and Men,
then reconciled Souls should thankfully ascribe all the Peace, favor and
comforts they have from God, to their Lord Jesus Christ, when ever you have had
free admission, and sweet entertainment with God, in the more public
ordinances, or private duties of his worship: when ye have had his smiles, his
Seals, and with hearts warmed with comfort, are returning from those duties;
say O my Soul, thou may thank thy good Lord Jesus Christ for all this. Had
not he interposed as a Mediator of reconciliation, I could never have had
access to, or friendly communion with God to all eternity.

Immediately upon Adams sin, the Door of Communion with God was locked; yea
chained up; and no more coming nigh the Lord. Not a Soul could have any access
to him, either in a way of communion in this World, or of enjoyment in that to
come. It was Jesus the Mediator that opened that Door again, and in him it is
that we have boldness, and access with confidence, Ephesians. 3.12. we can now come
to God by a new, and a living way, consecrated for us through the Vayl that is
to say his flesh, Heb. 10.20. the Vayl had a double use, as Christ's flesh
answerably has. It hid the glory of the Sanctum Sanctorum, and also gave
entrance into it. Christ's incarnation rebates the edge of the divine glory and
brightness, that we may be able to bear it, and converse with it, and it gives
admission into it also. O thank your dear Lord Jesus for your present, and your
future Heaven. These are mercies which daily emerge out of the Ocean of Christ's
blood, and come swiming in it to our Doors. Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.

Inference 4.
If Jesus Christ be the true and only Mediator both of reconciliation and
meritorious intercession betwixt God and Men, Infer. 4.
how safe and secure then is the condition and state of Beleivers! Surely as
his mediation by sufferings has fully reconciled, so his mediation by
intercession will everlastingly mantain that state of Peace betwixt them and
God, and prevent all future breaches. Being justified by Faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, Romans 5.1. it is a firm and lasting
peace, and the Mediator that made it, lies as a lidger in Heaven to maintain it
for ever; and prevent new jarrs, Heb. 9.24. there to appear in the presence of
God for us. According to the custom of Princes, and States who being
confederated, have their Agents resident in each others Courts; who upon all
occasions appear in the presence of the Prince; in the name and behalf of
those, whom they represent and negotiate for.

And here it is proper to reflect upon the profound and incomprehensible wisdom
of God, who has made an advantage to us, even out of our sin and misery. Come
see and adore the wisdom of our God, that has so improved, reduced, and
disposed the fall of Adam, as to make a singular advantage thereby, to advance
his offspring to a better State. soelicior Job in sterquilenio ^quam Adamus in
Paridiso.
It was truly said by one of the Ancients upon this account, that Job was an
happier man upon the Dunghill, than Adam was in Paradise. His holiness indeed
was perfect, his happiness very great; but neither of them permanent; and
indefecible, as our happiness by the Mediator is. So that in the same sense,
some Divines call Judas his treason foelix scaelus an happy wickedness; we may
call Adams fall, foelix lapsus an happy fall; because ordered, and overruled
by the wisdom of God, to such an advantage for us. And to that purpose Austin
somewhere sweetly speaks. O quam foeliciter cecidi in Adamo, qui post laps^m,
foe^icivs resurexi i^ Christo! Aug.
Oh how happily did I fall in Adam, who rose again more happily in Christ! thus
did the Lord turn a Poison into an Antidote, thus did that dreadful fall make
way for a more blessed and fixed State. Now we are so confirmed, fixed, and
established by Christ, in the favor of God, that there can be no more such
fatal breaches, and dreadful jarrs, betwixt God and his reconciled ones for
ever. The Bone that is well set is stronger where it is knit, than it was before.
Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
Did Jesus Christ interpose betwixt us and the wrath of God, as a Mediator of
reconciliatiation; did he rather choose to receive the stroke upon himself,
than to see us ruined by it. How well then does it become the People of God, in
a thankful sense of this grace, to interpose themselves betwixt Jesus Christ,
Utinam in me convertant tela; and meo sanguine satientur. Jer. Bonum est mihi,
si dignitur Deus me uti pro clypeo Bern.
and the evils they see like to fall upon his name, and interest in the world.
O that there were but such an heart in the People of God. I remember it is a
saying of Jerome, when he heard the revilings and blasphemings of many, against
Christ, and his precious truths: Oh (said he) that they would turn their
Weapons from Christ to me, and be satisfied with my Blood. And much to the same
sense his that sweet one of Bernard, Oh if I could be a Bridge over the water
for my Lord Jesus to walk upon, and keep his feet dry! Oh if my poor bit of
Heaven could go betwixt my Lord, and blasphemy and dishonor. Said another
Worthy.
Happy were I, if God would vouchsafe to use me as a shield. And David could
say, the Reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me, Psalm. 69.9. ten
thousand of our names are nothing to Christ's name. His name is (...) a worthy
name, and no man that gives up his name as a Shield to Christ, but shall
thereby secure and increase the true honor of it. And though wicked men for
present may bespatter them, yet Jesus Christ will take it out of the dirt (as
one speaks) wipe it clean, and give it us again. O it is the least one can do to
interpose our selves and all that is dear to us, betwixt Jesus Christ and the
wrath of men; when he (as you hear) interposed himself betwixt you, and the
eternal wrath of God.

HAving in the former Discourses shown you the solemn preparations both on the
Fathers part, and on the Sons part, for the blessed design of reconciling us by
the Meritorious mediation of Christ: and given you a general prospect of that
his mediation in the former Sermon, method now requires, that I proceed to show
how he executes this his mediation, in the discharge of his blessed offices of
Prophet, Priest and King.

His Prophetical office consists of two parts, one External, consisting in a
true and full Revelation of the will of God to Men; according to that John
17.6. I have manifested thy name to the men thou gave me. The other in
illuminating the mind, and opening the Heart to receive and embrace that
Doctrine. The first part is contained in the words before us. A Prophet shall
the Lord your God raise up, etc.

Which words are an allegation out of Moses recorded in Deuteronomy. 18.15. and here
by Peter pertinently applied to Christ; to convince the incredulous Jews, that
he is the true, and only Messiah; and the great Prophet of the Church; whose
Doctrine it was highly dangerous to contemn, though out of the mouths of such
(otherwise) contemptible persons as he and John were. And it is well observed by
Calvin, he singles out this Testimony of Moses rather than any other; because
of the great esteem they had for Moses, and his writings beyond any others.
Now, in the words themselves are two general parts.

First, Christ according to his Prophetical office, described. Secondly,
Obedience to him, as such a Prophet strictly enjoined.
First, You have here a description of Christ in his Prophetical A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me. Where
Christ is described.

First, By his Title Prophet and that

Princeps Prophetarum. The Prince of the Prophets, or the great and chief
Shepherd; as he is styled, Heb. 13.10. 1 Pet. 5.4. It belongs to a Prophet to
expound the Law, declare the will of God, and foretell things to come. All these
meet, and that in a singular and eminent manner in Christ, our Prophet, Matthew.
5.21, etc. Ioh. 1.18. 1 Pet. 1.11.

Secondly, He is described by his Type. A Prophet like unto Moses, who therein
Typified and prefigured him. But is it not said of Moses in Deuteronomy. 34.10. Non
Similis, quoad sequentia, nempe familiaritatem cum deo and portenta. Est^^s in
loc.
That there arose not a Proph^t since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord
knew face to face? True, of mere men there never arose so great a Prophet in
Israel, as Moses was; either in respect of his familiarity with God, or of his
miracles which he wrought in the power of God: but Moses himself was but a Star
to this Sun. How ever, in these following particulars Christ was like him. He
was a Prophet that went between God, and the people. Carried Gods mind to them,
and returned theirs to God: they not being able to bear the voice of God
immediately. Qui divi^am illam majestatem e coelo loquentem fo midarent, jam in
assumpta carne de litescentem and similem illis factam, audire non timerent.
Deuteronomy. 18.16.17. According to all that thou desire of the Lord thy God in
Horch, in the day of the Assembly; saying let me not hear again the voice of
the Lord my God; neither let me see this great fire any more, that I dye not.
And upon this their request God makes the Promise which is cited in the Text.
verse. 17, 18. They have well spoken, that which they have spoken; I will raise
them up a Prophet like unto thee, etc. Moses was a very faithful Prophet,
precisely faithful, and exact in all things that God gave him in charge; even
to a pin of the Tabernacle. Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a
Servant: for a Testimony of those things which were to be spoken after: But
Christ as a Son over hi^ own house, Heb. 3.5, 6. Again, Moses confirmed his
Doctrine by miracles, which he wrought in the presence, and to the conviction
of gainsayers. Herein Christ our Prophet is also like unto Moses, who wrought
many, mighty, and uncontrolled miracles, which could not be denied; and by them
confirmed the Gospel which he Preached. Lastly, Moses was that Prophet which
brought Gods Israel out of literal Egypt, and Christ his out of spiritual
Egypt; whereof that bondage was a figure. Thus he is described by his likeness
to Moses, his Type.

Thirdly, He is described by his Stock and Original, from which according to
the flesh, he sprang. I will raise him up from among thy brethren. Of Israel,
as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Romans 9.5. And it is evident that our Lord
sprang out of Judah, Heb. 7.14. He honored that Nation by his Nativity. Thus
the great Prophet is described.

Him shall ye hear in all things, etc. By hearing, understand obedience. So
words of sense are frequently put in Scripture, to signify those affections
that are moved by, and use to follow those senses. And this obedience is
required to be yielded to this Prophet only universally, and under great
penalties. Ipsum audies (i. e.) ipsum solum sic illi servi^s Deuteronomy 6.13.
Exponitur illi soli Matthew. 4.10.
It Is required to be given to him only, for so [Him] in the Text must be
understood, as exclusive of all others. It Is true, we are commanded to obey the
voice of his Ministers, Heb. 13.17. But still it is Christ speaking by them, to
whom we pay our obedience. He that hears you, hears me. We obey them in the
Lord ( i. e.) commanding or forbidding in Christ's name, and authority. So when
God said, Deuteronomy. 6.13. [ thou shall serve Him] Christ expounds it exclusively,
Matthew. 4.10. Him only shall thou serve. He is the only Lord, Jude 4. And
therefore to him only our obedience is required. And as it is due to him only,
so to him universally. Him shall ye hear in all things. His commands are to be
obeyed, not disputed. A Judgment of discretion indeed is allowed to
Christians, to Judge whether it be the will of Christ or no. We must prove what
is that holy, good and acceptable will, Romans 12.2. His Sheep hear his voice,
and a stranger they will not follow: They know his voice, but know not the
voice of strangers, Joh. 10.4, 5. But when his will is understood and known, we
have no liberty of Choice, but are concluded by it, be the Duty commanded never
so difficult, or the sin forbidden never so tempting. And this is also required
severely, under penalty of being destroyed from among the people. And of Gods
requiring it at our hands, as it is in Deuteronomy. 18. ( i. e.) of revenging himself
in the destruction of the disobedient. Hence the observation is.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ is called and appointed by God, Doct.
to be the great Prophet, and teacher of the Church.
He is anointed to Preach good tidings to the meek, and sent to bind up the
broken hearted, Isa. 61.1. When he came to Preach the Gospel among the people
then was this Scripture fulfilled, Matthew. 11.27. Yea, all things are delivered
him of his Father, so as no man knows who the Father is, but the Son, and be
to whom the Son will reveal him. All light is now collected into one body of
light, the Sun of righteousness; and he enlighteneth every man that comes into
the world, Joh. 1.9. And though he dispenses knowledge variously, in times
past speaking in many ways, and diverse manners, to the Fathers: yet now the
Method and way of revealing the will of God to us, is fixed and settled in
Christ. In these last times he has spoken to us by his Son.

Twice has the Lord solemnly sealed him to this Office, or approved and owned
him in it, by a miraculous voice from the most excellent glory, Matthew. 3. ult.
and Matthew. 17.5.

In this point there are two things doctrinally to be discussed, and opened,
viz. What Christ's being a Prophet to the Church implies. And how he executes,
and discharges this his Office.

First, The natural ignorance and blindness of men, in the things of God. This
shows us that vain man is born as the wild Asses Colt. -- The world is
involved in darkness. The people sit as in the Region and shadow of Death, till
Christ arise upon their Souls, Matthew. 4.15, 16, 17. It Is true, in the state of
innocence, man had a clear apprehension of the will of God without a Mediator;
but now that light is quenched in the corruption of nature, and the natural man
receives not the things of God, 1 Cor. 2.14. These things of God, are not only
contrary to corrupt carnal reason, but they are also above right reason. Grace
indeed uses nature, but nature can do nothing without grace. The mind of a
natural man has not only a native blindness, by reason whereof it cannot
discern the things of the Spirit, but also a natural enmity, Romans 8.7. And
hates the light, 1 Ioh. 3.19, 20. So that until the mind be healed, and
enlightened by Jesus Christ, the natural faculty can no more discern the things
of the spirit, than the sensitive faculty can discern the things of reason. The
mysteries of nature may be discovered by the light of nature, but when it comes
to the Supernatural mysteries; there omnis platonicorum caligavit subtilitas,
as Cyprian some where speaks, the most subtle, searching, penetrating wit and
reason, is stalled, and at a loss.

Secondly, It implys the divinity of Christ. And proves him to be true God; for
as much as no other can reveal to the world in all ages the secrets that lay
hid in the heart of God, and that with such convincing evidence and authority.
He brought his Doctrine from the bosom of his Father, Ioh. 1.18. The only
begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, him has he revealed. The same
words which his Father gave him, he has given us, Ioh. 17.8. He spoke to us,
that which he had seen with his Father, Ioh. 8.38. What man can tell the bosom
counsels and secrets of God? Who but he that eternally lay in that bosom can
expound them?

Besides, Other Prophets had their times assigned them to rise, shine, and set
again by Death, Z^ch. 1.5, Your Fathers where are they? And do the Prophets
live for ever? But Christ is a fixed and perpetual. Sun that gives light in all
ages of the world. For he is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, Heb.
13.8. Yea and the very beams of his divinity shone with awefulness upon the
hearts of them that heard him. So that his very enemies were forced to
acknowledge that never any man spoke like him, Joh. 7.46.

Thirdly, It implys Christ to be the Original and fountain of all that light
which is ministerially diffused up and down the world by men. Ministers are but
Stars, which shine with a borrowed light from the Sun. So speaks the Apostle, 2
Cor. 4.6, 7. For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has
shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
in the face of Jesus Christ. Those that teach men, must be first taught by
Christ. All the Prophets of the Old, and all the Apostles, Pastors, and
Teachers of the New Testament, have lighted their Candles at his Torch. 'Twas
Christ that gave them a mouth, and wisdom, Luke 21.15. What Paul received from
the Lord, he delivered to the Church, 1 Cor. 11.23. Jesus Christ is the chief
Shepherd, 1 Pet. 5.4. And all the under Shepherds receive their gifts and
commissions from him. These things are manifestly employed in Christ's
Prophetical Office.

We shall next enquire how he executes and discharges this his Office. Or how
he enlightens and teaches men the will of God?

And this he has done variously, gradually, plainly, powerfully, sweetly,
purely, and fully.

First, Our great Prophet has revealed to men the will of God variously. Not
holding one even and constant tenor in the manifestations of the Fathers will,
but as the Apostle speaks (...) at sundry times and in diverse manners, Heb.
1.1. Sometimes he taught the Church immediately, and in his own person, Ioh.
18.20. He declared Gods righteousness in the great congregation, Psalm. 22.22.
And sometimes immediately, by his Ministers and Officers, deputed to that
service by him. So he dispensed the knowledge of God to the Church both before
his incarnation. It was Christ that in the time, and by the Ministry of Noah
went and Preached to the Spirits in prison; as it is, 1 Pet. 3.19. That is to
men and women then alive, but now separated from the body, and imprisoned in
Hell for their disobedience. And it was Christ that was with the Church in the
wilderness, instructing and guiding them, by the Ministry of Moses, and Aaron,
Acts 7.37, 38. And so he has taught the Church since his ascension. He cannot
now be personally with us, having other business to do for us in Heaven; but
however, he will not be wanting to teach us by his Officers, whom for that end
he has set and appointed in the Church, Ephesians. 4.11.12.

Secondly, He has dispensed his blessed light to the Church gradually. The
discoveries of light have been (...) that is, in many parts or parcels,
sometimes more obscure and cloudy, as it was to the Old Testament-believers, by
Visions, Dreams, Urim, Thumim, vocal Oracles, Types, Sacrifices, etc. Which
though comparatively it were but a weak glimering light, and had no glory set
by that which now shines, 2 Cor. 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 18. Yet it was sufficient for
the instruction, and Salvation of the Elect in those times. But now is light
sprung up gloriously in the Gospel dispensation. And we all with open face,
behold as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. It is to us not a twy-light, but
the light of a perfect day. And still it is advancing in the several ages of
the world. I know more (said Luther) than blessed Austin knew; and they that
come after me, will know more than I know.

Thirdly, Jesus Christ our great Prophet has manifested to us the will of God
plainly, and perspicuously. When he was on earth himself, he taught the People
by Parables; and without a Parable he spoke nothing, Matthew. 13. 3, 4. He
clothed Sublime and Spiritual mysteries in earthly Metaphors, stooping them
thereby to the low and dull capacities of men. Speaking so familiarly to the
People about them, as if he had been speaking earthly things to them, Nec tamen
co tendit haec Apost^li Apologia q^asi concionatoribus quaflibet loquendi
sordes, and quicquid in buccam venerit, effutiendi libidinem nullo sensu,
methodo, gravitate, judicio dictaret. Quis enim paulo nostro aut conscienciis
bominum, altius intonat? Aut argumentoram pondere firmiorem assensum cogit?
Quis suavi magis, sed calesti vi, affectus in transversum rapit? Reynolds ubi
Supra.
Ioh. 3.12. And so (according to his own example) would he have his Ministers
Preach, using great plainness of speech, 2 Cor. 3.12. And by manifestation of
the truth commending themselves to every man's conscience, 2 Cor. 4.2. Yet not
allowing them to be rude and careless in expression, pouring out indigested,
crude, immethodical words. No, an holy, serious, strict, and grave expression
befits the lips of his Ambassadors. And who ever spoke more weightily, more
Logically, or perswasively than that Apostle, by whose Pen Christ has
admonished us to beware of vain affectation, and swelling words of vanity? But
he would have us stoop to the understandings of the meanest. And not give the
People a Comment darker than the Text. He would have us rather pierce their
consciences, than tickle their phancies. And break their heart, than please
their ears. Christ was a very plain Preacher.

Fourthly, Jesus Christ discovered truth powerfully. Speaking as one having
authority and not as the Pharisees, Matthew. 7.29. They were cold and dull
Preachers. Their words did even freeze betwixt their lips. But Christ spoke
with power. There was heat, as well as light in his Doctrine. And so there is
still, though it be in the mouth of poor contemptible men, 2 Cor. 10.4. Optabat
Augustinus Paulum a^divisse e suggestu, quem tubam appellabat Christi, and dei
nubem, ut quot verba, tot tonitrua, auribus suis inso^are videbantur.
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God; to the
casting down of strong holds. It Is still quick and powerful, sharper than a two
edged Sword; and piercing to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of
the j^ynts and marrow, Heb. 4.12. The blessed Apostle imitated Christ. And
being filled with his Spirit, spoke home, and freely to the hearts of men. So
many words, so many claps of Thunder: (as one said of him) which made the
hearts of sinners shake, and tremble in their breasts. All faithful and able
Ministers are not alike gifted in this particular; but surely there is an holy
seriousness, a Spiritual grace, and Majesty in their Doctrine, commanding
reverence from the hearers.

Fifthly, This Prophet Jesus Christ taught the people the mind of God in a
sweet, affectionate, and taking manner. His words made their hearts burn within
them, Luke 24.32. It was Prophesied of him, Isa. 42.2. He shall not cry, nor
life up, nor cause his voice to be heard on high. A bruised reed he shall not
break, and smoking flax be shall not quench. He knew how to speak a word in
season to the weary Soul, Esa. 61.1. He gathered the Lambs with his arms. And
gently led those with young, Esa. 4.11. How sweetly did his words slide to the
melting hearts about him! He drew with cords of Love, with the bands of a man.
He discouraged none. Upbraided none that were willing to come to him. His
familiarity and free condescensions to the most vile and and despiseable
sinners, was often made the matter of his reproach. Such is his gentle and
sweet carriage to his people, that the Church is called the Lambs Wife, Rev.
19.7.

Sixthly, He revealed the mind of God purely to men. His Doctrine had not the
least dash of error to debase it. His most enviously observant hearers could
find nothing to charge him. He is the faithful and true witness, Rev. 1.5. And
he has commanded his Ministers to conserve the simplicity and purity of the
Gospel, and not to blend and sophisticate it, 2 Cor. 4.2.

Seventhly and lastly, He revealed the will of God perfectly and fully, keeping
back nothing needful to Salvation. So he tells the Disciples, Job. 15.15. All
things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you. He was
faithful as a Son, over his own house, Heb. 3.6. Thus you have a brief account
of what is employed in this part of Christ's Prophetical office, and how he
performed it.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
If Jesus Christ who is now passed into the heavens be the great Prophet, and
Teacher of the Church; hence we Justly infer the continual necessity of a
standing Ministry in the Church. For by his Ministers he now teaches us, and
to that intent has fixed them in the Church, by a firm constitution, there to
remain to the end of the world, Matthew. 28. ult. He teaches men no more
personally, but Ministerially. His Ministers supply the want of his personal
presence, 2 Cor. 5.20. We pray you in Christ's stead. These offices he gave the
Church at his Ascension, (i. e.) when he ceased to teach them any longer with
his own lips. And so set them in the Church that their succession shall never
totally fail. For so that word (...) he has set, 1 Cor. 12.28. Plainly
implies. They are set by a sure establishment, a firm and unalterable
constitution, even as the times and seasons, which the Father has put (...) in
his own power. It Is the same word. And it is well they are so firmly set and
fixed there, for how many adversaries in all ages have endeavored to shake the
very office it self: Pretending that it is needless to be taught by men, and
wresting such Scriptures as these to countenance their error, Joel. 2.28, 29.
I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and Daughters shall
Prophecy, etc. And Ier. 31.34. They shall teach no more every man his
neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord, for they shall all
know me from the least of them, to the greatest of them. As to that of Joel it
is answered, that if an Old Testament Prophecy, may be understood according to
a New Testament interpretation, then that Prophecy does no way oppose, but
confirm the Gospel Ministry. How the Apostle understood the Prophet in that his
Prophecy may be seen in Acts 2.16. When the Spirit was poured out on the day
of Pentecost upon the Apostles. And surely he must be a confident person
indeed, that thinks not an Apostle to be as good an Expositer of the Prophet as
himself. And for that in Ier. 31. we say, First, that if it conclude against
ministerial teachings, it must equally conclude against Christian Conferences.
Secondly, We say that cannot be the sense of one Scripture, which contradicts
the same sense of other Scriptures. But so would this, Ephesians. 4.11, 12. 1 Cor.
12.28. And thirdly, We say the sense of that Text is not negative, but
comparative. Not that they shall have no need to be taught any truth; but no
such need to be taught the first truths. That there is a God. And who is this
true God. They shall no more teach every man his brother saying know the Lord,
for they shall all know me. To conclude, God has given Ministers to the Church
for conversion, and edification work; till we all come into the unity of the
Faith, to a perfect man, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12. So that when all the Elect are
converted, and all those Converts become perfect men; when there is no error
in Judgment, or practice; and no seducer to cause it, then, and not till then,
will a Gospel Ministry be useless. But (as it is well observed) there is not a
man that opposes a Gospel Ministry, but the very being of that man is a
sufficient argument for the continuance of it.


Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
If Christ be the great Prophet of the Church, and such a Prophet, then it
follows, That the weakest Christians need not be discouraged at the dullness,
and incapacity they find in themselves. For Christ is not only a patient and
condescending Teacher, but he can also (as he often has done) reveal that to
babes which is hid from the wise and learned, Matthew. 11.25. The testimonies of
the Lord are sure, making wise the simple, Psalm. 19.7. Yea, and such as you
are, the Lord delights to choose; that his grace may be the more conspicuous in
your weakness, 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. You will have nothing of your own to glory in.
You will not say as a proud wretch once said, Ego, and Deus meus. I, and my God
did this. Jesus Christ affects not social glory. He will not divide the praise
with any. Well then, be not discouraged. Others may know more in other things
than you, but you are not incapable of knowing so much as shall save your
souls, if Christ will be your Teacher. In other knowledge they excel you, but
if ye knew Jesus Christ, and the truths as it is in him, one drop of your
knowledge, is worth a whole Sea of their gifts. One truth sucked by Faith and
Prayer from the breast of Christ, is better than ten thousand dry notions
beaten out by wracking the understanding. It Is better in kind, the one being
but natural, the other Supernatural, from the saving Illuminations, and inward
teachings of the Spirit. And so is one of those better things that accompany
Salvation. It Is better in respect of effects. Other knowledge leaves the heart
as dry, Si mihi daretur optio, cligerem Christiani rustici sordidissimum and
maxim agrefte opus, prae omnibus victoriis and triumphis Alexandri; ^ Caesaris.
barren, and unaffected as if it had it is seat in another man's head: but that
little you have been taught of Christ, sheds down its gracious influences upon
your affections, and slides sweetly to your melting hearts. So that as one
preferred the most despicable work of a plain ru^tick Christian, before all the
Triumphs of Alexander and Caesar; much more ought ye to prefer, one saving
manifestation of the Spirit, to all the powerless Illuminations of natural men.

Inference 3.
If Christ be the great Prophet and Teacher of the Church, Infer. 3.
it follows, that Prayer is a proper means for the increase of knowledge.
Prayer is the Goden Key which unlocks that treasure. When Daniel was to expound
that secret which was contained in the Kings Dream, about which the Chaldean
Magicians had rackt their brains to no purpose; what course does Daniel take?
Why, he went to his house (says the Text) Dan. 2.17, 18. And made the thing
known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah his companions: that they would desire
mercies of the God of Heaven concerning this secret. And then was the secret
revealed to Daniel. Tria faciunt Theologum, Meditatio, Tentatio, Precatio.
Luther.
Luther was wont to say three things make a Divine, Meditation, Temptation, and
Prayer. Holy Mr. Bradford was wont to study upon his knees. Those truths that
are got by Prayer, leave an unusual sweetness upon the heart. If Christ be our
Teacher, it becomes all his Saints to be at his Feet.

Inference 4.
If Christ be the great Prophet, Infer. 4.
and Teacher of the Church, We may thence discern and Judge of Doctrines, and
it may serve us as a test to try them by. For such as Christ is, such are the
Doctrines that flow from him Every error pretends to derive it self from him;
but as Christ was holy, humble, heavenly, meek, peaceful, plain, and simple,
and in all things alien, yea contrary to the wisdom of the world, the
gratifications of the flesh: such are the truths which he teaches.

They have his Character and Image engraven on them. Would you know then
whether this, or that Doctrine be from the Spirit of Christ or no, Examine the
Doctrine it self by this rule. And whatsoever Doctrine you find to encourage
and countenance sin, to exalt self, to be accommodated to earthly designs and
interests, to wrap and bend to the humors and Lusts of men; in a word, what
Doctrine soever directly, and as a proper cause makes them that profess it,
carnal, turbulent, proud, sensual, etc. You may safely reject it, and conclude
this never came from Jesus Christ. The Doctrine of Christ is after godliness.
His truth sanctifies. There is a gustus Spiritualis judicii, a Spiritual taste,
by which those that have their senses exercised, can distinguish things that
differ. The Spiritual man Judges all things, 1 Cor. 2.15. His ear tryes words,
as his mouth tastes meats, Job 34.3. Swallow nothing (let it come never so
speciously) that has not some relish of Christ, and holiness in it. Be sure
Christ never revealed any thing to men, that derogates from his own glory; or
prejudices, and obstructs the ends of his own Death.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
And as it will serve us for a test of Doctrines, so it serves for a test of
Ministers, and hence you may Judge who are authorized, and sent by Christ the
great Prophet, to declare his will to men. Surely, those whom he sends have his
Spirit in their Hearts, as well as his words in their Mouths. And according to
measures of grace received, they faithfully endeavor to fulfill their Ministry
for Christ, as Christ did for his Father, as my Father has sent me, (says
Christ) so send I you, Joh. 20.21. They take Christ for their pattern in the
whole course of their Ministration, and are such as sincerely endeavor to
imitate the great Shepherd, in these six particulars following.

First, Jesus Christ was a faithful Minister, the faithful, and true witness,
Rev. 1.5. He declared the whole mind of God to men. Of him it was Prophetically
said, Psalm. 40.10. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart, I have
declared thy faithfulness, and thy Salvation, I have not concealed thy loving
kindness and thy truth from the great congregation. To the same sense, and
almost in the same words, the Apostle Paul professed in Acts 20.20. I have kept
back nothing that was profitable unto you, and verse. 35. I have showed you all
things. Not that every faithful Minister does in the course of his Ministry,
anatomize the whole body of truth, and fully expound and apply each particular
to the People, no, that is not the meaning, but of those Doctrines which they
have opportunity of opening, they do not out of fear, or to accommodate and
secure base low ends, withhold the mind of God, or so corrupt and abuse his
words, as to subject truth to their own or other men's Lusts. They Preach not as
pleasing men, but God, 1 These. 2.4. For if we yet please men, we cannot be the
servants of Christ, Gal. 1.10. Truth must be spoken, though the greatest on
earth be offended. Secondly, Jesus Christ was a tender hearted Minister. Full
of compassion to souls. He was sent to bind up the broken in heart, Isa. 61.1.
He was full of bowels to poor sinners. He grieved at the hardness of men's
hearts, Mark 3.5. He mourned over Jerusalem and said, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
how often would I have gathered thy Children as a Hen gathers her brood under her
wings! Matthew. 23.37. His bowels yearned, when he saw the multitude as Sheep
having no Shepherd, Matthew. 9.36. These bowels of Christ must be in all the
under Shepherds. In, pro instar.
God is my witness (says one of them) how greatly I long after you all in (or
after the pattern of) the bowels of Christ Jesus, Phil. 1.8. He that shows a
hard heart, unaffected with the dangers and miseries of souls, can never show a
commission from Christ to authorize him, for ministerial work. Thirdly, Jesus
Christ was a laborious painful Minister, he put a necessity on himself to
finish his work in his day. A work infinitely great, in a very little time,
Ioh. 9.4. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day, the night
comes when no man can work. O how much work did Christ do, in a little time on
earth! He went about doing good, Acts 10.38. He was never idle. When he sits
down at Jacobs Well, to rest himself being weary, presently he falls into his
work, Preaching the Gospel to the Samaritaness. In this must his Ministers
resemble him. Striving according to his working, that works in them mightily,
Col. 1.28, 29. An idle Minister seems to be a contradiction in adjecto, as who
should say, a dark light. Fourthly, Jesus Christ delighted in nothing more than
the success of his Ministry. To see the work of the Lord prosper in his hand,
this was meat and drink to him. When the seventy returned, and reported the
success of their first Embassy; Lord, even the Devils are subject to us
through thy name. Why, says Christ; I behold Satan fall as lightning from
heaven. As if he had said, you tell me no news, I saw it when I sent you out at
first. I know the Gospel would make work where it came. And in that hour Jesus
rejoiced in Spirit, Luke 10.17, 18, 21. And is it not so with those sent by
him? Do'nt they value the success of their Ministry at an high rate? it is not
(says one) the expense, but the recoyling of our labors back again upon us,
that kills us. Ministers would not die so fast, nor be gray headed so soon,
could they but see the travel of their Souls. My littlle Children (says Paul)
of whom I travel again in birth (...), till Christ be formed in you, Gal. 4.19.
As for those that have the name of Shepherds only, who visit the flock only
once a year, about shearing time: who have the instruments of a foolish
Shepherd (^f^rcipes and mulctra) the shears and pail, Zech. 11.15. Woeful will
be their condition, at the appearing of this great Shepherd. Fifthly, Jesus
Christ was a Minister that lived up to his Doctrine. His Life and Doctrine
harmonized in all things. He pressed to holiness in his Doctrine, and was the
great Pattern of holiness in his Life, Matthew. 11.28. Learn of me, I am meek and
lowly. And such his Ministers desire to approve themselves, Phil. 4.9. What ye
have heard, and seen in me, that do. He Preached to their eyes, as well as ears.
His Life was a Comment on his Doctrine. They might see holiness acted in his
Life, as well as sounded by his lips. He Preached the Doctrine, and lived the
Application. Sixthly, Lastly; Jesus Christ was a Minister that minded and
maintained sweet, secret communion with God, for all his constant public
labors. If he had been Preaching and healing all the day, yet he would redeem
time from his very sleep to spend in secret Prayer, Matthew. 14.23. When he had
sent the multitude away, he went up into a Mountain apart to pray; and was
there alone. O blessed pattern! Let the keepers of the Vineyards, remember they
have a Vineyard of their own to keep. A Soul of their own that must be looked
after; as well as other men's. Those that in these things imitate Christ, are
surely sent to us from him, and are worthy of double honor. They are a choice
blessing to the people.
The TENTH Sermon. 10.
SERMON. Opens the second branch of the Prophetical office consisting in the
illumination of the understanding.

LUKE. XXIV.XLV. Then opened he their understandings, etc.


KNowledge of Spiritual things is well distinguished into intelectual, and
practical. The first has its seat in the mind, the latter in the heart. This
later Divines call a knowledge peculiar to Saints, and in the Apostles Dialect
it is (...) Philip. 3.8. The eminency, or excellency of the knowledge of Christ.

And indeed there is but little excellency in all those pretty notions which
furnish the Lips with discourse, unless by a sweet and powerful influence, they
draw the conscience and will to the obedience of Christ. Light in the mind is
necessarily antecedent to the sweet and heavenly motions and mountings of the
affections. For the farther any man stands from the light of truth, the farther
he must needs be from the heat of comfort. Heavenly quicknings are begotten in
the heart, while the Sun of righteousness spreads the beams of truth into the
understanding; and the Soul sits under those its wings. Yet all the light of
the Gospel spreading and diffusing it self into the mind, can never savingly
open and change the heart, without an other Act of Christ upon it; and what
that is, the Text informs you. Then opened be their understandings, that they
might understand the Scriptures.

In which words we have both an Act of Christ upon the Disciples
understandings, and the immediate end, and scope of that Act.

opened their understandings. By understanding is not here meant the mind only,
in opposition to the heart, will, and affections* but these were opened by and
with the mind. The mind is to the heart as the door to the house. What comes
into the heart, comes in at the understanding, which is introductive to it, and
although truths sometimes goes no farther then the Entry, never penetrates the
hearts, yet here this effect is undoubtedly included.

Expositers make this expression parallel to that in Acts 16.14. The Lord opened
the heart of Lydia. And it is well observed that it is one thing to open the
Scriptures, that is to expound them, and give the meaning of them; as Paul is
said to do in Acts 18.3. And another thing to open the mind, or heart as it is
here. Ipse est qui apperit cor nostrum in lege sua. Capel specil. p. 57.
There are as a learned man truly observes two doors of the Soul bard against
Christ. The understanding by ignorance, and the heart by hardness; both these
are opened by Christ. The former is opened by the Preaching of the Gospel, the
other by the internal operation of the Spirit. The former belongs to the first
part of Christ's Prophetical office, opened in the former; the later to that
special internal part of his Prophetical office, to be opened in this Sermon.

And that it was not a naked Act upon their minds only, but that their hearts
and minds did work in fellowship, being both touched by this Act of Christ, is
evident enough by the effects mentioned verse. 52.53. They returned to Jerusalem
with great Joy, and were continually in the Temple praising and blessing God.
It is confessed that before this time Christ had opened their hearts by
conversion, and this opening is not to be understood simply, but secundum quid,
in reference to those particular truths in which till now they were not
sufficiently informed and so their hearts could not be duly affected with them.
They were very dark in their apprehensions of the death, and resurrection of
Christ* and consequently their hearts were sad and dejected about that which
had befallen him verse. 17. but when he opened the Scriptures, and their
understandings and heart together, then things appeared with another face, and
they return blessing and praising God.

Secondly, here is farther to be considered, the design and Neque enim spiritum
Deus suis confert, qui verbi sui usum aboleat; sed potius qui fructualum
reddat, quare perperam Fanatici homines revelationum praetexta spernendae
scripturae sibi licentiam concedunt. Calv. in Loc.
That they might understand the Scriptures. Where let it be marked Reader, that
the teachings of Christ, and his Spirit, were never designed to take men off
from the reading, studying, and searching of the Scriptures, as some vain
Notionists have pretended opposing those things which are subordinated. But to
make their studies and duties the more fruitful, beneficial, and effectual to
their Souls. Or that they might this way receive the end and blessing of all
their duties. God never intended to abolish his word, by giving his Spirit. And
they are true Fanatics (as Calvin upon this place calls them) that think, or
pretend so. By this means he would at once impart more light, and make that
they had before more operative and useful to them; especially in such a time of
need as this was. Hence we observe.

DOCT. That the opening of the mind and heart, effectually to receive the
truths of God, is the peculiar prerogative, and office of Jesus Christ.
One of the great miseries under which lapsed nature labors, Collyrium occulis
inungendum quo caecitate dempta, homo spirituali visui restituitur. Glass. Phil.
2. part p. 340.

Ad perfectam and propriam rerum supernaturalium cognitionem, non sufficit ex

is spiritual blindness. Jesus Christ brings that eye salve, which only can
cure it. Rev. 3.18. I counsel thee to buy of me eye salve, that thou may see.
Those to whom the Spirit has applied it, can say as it is 1 Ioh. 5.20. We know
that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding; that we may
know him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ this is the true God, and
eternal life.

To the Spiritual illumination of a Soul it suffices not that the object be
revealed, nor yet that man, the subject of that knowledge, have a due use of
his own reason; but it is further necessary that the Grace and special
assistance of the Holy Spirit be superadded, to open and molifie the heart, and
so give it a due taste and relish of the sweetness of Spiritual truth. By
opening the Gospel, he reveals truth to us, and by opening the heart in us. Now
though this cannot be without that, yet it is much more excellent to have truth
revealed in us, than to us. This Divines call praecipuum illud (...) muneris
Prophetici. The principal perfective effect of the Prophetical office. The
special blessing promised in the new Covenant Heb. 8.10. I will put my Laws in
their mind, and write them in their hearts.

For Explication of this part of Christ's Prophetical office, I shall as in the
former, show what is included in the opening of the understanding. And by what
acts Christ performs it.

Now, to give you a brief account of what is included in this Act of Christ,
take it in the following particulars.

First, It implys the transcendent nature of Spiritual things, far exceeding
the highest flight and reach of natural reason. Jesus Christ must by his Spirit
open the understandings of men, or they can never comprehend such mysteries.
Some men have strong natural parts, and by improvement of them, are become
Eagle-eyed in the mysteries of nature. Who more acute than the Heathen sages!
yet to them the Gospel seemed foolishness 1 Cor. 1.20. Austin confesses that
before his conversion, he often felt his Spirit swell with offense, and
contempt of the Gospel; and he despising it, said dedignabar esse parvulus. He
scorned to become a child again. Bradwardine, that profound Doctor, learned
usque ad stuporem, even to a wonder; professes that when he read Paul's Epistles
he contemned them, because in them he found not a metaphysical wit. Surely it is
possible a man may with Berengarius, be able to dispute de omni scibili. Of
every point of knowledge. To unravel nature, from the Cedar in Lebanon, to the
Hysop on the wall; and yet be as blind as a Bat, in the knowledge of Christ.
The most refined and ingenuous sort of unregenerate men have nothing in them,
which is more Excellent than common grace; and common grace leaves them in the
State of nature, under the power of sin, and in the very suburbs of Hell;
wholly at the command of Satan; and if any man think otherwise, let him take
heed, that very thought does not nail him fast, to that unregenerate and cursed
estate for ever more. Dr. Cheynelles Divinet Trin. p. 410. etc.
Yea it is possible a man's understanding may be improved by the Gospel to a
great ability in the literal knowledge of it; so as to able to expound the
Scriptures orthodoxly, and enlighten others by them; as it is Matt. 7.22. The
Scribes and Pharisees were well acquainted with the Scriptures of the old
Testament; yea, such were their abilities, and esteem among the people for
them, that the Apostle styles them the Princes of this world. 1 Cor. 2.8. And
yet notwithstanding Christ truly calls them, blind guides, Matt. 23. Till
Christ open the heart, we can know nothing of him, or of his will, as we ought
to know it. So experimentally true is that of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. The
natural man receives not the things of the spirit of God, for they are
foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned. But he that is spiritual, Judges all things; yet he himself is
Judged of no man. The spiritual man can Judge and discern the carnal man, but
the carnal man wants a faculty, to Judge of the spiritual man. As a man that
carries a dark Lanthorn, can see another by its light; but the other cannot
discern him. Such is the difference betwixt persons whose hearts Christ has,
or has not opened.

Synopsis puri Theol. disputa. XXVI. p. 318.


Christ opening the understanding implys the insufficiency of all external
means, how excellent so ever they are in themselves; to operate savingly upon
men till Christ by his power open the soul, and so makes them effectual. What
excellent Preachers were Isaiah and Jeremiah to the Jews? the former spoke of
Christ more like an Evangelist of the new, than a Prophet of the old Testament.
The later was a most convictive and pathetical Preacher; yet the one complains
Isai. 53.1. Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed! the other laments the successlesness of his Ministry, Ier. 6.28. The
bellows are burnt, the lead is consumed of the fire, the founder melts in
vain. Under the new Testament what people ever enjoyed such choice helps and
means, as those that lived under the Ministry of Christ, and the Apostles? yet
how many remained still in darkness? Matt. 11.27. We have piped to you, but ye
have not danced; we have mourned unto you, but ye have not lamented. Neither
the delightful ayrs of mercy, nor the doleful ditties of Judgment could affect,
or move their hearts.

And indeed if you search into the reason of it, you will be satisfied; that
the choicest means can do nothing upon the heart, till Christ by his spirit
open it, because ordinances work not as natural causes do: for then the effect
would always follow, unless miraculously hindered, and it would be equally
wonderful that all that hear should not be converted, as that the three
Children should be in the fiery Furnace so long, and yet not be burned; no, it
works not as a natural, but as amoral cause; whose efficacy depends on the
gracious and arbitrary concurrence of the spirit. The wind blows where it
lists, Joh. 3.8. The ordinances are like the pool of Bethesda John 5.4. At a
certain time an Angel came down and troubled the waters, and then they had a
healing virtue in them. So the spirit comes down at certain times, in the word;
and opens the heart, and then it becomes the power of God to Salvation. So that
when you see souls daily sitting under excellent and choice means, and remain
dead still; you may say as Martha did to Christ of her Brother Lazarus, Lord,
if thou had been here, they had not remained dead. If thou had been in this
Sermon, it had not been so in effectual to them.

Fa^e^dum e^t igitur, nos modis omnibus defi^cre, ut Coelestis Doctrina non
ali^er utilis sit nobis vel effi^ax nisi quatenus spiritus and me^tes nostras
ad eam, intelligendam and corda nostra ad subcundum ejus jugum format. Cal^. in
Loc.
Thirdly, it implys the utter impotency of man to open his own heart, and
thereby make the word effectual to his own conversion, and Salvation. He that
at first said let there be light, and it was so, must shine into our hearts, or
they will never be savingly enlightened. 2 Cor. 4.6. A double misery lies upon a
great part of mankind viz. impotency and pride. They have not only lost the
true liberty and freedom of their wills, but with it have so far lost their
understanding and humility, as not to own it. But alas man is become a most
impotent Creature by the fall. So far from being able to open his own heart,
that he cannot know the things of the spirit, 1 Cor. 2.14. Cannot believe, John
6.44. Cannot obey, Romans 8.7. Cannot speak one good word, Matt. 12.34. Cannot
thing one good thought, 2 Cor. 3.5. Cannot do one good act, John 15.5. O what a
helpless shiftless thing is a poor sinner! suitably to this state of impotence,
conversion is in Scripture called regeneration John 3.3. A resurrection from the
dead Ephesians. 2.5. A creation Ephesians. 2.10. A victory 2 Cor. 10.5. Which does not only
imply man to be purely passive, in his conversion to God, but a renitency, and
opposition made to that power which goes forth from God to recover him.

Lastly, Christ opening the understanding imports his Divine power, Cathedram
in coelis habet, qui corda Docet.
whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. Who but God knows the
heart? who but a God can unlock and open it at pleasure? no mere Creature, no
not the Angels themselves; who for their large understanding are
Intelligencies: can command or open the heart. We may stand and knock at men's
hearts, till our own ache; but no opening till Christ come. He can fit a key to
all the cross wards of the will, and with sweet efficacy open it; and that
without any force or violence to it. These things are carried in this part of
his office. Consisting in opening the heart. Which was the first thing
propounded for explication.

Secondly, In the next place let us see by what acts Jesus

And there are two principal ways by which Christ opens the understandings and
hearts of men. viz. By His word And spirit.


First by his word to this end was Paul commissionated and Act. 26.18. To open
their eyes, and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
to God. The Lord can if he pleases, accomplish this immediately; but though he
can do it, he will not do it ordinarily without means: because he will honor
his own institutions. Therefore you shall observe, that when Lydia's heart was
to be opened, there appeared unto Paul a man of Macedonia, who prayed him,
saying, come over into Macedonia and help us. Act. 19.9. God will keep up the
reputation of his ordinances among men. And though he has not tied himself,
yet he has tied us to them. Cornelius must send for Peter; God can make the
earth produce corn, as it did at first, without cultivation and labor; but he
that shall now expect it in the neglect of means, may perish for want of bread.

Secondly, But the ordinances in themselves cannot do it, as Pro -- Rex, his
vicegerent to carry on this work upon the hearts of his Elect. And when the
Spirit comes down upon Souls, in the administration of the ordinances; he
effectually opens the heart to receive the Lord Jesus, by the hearing of faith.
He breaks in upon the understanding and conscience by powerful convictions, and
compunctions; so much that word. (...) Demonstratio est Sylogismus faciens
scire. (...). Arist.
John 16.8. imports, he shall convince the world of Sin. Convince by clear
demonstration such as inforces assent, so that the Soul can not but yield it to
be so. And yet the door of the heart is not opened, till he have also put forth
his power upon the will; and by a sweet and secret efficacy overcome all it is
reluctations, and the Soul be made willing in the day of his power. When this
is done, the heart is opened. Saving light now shines in it; and this light set
up by the Spirit in the Soul is First, a new light, in which all things appear
far otherwise than they did before. The name of Christ, and Sin; the word
Heaven and Hell have an other sound in that man's ears, than formerly they had.
When he comes to read the same Scriptures, which possibly he had read an
hundred times before, he wonders he should be so blind, as he was, to over look
such great, weighty, and concerning things as he now beholds in them: and
says, where were mine eyes, that I could never see these things before?
Secondly, It is a very affecting light. A light that has heat and powerful
influences in it, which makes deep impressions on the heart. Hence they whose
eyes the great Prophet opens, are said to be brought out of darkness, into his
marvelous light. 1 Pet. 2.9. The Soul is greatly affected with what it sees.
The beams of light are contracted and twisted together in the mind, and being
reflected on the heart and affections; soon cause them to smoke, and burn. Did
not our hearts burn within us, whilst he talked with us, and opened to us the
Scriptures. Thirdly, And it is a growing light. Like the light of the morning
which shines more and more, unto a perfect Day. Prove. 4.18. When the Spirit
first opens the understanding, he does not give it at once a full sight of all
truths, or a full sense of the power, sweetness, and goodness of any truth; but
the Soul in the use of means grows up to a greater clearness, day by day. It Is
knowledge grows extensively in measure, and intensively in power and efficacy.
And thus the Lord Jesus by his Spirit opens the understanding. Now the use of
this follows in 5. practical deductions.


Inference 1.
If this be the work and office of Jesus Christ to open the understandings of
men, Infer. 1.
Hence we infer, the misery that lies upon those men, whose understandings, to
this day, Jesus Christ has not opened. Of whom we may say as it is, Deuteronomy.
29.4. To this day Christ has not given them eyes to see. Natural blindness
whereby we are deprived of the light of this world, is sad; but spiritual
blindness is much more sad. See how dolefully their case is represented, 2 Cor.
4.3, 4. But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; whose eyes
the God of this world has blinded; lest the light of the glorious Gospel of
Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. He means a total and
final concealment of the saving power of the word from them. Why, what if Jesus
Christ withhold it, and will not be a Prophet to them; what is their condition?
truly no better than lost men. It is hid (...) to them that are to perish, or
be destroyed. This blindness like the covering of the face, or tying the
handkerchief over the eyes; is in order to their turning off into Hell. More
particularly, because the point is of deep concernment let us consider, First,
the Judgment inflicted, and that is spiritual blindness. A sore misery indeed.
Not anuniversal ignorance of all truths; O, no, in natural, and moral truths
they are often times acute, and sharp sighted men; but in that part of
knowledge which wrape up eternal life, John 17.2. there they are utterly
blinded. As it is said of the Jews upon whom this misery lies, that blindness in
part is happened to Israel. They are learned and knowing persons in other
matters, but they know not Jesus Christ, there is the grand and sad defect.
Secondly, the subject of this Judgment, the mind; which is the eye of the
soul. If it were but upon the body, it would not be so considerable, this falls
immediately upon the soul the noblest part of man, and upon the mind, the
highest and noblest faculty of the soul; whereby we understand, think and
reason. This in Scripture is called (...) the spirit. The intellectual rational
faculty; which Philosophers call (...) the leading, directive faculty: which is
to the soul, what the natural eye (...) to the body. Now the soul being the
most active and restless thing in the world, always working; and its leading
directive power blind; Judge what a sad and dangerous state such a soul is in.
Just like a fiery high metled Horse, whose eyes are out, furiously carrying his
rider among rocks, pits, and dangerous precipices. I remember Chrysostom
speaking of the loss of a soul says, that a loss of a member of the body, is
nothing to it; for says he, if a man lose an eye, Ear, Hand, or Foot, there is
another to supply its want. Omnia Deus dedit duplicia. God has given us those
members double animam vero unam, but he has not given us two souls; that if
one be lost, yet the other may be saved. Surely it were better for thee,
Reader, to have every member of thy body made the seat and subject of the most
exqu^site racking torments, than for spiritual blindness to befall thy soul.
Moreover, Thirdly, Consider the indiscernableness of this Judgment, to the
soul on whom it lies. They know it not; no more than a man knows that he is
asleep. Indeed, it is the spirit of a deep sleep, poured out upon them from the
Lord. Isa. 29.10. Like that which befell Adam when God opened his side; and took
out a Rib. This renders their misery the more remediless. Because ye say you
see, therefore your sin remains, Joh. 9.41. Once more, Fourthly, Consider the
tendency and effects of it. What does this tend to, but eternal ruin? For
hereby we are cut off from the only remedy. The soul that is so blinded, can
neither see sin, nor a Savior; but like the Egyptians during the palpable
darkness, sits still; and moves not after its own recovery. And as ruin is
that to which it tends, so in order thereto, it renders all the ordinances and
duties under which that soul comes altogether useless, and ineffectual to its
salvation. He comes to the word, and sees others melted by it, but to him it
signifies nothing. O what a heavy stroke of God is this! most wretched is their
case, to whom Jesus Christ will not apply this eye salve; that they may see.
Did you but understand the misery of such a state, if Christ should say to you
as he did to the blind man, Matthew. 20.33. What will thou that I shall do for
thee? you would return, as he did; Lord that my eyes may be opened.


Inference 2.
If Jesus Christ be the great Prophet of the Church, Infer. 2.
then surely he will take special care both of the Church, and the under
shepherds appointed by him to feed them. Else both the objects, and instruments
upon, and by which he executes his office, must fail, and consequently this
glorious office be in vain. Hence he is said to walk among the golden
Candlesticks, Revel. 1.13. and Rev. 2.1. to hold the Stars in his right hand.
Jesus Christ instrumentally opens the understandings of men by the preaching of
the Gospel; and whilst there is an elect soul to be converted, or a convert to
be farther illuminated, means shall not fail to accomplish it by.

Inference 3.
Hence you that are yet in darkness, Infer. 3.
may be directed to whom to apply your selves, for saving knowledge. It Is
Christ that has the sovereign eye salve; So thick is that cataract which is
grown over the eye of our understanding that none but God can couch it. Christ
was sent to be a light to the Gentiles: so he enlightens the medium; and to
open the eyes of the blind. So he heals the Organ: He is the only Oculist.
Firmins Real Christian. p. 30.
that can cure your blindness. He only has the key of the house of David, he
opens and no man shuts. O that I might persuade you to set your selves in
his way, under the ordinances, and cry to him, Lord, that my eyes may be
opened. Three things are marvelously encouraging to you so to do.

First, God the Father has put him into this Office, for the cure of such as
you be. Isa. 49.6. I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou
may be my salvation to the ends of the earth. This may furnish you with an
argument to plead for a cure. Why do you not go to God, and say, Lord, did
thou give Jesus Christ a Commission to open the blind eyes? Behold me Lord,
such a one am I, a poor, dark, ignorant soul. Did thou give him to be thy
salvation to the ends of the earth? No place, nor people excluded from the
benefit of this light; and shall I still remain in the shadow of death? O that
unto me he might be a saving light also. The best and most excellent work that
ever thou wroughtest, brings thee no glory, till it come into the light; O let
me see and admire it. Secondly, It Is encouraging to think, that Jesus Christ
has actually opened the eyes of them that were as dark and ignorant as you now
are. He has revealed those things to babes, that have been hid from the wise
and prudent. Matthew. 11.25. The Law of the Lord is perfect making wise the
simple. Psalm. 19.7. And if you look among those whom Christ has enlightened,
you will not find many wise after the flesh, many mighty, or Noble; but the
foolish, weak, base, and despised. These are they on whom he has glorified the
riches of his grace. 1 Cor. 26.27. Thirdly, And is it not yet further
encouraging to you; that hitherto he has mercifully continued you under the
means of light? Why is not the light of the Gospel put out? Why are times and
seasons of grace continued to you, if God have no further design of good to
your souls? Be not therefore discouraged but wait on the Lord in the use of
means, that you may yet be healed.
Quest.
If you ask what can we do to put our selves into the way of the spirit, in
order to such a cure?

Soll.
I say that though you cannot do any thing that can make the Gospel effectual,
yet the spirit of God can make those means you are capable of using effectual,
if he please to concur with them. And it is a certain truth, that your
inability to do what is above your power, does no way excuse you from doing
what is within the compass of your power to do. I know, no act that is saving,
can be done without the concurrence of special grace, yea, and no act that has
a remote order and tendency thereunto, without a more general concourse of Gods
assistance; but herein he is not behind hand with you. Let me therefore advise.

First, That you dilligently attend upon an able, faithful and searching
ministry. Neglect no opportunity God affords you, for how know you but that may
be the time of mercy to your souls: If he that lay so many years at the Pool of
Bethesda, had been wanting but that hour when the Angel came down and troubled
the waters, he had not been healed.

Secondly, Satisfy not your selves with hearing, but consider what you hear.
Allow time to reflect upon what God has spoken to you. What power is there in
man more excellent, or more appropriate to the reasonable nature, than its
reflexive and self considering power? There is little hope of any good to be
done upon your souls, until you begin to go alone; and become thinking men and
women. Here all conversion begins. I know a severer task can hardly be imposed
upon a carnal heart. It Is a hard thing to bring a man, and himself together,
upon this acccount. But this must be, if ever the Lord do your souls good.
Psalm. 4.4. Commune with your own hearts.

Thirdly, Labor to see, and ingenuously confess the insufficiency of all your
other knowledge to do you good. What if you had never so much skill and
knowledge in other mysteries? What if you be never so well acquainted with the
letter of the Scripture? What if you had angelical illumination, this can never
save thy soul. No, all thy knowledge signifies nothing, till the Lord show thee
by special light, the deplored state of thy own heart; and a saving sight of
Jesus Christ thy only remedy.

Inference 4.
Since then there is a common light, and special saving light which none but
Christ can give, Infer. 4.
it is therefore the concernment of every one of you, to try what your light is.
We know (says the Apostle) 1 Cor. 8.1. that we all have knowledge. O but what,
and whence is it? Is it the light of life, springing from Jesus Christ; that
bright and morning star? Or only such as the Devils and damned have? These
lights differ.

First, in their very kinds, and natures. The one is Heavenly, supernatural,
and spiritual: the other earthly, and natural; the effect of a better
constitution or education, Iam. 3.15, 17.

Secondly, They differ most apparently in their effects and operations. The
light that comes in a special way from Christ, is humbling, abasing, and soul
emptying light. By it a man sees the vileness of his own nature, and practice,
which begets self loathing in him: but natural light on the contrary, puffs up,
and exalts; makes the heart swell with self conceitedness. 1 Cor. 8.1.

The Light of Christ is practical and operative, still urging the soul, yea,
lovingly constraining it to obedience. No sooner did it shine into Paul's heart,
but presently he asks, Lord what will thou have me to do? Act. 9.6. It brought
forth fruit, in the Collossians, from the first day it came to them, Col. 1.6.
but the other spends it self in impractical notions, and is detained in
unrighteousness. ^ Romans 1.18. The light of Christ is powerfully transformative
of its subjects changing the man in whom it is, into the same image, from glory
to glory. 2 Cor. 3. ult. but common light leaves the heart as dead, carnal and
sensual, as if no light at all were in it.

In a word, All saving light endears Jesus Christ to the soul, and as it could
not value him before it saw him, so when once he appears to the soul in his own
light, he is appreciated and endeared unspeakably: then, none but Christ. All
is but dung that he may win Christ. None in Heaven but him, nor on earth
desirable in comparison of him. But no such effect flows from natural common
knowledge.

Thirdly, They differ in their Issues. Natural common knowledge vanishes, as
the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 13.8. It Is but a May flower, and dies in its month.
Does not their excellency that is in them go away? Job 4.21. But this that
springs from Christ, is perfected, not destroyed by death. It springs up into
everlasting life. The soul in which it is subjected, carrys it away with it
into glory. Ioh. 17.2. this light is life eternal. Now turn in, and compare
your selves with these rules. Let not false light deceive you.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
Lastly, How are they obliged to love serve and honor Jesus Christ, whom he
has enlightened with the saving knowledge of himself? O that with hands and
hearts lifted up to Heaven, ye would adore the free grace of Jesus Christ to
your souls! How many round about you have their eyes closed, and their hearts
shut up! How many are in darkness, and there are like to remain, till they come
to the blackness of darkness; which is reserved for them? O what a pleasant
thing is it for your eyes to see the light of this world! but what is it for
the eye of your mind to see God in Christ? To see such ravishing sights as the
objects of faith are? And to have such a pledge as this given you of the
blessed visions of glory: for in this light, you shall see light. Bless God,
and boast not. Rejoice in your light, but be not proud of it. And beware ye sin
not against the best, and highest light in this world. If God were so incensed
against the Heathens for disobeying the light of nature, what is it in you, to
sin with eyes clearly illuminated with the purest light that shines in this
world? You know God charges it upon Solomon in 1 King. 11.9. that he turned
from the way of obedience, after the Lord had appeared unto him twice. Jesus
Christ intended when he opened your eyes, that your eyes should direct your
feet. Light is a special help to obedience, and obedience a singular help to
increase your light.

Sermon. 11.
The ELEVENTH SERMON. Discovers the nature and necessity of the Priesthood of
Christ.

HEB. IX.XXIII. It was therefore necessary that the partners of things in the
Heavens should be purified with these, but the Heavenly things themselves, with
better Sacrifices than these.


SAlvation (as to the actual dispensation of it) is revealed by Christ as a
Prophet, procured by him as a Priest, applied by him as a King: in vain is it
revealed, if not purchased; in vain revealed, and purchased, if not applied.
How it is revealed both to us, and in us, by our great Prophet: has been
declared. And now from the Prophetical Office, we pass on to the Priestly
Office of Jesus Christ; who as our Priest, purchased our Salvation. In this
Office is contained the grand relief for a soul distressed by the guilt of sin.
When all other reliefs have been essayed, it is the blood of this great
sacrifice, sprinkled by faith upon the trembling conscience, that must cool,
refresh, and sweetly compose, and settle it. Now seeing so great a weight hangs
upon this Office, the Apostle industriously confirms, and commends it in this
Epistle, and more specially in this ninth Chapter. Showing how it was figured
to the world by the Typical blood of the sacrifices, but infinitely excels them
all. And as in many other most weighty respects, so principally in this; that
the blood of these Sacrifices did but purify the Types, or patterns of the
Heavenly things; but the blood of this Sacrifice, purified or consecrated the
Heavenly things themselves, signified by those Types.

The words read, Concludit argumenta superiora de necessitate redemptionis, a
proportione Typorum, and rerum coelestium. Si Typica sacra necesse fuit purgari
sanguine Typico; tanto sa^e praestantiori sanguine mundari oportuit (...)
quanto ipsa sunt praestantiora exemplaribus terrenis ^katio est a^erta, quia
qualis inter Typos, and res talis inter Typorum, and reram consecrationes debet
esse proportio. Pateus in La.
contain an Argument to prove the necessity of the offering up of Christ the
great Sacrifice, drawn from the proportion betwixt the Types, and things
Typified. If the Sanctuary, Mercy-seat, and all things pertaining to the
service of the Tabernacle, was to be consecrated by blood; those earthly, but
sacred Types, by the blood of Bulls, and Lambs, etc. much more the Heavenly
things shadowed by them, ought to be purified or consecrated by better blood,
than the blood of beasts. The blood consecrating these, should as much excel
the blood that consecrated those; as the Heavenly things themselves, do in
their own nature excel those earthly shadows of them. Look what proportion
there is betwixt the Type, and Antitype; the like proportion also is betwixt
the blood that consecrates them. Earthly things with common, Heavenly things
with the most excellent blood.

So then, there are two things to be especially observed here. First, The
nature of Christ's death and sufferings, it had the nature, use, and end of a
Sacrifice; and of all Sacrifices the most excellent. Secondly, The necessity of
his offering up, it was necessary to correspond with all the Types and
prefigurations of it under the Law, but especially it was necessary for the
expiating of sin, the propitiating of a justly incensed God, and the opening a
way for reconciled ones to come to God in. The point I shall give you from it
is;

DOCT. That the sacrifice of Christ our high Priest, Doct.
is most excellent in it self; and most necessary for us.
Sacrificia alia sunt Typica, alia significata; and utra ^ue vel (...) seu
propitiatoria; (...) seu gratiarum actio^is. Lucas Trelcarius. p. 78.
Sacrifices are of two sorts, Eucharistical; or thank-offerings, in
testification of homage, duty and service; and in token of gratitude for
mercies freely received: and Ilastical, or expiatotory; for satisfaction to
Justice, and thereby the attoning and reconciling of God. Of this last kind,
was the sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ for us. To this Office he was called
by God, Heb. 5.5. in it he was confirmed by the unchangeable oath of God, Psalm.
110.4. for it he was singularly qualified by his incarnation, Heb. 5.6, 7. and
all the ends of it he has fully answered. Heb. 9.11, 12.

My present design is from this Scripture to open the general nature and
absolute necessity of the Priesthood of Christ. Showing what his Priesthood
implys in it, and how all this was indispensably necessary, in order to our
recovery, from the deplorable state of sin and misery.

First then, we will consider what it supposes, and implies. And then, wherein
it consists. And there are six things which it either presupposes or necessary
includes in it.

The nature of Christ's Priesthood opened.
First, At first sight, it supposes man's revolt and fall from God; and a
dreadful breach made thereby, betwixt God and him; else no need of an attoning
sacrifice. If one dyed for all, then were all death. 2 Cor. 5.14. dead in Law,
under sentence to dye, and that eternally. In all the sacrifices from Adam to
Christ, this was still preached to the world; that there was a fearful breach
betwixt God, and man; and that even so justice required our blood should be
shed. And the fire flaming on the Altar which wholly burnt up the sacrifice, was
a lively Emblem of that fiery indignation, that should devour the Adversaries.
But above all, when Christ that true and great sacrifice was offered-up to God,
then was the fairest glass that ever was in the world, set before us; to see
our sin, and misery by the fall in.

Secondly, His Priesthood supposes the unalterable purpose of God to take
vengeance for sin* He will not let it pass. I will not determine what God could
do in this case, by his absolute power; but I think it is generally yielded,
that by his ordinate power, The Reader may find this case learnedly and solidly
handled by Dr. Twisse, Vindiciae gra^iae Digress. 8.
he could do no less than punish it, in the person of the sinner, or of his
surety.

Those that contend for such a forgiveness, Nulia alia ratione palam
f^^ripotest odium adversus peratum dici^um, quam poenae commeritae inflictione.
Brad. de Justific. p. 61.
as is an Act of Charity, like that whereby private persons forgive one
another, must at once suppose God to part with his right, cedendo de jure suo,
and also render the satisfaction of Christ altogether useless, as to the
procurement of forgiveness. Yea, rather an obstacle, than a means to it. Surely
the nature and truth of God, oblige him to punish sin. He is of purer eyes,
than to look upon iniquity, 1 Heb. 13. And beside, the word is gone out of his
mouth; that the sinner shall dye.

Thirdly, The Priesthood of Christ, presupposes the utter impotency of man to
appease God; and recover his favor by any thing he could do, or suffer. Surely
God would not come down, to assume a body to dye; and be offered up for us; if
at any cheaper rate it could have been accomplished. There was no other way to
recover man, and satisfy God. Those that deny the satisfaction of Christ, and
talk of his dying to confirm the truth; and give us an example of meekness,
patience, and self-denial; affirming these to be the sole ends of his death, do
not only therein root up the foundation of their own comfort, peace and pardon;
but most boldly impeach, and tax the infinite Wisdom. God could have done all
this at a cheaper rate. The sufferings of a mere creature, are able to attain
these ends. The death of the Martyrs did it. But who by dying can satisfy, and
reconcile God? What creature can bring him an adequate and proportionable value
for sin? Yea, for all the sin that ever was or shall be transmitted to the
natures, or committed by the persons of all Gods Elect; from Adam, to the last
that shall be found alive at the Lords coming? Surely, none, but Christ, can do
this.

Fourthly, Hinc igit^r apparet quam ne^essari^m fuit ut Christus mediator ^sset
and Deus and homo; nisi enim h^mo^non fuisset i^oneum sacrifici^^, and nisi
Deus fuisset, sacrificium illud non fuisse^ s^ff^i^ntis virtutis. Ames med. p.
92.
Christ's Priesthood implys the necessity of his being God-man. It was necessary
he should be a man in order to his passion, compassion, and derivation of his
righteousness, and holiness to men. Had he not been man, he had had no
sacrifice to offer, no soul, or body to suffer in. The Godhead is impatible,
immortal, and above all those sufferings and miseries Christ felt for us.
Besides, his being man fills him with bowels of compassion, and tender sense of
our miseries. This makes him a merciful, and faithful High Priest. Heb. 4.15.
And not only fits him to pity, but to sanctify us also; for he that
sanctifies, and they that are sanctified, are both of one. Heb. 2.11, 14, 17.
And as necessary it was our High Priest should be God, since the value and
efficacy of of his sacrifice, results from thence.

Fifthly, The Priesthood of Christ implies the extremity of his sufferings. In
sacrifices, you know, there was a destruction, a kind of Annihilation of the
Creature, to the glory of God. The sheding of the creatures blood, and burning
its flesh with fire, was but an umbrage, or faint resemblance of what Christ
endured, when he made his soul an offering for sin.

Sixthly and Lastly, It implies the gracious design of God, to reconcile us at
a dear rate to himself, in that he called, and confirmed Christ in his
Priesthood, by an oath; and thereby laid out a sacrifice of infinite value for
the world. Sins for which no sacrifice is allowed are desperate sins. And the
case of such sinners is helpless. But if God allow, yea and provide a sacrifice
himself; how plainly does it speak his intentions of peace and mercy? These
things are manifestly presupposed, or employed in Christ's Priesthood.

Synopsis purioris Theologi^e. p. 318. Sacerdotium Christi est functio qua
coram Deo appa et, ut legem ab ipso acceptam, nostro noni^e observe^; scipsum
victiman reconciliationis p^o nostris peccatis ipsi ofserat; fua que apud Deam
intercessione op^n ipsius perennem, ac do^ationem spiritus sancti nobu^
impet^et, atque efficiter ap li^^.
This Priesthood of Christ is that function wherein he comes before God in our
name, and place; to fulfill the Law, and offer up himself to him a sacrifice of
reconciliation, for our sins; and by his intercession to continue and apply the
purchase of his blood to them for whom he shed it. All this is contained in
that famous Scripture, Heb. 10.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. or more briefly.
The Priesthood of Christ is that whereby he expiated the sins of men, and
obtained the favor of God for them. Col. 1.20, 22. Romans 5.10. But because I
shall insist more largely upon the several parts and fruits of this office, it
shall here suffice to speak thus much as to its general nature; which was the
first thing proposed for explication.

The necessity of Christ's Priesthood comes next to be opened.

The truth of this assertion will be cleared by these two principles, which are
evident in the Scripture, viz. That God stood upon full satisfaction, and would
not remit one sin without it. And that fallen man is totally incapable, of
tendering him any such satisfaction. Therefore Christ who only can, must do it;
or we perish.

First, God stood upon full satisfaction, and would not remit one sin without
it. This will be cleared from the nature of sin. And from the veracity and
wisdom of God.

First, From the nature of sin, which deserves that the sinner should suffer
for it. Penal evil, in a course of Justice, follows moral evil. Sin and sorrow
ought to go together. Betwixt these is a necessary connection. Romans 6.23. The
wages of sin is death.

Secondly, The veracity of God requires it. The word was gone out of his mouth.
Genesis 2.17. In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall surely dye. Certo a^
statim morieris.
From that time he was instantly and certainly obnoxious and liable to the
death of soul and body. The Law pronounces him cursed that continues not in all
things that are written therein to do them. Gal. 3.9. Now though man's
threatenings are often vain, and insignificant things; yet Gods shall surely
take place. Not one tittle of the Law shall fail, till all be fulfilled. Matthew.
5.18. God will be true in his threatenings, though thousands, and millions
perish.

Thirdly, D^ct. R^ynold^ on Psalm. 1.10. p. 409.
The wisdom of God, by which he governs the rational world, admits not of a
dispensation, or relaxation of the threatenings, without satisfaction. For as
good no King, as no Laws for government. As good no Law, as no penalty. And as
good no penalty, as no execution. To this purpose one well observes. It Is
altogether undecent, especially to the wisdom and and righteousness of God,
that that which provokes the execution, should procure the abrogation of his
Law. That that should supplant and undermine the Law, for the alone preventing
whereof, the Law was before established. How could it be expected, that ^en
should fear and tremble before God; when they should find themselves more
feared than hurt, by his threats against sin? So then, God stood upon
satisfaction, and would admit no treaty of peace, on any other ground.

Ob.
Let none here object, that reconciliation upon this only score of satisfaction,
is derogatory to the riches of grace: or that we allow not God, what we do men;
viz. to forgive an injury freely, without satisfaction.

Sol.
Free forgiveness to us, and full satisfaction made to God; by Jesus Christ for
us; are not (...), things inconsistent with each other: as in its proper place,
shall be fully cleared to you. And for denying that to God, which we allow to
men; you must know, that man and man stands on even ground. Man is not capable
of being wronged, and injured by man, as God is by man. There is no compare
betwixt the nature of the offenses.

To conclude, man only can freely forgive man, in a private capacity; so far as
the wrong concerns himself; but ought not to do so, in a public capacity, as
he is a Judge, and bound to execute justice impartially. God is our Lawgiver,
and Judge. He will not dispense with violations of the Law, but strictly stands
on complete satisfaction.

Secondly, Man can tender to God no satisfaction of his own for the wrong done
by his sin. He finds no way to compensate, and make God amends; either by
doing, or by suffering his will.

First, Not by doing. This way is shut up to all the world. None can satisfy
God, or reconcile himself to him this way. For its evident our best works are
sinful. All our righteousness as filthy rags, Isa. 64.6. And it is strange any
should imagine, that one sin, should make satisfaction for another: if it be
said, not what is sinful in our duties, but what is spiritual pure and good,
may ingratiate us with God. It is at hand to reply, that what is good in any of
our duties, is a debt we owe to God; yea, we owe him perfect obedience; and it
is not imaginable, how we should pay one debt, by another. Quit a Farmer, by
contracting a new engagement: if we do any thing that is good, we are beholding
to grace for it. Ioh. 15.5. 2 Cor. 3.5. 1 Cor. 15.10. In a word, those that
have had as much to plead on that score, as any now living, have quitted, and
utterly given up all hopes of appeasing and satisfying the justice of God that
way. It Is like, holy Job feared God, and eschued evil as much as any of you;
yet he says, Job 9.20, 21. If I justify my self, mine own mouth shall condemn
me; if I say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. Though I were
perfect, yet would I not know my soul; I would despise my life. It may be David
was a man as much after the heart of God, as you; yet he said, Psalm. 143.2.
Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living
be justified. It Is like Paul lived as holy, heavenly, and fruitful a life, as
the best of you; and far, far beyond you; yet he says, 1 Cor. 4.4. I know (or
am conscious to my self) of nothing, yet am I not thereby justified. His
sincerity might comfort him, could not justify him. And what need I say more,
the Lord has shut up this way to all the world. And the Scriptures speak it
roundly, and pl^^^ly; Romans 3.20. Therefore by the deeds of the Law; there shall
no flesh be justified in his sight. Compare Gal. 3.21. Romans 8.3.

Secondly, And as man can never reconcile himself to God by doing, so neither
by suffering. That is equally impossible. For no sufferings can satisfy God,
but such as are proportionable to the offense we suffer for. And if so, an
infinite suffering must be born. I say infinite, for so sin is; an infinite
evil, objectively considered, as it wrongs an infinite God. Now sufferings may
be said to be infinite, either in respect of their weight, exceeding all bounds
and limits. The letting out the wrath and fury of an infinite God. Or in
respect of duration, being endless and everlasting. In the first sense, no
Creature can bear an infinite wrath. It would swallow us up. In the second, it
may be born, as the damned do; but then, ever to be suffering, is never to have
satisfied.

So that no man can be his own Priest, to reconcile himself to God, by what he
can do, or suffer. And therefore, one that is able by doing, and suffering to
reconcile him, must undertake it, or we perish. Thus you see plainly, and
briefly; the general nature and necessity of Christ's Priesthood.

From both these, several useful Corollarys, or practical deductions offer
themselves.

Corollary 1.
Cor. 1.
This shows in the first place, the incomparable excellency of the reformed
Christian Religion, above all other Religions known to, or professed in the
world. What other Religions seek, the Christian Religion only finds; even a
solid foundation for true peace, and settlement of conscience. While the Jews
seek it in vain, in the Law; the Mahumetan, in his external and ridiculous
observances; the Papist in his own merits; the Believer only finds it, in the
blood of this great sacrifice: this, and nothing less than this, can pacify a
dis^^^^sed conscience, laboring under the weight of its own guilt. Conscience
demands no less to satisfy it, than God demands to satisfy him. The grand
inquest of conscience is; Is God satisfied? If he be satisfied, I am satisfied.
Woeful is the state of that man, that feels the worm of conscience nibling on
the most tender part of the soul, and has no relief against it. That feels the
intolerable scalding wrath of God, burning within, and has nothing to cool
it. Hear me, you that slight troubles of conscience; that call them fancies,
and melancholy whimsies; if you ever had had but one sick night for sin, if
you had ever felt that shame, fear, horror, and despair which are the dismal
effects of an accusing, and condemning conscience, you would account it an
unspeakable mercy to hear of a way for the discharge of a poor sinner, from
that guilt. You would kiss the feet of that messenger, that could bring you
tidings of peace. You would call him blessed, that should direct you to an
effectual remedy. Now, whoever thou art, that pinest away in thine iniquities;
that droopest from day to day under the present wounds, and dismal presages of
conscience, know that thy soul and peace can never meet, till thou art
persuaded to come to this blood of sprinkling.

The blood of this sacrifice, speaks better things than the blood of Abel. The
blood of this sacrifice, is the blood of God. Act. 20.28. invaluably precious
blood. 1 Pet. 1.18. one drop of it infinitely excels the blood of all other
creatures. Heb. 10.4, 5, 6. Such is the blood that must do thee good. Lord, I
must have such blood (says conscience) as is capable of giving thee full
satisfaction, or it can give me no peace. The blood of all the Cattle upon a
thousand Hills, cannot do this. What is the blood of beasts, to God? The blood
of all the men in the world, can do nothing in this case. What is our polluted
blood worth? No no, it is the blood of God, that must satisfy both thee, and me.

Yea, Christ's blood is not only the blood of God, but it is blood shed in thy
stead, and in thy place and room. Gal. 3.13. He was made a curse for us. And so
it becomes sin pardoning blood. Heb. 9.22. Ephesians. 1.7. Col. 1.14. Romans 3.26. And
consequently, conscience pacifying, and soul quieting blood. Col. 1.20. Ephesians.
2.13, 14. Romans 3.26. O bless God, that ever the news of this blood came to
thine ears. With hands and eyes lifted up to Heaven, admire that grace, that
cast thy lot in a place where this joyful sound rings in the ears of poor
sinners. What had thy case been, if thy mother had brought thee forth in the
deserts of Arabia, or in the wastes of America! or what if thou had been
nursed up by a Popish father, who could have told thee no other remedy when in
distress for sin, but to go such a pilgrimage; to whip and lash thy self, to
satisfy an angry God! Surely the pure light of the Gospel shining upon this
generation, is a mercy never to be duly valued, never to be enough prized.

Corollary. 2.
Hence also be informed of the necessity of faith, Cor. 2.
in order to a state and sense of peace with God. For to what purpose is the
blood of Christ our sacrifice shed, unless it be actually and personally
applied, Ponet^; manum, significa^s and se scelera sua poenamque iis and
debitum; conjicere in caput victimae. Ut Graecis (...) genus est imprecationis.
Drusius, and Menochius.
and appropriated by faith? You know when the sacrifices under the Law were
brought to be slain; he that brought it, was to put his hand upon the head of
his sacrifice, and so it was accepted from him, to make an atonement. Lev.
1.4. Not only to signify, that now it was no more his, but Gods; the propriety
being transferred by a kind of manumission; nor yet that he voluntarily gave it
to the Lord, as his own free act; but principally it noted the putting off his
sins, and the penalty due to him for them, upon the head of the sacrifice: and
so it employed in it an execration, as if he had said, upon thy head be the
evil. So the Learned observe the Ancient Egyptians were wont expressly to
imprecate, when they sacrificed. If any evil be coming upon us, or upon Egypt;
let it turn and rest upon this head, laying their hand at these words on the
sacrifices head. And upon that ground says the Historian, Hero^. 2.39.
none of them would eat of the head of any living creature. You must also lay
the hand of faith upon Christ your sacrifice, not to imprecate, but apply, and
appropriate him to your own souls; he having been made a curse for you.

To this, the whole Gospel tends; even to persuade sinners to apply Christ, and
his blood to their own souls. To this he invited us, Matthew. 11.28. Come unto me
ye that are weary and heavy laden; and I will give you rest. For this end our
sacrifice was lifted up upon the Altar. Joh. 3.14, 15. As Moses lifted up the
Serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up; that whosoever
believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. The Effects of
the Law, not only upon the conscience, filling it with torments, but upon the
whole person, bringing death upon it; are here shadowed out by the stingings of
fiery Serpents; and Christ by the brazen Serpent which Moses exalted for the
Israelites, that were stun^ to look unto. And as by looking to it, they were
healed; so by believing, or looking to Christ in faith, our souls are healed.
Those that looked not to the Brazen Serpent, died infallibly; so must all that
look not to Jesus, our sacrifice, by faith. It Is true, It is a rule, that where
there is a total, and sufficient cause in act; there the effect must needs
follow. But if they be partial causes, then the causes which suce^d in order,
do not produce their complete effect, until the last cause be in act.
the death of Christ is the meritorious cause of remission, but faith is the
instrumental applying cause: and as Christ's blood is necessary in its place, so
is our faith in its place also. For to the actual remission of sin, and peace
of conscience; there must be a cooperation of all the causes of remission, and
peace. As there is the grace and love of God, for an efficient, and impulsive
cause; and the death of Christ our sacrifice, the meritorious cause; so of
necessity there must be faith, the instrumental cause. And these concauses do
all sweetly meet in their influences, and activities; in our remission, and
tranquillity of conscience: and are all (suo genere) in their kind, and place
absolutely necessary, to the procuring and applying of it.

What the near that the blood of Christ is shed, if I have no interest in it,
no saving influences from it? O be convinvinced, this is the end, the business
of life. Faith is the Phoenix grace, as Christ is the Phoenix mercy. He is the
gift, Joh. 4.10. And this is the work of God Ioh. 6.29. the death of Christ,
the offers and tenders of Christ, never saved one soul in themselves, without
believing application. But woe is me, how do I see sinners either not at all
touched with the sense of sin, and so being whole need not the Physician; or if
any be s^^^g, and wounded with guilt, how do they lick themselves whole, with
their own duties, and reformations! as Physicians say of wounds, let them but
be kept clean, and nature will find balsom of its own, to heal them. If it be
so in spiritual wounds, what need Christ to have left the Fathers bosom, and
come down to dye in the quality and nature of a Sacrifice for us? O, if men can
but have health, pleasure, riches, honors, and any way make a shift to still a
brawling conscience, that it may not check, or interrupt them in these
enjoyments: Christ may go where he will, for them.

And I am assured till God show you the face of sin, in the glass of the Law.
Make the Scorpions and fiery Serpents, that lurk in the Law, and in your own
consciences, to come hissing about you, and smiting you with their deadly
stings; till you have had some sick nights, and sorrowful days for sin, you
will never go up and down seeking an interest in the blood of this sacrifice,
with tears.

But Reader, if ever this be thy condition, then will thou know the worth of a
Christ. Then thou will have a value for the blood of sprinkling. As I remember
it is storied of our Crook-back Richard, when he was put to a rout in a field
battle, and flying on foot from his pursuing enemies; he cried out, O now (said
he) a Kingdom for a Horse. So will thou cry a Kingdom for a Christ. Ten
thousand Worlds now if I had them, for the blood of sprinkling.

Corollary. 3.
Is Christ your High Priest, Cor. 3.
and is his Priestood so indispensably necessary to your salvation; then freely
acknowledge your utter impotency to reconcile your selves to God, by any thing
you can do, or suffer. And let Christ have the whole glory of your recovery
ascribed to him. It Is highly reasonable, that he that laid down the whole
price, should have the whole praise. If any man think, or say, he could have
made an atonement for himself; he does therein cast no light reproach upon
that profound wisdom, which laid the design of our redemption in the death of
Christ. But of this I have spoken elsewhere. And therefore;

Corollary 4.
Cor. 4.
In the last place I rather choose to persuade you to see your necessity of this
Priest, and his most excellent sacrifice; and accordingly to make use of it.
The best of you have polluted natures, poisoned in the womb with sin; those
natures have need of this sacrifice. They must have the benefit of this blood
to pardon and cleanse them, or be eternally damned. Hear me ye that never spent
a tear for the sin of nature; if the blood of Christ be not springled upon your
natures, it had been better for you, that you had been the generation of
beasts, the offspring of Dragons or Toads. They have a contemptible, but not a
vitiated, sinful nature as you have.

Your Actual sins have need of this Priest, and his sacrifice to procure
remission for them. If he take them not away by the blood of his cross, they
can never be taken away. They will lie down with you in the dust. They will
rise with you, and follow you to the Judgment seat; crying we are thy works,
and we will follow thee. All thy repentance and tears, should thou weep as
many tears as there be drops in the Ocean, can never take away sin. Thy duties,
even the best of them, need this sacrifice. It is in the verture thereof that
they are accepted of God. And were it not God had respect to Christ's offering,
he would not regard, or look toward thee, or any of thy duties. Thou could
no more come near God, than thou could approach a devouring fire, or dwell
with everlasting burnings.

Well then, say I need such a Priest every way. Love him in all his offices.
See the goodness of God in providing such a sacrifice for thee. Meat, drink and
air not more necessary, to maintain thy natural life, than the death of Christ
is to give, and maintain thy spiritual life.

O then, let thy soul grow big whilst meditating of the usefulness and
excellency of Christ, which is thus displaied and unfolded in every branch of
the Gospel. And with a deep sense upon thy heart, let thy lips say, blessed be
God, for Jesus Christ.

The TWELFTH Sermon. 12.
SERMON. Opens the excellency of our Highpriests Oblation, being the first act
or part of his Priestly Office.

HEB. X.XIV. For by one offering, he has perfected for ever, them that are
sanctified.


AFter this more general view and consideration of the Priesthood of Christ,
method requires that we come to a nearer, and more particular consideration of
the parts thereof; which are, his Oblation, and Intercession; answerable to the
double office of the High Priest, offering the blood of the Sacrifices without
the holy place, which Typed out Christ's oblation: and then once a year,
bringing the blood before the Lord, into the most holy place; presenting it
before the Lord, and with it sprinkling the mercy-seat, wherein the
intercession of Christ, (the other part, or Act of his Priesthood) was in a
lively manner Typified to us.

My present business is, to open and apply the Oblation of Christ. The
efficacy, and excellency whereof, is excellently illustrated by a comparison
with all other oblations, in the precedent context; and with a singular
Encomium commended to us in these words, Oblat^o Christi unica est, non tantum
specie, sed etiam numero, quia nulla potest esse Oblatio Christi nisi
intercedente morte ipsius eoque falsa est Sacrificii incruentem, and incruentem
distinct^o. Trelcatus Instit. p. 79.
from the singularity of it. It is but one offering, one, not only
specifically, but one numerically considered. But once offered, and never more
to be repeated. For Christ dies no more, Romans 6.9. He also commends it from
the efficacy of it. By it he has perfected, (i. e.) not only purchased a
possibility of salvation, but all that we need to our full perfection. It
brings in a most entire, complete, and perfect righteousness. All that remains
to make us perfectly happy, is but the full application of the benefits
procured by this Oblation, for us. Moreover, it is here commended from the
extensiveness of it. Not being restrained to a few, but applicable to all the
Saints, in all the ages, and places of the world. For this indefinite, them
that are sanctified, is equivalent to a universal; and is as much as if he had
said, to all and every Saint, from the beginning, to the end of the world.
Lastly, He commends it from its perpetuity. It perfects for ever. That is, it
is of everlasting efficacy. It shall abide as fresh, vigorous, and powerful to
the end of the world, as it was the first moment it was offered up. All runs
into this sweet truth,

DOCT. That the Oblation made unto God, Doct.
by Jesus Christ, is of unspeakable value, and everlasting efficacy; to perfect
all them that are, or shall be Sanctified, to the end of the world.
Out of this fountain flow all the excellent blessings that believers either
have, or hope for. Had it not been for this, there had been no such things in
rerum natura as Justification, Adoption, Salvation, etc. peace with God, and
hopes of glory, pardon of sin, and divine acceptance: These and all other our
best mercies, had been but so many entia rationis, mere conceits. A man (as one
says) might have happily imagined such things as these, as he may golden
Mountains, and Rivers of liquid gold, and rocks of Diamonds: but these things
could never have had any real existance extramentem, had not Christ offered up
himself a Sacrifice to God for us. It is the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal spirit, offered up himself without spot to God, that purges the
Conscience from dead works. Heb. 9.14. That is, from the sentence of
condemnation and death, as it is reflected by Conscience, for our works sake.

His appearing before God as our Priest, with such an offering for us; is that
which removes our guilt, and fear together. He appeared, to put away sin, by
the sacrifice of himself. Heb. 9.26. Now, for as much as the point before us,
is of so great weight in it self, and so fundamental to our safety and comfort;
I shall endeavor to give you as distinct and clear an account of it, as can
consist with that brevity, which I must necessarily use. And therefore Reader,
apply thy mind attently to the consideration of this excellent Priest, that
appears before God; and the Sacrifice he offers; with the properties and
adjuncts thereof. The Person before whom he brings, and to whom he offers it.
The Persons for whom he offers, and the end for which this Oblation is made.

First, The Priest that appears before God with an Oblation Sic Oblationes i^
vase mundo offerebantur. Esa 66.20. Ravan.
There were many Priests before him, but none like unto him; either for the
purity of his person, or the perpetuity of his Priesthood. They were sinful
men, and offered for their own sins, as well as the sins of the people. Heb.
5.3. But he was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. Heb. 7.2. He
could stand before God, even in the eye of his Justice, as a Lamb without spot.
Though he made his soul an offering for sin, yet he had done no iniquity, nor
was any guile found in his mouth. Isa. 53.9. And indeed his offering had done
us no good, if the least taint of sin had been found on him. They were mortal
men, that continued not by reason of death, Heb. 7.23. But Christ is a Priest
for ever. Psalm. 110.4.

Secondly, The Oblation or offering he made, was not the Heb. 9.12. And herein
he transcended all other Priests, Bilson. and Fevardentius affirm that Christ
only offered up his body, not his soul upon this weak ground, that if he had
offered both he had not offered one, but two Sacrifices. Against whom the
Learned Parker in his excellent book de d^s (...) urges my text and thus frees
it from that corrupt gloss. Pulchre, quasi boloca stum non unum fuit
Sacrificium quia ex plur bus partibus constabit! -- Sacrificium Christi unicum
dicitur, non in oppositione corporis ad animam, sed in oppositione corporis and
animae, semel Oblati ad multa illa Sacrificia quae non semel, sed multoti^s, in
Lege Mosis offerebantur. Parker de descensu Lib. 111. p. 146.
that he had something of his own to offer. He had a body given him to be at
his own dispose, to this use and purpose. Heb. 10.10. He offered his body; Yea,
not only his body, but his soul was made an offering for sin. Isa. 53.10. We
had made a forfeiture of our souls and bodies by sin, and it was necessary the
Sacrifice of Christ should be answerable to the debt we owed. And when Christ
came to offer his Sacrifice, he stood not only in the capacity of a Priest, but
also in the capacity of a surety; and so his soul stood in the stead of ours,
and his body in the stead of our bodies. Now the excellency of this Oblation
will appear in the following adjuncts, and properties of it. This Oblation
being for the matter of it the soul and body of Jesus Christ; is therefore,

First, Invaluably precious. So the Apostle styles it, 1 Pet. 1.19. Ye were
redeemed (...) with the precious blood of the Son of God. And such it behoved
him to offer. For it being offered as an expiatory Sacrifice, it ought to be
aequivalent in its own intrinsic value, to all the souls and bodies that were
to be redeemed by it. And so it was, and more also; for there was a redundancy
of value, an overplus of merit, which went to make a purchase for the redeemed;
as will be opened in its place. So that as one rich-Diamond, is more worth than
a thousand Pebbles; one piece of Gold, than a many Counters; so the soul and
body of one Christ, is much more excellent, than all the souls and bodies in
the world.

And yet, I dare not affirm as some do, that by reason of the infinite
pretiousness of Christ's blood; one drop thereof had been sufficient to have
redeemed the whole world: Id ^olu^ rationem poenae babere potest, quod
infligitur a judice legi convenienter* Non convenit aut^m legi quae mortem
denunciat, ^t ob ejus violationem id infligat^r tantum ex quo guttula sanguin^s
manet. Joh. Camero. p. 364.
for if one drop had been enough, why was all the rest, even to the last drop
shed? Was God cruel, to exact more from him than was needful and sufficient?
Besides we must remember, that the passions of Christ which were inflicted on
him as the curse of the Law; these only are the passions which are sufficient
for our redemption from the curse of the Law; now, it was not a drop of blood,
but death which was contained in the curse. This therefore was necessary to be
inflicted. But surely as none but God can estimate the weight and evil of sin,
so none but he can comprehend the worth and pretiousness of the blood of
Christ, shed to expiate it. And being so infinitely precious a thing which was
offered up to God, it must,

Secondly, Needs be a most complete and alsufficient Oblation, fully to expiate
the sins of all, for whom it was offered, in all ages of the world. The virtue
of this Sacrifice reaches backward as far as Adam, and reaches forward to the
last person of of the Elect springing from him. That the efficacy of it thus
reached back to Adam, is plain; for on the account thereof he is styled the
Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13.8.

And to the same sense a Judicious Expositor understands those words of Christ.
Virtus and gratia Christi, q^ate tu^ mundi redemptor est: omnium aetatum
communis f^i^. Calv. in Loc.
Joh. 8.58. before Abraham was I am. And look as the Sun at midday extends his
light and influence, not only forward toward the West; but also backward
toward the East, where he arose: so did this most efficacious Sacrifice reach
all the Elect in the virtue of it, who died before Christ came in the flesh.
Causa physica precedit eff^c^u^ s^um tempo^pore, non ite^ ca^sa mo alis.
Came^onis opera. p. 361.
It is therefore but a vain cavil that some make against the satisfaction of
Christ to render it needless; when they say many were saved without it, even as
many as were saved before the death of Christ. For they say, the effect cannot
be before the cause, which is true of physical, but not of moral causes; and
such was Christ's satisfaction. As for Example, a captive is freed out of prison
from the time that his surety undertakes for him, and promises his Ransom; here
the Captive is actually delivered, though the ransom that delivered him, be not
yet actually paid. So it was in this case. Christ had engaged to the Father to
satisfy for them, and upon that security they were delivered.

And the virtue of this Oblation not only reaches those believers that lived
and died before Christ's day; N^n^ servat^r no ^est ita, ut olin non fu^rit;
atque ut non ^it servator in aeternum. Camer* myroth^^. p 337.
but it extends it self forward, to the end of the world. Hence Heb. 13.8.
Christ is said to be the same, yesterday, to day, and for ever; that is, he is
not so a Savior to us that now live, as that he was not their Savior also,
that believed in him before us from the beginning. Nor yet so a Savior both to
them and us, as that he shall not be the same to all that shall believe on him,
to the worlds end.

To the same sense are those words, Heb. 11.40. rightly Paraphrased, God having
povided some better thing for us, that they without us, should not be made
perfect. q. d. God has appointed the accomplishment of the promise of sending
the Messiah, to be in the last times. That they ( viz. that lived before
Christ) should not be perfected; D^^on ^n Loc.
that is justified, and saved, by anything done in their time, but by looking
to our time, and Christ's satisfaction made therein; whereby they and we are
perfected together. No tract of time can wear out the virtue of this eternal
Sacrifice. It is as fresh vigorous and potent now, as the first hour it was
offered. And though he actually offers it no more, yet he virtually continues
it by his intercession now in Heaven. For there he is still a Priest. And
therefore about sixty years after his Assention, when he gave the Revelation to
John, he appears to him in his Priestly garments. Rev. 1.13. Clothed in a
garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle: in
illusion to the Priestly Ephod, and curious girdle.

And as the virtue of this Oblation reaches backward, and forward, to all ages,
and to all believers, so to all the sins of all Believers, which are fully
purged and expiated by it. This no other Oblation could do. The legal
Sacrifices were no real expiations, but rather remembrances of sins. Heb. 9.9,
12. Heb. 10.3. And all the virtue they had, consisted in their Typical relation
to this Sacrifice. Gal. 3.23. Heb. 9.13. And separate from it were altogether
weak, unprofitable, and insignificant things. Heb. 7.18. but this blood
cleanses from all sins, 1 Ioh. 1.7. all sin, originating, or originated, or
actual flowing from them both. It expiates all fully, without exception, and
finally, without revocation. So that by his being made sin for us, we are made
not only righteous, but the righteousness of God in him. 2 Cor. 5.21.

Thirdly, Odoratus Deo tribultur quo itidem Dei (...) complacencia, and gratia,
denotatur. Sicut odore bono homo, recrea^^r; coque delectatur -- pertinet h^c
appellatio (...) odor quietis seu suavitatis quae crebro Sacrificiis^ Deo
oblatis trib^itur. Exodus 29.^, 25. Levit. 1.9. S. Glats. Philolog. Sacra.
and Lastly, to name no more; being so precious in it self, and so efficacious
to expiate sin, it must needs be a most grateful Oblation to the Lord, highly
pleasing and delightful in his eyes. And so indeed it is said. Ephesians. 5.2. He
gave himself for us, an offering, and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling
savor. Not that God took any delight or content in the bitter sufferings of
Christ, simply and in themselves considered; but with relation to the end for
which he was offered, even our redemption and salvation.

Hence arose the delight and pleasure God had in it: this made him take
pleasure in bruising him, Isa. 53.10. God smelt a savor of rest in this
Sacrifice. The meaning is, that as men are offended with a stench, and their
stomachs rise at it; and are on the contrary delighted with sweet odors and
fragrancies, so the blessed God speaking after the manner of men, is offended
and filled with loathing and abhorrence by our sins; but infinitely pleased and
delighted in the offering of Christ for them, which came up as an odor of a
sweet smelling savor to him, whereof the costly perfumes under the Law, were
Types and shadows. This was the Oblation.

Thirdly, This Oblation he brings before God, and to him he offers it up. So
speaks the Apostle Heb. 9.14. through the eternal As Christ sustained the
capacity of a surety, so God of a Creditor; who exacted satisfaction from him.
That is, he required from him, as our surety the penalty due to us, for our
sin. And so Christ had to do immediately with God, yea with a God infinitely
wronged, and incensed by sin against us. To this incensed Majesty, Christ our
Priest approaches, as to a devouring fire, with his Sacrifice.

Fourthly, The persons for whom, and in whose stead he offered Docc^t ^he^log^
Christum p^o omnibus sufficienter, pro Electis duntaxat Efficaciter mort^um
esse. Camero ubi supra.* p. 535.
was the whole number of Gods Elect, which were given him of the Father;
neither more, nor less. So speak the Scriptures, He laid down his life, for the
sheep. Joh. 10.15. For the Church. Act. 20.28. For the Children of God, Joh.
11.50, 51, 52. It is confessed there is sufficiency of virtue in this Sacrifice
to redeem the whole world; and on that account some Divines affirm, he is
called the Savior of the world, Joh. 40.42. and alibi. We acknowledge also,
that he purchased the services of others, beside the Elect, to be useful to
them, as they many ways are. Mr. Strong.
In which sense others take those Scriptures that speak so universally of the
extent of his death. We also acknowledge that the Elect being scattered in all
parts, and among all ranks of men in the world, and unknown to those that are
to tender Jesus Christ to men by the Preaching of the Gospel: The style of the
Gospel (as it was necessary) is by such indefinite expressions, suited to the
general tenders they are to make of him: But that the efficacy, and saving
virtue of this alsufficient Sacrifice is coextended with Gods Election, so that
they all, and no others can, or, shall reap the special benefits of it; is too
clear in the Scriptures, to be denied. Ephesians. 5.23. Ioh. 17.2, 9, 19, 20. Ioh.
10.26, 27, 28. 1 Timothy 4.10.

Fifthly, The design and end of this Oblation was to atone, pacify, or
satisfaction for the sins of these his Elect. So speaks the Apostle Col. 1.20.
And having made peace, through the blood of his cross; by him to reconcile all
things unto himself: by him I say, whether they be things in earth, or things
in Heaven. So 2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.
Reconciliation is the making up of that breach caused by sin, between us and
God; and restoring us again to his favor and friendship. For this end Christ
offered up himself to God. I say, not for this end only, but more especially,
hence it is called: (...) a propitiation, and so the Seaventy render that place,
Number. 15. (...) the propitiating Ram. But here I would not be mistaken, as
though the reconciliation were made only between us and God the Father, by the
blood of the Cross: for we are reconciled by it to the whole Trinity. Every sin
being against the divine Majesty, it must needs follow, that the three persons
having the same divine Essence, must be all offended by the commission; and so
all reconciled by the expiation, and remission of the same. But reconciliation
is said to be with the Father, because though the works of the Trinity ad extra
be undivided, and what one does all do; and what is done to one, is done to
all; yet by this form and manner of expression (as a learned man well observes)
the Scriptures point out the proper offices of each person. Zanch* de tribius
Elohim.
The Father receives us into favor, the Son mediates and gives the ransom,
which procures it, the Spirit applies and seals this to the persons and hearts
of believers. However, being reconciled to the Father, we are also reconciled
to the Son and Spirit, as they are one God, in three persons. And if it be
objected, that then Christ offered up a Sacrifice, or laid down a price to
reconcile us to himself: I shall more fairly and directly meet with and
satisfy that objection, when I come to speak of Christ's satisfaction, which is
one of the principal fruits of this his excellent Oblation. For present this
may inform you about the nature, and precious worth of Christ's Oblation. The
uses whereof follow, in these five practical Inferences.

Inference. 1.
Hence it follows, that actual Believers are fully freed from the gilt of their
sins, Infer. 1.
and shall never more come under condemnation.

The Obligation of sin is perfectly abolished by the virtue of this Sacrifice.
When Christ became our Sacrifice, he both bare, and bare away our sins. (...)
attollere vel sursum far. Sic Syriac (...) julavit and sursum tulit Beza
Grec. Annot. in 1 Pet. 2.24.
First, It was laid upon him, then expiated by him. So much is imported in that
word, Heb. 9.28. Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. To bear, the
word is a full and emphatical word: signifying not only to bear, but to bear
away. So Joh. 1.29. behold the Lamb of God (...) that takes away the sins of
the world. Not only declaratively, or by way of manifestation to the
Conscience; but, really making a purgation of sin, as it is in Heb. 1.3. (...)
word for word, a purgation being made, and not only declared. Now how great a
mercy is this, that by him, all that believe should be justified from all
things; from which they could not be justified by the Law of Moses? Act. 13.39.
What shall we call this grace? Surely we should do somewhat more than admire
it, (...)
and faint under the sense of such a mercy. Blessed is he whose transgression
is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Psalm. 32.1. or Oh the blessedness, or
felicities of him that is pardoned! who can express the mercies, comforts,
happiness of such a state as this? Reader, let me beg thee, if thou be one of
this pardoned number, to look over thy cancelled bonds, and see what vast sums
are remitted to thee. Remember what thou wast in thy natural estate; possibly
thou wast in that black bill, 1 Cor. 6.3. what, and yet pardoned! fully and
finally pardoned, and that freely as to any hand that thou had in the
procurement of it! what can thou do less than fall down at the feet of free
grace, and kiss those feet that moved so freely toward so vile a sinner? It is
not long since that thy iniquities were upon thee, and thou pinest away in
them. Their guilt could by no creature power be separated from thy soul. Now
they are removed from thee, as far as the East from the West; Psalm. 103.11. So
that when the East and West, which are the two opposite points of Heaven meet;
then thy soul, and its guilt may meet again together.

O the unspeakable efficacy of Christ's Sacrifice! which extends to all sins! 1 John 1.7. the blood of Christ cleanses from all sins, sins past, and present
without exception. And some Divines of good note affirm, all sins to come also,
for says Mr. Paul Baines original sin, in which all future sins are, as fruits
in the root, is pardoned, and if these were not pardoned, they would void and
irritate former pardons. And lastly it would derogate from the most plenary
satisfaction of Christ. But the most say, and I think truly, that all the past
sins of Believers, are pardoned without revocation. All their present sins,
without exception, but not their sins to come by way of anticipation: and yet
for them there is a pardon of course, which is applied on their repentance, and
application of Christ's blood; so that none of them shall make void former
pardons. O let these things slide sweetly to thy melting heart.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
From this Oblation Christ made of himself to God for our sins, we infer the
inflexible severity of divine Justice, which could be no other way diverted
from us, and appeased but by the blood of Christ. If Christ had not presented
himself to God for us, Justice would not have spared us. And if he do appear
before God as our surety, it will not spare him, Romans 8.32. He spared not his
Son, but delivered him up to death for us all. If forbearance might have been
expected from any, surely it might from God, who is very pitiful and full of
tender mercy. Jam. 5.11. yet God in this case spared not. If one might have
expected sparing mercy and abatement from any, surely Christ might most of all
expect it from his own Father; yet you hear God spared not his own Son.
Sparing-mercy is the lowest degree of mercy; yet it was denied to Christ. He
abated him not a minute of the time appointed for his suffering, nor one degree
of wrath he was to bear. Nay, though in the Garden Christ fell upon the ground,
and sweet clodders of blood; and in that unparalled Agony scrued up his
spirit to the highest intention, in that pitiful cry, Father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass: and though he brake out upon the Cross, in that
heart rending complaint, my God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Yet no
abatement. Justice will not bend in the least; but having to do with him on
this account, resolves to fetch its pennyworths out of his blood. If this be
so, what is the case of thy soul Reader, if thou be a man or woman, that have
no interest in this Sacrifice? For, if these things be done (in Christ) a green
tree, what will be done (to thee) the dry tree? (...) ita Theophil^ctus pull
herime (...).
Luke 23.31. That is, if God so deal with me, that am not only innocent, but
like a green and fruitful tree, full of all delectable fruits of holiness; yet
if the fire of his indignation thus seize upon me; what will be your condition,
that are both barren, and guilty; void of all good fruit, and full of all
unrighteousness, and so like dry seary wood, are fitted as fuel to the fire?
Consider with thy self man, how can thou imagine thou can support that
infinite wrath that Christ grapled with in the room of Gods Elect? He had the
strength of a Deity to support him, Esa. 42.1. behold my servant whom I uphold.
He had the fullness of the Spirit, to prepare him. Isa. 61.11. He had the
ministry of an Angel, who came post from Heaven, to relieve him in his agony.
Luke 22.43. He had the ear of his Father, to hear him; for he cried, and was
heard in that he feared. Heb. 5.7. He was assured of the victory, before the
combat; he knew he should be Justified: Isa. 50.8. And yet for all this was
sore amazed, and sorrowful even to death: and his heart was melted like wax, in
the midst of his bowels: If the case stood thus with Christ, notwithstanding
all these advantages he had to bear the wrath of God for a little time: How
do thou think, a poor worm as thou art, to dwell with everlasting burnings,
or contend with devouring fire? Luther saw ground enough for what he said, Nolo
D^um absolutum.
when he cried out, I will have nothing to do with an absolute God; (i. e.)
with a God out of Christ. For, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God. Woe and alas for evermore, to that man that meets a just and
righteous God, without a Mediator. Whoever thou art that read these lines, I
beseech thee by the mercies of God, by all the regard and love thou have to thy
own soul, neglect not time, but make quick and sure work of it. Get an interest
in this Sacrifice quickly, what else will be thy state* when vaste ternity
opens to swallow thee up? What will thou do man, when thine eye-strings and
heart strings are breaking? O what a fearful scriech will thy Conscience give,
when thou art presented before the dreadful God; and no Christ to screen thee
from his indignation! Happy is that man who can say in a dying hour, as one
did; who being desired a little before his dissolution to give his friends a
little taste of his present hopes, and the grounds of them; cheerfully answered,
Mr. William L^ford.
I will let you know how it is with me, then stretching forth his hand said:

Here is the grave, the wrath of God, and devouring flames, the just punishment
of sin on the one side; and here am I, a poor sinful soul on the other side;
but this is my comfort, the Covenant of grace which is established upon so many
sure promises, has salved all. There is an act of oblivion passed in Heaven: I
will forgive their iniquities, and their sins will I remember no more. This is
the blessed privilege of all within the Covenant, among whom I am one. O it is
sweet at all times, especially at such a time, to see the reconciled face of
God through Jesus Christ; and hear the voice of peace, through the blood of the
Cross.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
Has Christ offered up himself a Sacrifice to God for us, then let us improve
in every condition this Sacrifice, and labor to get hearts duly affected with
such a sight as faith can give us of it. Whatever the condition or complaint of
any Christian is, the beholding the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the
world, may give him strong support, and sweet relief. Do you complain of the
hardness of your hearts, and want of love to Christ; behold him as offered up
to God for you; and such a sight (if any in the world will do it) will melt
your hard hearts. Zech. 12.10. They shall look upon me whom they have pierced,
and shall mourn. It is reported of Johannes Milius that he was never observed
to speak of Christ, and his sufferings, but his eyes would drop. Art thou too
little touched, and unaffected with the evil of sin? is it thy complaint
Christian, that thou can not make sin bear so heard upon thy heart as thou
would? consider but what thou have now read; realize this Sacrifice by faith,
and try what efficacy there is in it to make sin for ever bitter as death to
thy soul. Suppose thy own Father had been stabbed to the heart with such a
knife, and his blood were upon it; would thou delight to see, or endure to
use that knife any more? Sin is the knife that stabbed Christ to the heart: this
shed his blood* Surely you can never make light of that, which lay so heavy
upon the soul and body of Jesus Christ.

Or is your heart pressed down even to despondency, under guilt of sin? So that
you cry how can such a sinner as I be pardoned: My sin is greater than can be
forgiven. Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world.
Remember that no sin can stand before the Efficacy of his blood. 1 John 1.7.
the blood of Jesus cleanses from all sin. This Sacrifice makes unto God full
satisfaction.

Are you at any time staggering through unbelief? Filled with unbelieving
suspicions of the promises? Look hither and you shall see them all ratified,
and established in the blood of the cross. So that hills and mountains shall
sooner start from their own bases and centers, than one tittle of the promise
fail. Heb. 9.17, 18, 19.

Do you at any time find your hearts fretting, disquieted, and impatient under
every petty cross and trial: See how quietly Christ your Sacrifice came to the
Altar. How meekly and patiently he stood under all the wrath of God and men
together. This will silence, convince, and shame you.

In a word, Here you will see so much of the grace of God, and love of Christ,
in providing and becoming a Sacrifice for you; you will see God taking
vengeance upon sin, but sparing the sinner. You will see Christ standing as the
body of sin alone, for he was made sin for us, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him. That whatever corruption burdens, this in the
believing application will support. Whatever grace be defective, this will
revive it.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
Sermon. 13.
The THIRTEENTH SERMON. Opens the Intercession of Christ, our High Priest, being
the second Act or Part of Christ's Priestly Office.

HEB. VII.XXV. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost, that
come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives, to make intercession for them.


HAving dispatched the first part or Act of Christ's Priesthood, consisting in
his Oblation; we come to the other branch of it, consisting in his
Intercession: which is nothing else but the vertual continuation of his
offering once made on earth. That being medium reconciliationis, the means of
reconciling; Redemptio quam operatus est, fundamentum sit intercessionis, -- ac
propterea redemptio^em, and intercessionem tanquan duas individuas Christi
Sacrificii parts Scriptura commemorare solet. Ravenella ad verbum intercedere.
this, medium applicationis, the way and means of his applying to us the
benefits purchased by it.

This second part or branch of his Priesthood, was Typified by the Highpriests
entering with the blood of the Sacrifice, and sweet incense into the holy place.
Levit. 16.12, 13, 14. And he shall take the censer full of burning coals of
fire from off the Altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense,
beaten small, and bring it within the vail; and he shall put the incense upon
the fire, before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy
seat that is upon the Testimony, that he die not. And he shall take the blood
of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat Eastward,
etc. Christ's offering himself on earth answered to the killing of the Sacrifice
without; and his entering into Heaven, there to intercede, was that which
answered to the Priest going with blood, and his hands full of incense within
the vail: So that this is a part, yea, a special part of Christ's Priesthood,
and so necessary to it; that if he had not done this, all his work on earth had
signified nothing, nor had he been a Priest; that is, a complete and perfect
Priest, if he had remained on earth. Heb. 8.4. Because the very design and end
of sheding his blood on earth had been frustrated, which was to carry it before
the Lord into Heaven. So that this is the principal perfective part of the
Priesthood. He acted the first part on earth, in a state of deep abasement, in
the form of a servant; but he Acts this in glory, whereinto he is taken up,
that he may follow on his design in dying, and give the work of our Salvation
its last completing Act. So much is imported in this Scripture which tells us,
by reason hereof he is able to save to the uttermost, etc.

The words contain an encouragement to believers, to come to God in the way of
faith; drawn from the intercession of Christ in Heaven for them. In which you
may take notice of these three principal parts, First, The quality of the
persons here encouraged, who are described by a direct act of faith, as poor
recumbents, that are going out of themselves to God by faith; but conscious of
great unworthiness in themselves, and thence apt to be discouraged. Secondly,
The encouragement propounded to such believers, drawn from the ability of Jesus
Christ in whose name they go to the Father, to save them to the uttermost: (i.
e.) fully, perfectly, completely. (...) ^ifferunt (...), subjecta mat^ria non
differunt Nam (...) pro^rie perpetuitatem temporis significat, (...) non ^anc
solam, verum etiam omnimodam ^^^fectionem. Came^^^.
For so this Emphatical word, (...) signifies. The saving us wholly, thoroughly,
completely, and altogether: giving our Salvation its last act, and complement.
Thirdly, The ground or reason of this his saving ability. Seeing he ever lives
to make intercession: (i. e.) he has not only offered up his blood to God upon
the tree, as a full price to purchase pardon and grace for believers, but lives
in Heaven and that for ever to apply unto us in the way of intercession, all
the fruits, blessings, and benefits that that precious blood of his deserves,
and has procured as a price for them. The words thus opened, that point I
shall single out from among many that lie in them, as most suitable to my
design and purpose, is this.


DOCT. That Jesus our High Priest lives for ever, Doct.
in the capacity of a potent intercessor in Heaven for believers.
Here we will enquire, First, what it is for Christ to be an intercessor.
Secondly, By what acts he performs that work in Heaven. Thirdly, Whence the
potency and prevalency of his intercession is. Fourthly, and Lastly, How he
lives for ever to make intercession for us.

First, What it is for Christ to be an intercessor for us. To intercede in
general, is to go betwixt two parties to entreat, argue, and plead with one,
for the other. And of this there are two sorts. First, ex charitate, ut
fratres. That whereby one Christian prays and pleads with God for another. 1 Timothy 2.1. Secondly, Ex officio, mediatorio, that whereby Christ, as an act of
office, presents himself before God, to request for us. Betwixt these two is
this difference; that the former is performed not in our own, but another
name; we can tender no request to God immediately, or for our own sake, either
for our selves, or for others. Joh. 16.23. Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father
in my name, he will give it you. But the latter which is proper to Christ, is
an Intercession with God for us, in his own name, and upon the account of his
proper merit. The one is a private act of Charity, the other a public act of
Office. And so he is our Advocate or Court-friend, as Satan our accuser, or
Court-adversary. Satan is (...), one that charges us before God. 1 Pet. 5.8.
And continually endeavors to make breaches between us and God. Christ is
(...), our Attorney, Advocate or Lidger, that pleads for us and continues peace
and friendship between us, and God. 1 John 2.2. If any man sin, we have an
advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

And thus to make intercercession, is the peculiar and incommunicable
prerogative of Jesus Christ. None but he can go in his own name to God. And in
that sense we are to understand that place, Ezech. 44.2, 3. Then said the Lord
unto me, this gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall
enter in by it: because the Lord the God of Israel has entered in by it,
therefore it shall be shut. It is for the Prince, the Prince he shall sit in
it, to eat bread before the Lord, etc. The great broad gate, called here the
Princes gate, signifies that abundant and direct entrance that Christ had into
Heaven, by his own merits and in his own name; See D^odati and our English
Annot. in Loc.
this faith the Lord shall be shut, no man shall enter in by it; all other men
must come thither as it were by collateral or side doors, which looked all
toward the Altar, viz. by virtue of the Mediator, and through the benefit of
his death imputed to them.

And yet though God has for ever shut up and barred this way to all the
children of men, telling us that no man shall ever have access to him in his
own name, as Christ the Prince had: How do some notwithstanding, strive to
force open the Princes gate? So do they that found the intercession of Saints
upon their own works and merits; Pet. Lombard Lib. 4. did. 45.
thereby robbing Christ of his peculiar glory. but all that so approach God,
approach a devouring fire. Christ only in the virtue of his blood, thus comes
before him; to make intercession for us.

Secondly, We will inquire wherein the Intercession of Christ Quid v^o sibi
ve^it hic (...), pro nobis and (...), videndum est. Re^^icit ad (...)
portificis veteris, qui i gressus intra velum, d^cebatur apparere in consfectu
Dei. pro populo; quatenus se cum sanguine h^rei piacularis presentabat Deo, and
precibus suis supplex orabat, u^ propter sanguinem non illum hircin^m; sed il o
representatum, Christi Mediatoris fundendum, propitius esset peccatis suis, and
populi. Doct. Pereus in loc.
or by what acts he performs this Glorious Office there. And the Scriptures
place it in three things.

First, In his presenting himself before the Lord in our names, and upon our
accounts. So we read in Heb. 9.24. Christ is entered into Heaven it self, now to
appear in the presence of God for us. The Apostle manifestly alludes to the
Highpriests appearing in the Holy of Holies, which was the figure of Heaven,
presenting to the Lord the names of the twelve Tribes of Israel, which were on
his breast, and shoulders. Exodus 28.9, 12, 28, 29. to which the Church is
supposed to allude, in that request Cant. 8.6. set me as a seal upon thine
heart, as a seal upon thine arm. Now the very sight of Christ, our High Priest
in Heaven, prevails exceedingly with God, and ^urns away his displeasure from
us. As when God looks upon the Rainbow, which is the sign of the Covenant; he
remembers the earth in mercy. So when he looks on Christ, his heart must needs
be toward us upon his account: and therefore in Rev. 4.3. Christ is compared
to a Rainbow, encompassing the Throne.

Secondly, Christ performs his intercession-work in Heaven, not by a naked
appearing in the presence of God only, but also by presenting his blood, and
all his sufferings to God, as a moving plea on our account. Voluntate ac
desiderio s o ardenti qu^nadmodum in terris antea secerat, ita and i^ Coelis
apud patrem mor^is s^a vim, atque ^fficatiam novis ad salutem appli^a^i
postul^t. Synops purior. Theol. p. 346.
Whether he make any proper oral intercession there, as he did on earth, is not
so clear; some incline to it, and think it is countenanced by Zech. 1.12, 13.
where Christ our intercessor presents a proper vocal request to the Father, in
the behalf of his people. Saying, O Lord of Hosts how long will thou not have
mercy on Jerusalem, and on the Cities of Judah, against whom thou have had
indignation these threescore and ten years; and the Lord answered him with good
and comfortable words. And so, Act. 2.23. As soon as he came to Heaven, he is
said (and that as the first fruits of his Intercession) to obtain the promise
of the Holy Ghost. But sure I am, an Interceding voice, is by an usual
prosopopeia attributed to his blood; which in Heb. 12.24. is said to speak
better things than the blood of Abel. Now Abels blood, and so Christ's, do cry
unto God, as the hire of the Laborers unjustly detained; or the whole
creation, which is in bondage through our sins, are said to cry and groan in
the ears of the Lord. Iam. 5.4. Romans 8.22. not vocally, but efficatiously. A
rare illustration of this Efficatious Intercession of Christ in Heaven, we have
in that famous story of Amyntas, who appeared as an Advocate for his brother
Aechylus, who was strongly accused, and very likely to be condemned to die. Now
Amyntas having performed great services, and merited highly of the
Commonwealth; in whose service one of his hands was cut off in the Field:
Aelian. Hist. lib 5 cap. 19.
he comes into the Court on his brothers behalf, and said nothing; but only
lifted up his arm, and showed them cubitum sine manu, an arm without an hand;
which so moved them without a word speaking, that they freed his brother
immediately.

And thus if you look into Revel. 5.6. you shall see in what posture Christ is
represented visionally there, as standing between God and us. And I beheld and
lo in the midst of the Throne, and four beasts; and in the midst of the Elders
stood a Lamb, as it had been slain. (i. ^.) bearing in his glorified body, the
marks of his death, De^da^i i^ Loc.
and sacrifice. Those wounds he received for our sins on earth, are as it were
still fresh bleeding in Heaven. A moving and prevailing argument it is with the
Father, to give out the mercies he pleads for.

Thirdly, and Lastly; He presents the prayers of his Saints to God, with his
merits; and desires that they may for his sake be granted. He causes a cloud of
incense to ascend before God, with them. Revel. 8.3. All these were excellently
Typed out by the going in of the High Priest before the Lord, with the names of
the Children of Israel on his breast; with the blood of the Sacrifice; and his
hands full of incense, as the Apostle explains them in Heb. 7. and Heb. 9.

Thirdly, And that this Intercession of Christ is most potent, successful, and
prevalant with God, will be evinced both from the

First, our Intercessor in the Heavens is every way able and fit for the work,
he is engaged in there. What ever is desirable in an Advocate, is in him
eminently. It is necessary that he who undertakes to plead the cause of
another, especially if it be weighty and intricate should be wise, faithful,
tenderhearted, and one that concerns himself in the success of his business.
Our Advocate Christ wants no wisdom, to manage his work. He is the wisdom of
God; yea only wise, Jude 25. There Is much folly in the best of our duties, we
know not how to press an argument home with God; but Christ has the art of it.
Our business is in a wise hand. He is no less faithful, than wise; therefore he
is called a faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God. Heb. 2.17. He
assures us we may safely trust our concerns with him. Joh. 14.2. In my Fathers
house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. Q. D. do you
think I will deceive you? Men may cheat you, but I will not: your own hearts
may, and daily do deceive you; but so will not I. And for tender heartedness,
and sensible resentments of our conditions* there is none like him. Heb. 4.15.
For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are; yet without sin. We
have not one that cannot sympathize, (...) Though he cannot weep, or grieve now
as he did on earth, yet he can love now, as much as ever he loved: and
therefore he looks down from Heaven upon every particular m^mber. He sees that
this man want^ this grace, and that man wants that; and the other is in danger
of this corruption, or that temp^ati^n. And i^ daily caryi^g on the cure. You
see not your Physician, he stands out of your sight, but he sees you, and it
is he that does all f^r you, that is done. ^^xters Treatise of Co^version.
so it is in the Greek: and on purpose that he might be the better able to
sympathize with us, he came as near to our conditions, as the holiness of his
nature could permit. He suffered himself to be in all points tempted like as we
are, sin only excepted.

And then for his concernment, and interest in the success of his suit; he not
only reckons, but has really made it his own interest. Yea, more his own, than
it is ours. For now by reason of the mystical union, all our wants and troubles
are his. Ephesians. 1.23. Yea, his own glory and compleatness as mediator, is deeply
interessed in it. And therefore we need not doubt but he will use all care, and
diligence in that work. If you say so he may, and yet not speed for all that:
for it depends on the fathers grant. True, but then,

Secondly, Consider the great interest he has in the Father, with whom he so
intercedes. Christ is his dear Son, Col. 1.13. the beloved of his soul, Ephesians.
1.6. betwixt him and the Father with whom he intercedes; there is an unity not
only of nature, but will; and so he always hears him. Ioh. 11.42. Yea, and he
said to this his dear Son, when he came first to Heaven; Ask of me, and I will
give thee Psalm. 2.8. moreover,

Thirdly, He must needs speed in his suit, if you consider the nature of his
intercession, which is Just and reasonable for the matter; urgent and continual
for the manner of it: the matter of his request is most equal. What he desires
is not desired gratis, or upon terms unbecoming the holiness and righteousness
of God to grant. He desires no more, but what he has deserved, and given a
valuable consideration to the Father for. And so the Justice of God does not
only oppose, but furthers and pleads for the granting and fulfilling his
requests.

Here you must remember that the Father is under a covenant-tye, and bond to do
what he asks; for Christ having fully performed the work on his part* the
mercies he intercedes for are as due, as the hire of the labourer is, when the
work is faithfully done. And as the matter is just, so the manner of his
intercession is urgent, and continual. How importunate a suitor he is, may be
easily gathered from that specimen or handsel given of it in Ioh. 17. and for
the constancy of it, my text tells us, he ever lives to make Intercession. It Is
his great business in Heaven, and he follows it close. And to close all,

Fourthly, Consider who they are for whom he makes Intercession. The friends of
God. The children of God. Those that the Father himself loves, and his heart is
propense, and ready enough to grant the best and greatest of mercies to; which
is the meaning of Ioh. 16.26, 27. the Father himself loves you. And it must
needs be so, for the first corner stone of all these mercies was laid by the
Father himself in his most free election: He also delivered his Son for us, and
how shall he not with him, freely give us all things? Romans 8.32. So then, there
can remain no doubt upon a considering heart; but Christ is a prevalent and
successful Intercessor in Heaven. There only remains one thing more to be
satisfied, and that is.

Fourthly, In what sense he is said to live for ever to make intercession.
Shall he then be always at his work? Employed in begging new favors for us to
eternity? How then shall the people of God be perfect in Heaven, if there be
need of Christ's Intercession to eternity for them?

I answer, by distinguishing the essence, and substance of Christ's offices,
from the way and manner of Administration. In the first sense it is eternal,
for his mediatory Kingdom, as to the essence of it, is to abide for ever.
Christ shall never cease to be a Mediator. The Church shall never want an Head.
For of his Kingdom there shall be no end, Luke 1.33. However, Christ as
Mediator, being employed in a kind of subordinate way, 1 Cor. 3.23. when he
shall have accomplished that design, for which he became a Mediator: then shall
he deliver up the Kingdom (in the sense we spoke before) to the Father, and so
God shall be all in all, 1 Cor. 15.24. Then shall the divinity of Christ which
was so empty and obscured in his undertaking this temporary dispensatory
Kingdom, be more gloriously manifested, by the full possession, use and
enjoyment of that natural, divine, eternal Kingdom, which belongs to all three
co-essential, and coequal persons, reigning with the same Power, Majesty and
glory in the unity of the divine essence; and common Acts, in all and over all;
infinitely, and immutably for ever.

And so Christ continues to be our Mediator, and yet that affords no argument,
that our happiness shall be incomplete: but rather argues the perfection of the
Church, which thenceforth shall be governed no more as now it is, nor have any
further use of Ordinances; but shall be ruled more immediately, gloriously,
triumphantly and ineffably in the world to come. The substance of his
mediatorship is not changed, but the manner of the administration only.

Use 1.
Use 1.
Does Christ live for ever in Heaven to present his blood to God in the way of
intercession for believers? How sad then is their case, that have no interest
in Christ's blood; but instead of its pleading for them cries to God against
them, as the despisers and abusers of it! Every unbeliever despises it. The
Apostate treads it underfoot. He that is an intercessor for some, will be an
accuser of others. To be guilty of a man's blood, is sad; but to have the blood
of Jesus accusing, and crying to God against a soul, is unspeakably terrible.
Surely when he shall make inquisition for blood, when the day of his vengeance
is come, he will make it appear by the Judgments he will execute, that this is
a sin never to be expiated; but vengeance shall pursue the sinner to the bottom
of Hell. Ah what do men and women do, in rejecting the gracious offers of
Christ! What, tread upon a Savior! and cast contempt by unbelief and hardness
of heart upon their only remedy! I remember I have read of an harlot that
killed her child, and said that it smiled upon her when she went to stab it.
Sinner, does not Christ smile upon thee, yearn upon thee in the Gospel, and
will thou as it were stab him to the heart, by thine infideli^y! Woe, and alas
for that man, against whom this blood cries in Heaven.

Does Christ live for ever to make intercession; Hence let believers f^tch

and draw encouragement against all the causes and grounds of their fears, and
troubles. For surely this answers them all.

First, Hence let them be encouraged against all their sinful infirmities, and
lamented weaknesses. It Is confessed, these are sad things; they grieve the
spirit of God, sadden your own hearts, cloud your evidences; but having such an
High Priest in Heaven, can never be your ruin. 1 John 2.1, 2. My little
children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not: And if any man sin,
we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. [My little
children] children, especially little children; when first beginning to take
the foot, are apt to stumble at every straw. So are raw, young, and
unexperienced Christians; but what if they do? Why though it must be far from
them to take encouragement so to do, from Christ and his intercession; yet if
by surprizal, they so sin, let them not be utterly discouraged; for we have an
Advocate. He stops whatever plea may be brought in against us by the Devil, or
the Law; and answers all by his satisfaction. He gets out fresh pardons for new
sins. And this Advocate is with [the Father] he does not say with his Father,
though that had been a singular support in it self, nor yet with our Father,
which is a sweet encouragement singly considered, but with [the Father] which
takes in both to make the encouragement full. Remember ye that are cast down
under the sense of sin, that Jesus your friend in the Court above, is able to
save to the uttermost. Which is as one calls it, a reaching word; and extends
it self so far that thou can not look beyond it. Let thy soul be set on the
highest mount, Goodwins Triumph. p. 263.
that any creature was ever yet set upon; and enlarged to take in view the most
spacious prospect both of sin, and misery, and difficulties of being saved;
that ever yet any poor humble soul did cast within it self; yea, join to these
all the hindrances and objections that the heart of man can invent against it
self, and salvation; lift up thine eyes, and look to the utmost thou can see;
and Christ by his intercession is able to save thee beyond the Horizon and
utmost compass of thy thoughts; even to the utmost.

Secondly, Hence draw abundant encouragement against all heartstraightnings,
and deadness of spirit in prayer. Thou complainest thy heart is dead, wandering,
and contracted in duty. O but remember Christ's blood speaks, when thou can
not: it can plead for thee, and that powerfully; when thou art not able to
speak a word for thy self: to this sense that Scripture speaks, Can. 3.6. Who
is this that comes out of the Wilderness in pillars of smoke, perfumed with
myrh, and frankincense, all the powders of the Merchant? The duties of
Christians go up many times as pillars, or clouds of smoke from them, more
smoke, than fire. Prayers smoked, and sullied with their offensive corruptions:
but remember Christ perfumes them with myrh, etc. he by his intercession, gives
them a sweet perfume.

If Jesus be the Media or of the New covenant, Believers may go with boldness,
and look the justice of God in the face; for your debt is satisfied. So long as
a man is in debt, he steals by the prison door in the dark; but if his surety
have paid the debt, he dares come (as you say) and whet his knife at the
Counter-door. Christ your ^urety has paid the debt; you may go with boldness,
and look justice in the face, the Devil, and all the Sergeants of Hell in the
face. Mr. W. B. in his Treatise of Christ and the Covenant. p. 98.
Thirdly, Christ's intercession is a singular relief to all that come unto God
by him, against all sinful damps, and slavish fears from the justice of God.
Nothing more promotes the fear of reverence. Nothing more suppresseth
unbelieving despondencies, and destroys the spirit of bondage. So you find it,
Heb. 10.19, 20, 21. Having therefore brethren, boldness to enter into the
holiest, by the blood of Jesus; by a new and living way, which he has
consecrated for us through the vail, that is to say his flesh; And having an
High Priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart (...), in
full assurance of faith: Or let us come unto God, as a Ship comes with full
sail into the Harbor. O what a direct, and full gale of encouragement does
this intercession of Christ give, to the poor soul that lay a ground, or was
wind-bound before.

Fourthly, The intercession of Christ gives admirable satisfaction and
encouragement to all that come to God, against the fears of deserting him again
by Apostasy. This my friends, this is your principal security against these
matters of fear. With this he relieves Peter, Luke 22.31.32. Simon, (says
Christ) Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I
have prayed for thee, that thy fath fail not. q. d. Satan will fan thee, not to
get out thy chaff, but boult out thy flower. His temptations are levelled
against thy faith; but fear not, my prayer shall break his designs, and secure
thy faith from all his attempt upon it. Upon this powerful intercession of
Christ, the Apostle builds his triumph, against all that threatens to bring
him, or any of the Saints again into a state of condemnation. And see how he
drives on that triumph, from the resurrection, and session of Christ at the
Fathers right hand; and especially from the work of intercession, which he
lives there to perform. Romans 8.34, 35. Who is he that condemns, it is Christ
that died; yea, rather that is risen again: who is even at the right hand of
God, who also makes intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the Love
of Christ?

Fifthly, It gives sweet relief against the defects and wants that yet are in
our sanctification. We want a great deal of faith, love, heavenly mindedness,
mortification, knowledge. We are short, and wanting in all. There are the (...)
the remains, or things wanting, as the Apostle calls them. 1 These. 3.10. Well
if grace be but yet in it is weak beginnings, and infancy in thy soul, this may
encourage, that by reason of Christ's intercession, it shall live, grow, and
expatiate it self in thy heart. He is not only the author, but the finisher of
it. Heb. 12.2. He is ever begging new and fresh mercies for you, in Heaven; and
will never be quiet till all your wants be supplied. He saves (...), to the
uttermost: (i. e.) as I told you before, to the last, perfective, completing
act of salvation. So that this is a fountain of relief against all your fears.

Use 3.
Does Christ live for ever to make intercession, Use 3.
then let those who reap on earth the fruits of that his work in Heaven, draw
instruction thence about the following duties, to which it leads them as by the
hand.

First, He does not forget us though he be exalted to his glory, for he is not
like the poor silly creature that cannot bear exaltation without being puffed
up, and forgeting both themselves, their friends, and their God. No, his
exaltation is Spiritual and Heavenly, perfecting his humane nature to the
greatest height it is capable of -- he was never more tender of Jerusalem when
he wept over it, or of his people when he wept, bled, and died for them; than
he is now tender over his in glory. Mr. Baxters Treatise of Convers. p. 184.
Do not forget Christ in an exalted state. You see though he be in all the
glory above, at Gods right hand, an enthroned King, he does not forget you. He
like Joseph remembers his brethren in all his glory. But alas how often does
advancement make us forget him? as the Lord complains in Hosea 13.5, 6. I did
know thee in the Wilderness, in the Land of great drought; but when they came
into Canaan, According to their pastures, so were they filled; they were
filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. As if he
had said, O my people, you and I were better acquainted in the Wilderness. When
you were in a low condition, left to my immediate care; living by daily faith;
Oh then you gave me many a sweet visit; but now you are filled, I hear no more
of you. Good had it been for some Saints, if they had never known prosperity.

Secondly, Let the intercession of Christ in Heaven for you, encourage you to
constancy in the good ways of God. To this duty it sweetly encourages also.
Heb. 4.14. Seeing then that we have a great High Priest that is passed into the
Heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our profession. Here is
encouragement to perseverance on a double account. One is, that Jesus our head
is already in Heaven, and if the head be above water, the body cannot drown.
The other is from the business he is there employed about, which is his
Priesthood; he is passed into the Heavens, as our great High Priest to
intercede, and therefore we cannot miscarry.

Thirdly, Let it encourage you to constancy in prayer: O do not neglect that
excellent duty, seeing Christ is there, to present all your petitions to God.
Yea, to perfume as well as present them. So the Apostle Heb. 4.16. infers from
Christ's intercession. Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace,
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.

Fourthly, Hence be encouraged to plead for Christ on earth, who continually
pleads for you in Heaven. If any accuse you, he is there to plead for you. And
if any dishonor him on earth, see that you plead his interest, and defend his
honor. Thus you have heard what his intercession is, and what benefits we
receive by it.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
The FOURTEENTH Sermon. 14.
SERMON. Asserts and vindicates the satisfaction of Christ being the first
principal effect, or fruit of his Priesthood.

GAL. III.XIII. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a
curse for us.


YOU have seen the general nature, necessity, and parts of Christ's Priesthood;
viz. his Oblation, and Intercession. Before you part from this office, it is
necessary you should further take into consideration the principal fruits, and
effects of his Priesthood. Which are, complete Satisfaction; and the Aquisition
or purchase of an eternal inheritance. The former, viz. the satisfaction made
by his blood, is manifestly contained in this excellent Scripture before us;
wherein the Apostle (having shown before, at the tenth verse, that whosoever
continues not in all things, written in the Law to do them, is cursed.)
declares how notwithstanding the threats of the Law, a Believer comes to be
freed from the curse of it. Namely, by Christ's bearing that curse for him, and
so satisfying Gods justice, and discharging the Believer from all obligations
to punishment.

More particularly, in these words you have the Believers discharge from the
curse of the Law, and the way and manner thereof opened.

First, The Believers discharge. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the
Law. The Law of God has three parts, Commands, Promises, and Threatenings, or
Curses. The Curse of the Law is its condemning sentence, whereby a sinner is
bound over to death, even the death of soul and body. The chains by which it
binds him, is the guilt of sin; and from this none can loose the soul, but
Christ. This curse of the Law is the most dreadful thing imaginable. It strikes
at the life of the sinner. Yea, his best life, the eternal life of the soul.
And when it has condemned, it is inexorable. No cries, nor tears, no
reformations, or repentance can loose the guilty sinner; for it requir^s for
its reparation, that which no mere creature can give; even an infinite
satisfaction. Now from this curse, Christ frees the Believer. That is, he
dissolves the obligation to punishment. Cancels the handwriting. Looses all the
bonds and chains of guilt. So that the curse of the Law has nothing to do with
him for ever.

Secondly, We have here the way and manner in an by which this is done.
Q^^aamo^um qui libe^ e^at, captiva (...) ^e emit, se vadem constitacado; and
i^du n^^o vi^cala, alte^i exeunt: i^a Christus l^gis^rv^^dae obnoxi^s ess^
vol^it, u^ nobis imm^nitatem acquireret. Ca. v. in Gal. 4.
And that is by a full price paid down, and that price paid in the room of the
sinner, both making up a complete and full satisfaction. He pays a full price;
every way adequate, and proportionable to the wrong. So much this word (...)
which we translate redeemed imports. He has bought us out, or fully bought us.
That is, by a full price. This price with which he so fully bought or purchased
our freedom from the curse, is not only called (...) Matthew. 20.28. a ransom.
But more emphatically (...) in 1 Timothy 2.5.6. which might be translated, an
adequate or fully answerable ransom. And so his freeing us by this price, is
not only expressed by (...) thou have bought us to God, by thy blood, Rev. 5.9.
but (...) he has fully, perfectly bought us out.

And as the price or ransom paid was full, perfect, and sufficient in it self;
so it was paid in our room, and upon our account. So says the Text, by his
being made a curse for us. The meaning is not, that Christ was made the very
curse it self. Changed into a curse, Factus esse dicit^^ mal^^^ctum, and
peccatu^; non enim ipsu^met maledict^m factus est, s^. ^ormal^ter male(...)ctum
nost^um il^i imputatum est. Cyrillus.
no more than when the word is said to be made flesh, the divine nature was
converted into flesh; but it assumed or took flesh, and so Christ, he took the
curse upon himself. Therefore it is said, 2 Cor. 5.21. He was made sin for us,
who knew no sin. That is, our ^in was imputed to our surety; and laid upon him
for satisfaction. And so this word (...) [for] implies a substitution of one,
in the place and stead of another. Now the price being full, and paid in lieu
of our sins; and thereupon we fully redeemed or delivered from the curse: It
follows as a fair, and just deduction, that

DOCT. The death of Christ has made a full satisfaction to God; Doct.
for all the sins of his Elect.
He (to wit our surety Christ) was oppressed, and he was afflicted, says the
Prophet, Isai. 53.7. it may be as fitly rendered, and the words will bear it
without the least force; it was exacted, and he answered. But how, being either
way translated, it establishes the satisfaction of Christ: may be seen in our
learned Annotations on that place. So Col. 1.14. in whom we have (...)
redemption, through his blood, even the forgiveness of sin. Here we have the
benefit, viz. redemption: interpreted by way of Apposition, even the remission
of sins; and the matchless price that was laid down to purchase it, the blood
of Christ. So again, Heb. 9.12. by his own blood he entered once into the holy
place, having obtained (...) eternal redemption for us. Here Is eternal
redemption the mercy purchased; His own blood, the price that procured it.

Now for as much as this Doctrine of Christ's satisfaction, is so necessary,
weighty, and comfortable in it self; and yet so much opposed and intricated by
several enemies to it; the method I shall take for the clearing, establishing,
and preparing it for use, shall be, First, To open the nature of Christ's
satisfaction, and show what it is. Secondly, To establish the truth of it, and
prove that he made full satisfaction to God, for all the sins of the Elect.
Thirdly, To answer the most considerable Objections made against it. And Lastly
to Apply it.


First, What is the satisfaction of Christ; and what does it imply? What Divine
satisfaction is.
I answer, Satisfaction is the Act of Christ, God-man; presenting himself as
our surety, in obedience to God, and love to us; to do, and suffer all that the
Law required of us; and thereby freeing us from the wrath, and curse due to us
for our sins.

Satisfactio haec valorem habuit sufficientiem, and ali ^ua ratione inf^^itum:
primo a persona offerentis, qui ^uit Deus: 2. a dignitate and praestantia ^ei
oblatae; obtulit enim s^m^tipsum, Deum and hominem. 3. a modo offerendi, cui
divina quaedam perfectio infuit, ratione hypostaticae unio^is. Dr. Ames medul.
p. 98.
First, It is the Act of God-man, no other was capable of giving satisfaction,
for an infinite wrong done to God. But by reason of the union of the two
natures, in his wonderful person, he could do it, and has done it for us. The
humane nature did what was necessary in its kind; it gave the matter of the
Sacrifice: the divine nature stamped the dignity and value upon it, which made
it an adequate compensation. So that it was opus (...) the act of God-man. Yet
so, that each nature retained its own properties, notwithstanding their joint
influence into the effect. If the Angels in Heaven had laid down their lives;
or if the blood of all the men in the world had beeen poured out by Justice;
this could never have satisfied; because that (...) worth and value which this
Sacrifice has, would have still been wanting. It was God that redeemed the
Church, with his own blood. Act. 20.28. If God redeem with his own blood, he
redeems as God-man, without any dispute.

Secondly, If he satisfy God for us, he must present himself before God, as
our surety in our stead, as well as for our good; else his obedience had
signified nothing to us: to this end he was made under the Law, Gal. 4.4. comes
under the same obligation with us, and that as a surety: For so he is called,
Heb. 7.22. Indeed his obedience and sufferings could be exacted from him, upon
no other account. It was not for any thing he had done, that he became a curse.
It was prophesied of him, Dan. 9.26. the Messiah shall be cut off, but not for
himself: and being dead, the Scriptures plainly assert, it was for our sins:
and upon our account. So 1 Cor. 15.3. Christ dyed for our sins according to the
Scriptures.

And it is well observed by our Divines, who assert the vicegerency and
substitution of Christ in his sufferings; that all those Greek particles which
we translate [for] when applied to the sufferings of Christ, do note the
meritorious, deserving, procuring cause of those sufferings. So you find Heb.
10.12. He offered one Sacrifice (...) for sins. 1 Pet. 3.18. Christ once
suffered (...) for sins. (...)
Romans 4.25. He was delivered (...) for our offenses. (...)
Matthew. 20.28. He gave his life a ransom (...) for many. And there are that
confidently affirm this last particle is never used in any other sense in the
whole book of God. As an eye, for an eye, a tooth, for a tooth: (i. e.) one in
lieu of another. Just as those whom the Greeks called (...) men that exchanged
lives, or gave life for life: staking down their own, to deliver another. As
Philumene did for Aristides. And so the Poet Virgil speaks.

Si fratrem Pollux alterna morte redemit. Virg.

And indeed this very consideration is that which supports the doctrine of
Imputation, Romans 5.19.
the imputation of our sins to Christ, and the imputation of Christ's
righteousness unto us. For how could our sins be laid on him, but as he stood
in our stead? or his righteousness be imputed to us, but as he was our surety,
performing it in our place. Specialis haec imputatio est meriti alieri loco
ej^s admissio, quod i^ ipso Reo in esse debet. Bradshaw de just p. 47.
So that to deny Christ's sufferings in our stead, is to loose the corner stone
of our Justification, and overthrow the very pillar which supports our faith,
comfort and salvation. Indeed if this had not been he would have been the
righteous Lord, but not the Lord our righteousness, as he is styled Ier. 33.16.
So that it is but a vain distinction, to say it was for our good, but not in
our stead. For had it not been in our stead, we could not have had the good of
it.

Thirdly, The internal moving cause of Christ's satisfaction for us, was his
obedience to God, and love to us. That it was an act of obedience is plain,
from Phil. 2.8. He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Now
obedience respects a command; and such a command Christ received to dye for us,
as himself tells us, Joh. 10.18. I lay down my life of my self, I have power to
lay it down, and power to take it again; this commandment have I received of my
Father. So that it was an act of obedience with respect to God, and yet a most
free and spontaneous act with respect to himself. And that he was moved to it
out of pity and love to us, himself assures us. Gal. 5.2. Christ loved us, and
gave himself for us, an offering and a Sacrifice to God: upon this Paul sweetly
reflected, Gal. 2.20. who loved me, and gave himself for me. As the external
moving cause was our misery, so the internal was his own love, and pity for us.

Si enim propter Ch^isti ebedienta^ assiva^ solam impu^a^am a peccatis cujusque
cujus unque generis siv^ commissi ill^d fuerit, sive omissi; ^eatu o^^i immunes
habemur: quo^sum ad justificationem im ute^ur ulterius actua ill^ ejusdem
ob^dient^a? Bradshaw in Epist. Lib. de justi.
Fourthly, The matter of Christ's satisfaction, was his active and passive
obedience, to all that the Law of God required. I know there are some that
doubt whether Christ's active obedience have any place here, and so whether it
be imputed as any part of our righteousness. It is conf^ssed the Scripture most
frequently mentions his passive obedience, as that which made the atonement;
and procures our redemption. Matthew. 26.28. Matthew. 20.28. Romans 3.24, 25. and
alibi, but his passive obedience is never mentioned exclusively, as the sole
cause, or matter of satisfaction. But in those places where it is mentioned by
it self, it is put for his whole obedience, both active and passive, by an usual
Trope; and in other Scriptures, it is ascribed to both, as Gal. 4.4. he is said
to be made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law. Now his being
made under the Law to this end, cannot be restrained to his subj^ction to the
curse of the Law only, but to the commands of it also. So Romans 5.19. As by one
man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many
be made righteous. It were a manifest injury to this text also, to restrain it
to the passive obedience of Christ only. To be short this twofold obedience of
Christ stands opposed to a twofold obligation that fallen man is under; the one
to do what God requires: the other to suffer what he has threatened for
disobedience. We owe him active obedience as his creatures, D^^ l^x est Christi
ob^dientia, d^plici homi^is post laps^m obligationi ^^^osita; activa, pro
culpa; passiva ^ro poe^a; seu utraque, pro utraque. Trel. ubi supra.
and passive obedience as his prisoners. Suitably to this double Oblation,
Christ comes under the Commandment of the Law to fulfill it actively, Matthew.
3.15. and under the malediction of the Law to satisfy it passively. And
whereas it is objected by some, if he fulfilled the whole Law for us by his
active, what need then of this passive obedience? We reply, great need; because
both these make up that one, entire, and complete obedience, by which God is
satisfied, and we justified. It Is a good rule of Alsted, obedientia Christi est
una copulativa: The whole obedience of Christ both active and passive make up
one entire perfect obedience: and therefore there is no reason why one particle
either of the one, or of the other should be excluded.

Christus ^act^s est jus remittendorum p^ccatorum, sed no^ ej^smodi ^uo possint
^emitti, sed quo remitti ^^bent omnia [illis] pro quibus per ^^^tem ejus
sati^factum est; alo (...) injustus ess^t Deus, qu^ non ageret cum Christo
filio suo, sec^^d^^ ^xigentiam moritorum ejus. Twisse de permissio. lib. 2.
Fifthly, the effect and fruit of this his satisfaction is our freedom, ransom,
or deliverance from the wrath and curse due to us for our sins. Such was the
dignity, value, and compleatness of Christ's satisfaction; that in strict
Justice it merited our redemption, and full deliverence. Not only a possibility
that we might be redeemed, and pardoned; but a right whereby we ought to be so.
As the learned Dr. Twiss judiciously argues. If he be made a curse for us, we
must then be redeemed from the curse, according to justice: so the Apostle
argues, Romans 3.25, 26. Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation, through
faith in his blood; to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
are past through the forbearance of God, to declare I say at this time his
righteousness, that God might be just, and the justifier of him that believes
in Jesus. Mark the design and end of God in exacting satisfaction from Christ;
it was to declare his righteousness, in remission of sin to believers; and lest
we should lose the Emphatical word, he doubles it; to declare I say his
righteousness. Every one can see how his mercy is declared in remission; but he
would have us take notice that his justification of Believers is an act of
Justice; and that God as he is a just God, cannot condemn the believer, since
Christ has satisfied his debts. This attribute seems to be the main bar
against remission; but now, it is become the very ground and reason why God
remits. Oh how comfortable a text is this! Does Satan or Conscience set forth
thy sin in all its discouraging circumstances and aggravations? God has set
forth Christ to be a propitiation. Must justice be manifested, satisfied, and
glorified? So it is in the death of Christ, ten thousand times more than ever
it could be in thy damnation. Thus you have a brief account of the satisfaction
made by Jesus Christ.

Secondly, We shall gather up all that has been said, to establish surety,
Heb. 7.22. who came under the same obligations of the Law with us, Gal. 4.4.
and though he had no sin of his own, yet standing before God, as our surety;
the iniquities of us all, were laid upon him. Isai. 53.6. and from him did the
Lord with great severity exact satisfaction for our sins, Romans 8.32. punishing
them upon his soul. Matthew. 27.46. and upon his body, Act. 2.23. and with this
obedience of his Son is fully pleased and satisfied. Ephesians. 5.2. And has in
token thereof raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand. 1 Timothy 3.16. And for his righteousness sake acquitted and discharged believers,
who shall never more come into condemnation. Romans 8.1, 34. All this is plain in
Scripture, and our faith in the satisfaction of Christ, is not built on the
wisdom of man; but the everlasting sealed truth of God. Yet such is the
perverse nature of man, and the pride of his heart; that whilst he should be
humbly adoring the grace of God in providing such a surety for us; he is found
accusing the justice, and diminishing the mercy of God; and raising all the
objections which Satan and his own heart can invent, to overturn that blessed
foundation upon which God has built up his own honor, and his peoples
salvation.

Thirdly, In the next place therefore, we shall reject those doctrines and
remove the principal of those objections that are found militating against the
satisfaction of Christ.

And in the first place, we reject with deep abhorrence that doctrine which
ascribes to man any power in whole or in part to satisfy God for his own, or
other men's sins. This no mere creature can do, by active obedience, were it so
complete that he could never sin in thought, word, or deed any more; but live
the most holy life, that ever any lived. For all this would be no more than his
duty as a creature, Luke 17.10. and so can be no satisfaction for what he is by
nature, or has done against God as a sinner. Nor yet by sufferings. For we
have offended an infinite God, and can never satisfy him by our finite
sufferings.

We also with like detestation reject that doctrine which makes the
satisfaction of Christ either impossible, or fictitious, and inconsistent with
grace, in the free pardon of sin. Many are the cavils raised against Christ's
satisfaction; the principal are such as these that follow.

Object.
The Doctrine of Christ's Satisfaction is absurd, for Christ (say we) is God; if
so, then God satisfies himself; then which, what can be more absurd to imagine?

Sol.
I Answer, God cannot properly be said to satisfy himself, for that would be
the same thing as to pardon simply, Aliud est de d^vinitate Christi in se agere
secundum naturam ipsius seorsim, aliud qua in supposito. Tr^lcat.
without any satisfaction. But there is a twofold consideration of Christ. One
in respect of his Essence and divine nature, in which sense, he is the object
both of the offense, and of the satisfaction made for it. Another in respect of
his person, and economy, Christus secundum naturam d^vinam convenit ^um Deo,
qua homo nobiscum; ut ^o^tra, qua Deus distat a nobis* qua homo, s^u oecono^ia
volu^ta^ia a Deo. Ide^, ibid vid. Daven. in Col. 103. and Cam^ro. p. 361.
or office: in which sense he properly satisfies God, being in respect of his
manhood another, and inferior to God. Ioh. 14.28. the blood of the man Christ
Jesus is the matter of the satisfaction. The divine nature dignifies it, and
makes it of infinite value. A certain family has committed treason against the
King, and are all under the condemnation of the Law for it; the Kings Son moved
with pity and love, resolves to satisfy the Law, and yet save the Family; in
order whereunto he marries a daughter of the family, whereby her blood becomes
Royal blood, and worth the blood of the whole family whence she sprang; this
Princess is by her Husband executed in the room of the rest. In this case the
King satisfies not himself for the wrong, but is satisfied by the death of
another, equivalent in worth to the blood of them all. This similitude answers
not to all the particulars, as indeed nothing in nature does or can, but it
only shows what it was that satisfied God, and how it became so satisfactory.

If Christ satisfied by paying our Debt, Object.
then he should have endured eternal torments. For so we should, and the damned
shall.

We must distinguish betwixt what is essential, Sol.
and what is accidental in punishment. The primary intent of the Law is
reparation, and satisfaction; he that can make it at one entire payment, (as
Christ could and did) ought to be discharged. He that cannot (as no mere
creature can) ought to lie for ever, as the damned do under sufferings.

If God will be satisfied for our sin, Object.
before he pardon them; how then is pardon an Act of Grace?

Pardon could not be an act of pure grace if God received satisfaction from us,
Sol.
but if he pardon us, upon the satisfaction received from Christ; though it be
of debt to him, it is of grace to us. For it was grace to admit a surety to
satisfy; more grace to provide him, and most of all to apply his satisfaction
to us, by uniting us to Christ, as he has done.

But God loved us, Object.
before Christ died for us; for it was the love of God to the world that moved
him to give his only begotten Son. Could God love us, and yet not be reconciled
and satisfied?

Sol.
Gods complacential love is indeed inconsistent with an unreconciled state. He
is reconciled to every one he so loves. But his benevolent love, consisting in
his purpose of Good, may be before actual reconciliation, and satisfaction.

Object.
Temporal death, as well as eternal, is a part of the curse; if Christ have
fully satisfied by bearing the curse for us, how is it that those for whom he
bare it, dye as well as others?

Sol.
As Temporal death is a poenal evil, and part of the curse; so God inflicts it
not upon believers, but they must dye for other ends, viz. to be made perfectly
happy in a more full and immediate enjoyment of God, than they can have in the
body: and so death is theirs, by way of privilege. 1 Cor. 3.22. They are not
deaths, by way of punishment. The same may be said of all the afflictions with
which God for gracious ends now exercises his reconciled ones. Thus much may
suffice, to establish this great truth.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
If the death of Christ was that which satisfied God for all the sins of the
Elect, then certainly there is an infinite evil in sin, since it cannot be
expiated, but by an infinite satisfaction. Fools make a mock of sin, and there
are but few souls in the world, that are duly sensible and affected with its
evil; but certainly, if God should damn thee to all eternity, thy eternal
sufferings could not satisfy for the evil that is in one vain thought. Per
hanc mortem Christi valde excitamur and ad caut^lam, and ad detestationem
peccati. Mortiferum enim sit nec^ss est, quod alit sanari non potuit; quam
morte Christi. Quis igitur serio cogitans, peccata sua non esse aliter expiata
quam sanguine ipsius filii D^i; nor perhorrescet indies peccando, hanc
praetiofissimum sanguinem quasi conculcare. Daven, in Coli cap. 1. v. 20.
It may be you may think this is harsh and severe, that God should hold his
creatures under everlasting sufferings for sin, and never be satisfied with
them any more. But when you have well considered that the object against whom
you sin, is the infinite blessed God; which derives an infinite evil to the sin
committed against him; and when you consider how God dealt with the Angels that
fell, for one sin, and that but of the mind; for having no bodily organs they
could commit nothing externally against God; you will alter your minds about
it. O the depth of the evil of sin! If ever you will see how great and horrid
an evil sin is, measure it in your thoughts; either by the infinite holiness
and excellency of God, who is wronged by it; or by the infinite sufferings of
Christ, who dyed to satisfy for it; and then you will have deeper
apprehensions of the evil of sin.

Inference 2.
If the death of Christ satisfied God, Infer. 2.
and thereby redeemed the Elect from the curse, then the redemption of souls is
costly; souls are dear things, and of great value with God. Ye know (says the
Apostle) that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold
from your vain conversation received by tradition: but with the precious blood
of the Son of God, as of a Lamb without spot. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. Only the blood
of God, is found an equivalant price for the redemption of souls. Gold and
silver may redeem from Turkish, but not from Hellish bondage. The whole
creation sold to the utmost worth of it, is not a value for the redemption of
one soul. Souls are dear ware, he that paid for them, found them so. Yet how
cheaply do sinners sell their souls, as if they were but low prized
Commodities! But you that sell your souls cheap, will buy repentance dear.

Inference 3.
If Christ's death satisfied God for our sins, Infer. 3.
how unparalled is the love of Christ to poor sinners! Val^rius. lib. 6. c. 5.
It Is much to pay a pecuniary debt, to free another; but who will pay his own
blood for another? We have a famous instance of Zaleucus, that famous
Locrensian Lawgiver, who decreed and Enacted, that whoever was convicted of
Adultery, should have both his eyes put out. It so fell out, that his own Son
was brought before him for that crime; hereupon the people interposing, made
suit for his pardon. At length, the Father partly overcome by their
importunities, and not unwilling to show what lawful favor he might to his
Son; he first put out one of his own eyes, and then one of his Sons; and so
showed himself both a merciful Father, and a just Lawgiver. So tempering mercy
with justice, that both the Law was satisfied, and his Son spared. This is
written by the Historian as an instance of singular love in this Father, to pay
one half of the penalty for his Son. But Christ did not divide and share in the
penalty with us, but bare it all. Zaleucus did it for his Son, who was dear to
him; Christ did it for enemies, that were fighting and rebelling against him.
Romans 5.8. while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. O would to God (said
an holy one) I could cause Paper and Ink to speak the worth and excellency, the
high and loud praises of our brother-ransomer! Oh the ransomer needs not my
report; but oh if he would take it, and make use of it. I should be happy if I
had an Errand to this world, but for some few years; to spread proclamations,
and out-crys, and love letters of the highness [the highness for evermore] of
the ransomer, whose clothes were wet, and dyed in blood; how be it, that after
that, my soul and body should go back to their mother nothing.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
If Christ by dying has made full satisfaction, then God is no loser in
pardoning the greatest of sinners that believe in Jesus: and consequently his
Justice can be no bar to their Justification, and Salvation. He is just to
forgive us our sins, 1 John 1.9. What an Argument is here for a poor Believer
to plead with God! Lord, if thou save me by Jesus Christ, thy Justice will be
fully satisfied at one round payment, but if thou damn me, and require
satisfaction at my hands; thou can never receive it. I shall make but a
dribling payment, though I lie in Hell to eternity; and shall still be
infinitely behind with thee. Is it not more for thy glory to receive it from
Christ's hand, than to require it at mine? One drop of his blood is more worth
than all my polluted blood. O how satisfying a thing is this to the Conscience
of a poor sinner, that is objecting the multitude, agravations, and amazing
circumstances of sin, against the possibility of their being pardoned. Can such
a sinner as I be forgiven? Yes, if thou believe in Jesus, thou may: for so
God will lose nothing in pardoning the greatest transgressors. Let Israel hope
in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy; and with him is plenteous
redemption. Psalm. 130.7. (i. e.) a large stock of merit lying by him, in the
blood of Christ, to pay him for all that you have done against him.

Inference 5.
Lastly, Infer. 5.
If Christ has made such a full satisfaction as you have heard, how much is it
the concernment of every soul, to abandon all thoughts of satisfying God for
his own sins; and betake himself to the blood of Christ the ransomer by faith,
that in that blood they may be pardoned. It would grieve ones heart to see how
many poor creatures are drudging and tugging at a task of repentance, and
revenge upon themselves, and reformation, and obedience, to satisfy God for
what they have done against him: and alas it cannot be! they do but lose their
labor. could they swelter their very hearts out, weep till they can weep no
more, cry till their throats be parched; alas they can never recompense God,
for one vain thought. For such is the severity of the Law, that when it is once
offended, it will never be made amends again, by all that we can do. It will
not discharge the sinner for all the sorrow in the world. Indeed if a man be in
Christ, sorrow for sin is something; and renewed obedience is something. God
looks upon them favorably, and accepts them graciously in Christ: but out of
him they signify no more than the entreaties and cries of a condemned
malefactor, to reverse the legal sentence of the Judge. You may toil all the
day of your life, and at night go to bed without a candle. To that sense that
Scripture sounds, Isa. 50. ult. Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that compass
your selves about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the
sparks that you have kindled; this shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie
down in sorrow. By fire, and the light of it, some understand the sparkling
pleasures of this life, and the sensitive joys of the creatures: but generally
it is taken for our own natural righteousness, and all acts of duties in order
to our own justification by them before God. And so it stands opposed to that
faith of recumbency, spoken of in the verse before. By their compassing
themselves about with these sparks, understand their dependence on these their
duties and glorying in them. But see the fatal issue, ye shall lie down in
sorrow. That shall be your recompense from the hand of the Lord. That Is all the
thanks, and reward you must expect from him, for slighting Christ's, and
prefering your own righteousness before his. Reader, be convinced, that one act
of faith in the Lord Jesus, pleases God more, than all the obedience,
repentance and strivings to obey the Law through thy whole life can do. And
thus you have the first special fruit of Christ's Priesthood, in the full
satisfaction of God for all the sins of Believers.

The FIFTEENTH Sermon. 15.
SERMON. Surveys the blessed inheritance purchased by the Oblation of Christ,
being the second effect or fruit of his Priesthood.

GAL. IV.IV, V. But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son,
made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,
that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.


THis Scripture gives us an account of a double fruit of Christ's death, viz.
the payment of our debt, and the purchase of our inheritance.

First, The payment of our debt expressed by our redemption, or buying us out
from the obligation and curse of the Law, which has been discoursed in the
last exercise.

Secondly, the purchase of an inheritance for those redeemed ones: expressed
here by their receiving the Adoption of Sons. Which is to be our present
subject* Adoption is either civil, or divine. Of the first the Civil Law gives
this difinition, that it is,

Summa A^gel. ad verbum. Adoptio est actus legitimus, imta^s natu^am; repe^tus
ad little sol^^ium, ^ui ^^^cros non habent. A lo tio est be^^fi i^m q^o nos D^us
prop^r Christum, i^ fill os recipit; and facit nos cum ipso, haeredes vitae
aeternae. Ravanei.
A Lawful Act, in imitation of nature, invented for the comfort of them that
have no children of their own. Divine Adoption, is that special benefit whereby
God, for Christ's sake, accepts us as Sons, and makes us heirs of eternal life
with him:

Hic ergo Adoptio capitur (sicuti Romans 8.23. redemptio) pro ipsa possission^.
Nam sicuti ultimo die p^^cipimus read n^tionis ^^st^ae ^^uctum, ita nunc
p^rcip^mus. etc. Call. (...) Loc.
Betwixt this Civil, and Sacred Adoption there is a twofold agreement, and
disagreement. They agree in this, that both flow from the pleasure, and good
will of the Adoptant. And in this, that both confer aright to privileges,
which we have not by nature; but in this they differ. One is an Act imitating
nature, the other transcends nature. The one, was found out for the comfort of
them that had no children; the other, for the comfort of them that had no
Father. This Divine Adoption, is in Scripture either taken properly for that
act, or sentence of God, by which we are made Sons: or for the privileges with
which the Adopted are invested. And so it is taken Romans 8.23. and in this
Scripture now before us. We lost our inheritance by the fall of Adam: we
receive it, as the Text speaks, by the death of Christ, which restores it again
to us by a new, and better title. The Doctrine hence is,

DOCT. Doct.
That the death of Jesus Christ, has not only satisfied for our debts; but over
and above, purchased a rich inheritance, for the children of God.
For this end, or cause, he is the Mediator of the New Testament; that by means
of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
Testament, they which are called, might receive the promise of eternal
inheritance. Heb. 9.15.

We will here first see what Christ paid. Secondly, what he purchased. Thirdly,
for whom.

First, What Christ paid. Our Divines comprize the virtue Parker de descensu,
lib. 3. p. 97.

Dr. Reynolds in Psalm 110. Carero. 363, etc.


viz. solutio debiti, and acquisitio haereditatis, payment, and purchase:
answerably the obedience of Christ has a double relation, ratio legalis
justiciae, the relation of a legal righteousness; an adequate and exactly
proportionated price. And it has also in it ratio super legalis meriti, the
relation of a merit over and beyond the Law.

To object (as some do) the satisfaction of Christ was more than sufficient,
Satisfactio Christi f^it plus^ am sufficie^s, non igitur ex debito; non ex
obligato. Fevard. Dia^og. 5. p. 382.
according to our Doctrine, and therefore could not be intended for the payment
of our debt, is a senseless cavil. For surely if Christ paid more than was
owing, he must needs pay all that was owing to divine Justice. And truly it is
but a bad requital of the Love of Jesus Christ, who beside the payment of what
we owed, would manifest his bounty, by the redundancy of his merit, which he
paid to God to purchase a blessed inheritance for us. This overplus of
satisfaction (which was the price of that inheritance I am now to open) is not
obscurely hinted, but plainly expressed twice in Romans 5.15. But not as the
offense, so also is the free gift; for if through the offense of one, many be
dead, (...). much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace; which is by one
man Jesus Christ (...), has abounded, or flowed abundantly unto many. So verse.
17. For if by one man's offense, death reigned by one; (...) much more they
which receive (...) the overflowings, or abundance of grace, and of the gift of
righteousness, shall reign in life, by one, Jesus Christ. Dutch Annot. in loc.
Deodati^ in loc.
In both which places Christ and Adam are compared as the two roots or common
heads of mankind; both agreeing in this property of communicating their
conditions to those that are theirs; yet there is a great deal of difference
betwixt them, for in Christ the power is all divine, and therefore infinitely
more active, and effectual. He communicates abundantly more to his, than they
lost in Adam. So that this blood is not only sufficient to redeem all those
that are actually redeemed by it, but even the whole world also. And were there
so many worlds of men, as there are men in the world, it would be sufficient
for them also; and yet still there would be an overplus of value. For all those
worlds of men would rise but to a finite bulk; but this blood is infinite in
its worth and dignity. Quoad substantiam poenae nihil plus perpessus est
Christus, quam quod per legem debebatur; quo ad circumstantias autem, patientis
personam, patiendi ca^sam; passio is efficatiam; plus quam s^fficiens
satisfactio Christi a ^obis dicitur. Parker de desensu lib. 3.
Since then there is not a whole world, no not half, but the far less part of
the world redeemed by the blood of Christ; which was sufficient for so many:
how great must be the surplusage, and redundancy of merit! Here our Divines
rightly distinguish betwixt the substance, and accidents of Christ's death and
obedience. Consider that Christ's suffering as to the substance of it, it was no
more than what the Law required. For neither the justice, nor love of the
Father would permit, that Christ should suffer more, than what was necessary
for him to bear, as our surety: but as to the circumstances, the person of the
sufferer, the cause and efficacy of his sufferings, etc. it was much more than
sufficient. A super legale meritum, a merit above and beyond what the Law
required. For though the Law required the death of the sinner, who is but a
poor contemptible creature; it did not require that one perfectly innocent
should die. It did not require that God should shed his blood. It did not
require blood of such value, and worth as this was. I say none of this the Law
required, though God was pleased for the advancement and manifestation of his
Justice and Mercy in the highest, Notant qui de legun relaxat (...)
scrips^rant, eas esse optimas relaxationes, quibus annexa est commutation.
Grotius de satisfac. cap. 5.
to admit and order this, by way of commutation; admitting him to be our (...)
or ransomer by dying for us. And indeed it was a most gracious relaxation of
the Law, that admitted of such a commutation as this: for hereby it comes to
pass, that Justice is fully satisfied, and yet we live and are saved; which
before was a thing that could not be imagined. Yea, now we are not only
redeemed from wrath by the adequate compensation made for our sins by Christ's
blood and sufferings substantially considered, but to a most glorious
inheritance purchased by his blood, Christum p^rva magnis pensasse s^ribit.
Athanas. de passione and cruce.
considered as the blood of an Innocent; as the blood of God, and therefore as
most excellent and efficatious blood, above what the Law demanded. And this is
the meaning of Athanasius, when he says that Christ recompensed or made amends
for small things, with great. He means not that sin considered absolutely, and
in it self is small; Mu^to plura quam debemus Christus pro nobis solvit, ^anto
que plura, qua^o g^tt^iam exiguam pel^gus excellent imm^nsum.
O no, but compared with Christ's blood, and the infinite excellency and worth
of it, it is so. And Chrysostom, to the same purpose, Christ paid much more
(says he) than we owed, and so much more, as the immense Ocean, is more than a
small drop. So that it was rightly determined by holy Anselme, no man says he
can pay to God what he owes him; Christ only paid more than he owed him. And by
this you see how rich a treasure there lies by Christ, to bestow in a purchase
for us, beyond and above what he paid to redeem us; even as much as his soul
and body was more worth than ours for whom it was sacrificed; and that is so
great a sum, that all the Angels in Heaven, and men on earth can never compute,
and sum up, so as to show us the total of it. And this was that inexhaustible
treasure that Christ expended, to procure and purchase the fairest inheritance
for Believers. Having seen the treasure that purchased; let us next enquire
into the inheritance purchased by it.

Secondly, This inheritance is so large, that it cannot be surveyed Fid^libus
est totus mundus Aug.
for it comprehends all things. 1 Cor. 3.22. All is yours, ye are Christ's, and
Christ is Gods. Revel. 21.7. He that overcomes shall inherit all things. And
yet I do not think or say that Dominium fundatur in gratia, that Temporal
Dominion in founded in grace. No, that is at the cast and dispose of providence:
but, Christ by his death has restored a right to all things to his people.

But to be more particular, I shall distribute the Saints inheritance purchased
by Christ, into three heads. All Temporal good things, all Spiritual good
things, and all Eternal good things are theirs.

First, Christus meruit nobis omnia bona, supernaturalia, and omnia auxilia,
sive praevenientia, sive subse^uentia; as universa illa bona etsi bona sint
^obis ext^i^se^a, quae rationem induunt mediorum ad nostram salutem. Vincent.
Austricens. de habit. Christi great. pr^^ect. q 5. p. 259.
All Temporal good things. 1 Timothy 6.7. He has given us all things, richly to
enjoy. Not that they have the possession, but the comfort and benefit of all
things. Others have the sting, gall, wormwood, bayts, and snares of the
creature; Saints only have the blessing and comfort of it. So that this little
which a Righteous man has, is (in this among other respects) better than the
treasures of many wicked. Which is the true key to open that dark saying of the
Apostle, 2 Cor. 6.10. as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. They
only possess, others are possessed by the world. The Saints do uti mundo, and
frui Deo, use the world and enjoy God in the use of it. Others are deceived,
defiled, and destroyed by the world, but these are refresht, and furthered by
it.

Secondly, All Spiritual good things are purchased by the blood of Christ for
them. As justification which comprizes remission of sins, and acceptance of
our persons by God. Romans 3.24. Being Justified freely by his grace, through the
redemption that is in Christ. Sanctification is also purchased for them. Yea,
both initial and progressive sanctification. For of God he is made unto us not
only wisdom and righteousness, but sanctification also. 1 Cor. 1.30. These two,
viz. our Justification and Sanctification, are two of the most rich and shining
robes in the wardrobe of free grace. How glorious and lovely do they render the
soul that wears them! These are like the Bracelets and Jewels Isaac sent to
Rebecca. Adoption into the family of God is purchased for us by this blood. For
ye are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ, Gal 3.26. Christ as he
is the Son, is haeres natus, the heir by nature: as he is Mediator, he is
haeres constitutus, the heir by appointment: appointed heir of all things; as
it is Heb. 1.2. By this Sonship of Christ, we being united to him by faith,
become Sons; and if Sons, then heirs. O what a manner of love is* this, that we
should be called the Sons of God? 1 John 3.1. That a poor beggar should be made
an heir, yea, an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ. Yea, that very
faith, which is the bond of union, and consequently the ground of all our
communion with Christ, is the purchase of his blood also. 2 Pet. 1.1. To them
that have obtained like precious faith with us, through the righteousness of
God, and our Savior Jesus Christ. This most precious grace is the dear
purchase of our Lord Jesus Christ. Yea, all that peace, joy, and spiritual
comfort, which are sweet fruits of faith, are with it purchased for us by this
blood.

So speaks the Apostle in Romans 5.1, 2, 3. Being Justified by faith, we have
peace with God; through our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. moreover the Spirit himself
who is the Author, Fountain, and Spring of all these graces and comforts, is
procured for us by his death, and resurrection. Gal. 3.13, 14. Christ has
redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us; for it is
written, cursed is every one that hangs on a tree. That the blessing of
Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might
receive the promise of the spirit, through faith. That spirit that at first
sanctified, and since has so often sealed, comforted, directed, resolved,
guided, and quickened your souls; had not come to perform any of these blessed
Offices upon your hearts if Christ had not died.

Thirdly, All Eternal good things are the purchase of his blood* Heaven and all
the glory thereof is purchased for you that are Believers, with this price.
Hence that glory, whatever it be, is called, an inheritance incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in Heaven for you; to the lively
hope whereof ye are begotten again, by the resurrection of Christ from the
dead. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4. Not only present mercys are purchased for us, but things
to come also. As it is 1 Cor. 3.22. Man is a prudent and prospecting creature,
and is not satisfied that it is well with him for present, unless he have some
assurance it shall be well with him for time to come. His mind is taken up
about what shall be hereafter, and from the good, or evil things to come, he
raises up to himself, vast hopes, or fears.

Therefore to complete our happiness, and fill up the uttermost capacity of our
souls; all the good of eternity is put into the account and Inventory of the
Saints Estate and Inheritance. This happiness is ineffable. It Is usually
distinguished into what is essential, and what is accessory to it. The
essentials of it, as we in our embodied state can conceive, is either, the
Objective, Subjective, or Formal happiness to be enjoyed in Heaven.

The Objective happiness, is God himself. Psalm. 73.25. Whom have I in Heaven
but thee? If it could be supposed (says one) that God should withdraw from the
Saints in Heaven, and say, take Heaven and divide it among you; but as for me,
I will withdraw from you: the Saints would fall a weeping in Heaven, and say,
Lord take Heaven, and give it to whom thou will; it is no Heaven to us except
thou be there. Heaven would be a very Bokim to the Saints, without God. In this
our glory in Heaven consists, to be ever with the Lord. 1 These. 4.17. God
himself is the chief part of a Saints inheritance, in which sense as some will
understand, Romans 8.17. they are called heirs of God.

The Subjective glory and happiness is the attemperation and suiting of the
soul and body to God. This is begun in sanctification, perfected in
glorification. It consists in removing from both, all that is indecent and
inconsistent with a state of such complete glory and happiness; and in
super-induceing and clothing it with all Heavenly qualities.

The immunities of the body are its freedom from all natural infirmities; which
as they come in, so they go out with sin. Thenceforth there shall be no
diseases, deformities, pains, flaws, monstrosities, their good physician death
has cured all this. And their vile bodies shall be made like unto Christ's
glorious body. Phil. 3.21. And be made a spiritual body. 1 Cor. 15.44. For
agility, like the Chariots of Aminadab. For Beauty as the top of Lebanon, for
incorruptibility as if they were pure Spirits.

The Soul also is discharged and freed from all darkness and ignorance of mind;
being now able to discern all truths in God, that Crystal Ocean of truth. The
leaks of the memory stopped for ever. The roving of its fancy perfectly cured.
The stubbornness and reluctance of the will, for ever subdued, and retained in
due, and full subjection to God. So that the Saints in glory shall be free from
all that now troubles them. They shall never sin more, nor be once tempted so
to do; for no serpent hisses in that paradise. They shall never grieve or groan
more, for God shall wipe all tears from their eyes. They shall never be
troubled more: for God will then recompense tribulation to their troubles, and
to them that are troubled rest. They shall never doubt more, for fruition
excludes doubting.

The Formal happiness is the fullness of satisfaction resulting from the blessed
sight and enjoyment of God, by a soul so attemper'd to him. Psalm. 17.15. When I
awake, I shall be satisfied with thy likeness. This sight of God in glory
called the beatifical vision, must needs yield ineffable satisfaction to the
beholding soul, in as much as it will be an intuitive vision. The intellectual
or mental eye shall see God: 1 Ioh. 3.2. The corporeal glorified eye shall see
Christ. Job 19.26, 27. What a ravishing vision will this be? And how much will
it exceed all reports, and apprehensions we had here of it! Surely the one half
was not told us. It will be a transformative vision, it will change the
beholder into its own image and likeness. We shall be like him, for we shall
see him as he is. 1 John 3.2. As Iron put into the fire, becomes all fiery: so
the soul by conversing with God, is changed into his very similitude. It will
be, an Appropriative vision, whom I shall see for my self. Job. 19.26, 27. In
Heaven interest is clear, and undoubted; fear is cast out. No need of marks and
signs there; for what a man sees and enjoys, how can he doubt of? It will be a
ravishing vision, these we have by faith are so, how much more those in glory;
How was Paul transported, when he was in a visional way wrapped up into the third
Heaven, and heard the unutterable things, though he was not admitted into the
blessed society, but was with them as the Angels are in our assemblies; a
stander by, a looker on. If a spark do so inflame; what is it to lie down like
a Phoenix in her bed of Spices? Like a Salamander to live, and move in the fire
of love! It will also be an eternal vision, vacabimus, and videbimus: (as
Augustine said) we shall then be at leisure for this employment, and have no
diversions from it for ever. No evening is mentioned to the seventh days
sabbath; no night in the new Jerusalem. And therefore,

Lastly, It will be a fully satisfying vision: God will then be all in all.
Etiam ipsa curiositas satietur, curiosity it self will be satisfied. The
blessed soul will feel it self blessed, filled, satisfied, in every part. Ah
what an happiness is here! to look, and love; to drink and sing, and drink
again at the fountain head of the highest glory. And if at any time its eye be
turned from a direct, to a reflex sight upon what it once was; how it was
wrought on; how fitted for this glory; how wonderfully distinguished by special
grace, from them that are howling in flames, whilst himself is shouting aloud
upon its bed of everlasting rest; all this will enhaunce the glory.

And so also will the Accessories of this blessedness, The place where God is
enjoyed, the Empyrean Heaven, the City of God, wihther Christ ascended. Where
the great assembly are met. Paradise and Canaan were but the Types of it. More
excelling and trascending the Royal Palaces of earthly Princes, than they do a
^idgeon hold. The company also with whom he is enjoyed, adds to the glory. A
blissful society indeed. Store of good neighbors in that City. There we shall
have familiar converse with Angels, whose appearances now are insupportable by
poor mortals. There will be sweet and full closings also betwixt the Saints;
Luther and Zuinglius are there agreed: here they could not fully close with one
another. And no wonder, for they could not fully close with themselves. But
there is perfect harmony and unity. All meeting and closing in God, as lines in
the Center. This is a blessed glimpse of your inheritance.

Thirdly, All this is purchased for Believers: hence it is called, the
Inheritance of the Saints in Light. Col. 1.12. All is yours, for ye are
Christ's, that is the tenure. 1 Cor. 3.23. So Romans 8.30. Whom he did
predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified:
and whom he justified, them he also glorified: Only those that are Sons, are
Heirs. Romans 8.17. The unrighteous shall not inherit. 1 Cor. 6.9. It Is the
Fathers good pleasure to give the Kingdom to the little flock, Luke 12.32.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Has Christ not only redeemed you from wrath, but purchased such an eternal
inheritance also by the overplus of his merit for you. Oh how well content
should Believers then be with their lot of providence in this life, be it what
it will! Content did I say, I speak too low, overcome, ravished, filled with
praises and thanksgivings; how low, how poor, how afflicted soever for present
they are. O let not such a thing as grumbling, repining, freting at providence
be found; or once named among the expectants of this Inheritance. Suppose you
had taken a beggar from your door, and adopted him to be your Son; and made him
Heir of a large inheritance; and after this he should contest and quarrel with
you for a trifle? could you bear it? how to work the Spirit of a Saint into
contentment with a Low condition here; A Saint indeed. p. 83, 89, etc.
I have laid down several rules in another discourse, to which for present I
refer the Reader.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
With what weaned affections should the people of God walk up and down this
world, content to live, and willing to die. For things present are theirs if
they live, and things to come are theirs if they die. Paul expresses himself in
a frame of holy indifferency. Phil. 1.23. Which to choose I know not. Many of
them that are now in fruition of their inheritance above, had vitam in
patientia, mortem in desiderio, life in patience, and death in desire, while
they tabernacled with us. Oh (cried one) what would I give to have a bed made
to my wearied soul in Christ's bosom. -- I cannot tell you what sweet pain, and
delightful torments are in his love. I often challenge time for holding us
assunder; I profess to you, I have no rest till I be over head and ears in
Loves Ocean. If Christ's Love (that fountain of delights) were laid open to me
as I would wish; O how drunken would this my soul be! I half call his absence
cruel; and the mask and vail on his face a cruel covering, that hides such a
fair, fair face from a ^ick soul. I dare not challenge himself, but his absence
is a mountain of Iron upon my heavy heart. O when shall we meet! How long is it
to the dawning of the marriage day! O sweet Lord Jesus, take wide steps. O my
Lord come over mountains at one stride! O my beloved flee like a Roe, or young
Heart upon the mountains of separation! O if he would fold the Heavens together
like an old cloak; and shovel time, and days out of the way; and make ready in
have the Lambs wife for her husband! Since he looked upon me, my heart is not
mine own.

Who can be blamed for desiring to see that fair inheritance which is purchased
for him? But truly should God hold up the soul by the power of faith, from day
to day to such sights as these; who would be content to live a day more on
earth? How should we be ready to pull down the Prison walls, and not having
patience to wait till God open the door! As the Heathen said.

Victurosque dii celant, ut vivere durant.
And truly the wisdom of God is in this specially remarkable, in giving the new
creature such an admirable crasis and even temper: as that Scripture, 2 These.
3.5. expresses: The Lord direct your hearts into the Love of God, and patient
waiting for of Christ. Love inflames with desire, patience allays that fervor.
So that fervent desires (as one happily expresses it) are allaied with meek
submission. Mighty love, with strong patience. And had not God twisted together
these two principles in the Christians constitution; he had framed a creature
to be a torment to it self, to live upon a very rack.

Inference 3.
Hence we infer the impossibility of their Salvation that know not Christ,
Infer. 3.
nor have interest in his blood. Neither Heathens nor merely nominal Christians
can inherit. I know some are very indulgent to the Heathen, and many formal
Christians are but too much so to themselves: but union by faith with Jesus
Christ, is the only way revealed in Scripture by which we hope to come to the
heavenly inheritance. I know it seems hard, that such brave men as some of the
Heathens were, should be damned: but the Scripture knows no other way to glory,
but Christ put on and applied by faith. And it is the common suffrage of modern
sound Divines, that no man by the sole conduct of nature, without the knowledge
of Christ, can be saved. There is but one way to glory, for all the world. Ioh.
14.6. No man comes to the Father but by me. Gal. 3.14. The blessing of Abraham
comes upon the Gentiles through faith. Scripture asserts the impossibility of
being, or doing any thing that is truly evangelically good out of Christ. Joh.
15.5. Without me ye can do nothing; and Heb. 11.6. Without faith it is
impossible to please God.

Scripture every where connects and chains Salvation with vocation, Romans 8.30.
and vocation with Gospel. Romans 10.14. To those that plead for the Salvation of
Heathens, and profane Christians; we may apply that tart rebuke of Bernard,
that while some labor to make Plato a Christian, he feared they therein did
prove themselves to be Heathens.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
How greatly are we all concerned to clear up our Title to the heavenly
inheritance! It Is horrible to see how industrious many are for an inheritance
on earth, and how careless for Heaven. By which we may plainly see how vilely
the noble soul is depressed by sin, and sunk down into flesh; minding only the
concernments of the flesh. Hear me ye that labor for the world, as if Heaven
were in it. What will ye do when at death you shall look back over your
shoulder, and see what you have spent your time and strength for, shrinking and
vanishing away from you? When you shall look forward, and see vast eternity
opening its mouth to swallow you up? O then what would you give for a well
grounded assurance of an eternal inheritance!

O therefore, if you have any concernment for your poor souls. If it be not
indifferent to you, what becomes of them, whether they be saved, or whether
they be damned; give all diligence to make your calling and election sure. 2
Pet. 1.10. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God
that works in you both to will and to do of his own good pleasure. Phil.
2.12. Remember it is Salvation you work for; and that is no trifle. Remember
it is your own Salvation, and not another. It is for thy own poor soul that
thou art striving; and what have thou more?

Remember, now God offers you his helping hand; now the Spirit waits upon you
in the means; but of the continuance thereof you have no assurance; for it is
of his own good pleasure, and not at yours. To your work souls, to your work.
Ah, strive as men that know what an Inheritance in Heaven is worth.

And that as for you that have sollid evidence that it is yours; Oh, that with
hands and eyes lifted up to Heaven, you would adore that free grace, that has
entitled a child of wrath, to a heavenly inheritance. Walk as becomes heirs of
God, and joint heirs with Christ. Be often looking Heavenward, when wants
pinch here. Oh, look to that fair estate you have reserved in Heaven for you,
and say, I am hastening home, and when I come thither, all my wants shall be
supplied. Consider what it cost Christ to purchase it for thee, and with a deep
sense of what he has laid out for thee, let thy soul say;

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
Sermon. 16.
The SIXTEENTH SERMON. Opens the Kingly Office of Christ as it is executed
spiritually upon the souls of the Redeemed.

II COR. X.V. Casting down imaginations, and every thing that exalts it self
against the knowledge of God; and bringing into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ.


WE now come to the Regal Office by which our glorious Mediator executes and
discharges the undertaken design of our Redemption. Had he not as our Prophet
opened the way of Life and Salvation to the children of men, they could never
have known it; and should they have clearly known it, except as their Priest he
had offered up himself to impetrate and obtain Redemption for them; they could
not have been Redeemed virtually by his blood; and if they had been so
Redeemed, yet had he not lived in the capacity of a King, to apply this
purchase of his blood to them; they could have had no actual personal benefit
by his death. For what he revealed as a Prophet, he purchased as a Priest: and
what he so revealed and purchased as Prophet and Priest; he applies as King.
First, Subduing the souls of his elect to his spiritual government, then ruling
them as his subjects; and ordering all things in the Kingdom of providence for
their good.

So that Christ has a twofold Kingdom, the one spiritual, and internal; by
which he subdues and rules the hearts of his people. The other providential,
and external; whereby he guides, rules, and orders all things in the world in a
blessed subordination to their eternal Salvation. I am to speak from this text
of his Spiritual and internal Kingdom.

These words are considerable two ways, either relatively, or absolutely.
Considered relatively they are a vindication of the Apostle from the unjust
censures of the Corinthians; who very unworthily interpreted his gentleness,
condescension, and winning affability to be no better than a fawning upon them
for self ends: and the authority he excercised, no better than pride, and
imperiousness. But hereby he lets them know, that as Christ needs not, so he
never used such carnal Artifices.

The weapons of our warfare (says he) are not carnal, but mighty through God,
etc.

Absolutely considered, they hold forth the efficacy of the Gospel in the
plainness and simplicity of it, for the subduing of rebellious sinners to
Christ: and in them we have these three things to consider.

First, The oppositions made by sinners against the assaults of viz.
imaginations or reasonings as the word (...) may be fitly rendered. He means the
subtilties, slights, excuses, subterfuges and arguings of fleshly minded men:
in which they fortify and entrench themselves against the convictions of the
word. Munitiones eleganti metaphorausurpat pro omni ^o, in quo hosts evangelii
co fidunt. Et contra veritatem coel^ it is verbi sese muniunt, efferuntqu^.
Qualia sunt carnalis sapientia, cruditio and eloq entia. S. Glassius.
Yea and there are not only such carnal reasonings, but many proud high
conceits with which poor creatures swel, and scorn to submit to the abasing,
humble, self-denying way of the Gospel. These are the fortifications erected
against Christ, by the carnal mind. Secondly, We have here the conquest which
the Gospel obtains over sinners, thus fortified against it. It casts down, and
overthrows, and takes in those strong holds. Thus Christ spoils Satan of his
armor in which he trusted, by showing the sinner that all this can be no
defense to his soul against the wrath of God. But that is not all, in the next
place, Thirdly, You have here the improvement of the victory. Christ does not
only lead away these enemies spoiled, but brings them into obedience to
himself: (i. e.) makes them after conversion Subjects of his own Kingdom;
obedient, useful, and serviceable to himself: and so is more than a Conqueror.
They do not only lay down their arms and fight no more against Christ with
them; but repair to his Camp, and fight for Christ, with those reasons of
theirs that were before employed against him: as it is said of Jerome, O beata
victoria, ubi victi cum victoribus simul triumphant. Meyer in Loc.
Origin and Tertullian that they came into Canaan, laden with Egyptian gold.
That is they come into the Church, full of excellent learning, and abilities,
with which they eminently served Jesus Christ. O blessed victory, where the
Conqueror and conquered both Triumph together. And thus enemies and rebels are
subdued, and made subjects of the spiritual Kingdom of Christ. Hence the
Doctrinal note is.
DOCT. That Jesus Christ exercises a Kingly power over the souls of all, Doct.
whom the Gospel subdues to his obedience.
No sooner were the Collossians delivered out of the power of darkness, but
they were immediately translated into the Kingdom of Christ the dear Son. 1
Col. 13.

This Kingdom of Christ which is our present subject, is the internal spiritual
Kingdom, which is said to be within the Saints. Luke 17.20, 21. The Kingdom of
God is within you. Christ sits as an enthroned King in the Hearts, Consciences
and affections of his willing people. Psalm. 110.3. And his Kingdom consists in
Right^ousness Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. Romans 14.17. And is properly
Monarchical, Internum regimen est mo^archicum, and non potest non esse. Nulli
enim tribui debet jus regendi hominum conscientiam, praeterquam ei qui idem est
sapientissimus, and potentissimus. Neque in hoc regimine Christus habet
vicarium potentiae, atque potestatis sua.
as appears in the Margent.

In the prosecution of this point, I will speak Doctrinally to these three
heads.

First, How Christ obtains this throne in the hearts of men. Secondly, How he
rules in it, and by what acts he exercises his Kingly authority. Thirdly, What
are the privileges of those souls over whom Christ raigns. And then apply it.
First, Nam infinita potestas quantumuis vicaria sit, in hominem nullum cadere
potestum etiam est quoddam genus unionis quod vicarium omnem excludat ut
Patris, and Filii; Mariti and Uxois, nam hic certe vicariatus no^ potest habere
locum. Maccov. loc. cem. p. 641.
We will open the way and manner in which Christ obtains a Throne in the hearts
of men: and that is by conquest. For though the souls of the Elect are his by
donation, and right of redemption; the Father gave them to him, and he died for
them: yet Satan has the first possession; and so it fares with Christ, as it
did with Abraham; to whom God gave the Land of Canaan by promise and Covenant;
but the Cananites, Perezites, and sons of Anak had the actual possession of it,
and Abraham's posterity must fight for it, and win it by inches before they
enjoy it. The house is conveyed to Christ by him that built it, but the strong
man armed keeps the possession of it, till a stronger than he comes and ejects
him. Luke 11.20, 21, 22. Christ must fight his way into the soul, though, he
have right to enter as into his dearly purchased possession. And so he does,
for when the time of recovering them is come, he sends forth his Armies to
subdue them. As it is Psalm. 110.3. The people shall be willing in the day of
thy power. The Hebrew may as fitly be rendered, (...)
and is so by some, in the day of thine Armies. In die exercitus t^i, cum
scilicet misis Apostolis and aliis ecclesiarum doctoribus voce evangeli inter
gentes colliges and constitues tibi regnum Mol^er ^n loc.
When the Lord Jesus sent forth his Armies of Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists,
Pastors, Teachers, under the conduct of his Spirit; armed with that two edged
sword, the word of God, which is sharp and powerful. Heb. 4.12. But that is not
all, he causes Armies of convictions and spiritual troubles to begird and
straighten them on every side; so that they know not what to do. These
convictions like a shower of Arrows, strike point blanck into their
Consciences. Acts 2.37. When they heard this they were pricked to the heart,
and said men and brethren what shall we do! Christ's Arrows are sharp in the
hearts of his enemies, whereby the people fall under him, Psalm. 45.5, 6. by
these convictions he batters down all their loose vain hopes, and levels them
with the earth.

Now all their weak pleas and defenses, from the general mercy of God, the
examples of others, etc. prove but as paperwalls to them. These shake their
hearts, even to the foundation. And overturn every high thought there, that
exalts it self against the Lord. This day in which Christ sits down before the
soul, and summons it by such messengers as these, is a day of distress within;
yea, such a day of trouble that none is like it. But though it be so: yet Satan
has so deeply intrencht himself in the mind, and will, that the soul yields
not at the first summons, till its provisions within are spent, and all its
Towers of Pride, and Walls of vain confidence be undermined by the Gospel, and
shaken down about its ears: and then the soul desires a parley with Christ. O
now it would be glad of terms, any terms. If it may but save its life, let all
go as a prey to the Conqueror. Now it sends many such messages as these to
Christ, who is come now to the very gates of the soul, mercy Lord, mercy; O
were I but assured thou would receive, spare and pardon me, I would open to
thee the next moment. Thus the soul is shut up to the faith of Christ, as it is
Gal. 3.23. and reduced now to the greatest straight and loss imaginable; and
now the merciful King, whose only design is to conquer hearts, hangs forth the
white flag of mercy before the soul, giving it hopes it shall be spared, pitied
and pardoned, though so long in rebellion against him: If yet it will yield it
self to Christ: many staggerings, hesitations, irresolutions, doubts, fears,
scruples, half-resolves, reasonings for and against there are at the
Council Table of man's own heart at this time. Sometimes there is no hope,
Christ will slay me, if I go forth to him, and then it trembles. But then,
whoever found him so, that tried him? Other souls have yielded, and found mercy
beyond all their expectation. Oh but I have been a desperate enemy against him.
Admit it, yet thou have the word of a King for it; let the wicked forsake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him turn to the Lord, and he
will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon him. Isa.
55.7.

But the time of mercy is past, I have stood out too long. Yet, if it were so,
how is it that Christ has not made short work and cut me off. Set fire, Hell
fire to my soul, and withdrawn the siege? Still he waits that he may be
gracious, and is exalted that he may have compassion. A thousand such debates
there are, till at last the soul considering, if it abide in rebellion, it must
needs perish; if it go forth to Christ, it can but perish; and being somewhat
encouraged by the messages of grace sent into the soul at this time, such as
that, Heb. 7.25. Wherefore he is able to save to the utmost all that come unto
God by him. And that, Joh. 6.37. He that comes to me, I will in no wise cast
out. And that, Matthew. 11.28. Come unto me ye that are weary, and heavy laden,
and I will give you rest. It is at last resolved to open to Christ. And says,
stand open ye everlasting gates, and be ye opened ye everlasting doors; the
King of glory shall come in. Now the will spontaneously opens to Christ. That
fort Royal submits, and yields. And all the affections open to him. The will
brings Christ the keys of all the rooms in the soul. Concerning this Triumphant
entrance of Christ into the soul, we may say, as the Psalmist rhetorically
speaks concerning the Triumphant entrance of Israel into Canaan, Psalm. 114.5,
6. The Mountains skipped like Rams, and the little Hills like Lambs; what ailed
thee O thou Sea, that thou fleddest? thou, Jordan that thou wast driven back?
So here in a like rhetorical Triumph we may say, the Mountains and Hills skip
like Rams, the fixed and obstinate Will, starts from its own basis, and center.
The Rocky heart rends in twain. A poor soul comes to the Word full of
ignorance, pride, self-love, desperate hardness, and fixed resolutions to go on
in its way. And by an hours discourse, the tide turns; Jordan is driven back.
What aileth thee thou stout Will, that thou surrendrest to Christ? Thou hard
heart, that thou relentest, and the waters gushed out! And thus the soul is won
to Christ. He writes down his terms, and the soul willingly subscribes them.
Thus it comes in to Christ by free and hearty submission: desiring nothing more
than to come under the government of Christ, for time to come.

Secondly, Let us see how Christ rules in the souls of such as

First, He imposes a new Law upon them, It is proper to Christ who rules
absolutely and monarchically over the sou^s and consciences of men, to bi^d
them by his own authority. None but Christ can do i^, 1. Because this Authority
of Christ is infinite. 2. Because it is the authoirty of an Husband, which
cannot be communicated to any other. 1. Cor. 9.21, 22.
and enjoins them to be severe and punctual in their obedience to it. The soul
was a Belialite before, and could endure no restraint. It Is Lusts gave it Law.
We our selves were sometimes, foolish, disobedient, serving diverse lusts, and
pleasures. Tit. 3.3. What ever the flesh craved, and the sensual appetite
whined after it must have; cost what it would cost: if damnation were the price
of it, it would have it, provided it should not be present pay. Now it must not
be any longer (...) without Law to God: but under Law to Christ. Those are the
articles of peace which the soul willingly signs in the day of its admission
to mercy, Matthew. 11.29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me. This Law of the
Spirit of life, which is in Christ Jesus, makes them free from the Law of sin
and death, Romans 8.2. Here Is much strictness, but no bondage. For the Law is not
only written in Christ's Statute-book the Bible, but coppied out by his spirit
upon the hearts of his subjects, in correspondent principles, which makes
obedience a pleasure, and self-denial easy. Christ's yoke is lined with Love:
so that it never galls the necks of his people. 1 John 5.3. His commandments
are not grievous. The soul that comes under Christ's government, must receive
Law from Christ; and under Law every thought of the heart must come. Secondly,
He rebukes and chastises souls for the violations and trangressions of his Law.
That Is another act of Christ's Regal authority: whom he loves he rebukes and
chastens. Heb. 12.6, 7. These chastisements of Christ are either by the rod of
providence upon their bodies and outward comforts, or upon their spirits and
inward comforts. Sometimes his rebukes are smart upon the outward man. 1 Cor.
11.30. For this cause many among you are weakly, and sick, and many sleep. They
had not that due regard to his body that became them, and he will make their
bodies to smart for it. And he had rather their flesh should smart, than their
souls should perish. Sometimes he spares their outward, and afflicts their
inner man, which is a much smarter rod. He withdraws peace, and takes away joy
from the spirits of his people. The hidings of his face, are sore rebukes.
However, all is for emendation, not for destruction. And it is not the least
privilege of Christ's Subjects to have a seasonable and sanctified rod to
reduce them from the ways of sin. Psalm. 23.3. thy rod, and thy staff they
comfort me. Others are suffered to go on stubbornly in the way of their own
hearts. Christ will not spend a rod upon them for their good. Will not call
them to account for any of their transgressions: but will reckon with them for
altogether in Hell. Thirdly, Another Regal Act of Christ, is the restraining
and keeping back his servants from iniquity, and withholding them from those
courses which their own hearts would incline and lead them to. For even in them
there is a spirit bent to backsliding, but the Lord in tenderness over them,
keeps back their souls from iniquity; and that when they are upon the very
brink of sin: my feet were almost gone; my steps were well nigh slipped, Psalm.
73.2. Then does the Lord prevent sin, by removing the occasion providentially:
or by helping them to resist the temptation; gratiouslyly assisting their
spirits in the trial. So that no temptation shall befall them, but a way of
escape shall be opened, that they may be able to bear it, 1 Cor. 10.13. And
thus his people have frequent occasions to bless his name for his preventing
goodness, when they are almost in the midst of all evil. And this I take to be
the meaning of Gal. 5.16 This I say then, walk in the spirit; and ye shall not
fulfill the lusts of the flesh. Tempted by them ye may be, but fulfill them ye
shall not. My spirit shall cause the temptation to die, and wither away in the
womb, in the embrio of it; so that it shall not come to a full birth. Fourthly,
Christ and all his little ones under his two wings, and in the compass or
circle of his arms; is so sure, that Cast him and them in the ground of the
Sea; he shall come up again, and not lose one. An odd one cannot, nor shall not
be lost in the telling.
He protects them in his ways, and suffers them not to relapse fom him into a
state of sin and bondage to Satan any more. Indeed he is restless in his
endeavors to reduce them again to his obedience; he never leaves tempting and
soliciting for their return; and where he finds a false professor he prevails:
but Christ keeps his that they depart not again. Joh. 17.12. All that thou have
given me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition. They
are kept, by the mighty power of God, through faith to salvation. 1 Pet. 1.5.
Kept as in a Garrison according to the importance of that word. None more
solicited, none more safe than the people of God. They are preserved in Christ
Jesus. Jude 1. It is not their own grace that secures them, but Christ's care,
and continual watchfulness. Our own graces left to themselves, would quickly
prove but weights sinking us to our own ruin. As one speaks, this is his
Covenant with them. Jer. 32.4. I will put my fear in their inwards, and they
shall not depart from me. Perfectiones sibi relictae, sunt pond^ra ad r^inam.
Ge^s.
Thus a King he preserves them. Fifthly, As a King he rewards their obedience,
and encourages their sincere services. Though all they do for Christ be duty,
yet he has united their comfort with their duty. This I had, because I kept
thy precepts. Psalm. 119.56. They are engaged to take this encouragement with
them to every duty, that he whom they seek, is a bountiful rewarder of such as
diligently seek him. Heb. 11.6. O what a good master do the Saints serve! Hear
how a King expostulates with his Subjects, Jer. 2.31. Have I been a barren
wilderness, on a land of darkness to you? q. d. Have I been such a hard master
to you? Have you any reason to complain of my service? To whomsoever I have
been straight-handed, surely I have not been so to you. You have not found the
ways or wages of sin like mine. Sixthly, He pacifies all inward troubles, and
commands peace when their spirits are tumultuous. Brab ^tem agit, sive
Agonoth^tam inter cateros affectus nam (...) id sig^ificat cum igit^r insergunt
in cordibus nostris turbidi affectus i^ae, odii, viadictae, hic pax Dei debet
suum officium facere (i. e.) i^s^ar a^onethetae li^es dirinero. Daven in Col.
This peace of god Rules in their hearts. Col. 3.15. it does (...) act the part
of an Umpire, in appeasing strife within. When the tumultuous affections are
up, and in a hurry; when anger, hatred, and revenge begin to rise in the soul,
this hushes and stills all. I will hearken (says the Church) what God the Lord
will speak, for he will speak peace to his people and to his Saints, Psalm.
85.8. He that says to the raging Sea be still, and it obeys him; he only can
pacify the disquieted spirit. They say of Frogs, that if they be croaking
never so much in the night, bring but a light among them, and they are all
quiet. Such a light is the peace of God, among our disordered affections. These
are Christ's Regal acts. And he puts them forth upon the souls of his people,
powerfully, sweetly, suitably.
First, Powerfully: whether he restrains from sin, or impels to duty he does it
with a soul determining efficacy. For his Kingdom is not in word, but in power.
1 Cor. 4.20. And those whom his Spirit leads, go bound in the spirit, to the
fulfilling and discharge of their duties. Acts 20.22. And yet,

Secondly, He rules not by compulsion, but most sweetly. His Law is a Law of
Love, written upon their hearts. The Church is the Lambs wife, Rev. 19.7. A
bruised reed he shall not break, and smoking flax he shall not quench. Isa.
42.2, 3. I beseech you by the meekness, and gentleness of Christ, says ^he
Apostle, 2 Cor. 10.1. for he delights in free, not in forced obedience. He
rules children not slaves. And so his Kingly power is mixed with Fatherly love.
His yoke is not made of Iron, but Gold.

Thirdly, He rules them suitably to their natures: in a rational way: Hos.
11.4. I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of Love, (i. e.) in a way
proper to convince their reason and work upon their ingenuity. And thus his
internal Kingdom is administered by his Spirit, who is his prorex or vicegerent
in our hearts.

Thirdly, And Lastly we will open the privileges pertaining to

First, Those souls ever whom Christ raigns, are certainly, and fully set free
from the curse of the Law. If the Son make you free, then are you free indeed,
Joh. 8.36. I say not they are free from the Law as a rule of life; such a
freedom were no privilege to them at all; but free from the rigorous
exactions, and terrible maledictions of it, to hear our liberty proclaimed from
this bondage, is the joyful sound indeed. The blessedst voice that ever our
ears heard. And this all that are in Christ shall hear; if we be led by the
Spirit, we are not under the Law. Gal. 5.18. Blessed are the people that hear
this joyful sound, Psalm. 89.15. Secondly, Another privilege of Christ's
Subjects, is freedom from the dominion of sin. Romans 6.14. Sin shall not reign
over them, (...)
for they are not under the Law, but under grace. One Heaven cannot bear two
Suns. Nor one soul, two Kings. When Christ takes the throne, sin quits it. It Is
true, the being of sin is there still. It Is defiling and troubling power
remains still; but its dominion is abolished. O joyful tidings, O welcome day!
Thirdly, Another privilege of Christ's Subjects, is protection in all troubles
and dangers to which their souls or bodies are exposed. This man shall be the
peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our Land, and when he shall tread in
our Palaces, Mica. 5.5. Kings owe protection to their Subjects. None so able,
so faithful in that work, as Christ. All thou gave me I have kept, and none
is Lost. Joh. 17.12. Fourthly, Another privilege of Christ's Subjects is a
merciful and tender bearing of their burdens and infirmities. They have a meek
and patient King. Tell the daughter of Syon, thy King comes meek and lowly.
Matthew. 21.5. Matthew. 11.29. Take my yoke, and learn of me, for I am meek and
lowly. The meek Moses, could not bear the provocations of the people, Numb.
11.12. but Christ bears them all. He carries the Lambs in his arms, and gently
leads them that be with young. Esa. 42.11. He is one that can have compassion
upon the ignorant, and them that are out of the way. Fifthly, Again, Sweet
peace, and tranquillity of soul, is the privilege of the Subjects of this
Kingdom. For this Kingdom consists in Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost, Romans
14.17. And till souls come under his Scepter, they shall never find peace. Come
unto me ye that are weary I will give you rest. Yet, do not mistake, I say not
they have all actual peace, at all times. No, they often break that peace by
sin; but they have the root of peace: the groundwork and cause of peace. If
they have not peace: yet they have that which is convertible into peace, at any
time. They also are in a state of peace, Romans 5.11. being justified by faith,
we have peace with God. This is feast every day. A mercy which they only can
duly value, that are in the depths of trouble for sin. Sixthly Lastly,
Everlasting Salvation is the privilege of all over whom Christ raigns. Prince,
and Savior are joined together. Acts 5.31. He that can say, thou shall guide
me with thy counsels, may add what follows, and afterward bring me to glory.
Psalm. 73.24. Indeed the Kingdom of grace, does but breed up children for the
Kingdom of glory. And to speak as the thing is, it is the Kingdom of Heaven here
begun. The difference betwixt them is not specifical, but only gradual, and
therefore this as well as that bears the name of the Kingdom of Heaven. The
King is the same, and the Subjects the same. The Subjects of this are shortly
to be translated to that Kingdom. Thus I have named, and indeed but named, some
few of those inestimable privileges of Christ's Subjects. We next apply it.
Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
How great is their sin and misery who continue in bondage to sin and Satan,
and refuse the Government of Christ! Who had rather sit under the shadow of
that bramble, than under the sweet and powerful government of Christ. Satan
writes his Laws in the blood of his Subjects, grinds them with cruel
oppression. Wears them out with bondage to diverse Lusts: and rewards their
service with everlasting misery. And yet how few are weary of it, and willing
to come over to Christ! Behold, (said one of Christ's Heralds) Christ is in the
field: Gurralls Christian Armo^. p. 218.
sent of God to recover his right, and your liberty: His Royal Standard is
pitched in the Gospel, and proclamation made; that if any poor sinners weary of
the Devils Government, and laden with the miserable chains of his Spiritual
bondage, (so as these Irons of his sins, enter into his very soul, to afflict
it with the sense of them) shall thus come and repair to Christ: he shall have
protection from Gods Justice, the Devils wrath, and sins dominion; in a word,
he shall have rest, and that glorious. Isai. 11.10.

And yet how few stir a foot toward Christ? but are willing to have their ears
boared, and be perpetual slaves to that cruel Tyrant. O when will sinners be
weary of their bondage, and sigh after deliverance! If any such poor soul shall
read these lines; let him know, and I do proclaim it in the name of my Royal
Master, and give him the word of a King for it, he shall not be rejected by
Christ. Ioh. 6.37. Come poor sinners, come; the Lord Jesus is a merciful King;
and never did, nor will hang up that poor penitent, that puts the rope about
his own neck, and submits to mercy.

Inference 2.
How much does it concern us to enquire and know whose government we are under,
Infer. 2.
and who is King over our Souls? Whether Christ or Satan be in the Throne, and
sways the Scepter over our souls.

Reader, the work I would now engage thy soul in, is the same that Jesus Christ
will thoroughly and effectually do in the great day. Then will he gather out of
his Kingdom every thing that offends, separate the tares, and wheat. Divide the
whole world into two ranks, or grand divisions; how many divisions and
sub-divisions soever there be in it now. it nearly concerns thee therefore to
know who is Lord and King in thy soul. To help thee in this great work make use
of the following hints, for I cannot fully prosecute these things as I would.

First, O how many of us would have Christ divided in two halves, that we might
take the half of him only, and take his office, Jesus, and Salvation; but Lord
is a cumbersom word, and to obey, and work out our own Salvation, and perfect
holiness, is the cumbersom, and stormy northside of Christ, and that we eschew
and shift off.
To whom do you yield your obedience? His Subjects and servants ye are to whom
ye obey. Romans 6.16. It Is but a mockery to give Christ the empty titles of Lord
and King, whilst ye give your real service to sin, and Satan. What is this but
like the Jews to bow the knee to him, and say hail Master and crucify him?
Then are ye his disciples, if ye do whatsoever he commands you. Joh. 15.14. He
that is Christ's servant in jest, shall be damned in earnest. Christ does not
complement with you. His Pardons, Promises, Salvations are real; O let your
obedience be so too. Let it be sincere, and universal obedience; this will
evidence your unfeigned subjection to Christ. Do not dare to enterprise any
thing, till you know Christ's pleasure and Will. Romans 12.2. Enquire of Christ,
as David did of the Lord, 1 Samuel 23.9, 10, 11. Lord may I do this, or that, or
shall I forbear? I beseech thee tell thy Servant. Secondly, Have you the power
of godliness, or a form of it only? There be many that do but trifle in
Religion, and play about the skirts and borders of it: spending their time
about jejune and barren controversies; but as to the power of Religion and life
of Godliness, which consists in communion with God in duties and ordinances,
which promotes holiness; and mortifies their Lusts, they concern not themselves
about these things. But surely, the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power.
1 Cor. 4.20. It is not meat and drink, (that is, dry disputes about meats and
drinks) but righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, for he that in
these things serves Christ, is acceptable to God; and approved of men. Romans
14.17, 18. O I am afraid when the great Host of Professors shall be tried by
these rules, they will shrink up into a little handful; as Gideons Host did.
Thirdly, Have ye the special saving knowledge of Christ? All his Subjects are
translated out of the Kingdom of darkness. 1 Col. 13. The Devil that rules
over you in the days of your ignorance, is called the Ruler of the darkness of
this world. His Subjects are all blind: else he could never rule them. As Soon
as their eyes be opened, they run out of his Kingdom. And there is no retaining
them in subjection to him any longer. O enquire then, whether you are brought
out of darkness, into his marvelous light. Do ye see your condition how sad,
miserable, wretched i^ is by nature? Do ye see your remedy, as it lies only in
Christ; and his precious blood? Do ye see the true way of obtaining interest in
that blood, by faith? Does this knowledge run into practice, and put you upon
lamenting heartily your misery by sin? Thirsting vehemently after Christ, and
his Righteousness? Striving continually for an heart to believe, and close with
Chirst? This will evidence you indeed to be translated out of the Kingdom of
darkness, into the Kingdom of Christ. Fourthly, With whom do ye delightfully
associate your selves, who are your chosen Companions? Ye may ^ee to whom ye
belong by the Company you join your selves to. What do the Subjects of Christ
among the slaves of Satan? If the Subjects of one Kingdom, be in another Kings
dominions; they love to be together with their own Countrymen; rather than the
natives of the place: so do the servants of Christ. They are a company of
themselves, as it is said, Act. 4.23. They went to their own Company. I know
the Subjects of both Kingdoms are here mingled, and we cannot avoid the company
of sinners, except we go out of the world. 1 Cor. 5.10. But yet all your
delights should be in the Saints, and in the excellent of the earth. Psalm.
16.3. Fifthly, Do ye live Holy and Righteous lives? If not, you may claim
interest in Christ as your King; but he will never allow your claim. The
Scepter of his Kingdom is a Scepter of Righteousness. Psalm. 45.6. If ye
oppress, go beyond, and cheat your brethren, and yet call your selves Christ's
Subjects; what greater reproach can ye study to cast upon him? What, is Christ
the King of Cheats? Does he patronize such things as these? No, no, pull off
your vizards, and fall into your own places; you belong to another Prince, and
not to Christ.
Inference 3.
Does Christ exercise such a Kingly power over the souls of all them that are
subdued by the Gospel to him; Infer. 3.
O then let all that are under Christ's government walk as the Subjects of such
a King. Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbi^.
Imitate your King: the examples of Kings are very influential upon their
Subjects. Your King has commanded you, not only to take his yoke upon you, but
also to learn of him. Matthew. 11.29. Yea, and if any man say that he is Christ's,
let him walk even as Christ walked, 1 John 2.6. Your King is meek and patient.
Isai. 53.7. As a Lamb for meekness, shall his Subjects be Lions for fierceness?
Your King was humble and lowly. Matthew. 21.5. Behold the King comes meek and
lowly. Will ye be proud and lofty? Does this become the Kingdom of Christ? Your
King was a self-denying King. He could deny his outward comforts, ease, honor,
life to serve his Fathers design, and accomplish. your Salvation. 2 Cor. 8.9. 2
Phil, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Shall his servants be self-ended, and self-seeking
persons? that will expose his honor, and hazard their own souls for the
trifles of time? God forbid. Your King was painful, laborious, and diligent in
fulfilling his work, Ioh. 9.3. Let not his servants be lasie, and slothful. O
imitate your King; follow the pattern of your King: this will give you comfort
now, and boldness in the day of Judgment, if as he was, so ye are in this
world. 1 Ioh. 4.17.

The SEVENTEENTH Sermon. 17.
SERMON. Opens the Kingly Office of Christ as it is providentially executed
upon the world, for the Redeemed.

IEPH. XXII. And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
head, over all things to the Church.


THE foregoing verses are spent in a thankful and humble adoration of the grace
of God, in bringing these Ephesians to believe in Christ. This effect of that
power that raised their hearts to believe in Christ; is here compared with that
other glorious effect of it, even the raising of Christ himself from the dead.
Both these owe themselves to the same efficient cause. It raised Christ from a
low estate, even from the dead, to an high, a very high and glorious state: to
be the head both of the world, and of the Church: the head of the world, by way
of dominion; the head of the Church, by way of union, and special influence:
ruling the world for the good of his people in it. He gave him to be the head
over all things to the Church.

In this Scripture, let these four things be seriously heeded.

First, The dignity and authority committed to Christ. He has put all things
under his feet: which implies full, ample, and absolute dominion in him; and
subjection in them over whom he raigns. This power is delegated to him by the
Father. For besides the essential, native, ingenite power and dominion over
all, which he has as God; and is common to every person in the Godhead, Psalm.
22.28. there is a mediatory dispensed authority; which is proper to him as
Mediator which he receives as the reward, or fruit of his suffering, Phil. 2.8.
Secondly, The subject recipient of this authority, which is Christ; and Christ
primarily, and only. He is the (...), first receptacle of all authority and
power. Whatever authority any creature is clothed with, is but Ministerial,
and derivative; whether it be Political, or Ecclesiastical. Christ is the only
Lord Jude 4. the fountain of all power. Thirdly, The Object of this authority.
The whole creation. All things are put under his feet. He rules from Sea, to
Sea; even to the utmost bounds of Gods creation. Thou have given him power over
all flesh, Joh. 17.2. all creatures, rational, and irrational; animate, and
inanimate; Angels, Devils, Men, Winds, Seas all obey him. Lastly, And
Especially take notice of the finis cui, end for which he governs, In bonum
ecclesiae obticet hoc imperium. Grotius in loc.
and rules the universal Empire. It is to the Church, (i. e.) for the
advantage, comfort, and Salvation of that chosen remnant he died for. He
purchased the Church, and that he might have the highest security that his
blood should not be lost, God the Father has put all things into his hand; to
order and dispose all as he pleases. For the furtherance of that his design
and end. As he bought the persons of some, so the services of all the rest; and
that they might effectually serve the end, they are designed to, Christ will
order them all, in a blessed subordination and subserviency thereunto. Hence
the Point is,
DOCT. That all the Affairs of the Kingdom of providence, Doct.
are ordered and determined by Jesus Christ, for the special advantage, and
everlasting good of his redeemed people.
Joh. 17.2. As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he should give
eternal life, to as many as thou have given him. Hence it comes to pass, that
all things work together for good, to them that love God; to them that are the
called according to purpose, Romans 8.28.

That Jesus Christ has a providential influence upon all the affairs of this
world, is evident both from Scripture assertions, and rational observations,
made upon the actings of things here below.

The first Chap. of Ezekiel. contains an admirable Scheme or draught of
providence. There you see how all the wheels, that is the motions and
revolutions here on earth, are guided by the spirit that is in them. And verse.
26. it is all run up into the supreme cause. There you find one like the son of
man, which is Jesus Christ, sitting upon the throne, and giving forth orders
from thence, for the government of all. And if it were not so, how is it, that
there are such strong combinations, and predispositions of persons and things
to such ends and issues, without any communications of counsels, or holding of
intelligence with one another? as in Isreal's deliverance out of Egypt, and
innumerable more instances have appeared? Certainly if ten men from several
places should all meet at one place, and about one business, without any
fore-appointment among themselves; it would argue their motions were secretly
overruled by some invisible Agent. How is it that such marvailous effects are
produced in the world, by causes that carry no proportion to them? Amos 5.9.
and 1 Cor. 1.27. And as often the most apt and likely means are rendered wholly
ineffectual? Psalm. 33.16. In a word, if Christ have no such providential influx
how are his people in all ages preserved in the midst of so many millions of
potent and malicious enemies; amongst whom they live, as sheep in the midst of
wolves? Luke 10.3. How is it that the bush burns, and yet is not consumed?
Exodus 3.2.

But my business in this discourse, is not to prove that there is a providence,
which none but Atheists deny. I shall choose rather to show by what Acts Jesus
Christ administers this Kingdom. And in what manner. And what use may be made
thereof.

As to the first, he rules and orders the Kingdom of Providence, by supporting,
permitting, restraining, limiting, protecting, punishing, and rewarding those
over whom he raigns providentially.

Propter Eclesiam in mundo, durat mu^dus; alioquia uno momento conflagraret
coelum and terra: quia mundus non est dignus uno grano tritici, si ^uidem
plenus est blasphemiis and impietate. Nisi oratione and doctrina sustentaret
Ecclesia mundum, uno momento perirent omnia. Luther in Genesis 30.
First, He supports the world, and all creatures in it, by his power. My Father
works hitherto, and I work. Joh. 5.17. And in him (that is in Christ) all
things consist. Col. 1.17. It Is a considerable part of Christ's glory to have a
whole world of creatures oweing their beings and hourly conservations to him.
The parts of the world are not coupled and fastened together as the parts of an
house, whose beams are pinned and nailed to each other; but rather as several
rings of Iron, which hang together by the virtue of a loadstone. This goodly
fabric was raised to the foundation, when sin entered, and had tumbled into
everlasting confusion, had not Christ stepped in to shore up the reeling world.
For the sakes of his redeemed that inhabit it, he does, and will prop it by his
omnipotent power. And when he has gathered all his Elect out of it, into the
Kingdom above; then will he set fire to the four quarters of it, and it shall
lie in white ashes. Mean while, he is given for a Covenant to the people, to
establish the earth. Isai. 49.8.

Secondly, He permits and suffers the worst of creatures in his dominion to be,
and act as they do. The deceived, and the deceiver are his. Job. 12.16. Even
those that fight against Christ, and his people, receive both power, and
permission from him. Say not that it is unbecoming the most holy, to permit such
evils which he could prevent if he pleased. For as he permits no more than he
will overrule to his praise; so that very permission of his, is holy, and just.
Christ's working is not confounded with the creatures. Pure Sunbeams are not
tainted by the noisome vapors of the dunghill on which they shine. His holiness
has no fellowship with their iniquities: nor are their transgressions at all
excused by his permissions of them. He is a rock, his work is perfect; but they
have corrupted themselves. Deuteronomy. 32.4, 5. This holy permission, is but the
withholding of those restraints from their Lusts; and denying those common
assistances which he is no way bound to give them. Acts 14.16. He suffered all
nations to walk in their own ways. And yet should he permit sinful creatures
to act out all the wickedness that is in their hearts, there would neither
remain peace, nor order in the world. And therefore,

Thirdly, He powerfully restrains creatures by the bridle of providence, from
the commission of those things to which their hearts are propense enough. (...)
accinges mont.
Psalm. 76.10. The remainder of wrath thou will restrain, or gird up. Leting
forth just so much as shall serve his holy ends, and no more. And truly this is
one of the glorious mysteries of providence, which amazes the serious and
considerate soul. To see the spirit of a creature fully set to do mischief.
Power enough as one would think, in his hand to do it, and a door of
opportunity standing open for it; and yet the effect strangely hindered. The
strong propensions of the Will are inwardly checked, as in the case of Laban,
Genesis 31.24. or a diversion and rub is strangely cast in their way; as in the
case of Senacharib, 2 King. 19.7, 8. So that their hands cannot perform their
enterprises. Julian had two great designs before him, one was to conquer the
Persians, the other to root out the Galileans; as he by way of contempt called
the Christians: but he will begin with the Persians first, and then make a
sacrifice of all the Christians to his Idols. He does so, and perishes in the
first attempt. O the wisdom of providence!

Fourthly, Jesus Christ limits the creatures in their acting, assigning them
their boundaries, and lines of liberty; to which they may, but beyond it cannot
go. Rev. 2.10. Fear none of those things that ye shall suffer, behold the Devil
shall cast some of you into prison; and ye shall have tribulation for ten
days. They would have cast them into their graves, but it shall only be into
prisons: they would have stretched out their hands upon them all, no, but only
some of them shall be exposed. They would have kept them there perpetually, no,
it must be but for ten days. Ezekiel. 22.6. Behold the Princes of Israel were in
thee, every one to their power to shed blood. They went as far as they had
power to go, not as far as they had will to go. Four hundred and thirty years
were determined upon the people of God in Egypt, and then, even in that very
night, God brought them forth; for then the time of the promise was come, Acts
7.17.

Fifthly, The Lord Jesus providentially protects his people, amidst a world of
enemies, and dangers. It was Christ that appeared unto Moses in the flaming
bush: and preserved it from being consumed. The bush signified the people of
God in Egypt. The fire flaming on it, the exquisite sufferings they there
endured. The safety of the bush amidst the flames, the Lords admirable care and
protection of his poor suffering ones. None so tenderly careful as Christ. As
birds flying, so he defends Jerusalem, Isai. 31.5. (i. e.) as they fly swiftly
toward their nests, crying when their young are in danger; so will the Lord
preserve his. They are preserved in Christ Jesus, Jude 1. as Noah and his
family were in the Ark. Hear how a Worthy of our own expresses himself upon
this point.

Dr* Owen in his indwelling sin. p. 200.
That we are at peace in our houses, at rest in our beds; that we have any quiet
in our enjoyments, is from hence alone. Whose person would not be defiled or
destroyed? whose habitation would not be ruined? whose blood almost would not
be shed, if wicked men had power to perpetrate all their conceived sin? It may
be the ruin of some of us has been conceived a thousand times. We are
beholding to this providence of obstructing sin, for our lives, our families,
our estates, our liberties, and whatsoever is or may be dear to us. For may we
not say sometimes with the Psalmist, Psalm. 57.4. My soul is among Lions, and I
lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are
spears, and their tongue a sharp sword. And how is the deliverance of men
contrived from such persons? Psalm. 58.6. God breaks their teeth in their
mouths, even the great teeth of the young Lions. He keeps this fire from
burning, -- some he cuts off and destroys. Some he cuts short in their power.
Some he deprives of the instruments whereby alone they can work. Some he
prevents of their desired opportunities, or diverts by other objects for their
lusts. And oftentimes causes them to spend them among themselves, one upon
another. We may say therefore with the Psalmist, Psalm. 104.24. O Lord how
manifold are thy works? in wisdom have thou made them all, the earth is full of
thy riches.

Sixthly, He punishes the evil doers; and repaies by providence into their own
lap the mischief they do, or but intend to do unto them that fear him. Pharaoh,
Senacharib, both the Iulians, and innumerable more are the lasting monuments of
this righteous retribution. It Is true, a sinner may do evil an hundred times,
and his days be prolonged: but oft-times God hangs up some eminent sinners in
chains, as spectacles, and warnings to others. Many a heavy blow has
providence given the enemies of God, which they were never able to claw off.
Christ rules, and that with a rod of Iron, in the midst of his enemies. Psalm.
110.2.

Seventhly and Lastly, He rewards by providence the services done to him, and
his people. Out of this treasure of providence God repays oftentimes those that
serve him, and that with an hundred fold reward now in this life. Matthew. 19.29.
This active vigilant providence has its eye upon all the wants, straights and
troubles of the creatures; but especially upon such as Religion brings us unto.
What huge volumes of experiences might the people of God write upon this
subject? And what a pleasant History would it be to read the strange, constant,
wonderful and unexpected actings of providence for them that have left
themselves to its care?

Secondly, We shall next enquire how Jesus Christ administers

And here I must take notice of the means by which, and the manner in which he
does it. The means or instruments he uses in the governing the Providential
Kingdom, (for he cannot be personally present with us himself) are either
Angels or Men; the Angels are ministering creatures sent forth by him for the
good of them that shall be heirs of Salvation. Heb. 1.14. Luther tells us they
have two offices, superius canere, and inferius vigilare, to sing above, and
watch beneath. These do us many invisible offices of love. They have dear and
tender respects and love for the Saints. To them God as it were puts forth his
children to nurse, and they are tenderly careful of them whilst they live, and
bring them home in their arms to their Father when they die. And as Angels, so
Men are the servants of providence: Yea, bad men as well as good. Cyrus on that
account is called Gods servant: they fulfill his will, whilst they are
prosecuting their own lusts. The earth shall help the woman, Rev. 12.16. But
good men delight to serve providence: they, and the Angels are fellow servants
in one house, and to one master. Rev. 19.10. Yea, there is not a creature in
Heaven, or Earth, or Hell, but Jesus Christ can Providentially use it, and
serve his ends, and promote his designs by it. But whatever the Instrument be
Christ uses; of this we may be certain, that his Providential working is Holy,
Judicious, Sovereign, Profound, Irresistible, Harmonious, and to the Saints
peculiar.

First, It Is holy. Though he permits, limits, orders, and overrules many unholy
persons and actions; yet he still works like himself; most holily, and purely
throughout. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
Psalm. 145.17. It Is easier to separate light from a Sunbeam, than holiness from
the works of God. The best of men cannot escape sin in their most holy actions.
They cannot touch, but are defiled. But no sin cleaves to God, whatever he has
to do about it.

Secondly, Christ's providential working is not only most pure and holy; but
also most wise, and Judicious. Ezekiel. 1.20. The wheels are full of eyes: Non
Cae^o impe^u voluntur rotae.
they are not moved by a blind impetus, but in deep counsel and wisdom. And
indeed the wisdom of providence manifests it self principally in the choice of
such states for the people of God, as shall most effectually promote their
eternal happiness. And herein it goes quite beyond our understandings, and
comprehensions. It makes that medicinal, and salutiferous, which we judge as
destructive to our comfort and good, Beatus in Deo vid^t res omnes accommodatas
ad se pertinentes; and omnes circumstantias accommodatas Suarez.
as poison. I remember it is a note of Suarez, speaking of the felicity of the
other world; then (says he) the blessed shall see in God, all things and
circumstances pertaining to them, excellently accommodated, and attempered.
Then they shall see that the crossing of their desires was the saving of their
souls. And that they had, if they had not perished. The most wise Providence
looks beyond us. It eyes the end, and suits all things thereto; and not to our
fond desires.

Thirdly, The Providence of Christ is most supreme, and sovereign. Whatsoever
he pleases, that he does, in Heaven, and Earth; and in all places. Psalm.
135.6. He is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, Caput ejus aurum auri, quo
significatur praec^lens super omnia dignitas regni Christi. Aurum enim in
capite, est in sign regium, ex quo Coronae fiunt, igitur aurum auri perinde
valere videtur, atque Rex Regum. Brightman in Cant.
Rev. 19.16. The greatest Monarchs on Earth, are but as little bits of clay. As
the worms of the earth to him. They all depend on him. Prove. 8.15, 16. By me
Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice, by me Princes rule, Nobles, even all
the Judges of the Earth.

Fourthly Providence is profound and inscrutable. The Judgments of Christ are
as the great deeps, and his footsteps are not known, Psalm. 36 6. There are hard
texts in the works, as well as in the words of Christ* The wisest heads have
been at a loss, in interpreting some providence. Ier. 12.1, 2. Job. 21.7. The
Angels had the hands of a man under their wings. Ezekiel. 1.8. ( i. e.) They
wrought secretly, and mysteriously.

Fifthly, Per montes intelligat arcanum Dei consilium. Calv.
Providence is irresistible in its designs and motions, for all providence are
but the fulfillings and accomplishments of Gods immutable decrees, Ephesians. 1.11.
He works all things according to the counsel of his own will. Hence Zech. 6.1.
The Instruments by which God executed his wrath, are called Chariots coming
from betwixt two mountains of brass. Firmissima and inscrutabilia Dei concilia.
Drusius.
(i. e.) the firm and immutable decrees of God. When the Jews put Christ to
death* they did but do that the hand and counsel of God had before determined
to be done. Acts 4.28. So that none can oppose, or resist Providence. I will
work, and who shall let. Isa. 43.13.

Sixthly, The Providence of Christ are Harmonious. There are secret chains,
and invisible connexions betwixt the works of Christ. We know not how to
reconcile promises, and providence together: nor yet providence one with
another: but certainly they all work together, Romans 8.28. as adjuvant causes,
or con-causes standing under, and working by the influence of the first cause.
He does not do and undo. Destroy by one providence, what he built by another.
But look as all seasons of the year, the nipping frosts, as well as halcion
days of summer, do all conspire and conduce to the harvest; so it is in
providence.

Seventhly, Lastly, The providence of Christ work in a special and peculiar
way, for the good of the Saints. His providential, is subordinated to his
Spiritual Kingdom. He is the Savior of all men, especially of them that
believe. 1 Timothy 4.10. These only have the blessing of providence. Things are so
laid and ordered, as that their eternal good shall be promoted and secured by
all that Christ does.

Inference 1.
Inf^r. 1.
If so, See then in the first place, to whom you are beholding for your lives,
liberties, comforts, and all that you enjoy in this world. Is it not Christ
that takes order for you. He is indeed in Heaven, out of your sight; but though
you see him not, he sees you, and takes care for all your concerns. When one
told Silentiarius of a plot laid to take away his life, S^lent^a^ius.
he answered, Si Deus mei curam non habet, quid vivo? if God take not care of
me, how do I live? how have I escaped hitherto? In all thy ways acknowledge
him. Prove. 3.6. It Is he that has espied out that state thou art in, as most
proper for thee. It Is Christ that does all for you that is done. He looks down
from Heaven upon all that fear him; he sees when you are in danger by
Temptation, and casts in a providence you know not how, to hinder it. He sees
when you are sad, and orders reviving providence to refresh you. He sees when
corruptions prevail, and orders humbling providence to purge them. Whatever
mercies you have received, all along the way you have gone hitherto, are the
orderings of Christ for you. And you shall carefully observe how the promises,
and providence have kept equal pace with one another; and both gone step by
step with you until now.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Has God left the government of the whole world in the hands of Christ, and
trusted him over all, then do ye also leave all your particular concerns in the
hands of Christ too, and know that the infinite wisdom and love which rules the
world, manages every thing that relates to you. It is in a good hand, and
infinitely better than if it were in your own. Monendus est Philippus ut
definat esse rector mundi. Melch. Adams.
I remember when Melanchthon was under some despondencies of spirit about the
estate of Gods people in Germany; Luther chides him thus for it, desinat*
Philippus, esse rector mundi, let Philip cease to rule the world. It Is none of
our work to steer the course of providence, or direct its motions; but to
submit quietly to him that does. There is an Itch in men, yea, in the best of
men, to be disputing with God Let me talk with thee of thy Judgments, says
Jeremy, Jer. 32.1, 2. Yea, how apt are we to regret at providence, as if it
had no conducency at all to the glory of God, or to our good. Exodus 5.22. Yea,
to limit providence, to our way and time: thus the Israelites tempted God, and
limited the Holy One, Psalm. 78.20, 41. How often also do we unbelievingly
distrust providence, as though it could never accomplish what we profess to
expect and believe? Ezekiel. 37.11. Our bones are dry, our hope is lost; we are
cut off for our part. So Genesis 18.13, 14. Isai. 40.27. There are but few
Abraham's among believers, who against hope, believed in hope; giving glory to
God. Romans 4.20. And it is but too common for good men to repine and fret at
providence, when their wills, lusts, or humors are crossed by it. This was the
great sin of Jonah. Brethren, these things ought not to be so. Did you but
seriously consider, either the design of providence, which is to bring about
the gracious designs, and purposes of God upon you, which were laid before this
world was. Ephesians. 1.11. or that it is a lifting up of thy wisdom, against his; as
if thou could better order thine affairs, if thou had the conduct and
management of them. Or that you have to do herein with a great and dreadful
God, in whose hands you are as the clay in the Potters hand, that may do what
he will with you, and all that is yours, without giving you an account of any
of his matters. Job 33.13. Or whether providence has cast others, as good by
nature as your selves; tumbled them down from the top of health, wealth,
honors and pleasures to the bottom of Hell.

Or Lastly, Did you but consider how often it has formerly baffled, and
befooled your selves. Made you retract with shame, your rash headlong censures
of it: and enforced you by the sight of its births and issues, to confess your
folly and ignorance as Asaph did, Psalm. 73.22. I say if such considerations as
these could but have place with you in your troubles, and temptations, they
would quickly mould your hearts into a better and more quiet frame.

O that I could but persuade you to resign all to Christ. He is a cunning
workman, Duo habet significata, artificem probatum, and artificem in art sua
excellentem. Glass.
as he he is called, Prove. 8.30. and can effect what he pleases. It Is a good
rule de operibus Dei non est judicandum, ante quintum actum. Let God work out
all that he intends, have but patience till he has put the last hand to his
work, and then find fault with it, if you can. You have heard of the patience
of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord. Iam. 5.11.

Infer. 3.
If Christ be Lord and King over the providential Kingdom, and that for the good
of his people, Magna consolatio quod tantun imperium habet is, qui id exercet
Ecclesiae bono, sicut caput consulit corpori. Grotius.
let none that are Christ's henceforth stand in a slavish fear of creatures.
It Is a good note that Grotius has upon my text: It Is a marvailous consolation
(says he) that Christ has so great an Empire, and that he governs it for the
good of his people, as an head consulting the good of the body. Our Head and
Husband is Lord General of all the Hosts of Heaven and Earth. No creature can
move hand, or tongue without his leave, or order. The power they have is given
them from above, Ioh. 19.11, 12. The serious consideration of this truth will
make the feeblest spirit cease trembling, and fall a singing. Psalm. 47.7. The
Lord is King of all the earth, sing ye praises with understanding: that is (as
some well paraphase it) every one that has understanding of this comfortable
truth. Has he not given you abundant security in many express promises, that
all shall issue well for you that fear him? Romans 8.28. All things shall work
together for good, to them that love God. And Eccles. 8.12. Verily it shall be
well with them that fear God, even with them that fear before him. And suppose
he had not, yet the very understanding of our relation to such a King, should
in it self be sufficient security. For he is the Psalm. 2.8.
universal, Prove. 8.15.
supreme, Rev. 1.18.
absolute, Mat. 21.5.
meek and merciful, Psalm. 45.4.
victorious, 1 Timothy 1.17.
and immortal King.

He sits in glory at the Fathers right hand, and to make his seat the easier,
his enemies are a footstool for him. His love to his people is unspeakably
tender, See my Saint indeed. p. 70, etc.
and fervent. He that touches them, touches the apple of his eye Zech. And it is
hardly imaginable that Jesus Christ will sit still, and suffer his enemies to
thrust out his eyes. Till this be forgotten, the wrath of man is not feared,
Isai. 51.12, 13. He that fears a man that shall die, forgets the Lord his
Maker: he loves you too well, to sign any order to your prejudice, and without
his order none can touch you.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
If the Government of the world, be in the hands of Christ, then our engaging
and entitling of Christ to all our affairs and business, is the true and ready
way to their success and prosperity. if all depend upon his pleasure, then sure
it is your wisdom to take him along with you to every action and business. It Is
no lost time, that is spent in prayer, wherein we ask his leave, and beg his
presence with us. And take it for a clear truth, that which is not prefaced
with prayer, will be followed with trouble. How easily can Jesus Christ dash
all your designs, when they are at the very birth, and article of execution!
and break off in a moment all the purposes of your hearts. It Is a Proverb among
the Papists, that Mass and Meat hinder no nan. The Turks will pray five times a
day how urgent soever their business be. Blush you that enterprise your
affairs, without God. I reckon that business as good as done, to which we have
gotten Christ's leave, and engaged his presence to accompany us to it.

Inference 5.
Lastly, Infer. 5.
Eye Christ in all the events of providence; see his hand in all that befalls
you, whether it be evil, or good. The works of the Lord are great, sought out
of all them that have pleasure therein. Psalm. 111.2. How much good might we
get, by observation of the good, or evil that befalls us throughout our course!

First, In all the evils of trouble and affliction that befall you, eye Jesus
Christ in it all. And set your hearts to the study of these four things in
affliction.

First, Study his Sovereignty and Dominion. For he creates and forms them. They
rise not out of the dust: nor do they befall you casually. But, he raises them
up, and gives them their commission, Jer. 18.11. Behold I create evil, and
devise a device against you. He elects the instrument of your trouble. He makes
the rod as afflictive as he pleases. He orders the continuance, and end of
your troubles. And they will not cease to be afflictive to you, till Christ say
leave off, it is enough. The Centurion wisely considered this, when He told
him, Luke 7.8. I have soldiers under me, and I say to one go, and he goes; to
another come and he comes: meaning, that as his soldiers were at his beck and
command, so diseases were at Christ's beck, to come, and go, as he ordered them.
Secondly, Study the wisdom of Christ in the contrivance of your troubles. And
his wisdom shines out many ways in them. It Is evident in choosing such kinds
of troubles for you. This, and not that; because this is more apt to work upon,
and purge out the corruption that most predominates in you. In the decrees of
your troubles. Suffering them to work to such an height, else not reach their
end; but no higher, least they overwhelm you. Thirdly, Study the tenderness and
compassions of Christ over his afflicted. O think if the Devil had but the
mixing of my cup, how much more bitter would he make it! There would not be one
drop of mercy, no, not of sparing mercy in it, which is the lowest of all sorts
of mercy. But here is much mercy mixed with my troubles. There is mercy in
this, that it is no worse. Am I afflicted, it is the Lords mercy, I am not
consumed. Lam. 3.22. it might have been Hell, as well as this. There is mercy
in his supports under it. Others have, and I might have been left to sink and
perish under my burdens. Mercy, in deliverance out of it. This might have been
everlasting darkness, that should never have had a morning. O the tenderness of
Christ over his afflicted! Fourthly, Study the love of Christ to thy soul in
affliction. Did he not love thee, he would not sanctify a rod to humble or
reduce thee: but let thee alone to rot and perish in thy sin. Rev. 3.19. whom I
love, I rebuke and chasten. This is the device of love, to recover thee to thy
God, and prevent thy ruin. O what an advantage would it be thus to study
Christ, in all your evils that befall you.
Secondly, Eye and study Christ in all the good you receive from the hand of
providence. Turn both sides of your mercies, and view them in all their lovely
circumstances.

First, Eye them in their suitableness. How conveniently Providence has
ordered all things for thee. Thou have a narrow heart, and a small estate,
suitable to it. Had thou more of the world, it would be like a large sail, to
a little boat, which would quickly pull thee under water. Thou have that which
is most suitable to thee, of all conditions.

Secondly, Eye the seasonableness of thy mercies; how they are timed to an
hour. Providence brings forth all its fruits in due season.

Thirdly, Eye the peculiar nature of thy mercies. Others have common, thou
special ones. Others have but a single, thou a double sweetness in thy
enjoyments: one natural from the matter of it, another spiritual from the way
in which, and end for which it comes.

Fourthly, Observe the order in which providence sends you your mercies. See
how one is linked strangely to another; and is a door to let in many. Sometimes
one mercy is introductive to a thousand.

Fifthly and Laslty, Observe the constancy of them; they are new every morning.
Lam. 3.23. How assiduously does God visit thy soul and body! Think with thy
self, if there were but a suspension of the care of Christ for one hour, that
hour would be thy ruin. Thousands of evils stand round about thee, watching
when Christ will but remove his eye from thee; that they may rush in, and
devour thee.

Could we thus study the providence of Christ in all the good, and evil that
befalls us in the world; then in every state we should be content, Phil. 4.11.
Then we should never be stopped, but furthered in our way by all that falls out.
Then would our experiences swell to great volumes, which we might carry to
Heaven with us. And then should we answer all Christ's ends in every state he
brings us into. Do this and say,

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
Sermon. 18.
The EIGHTEENTH SERMON. Opens the necessity of Christ's humiliation in order to
the execution of all these his blessed Offices for us; and particularly of his
humiliation by Incarnation.

PHIL. II.VIII. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
became obedient to death; even the death of the Cross.


YOU have heard how Christ was invested with the Offices of Prophet, Priest and
King, for the carrying on the blessed design of our Redemption; the excution of
these Offices necessarily required that he should be both deeply abased, and
highly exalted. He cannot as our Priest offer up himself a Sacrifice to God for
us, except he be humbled, and humbled to death. He cannot as a King powerfully
apply the virtue of that his Sacrifice, except he be exalted, yea, highly
exalted. Had he not stooped to the low estate of a man, he had not as a Priest
had a Sacrifice of his own to offer; as a Prophet, he had not been fit to teach
us the will of God, so as that we should be able to bear it: as a King he had
not been a suitable head to the Church: And had he not been highly exalted,
that Sacrifice had not been carried within the vail, before the Lord. Those
discoveries of God could not have been universal, effectual and abiding. The
Government of Christ could not have secured, protected and defended the
Subjects of his Kingdom.

The infinite wisdom prospecting all this, ordered that Christ should first be
deeply humbled, then highly exalted: both which states of Christ are presented
to us by the Apostle in this context.

He that intends to build high, lays the foundation deep, and low. Christ must
have a distinct glory in Heaven, transcending that of Angels and men. (For the
Saints will know him from all others by his glory, as the Sun is known from the
lesser Stars.) And as he must be exalted infinitely above them, so he must
first, in order thereunto be humbled and abased as much below them. His form
was marred more than any man's, and his visage more than the Sons of men. The
ground colors are a deep sable, which afterward are laid on with all the
splendour and glory of Heaven.

Method requires that we first speak to this state of Humiliation.

And to that purpose I have read this Scripture to you: which pesents you, the
Sun under an (almost total) eclipse. He that was beautiful and glorious. (...).
Isai. 4.2. Yea, glorious as the only begotten of the Father, Ioh. 1.14. yea,
the glory, James 2.1. Yea, the splendour and brightness of the Fathers glory,
Heb. 1.3. was so veiled, clouded, and debased; that he looked not like himself,
a God: no nor scarce as a man, for with reference to this humbled state it is
said, (...) Desitio virorum abjectus inter viros. Montanus.
Psalm. 22.6. I am a worm, and no man; q. d. rather write me worm, than man. I
am become an abject among men, as that word, Isai. 53.3. signifies. This
humiliation of Christ we have here expressed, in the nature, degrees, and
duration or continuance of it.

First, The nature of it (...), he humbled himself. are all and voluntary
abasement. Loquitur autem non de simulatae and hypocritica humiliatione, sed de
vera and syncera. Zanch. in Loc.
Real, he did not personate a humbled man, nor act the part of one in a debased
state, but was really and indeed humbled; and that not only before men, but
God. As man he was humbled really, as God in respect of his manifestive glory.
And as it was real, so also voluntary. It is not said he was humbled, but he
humbled himself. He was willing to stoop to this low and abject state, for us.
And indeed the voluntariness of his humiliation, made it most acceptable to
God, and singularly commends the love of Christ to us. Non ab alio fuit
humiliatus, sicut angeli mali a Deo praecipitati in barathrum infernale; sed
humiliavit seipsum. Zanch.
That he would choose to stoop to all this ignominy, sufferings and abasement
for us.

Secondly, The degrees of his humiliation; it was not only so low as to become
a man, a man under law; but he humbled himself to become obedient to death,
even the death of the Cross. Here you see the depth of Christ's humiliation,
both specified, it was unto death: and aggravated, even the death of the Cross.
Not only to become a man, but a dead corpse, and that too, hanging on the tree.
Dying the death of a malefactor.

Thirdly, The duration, or continuance of this his humiliation. It continued
from the first moment of his incarnation, to the very moment of his
vivification and quickening in the grave. So the terms of it are fixed here by
the Apostle. From the time he was found in fashion as a man, that is from his
incarnation, unto his death on the Cross, which also comprehends the time of
his abode in the grave. So long his humiliation lasted. Hence the observation
is.

DOCT. That the state of Christ, Doct.
from his Conception, to his Resurrection; was a state of deep abasement, and
humiliation.
We are now entering upon Christ's humbled state, which I shall cast under three
general heads: viz. his Humiliation in his incarnation, in his life, and in his
death. My present work is to open Christ's Humiliation in his incarnation: His
paucis verbis confirmat quae ante dixerat. De vera hominis natura (quam (...)
vocavit) a Filio Dei in unitatem pesonae assumpta: qua similis per omnia
excepto peccato factus est homi^ibus. Zanch.
imported in these words, he was found in fashion as a man. By which you are
not to conceive that he only assumed a body, as an assisting form to appear
transiently to us in it, and so lay it down again. It is not such an apparition
of Christ in the shape of a man, that is here intended: but his true and real
assumption of our nature, which was a special part of his Humiliation: as will
appear by the following particulars.

First, The Incarnation of Christ was a most wonderful humiliation Romans 9.5.
This is the astonishing mystery, 1 Timothy 3.16. that God should be manifest in
the flesh. That the eternal God should truly and properly be called the man
Christ Jesus. 1 Timothy 2.5. It was a wonder to Solomon that God would dwell in
that stately and magnificent Temple at Jerusalem, 2 Chronicles. 6.18. But will God
in very deed, dwell with men on the earth! behold the Heaven, and Heaven of
Heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built? But
it is a far greater wonder, that God should dwell in a body of flesh, and pitch
his Tabernacle with us. Ioh. 1.14. It would have seemed a rude blasphemy, had
not the Scriptures plainly revealed it; to have thought, or spoken of the
eternal God, as born in time. The worlds Creator, as a Creature. The Ancient of
days, as an Infant of days.

The Heathen Chaldeans told the King of Babel, that the dwelling of the Gods is
not with flesh. Dan. 2.11. But now God not only dwells with flesh, but dwells
in flesh. Yea, was made flesh: and dwelt among us.

For the Sun to fall from its Sphere, and be degraded into a wandering Attom.
For an Angel to be turned out of Heaven, and be converted into a silly fly, or
worm, had been no such great abasement; for they were but Creatures before, and
so they should abide still, though in an inferior order or species of
creatures. The distance betwixt the highest, and lowest species of creatures,
is but a finite distance. The Angel and the worm dwell not so far assunder. But
for the infinite glorious Creator of all things, to become a creature, is a
mystery exceeding all humane understanding. The distance betwixt God, and the
highest order of creatures, is an infinite distance. He is said to humble
himself to behold the things that are done in Heaven. What a humiliation then
is it, to behold the things in the lower world! But to be born into it, and
become a man! Great indeed is the mystery of Godliness. Behold (says the
Prophet) Isai. 40.15, 18. The nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are
counted as the small dust of the balance; he takes up the Isles as a very
little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are accounted to
him less than nothing and vanity. If indeed this great and incomprehensible
Majesty will himself stoop to the state and condition of a creature, we may
easily believe that being once a creature, he would expose himself to hunger,
thirst, shame, spetting, death, or any thing, but sin. For that once being man,
he should endure any of these things is not so wonderful, as that he should
become a man. This was the low stoop, a deep abasement indeed.

Secondly, It was a marvelous humiliation to the Son of God, not only to become
a creature, but an inferior creature, a man, and not an Angel. Had he took the
Angelical nature, though it had been a wonderful abasement to him; yet he had
staid (if I may so speak) nearer his own home, and been somewhat liker to a God
than now he appeared, when he dwelt with us. For Angels are the highest, and
most excellent of all created Beings. For their nature, they are pure spirits:
for their wisdom, Intelligencies. For their dignity; they are called
principalities, and powers. For their habitations, they are styled the Heavenly
Host; and for their employment, it is to behold the face of God in Heaven. The
highest pitch, both of our holiness and happiness in the coming world, is
expressed by this, we shall be (...) equal to the Angels. Luke 20.36. As man is
nothing to God, so he is much inferior to the Angels. So much below them, that
he is not able to bear the sight of an Angel, though in an humane shape,
rendering himself as familiarly as may be to him. Judge. 13.22. When the Psalmist
had contemplated the Heavens, and viewed the Celestial bodies; the glorious
Luminaries, the Moon, and Stars which God had made: he cries out Psalm. 8.5.
what is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou visitest
him! Take man at his best, when he came a perfect and pure piece out of his
Makers hand, in the state of innocence; yet he was inferior to Angels. They
always bare the image of God in a more eminent degree, than man, as being
wholly spiritual substances, and so more lively representing God, than man
could do; whose noble soul is immerst in matter, and closed up in flesh and
blood: yet Christ chooses this inferior order, and species of creatures, and
passes by the Angelical nature. Heb. 2.16. He took not on him the nature of
Angels, but the seed of Abraham.

Thirdly, Moreover, Jesus Christ did not only neglect the Angelical, in the
likeness of sinful flesh, (i. e.) in flesh that had the marks, and miserable
effects, and consequents of sin upon it. I say not that Christ assumed sinful
flesh, or flesh really defiled by sin. That which was born of the Virgin was an
holy thing. For by the power of the highest, (whether by way of manufacture, as
some; or the energetical command and ordination of the Holy Ghost, as others;
or by his benediction and blessing, I here dispute not) that whereof the body
of Christ was to be formed, was so sanctified that no taint or spot of original
pollution remained in it. But yet though it had not intrinsecal native
uncleanness in it, it had the effects of sin upon it; yea, it was attended with
the whole troop of humane infirmities, that sin at first let into our common
nature. Such as hunger, thirst, weariness, pain, mortality, and all those
natural weaknesses and evils that clog our miserable natures, and make them
groan from day to day under them.

By reason whereof, though he was not a sinner, yet he looked like one: and
they that saw and conversed with him, took him for a sinner, seeing all these
effects of sin upon him. In these things he came as near to sin, as his
holiness could admit. O what a stoop was this! to be made in the likeness of
flesh, though the innocent flesh of Adam, head been much; but to be made in the
likeness of sinful flesh, the flesh of sinners, rebels; flesh though not
defiled, yet miserably defaced by sin: Oh what is this! and who can declare it!
And indeed, if he will be a Mediator of reconciliation, it was necessary it
should be so. It behoved him of assume the same nature that sinned, to make
satisfaction in it. Yea, these senseless infirmities were necessary to be
assumed with the nature, for as much as his bearing them was a part of his
humiliation, and went to make up satisfaction for us. Moreover, by them our
high priest was qualified from his own experience, and filled with tender
compassion to us.

But oh the admirable condescentions of a Savior, to take such a nature! to
put on such a garment when threadbare and ragged* did this become the Son of
God to wear? Oh grace unsearchable!

Fourthly, And yet more, by this his incarnation he was greatly humbled, in as
much, as this his incarnation so veiled, clouded, and disguised him; that
during the time he lived here, he looked not like himself, a God; but as a poor
sorry, contemptible sinner, in the eyes of the world; they scorned him. This
fellow said, Matthew. 26.61. Hereby he made himself of no reputation, Phil. 2.6.
it blotted his honor and reputation. By reason hereof he lost all esteem and
honor from those that saw him, Matthew. 13.55. is not this the Carpenters Son?
To see a poor man traveling up and down the Country, in hunger, thirst,
weariness, attended with a company of poor men; one of his company bearing the
bag, and that which was put therein. Ioh. 13.29. Who that had seen him, would
ever have thought this had been the Creator of the world; the Prince of the
Kings of the Earth? He was despised, and we esteemed him not. Now which of you
is there that would not rather choose to endure much misery as a man, than to
be degraded into a contemptible worm, that every body treads upon, and no man
regards it? Christ looked so unlike a God in this habit, that he was scarce
allowed the name of a man; a worm rather than a man.

And think with your selves now, was not this astonishing self-denial? that he
who from eternity had his Fathers smiles, and honors; he that from the
creation was adored, and worshipped by Angels, as their God; must now become a
footstool for every Miscreant to tread on; and not to have the respects due to
a man! sure this was a deep abasement. It was a black cloud that for so many
years darkened, and shut up his manifestative glory that it could not shine out
to the world; only some weak rays of the Godhead shone to some few eyes,
through the chinks of his humanity, as the clouded Sun sometimes opens a
little, and casts some faint beams, and is muffled up again. We saw his glory,
as of the only begotten Son, but the world knew him not, Ioh. 1.14. If a Prince
walk up and down in a disguise, he must expect no more honor than a mean
Subject. This was the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, this disguise made him
contemptible, and an object of scorn.

Fifthly, Again, Christ was greatly humbled by his incarnation, in as much as
thereby he was put at a distance from his Father, and that ineffable joy and
pleasure he eternally had with him. Think not Reader, but the Lord Jesus lived
at a high and unimitable rate of communion with God, while he walked here in
flesh; but yet to live by faith as Christ here did, is one thing; and to be in
the bosom of God, as he was before, is another thing. To have the ineffable
delights of God perpetuated and continued to him, without one moments
interruption from eternity, is one thing; and to have his soul sometimes filled
with the joy of the Lord, and then all overcast with clouds of wrath again; to
cry, and God not hear, as he complains, Psalm. 22.2. nay, to be reduced to such
an ebb of spiritual comforts, as to be forced to cry out so bitterly, as he
did, Psalm. 22.1. my God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? This was a thing
Christ was very unacquainted with, till he was found in habit as a man.

Sixthly, and Lastly, It was a great stoop and condescension of Israel,
espoused to a Carpenter: yea, and that too, under all the disadvantages
imaginable. Not in his Mothers house, but an Inn; yea in the stable too. He
suited all to that abased state he was designed for: and came among us under
all the humbling circumstances imaginable. You know the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, (says the Apostle) how that though he was rich, yet, for our sakes he
became poor, 2 Cor. 8.9. And thus I have shown you some few particulars of
Christ's humiliation in his incarnation. Next we shall infer somethings from it,
that are practical.

Inference 1.
Hence we gather the fullness and compleatness of Christ's satisfaction, Infer. 1.
as the sweet first fruits of incarnation. Did man offend and violate the Law
of God? Behold God himself is become a man to repair that breach, and satisfy
for the wrong done. The highest honor that ever the law of God received, was
to have such a person as the man Christ Jesus is, to stand before its Bar, and
make reparation to it. This is more than if it had poured out all our blood,
and built up its honor upon the ruins of the whole creation.

It is not so much to see all the Stars in Heaven overcast, as to see one Sun
eclipsed. The greater Christ was, the greater was his humiliation; and the
greater his humiliation was, the more full and complete was his satisfaction;
and the more compleatness there is in Christ's satisfaction, the more perfect
and steady is the Believers consolation. If he had not stoopt so low, our joy
and comfort could not be exalted so high. The depth of the foundation, is the
strength of the superstructure.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Did Christ for our sakes stoop from the Majesty, glory and dignity he was
possessed of in Heaven, to the mean and contemptible state of a man; what a
pattern of self-denial is here presented to Christians! What objection against,
or excuses to shift off this duty can remain, after such an example as is here
propounded? Brethren, let me tell you, the Pagan world was never acquainted
with such an Argument as this, to press them to self-denial. Did Christ stoop,
and cannot you stoop? Did Christ stoop so much, and cannot you stoop in the
least? Was he content to become any thing, a worm, a reproach, a curse; and
cannot you digest any abasements? Do the least slights and neglects rancle your
hearts, and poison them with discontent, malice and revenge? O how unlike
Christ are you! Hear, and blush in hearing what your Lord says in Joh. 13.14.
Obligat nos ad rat^onem exempli, magis quam ad individuum actum. Chamier. Tom.
3. l. 19. c. 7.
If I then your Lord and Master, wash your feet; ye also ought to wash one
another feet. This example obliges not (as a learned man well observes) to the
same individual act, but it obliges us to follow the reason of the example.
That is, after Christ's example we must be ready to perform the lowest and
meanest Offices of love and service to one another. And indeed to this it
obliges most forcibly, for it is as if a Master seeing a proud sturdy Servant,
that grudges at the work he is employed about, as if it were too mean and base,
should come and take it out of his hand, and when he has done it, should say;
does not your Lord and Master think it beneath him to do it, and is it beneath
you? I remember it is an excellent saying that Bernard has upon the nativity
of Christ. Quid magis indignum, quid detestandum, amplius, quid gravimus
puniendum; quam ut videns Deum parvulum factum homo se magnificet?
Intolerabilis est impudentia, ut ubi sese exiaanivit majestas, vermiculus
infletur; and iatumescat. Bern. Sermon 1. de Nativ.
Says he, what more detestable, what more unworthy, or what deserves severer
punishment, than for a poor man to magnify himself, after he has seen the
great and high God so humbled, as to become a little Child? it is intolerable
impudence for a worm to swell with pride, after it has seen majesty emptying
it self. To see one so infinitely above us, to stoop so far beneath us; Oh how
convincing and shaming should it be* Ah how opposite should pride and stoutness
be to the spirit of a Christian! I am sure nothing is more so to the Spirit of
Christ. Your Savior was lowly, meek, self-denying, and of a most condescending
Spirit. He looked not at his own things, but yours. Phil. 2.4. And does it
become you to be proud, selfish and stout? I remember Ierom in his Epistle to
Pamachius, a godly young nobleman; advises him to be eyes to the blind, feet
to the lame; yea says he, if need be, I would not have you refuse to cut wood,
and draw water for the Saints; and what says he is this, to buffeting, and
spetting, to crowning with thorns, scourging, and dying! Christ did undergo all
this, and that for the ungodly.

Inference 3.
Did Christ stoop so low as to become a man to save us? Infer. 3.
Then those that perish under the Gospel must needs perish without apology.
What would you have Christ do more to save you? Lo, he has laid aside the
robes of Majesty, and glory; put on your own garments of flesh, come down from
his Throne, and brought Salvation home to your own doors. Surely the lower
Christ stooped to save us, the lower shall we sink under wrath, that neglect so
great Salvation. The Lord Jesus is brought low, but the unbeliever will lay him
yet lower, even under his feet: he will tread the Son of God under foot, Heb.
10.28. for such (as the Apostle there speaks) is reserved something worse, than
dying without mercy. What pleas, and excuses others will make at the Judgment
Seat, Vide Morning exercise at Giles in the fields. p. 256.
I know not; but once it is evident, you will be speechless. And as one well
observes, the vilest sinners among the Gentiles; nay, the Devils themselves,
will have more to say for themselves, than you.

I must be plain with you; I beseech you consider, how Jews, Pagans and Devils
will rise up in Judgment against you. The Jew may say, I had a legal yoke upon
me, which neither I, nor my fathers were able to bear. Christ invited me only
into the garden of nuts, where I might sooner break my teeth with the hard
shells of Ceremonies, than get the kernel of Gospel-promises. -- In the best of
our Sacrifices, the smoke filled our Temple: smoke, only to provoke us to weep
for a clearer manifestation. -- We had but the old edition of the Covenant of
grace, in a character very darkly intelligible; you have the last edition, with
a Commentary of our rejection, and the worlds reception, and the spirits
effusion. You had all that heart could wish. -- I perish eternally may the poor
Pagan say, without all possibility of reconciliation; and have only sinned
against the Covenant of works; having never heard of a Gospel Covenant, nor of
reconciliation by a Mediator. O had I heard but one Sermon! had Christ but once
broke in upon my soul, to convince me of my undone condition, and to have shown
a righteousness to me* but woe is me, I never had so much as one offer of
Christ. But so have I, must you say, that refuse the Gospel. I have, or might
have heard thousands of Sermons: I could scarce escape hearing one or other
showing me the danger of my sin, and my necessity of Christ; but
notwithstanding all I heard, I wilfully resolved I would have nothing to do
with him.

I could not endure to hear strictness pressed upon me. It was all the hell I had
upon earth, that I could not sin in quiet.

Nay, may the Devil himself say, it is true, I was ever since my fall
maliciously set against God; but alas, as soon as I had sinned, God kicked me
out of Heaven, and told me he would never have mercy upon me; and though I
lived in the time of all manner of gracious dispensations, I saw Sacrifices
offered, and Christ in the flesh, and the Gospel preached: yet how could all
this choose but enrage me the more, to have God as it were say, look here
Satan, I have provided a remedy for sin, but none for thine. This set me upon
revenge against God, as far as I could reach him; but alas, alas, had God
entered into any Covenant with me at all, had God put me on any terms, though
never so hard, for the obtaining of mercy; had Christ been but once offered to
me: what do you think would I have done? etc.

O poor sinners, your Damnation is Just, if you refuse grace brought home by
Christ himself, to your very doors. The Lord grant, this may not be thy case
who read these lines.

Inference 4.
Moreover, Infer. 4.
here it follows, that none does or can love like Christ. His love to man is
matchiess. The freeness, strength, antiquity, and immutability of it puts a
luster on it beyond all examples. Surely it was a strong love indeed, that made
him lay aside his glory, to be found in fashion as a man; to become any thing,
though never so much below himself for our Salvation. We read of Ionathans love
to David, which passed the love of women. Of Jacobs love to Rachel, who for her
sake endured the heat of summer, and cold of winter. Of David's love to Absalom.
Of the Primitive Christians love to one another, who could die one for another.
But neither had they that to deny that Christ had; nor had he those inducements
from the objects of his love, that they had. His love like himself is wonderful.

Inference 5.
Did the Lord Jesus so deeply abase, Infer. 5.
and humble himself for us, what an engagement has he thereby put on us, to
exalt and honor him, who for our sakes was so abased! Quanto pro me vi ior,
tanto mihi charior. B^rn.
It was a good saying of Bernard, by how much the viler he was made for me, by
so much the dearer shall he be to me. And O that all to whom Christ is dear,
would study to exalt and honor him, these four ways.

First, By frequent and delightful speaking of him, and for him. When Paul had
once mentioned his name, he knows not how to part with it; but repeats it no
less than ten times, in the compass of ten verses, in 1 Cor. 1. It was Lamberts
motto, none but Christ, none but Christ. It Is said of Johannes Molius, that
after his conversion, he was seldom or never observed to mention the name
Jesus, but his eyes would drop: so dear was Christ to him. Mr. Fox never denied
any beggar, that asked an alms in Christ's name, or for Jesus sake. Julius
Palmer when all concluded he was dead, being turned as black as a coal in the
fire; at last moved his scorched lips, and was heard to say, sweet Jesus, and
fell a asleep. Plutarch in vita Tit. Elam.
Plutarch tells us that when Titus Flaminius had freed the poor Graecians from
the bondage with which they had been long ground by their oppressions; and the
Herald was to proclaim in their audience the Articles of peace he had concluded
for them; they so pressed upon him, (not being half of them able to hear) that
he was in great danger to have lost his life in the press; at last, reading
them a second time, when they came to understand distinctly how their case
stood; they so shouted for Joy, crying (...), a Savior, a Savior; that they
made the very heavens ring again with their acclamations; and the very Birds
fell down astonished. And all that night the poor Graecians with instruments of
music, and songs of praise, danced and sang about his Tent; extolling him as a
God that had delivered them. But surely you have more reason to be exalting the
Author of your Salvation, who at a dearer rate has freed you from a more
dreadful bondage. O ye that have escaped the eternal wrath of God, by the
humiliation of the Son of God, extol your great Redeemer, and for ever
celebrate his praises. Secondly, By acting your faith on him, for whatsoever
lies in the promises yet unaccomplished. In this you see the great and most
difficult promise fulfilled, Genesis 3.15. The seed of the woman shall break the
Serpents head. Which contained this mercy of Christ's incarnation for us in it;
I say you see this fulfilled, and seeing that which was most improbable and
difficult is come to pass; even Christ come in the flesh: methinks our unbelief
should be strangled for ever, and all other promises the more easily believed.
It seemed much more improbable, and impossible to reason that God should become
a man, and stoop to the condition of a creature; than being a man, to perform
all that good which his incarnation and death procured. Unbelief usually argues
from one of these two grounds, can God do this? or will God do that? It Is
questioning either his power, or his will: but after this, let it cease for
ever to cavil against either. His power to save should never be questioned by
any, that know what sufferings and infinite burdens he supported in our nature.
And surely his willingness to save, should never be put to a question, by any
that consider how low he was content to stoop for our sakes. Thirdly, By
drawing nigh to God with delight through the vail of Christ's flesh. Heb.
10.19.20. God has made this flesh of Christ a vail betwixt the brightness of
his glory and us* It serves to rebate the insupportable glory, and also to give
admission to it, Decursus and recursus igratiarum.
as the vail did in the Temple. Through this body of flesh which Christ
assumed, are all out-lets of grace from God to us, and through it also must be
all our returns to God again. It Is made the great medium of our communion with
God. Fourthly, By applying your selves to him under all temptations, wants and
troubles of what kind soever; as to one that is tenderly sensible of your case,
and most willing, and ready to relieve you. Oh remember this was one of the
inducements that persuaded and invited him to take your nature, that he might
be furnished abundantly with tender compassion for you, from the sense he
should have of your infirmities, Hand igra^^ malis, miseris succurrere disco.
in his own body. Heb. 2.17. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made
like unto his brethen, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in
things pertaining to God; to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
You know by this argument the Lord pressed the Israelites to be kind to
strangers, for (says he) you know the heart of a stranger. Exodus 23.9. Christ
by being in our natures, knows experimentally what our wants, fears,
temptations and distresses are; and so is able to have compassion. O let your
hearts work upon this admirable condescension of Christ, till they be filled
with it; and your lips say,
Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
Sermon. 19.
The NINETEENTH SERMON. Treats of Christ's Humiliation in his Life.

PHIL. II.VIII. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.


THis Scripture has been once already under consideration: and indeed can be
never enough considered. It holds forth the humbled state of the Lord Jesus,
during the time of his abode on earth. The sum of it was delivered you before,
in this point.

DOCT. That the state of Christ from his Conception, Doct.
to his Resurrection; was a state of deep abasement, and humiliation.
The Humiliation of Christ was proposed to us under the three general heads or
branches, of his Humiliation in his Incarnation, his Humiliation in his life,
and his Humiliation in his death. How he was humbled by Incarnation, has been
opened above, in the eighteenth Sermon. How he was humbled in his life, is the
design of this Sermon: yet expect not that I should give you here an exact
History of the life of Christ. The Scriptures speak but little of the private
part of his life; and it is not my design to dilate upon all the memorable
passages that the Evangelists (those faithful Narrators of the life of Christ)
have preserved for us; but only to observe and improve those more observable
particulars in his life, wherein especially he was humbled: and such are these
that follow.

First, The Lord Jesus was humbled in his very Infancy, by his Israel, he was
to undergo the Ceremonies, and submit to the Ordinances belonging to that
people; and thereby to put an end to them; for so it became him, to fulfill all
Righteouness. Luke 2.21. And when eight days were accomplished for the
Circumcising of the Child, his name was called Jesus. Hereby the Son of God was
greatly humbled, especially in these two respects.

First, In that hereby he obliged himself to keep the whole Law, though he were
the Lawmakers. Ci cumcijus and oblatus fuit Christus, quia subjicubat se legi,
non aeternae soli, and morali; sed etiam Cere^oniali, and cui libet divi^ae.
Ames med. p. 101.
Gal. 5.3. For I testify again; to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
debtor to do the whole Law. The Apostles meaning is, he is a debtor in regard
of duty, because he that thinks himself bound to keep one part of the
Ceremonial Law, does thereby bind himself to keep it all; for where all the
parts are inseparably united, (as they are in the Law of God) we pull all upon
us, by engaging or meddling with any one. And he that is a debtor in duty, to
keep the whole Law, quickly becomes a debtor in regard of penalty, not being
able to keep any part of it. Christ therefore coming as our surety, to pay both
those debts; the debt of duty, and the debt of penalty to the Law; he by his
circumcision obliges himself to pay the whole debt of duty, by fulfilling all
Righteousness; and though his obedience to it was so exact and perfect, that he
contracted no debt of penalty for any transgression of his own: yet he obliges
himself to pay that debt of penalty we had contracted; by suffering all the
pains due to transgressors. This was that intolerable yoke that none were able
to bear but Christ. Acts 15.10. And it was no small abasure of Christ, to bind
himself to the Law as a Subject made under it. For he was the Lawgiver, above
all Law; and herein that Sovereignty of a God, (one of the choice flowers in
the Crown of Heaven) was obscured and veiled, by his subjection.

Secondly, Hereby he was represented to the world, not only as a Subject, but
also as a Sinner. For though he was pure and holy, yet this ordinance passing
upon him, seemed to imply as if corruption had indeed been in him; which must
be cut off by mortification. For this was the mystery principally intended by
circumcision; Ceremoniales isti^s modi observationes, totidem fuerunt peccati
confessiones: Christus igitur qui sactus est peccatum pro nobis, congruenter
etia^ illis factus est confo^mis. Ames. med. p. 101.
It served to mind and admonish Abraham, and his seed, of the natural
guiltiness, uncleanness and corruption of their hearts and natures. So Jer.
4.4. Circumcise your selves unto the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your
hearts, ye men of Judah: (i. e.) the sinfulness and corruption of them. Hence
the rebellious, and unmortified, are called stiff necked, and uncircumcised in
heart, as it is, Acts 7.51. and as it served to convince of natural
uncleanness, so it signified and sealed the putting off the body of the sins of
the flesh, as the Apostle phraseth it. Col. 2.11. Now this being the end of God
in the institution of this ordinance, for Abraham and his ordinary seed; Christ
in his infancy by submitting to it, did not only vail his Sovereignty, by
subjection: but was also represented as a sinner to the world, though most holy
and pure in himself.

Secondly, Christ was humbled by persecution, and that in the very morning of
his life. He was banished almost as soon as born. Matthew. 2.13. Flee into Egypt
(says the Angel to Joseph) and be thou there until I bring thee word, for
Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. Ungrateful Herod, was this
entertainment for a Savior? what, raise the Country against him, as if a
destroyer, rather than a Savior had landed upon the coast? what, deny him the
protection of those Laws under which he was born, and that before he had broken
the least punctilio of them? the child of a beggar may claim the benefit and
protection of Law, as his birthright; and must the Son of God be denied it! But
herein he fulfilled the Scriptures, whilst venting his own lusts. For so it was
foretold, Ier. 31.15. And this early persecution, was not obscurely hinted, in
the title of the 22 Psalm, that psalm which looks rather like an History of the
new, than a prophecy of the old Testament. For as it contains a most exact
description of Christ's sufferings, so it is fitted with a most suitable Title.
To the chief Musician Ai^eleth Shabar; which signifies the Hind of the morning
or that Deer which the Hunter rouzes betime in the morning, and singles out to
hunt down that day. And so they did by him, as the 16. verse will tell you, for
(says he) Dogs have compassed me, the Assemble of the wicked have enclosed me.
O vere ce^vinam Christi carnem, animae fideli long sapidiorem ea, quam (...)
mundi nobiles in deliciis habent. Ac ne quid sapori ac gustui delica^^ de^sset,
non simpliciter ^ccisa est nostra cerva, sed antea been agitata: quemadmodum
solent magnates, venando and (...), a^tequam ca (...) and occidant, car^^m
cervinam, s^aviorem, molliorem ac delicatio rem reddere. Mu^c. in Loc.
Upon which Musculus sweetly and ingeniously descants. O what sweet Venison
(says he) is the flesh of Christ! abundantly sweeter to the believing soul,
than that which the Nobles of this world esteem most delicate. And lest it
should want the highest and richest favor to a delicate palate; Christ our
Heart was not only killed, but hunted to the purpose before he was killed; even
as great men use by hunting and chasing before they cut the throat of the deer,
to render its flesh more sweet, tender, and delicate. Thus was Christ hunted
betimes, out of the Country he was born in. And no doubt but where such dogs
scent and wind the Spirit of Christ in any; they would pursue them also to
destruction, did not a gracious providence rate them off. But to return, how
great an Humiliation is this to the Son of God, not only to become an Infant,
but in his Infancy to be hurried up and down, and driven out of his own land as
a vagabond!

Thirdly, Our Lord Jesus Christ was yet more humbled in his life, by that
poverty and outward meanness which all along attended his condition. He lived
poor and low all his days, so speaks the Apostle 2 Cor. 8.9. Locus hic
manifest ex iis des^m^tus est, atque accommodatus videtur, quae de advent^
M^ssiae etiam tum in (...) circumferebant Iudei: quale est quod Gema^istae
dicunt. Si ve^iat, non fore locum ubi confideat (...). Heni^ius in Loc.
Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor; so poor that he was
never owner of a house to dwell in, but lived all his days in other men's
houses, or lay in the open air. His outward condition was more neglected, and
dest^^ute than that of the birds of the air, or beasts of the earth; so he told
that Scribe, who professed such readiness and resolution to follow him, but was
soon coo^^d when Christ told him, Matthew. 8.20. The Foxes have holes, and the
Birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head.
It was a common saving among the Jews, when the Messiah comes, he will not find
a place to sit down in. Sometimes he feeds upon barley bread, and a broyled
fish; and sometimes he was hungry, and had nothing to eat. (...) co^t^nebat d^^
didrae^hma and va^et 2 s. 6. d.
Mark 11.12. As for moneys, he was much a stranger to it; when the Tribute money
was demanded of him, he and Peter were not so well furnished to make half a
crown betwixt them to pay it, but must work a miracle for it. Matthew. 17. ult.
He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. Matthew. 20.28. Not to amass
earthly treasures, but to bestow Heavenly ones. His great and Heavenly soul
neglected and despised those things, that too many of his own, too much admire
and prosecute. He spent not a careful thought about those things, that eat up
thousands, Pae^pertas Christi suit sine voto singulari, and sine mendici^ate.
Ames. Med. p. 104.
and ten thousands of our thoughts. Indeed he came to be humbled, and to teach
men by his example the vanity of this world; and pour contempt upon the
ensnaring glory of it: and therefore went before us in a chosen and voluntary
poverty. Yet he lived not a mendicant life neither: but was sometimes fed by
ordinary, and sometimes miraculous and extraordinary ways. He had wherewith to
support that precious body of his, till the time was come to offer it up to
God; but would not indulge and pamper that flesh, which he purposely assumed to
be humbled in.

Fourthly, Our Dear Jesus was yet further humbled in his life, by the horrid
temptations wherewith Satan assaulted him; than which nothing could be more
grievous to his holy hear^. The Evangelist gives us an account of this in Luke
4. from the first to the 14. verse. In which context you find, how the bold and
envious spirit meets the Captain of our Salvation in the field; Maxima and
frequ ^tissima te^ta^di occasio illi est, quum reru^ secularium appetentes, and
ef^ie^tes ro^videt. Sicut A^ceps ^ete suum praepa^at b^uma^^ po^issimum
tempore, qua^do non est quod a^es comedant. Stapletonis prompt. p. 4.4.8.
comes up with him in the wilderness, when he was solitary, and had not a
Second with him. verse 1. There he keeps him fasting forty days, and forty
nights, to prepare him to close with his Temptation. All this while Satan was
pointing and edging that Temptation with which at last he resolves to try the
breast of Christ, by an home-thrust. Verse 2. By this time he supposes Christ
was an hungry, (as indeed he was) and now he thought it was time to make his
assault, which he does in a very suitable Temptation at first, and with variety
of Temptations; trying several Weapons upon him afterward. But when he had made
a thrust at him with that first Weapon in which he especially trusted, command
that these stones be made bread, verse 3. and saw how Christ had put it by,
verse 4. Then he changes postures, and assaults him wi^h Temptations to
blasphemy; even to fall down and worship the Devil. But when he saw he could
fasten nothing on him, that he was as pure Fountain water in a Crystal vial,
how much soever agitated, and shaken, no dregs, or filthy sedement would rise,
but he remained pure still: I say, seeing this, he makes a politic retreat,
quits the field for a season, verse 13. yet leaves it cum animo revertendi,
with a resolution to return to him again. And thus was our blessed Lord Jesus
humbled by the Temptations of Satan; and what can you imagine more burdensome to
him, that was brought up from eternity with God, delighting in the holy Father,
Quantum mutatus ab illo?
to be now shut into a wilderness with a Devil, there to be baited so many
days, and have his ears filled though not defiled with horrid blasphemy? Oh
how was the case altered with Christ! from what, to what was he now come? A
chaste woman would account it no common misery to be dogged up and down and
solicited by some vile Russian, though there were no danger of defilement.

A man would account it no small unhappiness to be shut up five or six weeks
together with the Devil; though appearing in an humane shape, and to hear no
language but that of Hell spoken all that time; and the more holy the man is,
the more would he be afflicted to hear such blasphemies malignantly spet upon
the holy and reverent name of God; much more to be solicited by the Devil, to
join with him in it: this I say would be accounted no small misery for a man to
undergo. How great an Humiliation then must it be to the great God, to be
humbled to this! to see a slave of his house, setting upon himself the Lord.
His Jailor coming to take him prisoner, if he can. A base apostate Spirit,
daring to attempt such things as these upon him. Surely this was a deep
abasement to the Son of God.

Fifthly, Our blessed Lord Jesus was yet more humbled in his life sympathy with
others, under all the burdens that made them groan. For he much more than Paul
could say, who is afflicted and I burn not? He lived all his time as it were in
an Hospital, among the sick, and wounded. And so tender was his heart, that
every groan for sin, or under the effects of sin pierced him so, that it was
truly said, himself bare our sicknesses, and took our infirmities. Matthew. 8.16,
17. It was spoken upon the occasion of some poor creatures that were possessed
by the Devil, and brought to him to be dispossessed. It Is said of him, Joh.
11.33. That when he saw Mary weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with
her; he groaned in the Spirit, and was troubled. And verse 35. Jesus wept: yes,
his heart flowed with pity for them that had not one drop of pity for
themselves. Witness his tears spent upon Jerusalem, Luke 19.41, 42. He foresaw
the misery that was coming, though they neither foresaw, nor feared it. O how
it pierced him to think of the calamities hanging over that great City! Yea, he
mourned for them, that could not mourn for their own sins. Therefore it is said,
Mark 3.5. He was grieved for the hardness of the peoples hearts. So that the
commendation of a good Physician, that he does as it were die with every
patient, was most applicable to our tenderhearted Physician. This was one of
those things that made him a man of sorrows, and acquainted with griefs. For
the more holy any is, the more he is grieved and afflicted for the sins of
others; and the more tender any man is, the more he is pierced with beholding
the miseries that lie upon others. And it is sure, never any heart more holy,
or more sensible, tender and compassionate than Christ's.

Sixthly, Lastly, That which yet helped to humble him lower, was the ungrateful
and most base and unworthy entertainment the world gave him. He was not
received or treated like a Savior, but as the vilest of men. One would think
that he who came from Heaven, to give his life a ransom for many. Matthew. 20.28.
He that was not sent to condemn the world, but that the world through him might
be saved. Joh. 3.17. He that came to disolve the works of the Devil, 1 John
3.8. knock off the chains, open the prison doors, proclaim liberty to the
captives. Isai. 61.1. I say, when such a Savior arrived, O with what
acclamations of Joy, and demonstrations of thankfulness should he have been
received? One would have thought they should even kiss the ground he trod upon:
but instead of this, he was hated, Ioh. 15.18. He was despised by them, Matthew.
13.55. So reproached that he became the reproach of men, as who should say, a
corner for every one to spet in. A butt for every base tongue to shoot at.
Psalm. 22.6. Accused of working his miracles by the power of the Devil. Matthew.
12.24. He was trod upon as a worm. Psalm. 22.6. They buffeted him. Matthew. 26.67.
Smote him on the head, Matthew. 27.30. Array^d him as a fool, verse 29. Spet in
his face, verse 30. Despised him as the basest of men, this fellow said, Matthew.
26.61. One of his own followers sold him, another forswear him, and all forsook
him in his greatest troubles. All this was a great abasement to the Son of God,
who was not thus treated for a day, or in one place; but all his days, and in
all places. He endured the contradictions of sinners against himself. In these
particulars I have pointed out to you, something of the humbled life Christ
lived in the world. From all which particulars, some useful inferences will be
noted.

Inference 1.
From the first degree of Christ's Humiliation in submitting to be circumcised,
Infer. 1.
and thereby obliging himself to fulfill the whole Law; it follows That Justice
it self may set both hand and seal, to the acquittances and discharges of
Believers. Christ hereby obliged himself to be the Laws play master, to pay it
its utmost demand. To bear that yoke of obedience that never any before him
could bear. And as his circumcision obliged him to keep the whole Law; so he
was most precise, and punctual in the observation of it. Iustificatio est actus
unu^, indi^iduus, perfectus aequaliter contingens omnibus Woleb.
So exact, that the sharp eye of divine justice cannot epsy the least flaw in
it: But acknowledges full payment, and stands ready to sign the Believer a full
acquittance. Romans 3.25. That God may be just, and the Iustifier of him that
believes in Jesus. Had not Christ been thus obliged, we had never been
discharged. Had not his obedience been an entire, complete and perfect thing;
our justification could not have been so. He that has a precious treasure,
will be loath to adventure in a leaky vessel: woe to the holiest man on earth, if
the safety of his precious soul, were to be adventured in the bottom of the
best duty that ever he performed. But Christ's obedience and righteousness is
ti^e and sound. A bottom that we may safely adventure all in.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
From the early flight of Christ into Egypt, we infer, That the greatest
innocence, and piety, cannot exempt from persecution and in^ury. Who more
innocent than Christ? And who more persecuted? The world is the world still. I
have given them thy word and the world has hated them, Joh. 17.14. The world
lies in wait as a thief, for them that carry this treasure; they who are empty
may sing before him; he never stops them: But persecution follows piety, as the
shadow does the body. 2 Timothy 3.12. All that will live godly in Christ Jesus,
must suffer p^rs^cution. Whosoever resolves to live holily, must never expect
to live quietly. It Is godliness, and godliness in Christ Jesus (i. e.) such as
is derived from Christ, true godliness, and it is true godliness as it is
manifested in practice. All that will live godly, that will exert holiness in
their lives; which convinces and galls the Consciences of the ungodly. It Is
this enrages, for there is an enmity, and antipathy betwixt them: and this
enmity runs in a blood, and it is transmitted with it from generation, to
generation. Gal. 4.29. As then he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him
that was born after the spirit; even so it is now. Mark, so it was, and so
still it is. Cains Club is still carried up and down, Multi adh^c sunt, qui
clavum sanguine Abelis rubentem circumferunt. Bucholtz.
redded with the blood of Abel, says Bucholtzer: but thus it must be, to
conform us unto Christ; and oh that your Spirits, as well as your Conditions
may better harmonize with Christ. He suffered meekly, quietly, and
self-denyingly; be ye like him. Let it not be said of you, as it is of the
Hypocrite, whose lusts are only hid, but not mortified by his duties; that he
is like a flint, which seems cold; but if you strike him, he is all fiery. To
do well, and suffer ill is Christ-like.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
From the third particular of Christ's Humiliation, I infer, that such as are
full of grace and holiness, may be destitute and empty of creature comforts.
What an an overflowing fullness of grace was there in Christ. And yet to what a
low ebb did his outward comforts sometimes fall: and as it fared with him, so
with many others now in glory with him: whilst they were in the way to that
glory. 1 Cor. 4.11. Even to this present hour, we both hunger, and thirst, and
are naked, and buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place. Their souls were
richly clothed with robes of Righteousness, their bodies naked, or meanly
clad. Their souls fed high, even on hidden mannah, their bodies hungry. Let us
be content (said Luther) with our hard fare, for do we not feast with Angels,
upon that bread of life? Remember when wants pinch hard, that these fix no
marks of Gods hatred upon you. He has dealt no worse with you, than he did
with his own Son. Nay, which of you is not better accommodated than Christ was?
if you be hungry, or thirsty, you have some refreshments; you have beds to lie
on; the son of man had not where to lay his head. The heir of all things, had
sometimes nothing to eat. And remember you are going to a plentiful country
where all your wants will be supplied. Poor in the world, rich in faith, and
heirs of the Kingdom, which God has promised. 2 James 5. The meanness of your
present, will add to the luster of your future condition.

Inference 4.
From the fourth particular of Christ's Humiliation in his life, Infer. ^.
by Satan's Temptations, we infer, That those in whom Satan has no interest,
may have most trouble from him in this world. Joh. 14.30. The Prince of this
world comes, and has naught in me. Where he knows he cannot be a Conqueror,
he will not cease to be a Troubler. This bold and daring spirit adventures upon
Christ himself; for doubtless he was filled with envy at the sight of him: and
would do what he could* though to no purpose, to obstruct the blessed design in
his hand* And it was the wisdom and love of Christ to admit him to come as near
him as might be, and try all his darts upon him; that by this experience, he
might be filled with pity to succor them that are temp^ed. And as the set on
Christ, so much more will he adventure upon us; and but too often comes off a
Conqueror. Sometimes he shoots the fiery darts of blasphemous injections. These
fall as flashes of lightning on the dry tha^ch, which instantly sets all in a
combustion. And just so is it attended with an after thunderclap of inward
horror, which shivers the very heart, and strikes all into confusion within.
Diverse rules are prescribed in this case, to relieve poor distressed ones. One
advises to think seriously on that which is darted suddenly, and to do by
your hearts, as men use to do with young horses, that are apt to start and
boggle at every thing in the way; we bring them close to the things they fright
at, make them look on them, and smell to them; that time, and better
acquaintance with such things, may teach them not to start. Others advise to
diversions of the thoughts, as much as may be; to think quite another way.
These rules are contrary to one another, and I think signify but little to the
relief of a poor soul, so distressed.

The best rule doubtless is that of the Apostle, Ephesians. 6.16. Above all taking
the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts
of the wicked. Act your faith my friends, upon your tempted Savior; who passed
through Temptations before you; and particularly exercise faith on three things
in Christ's Temptations.

First, Believingly consider, how great variety of Temptations were tried upon
Christ; and of what an horrid blasphemous nature that was, fall down and
worship me. Secondly, Believingly consider, that Christ came off a perfect
Conqueror in the day of his trial. Beat Satan out of the field. For he saw what
he attempted on Christ was as impossible, as to batter the body of the Sun with
Snow-balls. Thirdly, Lastly believe that the benefits of those his victories,
and conquests are for you; and that for your sakes he permitted the Tempter to
come so near him. As you find Heb. 2.18.
Object.
Heb. 4.15. If you say true, Christ was tempted as well as I: but there is a
vast difference betwixt his Temptations and mine. For the Prince of this world
came and found nothing in him, Ioh. 14.30. He was not internally defiled,
though externally assaulted; but I am defiled by them as well as troubled.

Sol.
This is a different case. True, it is so, and must be so, or else it had
signified nothing to your relief. For had Christ been internally defiled, he
had not been a fit Mediator for you. Nor could you have had any benefit either
by his Temptations or Sufferings for you. But he being Tempted, and yet still
holy, bearing the burden, and still escaping the defilement of sin, has not
only satisfied for the sins you commit, when tempted; but also gotten an
experimental sense of the misery of your condition which is in him, (though now
in glory) as aspiring of pity and tender compassion to you. Remember, poor
Tempted Christian, the God of peace shall shortly tread Satan under thy feet,
Romans 16.20. Thou shall set thy foot on the neck of that enemy. And as soon as
both thy feet are over the threshold of glory, thou shall cast back a smiling
look; and say, now Satan do thy worst. Now I am there, where thou can not
come. Mean while, till thou be out of his reach, let me advise thee to go to
Jesus Christ, and open the matter to him. Tell him how that base spirit falls
upon thee; yea, sets upon thee even in his presence. Entreat him to rebuke and
command him off. Beg him to consider thy case, and say, Lord do not thou
remember how thy own heart was once grieved, though not defiled by his
assaults. I have grief and guilt together upon me. Ah Lord, I expect pity and
help from thee; thou know the heart of a stranger, the heart of a poor
Tempted one. This is singular relief in this case. O try it.

Inference 5.
Was Christ yet more humbled by his own sympathy with others in their
distresses. Infer. 5.
Hence we learn, that a compassionate spirit toward such as labor under
burdens of sin or affliction, is Christ-like, and truly excellent. This was the
spirit of Christ; O be ye like him. Put on as the Elect of God, bowels of
mercy, Col. 3.12. Weep with them that weep, and rejoice with them that do
rejoice, Romans 12.15. It was Cain that said, am I my brothers keeper? In all the
afflictions losses and troubles that befall Believers Christ says half mine.
Yea, he not only bears half but all the burden, and more than all, for he bears
us and our burden too. O that more of his spirit dwelt in his people. Aut
sumus, aut fuimus, aut possimus esse quod his est.
Blessed Paul was of a contrary temper, 2 Cor. 11.29. Who is weak, and I am not
weak? who is offended and I burn not? Three things promote sympathy in
Christians; one is, the Lords pity for them; he does as it were suffer with me;
in all their afflictions he was afflicted. Isai. 63.9. Another is the relation
we sustain to Gods afflicted people. They are members with us in one body, and
the members should have the same care one of another. 1 Cor. 12.25. The last
is, we know not how soon our selves may need from others, what others now need
from us. Restore him with the spirit of meekness, considering thy self, lest

Did the world help on the Humiliation of Christ by their base and vile usage of
him? Learn hence; That the Judgment the world gives of persons and their worth
is little to be regarded. Surely it dispenses its smiles and honors very
praeposterously and unduly. In this respect among others the Saints are styled
such persons of whom the world is not worthy Heb. 11.38. (i. e.) it does not
deserve to have such choice spirits as these are left in it, since it knows not
how to use or treat them. It was the complaint of Salvian above eleven hundred
years ago. If any of the Nobility (says he) do but begin to turn to God,
presently he loses the honor of Nobility; O in how little honor is Christ
among Christian people, when Religion shall make a man ignoble! So that (as he
adds) many are compelled to be evil, lest they should be esteemed vile. And
indeed, if the world give us any help to discover the true worth and excellency
of men by, Siquis ex nobilitate converti ad Deum cap^rit, statim honorem
nobilitatis amittit, o quantus in Christiano populo honor Christi est, ubi
religio ignobilem facit! Salv. Lib. 4. de ^ub. Dei. Superbus fio quod video

it is by the rule of contraries, for the most part Where it fixes its marks of
hatred, we may usually find that which invites our respect and Love. It should
trouble us the less to be under the slights and disrespects of a blind world. I
could be even proud upon it, (said Luther) that I see I have an ill name from
the world. And Jerome blessed God that counted him worthy to be hated of the
world. Labor to stand right in the Judgment of God, and trouble not thy self
for the rash and headlong censures of men. Let wicked men said one cut the
throat of my credit, and do as they like best with it; when the wind of their
calumnies has blown away my good name from me in the way to Heaven, I know
Christ will take my name out of the mire, and wash it, and restore it to me
again.

From the whole of Christ's Humiliation in his life, learn you to pass through
all the troubles of your life with a contented composed spirit as Christ your
forerunner did. He was persecuted, and bare it meekly. Poor, and never
murmured. Tempted, and never yielded to the Temptation. Reviled, and Reviled
not again. When ye therefore pass through any of these trials, look to Jesus,
and consider him. See how he that passed through those things before you,
managed himself in like circumstances; yea, not only beat the way by his
pattern and example for you, but has in every one of those conditions left a
blessing behind him for them that follow in his steps.

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The TWENTIETH SERMON. Sermon. 20.
Opens Christ's Humiliation unto Death, in his first preparative act for it.

JOH. XVII.XI. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world;
and I come to thee: holy Father, keep through thine own name, those whom thou
have given me; that they may be one, as we are.


WE now come to the Last and Lowest step of Christ's Humiliation, which was in
his submitting to Death, even the Death of the Cross. Out of this death of
Christ the life of our souls springs up, and in this blood of the Cross, all
our mercies swim to us. The blood of Christ runs deep to some eyes. The
Judicious Believer sees multitudes, multitudes of inestimable blessings in it.
By this Crimson Fountain I resolve to sit down; and concerning the death of
Christ, I shall take distinctly into consideration the preparations made for
it, the nature and quality of it. The Deportment and carriage of dying-Jesus.
The Funeral-solemnities with which he was buried. And lastly the blessed
designs, and glorious ends of his death.

The preparatives for his death were six. Three on his own part, and three more
by his enemies. The preparations made by himself for it, were the solemn
recommendation of his friends to his Father. The institution of a commemorative
sign, to perpetuate and refresh the memory of his death in the hearts of his
people till he come again. And his pouring out his soul to God by prayer in the
garden, which was the posture he chose to be found in, when they should
apprehend him.

This Scripture contains the first preparative of Christ for death, whereby he
sets his house in order, prays for his people, and blesses them before he dies.
The love of Christ was ever tender and strong to his people, but the greatest
manifestations of it were at parting. And this he manifested two ways
especially; viz. in leaving singular supports, and grounds of comfort with them
in his last heavenly Sermon, in Chap. 14.15, 16. and in pouring out his soul
most affectionately to the Father for them in this Heavenly Prayer, Chap. 17.
In this Prayer he gives them a Specimen or Sample of that his glorious
intercession-work, which he was just then going to perform in Heaven for them.
Here his heart overflowed, for he was now leaving them, and going to the
Father; the last words of a dying man are remarkable, how much more of a dying
Savior? I shall not lanch out into that blessed Ocean of precious matter
contained in this Chapter, but take immediately into consideration, the words
that I have read, wherein I find a weighty petition, strongly followed and set
home with many mighty Arguments.

First, We have here Christ's petition, or request in behalf of his mercy, and
the means of attaining it. The mercy is to be kept. Keeping implies danger. And
there is a double danger obviated in this request; danger in respect of sin,
and danger in respect of ruin and destruction. To both these the people of God
lie open in this world.

The means of their preservation from both is the name, (i. e.) the power of
God. This name of the Lord is that strange Tower to which the Righteous fly,
and are safe. Prove. 18.10. Alas, it is not your own strength or wisdom that
keeps you, but ye are kept by the mighty power of God. This protecting power of
God, does not however exclude our care and diligence, but implies it; therefore
he adds, ye are kept by the mighty power of God, through faith to Salvation, 1
Pet. 1.5. God keeps his people, and yet they are to keep themselves in the Love
of God, Jude 21, to keep their hearts with all diligence. Prove. 4.23. This is
the sum of the petition.

Secondly, The Arguments with which he urges and presses on this request, are
drawn partly from his own condition, I am no more in the world, (i. e.) I am
going to die; within very few hours I shall be separated from them, in regard
of my corporal presence. Partly, from their condition; but these are in the
world. (i. e.) I must leave them in the midst of danger; and partly from the
joint interest that his Father and himself had in them. Keep those that thou
have given me. With several other most prevalent pleas which in their proper
places shall be anon produced, and displaied to illustrate and confirm this
precious truth, which this Scripture affords us.

DOCT. That the Fatherly care, Doct.
and tender love of our Lord Jesus Christ, was eminently discovered in that
pleading prayer, he poured out for his people, at his parting with them.
It pertained to the Priest, and Father of the family to bless the rest,
especially when they were to be separated from them by death. This was a rite
in Israel. When good Jacob was grown old, and the time was come that he should
be gathered to his Fathers, then he blessed Joseph, Ephraim, and Manasseth,
saying, God before whom my Fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which
fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from all
evil bless the Lads, Genesis 48.15, 16. this was Volc^at Jacob benedice^e filiis
benedictione non vul^ari, sed propheti^a; and pat^iarchali. Nov^rat se tantum
v^rba posse profer^t, eff^ctu^ autem ab a^io pendere. Petit ergo be^ediction^m
ab eo cujus idem est di^ere, and face^e (b. c.) a solo Deo. Aynsworth in Loc.
Benedicere est vel pot stalis (i. e.) bona temporalia solo nutu confer^e, vel
authoritatis. Hoc est bona temporalia vel ae^ria ^x officio pre^ari d^nunciare,
c^nfer^nda (...) Deo Pa^^u^.
a prophetical and patriarchical blessing. Not that Jacob could bless as God
blesses; he could speak the words of blessing, but he knew the effect, the real
blessing it self, depended upon God. And though he blessed authoritatively, yet
not potestatively, (i. e.) he could as the mouth of God pronounce blessings,
but could not confer them. Thus he blessed his Children, as his Father Isaac
has also blessed him before he died, Genesis 28.3. and all these blessings were
delivered prayerwise.

Now when Jesus Christ comes to die, he will bless his Children also. And
therein will discover how much dear and tender love he had for them: having
loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end, Joh. 13.1. the
last Act of Christ in this world, was an act of blessing. Luke 24.50, 51.

To prepare this point for use, I will here open. First, The mercies which
Christ requested of the Father for them. Secondly, The Arguments used by him to
obtain these mercies. Thirdly, Why he thus pleaded for them when he was to die.
Fourthly, and Lastly, How all this gives full evidence of Christ's tender care
and love to his people.

First, We will enquire what those mercies and special favors

First, The mercy of preservation both from sin and danger: so in the text;
Keep through thine own name those whom thou have given me: which is explained,
verse. 15. I pray not that thou should take them out of the world, but that
thou should keep them from the evil. We in ours, and the Saints that are
gone, in their respective generations have reaped the fruit of this prayer. How
else comes it to pass, that our souls are persecuted amidst such a world of
Temptations; and these assisted and advantaged by our own corruptions? How is
it else, that our persons are not ruined, and destroyed amidst such multitudes
of potent, and malicious enemies that are set on fire of Hell? Surely the
preservation of the burning bush, of the three children amidst the flames, of
Daniel in the den of Lions, are not greater wonders, than these our eyes do
daily behold. As the fire would have certainly consumed, and the Lions without
doubt have rended and devoured, had not God by the interposition of his own
hand stopped and hindered the effect; so would the sin that is in us, and the
malice that is in others, quickly ruin our souls and bodies; were it not that
the same hand gard^ and keeps us every moment. To that hand into which this
prayer of Christ delivered your souls and bodies, do you owe all your mercies,
and Salvations, both Temporal and Spiritual.

Secondly, Another mercy he prays for, is the blessing of union among
themselves. This he joins immediately with the first mercy of preservation, and
prays for it, in the same breath, verse. 11. that they may be one, as we are.
And well might he join them together in one breath, for this union is not only
a choice mercy in it self, but a special means of that preservation he had
prayed for before. Their union one with another, is a special means to preserve
them all.

Thirdly, A third desirable mercy that Christ earnestly prayed for, was that
his joy might be fulfilled in them, verse. 13. He would provide for their joy,
even when the hour of his greatest sorrow was at hand. Yea, he would not only
obtain joy for them, but a full joy: that my joy may be fulfilled in them. It
is as if he had said, O my Father, I am to leave these dear ones in a world of
troubles and perplexities. I know their hearts will be subject to frequent
despondencies. O let me obtain the cordials of divine joy for them, before I
go. I would not only have them live, but live joyfully. Provide for their
fainting hours, reviving cordials.

Fourthly, And as a continued spring to maintain all the forementioned mercies:
He prays they all may be sanctified through the word of truth, verse. 17. (i.
e.) more abundantly sanctified than yet they were, by a deeper radication of
gracious habits, and principles in their hearts. This is a singular mercy in it
self, to have holiness spreading it self over and through their s^uls, as the
light of the morning. Nothing is for it self more desirable. And it is also a
singular help to their perseverance, union, and spiritual joy, which he had
prayed for before; and are all advanced by their increasing Sanctification.

Fifthly, Lastly, As the complement and perfection of all desirable mercies,
he prays that they may be with him, where he is to behold his glory, verse. 24.
This is their best and ultimate privilege they are capable of. The end of his
coming down from Heaven, and returning thither again. All runs into this to
bring many Sons and daughters unto glory. You see Christ asks no trifles, no
small things for his people. No mercies, but the best that both worlds afford
will suffice him on their behalf.

Secondly, Let us see how he follows his requests, and with what

First Argument is drawn from the joint interest that both himself, and Father,
have in the persons for whom he prays. All mine are thine, and thine are mine.
verse. 10. As if he should say, Father, behold and consider the persons I pray
for, they are not aliens, but children; yea, they are thy children, as well as
mine. The very same on whom thou have set thy eternal love, and in that love
have given them unto me. So that they are both thine, and mine. Great is our
interest in them, and interest draws care, and tenderness. Every one cares for
his own, provides for, and secures his own. Propriety (even amongst creatures)
is fundamental to our labor, care and watchfulness. They would not so much
prize life, health, estates, or children, if they were not their own. Lord
these are thine own, by many ties, and titles: O therefore keep, comfort,
sanctify and save them, for they are thine. What a mighty plea is this? Surely
Christians, your Intercessor is skilful in his work, your Advocate wants no
eloquence, or ability to plead for you.

The Second Argument, and that a powerful one, treads as I may say upon the
very heel of the former, in the next words: And I am glorified in them. q. d.
My glory and honor is infinitely dear to thee, I know thy heart is set
intently upon the exalting, and glorifying of thy Son; now what glory have I in
the world, but what comes from my people? Others neither can, nor will glorify
me. Nay, I am daily blasphemed, and dishonored by them. These are they from
whom my active glory and praise in the world must rise. It Is true, both thou
and I have glory from other creatures objectively, the works that we have made,
and impressed our power, wisdom and goodness upon, do so glorifies us. And honor
we have from our very enemies, accidentally. Their very wrath shall praise us:
but for active and voluntary praise, whence comes this but from the people that
were formed for that very purpose. Should these then miscarry and perish where
shall my manifestive, and active glory be? And from whom shall I expect it? So
that here his propriety, and glory are pleaded with the Father to prevail for
those mercies, and they are both great and valuable things with God. What
dearer, what nearer to the heart of God?

A Third Argument. And yet to make all fast and sure he adds in the beginning
of this, verse. 11. a third Argument in these words, And now I am no more in the
world. Where we must consider the sense of it as a proposition, and the force
of it is an argument. This proposition I am no more in the world, is not to be
taken simply and universally as if in no sense Christ should be any more in
this world; but only respectively as to his corporal presence, this was in a
little time to be removed from his people, which had been a sweet spring of
comfort to them in all their troubles. But now it might have been said to the
pensive disciples, as the sons of the Prophets said to Elisha a little before
Eliahs translation; know ye not that your Master shall be taken from your heads
to day? This comfortable enjoyment must be taken from them: this is the sense.
And here lies the Argument; Father, consider the sadness and trouble I shall
leave my poor Children under. Whilst I was with them, it was a sweet relief to
their souls, whatever troubles they met with. In all doubts, fears and dangers,
they could repair to me. In all their straights and wants I still supplied
them. They had my counsels to direct them, my reproofs to reduce them, my
comfort to support them; yea, the very sight of me was an unspeakable joy and
refreshment to their souls: but now the hour is come, and I must be gone. All
the comfort and benefit they had from my presence among them is now cut off.
And except thou do make up all this to them another way; what will become of
these children, when their Father is gone? What will be the case of the poor
Sheep, and tender Lambs, when the Shepherd is smitten? Therefore (O my Father)
look thou after them. See to them, for they are thine, as well as mine, I am
glorified in them, and now leaving them, and removing out of this world from
them.

A Fourth Argument. And yet to move and engage the Fathers care and love for
them, he subjoins another great consideration in the very next words, drawn
from the danger he leaves them in. But these are in the world. The world is a
sinful, infecting, and unquiet place: it lies in wickedness, and a hard thing
it will be for such poor, weak, imperfect creatures to escape the pollutions of
it. Or if they do, yet the troubles, persecutions, and strong oppositions of it
they cannot escape. Seeing therefore I must leave thine own dear children as
well as mine, and those from whom my glory is to rise; in the midst of a
sinful, troublesome, dangerous world, where they can neither move backward nor
forward without danger of sin, or ruin: O since the case stands so, look after
them, provide for them, and take special care for them all. Consider who they
are, and where I leave them. They are thy children, to be left in a strange
Country. Thy Soldiers, in the Enemies quarters. Thy Sheep, in the midst of
Wolves. Thy precious Treasure among Thieves.

A Fifth Argument. And yet he has not done, for he resolves to tug for the
mercies he had asked, and will not come off with a denial; and therefore adds
another Argument in the next words; And I come to thee. As his leaving them was
an Argument, so his coming to the Father is a mighty Argument also. There is
much in these words I come to thee [I,] thy beloved Son, in whom thy soul
delights. I to whom thou never deniedst any any thing. It Is not a stranger,
but a Son: not an adopted, but the only begotten Son. It Is I that [ come.] I am
now coming to thee apace my Father. I come to thee, swiming through a bloody
Ocean. I come treading every step of my way to thee in blood, and unspeakable
sufferings; and all this for the sake of those dear ones I now pray for. Yea,
the design and end of my coming to thee, is for them. I am coming to Heaven in
the capacity of an Advocate, to plead with thee for them. And I come to [thee]
my Father, and their Father; my God and their God. Now then, since I that am so
dear, come through such bitter pangs, to thee so dear, so tender hearted a
Father; and all this on their score and account: Since I do but now as it were
begin, or give them a little taste of that intercession-work which I shall live
for ever to perform for them in Heaven: Father hear, Father grant what I
request. O give a comfortable handsel of those good things, which I am coming
to thee for, and which I know thou will not deny me.

The Sixth Argument. And to close up all, he tells the Father, how careful he
had been to observe, and perform that trust which was committed to him. Whilst
I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name: those that thou gave
me, I have kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, ver. 12.

And thus lies the Argument: Thou committest to me a certain number of elect
souls, to be redeemed by me; I undertook the trust, and said, if any of these
be lost; at my hand let them be required. I will answer them every one to thee.
In pursuance of which trust, I am now here on the earth, in a body of flesh. I
have been faithful to a point. I have redeemed them (for he speaks of that as
finished and done, which was now ready to be done) I have kept also, and
confirmed them hitherto: and now Father I commit them to thy care. Lo here they
are, not one is lost, but the son of perdition, who was never given. With how
great care, have I been careful for them! O let them not fail now. Let not one
of them perish.

Thus you see what a nervous, argumentative, pleading prayer Christ poured out
to the Father for them at parting.



And certainly it was not because the Father was unwilling to grant the mercies
he desired for them. No, they came not off with difficulty, nor were they
wrested by mere importunity out of the hand of an unwilling and backward
person. For he tells us in Joh. 16.27. the Father himself loves you; (i. e.)
he is propense enough of his own accord, to do you good. But the reasons of
this exceeding importunity are, First, He foresaw a great trial then at hand;
yea, and all the after trials of his people as well as that. He knew how much
they would be sifted, and put to it in that hour, and power of darkness that
was coming. He knew their faith would be shaken, and greatly staggered, by the
approaching difficulties, when they should see their Shepherd smitten, and
themselves scattered. The Son of man delivered into the hands of Sinners, and
the Lord of Life hang dead upon the tree; yea sealed up in the grave. He
foresaw what straights his poor people would fall into, betwixt a busy Devil,
and a bad heart: therefore he prays, and pleads with such importunity, and
ardency for them that they might not miscarry. Secondly, He was now entering
upon his intercession-work in Heaven, and he was desirous in this prayer to
give us a Specimen, or sample of that part of his work before he left us; that
by this we might understand what he would do for us, when he should be out of
our sight. For this being his last on earth, it shows us what affections, and
dispositions he carried hence with him* and satisfies us that he who was so
earnest with God on our behalf, such a mighty pleader here, will not forget us,
or neglect our concerns in the other world. Yet Reader, I would have the
always to remember, that the intercession of Christ in Heaven is carried at a
much higher rate than this. It Is performed in a way more suitable to that state
of honor to which he is now exalted. Here he used prostrations of Body, cries,
and tears in his prayers. There it is carried in a more majestic, and with more
state, becoming an exalted Jesus. But yet in this he has left us a special
assistance, to discover much of the frame, temper, and working of his heart now
in Heaven toward us. Thirdly, and Lastly, He would leave this as a standing
monument of his Father-like care and love to his people to the end of the
world. And for this it is conceived: Christ delivered this prayer so publicly
not withdrawing from the Disciples to be private with God, as he did in the
Garden; but he delivers it in their presence, these things I speak in the
world: Verse. 13.
this (...) with the ^ircumstance of place [in the world] does plainly speak it
to be a public prayer. And not only was it publicly delivered, but it was
also by a singular providence recorded at large by John, though omitted by the
other Evangelists: that so it might stand to all generations, for a testimony
of Christ's tender care and Love to his people. Fourthly, If you ask how this
gives evidence of Christ's tender First, His Love and care manifest in the
choice of mercies for them. He does not pray for health, honor, long life,
riches, etc. but for their preservation from sin, spiritual joy in God,
sanctification and eternal glory. No mercies but the very best in Gods treasure
will content him. He was resolved to get all the best mercies for his people,
the rest he is content should be dispensed promiscuously by providence. But
these he will settle as an heritage upon his children. O see the Love of
Christ; Look over all your spiritual inheritance in Christ, compare it with the
richest, fairest, sweetest inheritance on earth; and see what poor things these
are to yours. O the care of a dear Father! O the love of a Savior! Secondly,
Besides what an evidence of his tenderness to you, and great care for you was
this, that he should so intently, and so affectionately mind, and plead your
concerns with God, at such a time as this was; even when a world of sorrow was
heming him in on every side. A cup of wrath mixed, and ready to be delivered
into his hand. At that very time, when the clouds of wrath grew black, a storm
coming, and such as he never felt before: when one would have thought, all his
care, thoughts, and diligence should have been employed on his own account, to
mind his own sufferings; no, he does as it were forget his own sorrows, to mind
our peace and comfort. O Love unspeakable!



Corollary 1.
Cor. 1.
If this be so, that Christ so eminently discovered his care and love for his
people in this parting hour. Then hence we conclude, the perseverance of the
Saints is unquestionable. By this, that observation is crossed; nemo diu tutus,
periculo proximus. None can be long safe that dwells near to danger. For hereby
they are safe in the midst of danger.
Do you hear how he pleads, how he begs, how he fills his mouth with arguments,
how he chooses his words, and sets them in order, how he winds up his Spirit
to the very highest pin of zeal and fervency? and can you doubt of success? can
such a Father deny the importunity, and strong reasonings and pleadings of such
a Son! O it can never be. He cannot deny him. Christ has the art and skill of
prevailing with God. He has (as in this appears) the tongue of the Learned. If
the heart or hand of God were hard to be opened, yet this would open them; but
when the Father himself loves us, and is inclined to do us good: who can doubt
of Christ's success? Quicquid est in mo^u, facile movetur.
that which is in motion, is the more easily moved. The cause Christ manageth
in Heaven for us, is Just, and Righteous. The manner in which he pleads, is
powerful; and therefore the success of his suit is unquestionable.

The Apostle professes, 2 Cor. 1.3. we can do nothing against the truth. Illud
possumus, quod jure possumus.
He means it in regard of the bent of his heart, he could not move against
truth and Righteousness. And if a holy man cannot, much less will a holy God.
If Christ undertake to plead the cause of his people with the Father, and use
his oratory with him; there is no doubt but he carries it. Every word in this
prayer is a chosen shaft, drawn to the head, by a strong and skilful hand: you
need not question but it goes home to the white, and hits the mark aimed at.
Does he pray, Father keep through thine own name, those thou have given me?
Sure they shall be kept, if all the power in Heaven can keep them. O think on
this, when dangers surround your souls or bodies. When fears and doubts are
multiplied within. When thou art ready to say in thy have, all men are liers, I
shall one day perish by the hand of sin, or Satan. Think on that encouragement
Christ gave to Peter, Luke 22.31. I have prayed for thee.

Corollary. 2.
Again hence we learn, Cor. 2.
that Argumentative prayers are excellent prayers. The strength of every thing
is in its joints. There lies much of the strength of prayer also. How strongly
jointed, how nervous, and argumentative was this prayer of Christ? Some there
are indeed that think we need not argue and plead in prayer with God, but only
present the matter of our prayers to him, and let Christ alone (whose office it
is) to plead with the Father. As if Christ did not present our pleas and
arguments, as well as simple desires to God. As if the choicest part of our
prayers must be kept back, because Christ presents our prayers to God. No, no,
Christ's pleading is one thing, ours another. Subordinata ^on pugnant.
His and ours are not opposed, but subordinated. His pleading does not destroy,
but makes ours successful. God calls us to plead with him, Mr. Cobbet of prayer.
Isai. 1.18. come now, let us reason together. God (as one observes) reasons
with us by his word and providence outwardly, and by the motions of his Spirit
inwardly: but we reason with him by framing (through the help of his Spirit,)
certain holy arguments, grounded upon allowed principles, drawn from his
nature, name, word or works. And it is condemned as a very sinful defect in
Professors, that they did not plead the Churches cause with God. Hos. 12.4. Gen
32.24.
Jer. 30.13. There is none to plead thy cause, that thou may be bound up.
What was Jacobs wrestling with the Angel, but his holy pleading, and
importunity with God? And how well it pleased God, let the event speak. Dr. Har
is in his Sermon. on Luke 18.6, 7, 8.
As a Prince he prevailed, and had power with God. On which instance a Worthy
thus glosseth. Let God frown, smite or wound, Jacob is at a point, a blessing
he came for, and a blessing he will have; I will not let thee go (says he)
unless thou bless me. His limbs, his life might go; but there is no going for
Christ without a pawn, without a blessing. This is the man, now what is his
speed? the Lord admires him, and honors him to all generations. What is thy
name says he? q. d. I never met with such a man, titles of honor are not
worthy of thee. Thou shall be called, not Jacob a shepherd with men, but Jacob
a Prince with God. Nazianzen said of his sister Gorgonia, that she was modestly
impudent with God. There was no putting her off with a denial. The Lord on this
account has honored his Saints with the title of his Recorders, men fit to
plead with him, as that word [ mazkir] signifies. (...) Rememorantes vel. Qui
reminisci facilis Domini. Mont.
Isai. 62.6. Ye that make mention of the Lord keep not silence, give him no
rest; it notes the office of him that recorded all the memorable matters of the
King, and used to suggest seasonable Items, and Memorandums of things to be
done.

By these holy pleadings the King is held in his Galleries: as it is Cant. 7.5.
I know we are not heard either for our much speaking, or our excellent
speaking; it is Christ's pleading in Heaven, that makes our pleading on earth
available: but yet surely when the spirit of the Lord shall suggest proper
arguments in prayer, and help the humble suppliant, to press them home
believingly and affectionately: Plus gemitibus, quam Sermonibus; plus fletu,
quam affatu; cor clamat ad Dominum. Aug.
when he helps us to weep and plead, to groan and plead; God is greatly
delighted in such prayers. Thou said I will surely do the good. Said Jacob
Genesis 32.12. It Is thine own free promise. I did not go on mine own head, but
thou bidst me go, and encouragest me with this promise. O this is taking with
God. When by the spirit of Adoption we can come to God, crying, Mr. R.A. vindic.
Abba, Father. Father hear, forgive, pity and help me: am I not thy Child? thy
Son, or Daughter? to whom may a Child be bold to go, with whom may a Child have
hope to speed, if not with his Father? Father hear me. The Fathers of our flesh
are full of bowels, and pity their children, and know how to give good things
to them, when they ask them: when they ask bread, or clothes, will they deny
them? And is not the Father of Spirits more full of bowels, more full of pity?
Father hear me. This is that kind of prayer which is melody in the ears of God.

Corollary. 3.
Cor. 3.
What an excellent pattern is here, for all that have the charge and government
of others committed to them; whether Magistrates, Ministers, or Parents: to
teach them how to acquit themselves toward their relations, when they come to
die.

Look upon dying Jesus, see how his care and love to his people flamed out when
the time of his departure was at hand. Surely as we are bound to remember our
Relations every day, and to lay up a stock of prayers for them in the time of
our health; so it becomes us to imitate Christ in our earnestness with God for
them, when we die. Though we die, our prayers die not with us They outlive us,
and those we leave behind us in the world, may reap the benefit of them, when
we are turned to dust.

For my own part I must profess before the world that I have a high value for
this mercy. Mr. Richard Flavell, a faithful and laborious Preacher of the
Gospel at Haseler in Warwick shire; and afterward at Willersay in Gloucester
shire: now with God.
And do from the bottom of my heart bless the Lord, who gave me a Religious and
tender Father: who often poured out his soul to God for me. He was one that was
inwardly acquainted with God, and being full of bowels to his children, often
carried them before the Lord: prayed and pleaded with God for them: wept and
made supplication for them. This stock of prayers and blessings left by him
before the Lord, I cannot but esteem above the fairest inheritance on earth. O
it is no small mercy to have thousands of fervent prayers lying before the
Lord, filed up in Heaven for us. And oh that we would all be faithful to this
duty. Surely our love, especially to the souls of our Relations, should not
grow cold, when our breath does. O that we would remember this duty in our
lives, and if God give opportunity and ability, fully discharge it when we die:
considering as Christ did, we shall be no more but they are in this world. In
the midst of a defiled, tempting troublesome world. It Is the last office of Love
that ever we shall do for them. After a little while we shall be no longer
sensible how it is with them. (for as the Church speaks, Isai. 63.16. Abraham
is ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledges us not) what Temptations, and
troubles may befall them we do not know. O imitate Christ your pattern.

Corollary 4.
To Conclude, Cor. 4.
Hence ye may see what an high esteem and precious value Christ has of
Believers; this was the treasure which he could not be quiet, he could not die,
till he had secured it in a safe hand. I come unto thee, holy Father, keep
through thine own name those whom thou have given me.

Surely, Believers are dear to Jesus Christ. And good reason, for he has paid
dear for them. Let his dying language, this last farewell speak for him, how he
prized them. The Lords portion is his people, Jacob is the Lot of his
inheritance. Deuteronomy. 32.9. They are a peculiar treasure to him above all the
people of the earth. Exodus 19.5. What is much upon our hearts when we die, is
dear to us indeed. O how precious, how dear should Jesus Christ be to us! were
we first and last upon his heart? did he mind us, did he pray for us, did he so
wrestle with God about us when the sorrows of death compassed him about? how
much are we engaged not only to love him, and esteem him whilst we live; but to
be in pangs of love for him, when we feel the pangs of death upon us! To be
eyeing him, when our eye-strings break. To have hot affections for Christ, when
our hands and feet grow cold. The very last whisper of our departing soul
should be this,

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
The TWENTY FIRST Sermon. 21.
SERMON. Opens the second preparative act of Christ for his own death.

I COR. XI.XXIII, XXIV, XXV. -- The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it; and said, take
eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
After the same manner also he took the Cup, when he had supped, saying, this
Cup is the New Testament in my blood, this do, as often as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me.


CHrist had no sooner recommended his dear charge to the Father, but (the time
of his death hasting on) he institutes his last Supper to be the lasting
memorial of his death in all the Churches, until the second coming: therein
graciously providing for the comfort of his people, when he should be removed
out of their sight. And this was the second preparative act of Christ in order
to his death: he will set his house in order, and then die.

This his second Act, manifests no less love than the former. It Is like the
plucking off the ring from his finger, when ready to lay his neck upon the
block, and delivering it to his dearest friends, to keep that as a memorial of
him. Take this, etc. in remembrance of me.

In the words read, are four things noted by the Apostle, about this Last and
Lovely Act of Christ. viz. the Author, time, institution, and end of this holy
and solemn ordinance.

First, The Author of it: The Lord Jesus, it is an effect of his Lordly power,
Authoritas p^aecipientis, est ratio praecepti.
and royal authority. Matthew. 28.18. And Jesus came and spoke unto them saying,
all power is given unto me in Heaven and earth; go ye therefore. The government
is upon his shoulder. Isai. 9.6. He shall bear the glory. Zech. 6.13. Who but
he that came out of the bosom of the Father, and is acquainted with all the
counsels that are there, knows what will be acceptable to God? And who but he
can give creatures by his blessing, their Sacramental efficacy and virtue.
Bread and Wine are naturally fit to refresh, and nourish our bodies; but what
fitness have they to nourish souls? Surely, none but what they receive from the
blessing of Christ that institutes them.

Secondly, The time when the Lord Jesus appointed this ordinance. In the same
night in which he was betrayed. It could not be sooner, because the passover
must first be celebrated; nor later, for that night he was apprehended. It is
therefore emphatically expressed (...), in that same night, that night for ever
to be remembered. He gives that night a cordial draught to his Disciples, before
the conflict. He settles that night an Ordinance in the Church, for the
confirmation and consolation of his people, in all generations to the end of
the world. By instituting in that night, he gives abundant evidence of his care
for his people, in spending so much of that little, very little time he had
left, on their account.

Thirdly, The Institution it self, in which we have, the memorative,
significative, instructive signs, and they are Bread and Wine. And the glorious
mysteries represented, and shadowed forth by them, viz. Jesus Christ crucified;
the proper New Testament nourishment of Believers. Bread and Wine are choice
creatures; and do excellently shadow forth the flesh and blood of crucified
Jesus: And that both in their natural usefulness, and manner of preparation.
Their usefulness is very great; Bread is a creature necessary to uphold and
maintain our natural life. Therefore it is called the staff of bread, Isai. 3.1.
Because as as a feeble man depends and leans upon his staff, so does our feeble
spirits upon bread. Wine was made to cheer the heart of man, Judge. 9.13. They
are both useful and excellent creatures. Their preparations to become so useful
to us, is also remarkable. The Corn must be ground in the Mill: the Grapes torn
and squeesed to pieces in the Wine-prefs, before we can either have Bread or
Wine. And when all this is done, they must be received into the body, or they
nourish not. So that these were very fit creatures, to be set apart for this
use and end.

If any object, it is true, they are good creatures, but not precious enough to
be the signs of such profound, and glorious Mysteries. It was worth the
creating of a new creature, to be the sign of the new Covenant.

Let him that thus objects, ask himself, whether nothing be precious without
pomp? The pretiousness of these Elements, is not so much from their own
natures, as their use and end; and that makes them precious indeed. A Loadstone
at Sea, is much more excellent than a Diamond, because more useful. A peniworth
of wax applied to the Label of a Deed, and sealed, may in a minute have its
value raised to thousands of pounds. These creatures receive their value, and
estimation on alike account. Nor should it at all remain a wonder to thee, why
Christ should represent himself by such mean and common things: when thou have
well considered, that the excellency of the picture is in its similitude, and
conformity to the original; and that Christ was in a low, sad, and very abased
state, when this picture of him was drawn; he was then a man of sorrows. These
then as lively signs shadow forth a crucified Jesus. Represent him to us in his
red garments. This precious Ordinance may much more than Paul, say to us, I
always bear about in my body, the dying of the Lord Jesus. That Is the thing it
signifies.

Fourthly, Lastly, Take notice of the use, design, and end of of him and of his
sufferings, would turn to our prejudice, and loss. And therefore does he
appoint a sign to be remembered by, as often as ye do this ye show forth the Lords
death till he come. Hence we shall observe, suitable to the design of this
discourse,

DOCT. That the Sacramental memorial Christ left with his people, Doct.
is a special mark of his care, and love for them.
Dominus noster dum vivers, ejus Sacrificii similitudinem celebrandum in (...)
mortis memoriam commendavit. Aug.
What! to order his picture (as it were) to be drawn, when he was dying, to be
left with his Spouse? to rend his own flesh, and set abroch his own blood, to
be meat and drink for our souls! O what manner of love was this! It Is true, his
Picture in the Sacrament is full of scars, and wounds; but these are honorable
scars, and highly grace and commend it to his Spouse, for whose dear sake he
here received them.

They are marks of Love and Honor. And he would be so drawn, or rather he so
drew himself, that as often as his people looked upon that portraicture of him;
they may remember, and be deeply affected with those things, he here endured
for their sakes. These are the wounds my dear Husband Jesus received for me.
These are are the marks of that Love, which passes the Love of creatures. Haet
sunt insignia la^di^.
O see the Love of a Savior! This is that Heavenly Pelican that feeds his
young with his own blood. We have read of pitiful and tender women that have
eaten the flesh of their own children, Lamb. 4.10. But where is that woman
recorded, that gave her own flesh and blood to be meat and drink to her
children? Surely, the Spouse may say of the Love of Christ, what David in his
Lamentations said of the Love of Jonathan, thy Love to me was wonderful,
passing the Love of women. But to prepare the point to be meat indeed, and
drink indeed to thy soul; Reader, I shall discuss briefly these three things,
and hasten to the application.

First, What it is to remember the Lord Jesus in the Sacrament. Secondly, What
aptitude there is in that Ordinance, so to bring him to our remembrance.
Thirdly, How the care and Love of Christ is discovered, by leaving such a
memorial of himself within us.
First, What it is to remember the Lord Jesus in the Sacrament?

Remembrance properly, Orbae memoria, est vis redintegratrix, sive recollectrix
earum imaginum, quae antea quidem memoriae adhaeserunt; posteo vero evan^runt:
appellatur uno nomine reminiscentia. Keckerman: Syet. Phys. lib. 4. cap. 6.
page (mihi) 534.
is the return of the mind to an object, about which it has been formerly
conversant. And it may so return to a thing it has conversed with before, two
ways; speculatively, and transciently; or affectingly, and permanently. A
speculative remembrance, is only to call to mind the history of such a person,
and his sufferings. That Christ was once put to death in the flesh. An
affectionate remembrance is when we so call Christ and his death to our minds,
as to feel the powerful impressions thereof upon our hearts. Thus, Matthew.
26.75. Peter remembered the words of the Lord, and went out, and wept bitterly.
His very heart was melted with that remembrance; his bowels were pained, he
could not hold, but went out, and wept abundantly. Thus Joseph when he saw his
brother Benjamin, whose sight refreshed the memory of former days, and
endearments, was greatly affected, Genesis 43.29, 30. And he lift up his eyes, and
saw his brother Benjamin, his mothers Son; and said, is this your younger
brother of whom ye spoke to me? and he said God be gracious unto thee my Son.
And Joseph made haste, for his bowels did yearn upon his brother, and he sought
where to weep; and he entered into his Chamber and wept there. Such a
remembrance of Christ, is that which is here intended. This is indeed a
gracious remembrance of Christ, the former has nothing of grace in it. The
time shall come, when Judas that betrayed him; and the Jews, that pierced him,
shall hystorically remember what was done, Rev. 1.7. Behold he comes with
clouds, and every eye shall see him; and they also which pierced him; and all
kindreds of the earth, shall wail because of him. They I say Judas shall
remember, this is he whom I perfidiously betrayed. Pilate shall remember, this
is he whom I sentensed to be hanged on the tree, though I was convinced of his
innocence. Then the Soldiers shall remember, this is that Face we spet upon,
that head we crowned with thorns: Lo this is he whose side we pierced, whose
hands and Feet we once nailed to the Cross. But this remembrance will be their
torment, not their benefit. It is not therefore a bare hystorical speculative;
but a gracious, affectionate, impressive remembrance of Christ, that is here
intended: and such a remembrance of Christ, supposes and includes.

First, The saving knowledge of him. We cannot be said to remember what we
never knew; nor to remember savingly, what we never knew savingly. There have
been many previous, sweet, and gracious transactions, dealings, and intimacies
betwixt Christ and his people, from the time of their first happy acquaintance
with him; much of that sweetness they have had in former considerations of him,
and hours of communion with him, are lost, and gone. For nothing is more
volatile, hazardous, and inconstant than our Spiritual comforts: but now, at
the Table, there our old acquintance is renewed, and the remembrance of his
goodness and Love refreshed and revived. We will remember thy Love more than
wine, the upright Love thee, Cant. 1.4.

Secondly, Such a remembrance of Christ includes faith in it. Without
discerning Christ at a Sacrament there is no remembrance of him; and without
faith, no discerning Christ there. But when the precious eye of faith, has
espied Christ under that vail; it presently calls up the affections, saying,
come see the Lord. These are the wounds he received for me. This is he that
Loved me, and gave himself for me. This is his flesh, and that his blood; sic
Occulos, sic ille Manus, etc. so his Arms were stretched out upon the Cross, to
embrace me. So his blessed Head hung down, to kiss me. Awake my Love, rouse up
my Hope, flame out my Desires; come forth O all ye powers and affections of my
soul; come see the Lord.

No sooner does Christ by his Spirit call to the Believer, but faith hears; and
discerning the voice, turns about like Mary, saying, Rabboni, my Lord, my
Master.

Thirdly, This remembrance of Christ includes suitable impressions made upon
the affections, by such a sight and remembrance of him. And therein lies the
nature of that precious thing which we call communion with God. Various
representations of Christ's are made at the Table. Sometimes the soul there
calls to mind the infinite wisdom, that so contrived and laid the glorious and
mysterious design, and project of redemption. The effect of this is wonder and
admiration. O the manifold wisdom of God! Ephesians. 3.10. O the depths, the heights,
the length, the breadth of this wisdom! I can as easily span the heavens, as
take the just demensions of it. Sometimes a representation of the severity of
God is made to the soul at that Ordinance. O how inflexible and severe is the
Justice of God. What no abatements! No sparing mercy! not to his own Son! this
begets a double impression on the heart.

First, Just and deep indignation against sin. Ah cursed sin! 'Twas thou usedst
my dear Lord so. Magna amaritudo peccati, quae tantum amaritudinem peperit Aug.
For thy sake he underwent all this. If thy vileness had not been so great, his
sufferings had not been so many. Cursed sin, thou wast the knife that stabbed
him. Thou the sword, that pierced him. Ah what revenge it works! I remember
it is storied of one of the Kings of France, that hearing his Bishop (as I
remember it was Remigius) read the History of Christ's trial and execution, and
hearing how barbarously they had used Christ; he was moved with so tragical and
pathetical a History, to great indignation against Pilate, the Jews, and the
rude and bloody Soldiers, and could not contain himself; but cried out as the
Bishop was reading, O that I had been there with my Frenchmen, I would have
cut all their throats, who so barbarously used my Savior.

To allude to this: When the Believer considers and remembers that sin put
Christ to all that shame and ignominy; that he was wounded for our
transgressions; he is filled with hatred of sin, and cries out, O sin, I will
revenge the blood of Christ upon thee! thou shall never live a quiet hour in my
heart. And,

Secondly, It produces an humble adoration of the goodness, and mercy of God;
to exact satisfaction for our sins, by such bloody stripes from our surety.
Lord, what if this wrath had seized on me, as it did on Christ; what had been
my condition then! If these things were done in the green tree, what had been
the cafe of the dry tree?

Sometimes representations (and not common ones) are made of the Love of
Christ, Dam conspicis Dominum, te i^ter mortales versari censes? ac non potius
e vestigio in Coelos transferri? Chrysostom. Hom. lib. 3.
who assumed a body and soul on purpose to bear the wrath of God for our sins.
And when that surpassing Love breaks out in its glory upon the soul, how is the
soul transported, and ravished with it! crying out, what manner of Love is
this! Here Is a Love large enough to go round the heavens, and the Heaven of
heavens. Who ever loved after this rate, to lay down his life for enemies! O
Love unutterable, and unconceivable! How glorious is my Love in his red
garments! Sometimes the fruits of his death are there gloriously displaied.
Even his satisfaction for sin, and the purchase his blood made of the eternal
inheritance. And this begets thankfulness, and confidence in the soul. Christ
is dead, and his death has satisfied for my sin. Christ is dead therefore my
soul shall never die. Who shall separate me from the Love of God? These are the
fruits, and this is the nature of that remembrance of Christ, here spoken of.

Secondly, What aptitude, or conducency is there in this Ordinance, to bring
Christ so to remembrance?

Much every way. For it is a sign by him appointed to that end; and has (as
Divines well observe) a threefold use and consideration: viz. as it is
memorative, as it is significative, and as it is instructive.

Quoties haec coena celebratur, to^ies C^ristus moritar; cruce pendentem
Dominum videamus. Aug. in. Ps 21.
First, As it is memorative, and so it has the nature and use of a pledge, or
token of Love, left by a dying, to a dear surviving friend. And so the
Sacrament as was said before, is like a Ring plucked off from Christ's Finger, or
a Bracelet from his Arm; or rather his Picture from his Breast, delivered to us
with such words as these, as often as you look on this, rememember me. Let this
help to keep me alive in your remembrance when I am gone, and out of your
sight. It conduces to it also.

Secondly, As it is a significative sign, most aptly signifying both. his
bitter sufferings for us, and our strict and intimate union with him. Both
which have an excellent usefulness to move the heart, and its deepest
affections at the remembrance of it. The breaking of the Bread, and shedding
forth the Wine signifies the former; our eating, drinking, and incorporating
them, is a lively signification of the other.

Thirdly, Moreover this Ordinance has an excellent use, and advantage for this
affectionate remembrance of Christ, as it is an instructive sign. And it many
ways instructs us, and enlightens our mind, particularly in these truths which
are very affecting things.

First, That Christ is the Bread on which our souls live: proper meat and drink
for Believers: the most excellent New Testament food. It Is said, Psalm. 78.25.
man did eat Angels food: He means the manna, that fell from Heaven. Which was
so excellent, that if Angels who are the noblest creatures, did live-upon
material food; they would choose this above all to feed on. And yet this was
but a Type and weak shadow of Christ, on whom Believers feed. Christ makes a
royal feast, of his own flesh and blood. Isai. 25.6. all our delicates are in
him.

Secondly, It instructs us that the New Testament is now in its full force, and
no sustantial alteration can be made in it, since the the Testator is dead; and
by his death has ratified it. So that all the excellent promises and blessings
of it are now fully confirmed to the believing soul. Heb. 9.16, 17. All these,
and many more choice truths are we instructed in by this sign. And all these
ways it remembers us of Christ, and helps powerfully to raise, warm, and
affect our hearts with that remembrance of him.

Thirdly, The last enquiry is, how Christ has hereby left such

First, This is a special mark of the care and Love of Christ, in as much as
hereby he has made abundant provision, for the confirmation and establishment
of his peoples faith to the end of the world. For this being an evident proof
that the New Testament is in its full force, (Matthew. 26.28. this is the Cup of
the New Testament in my blood:) it tends as much to our satisfaction, as the
legal execution of a deed, by which we hold and enjoy our estate. So that when
he says take, eat, it is as much as if God should stand before you at the
Table with Christ, and all the promises in his hand; and say, I deliver this to
thee as my deed. What think you, does this promote and confirm the faith of a
Believer? if it do not, what does? Secondly, This is a special mark of Christ's
care and Love, in as much as by this he has made like abundant provision for
the enlargement of his peoples joy and comfort. Believers are at this
Ordinance, as Mary was at the Sepulcher, with fear, and great joy. Matthew. 28.8.
Come Reader, speak thy heart, if thou be one that heartily love Jesus Christ,
and have gone many days, possibly years, mourning and lamenting because of the
inevidence and cloudiness of thine interest in him: that have sought him
sorrowing, in this Ordinance, and in that; in one duty, and another; if at last
Christ should take off that mask, that cruel covering (as one calls it) from
his face, and be known of thee in breaking bread. Suppose he should by his
Spirit whisper thus in thine ear, as thou sit at his Table, do thou
indeed so prize, esteem and value me? will nothing but Christ and his Love
content and satisfy thee? then, as sweet, lovely and desirable as I am, know
that I am thine. Take thine own Christ into the arms of thy faith this day.
Would not this breed in thy soul a joy transcendent to all the joys and
pleasures in this world? what think thou of it? Thirdly, Here is a signal
mark of Christ's care and Love, in as much as this is one of the highest and
best helps for the mortification of the corruptions of his people. Nothing
tends more to the killing of sin, than this does. Christ's blood as it is food to
faith, so it is poison to our Lusts. O what a Pill is wrapped up in that Bread!
what an excellent Potion is in that Cup, to purge the soul? One calls that
Table an Altar, on which our corruptions are sacrificed, and slain before the
Lord. For how can they that there see what Christ suffered for sin, live any
longer therein? Fourthly, Moreover, his care and Love appear in providing such
bellows as these, to excite and blow up his peoples Love into a lively flame.
When Joseph made himself known to his Brethren; I am Joseph your Brother, whom
ye sold, be not grieved; Oh, what a shower of tears, and dear affections was
there? How did they fall upon each others necks! so that the Egyptians wondered
at the matter. How does the soul (if I may so speak) passionately love Jesus
Christ at such a time? O what a Christ is my Christ! the fairest among ten
thousand. What has he done, what has he suffered for me! what great things
has my Jesus given, and what great things has he forgiven me! a world, a
thousand worlds, cannot show such another. Here it is melted down by Love at his
feet. It Is pained with Love. Fifthly, To conclude, Christ's care and Love are
farther manifested to his people in this Ordinance, as it is one of the
strongest bonds of union betwixt themselves, that can be. 1 Cor. 10.17. We
being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one
bread. And though through our corruptions, it falls out, that that which was
intended for a bond of union, proves a bond of contention; yet in as much as by
this it appears, how dearly Christ Loved them, for as much also as here they
are sealed up to the same inheritance, their dividing corruptions here slain,
their Love to Christ, and consequently to each other, here improved; it is
certainly one of the strongest ties in the world, to wrap up gracious hearts in
a bundle of Love.
And thus I have dispatched the doctrinal part of this point. The improvement of
it is in the following Inferences.

Inference 1.
Did Christ leave this Ordinance with his Church, Infer. 1.
to preserve his remembrance among his people? then surely Christ foresaw, that
notwithstanding what he is, has done, suffered and promised, yet to do for his
people, they will for all this be still apt to forget him.

A man would think that such a Christ should never be one whole hour together
out of his peoples thoughts, and affections. that where ever they go, they
should carry him up and down with them, in their thoughts, desires, and
delights. That they should let their thoughts work toward Christ, as the
longing thoughts of her that is with Child, do work after that she longs for.
That they should lie down with Christ in their thoughts at night, and when they
awake, be still with him. That their very dreams in the night should be sweet
visions of Christ, and all their words savor of Christ.

But O the baseness of these hearts! Here we live and converse in a world of
sensible objects, which like a company of thieves, rob us of our Christ; and
lay the dead Child in his room. Woe is me, that it should be so with me, who am
so obliged to Love him! though he be in the highest glory in Heaven, he does
not forget us; he has graven us upon the palms of his hands, we are
continually before him. He thinks on us, when we forget him. The whole honor
and glory paid him in Heaven by the Angels, cannot divert his thoughts one
moment from us, but every trifle that meets us in the way, is enough to divert
our thoughts from him. Why do we not abhor and loath our selves for this? What
is it a pain, a burden, to carry Christ in our thoughts about the world? as
much a burden if thy heart be spiritual, as a Bird is burdened by carrying his
own wings.

Will such thoughts intrude unseasonably, and thrust greater things than Christ
out of our minds? For shame Christian, for shame, let no^ thy heart play the
wanton, and gad from Christ after every vanity. In Heaven nothing else takes up
the thoughts of Saints to eternity; and yet there is no tireing, no saciety. O
learn to live nearer that heavenly life. Never leave praying, and striving,
till thou can say as it is, Psalm. 63.5. My soul shall be satisfied as with
marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee, with joyful lips; whilst I
remember thee on my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Hence also we infer, that Sacrament seasons are heart melting seasons: because
therein the most affecting and heart-melting, recognitions and representations
of Christ are made. As the Gospel offers him to the ear, in the most sweet
affecting sounds of grace; so the Sacrament to the eye, in the most taking
visions that are on this side Heaven.

There, hearts that will not yield a tear under other Ordinances, can pour out
floods. Zech. 12.10. They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn.
Yet I dare not affirm, that every one whose heart is broken by the believing
sight of Christ there, can evidence that it is so by a dropping eye. No, we may
say of tears, as it is said of Love, Cant. 8.7. If some Christians would give
all the treasures of their house for them, they cannot be purchased. Yet they
are truly humbled for sin, and seriously affected with the grace of Christ. For
the support of such, I would distinguish, and have them to do so also, betwixt
what is essential to spiritual sorrow, and what is contingent. Deep displeasure
with thy self for sin, hearty resolutions and desires of the complete
mortification of it; this is essential to all spiritual sorrow; but tears are
accidental, and in some constitutions rarely found. If thou have the former,
trouble not thy self for want of the later: though it is a mercy when they
kindly and undis^embledly flow from a heart truly broken.

And surely, to see who it is that thy sins have pierced. How great how
glorious, how wonderful a person that was, that was so humbled, abased, and
brought to the dust, for such a wretched thing as thou art, cannot but tenderly
affect, the considerating soul. If it was for a lamentation in the Captivity,
that Princes were hanged up by the hands, and the faces of the Elders were not
reverenced. Lam. 5.12. And if at the death of Abner, David could lament, and
say, a Prince, and a great man is fallen in Israel this day. 2 Samuel 3.38. If he
could so pathetically lament the death of Saul, and Jonathan, saying, Daughters
of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet. The beauty of Israel is
slain upon the high places. Ah how much more should it affect us, to see the
beauty of Heaven fallen; the Prince of life hang dead upon a Tree! O let the
place where you assemble to so see this sight of your crucified Jesus, be a
Bokim, a place of lamentation.

Inference 3.
Moreover, Infer. 3.
hence it is evident, that the believing and affectionate remembrance of Christ,
is of singular advantage at all times to the people of God. For it is the
immediate end of one of the greatest Ordinances, that ever Christ appointed to
the Church.

To have frequent recognitions of Christ will appear to be singularly
efficatious and useful to Believers, if you consider, First, If at any time thy
heart be dead, and hard, this is the likeliest means in the world to dissolve,
melt and quicken it. Look hither hard heart, hard indeed if this hammer will
not break it. Behold the blood of Jesus. Secondly, Art thou easily overcome by
Temptions to sin? This is the most powerful pull back in the world from sin.
Romans 6.2. How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? We are
crucified with Christ, what have we to do with sin? Such a thought as this,
when thy heart is yielding to Temptations. How can I do this, and crucify the
Son of God afresh! Ha^h he not suffered enough already on earth; shall I yet
make him groan as it were for me in Heaven? look as David poured the water
brought from the Well of Bethlehem on the ground, though he was athirst: for
said he, it is the blood of the men: (i. e.) they eminently hazarded their
lives to fetch it; much more should a Christian pour out upon the ground, yea,
despise and trample under foot the greatest profit or pleasure of sin; saying,
nay, I will have nothing to do with it. I will on no terms touch it, for it is
the blood of Christ. It cost blood, infinitely precious blood, to expiate it.
If there were a knife in your house that had been thrust to the heart of your
Father, you would not take pleasure to see that knife; much less to use it.
Thirdly, Are you afraid your sins are not pardoned, but still stand upon
account before the Lord; what more relieving, what more satisfying, than to see
the Cup of the New Testament in the blood of Christ, which is shed for many for
the remission of sins? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect,
it is Christ that died? Fourthly, Are you staggered at the sufferings, and hard
things you must endure for Christ in this world? does the flesh shrink back
from these things, and cry, spare thy self. What is there in the world more
likely to steel and fortify thy spirit with resolution and courage, than such
a sight as this? Did Christ face the wrath of men, and the wrath of God too?
Did he stand as a pillar of brass, with unbroken patience, and steadfast
resolution, under such troubles as never met in the like height upon any mear
creature, till death beat the last breath out of his nostrils? And shall I
shrink for a trifle? Ah, he did not serve me so! I will arm my self with the
like mind. 1 Pet. 2.2. Fifthly, Is thy faith staggered at the promises? can
thou not rest upon a promise? Here Is that will help thee against hope to
believe in hope; giving glory to God. For this is Gods seal added to his
Covenant, which ratifies, and binds fast all that God has spoken. Sixthly,
Do thou idle away precious time vainly, and live unusefully to Christ in thy
generation; what more apt both to convince and cure thee, than such a
remembrance of Christ as this? O when thou considerest thou art not thine own;
thy time, thy tallents are not thine own, but Christ's. When thou shall see thou
art bought with a price (a great price indeed) and so art strictly obliged to
glorify God, with thy soul and body which are his: 2 Cor. 5.14. This will
powerfully awake, a dull, sluggish, and lazy spirit. In a word, what grace is
there this remembrance of Christ cannot quicken? What sin cannot it mortify?
What duty cannot it animate? O it is of singular use in all cases to the people
of God.


Inference 4.
Lastly, Infer. 4.
Hence we infer; Though all other things do, yet Christ neither does, nor can
grow stale. Here Is an Ordinance to preserve his remembrance fresh, to the end
of the world. The blood of Christ does never dry up. The beauty of this Rose of
Sharon is never lost or withred. He is the same yesterday, to day, and for
ever. As his body in the grave saw no corruption, so neither can his Love, or
any of his excellencies. When the Saints shall have fed their eyes upon him in
Heaven thousands and millions of years, he shall be as fresh, beautiful, and
orient as at the beginning. Other beauties have their prime, and their fading
time; but Christ's abides eternally. Our delight in creatures is often most at
first acquaintance; when we come nearer to them, and see more of them, the edge
of our delight is rebated. But the longer you know Christ, and the nearer you
come to him, still the more do you see of his glory. Every farther prospect of
Christ, entertains the mind with a fresh delight. He is as it were a new Christ
every day; and yet the same Christ still.

Blessed be God for Jesus Christ.
Sermon. 22.
The TWENTY SECOND SERMON. Opens the third preparative act of Christ for his own
death.

LUKE XXII.XLI, XLII, XLIII, XLIV. And he was withdrawn from them about a
stones cast, and kneeled down, and prayed; saying, Father, if thou be willing,
remove this Cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. And
there appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, strengthening him. And being in an
agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was as it were great drops of
blood, falling down to the ground.


THE hour is now almost come, even that hour of sorrow, which Christ had so
often spoken of. Yet a little, a very little while, and the Son of man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. He has affectionately recommended his
Children to his Father. He has set his house in order, and ordained a memorial
of his death, to be left with his people, as you have heard. There is but one
thing more to do, and then the Tragoedy begins. He recommended us, he must also
recommend himself by prayer to the Father, and when that is done, he is ready;
let Judas with the black guard come when they will.

This last Act of Christ's preparation for his own death, is contained in this
Scripture: wherein we have an account, First, Of his Prayer. Secondly, Of the
Agony attending it. Thirdly, His relief in that Agony, by an Angel that came
and comforted him.

First, The Prayer of Christ, in a praying posture he will be solitariness of
it, he withdrew about a stones cast verse. 41. from his dearest intimates. No
ear but his Fathers shall hear what he had now to say. For the vehemence and
importunity of it, these were those (...) Heb. 5.7. strong cries, that he
poured out to God in the days of his flesh. And for the humility expressed in
it, he fell upon the ground, he rolled himself as it were in the dust, at his
Fathers feet. And in diverse other respects it was a very remarkable prayer, as
you will hear anon.

Secondly, This Scripture gives you also an account of the Agony of Christ, as
well as of his prayer: and that a most strange one; such as in all respects,
never was known before in nature. It was a sweat as it had been blood, which
[as] is neither an hyperbole, as some would make it. Nor yet a mere similitude
of blood, as others fancy: but a real bloody sweat. For so (as) is sometimes
taken, for the very thing it self. As Ioh. 1.1^. And as a worthy Divine of our
own well notes, that if the Holy Ghost had only intended it for a similitude,
Mr. Ambrose look^ng to Jesus.
or resemblance, he would rather have expressed it, as it were drops of water,
than as it were drops of blood; for sweat more resembles water, than blood.

Thirdly, You have here his relief in this his Agony, and that

DOCT. That our Lord Jesus Christ, Doct.
was praying to his Father, in an extraordinary Agony: when they came to
apprehend him in the Garden.
To open and prepare this last act of preparation on Christ's part, for our use;
I shall at this time speak to these particulars. First, The place where he
prayed. Secondly, The time when he prayed, Thirdly, The matter of his prayer.
And Lastly, The manner how he prayed.

First, For the circumstance of place, where was this last, and remarkable
prayer poured out to God? It was in the Garden, In locu^ Gethsemane. Gr. (...)
redunt villam vel praedium dictum Gethsemane Heb.
St. Matthew tells us it was called Gethsemane, which signifies (as Pareus on
the place observes) the Valley of fatness viz. of Olives, which grew in that
Valley or Garden most plentifully. This Garden lay very near to the City of
Jerusalem. The City had twelve gates, five of which were on the east side of
it, among which the most remarkable were the fountain-gate, (...) quod sonat
vallem pinguium, nempe olearum, quae nimirum istic uberius proveniebant Par.
so called of the fountain Siloe. Through this gate, Christ rode into the City
in triumph, when he came from Bethany. The other was the sheep-gate, so called
from the multitude of sheep driven in at it for the Sacrifice; for it stood
close by the Temple, and close by this gate was this Garden called Gethsemane:
where they apprehendded Christ, and led him through this gate, as a sheep to
the slaughter. Betwixt this Garden and the City, ran the brook Cedron, which
rose from an hill upon the south, and ran upon the east part of the City,
between Jerusalem, and the mount of Olives: and over this brook Christ passed
into the Garden, Ioh. 18.1. to which the Psalmist alludes in Psalm. 110.7. He
shall drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall he lift up the head. For
this brook running through the Valley of Iehosaphat, that fertile soil,
together with the filth of the City, which it washed away, gave the waters a
black tincture, and so, fitly resembled those grievous sufferings of Christ, in
which he tasted both the wrath of God and men.

Now Christ went not into this garden to hide or shelter himself from his
enemies. No, that was not his end; for if so, it had been the most improper
place he could have chosen: it being the accustomed place, where he was wont to
pray; and a place well known to Judas, who was now coming to seek him, as you
may see, Joh. 18.2. And Judas which betrayed him knew the place, for Jesus
oft-times resorted thither, with his Disciples. So that he repairs thither, not
to shun, but to meet the enemy. To offer himself as a prey to the Wolves, which
there found him, and laid hold upon him. He also resorted thither for an hour
or two of privacy before they came, that he might there freely pour out his
soul to God. So much for the circumstance of place where he prayed.

Secondly, We shall consider the time when he entered into this Tunc, ^emp^
ingruente, jam nocte, postquam p^racta coena paschali and eucharistica eratiis
actis h^mnum ^eantasseat. Par. in Loc.
And it was in the shutting in of the evening. For it was after the Passoever,
and the Supper were ended. Then (as Matthew has it Matthew. 26.36.) Jesus went
over the Brook into the Garden; betwixt the hours of nine and ten in the
evening, as it is conjectured; and so he had betwixt two and three hours time,
to pour out his soul to God. For it was about midnight that Judas and the
Soldiers came and apprehended him there. So that it being immediately before
his apprehension, it shows us in what frame and posture Christ desired to be
found: and by it he left us an excellent pattern, what we ought to do, when
eminent dangers are near us even at the door. Oport^t theologum co^cionant^m
mori.
It becomes a Soldier to die fighting, and a Minister to die preaching, and a
Christian to die praying. If they come they find Christ upon his knees;
wrestling mightily with God by prayer. He never spent one moment of the time of
his life idely; but these were the last moments he had to live in this world,
and here you may see how they were filled up, and employed.

Thirdly, Next let us consider the matter of his prayer, or the verse. 42.
informs us what that was: He prayed saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove
this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine be done. These words are
involved in many difficulties, as Christ himself was when he uttered them. By
the Cup, understand that portion of sorrows then to be distributed to him by
his Father. Great afflictions, and bitter trials are frequently expressed in
Scripture, under the metaphor of a ^up. So that dreadful storm of wrath upon
the wicked, in Psalm. 11.6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire, and
brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup. (i.
e.) the punishment allotted to them by God for their wickedness. And an
exceeding great misery. By a large, or deep cup. So Ezekiel. 23.32, 33. Thou shall
drink of thy Sisters cup deep and large, thou shall be laughed to scorn, and
had in derision; it contains much. Thou shall be filled with drunkenness and
sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation; with the cup of thy Sister
Samaria. And when an affliction is compounded of many bitter ingredients,
stinging and agravating considerations and circumstances, then it is said to be
mixed. In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red. (noting a
bloody trial) It is full of mixture, and he pours out the same, but the dregs
thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them: (i.
e.) they shall have the worst part of the Judgment for their share. Thus
afflictions, and calamities are expressed by the metaphor of a cup, great
calamities, by a deep and large cup. Afflictions compounded of many agravating
circumstances, by a mixed cup. And from the effect it has on them that must
drink it, it is called a cup of trembling, Isai. 57.17. Thou have drunken at the
hand of the Lord, the cup of his fury, the dregs of the cup of trembling. Such
a cup now was Christ's cup. A cup of wrath, a large and deep cup, that contained
more wrath than ever was drunk by any creature: even the wrath of an infinite
God. A mixed cup. Mixed with Gods wrath and man's in the extremity. And all the
bitter agravating circumstances that ever could be imagined. Great
consternation, and amazement, this was the portion of his cup.

By the passing of the cup from him, understand his exemption from suffering
that dreadful and horrid wrath of God, which he foresaw to be now at hand. For
as the coming of the cup to a man does in Scripture phrase note his bearing and
suffering of evil, as you find it, Lam. 4.21. Rejoice and be glad O daughter of
Edom, that dwell in the Land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto
thee: thou shall be drunken, and make thy self naked. Which is an ironical
reproof of the Idumeans, the Jews deadly enemies, who wickedly insulted over
them, when the cup was at their mouths, as if the Lord had said, you have
laughed and jear'd at my people, when my hand was on them; you rejoiced to see
their calamities. Well, make your selves merry still if you can: the cup shall
pass through unto thee. Thy turn is coming: then laugh it thou can. So on the
contrary, the passing away of the cup notes freedom from, or our escaping of
those miseries. And so Christ's meaning in this conditional request is, Father,
if it be thy will excuse me from this dreadful wrath, my soul is amazed at it.
Is there no way to shun it? Cannot I be excused? O if it be possible spare me.
This is the meaning of it. But then here is the difficulty, how Christ who knew
God had from everlasting determined he should drink it, who had compacted and
agreeed with him in the covenant of redemption so to do, who came (as himself
acknowledges) for that end into the world. Ioh. 18.37. Who foresaw this hour
all along; and professed when he spoke of this bloody baptism, with which he
was to be baptized; that he was straightned till it was accomplished, Luke
12.50. How (I say) to reconcile all this with such a petition; that now when
the cup was delivered to him, it might pass, or he be excused from suffering:
this is the knot, this is the difficulty.

What! Did he now repent of the bargain? Was all he said before but a flourish,
before he saw the enemy? Does he now begin to wish his bargain dry? and that he
had never undertaken such a work, is that the meaning of it? Nothing less. No,
no, Christ never repented of his engagement to the Father. Never was willing to
let the burden lie on us, rather than on himself. There was not such a thought
in his holy and faithful heart: but the resolution of this doubt depends upon a
double distinction. Which will clear his meaning in it.

First, You must distinguish of prayers. Some are absolute, and peremptory; and
so to have prayed that the cup might pass, would have been chargeable with such
absurdities as were but now mentioned: others are conditional, and submissive
prayers, if it may be, if the Lord please. And such was this, if thou be
willing, if not I Will drink it. But you will say Christ knew what was the mind
of God in that case. He knew what transactions had of old been betwixt his
Father, and him; and therefore though he did not pray absolutely, yet it is
strange he would pray conditionally it might pass. Therefore in the

Second place, you must diftinguish of the natures according to which Christ
acted. He acted sometimes as God, and sometimes as man. Here he acted according
to his humane nature. Simply expressing, and manifesting in this request the
reluctance it had at such sufferings. Wherein he showed himself a true man, in
shunning that which is destructive to his nature.

As Christ had two distinct natures, so two dictinct wills. And (as one well
observes) in the life of Christ there was an intermixture of power, and
weakness: of the divine glory, and humane frailty. At his birth a star shone,
but he was laid in a manger. The Devil tempted him in the wilderness, but there
Angels ministered to him. As man he was deceived in the figtree, but as God he
blasted it. He was caught by the Soldiers in the Garden, but first made them
fall back. So here, as man he feared, and shunned death; but as God-man he
willingly submitted to it.

It was (as Deodati well expresses it) A purely natural desire, mere man,
Deodati A^rot. in Matthew 26.39.
by which for a short moment he apprehended and shunned death and torments; but
quickly recalled himself to obedience, by a deliberate will, to submit himself
to God. And besides that, this desire was but conditional, under the will of
God, accepted by Christ: but from the comtemplation of which, he was a while
diverted, by the extremity of horrors: therefore there was no sin in it, but
only a short conflict of nature, pesently overcome by reason, and a firm will.
Or a small suspension, quickly overcome by a most strong resolution. Finally
this sacred deliberation in Jesus was not made simply, or in an instant, but
with a short time, and with a counterpoise, which is the natural property of
the soul, in its motions and voluntary actions.

In a word, as there was nothing of sin in it, it being a pure, and sinless
affection of nature: so there was much good in it, and that both as it was a
part of his satisfaction for our sin, to suffer inwardly such fears,
tremblings, and consternations: And as it was a clear evidence that he was in
all things made like unto his brethren, except sin. And Lastly, as it serves
notably to express the grievousness and extremity of the sufferings of Christ,
whose very prospect, and appearance at some distance was ^o dreadful to him.

Parker de desce^si lib. 3. p. 192, etc.
If the Learned Reader desire to see what is farther said on this point, let him
read what the judicious, and learned Parker in his excellent book de descensu
has collected upon that case.

Fourthly, Let us consider the manner how he prayed, and that was, First,
Solitarily. He does not here pray in the audience of his Disciples, as he had
done before; but went at a distance from them. He had now private business to
transact with God. He left some of them, Tristitiae mede lam quaerit in
praecibus; quibus ut liberius vacare possit, modicum s^cedit.
at the entering into the Garden; and for Peter, James and John, that went
farther with him than the rest; he bids them remain there, while he went and
prayed. He did not desire them to pray with him, or for him; no, he must tread
the wine press alone. Nor will he have them with him, possibly left it should
discourage them to see and hear, how he groaned, sweat, trembled, and cried, as
one in an agony, to his Father.

Reader, there are times, and cases, when a Christian would not be willing the
dearest and most intimate friend he has in the world, should be privy to what
passes betwixt him and his God.

Secondly, It was an humble prayer, that is evident by the postures into which
he cast himself. Sometimes kneeling, and sometimes prostrate upon his face. He
creeps in the very dust, lower he cannot fall; and his heart was as low as his
body. He is meek and lowly indeed. Thirdly, It was a reiterated prayer, he
prays, and then returns to the Disciples, as a man in extremity turns every way
for comfort; so Christ prays, Father let the cup pass, but in that the Father
hears him not: though as to support, he was heard. Being denied deliverance by
his Father, he goes and bemoans himself to his pensive friends; and complains
bitterly to them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death. He would ease
himself a little by opening his condition to them; but alas, they rather
increase, than ease his burden. For he finds them asleep, which occasioned that
gentle reprehension from him. Matthew. 26.40. What could you not watch with me
one hour. What, not watch with me? who may expect it from you more than I?
could you not watch, I am going to die for you, and you cannot watch with me?
what! cannot you watch wi^h me one hour? alas, what if I had required great
matters from you? What! not an hour, and that the parting hour too! Christ
finds no ease from them, and back again he goes to that sad place, which he had
stained and purpled with a bloody sweat: and prays to the same purpose again. O
how he returns upon God, over and over, as if he resolved to take no denial!
but however considering it must be so, he sweetly falls in with his Fathers
will. Thy will be done. Fourthly and Lastly, It was a prayer accompanied with a
strange and wonderful agony: so says verse. 44. and being in an agony he prayed
more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood, falling down
to the ground. Now he was red indeed in his apparel as one that trod the
wine press: Non fuit sud^r diaphoreticus, sed crassus and gramosus. Dux quident
indigna mortis metu adeo concussus in animo fuit, ut sanguineum sudorem toto
corpore fudit. Thuan. Lib. 11.
it was not a faint thin dew* but a clotted sweat (...) clodders of blood
falling to the ground. It is disputed whether this sweat were natural, or
preternatural. That some in extremity have sweat a kind of bloody thin dew is
affirmed. I remember Thuanus gives us two instances that come nearest to this,
of any thing I ever observed or heard of. The one was a Captain, who by a
cowardly, and unworthy fear of death, was so overwhelmed with anguish, that a
kind of bloody dew or sweat stood on all his body. The other is of a young man,
condemned for a small matter to die, by Sixtus the 5. who poured out tears of
blood from his eyes; Iuvenis ob levem causam, a Sixto 5. ad mortem dam^atus,
pre doloris vehementia, lacrimas cruentas fudisse, and sangui^em pro sudore;
to^o corpore mittere vis^s est. Thuan. Lib. 80.
and sweat blood from his whole body.


These are strange and rare instances, and the truth of them depends upon the
credit of the relator: But certainly for Christ, whose body had the most
excellent crasis and temperament, to sweat clotted blood, or globs of blood as
some render it; and that in a cold night, when others needed a fire within
doors to keep them warm. Ioh. 18.18. I say for him to sweat such streams
through his garments, falling to the ground on which he lay, must be concluded
a preternatural thing. And indeed, it was not wonderful that such a
preternatual sweat should stream from all parts of his body, if you do but
consider what an extraordinary load pressed his soul at that time: even such as
no mere man ever felt, or was able to stand under. Even the wrath of a great
and terrible God, in the extremity of it. Who (says the prophet Nahum, cap.
1.6.) can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of
his anger? his fury is poured out like fire; and the rocks are thrown down by
him.

The effects of this wrath, as it fell at this time upon the soul of Christ in
the garden, is largely and very emphatically expressed by the several Evangelists
who wrote this tragedy. Matthew tells us his soul was exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death, Matthew. 26.38. The word signifies beset with grief round about.
(...) r^^dequaque tristis. Beza.
And it is well expressed by that phrase of the Psalmist, Psalm. 116.3. The sorrows
of death compassed me about, the pains of Hell got hold upon me. Mark varies
the expression, and gives it us in another word no less significant and full.
(...) medici vocant horripilationem. (...) gravissime angebatur. Bez. (...).
Mark. 14.33. He began to be sore amassed and very heavy. Sore amazed, it
imports so high a degree of consternation and amazement, as when the hair of
the head stands up through fear. Luke has another expression for it, in the
text; he was in an agony. An agony is the laboring, and striving of nature in
extremity. And John gives it us in another expression, Joh. 12.27. now is my
soul troubled. The original word is a very full word. (...) ^nde tartarus quia
terret omnia.
And it is conceived the Latins derive that word which signifies Hell, from
this by which Christ's trouble is here expressed. This was the load which
oppressed his soul, and so straightned it with fear, and grief, that his eyes
could not vent or ease it sufficiently by tears: but the innumerable pores of
his body are set open, to give vent by letting out streams of blood. And yet
all this while, no hand of man was upon him. This was but a praelude as it
were, to the conflict that was at hand. This bloody sweat in which he prayed,
was but as the giving or sweating of the stones before a great rain. Now he
stood as it were arraigned at Gods bar, and had to do immediately with him. And
you know it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The
uses of this follow in this order.

Inference 1.
Did Christ pour out his soul to God, Infer. 1.
so ardently in the garden, when the hour of his trouble was at hand? Hence we
infer, that prayer is a singular preparative for, and relief under the greatest
troubles.

It Is sweet, when troubles find us in the way of our duty. The best posture we
can wrestle with afflictions in, is to engage them upon our knees. The
naturalist tells us, if a Lion find a man prostrate, he will do him no harm.
Christ hastened to the garden to pray, when Judas and the Soldiers were
hastening thither to apprehend him. O when we are nigh to danger, it is good for
us to draw nigh to our God. Then should we be urging that seasonable request to
God, Psalm. 22.11. Be not far from me for trouble is near; for there is none to
help. Woe be to him, whom death or troubles finds a far off from God. And as
prayer is the best preparative for troubles; so the choicest relief under them.
Griefs are eased by groans. The heart is cooled and disburdened, by spiritual
evaporations. You know it is some relief if a man can pour out his complaint
into the bosom of a faithful friend, though^ he can but pity him: how much more
to pour out our complaints into the bosom of a faithful God, who can both pity
and help us! Luther was wont to call prayers the Leaches of his cares and
sorrows: they suck out the bad blood. It Is the title of Psa. 102. A prayer for
the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed; and pours out his complaint before the
Lord. It Is no small ease to open our hearts to God. When we are as full of
grief as Elihu was of matter, let us say as he did, Job. 32.19, behold, Lord,
my heart is as wine which has no vent, it is ready to burst as new bottles. I
will speak that I may be refreshed.

To go to God when thou art full of sorrow, when thy heart is ready to burst
within thee, as it was with Christ in this day of his trouble; and say, Father,
thus, and thus the case stands with thy poor child. And so, and so it is with
me. I will not go up and down whining from one creature to another, it is to no
purpose to do so; nor yet will I leave my complaint upon my self: but I will
tell thee Father, how the case stands with me. For to whom should children make
their moan, but to their Father? Lord I am oppressed, undertake for me. What
think thou Reader of this? Is it relieving to a sad soul? Yes, yes, if thou
be a Christian, that have had any experience this way; thou will say there is
nothing like it. Thou will bless God for appointing such an Ordinance as
prayer, and say, blessed be God for prayer. I know not what I should have done,
nor how in all the world I should have waded through the troubles I have past,
if it had not been for the help of prayer.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Did Christ withdraw from the Disciples to seek God by prayer? Thence it
follows, That the company of the best men, is not always seasonable.

Peter, James and John, were three excellent men, and yet Christ says to them
tarry ye here, while I go and pray yonder. The society of men is beautiful in
its season, and no better than a burden out of season. I have read of a good
man, that when his stated time for closet prayer was come; he would say to the
company that were with him, whatever they were; Friends I must beg your excuse
for a while, there is a friend waits to speak with me. The company of a good
man is good, but it ceases to be so when it hinders the enjoyment of better
company. One hour with God is to be preferred to a thousand days enjoyment of
the best man on earth. If the dearest friends thou have in the world intrude
unseasonably betwixt thee and thy God, it is neither rude nor unmannerly to bid
them give place to better company. I mean to withdraw from them as Christ did
from the Disciples, to enjoy an hour with God alone. In public and private
duties, we may admit of the company of others to join with us, and if they be
such as fear God, the more the better; but in secret duties Christ and thee
must whisper it over betwixt your selves. And then the company of the wife of
thy bosom, or thy friend that is as thine own soul, would not be welcome. When
thou prayest enter into thy closet, and when thou have shut thy door, pray to
thy Father which is in secret, Matthew. 6.6. It is as much as if Christ had said,
see all clear. Be sure to retire in as great privacy as may be. Let no ear but
Gods hear what thou have to say to him. This is at once a good note of
sincerity, and a great help to spiritual liberty, and freedom with God.

Inference. 3.
Did Christ go to God thrice upon the same account, Infer. 3.
thence learn, That Christians should not be discouraged, though they have
sought God once and again; and no answer of peace comes. Christ was not heard
the first time. And he goes a second; he was not answered the second, he goes
the third, and last time, yet was not answered in the thing he desired, viz.
that the cup might pass from him, and yet he has no hard thoughts of God, but
resolves his will into his Fathers. If God deny you in the things you ask, he
deals no otherwise with you, than he did with Christ. O my God (says he) I cry
in the daytime, but thou hear not, and in the night, and am not silent. Yet
he justifies God, but thou art holy. Psalm. 22.2. Christ was not heard in the
thing he desired, and yet heard in that he feared. Heb 5.7. The cup did not
pass as he desired, but God upheld him, and enabled him to drink it. He was
heard as to support, he was not heard as to exemption from sufferings, his will
was expressed conditionally, and therefore though he had not the thing he so
desired; yet his will was not crossed by the denial. But now when we have a
suit depending before the throne of grace, and cry to God once and again, and
so answer comes. How do our hands hang down? and our spirits wax feeble!

Then we complain with the Church, Lam. 3.8. When I cry and shout, he shuts
out my prayer, thou coverest thy self with a cloud, that our prayers cannot
pass through. Then with Jonah we conclude we are cast out of his sight. Alas!
we judge by sense, according to what we see and feel, and cannot live by faith
on God, when he seems to hide himself, put us off, and refuse our requests. It
calls for an Abraham's faith, to believe against hope, giving glory to God. If
we cry, and no answer comes presently, our carnal reason draws a headlong,
'hasty conclusion; sure I must expect no answer. God is angry with my prayers.
The seed of prayer has lain so long under the clods, and it appears not,
surely it is lost, I shall hear no more of it.

Our prayers may be heard, though their answer be for present suspended. As
David acknowledged when he cooly considered the matter, Psalm. 31.22. I said in
my have, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest the
voice of my supplication, when I cried unto thee, No, no, Christian; a prayer
sent up in faith according to the will of God, cannot be lost; though it be
delaid. We may say of it as David said of Saul's sword, and Ionathans bow; that
they never return empty.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Was Christ so earnest in prayer that he prayed himself into a very agony? Let
the people of God blush to think how unlike their Spirits are to Christ, as to
their prayer frames.

O what lively, sensible, quick, deep, and tender apprehensions and sense of
those things about which he prayed had Christ? Though he saw his very blood
starting out from his hands, and his clothes died in it; yet being in an agony
he prayed the more earnestly. I do not say Christ is imitable in this. No, but
his fervor in prayer is a pattern for us, and serves severely to rebuke the
laziness, dullness, torpor, formality, and stupidity that is in our prayers. How
often do we bring the Sacrifice of the dead, before the Lord! How often do our
lips move, and our hearts stand still? Oh how unlike Christ are we! his prayers
were pleading prayers, full of mighty arguments, and ferverous affectations. O
that his people were in this more like him!

Inference 5.
Was Christ in such an agony before any hand of man was upon him? Infer. 5.
merely from the apprehensions of the wrath of God, with which he now
contested; then surely it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God, for our God is a consuming fire.

Ah what is divine wrath! that Christ so staggered when the cup came to him.
Could not he bear, and do thou think to bear it? Did Christ sweat clots of
blood at it, and do thou make light of it. Poor wretch, if it staggered him,
it will confound thee. If it made him groan, it will make the howl, and that
eternally. Come sinner, come, do thou make light of the threatenings of the
wrath of God against sin? Do thou think there is no such great matter in it,
as these zealous Preachers make of it? Come look here upon my text which shows
thee the face of the Son of God standing as full of purple drops, under the
sense and apprehension of it, as the drops of dew that hung upon the grass.
Hark how he cries, Father if it be possible let this cup pass. O any thing of
punishment rather than this. Here what he tells the Disciples. My soul says he
is sorrowful, even to death: amazed, very heavy. Fools make a mock of sin, and
the threatenings that lie against it.

Inference 6.
Did Christ meet death with such a heavy heart, Infer. 6.
let the hearts of Christians be the lighter for this, when they come to die.
The bitterness of death was all squeezed into Christ's cup. He was made to drink
up the very dregs of it: that so our death might be the sweeter to us. Alas,
there is nothing now left in death that is frightful, or troublesome beside the
pain of disolution, that natural evil of it. I remember it is storied of one of
the Martyrs, that being observed to be exceeding jocund, and merry when he came
to the stake; one asked him what was the reason his heart was so light when
death (and that in such a terrible form too) was before him? O said he, my
heart is so light at my death, because Christ's heart was so heavy at his death.

Inference 7.
Infer. 7.
To conclude, what cause have all the Saints to love their dear Lord Jesus with
an abounding love. Christian, open the eyes of thy faith, and fix them upon
Christ, in the posture he lay in the garden, drencht in his own blood: and see
whether he be not lovely in these his dyed garments. He that suffered for us
more than any creature could or did, may well challenge more love than all the
creatures in the world. O what has he suffered, and suffered upon thy account!
it was thy pride, earthliness, sensuality, unbelief, hardness of heart that
laid on more weight in that day that he sweat blood.

The TWENTY THIRD Sermon. 23.
SERMON. Discovers the first preparation for Christ's death on his enemies part,
by the treason of Judas.

MAT. XXVI.XL VII, XL VIII, XLIX. And while he yet spoke, lo Judas one of the
twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the
chief Priests, and Elders of the people. Now he that betrayed him, gave them a
sign, saying, whomsoever I shall kiss, the same is he, hold him fast. And
forthwith he came to Jesus and said, hail Master, and kissed him.


THE former Sermons give you an account how Christ improved every moment of his
time, with busy diligence, to make himself ready for his death. He has
commended his charge to the Father. Instituted the blessed memorial of his
death. Poured out his soul to God in the Garden, with respect to the grievous
sufferings he should undergo. And now he is ready, and waits for the coming of
the enemies, being first in the field.

And think you that they were idle on their parts? No, no, their malice made
them restless. They had agreed with Judas to betray him. Under his conduct a
band of Soldiers are sent to apprehend him. The hour so long expected is come.
For, while he yet spoke, says the text, lo Judas one of the twelve came, and
with him a great multitude, with swords, and staves.

These words contain the first preparative act on their part for the death of
Christ: even to betray him, and that by one of his own Disciples. Now they
execute what they had plotted, verse. 14, 15. and in this paragraph, you have an
account, First, Of the Traitor who he was. Secondly, Of the Treason, what he
did. Thirdly, Of the Manner of its execution, how it was contrived and
affected. Lastly, Of the Time, when they put this Hellish plot in execution.

First, We have here a description of the Traitor: and it is remarkable, how
carefully the several Evangelists, have described him, both by his name,
surname and office, Judas, Judas Iscariot, Judas Iscariot one of the twelve:
that he might not be mistaken for Jude or Judas the Apostle. God is tender of
the names and reputations of his upright hearted Servants. His office one of
the twelve, is added, to aggravate the fact; and to show how that prophecy was
accomplished in him. Psalm. 41.9. Yea mine own familiar friend, in whom I
trusted; which did eat of my bread, has lift up his heel against me. Lo, this
was the Traitor, and this was his name and office.

Secondly, You have a description of the Treason, or an account what this man
did. He led an armed multitude to the place where Christ was. Gave them a
signal to discover him, and encouraged them to lay hands on him, and hold him
fast. This was that Hellish design, which the Devil put into his heart, working
upon that principle, or lust of covetousness, which was predominant there. What
will not a carnal heart attempt, if the Devil suit a temptation to the
predominant lust, and God withhold restraining grace!

Quid opus est ^rmis contra i^ermem? qui si virtutem suam exercere voluit,
nuilis armis erat superabili^. Qu^rsum s^gnum ut errarent in persona, quia ^ox
erat, etc. D. Par. 4. in Loc.
Thirdly, You have here the way and manner in which this Hellish plot was
executed. It was managed both with force, and with fraud. He comes with a
multitude, armed with swords and staves, in case he should meet with any
resistance. And he comes to him with a kiss, which was their signal, lest they
should mistake the man. For they aimed neither at small nor great, save only at
the King of Israel. The King of glory. Here was much ado you see to take a
harmless Lamb, that did not once start from them, but freely offered himself to
them.

Fourthly, and Lastly, When was this treasonable design executed upon Christ?
And it was executed upon him while he stood among his Disciples exhorting them
to prayer, and watchfulness. Dropping Heavenly, and most seasonable counsels
upon them. While he yet spoke, lo Judas, and with him a multitude came with
swords and stave. Surely it is no better than a Judas trick, to disturb, and
afflict the servants of God in the discharge of their duties. This was the
Traitor, and his Treason; thus it was executed, and at this time. Hence we
observe.

DOCT. That it was the Lot of our Lord Jesus Christ, Doct.
to be betrayed into the hands of his mortal enemies, by the assistance of a
false and dissembling friend.
Look as Joseph was betrayed and sold by his brethren. David by Achithophel,
his old friend. Sampson by Dalilah that lay in his bosom: So Christ by Judas
one of the twelve. A man, his friend, his familiar, that had been so long
conversant with him. He that by profession had lifted up his hand to Christ;
now by treason lifts up his heel against him. He bids the Soldiers bind those
blessed hands, that not long before had washed the Traitors feet.

In the point before us, we will First, Consider Judas, according to that
eminent station and place he had under Christ. Secondly, We will consider his
Treason, according to the several aggravations of it. Thirdly, We will inquire
into the Cause, or motives that put him upon such a dreadful hellish design as
this was. Fourthly, and Lastly, We will view the Issue, and see the event of
this treason, both as to Christ, and as to himself, and then apply it.


First, As for the person that did this, he was very eminent by reason of that
dignity Christ had raised him to. He was one of the twelve. A person retained
not in a more general, and common: but the nearest, and most intimate and
honorable relation and service to Jesus Christ. There were in Christ's time
several sorts and ranks of persons, that had relation to Christ. There were
secret Disciples: men that believed, but kept their stations, and abode with
their relations in their callings.

There were the seventy also, whom Christ sent forth; but none of these were so
much with Christ, or so eminent in respect of their place as the twelve. They
were Christ's family; day and night conversant with him: it was the highest
dignity that was conferred upon any: and of this number was Judas. The Ancients
have much extolled the Apostolical dignity. Some styled these twelve pedes
Christi the feet of Christ, because they as it were carried Christ up and down
the world. Others oculi Dei, the very eyes of God; they were his watchmen, that
took care for the concernments of his name and Gospel in the world. Others
mammae Ecclesiae, the breasts of the Church. They fed, and nourisht the
children of God by their doctrine. Now to be one of this number, one of the
twelve, what a dignity was this?

(2.) Yea, he being one of the twelve, was daily conversant with Christ. Often
joined with him in prayer, often sat at his feet hearing the gracious words
that came forth of his mouth. It was one of Austins three wishes, that he had
seen Christ in the flesh, Judas not only saw him, but dwelt with him, traveled
with him, eat and drank with him. And during the whole time of his abode with
him, all Christ's carriages toward him, were very obliging and winning; yea,
such was the condescension of Christ to this wretched man; that he washed his
feet; and that but a little before he betrayed him.

(3.) He was a man of unsuspected integrity among the Apostles. When Christ
told them one of you shall betray me; none thought on him, but every one rather
suspected himself. Lord is it I? says one, and so said they all. But none
pointed at Judas, saying thou art he.

(4.) To conclude, in some respect he was preferred to the rest. For he had not
only a joint commission with them to preach the Gospel to others; (though poor
unhappy wretch, himself became a cast away.) but he had a peculiar office. He
bare the bag. (i. e.) he was Almoner, or the Steward of the family, to take
care to provide for the necessary accommodations of Christ, and them. Now who
could ever have suspected, that such a man as this should have sold the blood
of Christ for a little money? that ever he should have proved a perfidious
Traitor to his Lord, who had called him, honored him, and carried himself so
tenderly toward him? and yet so it was, lo Judas one of the twelve came, and
with him a multitude: O whither will not a busy Devil, and a bad heart carry a
man!

Secondly, But what did this man do? And what are the just

Blush O Heavens, and be astonished O Earth at this! in this fact, most black
and horrid aggravations appear.

First, Judas had seen the majesty of a God on him whom he betrayed. He had
seen the Miracles that Christ wrought, which none but Christ could do. He knew
that by the finger of God, he had raised the dead, cast out Devils, healed the
sick. He could not choose but observe and see the rays and awful beams of
divine Majesty shining in his very face; in his doctrine, and in his life. To
betray a man, to sell the blood of the poorest innocent in the world is horrid;
but to sell the blood of God, O what is this! here is a wickedness that no
epithete can match! yea,

Secondly, This wickedness he committed after personal warnings, and
praemonitions given him by Christ. He had often told them in general, that one
of them should betray him. Mark 14.20. He had also denounced a dreadful woe upon
him that should do it, verse. 21. The Son of man goes indeed, as it is written
of him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; good had it been
for that man, if he had never been born. This was spoken in Judas his presence.
And one would have thought so dreadful a doom as Christ passed upon the man
that should attempt this, should have affrighted him far enough from the
thoughts of such a wickedness. Nay Christ comes nearer to him than this, and
told him he was the man. For when Judas (who was the last that put the question
to Christ) asked him, Master is it I? Christ's answer imports as much as a plain
affirmation, Thou have said, Matthew. 26.25. Moreover,

Thirdly, He does it not out of a blind zeal against Christ as many of his
other enemies did: of whom it is said, 1 Cor. 2.8. That had they known him, they
would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But he did it for money, to make his
market of Christ. He sold Christ as a man would sell an Ox, or a Sheep to the
Butcher, S^avi^ ordor lucri ex re qualibet.
for profit. He was fully of the mind of the Pope, whose motto was; the smell
or savor of gain is sweet, let it rise out of what it will. If he can get any
thing by Christ's blood, it shall be a vendible commodity with him. What will ye
give me (says he) and I will betray him, Matthew. 26.15.

Fourthly, He sells him, and he sells him at a low rate too; which showed how
vile an esteem he had of Christ. He is content to part with him for thirty
pieces of silver. If these pieces or sheckles were the sheckles of the
sanctuary, they amounted but to three pounds fifteen shillings. But it is
supposed they were the common sheckles, Godw. Antiq. lib. 6. p. 295.
which were mostly used in buying and selling; and then his price that he put
upon the Savior of the world was but one pound seaventeen shillings and six
pence. A goodly price (as the Prophet calls it) that he was valued at, Zech.
11.12, 13. I confess it is a wonder he asked no more, knowing how much they
longed for his blood; and that they offered no more for him; but how then
should the Scriptures have been fulfilled? O what a sale was this! to sell that
blood, which all the Gold and Silver in the world is not worth one drop of, for
a trifle! Still the wickedness of this fact rises higher, and higher.

Hand dubie e Bethania abii^, ubi Dominum tunc morabitu^; and vel clam se aliis
subduxit in urhem; vel sub pretextu curandi necessaria Par.
Fifthly, He left Christ in most Heavenly and excellent employment, when he
went to make this soul undoing bargain. For if he went away from the Table as
some think, then he left Christ instituting and administering those Heavenly
Signs of his body and blood. There he saw, or might have seen the bloody work
he was going about; acted as in a figure before him. If he sat out that
Ordinance, as others suppose he did. Then he left Christ singing an Heavenly
hymn, and preparing to go where Judas was preparing to meet him. When the Lord
Jesus was in the most serious and heavenly exercise, the wretch slinked away
from him into the City, or else went under pretense to buy some necessaries.
But his design was not to buy, but to sell, whatever his pretenses were. Nay,

Sixthly, What he did was not done by the persuasions of any. The High Priest
sent not for him, and without doubt was surprised when he he came to him on
such an errand. For it could never enter into any of their hearts, that any of
his own Disciples could ever be drawn into a confederacy against him. No, he
went as a Voluntier, offering himself to this work: which still heightens the
sin; and makes it out of measure sinful.

Seaventhly, The manner in which he executes his treasonable design, adds
further malignity to the fact. He comes to Christ with fawning words, and
carriages: Hail Master, and kissed him. Here Is honey in the tongue, and poison in
the heart. Here Is hatred hid under lying lips. This was the man, and this was
his fact. Let us enquire.

Thirdly, The cause and motives of this wickedness, how he Maldonate the Jesuit
criminates the Protestant Divines, for affirming that God had an hand in
ordering, and overruling this fact. But we say, that Satan and his own Lust was
the impulsive cause of it. That God as it was a wicked treason, permitted it.
And as it was a delivering Christ to death, I^ quantum suit (...) predito secit
Judas, Satana impulsore. I^ quantum fuit (...) traditio illa fuit occultum Dei
judicium, ad redemptionem Ecclesiae spectans. Utique totum illud opus Deum no^
modo non oti^sum per nissorem, sed and sapientissimum authorem atque directorem
habuit. Par.
was not only the permitter, but the wise and holy director or orderer of it,
and by the wisdom of his providence overruled it to the great good, and
advantage of the Church; in respect of which happy issue, Judas his treason is
called faelix scelus, a happy wickedness. Satan inspired the motion, Luke 22.3,
4. Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed. Iscariot, and he went his way, etc.
his own Lusts like dry tinder kindled presently: his heart was covetous; there
was predisposed matter enough for the Devil to work on, so that it was but
touch and take. Verse. 25. They covenanted to give him money, and he promised,
etc.

The holy God disposed, and ordered all this to the singular benefit and good
of his people, Acts 4.28. they did whatsoever his hand and counsel had before
determined to be done. And by this determinate counsel of God was he taken and
slain. Acts 2.23. Yet this no way excuses the wickedness of the Instruments.
For what they did, was done from the power of their own lusts most wickedly;
what he did, was done in the unsearchable depth of his own wisdom, most holy.
God knows how to serve his own ends, by the very sins of men, and yet have no
communion at all in the sin, he so overrules. If a man let go a Dog out of his
hand, in pursuit of a Hare, the Dog hunts merely for a prey; but he that let
him go, uses the sagacity and nimbleness of the Dog to serve his own ends by
it. Judas minded nothing but his own advantage to get money. God permitted that
Lust to work; but overruled the issue to his own eternal glory, and the
salvation of our souls.

Fourthly, Lastly, but what was the end and issue of this fact? As to Christ,
it was his death; for the hour being come he does not meditate an escape, nor
put forth the power of his Godhead to deliver himself out of their hands.
Indeed he showed what he could do, when he made them go back and stagger with a
word. He could obtain more than twelve legions of Angels, to have been his
lifeguard; one of whom had been sufficient to have coped with all the Roman
legions: but how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, or our Salvation
accomplished? No, he resists not, but Judas delivering him into their hands, at
that time, was his death.

And what got he as a reward of his wickedness? It ended in the ruin both of
his soul and body. For immediately a deathpang of despair seized his
Conscience; which was so intolerable, that he ran to the halter for a remedy.
And so falling headlong he burst assunder, and all his bowels gushed out. Acts
1.18. And now he that had no bowels for Christ, has none for himself. As for
his soul, it went to its own place, verse. 25. Even the place appointed for the
son of perdition, as Christ calls him. John 17.12. His name retains an odious
stench to this day, and shall to all generations. It Is a byword. A Proverb of
reproach. This was his end. We will next improve it.

Corollary 1.
Hence in the first place we learn, Cor. 1.
that the greatest professors had need be jealous of their own hearts, and look
well to the grounds and principles of their professions. One of the Ancients
would have had this Epitaph engraven upon Judas his Tombstone (...), (i. e.)
let every one that beholds me, learn to be godly indeed; to be sincere in his
profession, and love Christ more unfeignedly than I did. O Professors look to
your foundation, and build not upon the sand, as this poor creature did. Debile
fundamentum fallit opus.
That Is sound advice indeed which the Apostle gives, 1 Cor. 10.12. Let him that
thinks he he stands, take heed lest he fall.

O beware of a loose foundation. If you begin your profession as Judas did, no
wonder if it shall end as his did. (1.) Beware therefore you hold not the truth
in unrighteousness. Judas did so: he knew much, but lived not up to what he
knew; for he was still of a worldly spirit, in the height of his profession.
His knowledge never had any saving influence upon his heart. He Preached to
others, but he himself was a castaway. He had much light, but still walked in
darkness. He had no knowledge to do himself good.

Secondly, Beware you live not in a course of secret sin. Judas did so, and
that was his ruin. He made a profession indeed, and carried it smoothly; but
he was a thief, Ioh. 12.6. He made no conscience of committing the sin, so he
could but cover and hide it from men. This helped on his ruin, and so it will
thine, Reader, if thou be guilty herein. A secret way of sinning, under a
covert of profession; will either break out at last to the observation of men,
or else slide thee down insensibly to Hell; and leave thee only this comfort,
that no body shall know thou art there.

Thirdly, Beware of hypocritical pretenses of Religion, to accommodate self
ends. Judas was a man that had notable skill this way. He had a mind to fill
his own purse, by the sale of this costly ointment which Mary bestowed upon her
Saviors feet. And what a neat cover had he fitted for it, to do his business
clearly. Why says he, this might have been sold for three hundred pence, and
given to the poor. Here was Charity to the poor, or rather poor Charity; for
they were only a blind to his base self ends. O Christian, be plain hearted:
take heed of craft and cunning in matters of Religion. This spoiled Judas.

Fourthly, Beware of self confidence. Judas was a very confident man of
himself. Last of all Judas said Master is it I? Matthew. 26.25. But he that was
last in the suspicion, was first in the transgression. He that trusts his own
heart is a fool, says Solomon, Prove. 28.26. such a fool was this great
Professor. It will be your wisdom to keep a jealous eye upon your own hearts,
and still suspect its fairest pretenses.

Fifthly, If you will not do as Judas did, nor come to such an end as he did;
take heed you live not unprofitably under the means of grace. Judas had the
best means of grace, that ever man enjoyed. He heard Christ himself Preach, he
joined often with him in prayer; but he was never the better for it all: it was
but as the watering of a dead-stick, which will never make it grow, but rot it
the sooner. Never was there a rotten branch so richly watered as he was. O it is
a sad sin, and a sad sign too; when men and women live under the Gospel from
year to year, and never the better. I warn you to beware of these evils, all ye
that profess Religion. Let these footsteps by which Judas went down to his own
place, terrify you from following him in them.

Corollary. 2.
Cor. 2.
Learn hence also, that eminent knowledge and profession, puts a special and
eminent aggravation upon sin. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve* Maxima
violatio Conscie^tiae, est maximum p^ccatum. Ames.
Poor wretch, better had it been for him, if he had never been numbered with
them: nor enlightened with so much knowledge as he was endued with: for this
rent his Conscience to pieces, when he reflected on what he had done: and
presently run himself into the gulf of despair. To sin against clear light, is
to ^in with an high hand. It Is that which makes a sad waste of the Conscience.
That without doubt which now torments this poor soul in Hell, is that he should
go against his light, against his profession, to gratify a base lust to his
eternal ruin. Had he known no better, it had been more excusable. Those that
had a hand in the death of Christ through mistake and ignorance, were capable
to receive the pardon of their sin by that blood they so shed, Act. 3.17, 19.
compared. Take heed therefore of abusing knowledge, and putting a force upon
Conscience.

Corollary 3.
Learn hence in the third place, Cor. 3.
That unprincipled Professors will sooner or later become shameful Apostates.
^udas was an unprincipled Professor, and see what he came to. Ambition invited
Simon Magus to the profession of Christ, he would be (...), some great one. And
how quickly did the rottenness of his principles discover themselves in the
ruin of his profession? that which wants a root, must needs wither, as Christ
speaks, Matthew. 13.20, 21. that which is the predominant interest will prevail,
and sway with us in the day of our trial. Hear me all you that profess
Religion, and have given your names to Christ; if that profession be not built
upon a sollid and real work of grace upon your hearts, you shall never honor
Religion, nor save your souls by it. O it is your union with Christ, that like a
spring maintains your profession. Munimur quatenus unimur.
So much as you are united to Christ, so much constancy, steadiness, and
eavenness you will manifest in the duties of Religion, and no more.

O Brethren, when he that professes Christ for company, shall be left alone as
Paul was. When he that made Religion a stirrup to help him into the sadle of
preferment, and honor, shall see that he is so advanced to be drawn forth into
Christ's camp and endure the heat of the day, and not to take his pleasure: in a
word, when he shall see all things about him discouraging, and threatening; his
dearest interest on earth exposed for Religion sake; and he has no faith to
balance his present losses, with his future hopes: I say when it comes to
this, you shall then see the rottenness of many hearts discovered. And Judas
may have many fellows, who will part with Christ for the world as he did. O
therefore look well to your foundation.

Corollary 4.
Moreover, Cor. 4.
in this example of Judas you may read this truth; That men and women are never
in more eminent danger, than when they meet with temptations exactly suited to
their master-lusts; to their own iniquity. O pray, pray, that ye may be kept
from a violent suitable temptation. Satan knows that when a man is tried here,
he falls by the root. The love of this world was all along Judas his
master-sin, and some conjecture he was a married man, and had a great charge;
but that is conjectural, it was his predominant Lust. The Devil found out this,
and suited it with a temptation, which fully hit his humor, and it carries him
immediately. This is the dangerous Crisis of the soul. Now you shall see what
it is, and what it will do. Put money before Judas, and presently you shall see
what the man is.

Corollary 5.
Cor. 5.
Hence in like manner we are instructed, That no man knows where he shall stop,
when he first engages himself in a way of sin.

Nemo repent fit turpissimus.
Wickedness, as well as holiness is not born in its full strength, but grows up
to it by insensible degrees. So did the wickedness of Judas. I believe, he
himself never thought he should have done what he did, and if any should have
told him, in the first beginning of his profession; thou shall sell thee blood
of Christ for money. Thou shall deliver him most perfidiously into their hands
that seek his life; he would have answered as Hasael did to Elisha, But what is
thy servant a Dog that he should do this great thing? 2 Kings 8.13. His
wickedness first discovered it self in murmuring and discontent, taking a pipue
at some small matters against Christ, as you may find by comparing John 6. from
the 60. to the 70. verse with John 12. from the 3. to the 9. verse, but see to
what it grows at last. That Lust or Temptation that at first is but a little
cloud, as big as a man's hand, may quickly overspread the whole heaven. It is in
our engaging in sin, as in the motion of a stone down the hill. Vires acquirit
eundo, it strengthens it self by going, and the longer it runs, the more
violent. Beware of the smallest beginnings of temptations. No wise man will
neglect or slight the smallest spark of fire, especially if he see it among
many barrels of gunpouder. You carry gunpouder about you, O take heed of sparks.

Corollary 6.
Did Judas sell Christ for money? Cor. 6.
What a potent conqueror is the love of this world! How many has it cast down
wounded? What great Professors have been dragged at its Chariot wheels as its
captives? Hymeneus and Philetus, Ananias and Saphira, Demas and Judas, with
thousands and ten thousands since their days, led away in triumph. It drowns
men in perdition. 1 Timothy 6.9. in that pit of perdition, this Son of perdition
fell, and never rose more. O you that so court and prosecute it, that so love
and admire it, make a stand here. Pause a little upon this example. Consider to
what it brought this poor wretch whom I have presented to you dead, eternally
dead, by the mortal wound that the love of this world gave him; it destroyed
both soul and body. Pliny tells us that the Mermaids delight to be in green
meadows into which they draw men, by their enchanting voices; but says he
there always lie heaps of dead men's bones by them. A lively emblem of a
bewitching world. Good had it been for many Professors of Religion, if they had
never known what the riches, and honors, and pleasures of this world meant.

Corollary 7.
Did Judas fancy so much happiness in a little money that he would sell Christ
to get it? Cor. 7.
Learn then, That which men promise themselves much pleasure and contentment
in, in the way of sin, may prove the greatest curse and misery to them, that
ever befell them in the world.

Judas thought it was a brave thing to get money; he fancied much happiness in
it: but how sick was his Conscience as soon as he had swallowed it! O take it
again says he; it griped him to the heart. He knows not what to do to rid
himself of that money. Give me children (said Rachel) or I die: she has
children and they prove her death. O mortify your fancies to the world. Put no
necessity upon riches. They that will be rich, fall into temptations, and many
hurtful Lusts, which drown men in perdition, 1 Timothy 6.9. You may have your
desires with a curse. He that brings home a pack of fine clothes infected with
the plague, has no such great bargain of it, how cheap soever he bought them.

Corollary 8.
Cor. 8.
Was there one, and but one of the twelve that proved a Judas, a Traitor to
Christ? Learn thence, That it is a most unreasonable thing to be prejudiced at
Religion, and the sincere professors of it; because some that profess it, prove
naught and vile.

Should the Eleven suffer for one Judas? Alas, they abhorred both the Traitor
and his treason. As well might the High Priest, and his Servants have condemned
Peter, John and all the rest whose souls abhorred the wickedness. If Judas
proved a vile wretch, yet there was Eleven to one that remained upright: if
Judas proved naught, it was not his profession made him so, but his hypocrisy.
He never learnt it from Christ. If Religion must be charged with all the
miscariages of its Professors, then there is no pure Religion in the world.
Name that Religion among the Professors whereof, there is not one Judas. Take
heed, Reader, of prejudices against godliness on this account. The design of
the Devil without doubt is, to undo thee eternally by them. Woe to the world
because of offenses, Matthew. 18.7. And what if God do permit these things to
fall out, that thou may be hardened in iniquity, confirmed in sin, by such
occasions; and so thy destruction brought about this way? Blessed is he that is
not offended at Christ.

Corollary 9.
Cor. 9.
Did Judas one of the twelve do so? Learn thence, That a drop of grace, is
better than a sea of gifts. Gifts have some excellency in them, but the way of
grace is the more excellent way. 1 Cor. 12.31. Gifts as one says) are dead
graces, but graces are living gifts. There Is many a learned head in Hell. These
are not the things that accompany Salvation. Gifts are the gold that beautifies
the Temple, but grace is as the Temple, which sanctified the gold. One tear,
one groan, one breathing of an upright heart, is more than the tongues of
Angels.

Poor Christian, thou art troubled that thou can not speak and pray so
neatly, so handsomely, as some others can; but can thou go into a corner, and
there pour out thy soul affectionately, though not rhetorically to thy Father?
trouble not thy self. It Is better for thee to feel one divine impression from
God upon thine heart, than to have ten thousand fine notions floating in thy
head. Judas was a man of parts; but what good did they do him?

Corollary 10.
Did the Devil win the consent of Judas to such a design as this? Cor. 10.
Could he get no other hand but the hand of an Apostle to assist him? Learn
hence, That the policy of Satan lies much in the choice of his instruments he
works by. No bird (says one) like a living bird to tempt others into the net.
Cupit abs te ornari Diabolus.
Pelagius, Socinus, etc. were fit persons for that work the Devil put them
upon. Austin told an ingenious young Scholar, the Devil coveted him for an
ornament. He knows he has a foul cause to manage, and therefore will get the
fairest hand he can, to manage it with the less suspicion.

Corollary 11.
Did Judas one of the twelve do this? Cor. 11.
Then certainly Christians may approve, and join with such men on earth, whose
faces they shall never see in Heaven. The Apostles held communion a long time
with this man, and did not suspect him. O please not your selves therefore,
that you have communion with the Saints here, and that they think and speak
charitably of you. All the Churches shall know (says the Lord) that I am he
that searches the heart and reins, and will give to every man as his work
shall be, Rev. 2.23. In Heaven we shall meet many that we never thought to meet
there, and miss many we were confident we should see there.

Corollary 12.
Lastly, Cor. 12.
Did Judas one of the twelve, a man so obliged, raised and honored by Christ,
do this? Cease then from man, be not too confident, but beware of men. Trust ye
not in a friend, put no confidence in a guide, keep the door of thy lips from
her that lies in thy bosom, Mica. 7.5. Not that there is no sincerity in any
man, but because there is so much hypocrisy in many men, and so much
corruption in the best of men, that we may not be too confident, nor lay too
great a stress upon any man. Peter's modest expression of Sylvanus is a pattern
for us. Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you (as I suppose.) 1 Pet. 5.12. The
time shall come says Christ that brother shall betray brother to death. Matthew.
10.11. Your Charity for others may be your duty, but your too great confidence
may be your snare. Fear what others may do, but fear thy self more.

The TWENTY FOURTH Sermon. 24.
SERMON. Opens the enemies second and third preparatives for the death of
Christ, by their illegal trial and condemnation.

LUKE XXIII.XXIII, XXIV. And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that
he might be crucificed; and the voices of them, and of the Chief-Priests
prevailed. And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.


JVdas has made good his promise to the High Priest, and delivered Jesus a
prisoner into their hands. These Wolves of the evening no soonner seize the
Lamb of God, but they thirst and long to be sucking his precious inuocent
blood. Their revenge and malice admits no delay, as fearing a rescue by the
people.

When Herod had taken Peter, In tanta hominium colluvie facile erat concita^i
tumultum, si contra jus, and fas tantum Prophetam trucidari viderat populis.
Par. in Matthew. 26.5.
he committed him to prison, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the
people. Acts 12.4. but these men cannot sleep till they have his blood, and
therefore the preparation of the Passover being come, they resolve in all haste
to destroy him; yet lest it should look like a downright murder, it shall be
formalized with a trial. This his trial and condemnation are the two last acts,
by which they prepared for his death: and are both contained in this context:
in which we may observe, First, The Enditement. Secondly, The Sentence to which
the judge proceeded.

First, The Enditement drawn up against Christ wherein they accuse him of many
things; but can prove nothing. They charge him with sedition, and blasphemy,
but faulter shamefully in the proof. However* what is wanting in evidence,
shall be supplied with clamor and importunity. For says the Text they were
instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their
voices prevailed: when they can neither prove the sedition, or blasphemy, they
charged him with; then crucify him crucify him must serve the turn, instead
of all witnesses and proofs.

Secondly, The Sentence pronounced upon him. Pilate gave sentence that it
should be as they required, (i. e.) he sentenced Christ to be nailed to the
Cross, and there to hang till he was dead. From both these we observe these two
doctrinal conclusions,

Doct. 1. First, That the trial of Christ for his life, was managed most
maliciously and illegally against him, by his unrighteous Judges.

Doct. 2. Secondly, Though nothing could be proved against our Lord Jesus
Christ worthy of death, or of bonds; yet was he condemned to be nailed to the
Cross, and there to hang till he died.

I shall handle these two points distinctly in their order, beginning with the
first, namely,

DOCT. 1. That the trial of Christ for his life, Doct. 1.
was managed most maliciously, and illegally against him, by his unrighteous
Judges.
Reader, here thou may see the Judge of all the world, standing himself to be
judged. He that shall judge the world in righteousness, judged most
unrighteously. He that shall one day come to the throne of judgment attended
with thousands and ten thousands of Angels and Saints, standing as a prisoner
at man's bar, and there denied the common right which a thief or murderer might
claim, and is commonly given them.

To manifest the illegallity of Christ's trial, let the following particulars be
heedfully weighed.

First, That he was inhumanely abused both in words and actions, Luke 22.54.
and there they that held him, mocked him, and smote him, blindfolded him,
stroke him on the face, and bid him prophecy who smote him: and many other
things blasphemously spoke they against him, verse. 63, 64, 65. how illegal and
barbarous a thing was this? When they were but binding Paul with thongs, he
thought himself abused contrary to law, and asked the Centurion that stood by,
is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned, q. d.
is this legal? What, punish a man first, and judge him afterward! But Christ
was not only bound, but horribly abused by them, all that night, dealing with
him as the Lords of the Philistines did with Sampson, to whom it was a sport to
abuse him. No rest had Jesus that night: no more sleep for him now in this
world. O it was a sad night to him. And this under Caiphas's own roof.

Secondly, As he was inhumanely abused before he was tried; as soon as it was
day, the elders of the people, and the Chief-Priests, and the Scribes came
together; and led him into their Council: This was the Ecclesiastical Court. The
great Sanhedrim which according to its first constitution, should consist of
seventy grave, honorable, and learned men: to whom were to be referred all
doubtful matters, too hard for inferior Courts to decide. And these were to
Judge impartially and uprightly for God, as men in whom was the Spirit of God.
According to Gods counsel to Moses, Numb. 11.16, etc. In this Court the
Righteous and innocent might expect relief and protection. And that is
conceived to be the meaning of Christ's words, Luke 13.33. It cannot be that a
Prophet perish out of Jerusalem; that is, their Righteousness and Innocence may
expect protection. But now, contrary to the first constitution, it consisted of
a pack fo malicious Scribes and Pharisees; men full of revenge, malice and all
unrighteousness: And over these Caiphas (a head fit for such a body) at this
time precided. And though there was still some face of a Court among them, yet
their power was now abridged by the Romans; that they could not hear and
determine, judge, and condemn in Capital matters as formery. For as Josephus
their own Historian informs us; Herod in the beginning of his reign took away
this power from them; Ios^phus his Antiq. lib. 14. cap. 17.
and that Scripture seems to confirm it, Joh. 18.31. It is not lawful for us to
put any man to death: And therefore they bring him to Pilates Bar. He also
understood him to be a Galilean, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galilee, and at
that time in Jerusalem, he is sent to him; and by him remitted to Pilate.

Thirdly, As he was at first heard and judged by a Court that had no authority
to Judge him; so when he stood at Pilates bar, he was accused of perverting the
Nation and denying tribute to Caesar, than which nothing was more notoriously
false. For as all his Doctrine was pure and heavenly, and malice it self could
not find a flaw in it: so he was always observant of the Laws under which he
lived, and scrupulous of giving the least just offense to the civil powers.
Yea, he not only paid the Tribute himself, though he might have pleaded
exemption, but charged it upon others as their duty so to do, Matthew. 22.24.
give unto Caesar, the things that are Caesar's: and yet with such palpable
untruths is Christ charged.

Fourthly, Yea, and what is most abominable, and unparalled; to compass their
malicious designs, they industriously labor to suborn false witnesses to take
away his life: not sticking at the grossest perjury, and manifest injustice, so
they might destroy him. So you read, Matthew. 25.59. Now the Chief-Priests and
Elders, and all the council sought salse witnesses against Jesus, to put him to
death. Abominable wickedness! For such men, and so many, to complot to shed the
blood of the innocent, by known and studied perjury! What will not malice
against Christ transport men to?

Fifthly, Moreover, the carriage of the Court was most insolent, and base
toward him during the trial. For whilst he stood before them as a prisoner yet
uncondemned; sometimes they are angry at him for his silence, and when he
speaks, and that pertinently to the point; they smite him on the mouth for
speaking, and scoff at what he speaks. To some of their light frivolous and
ensnaring questions he is silent, not for want of an answer, but because he
heard nothing worthy of an answer. And to fulfill what the Prophet Isaiah had
long before predicted of him: Quia indignam responso judicat manifestam
falsitatem. Non defensione destitutus, sed ut impleretur prophetae oracul^m.
Par.
he was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. He is
brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb,
so he opened not his mouth. Isai. 53.7. as also to leave us a president when to
speak, and when to be silent; when we for his name sake, shall be brought
before Governors: for such reasons as these he sometimes answers not a word,
and then they are ready to condemn him for a mute. Answerest thou nothing
(says the High Priest) what is it that these witness against thee, Matthew.
26.62. hear thou not how many things they witness against thee, says
Pilate? Matthew. 27.13.

And when he makes his defense in words of truth and soberness, they smite him
for speaking. Jo^. 18.22. And when he had thus spoken, one of the Officers
which stood by, stroke Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, answerest thou
the High Priest so? And what had he spoken to exasperate them? Had he spoken
impertinently? Not at all. What he said was but this, when they would have had
him ensnare himself with his own lips, Jesus answered, I spoke openly in the
world, I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple whither the Jews
always resort, and in secret have I said nothing. Why ask thou me, ask them
that heard me, behold they know what I said? q. d. I am not obliged to accuse
and ensnare my self, but you ought to proceed secundum allegata, and probata,
according to what is alleged and proved. Did he deserve a blow on his mouth
for this? O who but himself could have so patiently digested such abuses! under
all this he stands in perfect innocence and patience, making no other return to
that wretch that smote him but this, if I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?

Sixthly, Lastly, To instance in no more. He is condemned to they urge Pilate
to proceed to sentence him; why faith he what evil has he done? Matthew. 27.23.
nay in the preface to the very sentence it self, he acknowledges him to be a
just person. Matthew. 27.24. When Pilate saw he could prevail nothing, but that
rather a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands before the
multitude, and said, I am innocent of the blood of this just person, see ye to
it. Here the innocence of Christ brake out like the Sun wading out of a cloud,
convincing the conscience of his Judge that he was just; and yet he must give
sentence on him for all that, to please the people.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Was Christ thus used when he stood before the great Council, the Scribes and
Elders of Israel? then surely great men are not always wise, neither do the
aged understand Judgment. Job. 32.9. Here were many great men, many aged men,
many politic men in Council; but not one wise or good man among them. In this
Council were men of parts, and learning, men of great abilities, and by so much
the more pernicious, and able to do mischief. Wickedness in a great man, in a
learned man, is like poison given in wine, which is the more operative and
deadly. Christ's greatest enemies were such as these. Heathen Pilate, had more
pity for him, than superstitious Caiphas. Luther tells us, that his greatest
adversaries did not rise out of the Alehouses or Brothel-houses; but out of
Monasteries, Convents and Religious-houses.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Hence also we learn, That though we are not obliged to answer every captious,
idle, or ensnaring question; yet we are bound faithfully to own and confess the
truth when we are solemnly called thereunto.

It Is true, Christ was sometimes silent; and as a deaf man that heard not, but
when the question was solemnly put art thou the Christ? The Son of the Blessed?
Jesus said I am, Mark. 14.61, 62. He knew that answer would cost his life, and
yet he dare not deny it. On this account the Apostle says he witnessed a good
confession before Pontius Pilate, I Tim. 6.13. Herein Christ has ruled out the
way of our duty, and by his own example, as well as precept obliged us to a
sincere confession of him, and his truth, when we are required lawfully so to
do; (i. e.) when we are before a lawful Magistrate, and the questions are not
curious or captious; when we cannot hold our peace, but our silence will be
interpretatively a denying of the truth; finally, when the glory of God, honor
of his truth, and edification of others is more attainable by our open
confession, than it can be by our silence: then must we with Christ, give
direct, plain, and sincere answers.

It was the old Priscilian error to allow men to deny or dissemble their
profession; Quas non oportet mortes prae^legere? quod non supplicium potius
far. Ino in quam prefundam inferni abyssam non intrare: quam contra
conscientiam altestare. Zuing.
when an open confession would infer danger. But you know what Christ has
said, Matthew. 10.33. Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny before
my Father, which is in Heaven. Christ will repay him in his own coin. It was a
noble saying of courageous Zuinglius, what deaths would I not choose? What
punishment would I not undergo? Yea, into what vault of Hell; would I not
rather choose to be thrown, than to witness against my Conscience. Truth can
never be bought dear, nor sold cheap. The Lord Jesus you see owns truth with
the eminent and instant hazard of his life. The whole cloud of witnesses have
followed him therein. Revel. 14.1. we our selves once openly owned the ways of
sin. And shall we not do as much for Christ, as we then did for the Devil? Did
we then glory in our shame, and shall we now be ashamed of our glory? Do not we
hope Christ will own us at the great day! Why, if we confess him, he also will
confess us. O possess your thoughts with the reasonableness of this duty.

Inference 3.
Once more, Infer. 3.
hence it follows, That to bear the revilings, contradictions and abuses of
men, with a meek, composed and even spirit, is excellent and Christ like. He
stood before them as a Lamb; he rendered not railing for railing; he endured the
contradictions of sinners against himself. Imitate Christ in his meekness. He
calls you so to do, Matthew. 11.28. This will be convincing to your enemies,
comfortable for your selves, and honorable for Religion. And as for your
innocence God will clear it up as Christ's was.

You have heard the illegal trial of Christ, how insolently it was managed
against him, well right or wrong, innocent or guilty, his blood is resolved
upon. It Is bought and sold before hand. And if nothing else will do it, menaces
and clamours shall constrain Pilate to condemn him. Whence our second note was,

DOCT. 2. That though nothing could be proved against our Lord Jesus Christ,
Doct. 2.
worthy of death, or of bonds; yet was he condemned to be nailed to the Cross,
and there to hang till he died.
For the explication of this, I shall open the following particulars. First,
Who gave the Sentence. Secondly, Upon whom he gave it. Thirdly, What Sentence
was it that was given. Fourthly, In what manner Christ received it.

First, Who and what was he that durst attempt such a thing as this? Why, this
was Pilate who succeeded Valerius Gratus in the Presidentship of Judea,
Josephus lib. 18. A^t Iudaea quarto ad cap. 7.
(as Josephus tells us,) in which trust he continued about ten years. This
cruel cursed act of his against Christ, was in the eighth year of his
government. Two years after he was removed from his place and Office, by
Vitelius President of Syria, for his inhumane murdering of the innocent
Samaritans. This necessitated him to go to Rome, to clear himself before
Caesar. But before he came to Rome, Tyberius was dead, and Cajus in his room.
Eusebius Histo. Eccl^s. lib. 3. cap. 7.

Non admodum amicus Iudaeorum genti propterea quod eam suspecta^ haberet animo
erga Casarem hunc putant sacerdotes commodum fore ipsorum proposito, etc. Bucer
in Mat. 27. Audito Filii Dei nomine men's ejus Religione tacta fuerat, metu
numinis perculsus, inter sacrum (ut aiunt) and saxum haerebat. Marlor. in Loc.


Under him, says Eusebius, Pilate killed himself. He was a man not very
friendly or benevolent to the Jewish nation, but still suspicious of their
rebellions and insurrections, this jealous humor, the Priests and Scribes
observed, and wrought upon it, to compass their design against Christ.
Therefore they tell him so often, of Christ's sedition, and stirring up the
people; and that if he let him go, he is none of Caesar's friend; which were the
very considerations that prevailed with him to do what he did. But how durst he
attempt such a wickedness as this, however he had stood in the opinion of
Caesar? What I give Judgment against the Son of God; for it is evident by many
circumstances in this trial that he had many inward fears, and convictions upon
him, that he was the Son of God. By these he was scared and sought to release
him, Ioh. 19.8, 12. the fear of a Deity fell upon him; his mind was greatly
perplexed, and dubious about this prisoner, whether he was a God or a man. And
yet the fear of Caesar prevailed more than the fear of a Deity, he proceeds to
give sentence.

O Pilate wast thou not afraid to Judge and Sentence an Innocent, a known
Innocent, and one whom thou thy self suspectedst at least to be more than man?
But see in this predominancy of self-interest, what men will not attempt and
perpetrate to secure and accommodate self.

Secondly, against whom does Pilate give Sentence? against a Pilates ears, even
the wonderful things wrought by him, which none but God could do. One that
stood before him as the picture, or rather as the body of innocence and
meekness. Ye have condemned, and killed the Just, and he resists you not,
James 5.6. now was that word made good, Psalm. 94.21. They gather themselves
together, against the soul of the Righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

Thirdly, But what was the sentence that Pilate gave? We have I adjudge Jesus
of Nazareth to be nailed to the Cross, and there to hang til he be dead. Which
sentence against Christ was, First, A most unjust, and unrighteous sentence,
the greatest perversion of Judgment and Equity that was ever known to the
civilized world, since seats of Judicature were first set up. What! to condemn
him, before one accusation was proved against him? And if what they accused him
of (that he said he was the Son of God) had been proved, it had been no crime,
for he really was so; and therefore no blasphemy in him to say he was. Pilate
should rather have come down from his seat of Judgment and adore him, that sit
there to judge him. Oh it was the highest piece of injustice that ever our ears
heard of. Secondly, As it was an unrighteous sentence, so it was a cruel
sentence, delivering up Christ to their wills. This was that misery which David
so earnestly deprecated, Psalm. 27.12. O deliver me not over to the will of mine
enemies. But Pilate delivers Christ over to the will of his enemies; men full
of enmity, rage, and malice: whose greatest pleasure it was, to glut themselves
with his blood, and satiate their revengeful hearts with such a spectacle of
misery. For lo, as soon as these Wolves had griped their prey, they were not
satisfied with that cursed, cruel and ignominious death of the Cross, to which
Pilate had adjudged him; but they are resolved he shall die over and over: they
will contrive many deaths in one: Now they say as a Tyrant did once, moriatur,
ut sentiat se mori, let him die so as he may feel himself to die, (i. e.) let
him die by inch-meal. To this end they presently strip him naked, scourge him
cruelly, array him in scarlet, and mock him: Crown him with a bush of platted
thorns: fasten that Crown upon his head by a blow with a cane, which set them
deep into his sacred Temples: Sceptered him with a reed: spet in his face:
strip off his mock-robes again: put the Cross upon his back, and compel him to
bear it. All this, and much more they express their cruelty by; as soon as they
had him delivered over to their will. So that this was a cruel sentence.
Thirdly, As it was a cruel, so it was a rash and hasty sentence. The Jews are
all in haste: consulting all night, and early up by the break of day in the
morning to get him to his trial. They spur on Pilate with all the arguments
they can to give sentence. His trial took up but one morning, and a great part
of that was spent in sending him from Caiphas to Pilate, and from Pilate to
Herod, and then back again to Pilate: so that it was a hasty and headlong
sentence that Pilate gave. He did not sift and examine the matter, but handles
it very slightly. The trial of many a mean man has taken up ten times more
debates and time, than was spent about Christ. Qui ad pa^ea recipient, facile
pronuntiant.
They that look but slightly into the cause, easily pronounce and give
sentence. But that which was then done in haste, they have had time enough to
repent for since. Fourthly, As it was a rash and hasty, so it was an extorted
forced sentence. They squeeze it out of Pilate by mere clamor, importunity, and
suggestions of danger. In Courts of Judicature, such arguments should signify
but little: Minaciter extorquent ab eo, ut Christum damnet. Calv.
not importunity, but proof should carry it: but timorous Pilate bends like a
Willow at this breath of the people. He had neither such a sense of Justice,
nor spirit of Courage to withstand it. Fifthly, As it was an extorted, so it
was an Hypocritical sentence; masking horrid murder under a pretense and
formality of Law. It must look like a legal procedure to paliate the business.
Loath he was to condemn him, lest innocent blood should clamor in his
Conscience; but since he must do it, he will transfer the guilt upon them, and
they take it: His blood be on us and on our children for ever, say they. Pilate
calls for water, washes his hands before them, and tells them I am free from
the blood of this just person. But stay, free from his blood, and yet condemn a
known innocent person. Free from his blood, because he washed his hands in
water. No, no, he could never be free, except his soul had been washed in that
blood he shed. O the hypocrisy of Pilate! Such juggling as this will not serve
his turn, when he shall stand as a prisoner before him, who now stood arraigned
at his Bar. Sixthly and Lastly, As it was an Hypocritical, so it was an
unrevoked sentence. It admitted not of a reprieve, no, not for a day; nor does
Christ appeal to any other Judicature, or once desire the least delay of the
execution. But away he is hurried in haste to the execution.


Blush, O ye heavens! and tremble, O earth, at such a sentence as this! Now is
Christ dead in Law; now he knows whither he must be carried, and that
presently. His soul and body must feel that, the very sight of which put him
into an Agony but the night before.

Fourthly and Lastly, In what manner did Christ receive this cruel Ye have
condemned, and killed the just, and he resists you not. From the time that
Pilate gave sentence, till he was nailed to the Cross, we do not read that ever
he said any thing, save only to the women that followed him out of the City to
Golgotha: and what he said there, rather manifested his pity to them, than any
discontent at what was now come upon him. Daughters of Jerusalem (said he) weep
not for me, but weep for your selves and for your children, Luke 23.28, etc. O
the perfect patience and meekness of Christ! The Inferences from hence are.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Do you see what was here done against Christ under pretense of Law? What cause
have we to pray for good Laws, and righteous executioners of them.

O it is a singular mercy to live under good Laws, which protect the innocent
from injury. Laws are hedges about our lives, liberties, estates, and all the
comforts we enjoy in this world. Times will be evil enough, when iniquity is
most discountenanced and punished by Law; but how evil are those times like to
prove, when iniquity is established by Law! As the Psalmist complains, Psalm.
94.20. Olim cri ninibus, jan legibus laboratur. Et metuendum est me respublica
legibus fundata, sit Legibus eversa. Plini ad Trajan.
It was the complaint of Pliny to Trajan, that whereas crimes were wont to be
the burden of the age, now Laws were so; and that he feared the Commonwealth
which was established, would be subverted by Laws. It Is not like that virtue
will much flourish, when Judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the
field, Hosea 10.4. How much therefore is it our concernment, to pray that
Judgment may run down as a mighty stream, Amos. 5.24. That our Officers may be
peace, and our Exactors righteousness, Isai. 60.17. It was not therefore
without great reason, that the Apostle exhorted, that supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. For Kings and all that
are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness
and honesty, 1 Timothy 2.1, 2. Great is the interest of the Church of God in them.
They are instruments of much good or evil.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Was Christ condemned in a Court of Judicature? How evident then is it, that
there is a Judgment to come after this life? Surely things will not be always
carried as they are in this world. When you see Jesus condemned, and Barrabbas
released, conclude, that a time will come when innocence shall be vindicated,
and wickedness shamed. On this very ground Solomon concludes, and very
rationally, that God will call over things hereafter at a more righteous
Tribunal. And moreover I saw under the Sun the place of Judgment, that
wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous, and the wicked: for there is
a time there for every purpose, and for every work, Eccles. 3.16, 17. Some
indeed on this ground have denied the divine providence; but Solomon draws a
quite contrary conclusion, God shall Judge: surely he will take the matter into
his own hand: he will bring forth the righteousness of his people as the light,
and their just dealing as the noon day.

It Is a mercy if we be wronged in one Court, that we can appeal to another,
where we shall be sure to be relieved by a just impartial Judge. Be patient
therefore my brethren, (says the Apostle) until the coming of the Lord. Jam.
5.6, 7, 8.

Inference 3.
Again, Infer. 3.
here you see how Conscience may be overborn, and run down by a fleshly
interest. Pilates Conscience bid him beware, and forbear; his interest bid him
act: his fear of Caesar, was more than the fear of God. But oh! what a dreadful
thing is it for Conscience to be ensnared by the fear of man? Prove. 29.25. To
guard thy soul, Reader, against this mischief, let such considerations as these
be ever with thee.

First, Consider how dear those profits or pleasures cost, which are purchased
with the loss of inward peace! there is nothing in this word good enough to
recompense such a loss; or balance the misery of a tormenting Conscience. If
you violate it, and prostitute it for a fleshly lust, it will remember the
injury you did it many years after. Genesis 42.21. Job. 13.26. It will not only
retain the memory of what you did, but it will accuse you for it. Matthew. 27.4.
It will not fear to tell you that plainly which others dare not whisper. It
will not only accuse, but it will also condemn you for what you have done. This
condemning voice of Conscience is a very terrible voice.

You may see the horror of it in Cain; the vigor of it in Judas; the doleful
effects of it in Spira. It will from all these its offices produce shame, fear,
and despair, if God give not repentance to life. The shame it works will so
confound you, that you will not be able to look up. Job. 31.14. Psalm. 1.5. The
fear it works will make you wish for a hole in the rock to hide you: Isai. 2.9,
10, 15, 19. And its despair is a death pang. The cutting off of hope is the
greatest cut in the world. O who can stand under such a load as this? Prove.
18.14.

Secondly, Consider the nature of your present actions; they are seed sown for
eternity, and will spring up again in suitable effects, rewards or punishments;
when you that did them are turned to dust. Gal. 6.7. what a man sows, that
shall he reap: and as sure as the harvest follows the seed time, so sure shall
shame, fear, and horror follow sin, Dan. 12.2. What Zeuxis the famous Limner
said of his work, may much more truly be said of ours, eternitati pingo, I
paint for eternity said he, when one asked him why he was so curious in his
work. Ah, how bitter will those things be in the account and reckoning, which
were pleasant in the acting and committing! It Is true our actions physically
considered are transient; how soon is a word or action spoken or done, and
there is an end of it: but morally considered, they are permanent, being put
upon Gods book of account. O therefore take heed what you do. So speak, and so
act, as they that must give an account.

Thirdly, Consider how by these things men do but prepare for their own torment
in a dying hour. There Is bitterness enough in death; you need not add more gall
and wormwood, to add to the bitterness of it. What is the violencing, and
wounding of Conscience now, but the sticking so many pins or needles in your
deathbed, against you come to lie down on it: this makes death bitter indeed.
How many have wished in a dying hour they had rather lived poor and low all
their days, than to have strained their Consciences for the world? Ah how is
the face, and aspect of things altered in such an hour!

No such considerations as these had any place in Pilates heart; for if so, he
would never have been courted, or scared into such an act as this.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Did Christ stand arraigned, and condemned at Pilates Bar; then the believer
shall never be arraigned or condemned at Gods Bar. This sentence that Pilate
pronounced on Christ, gives evidence that God will never pronounce sentence
against such. For had he intended to have arraigned them, he would never have
suffered Christ their surety to be arraigned, and condemned for them. Christ
stood at this time before a higher Judge than Pilate. He stood at Gods Bar, as
well as his. Pilate did but that which Gods own hand and Counsel had before
determined to be done. And what God himself at the same time^ did. Though God
did it Justly and Holily, dealing with Christ, as a Creditor with a Surety.
Pilate most wickedly, and basely, dealing with Christ as a corrupt Judge, that
shed the blood of a known innocent to pacify the people. But certain it is
that out of his Condemnation flows our Justification. And had not Sentence been
given against him, it must have been given against us.

Oh what a melting consideration is this! that out of his agony comes our
Victory; out of his condemnation our Justification; out of his Pain our Ease;
out of his Stripes our Healing; out of his Gall and Vinegar our Honey; out of
his Curse our Blessing; out of his Crown of Thorns our Crown of Glory; out of
his Death our Life: if he could not be released, it was that you might. If
Pilate gave sentence against him, it was that the great God might never give
sentence against you. If he yielded that it should be with Christ as they
required, it was that it might be with our souls, as well as we can desire. And
therefore,

Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
Sermon. 25.
The TWENTY FIFTH SERMON. Remarks a memorable passage of Christ in his way to
the place of his execution.

LUKE XXIII.XXVII, XXVIII, etc. And there followed him a great company of
people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning
unto them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your
selves, and for your children.


THE sentence of death once given against Christ, the execution quickly
follows. Away they lead him from Gabbatha to Golgotha, longing as much to be
nailing him to the Cross, and feeding their eyes with his torments, as the
Eagle does to be tearing the flesh, and drinking the blood of that Lamb she
has seized in her Tallons, and is carrying away to the top of some rock to
devour.

The Evangelist here observes a memorable passage that fell out in their way to
the place of execution; and that is the Lamentations and Wailings of some that
followed him out of the City, who expressed their pity, and sorrow for him most
tenderly, and compassionately. All hearts were not hard, all eyes were not dry.
There followed him a great company of people, and of women which also bewailed,
and lamented him, etc.

In this Paragraph we have two parts ( viz.) the Lamentation of the Daughters
of Jerusalem for Christ, and Christ's reply to them.

First, The Lamentation of the Daughters of Jerusalem for

First, (...) i. e. mu^^ res hierosoymitanae. He^^raismus. Sic fii^ae Tsiionis.
Piscat in L^c.
Who they were? The text calls them Daughters (i. e.) Inhabitants of Jerusalem.
For it is an Hebraism as Daughters of Zion, Daughters of Israel. And it is like
the greatest part of them were women: and they were many of them; a troop of
mourners that followed Christ out of the City, toward the place of his
execution, with Lamentations and Wailings. What the principle and ground of
these their Lamentations was, is not agreed upon by those that have pondred the
story. Mr. Anth Burges, spiritual refi^e^ng. 120.
Some are of opinion, their Tears and Lamentations, were but the effects and
fruits of their more tender and ingenious natures: which were moved and melted
with so tragical and sad a spectacle, Dr. Tho. Goodwin in his Triumph of faith.
p. 38.
as was now before them. It Is well observed by a judicious Author, that the
Tragical story of some great and noble personage, full of hero'cal virtue and
ingenuity (yet inhumanely and ungratefully used) will thus work upon ingenious
spirits who read or hear of it -- which when it reaches no higher is so far
from being faith, that it is but a carnal and fleshly devotion, springing from
fancy, which is pleased with such a story and the principles of ingenuity
stirred toward one, who is of a Noble Spirit and yet abused. Such stories use
to stir up a principle of humanity in men unto a compassionate love, which
Christ himself at his suffering found fault with, as being not spiritual nor
raised enough in those women that went weeping to see the Messiah so handled.
Weep not for me (says he) that is, weep not so much for this to see me so
unworthily handled by those for whom I die. This is the principle from which
some conceive these tears to flow.

Videmus quosdam no^ fuisse oblitos doctrina and miraculorum Christi. Sic in
misera illa dissipatione exiguas sibi reliquias servavit De^s. Quamvia a^tem
imbecilla fuit istarum muli^rum fide, credibile tame^ est, occultum fuisse
pietatis sem^n, unde postea germen produ^t. Calv.
But Calvin attributes it to their faith; looking upon these mourners as a
remnant reserved by the Lord in that miserable dispersion; and though their
faith was but weak, yet they judge it credible that there was a secret seed of
godliness in them, which afterward grew to maturity, and brought forth fruit.
And to the same sense others give their opinion also.

Secondly, Let us consider Christ's reply to them; Weep not for me ye Daughters
of Jerusalem, etc. Strange, that Christ should forbid them to weep for him, yea
for him under such unparalleled sufferings and miseries. If ever there was a
heart-melting object in the world, it was here. O who could hold, whose heart
was not petrified, and more obdure than the senseless rocks! This reply
therefore of Christ undergoes a double sense, and interpretation, suitable to
the different construction of their sorrows. Those that look upon their sorrows
as merely natural, take Christ's reply in a negative sense, prohibiting such
tears as those. They that expound their sorrows as the fruit of faith, tell us
though the form of Christ's expression be negative, yet the sense is
comparative, as Matthew. 9.13. I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, (i. e.)
mercy rather than sacrifice. So here weep rather upon your own account, than
mine. Reserve your sorrows for the calamities coming upon your selves and your
children. You are greatly affected I see with the misery that is upon me; but
mine will be quickly over, yours will lie long. In which he shows his merciful
and compassionate disposition, who was still more mindful of others troubles
and burdens than of his own.

And indeed the days of calamity coming upon them and their children, were
doleful days. What direful and unpresidented miseries befell them, at the
breaking up and devastation of the City, who has not read or heard? And who
can refrain from tears that hears or reads it?

Now, if we take the words in the first sense, as a prohibition of their merely
natural and carnal affections, expressed in Tears and Lamentations for him; no
otherwise than they would have been upon any other like Tragical story: then
the observation from it, will be this.

Doct. 1. That melting affections and sorrows, even from the sense and
consideration of the sufferings of Christ; are no infallible signs of grace.

If you take it in the latter sense, as the fruit of their faith, as tears
flowing from a gracious principle: then the observation will be this.

Doct. 2. That the believing meditation of what Christ suffered for us, is of
great force and efficacy to melt and break the heart.

I shall rather choose to prosecute both these branches, than to decide the
controversy. Especially since the notes, gathered from either, are so useful
to us. And therefore I shall begin with the first, viz.

DOCT. 1. That melting affections and sorrows, Doct. 1.
even from the sense of Christ's sufferings, are no infallible marks of grace.
In this point I have two things to do, to prepare it for use.

First, To show what the melting of the affections by way of grief and sorrow
is. Secondly, That they may be so melted, even upon the account of Christ; and
yet the heart remain unrenewed.
First, What the melting of the affections by way of grief and

Tears are nothing else but the juice of a mind oppressed, and squeesed with
grief. Grief compresses the heart, the heart so compressed and squeezed, vents
it self sometimes in tears, sighs, groans, etc. and this is two fold; gracious
and wholly supernatural, or common and altogether natural. The gracious melting
or sorrow of the soul, is likewise two fold, habitual or actual. Habitual godly
sorrow, is that gracious disposition, inclination or tendency of the renewed
heart to mourn and melt, when any just occasion is presented to the soul, that
calls for such sorrow. It is expressed, Ezekiel. 36.26. By taking away the heart
of stone, and giving an heart of flesh. That is an heart impressive, and
yielding to such arguments and considerations as move it to mourning.

Actual sorrow is the expression and manifestation of that its inclination,
upon just occasions, and it is expressed two ways, either by the internal
effects of it; which are the heaviness, shame, loathing, resolution, and holy
revenge begotten in the soul upon the account of sin: or also by more external
and visible effects, as sighs, groans, tears, etc. The former is essential to
godly sorrow, the latter contingent, and accidental. Much depending upon the
natural temperature, and constitution of the body.

Natural and common meltings, are nothing else but the effects of a better
temper; the fruit of a more ingenious spirit, and easier constitution, which
shows it self on any other, as well as upon spiritual occasions.

As Austin said, he could weep plentifully, when he read the story of Dido. The
history of Christ is a very tragical and pathetical history, and may melt an
ingenious nature, where there is no renewed principle at all. So that,

Secondly, Our affections may be melted, even upon the score and account of
Christ; and yet that is no infallible evidence of a gracious heart. And the
reasons for it are, The first Reason, because we find all sorts of affections
acted and vented, by such as have been no better than temporary believers. The
stony ground hearers in Matthew. 13.20. received the word with joy: and so did
John's hearers also, who for a season re^oyced in his light, Joh. 3.35. Now if
the affection of joy under the word may be exercised, why not of sorrow also?
If the comfortable things revealed in the Gospel may stir up the one, by a
parity of reason, the sad things it reveals, may answerably work upon the
other. Even those Israelites whom Moses told that they should fall by the
sword, and not prosper, for the Lord would not be with them; because they were
turned away from the Lord; yet when Moses rehearsed the message of the Lord in
their ears, they mourned greatly. Numb. 14.39. I know the Lord pardoned too
many of them their iniquites, though he took vengeance on their inventions; and
yet it is as true, that with many of them God was not well pleased, 1 Cor. 10.5.
Many instances of their weeping and mourning before the Lord, we find in the
sacred story: and yet their hearts were not steadfast with God. The second
Reason is, because though the objects, about which our affections and passions
are moved, may be spiritual; yet the motives and principles that set them on
work, may be but carnal, and natural ones. When I see a person affected in the
hearing of the word, or prayer; even unto tears* I cannot presently conclude,
surely this is the effect of grace. For it is possible the pathetical qual^ty of
the subject matter, the rhetoric of the speaker, the very* affecting tone, and
modulation of the voice, may draw tears; as well as faith working upon the
spirituality, and deep concernment the soul has in those things.

Whilst Austin was a Manichee, he sometimes heard Ambrose, and says he, I was
greatly affected in hearing him even unto tears, many times; howbeit, it was
not the Heavenly nature of the subject, but the abilities and rare parts of the
speaker that so affected him. And this was the case of Ezekiels hearers, Ezekiel.
33.32. Again,

The third Reason is, these motions of the affections, may rather be a fit and
mood, than the very frame and temper of the soul. Now there is a vast
difference betwixt these. Illa ta^tum dicuntur in esse a^ima, quae in sun per
^^aum q^iet^.
There are times and seasons when the roughest, and most obdure hearts may be
pensive and tender; but that is not its temper and frame, but only a fit, a
pang, a transient passion: so the Lord complains of them. Hos. 6.4. O Ephraim,
what shall I do unto thee, O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your
goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew, it goes away: and so he
complains, Psalm. 78.34, 35, 36. When he slew them, then they sought him; and
they returned, and enquired early after God. And they remembered that God was
their rock, and the most high God their Redeemer; nevertheless they did flatter
him with their lips, and lied unto him with their tongues. For had this been
the gracious temper of their souls, it would have continued with them: they
would not have been up and down, off and on, hot and cold with God, as they
were. Therefore we conclude that we cannot infer a work of grace upon the
heart, simply and merely from the meltings and thaws that are sometimes upon
it. And hence for your use I shall Infer that.


Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
If such as sometimes feel their hearts thawed and melted with the consideration
of the sufferings of Christ, may yet be deceived. What cause have they to fear,
and tremble: whose hearts are as unrelenting as the Rocks! Yielding to nothing
that is proposed, or urged upon them? How many such are there, of whom we may
say as Christ speaks of the inflexible Jews: We have Piped unto you, but ye
have not Danced. We have mourned unto you, but ye have not lamented, Matthew.
11.17. They must inevitably come short of Heaven, that come so short of those,
that do come short of Heaven. If those perish that have rejoiced under the
Promises; and mourned under the threats of the Word. What shall become of them
that are as unconcerned and untouched by what they hear, as the Seats they sit
on, or the dead that lie under their feet! Who are given up to such hardness of
heart, that nothing can touch or affect them. One would think the consideration
of the sixth Chapter to the Hebrews should startle such men and women; and make
them cry out, Lord, what will become of such a senseless, stupid, dead creature
as I am? If they that have been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift;
and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost; and have tasted the good Word of
God, and the powers of the world to come, may, notwithstanding such high raised
affections as these, so fall away, that it shall be impossible to receive them
again by Repentance: what shall we then say or think of his Estate, to whom the
most penetrating and awakening truths are no more than a Tale that is told? The
Fire and Hammer of the Gospel can neither melt nor break them, they are Iron,
and Brass, Ier. 6.28.29.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
If such as these may eternally miscarry, Then let all look carefully to their
foundation, and see that they do not bless themselves in a thing of naught.
Gal. 6 3.4. John 8 54 Rom 2.18.19.21 Mat. 25.11.12 Mat. 7.22.
It Is manifest from 1 Cor. 10.12. That many souls stand exceeding dangerously,
who are yet strongly conceited of their own safety. And if you please to
consult those Scriptures in the margent, you shall find vain confidence to be a
ruling folly over the greatest part of men: and that which is the utter
overthrow, and undoing of multitudes of Professors.

Now, there is nothing more apt to beget and breed this vain soul undoing
confidence, than the stirrings and meltings of our affections about spiritual
things, whilst the heart remains unrenewed all the while. Mr. An. Burg.
For (as a grave Divine has well observed) such a man seems to have all that
is required of a Christian, and herein to have attained the very end of all
knowledge; which is operation and influence upon the heart and affections.

Indeed (thinks such a poor deluded soul,) if I did hear, read, or pray without
any inward affections, with a dead, cold, and unconcerned heart: or if I did
make show of Zeal, and affection in dutys, and had it not* well might I suspect
my self to be a self-cozening Hypocrite: but its not so with me. I feel my
heart really melted many times, when I read the sufferings of Christ. I feel my
heart raised, and ravished with strange Joys and comforts, when I hear the
glory of Heaven opened in the Gospel.

Indeed if it were not so with me, I might doubt the root of the matter is
wanting. But if to my knowledge, affection be added. A melting heart, matched
with a knowing head; now I may be confident all is well. I have often heard
Ministers cautioning and warning their people, not to rest satisfied with idle
and unpractical notions in their understandings; but to labor for impressions
upon their hearts, this I have attained; and therefore what danger of me?

I have often heard it given as the mark of an Hypocrite, that he has light in
his head; but it sheds not down its influences upon the heart. Whereas in those
that are sincere, it works on their hearts and affections. So I find it with
me, therefore I am in a most safe estate.

O Soul, of all the false signs of grace, none more dangerous, than those that
most resemble true ones. And never does the Devil more surely and incurably
destroy, than when transformed into an Angel of light. What if these meltings
of thy heart, be but a flower of nature? What if thou art more beholding to a
good temper of body, than a gracious change of spirit for these things? Well,
so it may be. Therefore be not secure, but fear and watch. Possibly if thou
would but search thine own heart in this matter, thou may find, that any
other pathetical moving story, will have the like effects upon thee. Possibly
too, thou may find that notwithstanding all thy raptures and joys at the
hearing of Heaven, and its glory; yet after that pang is over, thy heart is
habitually earthly, and thy conversation is not there.

For all thou can mourn at the relations of Christ's Sufferings, thou art not
so affected with sin, that was the meritorious cause of the sufferings of
Christ; as to crucify one corruption, or deny the next temptation, or part
with any way of sin that is gainful, or pleasurable to thee for his sake.

Why now, Reader, if it be so with thee, what art thou the better f^r the
fluency of thy affections? Do think in earnest, that Christ has the better
thoughts of thee; because thou can shed tears for him; when notwithstanding
thou every day piercest and woundest him? O be not deceived. Nay for ought I
know, thou may find upon a narrow search; that thou put thy tears in the
room of Christ's blood, and give the confidence, and dependence of thy soul to
them; and if so, they shall never do thee any good.

Oh therefore search thy heart, Reader, be not too confident; take not up too
easily, upon such poor weak grounds as these, a soul undoing confidence. Always
remember, the Wheat and Tares r^semble each other in their first springing up.
That an Egg is not liker to an Egg, than Hypocrisy, in some shapes and forms
into which it can cast it self, is like a genuine work of grace. O remember
that among the Ten Virgins, that is, the reformed professors of Religion; that
have cast off and separated themselves from the worship and defilements of
Antichrist: five of them were foolish.

There be first, that shall be last; and last, that shall be first, Matthew.
19.30. Great is the deceitfulness of our hearts, Ier. 17.9. And many are the
subtilties and devices of Satan, 2 Cor. 11.3. Many also are the astonishing
examples of self deceiving souls, recorded in the Word.

Remember what you lately read of Judas. Great also will be the exactness of
the Last Judgment. And how confident soever you be, that you shall speed well
in that day; yet still remember, that Trial is not yet past. Your final
Sentence is not yet come from the mouth of your Judge. This I speak, not to
affright and trouble, but to excite and warn you. The loss of a soul is no
small loss, and upon such grounds as these, they are every day cast away.

This may suffice to be spoken to the first observation, built upon this
supposition; that it was but a pang of mere natural affection in them. But if
it were the effect of a better principle, the fruit of their Faith, as some
Judge; then I told you the observation from it would be this.

DOCT. 2. That the believing meditation of what Christ Suffered for us, Doct. 2.
is of great force and efficacy to melt and break the heart.
It is the Promise, Zach. 12.10. They shall look upon me whom they have
pierced, and mourn for him, as one mourns for his only Son, and shall be in
bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first born. Ponder
seriously here the Spring and Motive, They shall look upon me. It Is the eye of
Faith that melts and breaks the heart. The effect of such a sight of Christ,
they shall look and mourn. Be in bitterness, and sorrow. True Repentance is a
drop out of the eye of Faith.

And the measure or degree of that sorrow, caused by a believing view of
Christ. To express which, two of the fullest instances of grief we read of, are
borrowed. That of a tender Father, mourning over a dear and only Son. That of
the people of Israel, mourning over Josiah that peerless Prince, in the valley
of Megiddo.

Now to show you how the believing meditation of Christ, and his suffering,
comes kindly and savingly to break and melt down the gracious heart; I shall
propound these four considerations of the heart breaking efficacy of Faith,
eyeing a Crucified Jesus.

First, The very reallizing of Christ and his sufferings by Faith, is a most
affecting and melting thing. Faith is a true Glass any finite understanding can
comprehend in my room and stead. For my sake he there groaned and bled. For my
Pride, Earthliness, Lust, Unbelief, hardness of Heart, he endured all this. I
say to reallize the sufferings of Christ thus, is of great power to affect the
coldest, dullest heart. You cannot imagine the difference there is in
presenting things as realities, with convincing and satisfying evidences; and
our looking on them as a fiction or uncertainty.

Secondly, But Faith can apply, as well as reallize, and if it do so, it must
needs overcome the heart.

Ah, Christian, can thou look upon Jesus as standing in thy room; to bear the
wrath of a Deity for thee? Can thou think on it, and not melt? That when thou
like Isaac wast bound to the Altar, to be offered up to Justice; Christ like
the Ram, was caught in the Thicket; and offered in thy room. When thy sins had
raised a fearful tempest, that threatened every moment to entomb thee in a Sea
of wrath; Jesus Christ was thrown over to appease that storm. Say, Reader, can
thy heart dwell one hour upon such a Subject as this? Can thou with Faith
present Christ to thy self, as he was taken down from the Cross; drencht in his
own blood, and say, these were the wounds that he received for me. This is he
that loved me, and gave himself for me. Out of these wounds comes that balm
that heals my soul. Out of these stripes, my peace. When we hanged upon the
Cross, he bore my name upon his breast, like the high Priest. It was love, pure
love, strong love to my poor soul, to the soul of an enemy, that drew him down
from Heaven; and all the glory he had there, to endure these sorrows in soul
and body for me.

Oh you cannot hold up your hearts long to the piercing thoughts of this; but
your bowels will be pained, and like Joseph, you will seek a place to vent your
hearts in.

Thirdly, Faith cannot only reallize and apply Christ and his death,, but it
can reason and conclude such things from his death, as will fill the soul with
affection to him, and break the heart in pieces in his presence. When it views
Christ as Dead, it Infers; is Christ dead for me, then was I dead in Law.
Sentenced and condemned to die eternally, 2 Cor. 5.14. If one die for all, then
were all dead. How woeful was my case, when the Law had past, Sentence on me? I
could not be sure when I lay down, but that it might be executed before I rose.
Nothing but a puff of breath betwixt my soul and Hell.

Again, is Christ dead for me, then I shall never die. If he be condemned, I am
acquitted. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It Is God that
justifies, it is Christ that died, Romans 8.34. My soul is escaped as a Bird out
of the snare of the Fowler. I was condemned, but am now cleared. I was dead,
but am now alive. O the unsearchable riches of grace! O Love past finding out!

Again, Qui misit filium, immisit spiritum, promisi^ vultum; quid tandem
denegabit? Prosp.
did God give Christ to such miseries and sufferings for me, how shall he
withhold any thing now from me? He that spared not his own Son, will doubtless
with him freely give me all things, Romans 8.32. Now I may rest upon him for
pardon, peace, acceptance, and glory for my soul. Now I may rely upon him
safely, for provision, protection, and all supplies for my body. Christ is the
root of all these mercys. He is more than all these, he is nearer and dearer to
God, than any other gift. Oh what a blessed, happy* comfortable state has he
now brought my soul into!

To conclude, did Christ endure all these things for me, then it is past doubt
he will never leave, nor forsake me. It cannot be that after he has endured
all this, he will cast off the souls for whom he endured it. Here the soul is
Evangelically broken by the considerations of the mercys which emerge and flow
to it, out of the Sea of Christ's blood.

Fourthly, and Lastly, Faith cannot only reallize, apply, and compare the love
of Christ in all this, both with his dealings with others, and with the souls
dealing with Christ, who so loved it. To compare Christ's dealings with others,
is most affected. He has not dealt with every one, as with me. Nay, few there
are that can speak of such mercies as I have from him. How many are there that
have no part, nor portion in his blood? That must bear that wrath in their own
persons, that he bare himself for me! He has kissed me, over other men's
shoulders. He has reached a pardon to me, over other men's heads. He espied me
out, and singled me forth to be the object of his love, leaving thousands and
millions, still unreconciled. Not that I was better than they, for I was the
greatest of sinners. Far from righteousness. As unlikely as any to be the
object of such grace and love. My companions in sin are left, and I taken. Now
the soul is full. The heart grows big, too big to contain it self.

Yea, Faith helps the soul to compare the love of Christ to it, with the
returns it ha^h made to him, for that love. And what, my soul, has thy
carriage to Christ been, since this grace that wants a name appeared to thee?
Have thou returned love for love? Love suitable to such love? Have thou prized,
valued, and esteemed this Christ, according to his own worth in himself, or his
kindness to thee? Ah no, I have grieved, pierced, wounded his heart, a thousand
times since that, by my ingratitude. I have suffered every trifle to justle him
out of my heart. I have neglected him a thousand times, and made him say, is
this thy kindness to thy friend? Is this the reward I shall have for all that I
have done, and suffered for thee? Wretch that I am, how have I requited the
Lord! this shames, humbles, and breaks the heart.

And when from such sights of faith, and considerations as these, the heart is
thus affected; it affords a good argument indeed, that thou art gone beyond all
the seize of temporary believers. Flesh and blood has not revealed this.

Inference 1.
Infer. 2.
Have the believing meditations of Christ, and his sufferings such heart melting
influences, then sure there is but little faith among men. Our dry eyes and
hard hearts, are evidences against us, that we are strangers to the sighs of
faith.

God be merciful to the hardness of your hearts. How is Christ and his love
flighted among men! How shallow does his blood run to some eyes! Oh that my
head were waters, and mine eyes fountains of tears for this! What monsters are
carnal hearts! We are as if God had made us without affections. As if all
ingenuity and tenderness were dried up. Our ears are so accustomed to the
sounds of Christ, and his blood; than now they are become as common things. If
a child die we can mourn over our dead; but who mourns for Christ as for an
only Son? We may say of faith, when men and women sit so unaffected under the
Gospel, as Martha said of Christ, concerning her brother Lazarus, if thou
(precious faith) had been here, so many hearts had not been dead this day,
and in this duty. Faith is that burning-glass which contracts the beams of the
grace, and love, and wisdom, and power of Jesus Christ together; reflects these
on the heart, and makes it burn; but without it, we feel nothing savingly.

Inference 2.
Have the believing meditations of Christ, Infer. 2.
and his sufferings, such heart melting influences; the surely, then proper
order of raising the affections, is to begin at the exercise of faith. It
grieves me to see how many poor Christians tug at their own dead hearts,
endeavoring to raise and affect them, but cannot. They complain, and strive;
strive and complain; pump and draw, but no love to the Lord comes; no
brokenness of heart comes. They go to this ordinance and that; to one duty and
another; hoping that now the Lord will affect it and fill the sails: but come
back disappointed, and ashamed like the troops of Tema. Poor Christian, hear me
one word; possibly it may do thy business, and stand thee in more stead than
all the methods thou have yet used. If thou would indeed get an heart
Evangelically melted for sin, and broken with the kindly sense of the grace and
love of Christ; thy way is not to force thy affections, nor to vex thy self,
and go about complaining of an hard heart; but set thy self to believe,
reallize, apply, infer, and compare by faith as you have been directed: and see
what this will do. They shall look upon me whom they have pierced and mourn.
This is the true way, and proper method to raise the heart, and break it.

Inference 3.
Is this the way to get a truly broken heart, Infer. 3.
then let those that have attained brokenness of heart this way, bless the Lord
whilst they live, for so choice a mercy; And that upon a double account.

First, For as much as an heart so affected and melted, is not attainable by
any natural or unrenewed person. If they would give all they have in the world,
it cannot purchase one such tear, or groan over Christ. Mark what characters of
special grace it bears in the description that is made of it, in that
forementioned place, Zech. 12.10. Such a frame as this is not born with us, or
to be acquired by us; for it is there said to be poured out by the Lord upon us;
I will pour on them, etc. There Is no hypocrisy or dissimulation in these
mournings, for they are compared to the mourning of a man for his only Son. And
sure the hearts of parents are not untouched, when they behold such sights.

Nature is not the principle of it, but faith; For it is there said, they shall
look on me, (i. e.) believe and mourn. Self is not the end and center of these
sorrows. It is not so much for damning our selves, as for piercing Christ: they
shall look on me whom they have pierced, and shall mourn, so that this is
sorrow after God, and not a flash of nature, as was discoursed from the former
point. And therefore you have cause to bless the Lord whilst you live, for such
a special mercy as this is. And,

Secondly, As it is the right, so it is the choicest and most precious gift that
can be given you; for it is rancked among the prime mercies of the new Covenant.
Ezekiel. 36.26. This shall be the Covenant. A new heart also will I give you, and
a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of
your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. What would thou have given
sometimes for such an heart as now thou have, though it be not yet as thou
would have it? And however you value and esteem it, God himself sets no
common value on it: for mark what he ^aith of it, Psalm. 51.17. the sacrifices
of God are a broken heart, a broken and a contrite spirit, O God, thou will not
despise, (i. e.) God is more delighted with such an heart than all the
sacrifices in the world. One groan, one tear, flowing from faith, and the
spirit of Adoption, is more to him, than the Cattle upon a thousand hills. And
to the same sense he speaks again, Isai. 66.1, 2. Thus says the Lord, the
heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye
build to me? and where is the place of my rest? -- but to this man will I look,
even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word;
q. d. all the magnificent Temples, and gloririous structures in the world, give
me no pleasure in comparison of such a broken heart as this.

Oh then, for ever bless the Lord, that has done that for you, which none else
could do. And what he has done but for few besides you.

The TWENTY SIXTH Sermon. 26.
SERMON. Opens the nature and quality of the death Christ died upon the Cross.

ACT. II.XXIII. Him being delivered by the determinate counsel, and
foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified, and
slain.


HAving considered in order the preparative acts for the death of Christ, M^rs
Christi ultimus ^umiliatio^is actus, subiit extremas, horribiles, and maximas
pro hominum peccatis, poenas. Ames.
both on his own part, and on his enemies part: we now come to consider the
death of Christ it self, which was the principal part of his humiliation, and
the chief pillar of our consolation. Here we shall in order consider, First,
The kind and nature of the death he died. Secondly, The manner in which he bare
it, viz. patiently, solitary, and instructively; droping diverse holy and
instructive lessons upon all that were about him, in his seven last words upon
the Cross. Thirdly, The funeral solemnities at his burial. Fourthly, and
Lastly, The weighty ends, and great designs of his death. In all which
particulars, as we proceed to discuss and open them; you will have an account
of the deep abasement, and humiliation of the Son of God.


In this text, we have an account of the kind and nature of that death which
Christ died: as also of the causes of it, both principal and instrumental.

First, The kind and nature of the death Christ died, which is here described
more generally, as a violent death. Ye have slain him: and more particularly,
as a most ignominious, cursed, dishonorable death; ye have crucified him.

Secondly, The causes of it are here likewise expressed: and that both
principal and instrumental. The principal cause, permitting, ordering, and
disposing all things about it, was the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
God. There was not an action or circumstance, but came under this most wise and
holy counsel, and determination of God.

The Instruments effecting it, were their wicked hands. This foreknowledge and
counsel of God, Non excusantur Iudaei quia huic occulto jussui non obtemperant;
sed odio and affectibus impulsi; Christ^m percusseru^t innocentem: contra
leges. Pareus.
as it did no way necessitate or enforce them to it; so neither does it excuse
their fact from the least aggravation of its sinfulness. It did no more compel
or force their wicked hands to do what they did, than the Mariners hoising up
his sails, to take the wind to serve his design, compels the wind. And it
cannot excuse their action from one circumstance of sin* because Gods end and
manner of acting was one thing; their end and manner of acting another. His
most pure and holy; theirs most malicious, and daringly wicked. Idem quod duo
faciunt, non est idem. To this purpose a grave Divine will expresses it.

In respect of God, Morning exercise at Giles's. p. 289.
Christ's death was Justice and Mercy. In respect of man, it was murder and
cruelty. In respect of himself, it was obedience and humility. Hence our note
is.

DOCT. That our Lord Jesus Christ was not only put to death, Doct.
but to the worst of deaths, even the death of the Cross.
To this the Apostle gives a plain testimony, Phil. 2.8. He became obedient to
death, even the death of the Cross: where his humiliation is both specified; he
was humbled to death; and aggravated by a most emphatical reduplication, even
the death of the Cross. So Act. 5.30. Jesus whom ye slew, and hanged upon a
tree, q. d. it did not suffice you to put him to a violent, but you also put
him to the most base, vile, and ignominious death: you hanged him on a tree.

In this point we will discuss these three particulars, viz. the nature, or
kind; the manner, and reasons of Christ's death upon the tree.

First, I shall open the kind or nature of this death, by showing violent,
painful, shameful, cursed, slow, and succourless death.

First, It was a violent death, that Christ died. Violent in it self, though
voluntary on his part. He was cut off out of the land of the living, Isai.
53.8. And yet he laid down his life of himself; no man took it from him, Joh.
10.17. I call his death violent, because he died not a natural death, (i. e.)
he lived not till nature was consumed with age, as it is in many who live till
their balsamum radicale radical moisture, like the oil in the Lamp, be quite
consumed, and then go out like an expiring Lamp. It was not so with Christ. For
he was but in the very flower and prime of his time when he died. And indeed he
must either die a violent death, or not die at all; partly because there was no
sin in him, to open a door to natural death; as it does in all others. Partly
because else his death had not been a sacrifice acceptable and satisfactory to
God for us. That which died of it self, was never offered up to God; but that
which was slain when it was in its full strength and health. Joh. 2.19.
The Temple was a Type of the body of Christ. Now, when the Temple was
destroyed, it did not drop down as an ancient structure decayed by time; but
was pulled down by violence, when it was standing in its full strength.
Therefore he is said to suffer death, and to be put to death for us in the
flesh. (...).
1 Pet. 3.18. That Is the first thing. It was a violent, though a voluntary
death. For violent is not opposed to voluntary, but to natural.

Secondly, The death of the Cross was a most painful death. Indeed in this
death were many deaths contrived in one. The Cross was a Rack, as well as a
Gibber. The pains Christ suffered upon the Cross, are by the Apostle
emphatically styled (...), Act. 2.24. the pains of death: but properly they
signify the pangs of travail: yea, the birth pangs, the most acute sorrows of
a travailing woman. His soul was in travail, Isai. 53. His body in bitter
pangs; and being as Aquinas speaks, optime complectionatus, of the most
excellent Crisis, exact and just temperament; his senses were more acute and
delicate than ordinary: and all the time of his suffering so they continued;
not in the least blunted, dulled or rebated by the pains he suffered.

Continebat ^oenas maximas, q^ia m^seriam illam totam aequabat, qua ^ominum
pec^a ta mer^^antur. Ames. med.
The death of Christ doubtless contained the greatest, and acutest pains
imaginable. Because these pains of Christ alone, were intended to equalize all
that misery, which the sin of man deserved, all that pain which the damned
shall, and the Elect deserved to feel. Now to have pains meeting at once upon
one person, equivalent to all the pains of the damned: Judge you what a plight
Christ was in.

Thirdly, The death of the Cross, was a shameful death. Not only because the
crucified were stripped quite naked, and so exposed as spectacles of shame: but
mainly, because it was that kind of death which was appointed for the basest,
and vilest of men.

Their Freemen when they committed capital crimes, were not condemned to the
Cross. No, that was looked upon as the death appointed for slaves. Vide Ly fius
de ^r^ce. Lib. 1. cap. 11.
Tacitus calls it servile supplicium, the punishment of a slave: and to the
same sense Iuvenal speaks, pone crucem servo, put the Cross upon the back of a
slave. As they had a great esteem of a Freeman, In^enni ^ominis nulla est
estimatio.
so they manifested it, even when they had forfeited their lives, in cutting
them off by more honorable kinds of death. This by hanging on the tree, was
always accounted most ignominious. Merten hanc Homerus Od^s. X vocat (...)
impuram. Et Eusi^ ^ius (...) foedam.
To this day we say of him that is hanged, he dies the death of a dog. And yet
it is said of our Lord Jesus, Heb. 12.2. he not only endured the Cross, but also
despised the shame. Obedience to his Fathers will, and zeal for your Salvation,
made him digest the shame of it, and despise the baseness that was in it.

Fourthly, The death of the Cross, was a cursed death. Upon that account he is
said to be made (...) a curse for us; for it is written cursed is every one
that hangs on a Tree, Gal. 3.13. This refers to Deuteronomy. 21.23. His body shall
not remain all night upon the Tree, but thou shall in any wise bury him that
day; for he that is hanged, is accursed of God. The very Symbol of lifting them
up betwixt heaven and earth, carried much shame in it. For it implied this in
it, that the person so used, was so execrable, base, and vile; that he deserved
not to tread upon the earth, or touch the surface of the ground any more. And
the command for burying them that day, No^ statuitu^ hoc p^o ho^or^ cadaveris
se^eli adi, sed quod cadaver il^ud malidict^m cito a su^e ficiet^^. ae
tollatur, and terra non qui^^tur. Sis Bonfierius.
does not at all mitigate, but rather aggravates this curse: speaking the
person to be so abominable, that as he is lifted up into the air, and hanging
between heaven and earth, as unworthy ever to set foot more upon the earth; so
when dead, they were to hasten to bury him; that such an abominable sight might
be removed as soon as might be, from before the eyes of men. And that the earth
might not be defiled, by his lying on the surface of it, when taken down.

However, as the Learned Iunius has Judiciously observed, that this curse is
only a Ceremonial curse. For otherwise it is neither in it self, nor by the Law
of nature, or by civil Law, more execrable than any other death. And the main
reason why the Ceremonial Law affixed the curse to this rather than any other
death, was principally with respect to the death Christ was to die. And
therefore, Reader, see and admire the providence of God, that Christ should die
by a Roman and not by a Iudaick Law. For Crucifying, or Hanging on the Tree;
was a Roman punishment, and not in use among the Jews. But the Scriptures
cannot be broken.

Fifthly, The death of the Cross was a very slow, and lingering death. They
died leisurably. Which still increases, and aggravateth the misery of it. If a
man must die a violent death, it is a favor to be dispatched. As they that are
pressed to death, beg for more weight. And it is a favor to those that are
hanged, to be smitten on the breast, or plucked by the heels, by their friends.
On the contrary to hang long in the midst of tortures, to have death coming
upon us with a slow pace, that we may feel every tread of it, as it comes on,
is a misery.

The Tyrant that heard the poor Martyr was dead under his first torments, said
as one disappointed, Evasit. He has escaped me. For he intended to have kept
him much longer under torments. And it was the cruel counsel of another to his
executioner; Let him die so, Moriatur, ut sentiat se mori.
as he may feel himself how he dies. And surely in this respect it was worse
for Christ, than any other that was ever nailed to the Tree. For all the while
he hanged there, he remained full of life, and acute sense. His life departed
not gradually, but was whole in him to the last. Other men die gradually, and
toward their end their sense of pain is much blunted. They faulter, fumble,
and expire by degrees; but Christ stood under ^he pains of death in his full
strength. His life was whole in him. This was evident by the mighty outcry he
made, Vitam and vires quo^^que voluit Christus servavit, and quando voluit
deponebat. Ames.
when he gave up the Ghost. Which argued him then to be full of strength,
contrary to the experience of all other men. Which made the Centurion when he
heard it, to conclude; Surely this was the Son of God, Mark. 15.37, 39.

Sixthly, It was a succourless and helpless death to Christ. Sometimes they
gave to malefactors amidst their torments, Vinegar, and Myrh to blunt, dull,
and stupifie their Senses. And if they hanged long, would break their bones, to
dispatch them out of their pains. Christ had none of this favor. Instead of
Vinegar and Myrh, they gave him Vinegar and Gall to drink, to aggravate his
torments. And for the breaking of his bones, he prevented it, by dying before
they come to break his legs. For the Scriptures must be fulfilled, which says,
not a bone of him shall be broken.

This now was the kind and nature of that death he died. Even the violent,
painful, shameful, cursed, slow, and succourless death of the Cross. An Ancient
punishment both among the Romans and Carthaginians. But in honor of Christ,
who died this death, Constantine the great abrogated it by Law, Sozom. lib. 1.
cap. 8.
ordaining that none should ever be Crucified any more, because Christ died
that Death.

Secondly, As to the manner of the execution. They that were condemned to the
death of the Cross, Godwins Antiq. lib 3. Sect. 3. p. 192.
(says a Learned Antiquary of our own,) bare their Cross upon their own
shoulders, to the place of execution. Then was stripped of all their clothes, for
they suffered naked. And then were fastened to the Cross with nails.

The manner how that was done, one gives us in these words, They stretch him
out (meaning Christ) like another Isaac upon his own burden, Herbs
Contempla^^on of Christ Passion.
the Cross; that so they might take measure of the holes. And though the Print
of his blood upon it, gave them the true length of his body; yet how strictly
do they take it longer than the truth. Thereby at once to Crucify, and rack
him. Then being nailed, like as Moses lifted up the Serpent, so was the Son of
man lifted up. And when the Cross, with the Lord fastened on it, fell into its
socket, or basis; it Jerked the whole, and every part of his sacred body. And
the whole weight hanging on his nailed hands, the wounds by degrees grew wider
and wider: till at last he expired in the midst of those tortures.

And that the equity of their proceedings might the better appear, to the
people; the cause of the punishment was written in Capital Letters, and fixed
to the Tree over the head of the Malefactor. Of this appendant to this kind of
death, I shall speak distinctly in the next Sermon, before I come to handle the
manner of his death: there being so much of providence in that circumstance, as
invites us to spend more than a few transient thoughts upon it. Mean while in
the next place

Thirdly, We will enquire briefly into the reasons why Christ

First, Because Christ must bear the curse in his death, Potissima causa mal
dictionis hujus est quia Christus i^ mysterio praesignabatur. Masius.
and a curse by Law affixed to no other kind of death, as it was to this. The
Learned Masius upon Iosuah 2.29. Commenting upon the death of the King of Ai,
who was hanged on the Tree, until evening, tells us that the principal reason
of the malediction and execrableness of this death was, because the death of
Christ was prefigured in that mystery. Christ came to take away the curse from
us, by this death; and so must be made a curse. On him must all the curses of
the Moral Law lie, which were due to us. And that nothing might be wanting to
make it a full curse; the very death he died, must also have a Ceremonial curse
upon it.

Secondly, Christ died this, rather than any other kind of death; to fulfill the
Types, and prefigurations that of old were made with respect to it. All the
Sacrifices were lifted up from the earth, upon the Altar. But especially the
brassen Serpent prefigured this death, Numb. 21.9. Moses made a Serpent of
Brass and put it upon a pole. And says Christ, Ioh. 3.14. As Moses lifted up
the Serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that so he
might correspond with that lively Type, made of him in the wilderness.

Thirdly, Christ died this, rather than any other death, because it was
predicted of him, and in him must all the predictions, as well as Types be
fully accomplished. The Psalmist spoke in the person of Christ, of this death,
as plainly as if he had rather been writing the History of what was done, than
a Prophecy of what was to be done, so many years afterward, Psalm. 22.16, 17.
For dogs have compassed me about, the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me;
they pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones, they look and stare
upon me. Which has a manifest reference to the dist^ntion of all his members
upon the Tree, which was as a rack to him. So Zech 12.10. They shall look upon
me, whom they have pierced. Yea, Christ himself had foretold the death he
should die, in the forecited, Ioh. 3.14. Saying, he must be lifted up, (i. e.)
hanged between heaven and earth. And the Scriptures must be fulfilled.

Thus you have a brief account both of the kind, manner, and reasons of this
death of Christ. The improvement of it, you have in the following Inferences of
truth, diducible from it.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Is Christ dead? And did he die the violent, painful, shameful, cursed, slow,
and succourless death of the Cross? Then surely there is forgiveness with God,
A demonstration of pardon for he greatest of sinners.
and plenteous redemption for the greatest of Sinners; that by Faith apply the
blood of the Cross, to their poor guilty Souls. So speaks the Apostle, Col.
1.14. In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
sins. And 1 Ioh. 1.7. The blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin. Two things
will make this demonstrable.

First, That there is sufficient efficacy in this blood of the Cross, to
expiate the greatest Sins.

Secondly, That the efficacy of it is designed and intended by God for
believing sinners. How clearly do both these propositions lie in the Word.

First, That there is sufficient efficacy in the blood of the Cross, to expiate
and wash away the greatest sins. This is manifest, for it is precious blood, as
it is called, 1. Pet. 1.18. Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as
Silver and Gold; but with the precious blood of the Son of God. This
pretiousness of the blood of Christ rises from the union it has with that
person, who is over all God blessed for ever. And on that account is styled the
blood of God, Acts 20.28. And so it becomes Royal, Princely blood. Yea, such
for the dignity, and efficacy of it, as never was created, or shall ever run in
any other veins, but his. The blood of all the creatures in the world, even a
Sea of humane blood; bears no more proportion to the precious and excellent
blood of Christ, than a dish of common water, to a Riv^r of liquid Gold. On the
account of its invaluable pretiousness, it becomes satisfying and reconciling
blood to God. So the Apostle speaks, Col. 1.20. And (having made peace through
the Blood of his Cross,) by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him I
say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. The same blood which
is Redemption to them that dwell on earth, is Confirmation to them that dwell
in Heaven. Before the efficacy of this blood guilt vanishes, and shrinks away;
as the the shadows before the glorious Sun. Every drop of it has a voice, and
speaks to the soul that sits trembling under its guilt, better things, than the
blood of Abel, Heb. 12.24. It sprinkles us from an evil, (i. e.) an unquiet,
and accusing conscience, Heb. 10.22. For having enough in it to satisfy God,
it must needs have enough in it to satisfy conscience.

Conscience can demand no more for its satisfaction, nor will it take less,
than God demands for his satisfaction. And in this blood is enough to give both
satisfaction.

Secondly, As there is sufficient Efficacy in this blood, to expiate the
greatest guilt; so it is as manifest, that the virtue and efficacy of it, is
intended and designed by God for the Use of believing sinners. Such blood as
this was shed without doubt for some weighty end. That some might be the better
for it. Who they are for whom it is intended, is plain enough from Acts 13.39.
And by him all that believe, are justified from all things; from which they
could not be justified by the Law of Moses.

That the remission of the sins of believers was the great thing designed in
the pouring out of this precious blood of Christ, appears from all the
Sacrifices that figured it to the ancient Church. The sheding of that Typical
blood, spoke a design of pardon. And the putting of their hands upon the head
of the Sacrifice, spoke the way and Method of believing, by which that blood
was then applied to them in that way: and is still applied to us in a more
excellent way. Had no pardon been intended, no Sacrifices had been appointed.

Moreover, let it be considered; this blood of the Cross is the blood of a
surety; that came under the same obligations with us, and in our name or stead
shed it: and so of course frees and discharges the principal offender, or
debtor. Heb. 7.22. Can God exact satisfaction from the blood and death of his
own Son, the surety of Believers; and yet still demand it from Believers? It
cannot be. Who (says the Apostle) shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
elect? It is God that Justifies. Who shall condemn? It is Christ that died,
Romans 8.33, 34. And why are faith and repentance prescribed as the means of
pardon? Why does God every where in his word, call upon sinners to repent, and
believe in this blood? Encouraging them so to do, by so many precious promises
of remission: and declaring the inevitable and eternal ruin of all impenitent
and unbelieving ones, who despise and reject this blood? What I say, does all
this speak, but the possibility of a pardon for the greatest of sinners; and
the certainty of a free, full, and final pardon, for all believing sinners? O
what a Joyful sound is this? What ravishing voices of peace, pardon, grace, and
acceptance come to our ears, from the blood of the Cross!

The greatest guilt that ever was contracted upon a trembling shaking
Conscience, can stand before the efficacy of the blood of Christ, no more, than
the sinner himself can stand before the Justice of the Lord, with all the guilt
upon him.

Reader, The word assures thee; what ever thou have been, or art; that sins of
as deep a die as thine, have been washed away in this blood. I was a blasphemer,
a persecutor, in urious; but I obtained mercy, says Paul, 1 Timothy 1.13. but it
may be thou will object: this was a rare and singular instance, and it is a
great question whether any other sinner shall find the like grace, that he did.
No question of it at all, if you believe in Christ, as he did: for he tells us
verse. 16. For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might
show forth all long suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter
belief on him, to life everlasting. So that upon the same grounds he obtained
mercy, you may obtain it also.

Those very men who had an hand in the sheding of Christ's blood, had the
benefit of that blood afterward pardoning them. Act. 2.36. There is nothing
but unbelief and impenitency of heart, bars thy soul from the blessings of this
blood.

Inference 2.
Did Christ die the cursed death of the Cross for believers, Infer. 2.
then though there may be much of pain, there is nothing of curse in the death
of the Saints. It still wears its dart, by which it strikes; but has lost its
sting by which it hurts and destroys. A Serpent that has no sting, may hiss
and affright; but we may take him in our hand without danger. Death poured out
all its poison, and lost its sting in Christ's side, when he became a curse for
us.

But what speak I of the innocence and harmlesness of death to believers. It is
certainly their friend, and great benefactor. As there is no curse, so there
are many blessings in it. Death is yours, 1 Cor. 3.22. Yours as a special
privilege and favor. Christ has not only conquered it, but is more than a
conqueror; for he has made it beneficial, and very serviceable to the saints.
When Christ was nailed to the tree, then he said as it were to death which came
to grapple with him there; O death I will be thy plagues, O grave I will be thy
destruction; And so he was: for he swallowed up death in victory. Spoiled it of
its power. So that it drives but a poor trade now among believers; frighting
some weak ones among them, though it cannot hurt them at all.

Inference 3.
If Christ died the cursed death of the Cross for us, Infer. 3. Omnes
Christianus est crucianus.
how cheerfully should we submit to, and bear any cross for Jesus Christ! He
had his cross, and we have ours; but what feathers are ours, compared with his?
His cross was a heavy cross indeed, yet how patiently and meekly did he support
it! He endured his cross, we cannot endure or bear ours, though they be not to
be named with his. Three things would marvellously strengthen us, to bear the
cross of Christ, and bring up a good report upon it in the world.

First, That we shall carry it but a little way. Secondly, Christ bears the
heaviest end of it. Thirdly, innumerable blessings and mercies grow upon the
Cross of Christ.

If twenty crosses be written for you in Gods book, they will come at last to
nineteen, and after that nothing. But your head betwixt Christ's breasts for
evermore, and his own soft hand to dry your face and wipe away your tears.
First, We shall bear it but a little way. It should be enough to me (says a
holy one) that Christ will have joy and sorrow halfers of the life of the
saints. And that each of them should have a share of our days, as the night
and day are kindly partners of time; and take it up betwixt them. But if sorrow
be the greediest halfer of our days here, I know joys day shall dawn: and do
more than recompense all our sad hours.

Let my Lord Jesus (since he will do so) weave my bit, and span length of time
wi^h white and black; well and woe. -- Let the rose be neighbor with the thorn.
-- When we are over the water Christ shall cry. Down Crosses and up Heaven for
evermore. Down Hell, and down Death, and down Sin, and down Sorrow: and up
Glory, up Life, up Joy for evermore. It Is true, Christ and his Cross are not
separable in this life, how be it, Christ and his Cross part at Heavens door.
For there is no house-room for crosses in Heaven. One tear, one sigh, one sad
heart, one fear, one loss, one thought of trouble, cannot find lodging there.
-- Sorrow and the saints are not married together; or suppose it were so,
Heaven shall make a divorce. Life is but short, and therefore crosses cannot be
long. Our sufferings are but for a while. 1 Pet. 5.10. They are but the
sufferings of the present time. Romans 8.18.

Secondly, As we shall carry the Cross of Christ but a little way, so Christ
himself bears the heaviest end of it. There is a fellowship in sufferings,
betwixt Christ and his saints. And as one happily expresses, he says of their
crosses half mine. He divides sufferings with them and takes the largest share
to himself. O how sweet a sight (says one sweetly) is it to see a cross
betwixt Christ and us. To hear our Redeemer say, at every sigh, at every blow,
and every loss of a Believer half mine. For they are called the sufferings of
Christ, and the reproach of Christ. Col. 2.24. Heb. 11.26. As when two are
partners and owners of a Ship, half of the gain and half of the loss belongs
to either of the two. So Christ in our sufferings, is half gainer and half
loser with us: yea, the heaviest end of the black tree lies on your Lord. It
falls first upon him, and but rebounds from him upon you: the reproaches of
them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me. Psalm. 69.9. Nay to speak as the
thing is, Christ does not only bear half, or the better part; but the whole of
our cross and burden. Yea, he bears all, and more than all; for he bears us,
and our burden too; or else we should quickly sink, and faint under it.

Thirdly, As we have not far to carry it, and Christ carries the haviest part;
yea, all the burden for us; yea, us, and our burden too: So in the last place
it is reviving to think what an innumerable multitude of blessings and mercies
are the fruit and offspring of a sanctified cross. Since that tree was so
richly watered with the blood of Christ; what store of choice, and rich fruits
does it bear to believers?

Our sufferings (says one) are washed in the blood of Christ, as well as our
souls. For Christ's merits bought a blessing to the crosses of the sons of God.
Our troubles owe us a free passage through him. Devils, and men, and crosses
are our debtors; and death, and all storms are our debtors, to blow our poor
tossed bark over the water fraught-free: and to set the Travelers in their own
known ground. Therefore we shall die, and yet live. -- I know no man has a
velvet cross, but the cross is made of what God will have it; but verily, how
be it, it be no warrantable market to buy a cross, yet I dare not say, O that I
had liberty to sell Christ's cross, lest therewith also I should sell joy,
comfort, sense of love, patience, and the kind visits of a Bridegroom. -- I
have but small experience of sufferings for Christ, but let my Judge and
witness in Heaven, lay my soul in the balance of Justice; If I find not a
young Heaven, and a little Paradise of glorious comforts, and soul delighting
love kisses of Christ, in suffering for him and his truth. -- My prison is my
palace, my sorrow is with child of Joy. My losses are rich losses, my pain
easy pain, my heavy days are holy days, and happy days. I may tell a new tale
of Christ to my friends. -- Oh what owe I to the file, and to the hammer, and
to the furnace of my Lord Jesus! who has now let me see how good the wheat of
Christ is, that goes through his mill, and his oven; to be made bread for his
own Table. Grace tried, is better than grace, and more than grace; It Is glory
in the Infancy.

Who knows the truth of grace without a trial? -- O how little gets Christ
of us but what he wins (to speak so) with much toil, and pains? And how soon
would faith freeze without a Cross! bear your Cross therefore with joy.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Did Christ die the death, yea the worst of deaths for us? Then it follows, that
our mercies are brought forth with great difficulties; and that which is sweet
to us in the fruition, was costly and hard to Christ in the acquisition. Surely
upon every mercy we have, Lock. in Col.
this motto is written, The price of blood. Col. 1.14. In whom we have
redemption through his blood: upon which a late neat Writer delivers himself
thus. The way of grace is here considerable; life comes through death; God
comes in Christ; and Christ comes in blood: the choicest mercies come through
the greatest miseries; prime favors come swiming in blood to us. Through a red
sea, Israel came to Canaan. Many a man lost his life, and much blood shed; the
very land flowing with milk and honey, was first made to flow with blood, e're
Israel could inherit the promise. Seven nations were destroyed e're the Land of
Canaan was divided to the Israelites. Act. 13.19. -- Sin makes mercy so deadly
hard to bring forth. To Christen every precious child, every Ben^amin Benoni,
every son of Gods right hand, a son of sorrow and death to her that brings him
forth. Adams sweets had no bitter till he transgressed Gods will. One mercy did
not die to bring forth another, till he died. But oh how should this raise the
value of ^ur mercies! What, the price of blood, the price of precious blood,
the blood of the Cross! O what an esteem should this raise!

Things (as the same ingenious Author adds) are prized rather as they come,
than as they are. Far fetched and dear bought makes all the price, and gives all
the worth with us weak creatures. Upon this ground the Scripture, when it
speaks of our great fortune, tells the great price it cost, as eying our
weakness, who look more at what things cost, than at what they are. And as
knowing if any thing will take with us, this will. To him that loved us, and
washed us from our sin, in his own blood. Rev. 1.5.

Man is a Legal creature, and looks much at what is given for a thing. What did
this cost? Why, it cost Christ's own blood. Color is more than the cloth with
us, and scarlet color is a general taking color: and therefore is Christ's
garments dipped in blood, and he admired in this habit. Who is this that comes
from Edom? with garments dyed red from Bozra?

Beware then you abuse not not any of the mercies that Christ brought forth
with so many bitter pangs, and throws. And let all this endear Christ more than
ever to you, and make you in a deep sense of his grace and love, to say,

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The TWENTY SEVENTH Sermon. 27.
SERMON. Opens and improves that signal Providence which directed and ordered
the Title affixed to the Cross of Christ.

LUKE XXIII.XXXVIII. And a superscription also was written over him, in letters
of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew; This is the King of the Jews.


BEfore I pass on to the manner of Christ's death, I shall consider the Title
affixed to the Cross: in which very much of the wisdom of providence was
discovered. It was the manner of the Romans, that the equity of their
proceedings might the more clearly appear to the people, when they crucified
any man, to publish the cause of his death in a Table written in Capital
Letters, and placed over the head of the crucified. And that there might be at
least a show and face of Justice in Christ's death, he also shall have his title
or superscription.

The worst and most unrighteous actions labor to cover and shroud themselves
under pretensions of equity. Sin is so shameful a thing, that, it cares not to
own its name. Christ shall have a Table written for him also. (...).
This writing one Evangelist calls the Accusation, Matthew. 27.37. Another calls
it the Title, Joh. 19.19. Another the Inscription, or Superscription, so the
Text. And another the Superscription of his Accusation, Mark 15.26. In short,
it was a fair legible writing intended to express the fact or crime, for which
the person died.

This was their usual manner, Eusebius Eccles. Hist. lib. 5. c. 1.
though sometime we find it was published by the voice of the common Crier. As
in the case of Attalus the martyr, who was led about the Amphitheater; one
proclaiming before him, This is Attalus the Christian. But it was customary and
usual to express the crime in a written Table, as the Text expresses it.
Wherein these three things offer themselves to your consideration.

First, Integer titulus fuit, Hic est Jesus Naza^enus, Rex Judaeorum. Par.
The Character or Description of Christ contained in This is the King of the
Jews. That very office which but a little before they had reproached and
derided, bowing the knee to him in mockery, saying, Hail King of the Jews, the
providence of God so orders it, that therein he shall be vindicated, and
honored. This is the King of the Jews: Or as the other Evangelists complete
it, This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews.

Secondly, The person that drew his Character or Title. It Pilate; he that but
now condemned him: he that was his Judge, shall be his Herald, to proclaim his
glory. For the Title is honorable. Surely this was not from himself, for he
was Christ's enemy; but rather than Christ should want a tongue to clear him,
the tongue of an enemy shall do it.

Thirdly, Titulus pro more forsan fuit impositus, sed altius assurge^dum est;
ad D^i concilium, qui testimonio ^oc publico, Christum regem Ecclesiae
proclamari Pilati scriptura vol^it. Par.
The time when this honor was done him: it was Pilate, to draw this Title for
him, and affix it to his Cross. Surely we must look higher than Pilate in this
thing, and see how providence serves it self by the hands of Christ's
adversaries. Pilate writes in honor of Christ, and stiftly defends it too
Hence our observation is.

DOCT. 1. That the dignity of Christ was openly proclaimed, Doct. 1.
and defended by an enemy; and that in the time of his greatest reproaches, and
Sufferings.
To open this mystery of providence to you, that you may not stand idly gazing
upon Christ's Title, as many then did: we must first consider the nature and
quality of this Title. Secondly, what hand the providence of God had in this
matter. Thirdly, and then draw forth the proper Uses and improvements of it.

First, To open the nature and quality of Christ's Title or Inscription; let it
be thoroughly considered and we shall find

First, That it was an extraordinary Title, varying from all examples of that
kind; and directly crossing the main design and end of their own custom. For as
I hinted before, the end of it was to clear the equity of their proceedings;
and show the people how justly they suffered those punishments inflicted on
them for such crimes. Hoc extraordinarium est, quod fine ignominia titulus
appo^itur. Calv.
But Lo, here is a Title expressing no crime at all, and so vindicating Christ's
innocence. This some of them perceived, and moved Pilate to change it, not this
is, but this is he that said I am the King of the Jews. In that as they
conceived lay his Crime. O how strange and wonderful a thing was this! But what
shall we say! It was a day of wonders, and extraordinary things. As there was
never such a person Crucified before, so there never was such a Title affixed
to the Cross before.

Secondly, As it was an extraordinary, so it was a public Title, both written,
Tribus linguis toto o^b^t^nc vulga^issimis; scribi voluit; ut ab omnibus legi,
and inte^igi potuit. Pare^^.
and published with the greatest advantages of spreading it self far and near,
among all people that could be. For it was written in three Languages, and
those most known in the world at that time. The Greek tongue was then known in
most parts of the world. The Hebrew was the Jews native Language. And the
Latin the Language of the Gentiles. So that it being written both in Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin, it was easy to be understood, both by Jews and Gentiles.

And indeed unto this the providence of God had a special eye, to make it
notorious and evident to all the world. For even so all things designed, for
public view, and knowledge were written. Josephus tells us of certain Pillars
on which was Engraven in Letters of Greek and Latin. In locum saenctum ingredi
alien gini^ (...) ^st.
It is a wickedness for strangers to enter into the holy place. So the
Soldiers of Gordian the third Emperor, when he was slain upon the borders of
Persia, they raised a Monument for him, and engraved his memorial upon it, in
Greek, Latin, Persick, Iudaick, and Egyptick Letters; that all people might
read the same. And as it was written in three Learned Languages, so it was
exposed to view in a public place; and at that time, when multitudes of
strangers, as well as Jews were at Jerusalem: it was at the time of the
Passover. So that all things concurred to spread and divulge the innocence of
Christ, vindicated in this Title.

Thirdly, As it was a public, so it was an honorable Title. Such was the
nature of it, Bucer. in Loc.
says Bucer; that in the midst of death Christ began to Triumph by it. And by
reason thereof the Cross began to change its own nature, and instead of a rack,
or Engine of torture, it became a Throne of Majesty. Yea, it might be called
now, as the Church it self is, the Pillar and ground of Truth; for it held out
much of the Gospel, much of the glory of Christ; as that Pillar does, to which
a Royal Proclamation is affixed.

Fourthly, It was a vindicating Title. It cleared up the honor, dignity, and
innocence of Christ, against all the false imputations, calumnies, and
blasphemies, which were cast upon him before, by the wicked tongues, both of
Jews and Gentiles.

They had called him a deceiver, a usurper, a blasphemer, they rent their
clothes in token of their detestation of his blasphemy; because he made himself
the Son of God, and King of Israel. But now in this they acknowledged him to
be, both Lord and Savior. Not a mock King, as they had made him before. So
that herein the honor of Christ was fully vindicated.

Fifthly, T^ibus linguis scribi voluit, ut praesagium hoc esset, f^turae
vocationis omnium non modo Hebraeorum sed and Graecorum, and Latinorum ad
Christ^ regnum. Par.
Moreover, it was a predicting, and presaging Title. Evidently foreshewing, the
propagation of Christ's Kingdom; and the spreading of his name and glory, among
all kindreds, Nations, Tongues, and Languages. As Christ has a right to enter
into all the Kingdoms of the earth by his Gospel, and set up his Throne in
every Nation: so it was presaged by this Title, that he should do so. And that
both Hebrews, Greeks, and Latins, should be called to the knowledge of him.
Nor is it a wonder that this should be predicted by wicked Pilate, when
Caiaphas himself, a man every way as wicked as he; had Prophesied to the same
purpose, Ioh. 11.51, 52. For being High Priest that year, he Proph^sied, that
Jesus should dye for that Nation, and not for that Nation only, but that also
he should gather together in one, the children of God, that were scattered
abroad. Yea, many have Prophesied in Christ's name, who for all that shall never
be owned by him, Matthew. 7.22.

Sixthly, And Lastly, it was an immutable Title. The Jews endeavored, but
could not persuade Pilate to alter it. To all their importunities he returns
this resolve answer, What I have written I have written; Haec Pilati constantia
divinae providentiae tribuenda est. Calv.
as if he should say, urge me no more, I have written his Title, I cannot, I
will not alter a Letter, a Point thereof. Surely the constancy of Pilate at
this time, can be attributed to nothing, but divine special Providence. Most
wonderful, that he, who before was as unconstant, as a reed shaken by the wind,
is now as fixed as a Pillar of Brass.

And yet more wonderful that he should write down that very particular in the
Title of Christ, This is the King of the Jews, which was the very thing, that
so scared him but a little before, and was the very consideration that moved
him to give Sentence. What was now become of the fear of Caesar? that Pilate
dares to be Christ's Herald, and publicly to proclaim him The King of the Jews.
This was the Title.

Secondly, We shall next enquire what hand the divine providence had in this
business.

And indeed, the providence of God in this hour acted gloriously, and
wonderfully these five ways.

First, In over ruling the heart and hand of Pilate, in that draught and style
of it, and the contrary to his own inclination. I doubt not but Pilate himself
was ignorant of, and far enough from designing that which the wisdom of
Providence aimed at, Long altius prospexit Dei providentia, qua Pilati slylum
g^be^navit. Calv.
in this matter. He was a wicked man, he had no love to Christ. He had given
Sentence of death against him. Yet this is he that proclaimed him, to be Jesus,
King of the Jews. It so over ruled his Pen, that he could not write what was in
his own heart and intention, but the quite contrary; even a fair and public
Testimony to the Kingly office of the Son of God, This is the King of the Jews.
Secondly, Herein the wisdom of providence was gloriously displaied, in applying
a present, proper, public remedy, to the reproaches and blasphemies which
Christ had then newly received, in his name and honor. The superstitious Jews
wound him, and Heathen Pilate prepares a plaster to heal him. They reproach,
he vindicates. They throw the dirt, he washes it off. O, the profound and
inscrutable wisdom of providence! Thirdly, Morever, providence eminently
appeared at this time, in keeping so timorous a person, a man of so base a
spirit, that would not stick at any thing to please the people, from receding,
or giving ground in the least to their importunities. Is Pilate become a man of
such resolution and constancy? Whence is this? But from the God of the Spirits
of all flesh. Who now flowed in so powerfully upon his Spirit, that he could
not choose but write: and when he had written, had no more power to alter what
he had written, that he had to refuse to write it. Fourthly, Herein also much
of the wisdom of providence appeared, in casting the ignominy of the death of
Christ upon those very men who ought to bear it. Pilate was moved by divine
instinct, at once to clear Christ, and accuse them. For it is, as if he had
said you have moved me to Crucify your King, I have Crucified him, and now let
the ignominy of his death rest upon your heads, who have extorted this from me.
He is righteous, the crime is not his but yours. Fifthly, And lastly, the
providence of God wonderfully discovered it self, (as before was noted) in
fixing this Title to the Cross of Christ, when there was so great a confluence
of all sorts of people, to take notice of it. So that it could never have been
more advantagiously published, than it was at this time. So that we may say,
how wonderful are the works of God! His ways are in the Sea, his paths in the
great deeps; his footsteps are not known. His providence has a prospect beyond
the understandings of all Creatures.
Inference 1.
Hence it follows that the providence of our God can, Infer. 1.
and often does over rule the counsels and actions of the worst of men to his
own glory.

It can serve it self by them that oppose it, and bring about the glory and
honor of Christ, by those very men, and means, which are designed to lay it in
the dust. Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee, Psalm. 76.10. The Jews
thought when they Crowned Christ with Thorns, bowed the knee, and mocked him;
led him to Golgotha, and crucified him; that now they had utterly dispoiled him
of all his Kingly dignities: and yet even there, he is proclaimed a King. Thus
the dispersion of the Jews upon the death of Stephen, spread the Gospel far and
near, For they went every where Preaching the Word, Acts 8.4. Thus Paul's bonds
for the Gospel, fell out to the furtherance of the Gospel, Phil. 1.12. O, the
depth of divine wisdom to propagate, and establish the interest of Jesus
Christ, by those very means that seem to import its destruction: that extracts
a Medicine out of poison! How great a support, should this be to the faith of
Gods people! When all things seem to run cross to their hopes and happiness!
Let Israel therefore hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and
with him is plenteous Redemption, Psalm. 130.7. (i. e.) He is never at a loss
for means, to promote and serve his own ends.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2,
Hence likewise it follows, That the greatest services performed to Christ
accidentally, and undesignedly; shall never be accepted, nor rewarded of God.
Pilate did Christ an eminent piece of service. He did that for Christ that not
one of his own Disciples at that time durst do, and yet this service was not
accepted of God; because he did it not designedly for his glory, but from the
mere over rulings of providence.

If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted, according to what a man
has, says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 8.12. The eye of God is first and mainly upon
the will; if that be sincere and right for God, small things will be accepted;
and if not, the greatest shall be abhorred. So 1 Cor. 9.17. If I do this thing,
(i. e.) (Preach the Gospel) willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will,
a dispensation is committed to me, q. d. If I upon pure principles of Faith and
Love, from my heart, designing the glory of God, and delighting to promote it
by my ministry, do cheerfully and willingly apply my self to the Preaching of
the Gospel, I shall have acceptance and reward with God: but if my work be a
burden to me, and the service of God esteemed as a bondage; why then providence
may use me for the dispensing of the Gospel to others, but I my self shall lose
both reward and comfort. As it does not excuse my sin, that God can bring glory
to himself out of it: so neither does it justify an action, that God has
praise and honor accidentally by it. Paul knew that even the strife and envy
in which some Preached Christ, should turn to his salvation; and yet he was not
at all beholding to them for promoting his salvation that way. So Pilate here
promotes the honor of Jesus Christ to whom he had no Love, and whose glory he
did not at all design in this thing; and therefore has neither acceptance nor
reward with God.

O, therefore what ever you do for Christ do it heartily, designedly, for his
glory. Of a ready and willing mind. With pure and sincere aims at his glory.
For this is that the Lord more respects, than the greatest services by accident.

Inference 3.
Would not Pilate recede from what he had written on Christ's behalf. Infer. 3.
How shameful a thing is it for Christians to retract what they have said or
done on Christ's behalf! When Pilate had asserted him to be King of the Jews, he
maintains his assertion, and all the importunity of Christ's enemies shall not
move him an hairs breadth from it. What I have written, I have written, q. d. I
have said it, and I will not revoke it. Did Pilate say what I have written, I
have written. And shall not we say what we have believed, we have believed. And
what we have professed, we have professed. What we have engaged to Christ we
have engaged. We will stand to what we have done for him; we will never recant
our former ownings of, and appearances for Christ.

As Gods Election, so your profession must be irrevocable. O let him that is
holy be holy still. That counsel given by a Reverend Divine in this case is
both safe and good. Be sure says he you stand on good ground, and then resolve
to stand your ground against all the world. Follow God, and fear not men. Art
thou godly, repent not whatsoever thy Religion cost thee. Let sinners repent,
but let not Saints repent. Let Saints repent of their faults, but not of their
Faith. Of their iniquities, but not of their righteousness. Repent not of your
righteousness, lest you afterward repent of your repentance. -- Repent not of
your Zeal, or your forwardness, or activity in the holy ways of the Lord. --
Wish not your selves a step farther back, or a cubit lower in your stature, in
the grace of God. Wish not any thing undone, concerning which God will say well
done.

In Gallens time it was a proverbial expression, when any one would show the
impossibility of a thing. You may as soon ^urn a Christian from Christ as do it.

A true heart-choice of Christ is without reserves, and what is without
reserves, will be without repentance. There is a stiffness and stoutness of
spirit, which is our sin. But this is our glory, in the matters of God said
Luther, I assume this title, cedo nulli, I yield to none: if ye be hot and
cold, off and on. Profess, and retract your profession. He that condemned
Christ with his lips, will condemn you by his example. Resolute Pilate shall be
your Judge.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Did Pilate affix such an honorable vindicating Title to the Cross, Then the
Cross of Christ is a dignified Cross. Then the Cross and sufferings of Christ
are attended with glory and honor. Remember when your hearts begin to startle
at the sufferings and reproaches of Christ, that there is an honorable Title
upon the Cross of Christ. And as it was upon his, so it will be upon your cross
also, if ye suffer for Christ. Moses saw it, which made him esteem the very
reproaches of Christ, above all the treasures of Egypt, Heb. 11.26. How did
the Martyrs glory in their sufferings for Christ! calling their chains of Iron,
chains of Gold; and their Manacles, bracelets.

Cur me non quoque torque donas, and illustris illius ordinis militem non
creas? Thuan. Hist.
I remember it is storied of Ludovicus Marsacus a Knight of France, that when he
with diverse other Christians of an inferior rank and degree in the world,
being condemned to die for Religion, and the Jailer had bound them with chains,
but did not bind him, being a more honorable person than the rest: He was
offended greatly by that omission, and said, why do not you honor me with a
Chain for Christ also, and create me a Knight of that illustrious order?

To you (says the Apostle) it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
believe but also to suffer for his sake, Phil. 1.29. There is a twofold honor
attending the cross of Christ. One in the very sufferings themselves, another,
as the reward and fruit of them. To be called out to suffer for Christ, is a
great honor. Yea, an honor peculiar to the saints. The damned suffer from
Christ, the wicked suffer for their sins. The Angels glorify Christ by their
active, but not by their passive obedience. This is reserved as a special
honor for saints.

And as there is a great deal of honor in being called forth to suffer on
Christ's account; so Christ will confer special honor upon his suffering
saints, in the day of their reward. Matthew. 10.32. He that confesses me before
men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in Heaven. O Sirs, one
of these days the Lord will break out of Heaven, with a shout, accompanied with
Myriads of Angels, and ten thousands of his Saints, those glistering Courtiers
of Heaven. The heavens and earth shall flame and melt before him. And it shall
be very tempestious round about him; the graves shall open; the sea and earth
yield up their dead. You shall see him ascending the awful throne of Judgment,
and all flesh gathered before his face; even multitudes, multitudes that no man
can number. And then to be brought for^h by Christ before that great assembly
of Angels and Saints; and there to have an honorable mention and remembrance
made of your labors, and sufferings, your pains, patience, and self-denial, of
all your sufferings and losses for Christ: and to hear from his mouth, well
done good and faithful servant. O what honor is this! Yet this shall be done
to the man, that now chooses sufferings for Christ, rather than sin: that
esteems his reproaches greater riches, than the treasures of Egypt.

I tell you, it is an honor the Angels have not. I make no doubt but they would
be glad, (had they bodies of flesh as we have) to lay their necks on the block
for Christ. But this is the Saints peculiar privilege. (...).
The Apostles went away from the council rejoyoing that they were honored to
be dishonored for Christ; or as we translate, counted worthy to suffer shame
for him, Act. 5.41. Surely, if there be any stigmata laudis, marks of honor,
they are such as we receive for Christ's sake. If there be any shame that has
glory in it, it is the reproach of Christ, and the shame you suffer for his
name.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
Did Pilate so stiffly assert and defend the honor of Christ, what doubt can
then be made of the success of Christ's interest, and the prosperity of his
cause; when the very enemies* thereof are made to serve it?

Rather than Christ shall want honor, Pilate the man that condemned him, shall
do him honor, And as it fared with his person, just so with his interest also.
How often have the people of God received choice mercies, from the hands of
their enemies? Rev. 12.16. the earth helped the woman, (i. e.) wicked men did
the Church service. So that this may singularly relieve us against all our
despondencies and fears of the miscarriage of the interest of Christ.

That people can never be ruined, who thrive by their losses: conquer by being
conquered: multiply by being diminished. Whose worst enemies are made to do
that for them, which friends cannot or dare not do. See you a Heathen Pilate
proclaiming the honor and innocence of Christ; God will not want instruments
to honor Christ by. If others cannot, his very enemies shall.

Inference 6.
Infer. 6.
Did Pilate vindicate Christ in drawing up such a Title to be affixed to his
cross, then hence it follows; that God will sooner or later, clear up the
innocence and integrity of his people, who commit their cause to him. Christ's
name was clouded with many reproaches. Wounded through and through by the
blasphemous tongues of his malicious enemies. He committed himself to him that
judges righteously, 1 Pet. 2.23. and see how soon God vindicates him. That Is
sweet and seasonable counsel for us, when our names are clouded with unjust
censures, Psalm. 37.5, 6. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him; and
he shall bring it to pass. He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,
and thy Judgment as the noon day. Joseph was accused of incontinency, David of
treason; Daniel of disobedience; Elijah of troubling Israel; Jeremy of
revolting; Amos of preaching against the King; The Apostles of sedition,
rebellion and alteration of Laws; Christ himself of gluttony, sorcery,
blasphemy, sedition: But how did all these honorable names wade out of their
reproaches, as the Sun out of a cloud! God cleared up their honor for them
even in this world. Slanders, says one, are but as soap, which though it soils
and daubs for the present, yet it helps to make the garment more clean and
shining. When hair is shaven, it comes the thicker, and with a new increase. So
when the Razor of censure has (says one) made your heads bare, Mant. in Iam.
p. 227.
and brought on the baldness of reproach, be not discouraged, God has a time
to bring forth your righteousness as the light, by an apparent conviction to
dazel and discourage your adversaries.

The world was well changed, when Constantine kissed the hollow of Paphnutius
eye, which was ere while put out for Christ. Scorn and reproach is but a little
cloud, that is soon blown over. But suppose you should not be vindicated in
this world; but die under a cloud upon your names. Be sure God will clear it
up, and that to purpose in that great day. Then shall the righteous (even in
this respect) shine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father. Then
every detracting mouth shall be stopped. And no more cruel arrows of reproach
shot at the white of your reputation.

Be patient therefore, my Brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. The Lord comes
with ten thousands of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all; and to
convince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have
ungodlily committed. And of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him, Jude. 15. Then they shall retract their censures, and alter
their opinions of the Saints. If Christ will be our Compurgator, we need not
fear who are our Accusers. If your names for his sake be cast out as evil, and
spurned in the dirt; Christ will deliver it you again in that day whiter than
the snow in Salmon.

Inference 7.
Did Pilate give this Title to cast the reproach of his death upon the Jews,
Infer. 7.
and clear himself of it. How natural is it to men to transfer the fault of
their own actions from themselves to others? Q. d. Voluiftis ut Regem vestrum
crucifigerem, crucifixi: vestra post hac erit ignominia qui hoc a me
extorseritis. Calv ad Matthew. 27.37.
For when he writes, this is the King of the Jews, he wholly charges them with
the crime of crucifying their King: and it is as if he had said; hereafter let
the blame and fault of this action lie wholly upon your own heads, who have
brought the guilt of his blood upon your selves and children.

I am clear, you have extorted it from me. O where shall we find a spirit so
ingenious, to take home to it self the shame of its own actions, and charge it
self freely with its own guilt? Indeed it is the property of renewed gracious
hearts to remember, confess, and freely bewail their own evils, N^c enim pudet
sanctos viros, postquam renovata corda fuerint, per resipisce^tiam. Lapsus sui
and dedecoris ad Dei glo^iam meminisse. Nihil nobis decedit, quod redit in
illius honorem. Brightmanus in Cant.
to the glory of God: and that is a gracious heart indeed, which in this case
judges that the glory which by confession goes to the name of his God, is not
so much glory lost to his own name, but it is the power of grace moulding our
proud natures into another thing, that must bring them to this.

The TWENTY EIGHTH Sermon. 28.
SERMON. Opens the manner of Christ's death in respect of the solitariness
thereof.

ZECH. XIII.VII. Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that
is my fellow, says the Lord of Hosts; smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall
be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.


IN the former Sermons, we have opened the nature and kind of the death Christ
died; even the cursed death of the Cross. Wherein, nevertheless his innocence
was vindicated, by that honorable Title providentially affixed to his Cross.
Method now requires that we take into consideration the manner in which he
endured the Cross, and that was solitarily, meekly, and instructively.

His solitude in suffering is plainly expressed in this Scripture now before
us. It cannot be doubted, but the Prophet in this place speaks of Christ if you
consider, Matthew. 26.31. Where you shall find these words applied to Christ by
his own accommodation of them. Then said Jesus unto them, all ye shall be
offended because of me this might, for it is written I will smite the Shepherd,
and the sheep shall be scattered. Besides the Title here given [Gods Fellow] is
too big for any creature in Heaven or Earth beside Christ.

In these words we have four things particularly to consider. First, the
Commission given to the Sword by the Lord of Hosts. Secondly, the person
against whom it is Commissionated. Thirdly, the dismal effect of that stroke.
Fourthly, and lastly, the gracious mitigation of it.

First, The Commission given to the Sword by the Lord of Hosts, Awake, O Sword
and smite, says the Lord of Hosts. The Lord of Hosts, at whose beck and
command all the Creatures are. Who with a word of his mouth can open all the
Armories in the World, and command what weapons, and instruments of death he
pleases. Calls here for the Sword. Not the Rod, gently to chasten. But the
Sword to destroy. The Rod breaks no bones, but the Sword opens the door to
death and destruction. The Strokes and thrusts of the Sword are mortal. (...)
And he bids it awake. It signifies both to rouse up as one that awakes out of
sleep, Evigilavit suscitavit. Buxtorf.
and to rouse or awake with triumph and rejoicing. So the same word is rendered,
Job. 31.29. Yea, he commands it to awake and smite. And it is as if the Lord
had said come forth of thy Scabbard oh Sword of Justice, thou have been hid
there a long time, thou have as it were been asleep in thy Scabbard, now awake
and glitter, thou shall Drink Royal Blood, such as thou never shedst before.

Secondly, The person against whom it is commissionated, My Shepherd, Pastorem
vocat Christum, (...) animarum nostrarum. D. Pareus.
and the man that is my fellow. This Shepherd can be no other than Christ who
is often in Scripture styled a Shepherd, yea, the chief Shepherd, the Prince of
Pastors. Who redeemed, feeds, guides, and preserves the flock of Gods Elect, 1
Pet. 5.4. Ioh. 10.11. This is he whom he also styles the man his fellow. Or his
neighbor as some render it. (...)
And so Christ is in respect of his equality and unity with the Father both in
essence and will. His next neighbor. Et Super virum proxi^um meum. Mont.
His other self. You have the sense of it in Phil. 2.6. He was in the form of
God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God.

Against Christ his fellow his next neighbor the delight of his Soul the sword
here receives its Commission.

Thirdly, You have here the dismal consequent of this deadly (i. e.)
apprehended by his enemies, and then they were scattered, (i. e.) dispersed,
they all forsook him and fled. And so Christ was left alone amidst his enemies.
Not one durst make a stand for him, or own him in that hour of his danger.

Fourthly, And lastly, here is a gracious mitigation of this sad I will turn my
hand upon the little ones. By little ones he means the same that before he
called Sheep; but the expression is designedly varied to show their feebleness
and weakness which appeared in their relapse from Christ. And by turning his
hand upon them, understand Gods gracious reduction and gathering of them again
after their sad dispersion, so that they shall not be lost though scattered for
the present. For after the Lord was risen, he went before them into Galilee, as
he promised, Matthew. 26.31. And gathered them again by a gracious hand, so that
not one of them was lost but the Son of perdition.

The words thus opened I shall observe suitably to the Method I have proposed.

DOCT. That Christ's dearest friends forsook and left him alone, Doct.
in the time of his greatest distress and danger.
This Doctrine containing only matter of fact, and that also so plainly
delivered by the pens of the several faithful Evangelists. I need spend no
longer time in the proof of it, than to refer you to the several Testimonies
they have given to it. But I shall rather choose to fit and prepare it for Use,
by explaining these four Questions, First, Who were the Sheep that were
scattered from their Shepherd, and left him alone? Secondly, What evil was
there in this their scattering? Thirdly, What were the grounds and causes of
it? Fourthly, And lastly, what was the Issue and event of it?


First, Who were these Sheep, that were dispersed and scattered from their
Shepherd when he was smitten. It Is evident they were those precious Elect Souls
that he had gathered to himself, who had long followed him, and dearly Loved
him, and were dearly beloved of him. They were persons that had left all and
followed him, and till that time faithfully continued with him in his
Temptations, Luke 22.28. And were all resolved so to do, though they should die
with him, Matthew. 26.35. These were the persons.

Secondly, But were they as good as their word, did they indeed stick
faithfully to him? No, they all forsook him and fled. These Sheep were
scattered. This was not indeed a Total and final Apostasy, that is the fall
proper to the Hypocrite the Temporary believer, who like a Comet expires when
that earthly matter is spent that maintained the blaze for a time.

These were Stars fixed in their Orb, though clouded and overcast for a time.
This was but a mist or fog which overspreads the earth in the morning till ^he
Sun be risen, and then it clears up and proves a fair day. But though it was
not a total and final Apostasy: yet it was a very sinful and sad relapse from
Jesus Christ, as will appear by considering the following aggravations, and
circumstances of it. For

First, This relapse of theirs was against the very Articles of agreement which
they had sealed to Christ at their first admission into his service, he had
told them in the beginning what they must resolve upon, Luke 14.26, 27. If any
man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and
Brethren, and Sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannnot be my Disciple.
And whosoever does not bear his Cross and come after me, cannot be my Disciple.
Accordingly, they submitted to these terms and told him, they had left all and
followed him, Mar. 10.28. Against this engagement made to Christ they now sin.
Here was unfaithfulness.

Secondly, As it was against the very terms of their admission, so it was
against the very principles of Grace implanted by Christ in their hearts. They
were holy sanctified persons in whom dwelt the love and fear of God. By these
they were strongly inclined to adhere to Christ in the time of his sufferings,
as appears by those honest resolves they had made in the case. Their Grace
strongly inclined them to their Duty, their corruptions swayed them the
contrary way. Grace bid them stand, corruption bid them fly. Grace told them it
was their Duty to share in the sufferings as well as in the glory of Christ.
Corruption represented these sufferings as intolerable, and bid them shift for
themselves whilst they might. So that here must needs be a force and violence
offered to their light, and the loving constraints thereof, which is no small
evil.

For though I grant it was a sudden surprising temptation, yet it cannot be
imagined that this fact was wholly indeliberate, nor that for so long time they
were without any debates or reasonings about their Duty.

Thirdly, As it was against their own principles, so it was much against the
honor of their Lord and Master. By this their sinful flight they exposed the
Lord Jesus to the contempt and scorn of his enemies. This some conceive is
imported in that question which the High Priest asked him, Ioh. 18.19. The High
Priest then asked Jesus of his Disciples, and of his Doctrine. He asked him of
his Disciples, how many he had, and what was become of them now? And what was
the reason they forsook their Master, and left him to shift for himself when
danger appeared? But to those questions Christ made no reply. He would not
accuse them to their enemies, though they had deferted him. But doubtless it
did not a little reflect upon Christ, that there was not one of all his friends
that durst own their relation to him, in a time of danger.

Fourthly, As it was against Christ's honor, so it was against their own solemn
promise made to him before his apprehension, to live and die with him. They had
past their word, and given their promise that they would not flinch from him,
Matthew. 26.35. Peter said to him, though I should dye with thee, yet will I not
deny thee. Likewise also said all the Disciples. This made it a perfidious
relapse. Here they brake promise with Christ, who never did so with them. He
might have told them when he met them afterward in Gallilee. As the Roman
Soldier told his General when he refused his petition after the war was ended,
I did not serve you so at the Battle of Acteum.

Fifthly, As it was against their solemn promise to Christ, so it was against
Christ's heart melting expostulations with them; which should have abode upon
their hearts while they lived. For when others that followed him, went back,
and walked no more with him, Jesus said to these very men that now forsook him
at last, Will ye also go away? There is an Emphasis in [Ye] q. d. What ye that
from eternity were given to me. Ye whom I have called, loved and honored above
others, for whose sakes I am ready and resolved to die. Will ye also forsake
me? Ioh. 6.67. What ever others do, I expect other things from you.

Sixthly, As it was against Christ's heart melting expostulations with them, so
it was against a late direful example presented to them in the fall of Judas.
In him as in a Glass they might see how fearful a thing it is to apostatize
from Christ. They had heard Christ's dreadful threats against him. They were
present when he called him the Son of perdition, Ioh. 17.11. They had heard
Christ to say of him, good had it been if he had never been born. An expression
able to scare the deadest heart. They saw he had left Christ the evening
before. And that very day in which they fled, he hanged himself. And yet they
fly. For all this they forsake Christ.

Seventhly, As it was against the dreadful warning given them in the fall of
Judas, so it was against the Law of Love, which should have knit them closer to
Christ and one another.

If to avoid the present shock of persecution they had fled, yet surely they
should have kept together praying, watching, encouraging, and stengthening one
another. This had made it a lesser evil: but as they all forsook Christ, so
they forsook one another also; For it is said, Ioh. 16.32. They should go every
man to his own, and leave Christ alone (i. e.) says Beza, every man to his own
house, and to his own business. They forsook each other, as well as Christ. O
what an hour of temptation was this!

Eighthly, And lastly, this their departure from Christ was accompanied with
some offense at Christ. For so he tells them, Matthew. 26.31. Cogitant vel ^um
non esse Christum, quem hactenus esse crediderant; cum se defendere ab bostibus
no^ possit, vel no^ esse consultum ejus causa, mortis periculum adire. Par.
All ye shall be offended, because of me this night. The word is (...) you
shall be scandalized, at me, or in me. Some think the scandal they took at
Christ was this, that when they saw he was fallen into his enemies hands, and
could no longer defend himself; they then began to question whether he were the
Christ or no, since he could not defend himself from his enemies. Others more
rightly understand it of their shameful flight from Christ, seeing it was not
now safe to abide longer with him. That seeing he gave himself into their
hands, they thought it advisable to provide as well as they could for
themselves, and some where or other to take refuge from the present storm,
which had over taken him. This was the nature and quality of the fact. We
enquire

Thirdly, Into the grounds and reasons of it. Which were three.

First, Gods suspending wonted influences and aids of grace from them. They
were not wont to do so. They never did so afterward. They would not have done
so now, had there been influences of Power, Zeal, and Love from Heaven upon
them. But how then should Christ have born the heat and burden of the day? How
should he tread the Wine Press alone. How should his sorrows have been extreme,
unmixed and succourless (as it behoved them to be) if they had stuck faithfully
to him in his troubles. No, no, it must not be. Christ must not have the least
relief or comfort from any creature, and therefore that he might be left alone,
to grapple hand to hand with the wrath of God, and of men; the Lord for a time
withholds his encouraging, strengthening influences from them, and then like
Sampson when he had lost his locks, they were weak as other men.

Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, says the Apostle, Ephesians.
6.10. If that be withheld, our resolutions, and purposes melt away before a
temptation, as Snow before the Sun.

Secondly, As God permitted it, and withheld usual aid from them; so the
efficacy of that Temptation was great, yea, much greater than ordinary. As they
were weaker than they were used to be, so the temptation was stronger than any
they had yet met withal. It Is called, Luke 22.53. Their hour, and the power of
darkness. A sisting winnowing hour, verse. 46. O it was a black and cloudy day.
Never had the Disciples met with such a whirlewind, such a furious storm
before. The Devil desired but to have the winnowing of them in that day, and so
would have sifted and winnowed them, that their faith had utterly failed, had
not Christ secured it by his Prayer for them. So that it was an extraordinary
trial that was upon them.

Thirdly, And lastly, that which concurred to their shameful relapse, as a
special cause of it was the remaining corruptions that were in their hearts yet
unmortified. Their knowledge was but little. And their faith not much. Upon the
account of their weakness in grace, they were called little ones in the Text.
And as their graces were weak, so their corruptions were strong. Their Unbelief
and carnal fears grew powerfully upon them.

Do not censure them, Reader, in thy thoughts, nor despise them for this their
weakness. Neither say in thy heart, had I been there as they were, I would
never have done as they did. They thought as little of doing what they did, as
you or any of the Saints do, and as much did their souls detest and abhor it:
but here thou may see whither a soul that fears God may be carried, if his
corruptions be irritated by strong temptations, and God withholds usual
influences.

Fourthly, and Lastly, Let us view the issue of this sad apostasy of theirs.
And you shall find it ended far better than it began. Though these Sheep were
scattered for a time, yet the Lord made good his promise, in turning his hand
upon these little ones to gather them. The morning was overcast, but the
evening was clear.

Peter repents of his perfidious denial of Christ, and never denied him more.
All the rest likewise returned to Christ, and never forsook him any more. He
that was afraid at the the voice of a Damsel, afterward feared not the frowns
of the mighty. And they that durst not own Christ now, afterward confessed him
openly before Councils, and rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer
for his sake, Act. 5.41. They that were now as timorous at Hares, and started
at every sound, afterward became as bold as Lions, and feared not any danger,
but sealed their confession of Christ with their blood. For though at this time
they forsook him, it was not voluntarily, but by surprizal. Though they
forsook, him, they still loved him; though they fled from him, there still
remained a gracious principle in them, the root of the matter still was in
them, which recovered them again.

To conclude, though they forsook Christ, yet Christ never forsook them; he
loved them still: go tell the Disciples, and tell Peter that he goes before
you into Galilee, Mark 16.7. q. d. let them not think that I so remember their
unkindness, as to own them no more: no I love them still.

The use of this is contained in the following Inferences.

Inference 1.
Did the Disciples forsake Christ though they had such strong persuasions and
resolutions never to do it, Infer. 1.
then we see, That self-confidence is a sin too incident to the best of men.
They little thought their hearts would have proved so base and deceitful, as
they found them to be when they were tried. Though all men forsake thee (says
Peter) yet will not I. Good man, he resolved honestly, but he knew not what a
feather he should be in the wind of Temptation, if God once left him to his own
fears.

Little reason have the best of Saints to depend upon their inherent grace, let
their stock be as large as it will. The Angels left to themselves, quickly left
their own habitation, Jude 6. upon which one well observes, that the best of
created perfections are of themselves defectible. Every excellency without the
prop of divine preservation, Mr. Ienkin in Loc.
is but a weight, which tends to a fall. The Angels in their innocence were but
frail, without Gods sustentation; even grace it self is but a creature, and
therefore purely dependent. It Is not from its being and nature, but from the
assistance of some thing without it, that it is kept from annihilation. What
becomes of the stream, if the fountain supply it not? What continuance has the
reflection in the glass, if the man that looks into it turn away his face? The
constant supplies of the spirit of Jesus Christ, are the food, and fuel of all
our graces. The best men, will show themselves but men, if God leave them. He
who has set them up, must also keep them up. It Is safer to be humble with one
Talent, than proud with ten. Yea, better to be a humble worm, than a proud
Angel. Adam had more advantage to maintain his station, than any of you. For
though he were left to the liberty of his own mutable and self-determining
will, yet he was created upright, and had no inherent corruption to endanger
him, yet fell.

And shall we be self-confident after such instances of humane frailty! Alas,
Christian! what match art thou for principalites and powers, and spiritual
wickedness! Be not high-minded, but fear. When you have considered well the
example of Noah, Lot, David and Hezekiah, men famous and renowned in their
generations, who all fell by temptations; yea, and that when one would think
they had never been better provided to cope with them. Lot fell after, yea
presently after the Lord had thrust him out of Sodom, and his eyes had seen the
direful punishment of sin. Genesis 9.21, 22. G^n. 19 36. 2 Samuel 11.2. 2 King.
20.12.
Hell as it were rained upon them out of Heaven. Noah in like manner,
immediately after Gods wonderful, and astonishing preservation of him in the
Ark; when he saw a world of men and women perishing in the floods, for their
sins. David after the Lord had settled the Kingdom on him, which for sin he rent
from Saul, and given him rest in his house. Hezekiah was but just up from a
great sickness, wherein the Lord wrought a wonderful salvation for him. Did
such men, and at such times, when one would think no temptations should have
prevailed, fall; and that so foully. Then let him that thinks he stands, take
heed lest he fall. O be not high-minded, but fear.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Did Christ stand his ground and go through with his suffering-work, when all
that had followed him forsook him. Then a resolved adherence to God and duty,
though left alone, without company or encouragement, is Christ-like, and truly
excellent. You shall not want better company than that which has forsaken you
in the way of God. Elijah complains, 1 Kings 19.10. They have forsaken thy
Covenant, thrown down thine Altars, and slain thy Prophets with the sword; and
I, even I only am left, and they seek my life, to take it away. And yet all
this did not damp, or discourage him in following the Lord; for still he was
very jealous for the Lord God of Hosts.

Paul complains, 2 Timothy 4.16. At my first answer no man stood by me, all men
forsook me: nevertheless the Lord stood with me. And as the Lord stood by him,
so he stood by his God alone, without any aids or support from men. How great
an Argument of integrity is this! He that professes Christ for company, will
also leave him for company. But to be faithful to God, when forsaken of men; to
be a Lot in Sodom, a Noah in a corrupted generation; oh how excellent is it!
It Is sweet to travel over this Earth to Heaven in the company of the Saints
that are bound thither with us, if we can; but if we can meet no company, we
must not be discouraged to go on. It Is not unlike but before you have gone many
steps farther, you may have cause to say as one did once, never less alone,
than when alone.

Inference 3.
Did the Disciples thus forsake Christ, Infer. 3.
and yet were all recovered at last, Then though believers are not privileged
from backslidings, yet they are secured from final apostasy, and ruin. The
new creature may be sick, it cannot die. Saints may fall, but they shall rise
again. Mica. 7.8. The highest flood of natural zeal, and resolution may ebb,
and be wholly dried up; but saving grace is a well of water, still springing up
into everlasting life, Ioh. 4.14. Gods unchangeable Election, the frame and
constitution of the New Covenant, the meritorious and prevalent intercession of
Jesus Christ does give the believer abundant security against the danger of a
total, final apostasy. My Father which gave them me (says Christ) is greater
than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand, Joh. 10.29.

And again, the foundation of God stands sure having this seal; the Lord
knows who are his, 2 Timothy 2.19. Every person committed to Christ by the
Father, shall be brought by him to the Father, and not one wanting.

God has also so framed and ordered the New Covenant, that none of those souls
who are within the blessed clasp, and bond of it can possibly be lost. It Is
settled upon immutable things: and we know all things are as their foundations
be, Heb. 6.18, 19. Among the many glorious promises contained in that bundle of
promises, this is one, I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I
will not turn away from them to do them good: but I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

And as the fear of God in our hearts pleads in us against sin, so our potent
Intercessor in the heavens pleads for us with the Father; and by reason thereof
we cannot finally miscarry, Romans 8.34, 35. Upon these grounds we may (as the
Apostle in the place last cited does) triumph in that full security which God
has given us: and say, what shall separate us from the love of God? Understand
it either of Gods to us, as Calvin, Beza and Martyr do; or of our Love to God,
Ambrose and Augustine do, it is true in both senses, and a most comfortable
truth.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Did the Sheep fly when the Shepherd was smitten; such men, and so many forsake
Christ in the trial? Then learn how sad a thing it is for the best of men to be
left to their own carnal fears in a day of temptation; This was it that made
those good men shrink away so shamefully from Christ in that Trial: the fear of
man brings a snare, Prove. 29.25. in that snare these good souls were taken, and
for a time held fast.

Oh what work will this unruly passion make, if the fear of God do not overrule
it! Is it not a shame to a Christian, a man of faith to see himself out done by
an Heathen? Shall natural Conscience and courage make them stand, and keep
their places in times of danger; when we shamefully turn our backs upon duty,
because we see duty and danger together?

When the Emperor Vespasian had commanded Fluidius Priscus not to come to the
Senate, Char. of Wisdom p. 358.
or if he did, to speak nothing but what he would have him. The Senator
returned this brave and noble answer, that as he was a Senator, it was fit he
should be at the Senate; and if being there, he were required to give his
advice, he would speak freely, that which his Conscience commanded him; The
Emperor threatening, that then he should die; he returned thus, did I ever tell
you that I was immortal? Do you what you will, and I will do what I ought. It
is in your power to put me to death unjustly, and in me to die constantly. O
think, what mischiefs your fear may do your selves, and the discovery of them
to others. O learn to trust God with your lives, liberties and comforts in the
way of your duty; and at what time you are afraid trust in him: and do not
magnify poor dust and ashes, as to be scared by their threats from your God
and duty. The politic design of Satan herein is to affright you out of your
Coverts where you are safe, into the net. I will enlarge this no farther, A
Saint indeed. p. 72, etc.
I have else where laid down fourteen Rules for the cure of this, in what of
mine is public.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
Learn hence, how much a man may differ from himself, according as the Lord is
with him, or withdrawn from him. Christians do not only always differ from
other men, but sometimes from themselves also. Yea, so great is the difference
betwixt himself and himself, as if he were not the same man. And where is he
that does not so experience it? Sometimes bold and courageous, despising
dangers, and bearing down all discouragements in the strength of zeal and love
to God: at another time faint, feeble and discouraged at every petty thing.
Whence is this but from the different administrations of the spirit, who
sometimes gives forth more, and sometimes less of his gracious influence. Th^se
very men that flincht now, when the spirit was more abundantly shed forth upon
them, could boldly own Christ before the Council, and despised all dangers for
his sake.

A little dog if his Master be by, and encourage him, will venture upon a
greater beast than himself. Unus ex Discipulis aliis, non aliquem ex duodecem.
Sed aliam quendam, Hierosolymitanum non aeque manifestum fautore^ I^s^. Grotius.
Though Peter stood at the door without, when the other Disciple, or one of the
other Disciples, (as the Syriack turns it, and Grotius approves it as the best)
that is one of the private Disciples that lived in Jerusalem; went in so
boldly, Ioh. 18.16, 17. We are strong or weak, according to the degrees of
assisting grace. So that as you cannot take the just measure of a Christian by
one act, so neither must they judge of themselves, by what they sometimes feel
in themselves.

But when their spirits are low, and their hearts discouraged, they should
rather say to their souls, hope in God, for I shall yet praise him: it is low
with me now, but it will be better.

Was the sword drawn against the Shepherd, Infer. 6.
and he left alone to receive the mortal strokes of it; How should all adore
both the Justice, and Mercy of God; so illustriously displayed herein! Here is
the Triumph of Divine justice, and the highest Triumph that ever it had, to
single forth the chief Shepherd; the man that is Gods fellow; and sheath its
sword in his breast for satisfaction. No wonder it is drawn and brandished with
such a Triumph, awake rejoycingly, O sword, against my Shepherd, etc. for in
this blood shed by it, it has more glory than if the blood of all the men and
women in the world had been shed.

And no less is the mercy and goodness of God herein signalized, in giving the
sword a commission against the man his fellow, rather than against us. Why had
he not rather said, Awake, O sword, against the men that are my enemies; shed
the blood of them that have sinned against me, than smite the Shepherd, and
only scatter the sheep. Blessed be God the dreadful sword was not drawn and
brandished against our souls; that God did not set it to our breasts; that he
had not made it fat with our flesh, and bathed it in our blood: that his fellow
was smitten that his enemies might be spared. O what manner of love was this!
Blessed be God therefore for Jesus Christ, who received the fatal stroke
himself; and has now so sheathed that sword in its scabbard, that it shall
never be drawn any more against any that believe in him.

Inference 7.
Infer. 7.
Were the Sheep scattered, when the Shepherd was smitten; Learn hence that the
best of men know not their own strength, till they come to the trial. Little
did these holy men imagine such a cowardly spirit had been in them, till
temptation put it to the proof. Let this therefore be a caution for ever to the
people of God. You resolve never to forsake Christ, you do well; but so did
these, and yet were scattered from him. You can never take a just measure of
your own strength, till Temptation have tried it. It Is said, Deuteronomy. 18.2, 3.
that God led the people so many years in the wilderness, to prove them; and to
know (i. e.) (to make them know) what was in their hearts. Little did they
think such unbelief, murmurings, discontents, and a spirit bent to backsliding,
had been in them; till their straights in the wilderness gave them the sad
experience of these things.

Inference 8.
Infer. 8.
Did the dreadful sword of Divine Justice smite the Shepherd, Gods own fellow;
and at the same time the flock from whom all his outward comforts arose, were
scattered from him? Then learn, that the holiest of men have no reason either
to repine, or despond; though God at once should strip them of all their
outward and inward comforts together. He that did this by the man his fellow,
may much rather do it by the man his friend. Smite my Shepherd; there is all
comfort gone from the inner man. Scatter the Sheep; there is all comfort gone
from the outward man. What refreshments had Christ in this world, but such as
came immediately from his Father, or those holy ones now scattered from him? In
one day he^ seth both heavenly, and earthly comforts. Now as God dealt by
Christ, he may at one time or other deal with his people. You have your
comforts from Heaven; so had Christ, in a fuller measure than ever you had, or
can have. He had comforts from his little flock, you have your comforts from
the society of the Saints, the Ordinances of God, comfortable Relations, etc.
Yet none of these are so firmly settled upon you, but you may be left destitute
of them all in one day. God did take all comfort from Christ, both outward, and
inward; and are you greater than he? God sometimes takes outward, and leaves
inward comfort; sometimes he takes inward, and leaves outward comfort: but time
may come when God may strip you of both.

This was the case of Job, a favorite of God, who was blessed with outward, and
inward comforts. Yet a time came when God stripped him of all, and made him poor
to a Proverb, as to all outward comfort; and the venom of his arrows drank up
his spirit, and the inward comforts thereof.

Should the Lord deal thus with any of you, how seasonable and relieving will
the f^llowing considerations be?

First, Though the Lord deal thus with you, yet this is no new thing, he has
dealt so with others, yea with Jesus Christ that was his fellow. If these
things were done in the green tree, in him that never deserved it for any sin
of his own; how little reason have we to complain? Nay, Secondly, Therefore did
this befall Jesus Christ before you, that the like condition might be
sanctified to you, when you shall be brought into it. For therefore did Jesus
Christ pass through such varieties of conditions; on purpose that he might take
away the curse, and leave a blessing in those conditions, against the time that
you should come into them. Moreover, Thirdly, Though inward comforts and
outward comforts were both removed from Christ in one day, yet he wanted not
support in the absence of both. How relieving a consideration is this! Ioh.
16.32. Behold (says he) the hour comes, yea is now come that ye shall be
scatter^d every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: And yet I am not
alone, because the Father is with me. With me by way of support, when not by
way of comfort. Thy God (Christian) can in like manner support thee, when all
sensible comforts shrink away together from thy soul, and body in one day.
Lastly, It deserves a remark, that this comfortless forsaken condition of
Christ, immediately preceded the day of his greatest glory and comfort.
Naturalists observe the greatest darkness is a little before the dawning of the
morning. 'Twas so with Christ, it may be so with thee. It was but a little
while and he had better company than theirs that forsook him. Act therefore
your faith upon this, that the most glorious light usually follows the thickest
darkness. The louder your Groans are now, the louder your Triumphs hereafter
will be. The Horror of your present, will but add to the Lu^ter of your future
state.
The TWENTY NINTH Sermon. 29.
SERMON. Opens the manner of Christ's death, in respect of the Patience thereof.

ISAI. LIII.VII. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted; yet he opened not his
mouth. He is brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a Sheep before her
Shearers is dumb; so he opened not his mouth.


HOW our Lord Jesus Christ carried on the work of our Redemption in his humbled
state, both in his incarnation, life and death, has in part been discovered in
the former Sermons. I have showed you the kind or nature of that death he died:
and am now engaged by the method proposed, to open the manner of his death. The
solitariness or loneliness of Christ in his sufferings, was the subject of the
last Sermon. The patience and meekness of Christ in his sufferings, comes in
order to be opened in this.

Inge^^e pro^iteor illud ipsum caput ad fidem Christianam me adduxisse, nam
plus millies illud caput perlegi. Hornbeck contra Jud. lib. 6. c. 1. p 403.
This Chap^er treats wholly of the sufferings of Christ; and the blessed fruits
thereof. Hornebeck tells us of a Learned Jew that ingeniously confessed this
very Chapter converted him to the Christian Faith. And such del^ght he had in
it, that he read it more than a thousand times over. Such is the clearness of
this Prophecy, that he who Penned it, is deservedly styled the Evangelical
Prophet. I cannot allow time to analize the Chapter, but my work lying in the
seventh verse, I shall speak to these two branches or par^s of it, viz. The
grievous sufferings of Christ, and the glorious ornament he put upon them.

First, Christ's grievous sufferings; he was afflicted, and he was oppressed,
brought to the slaughter, and shorn as a sleep (i.^.) he lost both fleece and
blood. (...)
Life and the comforts of Lif^. He was oppressed, Respona^t. Humsavit. Demisit.
Depr^ssit.
the word signifies both to Answer and oppress, humble or depress. The other
word rendered afflicted, signifies to exact and afflict, (...)
and so implys Christ to stand before God, as a surety before the Creditor;
Exegis. Afflixit. Buxt.
who exacts the utmost satisfaction from him, by causing him to suffer
according to the utmost rigor and severity of the Law. It did not suffice that
he was shorn as a Sheep, (i. e.) that he was stripped and deprived o^ his riches,
ornaments, and comforts; but his blood and life must go for it also. He is
brought to the slaughter. These were his grievous Sufferings.

Secondly, Here is the glorious ornament he put upon those grievous sufferings,
Ut patientiam and manjuetuainem Christi melius commendat tanquam i^ sign ips^
^s ornamentum comparat eum agno and ovi. Mari. in Loc.
even the ornament of a meek, and patient Spirit. He opened not his mouth. But
went as a sheep to be shorn, or a Lamb to the slaughter. The Lamb goes as
quietly to the slaughterhouse, as to the fold. By this lively and lovely
similitude the patience of Christ is here expressed to us. Yet Christ's du^^ness
and silence is not to be understood Simply, and universally; as though he spoke
nothing at all when he suffered: for he uttered many excellent and weighty
words upon the Cross, as you shall hear in the following Discourses; but it
must be understood respectively, (i. e.) he never opened his mouth repiningly,
passionately, or revengefully u^^er his greatest tortures and highest
provocations. Whence the no^e is.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ supported the burden of his sufferings, Doct.
with admirable patience, and meekness of Spirit.
It is a true observation, that meekness inviteth injury, but allways to its
own cost. And it was evidently verified in the sufferings of Christ. Christ's
meekness triumphed over the affronts and injuries of his enemies, much more
than they triumphed over him. Patience never had a more glorious triumph, than
it had upon the Cross.

The Meekness and Patience of his Spirit amidst injuries and provocations, is
excellently set forth in 1 Pet. 2.22, 23. Who did no Sin, neither was guile
found in his mouth. Who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he
suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judges
righteously.

In this point we have these three things to open Doctrinally. First, the
burden of sufferings, and provocations that Jesus Christ was oppressed with.

Secondly, the meekness, and admirable patience with which he supported that
burden. Thirdly, the causes and grounds of that perfect patience which he then
exerc^sed.

First, The burden of sufferings and provocations which Christ Mar. 14.33. He
began to be sore amazed and very heavy. The wrath of an infinite dreadful God
beat him down to the dust. His body full of pain and exquisite tortures in
every part. Not a member or sense but was the ^eat and subject of torment.

His name and honor suffered the vilest indignities, blasphemies, and horrid
reproaches that the mal^gnity of Satan, and wicked men could belch our against
it. He was called a Blasphemer, Seditions, one that had a Devil, a Glutton^ a
Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Hariots. The Carpenters Son, this
fellow. He that was Gods Fellow as you heard lately, now this Fellow. Contempt
was poured upon all his Offices. Upon his Kingly Office, when they crowned him
with Thorns, arrayed him in purple, bowed the knee in mockery to him, and cried
hail King of the Jews. His Prophetical Office, when they blinded him, and then
bid him Prophecy who smote him. His Priestly Office, when they reviled him
upon the Cross, saying, he saved others, himself he cannot save. They scourged
him. Spit in his face. Smote him on the head and face. Besides the very kind of
death they put him to was reproachful and ignominious; as you heard before.

Now all this, and much more than this; meeting at once upon an innocent, and
dignified person. One that was greater than all. That lay in the bosom of God.
And from eternity had his smiles and honors. Upon one that could have crushed
all his enemies as a moth: I say for him to bear all this without the least
discomposure of Spirit, or breach of Patience, is the highest triumph of
Patience that ever was in the world. It was one of the greatest wonders of that
wonderful day.

Secondly, And that is the next thing we have to consider, even this almighty
patience and unpattern'd meekness of Christ, supporting such a burden with such
evenness and steadiness of spirit. Christian patience or the grace Patience, is
an ability or power to suffer hard and heavy things, according to the will of
God.

It is a power, and a glorious power that strengthens the suffering Soul to
bear. It is our passive fortitude, Col. 1.11. Strengthened with all might,
according to the glorious power, unto all patience, and long suffering with
Ioyfulness, (i. e.) strengthened with a might or power, corresponding to the
glorious power of God himself. Or such as might appear to be the proper impress
and image of that divine power, which is both its principle and pattern. For
the Patience which God exercises toward sinners that daily wrong and load him,
is called power, and great power, Number. 14.17. Let the power of my Lord be
great, as thou have spoken, saying, the Lord is long Suffering, forgiving, etc.
Hence it is observed, Prove. 24.10. That the loss or breaking of our patience
under adversity argues a decay of strength in the soul. If thou faint in the
day of adversity, thy strength is small.

Hae duae virtutes, siliset (...) and (...) sunt ilius roboris, and fortudinis
quam spiritus nobis largitur individuae* somites. Daven.
It Is a power or ability in the soul to bear hard, heavy, and difficult things.
Such only are the objects of patience. God has several sorts of burdens to
impose upon his people. Some heavier, others lighter. Some to be carried but a
few hours, others many days. Others all our days. Some more spiritual bearing
upon the Soul. Some more external, touching or punishing the flesh imediatly;
and the spirit by way of Sympathy. And sometimes both sorts are laid on
together. So they were at this time on Christ. His Soul burdened as deep as it
could swim. Full of the sense, the bitter sense and apprehension of the wrath
of God. His Body filled with tortures. In every member, and sense, grief took
up his lodging. Here was the highest exercise of Patience.

It Is a power to bear hard and heavy things according to the Will of God. The
involving of that respect differs patience the Christian grace, from patience
the Moral Virtue. So the Apostle describes it, 1 Pet. 4.19. Let them that
suffer according to the will of God, etc. (i. e.) who exercise patience
graciously, as God would have them.

And then our patience is, (as Christ's most exactly was) according to the will
of God, when it is as extensive, as intensive, and as protensive as God
requires it to be.

First, When it is as extensive as God would have it. So was Christ's patience.
It was a patience that stretched, and extended it self to all and every trouble
and affliction, that came upon him. Troubles came upon him in troops, in
multitudes. It Is said, Psalm. 40.12. Innumerable evils have compassed me about.
Yet he found patience enough to receive them all. It is not so with us. Our
patience is often worn out. And like fick people we fancy if we were in another
Chamber, or Bed it would be better. If it were any other trouble than this, we
could bear it. Christ had no exceptions at any burden his Father would lay on.
His patience was as large as his trouble, and that was large indeed.

Secondly, It Is then according to the will of God when it is as intensive as
God reuqires it to be, ( i. e.) in the Apostles phrase, Iam. 1.4. When it has
it is perfect work, or exercise, when it is not only extended to all kinds of
troubles; but when it works in the highest and most perfect degree. And then
may patience be said to be perfect (as it was in Christ) when it is plenum sui,
and prohibens alieni, full of it self, and exclusive of its opposites. Christ's
patience was full of its self, ( i. e.) it included all that belonged to it. It
was full of submission, peace, and serenity, full of obedience and complacency
in his Fathers Will. He was in a perfect calm. As a Lamb or Sheep (says the
Text) that houls not, opposes not, but is dumb and quiet. And as his external
behavior, so his internal frame and temper of soul was most serene and cal^^.
Not one repining thought against God. Not one revengeful thought against man
once ru^^led his Spirit. Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,
was all the hurt he wished his worst enemies. And as it included all that
belonged to it, so his perfect patience excluded all its opposites. No
discontents, murmurings, despondencies had place in his heart. So that his
patience was a most intensive, perfect patience. And as it was as extensive,
and as intensive, so it was,

Thirdly, As Pr^tensive as God required it to be, (i. e.) it held out to the
end or his ^ryal. He did not faint at last. His ^roubles did not outlive his
patience. He indeed was strengthened with all might unto all patience, and
long-suffering. This was the patience of Christ our perfect pattern. He had not
only patience, but Longanimity,

Thirdly, In the last place let us inquire into the grounds and

First, This admirable patience and meekness of Christ, was the fruit and
offspring of his perfect Holiness. His nature was free from those corruptions,
that ours groan and labor under; otherwise he could never have carried it at
this rate. Take the meek Moses, who excelled all others in that grace; and let
him be tried in that very grace, wherein he excells, and see how unadvisedly he
may speak with his Lips, Psalm. 106.33. Take a Job, whose famous patience is
trumpeted, and resounded over all the world; ye have heard of the patience of
Job. And let him be tried by outward, and inward troubles meeting upon him in
one day; and even a Job may curse the day when he was born. Envy, revenge,
discontent, despondencies, are weeds naturally springing up in the corrupt soil
of our sinful natures. I saw a little Child grow pale with envy, Vid ^elant^m
par^ul^m. Aug.
said Austin. And the Spirit that is in us lusts unto envy, (says the
Apostle) Iam. 4.5. The principles of all these evils being in our natures, they
will show themselves in time of Trial. The old man is fretful and passionate.
But it was otherwise with Christ. His nature was like a pure Crystal Glass
full of pure Fountain water; which though shaken and agitated never so much,
cannot show, because it has no dregs. The Prince of this world comes, and
has naught in me, Joh. 14.30. No principle of corruption, for a handle to
temptation. Our High Priest was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
sinners, Heb. 7.26.

Secondly, The Meekness and Patience of Christ proceeded from the infinite
wisdom with which he was filled. The wiser any man is, the more patient he is.
Hence meekness the fruit, is denominated from patience, the root that bears it,
Iam. 3.13. The meekness of wisdom. And anger is lodged in folly, as its proper
cause, Eccles. 7.9. Anger rests in the bosom of fools. Si nec magnam iram ^ec
frequ^ntem in animo sa ientis locum hab^re credimus; quid est quare no^ ex too
bos affectu ^lium liberemus. Seneca de ira.
Seneca would allow no place for passion in a wise man's breast. Wise men use to
ponder, consider and weigh things deliberately, in their Judgments, before
they suffer their affections and passions to be stirred and engaged. Hence
comes the constancy and serenity of their Spirits. As wise Solomon has
observed, Prove. 17.27. A man of understanding is of an excellent (or as the
Hebrew is) a cool Spirit.

Now wisdom filled the soul of Christ. He is wisdom in the abstract, Pov. 8. In
him are hid all the treasures of wisdom, Col. 2.3. Hence it was that he was no
otherwise moved with the revilings and abuses of his enemies, than a wise
Physician is with the impertinencies of his distempered and crazy patient.

Thirdly, And as his patience flowed from that his perfect wisdom and
knowledge, so also from his foreknowledge. He had a perfect prospect of all
those things from eternity, which befell him afterward. They came not upon him
by way of surprizal. And therefore he wondered not at them when they came, as
if some strange thing had happened. He foresaw all these things long before,
Mark. 8.31. And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected of the Elders, and chief Priests, and Scribes, and be
killed. Yea, he had compacted and agreed with his Father to endure all this for
our sakes, before he assumed our flesh. Hence Isay 50.6. I gave my back to the
siniters, and my cheeks to them that pulled off the hair. I hid not my face
from shame and spitting.

Now look as Christ in Job. 16.4. obviates all future offenses his Disciples
might take at sufferings for his sake, by telling them before hand, what they
must expect. These things (says he) I told you, that when the time shall come
ye may remember that I told you of them. So he foreknowing what himself must
suffer, and had agreed so to do, he bare those sufferings with singular
Patience. Jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him, went
forth and said unto them, whom seek ye? Joh. 18.4.

Fourthly, As his patience sprang from his foreknowledge of his sufferings; so
from his Faith which he exercised under all that he suffered in this world. His
Faith looked through all those black and dismal clouds, to the joy proposed,
Heb. 12.2. He knew that though Pilate condemned, God would Justify him, Isa.
50.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And he set one over against the other. He balanced the glory
into which he was to enter, with the sufferings through which he was to enter
into it. He acted Faith upon God for divine support and assistance under
sufferings; as well as for glory the fruit and reward of them, Psalm. 16.7, 8,
9, 10, 11. I have set (or as the Apostle varies it) I foresaw the Lord always
before me, because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved. Therefore my
heart is glad, and my glory rejoices. There Is Faith acted by Christ for
strength to carry him through. And then it follows, My flesh also shall rest in
hope, for thou will not leave my soul in Hell, neither will thou suffer thine
holy one to see corruption. Thou will show me the path of Life. In thy presence
is fullness of Joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for ever more.
There Is his Faith acting upon the glory into which he was to enter, after he
had suffered these things. This filled him with peace.

Fifthly, As his Faith eyeing the glory into which he was passing, made him
endure all things; so the Heavenliness of his Spirit also filled him with a
Heavenly tranquillity, and calmness of Spirit under all his abuses, and
injuries. It Is a certain truth, that the more heavenly any man's spirit is, the
more sedate, composed, and peaceful. As the higher Heavens (says Seneca) are
more ordinate, Pars su^erior mundi est ordinatio^, ac propinqua syderibus, nec
in nubem cogitur, nec in temp^statem impeliter; ^ec v^rsat^r in turbinem: o^^i
tumultu cart i^fer^ora fulminant. Eodem modo sublimis animus quietus jemper and
in siat^o^e tranquilla col^ocatur. Seneca.
and tranquil. There are neither clouds, nor winds, storms, nor tempests, they
are the inferior Heavens that lighten, and thunder. The nearer the earth the
more tempestuous, and unquiet. Even so the sublime and heavenly mind, is placed
in a calm and quiet station

Certainly that heart which is sweetened frequently with heavenly delightful
communion with God, is not very apt to be imbittered with wrath or soured with
revenge against men. The peace of God does (...) appease and end all strifes
and differences as an Umpire. So much that word, Col. 3.15. Imports. The
heavenly spirit marvelously affects a sedate and quiet breast.

Now, never was there such a heavenly soul on earth, since man inhabited it, as
Christ was. He had most sweet and wonderful communion with God. He had meat to
eat, which others, yea, and those his greatest intimates, knew not of. The Son
of Man was in heaven upon earth, Ioh. 3.13. Even in respect of that blessed
heavenly communion he had with God, as well as in respect of his immense Deity.
And that his heart was in heaven, when he so patiently endured and digested the
pain and shame of the Cross; is evident from Heb. 12.2. For the Joy set before
him, he endured the Cross, despised the shame. See where his eye and heart was,
when he went as a Lamb to the slaughter.

Sixthly, And lastly, as his meekness and patience sprang from the heavenliness
and sublimity of his spirit: so, from the complete and absolute obedience of it
to his Fathers will and pleasure. He could most quietly submit to all the will
of God, and never regret at any part of the work assigned him by his Father.
For you must know that Christ's death in him was an act of obedience, he all
along eyeing his Fathers command and counsel in what he suffered, Phil. 2.7, 8.
Ioh. 18.11. Psalm. 40.6, 7, 8. Now look as the eyeing and considering of the
hand of God in an affliction, presently becalms and quiets a gracious soul; as
you see in David, 2 Samuel 16.11. Let him alone, it may be God has bid him curse
David: so much more it quieted Jesus Christ, who was privy to the design and
end of his Father, with whose will he all along complied; looking on Jews, and
Gentiles but as the Instruments ignorantly fulfilling Gods pleasure, and
serving that great design of his Father. This was his patience, and these the
grounds of it.

Use.
I might variously improve this point but the direct and main Use of it is to
press us to a Christ-like patience in all our sufferings, and troubles. And
seeing in nothing we are more generally defective; and that defects of
Christians herein, are so prejudicial to Religion, and uncomfortable to
themselves: I resolve to wave all other Uses, and spend the remaining time
wholly upon this branch. Even a persuasive to Christians unto all patience, in
tribulations. To imitate their Lamb-like Savior. Unto this (Christians) you
are expressly called, 1 Pet. 2.21.22. Because Christ also suffered for us,
leaving us an example; that we should follow his steps. Who did no sin, neither
was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when
be suffered he threatened not; but committed himself to him that Judges
righteously. Here Is your pattern. A perfect pattern. A lovely and excellent
pattern. Will you be persuaded to the imitation of Christ herein? Methinks I
should persuade you to it. Yea every thing about you persuades to patience in
your sufferings, as well as I. Look which way you will, upward or downward,
inward or outward, backward or forward, to the right hand or to the left; You
shall find all things persuading and urging the Doctrine of Patience upon you.

First, Look upward, when tribulations come upon you. Look to that Sovereign
Lord, that commissionates and sends them upon you. You know troubles do not
rise out of the dust, nor spring out of the ground, but are framed in heaven,
Ier. 18.11. Behold I frame evil, and devise a device against you. Troubles and
afflictions are of the Lords framing, and devising to reduce his wandering
people to himself. Much like that device of Absalom in setting Ioabs field of
Corn on fire to bring Ioab to him, 2 Samuel 14.30. in the frame of your
afflictions you may observe much of divine wisdom in the choice, measure, and
season of your troubles. Sovereignty in electing the instruments of your
affliction. In making them as afflictive as he pleases. And in making them
obedient both to his call in coming, and going when he pleases. Now could you
in times of trouble look up to this Sovereign hand, in which your souls,
bodies, and all their comforts and mercies are; how quiet would your hearts be!
Psalm. 39.9. I was dumb, and opened not my mouth because it is thy doing, 1 Samuel
3.18. It is the Lord, let him do what seems him good. O when we have to do
with men, and look no higher; how do our Spirits swell and rise with revenge,
and impatiency* But if you once come to fee that man as a Rod in your Fathers
hand, you will be quiet, Psalm. 46.10. Be still, and know that I am God, q. d.
consider with whom you have to do. Not with your fellow, but with your God, who
can puff you to destruction, with one blast of his mouth. In whose hand you
are, as the clay in the potters hand. It is for want of looking up to God in
our troubles, that we fret, murmur, and despond at the rate we do.

Secondly, Look downward, and see what is below you, as well as up to that
which is above you. You are afflicted, and you cannot bear it. Oh! no trouble
like your trouble! Never man in such a case as you are. Well, well, cast the
eye of your mind downward, and see who lie much lower than you. Can you see
none on earth in a more miserable state than your selves? Are you at the very
bottom, and not a man below you? Sure there be thousands in a sadder case than
you on earth. What is your affliction? Have you lost a relation? Others have
lost all. Have you lost an Estate, and are become poor? Well, but there be some
you read of, Job 30.4, 5, 6, 7. Who cut up Mallows by the bushes, and Juniper
roots for their meat. They are driven forth from among men, they cried after
them as after a Thief. They dwell in the cliffs of the Valleys, in caves of the
earth, and in the Rocks. Among the bushes they brayed, under the Nettles they
were gathered together. What difference as to manner of Life, do you find
between the persons here described, and the wild beasts, that herd together in
desolate places? Are you persecuted and afflicted for Christ's sake? What think
you of their sufferings, Heb. 11.36, 37. Who had trial of cruel mockings, yea,
moreover of bonds and imprisonments; they were stoned, they were sawn asunder,
were tempted, were slain with the Sword, they wandered about in Sheepskins,
and Goat Skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented. And are you better than
they? I know not what you are, but I am sure these were such of whom the World
was not worthy, verse. 38.

Or are your afflictions more spiritual, and inward? Say not the Lord never
dealt more bitterly with the soul of any, than he has with yours. What think
you of the case of David, Heman, Job, Asaph whose doleful cries by reason of the
terrors of the Almighty, are able to melt the stoniest heart that reads their
stories? The Almighty was a terror to them. The Arrows of God were within them.
They roared by reason of the disquietness of their hearts.

Or are your afflictions outward, and inward together? An afflicted soul, in an
afflicted body? Are you fallen like the Ship in which Paul sailed, into a place
where two Seas meet? Well, so it was with Paul, Job, and many other of those
worthies gone before you. Sure you may see many on earth, who have been, or are
in far lower and sadder states than your selves.

Or if not on earth, doubtless you will yield there are many in Hell, who would
be glad to exchange conditions with you, as bad as you think yours to be. And
were not all these molded out of the same Lump with you? Surely if you can see
any creature below you, especially any reasonable being; you have no reason to
return so ungratefully upon your God, and accuse your maker of severity; or
charge God foolishly. Look down, and you shall see grounds enough to be quiet.

Thirdly, Look inward, you discontented Spirits, and see if you can find
nothing there that may quiet you. Cast your eye into your own hearts. Consider
either the corruptions, or the graces that are there. Cannot you find weeds
enough there, that need such winter weather as this to rot them? Has not that
proud heart need enough of all this to humble it? That carnal heart need of
such things as these, to mortify it? That backsliding, wandering heart need of
all this, to reduce, and recover it to its God? If need be, ye are in
heaviness, 1 Pet. 1.6. Oh Christian, did thou not see need of this before
thou came into trouble? Or has not God shown thee the need of it since thou
wast under the Rod? It Is much thou should not see it: but be assured, if thou
do not, thy God does. He knows thou would be ruined for ever, if he should
not take this course with thee.

Thy corruptions require all this to kill them. Thy Lusts will take all this,
it may be more than this; and all little enough. And as your corruptions call
for it, so do your Graces too. Wherefore think ye the Lord planted the
principles of Faith, Humility, Patience, etc. in your Souls? What, were they
put there for nothing? Did the Lord intend they should lie sleeping in their
drowsy habits? Or were they not planted there in order to exercise? And how
shall they be exercised without tribulations, can you tell? Does not
tribulation work patience, and patience experience; and experience hope! Romans
5.3, 4. Is not the trial of your Faith much more precious, than of Gold that
perishes? 1 Pet. 1.7. O look inward, and you will be quiet.

Fourthly, Look outward, and see who stands by, and observes your carriage
under trouble. Are there not many eyes upon you? Yea, many envious observers
round about you? It was David's request, Psalm. 5.8. Lead me O Lord in thy
righteousness, because of mine Enemies; or as the Hebrew word there might be
rendered, because of mine observers, or watchers. There Is many an envious eye
upon you. To the wicked there can scarcely be an higher gratification and
pleasure, than to see your carriage under trouble, so like their own. For
hereby they are confirmed in their prejudices against Religion, and in their
good opinion of themselves. These may talk and profess more than we, but when
they are tried, and put to it; it appears plainly enough, their Religion
enables them to do no more than we do. They talk of Heavens glory, and their
future expectancies; but it is but talk, for it is apparent enough their hopes
cannot balance a small affliction, with all the happiness they talk of. Oh how
do you dishonor Christ before his enemies! when you make them think all your
Religion lies in talking of it. Consider who looks on.

Fifthly, Look, backward, and see if there be nothing behind you that may hush
and quiet your impatient Spirits. Consult the multitude of experiences past,
and gone. Both your own, and others. Is this the first straight that ever you
were in? if so, you have reason to be quiet, yea, to bless God that has spared
you so long, when others have had their days filled up with sorrow. But if you
have been in troubles formerly, and the Lord has helped you; if you have past
through the fire, and not been burnt. Through the waters, and not drowned. If
God has stood by you, and hitherto helped you. O what cause have you to be
quiet now, and patiently wait for the salvation of God? Did he help you then,
and cannot he do so now? Did he give waters, and cannot he give bread also? Is
he the God of the Hills only, and not the God of the Valleys also? O call to
mind the days of old, the years of the right hand of the most high, These
things I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope, Lam. 3.21. Have you kept no
records of past exp^riences ^ How ungrateful then have you been to your God,
and how injurious to your selves, if you have read them over in such a day as
this, for to that end they were given you.

O when you shall consider what a God he has been to you, at a pinch. How
faithfully Jehovah, ereth has stood by you. That this is not the first time
your hearts and hopes have been Low, as well as your condition; and yet God
has raised you again, surely you will find your present troubles made ligh^,
by a glance back upon your past experiences.

Sixthly, Look forward, to the end of your troubles; yea look to a double end
of them, the end of their duration, and the end of their operation. Look ye to
the end of their duration, and that is fast by you. They shall not be
everlasting troubles, if you be such as fear the Lord. The God of all Grace,
who has called us into his eternal glory, by Jesus Christ, after that ye have
[suffered a while,] make you perfect, 1 Pet. 5.10. These light afflictions are
but for a moment, 2 Cor. 4.18. It is no more comparatively with that vast
eternity that is before you. Alas, what are a few days and nights of sorrows,
when they are past? Are they not swallowed up as a spoonful of water in the
vast Ocean? But more especially look to the end of their operation. What do all
these afflictions tend to, and effect? Do they not work out an exceeding weight
of Glory? Are you not by them made partakers of his holiness? Heb. 12. Is not
this all the fruit to take away your sins? What, and be impatient at this! Fret
and repine because God is this way perfecting your happiness? O ungrateful
soul! Is this a due requital of that love, that disdains not to stoop to so Low
an employment, as to scour and cleanse your souls; that they might be shining
vessels of honor, to all Eternity!

O look forward to the end of your troubles. The end of their duration, and
operation.

Seventhly, Look to the right hand, and see how you are shamed, convinced, and
silenced by other Christians; and it may be such too as never made that
profession you have done; and yet can not only patiently bear the afflicting
hand of God; but are blessing, praising, and admiring God under their troubles;
whilst you are sinning against, and dishonouring him under smaller ones. It may
be you will find some poor Christians that know not where to have their next
bread, and yet are speaking of the bounty of their God; while you are repining
in the midst of plenty. Ah, if there be any ingenuity in you, let this shame
you. If this will not then

Eighthly, Look to your left hand, and there you shall see a sad sight, and
what one would think should quiet you. There you may see a company of wicked,
graceless wretches, carrying themselves under their troubles, but too like your
selves. What do they more, than fret and murmur, despond and sink; mix sin with
their afflictions, when the Rod of God is upon them?

It Is time for thee to leave off, when thou see how near thou art come to
them, whom thou hopest thou shall never be ranked and numbered with. Reader,
such considerations as these I am persuaded would be of singular use to thy
soul at such a time, but above all, thine eyeing the great pattern of patience,
Jesus Christ; whose Lamb-like carriage under a trial with which thine is not to
be named the same day, is here recommended to thee. Oh how should this
transform thee into a Lamb, for meekness also!

The THIRTIETH Sermon. 30.
SERMON. Opens the Instructiveness of the death of Christ in his seven last
words; the first of which is here opened.

LUKE XXIII.XXXIIII Then said Jesus, Father forgive them; for they know not
what they do.


THE manner in which Christ dyed has already been opened in the Solitude, and
Patience in which he dyed. The third to wit the Instructiveness of his Death,
now follows, in these seven excellent and weighty sayings, which dropped from his
blessed Lips upon the Tree; whilst his sacred blood dropped on the earth from his
wounded hands and feet; so that on the Cross he exercised both his Priestly,
and Prophetical Office together; redeeming us by his blood, and instructing us
by his words.

These seven words of Christ upon the Cross are his last words, with which he
breathed out his Soul. The last words of a dying man are remarkable, the
Scripture puts a remark upon them, 2 Samuel 23.1. Now these be the last words of
David. How remarkable then are the last words of Christ?

These words are seven in number; three directed to his Father, and four more
to those about him. Of the former sort this is one, Father forgive them, etc.
In which we have, first, the mercy desired by Christ, and that is forgiveness.
Secondly, the persons for whom it is desired [ Them] that is, those cruel and
wicked persons that were now in brewing their hands in his blood. And Thirdly,
the motive or argument urged to procure that mercy from his Father, for they
know not what they do.

First, The mercy prayed for, that is, forgiveness; Father forgive. (...)
So great a mercy is forgiveness, that David calls him blessed, Felici a^es
hominis. Mort.
or rather admires the blessednesses of him whose transgression is forgiven,
whose sin is covered. This mercy, this best of mercys, he requests for them,
Father forgive them.

Secondly, The persons for whom he requests forgiveness, are

Thirdly, The Motive or Argument urged to procure this for they know not what
they do. As if he should say, Lord, what these poor Creatures do, is not so
much out of malice to me, as the Son of God; but it is from their ignorance.
Did they know who, and what I am, they would rather be nailed to the Cross
themselves, than do it. To the same purpose the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 2.8. Whom
none of the Princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not
have Crucified the Lord of Glory. Yet this is not to be extended to all that
had an hand in the death of Christ, but to the ignorant multitude; among whom
some of Gods Elect were, who afterward believed in him, whose blood they
spilt, Acts 3.17. And now brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it.
For them this Prayer of Christ was heard. Hence the Notes are,

Doct. 1. That ignorance is the usual cause of enmity to Christ.

Doct. 2. That there is forgiveness with God, for such as oppose Christ out of
ignorance.

Doct. 3. That to forgive enemies, and beg forgiveness for them, is the true
Character and property of the Christian Spirit.

These observations contain so much practical truth, that it will be worth our
time, to open and apply them distinctly.

DOCT. 1. That ignorance is the usual cause of enmity to Christ. Doct. 1.

These things (says our Lord) will they do, because they have not known the
Father, nor me, Joh. 16.3. What things does he mean? Why, kill and destroy the
people of God, and therein suppose they do God good service, (i. e.) think to
oblige and gratify the Father, by their butchering his Children. So Ier. 9.3.
They proceed from evil, to evil; and have not known me says the Lord, q. d.
had they the knowledge of God, that would check and stop them in their ways of
wickedness, and so Psalm. 74.20. The dark places of the earth, are full of the
habitations of cruelty.

Three things must be inquired into, sc. what their ignorance of Christ was.
Whence it was. And how it disposed them to such enmity against him.

First, What was their ignorance, who Crucified Christ? Ignorance is twofold,
simple, or respective. Simple ignorance is not supposeable in these persons,
(...).
for in many things they were a knowing people. But it was a respective
particular ignorance, Romans 11.25. Blindness in part, is happened to Israel.
They knew many other truths, but did not know Jesus Christ. In that their eyes
were held. Natural light they had. Yea, and Scripture light they had. But in
this particular, that this was the Son of God, the Savior of the world;
therein they were blind and ignorant.

But how could that be? Had they not heard at least of his miraculous

It Is true indeed, they knew the Scriptures, and it cannot but be supposed the
fame of his mighty works had reached their ears; but yet,

First, Though they had the Scriptures among them, they misunderstood them; and
did not rightly measure Christ by that right rule. You find Ioh. 7.52. How they
reason with Nicodemus against Christ, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and
see; for out of Galilee arises no Prophet. Here is a double mistake. First,
they supposed Christ to arise out of Galilee, whereas he was of Bethlehem,
though much conversant in the parts of Galilee. And secondly, they thought
because they could find no Prophet had arisen out of Galilee, therefore none
should.

Another mistake that blinded them about Christ, was from their conceit that
Christ should not die, but live for ever, Ioh. 12.34. We have heard out of the
Law, that Christ abides for ever; and how say thou the Son of man must be
lifted up? Who is the Son of man? That Scripture which probably they urge
against the mortality of Christ, is Esa, 9.7. Of the increase of his Government
and peace there shall be no end, upon the Throne of David, etc. In like manner,
Ioh. 7.27. We find them in another mistake, We know this man whence he is, but
when Christ comes, no man knows whence he is. This likely proceeded from
their misunderstanding of Mica. 5.2. His going forth have been from of old,
from everlasting. Thus were they blinded about the person of Christ by
misinterpretations of Scripture-Prophesies.

Secondly, Another thing occasioning their mistake of Christ was the outward
meanness, and despisableness of his condition. They expected a pompous Messiah,
one that should come with State, and Glory becoming the King of Israel. But
when they saw him in the form of a Servant, coming in poverty, not to be
ministered unto, but to minister: they utterly rejected him, We hid as it were
our faces from him, he was despised, and we esteemed him not, Isa. 53.3. Nor is
it any great wonder these should be scandalized at his poverty. When the
Disciples themselves, had such carnal apprehensions of his Kingdom, Mar. 10.37,
38.

Thirdly, Add to this their implicit faith in the Learned Rabbis and Doctors,
who utterly misled them in this matter, and greatly prejudiced them against
Christ. Lo (say they) he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the
Rulers know inde^d that this is the very Christ? They pinned their faith upon
the Rulers sleeves, and suffered them to carry it whether they would. This was
their ignorance, and these its causes.

Thirdly, Let us see in the next place, how this disposed them to such enmity
against Christ. And this it does three ways, First, Ignorance disposes men to
enmity and opposition to Christ, by removing those hindrances that would
otherwise keep them from it. As checks and rebukes of conscience, by which they
are restrained from evil; but conscience binding and reproving in the Authority
and virtue of the Law of God; where that Law is not known, there can be no
reproofs, and therefore we truly say, that ignorance is virtually every sin.
Secondly, Ignorance enslaves and subjects the soul to the Lusts of Satan; he is
the Ruler of the darkness of this world, Ephesians. 6.12. There is no work so base
and vile, but an ignorant man will undertake it. Thirdly, Nay, which is more,
if a man be ignorant of Christ, his truths, or people; he will not only oppose
and persecute; but he will also do it conscientiously, (i. e.) he will look
upon it as his duty so to do, Ioh. 16.3. Before the Lord opened Paul's eyes, he
verily thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Christ.
Thus you have a brief account what, and whence their ignorance was, and how it
disposed and prepared them for this dreadful work. Hence we learn,


Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
How falsely is the Gospel charged as the cause of discord and trouble in the
world. It Is not light, but darkness that makes men fierce and cruel. As light
increases so does peace, Isa. 11.6, 9. The Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb,
and the Leopard lie down with the Kid; and the Calf and the young Lion, and the
fatling together; and a little Child shall lead them, they shall not hurt, nor
destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea. What a sad condition would the world
be in without Gospel light! All places would be dens of rapine, and mountains
of prey. Certainly we owe much of our Civil Liberty, and outward tranquillity
to Gospel light. If a sword, and variance at any time follow the Gospel, it is
but an accidental not a direct and proper effect of it.

Inference 2.
How dreadful is it to oppose Christ and his truths knowingly, Infer. 2,
and with opened eyes? Christ pleads their ignorance as an Argument to procure
their pardon. Paul himself was once filled with rage and madness, against
Christ and his truths. It was well for him he did it ignoran^ly. Had he gone
against his light and knowledge, there had been little hope of him, 1 Timothy
1.13. I was a Blasphemer, a Persecutor; and injurious; but I obtained mercy,
because I did it ignorantly, and in unbelief. I do not say it is simply
impossible for one that knowingly, and maliciously opposes and persecutes
Christ and his people, to be forgiven, but it is not usual, Heb. 6.4, 5. There
are few instances of it.

Inference 3.
What an aweful Majesty sits upon the brow of holiness, Infer. 3.
that few dare to oppose it that see it! There are few or none so daringly
wicked, to fight against it with open eyes, 1. Pet. 3.13. Who will harm you
whilst ye are followers of that which is good, q. d. who dare be so hardy to
set upon known godliness, or afflict and wrong the known friends of it. The
true reason why many Christians speed so bad, is not because they are godly,
but because they do not manifest the power of godliness more than they do.
Their lives are so like the lives of others, that they are often mistaken for
others. Cyprian brings in the wicked of his time thus scoffing at Professors.
Ecce qui Iactant se redemptos a Tyran^ide Satanae qui praedicant se moruos
mundo, nihilominus cupiditatibus vincuntur. Cypri,
Behold they that boast themselves to be redeemed from the tyranny of Satan,
and to be dead to the world; how are they overcome by the Lusts of it, as well
as other men. Look as the poverty and meanness of Christ's outward condition was
a ground of their mistake of him then, so the poverty and meanness of our love
to God, heavenly mindedness, and mortification to this world, is a disguise to
professors, and a cause why they are no more owned, and honored in the
Consciences of men at this day. For holiness manifested in its power, is so
awefully glorious, that the Consciences of the vilest cannot but honor it, and
do obeisance to it. Mark 6.20. Herod feared John, for he was a just man.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4. Multi m^^i occurrunt vino d^diti, Libidi^osi, ingrati, multi furiis
ambitioni^ agitati; omnia ista^tam propitius aspiciet sapiens, quam aegros suos
medicus. Seneca de ira.
The enemies of Christ are objects of pity. Alas they are blind, and know not
what they do. It Is pity that any other affection than pity, should stir in our
hearts toward them. Were their eyes but open, they would never do as they do.
We should look upon them as the Physician does upon his sick distempered
Patient. Did they but see with the same light you do, they would be as far from
hating Christ or his ways as you are Simul ac desinunt ignorare, desinunt
odisse, as soon as they cease to be ignorant, they cease to hate says
Tertullian.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
How needful is it before we engage our selves against any person or way, to be
well satisfied and resolved that it is a wicked person or practice that we
oppose? You see the world generally runs upon a mistake in this matter. O
beware of doing you know not what. For though you do you know not what, Satan
knows what he is doing for you. He blinds your eyes, and then sets you to work,
knowing that if you should but see what you are doing, you would rather die,
than do it. You may now do you know not what; but you may afterward have time
enough to reflect on, and lament what you have done. You may now do you know
not what, and hereafter you may not know what to do. O beware therefore what
you do.

DOCT. 2. That there is forgiveness with God, Doct. ^.
for such as oppose Christ out of ignorance.
If all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men, then this as well
as others. Matthew. 12.31. We are not with Theophilact to understand that place
of the certainty of pardon: much less with Origin of the desert of it: nor yet
with Iansenius of the facility of it, but rather of the possibility of
forgiveness. It shall be so to some, it may be so to you: even those whose
wicked hands had crucified Christ, receive remission by that blood they shed.
Act. 2.23, 38. compared.

I have two things here to do, First, To open the nature of forgiveness, and
show you what it is. Secondly, To evince the possibility of it, for such as
mistakingly oppose Christ.

For the First, Forgiveness is Gods gracious discharge of a believing

It Is Gods discharge: There is indeed a fraternal forgiveness, by which one man
forgives another; so far as he is interessed in the wrong, Luke 6.37. there is
also a ministerial forgiveness, whereby the minister of Christ as his mouth,
and in his name declares the pardon, or ministerially applies the promises of
pardon to penitent offenders, Ioh. 20.23. but none can absolutely, and properly
forgive sin, but God only: Mark 2.7. the primary and principal wrong is done to
him: Psalm 51.4. Against thee, thee only, (i. e.) thee mainly or especially, I
have sinned. Hence sins are metonymically called debts, debts to God, Matthew.
6.12. not that we owe them to God, or ought to sin against him; but as a
pecuniary debt obliges him that owes it, to the penalty, if he satisfy not for
it; so do our sins. And who can discharge the Debtor, but the Creditor?

It Is a gracious act or discharge. 1, even I am he that blotteth out thy
transgression for mine own name sake, Isai. 43.25. And yet sin is not so
forgiven, as that God expects no satisfaction at all; but as expecting none
from us, because God has provided a surety for us, from whom he is satisfied.
Ephesians. 1.7. In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, according to the riches of his grace.

It Is a gracious discharge from the guilt of sin. Guilt is that which pardon
properly deals with. Guilt is an obligation to punishment. Pardon is the
dissolving of that obligation. Guilt is a chain with which sinners are bound
and fettered by the Law: pardon is that aquafortis that eats it asunder, and
makes the prisoner a freeman. The pardoned soul is a discharged soul. Romans
8.33. Who shall lay anything to the charge of Gods Elect? It Is God that
justifies, who shall condemn? It Is Christ that died.

It Is Gods discharge of a believing penitent sinner. Infidelity and impenitency
are not only sins in themselves, but such sins as bind fast all other sins upon
the soul. By him all that believe are justified from all things, Act. 10.43. So
Act. 3.19. Repent therefore, that your sins may be blotted out. This is the
method in which God dispenses pardon to sinners. Lastly,

It is for Christ's sake we are discharged; he is the meritorious cause of our
remission. As God for Christ's sake has forgiven you, Ephesians. 4.32. It Is his blood
alone that meritoriously procures our discharge.

This is a brief, and true account of the nature of forgiveness.

Secondly, Now to evince the possibility of forgiveness, for such as ignorantly
oppose Christ. Let these things be weighed.

First, Why should any poor soul that is now humbled for its enmity to Christ
in the days of ignorance, question the possibility of forgiveness: when this
effect does not exceed the power of the cause; nay when there is more efficacy
in the blood of Christ the meritorious cause, than is in the effect of it.
There Is power enough in that blood not only to pardon thy sins, but the sins of
the whole world, were it actually applied. 1 John 2.2. There is not only a
sufficiency, but also a redundancy of merit, in that precious blood. Surely
then thy enmity to Christ, especially before thou knew him, may not look
like an unpardonable iniquity in thine eyes.

Secondly, And as this sin exceeds not the power of the meritorious cause of
forgiveness; so neither is it any where excluded from pardon, by any word of
God. Nay, such is the extensiveness of the promise to believing penitents, that
this case is manifestly included, and forgiveness tendered to thee in the
promises* Isai. 55.7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him,
and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. Many such extensive promises
there are in the Scriptures. And there is not one parenthesis in all those
blessed pages, in which this case is excepted.

Thirdly, And it is yet more satisfactory, that God has already actually
forgiven such sinners, and that which he has done, he may again do. Yea,
therefore he has done it to some, and those eminent for their enmity to
Christ, that others may be encouraged to hope for the same mercy when they also
shall be in the same manner humbled for it. Take one famous instance of many;
it is that of Paul in 1 Timothy 1.13, 16. Who was before a blasphemer, a
persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in
unbelief -- howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
Christ might show forth all long suffering, for a pattern to them which should
hereafter believe on him to everlasting life. It Is no small encouragement to a
sick man, to hear of some that have been recovered out of the same disease, and
that prevailing in an higher degree, than in himself.

Fourthly, Moreover, It is encouraging to consider that when God has cut off
others in the way of their sin, he has hitherto spared thee. What speaks this
but a purpose of mercy to thy soul? Thou should account the long suffering of
God thy Salvation, 2 Pet. 3.15. Had he smitten thee in the way of thy sin and
enmity to Christ, what hope had remained? But in that he has not only spared
thee, but also given thee a heart ingenuously ashamed, and humbled for thy
evils; does not this speak mercy for thee? Surely it looks like a gracious
design of love to thy soul.

Inference 1.
And is there forgivenss with God for such as have been enemies to Christ,
Infer. 1.
his truths, and people. Then certainly there is pardon and mercy for the
friends of God, who involuntarily fall into sin, by the surprisals of
temptation, and are broken for it as ingenious children for offending a good
Father. Can any doubt, if God have pardon for enemies, he has none for
children? If he have forgiveness for such as shed the blood of Christ with
wicked hands; he has not much more mercy and forgiveness for such as love
Christ, and are more afflicted, for their sin against him, than all the other
troubles they have in the world? Doubt it not, but he that receives enemies
into his bosom, will much more receive and embrace children, though offending
ones.

How pensive do the dear children of God sometimes sit, after their lapses into
sin? Will God ever pardon this? Will he be reconciled again! May I hope his
face shall be to me as in former times? Pensive soul, if thou did but know
the largeness, tenderness, freeness of that grace which yearns over enemies;
and has given forth thousands, and ten thousands of pardons to the worst of
sinners; thou would not sink at that rate.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Is there pardon with God for enemies, how inexcusable then are all they that
persist and perish in their enmity to Christ! Sure their destruction is of
themselves. Mercy is offered to them if they will receive it. Isai. 55.7.
Proclamation is made in the Gospel. That if there be any among the enemies of
Christ, who repent of what they have been, and done against him; and are now
unfeignedly willing to be reconciled, upon the word of a King, he shall find
mercy. But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such
a one as go^th on still in his trespasses. Psalm. 68.21. If he turn not, he will
whet his sword, he has bent his bow and made it ready, he has also prepared
for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the
persecutors, Psalm. 7.12.

This lays the blood of every man that perishes in his enmity to Christ, at
his own door. And vindicates the righteousness of God in the severest strokes
of wrath upon them. This also will be a cutting thought to their hearts
eternally. I might once have had pardon, and I refused it. The Gospel-Trumpet
sounded a parley. Fair and gracious terms were offered, but I rejected them.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
Is there mercy with God and forgiveness even for his worst enemies upon their
submission, how unlike to God then are all implacable spirits! Est vi^dicta
bo^um (...) a j^cundius ip^^.
Some there are that cannot bring their hearts to forgive an enemy: to whom
revenge is sweeter than life, 1 Samuel 24.16. If a man find his enemy, will he
let him go? This is Hellfire, a fire that never goes out; how little do such
poor creatures consider, if God should deal by them, as they do by others; what
words could express the misery of their condition! It Is a sad sin, and a sad
sign; a character of a wretched state, wherever it appears. Those that have
found mercy, should be ready to show mercy: and they that expect mercy
themselves, should not deny it others.

This brings us upon the third and last observation, viz.

DOCT. 3. That to forgive enemies, Doct. 3.
and beg forgiveness for them, is the true character and property of the
Christian spirit.
Thus did Christ, Father, forgive them. And thus did Stephen in imitation of
Christ. Act. 7.59, 60. And they stoned Stephen calling upon God, and saying,
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit: and he kneeled down, and cried with a loud
voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. This suits with the rule of
Christ, Matthew. 5.44, 45. But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that
curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which d^spightfully
use you and persecute you: That ye may be the children of God your Father which
is in Heaven.

Here I shall first open the nature of this duty, and show you what a forgiving
spirit is; and then the excellency of it: how well it becomes all that call
themselves Christians.

First, Let us enquire what this Christian forgiveness is. And

First, It consists not in a stoical insensibility of wrongs and injuries. God
has not made men as insensible stupid blocks, that have no sense or feeling of
what is done to them. Nor has he made a Law inconsistent with their very
natures that are to be governed by it. But allows us a tender sense of natural
evils, though he will not allow us to revenge them by moral evils. Nay, the
more deep and tender our resentments of wrongs and injuries are, the more
excellent is our forgiveness of them: so that a forgiving spirit does not
exclude sense of injuries, but the sense of injuries graces the forgiveness of
them.

Secondly, Christian forgiveness is not a politic concealment of our wrath,
Ma^tt alta m^nte repos^^m.
and revenge, because it will be a reproach to discover it; or because we want
opportunity to vent it. This is carnal policy, not Christian meekness. So far
from being the mark of a grati^us spirit, that it is apparently the sign of a
vile nature. It is not Christianity to repose, but depose injuries.

Thirdly, Nor is it that moral virtue, for which we are beholding to an easier
and better nature, and the help of moral rules and documents. There are certain
virtues attainable without the change of nature, which they call Homilitical
virtues, because they greatly adorn and beautify nature; such as temperance,
patience, justice, etc. these are of singular use to conserve peace and order
in the world. And without them (as one aptly speaks) the world would soon break
up, and its civil scocieties disband. But yet though these are the ornaments of
nature, they do not argue the change of nature. All graces in the exercise of
them, involve a respect to God. And for the being of them, they are not by
natural acquisition, but supernatural infusion.

Fourthly, and Lastly, Christian forgiveness is not an ^injurious giving up of
our rights and properties, to the Lusts of every one that has a mind to invade
them. No: these we may lawfully defend and preserve, and are bound so to do;
though if we cannot defend them legally, we must not avenge our wrongs
unchristianly. This is not Christian forgiveness. But then positively;

It is a Christian lenity, or gentleness of mind; not retaining, but freely
passing by the injuries done to us: in obedience to the command of God.

It is a lenity, or gentleness of mind. The grace of God demulces the angry
stomach; calms the tumultuous passions; new-moulds our sour spirits, and makes
them benign, gentle and easy to be entreated. Gal. 5.22. The fruit of the
spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, etc.

This gracious lenity inclines the Christian to pass by injuries: so to pass
them by, as neither to retain them revengefully in the mind, or requite them
when we have opportunity with the hand. Yea, and that freely, not by
constraint, because we cannot avenge our selves but willingly. We abhor to do
it when we can. So that as a carnal heart thinks revenge its glory, the
gracious heart is content that forgiveness should be his glory. I will be even
with him says nature. I will be above him, says grace. It is his glory to
pass over transgression. Prove. 19.11.

And this it does in obedience to the command of God: their own nature inclines
them another way. The spirit that is in us lusts to envy, but he gives more
grace, James 4.5. It lusts to revenge, but the fear of God represses those
motions. Such considerations as these, God has forbidden me. Yea, and God has
forgiven me, as well as forbidden me, prevail upon him, when nature urges to
revenge the wrong. Be kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one
another, even as God for Christ's sake, has forgiven you, Ephesians. 4.32. This is
forgiveness in a Christian sense.

Secondly, And that this is excellent, and singularly becoming

This speaks your Religion excellent, that can mould your hearts into that
heavenly frame to which they are so averse, yea contrarily disposed by nature.
It is the glory of Pagan morality that it can abscondere vitia, hide and cover
men's lusts, and passions. But the glory of Christianity lies in this, that it
can abscind^re vitia, not hide, but destroy, and really mortify the Lusts of
nature. Would Christians but live up to the excellent principles of their
Religion, Christianity shall be no more out-vied by heathenish morality. The
greatest Christian shall be no more challenged to imitate Socrates, Non
praestat fides, quod praestitit infidelit^s. Cecilius in Minucius.
if he can. We shall utterly Spoil that proud boast, that the faith of
Christians is outdone by the infidelity of Heathens. O Christians, yield not
the day to Heathens. Let all the world see the true greatness, heavenliness,
and excellency of your represented pattern; and by true mortification of your
corrupt natures, enforce an acknowledgement from the world, that a greater than
Socrates is here. Veritas Christianorum pulchrior est Helena Graecorum.
He that is really a meek, humble, patient, heavenly Christian wins this glory
to his Religion, that it can do more than all other principles, and rules in
the world. In nothing were the most accomplished Heathens more defective than
in this forgiving of injuries. It was a thing they could not understand, or if
they did, could never bring their hearts to it; witness that rule of their
great Tully. It is the first office of Justice (says he) to hurt no man except
first provoked by an injury. O^ which rule Lactantius thus speaks. O quam
surplicem veramque sententiam d^orum verborum adj^ctione corrupit.
The addition of that exception, spoiled his excellent rule.

But now Christianity teaches, and some Christians have attained it, to receive
evil, and return good. 1 Cor. 4.12, 13. Being reviled, we bless, being
persecuted, we suffer it, being defamed, we entreat. This certainly is that
meekness wrought in us by the wisdom that is from above, Iam. 3.17.

This makes a man sit sure in the Consciences of others, who with Saul must
acknowledge, when they see themselves so outdone; thou art more righteous than
I, 1 Samuel 24.16, 17. had we been so injured, and had such opportunities to
revenge them, we should never have passed them by, as these men did.

This impresses and stamps the very image of God upon the Creature, and makes
us like our heavenly Father who does good to his enemies, and sends down showrs
of outward blessings upon them, that pour out floods of wickedness daily to
provoke him. Matthew. 5.44, 45. In a word, this Christian temper of spirit gives
a man the true possession, and enjoyment of himself. So that our breasts shall
be as the pacifique Sea, smooth and pleasant, when others are as the raging
Sea, foaming, and casting up mire and dirt.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Hence we clearly infer, that Christian Religion exalted in its power, is the
greatest friend to the peace and tranquillity of States and Kingdoms. Nothing
is more opposite to the true Christian spirit, than implacable fierceness,
strife, revenge, tumults and uproars. It teaches men to do good, and receive
evil; to receive evil, and return good. The wisdom that is from above, is first
pure, then peaceable; gentle, and easy to be entreated: full of mercy, and
good fruits; without partiality, and without hypocrisy: and the fruit of
Righteousness is sown in peace, of them that make peace. Jam. 3.17, 18.

The Church is a Dove for meekness, Cant. 6.9. When the world grows full of
strife, Christians then grow weary of the world; and sigh out the Psalmists
request, Oh that I had the wings of a Dove, that I might flee away and be at
rest. Strigelius desired to die, that he might be freed ab implacabilibus odiis
theologorum, from the implacable strifes of contending Divines.

The rule by which they are to walk is, If it be possible, as much us lies in
you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved avenge not your selves, but
rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine, I will
repay it says the Lord, Romans 12.18, 19. It is not Religion, but Lusts that
make the world so unquiet. Iam. 4.1, 2. Not godliness, but wickedness that
makes men bite and devour one another. One of the first effects of the Gospel
is to civilize those places where it comes, and settle order and peace among
men. How great a mistake and evil then is it to cry out, when Atheism, and
irreligion have broken the civil peace; this is the fruit of Religion; this is
the effect of the Gospel. Happy would it be, if Religion did more obtain in all
Nations. It is the greatest friend in the world to their tranquillity and
prosperity.

Inference 2.
How dangerous a thing is it to abuse and wrong meek and forgiving Christians?
Infer. 2.
Their patience and easiness to forgive, often invites injury, and encourages
vile spirits to insult and trample upon them; but if men would seriously
consider it, there is nothing in the world should more scare and afright them
from such practices than this. You may abuse and wrong them, they must not
avenge themselves, nor repay evil for evil; true, but because they do not, the
Lord will; even the Lord to whom they commit the matter; and he will do it to
purpose, except ye repent.

Be patient therefore, Brethren, unto the coming of the Lord, Jam. 5.7. will ye
stand to that Issue? Had you rather indeed have to do with God, than with men.
When the Jews put Christ to death, he committed himself to him that judges
Righteously, 1 Pet. 2.22, 23. And did that people get any thing by that? Did
not the Lord severely avenge the blood of Christ on them, and their Children?
Yea, do not they, and their Children groan under the doleful effects of it to
this day? If God undertakes (as he always does) the cause of his abused, meek
and peaceable people; he will be sure to avenge it seven fold more than they
could. His little finger, will be heavier than their loins. You will get
nothing by that.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
Lastly, Let us all imitate our pattern Christ, and labor for meek forgiving
spirits. I shall only propose two inducements to it. The honor of Christ, and
your own peace. Two dear things indeed, to a Christian. His glory is more than
your life, and all that you enjoy in this world. O do not expose it to the
scorn and derision of his enemies. Let them not say, how is Christ a Lamb, when
his followers are Lions? How is the Church a Dove, that smites and scratches
like a bird of prey? Consult also the quiet of your own spirits. What is life
worth, without the comfort of life? What comfort can you have in all that you
do possess in the world, as long as you have not the possession of your own
souls? If your spirits be full of tumult and revenge, the spirit of Christ will
grow a stranger to you. That Dove delights in clean and quiet breasts. O then
imitate Christ in this excellency also.

The THIRTY FIRST Sermon. 31.
SERMON. Opens the second excellent word of Christ upon the Cross.

JOH. XIX.XXVII. Then says He to the Disciple, Behold thy Mother.


WE now pass to the consideration of the second memorable and instructive Word
of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the Cross, contained in this Scripture. Wherein
he has left us an excellent pattern for the discharge of our relative Dutys.
It may be well said, the Gospel makes the best Husbands and Wives, the best
Parents and Children, the best Masters and Servants in the world; seeing it
furnishes them with the most excellent precepts, and proposes the best
patterns. Here we have the pattern of Jesus Christ presented to all gracious
Children for their imitation, teaching them how to acquit themselves toward
their Parents, according to the Laws of Nature, and Grace. Christ was not only
subject and obedient to his Parents whilst he lived, but manifested his tender
care even whilst he hanged in the torments of Death upon the Cross. Then says
he to the Disciple, Behold thy Mother.

The words contain an affectionate recommendation of his distressed Mother, to
the care of a dear Disciple, a bosom friend, wherein let us consider the
design, manner, and season of this recommendation.

First, The design and end of it, which doubtless was to manifest his tender
respects and care for his Mother, who was now in a most distressed comfortless
state. For now was Simeons Prophecy, Luke 2.35. fulfilled in the trouble and
anguish that filled her soul. Yea, a sword also shall pierce through thine own
soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. Her soul was pierced
for him, both as she was his Mother, and as she was a Mystical member of him,
her head, her Lord. And therefore he commends her to the beloved Disciple that
lay in his bosom, saying, Behold thy Mother, (i. e.) let her be to thee as
thine own Mother. Let thy love to me be now manifested in thy tender care for
her.

Secondly, The manner of his recommending her is both affectionate, and mutual.
It Is very affectionate and moving, Behold thy Mother, q. d. John, I am now
dying; leaving all humane society, and relations. And entering into a new State,
where neither the dutys of natural relations are exercised, nor the pleasures
and comforts of them enjoyed. It Is a state of dominion over Angels and men, not
of subjection and obedience, this I now leave to thee. Upon thee do I devolve
both the honor and duty of being in my stead and room to her as to all dear
and tender care over her.

John, Behold thy Mother; and as it is affectionate, so it is mutual, verse 26.
And to his Mother he said, Woman, behold thy Son; not Mother, but Woman,
intimating not only the change of state and condition with him, but also the
bequest he was making of her to the Disciple with whom she was to live as a
Mother with a Son.

And all this he designs as a pattern to others.

Thirdly, The season or time when his care for his Mother so eminently
manifested it self, was when his departure was at hand, and he could no longer
be a comfort to her by his bodily presence; yea, his love and care then
manifested themselves, when he was full of anguish to the very brim, both in
his soul and body, yet all this makes him not in the least unmindful of so dear
a relation. Hence the Doctrinal Note is.

DOCT. That Christ's tender care of his Mother even in the time of his greatest
distress; Doct.
is an excellent pattern for all gracious Children to the end of the world.
There are three great foundations or bonds of relation on which all family
government depends. (...). Arist.
Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Masters and Servants. The Lord has
planted in the souls of men, affections suitable to these relations, and to his
people he has given grace to regulate those affections appointed dutys to
exercise those graces, and seasons to discharge those dutys. So that as in the
motion of a wheel every spoke takes its turn, and bears a stress, in every
manner in the whole round of a Christians conversation like affection, grace,
and duty at one season or other comes to be exercised.

But yet grace has not so far prevailed in the sanctification of any man's
affections, but that there will be excesses or defects in the exercise of them
toward our relations, yea, and in this the most eminent Saints, have been
eminently defective. But the pattern I set before you this day, is a perfect
pattern. As the Church finds him the best of Husbands, Optimus i^ ^^^quoque
genere, est regula and mens^ra caterorum.
so to his Parents he was the best of Sons, and being the best and most
perfect, is therefore the rule and measure of all others. Christ knew how those
corruptions we draw from our Parents, are returned in their bitter fruits upon
them again to the wounding of their very hearts, and therefore it pleased him
to commend obedience and love to Parents in his own example to us.

It was anciently a Proverb among the Heathen, in sola Sparta, expedit
senescere, It Is good to be an old man or woman only in Sparta, The ground of it
was the strict Laws that were among the Spartans to punish the rebellions and
disobedience of Children to their aged Parents. And shall it not be good to be
an old Father or Mother in England, where the Gospel of Christ is Preached, and
such an argument as this now set before you urged; an argument which the
Heathen world was never acquainted with? Shall Parents here be forced to
complain with the Eagle in the Fable, that they are smitten to the heart, by an
arrow winged with their own Feathers. Or as a Tree rived in pieces by the
wedges that were made of its own body? God forbid.

To prevent such sad occasions of Complaints as these, I desire all that
sustain the relation of Children into whose hands providence shall cast this
discourse, seriously to ponder this example of Christ, proposed for their
imitation in this point. Wherein we shall first consider what dutys belong to
the relation of Children, secondly, how Christ's example enforces those dutys,
and then sutably apply it

First, Let us examine what dutys pertain to the relation of Children. And they
are as truly as commonly branched out into the following particulars.

First, Fear and Reverence are due from Children to their Parents, by the
express command of God, Lev. 19.3. Ye shall fear every man his Mother, and his
Father. The Holy Ghost purposely inverts the order, and puts the Mother first,
because she by reason of her blandishments, and fond indulgence is most subject
to the irreverence and contempt of Children. God has clothed Parents with his
authority. They are instrusted by God with, and are accountable to him for the
souls and bodies of their Children. And he expects that you reverence them,
although in respect of outward estate, or honor you be never so much above
them. Joseph, though Lord of Egypt, bowed down before his aged Father, with his
face to the earth, Genesis 48.12. Solomon, the most magnificent and glorious King
that ever swayed a Scepter when his Mother came to speak with him for Adonijah,
he rose up to meet her and bowed himself to her, and caused a seat to be set
for the Kings Mother, and set her upon his right hand, 1 King. 2.19.

Secondly, Dear and tender Love, is due from Children to their Parents. And to
show how strong and dear that love ought to be, it is joined with the Love you
have for your own lives. As appears in that injunction to deny both for Christ's
sake, Matthew. 10.37. The bonds of nature are strong and strict betwixt Parents
and Children. What is a Child but a piece of the Parent wrapped up in another
Skin? O the care, the cost, the pity, the tenderness, the pains, the fears they
have expressed for you. It Is worse than Heathenish ingratitude, not to return
Love for Love. This filial Love is not only in it self a duty, but to be the
root or spring of all your other dutys to them.

Thirdly, Obedience to their commands is due to them, by the Lords strict and
special command, Ephesians. 6.1. Children obey your Parents in the Lord for this is
right; Honor thy Father, and thy Mother, which is the first Commandment with
promise. Filial obedience, is not only founded upon the positive Law of God,
but also upon the Law of nature. For though the subjection of Servants to
Masters came in by sin, yet the subjection of Children to Parents is due to
them by natural right, therefore says the Apostle this is right, (i. e.) right
both according to natural, and positive Law. However, this subjection and
obedience is not absolute and universal. God has not divested himself of his
own authority, to cloth a Parent with it. Your obedience to them must be in
the Lord, (i. e.) in such things as they require you to do in the Lords
authority. In things consonant to that divine and holy will to which they as
well as you must be subject; and therein you must obey them. Yea, even the
wickedness of a Parent exempts not from obedience, Officium a persona
discerneudum.

A^a^dus genitor, sed praeponendus Creator.


where his command is not so. Nor on the other side must the holiness of a
Parent sway you, where his Commands and Gods are opposite. In the former case,
the Canonists have determined, that the command must be distinguished from the
person. In the latter, it is a good rule. My Parents must be loved, but my God
must be preferred.

Yield your selves therefore cheerfully to obey all that which they lawfully
enjoin, and take heed that black character fixed on the Heathens who know not
God, be not found upon you, disobedient to Parents, Romans 1.30. Remember your
disobedience to their just commands rises higher, much higher, than an affront
to their persons, and authority; it is disobedience to God himself whose
commands second, and strengthen theirs upon you.

Fourthly, Submission to their Discipline, and rebukes is also your duty, Heb.
12.9. We had Fathers of our flesh that corrected us, and we gave them
reverence. Parents ought not to abuse their authority. Saevitia patris in
filios grave pec^atun, sed ira filii in patrem, gra^e monstrum.
Cruelty in them is a great sin, but wrath and rebellion in a Child, against
his Parents, is monstrous. It Is storied of Aelian, that having been abroad, at
his return, his Father asked him what he had Learned since he went from him; he
answered, you will know shortly. I have learned to bear your anger quietly, and
submit to what you please to inflict. Two considerations should especially
mould others into the like frame, especially to their godly Parents. The end
for which, and the manner in which they manifest their anger to their Children.
Their end is to save your souls from Hell. They judge it better for you to hear
the voice of their anger, than the terrible voice of the wrath of God. To feel
their hand than his. They know if you fall into the hands of the living God;
you will be handled in another manner.

And for the manner, in which they rebuke and chasten, it is with grief in
their hearts, and tears in their eyes. Alas, it is no delight to them to cross,
vex, or afflict you. Were it not mere conscience of their duty to God, and
tender love to your souls, they would neither chide, nor smite. And when they
do, how do they afflict themselves, in afflicting you! When their faces are
full of anger, their bowels are full of compassion for you, and you have no
more reason to blame them for what they do, than if they cry out, and violently
snatch at you, when they see you ready to fall from the top of a Rock.

Fifthly, Faithfulness to all their interests is due to them by the natural and
positive Law of God. What in you lies, you are bound to promote, not waste and
scatter their substance. To assist not to defraud them. Who so robs his
Father, or Mother, and says it is no transgression, the same is the companion
of a destroyer, Prove. 28.24. This, says one, as far excells your wronging
another as parricide is a greater crime than manslaughter, or as Reubens
incest, was beyond common fornication. God never meant you should grow up about
your Parents as suckers about a Tree to impoverish the root. Filius ante diem
patrios inquierit in annos.
But for a Child out of a covetousness after what his Parents have, secretly to
wish their death, is a sin so monstrous, as should not be once named, much less
found, among persons professing Christianity. To desire their death from whom
you had your life, is unnatural wickedness, to dispose of their Goods, much
more of your selves without their consent is (ordinarily) the greatest
injustice to them. Children are obliged to defend the Estates and persons of
their Parents with the hazard of their own. As arrows are in the hand of a
mighty man, so are Children of the youth. Happy is the man that has his quiver
full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemy in
the gates, Psalm. 127.5.

Sixthly, And more especially, requital of all that love, care, and pains they
have been at for you, is your duty so far as God enables you, and those things
are requitable, 1 Timothy 5.4. Let them learn to show piety at home, and to
requite their Parents. The word is (...), and signifies to play the Stork, to
imitate that creature of whom it is said, that the young do tenderly feed the
old ones, when they are no longer able to fly abroad and provide for
themselves. Hence those that want bowels of natural affection to their
Relations, are said to be (...), Romans 1.30. worse than Storks. O it is a shame
that Birds and Beasts should show more tenderness to their Dams, than Children
to their Parents.

It Is a saying frequent among the Jews, Vel in pistri^^ laborare filium debere,
ut parentibus subve^iat.
a Child should rather labor at the Mill than suffer his Parents to want. And
to the same sense is that other saying, your Parents must be supplied by you,
if you have it, if not, you ought to beg for them, rather than see them perish.
Honorandi parents si habes, si non h^b^s prodis men^icandum.
It was both the comfort and honor of Joseph, that God made him an instrument
of so much succor and comfort to his aged Father, and distressed family, Genesis
47.13. And you are also to know, that what you do for them, is not in the way
of an alms, or common Charity. For the Apostle says; it is but your requiting
them, and that is Justice not Charity. And it can never be a full requital.
Indeed the Apostle tells us, 2 Cor. 12.14. That Parents lay up for their
Children, and not Children for the Parents, and so they ought, but sure, if
providence blast them, and bless you, an honorable maintenance is their due.
Even Christ himself took care for his Mother.

Secondly, You have had a brief account of the duties of this Relation, next
let us consider how Christ's Example, who was so subject to them in his life,
Luke 2.51. and so careful to provide at his death, enforces all those duties
upon Children, especially upon gracious Children. And this it does two ways,
both as it has the obliging power of a Law; and as he himself will one day sit
in Judgment to take an account how we have imitated him in these things.

First, Christ's example in this has the force and power of a Law, yea, a Law
of Love, or a Law lovingly constraining you to an imitation of him. If Christ
himself will be your pattern. If God will be pleased to take Relations like
yours, and go before you in the discharge of relative Duties; Oh how much are
you obliged to imitate him, and tread in all his footsteps! This was by him
intended as a president or pattern to facilitate and direct your Duties.

Secondly, He will come to take an account how you have answered the pattern of
obedience, and tender care he set before you in the days of his flesh. What
will the disobedient plead in that day? He that heard the groans of an
afflicted Father or Mother, will now come to reckon with the disobedient Child
for them. And the glorious example of Christ's own obedience and tenderness for
his Relations, will in that day condemn and aggravate, silence and shame such
wretched Children, as shall stand guilty before his Bar.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Has Jesus Christ given such a famous pattern of obedience and tenderness to
Parents. Then there can be nothing of Christ in stubborn, rebellious, and
careless Children; that regard not the good or comfort of their Parents. The
Children of disobedience, cannot be the Children of God. If providence direct
this to the hand of any that are so, my hearts desire and Prayer for them is,
that the Lord would search their souls by it, and discover their evils to them;
whilst they shall read the following Queries.

First Query, Have you not been guilty of slighting your Parents, by irreverent
words or carriages; the old man, or woman. To such I commend the consideration
of that Scripture, Prove. 30.17. Which methinks should be to them as the hand
writing that appeared upon the plaster of the Wall, to Belteshazar. The eye
that mocketh at his Father, and despises to obey his Mother: The Ravens of the
Valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it. That is they shall
be brought to an untimely end, and the Birds of the air shall eat that eye,
that had never seen but for that Parent that was despised by it.

It may be you are vigorous and young, they decayed, and wrinkled with Age. But
says the Holy Ghost, despise not thy Mother when she is old, Prove. 23.22. Or
when she is wrinkled, as the Hebrew signifies. (...)
It may be you are rich, they poor; own and honor them in their poverty, and
despise them not. God will requite it with his hand if you do.

Second Query, Have you not been disobedient to the commands of Parents? A Son
of Belial is a Son of wrath, if God give not Repentance to life. Is not this
the black brand set upon the Heathens, Romans 1.30. Have not many repented this
upon a Ladder, with an halter about their necks? Woe to him that makes a Father
or Mother complain as the Tree in the Fable, that they are cloven assunder with
the wedges that are cut out of their own bodies.

Third Query, Have you not risen up rebelliously against, and hated your
Parents for chastening your bodies, to save your souls from Hell? Some Children
(says one) will not take that from a Parent, which Beasts, yea, and salvage
Beasts too; Bears, and Lions will take from their keepers. What is this but to
resist an Ordinance of God for your good? And in rebelling against them to
rebel against the Lord? Well, if they do not, God will take the Rod into his
own hand; and him you shall not resist.

Fourth Query, Have you not been unjust to your Parents, and defrauded them?
First help to make them poor, and then despise them because they are poor. O
horrid wickedness! What a complicated evil is this! Thou art in the Language of
Scripture a companion with destroyers, Prove. 28.24. This is the worst of theft
in Gods account. You think you may make bold with them, but how bold do you
make with conscience, and the command of God?

Fifth Query, Are you not, or have you not been ungrateful to Parents? Leaving
them to shift for themselves in those straights that you have helped to bring
them into. Oh consider it, Children, this is an evil which God will surely
avenge, except ye repent. What to be hardened against thine own flesh! To be
cruel to thine own Parents, that with so much tenderness fed thee, when else
thou had perished! I remember Luther gives us a story of one (and oh that it
might be a warning to all that hear it) who having made over all he had to his
Son, reserving only a maintenance for himself; at last his Son depised him, and
grudged him the very meat he eat, and one day the Father coming in when the Son
and his Wife were at dinner upon a Goose, they shuffled the meat under the
Table; but see the remarkable vengeance of God, upon this ungracious, unnatural
Son; the Goose was turned into a monstrous Toad which seized upon this vile
wretch and killed him. If any of you be guilty of these evils, to humble you
for them, and reclaim you from them, I desire these six Considerations may be
laid to heart.

First, That the effects of your obedience, or disobedience will stick upon you
and yours to many generations. If you be obedient Children in the Lord, both
you and yours, may reap the fruits of that your obedience in multitudes of
sweet mercies for many generations. So runs the Promise, Ephesians. 6.23. Honor thy
Father and Mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be
well with thee, and thou may live long on the earth. You know what an eye of
favor God cast upon the Recabites for this, Ier. 35.8. from the 14. to the 20.
verse: and as his blessings are by promise entailed on the obedient, so his
curse upon the disobedient, Prove. 20.20. Whosoever curses his Father or his
Mother; his Lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness, (i. e.) the Lamp of his
life quenched by death, yea say others, and his soul also by the blackness of
darkness in Hell.

Secondly, Though other sins do, this sin seldom escapes exemplary punishment,
even in this world. Our English History tells us of a Yeoman of Leicestershire,
who had made over all he had to his Son, to prefer him in marriage, reserving
only a bare maintenance at his Sons Table. Afterward upon some discontent, the
Son bid his Father get out of his House. The next day Mr. Goodman the Minister
of the Parish meeting the young man, walking about his ground, asked him how he
did, he answered, very well; but before the Minister was gone far from him, his
bowels fell out, which he carried in his hands, got to his house, sent for Mr.
Goodman, bitterly bewailed his sin against his Father, and so died. And Dr.
Tailor in his great exemplar tells us of another, that upon discontent with his
Father, wished the House might be on fire, if ever he came any more into his
Fathers House. Afterward coming in, it was fired indeed, and this wicked Son
only consumed. I could multiply instances of this nature, (for indeed the
Righteous Judgment of God has multiplied them). But this only for a taste.

Thirdly, Heathens will rise up in Judgment against you, and condemn you. They
never had such precepts, nor presidents as you, and yet some of the better
natured Heathens would have rather chosen death, than to do as you do. You
remember the story of Croesus his dumb son, whose dear affections could make
him speak when he saw Croesus in danger; though he never spoke before, yet then
he could cry out, O do not kill my Father: But what speak I of Heathens, the
Stork in the heavens, yea, the Beasts of the earth will condemn the
disobedience of Children.

Fourthly, These are sins inconsistent with the true fear of God, in whomsoever
they are found. That a man is indeed, which he is in his family, and among his
relations. He that is a bad child, can never be a good Christian. Either bring
testimonials of your godliness from your relations, or it may be well suspected
to be no better than counterfeit. Never talk of your obedience to God, whilst
your disobedience to the just commands of Parents, gives you the lie.

Fifthly, A parting time is coming, when death will break up the family, and
when that time comes, Oh how bitter will the remembrance of these things be!
When you shall see a Father or a Mother lying by the wall, what a cut will it
be to remember your miscarriages, and evils. They are gone out of your reach,
you cannot now if you would give them any satisfaction for what you have done
against them; but oh how bitter will the remembrance of these things be, at
such a time! Surely this will be more insupportable to you than their death, if
the Lord open your eyes, and give you repentance, and if not, then,

Sixthly, What a terrible thing will it be to have a Father, or Mother come in
as witnesses against you at Christ's Bar? As well as they loved you, and as dear
as you were to them in this world; they must give evidence against you then.
Now what a fearful thing is it for you but to imagine your Parents to come
before the Lord, and say, Lord, I have given this child many hundred reproofs
for sin; I have counseled, persuaded, and used all means to reclaim him, but
in vain; he was a child of disobedience, nothing could work upon him? What
think you of this?

Inference 2.
Have you such a pattern of obedience and tender love to Parents, Infer. 2.
then children imitate your pattern, as it becomes Christians; and take Christ
for your example. Whatsoever your Parents be, see that you carry it toward
them becoming such as profess Christ.

First, If your Parents be godly, O beware of grieving them by any unbecoming
carriage. Art thou a Christian indeed, thou will then reckon thy self obliged
in a double bond, both of grace and nature to them. O what a mercy would some
children esteem it, if they had Parents that feared the Lord, as you have!

Secondly, If they be carnal, walk circumspectly, in the most precise and
punctual discharge of your Duties: for how know thou, O Child, but hereby
thou may win thy Parents? Would thou but humbly and seriously entreat, and
persuade them to mind the ways of holiness; speaking to them at fit seasons,
with all imaginable humility and reverence: Insinuating your advice to duties,
or trouble for their evils rather by relating some pertinent History, or
proposing some excellent example; leaving their own Consciences to draw the
conclusion, and make applica^ion, than to do it your selves: it is possible they
may ponder your words in their hearts, as Mary did Christ's, Luke 2.49, 51. And
would you but back all this with your earnest cries to Heaven for them, and
your own daily example; that they may have nothing from your selves to retort
upon you; and thus wait with patience for the desired effect: O what blessed
instruments might you be of their everlasting good!

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
To conclude, let those that have such Children as fear the Lord, and endeavor
to imitate Christ in those days, account them a singular treasure, and
heritage from the Lord: and give them all due encouragement to their duties.

How many have no Children at all, but are as a dry tree! And how many have
such as are worse than none? The very reproaches, and break-hearts of their
Parents; that bring down their hoary heads with sorrow to the grave?

If God have given you the blessing of godly Children, you can never be
sufficiently sensible of, or thankful for such a favor. O that ever God should
honor you to bring forth Children for Heaven! What a comfort must this be to
you, what ever other troubles you meet with abroad; when you come home among
godly relations, that are careful to sweeten your own family to you by their
obedience? Especially what a comfort is it when you come to die, that you leave
them within the Covenant! Entitled to Christ, and so need not be anxious how it
shall be with them when you are gone. Take heed of discouraging, or damping
such Children from whom so much glory is like to rise to God, and so much
comfort to your selves. Thus let Christ's pattern be improved, who went before
you in such eminent holiness in all his relations, and left you an example that
you should follow in his steps.

Sermon. 32.
The THIRTY SECOND SERMON. Opens the third of Christ's last words upon the Cross.

LUKE XXIII.XLIII. And Jesus said unto him, verily I say unto thee, to day
shall thou be with me in Paradise.


IN this Scripture you have the third excellent saying of Christ upon the
Cross, expressing the riches of free grace to the penitent Thief. A man that
had spent his life in wickedness, and for his wickedness was now to lose his
life. His practice had been vile, and profane; but now his heart was broken for
it; he proves a Convert, yea, the first fruits of the blood of the Cross. In
the former verse he manifests his faith, Lord, remember me, when thou come
into thy Kingdom. In this Christ manifests his pardon, and gracious acceptance
of him; verily I say unto thee, to day shall thou be with me in Paradise. In
which Promise are considerable, the Matter of it, the Person to whom it is
made, the Time set for its Performance, and the Confirmation of it for his full
Satisfaction.

First, The Matter or Substance of the Promise made by Christ, viz, that he
shall be with him in Praradise. By Paradise he means Heaven it self, which is
here shadowed to us by a place of delight and pleasure. This is the receptacle
of gracious souls when separated from their bodies. And that Paradise signifies
Heaven it self, and not a third place, as some of the Fathers fondly imagined,
is evident from, 2 Cor. 12.2, 4. where the Apostle calls the same place by the
names of the third Heaven, and Paradise. This is the place of blessedness,
designed for the people of God: so you find Rev. 2.7. To him that overcomes
will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise
of God: (i. e.) to have the fullest and most intimate communion with Jesus
Christ in Heaven. And this is the substance of Christ's promise to the Thief.
Thou (i. e.) thou in spirit, or thou in thy noblest part, thy soul; which here
bears the name of the whole person; thou shall be with me in Paradise.

Secondly, The Person to whom Christ makes this excellent and Lord, remember
me, when thou come into thy Kingdom.

Thirdly, The set time for the performance of this gracious Promise day, which
should be at the word thee, and so reading it thus, verily I say unto thee to
day, referring the word day to the time that Christ made the promise, and not
to the time of its performance. But if such a liberty as this be yielded, what
may not men make the Scriptures speak? There can be no doubt, but Christ in
this expression, fixes the time for his happiness: To day shall thou be with me.

Fourthly, and Lastly, You have here the Confirmation and Seal of this most
comfortable Promise to him, with Christ's solemn asseveration: verily I say unto
thee. Higher security cannot be given. I that am able to perform what I
promise, and have not out promised my self; for Heaven and the glory thereof
are mine. I that am faithful and true to my promises, and never cracked or
strained my credit with any; I say it, I solemnly confirm it; verily I say unto
thee, to day shall thou with me in Paradise. Hence we have three plain obvious
truths, for our instruction and consolation.

Doct. 1. That there is a future eternal state, into which souls pass at death.

Doct. 2. That all Believers are at their death, immediately received into a
state of glory, and eternal happiness.

Doct. 3. That God may, though he seldom does, prepare men for this glory,
immediately before their dissolution by death.

These are the useful truths resulting from this remarkable word of Christ, to
the penitent Thief. We will consider and inprove them in the order proposed.

DOCT. 1. That there is a future eternal state, Doct. 1.
into which souls pass at death.
This is a principal foundation-stone to the hopes, and happiness of souls. And
seeing our hopes must needs be as their foundation, and ground work is; I shall
briefly establish this truth by these five Arguments. The being of a God
evinces it; the Scriptures of truth plainly reveal it; the Consciences of all
men have resentments of it; the incarnation, and death of Christ is but a
vanity without it; And the immortality of humane souls plainly discovers it.

Arg. 1. The being of a God undeniably evinces a future state for humane souls
after this life. For if there be a God who rules the world which he has made,
he must rule it by rewards, and punishments, equally, and righteously
distributed to good, and bad. Putting a difference betwixt the obedient, and
disobedient. The Righteous, and the wicked. To make a species of creatures
capable of moral government, and not to rule them at all; is to make them in
vain, and inconsistent with his glory who is the last end of all things. To
rule them, but not suitably to their natures; consists not with that infinite
wisdom from which their beings proceeded, and by which their workings are ruled
and ordered. To rule them in a way suitable to their natures, viz. by rewards
and punishments, and not to perform, or execute them at all, is utterly
incongruous with the veracity and truth of him that cannot lie. This were to
impose the greatest cheat in the world upon men; and can never proceed from the
holy and true God. So then, as he has made a rational sort of creatures,
capable of moral government by rewards and punishments; so he rules them in
that way which is suitable to their natures, promising it shall be well with
the righteous, and ill with wicked. These promises and threatenings can be no
cheat, merely intended to scare and fright, where there is no danger; or
encourage, where there is no real benefit: but what he promises, or threatens,
must be accomplished, and every word of God take place, and be fulfilled. But
it is evident that no such distinction is made by the providence of God, (at
least ordinarily, and generally) in this life: but all things come alike to
all: and as with the righteous so with the wicked. Yea, here it goes ill with
them that fear God, they are oppressed. They receive their evil things, and
wicked men their good. Therefore we conclude, the righteous Judge of the whole
earth, will in another world, recompense to every one according as his work
shall be.

Arg. 2. Secondly, And as the very being of God evinces it, so the Scriptures
of truth plainly reveal it. These Scriptures are the Pandect, or System of the
Laws, for the government of men; which the wise and holy Ruler of the world,
has enacted and ordained for that purpose. And in them we find promises made
to the Righteous, of a full reward for all their obedience, patience and
sufferings in the next life, or coming world. And threatenings made against the
wicked, of eternal wrath and anguish, as the Just recompense of their sin, in
Hell for ever. Romans 2.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Thou treasurest up to thy self wrath,
against the day of wrath; and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God. Who
shall render to every man according to his deeds. To them who by patient
continuance in well doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality eternal
life: but unto them that are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey
unrighteousness; indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon every soul
of man that does evil, etc. So 2 These. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. So that we our selves
glory in you, in the Churches of God, for your patience, and faith in all your
persecutions and tribulations, that ye endure. Which is [a manifest token] of
the righteous Judgment of God. That ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of
God, for which ye also suffer. Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled
rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, in flaming
fire, etc. To these plain testimonies, multitudes more might be added, if it
were needful. Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but these words shall never
pass away.

Arg. 3. Thirdly, As the Scriptures reveal it, so the Consciences of all men,
have some resentments of it. Where is the man whose Conscience never felt any
impressions of hope, or fear from a future world? If it be said these may be
but the effects and force of discourse, or education; we have read such things
in the Scriptures, or have heard it by Preachers; and so raise up to our selves
hopes, and fears about it. I demand, how the Consciences of the Heathens, who
have neither Scriptures nor Preachers came to be impressed with these things.
Does not the Apostle tells us, Romans 2.15. That their Consciences in the mean
while work upon these things? Their thoughts with reference to a future state
accuse, or else excuse, (i. e.) their hearts are cheared and encouraged by the
good they do, and terrified with fears about the evils they commit. Whereas if
there were no such things, Conscience would neither accuse, or excuse for good,
or evil done in this world.

Arg. 4. Fourthly, The incarnation and death of Christ, is but a vanity without
it. What did he propose to himself, or what benefit have we by his coming; if
there be no such future state? Did he take our nature, and suffer such terrible
things in it for nothing? If you say, Christians have much comfort from it in
this Life. I answer the comforts they have are raised by faith and expectation
of the happiness to be enjoyed as the purchase of his blood in Heaven. And if
there be no such heaven to which they are appointed. No Hell from which they
are redeemed, they do but comfort themselves with a Fable, and bless themselves
in a thing of naught. Their comfort is no greater than the comfort of a Beggar,
that dreams he is a King, and when he awakes, finds himself a Beggar still.
Surely the ends of Christ's death were to deliver us from the wrath to come, 1
These. 1.10. Not from an imaginary, but a real Hell, to bring us to God, 1 Pet.
3.18. To be the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him, Heb. 5.9.

Arg. 5. Fifthly, and lastly, The immortality of humane souls puts it beyond
all doubt. The soul of a man, vastly differs from that of a Beast; which is but
a material form, and so wholly depending on, must needs perish with the matter.
But it is not so with us. Ours are reasonable spirits, that can live and act in
a separated state from the body, Eccles. 3.21. Who knows the spirit of man
that goes upward, and the spirit of a Beast that goes downward to the earth.
So that look as if a man dispute whether man be rational, that his very
disputing it, proves him to be so; so our disputes, hopes, fears, and
apprehensions of eternity, prove our souls immortal, and capable of that state.

Inference 1.
Is there an Eternal State into which souls pass after this Life. Infer. 1.
How precious then is present time, upon the improvement whereof that State
depends! Ab hoc momento pendet aeter^ita^.
O what a huge weight has God hanged upon a small wire! God has set us here
in a State of Trial, according as we improve these few hours, so will it fare
with us to all Eternity. Every day, every hour, nay every moment of your
present time has an influence into your Eternity. Do ye believe this? What,
and yet squander away precious time so carelessly, so vainly? How do these
things consist? When Seneca heard one promise to spend a week with a friend
that invited him, to recreate himself with him; He told him he admired he
should make such a rash promise; what (said he) cast away so considerable a
part of your Life? How can you do it! Surely our prodigallity in the expense of
time, argues we have but little sense of great Eternity.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
How rational are all the difficulties and severities of Religion, which serve
to promote and secure a future Eternal Happiness? So vast is the disproportion
betwixt Time and Eternity; things seen, and not seen as yet, the present
vanishing, and future permanent state, that he can never be justly reputed a
wise man, that will not let go the best enjoyment he has on earth, if it stand
in the way of his eternal happiness. Nor can that man ever escape the just
censure of notorious folly, who for the gratifying of his appetite, and present
accommodation of his flesh; lets go an eternal glory in heaven. Darius repented
heartily that he lost a Kingdom for a draught of water. O, said he, for how
short a pleasure have I sold a Kingdom! It was Moses choice, and his choice
argued his wisdom; he chose rather to suffer afflictions with the people of
God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, Heb.
11.25. Men do not account him a fool, that will adventure a Penny, upon a
probability to gain ten thousand pounds. But sure the disproportion betwixt
Time, and Eternity is much greater.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
If there certainly be such an Eternal State, into which souls pass immediately
after Death; How great a change then does Death make upon every man and woman!
O what a serious thing is it to die! It Is your passage out of the swift river
of Time, into the boundless and bottomless Ocean of Eternity. You that now
converse with sensible objects, with men and women like your selves, enter then
into the world of Spirits. You that now see the continual revolutions of days
and nights, passing away one after another, will then be fixed in a perpetual
NOW. O what a serious thing is Death! You throw a cast for Eternity, when you
die. If you were to cast a Dye for your natural life, oh how would your hand
shake with fear, how it would fall? but what is that to this?

The souls of men are as it were asleep now in their bodies; at Death they
awake, and find themselves in the world of realities. Let this teach you both
how to carry your selves toward dying persons when you visit them; and to make
every day some provision for that hour your selves. Be serious, be plain, be
faithful with others that are stepping into Eternity: be so with your own souls
every day. O remember what a long word, what an amazing thing Eternity is.
Especially considering

DOCT. 2. That all believers are at their death, Doct. 2.
immediately received into a State of glory and eternal happiness.
This day shall thou be with me.

This the Atheist denies, he thinks he shall die, and therefore resolves to
live as the Beasts that perish. Beryllus and some others after him, taught,
that there was indeed a ^uture state of happiness and misery for souls, but
that they pass not into it immediately upon death and separation from the body,
but shall sleep till the Resurrection and then awake and enter into it. But is
not that soul asleep, or worse, that dreams of a sleeping soul till the
Resurrection. Are souls so wounded and prejudiced by their separation from the
body, that they cannot subsist or act separate from it? Or have they found any
such conceit in the Scriptures? Not at all. The Scriptures take notice of no
such interval; but plainly enough denies it, 2 Cor. 5.8. We are confident I
say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.
Mark it, no sooner parted from the body, but present with the Lord. So Phil.
1.23. I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is far better. If
his soul was to sleep till the Resurrection, how was it far better to be
dissolved, than to live? Sure Paul's state in the body had-been far better, than
his state after death, if this were so; for here he enjoyed much sweet
communion with God by Faith, but then he should enjoy nothing.

To confirm this dream, they urge Ioh 14.3. If I go my way, I will come again
and receive you to my self. As if the time of Christ's receiving his people to
himself should not come, until his second coming at the end of the world. But
though he will then collect all believers into one body, and present them
solemnly to his Father: yet that hinders not, but he may, as indeed he does
receive every particular believing soul to himself at death, by the Ministry of
Angels. And if not, how is it that when Christ comes to judgment, he is
attended with ten thousands of his Saints, that shall follow him when he comes
from heaven? Jude 14. you see then the Scriptures put no interval betwixt the
dissolution of a Saint, and his glorification. It speaks of the Saints that are
dead, as already with the Lord. And the wicked that are dead, as already in
Hell, calling them Spirits in Prison, 1 Pet. 3.19, 20. assuring us that Judas
went presently to his own place, Acts 1.25. and to that sense is the Parable of
Dives and Lazarus, Luke 16.22.

But let us weigh these four things more particularly, for our full
satisfaction in this point.

Arg. 1. First, Why should the happiness of believers be deferred, since they
are immediately capable of enjoying it, as soon as separated from the body? Alas,
the soul is so far from being assisted by the body, (as it is now) for the
enjoyment of God; that it is rather clogged and hindered by it; so speaks the
Apostle, 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from
the Lord, (i. e.) our bodies prejudice our souls, obstruct and hinder the
fullness and freedom of their communion. When we part from the body, we go home
to the Lord. Then the soul is escaped as a Bird out of the Cage or Snare. Here
I am prevented by an excellent Pen, which has judiciously opened this point.
To whose excellent observations I only add this, Mr. Shaw in his Farewell to
Life.
that if the intanglements, snares, and prejudices of the soul are so great and
many in its embodied estate, that it cannot so freely dilate it self and take
in the comforts of God, by communion with him, then surely the laying aside of
that clog, or the freeing of the soul from that burden, can be no bar to its
greater happiness, which it enjoys in its separated state.

Arg. 2. Secondly, Why should the happiness and glory of the soul be deferred,
unless God had some farther preparative work to do upon it; before it be fit to
be admitted into glory? But surely there is no such work wrought upon it after
its separation by death. All that is done of that kind, is done here. When the
compositum is dissolved, all means, duties, and ordinances are ceased. The
working day is then ended, and night come, when no man can work, Ioh. 9.3. To
that purpose are those words of Solomon, Eccles. 9.10. Whatsoever thy hand
finds to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no wisdom, nor knowledge,
nor devise in the Grave whither thou go. So that our glorification is not
deferred, in order to our fuller preparation for glory. If we are not fit when
we die, we can never be fit. All is done upon us that ever was intended to be
done. For they are called, Heb. 12.23. The Spirits of the Just made perfect.

Arg. 3. Thirdly, Again, why should our Salvation slumber, when the damnation
of the wicked does not slumber? God defers not their misery, and surely he will
not defer our glory. If he be quick with his enemies, he will not be slow and
dilatory with his friends. It cannot be imagined but he is as much inclined to
acts of favor to his Children, as to acts of Justice to his enemies; these are
presently damned, Iud. 7. Acts 1.25. 1 Pet. 3.19, 20. and what reason why
believers, all believers as well as this in the Text, should not be that very
day in which they die, with Christ in Glory?

Arg. 4. Fourthly, And lastly, how do such delays consist with Christ's ardent
desires to have his people with him where he is? And with the vehement longings
of their souls to be with Christ? You may see those reflected flames of Love
and desire of mutual enjoyment betwixt the Bridegroom and his Spouse in Revel
22.17, 20. Delays make their hearts sick. The expectation and Faith in which
the Saints die, is to be satisfied then; and surely God will not deceive them.
I deny not but their glory will be more complete when the body their absent
friend is reunited, and made to share with them in their happiness. Yet that
hinders not, but mean while the soul may enjoy its glory, whilst the body takes
its rest, and sleeps in the Dust.

Inference 1.
Are believers immediately with God after their dissolution, Infer. 1.
then how surprizingly glorious will Heaven be to believers! Not that they are
in it before they think of it, or are fitted for it, no, they have spent many
thoughts upon it before, and been long preparing for it; but the suddenness and
greatness of the change is amazing to our thoughts. For a soul to be now here
in the body, conversing with men; living among sensible objects, and within a
few moments to be with the Lord. This hour on earth, the next in the third
heavens. Now viewing this world, and anon standing among an innumerable company
of Angels, and the Spirits of the Just made perfect. O what a change is this!
What! but wink and see God! Commend thy soul to Christ, and be transferred in
the arms of Angels into the invisible world, the world of Spirits! To live as
the Angels of God! To live without eating, drinking, sleeping. To be lifted up
from a bed of sickness to a Throne of Glory! To leave a sinful troublesome
world, a sick and pained body, and be in a moment perfectly cured, and feel thy
self perfectly well, and free from all troubles and distempers! You cannot
think what this will be. Who can tell what sights, what apprehensions, what
thoughts, what frames believing souls have before the bodies they left, are
removed from the eyes of their dear surviving friends!

Inference 2.
Infer. 2,
Are believers immediately with God after their dissolution, Where then shall
unbelievers be, and in what state will they find themselves immediately after
death has closed their eyes! Ah, what will the case of them be that go the
other way?

To be plucked out of house and body, from among friends and comforts, and
thrust into endless miseries, into the dark vault of Hell; never to see the
light of this world any more. Never to see a comfortable sight. Never to hear a
joyful sound. Never to know the meaning of rest, peace, or delight any more; O
what a change is here! To exchange the smiles and honors of men, for the
frowns and fury of God. To be clothed with flames, and drink the pure unmixed
wrath of God, who was but a few days since clothed in silks, and filled with
the sweet of the creature, how is the state of things altered with thee! O
anim^la vagula, ^blandula, heu quo vadis? nunquam jocos dabis, etc.
It was the lamentable cry of poor Adrian when he felt death approaching. Oh my
poor wandering soul, alas, whither art thou now going! Where must thou lodge
this night! Thou shall never jest more, never be merry more.

Your term in your houses and bodies is out, and there is another habitation
provided for you, but it is a dismal one. When a Saint dies heaven above is as
it were moved to receive and entertain him; at his coming he is received into
everlasting habitations. Into the inheritance of the Saints in light. When an
unbeliever dies, we may say of him alluding to Isa. 14.9. Hell from beneath is
moved for him to meet him at his coming, it stirs up the dead for him. No
more sports nor plays, no cups of wine, nor beds of pleasure. The more of these
you enjoyed here, the more intolerable will this change be to you. If Saints
are immediately with God, others must be immediately with Satan.

Inference 3.
How little cause have they to fear death, Infer. 3.
who shall be with God so soon after their death? Some there are that tremble
at the thoughts of death. That cannot endure to hear its name mentioned. That
would rather stoop to any misery here, yea, to any sin, than die, because they
are afraid of the exchange: but you that are interessed in Christ, need not do
so. You can lose nothing by the exchange. The words Death, Grave, and Eternity
should have another kind of sound in your ears. And make contrary impressions
upon your hearts. If your earthly Tabernacles cast you out, you shall not be
found naked. You have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens. And it is but a step out of this, into that. O what fair sweet
and lovely thoughts should you have of that great and last change! But what
speak I of your fearlesness of death? Your Duty lies much higher than that far.

Inference 4.
If Believers are immediately with God, Infer. 4.
after their dissolution, then it is their Duty to long for their dissolution.
And cast many a longing look toward their Graves. So did Paul, I desire to be
dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is far better. The advantages of this
exchange are unspeakable. You have Gold, for Brass; Wine, for Water; Substance,
for shadows; solid Glory, for very Vanity. O if the dust of this earth were but
once blown out of your eyes, that you might see the divine glory; how weary
would you be to live? How willing to die? But then be sure your title to heaven
be sound and good. Leave not so great a concernment to the last. For though it
is confessed God may do that in an hour, that never was done all your days, yet
it is not common. Which brings us to our Third and Last observation.

DOCT. 3. That God may, Doct. 3.
though he seldom does prepare men for glory, immediately before their
dissolution by death.
There is one parable, and no more, that speaks of some that were called at the
last hour. Matthew. 20.9, 10. And there is this one instance in the text, and no
more; that gives us an account of a person so called. We acknowledge God may do
it, his grace is his own. He may dispense it how, and where he pleases. We
must always salve divine prerogative. Who shall fix bonds, or put limits to
free grace, but God himself, whose it is? If he do not ordinarily show such
mercies to dying sinners, (as indeed it does not) yet it is not because he
cannot, but because he will not. Not because their hearts are so hardened by
long custom in sin, that his grace cannot break them; but because he most
justly withholds that grace from them. When blessed Mr. Bilney the martyr,
heard a Minister preaching thus. O thou old sinner, that have lain these fifty
years rotting in thy sin, do thou think now to be saved? That the blood of
Christ shall save thee? O said Mr. Bilney, what preaching of Christ is this! If
I had heard no other preaching than this, what had become of me? No, no old
sinners, or young sinners, great, or small sinners are not to be beaten off
from Christ, but encouraged to repentance, and faith. For who knows but the
bowels of mercy may yearn at last upon one that has all along rejected it.
This thief was as unlikely ever to have received mercy but a few hours before
he died, as any person in the world could be.

But surely this is no encouragement to neglect the present seasons of mercy,
because God may show mercy hereafter. To neglect the ordinary, because God
sometimes manifests his grace in ways extraordinary. Many I know have hardened
themselves in ways of sin by this example of mercy. But what God did at this
time, for this man, cannot be expected to be done ordinarily for us. And the
reasons thereof are, Reason 1. First, Because God has vouchsafed us the
ordinary and standing means of grace, which he had not; and therefore we cannot
expect such extraordinary and unusual conversions as he had. This poor creature
never heard in all likelihood one Sermon preached by Christ, or any of the
Apostles. He lived the life of a Highway man, and concerned not himself about
Religion; but we have Christ preached freely and constantly in our Assemblies.
We have line upon line, and precept upon precept. And when God affords the
ordinary preaching of the Gospel, he does not use to work wonders. When Israel
was in the Wilderness, then God baked their bread in Heaven, and clave the
Rocks to give them drink; but when they came to Canaan, where they had the
ordinary means of subsistence, the manna ceased. Reason 2. Secondly, Such a
conversion as this may not be ordinarily expected by any man, because such a
time as that will never come again. It Is possible if Christ were to die again,
and thou to be crucified with him, thou might receive thy conversion in such
a miraculous and extraordinary way: but Christ dies no more. Such a day as that
will never come again.

Mr. Fenner in his excellent discourse upon this point, tells us that as this
was an extraordinary time, Christ being now to be installed in his Kingdom, and
Crowned with glory and honor: so extraordinary things were now done; as when
Kings are Crowned; the Streets are richly hanged; the Conduits run with wine;
great Malefactors are then pardoned; for then they show their munificence and
bounty; it is the day of the gladness of their hearts. But let a man come at
another time to the Conduits, he shall find no wine, but ordinary water there.
Let a man be in the Goal at another time, and he may be hanged; yea, and has
no reason but to expect and prepare for it. What Christ did now for this man,
was at an extraordinary time.

Reason 3. Thirdly, Such a conversion as this may not ordinarily be expected,
for as such a time will never come again, so there will never be the like
reason for such a conversion any more. Christ converted him upon the Cross, to
give an instance of his divine power at that time when it was almost wholly
clouded. Look as in that day the divinity of Christ brake forth in several
miracles, as the preternatural eclipse of the Sun. The great earthquake, the
rending of the Rocks, and vail of the Temple. So in the conversion of this man
in such an extraordinary way; and all to give evidence of the divinity of
Christ, and prove him to be the Son of God whom they crucified. But that is now
sufficiently confirmed, and there will be no more occasion for miracles to
evidence it. Reason 4. Fourthly, None has reason to expect the like
conversion, that enjoys the ordinary means; because though in this convert we
have a pattern of what free grace can do, yet as Divines pertinently observe,
it is a pattern without a promise. God has not added any promise to it, that
ever he will do so for any other. And where we have not a promise to encourage
our hope, our hope can signify but little to us.


Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Let those that have found mercy in the evening of their life, admire the
extraordinary grace that therein has appeared to them. O that ever God accept
the Bran, when Satan has had the Flour of thy days! The forementioned reverend
Author tells us of one Marcus Cajus Victorius a very aged man in the primitive
times, who was converted from Heathenism to Christianity in his old age. This
man came to Simplicianus a Minister, and told him he heartily owned and
embraced the Christian faith. But neither he nor the Church would trust him for
a long time. And the reason was the unusualness and strangeness of a conversion
at such an age. But after he had given them good evidence of the reallity
thereof, there were acclamations and singing of Psalms, the people every where
crying Marcus Ca^us Victorius is become a Christian. This was written for a
wonder. Oh if God have wrought such wondrous salvations for any of you, what
cause have you to do more for him than others! What, to pluck you out of Hell
when one foot was in! To appear to you at last when so hardened by long custom
in sin, that one might say, can the Ethiopian change his hue, or the Leopard
his spots? O what riches of mercy have appeared to you!

Inference 2.
Let this convince and startle such as even to their gray hairs remain in an
unconverted state, Infer. 2.
who are where they were when they first came into the world, yea, rather
farther off by much.

Bethink your selves, ye that are full of days, and full of sin; whose time is
almost done, and your great work not yet begun. Who have but a few sands more
in the upper part of the glass to run down, and then your conversion will be
impossible. Your sun is setting, your night is coming; the shadows of the
evening are stretched out upon you; you have one foot in the grave, and the
other in Hell. O think if all sense and tenderness be not withered up, as well
as natural verdure; think with your selves, how sad a case you are in. God may
do wonders, but they are not seen every day; then they would cease to be
wondered at. O strive, strive while you have a little time, and a few helps and
means more. Strive to get that work accomplished now that was never done yet.
Defer it no longer, you have done so too much already.

It may be (to use Seneca's expression) you have been these sixty, Semper
victuri.
seventy, or eighty years beginning to live, about to change your practice; but
hitherto you still continue the same. Do not you see how Satan has gulled and
cheated you with vain purposes till he has brought you to the very brinks of
the grave and Hell. O it is time now to make a stand, and pause a little where
you are, and to what he has brought you. The Lord at last give you an eye to
see, and an heart to consider.

Inference 3.
Lastly, Infer. 3.
Let this be a call and caution to all young ones to begin with God betime, and
take heed of delays till the last, as so many thousands have done before them
to their eternal ruin. Now is your time, if you desire to be in Christ; if you
have any sense of the weight and worth of eternal things upon your hearts. I
know your age is voluptuous, and delights not in the serious thoughts of death
and eternity. You are more inclined to mind your pleasures, and leave these
grave and serious matters to old age. But let me persuade you against that, by
these considerations.

First, Oh set to the business of Religion now, because this is the moulding
age. Now your hearts are tender, and your affections flowing. Now is the time
when you are most likely to be wrought upon.

Secondly, Now, because this is the freest part of your time. It is in the
morning of your life, as in the morning of the day. If a man have any business
to be done, let him take the morning for it. For in the after part of the day a
hurry of business comes on, so that you either forget it, or want opportunity
for it.

Thirdly, Now, because your life is immediately uncertain. You are not certain
that ever you shall attain the years of your Fathers. There are graves in the
Church yard just of your length. And skulls of all sorts and sizes in Golgotha
as the Jews proverb is.

Fourthly, Now, because God will not spare you because you are but young
sinners, little sinners, if you die Christless. If you are not as you think old
enough to mind Christ, surely if you die Christless, you are old enough to be
damned. There Is the small spray, as well as great logs in the fire of Hell.

Fifthly, Now, because your life will be the more eminently useful, and
serviceable to God, when you know him betime, and begin with him early. Austin
repented, and so have many thousands since him, that he began so late, and knew
God no sooner.

Sixthly, Now, because your life will be the sweeter to you, when the morning
of it is dedicated to the Lord. The first fruits sanctify the whole harvest.
This will have a sweet influence into all your days. Whatever changes,
straights, or troubles you may afterward meet with.

The THIRTY TIHRD SERMON. Sermon. 33.
Opens the fourth excellent saying of Christ upon the Cross.

MATTHEW. XXVII.XLVI. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
saying, Eli, Eli, lamasabachtani, that is to say, my God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me?


THis verse contains the fourth memorable saying of Christ upon the Cross. Non
ignoro qaidem verba haec (...) and summa animae angustia versantis esse.
Heinsius in Loc.
Words able to rend the hardest heart in the world. It is the voice of the Son
of God in an agony. His sufferings were great, very great before, but never in
that extremity as now; When this heaven-rending and heart-melting outcry brake
from him upon the Cross, Eli, Eli lamasabachtani. In which words are
considerable, the time, matter and manner of this his sad complaint.

First, The time when it was uttered; about the ninth hour, (i. e.) manner into
four quarters, or greater hours. Which had their names from that hour of the
day that closed the quarter. So that beginning their account of their lesser
hours from six in the morning, which with them was the first, their ninth hour
answered to our third after noon. And this is heedfully marked by the
Evangelists on purpose to show us how long Christ hanged in distress upon the
Cross, both in soul and body, which at least was three full hours. Toward the
end whereof his soul was so filled, distressed, and overwhelmed; that this
doleful cry brake from his soul, in bitter anguish. My God, my God, etc.

Secondly, The matter of the complaint. It is not of the cruel tortures he felt
in his body, nor of the scoffs and reproaches of his name; he mentions not a
word of these, they were all swallowed up in the sufferings within, as the
River is swallowed up in the Sea, or the lesser flame in the greater. He seems
to neglect all these, and only complains of what was more burdensome than ten
thousand Crosses. Even his Fathers deserting him, my God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? It is a more inward trouble that burdens him, darkness upon his
spirit, the hidings of Gods face from him, an affliction he was totally a
stranger to, till now. Here he lays his hand in this complaint. This was the
pained place, to which he points in this dolorous outcry.

Thirdly, The manner in which he utters his sad complaint, and that was with a
remarkable vehemence, he cried with a loud voice, not like a dying man, in whom
nature was spent, but as one full of vigor, life and sense. He gathered all his
spirits together, stirred up the whole power of nature when he made this
grievous outcry. There is in it also an emphatical reduplication which shows
with what vehemence it was uttered. Not singly, my God, but he doubles it, my
God, my God, as distressed persons use to do. So Elisha, when Eli^ah was
separated from him by the Chariots and Horses of fire, cries out, my Father, my
Father.

Nay, moreover, to increase the force and vehemence of this complaint, here is
an affectionate interrogation: Why have thou forsaken me? Questions, especially
such as this, are full of spirits. It is as if he were surprised by the
strangeness of this affliction: and rouzing up himself with an unusual
vehemence, turns himself to his Father, and cries, why so, my Father; O what
do thou mean by this? What, hide that face from me that never was hid before!
What, and hide it from me now, in the depth of my other torments and troubles!
O what new, what strange things are these! Lastly, here is an observable
variation of the language in which this astonishing complaint was uttered. For
he speaks both Hebrew, and Syriack in one breath, Eli, Eli, lama, are all
Hebrew, Sabachtani is a Syriack word, used here for emphasis sake. Hance we
observe.

DOCT. That God in design to heighten the sufferings of Christ to the
uttermost, Doct.
forsook him in the time of his greatest distress; to the unspeakable
affliction, and anguish of his soul.
This proposition shall be considered in three parts. The desertion it self.
The design or end of it. The effect and influence it had on Christ.

First, The desertion it self. Divine desertion generally considered
absolutely, and wholly,, or respectively and only as to manifestation. In the
first sense Devils are forsaken of God. They once were in his favor and love,
but they have utterly and finally lost it. God is so withdrawn from them, as
that he will never take them into favor any more. In the other sense he
sometimes forsakes his dearest Children, (i. e.) he removes all sweet
manifestations of his favor and love for a time, and carries it to them as a
stranger; though his love be still the same.

And this kind of desertion which is respective, temporary, and only in regard
of manifestation, is justly distinguished from the various ends and designs of
it, into probational, cautional, castigatory, and poenal. Probational
desertions are only for the proof and trial of grace. Cautional desertions are
designed to prevent sin. Castigatory desertions are Gods rods to chastize his
people for sin. Poenal desertions are such as are inflicted as the just reward
of sin, for the reparation of that wrong sinners have done by their sins. Of
this sort was Christ's desertion. A part of the curse, and a special part. And
his bearing it was no small part of the reparation, or satisfaction he made for
our sins.

More particularly, to open the nature of this desertion of Christ by his
Father, there being much of intricacy and difficulty in it. I shall proceed in
the explication of it Negatively, and Positively.

First, Negatively, when Christ cries out of Gods forsaking him, he does not
mean that he had dissolved the personal union of the two natures. Not as if the
marriage knot which united our nature to the person of Christ was loosed, or a
divorce made betwixt them. No, for when he was forsaken of God, he was still
true and real Godman in one person.

Secondly, When Christ bewails the Fathers forsaking him, he does not mean that
he pulled away the prop of divine support from him, by which he had till then
endured the tortures and sufferings that oppressed him. No, though the Father
deserted, yet he still supported him. And so much is intimated in these words
of Christ Eli, Eli, which signifies my strong one, my strong one. God was with
him by way of support, when withdrawn as to manifestations of love and favor.
In respect of Gods supporting presence which was with Christ at this time; it is
said, Isai. 42.1. Behold my Servant whom I uphold, and Joh. 16.32. I am not
alone, but the Father is with me. So that this cannot be the meaning of it.

Thirdly, Much less is it his meaning that God had left him, as to inherent
grace and sanctification. Recalling that spirit of holiness which had anointed
him above his fellows. No, no: when he was forsaken he remained as holy as
ever. He had indeed less comfort, but not less holiness than before. Such a
desertion had irritated and made void the very end of his death. And his
sacrifice could never have yielded such a fragrant odor to God as it did, Ephesians.
5.2.

Fourthly, The love of God was not so withdrawn from Christ, as that the Father
had now no love for him, nor delight in him. That Is impossible, he can no more
cease to love Christ, than to love himself. His love was not turned into wrath.
Though his wrath only was now manifested to him as our surety; and his love hid
from him, as his beloved Son.

Fifthly, Nor was Christ forsaken by his Father finally, upon what account
soever it was that he was forsaken. No, it was but for a few hours that the
dark cloud dwelt over his soul. It soon past away. And the bright and glorious
face of God shone forth again, as bright as ever, Psalm. 22.1.24. compared.

Sixthly, And lastly, It was not a mutual desertion, or a desertion on both
parts; the Father forsook him, but he forsook not his Father. When God
withdrew, he followed him, crying my God, my God.

Yet to speak positively of it; though it did not dissolve the personal union,
nor cutting off divine supports, nor remove his inherent grace, nor turn his
Fathers love into hatred, nor continue for ever, nor yet was it on both parts,
Christ's forsaking God, as well as God forsaking Christ; yet I say it was First,
A very sad desertion, the like unto which in all respects never was experienced
by any, nor can be to the end of the world. All his other troubles were but
small things to this; they bare upon his body, these upon his soul. They came
from the hands of vile men, this from the hand of a dear Father. He suffered
both in body and soul; but the sufferings of his soul, were the very soul of
his sufferings. Under all his other sufferings he opened not his mouth, but
this touched the quick, that he could not but cry out, my God, my God, why have
thou forsaken me. Secondly, As it was a sad, so it was a poenal desertion,
inflicted on him for satisfaction for those sins of ours, which deserved that
God should forsake us for ever, as the damned are forsaken by him. So that this
cry (as one observes) was like the perpetual shriek of them that are cast away
for ever. This was that Hell, and the torments of it which Christ our surety
suffered for us. For look as there lies a twofold misery upon the damned in
Hell, viz. pain of sense, and pain of loss. So upon Christ answerably there was
not only an impression of wrath, but also a Substraction, or withdrawment of
all sensible favor, and love. Hence it is said by himself, Ioh. 12.27. And now
my soul (...) is troubled. The word signifies troubled as they that are in Hell
are troubled. Though God did not leave his soul in Hell, as others are; he
having enough to pay the debt which they have not, yet in the torments thereof
at this time he was. Yea, in sufferings at this time in his soul, equivalent to
all that which our souls should have suffered there, to all Eternity. Thirdly,
Net ficte ^^e beatri^e coaqueritur so a patre d^r ^ctum. Et quod non nulli ex
vulgi opi^ione sic locatum obtendu^t, i^sipidum est Cavilum. Calv.
It was a desertion that was real, and not fictitious. He does not personate a
deserted soul, and speak as if God had withdrawn the comfortable sense and
influence of his love from him; but the thing was so indeed. The Godhead
restrained and kept back for this time, all its joys, comforts, and sense of
love from the manhood: yielding it nothing but support. This bitter doleful
outcry of Christ gives evidence enough of the reality of it. He did not feign
but feel the burdensomness of it. Fourthly, This desertion fell out in the time
of Christ's greatest need of comfort that ever he had in all the time of his
life on earth. His Father forsook him at that time, when all earthly comforts
had forsaken him; and all outward evils had broken in together upon him. When
men yea the best of men stood afar off, and none but barbarous enemies were
about him. When pains and shame, and all miseries even weighed him down, then
even then to complete and fill up his sufferings, God stands afar off too.
Fifthly, And lastly, It was such a desertion, as left him only to the supports
of his Faith. He had nothing else now but his Fathers covenant and promise to
hang upon. And indeed as a Juditious Author perninently observes; the Faith of
Christ did several ways act and manifest it self, Mr. Ca^ his Correction
Instruction p. 51.52.
in these very words of complaint in the Text.


For though all comfortable sights of God and sense of love were obstructed,
yet you see his soul cleaves fiducially to God for all that. My God, etc.
Though sense and feeling spoke as well as Faith; Yet Faith speaks first, my
God, before sense speaks a word of his forsaking. His Faith prevented the
complaint of sense and though sense comes in afterward with a word of
complaint, yet here are two words of Faith, to one of Sense. It is, my God, my
God, and but one word of forsaking. As his Faith spoke first, so it spoke twice
when sense and feeling spoke but once. Yea, and as Faith spoke first, and twice
as much as sense, so it spoke more confidently than Sense did. He lays a
confident claim to God as his God; my God, my God, and only Queries about his
forsaking of him; why have thou forsaken me? This is spoken more dubiously, the
former most confidently.

To be short, His Faith laid hold on God, under a most suitable Title, or
Attribute, Eli, Eli, my strong one, my strong one, q. d. O thou with whom is
infinite and everlasting strength, thou that have hitherto supported my
Manhood, and according to thy promise upheld thy Servant; what, will thou now
forsake me? My strong one I lean upon thee. To these supports and refuges of
Faith this desertion shut up Christ. By these things he stood when all other
visible and sensible comforts shrunk away both from his soul and body. This is
the true though brief account of the nature and quality of Christ's desertion.

Secondly, In the next place let us consider the designs, and ends Satisfaction
and Sanctification. Satisfaction for those sins of ours which deserved that we
should be totally and everlastingly forsaken of God. This is the desert of
every sin, and the damned do feel it, and shall to all Eternity. God is gone
from them for ever, not essentially, the just God is with them still, the God
of power is still with them, the avenging God is ever with them; but the
merciful God is gone, and gone for ever. And thus would he have withdrawn
himself from every soul that sinned, had not Christ born that punishment for
us, in his own soul; if he had not cried, my God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? we must have howled out this hideous complaint in the lowest Hell
for ever, O righteous God, O dreadful, O terrible God, thou have for ever
forsaken me.

And as satisfaction was designed in this desertion of Christ, so also was the
Sanctification of all the desertions of the Saints designed in it. For he
having been forsaken before us, and for us; when ever God forsakes us, that
very forsaking of his is sanctified, and thereby turned into a mercy to
believers. Hence are all the precious fruits and effects of our desertions.
Such are the earnest excitation of the soul to Prayer, Psalm. 77.2. Psalm. 88.1,
9. The antidoting the tempted soul against sin. The reviving of ancient
experiences, Psalm. 77.5. Enhaunsing the value of the divine presence with the
soul, and teaching it to hold Christ faster than ever before, Cant. 3.1, 2, 3,
4, 5. These and many more are the precious effects of sanctified desertion? but
how many or how good so ever these effects are, they do all owe themselves to
Jesus Christ, as to the Author of them. Who for our sakes would pass through
this dark and sad state, that we might find those blessings in it. So then, the
God-heads suspending of all the effects of joy and comfort from the humanity of
Christ at this time, which had not ceased to flow into it in an ineffable
measure, and manner till now, must needs be both a special part of Christ's
satisfaction for us, and consequently that which makes all our temporary
desertions rather mercies and blessings, than curses to us.

Thirdly, Let us in the next place consider the Effect and influence

And though it did not drive him to despair as the Papists falsely charge Mr.
Calvin to have affirmed; yet it even amazed him, and almost swallowed up his
soul in the deeps of trouble and consternation. This cry is a cry from the
deeps; from a soul oppressed even to death. Never was the Lord Jesus so put to
it before. It is a most astonishing outcry.

Let but five particulars be weighed, and you will say never was there any
darkness like this. No sorrow like Christ's sorrow in his deserted state. For,
First, Apprehend, Reader, this was a new thing to Christ, and that which he was
never acquainted with before. From all Eternity until now, there had been
constant and wonderful out-lets of love, delight, and joy, from the bosom of
the Father, into his bosom. He never missed his Father before. Never saw a
frown, or a vail upon that blessed face before. This made it an heavy burden
indeed, the words are words of wonderment and admiration; my God, my God, why
have thou forsaken me! Thou that never ^idst so before, have forsaken me now.
Secondly, As it was a new thing to Christ, and therefore the more amazing; so
it was a great thing to Christ, so great that he scarce knew how to support it.
Had it not been a great trial indeed, so great a spirit as Christ's was would
never have so drooped under it, and made so sad a complaint of it. It was so
sharp, so heavy an affliction to his soul; that it caused him who was meek
under all other sufferings as a Lamb, (...)
to roar under this like a Lion. For so much those words of Christ signify, Id
quod ru^itum vocat, ^on^bumanam, sed ^^oni^am vocem significat. Bacer. in L^c
Psalm. 22.1. My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me, why art thou so far
from the voice of my roaring? It comes from a root that signifies to howl or
roar as a Lion. And rather signifies the noise made by a wild Beast, than the
voice of a man.

And it is as much as if Christ had said, O my God no words can express my
anguish. I will not speak, but roar, howl out my complaints. Pour it out in
vollies of Groans. I roar as a Lion. It Is no small matter will make that
majestic creature to roar. And sure so great a Spirit as Christ's, would not
have roared under a slight burden.

Thirdly, As it was a great burden to Christ, so it was a burden laid on in the
time of his greatest distress. When his body was in tortures, and all about him
was black, dismal, and full of horror, and darkness. He fell into this
desertion at a time when he never had the like need of divine supports and
comforts, and that aggravated it. Fourthly, It was a burden that lay upon him
long, even from the time his soul began to be sorrowful and sore amazed in the
Garden, till his very death. If you were but to hold your finger in the fire
for two minutes, you would not be able to bear it. But what is the finger of a
man, to the soul of Christ? or what is material fire, to the wrath of the great
God! Fifthly, So heavy was this pressure upon Christ's soul, that in all
probability it hastened his death; for it was not usual for crucified persons
to expire so soon; and those that were crucified with him, were both alive
after Christ was gone. Some have hanged more than a day and night, some two
full days and nights in those torments alive; but never did any feel inwardly,
what Christ felt. He bare it till the nighth hour, and then make a fearful
outcry, and dies. The Uses follow.


Inference 1.
Did God forsake Christ upon the Cross, Infer. 1.
as a punishment to him for our sins; Then it follows, that as often as we have
sinned, so often have we deserved to be forsaken of God. This is the (...) just
recompense and demerit of Sin. And indeed here lies the principal evil of sin,
that it separates betwixt God and the soul. This separation is both the moral
evil that is in it, and the poenal evil inflicted by the righteous God for it.
By sin we depart from God, and as a due punishment of it, God departs from us.
This will be the dismal Sentence in the last day, Matthew. 25. Depart from me, ye
Cursed. Thenceforth there will be a gulf fixed betwixt God and them, Luke
16.20. No more friendly interccurses with the blessed God for ever. The eternal
shriek of the damned is, Woe, and alas, God has forsaken us for ever more. Ten
thousand worlds can no way recompense the loss of one God. Beware sinners how
you say to God now, depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways,
lest he say, depart from me, you shall never see my face.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Did Christ never make such a sad complaint and outcry till God. hid his face
from him; Then the hiding of Gods face, is certainly the greatest misery that
can possibly befall a gracious soul, in this world. When they scourged,
buffetted, and smo^e Christ, yea when they nailed him to the Tree, he opened
not his mouth; but when his Father hid his face from him, then he cried out;
yea, his voice was the voice of roaring; this was more to him, than a thousand
cruci yings. And surely as it was to Christ, so it. is to all gracious souls
the saddest stroke, the heaviest burden that ever they felt. When David forbad
Absalom to come to jerusalem to see his Father, he complains in 2 Samuel 14.32.
Wherefore (said he) am I come from Geshur, if I may not see the Kings face? So
does the gracious soul bemcan it self, wherefore am I redeemed, called, and
reconciled; if I may not see the face of my God?

It Is said of Tully when he was banished from Italy, and of Demosthenes when he
was banished from Athens, that they wept every time they looked toward their
own Country. And is it strange that a poor deserted believer should mourn every
time he looks heaven ward? Say, Christian, did the tears never tricle down thy
cheeks when thou lookedst toward heaven, and could not see the face of thy
God as at other times? If two dear friends cannot part, though it be but for a
season, but that parting must be in a shower: blame not the Saints if they sigh
and mourn bitterly when the Lord, who is the life of their life departs; though
but for a season from them; for if God depart, their sweetest enjoyment on
earth, the very crown of all their comforts is gone, and what will a King take
in exchange for his crown? what can recompense to a Saint, the loss of his God!
Indeed if they had never seen the Lord, or tasted the incomparable sweetness of
his presence, it were another matter; but the darkness which follows the
sweetest light of his countenance is doubl darkness.

And that which does not a little increase the horror of this darkness is, that
when their souls are thus benighted, and the Sun of their comfort is set; then
does Satan like the wild Bea^ts of the desert, creep out of his den, and roars
upon them with hideous temptations. Surely this is a sad state, and deserves
tender pity. Pity is a due debt to the distressed, and the world shows not a
greater distress than this. If ever you have been in troubles of this kind your
selves, you will never slight others in the same case! Nay one end of Gods
exercising you with troubles of this nature, is to teach you compassion toward
others in the same case. Do they not cry to you as Job 19.21. Have pity, have
pity upon me, O ye my friends, for the hand of God has touched me. Draw ferch
bowels of mercy and tender compassion to them, Aut sumus, aut suimus, aut
possam es esse quod hic est.
for either you have been, or are, or may be in the same case your selves,
however, if men do not, to be sure Christ that has felt it before them, and
for them, will pity them.

Inference 3.
Did God really forsake Jesus Christ upon the Cross, Infer. 3.
then from the desortion of Christ's singular consolation springs up to the
people of God; yea, manifold consolation. Principally it is a support in these
two respects, As it is preventive of your final desertion, and a comfortable
pattern to you in your present sad desertions.

First, Christ's desertion is preventive of your final desertion. Because he was
forsaken for a time, you shall not be forsaken for ever. For he was forsaken
for you. And Gods forsaking him. though but for a few hours, is equivalent to
his forsaking you for ever. It is every way as much for the dear Son of God,
the darling delight of his soul, to be forsaken of God for a time; as if such a
poor inconsiderable thing as thou art, should be cast off to eternity. Now
this being equivalent and born in thy room, must needs give thee the highest
security in the world, that God will never finally withdraw from the. Had he
intended to have done so, Christ had never made such a sad cut-cry as you hear
this day, my God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?

Secondly, Moreover, this sad desertion of Christ becomes a comf^rca^le pattern
to poor deserted souls in diverse respects: and the proper business of such soul
at such times, is to eye it believingly, in those fix respects.

First, Though God deserted Christ, yet at the same time he powerfully
supported him. His omnipotent arms were under him, though his pleased face was
hid from him. He had not indeed his smiles, but he had his supportations. So
(Christan) just so shall it be with thee. Thy God may turn away his face, he
will not pluck away his arm. When one asked of holy Mr. Baines how the case
stood with his soul, he answered; Supports I have, though suavities I want. Our
Father in this deals with us, as we our selves sometimes do with a Child that
is stubborn and rebellious. We turn him out of doors, and bid him be gone our
of our sight; and there sighs and weeps, but how ever, for the humbling of him
will not presently take him into house and favor; yet we order, at least
permit the servants to carry him meat and drink. Here is fatherly care, and
support; though no former smiles, or manifested delights.

Secondly, Though God deserted Christ, yet he deserted not God. His Father
forsook him, but he could not forsake his Father, but followed him with this
cry, my God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?

And is it not even so with you? God goes off from your souls, but you cannot
go off from him. No, your hearts are mourning after the Lord. Seeking him
carefully with tears. Complaining of his absence as the greatest evil in this
world. This is Christ like. So it was with the Spouse, Cant. 3.1, 2. Her
beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone; but was she content to part with
him so? No such thing. By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loves, I
sought him but I found him not, I will arise now, and go about the City, etc.

Thirdly, Though God forsook Christ, yet he returned to him again. It was but
for a time, not for ever. In this also does his desertion parallel yours. God
may for several wise and holy reasons hide his face from you, but not so as
it is hid from the damned; who shall never see it again. This cloud will pass
away. This night shall have a bright morning. For (says thy God) I will not
contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth* for the spirit should fail
before me, and the souls which I have made. As if he should say, I may contend
with him for a time, to humble him; but not for ever, left instead of a sad
child, I should have a dead child. Oh the tenderness even of a displeased
Father!

Fourthly, Though God forsook Christ, yet at that time he could justify God.
So you read Psalm. 22.2, 3. O my God, (says he) I cry in the day time; but thou
hear not, and in the night season, and am not silent; but thou art holy. Is
not thy spirit according to thy measure, framed like Christ's in this? Can
thou not say even when he writes bitter things against thee, he is a holy,
faithful, and good God for all this. I am deserted, but not wronged. There is
not one drop of injustice, in all the Sea of my sorrows. Though he condemn me,
I must and will Justify him. This also is Christ-like.

Fifthly, Though God took from Christ all visible and sensible comforts,
inward, as well as outward; yet Christ subsisted by faith in the absence of
them all. His desertion put him upon the acting of his faith. My God, my God,
are words of faith. The words of one that rolls upon his God. And is it not so
with you too? Sense of love is gone, sweet sights of God shut up in a dark
cloud; well what then? Must thy hands presently hang down, and thy soul give up
all its hopes? What! is there no faith to relieve in this case? Yes, yes, and
blessed be God for faith. Who is among you that fears the Lord, and obeys
the voice of his servants, that walks in darkness, and has no light; let him
trust in the name of the Lord, and stay himself upon his God, Isai. 50.10. To
conclude,

Sixthly, Christ was deserted, a little before the glorious morning of light
and joy dawned upon him. It was a little, a very little while, after this sad
cry, before he triumphed gloriously. And so it may be with you. Heaviness may
endure for a night, but joy and gladness will come in the morning. You know how
Mr. Glover was trasported with joy, and cried out, as a man in a Rapture. O
Austin, he is come, he is come, he is come, meaning the Comforter, who for some
time had been absent from his soul.

But I fear I am absolutely and finally forsaken. Ob^ect.


Why so? Sol.
Do you find the characters of such a desertion upon your soul? Be righteous
Judges, and tell me, whether you find an heart willing to forsake God? Is it
indifferent now to you whether God ever return again or no? Are there no
mournings, meltings, hankerings after the Lord? Indeed if you forsake him, he
will cast you off for ever. But can you do so? Oh no, let him do what he will,
I am resolved to wait for him, cleave to him, mourn after him, though I have no
present comfort from him, no assurance of my interest in him! yet will I not
exchange my poor weak hopes, for all the good in this world.

Again, You say God has forsaken you, but has he let loose the bridle before
you? To allude to Job. 30.11. Has he taken away from your souls, all
conscientious tenderness of sin, so that now you can sin freely, and without
any regret? If so, it is a sad token indeed. Tell me soul, if thou judge
indeed God will never return in loving kindness to thee any more; why do thou
not then give thy self over to the pleasures of sin, and fetch thy comforts
that way from the creatures since thou can have no comfort from thy God? Oh
no, I cannot do so. If I die in darkness and sorrow, I will never do so. My
soul is as full of fear and hatred of sin as ever, though empty of joy and
comfort. Surely there are no tokens of a soul finally abandoned by its God.

Inference 4.
Did God forsake his own Son upon the Cross; Infer. 4.
then the dearest of Gods people may for a time be forsaken of their God: Think
it not strange when you that are the children of light, meet with darkness, yea
and walk it ^. Neither charge God foolishly. Say not he deals hardly with you.
You see what befell Jesus Christ, whom his soul delighted in. It Is doubtless
your concernment to expect, and prepare for days of darkness. You have heard
the doleful cry of Christ, my God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? You know
how it was with Job, David, H^man, Asaph, and many others the dear servants of
God. What heart-melting lamentations they have made upon this account. And are
you better than they? Oh prepare for spiritual troubles. I am sure you do
enough every day to involve you in darkness. Now if at any time this trial
befall you, mind these two seasonable Admonitions, and lay them up for such a
time.

Admonition 1. First, Exercise the faith of adherence, when you have lost the
faith of evidence. When God takes away that he leaves this. That is necessary
to the comfort, this to the life of his people. It Is sweet to live in views of
your interest, but if they be gone, believe and roll on God for an interest.
Stay your selves on your God, when you h^ve no light. Isai. 50.10. Drop this
anchor in the dark, and do not reckon all gone, when evidence is gone. Never
reckon your selves undone whilst you can adhere to your God. Direct acts are
noble acts of faith, as well as reflexive ones. Yea, and in some respects to be
preferred to them. For, First, As your comfort depends on the evidencing acts
of faith, so your salvation upon the adhering act of faith. Evidence comforts,
but affiance saves you. And sure salvation is more than comfort. Secondly, Your
faith of evidence has more sensible sweetness, but your faith of adherence is
of more constancy, and continuance. The former is as a flower in its mouth, the
latter sticks by you all the year. Thirdly, Faith of evidence brings more joy
to you, but faith of adherence, brings more glory to God. For thereby you trust
him when you cannot see him. Yea, you believe not only without, but against
sense and feeling. And doubtless that which brings glory to God, is better than
that which brings comfort to you. O then, exercise this, when you have lost
that.


Admonition 2. Secondly, Take the right method to recover the sweet light which
you have sinned away from your souls. Do not go about from one, to another
complaining; nor yet sit down desponding under your burden. But, First, Search
diligently after the cause of Gods withdrawment. Urge him hard by prayer to
tell thee wherefore he contends with thee, Job. 10.2. Say, Lord, what have I
done that so offends thy spirit? what evil is it which thou so rebukest? I
beseech thee show me the cause of thine anger? Have I grieved thy spirit in
this thing, or in that? Was it my neglect of duty, or my formality in duties?
Was I not thankful for the sense of thy love, when it was shed abroad in my
heart? O Lord, why is it thus with me? Secondly, Humble your souls before the
Lord for every evil you shall be convinced of. Tell him it pierces your hearts
that you have so displeased him. And that it shall be a caution to you whilst
you live, never to return again to folly. Invite him again to your souls, and
mourn after the Lord till you have found him. If you seek him, he will be found
of you, 2 Chronicles. 15.2. It may be you shall have a thousand Comforters come
about your sad souls in such a time to comfor them. This will be to you instead
of God, and that will repair your loss of Christ. Despise them all, and say, I
am resolved to sit as a Widow till Christ return; he or none shall have my
love. Thirdly, Wait on in the use of means till Christ return. O be not
discouraged. Though he tarry, wait you for him, for Blessed are all they that
wait for him.


The THIRTY FOURTH Sermon. 34.
SERMON. Opens the fifth excellent word of Christ upon the Cross.

JOH. XIX.XXVIII. After this Jesus knowing that all things were now
accomplished; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, says, I Thirst.


IT is as truly as commonly said, death is dry. Christ found it so, when he
died. When his spirits labored in the agonies of death, then he said I thirst.

This is the fifth word of Christ upon the Cross, spoken a little before he
bowed the head and yielded up the Ghost. It is only recorded by this
Evangelist, and there are four things remarkable in this complaint of Christ,
viz. the person complaining. The complaint he made. The time when. And the
reason why he so complained.

First, The person complaining. Jesus said I thirst. This is a clear evidence
that it was no common suffering. Great and resolute spirits will not complain
for small matters. The spirit of a common man will endure much, before it
utters any complaint. Let us therefore see,

Secondly, The affliction or suffering he complains of; and that is Thirst.
There are two sorts of thirst. One natural and proper, another spiritual and
figurative. Sitis est cupidit^s nutrimenti, potissimum humidi orta exa
refactione portium corporis animalis; quae irrigat une egent. K^ck^rm Physics
p. 404.
Christ felt both at this time. His soul thirsted in vehement desires and
longings to accomplish and finish that great and difficult work he was now
about. And his body thirsted by reason of those unparalleled agonies it
labored under, for the accomplishing hereof. But it was the proper natural
thirst he here intends, when he said, I thirst. Now this natural thirst of
which he complains, is the raging of the appetite for humid nourishment,
arising from the scorching up of the parts of the body for want of moisture.
And amongst all the pains and afflictions of the body, there can scarcely be
named a greater, and more intolerable one than extreme thirst. The most mighty
and valiant have stooped under it. Mighty Sampson after all his conquests and
victories, complains thus, Judge. 15.18. And he was sore athirst, and called on
the Lord, and said, thou have given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
servant, and now shall I die for thirst? and fall into the hands of the
uncircumcised. Great Darius drank filthy water, C^jus modi voluptatis hactenus
inexpertus sui? Plutarch.
defiled with the bodies of the slain, to relieve his thirst; and protested,
never any drink was more pleasant to him. Hence, Isai. 41.17. Thirst is put to
express the most afflicted state. When the poor and needy seek water, and there
is none; and their tongue fails for thirst: I the Lord will hear them, (i.
e.) when my people are in extreme necessities under any extraordinary pressures
and distresses; I will be with them, to supply and relieve them. Thirst causes
a most painful compression of the heart, when the body like a sponge sucks and
draws for moisture, and there is none. And this may be occasioned either by
long abstinence from drink, or by the laboring and expense of the spirits
under grievous agonies, and extreme tortures; which like a fire within soon
sc^rch up the very radical moisture.

Now though we find not, that Christ tasted a drop of liquor since he sat with
the Disciples at the Table, after that no more refreshments for him in this
world: yet that was not the cause of this raging thirst; but it is to be
ascribed to the extreme sufferings which he so long had conflicted with, both
in his soul, and body. These preyed upon him and drank up his very spirits.
Hence came this sad complaint I thirst.

Thirdly, Let us consider the time when he thus complained. When all things
were now accomplished, says the Text, (i. e.) when all things were even ready
to be accomplished in his death. A little, a very little while before his
expiration. When the travailing throws of death began to be strong upon him.
And so it was both a sign of death at hand, and of his love to us: which was
stronger than death; that would not complain sooner, because he would admit of
no relief, nor take the lest refreshment till he had done his work.

Fourthly, and Lastly, Take notice of the design and end of his That the
Scriptures might be fulfilled, he says I thirst, (i. e.) that it might appear
for the satisfaction of our faith, that whatsoever had been predicted by the
Prophets; was exactly acc^mplished even to a circumstance in him. Now it was
foretold of him, Psalm. 69.21. They gave me gall for my meat, and in my thirst,
they gave me vinegar to drink, and herein it was verified. Hence the Note is.

DOCT. That such were the Agonies and extreme sufferings of our Lord Jesus
Christ upon the Cross, Doct.
as drank up his very spirits, and made him cry I thirst.
If I (said one) should live a thousand years, and every day die a thousand
times the same death for Christ, that he once died for me, yet all this would
be nothing to the sorrows Christ endured in his death. Si poss^m vivere mill
annos, and qualibet die millies mori pro eo, eadem morte qu^ ille pro me
mortuus est semel: nihil esset ad ^^lorem quam habuit in se. Edmund de speculo
Eccles. cap. 23.
At this time the Bridegroom Christ might have borrowed the word of his Spouse
the Church, Lam. 1.12. Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? See, and
behold, if there be any sorrow, like unto my sorrow which is done unto me;
wherewith the Lord has afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger.

Here we are to enquire into and consider the extremities and agonies Christ
labored under upon the Cross, which occasioned this sad complaint of thirst.
And then make application of it in the several inferences of truth diducible
from it.

Now the sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the Cross were twofold, viz.
his Corporeal, and Spiritual sufferings. We shall open them distinctly, and
then show how both these meeting together upon him in their fullness and
extremity must needs consume his very radical moisture, and make him cry I
thirst. To begin with the first,

First, His Corporeal and more external sufferings were exceeding great, acute,
and extreme sufferings. For they were sharp, universal, continual, and
unrelieved by any inward comfort.

Corpus ejus fuit optime co^plexionatum, cum formatum fuit miraculose. Aquin.
pars tertia. Art. 6.
First, They were sharp sufferings. For his body was racked or dug in those
parts where sense more eminently dwells. In the hands and feet the veins and
sinews meet, and there pain and anguish meet with them. Psalm. 22.16. They
dug my hands, and my feet. Now Christ by reason of his exact and excellent
temper of body had doubtless more quick, tender and delicate senses than other
men. His body was so formed that it might be a capacious vessel to take in more
sufferings than any other body can. Sense is in some more delicate and tender,
and in others dull, and blunt according to the temperment, and vivacity of the
body and spirits. But in none as it was in Christ, whose body was miraculously
formed on purpose to suffer unparalelled miseries and sorrows in. A body have
thou fitted me. Heb. 10.5. Neither sin, nor sickness had any way enfeebled, or
dulled it.

Secondly, As his pains were sharp, so they were universal, not affecting one
but every part. They seized every member. From head to foot no member was free
from torture. For as his head was wounded with thorns, his back with bloody
lashes, his side with a spear, his hands and feet with nails. So every other
part was stretched and distended beyond its natural length, by hanging upon
that cruel engine of torment the Cross. And as every member, so every
particular sense was afflicted, his sight with vile wretches, cruel murderers
that stood about him. His hearing with horrid blasphemies, belcht out against
him. His taste with vinegar and gall, which they gave to aggravate his misery:
his smell, with that filthy Golgotha where he was crucified, and his feeling
with exquisite pains in every part. So that he was not only sharply, but
universally tormented.

Thirdly, These universal pains were continual, not by fits, but without any
intermission. He had not a moments ease by the cessation of pains. Wave came
upon wave, one grief driving on another, till all Gods waves and billows had
gone over him. To be in extremity of pain, and that without a moments
intermission, will quickly pull down the stoutest nature in the world.

Fourthly, And lastly, as his pains were sharp, universal, and continual; so
they were altogether unrelieved by his understanding part. If a man have sweet
comforts flowing into his soul from God, they will sweetly demulce and allay
the pains of the body. This made the Martyrs shout amidst the flames. Yea even
inferior comforts and delights of the mind will greatly relieve the oppressed
body.

It Is said of Possidonius that in a great fit of the Stone he sol^ced himself,
Nihil agis dolor, quam vis sis molestus, nunquam co^fi^^bor te esse malum.
with discourses of moral virtue, and when the pain twinged him, he would say,
O pain, thou do nothing, though thou art a little troublesome, I will never
confess thee to be evil. And Epicurus in the fits of the Colic refreshed
himself ob memoriam inventorem, (i. e.) by his invention in Philosophy.

But now Christ had no relief this way in the least. Not a drop of comfort came
from heaven into his soul to relieve it, and the body by it. But on the
contrary his soul was filled up with grief, and had an heavier burden of its
own to bear than that of the body. So that instead of relieving, it increased
unspeakably the burden of his outward man. For

Secondly, Let us consider these inward sufferings of his soul,

First, His soul felt the wrath of an angry God, which was terribly impressed
upon it. The wrath of a King is as the roaring of a Lion, but what is that to
the wrath of a Deity? See what a description is given of it in Nahum. 1.16. Who
can stand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fierceness of his
anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
Had not the strength that supported Christ been greater than that of Rocks,
this wrath had certainly overwhelmed, and ground him to powder.

Secondly, As it was the wrath of God that lay upon his soul, so it was the
pure wrath of God, without any allay or mixture. Not one drop of comfort came
from heaven or earth. All the ingredients in his cup were bitter ones. There
was wrath without mercy; yea, wrath without the least degree of sparing mercy;
for God spared not his own Son, Romans 8.32. Had Christ been abated or spared, we
had not. If our mercies must be pure mercies, and our glory in Heaven, pure and
unmixed glory; then the wrath which he suffered, must be pure unmixed wrath.
Yea,

Thirdly, As the wrath, the pure unmixed wrath of God lay upon his soul, so all
the wrath of God was poured out upon him; even to the last drop. So that there
is not one drop reserved, for the Elect to feel. Christ's cup was deep and
large, it contained all the fury and wrath of an infinite God in it. And yet he
drank it up. He bare it all; so that to believing souls, who come to make peace
with God through Christ; he says* Isa. 27.4. Fury is not in me. In all the
chastisements God inflicts upon his people, there is no vindictive wrath.
Christ bare it all in his own soul, and body on the Tree.

Fourthly, As it was all the wrath of God that lay upon Christ, so it was wrath
aggravated in diverse respects, beyond that which the damned themselves do
suffer. That Is strange you will say, can there be any sufferings worse than
those the damned suffer, upon whom the wrath of an infinite God is immediately
transacted! Who holds them up with the arm of his power, while the arm of his
justice lies on eternally. Can any sorrows be greater than these? Yes, Christ's
sufferings were beyond theirs in diverse particulars.

First, None of the damned were ever so near and dear to God, as Christ was.
They were estranged from the womb: but Christ lay in his bosom. When he smote
Christ, he smote the man that was his fellow, Zech. 13.7. But in smiting them,
he smites his enemies. When he had to do in a way of satisfaction with Christ,
he is said not to spare his own Son, Romans 8.32. Never was the fury of God
poured out upon such a person before.

Secondly, None of the damned had ever so large a capacity to take in the full
sense of the wrath of God, as Christ had. The larger any ones capacity is, to
understand and weigh his troubles fully; the more grievous and heavy is his
burden. If a man cast vessels of greater and lesser quantity into the Sea,
though all will be full, yet the greater the vessel is, the more water it
contains. Now Christ had a capacity beyond all mere creatures, to take in the
wrath of his Father. And what deep and large apprehensions ^e had of it, may be
judged by the bloody sweat in the garden, which was the effect of his mere
apprehensions of the wrath of God. Christ was a large vessel indeed. As he is
capable of more glory, so of more sense and misery than any other person in the
world.

Thirdly, The damned suffer not so innocently as Christ suffered, they suffer
the just demerit, and recompense of their sin. They have deserved all that
wrath of God which they feel, and must feel for ever. It is but that recompense
which was meet. But Christ was altogether innocent. He had done no iniquity,
neither was guile found in his mouth, yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
When Christ suffered, he suffered not for what we had done; but his sufferings
were the sufferings of a surety, paying the debts of others. The Messiah was
cut off, but not for himself, Dan. 9.26. Thus you see what his external
sufferings in his body, and his internal sufferings in his soul were.

Thirdly, In the last place it is evident that such extreme sufferings I
thirst. For let us consider

First, What mere external pains, and outward afflictions can do. These prey
upon, and consume our spirits. So David complains, Psalm. 39.11. Sicut enim uter
fumo maceratur, and torrefit; ita animus assiduis doloribus and continuo
malorum aesta exhauritur and c^nsumitur. Moller. in Loc.
When thou with rebukes, correctest man for iniquity; thou make his beauty to
consume away as a Moth, (i. e.) look as a Moth frets and consumes the most
strong and well wrought garment, and makes it seary and rotten without any
noise, so afflictions wast, and wear out the strongest bodies. They make bodies
of the firmest constitution, like an old rotten garment. They shrivel and dry
up the most vigorous and flourishing body, and make it like a bottle in the
smoke, Psalm. 119.83.

Secondly, Consider what mere internal troubles of the soul, can do upon the
stongest body. These quickly spend it is strength, and devour the Spirits. So
Solomon speaks, Prove. 17.22. A broken Spirit dries the bones, (i. e.) it
consumes the very marrow with which they are moistened. So Psalm. 32.3, 4. My
bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy
hand was heavy on me; my moisture (or chief sap) is turned into the drought of
Summer. What a spectacle of pity was Francis Spira become, merely through the
anguish of his spirit? A spirit sharpened with such troubles, like a keen knife,
cuts through the sheath. Certainly who ever has had any acquaintance with
troubles of soul, knows by sad experience, how like an internal flame it feeds
and preys upon the very spirits; so that the strongest stoop, and quail under
it. But

Thirdly, When outward bodily pains, shall meet with inward spiritual troubles;
and both in extremity shall come in one day; how soon must the firmest body
fail* and wast away like a candle lighted at both ends! Now streng^h fails a
pace, and nature must fall flat under this load. When the Ship in which Paul
sailed, fell into a place where two Seas met, it was quickly wrackt, and so
will the best constituted body in the world, if it fall under both these
troubles together. The soul and body sympathize with each other under trouble,
and mu^ually relieve each other.

If the body be sick and ^ull of pain, the spirit supports, chears, and
relieves it by reason and resolution all that it can. And if the spirit be
afflicted, the body sympathizes, and helps to bear up the spirit. But now, if
the one be over-laid with strong pains, more than it can bear, and calls for
aid from the other, and the other be oppressed with intolerable anguish, and
cries out under a burden greater than it can bear, so that it can contribute no
help, but instead thereof adds to its burden which before was above strength to
bear. Now nature must needs fail, and the friendly union betwixt soul and body,
suffer a dissolution by such an overwhelming pressure as this. So it was with
Christ, when outward and inward sorrows met in one day in their extremity upon
him. Hence the bitter cry, I thirst.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
How horrid a thing is Sin! How great is that evil of evils! Which deserves
that all this should be inflicted and suffered for the expiation of it!

The sufferings of Christ for sin, gives us the true account, and fullest
representation of its evil. Mr. I. ^. in his Evil of Evils. p. 12^.
The Law (says one) is a bright glass* wherein we may see the evil of sin; but
there is the Red glass of the sufferings of Christ; and in that we may see more
of the ev^l of sin; than if God should let us down to Hell and there we should
see all the tortures and torments of the damned. If we should see them* how
they lie sweltering under Gods wrath there, it were not so much as the
beholding of sin, through this Red glass of the sufferings of Christ.

Suppose the bars of the bottomless pit were broken up, and damned spirits
should ascend from thence, and come up among us; with the chains of darkness
rattling at their heels, and we should hear the groans, and see the ghastly
paleness, and tremblings of those poor creatures, upon whom the righteous God
has impressed his fury and indignation; if we could hear how their consciences
are lashed by the fearful scourge of guilt, and how they shriek at every lash
the arm of Justice gives them.

If we should see and hear all this, it is not so much as what we may see in
this Text; where the Son of God under his sufferings for it, cries out, I
thirst. For as I showed you before, Christ's sufferings in diverse respects were
beyond theirs. O then, let not thy vain heart slight sin; as if it were but a
small thing. If ever God show thee the face of sin in this glass, thou will
say, there is not such another horrid representation to be made to a man in all
the world. Fools make a mock of sin, but wise men tremble at it.

Inference 2.
How afflictive and intolerable are inward troubles. Infer. 2.
Did Christ complain so sadly under them, and cry, I thirst. Surely then they
are no such light matters as many are apt to make of them. If they so scorcht
the very heart of Christ, dried up the green tree, preyed upon his very
spirits, and turned his moisture into the drought of Summer: they deserve not
to be slighted, as they are by some. The Lord Jesus was fitted to bear and
suffer as strong troubles as ever befell the nature of man, and he did bear all
other troubles with admirable patience; but when it came to this, when the
flames of Gods wrath scorched his soul; then he cries, I thirst.

David's heart was for courage as the heart of a Lion, but when God exercised
him with inward troubles for sin; then he roars out under the anguish of it. I
am feeble, and sore broken; I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my
heart. My heart pants, my strength fails me; as for the light of mine eyes,
it is also gone from me, Psalm. 38.8, 10. A wounded spirit who can bear? Many
have professed that all the torments in the world, are but toys to it. The
racking fits of the Gout, the grinding tortures of the Stone, are nothing to
the wrath of God, set on upon the conscience. What is the worm that never dies,
but the efficacy of a guilty conscience? This worm feeds and nibbles upon the
very inwards, upon the tender and most sensible part of man; and is the
principal part of Hells horror. In bodily pains, a man may be relieved by
proper medicines, here nothing but the blood of sprinkling relieves outward
pains; the body may be supported by the resolution and courage of the mind,
here the mind it self is wounded. O let none despise these troubles, they are
dreadful things.

Inference 3.
Infer..3
How dreadful a place is Hell! Where this cry is heard for ever, I thirst.
There the wrath of the great and terrible God flames upon the damned for ever,
in which they thirst and none relieve them. If Christ complained, I thirst,
when he had conflicted but a few hours with the wrath of God; what is their
state then, that are to grapple with it for ever! When millions of years are
past and gone, Tunc edax flamina combur^t, q^os nu^c carnalis delectatio
pollui^. Tunc infinitum patens inferni barathrum, etc. Greg.
ten thousand millions more are coming on. There Is an everlasting thirst in
Hell, and it admits of no relief. There are no full cups in Hell, but an
eternal unrelieved thirst. Think on this ye that now add drunkenness to thirst,
who tumble in all sensual pleasures, and drown nature in an excess of Luxury.
Remember what Dives said in Luke 16.24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham,
have mercy on me; and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in
water, and cool my tongue, An English Merchant living at Bantzick related this
story to a godly Minister, that a friend of his (a Merchant also) went to a
Covent, and dined with the Friars there, their entertainment was very noble;
after he had dined and seen all, the Merchant fell to commending their pleasant
lives; yea, said one of the Friars to him, we live gallantly indeed, had we any
body to go to Hell for us when we die. Mr Firmins R^al Christian.
for I am tormented in this flame. No cups of water, no bowls of wine in Hell.
There that throat will be parched with thirst, which is now drowned with
excess. The songs of the Drunkard turned into howlings. If thirst in the
extremity of it be now so unsufferable, what is that thirst which is infinitely
beyond this in measure, and never shall be relieved. Say not it is hard that God
should deal thus with his poor creatures. You will not think it so if you
consider what he exposed his own dear Sou to, when sin was but imputed to him.
And what that man deserves to feel, that has not only merited Hell, but by
refusing Christ the remedy, the hottest place in Hell.

In this thirst of Christ we have the liveliest emblem of the state of the
damned, that ever was pres^nted to men in this world. Here you see a person
laboring in extremity under the infinite wrath of the great and terrible God
lying upon his soul and body at once, and causing him to utter this doleful
cry, I thirst. Only Christ endured this but a little while, the damned must
endure it for ever. In that they differ. As also in the innocence and ability
of the persons suffering. And in the end for which they suffer. But surely such
as this, will the cry of those souls be that are cast away for ever. O terrible
thirst!

Inference 4.
How much do nice and wanton Appetites deserve to be reproved! Infer. 4.
The Son of God wanted a draught of cold water to relieve him, and could not
have it; God has given us variety of refreshing creatures to relieve us, and
we despise them. We have better things than a cup of water to refresh and
delight us when we are thirsty, and yet are not pleased. O that this complaint
of Christ on the Cross, I thirst, were but believingly considered, it would
make you bless God, for what you now despise. And beget contentment in you, for
the meanest mercies, and most common favors in this world. Did the Lord of all
things cry, I thirst, and had nothing in his extremity to comfort him, and do
thou who have a thousand times over forfeited all temporal, as well as
spiritual mercies contemn and slight the good creatures of God! What, despise a
cup of water, who deservest nothing but a cup of wrath, from the hand of the
Lord! O lay it to heart and hence learn contentment with any thing.

Inference. 5.
Did Jesus Christ upon the Cross cry, Infer. 5.
I thirst, then believers shall never thirst eternally. Their thirst shall be
certainly satisfied.

There is a three fold thirst, gracious, natural, and penal. The gracious
thirst, is the vehement desire of a spiritual heart after God. Of this David
speaks, Psalm. 42.1, 2. As the heart pants after the water brooks, so pants
my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when
shall I come and appear before God? And this is indeed a vehement thirst, it
makes the soul break with the longings it has after God, Psalm. 119. It Is a
thirst proper to believers, who have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

Natural thirst is (as before was noted) a desire of refreshment by humid
nourishment, and it is common both to believers and unbelievers in this world.
Gods dear Saints have been driven to such extremities in this life, that their
tongues have even failed for thirst. When the poor and needy seek water, and
there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, Isa. 41.17. And of the
people of God in their Captivity it is said, Lam. 4.4. The tongue of the sucking
child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst. The young children ask
bread, and no man breaks it unto them. They that feed delicatly are desolate
in the streets, they that were brought up in scarlet, embrace dunghills. To
this many that fear the Lord have been reduced. A penal thirst is Gods just
denying of all refreshment, or relief to sinners in their extremities, and that
as a due punishment for their sin. This believers shall never feel, because
when Christ thirsted upon the Cross he made full satisfaction to God in their
room. These sufferings of Christ as they were ordained for them, so the
benefits of them are truly imputed to them. And for the natural thirst, that
shall be satisfied. For in heaven we shall live without these necessities, and
dependencies upon the creature. (...)
We shall be equal with the Angels in the way and manner of living and
subsisting. Luke 20.36. And for the gracious thirsting of their souls for God,
it shall be fully satisfied. So its promised, Matthew. 5.6. Blessed are they
which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. They
shall then depend no more upon the stream, but drink from the ever flowing
fountain it self, Psalm 36.8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the
fatness of thy house, and thou shall make them drink of the river of thy
pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light, shall we
see light. There they shall drink, and praise, and praise and drink for
evermore. All their thirsty desires shall be filled with complete satisfaction.
O how desirable a state is heaven upon this account! And how should we be
restless till we come thither; as the thirsty traveller is until he meet that
cool refreshing spring he wants, and seeks for. This present state is a state
of thirsting, that to come of refreshment and satisfaction. Some drops indeed
come from that fountain by faith, but they quench not the believers thirst.
Rather like water sprinkled on fire, they make it burn the more; but there the
thirsty soul has enough.

O bless God that Jesus Christ thirsted under the heat of his wrath once, that
you might not be scorched with it for ever. If he had not cried, I thirst, you
must have cried out of thirst eternally, and never be satisfied.

Inference 6.
Lastly, Infer. 6.
Did Christ in the extremity of his sufferings, cry, I thirst. Then how great
beyond all compare is the love of God to Sinners. Who for their sakes exposed
the Son of his love to such extreme sufferings.

Three considerations marvelously heighten that love of the Father.

First, His putting the Lord Jesus into such a condition. There is none of us
would endure to see a Child of our own lie panting, and thirsting in the
extremity of torments, for the fairest inheritance on earth. Much less to have
the soul of a child conflicting with the wrath of God, and making such
heart-rending complaints as Christ made upon the Cross; if we might have the
largest Empire in the world for it: yet such was the strength of the love of
God to us, that he willingly gave Jesus Christ to all this misery and torture
for us. What shall we call this love! O the height, length, depth, and breadth
of that love which passes knowledge! The love of God to Jesus Christ was
infinitely beyond all the love we have to our children, as the Sea is more than
a spoonful of water: and yet as dearly as he loved him, he was content to
expose him to all this; rather than we should perish eternally.

Secondly, As God the Father was content to expose Christ to this extremity; so
in that extremity to hear his bitter cries, and dolorous complaints; and yet
not relieve him with the least refreshment till he fainted, and died under it.
He heard the cries of his Son. That voice, I thirst, pierced heaven, and reached
the Fathers ear; but yet he will not refresh him in his agonies, nor abate him
any thing of the debt he was now paying, and all this for the love he had to
poor sinners. Had Christ been relieved in his sufferings and spared, then God
could not have pitied or spared us. The extremity of Christ's sufferings was an
act of Justice to him; and the greatest mercy to us that ever could be
manifested. Nor indeed, (though Christ so bitterly complains of his thirst) was
he willing to be relieved, till he had finished his work. O love unspeakable!
He does not complain, that he might be relieved, but to manifest how great that
sorrow was, which his soul now felt upon our account.

Thirdly, And it should never be forgotten, that Jesus Christ was exposed to
these extremities of sorrow, for sinners, the greatest of sinners; who deserved
not one drop of mercy from God. This commends the love of God singularly to us,
in that whilst we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us, Romans 5.8. Thus the Love
of God in Jesus Christ still rises higher and higher in every discovery of it.
Admire, adore, and be ravished with the thoughts of this Love.

Thanks be to God for his unspeakable Gift.
The THIRTY FIFTH Sermon. 35.
SERMON. Opens the sixth excellent saying of Christ upon the Cross.

JOH. XIX.XXX. When Jesus therefore had received the Vinegar he said [it is
Finished,] and bowed his head, and gave up the Ghost.


IT is finished, This is the sixth remarkable word of our Lord Jesus Christ
upon the Cross, uttered as a Triumphant shout when he saw the glorious issue of
all his sufferings now at hand. (...) Cypr. Sect. 568.


It is but one word in the original, but in that one word is contained the sum
of all Joy. The very spirits of all divine consolation. The ancient Greeks
reckoned it their excellency to speak much in a little. To give a Sea of
matter, in a drop of language. What they only sought, is here found. I find
some variety (and indeed variety, rather than contrariety) among expositors
about the relation of these words. Docet in ^jus mor^e totum salutis nostrae
complementum, and si^gulas parts contineri. H^is doctrinae annexa est omnium
legis rituum abrogatio. Calv.
Some are of opinion that the antecedent is the legal Types and Ceremonies. And
so make this to be the meaning. It is finished: that is, all the Types and
Prefigurations that shadowed forth the Redemption of souls by the blood of
Christ, are now fulfilled and accomplished. And doubtless as this is in it self
a truth, so it is such a truth as may not be excluded, as alien to the true
scope and sense of this place.

And though it be objected that many Types and Prefigurations remained at this
time unsatisfied, even all that looked to the actual death of Christ, his
continuance in the state of the dead, and his resurrection; yet it is easily
removed, by considering that they are said to be finished, Factum dicit, quod
jam in ^o fuit, and poe^e factum esset. Camer.
because they were just finishing, or ready to be finished. And it is as if
Christ had said, I am now putting the last hand to it. A few moments of time
more will complete and finish it. I have the sum now in my hand, which will
fully satisfy and pay God the whole debt.

It is now but bow the head and the work is done, and all the Types therein
fulfilled. So that this cannot exclude the fulfilling of the Types in the death
of Christ from their just claim to the sense of this place. But yet though we
cannot here exclude this sense, we cannot allow it to be the whole, or
principal sense. For lo a far greater truth is contained herein, even the
finishing or complement of the whole design and project of our Redemption, and
therein of all the Types that prefigured it. Both these judicious Calvin
conjoyns; making the completing of redemption the principal, and the
fulfilling of all the Types the Collateral and less principal sense of it.

Yet it must be observed, when we say Christ finished Redemption-work by his
death; the meaning is not that his death alone did finish it: for his abode in
the grave, resurrection and ascension, had all of them their joint influence
into it: but these being shortly to follow are all included in the scope of
this place. According then to the principal scope of the place we observe.

DOCT. That Jesus Christ has perfected, Doct.
and completely finished the great work of Redemption committed to him by God
the Father.
To this great truth the Apostle gives a full testimony, Heb. 10.14. By one
offering he has perfected for ever, them that are sanctified. And to the same
purpose speaks Joh. 17.4. I have glorified thee on earth; I have finished the
work* thou gave me to do. Concerning this work and the finishing thereof by
Jesus Christ upon the Cross; we shall enquire, what this work was, how Christ
finished it; and what evidence can be produced for the finishing of it.

First, What was the work which Christ finished by his death?

It was the fulfilling the whole Law of God in our room, and for our Redemption
as a Sponsor, or surety for us. The Law is a glorious thing. The holiness of
God, that fiery attribute, is engraven or stamped upon every part of it. Deuteronomy.
33.2. From his right hand went a fiery Law. The jealousy of the Lord watched
over every point and tittle of it, for his dreadful and glorious name was upon
it. It cursed every one that continued not in all things contained therein,
Gal. 3.10. Two things therefore were necessarily required in him that should
perfectly fulfill it, and both found in our surety, and in him only; viz. a
subjective and effective perfection.

First, A subjective perfection. He that wanted this, could never say it is
finished. Perfect working, always follows a perfect being. That he might
therefore fini^h this great work of obedience, and therein the glorious design
of our Redemption; lo, in what shining and perfect holiness was he produced?
Luke 1.35. That holy thing that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son
of God: and indeed, such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, Heb. 7.26. So that the Law could have no
exception against his person. Nay it was never so honored since its first
promulgation, as it was by having such a perfect and excellent person as
Christ, to stand at its Bar; and give it due reparation.

Secondly, There must be also an effective perfection, or a perfection of
working, and obeying, before it could be said, it is finished. This Christ had;
for he continued in all things, written in the Law, to do them. He fulfilled
all righteousness, as it behoved him to do. Matthew. 3.15. He did all that was
required to be done. And suffered all that was requisite to be suffer^d. He did
and suffered all that was commanded, or threatened; in such perfection of
obedience, both active and passive, that the pure eye of divine Justice could
not find a flaw in it. And so finished the work his Father gave him to do. And
this work finished by our Lord Jesus Christ, was both a necessary, difficult,
and precious work.

First, It was a necessary work, which Christ finished upon the Cross.
Necessary upon a threefold account.

Opus necessarium ex part Patris.
It was necessary on the Fathers account. I do not mean, that God was under any
necessity from his nature of redeeming us this, or any other way. For our
Redemption is opus liberi consilii, an effect of the free counsel of God; but
when God had once decreed, and determined to redeem and save poor sinners by
Jesus Christ; then it became necessary that the counsel of God should be
fulfilled. Act. 4.28. To do whatsoever thy hand, and counsel had before
determined to be done.

Ex part Filii.
Secondly, It was necessary with respect to Christ. Upon the account of that
previous compact that was betwixt the Father and him about it. Therefore it is
said by Christ himself, Luke 22.22. Truly the Son of Man goes as it was
determined, (i. e.) as it was fore-agreed, and covenanted under the necessity
of fulfilling his engagement to the Father, he came into the world; and being
come, he still minds his engagement, Joh. 9.3. I must work the works of him
that sent me.

Ex part nostri.
Thirdly, Yea, and it was no less necessary upon our account that this work
should be finished. For had not Christ finished this work, sin had quickly
finished all our lives, comforts and hopes. Without the finishing this work,
not a Son or Daughter of Adam could ever have seen the face of God. Therefore
it is said, Joh. 3.14, 15. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so
[must] the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believes in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life. On all these accounts the finishing of this
work was necessary.

Secondly, As it was necessary this work should be finished, so the finishing
of it, was exceeding difficult. It cost many a cry, many a groan, many a tear,
many a hard tug, before Christ could say it is finished. All the Angels in
Heaven were not able by their united strength to lift that burden one inch from
the ground, which Christ bare upon his shoulders, yea, and bare it away. But
how heavy a burden this was, may in part appear, by his propassion in the
Garden, and the bitter out-crys he made upon the Cross, which in their proper
places have been opened.

Thirdly, and Lastly, It was a most precious work which Christ finished by his
death. That work was dispatched, and finished in few hours, which will be the
matter of everlasting songs and triumphs to the Angels and Saints to all
eternity. O it was a precious work. The mercies that now flow out of this
fountain, viz. Justification, Sanctification, Adoption, etc. are not to be
valued. Besides the endless happiness and glory of the coming-world, which
cannot enter into the heart of man to conceive. If the Angels sang when the
foundation stone was laid, what shouts, what triumphs, should there be among
the Saints when this voice is heard, It is finished?

Secondly, Let us next inform our selves how, and in what manner obedientially,
freely, diligently and fully.

First, This blessed work was finished by Jesus Christ most obediently. Phil.
2.8. Obed^entia s^rvi, non servil^s.
He became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross. His obedience was
the obedience of a servant, though not servile obedience. So it was foretold of
him, before he touched this work. Isai. 50.5. The Lord God has opened mine
ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back, (i. e.) my Father told
me the very worst of it. He told me what hard and heavy things I must undergo,
if ever I finished this design of redemption; and I was not rebellious, (i. e.)
I heartily submitted to, and accepted all those difficulties. For there is a
Meiosis in the words. I was content to stoop to the hardest and most
ignominious part of it, rather than not finish it.

Secondly, As Christ finished it obediently, so he finished it freely. Freedom
and obedience in acting are not at all opposite to, or exclusive of each other.
Moses his Mother nursed him in obedience to the command of Pharaohs daughter,
yet most freely, with respect to her own delight, and contentment in tha^ work.
So it is said of Christ, and that by his own mouth. Joh. 10.17, 18. Therefore
does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my self; I have power to lay it
down, and I have power to take it again; this commandment have I received of my
Father. He liked the work for the ends sake. When he had a prospect of it from
eternity, then were his delights with the Sons of men. Then he rejoiced in the
habitable parts of the earth. Prove. 8.30, 31. And when he came into the world
about it, with what a full and free consent did his heart echo to the voice of
his Father calling him to it? Just as you shall sometimes hear an echo,
answering your voice two or three times over. Psalm. 40. Lo, I come; I delight
to do thy will; thy Law is within my heart. He finished the work freely.

Thirdly, As he finished it freely, so he finished it diligently. He wrought
hard from the morning of his life to the end of it; he was never idle wherever
he was, but went about doing good, Act. 10.38. Sometimes he was so intent upon
his work, that he forgot to eat bread, Joh. 4.30, 31. As the life of some men
is but a diversion from one trifle to another, from one pleasure to another; so
the whole life of Christ was spent and eaten up betwixt one work or another.
Never was a life so filled up with labor. The very moments of his time, were
all employed for God, to finish this work.

Fourthly, and Lastly, he finished it completely and fully. All that was to be
done by way of impetration, Perfectum est, cui nihil de ^st, and cui nihil addi
potest.
and meritorious redemption, is fully done. No hand can come after his. Angels
can add nothing to it. That is perfected to which nothing is wanting, and to
which nothing can be added. Such is the work Christ finished. Whatever the Law
demanded, is perfectly paid. Whatever a sinner needs, is perfectly obtained,
and purchased. Nothing can be added to what Christ has done. He put the last
hand to it, when he said, it is finished. Thus you see what the work was, and
how Christ finished it.

Thirdly, In the Last place let us consider what assurance, or evidence we have
that Christ has so finished redemption-work. And if you pursue that enquiry,
you will find these, among other plain evidences of it.

Non ex di^i^a a^ce tatione, sed ex prop^io valo^c.
First, When Christ died, redemption-work must needs be finished, in as much as
the obedience and blood of Christ, was of infinite value and efficacy,
sufficiently able to accomplish all the ends for which it was shed. And that
not by divine acceptance, but upon the account of its proper value. This
effect, viz. the finishing redemption-work meritoriously by Christ, does not
exceed the power of the cause to which we assign it; viz. the death of Christ.
And if there be a sole sufficient cause in act, what hinders but the effect
should follow? There was certainly enough in Christ's blood, to satisfy the
u^most demand of Justice: when that therefore is actually shed, justice is
fully paid, and consequently the souls for whom, and in whose names it is paid,
fully redeemed from the curse by the merit thereof.

Secondly, It Is apparent that Christ finished the work, by the discharge or
acquittance God the Father gave him, when he raised him from the dead, and set
him at his own right hand. If Christ the sinners Surety be as such, discharged
by God the Creditor; then the debt is fully paid. Now Christ was justified, and
cleared at his resurrection, from all charges and demands of Justice. Therefore
it is sa^d, 1 Timothy 3.16. that he was Justified in the spirit, (i. e.) openly
discharged, by that very act of the Godhead, his raising him from the dead. For
when the grave was opened and Christ rose, it was to him as the opening of the
Prison doors, and setting a Surety at liberty, who was clapped up for another
man's debt. To the same sense Christ speaks of his ascension, Joh. 16.10. The
spirit (says he) shall convince the world of righteousness, (i. e.) of a
complete and perfect righteousness in me, imputable to sinners for their
perfect Justification; and whereby shall he convince and satisfy them that it
is so, why, by this, because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more. There Is
a great deal of force and weight in those words, because you see me no more.
For it amounts to this much, by this you shall be satisfied I have fully and
completely performed all Righteousness, and that by my active and passive
obedience I have so fully satisfied God for you, as that you shall never be
charged or condemned; because when I go to Heaven, I shall abide there in glory
with my Father, and not be sent back again, as I should, if any thing had been
omitted by me. And this the Apostle gives you also in so many plain words. Heb.
10.12, 13, 14. After he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down
on the right hand of God. And what does he infer from that but the very truth
before us, verse. 14. that by one offering he has perfected for ever, them that
are sanctified.

Thirdly, It Is evident Christ has finished the work, by the blessed effects of
it, upon all that believe in him. For by virtue of the compleatness of Christ's
work finished by his death; their Consciences are now rationally pacified, and
their souls at death actually received into glory. Neither of which could be,
if Christ had not in this world finished the work. If Christ had done his work
imperfectly, he could not have given rest and tranquillity to the laboring and
burdened souls that come to him, as now he does. Matthew. 11.28. Conscience would
still be hesitating, trembling, and unsatisfied. And had he not finished his
work, we could not have entrance through the vail of his flesh, into Heaven; as
all that believe in him have. Heb. 10.19, 20. If he had but almost done that
work, we had been but almost saved, that is certainly damned. And thus you see
briefly the evidences, that the work is finished.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Has Christ perfected and completely finished all his work for us, how sweet a
relief is this to us that believe in him, against all the defects and
imperfections of all the works of God, that are wrought by us. There Is nothing
finished that we do. All our duties are imperfect duties, they come off lamely,
and defectively from our hands. It Is Christ's charge against the Church of
Sardis, Rev. 3.2. I have not found thy works (...) perfect, or filled up before
God. Oh there is much emptiness, and vanity in the best of our duties: but
here is the grand relief, and that which answers to all the grounds of our
doubts and fears upon that account, Jesus Christ has finished all his work,
though we can finish none of ours. And so, though we be defective, poor,
imperfect creatures in our selves; yet notwithstanding, we are complete in him,
Col. 2.9, 10. though we cannot perfectly obey, or fulfill one command of the
Law, yet is the righteousness of the Law fulfilled in us that believe, Romans
8.4. Christ's complete obedience being imputed to us, makes us complete, and
without fault before God.

It is true, we ought to be humbled for our defects, and troubled for every
failing in obedience; but we should not be discouraged, though multitudes of
weaknesses be upon us; and many infirmities compass us about in every duty we
put our hand to. Though we have no righteousness of our own, yet of God, Christ
is made unto us righteousness; and that righteousness of his, is infinitely
better than our own. Instead of our own we have his; (i. e.) we have gold for
dung. O blessed be God, for Christ's perfect righteousness.

Inference 2.
Did Christ finish his work with his own hand. Infer. 2.
How dangerous and dishonorable a thing is it, to join any thing of our own,
to the righteousness of Christ, in point of Justification before God! Jesus
Christ will never endure this. It reflects upon his work dishonourably. He does
not (in this case) affect social glory. Not I, and my God; I, and my Christ did
this: he will be all, or none in your Justification. If he have finished the
work, what need of our additions? And if not, to what purpose are they? Can we
finish that which Christ himself could not? But we would fain be sharing with
him in this honor, which he will never endure. Did he finish the work by
himself, and will he ever divide the glory and praise of it with us? No, no,
Christ is no half Savior. O it is an hard thing to bring these proud hearts to
live upon Christ for righteousness. We would fain add our penny to make up
Christ's Sum. But if you will have it so, or have nothing to do with Christ, you
and your penny must perish together. Isai. 50. ult. God gives us the
righteousness of Christ, as he gave mannah to the Israelites in the wilderness.
It Is said, Deuteronomy. 8.16. That he fed them with Mannah in the wilderness, that he
might humble them. The quality of the food was not humbling, for it was Angels
food; but the manner of giving it was so. They must live by faith upon God for
it, from day to day. This was not like other food, produced by their own
labor. Certainly God takes the right way to humble proud nature, in calling
sinners wholly off from their own righteousness, to Christ, for their
Justification.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
Did Christ finish his work for us. Then there can be no doubt, but he will also
finish his work in us. As he begun the work of our redemption, and finished it;
so he that has begun the good work in you, will also finish it upon your
souls. And of this the Apostle says he is confident. Phil. 1.6. Jesus Christ
is not only called the Author, but also the Finisher of our faith. Heb. 12.2.
If he begin it, no doubt but he will finish it. And indeed the finishing of his
own work of redemption without us, gives full evidence that he will finish his
work of Sanctification within us. And that because these two works of Christ,
have a respect, and relation to each other: and such a relation, that the work
he finished by his own death, resurrection, and ascension, would be in vain to
us, if the work of sanctification in us should not in like manner be finished.
Therefore as he presented a perfect sacrifice to God, and finished
redemption-work; so will he present every man perfect and complete, for whom he
here offered up himself. For he will not loose the end of all his sufferings at
last. To what purpose would his meritorious impetration be, without complete
and full application? Be not therefore discouraged at the defects and
imperfections of your inherent grace. Be humbled for them, but be not dejected
by them. This is Christ's work, as well as that. That work is finished, and so
will this.

Inference 4.
Infer. 4.
Is Christ's work of Redemption a complete and finishing work. How excellent and
comfortable beyond all compare, is the method and way of faith! Surely the way
of believing is the most excellent way in which a poor sinner can approach God,
for it brings before him a complete, entire, perfect righteousness; and this
must needs be most honorable to God, most comfortable to the soul that draws
nigh to God. O what a complete finished perfect thing is the righteousness of
Christ! The sharp eye of the holy and jealous God cannot find the least flaw,
or defect in it. Let God, or Conscience look upon it. Turn it every way, view
it on every side, thoroughly weigh and examine it, it will appear a pure, a
perfect piece, containing in it, whatsoever is necessary for the reconciling of
an angry God, or pacifying of a distressed and perplexed soul. How pleasing
therefore and acceptable to God must be that faith, which presents so complete
and excellent an atonement to him! Hence the acting of our faith upon Christ
for our righteousness, the approaches of Faith to God with such an acceptable
present, Opus Deo gratum.
is called the work of God. That is, the most grateful, acceptable and well
pleasing work to God, that a creature can perform. Joh. 6.29. This is the work
of God that ye believe. One act of faith pleases him more, than if you shoul
toil and drudge all your lives at a task of obedience to the Law. As it is more
for Gods honor, and thy comfort to pay all thou owe him at one round
payment, in one full sum, than to make a dribling payment by a penny a day, and
never be able to make full payment, or see the bond cancelled. This perfect
work, only produces perfect peace.

and work out all that God gave him to do; till he had finished his work: How
necessary then is a laborious working life to all that call themselves
Christians? The life of Christ you see was a laborious life. Shall he work, and
we play? Shall a zealous active working Christ, be reproached with idle
negligent and lazy fellows? O work and work out your own salvation with fear
and trembling, Phil. 2.12.

But if Christ wrought so hard, Object.
we may sit still. If he finished the work, nothing remains for us to do.

Nothing of that work which Christ did remains for you to do. Sol.
It Is your commendation and duty to leave all that to Christ; but there is other
work for you to do. Yea, store of work lying upon your hands. You must work a^
well as Christ, though not for the same ends Christ did. He wrought hard to
satisfy the Law, by fulfilling all righteousness. He wrought all his life
long, to work out a righteousness to Justify you before God. This work falls
to no hand but Christ's, but you must work to obey the commands of Christ, into
whose right ye are come by Redemption. You must work to testify your
thankfulness to Christ, for the work he finished for you. You must work to
glorify God by your obedience. Let your light so shine before men. For these
and diverse other such ends and reasons, your life must be a working life. Da
mihi Christum, ^on quaero do^a gratiae, sed Christum. No^ quaro promissiones,
sed Christum. Non quaero sanctificationem, sed Christum. Ne mihi narra fabulam

Brit. p. 45.
God preserve all his people from the gross and vile opinions of Antinomian
Libertines, who cry up grace, and decry obedience. Who under specious pretenses
of exalting a naked Christ upon the throne, do indeed strip him naked of a
great part of his glory, and vilely dethrone him. My pen shall not english,
what mine eyes have read. Tell it not in Gath.

But for thee, Reader, be thou a follower of Christ: imitate thy pattern. Yea,
let me persuade thee as ever thou hopest to clear up thine interest in him,
imitate him in such particulars as these that follow.

First, Christ began early to work for God. He took the mornning of his life,
the very top of the morning to work for God. How is it (said he to his Parents
when he was but a child of about twelve years) that ye sought me? Wist ye not
that I must be about my Fathers business? Reader, if the morning of thy life be
not gone, oh devote it to the work of God, as Christ did. If it be, ply thy
work the closer in the afternoon of thy life. If a man have any great and
necessary business to do, it is good doing in the morning; afterward a hurry of
business and diversion comes on. Secondly, As Christ began betime, so he
followed his work close. He was early up, and he wrought hard; so hard, that he
forgot to eat bread, Joh. 31, 32. So zealous was he, in his Fathers work, that
his friends thought he had been besides himself, Mark 3.21. So zealous, that
the zeal of Gods house eat him up. He flew like a Seraphim, in a flame of zeal,
about the work of God. O be not ye like Snales. ^
What Augustus said of the young Roman, well becomes the true Christian;
whatsoever he does, he does it to purpose. Thirdly, Christ often th^ught upon
the shortness of his time, and wrought hard because he knew his working time
would be but little. So you find it, Joh. 9.4. I most work the works of him
that sent me whilst it is day; the night comes, when no man can work. O in
this be like Christ. Rouse your hearts to diligence with this consideration. If
a man have much to write, and be almost come to the end of his paper; he will
write close, and pack much matter, in a little room. Fourthly, He did much work
for God, and made little noise. He wrought hard, but did not spoil his work
when he had wrought it, by vain ostentation. When he had expressed his Charity in
acts of mercy and bounty to men, he would humbly seal up the glory of it, with
this charge; see ye tell no man of it, Matthew. 8.4. he affected not popular air.
All the Angels in Heaven could not do what Christ did, and yet he called
himself a worm, for all that. Psalm. 22.6. O imitate your pattern. Work hard for
God, and let not pride blow upon it when you have done. It Is hard for a man to
do much, and not value himself for it too much. Fifthly, Christ carried on his
work for God resolvedly. No discouragements would beat him off, though never
any work met with more from first to last. How did Scribes and Pharisees, Jews,
Gentiles, yea Devils, set upon him, by persecutions, and reproaches, violent
oppositions and subtle temptations; but yet, on he goes with his Fathers work
for all that. He is deaf to all discouragements. So it was foretold of him,
Isai. 42.4. He shall not fail, nor be discouraged. O that more of this spirit
of Christ, were in his people. Saevior ab obice ibit.
O that in the strength of love to Christ, and zeal for the glory of God; you
would pour out your hearts in service, and like a River sweep down all
discouragements before you. Sixthly, He continued working, whilst he continued
living. His life, and labor ended together. He fainted not in his work. Nay,
the greatest work he did in this world, was his last work. O be like Christ in
this, be not weary of well doing. Give not over the work of God, while you can
move hand or tongue to promote it. And see that your last works, be more than
your first. O let the motions of your soul after God, be as all natural motions
are, Si dixisti safficit, p^iisti.
swiftest when nearest the center. Say not it is enough, whilst there is any
capacity of doing more for God. In these things Christians be like your
Savior.
Inference 6.
Did Christ finish his work. Infer. 6.
Look to it Christians, that ye also finish your work, which God has given you
to do. That you may with comfort say when death approaches, as Christ said,
Joh. 17.4. I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work, thou
gave me to do; and now O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self. Christ
had a work committed to him, and he finished it; you have a work also committed
to you, O see that you be able to say it is finished, when your time is so. O
work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling: and that I may persuade
you to it, I beseech you lay these considerations close to heart.

First, If your work be not done, before you die, it can never be done, when
you are dead. There Is no work, nor knowledge, nor device in the grave whither
thou go, Eccles. 9.5, 10. They that go down to the pit, cannot celebrate the
name of God, Isai. 38.18. Death binds up the hand from working any more;
strikes dumb the tongue, that it can speak no more: for then the composition is
dissolved. The body which is the souls tool to work by, is broken, and thrown
aside. The soul it self presented immediately before the Lord, to give an
account of all its works. O therefore seeing the night comes, when no man can
work, as Christ speaks, Ioh. 9.4. make haste and finish your work.

Secondly, If you finish not your work, as the season of working, so the season
of mercy will be over at death. Do not think you that have neglected Christ all
your lives, you that could never be persuaded to a laborious holy life, that
ever your cries and entreaties shall prevail with God for mercy, when your
season is past. No, no, it is too late. Will God hear his cry when trouble comes
upon him? Job. 27.9. The season of mercy is then over; as the tree falls so it
lies. Then he that is holy shall be holy still, and he that is filthy shall be
filthy still. Alas, poor souls, you come too late. The Master of the house is
risen up, and the doors are shut, Luke 19.42. the season is over. Happy had it
been, if ye had known the day of your visitation.

Lastly, If your work be not finished when you come to die, you can never
finish your lives with comfort. He that has not finished his work with care,
can never finish his course with joy. Oh what a dismal case is that soul in,
that finds it self surprised by death in an unready posture! To lie shivering
upon the brink of the grave, saying, Lord, what will become of me! O I cannot I
dare not die. For the poor soul to shrink back into the body, and cry; Oh it
were better for me to do any thing than die. Why what is the matter? Oh, I am in
a Christless state, and dare not go before that awful Judgment Seat. If I had
in season made Christ sure, I could then die with peace. Lord, what shall I do?
How do thou like this, Reader? Will this be a comfortable close? When one
asked a Christian that constantly spent six hours every day in prayer, why he
did so? He answered, O I must die, I must die. Well then, look it that ye
finish your work as Christ also did his.

The THIRTY SIXTH Sermon. 36.
SERMON. Opens the seventh and last word with which Christ breathed out his
soul.

LUKE XXIII.XLVI. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit, and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.


THese are the last of the last words of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the Cross,
with which he breaths out his soul. They were David's words before him, Psalm.
31.5. and for substance Stephens after him, Act. 7.57. They are words full both
of faith, and comfort. Fit to be the last breathings of every gracious soul in
this world. They are resolvable into these five particulars

The Person depositing, or committing. The Lord Jesus Christ, who in this as
well as in other things acted as a common person, as the head of the Church.
This must be remarked carefully, for therein lies no small part of a believers
consolation. When Christ commends his soul to God, he does as it were bind up
all the souls of the Elect in one bundle with it; Non privato sui r^spectu
commendat patri animum, sed omnium fidelilium suorum animas quasi uno f^lsiculo
complixas, ^t si^^l cum sua s^rventur. D Pareus.
and solemnly present them all with his, to his Fathers acceptance. To this
purpose one aptly senses it.

This commendation made by Christ, turns to the singular profit and advantage
of our souls; in as much as Christ by this very prayer, Haec Chisti
comrendatio, in ani^arum nostrarum commodum cedebat. Q^i^pe quas ille a corpore
quod inhabitavera^t absolutas, quasi quoddam depositum^ in Dei viventis manu,
ex ora^ione trad^ba^. V^ct. Antioch. in Mark. 9.
has delivered them into his Fathers hand, as a precious treasure, when ever
the time comes that they are to he loosed from the bodies which they now
inhabit. Jesus Christ neither lived nor dyed for himself, but for believers.
What he did in this very act, refers to them as well as to his own Soul. You
must look therefore upon Christ in this last and solemn act of his life, as
gathering all the souls of the Elect together, and making a solemn tender of
them all, with his own soul to God.

Secondly, The depository, or person to whom he commits this precious treasure,
and that was his own Father. Father, into thy hands I commit. Manus haec patris
alias D^i potentiam significat, hic vero pate^n^m Dei praesid^um, etc. Pareus.
Father is a sweet encouraging assuring Title. Well may a Son commit any
concernment how dear soever, into the hand of a Father. Especially such a Son,
into the hands of such a Father. By the hands of the Father into which he
commits his soul, we are not to understand the naked or mere power, but the
Fatherly acceptance and protection of God.

Thirdly, The depositum, or thing committed into this hand, [ my Spirit] i. e.
my soul, now instantly departing, upon the very point of separation from my
body. The soul is the most precious of all treasures, (...) Unicam meam.
it is called the darling, Psalm. 35.17. Or the only one, (i. e.) that which is
most excellent, and therefore most dear and precious. A whole world is but a
trifle, if weighed for the price of one soul, Matthew. 16.26. This inestimable
treasure he now commits into his Fathers hands.

Fourthly, The Act by which he puts it into that faithful hand of the Father
(...) I commend. (...) i. e. (...) Erasmus commendabo nam etiam, Psa. 111.6.
Unde petita sunthaec verba Ch^isti. Legitur fituro tempo^e Bez.
We rightly render it in the present tense, though the word be future. For with
these words he breathed out his Soul. This word is of the same import with
(...), I present or tender it unto thy hands. It was in Christ an act of Faith.
A most special and excellent act, intended as a president for all his people.

Fifthly, And Lastly, the last thing observable is, the manner in Father, into
thy hands I commend my Spirit. Taking then these words, not only as spoken by
Christ the Head of all believers; and so commending their souls to God with his
own, but also as a pattern, teaching them what they ought to do themselves,
when they come to die. We observe.

DOCT. That dying believers are both warranted, Doct.
and encouraged by Christ's example, believingly to commend their precious Souls
into the hands of God.
Thus the Apostle directs the Faith of Christians, to commit their souls to
Gods tuition and Fatherly protection when they are either going into prisons,
or to the stake for Christ, 1 Pet. 4.19. Let them (says he) that suffer
according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well
doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

This Proposition we will consider in these two main branches of it, sc. what
is implied and carried in the souls commending it self to God by Faith, when
the time of separation is come. And what warrant or encouragement gracious
souls have for their so doing.

First, What is employed in this Act of a believer his commending

And if it be thoroughly weighed, you will find these six things at least
carried in it.

Q^isquis in Co^^stum credet, non efflabit in aerem animam morieas, sed ad fid
len despositarium co^fugiet, qui tuto conservet quiequid s^bitraditum est. Calv.
First, It implies this evidently in it, that the soul out-lives the body, and
fails not as to its being, when its body fails. It feels the house in which it
dwelt dropping into ruins, and looks out for a new habitation with God. Father,
into thy hands I commend my Spirit. The soul understands it self a more noble
being than that corruptible body, to which it was united; and is now to leave
in the dust. It understands its relation to the Father of spirits, and from him
it expects protection and provision in its unbodied state; and therefore into
his hands it puts it self. If it vanished or breathed into air, and did not
survive the body; if it were annihilated at death, it were but a mocking of God
to say when we die. Father, into thy hand I commend my Spirit.

Secondly, It implies the souls true rest to be in God. See which way its
motions and tendencies are, not only in life, but in death also. It bends to
its God. It rolls, it even puts it self upon its God and Father: Father, into
thy hands. God is the center of all gracious Spirits. While they tabernacle
here, they have no rest but in the bosom of their God. When they go hence,
their expectation and earnest desires are to be with him. It had been working
after God by gracious desires before, it had cast many a longing look
heavenward before, Ru^re in anpl^xus.
but when the gracious soul comes near its God, (as it does in a Dying hour)
then it even throws it self into his arms. As a River that after many turnings
and windings, Locus ne ^uicquam val^^, neque coeli amoenitas ipsa, per se
b^a^o^um spi^ituum b^atudinem auget; nisi qua Dei habi atio est, Park^r de
descensu. L^b. 2. p. 132.
at last is arrived to the Ocean; it pours it self with a central force into
the bosom of the Ocean, and there finishes its weary course. Nothing but God
can please it in this world, and nothing but God can give it content when it
goes hence. It is not the amoenity of the place, whither the gracious soul is
going, but the bosom of the blessed God who dwells there, that it so vehemently
pants after. Not the Fathers house, but the Fathers arms and bosom. Father,
into thy hands I commend my Spirit. Whom have I in heaven but thee? And o^
earth there is none that I desire in comparison of thee, Psalm. 73.24, 25.

Thirdly, It also implies the great value believers have for their souls.
That Is the precious treasure. And their main solicitude and chief care is to
see it secured in a sa^e hand. Father, into thy hands I commit my Spirit, they
are words speaking the believers care for his soul. That it may be safe, what
ever becomes of the vile body. A believer when he comes nigh to death, spends
but few thoughts about his body; where it shall be laid, or how it shall be
disposed of: he trusts that in the hands of friends; but as his great care all
along was for his soul, so he expresses it in these his very last breathings,
in which he commends it into the hands of God. It is not Lord Jesus receive my
body, take care of my dust, but receive my spirit. Lord, secure the Jewel, when
the Casket is broken.

Fourthly, These words implie the deep sense that dying believers have of the
great change that is coming upon them by death; when all visible and sensible
things are shrinking away from them, and failing. They feel the world, and the
best comforts in it failing. Every creature and creature comfort failing. For
at death we are said to fail, Luke 16.9. Hereupon the soul clasps the closer
about its God, clings more close than ever to him. Father, into thy hands I
commend my Spirit. Not that a mere necessity puts the soul upon God. Or that it
cleaves to God, because it has then nothing else to take hold on. No, no, it
chose God for its portion when it was in the midst of all its outword
enjoyments, and had as good security as other men have for the long enjoyment
of them; but my meaning is, that although gracious souls have chosen God for
their portion, and do truly prefer him, to the best of their comforts; yet in
this compounded state, it lives not wholly upon its God; but partly by faith,
and partly by sense. Partly upon things seen, and partly upon things not seen.
The creatures had some interest in their hearts, alas, too much: but now all
these are vanishing and it sees they are so. I shall see man no more, with the
inhabitants of the world, (said sick Hezeckiah) hereupon it turns it self from
them all, and casts it self upon God for all its subsistence. Expecting now to
live upon its God entirely, as the blessed Angels do. And so in faith they
throw themselves into his arms. Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.

Fifthly, It implies the atonement of God, and his full reconciliation to
believer, by the blood of the great sacrifice. Else they durst never commit
their souls into his hands. For it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God, Heb. 12.29. (i. e.) of an absolute God a God unattoned by the
offering up of Christ. The soul dare no more cast it self into the hands of God
without such an attoning sacrifice, than it dares approach to a devouring fire.
And indeed the reconciliation of God by Jesus Christ, as it is the ground of
all our acceptance with God; for we are made accepted in the beloved. So it is
plainly carried in the order or manner of the reconciled souls committing it
self to him; for it first casts it self into the hands of Christ, then into the
hands of God by him. So Stephen when dying, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit. And
by that hand, it would be put into the Fathershand.

Sixthly, And lastly, It implies both the efficacy, and excellency of Faith in
supporting and relieving the soul at a time when nothing else is able to do it.
Faith is its conduct, when it is at the greatest loss, and distress that ever
it met with. It secures the soul when it is turned out of the body. When heart
and flesh fail, this leads it to the rock that fails not. It sticks by that
soul till it see it safe through all the territories of Satan, and safe Landed
upon the shore of Glory; and then is swallowed up in vision. Many a favor it
has shown the soul while it dwelt in its body. The great service it did for
the soul was in the time of its espousals to Christ. This is the marriage knot.
The blessed bond of union betwixt the soul and Christ. Many a relieving sight,
secret and sweet support it has received from its faith since that; but surely
its first and last works are its most glorious works. By faith it first
ventured it self upon Christ. Threw it self upon him in the deepest sense of
its own vileness, and utter unworthiness, when sense, reason, and multitudes of
temptations stood by contradicting and discouraging the soul. By faith it now
casts it self into his arms, when it is lanching out into vast eternity.

They are both noble acts of Faith, but the first no doubt is the greatest and
most difficult. For when once the soul is interessed in Christ, it is no such
difficulty to commit it self into his hands, as when it had no interest at all
in him. It Is easier for a child to cast himself into the arms of its own Father
in distress, than for one that has been both a stranger and enemy to Christ,
to cast it self upon him, that he may be a Father, and a friend to it.

And this brings us upon the second enquiry I promised to satisfy, sc.

What warrant, or encouragement have gracious souls to commit

First, This God upon whom the believer rolls himself at death, is its Creator.
Haustus ex divi^o O^igine.
The Father of its being. He created, and inspired it, and so it has relation
of a creature to a Creator, yea, of a creature now in distress, to a faithful
Creator, 1 Pet. 4.19. Let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit
the keeping of their souls to him in well doing; as to a [faithful Creator.]
It Is very true, this single relation in it self gives little ground of
encouragement; unless the creature had conserved that integrity in which it was
originally created. And they that have no more to plead with God for
acceptance, but their relation to him as creatures, to a Creator; will
doubtless find that word made good to their little comfort, Isa. 27.11. It is a
people of no understanding, therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on
them, and he that formed them, will show them no favor. But now, grace brings
that relation into repute. Holiness ingratiates us again, and revives the
remembrance of this relation. So that believers only can plead this.

Secondly, As the gracious soul is his creature, so it is his redeemed
creature. One that he has bought, and that with a great price. Even with the
precious blood of Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. 1.18. This greatly encourages the
departing soul, to commit it self into the hands of God, so you find, Psalm.
31.5. Into thy hands I commend my Spirit, thou have redeemed it, O Lord God of
truth. Surely this is mighty encouragement, to put it self upon God in a dying
hour. Lord, I am not only thy creature, but thy redeemed creature. One that
thou have bought with a great price. O I have cost thee dear. For my sake
Christ came from thy bosom, and is it imaginable that after thou have in such a
costly way, even by the expense of the precious blood of Christ redeemed me;
thou should at last exclude me. Shall the ends both of Creation, and
Redemption of this soul be lost together? Will God form such an excellent
creature as my soul is, in which are so many wonders of the wisdom and power of
its Creator? Will he be content when sin had marred the frame, and defaced the
glory of it, to recover it to himself again by the death of his own dear Son,
and after all this cast it away, as if there were nothing in all this? Father,
into thy hands I commend my Spirit. I know thou will have a respect to the work
of thy hands. Especially to a redeemed creature, upon which thou have been out
so great sums of Love; which thou have bought at so dear a rate.

Thirdly, Nay that is not all; the gracious soul may confidently and securely
commit it self into the hands of God when it parts with its body at death; not
only because it is his creature, his redeemed creature, but because it is his
renewed creature also. And this lays a firm ground ^or the believers confidence
of acceptec^a, not that it is the proper cause or reason of its acceptance, but
as it is the souls best evidence that it is accepted with God, and shall not be
refused by him, when it comes to him at death. For in such a soul there is a
double workmanship of God, both glorious pieces, though the last exceeds in
glory. A natural workmanship, in the excellent frame of that noble creature the
soul. And a gracious workmanship upon that again. A new creation upon the old.
Glory upon Glory. We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 2.10.
The Holy Ghost came down from heaven on purpose to create this new workmanship.
To frame this new creature. And indeed it is the Top and glory of all Gods
works of wonder in this world. And must needs give the believer encouragement
to commit it self to God whether at such a time, it shall reflect either upon
the end of the work, or upon the end of the workman; both which meet in the
salvation of the soul so wrought upon the end of the work in our glory. By this
we are made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,
Col. 1.12. It is also the design and end of him that wrought it, 2 Cor. 55. Now
he that has wrought us for the self same thing is God. Had he not designed thy
soul for glory, the spirit should never have come upon such a sanctifying
design as this. Surely it shall not sail of a reception into glory, when it is
cast out this Tabernacle. Such a work was not wrought in vain, neither can it
ever perish. When once sanctification comes upon a soul, it so roots it self in
the soul, that where the soul goes, it goes. Gifts indeed, they die. All
natural excellency and beauty, that goes away at death, Job 4. ult. But grace
ascends with the soul. It is a sanctified, when a separate soul. And can God
shut the door of Glory upon such a soul, that by grace is made meet for the
inheritance? O it cannot be.

Fourthly, As the gracious soul is a renewed soul, so it is also a Sealed Soul.
God has sealed it in this world for that glory, into which it is now to enter
at death. All gracious souls are sealed objectively, (i. e.) they have those
works of grace wrought on their souls, which do (as but now is said) ascertain
and evidence their Title to glory. And many are sealed formally. That is the
spirit helps them clearly to discern their interest in Christ, and all the
promises. This both secures heaven to the soul in it self, and becomes also an
earnest or pledge of the glory in the unspeakable joys and comforts that it
breeds in the soul. So you find, 2 Cor. 1.22. Who has sealed us, and given us
the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. Gods sealing us gives high security.
His objective seal makes it sure in it self, his formal seal makes it so to us.
But if over and above all this, he will please as a fruit of that his sealing,
to give us those heavenly unexpressible joys and comforts which are the fruit
of his formal sealing work, to be an earnest, a foretast and hansel of that
glory how can the soul that has found all this, doubt in the least of a
rejection by its God, when at death it comes to him? surely if God have sealed,
he will not refuse you. If he have given you his earnest, he will not shut you
out. Gods earnest is not given in Jest.

Fifthly, Moreover, every gracious soul may confidently cast it self into the
arms of its God when it goes hence, with Father, into thy hands I commit my
Spirit. For as much as every gracious soul is a soul in Covenant with God, and
God stands obliged by his Covenant and Promise to such not to cast them out
when they come unto him. As soon as ever thy soul became his by regeneration,
that Promise became its own, Heb. 13.5. I will never leave you, nor forsake
you. And will he leave the soul now at a pinch, when it never had more need of
a God to stand by it than it has then: every gracious soul is entitled to that
Promise, Ioh. 14.3. I will come again and receive you to my self. And will he
fail to make it good, when the time of the Promise is come, as at death it is?
It cannot be. Multitudes of Promises, the whole Covenant of Promises give
security to the soul against the fears of rejection, or neglect by God. And the
souls dependence upon God, and hanging upon a promise, its every rolling it
self upon God from the encouragement the word gives it, adds to the engagement
upon God. When he sees a poor soul that he has made, redeemed, sanctified,
sealed, and by solemn Promise engaged himself to receive, coming to him at
death, rolling it self upon his faithfulness that promised, saying as David, 2 Samuel 23.5. Though, Lord, there be many defects in me, yet thou have made a
Covenant with me, well ordered in all things and sure; and this is all my
salvation, and all my hope. Lord, I am resolved to send out my soul in an act
of Faith. I will venture it upon the credit of thy Promise. How can God refuse
such a soul? How can he put it off when it so puts it self upon him?

Sixthly, But this is not all, the gracious soul sustains many intimate and
dear relations to that God into whose hands it commends it self at death. It Is
his Spouse, and the consideration of such a day of Espousals may well encourage
it to cast it self into the bosom of Christ, its head and husband. It is a
member of his body, flesh and bones, Ephesians. 5.30. It is his child he its
everlasting Father, Isai. 9.6. It Is his friend. Hence forth says Christ I call
you not servants, but friends, Joh. 15.15. What confidence may these and all
other the dear relations Christ owns to the renewed soul beget in such an hour
as this is. What husband can throw off the dear wife of his bosom, who in
distresses casts her self into his arms! What Father can shut the door upon a
dear child that comes to him for refuge, saying, Father, into thy hands I
commit my self!

Seventhly, and Lastly, The unchangableness of Gods love to his people gives
confidence they shall in no wise be cast out. They know Christ is the same to
them at last, he was at first. The same in the pangs of death, as he was in the
comforts of life. Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them
to the end. Ioh. 13.1. He does not love as the world loves, only in prosperity.
But they are as dear to him when their beauty and strength is gone, as when it
was in the greatest flowrish. If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die,
we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live, or die; we are the Lords, Romans
14.8. take in all these things and weigh them both apart, and together and see
whether they amount not to a full evidence of the truth of this point, that
dying believers are both warranted and encouraged to commend their souls into
the hands of God. Whether they have not every one of them cause to say as the
Apostle did, 2 Timothy 1.12. I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded, that
he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day. The
improvements of all this you have in the following practical Diductions.

Diduction 1.
Diduct. 1.
Are dying believers only warranted and encouraged thus to commend their souls
into the hands of God. What a sad straight then must all dying unbelievers be
in about their souls? Such souls will fall into the hands of God, but that is
their misery, not their priveledge. They are not put by faith into the hands of
mercy, but fall by sin into the hands of justice. Not God, but the Devil is
their Father, Job. 8.44. Whither should the child go, but to its own Father?
They have not one of those forementioned encouragements to cast themselves into
the hands of God, except the naked relation they have to God as their Creator,
and that is as good as none, without the new creation. If they have nothing but
this to plead for their salvation, the Devil has as much to plead as they.
It Is the new creature that brings the first creation into repute again with God.

O dismal! O deplorable case! A pool soul is turning out of house and home and
knows not where to go. It departs and immediately falls into the hands of
justice. The Devil stands by waiting for such a soul whom God will throw to
him, as a Dog for a crust. Little, ah little do the friends of such a one think
whilst they are honoring his dust by a splendid and honorable funeral, what a
case that poor soul is in that lately dwelt there; and what fearful straights,
and extremities it is now exposed to. They will cry indeed, Lord, Lord, open to
us, Matthew. 7.22. But to how little purpose are their vain cries. Will God hear
him when he cries Job. 27.9. It Is a lamentable case.

Diduction 2.
Will God graciously accept, Diduct. 2.
and faithfully keep what the Saints commit to him at death, how careful then
should they be to keep what God commits to them, to be kept for him while they
live. You have a great trust to commit to God when you die, and God has a
great trust to commit to you whilst you live, you expect that he should
faithfully keep what then you shall commit to his keeping; and he expects you
should faithfully keep, what he now commits to your keeping. O keep what God
commits to you, as you expect he should keep your souls when you commit them
unto him. If you keep his truths, he will keep your souls. Because thou have
kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee, etc. Rev. 3.10. Be
faithful to your God, and you shall find him faithful to you. None can pluck
you out of his hand, see that nothing wrest his truths out of your hands. If we
deny him, he also will deny us, 2 Timothy 2.12. Take heed lest those estates you
have gotten as a blessing attending the Gospel, prove a temptation to you to
betray the Gospel. Religion (says one) brings forth Riches, Religio peperit
divitias, sed filia devo avit matrer.
but the Daughter devours the Mother. How can you expect acceptance with God,
who have betrayed his truth, and dealt perfidiously with him?

Diduction 3.
Diduct. 3.
If believers may safely commit their souls into the hands of God, How
confidently may they commit all lesser interests, and lower concernments into
the same hand. Shall we trust him with our souls, and not with our lives,
liberties or comforts? Can we commit the treasure to him, and not a trifle?
Whatever you enjoy in this world, is but a trifle to your souls. Sure if you
can trust him for eternal life for your souls, you may much more trust him, for
the daily bread for your bodies. I know it is objected that God has made over
temporal things to his people upon conditional promises, and an absolute faith
can never be grounded upon conditional promises. But what means this objection?
Let your faith be but suitable to these conditional promises, that is, believe
they shall be made good to you, so far as God sees them good for you. Do you
but labor to come up to those conditions required in you, and thereby God will
have more glory, and you more comfort. If your prayers for these things proceed
from pure ends the glory of God, not the satisfaction and gratification of your
lusts. If your desires after them be moderate as to the measure, content with
that proportion the infinite wisdom sees fittest for you. If you take Gods way
to obtain them, and dare not strain Conscience, or commit a sin, though you
should perish for want. If you can patiently wait Gods time for enlargements
from your straits, and not make any sinful haste. You shall be surely supplied.
And he that remembers your souls will not forget your bodies. But we live by
sense and not by faith. Present things strike our affections more powerfully
than the invisible things that are to come. The Lord humble his people for this.

Diduction 4.
Diduct. 4.
Is this the priveledge of believers, that they can commit their souls to God
in a dying hour, then how precious, how useful a grace is faith to the pleople
of God both living and dying!

All the graces have done excellently, but faith excels them all. Faith is the
Phoenix grace, the Queen of graces. Deservedly is it styled precious faith, 2
Pet. 1.1. The benefits and privileges of it in this life are unspeakable; and
as there is no comfortable living, so no comfortable dying without it.

First, While we live and converse here in the world, all our comfort and
safety is from it, for all our union with Christ the fountain of mercies and
blessings is by faith. Ephesians. 3.17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by
faith. No faith, no Christ. All our communion with Christ is by it. He that
comes to God must believe. Heb. 11.6. The souls life is wrapped up in this
communion with God; and that communion in faith. All communications from Christ
depend upon faith; for look as all communion is founded in union, so from our
union and communion, are all our communications. All communications of
quicknings, comforts, joy, strength, and whatsoever serves to the well-being of
the life of grace are all through that faith which first knit us to Christ, and
still maintains our communion with Christ, believing we rejoice. 1 Pet. 1.8.
The inner man is renewed whilst we look to the things that are not seen, 2 Cor.
4.18.

Secondly, And as our life and all the supports and comforts of it here are
dependent on faith; so you see our death as to the safety and comfort of our
souls then depends upon our faith. He that has no faith cannot commit his soul
to God, but rather shrinks from God. Faith can do many sweet offices for your
souls upon a death bed, when the light of this world is gone, and all joy
ceases on earth. It can give us sights of things invisible in the other world,
and those sights will breathe life into your souls amidst the very pangs of
death.

Reader, do but think what a comfortable foresight of God and the joys of
salvation, will be to thee, when thine eye-strings are breaking. Faith cannot
only see that beyond the grave which will comfort, but it can cling about its
God, and clasp Christ in a promise when it feels the ground of all sensible
comforts trembling and sinking under thy feet. My heart and my flesh fails,
but God is the strength (or rock) of my heart and my portion for ever. Reeds
fail, but the rock is firm footing. Yea, and when the soul can no longer
tabernacle here it can carry the soul to God, cast it upon him, with Father
into thy hands I commend my spirit. O precious faith!

Diduction 5.
Do the souls of dying believers commend themselves into the hands of God.
Diduct. 5.
Then let not the surviving relations of such sorrow as men that have not hope.
A Husband, a Wife, a Child, is rent by death out of your arms, well, but
consider into what arms, into what bosom they are commended. Is it not better
for them to be in the bosom of God, than in yours? Could they be spared so long
from Heaven as to come back again to you but one hour, how would they be
displeased to see your tears, and hear your cries and sighs for them! They
would say to you, as Christ said to the daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for
me, but weep for your selves and your children. I am in a safe hand, I am out
of the reach of all storms and troubles. O did you but know what their state
is, who are with God, you would be more than satisfied about them.

Diduction 6.
Diduct. 6.
Lastly, I will close all with a word of counsel. Is this the privilege of
dying believers to commend their souls into the hands of God. Then as ever you
hope for comfort or peace in your last hour, see that your souls be such as may
be then fit to be commended into the hands of an holy and just God. See that
they be holy souls. God will never accept them, if they be not holy. Without
holiness no man shall see God. Heb. 12.24. He that has this hope, ( viz. to
see God) purifieth himself even as he is pure, 1 John 3.3. Endeavors after
holiness are inseparably connected with all rational expectations of
blessedness. Will you put an unclean filthy defiled thing into the pure hand of
the most holy God? O see they be holy, and already accepted in the beloved, or
woe to them when they take their leaves of those tabernacles they now dwell in.
The gracious soul may confidently say then, Lord Jesus, into thy hands I
commend my spirit. O let all that can say so then, now say,

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ.
The THIRTY SEVENTH Sermon. 37.
SERMON. Treats of Christ's Funeral, opening the manner, reasons, and excellent
ends thereof.

JOH. XIX.XL, XLI, XLII. Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in
linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury: Now in the
place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new
Sepulcher; wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore,
because of the Jews preparation day, for the Sepulcher was nigh at hand.


YOU have heard the last words of dying Jesus, commending his spirit into his
Fathers hands: and now the life of the world hangs dead upon a Tree. The light
of the world for a time muffled up in a dismal cloud. The Son of Righteousness
set in the region and shadow of Death. The Lord is dead, and he that wears the
keys of the grave at his girdle, is now himself to be locked up in the grave.

All you that are the friends and Lovers of Jesus, are this day invited to his
^^neral. Such a funeral as never was since Graves were first dug. Come see
the place where the Lord lay. There are six remarkable particulars about this
funeral in these three verses.

viz. the begging and perfuming of the body. His body could not be buried, till
by begging his friends had obtained it is as a favor from his Judge. The dead
body was by Law in the power of Pilate who adjudged it to death, as the bodies
of those that are hanged, are in the power of the Judge to dispose of them as
he pleases. And when they had gotten it from Pilate, they wind it in fine
linen clothes with Spices. But what need of Spices to perfume that blessed
body. His own Love was perfume enough, to keep it sweet in the remembrance of
his people to all generations. However by this they will manifest as they are
able, the dear affection they have for him.

bearers that carried his body to its Grave, Joseph of Arimathea, and
Nicodemus, two secret Disciples. They were both men of estate and honor. None
could imagine that these would have appeared at a time of so much danger, with
such boldness for Christ. That ever they would have gone openly and boldly to
manifest their love to Christ when dead, who were afraid to come to him (except
by night) when he was living. But now a spirit of Zeal and courage is come upon
them, when those that made greater and more open confessions of him are gone.

Thirdly, The attendants who followed the Hearse, were the women that followed
him out of Galilee. Among whom the two Marys, and the Mother of Zebedes
children (whom Mark calls Salome) are only named.

Fourthly, The Grave or Sepulcher where they laid him. It was in Joseph's new
Tomb, which he had prepared in the garden near unto Golgotha, where our Lord
died. Two things are remarkable about this Tomb. It was another Tomb, and it
was a new Tomb. It was another. For as he had not an house of his own wherein
to lay his head whilst he lived, so he had not a Tomb of his own, to lay his
body in when dead. As he lived in other men's houses, so he lay in another man's
Tomb. And it was a new Tomb wherein never man was yet laid. Doubtless there was
much of providence in this, for had any other been laid there before him, it
might have proved an occasion both to shake the Credit, and slur the glory of
his Resurrection, by pretending it was some former body, and not the Lords,
that rose out of it. In this also divine providence had a respect to that
Prophecy, Esa. 53.9. Which was to be fulfilled at this funeral. He made his
Grave with the rich, because he had done no violence, etc.

Fifthly, The disposition of the body in that Tomb. It Is true, Luke 23.48. So
do doubt they laid him with melting hearts, and flowing eyes in his Tomb, when
dead.

Sixthly, And lastly, the last remarkable particular in the Text Jonah his
Type, and partly to ascertain the world of the reality of his Death. Whence our
observation is

DOCT. That the dead Body of our Lord Jesus Christ was decently interred, Doct.
by a small number of his own Disciples; and continued in the state of the dead
for a time.
This Observation containing matter of fact, and that so plainly and faithfully
delivered to us by the Pens of the several Evangelists; we need do no more to
prepare it for our use, than to satisfy these two inquiries, why had Christ
any funeral at all, since his Resurrection was so soon to follow his Death? And
what manner of funeral Christ had?

First, Why had Christ any funeral at all, since he was to rise again from the
dead within that space of time that other men commonly have to lie by the wall,
before their interment; and had it continued longer unburied, it could see no
corruption, having never been tainted by sin. Why, though there was no need of
it at all upon that account that a funeral is needful for other bodies; yet
there were these four weighty ends and Reasons of it.

Reason 1. First, It was necessary Christ should be buried, to ascertain his
death, else it might have been looked upon as a Cheat. For as they were ready
enough to impose so gross a Cheat upon the world at his Resurrection, That the
D^sciples came by night and stole him away: much more would they have denied at
once the reality both of his death and Resurrection, had he not been so
perfumed and interred: but this cut off all pretentions. For in this kind of
embalming his mouth, ears, nostrils were all filled with their Spices and
odours. Bound up in Linen, and laid long enough in the Tomb to give full
assurance to the world of the certainty of of his death. So that there could be
no latent principle of life in him. Now since our eternal life is wrapped up in
Christ's death, it can never be too firmly established. To this therefore we may
well suppose providence had special respect in his burial, and the manner of it.

Reason 2. Secondly, He must be buried to fulfill the Types, and Prophesies
that went before. His abode in the Grave was prefigured by Ionahs abode three
days and nights in the belly of the Whale, Matthew. 12.40. So must the Son of
man be three days, and threee nights in the heart of the earth. Yea, the
Prophet had described the very manner of his funeral, and long before he was
born foretold in what kind of Tomb his body should be laid, Isa. 53.9. He made
his Grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death. Pointing by that
expression at this Tomb of Joseph, who was a rich man, and the Scriptures
cannot be broken.

Reason 3. Thirdly, He must be buried to complete his humiliation; this being
the lowest step he could possibly descend in his abased state. They have
brought me to the dust of Death. Lower he could not be laid, and so low he must
lay his blessed head; else he had not been humbled to the lowest.

Reason 4. Fourthly, But the great end and reason of his interment was the
conquering of Death in its own dominion, and territories; which victory over
the Grave furnishes the Saints with that triumphant (...) song of deliverance,
1 Cor. 15.55. O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy De^truction!
Our Graves would not be so sweet and comfortable to us, when we come to lie
down in them; if Jesus had not layen there before us, and for us. Death is a
Dragon, the Grave its Den; a place of dread and terror: but Christ's goes into
its Den, there grapples with it, and for ever overcomes it. Disarms it of all
its terror, and not only makes it cease to be enemical, but to become exceeding
beneficial to the Saints. A bed of rest and a perfumed bed. They do but go into
Christ's bed, where he lay before them. For these ends he must be buried.

Secondly, Next let us inquire what manner of funeral Christ

And if we intently observe it, we shall find many remarkable properties in it.

First, We shall find it to be a very obscure and private funeral. Here was no
external pomp or gallantry. Christ affected it not in his life, and it was no
way suitable to the ends and manner of his death. Humiliation was designed in
his death. And state is inconsistent with such an end. Besides he dyed upon the
Tree, and persons so dying don't use to have much ceremony and state at their
funerals. Three things show it to be a very humble and obscure funeral, as to
what concerned outward glory, with which the great ones of the earth are
usually interred. For First, The dead body of the Lord was not brought from his
own house, as other men's commonly are; but from the Tree. They begged it of his
Judge. As who should say go bring the Corpse from Tyburn. Had they not obtained
this favor from Pilate, it must have been buried in Golgotha. It had been
tumbled into a pit, dug under the Cross. Secondly, As it was first begged,
then buried; so it was attended with a very poor train. A few sorrowful women
followed the Bier. Other men are accompanied to their Graves by their
Relations, and Friends. The Disciples were all scattered from him. Afraid to
own him dying, and dead. Thirdly, And these few that were resolved to give him
a funeral, are forced, by reason of the straights of time, to do it in
shuffling haste. Time was short, they take the next sepulcher they can get, and
hurry him away that evening into it. For the preparation for the Passover was
at hand. This was the obscure ^uneral which the body of the Lord had. Thus was
the Prince of the Kings of the earth, who has the Keys of Death and Hell, laid
into his Grave.


Secondly, Yet though men could bestow little honor upon it, the heavens
bestowed several marks of honor upon it. Adorned it with diverse Miracles which
wiped off the reproach of his death from him. These Miracles were antecedent to
his interment, or concomitants of it.

First, There was that extraordinary and preternatural Eclipse of the Sun. Such
an Eclipse as was never seen since it first shone in heaven. The Sun fainted at
the sight of such a ruful spectacle and clothed the whole heaven in black. The
sight of this caused a great Philosopher, who was then far from the place where
this unparalled Tragedy was acting, to cry out upon the sight of it, Aut Deus
nat^rae patitu^, aut mu^di machina dissolvitur. Dionyfius Areopag.
either the God of nature now suffers, or the frame of the world is now
dissolved. The same Dionysius writing to Apollophanes a Philosopher, who would
not embrace the Christian Faith, thus goes about to convince him. What think
thou (says he) of the Eclipse when Christ was Crucified? Were we not both of
us then at Heliopolis? and standing in the same place, did we not see the Moon
in a new manner following the Sun; (...), etc. Theod. Metochit. Hist^. Rom p 39
and not in the time of conjunction, but from the ninth hour until the evening,
by a reason unknown in nature, directly opposite to the Sun? Did thou not
then being greatly terrified say unto me, O my Dionysius, what strange
commutations of the heavenly bodies are these!

Such a preternatural Eclipse is remembered in no other History. For it was not
in time of conjunction, but opposition; the Moon being then at full. From the
sixth, to the ninth hour the Sun and Moon were together in the midst of heaven;
but in the evening she appeared in the East, her own place, opposite to the
Sun. And then miraculously returning from East to West, did not pass by the Sun
and set in the West before it; but kept it company for the space of three
hours, and then returned to the East again. And whereas in all other natural
Eclipses, the Eclipse always begins on the western part of the body of the
Sun, and that part is also first cleared; it was quite contrary in this; for
though the Moon were opposite to the Sun, and distant from it the whole breadth
of heaven; yet with a miraculous swiftness it overtook the Sun, and darkened
first the Eastern part of it; and soon prevailed over its whole body. Which
caused darkness over all the the Land, that is say some over the whole Earth,
or as others, over the whole Land of Iewry. Or as others, over the whole
Horizon, and all places of the same altitude, and latitude. Which is most
probable.

Secondly, And as Christ's funeral was adorned with such a miraculous Eclipse,
which put the heavens and earth into a mourning; so the rocks did rend, the
vail of the Temple rent in twain from top to bottom. The graves opened, and the
dead bodies of many Saints arose and went into the holy City and were seen of
many. The rending of the Rocks was a sign of Gods fierce indignation, Nahum.
1.6. And a discovery of the greatness of his power; showing them what they
deserved, and what he could do to them that had committed this horrid fact;
though he rather chose at this time to show the dreadful effects of it upon
inanimate Rocks, than Rocky hearted sinners. But especially it served to
convince the world that it was none other but the Son of God that dyed. Which
was farther manifested by these concomitant Miracles.

As for the rending in twain of the vail. It was a notable Miracle, plainly
showing that all ceremonies were now accomplished, and abolished. No more vails
now. As also that believers have now most free access into heaven. At that very
instant when the vail rent, the High Priest was officiating in the most holy
place, and the vail which hid him from the people, being rent; they might
freely see him about his work in the holy of holies. A lively Emblem of our
High Priest, whom now we see by faith in the heavens, there performing his
intercession work for us.

The opening of the Graves, plainly showed the design and end of Christ's going
into it. That it might not have dominion over the bodies of the Saints, but
being vanquished and destroyed by Christ, lets go all that are his, whom he
ransomed from the Grave as a prey out of its paws. A Specimen whereof was given
in those holy ones that rose at that time, and appeared to many in the holy
City. Thus was the funeral of our Lord performed by men; Thus was i^ adorned by
Miracles from heaven.

Use.
Use.
And now we have seen Jesus interred. He that wears at his girdle the Keys of
Hell and Death, himself locked up in the Grave. What shall I say of him whom
they now laid in the Grave? Shall I undertake to tell you what he was? What he
did, suffered, and deserved? Alas! The tongues of Angels must pause and stammer
in such a work. I may truly say as Nazianzen said of Basil, no tongue but his
own can sufficiently commend and praise him. He is a Sun of righteousness, a
fountain of life, a bundle of Love. Of him it might be said in that day, Here
lies the lovely Jesus in whom is treasured up whatsoever an angry God can
require for his satisfaction, or an empty creature for his perfection. Before
him was none like him, and after shall none arise comparable to him. Mr. Ienkin.
If every leaf, and spire of grass (says one) nay all the Stars, Sands, and
Atoms were so many Souls and Seraphims; whose love should double in them every
moment to all eternity; yet would it fall infinitely short of what his worth and
excellency exacts. Suppose a creature composed of all the choice endowments
that ever dwelt in the best of men since the Creation of the World, in whom you
find a meek Moses, a strong Sampson, a faithful Jonathan, a beautiful Absalom,
a rich and wise Solomon; nay, and add to this, the understanding, strength,
agility, splendour, and holiness of all the Angels: it would all amount but to a
dark shadow, of this incomparable Jesus.

Who ever weighed Christ in a pair of balances (says another) who has seen
the foldings and plyes, the heights, and depths of that glory which is in him?
O for such a heaven, as but to stand afar off, and see, and love, and long for
him, while times thread be cut, and this great work of Creation dissolved! -- O
if I could yoke in among the thick of Angels, and Seraphims, and now glorified
Saints, and could raise a new Love song of Christ, before all the world. I am
pained with wondering at new opened treasures in Christ. If every finger,
member, bone, and joint were a torch burning in the hottest fire in hell; I
would they could all send out love praises, high songs of praise for ever more
to that plant of renown, to that Royal and high Prince Jesus my Lord. But alas,
his love swells in me, and finds no vent. -- I mar his praises, nay, I know
no comparison of what Christ is, and what he is worth. All the Angels, and all
the glorified, praise him not so much as in halves. Who can advance him, or
utter all his praise? -- O if I could praise him, I would rest content to die
of Love for him. O would to God I could send in my praises to my incomparable
well beloved, or cast my Love songs of that matchless Lord Jesus over the
walls, that they might light in his lap, before men and Angels. -- But when I
have spoken of him till my head rive, I have said just nothing. I may begin
again. A Godhead, a Godhead is a worlds wonder. Set ten thousand thousand new
made worlds of Angels and Elect men, and double them in number ten thousand
thousand thousand times; let their hearts and tongues be ten thousand times
more agile and large than the hearts and tongues of the Seraphims that stand
with six wings before him; when they have said all for the glorifying and
praising of the Lord Jesus; they have spoken little or nothing. O if I could
wear this tongue to the stump in extolling his highness. But it is my daily
sorrow that I am confounded with his incomparable Love.

Thus have his enamoured friends faintly expressed his excellencies, and if
they have therein done any thing, they have shown the impossibility of his due
praises.

Come and see believing souls, look upon dead Jesus in his winding sheet, by
Faith; and say, Lo this is he of whom the Church said, my beloved is White and
Ruddy, his ruddiness is now gone, and a death pale has prevailed over all his
body: but still as lovely as ever, yea altogether lovely.

If David lamenting the death of Saul and Jonathan, said, Daughters of
Jerusalem weep over Saul, who clothed you in Scarlet, with other delights; who
put on ornaments of Gold upon your apparel. Much rather may I say, children of
Sion, weep over Jesus, who clothed you with righteousness, and garments of
Salvation.

This is he who quitted the throne of glory, left the bosom of unspeakable
delights; came in a body of flesh, produced in perfect holiness; brake through
many and great impediments, (thy great unworthiness, the wrath of God and man?
by the strength of love; to bring salvation home to thy soul. Can he that
believingly considers this do less than faint at the sense of that love that
brought him to the dust of death, (...). Ignatius.
and cry out with that Father, my Love was Crucified? But I will insist no
longer upon generals, but draw down the particulars of Christ's Funeral to your
use in the following Corollaries.

Corollary 1.
Cor. 1.
Was Christ buried in this manner, then a decent and mournful Funeral (where it
can be had) is laudable among Christians.

I know the souls of the Saints have no concernment for their bodies, nor are
they solicitous how the body is treated here; yet there is a respect due to
them, as they are the Temples wherein God has been served and honored, by
those holy souls that once dwelt in them. As also upon the account to their
relation to Christ, even when they lie by the walls. And the glory that will be
one day put upon them, when they shall be changed, and made like unto Christ's
glorious body. Upon such special accounts as these their bodies deserve an
honorable treatment, as well as upon the account of humanity, which owes this
honor to the bodies of all men.

To have no funeral is accounted a Judgment, Eccles. 7.4. Or to be tumbled
into a pit without any to lament us, is lamentable. We read of many solemn and
Genesis 23.2. Genesis 35.19. Genesis 50.10 Numb. 20.29. 2 Chro. 35.24. Joh. 11.31. Acts
8.2.
mournful funerals in Scripture, wherein the people of God have affectionatly
paid their respects and honors to the dust of the Saints; as men that were
deeply sensible of their worth, and how great a loss the world sustains by
their remove. Christ's funeral had as much of decency and solemnity in it, as
the time would permit; though he was a stranger to all pomp, both in life and
death.

Corollary. 2.
Cor. 2.
Did Joseph and Nicodemus so boldly appear at a time of so much danger to beg
the body, and give it a funeral, let it be for ever a caution to strong
Christians not to despise, or glory over the weak. You see here a couple of
poor, low spirited, and timorous persons; that were afraid to be seen in
Christ's company when the other disciples professed their readiness to die with
him: yet those flee, and these appear for him, when the trial comes indeed. If
God desert the strong, and assist the weak; the feeble shall be as David, and
the strong as tow. I speak not this to discourage any man from striving to
improve inherent grace to the utmost. For it is ordinarily found in experience,
that the degrees of assisting grace, are given out according to the measures of
inherent grace: but I speak it to prevent a sin incident to strong Christians,
which is to despise the weak, which God corrects by such instances and examples
as this before us.

Corollary 3.
Hence we may be assisted in discerning the depths of Christ's humiliation for
us. Cor. 3.
And see from what, to what his love brought him. It was not enough that he who
was in the form of God, became a creature; which was an infinite stoop, nay to
be made a man, an inferior order of creatures. Nay to be a poor man, to spend
his days in poverty and contempt. But also to be a Dead corpse for our sake. O
what manner of love is this!

Now the deeper the humiliation of the Son of God was, the more satisfactory to
us it must needs be. For as it shows us the hainousness of sin that deserves
all this, so the fullness of Christ's satisfaction whereby he makes up that
breach. O it was a deep humiliation indeed. How unlike himself is he now
become! Does he look like the Son of God? What, the Son of God whom all the
Angels adore to be shuffled by three or four persons into his Grave in an
evening. To be carried from Golgotha to the Grave in this manner. And there lie
as a captive to Death for a time. Never was the like change of conditions,
never such an abasement heart of in the world.

Corollary 4.
From this Funeral of Christ results the purest and strongest consolation and
encouragement to believers, Cor. 4.
against the fears of Death and the Grave. If this be so, that Jesus has layen
in Grave before you; let me say then to you as the Lord spoke to Jacob, Genesis
46.2, 3. Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will go down with thee, and will
surely bring thee up thence. So here, fear not believer to go down to the
Grave, for God will be with thee there, and will surely bring thee up thence.
This consideration that Jesus Christ has layen in the Grave himself, gives
manifold encouragement to the people of God, against the terrors of the Grave.

First, The Grave received, but could not destroy Jesus Christ. Death swallowed
him, as the Whale did Jonah his Type; but could not digest him, when it had
swallowed him but quickly delivered him up again. Now Christ lying in the
Grave, as the common head and representative of believers, what comfort should
this inspire into their hearts. For as it fared with Christ's personal, so it
shall with Christ's mystical. It could not retain him, it shall not for ever
retain them. This Resurrection of Christ out of his, is the very ground of our
hope for a Resurrection out of our Graves. Christ is risen from the dead, and
become the first fruits of them that slept, 1 Cor. 15.20.

Secondly, As the union betwixt the body of Christ and the divine nature was
not dissolved; when that body was laid in the Grave; so the union betwixt
Christ and believers is not, cannot be dissolved when their bodies shall be
laid in their Graves. It Is true the natural union betwixt his soul and body was
dissolved for a time, but the Hypostatical union was not dissolved, no, not for
a moment. That body was the body of the Son of God when it was in the
Sepulcher. In like manner, the natural union betwixt our souls and bodies is
dissolved by death, but the mystical union betwixt us and Christ, yea betwixt
our very dust and Christ, can never be dissolved.

Thirdly, As Christ's body when it was in the Grave, did there rest in hope, and
was assuredly a partaker of that hope. So it shall fare with the dead bodies of
the Saints, when they lay them down also in the dust. My flesh also shall rest
in hope, says Christ, Psalm. 16.9, 10, 11. In like manner, the Saints commit
their bodies to the dust in hope. The righteous has hope in his death, Pro.
14.32. And as Christ's hope was not a vain hope, so neither shall their hope be
in vain.

Fourthly, And lastly, Christ's lying in the Grave before us, has quite changed
and altered the nature of the Grave. So that it is not what it was. It was once
a part of the Curse, Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shall return, was a part
of the threatening and curse for sin. The Grave had the nature and use of a
prison, to keep the bodies of sinners against the great Assizes; and then
deliver them up into the hands of a great and terrible God. But now it is no
prison, but a bed of rest. Yea, and a perfumed bed, where Christ lay before us.
Which is a sweet consideration of the Grave indeed. They shall enter into
peace, they shall rest in their beds, Isa. 57.2. O then let not believers stand
in fear of the Grave. He that has one foot in heaven, need not fear to put the
other into the Grave. Though I go down to the valley of the shadow of Death I
will fear no evil, for thou art with me, Psalm. 23.

Indeed, the Grave is a terrible place to them that are out of Christ. Death is
the Lords Sergeant to arrest them. The Grave is the Lords Prison to secure
them. When death draws them into the Grave, it draws them thither as a Lion
does his prey into the den to devour it. So you read Psalm. 49.14. Death shall
feed (or prey) upon them. Death there raigns over them in its full power, Romans
5.14. And though at last it shall render them again to God, yet it were better
for them to lie everlastingly where they were, than to rise to such an end. For
they are brought out of their Graves, as a condemned Prisoner out of the
Prison, to go to execution. But the case of the Saints is not so. The Grave
(thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ) is a privileged place to them while they
sleep there, and when they awake, it will be with singing. When they awake,
they shall be satisfied with his likeness.

Corollary 5.
Lastly, Cor. 5 --
Since Christ was laid in the Grave, and his people reap such privileges by
it, as ever you expect rest or comfort in your Graves, see that you get Union
with Christ now.

It was an ancient custom of the Jews to put rich treasures into the Graves,
with their friends, as well as to bestow much upon their Sepulchers. It Is said
Hircanus opened David's Sepulcher, and took cut of it three thousand Talents of
Gold and Silver. And to this sense many interpret that act of the Chaldeans,
Ier. 8.1. At that time says the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the
Kings of Judah, and the bones of his Princes, etc. And shall spread them before
the Sun and Moon, etc. This is rather conceived to be an act of Covetousness,
than Cruelty. They shall ransack their Graves for the treasure that is hid
there among their bones. It Is possible the case so stands with many of you,
that you have no great matter to bestow upon your funerals, nor are they like
to be splendid; no stately monuments, no hidden treasures, but if Christ be
yours, you carry that with you to your Graves, which is better than all the
Gold and Silver in the world. What would you be the better if your Coffin were
made of beaten Gold, or your Gravestone set thick with glittering Diamonds?
But if you die in the Lord, (i. e.) interested in, and united to the Lord; you
shall carry six grounds of Comfort with you to your Graves, the least of which
is not to be purchased with the wealth of both Indies.

First, The first ground of comfort which a believer carries with him to the
Grave is, that the Covenant of God holds firmly with his very dust, all the
days of its appointed time in the Grave. So much Christ tells us, Matthew.
22.31, 32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and of Jacob. God is
not the God of the Dead, but the God of the Living, q. d. Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, are naturally dead, but in as much as God long after their deaths,
proclaimed himself their God still; therefore they are all alive, foederally
alive to God. They live, that is, their Covenant relation lives still. Whether
we live, or whether we die (says the Apostle) we are the Lords, Romans 14.7, 8,
9. Now what an encouragement is here! I am as much the Lords in the state of
the dead, as I was in the state of the living. Death puts an end to all other
relations and bonds, but the bond of the Covenant rots not in the Grave. That
dust is still the Lords.

Secondly, As Gods Covenant with our very bodies is indissolvable, so Gods love
to our very dust is inseparable. I am the God of Abraham, God looks down from
heaven into the Graves of his Saints with delight, and looks on that pile of
dust with complacency, which those that once loved it, cannot behold without
loathing. The Apostle is express, Romans 8.33. That death separates not the
believer from the love of G^d. As at first it was not our natural comeliness or
beauty that drew or engaged his love to us, so neither will he cease to love
us, when that beauty is gone, and we become objects of loathing to all flesh.
When a Husband cannot endure to see a Wife, or a Wife her Husband; but says of
them that were once dear and pleasant, as Abraham of his beloved Rachel, bury
my dead out of my sight. Yet then the Lord delights in it as much as ever. The
Goldsmiths does not value the dust of his Gold, as Gold values the dust of his
Saints, for all these precious particles are united to Christ.

Thirdly, As Gods love will be with you in the Grave, so Gods providence shall
take order about your Graves. When it shall be dig'd for you. And be sure he
will not dig your Graves, till you are fit to be put into them. He will bring
you thither in the best time, Job 5.26. Thou shall come to thy Grave as a Shock
of Corn in its season. You shall be ripe and ready before God house you there.
It Is said of David, that after he had served his generation by the will of God,
he fell asleep, Acts 13.36. O what a holy and wise will is that will of God,
that so orders our death? And how equal is it that our will should be concluded
by it.

Fourthly, If you be in Christ, as Gods Covenant holds with you in the Grave,
his love is inseparable from your dust, his providence shall give order when it
shall be dug for you; so in the next place, his pardons have loosed all the
bonds of guilt from you, before you lie down in the Grave. So that you shall
not die in your sins. Ah friends, what a comfort is this? That you are the
Lords Freemen in the Grave? Sin is a bad bedfellow, and a worse Grave-fellow.
It Is a grievous threatening, Ioh. 8.24. You shall die in your sins. Better be
cast alive into a pit among Dragons and Serpents, than dead into your Graves
among your Sins. O what a terrible word is that, Job 20.11. His bones are full
of the sins of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. But from
the company of sin in the Grave, all the Saints are delivered. Gods full, free,
and final pardons have shut guilt out of your Graves.

Fifthly, When ever you come to your Graves, you shall find the enmity of the
Grave slain by Christ. It is no enemy; nay you will find it friendly, a
privileged place to you. It will be as sweet to you that are in Christ, as a
so^t bed in a still quiet Chamber, is to one that is weary and sleepy. Therefore
it is s^id, 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. Death is yours. Yours as a privilege. Your friend.
There you shall find sweet rest in Jesus. Be hurried, pained, troubled no more.

Sixthly, To conclude, if in Christ, know this for your Comfort, that your own
Lord Jesus Christ keeps the Keys of all the Chambers of Death, and as he
unlocks the door of Death, when he lets you in; so he will open it again for
you, when you awake to let you out; and from the time he opens to let you in
till the time he opens to let you out; he himself wakes and watches by you
while you sleep there. I (says he) have the Keys of Death. O it is comfortable
to hear the Keys gingle in his hand, Rev. 1.18. O then as you expect peace or
rest in the Chambers of Death, get Union with Christ. A Grave with Christ is a
comfortable place.

The THIRTY EIGHTH SERMON. Sermon. 38.
Wherein four weighty ends of Christ's humiliation are opened, and particularly
applied.

ISAIAH LIII.II. He shall see the Travel of his Soul and be satisfied


WE are now arrived at the last particular which we designed to speak to in
Christ's state of humiliation namely the Designs and blessed Ends for which he
was so deeply abased. It Is inconsistent with the prudence of a common Agent to
be at vast expenses of time, pains, and cost; and not to propound to himself a
design worthy of all those expenses. And it is much less imaginable that Christ
would so stupendiously abase himself, by stooping from the bosom of his Father
to the state of the dead, where our last Discourse lef^ him, if there had not
been some excellent and glorious thing in his eye, the attainment whereof might
give him a content and satisfaction equival^nt to all the sorrow^ and abasures
he endured or it.

And so much is plainly carried in this Scripture. He shall see the Travel of
his Soul and be satisfied. In which words thr^e things fall under our
consideration*

First, The travailing pangs of Christ. So the Agonies of his soul, (...). Haec
vo^ and pa^tum significat, and dolorem parturi^^tem. Strigel.
and Torments of his body are fitly called; not only because of the sharpness,
and acuteness of them, being in that respect like the birth pangs of a
travailing woman, for so this word signifies: But also because they forerun and
make way for the birth, which abundantly recompenses all those labors. I shall
not here insist upon the the pangs and Agonies endured by Christ in the garden,
or upon the Cross, which the Prophet styles the travail of his Soul; having in
the former Sermons opened it largely in its particulars; but pass to the

Second Thing considerable in these words, and that is the assured fruits, and
effects of this his travail. He shall see the travail of his Soul. By seeing
understand the fruition, obtainment, or enjoyment of the ends of his
sufferings. He shall not shed his blood upon an hazard. His design shall not
miscarry, but he shall certainly see the ends he aimed at accomplished.

Thirdly, This shall yield him great satisfaction, as a woman forgets her
sorrow, for joy that a man is born into the world, Joh. 16.21. He shall see it
and be Satisfied. As God, when he had finished the work of Creation, viewed
that his work with pleasure and satisfaction, so does our exalted Redeemer with
great contentment behold the happy issues of his hard sufferings. It affords
pleasure to a man to see great affairs by orderly conduct brought to happy
issues. Much more does it yield delight to Jesus Christ, to see the results of
that most profound wisdom and love wherein he carried on Redemption work. All
runs into this

DOCT. That all the blessed designs and ends for which the Lord Jesus Christ
humbled himself to the death of the Cross, Doct.
shall certainly be attained, to his full content and satisfaction.
My present business is not to prove that Christ shall certainly obtain what he
died for, nor to open the great satisfaction and pleasure which will rise to
him out of those issues of his death; but to point at the principal ends of his
death, making some brief improvements, as we pass along.

First, Then let us enquire into the designs and ends of Christ's humiliation,
at least, the main and principal ones: and we shall find that as the sprinkling
of the Typical blood in the Old Testament, was done for four weighty Ends or
Uses; answerably the precious and invaluable blood of the Testator and surety
of the New Testament, is shed for four weighty Ends also.

First, Per hunc ritum implicit profitebantur Haebraei, se liberandos ab
aeterna mort^p^r Missiae sanguinem. Vatab.
That blood was shed and applied to deliver from danger, Exodus 12.13. And the
blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are, and when I see
the blood I will pass over you. And the Plague shall not be upon you, to
destroy you when I smite the Land of Egypt.

Secondly, That blood was shed to make an atonement betwixt God and the
people, Levit. 4.20. And he shall do with the Bullock, as he did with the
Bullock for a sin offering; so shall he do with this; and the Priest shall make
an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

Thirdly, That blood was shed to purify persons from their ceremonial
pollutions, Septies, significabat perfectam expiationem. Numerus hic
perfectioni sacer. Menoch.
Levit. 14.6, 7. He shall dip the Cedar wood, and Scarlet, and Hysop with the
living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water,
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the Leprosy seven
times; and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose in
the open field.

Fourthly, That blood was shed to ratify and confirm the Testament or Covenant
of God with the people, Effusio and aspersio sanguinis significat foedus
stabile fore, and firmum etiam cum vitae discrimins. Rivet.
Exodus 24.8. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
said, behold the blood of the Covenant, which the Lord has made with you
concerning all these words. These were the four main Ends of shedding and
sprinkling that Typical blood. Sutably, there are four principal Ends of
shedding and applying Christ's blood. As that Typical blood was shed to deliver
from danger, so this was shed to deliver from wrath, even the wrath to come.
That was shed to make an atonement, so was this. That was shed to purify
persons from uncleanness, so was this. That was shed to confirm the Testament,
so was this. As will appear in the particulars more at large.

End 1.
First, End 1.
One principal design and End of shedding the blood of Christ was to deliver
his people from danger, the danger of that wrath which burns down to the lowest
Hell. So you find, 1 These. 1.10. Even Jesus who delivered us from the wrath to
come. Here our misery is both specified, and aggravated. Specified, in calling
it wrath, a word of deep and dreadful signification. The damned best und^rstand
the importance of that word. And aggravated in calling it wrath to come, or
coming wrath. Wrath to come implies both the futurity* and perpetuity of this
wrath. It Is wrath that shall certainly and inevitably come upon sinners. As
sure as the night follows the day. As sure as the Winter follows the Summer; so
shall wrath follow sin, and the pleasures thereof. Yea, it is not only certainly
future, but when it comes it will be abiding wrath or wrath still coming. When
millions of years and Ages are past and gone, this will still be wrath to come.
Ever coming, as a r^ver ever flowing.

Now from this wrath to come, has les^s delivered his people by his death. For
that was the price laid down ^or their redemption from the wrath of the great
and terrible God Romans 5.9. Much more then being ^ustified by his blood, we
shall be saved from wrath through him. The blood of Jesus was the price that
ransomed man from his wrath. And it was shed not only to deliver them from
wrath to come, but to deliver them freely, fully distinguishingly, and
wonderfully from it.

First, Freely, by his own voluntary interposition and susception of the
mediatorial office, moved thereunto by his own bowels of compaossion; which
yearned over his Elect in their misery. The Saints were once a lost generation,
tha^ had sold themselves, and their inheritance also; Vide Mr. Ca^^ his Mount
P^sgah. p. 85.
and had not wherewithal to Redeem either: but they had a near kinsman (even
their elder Brother by the Mothers side) to whom the right of Redemption did
belong; who being a mighty man of wealth* the heir of all things, undertook to
be their Goell; and out of his own proper substance to Redeem both them and
their inheritance. Them to be his own inheritance, Ephesians. 1.10. And heaven to be
theirs 1 Pet. 1.4. All this he did most freely, when none mad^ supplication to
him. No sighing of the prisoners came before him. He designed it for us before
we had a being. And when the purposes of his grace were come to their
parturient fullness, then did he freely lay out the infinite treasures of his
blood to purchase our deliverance from wrath.

Secondly, Christ by death has delivered his people fully. A full deliverance
it is, both in respect of Time and Degrees. A full deliverance in respect of
Time. It was not a Reprieve, but a deliverance. He thought it not worth the
shedding of his blood to respite the execution for a while. Nay, in the
procurement of their eternal deliverance from wrath, and in the purchase of
their eternal inheritance, he has but an even bargain, not a jot more than his
blood was worth. Therefore is he become the Author of [Eternal Salvation] to
them that obey him, Heb. 5.9. And as it is full in respect of Time, so likewise
in respect of Degrees. He died not to procure a mitigation or abatement of the
rigor or severity of the sentence, but to rescue his people fully from all
degrees of wrath. So that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ,
Romans 8.1. All the wrath of God to the last drop, was squeezed out into that
bitter cup which Christ drank off, and wrung out the very dregs thereof.

Thirdly, This deliverance obtained for us by the death of Christ, is a special
and distinguishing deliverance. Not common to all, but peculiar to some; and
they by nature no better than those that are left under wrath. Yea, as to
natural disposition, moral qualifications and external endowments often times
far inferior to them that perish. How often do we find a moral righteousness,
an harmless innocence, a pretty ingenuity a readiness to all offices of love;
in them that are notwithstanding less under the dominion of other Lusts, and
under the damning sentence of the Law; whilst on the other side, proud,
peevish, sensual, morose, and unpollisht natures, are chosen to be the subjects
of this Salvation. You see your calling, brethren, 1 Cor. 1.26.

Fourthly, And lastly, it is a wonderful salvation. It would weary the arm of
an Angel to write down all the wonders that are in this salvation. That ever
such a Design should be laid, such a project of grace contrived in the heart of
God; who might have suffered the whole species to perish; That it should only
concern man, and not the Angels, by nature more excellent than us; that Christ
should be pitched upon to go forth upon this glorious Design. That he should
effect it in such a way, by taking our nature and suffering the penalty of the
Law therein. That our deliverance should be wrought out and finished when the
Redeemer and his design seemed both to be lost and perished. These with many
more are such wonders as will take up eternity it self to search, admire, and
adore them.

Before I part from this first End of the Death of Christ, give me leave to
deduce two useful Corollaries from it, and then proceed to a second.

Corollary 1.
Cor. 1.
Has Christ by Death delivered his people from the wrath to come? How ingrate
and disingenious a thing must it be then for those that have obtained such a
deliverance as this, to repine and gru^ge at those light afflictions they
suffer for a moment upon Christ's account in this world!

Alas! What are these sufferings, that we should grudge at them? Are they like
those which the Redeemer suffered for our deliverance? Did ever any of us
endure for him, what he endured for us? Or is there any thing you can suffer
for Christ in this world, comparable to this wrath to come, which you must have
endured, had he not by the price of his own blood rescued you from it?

Compare.
Reader, will thou but make the comparison in thine own thoughts in the
following particulars, and then pronounce, when thou have duly compared.

The Natures.
First, What is the wrath of man, to the wrath of God? What is the Arm of a
creature, to the Anger of a Deity? Can man thunder with an arm like God?

Subjects.
Secondly, What are the sufferings of the vile body here, to the tortures of a
S^ul and Body in Hell? The torments of the Soul, are the very soul of t^rmen^s.

Duration.
Thirdly, What are the troubles of a moment, to that wrath which after Millions
of years are gone, will still be called wrath to come? O what compare betwixt a
point of hasty Time, and the interminable Duration of vast Eternity?

Continuity.
Fourthly, What compare is there betwixt the intermitting sorrows and
sufferings of this life, and the continued uninterrupted wrath to come? Our
troubles here are not constant, there are gracious relaxations, lucid intervals
here; but the wrath to come allows not a moments ease, or mitigation.

Designs.
Fifthly, What light and easy troubles are those which being put into the rank
and order of adjuvant causes, work under the influence and blessing of the
first cause to the everlasting good of them that love God, compared with that
wrath to come, out of which no good effects or issues are possible to proceed
to the souls on which it lies?

Sixthly, And Companions.
And lastly how much more comfortable is it, to suffer in fellowship with
Christ and his Saints for righteousness sake; than to suffer with Devils and
reprobates for wickedness sake? Grudge not then O ye that are delivered by
Jesus from wrath to come, at any thing ye do suffer, or shall suffer from
Christ, or for Christ in this world.

Corollary 2.
If Jesus Christ has delivered his people from the wrath to come, Cor. 2.
how little comfort can any man take in his present enjoyments and
accommodations in the world, whilst it remains a question with him whether he
be delivered from the wrath to come! It Is well for present, but will it be so
still? Man is a prospecting creature, and it will not satisfy him that his
present condition is comfortable, except he have some hope it shall be so
hereafter. It can afford a man little content that all is easy and pleasant
about him now; whilst such passages and terrible hints of wrath to come are
given him by his own conscience daily. Oh methinks such a thought as this, what
if I am reserved for the wrath to come? Should be to him as the fingers
appearing upon the plaster of the wall were to Belteshazzar in the height of a
frollick. It Is a custom with some of the Indians when they have taken a
prisoner (whom they intend not presently to eat) to bring him with great
Triumph, Sir Rich. Barkley in the felicity of man, p. 12, 13,
into the village where he dwells that has taken him; and placing him in the
house of one that was slain in the Wars, as it were to re-celebrate his
funerals, they give him his Wives or Sisters to attend on him, and use at his
pleasure. They apparel him gorgeously, and feed him with all the dainty meats
that may be had; affording him all the pleasure that can be devised: when he
has past certain months in all these pleasures, and like a Capon is made fat
with delicate fare, they assemble themselves upon some festival day, and in
great pomp bring him to the place of execution where they kill, and eat him.

Such are all the pleasures and enjoyments of the wicked, which feed them for
the day of slaughter. How little stomach can a man have to those dainties that
understands the end and meaning of them. Give not sleep therefore to thine
eyes, Reader, till thou have got good evidence that thou art of that number
whom Jesus has delivered from wrath to come. Till thou can say he is a Jesus
to thee. This may be made out to thy satisfaction three ways.

First, If Jesus have delivered thee from sin the cause of wrath, thou may
conclude he has delivered thee from wrath, the effect and fruit of sin. Upon
this account the sweet name of Jesus was imposed upon him, Matthew. 1.21. Thou
shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Whilst
a man lies under the dominion and guilt of sin, he lies exposed to wrath to
come; and when he is delivered from the guilt and power of sin, he is certainly
delivered from the danger of this coming wrath. Where sin is not imputed, wrath
is not threatened.

Secondly, If thy soul do set an inestimable value on Jesus Christ, and be
endeared to him upon the account of that inexpressible grace manifested in this
deliverance, it is a good sign thy soul has a share in it. Mark what an
Epithet the Saints give Christ upon this account, Col. 1.12, 13. Giving thanks
to the Father who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and translated
us into the Kingdom of his [Dear] Son. Christ is therefore Dear and dear beyond
all compare to his saved ones. I remember it is storied of the poor enthralled
Grecians, that when Titus Flamminius had restored their ancient liberties; and
proclamation was to be made in the Market place by an Herald. Plutarch in vita
T. Flaminii.
They so pressed to hear it that the Herald was in great danger of being stifled
and pressed to death among the people; but when the Proclamation was ended, there
were heard such shouts, and joyful acclamations; that the very birds of the air
fell down astonished with the noise while they continued to cry (...), a
Savior, a Savior: and all the following night they continued dancing and
singing about his Pavilion.

If such a deliverance so indeared them to Titus. How should the great
deliverance from wrath to come endear all the Redeemed to love their dear
Jesus. This is the native effect of mercy on the soul that has felt it.

Thirdly, To conclude, a disposition and readiness of mind to do, or endure any
thing for Christ's sake upon the account of this deliverance from the wrath to
come; is a good evidence you are so delivered, Col. 1.10, 11. That we may walk
worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work. There Is
readiness to do for Christ. Strengthened with all might according to his
glorious power, unto all patience and long suffering with Ioyfulness; There Is a
cheerful readiness to endure any thing for Christ. And how both these flow from
the sense of this great deliverance from wrath, the 12. verse. will inform you,
which was but now cited. Oh then be serious and assiduous in the resolution of
this grand case. Till this be resolved, nothing can be pleasant to thy Soul.

End 2.
As the Typical blood was shed and sprinkled to deliver from danger, End 2.
so it was shed to make atonement, Levit. 4.20. He shall expiate (We translate
atone) the sin. (...)
The word imports both. And the true meaning is, that by the blood of the
Bullock, all whose efficacy stood in its relation to the blood of Christ
signified and shadowed by it; the people for whom it was shed, should be
reconciled to God by the expiation and remission of their sins. And what was
shadowed in this Typical blood was really designed and accomplished by Jesus
Christ in the shedding of his blood.

Reconciliation of the Elect to God, is therefore another of those beautiful
births which Christ travailed for. So you find it expressly, Romans 5.10. If when
we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son. This [if,]
is not a word of doubting but argumentation. The Apostle supposes it as a known
truth, or principle yielded by all Christians; that the death of Christ was to
reconcile the Elect to God. And again he affirms it with like clearness, Col.
1.20. And having made peace by the blood of his Cross, by him to reconcile all
things. And that this was a main and principal end designed both by the Father
and Son in the humiliation of Christ is plain from 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. God was in
Christ reconciling the world to himself. God filled the humanity with grace and
authority. The Spirit of God was in him to qualify him. The authority of God
was in him by Commission, Reconciliare nihil aliud est quam amicitiam
offensione aliqua gravi diremptam resar cire; and sic inimicos in pristinam
concordiam reducer^. B. Daven. in Col. 1.20.
to make all he did valid. The grace and love of God to mankind was in him, and
one of the principal effects in which it was manifested, was this design upon
which he came, viz. to reconcile the world to God. Upon which ground Christ is
called the propitiation for our sins, 1 John 2.2. Now, Reconciliation or
atonement is nothing else but the making up of the ancient friendship betwixt
God and men which sin had dissolved, and so to reduce these enemies into a
state of concord and sweet agreement. And the means by which this blessed
design was effectually compassed, was by the death of Christ which made
complete satisfact^on to God for the wrong we had done him. There was a breach
made by sin betwixt God and Angels, but that breach is never to be repaired or
made up. Since as Christ took not on him their nature, so he never intended to
be a mediator of reconciliation betwixt God and them. That will be an Eternal
breach. But that which Christ designed as the end of his death was to reconcile
God and man. Not the whole species, but a certain number whose names were given
to Christ. Here I must briefly open. First, how Christ's death Reconciles.
Secondly, why this Reconciliation is brought about by his death, rather than
any other way. Thirdly, what are the Articles according to which it is made. And
Fourthly, what manner of Reconciliation this is.

First, How Christ Reconciles God and men by his death. And it must needs be by
the satisfaction his Death made to the Justice of God for our sins. And so,
reparation being made, the enmity ceases. Hence it is said, Isa. 53.5. The
chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes are we healed. That
is (as our English Annotators well sense it) He was chastized to procure our
peace by removal of our sins that set God and us assunder, the guilt thereof
being discharged with the price of his blood.

Now this Reconciliation is made and continued betwixt God and us three ways,
namely, by the oblation of Christ which was the price that procured it, and so
we were virtually or meritoriously reconciled. By the application of Christ and
his benefits to us through faith, and so we are actually reconciled. And by the
virtual continuation of the sacrifice of Christ in heaven, by his potent and
eternal intercession, and so our state of reconciliation is confirmed, and all
future breaches prevented. But all depends as you see, upon the death of
Christ. For had not Christ died, his death could never be applied to us, nor
pleaded in heaven for us. How the death of Christ meritoriously procures our
reconciliation is evident from that forecited Scripture, Romans 5.10. When we
were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, (i. e.) Christ's
death did meritoriously or virtually reconcile us to God, who as to our state
were enemies, long after that reconciliation was made. That the application of
Christ to us by faith, makes that virtual reconciliation to become actual is
plain enough from Ephesians. 2.16.17. And that he might reconcile both unto God in
one body by the Cross, having slain the enmity thereby. And came and Preached
peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh. Now therefore ( as
it is added verse. 19.) Ye are no more strangers and foraigners, but fellow
Citizens with the Saints, etc. And that this state of friendship is still
continued by Christ's intercession within the vail, so that there can be no
breaches made upon the state of our peace notwithstanding all the daily
provocations we give God by our sins; is the comfortable truth which the
Apostle plainly asserts, after he had given a necessary caution to prevent the
abuse of it, in 1 Ioh. 2.1, 2. My little children, these things write I unto
you that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father;
Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation, etc. Thus Christ
reconciles us to God, by his death.

Secondly, And if you enquire why this reconciliation was made

First, That we can imagine no other way by which it could be compassed. And

Secondly, If God could have Reconciled us as much by another way, yet he could
not have Obliged us so much by doing it in another way, as he has by doing it
this way. Surely none but he that was God manifest in our flesh, could offer a
sacrifice of sufficient value to make God amends for the wrong done him by one
sin, much less for all the sins of the Elect. And how God should (especially
after a peremptory threatening of death for sin) readmit us into favor without
full satisfaction, cannot be imagined. He is indeed inclined to acts of mercy,
but none must suppose him to exercise one attribute, in prejudice to another.
That his Justice must be Eclipsed, whilst his mercy shines. But allow the
infinite wisdom could have found out another means of reconciling us as much,
can you imagine that in any other way he could oblige us as much, as he has
done by reconciling us to himself by the death of his own Son? It cannot be
thought possible. This therefore was the most effectual just, honorable and
obliging way to make up the peace betwixt him and us.

Thirdly, This reconciliation purchased by the blood of Christ, is offered unto
men by the Gospel upon certain Articles and conditions; upon the performance
whereof it actually becomes theirs; and without which, notwithstanding all that
Christ has done and suffered, the breach still continues betwixt them and God.
And let no man think this a derogation from the freeness and riches of Grace,
for these things serve singularly to illustrate and commend the grace of God to
sinners.

As he consulted his own glory, in the terms on which he offers us our peace
with him; so it is his grace which brings up souls to those terms of
reconciliation. And surely he has not suspended the mercy of our
reconciliation upon unreasonable or impossible conditions. He has not said, if
you will do as much for me, as you have done against me I will be at peace with
you: But the two grand Articles of peace with God are Repentance and faith. In
the first we lay down arms against God, and it is meet it should be so, before
he readmit us into a state of peace, and favor: in the other we accept Christ
and pardon through him with a thankful heart, yielding up our selves to his
government. Which is equally reasonable.

These are the terms on which we are actually reconciled to God. Let the wicked
forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn to the
Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon. So Romans 5.1. Being justified by faith, we have peace with God. And
surely it would not become the holy God to own as his friend and favorite a man
that goes on perversely and impenitently in the way of sin; not so much as
acknowledging or once bewailing the wrong he has done him, purposeing to do so
no more; or to receive into amity one that slights and rejects the Lord Jesus,
whose precious blood was shed to procure and purchase peace and pardon for
sinners.

But if there be any poor soul that says in his heart, it repents me for
sinning against God, and is sincerely willing to come to Christ upon Gospel
terms, he shall have peace. And that peace,

Fourthly, Is no common peace. The reconciliation which the Lord Jesus died to
procure for broken hearted believers it is, First, A firm well bottomed
reconciliation, putting the reconciled soul beyond all possibility of coming
under Gods wrath any more. Isai. 54.10. Mountains may depart and hills be
removed, but the Covenant of this peace cannot be removed. Christ is a surety
by way of caution, to prevent new breaches, 2 John 1.2. Secondly, This
reconciliation with God is the fountain out of which all our other comforts
flow to us; this is plainly carried in those words of Eliphaz to Job. Chap.
22.21. Acquaint now thy self with him, and be at peace, thereby good shall come
unto thee. As trade flowrishes, and riches come in when peace is made betwixt
States and Kingdoms: so all spiritual and temporal mercies flow into our
bosoms, when once we are reconciled to God. What the comfort of such a peace
will be in a day of straights and dangers, and what it will be valued at in a
dying day, who but he that feels it can declare? And yet such a one cannot
fully declare it, for it passes all understanding, Phil. 4.7. We shall now make
some improvement of this, and pass on to the third end of the death of Christ.


Inference 1.
If Christ died to reconcile God and man. Infer. 1.
How horrid an evil then is sin! And how terrible was that breach made betwixt
God and the creature by it, which could no other way be made up but by the
death of the Son of God! I remember I have read that when a great chasm or
breach was made in the earth by an earthquake, and the Oracle was consulted how
it might be closed; this answer was returned, that breach can never be closed,
except something of great worth be thrown into it. Such a breach was that which
sin made, it could never be reconciled but by the death of Jesus Christ, the
most excellent thing in all the Creation.

Inference 2.
How sad is the state of all such as are not comprised in the Articles of peace
with God! Infer. 2.
The impenitent unbeliever is excepted. God is not reconciled to him: and if
God be his enemy, how little avails it, who is his friend. For if God be a man's
enemy, he has an Almighty enemy in him, whose very frown is destruction. Deuteronomy.
32.40, 41, 42. I lift up my hand to Heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet
my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render
vengeance to my enemies, and I will reward them that hate me. I will make mine
arrows drunk with blood, (and my sword shall devour flesh) and that with the
blood of the slain and the Captives, from the beginning of revenge upon the
enemy.

Yea, he is an unavoidable enemy. Fly to the utmost parts of the earth there
shall his hand reach thee as it is, Psalm. 139.10. The wings of the morning
cannot carry thee out of his reach. If God be your enemy you have an immortal
enemy, who lives for ever to avenge himself upon his adversaries. And what will thou do when thou art in Saul's case, 1 Samuel 28.15, 16. Alas, whither will thou
turn? To whom will thou complain. But what will thou do when thou shall stand
at the Bar and see that God who is thine enemy upon the throne? Sad is their
case indeed, who are not comprehended in the Articles of peace with God.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
If Christ died to reconcile us to God, give diligence to clear up to your own
souls your interest in this reconciliation. If Christ thought it worth his
blood to purchase it, it is worth your care and pains to clear it. And what can
better evidence it than your conscientious tenderness of sin, lest you make new
breaches. Ah, if reconciled you will say as Ezra. 9.14. And now our God, seeing
thou have given us such a deliverance as this; should we again break thy
Commandments? If reconciled to God, his friends will be your friends, and his
enemies your enemies. If God be your friend you will be diligent to please him,
John 15.10, 14. He that makes not peace with God is an enemy to his own soul.
And he that is at peace but takes no pains to clear it, is an enemy to his own
comfort. But I must pass from this to the third End of Christ's death.

End 3.
End 3.
You have seen two of those beautiful births of Christ's travail, and lo a third
comes, namely the sanctification of his people. Typical blood was shed as you
heard to purify them that were unclean, and so was the blood of Christ shed to
purge away the sins of his people; so speaks the Apostle expressly, Ephesians. 5.25,
26. Christ gave himself for the Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it.
And so he tells us himself, Joh. 17.19. And for their sakes I sanctify my self
(i. e.) consecrate or devote my self to death, that they also might be
sanctified through the truth. Upon the account of this benefit received by the
blood of Christ, is that Doxology which in a lower strain is now sounded in the
Churches, but will be matter of the Lambs song in Heaven, Rev. 1.5, 6. To him
that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood -- be glory and
honor for ever.

Now there is a twofold evil in sin, the guilt of it and the polution of it.
Justification properly cures the former, Sanctification the latter; but both
Justification and Sanctification flow unto sinners out of the death of Christ.
And though it is proper to say the spirit sanctifies, yet it is certain it was
the blood of Christ that procured for us the spirit of sanctification. Had not
Christ died, the spirit had never come down from Heaven upon any such design.

The pouring forth of Christ's blood for us obtained the pouring forth of the
spirit of holiness upon us. Therefore the spirit is said to come in his name,
and to take of his and show it unto us. Hence it is said, 1 John 5.6. he came
both by blood and by water; by blood washing away the guilt, by water purifying
from the filth of sin. Now this fruit of Christ's death, even our
sanctification, is a most incomparable mercy. For do but consider a few
particular excellencies of holiness.

First, Holiness is the Image and glory of God. His image Coll. 3.10. and his
glory, Exodus 15.11. who is like unto thee, O Lord, glorious in holiness. Now
when the guilt and filth of sin is washed off, and the beauty of God put upon
the soul in sanctification, O what a beautiful Creature is the soul now. So
lovely in the eyes of Christ even in its imperfect holiness, that he says,
Cant. 6.5. Turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me. (...)
So we render it, but the Hebrew word signifies, they have made me proud, or
puffed me up. It Is a beam of divine glory upon the Creature, enamouring the
very heart of Christ.

Secondly, As it is the souls highest beauty, so it is the souls best evidence
for heaven. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, Matthew. 5.8.
And without holiness no man shall see God, Heb. 12.14. No gifts, no duties, no
natural endowments will evidence a righ^ in heaven, but the least measure of
true holiness will secure heaven to the soul.

Thirdly, As holiness is the souls best evidence for heaven, so it is a
continual spring of comfort to it in the way thither. The purest and sweetest
pleasures in this world are the results of holiness. Till we come to live
holily, we never live comfortably. Heaven is Epitomized in holiness.

Fourthly, And to say no more, It is the peculiar mark by which God has
visibly distinguished his own, from other men, Psalm. 4.3. The Lord has set
apart him that is Godly for himself, Q. D. this is the Man, and that the Woman
to whom I intend to be good for ever. This is a man for me. O holiness, how
surpassin^ly glorious art thou!

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Did Christ die to sanctify his people, how deep then is the polution of sin,
that nothing but the blood of Christ can cleanse it! All the tears of a
penitent sinner, should he shed as many as there have fallen drops of rain
since the Creation to this day, cannot wash away one sin. The everlasting
burnings in Hell, cannot purify the flaming conscience from the least sin. O
guess at the wound by the largeness and length of this Tent that follows the
mortal weapon sin.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Did Christ die to sanctify his people. Behold then the love of a Savior. He
loved us, and washed us from our sin in his own blood. He did not shed the
blood of beasts as the Priests of old did, but his own blood, Heb. 9.12. And
that no common, but precious blood, 1 Pet. 1.19. The blood of God, one drop of
which out values the blood that runs in the veins of all Adams posterity. And
not some of that blood, but all; to the last drop. He bled every vein dry for
us, and what remained lodged about the heart of dead Jesus, was let out by that
bloody Spear which pierced the Pericardium: so that he bestowed the whole
treasure of his blood upon us. And thus liberal was he of his blood to us when
we were enemies. This then is that heavenly Pelican that feeds his young with
his own blood. O what manner of love is this! But I must hasten.

End 4.
End 4.
As Christ dyed to sanctify his people. So he dyed also to confirm the New
Testament to all those sanctified ones. So it was in the Type, Exodus 24.8. And
so it is in the truth. This is the New Testament in my blood, Matthew. 26.28. (i.
e.) ratified and confirmed by my blood. For where a Testament is, there must
also of necessity be the death of the Testator, Heb. 9.16. So that now all the
blessings and benefits bequeathed to believers in the last Will and Testament
of Christ, are abundantly confirmed and secured to them by his death. Yea he
died on purpose to make that Testament in force to them. Men make their Wills
and Testaments, and Christ makes his. Nullo praesentis metu pericu^i. Co^kes
Instit. lib 3. cap. 10.
What they bequeath and give in their Wills is a free and voluntary act, they
cannot be compelled to do it. And what is bequeathed to us in this Testament of
Christ is altogether a free and voluntary donation. Other Testators use to
bequeath their Estates to their Wives, and Children, and near relations; so
does this Testator, all is settled upon his Spouse the Church. Upon believers,
his children. A stanger intermedles not with these mercies. They give all their
goods and estates that can that way be conveyed to their friends that survive
them, Christ gives to his Church in this New Testament three sorts of Goods.

First, All Temporal good things, 1 Timothy 6.1. Matthew. 6.33. (i. e.) the comfort
and blessing of all, though not the possession of much. As having nothing and
yet possessing all things, 2 Cor. 6.10. Secondly, All Spiritual good things are
bequeathed to them in this Testament, as Remission of sin, and acceptance with
God which are contained in their Justification, Romans 3.24, 25, 26.
Sanctification of their natures both initial and progressive, 1 Cor. 1.30.
Adoption into the family of God, Gal. 3.26. The Ministry of Angels, Heb. 1.14.
Interest in all the Promises, 2 Pet. 1.4. Thus all spiritual good things are in
Christ's Testament conveyed to them. And as all Temporal, and Spiritual, so
Thirdly, All Eternal good things. Heaven, Glory, and eternal life, Romans
8.10.11. No such bequests as these were ever found in the Testaments of
Princes. That which Kings and Nobles settle by will upon their Heirs, are but
trifles to what Christ has conferred in the New Testament upon his people. And
all this is confirmed and ratified by the death of Christ, so that the promise
is sure, and the Estate indefeasible to all the Heirs of Promise.
How the death of Christ confirmed the New Testament is worth our Enquiry. The
Socinians, as they allow no other end of Christ's death but the confirmation of
the New Testament, so they affirm he did it only by way of Testimony, or
witness bearing in his death. But this is a vile derogation from the efficacy
of Christ's blood, to bring it down into an equality with the blood of Martyrs.
As if there were no more in it, than was in their blood.

But know, Reader, Christ died not only or principally to confirm the Testment
by his blood as a witness to the truth of those things, but hi^ death ratified
it as the death of a Testator, which makes the New Testament irrevocable. And
so Christ is called in this Text. Look as when a man has made his Will and is
dead, that Will is presently in force, and can never be recalled. Besides the
will of the dead is sacred with men. They dare not cross it. It Is certain the
last will and Testament of Christ is most sacred, and God will never annul or
make it void. Moreover, it is not with Christ as with other Testators who die
and must trust the performance of their wills with their Executors, but as he
died to put it in force, so he lives again to be the Executor of his own
Testament. And all power to fulfill his Will is now in his own hands, Rev. 1.18.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Did Christ die to confirm the New Testament in which such Legacies are
bequeathed to believers. How are all believers concerned then to prove the Will
of dead Jesus. The P^obat of Christ's last Will and Testament.
My meaning is to clear their Title to the mercies contained in this blessed
Testament. And this may be done two ways. By clearing to your selves your
Covenant Relations to Christ. And by discovering those special Covenant
impressions upon your hearts to which the Promises therein contained do belong.

First, Examine your Relations to Christ. Are you his Spouses, have you
forsaken all for him, Psalm. 45.10. Are you ready to take your lot with him as
it falls in prosperity or adversity, Ier. 2.2. And are you Loyal to Christ,
Thou shall be for me, and not for another, Hos. 3.3. Do you yield obedience to
him as your Head and Husband, Ephesians. 6.24. Then you may be confident you are
interested in the benefits and blessings of Christ's last Will and Testament,
for can you imagine, Christ will make a Testament and forget his Spouse? It
cannot be. If he so loved the Church as to give himself for her, much more what
he has is settled on her. Again, are you his spiritual seed, his children by
regeneration? Are you born of the Spirit? Ioh. 3. Do you resemble Christ in
holiness? 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. Do you find a reverential fear of Christ carrying
you to obey him in all things? Mal. 1.6. Are you led by the Spirit of Christ,
as many as are so led, they are the Sons of God, Romans 8.14. To conclude, have
you the Spirit of Adoption, inabling you to cry Abba Father? Gal. 4.6. That is,
helping you in a gracious manner, with reverence mixed with filial confidence to
open your hearts spiritually to your Father on all occasions? If so, you are
children, and if children doubt not but you have a rich Legacy in Christ's last
Will and Testament. He would not seal up his Testament, and forget his dear
children.

Secondly, You may discern your interest in the New Testament or Covenant, (for
they are substantially the same thing) by the new Covenant impressions that are
made on your hearts, which are so many clear evidences of your right to the
benefits it contains. Such are Spiritual illumination, Ier. 31.34. Gracious
softness, and tenderness of heart, Ezekiel. 11.19. The awful dread and fear of
God, Ier. 32.40. The Copy or transcript of his Laws on your hearts, in gracious
correspondent principles, Ier. 31.33. These things speak you the Children of
the Covenant, the persons on whom all these great things are settled.

Inference 2.
To conclude, Infer. 2.
it is the indispensible duty of all on whom Christ has settled such mercies,
to admire his Love, and walk answerably to it.

First, Admire the Love of Christ. O how intense and ardent was the Love of
Jesus! who designed for you such an inheritance, with such a settlement of it
upon you! These are the mercies with which his Love had travailed big from
eternity, and now he sees the travail of his soul, and you also have seen
somewhat of it this day. Before this Love let all the Saints fall down
astonished-humbly professing, that they owe themselves and all they are or
shall be worth to eternity, to this Love.

Secondly, And be sure you walk becoming persons for whom Christ has done such
great things. Comfort your selves under present abasures with your spiritual
privileges, Iam. 2.5. And let all your rejoicing be in Christ, and what you
have in him, whilst others are blessing themselves in vanity. Thus we have
finished the state of Christ's humiliation and thence proceed to the second
state of his Exaltation.

An Introduction to the State of Exaltation.
HAving finished what I designed to speak to about the work of Redemption, so
far as it was carried on by Christ in his humbled state we shall now view that
blessed work as it is further advanced and perfected in his State of Exaltation.

The whole of that work was not to be finished on earth in a state of suffering
and abasure, therefore the Apostle makes his Exaltation in order to the
finishing of the remainder of his work, so necessary a part of his Priesthood,
that without it he could not have been a Priest, Heb. 8.4. If he were on earth
he should not be a Priest, (i. e.) if he should have continued always here,
and had not been raised again from the dead and taken up into glory, he could
not have been a complete and perfect Priest.

For look as it was not enough for the sacrifice to be slain without, and his
blood left there; but after it was shed without, it must be carried within the
vail into the most holy place before the Lord, Heb. 9.7. So it was not
sufficient that Christ shed his own blood on earth, except he carry it before
the Lord into heaven, and there perform his intercession work for us.

Moreover, God the Father stood engaged in a solemn Covenant to reward him for
his deep humiliation, with a most glorious and illustrious advancement, Isa.
49.5, 6, 7. And how God (as it became him) made this good to Christ, the
Apostle very clearly expresses it, Phil. 2.9.

Yea, Justice required it should be so. For how could our surety be detained in
the prison of the Grave, when the debt for which he was imprisoned was by him
fully discharged, so that the Law of God must acknowledge it self to be fully
satisfied in all its claims and demands. His Resurrection from the dead was
therefore but his discharge or acquittance upon full payment. Which could not
in Justice be denied him.

And indeed God the Father lost nothing by it, for there never was a more
glorious manifestation made of the name of God to the World than was made in
that work. Therefore it is said, Phil. 2.11. Speaking of one of the designs of
Christ's Exaltation, it was (says the Apostle) That every Tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father. O how is the Love of
God to poor sinners illustriously, yea astonishingly displayed in Christ's
Exaltation. When to show the Complacency and delight which he took in our
recovery, he has openly declared to the world that his exalting Christ to all
that glory, such as no mere creature ever was or can be exalted to, was
bestowed upon him as a reward for that work, that most grateful work of our
Redemption, Phil. 2.9. Wherefore God also has highly exalted him, there is an
Emphatical Pleonasmus in that word, our English is too flat to deliver out the
elegancy of the Original it is Super-Exaltation. (...) Pleonasmus E^phaticus.
Hierom. Multiplicavit subliratem ejus.

Arab. Sublimitate Sublimavit eum. Sir. Insignitor extalit, Justin. Sec^nd^m,
eandem naturam dicitur exaltatus, secundum quam humiliatus fuit. Zanch.


The Seriack renders it, he has multiplied his Sublimity. The Arabic, he has
heightened him with an height. Justin, he has famously exalted him. Higher he
cannot raise him, a greater Argument of his high satisfaction and content in
the recovery of poor sinners cannot be given. For this therefore God the Father
shall have glory and honor ascribed to him in Heaven to all Eternity.

Now this singular Exaltation of Jesus Christ as it properly respects his
humane nature which alone is capable of advancement, for in respect of his
divine nature he never ceased to be the most high. So it was done to him as a
common person, and as the head of all believers, their representative in this
as well as in his other works. God therein showing what in due time he intends
to do with the persons of his Elect, after they in Conformity to Christ have
suffered a while. What ever God the Father intends to do in us or for us, he
has first done it to the person of our representative, Jesus Christ. And this
if you observe, the Scriptures carry in very clear and plain expressions
through all the degrees and steps of Christ's Exaltation, viz. his Resurrection,
Ascension, Session at the right hand of God. And returning to Judge the World.
Of which I purpose to speak distinctly in the following Sermons.

He rose from the Dead as a common person, Col. 3.1. If ye then be risen with
Christ, says the Apostle, so that the Saints have Communion and fellowship
with him in his Resurrection.

He Ascended into Heaven as a common person, for so it is said in Ephesians. 2.6. He
has raised us up, or exalted us together with Christ. He sits at Gods right
hand as a common person, for so it follows in the next clause, and has made us
sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We sit there in our
representative. And when he shall come again to Judge the World, the Saints
shall come with him. So it is Prophesied, Zech. 14.6. The Lord my God shall
come, and all the Saints with thee. And as they shall come with Christ from
Heaven, so they shall sit on Thrones with him, judging, by way of suffrage.
They shall be assessors with the Judge, 1 Cor. 6.2. This deserves a special
remark that all this honor is given to Christ as our head and representative,
for thence results abundance of comfort to the people o^ God. Carry it
therefore along with you in your thoughts throughout the whole of Christ's
advancement. Think when you shall hear that Christ is risen from the dead, and
is in all that glory and authority in Heaven. How sure the salvation of his
Redeemed is. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the
death of his Son, much more being reconciled; we shall be saved by his Life.
Surely it cannot be supposed but he is able to save to the uttermost all them
that come to God by him: Seeing he ever lives to make intercession, Heb. 7.25.
Think how safe the people of God in this world are, whose head is in Heaven. It
was a comfortable expression of one of the Fathers encouraging himself and
others with this truth in a dark day. Nonne videnus capat nostrum super aquas?
Greg.
Come (said he) why do we tremble thus, do we not see our head above water? If
he live believers cannot die, Ioh. 14.19. Because I live, ye shall live also.

And let no man's heart suggest a suspicious thought to him, that this wonderful
advancement of Christ may cause him to forget his poor people, groaning here
below under sin and misery. For the temper and disposition of his faithful and
tender heart is not changed with his condition. He bears the same respect to
us, as when he dwelt among us. For indeed he there lives and acts upon our
account, Heb. 7.25. 1 Ioh. 2.1, 2.

And how seasonable and comfortable will the meditations of Christ's Exaltation
be to the believer* when sickness has wasted thy Body withered its beauty, and
God is bring^ng the^ to the dust of Death. Ah think then, that that vile Body
shall be conformed to the glorious Body of Christ, P^al. 3.21. As God has
glorified and highly exalted (...) Son, whose form was marred more than any
man's, so will he exalt thee also. I do not say to a parity or equality in glory
with Christ, for in heaven he will be discerned and distinguished by his
peculiar glory, from all the Angels and Saints; as the Sun is known by its
excelling glory from the lesser Star. But we shall be conformed to this
glorious head according to the proportion of members. O whither will Love mount
the believer in that day!

Having spoken this much of Christ's exalted state to cast some general light
upon it, and engage your attentions to it, I shall now, according to the
degrees of this his wonderful exaltation briefly open it under the
forementioned heads, viz. His Resurrection, Ascension, Session at the Fathers
right hand, and his return to Judge the World.

Sermon. 39.

influences upon the Saints Resurrection is clearly opened and comfortably

MATTHEW. XXVIII.VI. He is not here, for he is risen; as he said: come, see the
place, where the Lord lay.


WE have finished the Doctrine of Christ's humiliation wherein the Sun of
righteousness appeared to you as a setting Sun, gone out of sight; but as the
Sun when it is gone down to us, begins a new day in another part of the world,
so Christ having finished his course and work in this world; rises again and
that in order to the acting another glorious part of his work in the world
above. In his death he was upon the matter totally Eclipsed, but in his
Resurrection he begins to recover his light and glory again. God never intended
that the darling of his soul, should be lost in an obscure Sepulcher. An Angel
descends from heaven to roll away the stone, and with it the reproach of his
death. And to be the heavenly Herald to proclaim his Resurrection to the two
Mary's, whose love to Christ had at this time drawn them to visit the
Sepulcher, where they lately left him.

At this time, (the Lord being newly risen) the keepers were trembling, and
become as dead men. So great was the terrible Majesty and awful solemnity
attending Christ's Resurrection: but to encourage these good souls, the Angel
prevents them with these good tidings. He is not here, for he is risen as he
said; come, see the place where the Lord lay, q. d. Be not troubled, though you
have not the end you came for, one sight more of your dear, though dead Jesus;
yet you have not lost your labor; for to your eternal comfort I tell you, he
is risen; as he said. And to put it out of doubt, come hither, and satisfy
your selves, see the place where the Lord lay.

In which word we have both a Declaration and Confirmation of the Resurrection
of Christ from the dead.

First, A Declaration of it by the Angel both Negatively and Affirmatively.
Argumentum quo probamus Christum seipsum suscitasse vi propria petitur exipsa
Resurrectionis activitae^c, Christus (...) surrexit Matthew. 28.6. (...), Act.
1.3. Maccov. soc. Com. p. 874.
Negatively, he is not here. Here indeed you laid him, here you left him, and
here you thought to find him as you left him; but you are happily mistaken, he
is not here. However this giving them no satisfaction, for he might continue
dead still, though removed to another place, as indeed they suspected he was,
Ioh. 20.13. Therefore his resurrection is declared Positively and
Affirmatively, he is risen, (...), the word imports the active power, or self
quickening principle by which Christ raised himself from the state of the dead.
Which Luke takes notice of also Acts 1.3. Where he says, he showed, or
presented himself alive after his Passion. It was the divine nature or Godhead
of Christ which revived and raised the manhood.

Secondly, Here is also a plain confirmation of Christ's Resurrection, and that
first, from Christ's own Prediction, he is risen, as he said. He ^oretold that
which I declare to be now fulfilled. Let it not therefore seem incredible to
you. Secondly, by their own sight, come see the place where the Lord lay. The
Grave has lost its guest, it is now empty, death has lost its prey. It
received, but could not retain him. Come see the place where the Lord lay. Thus
the Resurrection of Christ is declared, and confirmed. Hence our Observation is

DOCT. That our Lord Jesus Christ, Doct.
by the Almighty power of his own Godhead, revived, and rose from the Dead; to
the terror and consternation of his enemies, and the unspeakable consolation of
Believers.
That our Lord Jesus Christ, though laid, was not lost in the Grave; but the
third day revived and rose again, is a truth confirmed to us by many infallible
proofs as Luke witnesses, Act. 1.3. We have Testimonies of it both from heaven
and earth, and both infallible. From Heaven we have the Testimony of Angels,
and to the Testimony of an Angel all credit is due; for Angels are holy
Creatures and cannot deceive us. The Angel tells the two Mary's in the Text, he
is risen. We have Testimonies of it from men, holy men, who were eye witnesses
of this truth, to whom he showed himself alive by the space of forty days after
his Resurrection by no less than Joh. 20.14. Mark. 16.12. Joh. 20.19. 1 Cor.
15.6. 1 Cor. 15.7. 1 Cor. 15.8. Joh. 7.26. Joh. 21.1.2. Luke 24.36.
nine solemn Apparitions to them. Sometime five hundred Brethren saw him at
once, 1 Cor. 15.6. These were holy persons who durst not deceive, and who
confirmed their Testimony with their blood. So that no point of Religion is of
more confessed truth, and infallible certainty than this before us.

And blessed be God it is so. For if it were not, then were the Gospel in vain,
1 Cor. 15.14. Seeing it hangs the whole weight of our Faith, In morte erat
solutio in motu, ant ut aiunt, in fieri; verum in Resurrection: completa fuit,
^^de nostri justificatio sea a debito absolutio, non morti, sed Resurrectioni
Apostolo merito tribua^^r, etc. Maccov. loc. Com. ^^ 809.
hope and salvation upon Christ as risen from the dead. If this were not so,
then would the holy and divinely inspired Apostles be found false witnesses, 1
Cor. 15.15. For they all with one mouth constantly and to the death affirmed
it. If Christ be not risen, then are believers yet in their sins, 1 Cor. 15.17.
For our Justification is truly ascribed to the Resurrection of Christ, Romans
4.25. While Christ was dying, and continued in the state of the dead, the price
of our Redemption was all that while but in paying, the payment was completed
when he revived and rose again. Therefore for Christ to have continued always
in the state of the dead, had been never to have completely satisfi^d; hence
the whole force and weight of our Justification depends upon his Resurrection.
Nay had not Christ risen, the dead had perished, 1 Cor. 15.17. Even the dead
who dyed in the Faith of Christ, and of whose salvation there now remains no
ground to doubt. Moreover,

Had he not revived, and risen from the dead, how could all the Types that
prefigured it have been satisfied? Surely they must have stood as insignificant
things in the Scriptures, and so must all the predictions of his Resurrection,
by which it was so plainly foretold. See Matthew. 12.40. Luke 24.46. Psalm. 16.10.
1 Cor. 15.4.

To conclude, had he not risen from the dead how could he have been installed
in that glory whereof he is now possessed in heaven, and which was promised him
before the world was upon the account of his death and sufferings. For to this
end Christ both dyed, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the
dead, and living, Romans 14.9. And that in this state of dominion and glorious
advancement, he might powerfully apply the virtues and benefits of his blood to
us; which else had been as a precious Cordial spilt upon the ground.

So then, there remains no doubt at all of the certainty of Christ's
Resurrection, it was so, and upon all accounts it must needs be so, for you see
how great a weight the Scriptures hang upon this nail. And blessed be God it is
a nail fastened in a sure place. I need spend no more words to confirm it, but
rather choose to explain and open the nature and manner of his Resurrection,
which I shall do by showing you four or five properties of it. And the first is
this.

First, Christ rose from the dead with awful Majesty. So you Matthew. 28.2, 3, 4.
And behold there was a great Earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord descended
from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon
it; his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as Snow, and for
fear of him the Keepers did shake, and became as dead men. Humane infirmity was
not able to bear such heavenly Majesty as attended the business of that
morning. Nature ^ank under it. This Earthquake was as one calls it, Triumphale
Signum. A sign of Triumph or token of Victory given by Christ not only to the
Keepers and the neighboring City, but to the whole world, that he had overcome
Death in its own dominions, and like a conqueror lifted up his head above all
his enemies. So when the Lord fought from heaven for his people, and gave them
a glorious, though but Temporal deliverance, see how the Prophe^ess drives on
the triumph in that Rhetorical Song, Judge. 5.4, 5. Alluding to the most awful
appearance of God, at the giving of the Law. Lord, when thou wentest out of
Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edome, (...)
the Earth trembled, and the heavens droped, Est incedere cum pomp^ and
Maj^state.
the clouds also droped water. The mountains melted before the Lord, even that
Sinai, from before the lord God of Israel. Our Lord Jesus went out of the Grave
in like manner and marched out of that bloody field with a pomp and Majesty
becoming so great a conqueror.

Secondly, And to increase the splendour of that day, and drive on the Triumph,
his Resurrection was attended with the Resurrection of many of the Saints who
had slept in their Graves till then, and then were awakned and raised to attend
the Lord at his rising. So you read Matthew. 27, 52, 53. And the Graves were
opened, and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose, and came out of the
Graves, after his Resurrection; and went into the holy City, and appeared unto
many. This wonder was designed both to adorn the Resurrection of Christ, and to
give a specimen or handsel of our Resurrection; which also is to be in the
virtue of his. This indeed was the Resurrection of Saints, and none but Saints,
the Resurrection of many Saints, yet it was but a special Resurrection,
intended only to show what God will one day do for all his Saints. And for
present to give Testimony of Christ's Resurrection from the dead. They were seen
and known of many in the City, who doubtless never thought to have seen them
any more in this world. To enquire curiously as some do, who they were, what
discourse they had with those to whom they appeared, and what became of them
afterward, is a vain thing. God has cast a vail of silence and secrecy upon
these things, that we might content our selves with the written Word, and he
that will not believe Moses and the Prophets, neither will he believe though
one arise from the dead, as these Saints did.

Thirdly, As Christ rose from the dead with those Sa^ellites, or attendants,
who accompanied him at his Resurrection; so it was by the power of his own
Godhead that he quickened and raised himself; and by the virtue of his
Resurrection were they raised also who accompanied him. It was not the Angel
who rolled back the stone that revived him in the Sepulcher; but he r^sumed his
own life, so he tells us, Ioh. 10.18. I lay down my life that I might take it
again. Hence in 1 Pet. 3.18. He is said to be put to death in the flesh but
quickened by the Spirit ( i. e.) by the power of his Godhead o^ divine nature,
which is opposed there to flesh or his humane nature. By the eternal Spirit he
offered himself up to God, when he dyed, Heb. 9.14. (i. e.) by his own
Godhead, not the third person in the Trinity, for then it could not have been
ascribed to him as his own act, that he offered up himself. And by the same
spirit he was quickened again.

And therefore the Apostle well observes, Romans 1.4. That he was declared to be
the Son of God with power, by his Resurrection from the dead. Now if he had
been raised by the power of the Father or Spirit only, and not by his own; how
could he be declared by his Resurrection to be the Son of God? What more had
appeared in him than in others? For others are raised by the power of God, if
that were all. So that in this respect also it was a mavelous Resurrection.
Never any did, or shall rise as Christ rose by a self-quickning principle. For
though many dead Saints rose at that time also. Yet it was by the virtue of
Christ's Resurrection that their Graves were opened, and their bodies quickened.
In which respect he says, Ioh. 11.25. when he raised dead Lazarus. I am the
Resurrection and the life, (i. e.) the principle of life and quickening, by
which the dead Saints are raised.

Fourthly, And therefore it may be truly affirmed, that though the firstborn
from the dead, as he is called, Col. 1.18. For though Lazarus and others were
raised, yet not by themselves, but by Christ. It was by his virtue and power,
not their own. And though they were raised to life, yet they died again. Death
recovered them again, but Christ dies no more. Death has no dominion over
him. He was the first that opened the womb of the Earth, the firstborn from
the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.

Fifthly, But lastly, Christ rose as a public or common person. As the first
fruits of them that sleep, 1 Cor. 15.20. I desire this may be well understood;
^or upon this account it is that our Resurrection is secured to us by the
Resurrection of Christ; and not a Resurrection only, but a blessed and happy
one, for the first fruits, both assured and sanctified the whole crop or
harvest.

Now that Christ did rise as a public person representing and comprehending
all the Elect, who are called the children of the Resurrection, Genus humanu^
in pa^^nte primo, ve^^^ in radice putru^t. Greg.
is plain from Ephesians. 2.6. Where we are said to be risen with or in him. So that
as we are said to die in Adam, (who also was a common person) as the branches
die in the death of the root; so we are said to be raised from death in Christ,
who is the head, root, and representative of all his Elect seed. And why is he
called the firstborn, and first begotten from the dead, but with respect to
the whole number of the Elect, that are to be born from the dead in their time
and order also, and as sure as the whole harvest follows the first fruits, so
shall the general Resurrection of the Saints to life eternal, follow this
birth, of the firstborn from the dead.

It shall surely follow it I say, and that not only as a consequent follows an
antecedent, but as an effect follows its proper cause. Now there is a three
fold causality or influence that Christ's Resurrection has upon the Saints
Resurrection, of which it is both the meritorious, efficient, and exemplary
cause.

First, The Resurrection of Christ is the meritorious cause of the Saints
Resurrection, as it completed his satisfaction, and finished his payment, and
so our Justification is properly assigned to it, as before was noted from Romans
4.25. This his Resurrection was the receiving of the acquittance, the
cancelling of the bond. And had not this been done, we had still been in our
sins as he speaks, 1 Cor. 15.17. And so our guilt had been still a bar to our
happy Resurrection. But now, the price being paid in his Death, which payment
was finished when he revived; and the discharge then received for us, now there
is nothing lies in bar against our Resurrection to eternal life.

Secondly, As it is the meritorious cause of our Resurrection, so so it is the
efficient cause of it also. For when the time shall come that the Saints shall
rise out of the dust, they shall be raised by Christ as their head, in whom the
effective principle of their life is. Your life is hid with Christ in God as it
is, Proximum instrumentum sive ^e^es sonni est cerebrum, u^pote is quo spiritus
anima^es frig^fiunt and co^de^santur, aut etiam resolv^ntur and dissipantur
proxime, tanquam in p^opria spi^ituum animalium officina, and in quo etiam
radices nervorum obstru^nt^r, per vapores, ne spiritus animales sensui communi
servire aut in parts reliquas inferiores corporis propagari libere possint.
Keckerm. Syst. Phys. p. (mihi). 441.
Col. 3.3. As when a man awakes out of sleep, the animal spirits seated in the
brain, being set at liberty by the digestion of those vapors that bound them
up, do play freely through every part and member of the body, so Christ the
believers mystical head being quickened; the spirit of life which is in him
shall be diffused through all his members to quicken them also in the morning
of the Resurrection. Hence the warm animating dew of Christ's Resurrection is
said to be to our bodies, as the dew of the morning is to the withered
languishing plants which revive by it, Isa. 26.19. Thy dew is as the dew of
Herbs, and then it follows, the earth shall cast forth her dead. So that by the
same Faith we put Christ's Resurrection into the Premises, we may put the
believers Resurrection into the Conclusion. And therefore the Apostle makes
them convertibles, reasoning forward from Christ's to ours, and back again from
ours, to his, 1 Cor. 15.12, 13. Which is also the sense of that Scripture, Romans
8.10, 11. And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but
the spirit is life because of righteousness, (i. e.) though you are really
united to Christ by the Spirit, yet your bodies must die as well as other men's;
but your souls shall be presently upon your dissolution swallowed up in life.
And then it follows verse. 11. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also
quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwells in you, (i. e.) though
your bodies must die, yet they shall live again in the Resurrection; and that
by virtue of the spirit of Christ which dwells in you; and is the bond of
your mystical union with him your head. You shall not be raised as others are,
by a mere word of power, but by the spirit of life dwelling in Christ your
head, which is a choice prerogative indeed.

Thirdly, Christ's Resurrection is not only the meritorious and efficient cause,
but it is also the exemplary cause, or pattern of our Resurrection. Optimum in
^^oquoque genere, est regula and ^ensura ceteroram.
He being the first and best, is therefore the pattern and measure of all the
rest. So you read Phil. 3.21. Who shall change our vile body that it may be
fashioned like unto his glorious body. Now the Conformity of our Resurrection
to Christ's stands in the following particulars. Christ's body was raised
substantially the same, so will ours. His body was raised first, so will ours
be raised before the rest of the dead. His body was wonderfully improved by the
Resurrection, so will ours. His body was raised to be glorified, and so will
ours.

First, Christ's body was raised substantially the same that it was before, and
so will ours. Not another* but the same body. Upon this very reason the Apostle
us^s that idential expression, 1 Cor. 15.53. This corruptible must put on
incorruption, and the mortal immortality. Pointing as it were to his own body
when he spoke it, the same body I say, and that not only Specifically the same,
(for indeed no other Species of flesh is so privileged) but the same
numerically, that very body, not a new or another body in its steed. So that it
shall be both the what it was* and the who it was. And indeed to deny this is
to deny the Resurrection it self. For should God prepare another body to be
raised instead of this, it would not be a Resurrection but a Creation; for non
Resurrectio dici poterit, ubi non resurgit quod cecidit. That cannot be called a
Resurrection, where one thing falls and another thing rises as Gregory long
since pertinently observed.

Secondly, His body was raised, not by a word of power from the Father, but by
his own spirit. So will ours. Indeed the power of God shall go forth to
unburrough sinners, and fetch them forcibly out of their Graves; but the
Resurrection of the Saints is to be effected another way as I opened but now to
you. Even by his spirit which now dwells in them. That very spirit of Christ
which effected their spiritual Resurrection from sin, shall effect their
corporal Resurrection also from the Grave.

Thirdly, His body was raised first, he had in this as well as in other things
the pre-eminence; so shall the Saints in respect of the wicked have the
pre-eminence in the Resurrection, 1 These. 4.16. The dead in Christ shall rise
first. They are to attend the Lord at his coming, and will be knocked up ^ooner
than the rest of the world to attend on that service. As the Sheriff with his
men go for^h to meet the Judge, before the Jailer brings forth his prisoner.

Fourthly, Christ's body was marvelously improved by the Resurrection, and so
will ours. It fell in weakness, but was raised in power, no more capable of
sorrows, pains, and dishonours. In like manner our bodies are sown in weakness,
but raised in strength, sown in dishonor, raised in glory. Sown natural bodies
raised spiritural bodies as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 15.43, 44. Spiritual
bodies not properly but Analogically. Membri detru^catio vel obtusio nonne mo^^
m^mbri est! Si u iv^rsal^s mors Resu^rectione rescinditur* quanto maj^s
portionalis. Tur. de Resur.
No distempers hang about glorified bodies, nor are they thence forth subject
to any of those natural necessities, to which they are now tied. There are no
flaws, defects, or deformities in the children of the Resurrection. What
members are now defective, or deformed will then be restored to their perfect
being and beauty, for if the universal death of all parts be rescinded by the
Resurrection, how much more the partial Death of any single member? As
Turtullian speaks* and from thence forth they are free from the Law of
mortality, they can die no more, Luke 20, 35, 36. Thus shall they be improved
by their Resurrection.

Fifthly, To conclude, Christ's body was raised from the Dead to be glorified,
and crowned with honor. Oh it was a joyful day to him, and so will the
Resurrection of the Saints be to them, the day of the gladness of their hearts.
It will be said to them in that morning, awake and sing ye that dwell in the
dust, as Isa. 26.19. O how comfortable will be the meeting betwixt the
glorified soul, and its new raised body. Much more comfortable than that of
Jacobs and Joseph's after twenty years absence, Genesis 46.29. Or that of David's
with Jonathan when he came out of the Cave to him, 1 Samuel 20.41. Or that of the
Father of the prodigal with his Son, who was dead, and is alive, was lost, and
is found. As he speaks, Luke 15. And there are three things will make it so.

First, The gratifications of the Soul by the satisfaction of its natural
appetite of union with its own body. For even glorified souls in heaven have
such an appetition, and desire of reunion. Indeed the Angels who are pure
spirits, as they never h^d union with, so they have no inclination to matter;
but souls are otherwise tempered and disposed. We are all sensible of its
affection to the body now in its compounded state, we feel the tender care it
has for the body, the sympathy with it, and loathness to be separated from it.
It Is said, 1 Cor. 5.6. To be at home in the body. And had not God implanted
such an inclination to this its Tabernacle in it, it would not have paid that
due respect it ows the body while it inhabited in it, nor have regarded what
became of it when it left it. This inclination remains still with it in heaven,
it reckons not it self completely happy till its old dear Companion and partner
be with it, and to that sense some understand those words, Job 14.14. All the
days of my appointed time, (i. e.) of the time appointed ^or my body to remain
in the Grave, will I wait till my change (viz. that which will be made by the
Resurrection) come, for it is manifest enough he speaks there of the
Resurrection. Now, when this its inclination to its own body, its longings and
hankerings after it are gratified with a sight and enjoyment of it again, oh
what a comfortable meeting will this make it! Especially if we consider.

Secondly, The excellent temper and state in which they shall meet each other.
For as the body shall be raised with all the improvements and endownments
imaginable which may render it amiable and every way desirable, so the soul
comes down immediately from God out of Heaven shining in its holiness and glory.
It comes perfumed out of those Ivory Palaces, with a strong scent of Heaven
upon it. And thus it reenters its body and animates it again. But

Thirdly, And principally that wherein the chief joy of this meeting consists,
is the end for which the glorified soul comes down to quicken and repossess it.
Namely, to meet the Lord, and ever to be with the Lord. To receive a full
reward, for all the labors and services it performed to God in this world.
This must needs make that day, a day of Triumph and Exaltation. It comes out of
the grave, as Joseph out of his prison to be advanced to highest honor. O do
but imagine what an ecstasy of Joy, and ravishing pleasure it will be for a
soul thus to resume its own body, and say as it were unto it, come away my
dear, my ancient friend, who servedst, and sufferedst with me in the world;
come along with me to meet the Lord, in whose presence I have be ever since I
parted with thee. Now thy bountiful Lord has remembered thee also, and the day
of thy glorification is come. Surely it will be a joyful awaking. For do but
imagine what a Joy it is for dear friends to meet after long separation, how do
they use to give demonstrations of their love and delight in each other by
Embraces, Kisses, Tears, etc. Or frame but to your selves a notion of perfect
health, when a sprightly vivacity runs through every part; and the spirits do
as it were dance before us when we go to any business. Especially to such a
business as the business of that day will be; to receive a Crown and a Kingdom.
Do but imagine then what a Sunshine morning this will be, and how the pains
and agonies, cold sweats, and bitter groans at parting will be recompensed by
the joy of such a meeting?

And thus I have showed you briefly the certainty of Christ's Resurrection, the
nature and properties of it, the threefold influence it has on the Saints
Resurrection, and the conformity of ours unto his in these five respects. His
body rose substantially the same, so shall ours. His body was raised by the
spirit, so shall ours. Not by the Godhead of Christ as his was, but by the
Spirit who is the bond of our union with Christ. He was raised as the first
begotten from the dead, so the dead in Christ shall rise first. His body was
improved by the Resurrection, so shall ours. From the consideration of all which

Inference 1.
We Infer, How far short do we come of the primitive Christians whose faith in
the Resurrection, and contempt of death Cyprian th^s expresses. ^ente integra,
side firma virtute robusta parati ad omnem Dei voluntat* ne fimus pavo^e mortis
omni excluso; i^mortalitatem quae sequitur cogitamus. Et cum accersitionis

That if Christ was thus raised from the dead, then death is fairly overcome,
and smallowed up in Victory. Were it not so, it had never let Christ escape out
of the Grave. The prey of the terrible had never been thus rescued out of its
paws. Death is a dreadful enemy, it defies all the Sons and Daughters of Adam.
None durst cope with this King of terrors but Christ. And he by dying went into
the very den of this Dragon, fought with it and foiled it in the Grave its own
territories and dominions, and came off a Conqueror. For as the Apostle speaks,
Acts 2.24. It was impossible it should hold or detain him. Never did death meet
with its over match before it met with Christ. And he conquering it for us, and
in our names, rising as our representative, now every single Saint triumphs
over it as a vanquished enemy, 1 Cor. 15.55. O death where is thy Sting? O Grave
where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God, who has given us the Victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus like Joshua they set the foot of faith upon the
neck of that King, and with an holy scorn deride its power. O death where is
thy Sting? If it be objected that it is said, 1 Cor. 15.26. The last enemy that
is to be destroyed is Death. And if so, then it should seem the Victory is not
yet achieved, and so we do but boast before the Victory. It is at hand to
reply, that the Victory over death obtained by Christ's Resurrection is twofold,
either personal and incomplete, or general and complete. He actually overcame
it at his Resurrection in his own person perfectly, and vertually for us as our
head, but at the general Resurrection of the Saints (which his Resurrection as
the first fruits assures them of) then it is utterly vanquished, and destroyed.
Till then it will exercise some little power over the bodies of the Saints, in
which respect it is called the last enemy. For sin the chief enemy that let it
in, that was conquered utterly and eradicated when they died; but death holds
their bodies in the Grave till the coming of Christ, and then it is utterly to
be vanquished. For after that they can die no more, Luke 20.35. And then shall
be brought to pass that saying that is written, death is swallowed up in
Victory. Then, and not till then will that conquest be fully completed in our
persons, though it be already so in Christ's, incompleatly in ours, and then
completely and fully for ever. For the same word which signifies Victory, does
also signify Perpetuity, and in this place a final or perpetual conquest. And
indeed it drives but a poor trade for present, smiting only with its Dart, not
with its Sting, and that but the believers body only, and the body but for a
time remains under it neither. So that there is no reason why a believer should
stand in a slavish fear of it.

Inference 2.
Infer. 2.
Is Christ risen, and has his Resurrection such a potent and comfortable
influence into the Resurrection of the Saints. Then it is the duty and will be
the wisdom of the people of God so to Govern, dispose, and employ their bodies
as becomes men and women that understand what glory is prepared for them at the
Resurrection of the Just. Particularly, First, Be not fondly tender of them,
but employ and use them for God here. How many good duties are lost and spoiled
by sinful indulgence to our bodies? Alas, we are generally more solicitous to
live long, than to live usefully. How many Saints have active vigorous bodies,
yet God has little service from them. If your bodies were animated by some
other souls that love God more than you do, and burn with holy Zeal to his
service, more work would be done for God by your bodies in a day, than is now
done in a month. To have an able healthy body, and not use it for God for fear
of hurting it, is as if one should give you a strong and stately Horse, upon
condition you must not work, or ride him. Wherein is the mercy of having a body
except it be employed for God? Will not its reward at the Resurrection be
sufficient for all the pains you now put it to in his service? Secondly, See
that you preserve the due honor of your bodies. Possess them in Sanctification
and honor, 1 These. 4.4. O let not those eyes be now defiled with sin, by which
you shall see God. Those ears be in-lets to vanity, which shall hear the
Alaleujahs of the blessed. God has designed honor for your bodies, O make
them not either the instruments, or objects of sin. There are sins against the
body, 1 Cor. 6.18. Preserve your bodies from those defilements for they are the
Temples of God; If any man defile the Temple of God, him will God destroy, 1
Cor. 3.17. Thirdly, Let not the contentment and accommodation of your bodies
draw your souls into snares, and bring them under the power of Temptations to
sin. This is a very common case. O how many thousands of precious souls perish
eternally, for the satisfaction of a vile body for a momen^? Their Souls must,
because their bodies cannot suffer. It is recorded to the immortal honor of
those worthies in Heb. 11.35. N^mo potest in ha^^ita, and infutura ^audere;
ne^ess^ est u^am amittat, q^i al^eram vult possidere. Aug.
That they accepted not deliverance, that they might obtain a better
Resurrection. They might have had a Temporal Resurrection from death, to life;
from reproach, to honor; from poverty, to riches; from pains, to pleasure; but
upon such terms they Judged it not worth acceptance. They would not expose
their souls, to secure their bodies. They had the same natural affections that
other men have. They were made of as tender flesh as we are, but such was the
care they had of their souls, and the hope of a better Resurrection; that they
listened not to the complaints and whinings of their bodies. O that we were all
in the same resolutions with them. Fourthly, Withhold not upon the pretense of
the wants your own bodies may be in, that which God and conscience bids you to
communicate for the refreshment of the Saints; whose present necessities
require your assistance. O be not too indulgent to your own flesh, and cruel to
others. Certainly the consideration of that reward which shall be given you at
the Resurrection, for every act of Christian Charity; is the greatest spur and
incentive in the world to it. And to that end it is urged as a motive to
Charity, Luke 14.13, 14. When thou make a feast call the poor, the maimed,
the lame, the blind, and thou shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense
thee, for thou shall be recompensed at the Resurrection of the Just. Mr
Marshall.
It was the opinion of an eminent modern Divine, that no man living fully
understands and believes that Scripture, Matthew. 25.40. In as much as ye have
done it to one of the least of these my brethren; ye have done it unto me. How
few Saints would be exposed to daily wants and necessities, if that Scripture
were but fully understood and believed?


Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
Is Christ risen from the dead, and that as a public person and representative
of believers? How are we all concerned then to secure to our selves an interest
in Christ, and consequently to this blessed Resurrection? What consolation
would be left in this world, if the hope of the Resurrection were taken away?
It Is this blesed hope that must support you under all the Troubles of life, and
in the Agonies of Death. The securing of a blessed Resurrection to your selves,
is therefore the most deep concernment you have in this world. And it may be
secured to your selves, if upon serious heart examination you can discover the
following Evidences.

Evidence 1. First, If you are regenerated Creatures, brought forth in a new
nature to God, for we are begotten again to a lively hope, by the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ from the dead. Christ's Resurrection is the groundwork of our
hope. And the new birth is our title or evidence of our interest in it. So that
until our souls are partakers of the spiritual Resurrection from the death of
sin, we can have no assurance our bodies shall be partakers of that blessed
Resurrection to life.

Blessed and holy (says the Spirit) is he that has part in the first
Resurrection, on such the second death has no power, Rev. 20.6. Never let
unregenerated souls expect a comfortable meeting with their bodies again. Rise
they shall by Gods terrible Citation, at the sound of the last trump; but not
to the same end that the Saints arise, nor by the same principle. They to whom
the spirit is now a principle of Sanctification, to them he will be the
principle of a joyful Resurrection. See then that you get gracious souls now,
or never expect glorious bodies then.

Evid. 2. If you be dead with Christ, you shall live again by the life of
Christ. If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall
be also in the likeness of his Resurrection, Romans 6.5. (...), (...). In unum
co^cres^re vel coal scere.
Planted together, some refer it to believers themselves, Jews, and Gentiles
are planted together in Christ. So Erasmus, believers grow together like
branches upon the same root; which should powerfully enforce the great Gospel
duty of unity among themselves. But I would rather understand it with reference
to Christ, and believers; with whom believers are in other Scriptures said to
suffer together, and be glorified together, to die together, and live together,
to be Crucified together, and buried together all noting the communion they
have with Christ, both in his death and in his life. Now if the power of
Christ's death, (i. e.) the mortifying influence of it have been upon our
hearts; killing their Lusts, deading their affections, and flatting their
appetites to the Creature; then, the power of his life, or Resurrection shall
come like the animating dew upon our dead withered bodies, to revive and raise
them up to live with him in glory.

Evid. 3. If your hearts and affections be now with Christ in Heaven, your
bodies in due time shall be there also, and conformed to his glorious body. So
you find it, Phil. 3.20, 21. For our conversation is in heaven, from whence we
look for the Savior; (...).
the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body; that it may be
fashioned like unto his own glorious body. The body is here called vile, or the
body of our vileness. Not as God made it, but as sin has marred it. Not
absolutely and in it self, but relatively, and in comparison of what it will be
in its second edition, at the Resurrection. Then those scattered bones, and
dispersed dust, like pieces of old broken battered Silver, will be new cast,
and wrought in the best and newest fashion: even like to Christ's glorious body.
Whereof we have this evidence, that our conversation is already heavenly. The
temper, frame, and disposition of our souls is already so; therefore the frame
and temper of our bodies in due time shall be so.

Evid. 4. If you strive now by any means to attain the Resurrection of the
dead, no doubt but you shall then attain, what you now strive for. This was
Paul's great ambition, that by any means, he might attain the Resurrection of
the dead, Phil. 3.11. He means not simply a Resurrection from the dead, for
that all men shall attain whether they strive for it, or no. But by a metonymy
of the Subject, for the Ajunct; he intends that complete holiness and
perfection which shall attend the state of the Resurrection so it is expounded,
verse. 12. So then, if God have raised in your hearts a vehement desire, and
assiduous endeavor aft^r a perfect freedom from sin, and full Conformity to
God in the beauties of holiness; that very love of holiness, your present
pantings, and tendencies after perfection; speaks you to be persons designed
for it.

Evid. 5. If you are such as do good in your Generation. If you be fruitful and
useful men and women in the world, you shall have part in this blessed
Resurrection, Ioh. 5.29. All that are in the Graves shall hear his voice, and
shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the Resurrection of Life. Now
it is not every act materially good, Si bonus bora facit been ad bonum.
that entitles a man to this privilege; but the same requisites that the
Schoolmen assign to make a good prayer; are also necessary to every good work.
The person, matter, manner, and end must be good. Nor is it any single good
act, but a series and course of holy actions, that is here meant. What a spur
should this be to us all, (as indeed the Apostle makes it, closing up the
Doctrine of the Resurrection with this solemn exhortation, 1 Cor. 15. Last,
with which I also close mine) Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast
unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for as much as you know,
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

Thanks be to God for his unspeakable Gift.
The FORTIETH Sermon. 40.
SERMON. Wherein the Ascension of Christ is opened, and variously improved,
being the second step of his Exaltation.

JOH. XX.XVII. Jesus says unto her, touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
my Father: but go to my Brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father,
and your Father; and to my God, and your God.


IN all the former Sermons we have been following Christ through his
Humiliation, from the time that he left the blessed bosom of his Father: and
now having finished the whole course of his obedience on Earth, and risen again
from the Dead, we must in this Discourse follow him back again into Heaven; and
lodge him in that bosom of ineffable delight and love, which for our sakes he
so freely left. For it was not his end in rising from the Dead, to live such a
low animal life as this is; but to live a most glorious life as an enthroned
King in Heaven; upon which state he was now ready to enter, as he tells Mary in
the Text, and bids her to tell it to the Disciples, go tell my Brethren, that I
ascend to my Father, etc.

V^l^bat Ma^ia Christ m^am lec^i, praenimio scilicet a^oe ejus, and gaudio quod
ru^un in ^a^^e p^^s^^tem v^d s^^t. B^c^r. in Loc.
In the former verses you find Mary waiting at Christ's Sepulcher in a very
pensive frame; exceedingly troubled because she knew not what was become of
Christ. Verse. 15. in the next verse Christ calls her by her name Mary, she
knowing the voice turned her sel^, and answered Rabboni. And as a soul
transported with joy rushes into his arms, as desirous to clasp and embrace
him; but Jesus said touch me not, etc. In which words we have Christ's
inhibition, touch me not, strange that Christ who rendered Thomas to put his
finger into his wounds, should sorbid Mary to touch him; but this was not for
want of love to Mary; for he gives another reason for it presently, I am not
yet ascended, (i. e.) say some, the time for embracing will be when we are in
Heaven. Then and there shall be the place and time, we shall embrace one
another for ever more. So Augustine. Or thou detest too much upon my present
state, as if I had now attained the very (...), culminating point of my
Exaltation. When as yet I am not ascended, so Camero, and Calvin expound it. Or
lastly Christ would signify hereby, that it was not his pleasure in so great a
juncture of things as this, to spend time now in expressing (this way) her
affections to him; but rather to show it by hasting about his service. Which is

second thing observable, viz. his injunction upon Mary, to carry the tidings
of his Resurrection to the Disciples, in which injunction we have First, The
persons to whom this message was sent, my Brethren, so he calls the Disciples.
A sweet compellation, and full of love. much like that of Joseph to his
Brethren, Genesis 45.4. Save only that there is much more tenderness in this than
that; for he twits them in the same breath with what they had done against him;
I am Joseph your Brother whom ye sold; but in this it is, go tell my Brethren,
without the least mention of their Cowardice or unkindness And Secondly, The
message it self. Tell my Brethren, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; to
my God, and your God, (...), I ascend. It Is put in the present Tense, as if he
had been then ascending; though he did not ascend in some weeks after this; but
he so expresses it, to show what was the next part of his work, which he was to
act in Heaven for them; and how much his heart was set upon it, and longed to
be about it, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
Not our Father, or God in Common: but mine, and yours in a different manner.
Yours by right of dominion, mine (in reference to my humane nature) not only by
right of Creation though so too; Mr. Henry Ieanes second part of the mixture of
Scholastical and Practical Divini^y. p. 273
but also by special Covenant, and Confaederation. By Praedestination of my
manhood to the grace of personal union, by designation of me to the glorious
office of Mediator. My Father, as I am God, by eternal generation. As man, by
collation of the grace of union. And your Father by spiritual Adoption and
regeneration. Thus he is my God and your God; my Father, and your Father. This
is the substance of that comfortable message, sent by Mary, to the pensive
Disciples. Hence the Observation is


DOCT. That our Lord Jesus Christ did not only rise from the Dead, Doct.
but also ascended into Heaven; there to dispatch all that remained to be done
for the completing the Salvation of his people.
So much the Apostle plainly witnesses, Ephesians. 4.10. He that descended, is the
same also that ascended up, far above all Heavens, (i. e.) all the aspectable
Heavens. A full and faithful account whereof the several Evangelists have given
us, Mark. 16.19. Luke 24.51. This is sometimes called his going away, as Ioh.
16.7. Sometimes his being exalted, Acts 2.33. Sometimes his being made higher
than the Heavens, Heb. 7.26. And sometimes his entering within the vail, Heb.
6.19, 20. All which are but so many Synonymous phrases expressing his ascension
in a pleasant variety.

Now for the opening this act of Christ, we will bind up the whole in the
satisfaction of these six Questions. First, who ascended? Secondly, whence did
he ascend? Thirdly, whither? Fourthly, when? Fifthly, how? And lastly, why did
he ascend? And these will take in what is needful for you to be acquainted with
in this point.

First, Who ascended? This the Apostle answers, Ephesians. 4.10. The same that
descended, Ascensio totius fuit personae, naturae tame^ divi^^ no^ convenit
nisi figurate. S^d humanae naturae maxim pro riae convenit, etc. Ames. Med. p.
114.
viz. Christ. And himself tells us in the Text, I ascend. And though the
ascension were of Christ's whole person, yet it was but a figurative and
improper expression with respect to his divine nature, but it agrees most
properly to the humanity of Christ, which really changed places and conditions
by it. And hence it is that it is said, Ioh. 16.28. I came forth from the
Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the
Father. He goes away, and we see him no more. As God, he is spiritually with us
still; even to the end of the world. But as man, the heavens must contain him
till the restitution of all things, Acts 3.21.

Secondly, Whence Christ ascended?

I answer, more generally, he is said to ascend from this world, to leave the
world. That is the terminus a quo, Joh. 16.28. But more particularly, it was
from mount Olivet, near unto Jerusalem. The very place where he began his last
sorrowful Tragedy. There where his heart began to be sadded, there is it now
made glad. O what a difference was there betwixt the frame Christ was in, in
that Mount before his Passion, and this he is now in, at his ascension! But

Thirdly, Whither did he ascend?

It Is manifest it was into the third Heavens. The Throne of God, and place of
the blessed. Where all the Saints shall be with him for ever. It Is said to be
far above all heavens. That is, the heavens which we see, for they are but the
pavement of that stately Palace of the great King. He is gone (says the
Apostle) within the vail, (i. e.) into the most holy Place. And into his
Fathers house, Ioh. 14.2. And he is also said to go to the place where he was
before, Joh. 6.62. Back again to that sweet and glorious bosom of delight and
Love from whence at his incarnation he came.

Fourthly, When did Christ ascend? was it presently as soon as he rose from the
dead?

No, not so, for after his Resurrection (says Luke) he was seen of them forty
days, speaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. And truly the
care and love of Christ to his people was very manifest in this his stay with
them. He had ineffable glory prepared for him in heaven, D^sipulorum infirmitas
hujus inter stitii moram postulabat. Ames.
and awaiting his coming; but he will not go to possess it, till he had settled
all things for the good of his Church here. For in this time he confirmed the
truth of his Resurrection, gave charge to the Apostles concerning the
Discipline and order of his house, or Kingdom; which was but needful since he
intended that their Acts should be rules to future Churches. So long it was
necessary he should stay. And when he had set all things in order, Ne terrenan
vitam videretur medita^e. Ames.
he would stay no longer, lest he should seem to affect a terrene life. And
besides he had work of great concernment to do for us in the other world. He
desired to be no longer here, than he had work to do for God, and souls. A good
pattern for the Saints.

Fifthly, How did Christ ascend into Heaven?

Here it is worthy our Observation, that Christ ascended as a public person,
Consolationem summam hoc ingressu nobis no^strat, neque enim sua, sed nostra
causa, ut de coelo descendit; ita coelum oc^upavit; ut nobis ibi locum atque
do^icilium pararet. Pareus in La.
or forerunner in our names, and upon our accounts. So it is said expressly,
Heb. 6.20. Speaking of the most holy place within the vail, whither (says he)
the forerunner is for us entered. His entering into heaven as our forerunner
implies both his public capacity, and precedence.

First, His public capacity, as one that went upon our business to God. So he
himself speaks, Ioh. 14.2. I go before to prepare a place for you. To take
possession of heaven in our names. The forerunner has respect to others that
were to come to heaven after him, in their several generations; for whom he
has taken up mansions, which are kept for them against their coming.

Secondly, It notes precedence. He is our forerunner, but he himself had no
forerunner. Never any entered into heaven before him, but such as entered in the
name, and through the virtue of his merits. He was the first that ever entered
heaven directly, immediately in his own name and upon his own account. But all
the Fathers who died before him, entered in his name. To the holiest of them all
God would have said as Elisha to Iehoram, 2 King. 3.14. Were it not that I had
respect to the person of my Son, in whose name and right you come; I would not
look upon you. You must back again* heaven were no place for you. No not for
you A^raham nor for you Moses.

Secondly, He ascended Triumphantly into heaven. To this good Expositors refer
that which in the Type is spoken of David, Molerus in loc. G^^us. Aynswerth.
when he lodged the Ark in its own place, with musical instruments and
shoutings; but to Christ in the Antitype when he was received up Triumphantly
into glory, Psalm. 47.5. God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of
a Trumpet; sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing
praises. Mr. Case in his Pi^gah.
A Cloud is prepared as a Royal Chariot to carry up this King of Glory to his
Princely pavillion. A Cloud received him out of their sight. Luke 24.51.
And then a Royal guard of mighty Angels surround the Chariot, if not for
support, yet for greater state, and solemnity of their Lords ascension. And oh
what Jubilations of the blessed Angels were heard in heaven! How was the whole
City of God moved at his coming. For look as when he brought his first begotten
into the world, he said, let all the Angels of God worship him: Heb. 1.6. So at
his return thither again, when he had finished Redemption work, there were no
less demonstrations given by those blessed Creatures of their delight and joy
in it. The very heavens ecchoed, and resounded on that account. Yea, the
Triumph is not ended at this day, nor ever shall.

It Is said, Dan. 7.13.14. I saw, (says the Prophet) in the night visions, and
behold one like the Son of man came with the Clouds of Heaven; and came to the
ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given
him, dominion, and glory and a Kingdom; that all People, Nations, and Languages
should serve him. This Vision of Daniels was accomplished in Christ's ascension,
when they (i. e.) the Angels brought him to the ancient of days (i. e.) to God
the Father, Vide ^codat^, and English. Annot. etc.
who to express his welcome to Christ, gave him glory and a Kingdom. And so it
is and ought to be expounded. The Father received him with open arms, rejoicing
exceedingly to see him again in heaven, therefore God is said to receive him up
into glory, 1 Timothy 3.16. For that which with respect to Christ, is called
ascension, is with respect to the Father called assumption. He went up, and the
Father received him. Yea, received him so, as none ever was received before
him, or shall be received after him.

Thirdly, Christ Ascended munificiently shedding forth abundantly inestimable
gifts upon his Church at his ascension. As in the Roman Triumphs they did
Spargere missilia, bestow their largesses upon the people; so did our Lord when
he ascended, wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led Captivity
Captive; So^^nt princip^s post victoriam dum triumphant, ^agna m^nera and
p^cunias in populum sibi triumphanti gratulantem and Iubila^tem, spargere.
Z^nch.
and gave gifts unto men. The place to which the Apostle refers, is Psalm.
68.17.18. where you have both the triumph and munificence with which Christ
went up excellently set forth together.

The Chariots of God (says the Psalmist) are twenty thousand, even thousands
of Angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place. Thou have
ascended on high, thou have led Captivity Captive, thou have received gifts for
men; Yea* for the rebellious also, that God might dwell among them. Which words
in their literal sense are a Celebra^ion of that famous victory and triumph of
David, ever the enemies of God* recorded, 2 Samuel 8. These conquered enemies
bring him several sorts of presents, all which he dedicated to the Lord. The
spiritual sense is, that just so our Lord Jesus Christ when he had overcome by
his death on the Cr^ss, Excitas ^^cto es ecc^esiae ti^^i^er cos q^i pop^lum
^uun ^^^u^t and p^^se ^^tur; and biad multos ^x hostitus tuis, ad hoc regnum
adaucis. Molerus. in loc.
and now triumphed in his ascension, he takes the parts and gifts of his
enemies, and gives them by their conversion to the Church* for its use and
service. Thus he received gifts even for the rebellious, (i. e.) sanct^fies the
natural gifts, and ^aculties of such as hated his people before, dedicating
them to the Lord in his peoples service. Thus (as one observes) Tertullian,
Origin, Austin, and Jerome, came into Canaan laden with Egyptian Gold. Meaning
they came into the Church richly furnished wi^h natural learning and abilities.
Austin was a Manichee, Cyprian a Magician, learned Bradwardine a scornful proud
na^urallist, who once said when he read Paul's Epistles, dedignabar esse
parvulus. He scorned such childish things, but afterward became a very useful
man in the Church of God. And even Paul himself, was as fierce an enemy to the
Church, as breathed on earth; till Christ gave him into its bosom by
conversion; and then no mere man ever did the Lord and his people greater
service than he. Men of all sorts. Greater and smaller lights, have been given
to the Church. Officers of all sorts were given it by Christ. Extraordinary and
temporary, as Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, ordinary and standing, as
Pastors, and Teachers which remain to this day, Ephesians. 4.8, 9. And those stars
are fixed in the Church heaven, by a most firm establishment, 1 Cor. 12.28.
Thousands now in heaven, and thousands on earth also, are blessing Christ at
this day for these his ascension gifts.

Fourthly, Our Lord Jesus Christ ascended most comfortably, for whilst he was
blessing his people, he was parted from them, Luke 24.50, 51. Therein making
good to them what is said of him, Ioh. 13.1. Having loved his own, he loved
them to the end. There was a great deal of love manifested by Christ in this
very last act of his, in this world. The last sight they had of him in this
world was a most sweet and encouraging one. They heard nothing from his lips
but love, they saw nothing in his face but love; till he mounted his triumphant
Chariot and was taken out of their sight.

Surely these blessings at parting were sweet and rich ones. For the matter of
them, they were the mercies which his blood had so lately purchased for them.
And for their extent, they were not only intended for them, who had the
happiness to be upon the place with him from whence he ascended; but they reach
us, as well as them; and will reach the last Saint that shall be upon the
earth, till he come again. For they were but representatives of the future
Churches, Matthew. 28.20. And in blessing them, he blessed us also. And by this
we may be satisfied that Christ carried an heart full of love to his people
away with him to heaven; since his love so abounded in the last act that ever
he did in this world. And left such a demonstration of his tenderness with them
at parting.

Fifthly, He ascended, as well as rose again, by his own power. He was not
merely passive, in that his ascension, but it was his own act. He went to
heaven. Therefore it is said, Act. 1.10. He went up, Causa hujus ascensionis
fuivirtus Divina -- sed ac^edebat insuper cond^tio corporis glorificati, quod
aeque sursum fertur atque deorsum. Ames.
viz. by his own divine power. And this plainly evinceth him to be God, for no
mere Creature ever mounted it self from earth, far above all heavens, as Christ
did.

Sixthly, And lastly, why did Christ ascend?

I answer his ascension was necessary upon many and great accounts. For First,
If Christ had not ascended, he could not have Interceded as now he does in
heaven for us. And do but take away Christ's intercession, and you starve the
hope of the Saints. For what have we to succor our selves with under the daily
surprises of sin, but this, that if any man sin, we have an Advocate [with the
Father] mark that with the Father. A friend upon the place. One that abides
there, on purpose to transact all our affairs, and as a surety for the peace
betwixt God and us. Secondly, If Christ had not ascend^d, you could not have
entered into heaven, when you die. For he went to prepare a place for you, Joh.
14.2. He was (as I said before) the first that entered into heaven directly and
in his ow^ name: and had he not done so, we could not have entered (when we die)
in his name. The forerunner made way for all that are coming on in their
several generations after him. Nor could your bodies have ascended after their
Resurrection, but in the virtue of Christ's ascension. For he ascended (as was
said before) in the capacity of our head, and representative. To his Father and
our Father. For us and himself too. Thirdly, If Christ had not ascended, he
could not have been inaugurated and installed in the glory he now enjoys in
heaven. This world is not the place where perfect felicity and glory dwells.
And then how had the promise of the Father been made good to him? Or our glory
(which consists in being with, and conformed to him) where had it been? Ought
not Christ to suffer, and to enter into his glory? Luke 24.25. Fourthly, If
Christ had not ascended, how could we have been satisfied that his payment on
the Cross made full satis^action to God? and that now God has no more Bills to
bring in against us? How is it that the spirit convinces the world of
righteousness, Ioh. 16.9, 10. But from Christ's going to the Father, and
returning hither no more; which gives evidence of Gods full content and
satisfaction both with his person and work. Fifthly, How should we have enjoyed
the great blessings of the Spirit and Ordinances, if Christ had not ascended?
And surely we could not have been without either. If Christ had not gone away,
the Comforter had not come, Joh. 16.7. He begins where Christ finished. For he
takes of his, and shows it to us, Joh. 16.14. And therefore it is said, ^oh.
7.39. The Holy Ghost was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. He was
then given as a sanctifying spirit, but not given (in that measure as afterward
he was) to furnish and qualify men with gifts, for service. And indeed by
Christ's ascension both his sanctifying and his ministering gifts, were shed
forth more commonly, and more abundantly upon men. These fell from him when he
ascended, as Eli^ahs mantle did from him, so that whatsoever good of
conversion, edification, support, or comfort you receive from spiritual
Ordinances he has shed forth that, which you now see and feel. It Is the fruit
of Christ's ascension. Sixthly, And lastly, if Christ had not ascended how had
all the Types and Prophesies that figured and foretold it been fulfilled? And
the Scriptures cannot be broken, Joh. 10.35. So that upon all these accounts it
was expedient that he should go away. It was for his glory, and for our
advantage. Though we lost the comfort of his bodily presence by it, yet if we
loved him we would rejoice because he went to the Father, Joh 14.28. We ought
to have rejoiced in his advancement, though it had been to our loss: but when
it is so much for our benefit as well as his Glory; it is matter of joy on both
sides that he is ascended to his Father, and our Father; to his God, and to our
God. From the several blessings flowing to us out of Christ's ascension, it was
that he charged his people not to be troubled at his leaving of them, Ioh. 14.
And hence learn


Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Did Christ ascend into Heaven? Is our Jesus our treasure indeed there? Where
then should the hearts of believers be, but in Heaven where their Lord their
Life is? Surely Saints it is not good that your Love, and your Lord should be
in two several Countries, said one that is now with him. Up, up, after your
Lover, that he and you may be together. Christians you ascended with him
virtually when he ascended, you shall ascend to him personally hereafter, oh
that you would ascend to him Spiritually in acts of Faith, Love and desires
daily. Sursum Corda, up with your hearts, was the form used by the Ancient
Church, at the Sacrament. How good were it if we could say with the Apostle,
Phil. 3.21. Our Conversation is in Heaven from whence we look for a Savior. An
heart ascendant, is the best evidence of your interest in Christ's ascension.

Did Christ go to Heaven as a forerunner? What haste should we make to follow
him! He ran to Heaven, he ran thither before us. Did he run to glory and shall
we linger? Did he flee as an Eagle toward Heaven, and we creep like snails?
Come Christians lay aside every weight, and the sin that does so easily beset
you, and run with patience the Race set before you, looking unto Jesus, Heb.
12.1, 2. The Captain of our Salvation is entered within the gates of the new
Jerusalem, and calls to us out of Heaven, to hasten to him; proposing the
greatest encouragements to them that are following after him, saying he that
overcomes shall sit with me in my Throne, as I also overcame, and am set down
with my Father in his Throne, Rev. 3.21. How tedious should it seem to us to
live so long at a distance from our Lord Jesus! our Life.

Inference 3.
Did Christ ascend so triumphantly, Infer. 3.
leading Captivity Captive? How little reason then have believers to fear their
conquered enemies, Sin, Satan and every enemy was in that day led away in
triumph dragged at Christ's Chariot wheels. Brought after him as it were in
Chains. It Is a lovely sight to see the necks of those Tyrants under the foot of
our Ioshuah. He made at that day an open show of them, Col. 2.15. Their
strength is broken for ever. In this he showed himself more than a conqueror;
for he conquered, and triumphed too. Satan was then trod under his feet. And he
has promised to tread him under our feet also, and that shortly, Romans 16.20.
Some power our enemies yet retain, the Serpent may bruise our heel, but Christ
has crushed his head.

Inference 4.
Did Christ ascend so munificently, Infer. 4.
shedding forth so many mercies upon his people? Mercies of inestimable value
reserved on purpose to adorn that day? O then see that you abuse not those most
precious ascension gifts of Christ, but value and improve them as the choicest
mercies. Now the Ascension gifts as I told you are either the Ordinances and
Officers of the Church (for he then gave them Pastors and Teachers) or the
Spirit that furnished the Church with all its gift. Beware you abuse not either
of these.

First, Abuse not the Ordinances and Officers of Christ. This is a sin that no
Nation is plunged deeper into the guilt of it, th^n this Nation. And no Age,
more than this. Surely God has written to us the great things of his Law, and
we have accounted them small things. We have been loose, wanton, skeptical
professors for the most part; that have had nice and coy stomachs that could
not relish plain wholesome truths; except so and so modified to our humors. For
this the Lord has a Controversy with the Nation, and by a sore Judgment he
has begun to rebuke this sin already. And I doubt before he make an end, plain
truths will down with us; and we shall bless God for them.

Secondly, But in the next place see that you abuse not the Spirit, whom Christ
has sent from Heaven at his ascension; to supply his bodily absence among us,
and is the great pledge of his care for, and tender love to his people. Now
take heed that you don't vex him by your disobedience. Nor greive him by your
unkindnesses. Nor quench him by your sinful neglects of duty, or abuse of
light. O deal kindly with the Spirit and obey his voice. Comply with his
designs, and yield up your selves to his guidance and conduct. Methinks to be
entreated, by the Love of the Spirit, Romans 15.30. Should be as great an
Argument as to be entreated for Christ's sake. Now to persuade all the Saints to
be tender of grieving the Spirit, by sin; let me urge a few Considerations,
proper to the point under hand. And Consid. 1. First, He was the first and
principal mercy that Christ received for you, at his first entrance into
Heaven. It was the first thing he asked of God, when he came to Heaven. So he
speaks, Ioh. 14.16, 17. I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter; that he may abide with you. No sooner had he set foot upon the place
but the first thing, the great thing that was upon his heart to ask the Father
for us, was that the Spirit might be forthwith dispatched, and sent down to his
people. So that the spirit is the firstborn of mercies. And deserves the first
place in our hearts, and esteems. Consid. 2. Secondly, The Spirit comes not in
his own name to us (though if so, he deserves a dear welcome for his own sake,
and for the benefits we receive by him which are inestimable) but he comes to
us in the name, and in the loves both of the Father and Son. As one authorized
and delegated by them. Bringing his Credentials under both their hands, and
seals, Ioh. 15.26. But when the Comforter is come whom I will send to you, from
the Father. Mark I will send him from the Father, and in Ioh. 14.26. The Father
is said to send him in Christ's name. So that he is the messenger that comes
from both these great and holy persons. And if you have any Love for the God
that made you, any kindness for Christ that died for you; show it by your
obedience to the Spirit that comes from them both; and in both their names to
us: and who will be both offended and grieved if you grieve him. O therefore
give him an enter^ainment worthy of one that comes to you in the name of the
Lord. In the Fathers name, and in the Sons name. Consid. 3. Thirdly, But that
is not the only consideration that should cause you to beware of grieving the
Spirit, because he is sent in the name of such great and dear persons to you;
but he deserves better entertainment than any of the Saints give him, for his
own sake, and upon his own account, and that upon a double score, viz.


Of his Nature and Office.

First, On the account of his Nature, for he is God, Coequal with the Father
and Son in Nature, and digni^y, 2 Samuel 23.23. The Spirit of the Lord spoke by
me, and his word was in my tongue; the God of Israel said; the Rock of Israel
spoke to me. So that you see he is God. The rock of Israel. God omnipotent, for
he created all things, Genesis 1.2. God omnipresent, filling all things, Psalm.
139.7. God omniscient, who knows your hearts, Romans 9.1. Beware of him
therefore, and grieve him not, for in so doing, you grieve God.

Secondly, Upon the account of his Office and the benefits we receive by him.
We are obliged even on the score of gratitude and ingenuity to obey him. For he
is sent in the quality of an Advocate, to help us to pray. To indite our
requests for us. To teach us what, and how to ask of God, Romans 8.26. He comes
to us as a Comforter, Ioh. 14.16. And none like him. His work is to take of
Christ's, Joh. 16.14.
and show it to us, (i. e.) to take of his death, Resurrection, Ascension, yea
of his very present Intercession in Heaven and show it to us. Mr T. Goodwin.
He can be with us in a moment, he can (as one well observes) tell you what
were the very last thoughts Christ was thinking in Heaven about you. Luke 1.35.
Isa. 61.1. Col. 1.19.
It was he that formed the body of Christ in the womb, and so prepared him to
be a sacrifice for us. He filled that humanity with his unexampled fullness. So
fitting and anointing him for the discharge of his Office.

It Is he tha^ pu^s efficacy into the Ordinances, 2 Cor. 9.6.
and without him they would be but a dead letter. 'Twas he that blessed them to
your conviction, Joh. 16.9 1. Pet. 1 12. 1 John 3 24. Romans 8.9.
and c^nversion. For if Angels had been the Preachers, no conversion had
followed, without the Spirit. It Is he that is the vinculum unionis bond of
union betwixt Christ and your souls; without which you could never have had
interest in Christ, Romans 8.26.
or Communion with Christ. 'Twas he that so often has helped your infirmities,
when you knew not what to say. Comforted your hearts when they were overwhelmed
within you, Joh. 14.16. Ez^k. 36.27.
and you knew not what to do. Preserved you many thousand times from sin and
ruin when you have been upon the slippery br^nk of it in temptations. It Is he
(in his sanctifying work) that is the best evidence your souls have for Heaven.
It were endless to enumerate the mercies you have by him. And now, Reader, do
thou not blush to think how unworthily thou have treated such a friend. For
which o^ all these his Offices or benefits do thou grieve and quench him? O
grieve not the holy Spirit, whom Christ sent as soon as ever he came to Heaven,
in his Fathers name, and in his own name to perform all these Offices for you.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
Is Christ ascended to the Father as our forerunner, then the door of Salvation
stands open to all believers, and by virtue of Christ's ascension; Spes futurae
nostrae haereditatis in ^a^ite nostro ple^issime confirmatur, and nos cun eo in
coelis colloca^i su^us. Synop. purioris Theo^. Disp 28 p 342.
they also shall ascend after him; far above all visible Heavens. O my friends,
what place has Christ prepared and taken up for you! What a splendid
habitation has he provided for you. God is not ashamed to be called your God,
for he has prepared for you a City, Heb. 11.16. In that City Christ has
provided mansions, (...), resting places for your everlasting abode, Ioh. 14.2.
and keeps them for you till your coming. O how August, and glorious a dwelling
is that, where Sun, Moon and Stars shall shine as much below your feet as they
are now above your heads? Yea, such is the love Christ has to the believer,
that (as one says) if thou only had been the chosen of God, Christ would
have built that house for himself and thee. Now it is for himself, for thee,
and for many more who shall inherit with thee.

God send us a joyful meeting within the vail, with our forerunner; and
sweeten our passage into it, with many a foresight, and fore-tast thereof. And
mean time let the Love of a Savior infl^me our hearts, so that when ever we
cast a look toward that place, where our forerunner is for us entered; our
souls may say with melting affections*

Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ; and again, Blessed be God for his
unspeakable Gift.
The FORTY FIRST Sermon. 41.
SERMON. Wherein Christ sitting at Gods right hand is explained and applied,
being the third step of his glorious exaltation.

HEB. I.III. part of the Verse, -- When he had by himself, purged our sins; sat
down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

CHrist being returned again to his Father, having finished his whole work on
earth, is there bid by the Father to sit down in the seat of honor, and rest.
A seat prepared for him at Gods right hand, that makes it honorable, and all
his enemies as a footstool under his feet, that makes it easy. How much is the
state and condition of Jesus Christ changed in a few days! Here he groaned,
wept, labored, suffered, sweat, yea sweat blood, and found no rest in this
world; but when he comes to Heaven, there he enters into rest. Sits down for
ever in the highest, and easiest throne prepared by the Father for him, when he
had done his work. When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down, etc.

The scope of this Epistle is to demonstrate Christ to be the fullness of all
Legal Types and Ceremonies, and that whatever light glimered to the world
through them, yet it was but as the light of the day Star, to the light of this
Sun.

In this Chapter Christ the subject of the Epistle is described, and
particularly in this third verse, he is described three ways.

First, By his Essential, and primaeval glory and dignity he is (...), Ratio
appellationis primaria est respectu ^atris coelestis a quo ab aeterno, per
ineffabilem generationem instar luminis, de lumi^e resplenduit, secundaria
respectu hominem, etc. Glass. Rhet. p. 175.
the brightness of his Fathers glory, the very splendour of glory, the very
refulgency of that Son of glory. The primary reason of that appellation is with
respect to his eternal and ineffable generation, light of light, as the Nicene
Creed expresses it. As a beam of light proceeding from the Sun. And the
secondary reason of it is with respect to men, for look as the Sun communicates
its light and influence to us by its beams, which it projects; so does God
communicate his goodness, and manifest himself to us by Christ. Yea, he is the
express Image, or Character of his person. Not as the impressed Image of the
Seal upon the Wax, but as the engraving in the Seal it self. Thus he is
described by his essential glory. (...) insculpere dicitur, non tam imaginem ex
sigillo cerae impressam, quam ips^m sigill^m denotare. Glass. Rhet. sac. p. 159.
Secondly, He is described by the work he wrought here on earth in his humbled
state, and it was a glorious work, and that wrought out by his own single hand,
when he had by himself purged our sins. A work that all the Angels in Heaven
could not do, but Christ did it. Thirdly, and Lastly, He is described by his
glory the which (as a reward of that work) he now enjoys in Heaven. When he had
by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high, (i, e.) the Lord clothed him with the greatest power, and highest
honor, that Heaven it self could afford; for so much this phrase of sitting
down on the right hand of Majesty imports, as will appear in the explication of
this point, which is the result of this clause, viz.
DOCT. That when our Lord Jesus Christ had finished his work on earth, Doct.
he was placed in the seat of the highest honor, and authority; at the right
hand of God in Heaven.
This truth is transformingly glorious, Stephen had but a glimpse of Christ at
his Fathers right hand, and it caused his face to shine, as it had been the
face of an Angel, Act. 7.56. this his high advancement was foretold and
promised before the work of redemption was taken in hand, Psalm. 110.1. The Lord
said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
footstool. And this promise was punctually performed to Christ after his
resurrection and ascension, in his supreme exaltation far above all created
beings in Heaven and earth. Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22. We shall here open two things
in the doctrinal part, viz. what is meant by Gods right hand, and what is
implied in Christ's sitting there, with his enemies for a footstool.

First, D^x^ram Patris nominamus gloriam and honorem d^itatis, in qua, cum
filius Dei a^te secula extiterit, tanquam Deus in ex^^l^is; Patri
^onsubstantialis, postremis temporibus incarnatus; etiam cum cor^ore consedit.
Damasc Lib. 4 c. 2. de orch. ^ide.
What are we to understand here by Gods right hand? It Is obvious enough, that
the expression is not proper, but figurative, and borrowed. God has no hand,
right or left; but it is a condescending expression wherein God stoops to the
Creatures understanding; and by it he would have us to understand honor, power
and nearness,

First, The right hand is the hand of honor, the upper hand, where we place
those whom we highly esteem and honor. So Solomon placed his Mother in a seat,
at his right hand, 1 King. 2.19. So in token of honor God sets Christ at his
right hand; which on that account in the Text is called the right hand of
Majesty. God has therein expressed more favor, delight and honor to Jesus
Christ, than ever he did to any creature. To which of the Angels said he at any
time, sit thou on my right hand? Heb. 1.13.

Secondly, The right hand is the hand of power: we call it the weapon hand, and
the working hand. And the setting of Christ there, imports his exaltation to
the highest authority, and most supreme dominion. Not that God the Father has
put himself out of his Authority, and advanced Christ above himself; no, for in
that he says he has put all things under him, it is manifest, that he is
excepted which did put all things under him, 1 Cor. 15.27. But to sit as an
enthroned King, at Gods right hand, imports power. Yea, the most sovereign and
supreme power: and so Christ himself calls the right hand at which he sits,
Matthew. 26.64. hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand
of power.

Thirdly, And as it signifies honor and power, so nearness in place, as we use
to say at ones elbow, and so it is applied to Christ, in Psalm. 110.5. The Lord
at thy right hand, shall strike through Kings in the day of his wrath; that is,
the Lord who is very near thee, present with thee, he shall subdue thine
enemies. This is that then we are to understand by Gods right hand. Honor,
power and nearness.

Secondly, In the next place let us see what is implied in Christ sitting at
Gods right hand, with his enemies for his footstool. And if we attently
consider, we shall find that it implies and imports diverse great and weighty
things in it. As, First, It implies the Complement and Perfection of Christ's
work, that he came into the world about. After his work was ended, then he sat
down and rested from those labors, Heb. 10.11.12. Every Priest stands daily
ministering, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices; which can never take
away sins; but this man when he had once offered one sacrifice for sins, for
ever sat down on the right hand of God. Here he assigns a double difference
betwixt Christ and the Levitical Priests; they stand, which is the posture of
Servants; he sits, which is the posture of a Lord. They stand daily, because
their sacrifices cannot take away sin; he did his work fully, by one offering;
and after that sits, or rests for ever in Heaven. Dr. Edw. Reynolds in Psalm.
110. p. 35, 36.
And this (as accurate and judicious Dr. Reynolds observes) was excellently
figured to us in the Ark. which was a lively Type of Jesus Christ, and
particularly in this, it had rings by which it was carried up and down, till at
last it rested in Solomon's Temple, with glorious and Triumphal sollemnity,
Psalm. 132, 8, 9. 2 Chronicles. 5.13. So Christ, while he was here on earth, being
anointed with the Holy Ghost and wisdom, went about doing good, Act. 10.38. and
having ceased from his works, did at last enter into his rest, Heb. 5.10. which
is the heavenly Temple, Rev. 11.19. Secondly, Sedent quia labor quiescunt, and
ab eo r^creunt se. G^n. 18 1. quo sensu quidam a^cipiunt quod de Christo
dicitur. Sedere ad dextr^m Dei, (i. e.) in Coelis apud Deum in aeterna illa
beatitudine quiescere a laboribus ac miseriis quibus sese ultro pro nobis
subjecerat. Rav. in verbum sedere.
His sitting down at Gods right hand, notes the high content and satisfaction
of God the Father in him, and in his work. The Lord said to my Lord sit thou at
my right hand, the words are brought in as the words of the Father, welcoming
Christ to Heaven; and (as it were) congratulating the happy accomplishment of
his most difficult work. And it is as if he had said, O my Son, what shall be
done for thee this day? thou have finished a great work, and in all the parts
of it acquitted thy self as an able and faithful servant to me; what honors
shall I now bestow upon thee? the highest glory in Heaven, is not too high for
thee; come, sit at my right hand. O how well is he pleased with Christ, and
what he has done! He delighted greatly to behold him here at his work on
earth, and by a voice from the excellent glory he told him so, when he called
out of Heaven to him saying, Thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,
2 Pet. 1.17. and himself tells us, Joh. 10.17. therefore does my Father love
me, because I lay down my life, etc. for it was a work that the heart of God
had been upon from eternity. He took infinite delight in it. Thirdly, Christ's
sitting down at Gods right hand in Heaven, notes the advancement of Christ's
humane nature to the highest honor; even to be the object of adoration to
Angels and men. For it is properly his humane nature that is the subject of all
this honor, and advancement; and being advanced to the right hand of majesty,
it is become an object of worship and adoration. Not simply as it is flesh and
blood, but as it is personally united to the second person, and enthroned in
the supreme glory of Heaven. O here is the mystery, that flesh and blood should
ever be advanced to the highest throne of Majesty, and being there installed in
that glory, we may now direct our worship to him as God-man; and to this end
was his humanity so advanced, that it might be adored and worshipped by all.
The Father has committed all Judgment to the Son, that all men should honor
the Son, even as they honor the Father. And the Father will accept of no
honor divided from his honor. Therefore it is added in the next clause, he
that honors not the Son, honors not the Father which has sent him, Joh.
5.22, 23. Hence the Apostles in the salutations of their Epistles, beg for
grace mercy and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ: and in
their valedictions, they desire the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to the
Churches. Fourthly, It imports the sovereignty and supremacy of Christ over
all. The investiture of Christ with authority over the Empire of both worlds:
For this belongs to him that sits down upon this throne. When the Father said
to him sit at my right hand, he did therein deliver to him the dispensation and
economy of the Kingdom. Significat erg^ haec sessio Christi ad dextra^ patris,
no^ proprie gloriam illam, and regnum natural, quod filio Dei cum Patre ab
aeterno fuit commu^e; hoc e^im pac^o etia^ spiritus sanctus ad dextram Dei
sedet; sed regnum oeconomicu^ and voluntarium, in quo tanquam (...) and
mediator n^ster, ad ecclesiae s^ae collectionem ac defensio^em a Patre est
constitutus. Synops pur. Thol. Disp. 23. p. 343.
Put the awful scepter of government into his hand, and so the Apostle
interprets and understands it, 1 Cor. 15.25. He must reign, till he have put
all his enemies under his feet. And to th^s purpose the same Apostle
accommodates, (if not expounds) the words of the Psalmist, thou made him a
little lower than the Angels, (i. e.) in respect of his humbled state on earth,
thou Crownnedst him with glory and honor, and did set him over the work of
thy hands, thou have put all things in subjection under his feet, Heb. 2.7, 8.
He is over the spiritual Kingdom, the Church, absolute Lord there, Matthew.
28.18, 19, 20. He also is Lord over the providential Kingdom the whole world,
Psalm. 110.2. and this providential Kingdom, being subordinate to his spiritual
Kingdom; he orders and rules this, for the advantage and benefit of that,
Ephesians. 1.22. Fifthly, To sit at Gods right hand with his enemies for a
footstool, implies Christ to be a Conqueror over all his enemies. To have ones
enemies under his feet, notes perfect conquest, and complete victory. Aurel
Vict. Qui Constanti^i toties perteruit u^bem; sub Tamberlano sella Canis quae
fuit.
As when Iosuah set his foot upon the necks of the Kings: So Tamberline made
proud Bajazet his footstool. They trampled his name, and his Saints under their
feet; and Christ will tread them under his feet. It Is true indeed, this victory
is yet incomplete, and inconsummate; for now we see not yet all things put
under him, (says the Apostle) but we see Jesus Crowned with glory and honor,
and that is enough. Enough to show the power of his enemies is now broken, and
though they make some opposition still, yet it is to no purpose at all; for he
is so infinitely above them, that they must fall before him.

It is not with Christ as it was with Abi^ah against whom Jeroboam prevailed
because he was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them. His
incapacity and weakness gave the watchful enemy an advantage over him. I say
it is not so with Christ, he is at Gods right hand. And all the power of God
stands ready bent to strike through his enemies, as it is, Psalm. 110.5.

Sixthly, Christ's sitting in Heaven notes to us the great and wonderful change
that is made upon the state and condition of Christ, since his ascension into
Heaven. Ah it is far otherwise with him now, Mr. Tho. Case his Pisgah part 3. p.
21.
than it was in the days of his humiliation here on earth. quantum mutatus ab
illo! Oh what a wonderful change has Heaven made upon him! It were good (as a
Worthy of ours speaks) to compare in our thoughts the Abasement of Christ, and
his Exaltation together; as it were in Columes, one over against the other: he
was born in a Stable, but now he raigns in his Royal Palace. Then he had a
Manger for his Cradle, but now he sits on a Chair of State. Then Oxen and Asses
were his companions, now thousands of Saints, and ten thousand of Angels
minister round about his throne. Then in contempt they called him the
Carpenters Son, now he obtains by inheritance a more excellent name than
Angels. Then he was led away into the Wilderness to be tempted of the Devil,
now it is proclaimed before him, let all the Angels of God worship him. Then he
had not a place to lay his head on, now he is exalted to be heir of all things.
In his state of Humiliation he endured the contradiction of sinners, in his
state of Exaltation he is adored and admired of Saints and Angels. Then he had
no form nor comeliness, and when we saw him, there was no beauty why we should
desire him; now the beauty of his countenance shall send forth such glorious
beams, that shall dazel the eyes of all the Celestial inhabitants round about
him, etc.


O what a change is here! Here he sweat, but there he sits. Here he groaned,
but there he triumphs. Here he lay upon the ground, there he sits in the throne
of glory. When he came to Heaven, his Father did as it were thus bespeak him.

My dear Son, what an hard travail have thou had of it? What a world of woe have
thou past through, in the strength of thy love to me, and mine Elect? Thou has^
been hungry, thirsty and weary; scourged, crucified and reproached: ah what bad
usage has thou had in the ungrateful world! Not a days rest and comfort since
thou wentest out from me: but now thy suffering days are accomplished, now thy
rest is come, rest for evermore. Henceforth sit at my right hand. Henceforth
thou shall groan, weep, or bleed no more. Sit thou at my right hand.

Seventhly, Christ's sitting at Gods right hand, implies the advancement of
believers to the highest honor: For this session of Christ's, respects them;
and there he sits as our representative, in which regard we are made to sit
with him in heavenly places, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 2.6. How secure may
we be (says Tertullian) who do now already possess the Kingdom? meaning in our
head Christ. This (says another) is all my hope and all my confidence, namely,
that we have a portion in that flesh and blood of Christ which is so exalted,
and therefore where he reigns we shall reign; where our flesh is glorified, we
shall be glorified. Surely, it is matter of exceeding joy, to believe that
Christ our head, our flesh and blood, is in all this glory at his Fathers right
hand. Thus we have opened the sense and importance of Christ's si^ting at his
Fathers right hand. Hence we Infer.

Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Is this so great an honor to Christ, to sit enthroned at Gods right hand? What
honor then is reserved in Heaven for those that are faithful to Christ now on
the earth! Christ prayed, and his prayer was heard, Joh. 17.24. That we may be
with him, to behold the glory that God has given him; and what heart can
conceive the felicity of such a sight? it made Stephens face shine as the face
of an Angel, when he had but a glimpse of Christ at his Fathers right hand.
Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty, Isai. 33.17. which respected
Hezekiah in the Type, Christ in the truth. But, this is not all, though this be
much, to be spectators of Christ in his Throne of glory: we shall not only see
him in his Throne, but also sit with him inthroned in glory. To behold him is
much, but to sit with him is more. I remember it was the saying of a heavenly
Christian, now with Christ, I would far rather look but through the hole of
Christ's door, to see but the one half of his fairest and most comely face, [for
he looks like Heaven] suppose I should never win in, to see his excellency and
glory to the full; than to enjoy the flower, the bloom and chiefest excellency
of the glory and riches of ten worlds. And you know how the Queen of the South
fainted at the sight of Solomon in his glory. But this sight you shall have of
Christ, will change you into his likeness. We shall be like him, (says the
Apostle) for we shall see him as he is, 1 John 3.2. He will place us as it were
in his own throne with him. So runs the promise, Rev. 3.21. To him that
overcomes, I will grant to sit with me in my throne; even as I also overcame,
and am set down with my Father in his throne: and so 2 Timothy 2.12. If we suffer
with him, we shall also reign with him. The Father set Christ on his right
hand, and Christ will set the Saints on his right hand. So you know the sheep
are placed by the Angels, at the great day. Matthew. 25. and so the Church under
the figure of the daughter of Egypt whom Solomon married; is placed on the
Kings right hand, in God of Ophyr, Psalm. 45. This honor have all the Saints. O
amazing Love. What, we set on thrones, while as good as we by nature howl in
flames! O what manner of love is this! These expressions indeed do not intend,
that the Saints shall be set in higher glory than Christ; or that they shall
have a parity of glory with Christ; for in all things he must have the
pre-eminence: but they note the great honor that Christ will put upon the
Saints; as also, that his glory shall be their glory in Heaven. Uxor
splendiscit in radiis Mariti.
As the glory of the Husband redounds to the Wife; and again, their glory will
be his glory. 2 These. 1.10. And so it will be a social glory. O it is admirable
to think whither free grace has already mounted up poor dust and ashes!

To think how nearly we are related now to this Royal princely Jesus! but how
much higher are the designs of grace that are not yet come to their parturient
fullness, they look beyond all this that we now know! Now are we the Sons of
God, but it does not yet appear what we shall be, 1 John 3.2. Ah what reason
have you to honor Christ on earth, who is preparing such honors for you in
Heaven!

then how impossible is it, that ever his interest should miscarry or sink on
earth? The Church has many subtle and potent enemies. True, but as Haman could
not prevail against the Jews whilst Hester their friend spoke for them to the
King; no more can they, whilst our Jesus sits at his, and our Fathers right
hand. Will he suffer his enemies that are under his feet, to rise up and pull
out his eyes think you? Surely they that touch his people, touch the very Apple
of his eye, Zech. 2.8. He must reign till all his enemies are under his foot, 1
Cor. 15.25. The enemy under his feet, shall not destroy the children in his
arms. He sits in Heaven on purpose to manage all to the advantage of his
Church, Ephesians. 1.22. Are our enemies powerful, lo our King sits on the right hand
of power. Are they subtle and deep in their contrivance, he that sits on the
Throne over-looks all they do. Heaven over-looks Hell. He that sits in the
Heavens beholds, and derides their attempts, Psalm 2.4. He may permit his
enemies to straighten them in one place, but it shall be for their enlargement
in another. For it is with the Church, as it is with the Sea; what it loses in
one place, it gets in another; and so really loses nothing. He may suffer them
also to distress us in outward, but that shall be recompensed with inward, and
better mercies; and so we shall lose nothing by that. A footstool you know is
u^eful to him that treads on it, and serves to lift him up the higher: so shall
Christ's enemies be to him, and his; albeit they think not so. What singular
benefits the oppositions of his enemies, occasion to his people; I have A Saint
indeed. p. 64, 65, 66.

Inference 3.
Infer. 3.
Is Christ set down on the right hand of the Majesty in Heaven, O with what
awful reverence should we approach him in the duties of his Worship! Away with
light and low thoughts of Christ. Away with formal irreverent, and careless
frames in Praying, Hearing, Receiving, yea, in conferring and speaking of
Christ. Away with all deadness, and drowsiness in duties, For he is a great
King with whom you have to do. A King to whom the Kings of the earth are but as
little bits of clay. Lo the Angels cover their faces in his presence. He is an
Adorable Majesty.

When John had a vision of this inthroned King, about sixty year after his
ascension; such was the over-powering glory of Christ, as the Sun when it
shines in its strength; that when he saw him, he fell at his feet as dead, and
died it is like he had, if Christ had not not laid his hand on him and said,
fear not, I am the first and the last; I am he that lives, and was dead, and
behold I am alive for evermore, Rev. 1.17, 18. When he appeared to Saul in the
way to Damascus, it was in glory above the glory of the Sun, which over powered
him also, and laid him as one dead upon the ground.

O that you did but know what a glorious Lord you Worship and Serve. Who makes
the very place of his Feet glorious, where ever he comes. Surely He is greatly
to be feared in the assembly of his Saints, and to be had in reverence of all
that are round about him. There is indeed a (...) boldness or free liberty of
speech allowed to the Saints, Ephesians. 3.12. But no rudeness, or irreverence. We
may indeed come as the Children of a King come to the Father, who is both their
awful sovereign, and tender Father; which double relation causes a due mixture
of love and reverence in their hearts, when they come before him. You may be
Free, but not Rude in his presence. Though he be your Father, Brother, Friend;
yet the distance betwixt him and you is infinite.

If Christ be so gloriously advanced in the highest Throne, Infer. 4.
then none need to reckon themselves dishonored, Non ignomi^iosum est nobis
pati, quod Christus passus est; nec vobis gloriosum facere quod fecit Judas.
Hierony. Dr. Manton on Jam. p. 228.
by suffering the vilest things for his sake. The very chains and sufferings of
Christ have a glory in them. Hence Moses esteemed the very reproaches of
Christ, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, Heb. 11.26. He saw such an
excellency in the very worst things of Christ, his reproaches, and sufferings,
as made him leap out of his Honors and Riches into them. He did not (as one
says) only endure the reproaches of Christ, but counted them Treasures. To be
reckoned among his honors, and things of value. Curet non me quoque torque
donas? Et insignis hujus o^di^is militem cre^s? Thuan. Hist.
So Thuanus reports of Ludovicus Marsacus, a noble Knight of France, when he
was led with other Martyrs, that were bound with Cords, to Execution; and he
for his dignity was not bound, he cried, give me my Chain too, let me be a
Knight of the same order. Disgrace it self is honorable, when it is endured for
the Lord of glory. And surely there is (as one phraseth it) a little Paradise,
a young Heaven in sufferings for Christ. If there were nothing else in it, but
that they are endured on his account, it would richly reward all we can endure
for him: but if we consider how exceeding kind Christ is to them that count it
their glory to be abased for him; that though he be always kind to his people,
(yet if we may so speak) he overcomes himself in kindness, when they suffer
for him: it should make men in Love with his reproaches.

Inference 5.
Infer. 5.
If Christ sat not down to rest in Heaven, till he had finished his work on
earth; then it is in vain for us to think of rest, till we have finished our
work, as Christ also did his.

How willing are we to find rest here! To dream of that which Christ never
found in this world, nor any ever found before us. O think not of resting, till
you have done working, and done sinning. Your life and your labors must end
together. Write (says the Spirit) blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord,
for they rest from their labors, Rev. 14.13. Here you must have the Sweat, and
there the Sweet. It Is too much to have two Heavens. Here you must be content to
dwell in the Tents of Keder, hereafter you shall be within the curtains of
Solomon. Heaven is the place of which it may be truly said, That there the
weary be at rest. O think not of sitting down on this side Heaven. There are
four things will keep the Saints from sitting down on earth, to rest. viz.
Grace, Corruptions, Devils, and wicked men.

First, Grace will not suffer you to rest here. Its tendencies are beyond this
world. It will be looking and longing for the blessed hope. A gracious person
takes himself for a Pilgrim, seeking a better Country and is always suspicious
of danger in every place and state. It Is still beating up the sluggish heart
with such language as that, Mica. 2.10. Arise, depart, this is not thy rest,
for it is polluted. Its farther tendencies and continual Jealousies will keep
you from sitting long still in this world.

Secondly, Your Corruptions will keep you from rest here. They will continually
exercise your Spirits, and keep you upon your watch. Saints have their hands
filled with work by their own hearts every day. Sometimes to prevent sin, and
sometimes to lament it. And allwaies to watch and fear, to mortify and kill
it. Sin will not long suffer you to be quiet, Romans 7.21, 22, 23, 24. And if a
bad heart will not break your rest here, then

Thirdly, There is a busy Devil will do it. He will find you work enough with
his Temptations, and suggestions, and except you can sleep quietly in his arms,
as the wicked do, there is no rest to be expected. Your adversary the Devil
goes about as a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist, 1 Pet.
5.8.

Fourthly, Nor will his Servants, and instruments let you be quiet on this side
Heaven. Their very name speaks their turbulent disposition. (...) I^qui^tum
esse. Turbulentus.
My Soul (says the holy man) is among Lions, and I lie even among them that
are set on fire, even the Sons of men, whose teeth are Spears and Arrows, Psalm.
57.4. Well then, be content to enter into your rest, as Christ did into his. He
sweat, then sat, and so must you.

Sermon. 42.
The FORTY SECOND SERMON. Wherein Christ's coming to Judgment being the fourth
and last degree of his Exaltation is opened and improved.

ACT. X.XLII. And he commanded us to Preach unto the people, and to testify,
that it is he which was ordained of God, to be the Judge of quick and dead.


CHrist enthroned in the highest glory in Heaven is there to abide for the
effectual and successful government both of the World and of the Church, until
the number given him by the Father before the World was, and purchased by the
blood of the Cross be gathered in; and then comes the Judgment of the great
day, which will perfectly separate the precious from the vile; put the redeemed
in full possession of the purchase of his blood in Heaven, and then shall he
deliver up the Kingdom to his Father, that God may be all in all.

This last act of Christ, namely his Judging the world is a special part of his
Exaltation and honor, bestowed upon him because he is the Son of man, Joh.
5.27. In that day shall his glory as King, and absolute Lord, shine forth as
the Sun when it shines in its strength. O what an honor will it be to the man
Christ Jesus, Ad reglam dignitatem pertinet illa potestas qua Christus factus
est judex omni^m hominum and angelorum. Ames. med. p. 117.
who stood arraigned and condemned at Pilates bar; to sit upon the great white
Throne, surrounded with thousands and ten thousands of Angels! Men and Devils
waiting upon him to receive their final Sentence from his mouth. In this will
the glory of Christ's Sovereignty and power be eminently and illustriously
displayed, before Angels and men. And this is that great truth, which He
commanded to be Preached and testified to the people; namely, that it is he
which is ordained of God, to be the Judge of quick and dead.

Wherein we have four things to be distinctly considered, viz. The Subject,
Object, Fountain, and Truth of this supreme judiciary authority.

First, The Subject of it, Christ. It is he that i^ ordained to be Judgment is
the act of the whole undivided Trinity. The Father and Spirit Judge as well as
Christ in respect of authority and consent, but it is the act of Christ in
respect of visible management, and execution and so it is his per proprietatem,
by propriety the Father having conferred it upon him, as the Son of man; but
not his per appropriationem, so as to exclude either the Father or Spirit from
their authority, for they Judge by him.

Secondly, The Object of Christ's Judiciary authority. The quick and dead, (i.
e.) all that at his coming do live, or ever had lived. This is the Object
personal. All the men and women that ever sprang from Adam, all the Apostate
Spirits that fell from Heaven, and are reserved in chains to the Judgment of
this great day. And in this personal object, is included the real object, viz.
all the actions both secret and open that ever they did, 2 Cor. 5.5. Romans 2.16.

Thirdly, The Fountain of this delegated authority, which is (...) Definitus
seu constitutus.
for he has ordained Christ to be the Judge. He is appointed, sc. as the Son
of man to this honorable office and work. The word notes a firm establishment
of Christ in that office by his Father. He is now by right of redemption, Lord
and King. He enacts Laws for government, then he comes to Judge of men's
obedience and disobedience to his Laws.

Fourthly, And lastly, here is the infallible Truth or unquestionable He gave
us Commandment to Preach, and testify it to the people. We had it in charge
from his own mouth; and dare not hide it. Hence the point of Doctrine is
plainly this.

DOCT. That our Lord Jesus Christ is ordained by God the Father, Doct.
to be the Judge of quick and Dead.
This truth stands upon the firm basis of Scripture authority. You have it from
his own hand, Ioh. 5.22. The Father judges no man, but has committed all
Judgment to the Son, viz. in the sense before given. And so the Apostle, Act.
17.31. He has appointed a day in the which he will Judge the world in
righteousness, by the man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given
assurance, etc. And again, Romans 2.16. In the day when God shall Judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ. Three things will be opened here. First, the
certainty of a Judgment to come. Secondly, the quality, and nature of it.
Thirdly, that it is a special part of Christ's Exaltation to be appointed Judge
in this day.

The Certainty of a Judgment.
First, The certainty of a Judgment. This is a truth of firmer establishment
than Heaven and Earth. It Is no devised fable, no cunning artifice to keep the
world in awe; but a thing as confessedly true, as it is awfully solemn. For

First, As the Scriptures forementioned (with these, 2 Cor. 5.10. Eccles.
12.14. Matthew. 12.36. and many other the true and faithful sayings of God,) do
very plainly reveal it: so the Justice and righteousness of God require it
should be so. For the Judge of all the earth will do right, Genesis 18.25. Now
righteousness it self requires that a difference be made betwixt the righteous,
and the wicked, Say ye to the righteous it shall be well with him, woe to the
wicked, it shall be ill with him, Isa. 3.10. But no such distinction is
generally and fully made betwixt one another in this world. Yea, rather the
wicked prosper, and the righteous perish, There is a just man that perishes in
his righteousness, and there is a wicked man, Per sive propter justitiam suam,
in saepe valet pro. Poli Synop. in loc.
that prolongeth his life in his wickedness, Eccles. 7.15. Yea, not only in,
but for his righteousness as it may be fairly rendered.

Here the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than himself, Hab.
1.14. As the fishes of the Sea, where the great and strong swallow up the small
and weak. And even in Courts of Judicature, where the innocent might expect
relief; there they often meet with the worst oppressions. How fairly and justly
therefore does the wise man infer a Judgment to come from this consideration?
In tanta injuria confugi ad Dei Iudicium in quo pronunciabit qui sunt justi,
qui sontes. Drusius.

Hoc malo remedium opposui. Merc.

Contra illum i^justitiam consolabar me hac cogitatione quod Deus omnes
Iudicaret. Geirus.

Si nullum pecatum manifesta plecteretur poena; nullum esse divinam
providentiam cred^retur. Rursum si omne peccatum apperte p^niret, nullum fore
Iudicium crederetur. Aug.


Eccles. 3.16, 17. I saw under the Sun the place of Judgment, that wickedness
was there, and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there; I said in
my heart, God shall Judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time
there for every purpose, and for every work, q. d. the Judgment to come is the
only relief and support left to poor innocents, to quiet and Comfort themselves
withal. To the same purpose also is that, Iam. 5.6, 7. Ye have condemned, and
killed the Just; and he does not resist you; be patient therefore brethren,
unto the coming of the Lord. It is confessed, that sometimes God vindicates his
providence against the Atheism of the world, by particular strokes upon the
wicked; but this is but rare. And as the Father well observes, if no sin were
punished here, no providence would be believed; again, if every sin were openly
punished here, no Judgment hereafter could be expected. Besides,

Secondly, Man is a reasonable being, and every reasonable being, is an
accountable being. He is a capable subject of moral government. His actions
have relation to a Law. He is swayd by rewards and punishments. He acts by
counsel and therefore of his actions he must expect to give an account, as it
is Romans 14.12. So then every one of us, shall give an account of himself to
God. Especially if we add, that all the gifts of body, mind, estate, time, etc.
are so many Talents, concredited and betrusted to him by God, and every one
has one Talent at least; therefore a time to render an account for all these
Talents will come, Matthew. 25.14, 15. We are but Stewards, and Stewards must
give an account, in order whereto, there must be a great audit day.

Thirdly, And what need we seek evidence of this truth, further than our own
conscience? Lo, it is a truth engraven legibly upon every man's own breast.
Every one has a kind of little Tribunal, or privy Sessions in his own
conscience, which both accuses, and excuses, for good, and evil; which it could
never do, were there not a future Judgment of which it is now conscious to it
self. In this Court Records are now kept of all that we do, even of our secret
actions, and thoughts, which never yet took air; but if no Judgment, what need
of Records? Nor let any imagine, that that this may be but the fruit of
education and discourse. We have heard of such things, and so are scared by
them. For if so, how comes it to obtain so universally? Who could be the Author
of such a common deception?

Mr. Howes blessedness of the right. p. 343.
Reader, bethink thy self a little; if thou had a mind (as one says) to
impose a lie upon all the world, what course would thou take? How would
thou lay the design? or why do thou in this case imagine, what thou know
not how to imagine? It Is evident that the very consciences of the Heathens,
have these offices of accusing and excusing, Romans 2.15. And it is hard to
imagine (as an ingenious Author speaks) that a general Cheat should bow down
the backs of all mankind, Sr. Charles Wo^sely Unreasonableness of Atheism p. 76.
and induce so many doubts and fears, and troubles amongst them; and give an
interruption to the whole course of their corrupt living, and that there should
be no account of it? And therefore it is undoubted that such a day will come.
But I shall rather choose in the

The quali^y of the Judgment.
Second place, to open the nature and manner of this Judgment, than to spend
more time in proving a truth, that cannot be denied without violence offered to
a man's own light. If then the question be, what manner of Judgment will this
be? I answer,

First, It will be a great and awful day, It Is called the Judgment of the
great day, Jud. 6. Three things will make it so, the manner of Christ's coming.
The work he comes about. And the issues or events of that work. The manner of
Christ's coming will be awfully solemn, For the Lord himself shall descend from
Heaven with a shout, with the Trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
first. Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught together with them
in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, etc. 1 These. 4.16.17. Here Christ
breaks out of Heaven with the shouts of Angels (...), it signifies such a shout
(says one) as is to be heard among Seamen, ^ase his Pisgah.
when after a long and dangerous voyage they first discry Land; crying with
loud and united voices, A shore, A shore. As the Poet describes the Italians
when they saw their native Country, lifted up their voices, and making the
Heavens ring again with Italy, Italiam, Italiam laeto clamore sal^ant Virgil.
Aenid.
Italy; or as Armies shout when the signal of Battle is given. Above all which
(as some expound it) shall the voice of the Archangel be distinctly heard. And
after this shout, the trump of God shall sound. By this Tremendous blast,
sinners will be affrighted out of their Graves, but to the Saints it will carry
no more terror than the roaring of Cannons, when Armies of friends approach a
besieged City, for the relief of them that be within. The dead being raised,
they shall be gathered before the great Throne on which Christ shall sit in his
glory; and there divided exactly to the right and left hand of Christ, by the
Angels. Here will be the greatest Assembly that ever met. Where Adam may see
his numerous offspring, even as the sand upon the Seashore which no man can
number. And never was there such a perfect division made (how many divisions
soever have been in the world) none was ever like it. The Saints in this great
Ecumenical assize (as the same Author styles it) shall meet the Lord in the
air, and there the Judge shall sit upon the Throne; and all the Saints shall be
placed upon bright clouds, as on Seats or Scaffolds round about him; the wicked
remaining below upon the earth, there to receive their final doom and sentence.

These preparatives will make it awful. And much more will the work it self
that Christ comes about make it so. For it is to Judge the secrets of men, Romans
2.16. To sever the Tares from the Wheat. To make every man's whites and blacks
appear. And according as they are found in that Trial, to be sentenced to their
everlasting and immutable state. O what a solemn thing is this!

And no less will the execution of the Sentence on both parts, make it a great
and solemn day. The heart of man cannot conceive what impressions the voice of
Christ from the Throne will make, both upon believers, and unbelievers.

Imagine Christ upon his glorious Throne, surrounded with Myriads and Legions
of Angels, his Royal guard; a poor unbeliever trembling at the Bar. An exact
scrutiny made into his heart and life. The dreadful Sentence given. And then a
cry. And then his delivering them over to the Executioners of Eternal
vengeance, never, never to see a glimpse of hope or mercy any more.

Imagine Christ like the General of an Army, mentioning with honor in the head
of all the hosts of Heaven and Earth, all the services that the Saints have
done for him in this world. Then sententially justifying them, by open
proclamation. Then mounting with him to the third Heavens, and entering the
gates of that City of God, in that noble train of Saints and Angels intermixed.
And so for ever to be with the Lord. O what a great day must this be!

Secondly, As it will be an awful and solemn Judgment, so it will be a
Critical and Exact Judgment. Every man will be weighed to his ounces and
drams. The name of the Judge is (...) the searcher of hearts. The Judge has
eyes as flames of fire, which pierce to the dividing of the heart and reins.
It Is said, Matthew. 12.36. That men shall then give an account of every idle word
that they shall speak. It is a day that will perfectly fan the world. No
Hypocrite can escape. Justice holds the balances in an even hand. Christ will
go to work so exactly, that some Divines of good note, think the day of
Judgment will last as long as this day of the Gospels administration has or
shall last.

Thirdly, It will be a Universal Judgment, 2 Cor. 5.10. We must all appear
before the Judgment Seat of Christ. And Romans 14.12. Every one of us shall give
an account of himself to God. Those that were under the Law, and those that
having no Law, were a Law to themselves, Romans 2.12. Those that had many
Talents, and he that had but one Talent, must appear at this Bar; those that
were carried from the Cradle to the Grave, with him that stooped for Age. The
rich, and poor; the Father and the Child; the Master, and the Servant; the
believer, and unbeliever must stand forth in that day. I saw the Dead both
small and great stand before God, and the Books were opened, Rev. 20.12.

Fourthly, It will be a Judgment full of convictive clearness. All things will
be so sifted to the bran (as we say) that the Sentence of Christ both on Saints
and sinners shall be applauded. Righteous art thou O Lord because thou have
Judged thus. His Judgments will be as the light that goes forth. So that
those poor sinners whom he will condemn, shall be first (...) self condemned.
Their own consciences shall be forced to confess, that there is not one drop of
injustice in all that Sea of wrath, into which they are to be cast.

Fifthly, And lastly, It will be a supreme and final Judgment, from which lies
no Appeal. For it is the Sentence of the Highest, and only Lord. For as the
ultimate resolution of Faith is into the Word, and truth of God; Ad Dei verbum
fit ultima resolutio fidei, ad Dei tribunal ultima resolutio judicii.
so the ultimate resolution of Justice is into the Judgment of God. This
Judgment is supreme and imperial. For Christ is the only potentate, 1 Timothy
6.5. And therefore the Sentence once past, its execution is infallible. And so
you find it in that judicial process, Matthew. 25. ult. Just after the Sentence
is pronounced by Christ, it is immediately added, those shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into Life Eternal. This is the
Judgment of the great day.

Thirdly, In the last place, I must inform you that God in ordaining That this
Judgment makes for Christ's Honor.
has very highly exalted him. This will be very much for his honor. For in
this Christ's Royal dignity will be illustrated beyond what ever it was since he
took our nature, till that day. Now he will appear in his glory. For First,
This act of Judging pertaining properly to the Kingly Office, Christ will be
glorified as much in his Kingly Office, as he has been in either of the other.
We find but some few glimpses of his Kingly Office, breaking forth in this
world; as his riding with Hosannahs into Jerusalem. His whipping the buyers and
sellers out of the Temple. His Title upon the Cross, etc. But these were but
faint beams: now that Office will shine in its glory, as the Sun in the midst
of the Heavens. For what were the Hosannahs of little Children, in the streets
of Jerusalem, to the shouts and acclamations of thousands of Angels, and ten
thousands of Saints? What was his whipping the profane out of the Temple, to
his turning the wicked into Hell; and sending his Angels to gather out of his
Kingdom every thing that offends? What was a Title written by his Judge, and
fixed on the ignominous Tree, to the name that shall be now seen on his
Vesture, and on his Thigh; Lord of Lords, and King of Kings? Secondly, This
will be a display of his glory in the highest, before the whole world. For
there will be present at once and together all the Inhabitants of Heaven and
Earth, and Hell. Angels must be there to attend and minister; those glistering
Courtiers of Heaven must attend his person. So that Heaven will for a time, be
left empty of all its Inhabitants. Men and Devils must be there to be judged.
And before this great Assembly, will Christ appear in Royal Majesty that day.
He will ( to allude to that Text, Isa. 24.23.) reign before his Ancients
gloriously. For he will come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired
in all them that believe, 2 These. 1.10. The inhabitants of the three Regions,
Heaven, Earth, and Hell shall rejoice, or tremble before him that day. And
acknowledge him to be supreme Lord and King. Thirdly, This will roll away for
ever the reproach of his death. For Pilate and the High Priest that Judged him
at their bars, shall now stand quivering at his bar; with Herod that set him at
naught, the Soldiers and Officers that traduced and abused him. There they
that reviled him on the Cross wagging their heads, will stand with trembling
knees before his Throne. For every eye shall see him, and they also that
pierced him, Rev. 1.7. O what a contemptible person was Christ in their eyes
once? As a worm, and no man. Every vile wretch could freely tread, and trample
on him; but now such will be the brightness of his glory, such the awful beams
of Majesty, that the wicked shall not stand in his presence, (...)
or be able to rise up (as that word imports, Psalm. 1.5.) before him. So that
this will be a full and Universal vindication of the death of Christ, from all
that contempt and ignominy that attended it. We next improve it.


Inference 1.
Infer. 1.
Is Jesus Christ ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead, great then
is the security believers have, that they shall not be condemned in that day.
Who shall condemn, when Christ is Judge? If believers be condemned in
Judgment, Christ must give Sentence against them. Yea, and they must condemn
themselves too. I say Christ must give Sentence, for that is the proper and
peculiar Office of Christ. And to be sure, no Sentence of condemnation shall in
that day be given by Christ against them. For First, He died to save them, and
he will never cross and overthrow the designs and ends of his own death. That
cannot be imagined, nay, Secondly, They have been cleared, and absolved
already. And being once absolved by divine Sentence, they can never be
condemned afterward. For one divine Sentence, cannot, cross and rescind
another. He justified them here in this world by Faith. Declared in his Word
(which shall then be the rule of Judgment, Romans 2.16.) That there is no
condemnation to them that are in Christ, Romans 8.1. And surely he will not
retract his own Word, and give a Sentence quite cross to his own Statute-book,
out of which he has told us they shall be Judged. Moreover, Thirdly, The far
greatest part of them will have past their particular Judgment long before
that day, and being therein acquitted by God the Judge of all; and admitted
into Heaven upon the score and account of their Justification; it cannot be
imagined that Christ should now condemn them with the World. Nay, Fourthly, He
that Judges them is their head, husband, friend, and brother; who loved them,
and gave himself for them: Oh then, with what confidence may they go, even unto
his Throne? And say with Job, though he try us as fire, we know we shall come
forth as Gold. We know that we shall be justified. Especially, if we add, that
they themselves shall be assessors with Christ in that day. Geodwirs Triumph.
p. 146.
And (as a Judicious Author pertinently observes) not a Sentence shall pass
without their Votes. So as that they may by Faith not only look upon themselves
as already in Heaven, sitting with Christ as a common person, in their right;
but they may look upon themselves as Judges already. So that if any sin should
arise to accuse, or condemn, yet it must be with their Votes. And what greater
security can they have than this, that they must condemn themselves, if they be
condemned. No, no, it is not the business of that day to condemn, but to
absolve and pronounce them pardoned and justified, according to the sense of
Act. 3.19. and Matthew. 12.32. So that it must needs be a time of refreshing (as
the Scriptures call it) to the people of God. You that now believe, shall not
come into condemnation, Ioh. 5.24. You that now Judge your selves, shall not be
condemned with the world, 1 Cor. 11.31, 32.


Inference 2.
If Christ be ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead, Infer. 2.
how miserable a case will Christless Souls be in at that day! They that are
Christless now, will be speechless, helpless, and hopeless then. How will their
hands hang down, and their knees knock together! O what pale faces, quivering
lips, fainting hearts, and roaring consciences will be among them in that day!
O dreadful day! O astonishing sight! To see the World in a dreadful
conflagration, the Elements melting, the Stars falling, the Earth trembling,
the Judgment set, the Prisoners brought forth; O who shall endure in this day,
but those that by union with Christ, are secured against the danger and dread
of it? Let me demand of poor Christless Souls, whom this day is like to
overtake unawares.

Do ye think it possible to avoid appearing after that terrible citation is
given to the World by the Trump of God? Alas, how can you imagine it? Is not
the same power that revived your dust, able to bring you before the bar? There
is a necessity that you must come forth, 2 Cor. 5.10. We [Must] all appear. It
is not at the sinners choice, to obey the Summons or not.

If you must appear, are there no Accusers, nor Witnesses that will appear
against you, and confront you in the Court? What think you, was Satan so often
a Tempter to you here, and will he not be an Accuser there? Yes, nothing surer;
for that was the main design of all his Temptations. What think you of your own
Consciences? Are they not privy to your secret wickedness? Don't they now
whisper sometimes in your ears, what you care not to hear of? If they whisper
now, they will thunder then, Romans 2.15, 16. Will not the Spirit accuse you, for
resisting his motions, and stifling thousands of his convictions? Will not your
Companions in sin accuse you? who drew, or were drawn by you to sin? Will not
your Teachers be your accusers? How many times have you made them complain,
Lord! they are Iron and Brass, they have made their faces harder than a Rock;
they refuse to return. Will not your very Relations be your accusers? To whom
you have failed in all your relational duties? Yea, and every one whom you have
tempted to sin, abused, defrauded, over-reacht: all these will be your
accusers. So that it is without dispute you will have accusers enough, to
appear against you.

Thirdly, Being accused before Jesus Christ, what will you plead for your
selves? Will you confess, or will you deny the charge? If you confess, what
need more? Out of thine own mouth will I Judge thee, says Christ, Luke 19.22.
If you deny, and plead not guilty: thy Judge is the searcher of hearts, and
knows all things. So that it will not at all help thee to make a lie thy last
refuge. This will add to the guilt, but not cover it.

Fourthly, If no defense or plea be left thee, then what can Must not the
Judge of all the Earth do right? Genesis 18.25. Must he not render to every man
according to his deeds? 2 Cor. 5.10. Yes, no question but he will proceed to
that Sentence, how terrible so ever it be to you to think on it now, or hear it
then.

Fifthly, To conclude, if Sentence be once given by Christ Psalm. 89.34. Do
thou hope he is more merciful and pitiful than so? Thou mistakest, if thou
expectest mercy out of that way in which he dispenses it. There will be
thousands, and ten thousands that will rejoice in, and magnify his mercy then;
but they are such as obeyed his call, repented, believed, and obtained union
with his person here; but for unbelievers, it is against the settled Law of
Christ, and constitution of the Gospel to show mercy to the despisers of it.
But it may be you think your tears, your cries, your pleadings with him, may
move him; these indeed might have done somewhat in time, but they come out of
season now. Alas, too late. What the success of such pleas and cries will be,
you may see if you will but consult two Scriptures, Job 27.8, 9. What is the
hope of the Hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his Soul?
Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him? No, no, and Matthew. 7.22.
Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Prophesied in thy
name, and in thy name have cast out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful
works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me ye
that work iniquity.

And must it come to this Dismal Issue with you indeed? God forbid it should.
Oh then

If Christ be appointed of God to be the Judge of all, Infer. 3.
How are all concerned to secure their interest in him, and therein an eternity
of happiness to their own souls, by the work of regeneration! Of all the
business that men and women have in this world, there is none so solemn, so
necessary, and important as this. O my Brethren, this is a work, able to drink
up your Spirits, whi^^ (...) do but think of the consequences of it.

Summon in then thy self-reflecting, and considering powers; get alone Reader,
and forgetting all other things, ponder with thy self this deep, dear and
eternal concernment of thine. Examine the state of thine own soul. Look into
the Scriptures, then into thine own heart, and then to Heaven, saying, Lord let
me not be deceived in so great a concernment to me as this. O let not the
trifles of time wipe off the impressions of Death, Judgment, and Eternity from
thy heart. O that long word Eternity, that it might be night and day with thee.
That the awe of it may be still upon thy Spirit. A Gentlewoman of this Nation
having spent the whole Afternoon and a great part of the Evening at Cards, in
much mirth and jollity, came home late at night, and finding her waiting
Gentlewoman reading, she looked over her shoulder upon the Book, and said, poor
melancholy soul, why do thou sit here poring so long upon thy Book? That
night she could not sleep, but lay sighing and weeping; her servant asked her
once and again what ailed her, at last she burst out into tears, and said, O it
was one word that I cast my eye upon in thy Book, that troubles me; there I saw
that word Eternity. How happy were I, if I were provided for Eternity! Sure it
concerns us, seeing we look for such things, to be diligent that we may be
found of him in Peace. O let not that day come by surprizal upon you. Remember,
that as Death leaves, so Judgment will find you.

Is Jesus Christ appointed Judge of quick and dead, then look to it, all you
that hope to be found of him in peace, that you avoid those sins, and live in
the daily practice of those duties, which the consideration of that day
powerfully persuades you to avoid or practice. For it not only presses us to
holiness in actu primo, in the being of it, but in actu secundo, in the daily
exercise and practice of it. Do you indeed expect such a day? O then, First,
See you be meek and patient under all injuries and abuses for Christ's sake.
Avenge not your selves, but leave it to the Lord, who will do it. Don't
anticipate the work of God. Be patient my Brethren, to the coming of the Lord,
Jam, 5.7, 8, 9. Secondly, Be Communicative public hearted Christians, studying
and devising liberal things for Christ's distressed members. And you shall have
both an honorable remembrance of it, and a full reward of it in that day,
Matthew. 25.34, 35. Thirdly, Be watchful and sober, keep the Golden bridle of
moderation upon all your affections. And see that ye be not over charged with
the cares and love of this present life, Luke 21.34, 35. Will you, that your
Lord come, and find you in such a posture. O let your moderation be known to
all, the Lord is at hand, Phil. 4.5. Fourthly, Improve all your Masters
Talents, diligently and Matthew. 25.14, 18. Then must you make up your account
for them all. Fifthly, But above all, be sincere in your profession. Let your
Luke 12.1, 2, 3. Beware of Hypocrisy, for there is nothing covered which shall
not be revealed, neither hid, that shall not be made known.


Thus I have finished through Divine aids, the whole Doctrine of the
Impetration of Redemption by Jesus Christ; we shall wind up the whole in a
General Exhortation, and I have done.

The General Use of the whole pressing to holiness, which is the main scope of
the Doctrine of Redemption.
The General USE.
AND now to close up all, let me persuade all those for whom the dear Son of
God came from the blessed bosom of the Father; assumed flesh, brake by the
strength of his own Love, through all discouragements and impediments, laid
down his own life a ransom for their Souls; for whom he Lived, Died, Rose,
Ascended, and lives for ever in Heaven to intercede: to live holy to Christ, as
Christ lived, and died wholly for them.

O Brethren, never was the Heathen world acquainted with such arguments to
deter them from sin, never acquainted with such motives to urge them to
holiness; as I shall this day acquaint you with. My request is, to give up both
your hearts and lives to glorify the Father, Son, and Spirit, whose you are,
by the holiness and heavenliness of them. Other things are expected from you,
than from other men. See that you turn not all this grace that has founded in
your ears, into wantonness. Think not because Christ has done so much for you,
you may sit still; much less indulge your selves in sin, because Christ has
offered up such an excellent sacrifice for the expiation of it. No, no, though
Christ came to be a Curse, he did not come to be a a Cloak for your sins. If
one died for all then were all dead; Secundum dictamen instinctum, impulsum
spiritus (...) gratiae i missae, and inditae robis a spiritu sa^cto.
that they that live, should not henceforth live to themselves; but to him that
died for them, 2 Cor. 5.15. O keep your lives pure and clean. Don't make fresh
work for the blood of Christ every day. If you live in the Spirit, see that you
walk in the Spirit, Gal. 5.25. That is (says Cornelius a Lapide very solidly.)
Let us shape and order our lives and actions according to the dictates,
instinct and impulses of the Spirit, and of that grace of the Spirit put within
us, and planted in our hearts, which tends to practical holiness. Oh let the
grace which is in your hearts, issue out into all your Religious, Civil, and
natural actions. Let the Faith that is in your hearts, appear in your prayers.
The Obedience of your hearts, in hearing. The Meekness of your hearts in
suffering. The Mercifulness of your hearts, in distributing. The Truth and
Righteousness of your hearts, in trading. The Sobriety and Temperance of your
hearts, in eating and drinking.

These be the fruits of Christ's sufferings indeed, and they are sweet fruits.
Let grace refine, enoble and elevate all your actions: that you may say, truly
our conversation is in Heaven. Let grace have the ordering of your tongues, and
of your hands; the moulding of your whole conversation. Let not Humility appear
in some actions, and Pride in others. Holy seriousness in some companies, and
vain frothiness in others. Suffer not the fountain of corruption to mingle with
or pollute the streams of grace. Write as exactly as you can after your Copy
Christ. O let there not be (as one well expresses it) here a line, R. A.
Virdiciae Pietatis.
and there a blanck. Here a word, and there a blot. One word of God, and two of
the World. Now a Spiritual rapture, and then a fleshly Frollick. This day a
fair stride to Heaven, and to morrow a slide back again toward Hell. But be
you in the fear of the Lord all the day long. Let there be a due proportion
betwixt all the parts of your conversation. Approve your selves the servants of
Christ in all things. By pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering, by the Holy
Ghost, by Love unfeigned, by the Word of Truth, by the power of God, by the
armor of Righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 2 Cor. 6.6. See then
how accuratly you walk. Cut off occasion from them that desire occasion; and in
well doing commit your selves to God, and commend Religion to the World. That
this is your great concernment and duty, I shall evidence to your conscience by
these following considerations. That of all persons in the world the Redeemed
of the Lord are most obliged to be holy. Most assisted for a life of holiness.
And that God intends to make great Use of their lives both for the conviction
and conversion of others.

Consid. First, God has most obliged them to live pure and strict lives. I
know the command obliges all men to it, even those that cast away the cords of
the commands, and break Christ's bonds asunder are yet bound by them; and cannot
plead a dispensation to live as they do. Yea, and it is not unusual for them to
feel the obligations of the command upon their consciences even when their
impetuous Lusts hurry them on to the violation of them: but there are special
ties upon your souls, that oblige you to holiness of life more than others.
Many special and peculiar engagements you are under. First, from God. Secondly,
from your selves. Thirdly, from your Brethren. Fourthly, from your enemies.

First, God has peculiarly obliged you to purity and strictness of Life. Yea
every person in the blessed Trinity has cast his Cord over your Souls, to bind
up your hearts and lives to the most strict and precise obedience of his
commands. Obli^ations from the Father.
The Father has obliged you and that not only by the common tie of Creation
which is yet of great efficacy in it self: for is it reasonable, that God
should create and form so excellent a piece, and that it should be employed
against him? That he should plant the Tree, and another eat the Fruit of it?
But besides this common engagement, he has obliged you to holiness of life.

First, By his wise and merciful designs and counsels for your recovery and
salvation by Jesus Christ. It was he that laid the corner stone of your
salvation with his own hands. The first motion sprang out of his breast. If God
had not designed the Redeemer for you, the world had never seen him; he had
never left that sweet bosom for you. It was the Act of the Father to give you
to the Son to be Redeemed, and then to give the Son to be a Redeemer to you.
Both of them stupenduous and astonishing Acts of grace. And in both God acted
as a most free Agent. When he gave you to Christ before the beginning of time,
there was nothing out of himself that could in the least move him to it. When
the Father, Son, and Spirit sat (as I may say) at the Counsel Table,
contriving and laying the design for the salvation of a few out of many of
Adams degenerate offspring, there was none came before them to speak one word
for thee; but such was the divine pleasure to insert thy name in that Catalogue
of the saved. Oh how much owe thou to the Lord for this! And what an
engagement does it leave upon thy soul to obey, please and glorify him?

Secondly, By his bountiful remunerations of your obedience, which have been
wonderful. What service did thou ever perform for him, for which he has not
paid thee a thousand times more than it was worth? Did thou ever seek him
diligently, and not find him a bountiful rewarder, none seek him in vain,
unless such only as seek him vainly, Heb. 11.6. Did ever give a cup of cold
water in the name of a Disciple, and not receive a Disciples reward? Matthew.
10.42. Have thou not found inward peace and comfort flowing into thy soul, upon
every piece of sincere obedience? Oh what a good Master do Saints serve? You
that are remiss and unconstant in your obedience, you that are heartless and
cold in duties; hear how your God expostulates with you, Ier 2.31. Have I been
a Wilderness to Israel, or a Land of darkness? q. d. have I been a hard Master
to you? Have you any reason to complain of me? To whom soever I have been
straight handed, surely I have not been so to you. Are the fruits of sin like
the fruits of obedience? Do you know where to find a better Master? Why then
are you so shuffling and unconstant, so sluggish and remiss in my work? Surely
God is not behind hand with any of you. May you not say with David, Psalm.
119.56. This I had because I kept thy precepts. There is fruits in holiness
even present fruit. It is a high favor to be employed for God. Reward enough
that he will accept any thing thou do. But to return every Duty thou
presentest to him with such comforts, such quicknings, such inward and outward
blessings into thy bosom, so that thou may open the the treasury of thine own
experiences, view the varieties of encouragements and Love Tokens at several
times received in Duties; and say this I had, and that I had, by waiting on
God, and serving him. Oh what an engagement is this upon thee to be ever
abounding in the work of the Lord! Though thou must not work for Wages, yet God
will not let thy work go unrewarded. For He is not unrighteous to forget your
work and labor of Love.

Thirdly, Your Father has further obliged you to this holiness by signifying
to you (as he has frequently done) the great delight and pleasure he has
therein. He has told you that such as are upright in the way are his delight,
Pro. 11.20. That he would not have you forget to do good and to communicate,
for with such sacrifices he is well pleased, Heb. 13.16. You know you cannot
walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, except ye be fruitful in every good
word and work, Col. 1.10. And oh what a bond is this upon you to live holy
lives! Can you please your selves in displeasing your Father? If you have the
hearts of Children in you, sure you cannot. O you cannot grieve his spirit by
loose and careless walking, but you must grieve your own spirits too. How many
times has God pleased you, gratified and contented you, and will not you
please and content him? This mercy you have asked of him, and he gave it, that
mercy and you were not denied: in many things the Lord has wonderfully
condescended to please you, and now there is but one thing that he desires of
you, and that most reasonable, yea, beneficial for you, as well as pleasing to
him, 1 Phil. 27. Only let your conversation be as becomes the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. This is the one thing the great and main thing he expects from you in
this world, and will not you do it? Can you expect he should gratify your
desires, when you make no more of grieving and displeasing him? Well, if you
know what will please God, and yet resolve not to do it, but will rather please
your flesh, and gratify the Devil, than him; pray pull off your vizards, fall
into your own rank among hypocrites; and appear as indeed you are.

The Father has further obliged you to strictness and purity of conversation,
by his gracious promises made to such as so walk. He has promised to do great
things for you, if you will but do this one thing for him. If you will order
your conversation aright, Psalm. 50. ult. He will be your Sun and Shield, if you
will walk before him and be upright, Genesis 15.1. He will give grace and glory,
and no good thing will he withhold from him that walks uprightly, Psalm.
84.11. And he promises no more to you than he has made good to others, that
have thus walked, and stands ready to perform to you also. If you look to enjoy
the good of the promise, you are obliged by all your expectations, and hopes to
order your lives purely and uprightly. This hope will set you on work to purge
your lives as well as your hearts from all pollutions, 2 Cor. 7.1. Having these
Promises let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

Fifthly, Yea, He has yet more obliged you to strict and holy lives by his
confidence in you that you will thus walk, and please him. He expresses
himself in Scripture as one that dare trust you with his glory, knowing that
you will be tender of it, and dare do no otherwise. If but a man repose
confidence in you and trust you with his concerns, it greatly obliges you to be
faithful. What an engagement was that upon Abraham to walk uprightly when God
said of him, Genesis 18.19. I know him, that he will command his Children, and his
household after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord, q. d. as for this
wicked generation, whom I will speedily consume in my wrath, I know they regard
not my Laws, they will trample my commands under foot; they care not how they
provoke me, but I expect other things from Abraham, and I am confident he will
not fail me. I know him, he is a man of another spirit; and what I promise my
self from him, he will make good. And to the like purpose is that in Isa.
63.78. I will mention the loving kindness of the Lord, and the praises of the
Lord; according to all that the Lord has bestowed on us, and the great
goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them; according
to his mercies and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. For he
said surely they are my people, Children that will not lie, (or fail me) so he
was their Savior. Here you have an ample account of the endearing mercies of
God to that people, ver. 7. and the Lords confident expectations of suitable
returns from them, ver. 8. I said (i. e.) (speaking after the manner of men in
like cases) I made full account that after all these endearments, and favors
bestowed upon them, they would not offer to be disloyal and false to me. I have
made them sure enough to my self, by so many bonds of Love. Like to which is
that expression, Zeph. 3.7. I said surely thou will fear me, thou will receive
instruction. Oh how great are the expectations of God from such as you. I know
Abraham, there is no doubt of him. And again they are Children that will not
lie, (i. e.) they will not fallere fidem datam. Break their Covenant with me.
Or they are my people that will not shrink as Mr. Coverdale well translates,
filii non negantes, such as will keep touch with me, and will answer their
Covenant engagements. And again surely thou will fear me, thou will receive
instruction. And shall not all this engage you to God? What! neither the
ancient and bountiful love of God, in contriving your Redemption from eternity,
nor the bounty of God in rewarding all and every piece of service you have done
for him. Nor yet the pleasure he takes in your obedience and upright walking.
Nor the encouraging promises he has made thereto, nor yet his confident
expectations of such a life from you whom he has so many ways obliged and
endeared to himself? will you forget your ancient friend? Contemn his rewards,
take no delight or care to please him? Slight his promises, and deceive and
fail his expectations? Be astonished, O ye Heavens, at this! And be horribly
afraid. Consider how God the Father has fastened this five fold cord upon your
Souls, and show your selves Christians; yea to use the Prophets words, Esa.
46.8. Remember this and show your selves men.

Obligations from the Son
Secondly, You are yet farther engaged to this precise and holy life by what
the Son has done for you, is not this pure and holy life, the very aim, and
next end of his death? Did he not shed his blood to redeem you from your vain
conversations? 1 Pet. 1.18. Was not this the design of all his sufferings that
being delivered out of the hands of your enemies, you might serve him in
righteousness and holiness all the days of your life, Luke 1.74, 75. And is
not the Apostles inference, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. highly reasonable, if one dyed for
all then were all dead, and that he dyed for all, that they which live, should
not henceforth live to themselves, but to him that dyed for them. Did Christ
only buy your Persons, and not your services also? No, no, who ever has thy
time, thy strength, or any part of either: I can assure thee, Christian, that
Christ has paid for it, and thou give away what is none of thine own to
give. Every moment of thy time is his. Every Talent, whether of grace or nature
is his. And do thou defraud him of his own? Oh how liberal are you of your
precious words, and hours, as if Christ had never made a purchase of them! Oh
think of this when thy life runs muddy and ^oul. When the fountain of
corruption flows out at thy tongue, in idle frothy discourses; or at thy hand,
in sinful unwarrantable actions; does this become the redeemed of the Lord? Did
Christ come from the bosom of his Father for this? Did he groan, sweat, bleed,
endure the Cross, and lay down his life for this? Was he so well pleased with
all his sorrows, and sufferings, his pangs, and agonies upon the account of
that satisfaction he should have in seeing the travail of his Soul? Isa. 53.11.
as if he had said, Welcome Death, welcome Agonies, welcome the bitter cup, and
heavy burden; I cheerfully submit to all this. These are travailing pangs
indeed, but I shall see a beautiful birth at last. These throws, and Agonies,
shall bring forth many lively Children to God; I shall have joy in them, and
glory from them to all Eternity. This blood of mine, these sufferings of mine,
shall purchase to me the Persons, Duties, Services, and obedience of many
thousands, that will Love me, and Honor me, Serve me, and Obey me, with their
Souls, and Bodies which are mine. And does not this engage you to look to your
lives, and keep them pure? Is not every one of Christ's wounds a mouth open to
plead for more holiness, more service and more fruit from you? Oh what will
engage you if this will not? But

Thirdly, Engagements from the Spirit.
This is not all; as a man when he weighs a thing, casts in weight after
weight, till the scales are counterpoised: so does God cast in engagement after
engagement, and argument upon argument, till thy heart (Christian) be weighed
up, and won to this heavenly life. And therefore as Elihu said to Job, cap.
36.22. Suffer me a little, and I will show thee what I have yet to speak on
Gods behalf. Some Arguments have already been urged on the behalf of the
Father, and Son for purity and cleanness of life; and next I have something to
plead on the behalf of the Spirit. I plead now on his behalf, who has so many
times helped you to plead for your selves with God. He that has so often
refreshed, quickened, and comforted you, he will be quenched, grieved, and
displeased by an impure, loose, and careless conversation; and what will you do
then? Who shall comfort you, when the Comforter is departed from you? When he
that should relieve your souls, is far off? Oh grieve not the holy Spirit of
God, by which you are sealed to the day of Redemption, Ephesians. 4.30. There is
nothing grieves him more than impure practices. For he is a holy Spirit. And
look as water damps and quenches the fire; so does sin quench the Spirit, 1
These. 5.19. Will you quench the warm affections and burning desires which he
has kindled in your bosoms; if you do, it is a question whether ever you may
recover them again to your dying day. the Spirit has a delicate Sense. It is
the most tender thing in the whole world. He feels the least touch of sin, and
is grieved when thy corruptions within are stirred by temptations, and break
out to the defiling of thy life; then is the holy Spirit of God as it were made
sad, and heavy within thee. As that word (...), Ephesians. 4.30. may be rendered.
For thereby thou both resistest his motions, whereby in the way of a loving
constraint, he would lead and guide thee in the way of thy Duty; yea, thou not
only resistest his motions, but crossest his grand design, which is to purge
and sanctify thee wholly, and build thee up more and more to the perfection of
holiness. And when thou thus forsakest his conduct, and crossest his design in
thy soul then does he usually withdraw, as a man that is grieved by the
unkindness of his friend. He draws in the beams of his evidencing and quickening
grace. Packs up all his divine Cordials, and says as it were to this unkind
and disingenious Soul, The Spirits Expostulation with careless Christians.
Have thou thus requited me, for all the favors and kindnesses thou have
received from me? Have I quickened thee when thou wast dead in transgressions,
did I descend upon thee in the Preaching of the Gospel, and communicate life,
even the life of God to thee; leaving others in the state of the Dead? Have I
shed forth such rich influences of grace and comfort upon thee? Comforting thee
in all thy troubles, helping thee in all thy duties, satisfying thee in all thy
doubts and perplexities of soul, saving thee and pulling thee back from so many
destructive temptations and dangers? What had been thy condition, if I had not
come unto thee? Could the Word have converted thee without me? Could ministers,
could Angels have done that for the which I did? And when I had quickened thee,
and made thee a living soul, what could thou have done without my exciting
and assisting grace? Could thou go on in the way of Duty, if I had not led
thee? How would thou have waded through the deeps of spiritual troubles, if I
had not born thee up? Whither had the Temptations of Satan and thine own
corruptions carried thee before this day; if I had not stood thy friend, and
come in for thy rescue in the time of need? Did I ever fail thee in thy
extremities? Did I ever leave thee in thy dangers? Have I not been tender over
thee, and faithful to thee? And now for which of all these kindnesses do thou
thus wrong and abuse me? Why have thou wounded me thus by thy unkindness? Ah
thou have requited my Love! And now thou have eat the fruit of thy doings. Let
the light now be darkness. Thy Songs turned into howlings. The joy of thine
heart, the light of thine eyes, the health of thy countenance, even the face of
thy God, and the joy of salvation be hid from thee.

This is the fruit of careless and loose walking. To this sad issue it will
bring thee at last, and when it is come to this; thou shall go to Ordinances,
and Duties, and find no good in them; no life quickening comfort there. When thy
heart which was wont to be enlarged, and flowing, shall be clung up and dry;
when thou shall kneel down before the Lord, and cry as Elisha when with the
mantle of Elijah he smote the water; Where is the Lord God of Elijah? So thou,
where is the God of Prayer? Where is the God of Duties? But there is no answer:
when like Sampson, thou shall go forth and shake thy self as at other times;
but thy strength is gone: then tell me, what thou have done in resisting,
quenching, and grieving the holy Spirit of God by impure and offensive
practices? And thus you see what engagements lie upon you from the Spirit also,
to walk uprightly and keep the issues of life pure. I could willingly have
enlarged my self upon this last branch, Mr. Polew^eils Treatise of quenching
the Spirit.
but that I find a Judicious hand has lately improved this Argument; to which
I shall refer the Reader. Thus God has obliged you to circumspect and holy
lives.

Secondly, You are under great engagements to keep your As God has bound you
to purity of conversation, so you have bound your selves. And there are several
things in you, and done by you, which wonderfully increase, and strengthen your
Obligations to practical holiness.

First, Your clearer illumination is a strong bond upon your Ephesians. 5.8. Ye were
sometimes darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord; walk as Children of the
light. You cannot pretend, or plead ignorance of your Duty. You stand convinced
in your own consciences before God, that this is your unquestionable Duty.
Christians, will you not all yield to this? I know you readily yield it. We
live indeed in a contentious disputing Age. In other things our opinions are
different. One Christian is of this Judgment, another of that; but does he
deserve the name of a Christian, that dare once question this truth? In this we
all meet and close in oneness of mind and Judgment, that it is our
indisputable Duty, to live pure, strict, and clean lives. The grace of God
which has appeared to you, has taught you this truth clearly and
convincingly, 2 Tit. 11.12. You have received how you ought to walk, and to
please God, 1 These. 4.1. Well then, this being yielded, the inference is plain,
and undeniable; that you cannot walk as others, in the vanity of their minds;
but you must offer violence to your own light. You cannot suffer the
corruptions of your hearts to break forth into practice, but you must slight,
and put by the notices and rebukes of your own consciences, Iam. 4.17. He that
knows to do good, and does it not; to him it is sin. Yea sin with a witness.
Aggravated sin. Sin of a deeper tincture than that of the ignorant Heathens.
Sin that sadly wastes and violates conscience. Certainly who ever has, you
have no cloak for your sin. Light and Lust struggling together, great light and
strong lusts: these make the soul a troubled Sea that cannot rest. Oh but when
masterless Lusts over-bears Conscience, this impresses horror upon the soul.
This brake David's heart, Psalm. 51.6. Thou have put knowledge in my inner parts,
q. d. Ah Lord! I went against the rebukes of conscience, to the commission of
this sin. I had a watchful light set up within me. I knew it was sin. My light
endeavored lovingly to restrain me, and I thrust it aside. Besides, what
pleasure in sin can you have? Indeed such as for want of light know not what
they do, or such whose consciences are seared and past feeling; they may seek a
litt^e pleasure (such as it is) out of sin; but what content or pleasure can
you have, so long as your light is ever breaking in upon you, and smiting you
for what you do? This greatly increases your obligation to a precise holy life.
Again,

You are professors of holiness. You have given in your names to Christ, to be
his Disciples; and by this your engagement to a life of holiness are yet
further strengthened, 2 Timothy 2.19. Let every one that names the name of
Christ, depart, from iniquity. The name of Christ is called upon you, and it is
a worthy name, Jam. 2.7. It Is called upon you, as the name of the Husband, is
called upon his Wife, Isa. 4.1. Let thy name be called upon us. Or as the name
of a Father is called upon his Child, Genesis 48.16. Let my name be called on
them, and the name of my Fathers. Well then, you bear the name of Christ as his
Spouses or Children; and will you not live sutably to your name? Every place
and relation, every title of honor and dignity has its decorum, and
becomingness. Oh how will that worthy name of Christ be blasphemed through you?
If you adorn it not with becoming deportments? Better you had never professed any
thing, than to set your selves by your profession in the eye and observation of
the world; and then to pour contempt on Jesus Christ, by your scandalous
conversations, before the Chams of the world; who will laugh at it. I remember
it was a Memento given to one of his name by Alexander, Recordare nominis
Allexandri. Remember (said he) thy name Alexander, and do nothing unworthy of
that name. O that is a heavy charge, Romans 2.24. Through you is the name of God
blasphemed among the Heathens. Unhappy man, that ever thou should be a
reproach to Christ. The herd of wicked men, they are ignota capita; men of no
note, or observation. They may sin, and sin again; drink, swear, and tumble in
all uncleanness; and it passes away silently; the world takes little notice of
it. Their wicked actions make but little noise in the world; but the
miscarriages of professors are like a Blazing Comet, or an Eclipsed Sun, which
all men gaze at, and make their observations upon; Oh then, what manner of
persons ought you to be, who bear the worthy name of Christ upon you!

Thirdly, But more than this, You have obliged your selves to How many times
have you lifted up your hands to Heaven, and cried with David Psalm. 119.5. Oh
that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes. Order my steps in thy Word,
and let no iniquity have dominion over me, verse. 133. Were you in earnest with
God, when you thus prayed? Did you mean as you said? or did you only complement
with God? If your hearts and tongues agreed in this request, doubtless it is as
much your Duty to endeavor, as to desire those mercies; and if not, yet do all
those prayers stand on record before the Lord, and will be produced against you
as witnesses to condemn you, for your hypocrisy and vanity. How often also
have you in your Prayers lamented and bewailed your careless and uneven
walkings? You have said with Ezra, chap. 9.6. O my God I am ashamed, and even
blush to look up unto thee. And do not your confessions oblige you to greater
circumspection and care for time to come? Will you confess, and sin? And sin,
and confess? Go to God and bewail your evils, and when you have bewailed them,
return again to the commission of them? God forbid, you should thus dissemble
with God, play with sin, and dye your iniquities with a deeper tincture.

Fourthly, And lastly, to add no more, you have often reproved Have you not
often reproved your erring brethren? or at least privately censured them, if
not duly reproved them, (for to these left handed blows of secret censurings,
we are more apt than to the fair and open strokes of just and due reproofs) and
will you practice the same things, you criminate and censure others for? Thou
that teach another, (says the Apostle) teach thou not thy self? Romans
2.21. So say I, thou that censurest or rebukest another, condemnest thou not
thy self? Will your rebukes ever do good to others, whilst you allow in your
selves what you condemn in them? And as these reproofs and censures can do them
no good, so they do you much evil, by reason of them you are (...) self
condemned persons; and out of your own mouths God will Judge you. For you need
no other witness, than your selves in this case. Your own tongues will fall
upon you. Your censures and reproofs of others, will leave you without plea, or
Apology, if you look not to your lives with greater care. And yet will you be
careless still? Fear you not the displeasure of God? nor the wounding and
disquieting your own consciences? Surely these things are of no light value
with you, if you be Christians indeed.

You are yet further engaged to practical holiness upon the account of your
brethren, who are not a little concerned, and interested therein. For if
through the neglect of your hearts, your lives be defiled and polluted, this
will be thrown in their faces, and many innocent and upright ones, both
reproached and grieved upon your account. This mischievous effect holy David
earnestly deprecated, Psalm. 69.5, 6. Oh God thou know my foolishness, and my
sins are not hid from thee; let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of
Hosts, be ashamed for my sake. Let not them that seek thee, be confounded for
my sake, O God of Israel, q. d. Lord, thou know what a weak and foolish
creature I am. And how apt to miscarry, if left to my self, and should I
through my foolishness, act unbecoming a Saint; how would this shame the faces,
and sad the hearts of thy people! They will be as men confounded at the report
of my fall. The fall of one Christian, is matter of trouble and shame to all
the rest. And when they shall hear the sad and unwelcome news of your
scandalous miscarriages, (which will certainly be the effect of a neglected
heart and life) they will say as David concerning Saul and Jonathan; tell it
not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, etc. Or as Tamar
concerning Ammon, and we, whither shall we cause our shame to go? And for them,
they shall be as the fools in Israel. Thy loose and careless life will cause
them to estrange themselves from thee, and look shy upon thee, as being ashamed
to own thee, and can thou bear that? Will it not grieve and pierce your very
hearts to see a cloud of strangeness and trouble over the countenances of your
brethren? To see your selves disowned and lightly esteemed by them? This very
consideration struck a great favorite in the Persian Court to the very heart.
Zozomen. lib. 2. cap. 8.
It was Vstazanes, who had been Governor to Sapores in his minority. And this
man for fear, denied the Christian Faith; and complied with the Idolatrous
worship of the King. And one day (says the Historian) sitting at the
Courtgate, he saw Simon the aged Archbishop of Selucia, drawing along to
prison for his constancy in the Christian Faith; and though he durst not openly
own the Faith he had basely denied, and confess himself a Christian: yet he
could not choose but rise, and express his reverence to this holy man; in a
respective and honorable salutation; but the zealous good man frowned upon
him, and turned away his face from him; as thinking such an Apostate unworthy
of the least respect from him; this presently struck Vstazanes to the heart,
and drew from him many tears, and groans; and thus he reasoned with himself,
Simon will not own me, and can I think but that God will disclaim me, when I
appear before his Tribunal? Simon will not speak unto me, will not so much as
look upon me, and can I look for so much as a good word or look from Jesus
Christ, whom I have so shamefully betrayed, and denied? Hereupon he threw of
his rich Courtly robes, and put on mourning apparel, and professed himself a
Christian; and died a Martyr. O it is a piercing thing to an honest heart, to be
cast out of the favor of Gods people. If you walk loosely, neither God nor his
people will look kindly upon you.

Fourthly, And lastly, Your very enemies engage you to this You are obliged by
them two ways, viz. as they are your bold censurers, and your watchful
observers. They censure you as hypocrites, and will you give them ground and
matter for such a charge? they say only your tongues are more holy than other
men's, and shall they prove it, from your practice? They also observe you
diligently. Lie at catch, and are highly gratified by your miscarriages. If
your lives be loose and defiled, you will not only be a shame to your friends,
but the Song of your enemies. You will make mirth in Hell. And gratify all the
enemies of God. This is that they watch for. They are curious observers of your
goings. And that which makes them Triumph at your falls and miscarriages, is
not only that deep rooted enmity betwixt the two seeds, but because all your
miscarriages and evils are so many absolutions to their consciences, and
Justifications (as they think) of their ways and practices. For look as your
strictness and holiness does as it were cast, and condemn them, as Noah, Heb.
11.7. by his practice, condemned the world, their consciences fly in their
faces, when they see your holy and pure conversations. It lays a damp upon
them. It works upon their consciences and causes many smart reflections. So
when you fall, you as it were absolve their consciences, loose the bonds of
conviction you had made fast upon them, and now there is matter of Joy put
before them.

Oh say they, what ever these men talk; we see they are no better than we. They
can do as we do. They can Cozen and Cheat for advantage. They can comply with
any thing for their own ends; it is not conscience, as we once thought, but mere
stomach and humor that made them so precise. And oh what a sad thing is this!
Hereby you shed Soul-blood. You fasten the bonds of death upon their souls. You
kill those convictions, which for any thing you know might have made way to
their conversion. When you fall, you may rise again; but they may fall at your
example, and never rise more. Never have a good opinion of the ways of God, or
of his people any more. Upon this consideration David begs of God, Psalm. 5.8.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies; (or as the
Hebrew) my observers, make thy way straight before my face. And thus you see
how your very enemies oblige you to this holy and pure conversation also.

Now put all this together, and see to what these particulars will amount. You
have heard how God the Father has engaged you to this conversation purity, by
his designment of your Salvation. Rewarding your obedience. His pleasure in it.
His Promises to it. And his great confidence in you, that you will thus walk
before him. The Lord Jesus has also engaged you thereunto, by his death and
sufferings, whereby you were Redeemed from your vain conversations. The Spirit
has engaged you by telling you plainly how much you will grieve, and wrong
him, resist and quench him, if you do not keep your selves pure. Yea, you are
obliged further by your selves, your clear illumination, your high profession,
your many prayers and confessions, your many censures and reprehensions of
others, do all strengthen your obligation to holiness. Yea, you are obliged
further to this holy life, by the shame, grief, and trouble your loose walking
will bring upon your friends. And the mirth it will make for, and mischief it
will do to your enemies. Who will fall and break their necks, where it may be
you only stumbled, and brake your shins. Who are Justified, and absolved (as
before you heard) by your miscarriages. And now what think you of all this? Are
you obliged or not, to this purity of life? Are all these bonds tied with such
slip-knots that you can get loose, and free your selves at pleasure from them?
If all these things are of no force with you, if none of these bonds can hold
you; may it not be questioned (notwithstanding your profession) whether any
spiritual principle, any fear of God, or love to Christ, be in your souls or
no? O you could not play fast and loose with God; if so, you could not as
Sampson snap these bonds assunder, at your pleasure.

Consid. 2. Secondly, As you are more obliged to keep the issues of life pure
than others are, so God has given you greater assistances and advantages for
it, than others have. God has not been wanting to any in helps and means. Even
the Heathen who are without the Gospel will yet be speechless and inexcusable
before God: but how much more will you be so! who besides their light of
nature, and the general light of the Gospel, have first, such a principle put
within you. Secondly, such patterns set before you. Thirdly, such an assistant
ready to help you. Fourthly, so many rods at your backs to quicken you; and
prevent your wandering. If notwithstanding all these helps your live be still
unholy.

First, Shall men of such principles walk as others do? Shall we David once did
for Saul, saying there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the
shield of Saul; as though he had not been anointed with oil. There the honor
of a Christian was vilely cast away, as though he had not been anointed with
the Spirit? You have received an unction from the holy one, which teaches you
all things, 1 John 2.20. Another Spirit, far above that which is in other men,
1 Cor. 2.12. And as this Spirit which is in you is fitted for this life of
holiness, ( for ye are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus to good works,
Ephesians. 2.10. So this holy Spirit, a principle infused into your souls, has
such a natural tendency to this holy life; that if you live not purely and
strictly you must offer violence to your own principles, and a new nature. A
twofold help this principle affords you for a life of holiness.

(1.) First, It pulls you back from sin, as in Joseph; How can I do this great
wickedness and sin against God! And it also inclines you powerfully to
obedience. It Is a curb to sin, and a spur to holiness. It is unpossible for all
others to live spiritually and heavenly, because they have no new nature to
incline them thereunto. And methinks it should be hard for you to live
carnally, and sensually; and therein cross the very bent and tendency of the
new creature, which is formed in you. How can you neglect Prayer as others do,
whiles the Spirit by divine pulsations is awaking and rousing up your sluggish
hearts with such inward motions, and whispers as that, Psalm. 27.8. Seek my
face. Yea, whilst you fell (during your omissions of duty) something within
that bemoans it self, and as it were cries for food, pains and gripes you, like
an empty stomach, and will not let you be quiet till it be relieved. How can
you let out your hearts to the world as other men do; when all that while your
Spirit is restless, and aches like a bone out of joint. And you can never be at
ease till you come back to God, and say as Psalm. 116. Return to thy rest, O my
soul. Is it not hard, yea, naturally impossible to fix a stone and make it
abide in the fluid air? Does not every creature in a restless motion tend to
its proper Center, and desire its own perfection? So does this new creature
also. You see how the Rivers in their course will not be checked, but bear down
all obstacles in their way and Saevior ab obice ibit. A stop does but make them
rage the more, and run the swifter afterward.

There is a Central force in these natural motions, which cannot be stopped. And
the like may you observe in the motions of a renewed soul, Ioh. 4.14. It shall
be in him as a Well of water springing up. And is it not hard for you to keep
it down, or turn its course? How hard did Jeremy, and David find that work? If
you do not live holy lives, you must cross your own new nature, and violate the
Law that is written in your own hearts, and engraven upon your own bowels. To
this purpose a late Writer speaks, Mr. T. Malls Exhor. to holy living.
Till you were converted (says he) the flesh was predominant, and therefore it
was impossible for you to live any other than a fleshly life; for every thing
will act according to its predominant principle. Should you not therefore live
a spiritual life? Should not the Law of God witten in your hearts, be legible
in your lives? O should not your lives be according to the tendency of your
hearts? thus he. Doubtless this is no swall advantage to practical holiness. But

Secondly, Besides this principle within, you have no small assistance The path
of holiness is no untrodden path to you. Christ and his Servants have beaten it
before you. The life of Christ is your Copy, and it is a fair Copy indeed,
without a blot. Oh what an advantage is this to draw all the lines of your
actions according to his example! This glorious grand example is often pressed
upon you for imitation, Heb. 12.2. Looking to Jesus, he has left you an
example that ye should tread in his steps, 1 Pet. 2.21. His life is a living
rule to his people, and besides Christ's example (for you may say who can live
as Christ did? His example is quite above us) you have a cloud of witnesses. A
cloud for its directive Use, and these men of like passions, temptations, and
constitutions with you; who have gone before you in exemplary holiness. The
Holy Ghost (intending therein, your special help and advantage) has set many
industrious pens awork to write the lines of the Saints, and preserve for your
use their holy sayings, and heavenly actions. He bids you take them for an
example, Jam. 5.10. Oh what excellent men are past on before you! What renowned
Worthies have led the way! Men whose conversations were in Heaven, whilst they
Tabernacled on earth. Whilst this lower world had their bodies, the world above
had their hearts, their affections; their actions, their designs were all for
Heaven. Men that improved troubles, and comforts; losses, and gains; smiles,
and frowns; and all for Heaven. Men that did extract Heaven out of Spirituals,
out of Temporals, out of all things; their hearts were full of heavenly
meditations, their mouths of heavenly communications; and their practices of
heavenly inclinations. O what singular help is this! Where they followed
Christ, and kept the way, they are propounded for your imitation, and where any
of them turned aside, you have a mark set upon that action, for your caution
and prevention. Does any strange or unusual trial befall you, in which you are
ready to say with the Church, Lam. 1.12. Was there ever any sorrow like unto my
sorrow? Here you may see the same affliction accomplished in your brethren, 1
Pet. 5.9. Here Is store of good company to encourage you. Does the world and
Devil endeavor to turn you from your duty, by loading it with shameful scoffs,
or sufferings? In this case you may look to Jesus, who despised the shame; and
to your Brethren who counted it their honor to be dishonored for the name of
Christ, as the Original of the Text, Act. 5.41. (...).
may be translated. Is it a dishonor to thee to be rankt with Abraham, Moses,
David, and such as were the glory of the Ages they lived in? Art thou at any
time under a faint fit of discouragement; and ready to despond under any
burden; oh how may thou be animated by such examples, when such a qualm comes
over thy heart? Some sparks of their holy courage cannot choose but steal into
thy breast, whilst thou considerest them. In them God has set before thee the
possibility of overcoming all difficulties, thou see men of the same mould,
who had the same trials, discouragements, and fears that thou now have, and yet
overcame all. How is thy unbelief checked when thou say, Oh I shall never
reach the end, I shall one day utterly perish. Why do thou say so? Why may
not such a poor creature as thou art, be carried through as well as they? Had
not they the same temptations and corruptions with you? Were not they all
troubled with a naughty heart, an ensnaring world, a busy Devil as well as
you? Alas! when they put on the divine, they did not put off the humane nature;
but complained, and feared as you do; and yet were carried through all.

Oh what an advantage have you this way! They that first trusted in Christ, had
not such an help as you. You stand upon their shoulders. You have the benefit
of their experiences. You that are fallen into the last times, have certainly
the best helps to holiness. And yet will not you live strictly and purely? Will
you put on the name and profession of Christians, and yet be lofty in your
spirits, earthly in your designs; neglective of duty; frothy in your
communions? Pray from which of all the Saints did you learn to be proud? Did
you learn that from Christ, or any of his? From which of his Saints did you
learn to be earthly and covetous, passionate o^ censorious, overreaching and
crafty? If you have read of any such evils committed by them, have you not also
read of their shame and sorrow, their repentance and reformations? If you have
found any such blots in their lives, it was left there designedly to prevent
the like in yours. Oh what an help to holiness is this!

Thirdly, And this is not all. You have not only a principle within you, and a
pattern before you, but you have also an Omnipotent assistant to help and
encourage you throughout your way. Are you feeble and infirm? and is every
temptation, even the weakest; strong enough to turn you out of the way of your
Duty? Lo, God has sent his Spirit to help your infirmities, Romans 8.26. no
matter then how weak you are, how many and mighty your difficulties and
temptations are, as long as you have such an assistant to help you. Great is
your advantage for a holy life, this way also. For (1.) First, When a
temptation to sin presses sore upon you, he pleads with your consciences
within, whilst Satan is tempting without. How often has he brought such
Scriptures to your remembrance, in the very nick of opportunity; as have saved
you out of the temptation? If you attend his voice, you may hear such a voice
within you as that, Ier. 44.4. Oh do not this abominable thing which I hate.
What mighty strivings were there in the heart of Spira, as himself relates? He
heard as it were a voice within him saying, Do not write Spira, do not write.
To this purpose is that promise, Isa. 30.20, 21. Thine eyes shall behold thy
teachers, and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying, this is the way,
walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
Here you have a twofold help to holiness, the outward teaching of the Word,
ver. 20. and the inward teachings of the Spirit, ver. 21. He shall say this is
the way, when ye are turning aside to the right hand or to the left. Alluding
to a Shepherd (says one) who driving his Sheep before him; whistles them in
when he sees them ready to stray. (2.) Secondly, When ye walk holily and
closely with God in your duties, the Spirit incourages you to go on, by those
inward comforts, sealings, and joys you have from him at such times. How often
has he entertained your souls in public Ordinances, in private duties, with
his hidden Manna, with marrow and fastness, with incomparable and unspeakable
comforts, and all this to strengthen you in your way, and encourage you to hold
on? (3.) Thirdly, When you are indisposed for duties, and find your hearts
empty and dry, he is ready to fill them, quicken and raise them; so that
oftentimes the beginnings and end of your Prayers, hearing, or meditations are
as vastly different, as if one man had begun and another ended the duty. O then
what assistances for a holy life have you? Others indeed are bound to resist
temptations as well as you; but alas, having no special assistance from the
Spirit, what can they do? It may be they reason with the Temptation a little
while, and in their own strength resolve against it; but how easy a conquest
does Satan make, where no greater opposition is made to him, than this? Others
are bound to hear, meditate, and pray as well as you; else the neglect of these
duties would not be their sin: but alas, what pitiful work do they make of it!
Being left to the hardness and vanity of their own hearts; when you spread your
Sails you have a gale; but they lie wind-bound, heart-bound, and can do nothing
Spiritually in a way of Duty. Fourthly, And lastly, to mention no more, you
have a further advantage to this holy life, by all the rods of God that are at
any time upon you. I might show you in many particulars the advantages this way
also, but I shall only present these three to your observation at this time.


First, By these you are clogged, to prevent your straying, and wandering.
Others may wander even as far as Hell, and God will not spend a sanctified rod
upon them to reduce or stop them; but says let them alone, Hos. 4.17. But if
you straggle out of the way of holiness, he will clog you with one trouble or
another to keep you within bounds, 2 Cor. 12.7. Lest I should be lifted up, a
thorn in the flesh; a messenger of Satan was sent to buffet me. So David, Psalm.
119.67. Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I have kept thy Word.
Afflictions are used by God, as thorns by husbandmen to stop the gaps, and keep
you from breaking out of Gods way, Hos. 2.6. I will hedge up her way with
thorns, and build a wall that she shall not find her paths. A double alusion.
First, to Cattle that are apt to stray. I will hedge up thy way with thorns.
Secondly, to the Sea which is apt to overflow the Country, I will build a wall
to prevent inundations. Holy Basil was a long time sorely afflicted with an
inveterate headache, he often prayed for the removal of it; at last God removed
it, but in the room of it he was sorely exercised with the motions and
temptations of Lust; which when he perceived, he heartily desired his headache
again, to prevent a worse evil. You little know the ends and uses of many of
your afflictions. Are you exercised with bodily weaknesses, it is a mercy you
are so; and if these pains and infirmities were removed, these clogs taken off;
you may with Basil wish for them again to prevent worse evils. Are you poor?
why, with that poverty God has clogged your pride. Are you reproached? with
those reproaches God has clogged your ambition. Corruptions are prevented by
your afflictions. And is not this a marvelous help to holiness of life?

Secondly, By your afflictions your corruptions are not only clogged, but
purged. By these God drys up and consumes that spring of sin, that defiles your
lives, Esa. 27.9. By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and
this is all the fruit to take away sin. God orders your wants to kill your
wantonness. And makes your poverty poison to your pride. They are Gods Physic,
to purge ill humors out of your souls. When they fall by the sword, and by
famine, and by captivity, and by spoil, it is to try them and to purge them,
Dan 11.33, 34, 35.
and to make them white. They are both purges and Lavatories to your souls.
Others have the same afflictions that you have, but they do not work on them as
on you; they are to you as fire for purging, and water for cleansing; and yet
shall not your lives be clean? It Is true (as one well observes upon that place
of Daniel) Christ is the only Lavatory, and his blood the only fountain to wash
away sin. But in the virtue and efficacy of that blood sanctified afflictions
are cleansers, and purgers too.

A Cross without a Christ never made any man better; but with Christ, Saints
are much the better for the cross. Has God as it were laid you out so many
days and nights a whitening; and yet is not the hue of your conversation
altered? Has he put you so many times into the furnace, and yet is not your
dross separated? The more afflictions you have been under, the more assistance
you have had for this life of holiness.

Thirdly, By all your troubles God has been weaning you from the world, the
lusts, loves, and pleasures of it; and drawing out your souls to a more
excellent life and state than this. He makes your sorrows in this life, give a
lufter to the glory of the next. Who ever has, be sure you shall have no rest
here; and all that you may long more ardently for that to come. He often makes
you groan being burdened, to be clothed with your house from Heaven, 1 Cor.
5.4. And yet will you not be weaned from the lusts, customs, and evils of it?
Oh what manner of persons should you be for heavenly and holy conversations?
You stand upon the higher ground. You have as it were the wind and tide with
you. None are assisted for this life, as you are. Put all this together, and
see what this second argument contributes toward your further conviction, and
persuasion to holiness of life. Have you received a supernatural principle
fitting you for, and inclining you to holy actions, resisting and holding you
back from sin? Has God also set before you such eminent patterns to encourage
and quicken you in your way? Does the Spirit himself stand ready so many ways
to assist and help you in all difficulties, (...)

That bloody Tyrant was convinced in his conscience of the worth and excellency
of that servant of God, and was forced to reverence him for his holiness. So
Darius, Dan. 6.14, 18, 19, 20. What conflicts had he in himself about Daniel
whom he had condemned, his conscience condemned him, for condemning so holy and
righteous a person. Then the King went to his Palace, and passed the night in
fasting; neither were instruments of Music brought before him, and his sleep
went from him. He goes early in the morning to the D^n. and cries with a
lamentable voice, O Daniel servant of the living God. How much is this for the
honor of holiness, that it conqu^rs the very persecutors of it; and makes them
stoop to the meanest servant of God! It Is said of Henry the second of France,
that he was so daunted by the heavenly Majesty of a poor Tayl^r that was burnt
before him, that he went home sad, and vowed that he would never be present at
the death of such men, any more. When Valence the Emperor came in person to
apprehend Basil, he saw such Majesty in his very countenance, that he reeled at
the very sight of him; and had fallen backward to the ground, had not his
servants stepped in to support him. O holiness, holiness thou art a conqueror.
So much as you show of it in your lives, so much you preserve your interest in
the consciences of your enemies. Let down this, and they despise you presently,

Fifthly, And lastly, God will use the purity of your conversations to Judge
and convince the world in the great day. Cum ergo fideles sess^ri aicuntur cum
Christo, id intelligi debet nor de autoritate v^l potestate judicandi in ipsis;
sed (1.) de co quod, factari sunt in Christo capite suo. (2.) De approbatione
sententiae a Christo latae. Apoc. 19. v. 1.3. de eorum testificatione ratione
Ministerii and conversatio it is, and comparatione vitae eorum cum vita
injustorum, qua judicis justitia manifestabitur. Synops. purior Theol. p. 798.
It Is true the world shall be Judged by the Gospel, but your lives shall also
be produced as a Commentary upon it, and God will not only show them by the
Word how they ought to have lived, but bring forth your lives and ways to stop
their mouths, by showing how others did live. And this I suppose is intended in
that Text, 1 Cor. 6.2. The Saints shall Judge the world, yea, we shall Judge
Angels, that is, our examples are to condemn their lives and practices, as
Noah, Heb. 11.7. is said to condemn the world by building the Ark, (i. e.) his
faith in the threatening, and obedience to the command, condemned their
supineness, infidelity, and disobedience. They saw him every day about that
work, diligently preparing for a deluge, and yet were not moved with the like
fear that he was; this left them inexcusable. So when God shall say in that day
to the careless world, did you not see the care, and diligence, the holy zeal,
watchfulness, and self denial of my people, who lived among you? How many times
have they been watching and praying when you have been drinking or sleeping!
Was it not easy to reflect when you saw their pains and diligence; have not I
a soul to look after as well as they, a Heaven to win or lose, as well as they?
Oh, how speechless and inexcusable will this render wicked men, yea it shall
not be only used to Judge them, but Angels also. How many shocks of temptations
have poor Saints stood; when as they fell without a Tempter. They stood not in
their integrity, though created in such excellent natures; how much then are
you concerned on this very account also, to walk exactly! If not, instead of
Judging them, you shall be condemned with them.

And thus you see what use your lives and actions shall be put to, and are
these inconsiderable uses? Is the winning over souls to God a small matter? Is
the salving the honor and reputation of godliness a small matter? Is the
encouraging the hearts, and strengthening the hands of Gods poor Ministers
amidst their spending killing labors a small matter? Is the awing of the
consciences of your enemies, and Judging them in the last day a light thing?
Which of these can you call so?

O then since you are thus obliged to holiness of life. Thus singularly
assisted for it: and since there are such great dependencies upon it, and uses
for it both now and in the world to come; see that ye be holy in all manner of
conversation. See that as ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so ye walk in
him. Always remembering that for this very end Christ has redeemed or
delivered you out of the hands of your enemies, that you might serve him
without fear in righteousness and holiness all the days of your lives, Luke
1.74, 75. And to how little purpose will be all that I have preached, and you
have heard of Christ, if it be not converted into practical godliness? This is
the scope and design of it all.

And now Reader, thou art come to the last leaf of this Treatise of Christ, it
will be but a little while and thou shall come to the last Page or Day of thy
life; and thy last moment in that day. Woe, to thee, woe and alas for ever, if
interest in this blessed Redeemer be then to get. The world affords not a
sadder sight, than a poor Christless soul shivering upon the brink of Eternity.
To see the poor soul that now begins to awake out of its long dream, at its
entrance into the world of reallities, to shrink back into the body, and cry, O
I cannot, I dare not die. And then the tears run down. Lord, what will become
of me? O what shall be my eternal Lot? This I say, is a sad sight as the world
affords. That this may not be thy case, relfect upon what thou have read in
these Sermons; Judge thy self in the light of them. Obey the calls of the
Spirit in them. Let not thy slight and formal Spirit float upon the surface of
these truths, like a feather upon the water; but get them deeply infixed upon
thy Spirit, by the Spirit of the Lord; turning them into life and power upon
thee. And so animating the whole course and tenor of thy conversation by them,
that it may proclaim to all that know thee, that thou art one who esteemest all
to be but dross, that thou may win Christ.
