A PROCLAMATION Declaring the Letters of Mart formerly granted to George Carew
Esquire to be recalled.
CHARLES R.

WHereas George Carew Esquire had formerly granted unto him Letters of Mart against
the States General of the United Provinces, for Satisfaction of a certain
Demand which Sir William Courteen and others had against the said States, and
to which he the said George Carew was Entitled from and under the said Sir
William Courteen; which said Demand has since by Treaty of Peace between His
Majesty and the States General of the United Provinces, been totally abolished
and extinguished, and all Letters of Mart and Reprizal by the same Treaty
discharged accordingly; And whereas His Majesty has since, pursuant to such
Treaty, Recalled and Superseded under the Great Seal of England the said
Letters of Mart, and all Authority or Commission whatsoever to Equip or Set out
any Ship or Vessel by virtue of the same: To the end therefore, and that no
person or persons whatsoever be hereafter misled by the said George Carew,
under pretense of any Letters of Mart or Commission heretofore granted unto
him, and thereby incur the danger of the Law as Pirates, The Kings most
Excellent Majesty does by this His Royal Proclamation, (by and with the Advice
of His Privy Council) Publish and Declare, That the said George Carew has now
no Authority or Commission by virtue of any such Letters of Mart or Reprizal,
to Equip or Set out any Ship or Vessel whatsoever, and does hereby straightly
Charge and Command, that no person or persons whatsoever do hereafter presume
to be aiding and assisting to him the said George Carew, in Setting forth any
such Ship, nor Serve under him by color of any such pretended Authority, upon
pain of being proceeded against as Pirates, according to the utmost severity and
rigor of the Law.

Given at Our Castle at Windsor the 26th day of August 1680. in the Two and
thirtieth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
