The cunning Northern Begge^ Who all the Bystanders does earnestly pray, To
bestow a penny upon him to day. To the tune of Tom of Bedlam.
I Am a lu^^y beggar,
and live by others giving,
I scorn to work,
But by the highway lurk,
And beg to get my living:
I Will 'ith wind and weather,
And wear^ all ragged Garments.
Yet though I Am bare,
I Am free from care,
A fig for high preferments.
For still will I cry good your worship good sir,
Bestow one poor denier sir:
Which when I Have got
At the Pipe and Pot,
I soon will it cash^ere sir.
I have my shifts about me,
Like Prote^s ^ften changing
My (...) I will,
I (...) still,
Ab^^t the Country ranging:
As (...) I ^ C^atch s^e,
Or (...) by (...) riging,
I take my Cr^tch,
And (...) Co^ch,
(...) I lay abi^ing.
And still do I cry, etc.

I am a poor old Soldier,
And better times once viewed,
Though here now I go,
Yet many a ^oe,
By me has b^n subdued.
And therefore I cry, etc.
Although I nere was further
Then K^^tish street in Southwarke,
Nor ^re did see
A B^t^^ry
Made against any Balwarke,
But with my Tr^lls and Doxes,
Lay in some corn^r lurking,
and ne^^ ^^nt abroad
B^t to beg on the road,
To keep my self from working.
And always to cry, etc.
Anon I Am like a saylor,
And wear old Canvas clothing,
And then I say
The Dunke^ks away,
Took all and left me nothing:
Six ships set all upon us,
Against which we bravely ventured,
And long withstood,
Yet could do no good,
Our ship at length they entered.
And therefore I cry good your worship good sir
Bestow one poor denier sir:
which when I Have got,
at the pipe and por, etc.
The second part, To the same tune.
SOmetime I like a Criple
Upon the ground lie crawling,
for money I beg,
as wanting a leg
To bear my corpse from falling,
Then seem I weak of body,
And long to have been diseased,
And make complaint,
As ready to faint,
And of my griefs increased,
And faintly I cry good your worship good, sir^
Bestow one poor desire sir,
which when I Have got,
at the Pipe and Pot,
I soon will it casheere sir.
My flesh I so can t^mper,
That it shall seem to ^eister,
And look all over,
Like a raw sore,
Whereon I stic^s a ^^ai^^er.
With blood I (...) then,
To faigne the ^alling (...),
That (...) place
They pity my case,
As if it came throuh weakness.
And then I do cry, etc.
Then as if my sight I wanted,
A Boy does walk beside me,
Or else I do
Grope as I go,
Or have a Dog to guide me:
And when I Am thus accounted,
To the highway sid^ I hye me,
and there I stand
with cords in my hand,
And beg of all comes nigh me.
And earnestly, cry good your worship good sir
Bestow one poor denier, etc.
Next to some Country fellow,
I presently am turned,
And (...) alack^
With a child at my back,
My house and goods were burned:
Then me my Doxes follows,
Who for my wifes believed,
and along we^two
together go,
With such mischances grieved.
And still w^ do cry good your worship, etc.
What though I cannot labor,
Shall I therefore pine with hanger
No, rather than I
(...)here I lie?
I'l^ b^g of the money monger,

My m^nde, nor (...) me,

^Twill ^ut a w^ite disp^ea^^ me,
And still^ wi^^ try good your worship good^
Be^^^w one, etc.
No tricks at all shall escape me,
But I will by my maunding,
Get some relief
To ease my grief,
When by the highway standing:
It Is better be a Beggar,
And ask of kind good fellows,
A rid honestly have
What we do crave,
then steal and go to'th' Gallows:
Therefore I Will cry good your worshi^ good sir,
Bestow one poor denier sir.
