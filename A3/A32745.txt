Chastities Conquest, OR, No Trusting before Marriage.
A New Song,
You Virgins that your Fame and Honor prize.
Learn here by saving both, how to be wise.
Secure your Treasure till you have secured
The Purchaser and then you are insur'd
A thing that forehand freeness never procured.
To the Tune of, Can thou not weave Bone-lace.
This may be Printed. R P



Can thou not weave Bonelace,
yea by Lady that I can,
can thou not lisp with Grace
yea as well as any one,
Can thou not Card and Spin
yea by Lady that I can
And does other thing
we I'se do what I can
Come then, and be my sweet
To Bed I Will carry thee
No in Geud faith not a bit
Unless you marry me:
Marriage is not the mode
then I'se will make it so,
Duce of the common Road
I Will never forsake it so
Thou shall in me possess
all Ioys that can be had
Then give a consenting Kiss,
Then wed me first my Lad
Let us but gang to the Priest
So dear I tender thee.
Then Kiss on and do what you list
faith. I'se not hinder the


We shall soon weary grow
change will soon tire you
Ah do not tell me so
Since I admire you
For when I touch thy Breasts
thy charms so fire me
Yet needless is a Priest
Then come no nigher me,
For when you tempt me to bed
I'se no sick silly Fool,
But if you will buckle and wed,
then kiss your Belly full
If as you say you Love
make I'se your wedded Mate,
And you shall freely have
what ever you would be at
Will you not then my Joy
without you are wedded strike
No by my troth not I
Such loving I'se not like
But wedded my Arms shall bless
thy passion to the light
And with a consenting kiss
my Love to his Ioys invite.
Let Us no kind minutes wast
I Will lead thee to my Bed,
Where Loves delights we will taste
and so to morrow be wedded
Geud Faith I'se not agree,
I'se venture no such thing
Troth you are deceived in me
and must begin again
Come lay this Bashfulness by
your blushes I will hide
UUhat harm is it now to try
If you are to morrn my Bride.
I'se never yield to that
O don't desire me
To to the Dee'l knows what
Whoo'd then admire me
Well thou have won my Heart,
Thy Uirtues fire me
I Will wed and never part
As you require me
Soft murmurs and Sighs shall prove
What Ioys you render me
O Kiss then and surfeit one Love
Faith i'se not angry be.
