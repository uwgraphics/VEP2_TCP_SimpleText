Mr: HVGH HOLLAND On his worthy friend W:H: and his Triumuiri of Music.
List to that sweet Recorder;
How daintily this BYRD his notes does vary,
As if he were the Nightingalls own brother!
Lo, where does pace in order
A brauer BULL, then did Europa carry:
Nay let all Europe show me such an other.
Orlando though was counted Musicks fathr;
Yet this ORLANDO parallels di Lasso:
Whose triple praise would tire a very Tasso.
The^ here in one these three men hear you rather
And praise thaire songs: and sing his praise who married
Those notes so well which they so sweetly varied.
Mr: GEO: CHAPMAN In worthy love of this new worck, and the most Autenticall
Aucthors.
By these choice lessons of these Music Mastrs;
Ancient, and heightn'd with ye Arts full Bowls;
Let all our modern, mere Phantastique Tasters,
(Whose Art but foreign Novelty extolls)
Rule and confine their fancies; and prefer
The constant right, and depthe Art should produce;
To all lite flashes, by whose light they err;
This witty Age, has wisdom least in use;
The World, old growing, Old, with, it, grow Men;
Their skylls decaying, like their bodies strength;
Young Men, to oulde are now but Childeren:
First Rules of Art, increase still with their length.
Which see in this new worck, yet never seen:
Art, ye more oulde, grows eur ye more green.
