Arch. Primerose, Cler. Conven.

To the right Honorable, the Noblemen, the Commissioners of Shires and
Burrowes, assembled in the Convention of Estates at Edinburgh, June 22. 1643.
years, The humble remonstrance and desires of the Commissioners of the General
Assembly.
ACcording to the trust committed unto us by the General Assembly in this time
of so many difficulties, and so great danger to Religion and Peace, which have
exercised us this time past, and do still more and more press us above
measure, We have given warning to the whole Ministry, how to acquit themselves
against all sorts of Enemies to Religion and Peace: We have also by petition
made our humble address to the Kings most excellent Majesty, for remedying
the present evils, and preventing the like in time coming; Wherein we have had
the happiness to be countenanced and assisted by the Lords of His Majesty's
honorable privy Council, and the Commissioners for conserving the Peace: But
to our great grief have not found the success answerable to Our Endeavors and
Expectation; which is also resented in a late Declaration by the Lords of His
Majesty's privy Council, and the Commissioners for conserving the Peace, and
is now universally known to this whole kirk and kingdom: And therefore having
the opportunity of this Honorable Convention, representing the whole body of
the Kingdom, (wherein we humbly acknowledge the wise, timous and merciful
providence of God) we find our selves bound, both as the faithful Ministers
of Christ, and watchmen unto the house of Israel, and as Commissioners of the
Assembly, set after a special manner upon the watchtower at this time, to
give warning from God of the present dangers, and with all earnestness in the
name of God, to entreat your Lordships for a speedy remedy.

We need not make any Remonstrance to your Lordships of Romish Heresies,
Superstition, Usurpation and Tyranny; nor of the inestimable benefit of the
Reformation of Religion, which next unto the first planting of Christian
Religion it self, is the greatest mercy that ever God bestowed upon the world,
and is no less then a resurrection from the dead; nor of the many violent and
fraudulent ways which Antichrist has used in acquiring, preserving, and
propagating his Kingdom, and thereby has declared himself to be Antichrist
indeed. The Kirks and Kingdoms of Britain, France, Germany, and other places,
from the first time of Reformation to this day, bear testimony of his fraud and
violence: We only represent what great and mavelous things the Lord has done
for this Kirk and Kingdom of old, and of late, such as he has not been
pleased to do this day to any Nation under Heaven; which has been many times
matter of humble and thankful acknowledgement to our selves, of admiration to
other reformed Kirks, and of astonishment to the enemies of God; who
nevertheless in the invincible malice and hardness of their Hearts, have ever
been since the first beginning of Reformation, according to their own
Principles, by all their craft and might opposing and fighting against the work
of God. And although by the wisdom, power and good providence of God, they
have been many times disappointed of their ends, and their devices turned upon
their own heads; yet as enemies of all righteousness, and full of all subtilty
and mischief, do they never cease to pervert and resist the right ways of the
Lord: which has been formerly, and is at this day, the cause of many and great
dangers to our Religion, and to the peace and happiness both of King and
Country.

When we look upon the records of former times, As we perceive the Kirk of God
in this Kingdom in most of her national Assemblies to have entered in a deep
consideration of the dangers of the true Religion, of the causes whence they
did arise, and of the best and most effectual remedies, whereby they might be
removed; So do we find the principal dangers discovered by the general
Assemblies to be the same which at this time threaten our Religion and Peace.
One of them was from foreign invasion by Papists in Arms, or preparing forces
to come against this Island; Another was of intestine conspiracies and secret
plots of Papists and their assistants within the Kingdom; And the third was,
the ordinary resort of Papists to Court, their familiar admittance to the Kings
and Queens Majesty's Presence, and their preferment to places and employments
of Trust, with the slighting and neglecting of such as were known to be zealous
of the Truth and Cause of God against Popery and Corruption. In all which they
did wisely observe a threefold conjunction: First, That the safety of Religion,
and of the Kings person, crown and posterity, were inseparably joined, That the
danger of the one was also the danger of the other, That they did stand and
fall together, and had the same common friends and enemies, which was
acknowledged and professed by his Majesty that then was, with resolution to
assist by his power and royal Authority the endeavors of the Kirk for
preserving of Religion, and his Estate, against all foreign and intestine
practices of Papists and Apostats. Secondly, The conjunction of the safety of
the two kingdoms of Scotland and England, because in one Island, although under
diverse Princes, and that the danger from popish forces and conspiracies was
common to both, which was the ground of the general band of this Kingdom the
year 1588. and of the common band and union betwixt the two Kingdoms in the
year 1585. in their joint defense of Religion against the common Enemy.
Thirdly, the conjunction betwixt the Kirks of Britain, and all other Kirks,
professing the true protestant Religion with them, which was the reason of the
desire of a general League and Christian Confederacy of all Princes and
States, sincerely professing the Evangel, to be opponed to the ungodly
conspiracies of the enemies of Gods Truth.

Concerning these three sorts of dangers, we may truly say with the Preacher,
That which has been, is now, And that not so much by vicissitude and change,
as by continuance and succession of the same kinds of dangers to the true
Religion, which remains always the same, it being built upon the rock, and
therefore unalterable by the course of time. Yet the difference is so great,
that we ought thereby to be excited to the greater vigilancie: For first, The
dangers are by time grown greater then they were before: For now, the Papists
are in Arms within the Island, and that which was feared as a foreign invasion,
is now become intestine, felt within the bowels of England, and is at the
distance but of a few days march from our selves; And therefore in diverse
respects more dangerous to both Kingdoms, then the Armado, or any other
foreign invasion; The hatred of brethren being the strongest, and the
resistance being by division made the weaker: Now, the secret plots and inward
combinations of Papists and Malignants, which have been lately discovered, and
are more particularly known to your Lo. then to us, are much aided and
assisted, By those of the Prelaticall Faction, which answerably unto their
practices make open profession to join rather with the Papists then with us; By
Malignants and Dis-covenanters, who from no zeal to any Religion, but that they
may serve their own particular projects, do join their counsels with the
Papists, and really serve their ends; And by others, who have suffered
themselves to be drawn away, and divided from the straight way wherein they
were wont comfortably to walk; not upon design, but by the cunning of
Malignants, by enticements of Society, and by natural Relations, to cooperate
with them; who may well participate withthem in their pains, and (if they
return not quickly to their first love) in their punishments also; But if they
consider the intention of their Authors and Leaders, can have small hopes to
have any part or share in their intended rewards: Now, Papists, Prelates, and
Malignants, are not only about the Kings and Queens Majesty's, but also are
reputed to be the best Subjects, the chief supporters of the Crown, and
maintainers of Royal Dignity; And such as oppose Papistrie and Prelacie are
conceived to be either enemies, or not so good Subjects: Now, the bands of the
conjunction of the King and Reformed Religion are burst asunder, and a contrary
way of safety by Papists is provided and preferred: And now, contrary to the
Proceedings of all our Assemblies, to the resolution of the convention of
estates in the year 1585. and to all the remonstrances and declarations of this
Kirk and Kingdom, which have been many, since the beginning of our troubles,
no danger is apprehended to our Religion by prevailing of Papists of Papistry
in England: Against which, as being contrary both to sense and reason, the
Remonstrance of the classes of Zeland to the Estates there, speaks thus, We
esteem the destruction and weakening of the Reformed Churches in England, to be
the beginning of the ruin of all the Reformed Churches in whole Europe,
specially of Scotland, which shall not possibly escape the same estate of
Religion with England; And their letters presently sent unto us, speak to the
same sense. And there be three too pregnant and public witnesses, The invasion
1588. the Powder Treason Novem. 5. and the Service book 1637. all which were
intended against the Kirks of both Kingdoms, either immediately, or mediatly,
and by consequence. And thus your Lordships may perceive in all these
considerations the former dangers of our Religion to be at this time not only
continued, but mightily increased. Secondly, there is another difference, that
not only the old dangers are grown to a greater height, but new dangers unknown
in former times are multiplied against us: Arms are taken up by Papists, and
the Popish party, under pretext ofservice to the Kings Majesty: The Queen still
using all means with his Majesty, with the Subjects, and with Strangers, to
promove and settle her own profession against the Reformed Religion: Our hopes
expressed in our Supplication, of disbanding of Popish forces in England, and
of means to be used for the Queens conversion, all frustrated: Papists through
their success in Ireland, their power in England, and their expectation in
this Kingdom, daily growing to a greater strength, number and insolency: No
execution of the Laws against Papists, although excommunicated and denounced
Rebels; Whence it is, that they still reset Jesuits and Seminary Priests,
They travel where they will, armed with Carabins and Pistolls, to the terror
and seducing of poor People, and speak what they please of Religion, and of
the present troubles; And if any of them happen to apprehend danger here, they
sly into England, and find not only shelter, but advancement among the
Papists there in arms: And our Covenant (which is in the own nature, and was in
effect in former times a fortress and defense against Papistrie, and against
defection and division among our selves, is, to the great dishonor of God, to
the scandal, danger, and detriment of Religion, many ways violated,
neglected, and in some clauses quite forgotten, as if it had never been sworn
nor subscribed: Resolutions have been taken by common consent of the General
Assembly, of their Commissioners, of the Lords of privy Council, and the
Conservers of Peace, with the approbation of all the Presbyteries of the Land,
for sending of Petitions to the Kings Majesty, and Declarations to the
Parliament, for Unity in Religion, and Uniformitie of Church Government, as a
necessary mean for the preservation of our Religion and Peace: Yet contrary to
the Covenant, some have suffered themselves to be divided and drawn away by
suggestions or allurements from these common resolutions; Have cast in Lets and
Impediments to stay and hinder the same, so far have they been from
suppressing, or (as need did require) from making dangerous and divisive
motions known, that they might have been timously obviated; Have wrested words
of the Covenant by their sinister interpretations to their own ends, quite
contrary to the intention of the Covenant; And whether in their meetings and
combinations they have used any other mean directly contrary, or indirectly
prejudicial to the oath of the Covenant, their own hearts know, and the
Searcher of hearts will make known in his own time. It were a wonder if Papists
were not like themselves, working according to their own grounds and wonted
practices, for the liberty of their profession, at this time which seems to
smile upon them, and to flatter them with the promises of so many advantages:
But should it not seem als great a wonder, that any amongst us should be so
unlike to themselves, and to that which they professed to be at the renewing of
their Covenant, that (although it may be, different in intentions) they are
wittingly become fellow-workers with Papists, in hindering the desire of the
Reformation in England, and hazarding the settled Reformation here. When we
consider the ways of GOD, who often in his justice punishes sin with sin, we
have reason to fear this to be a spiritual judgment for the neglect of the
worship of GOD, common blasphemies, profanation of the Lords day,
unrighteousness, deceit, malignitie, adulteries, incests, all kinds of
uncleannes and excess of all sorts, with the forgetting of the affliction of
Gods people in other places, which bring on other sins, and threaten us more
then all the former dangers, we having of late so solemnly promised to live
soberly, righteously, and godly.

GOD has honored your Lordships, and this whole Kingdom represented by you,
to do great things for his Name; when now we have endured the heat of the day,
let us not weary in the evening, lest we lose our reward: Your noble and worthy
Predecessors had their own troubles and trialls in former ages, the present
are yours by divine providence. Great things are expected from this Kingdom
for the benefit of all the Reformed Kirks, especially of the Kirk of England,
unto which we have the voice of the Classes of Zeland (who in respect of our
near relation are but strangers unto England) at this very time inviting and
exciting us; And GOD has given us from bypast experience, great
encouragements for afterward: Faithfulness in the work unto which GOD calls
you at this time, shall be honor to the Kingdom, safety to the Kirk, comfort
in life and death, and a Crown of glory in the world to come, with which this
world has nothing of any weight or worth to compare.

All our desire at this time is, that your Lordships in your wisdom would
consider of the aforenamed dangers, and after they are found to be not
imaginary or counterfeit; but true and real above any thing that we have
expressed, your Lordships would against all differences and divisions, unite your
selves heartily and strongly in the cause of God, that it may once appear to
his Majesty, that our late Petition for Unity in Religion, and Uniformitie of
Church government, has proceeded from the united affections of this whole
Kingdom, And that your Lordships may be pleased to think upon the best and
most effectual remedies for the preservation of our Religion, which as is well
known to your Lordships, and has been often expressed in our Petitions,
Remonstrances and Declarations, cannot possibly be preserved, unless the
condition of Religion in his Majesty's other Dominions be seriously taken to
heart: And herein as your Lordships shall be pleased to require of us, we shall
most willingly contribute, what we our selves can conceive, or have learned
from the proceedings of the General Assemblies in the like cases. Likeas we do
now most earnestly beseech GOD to assist your Lordships by the good spirit of
Counsel and Peace, to cause the light of his glorious Gospel to shine in your
hearts, and to bless your meeting with a peaceable and comfortable conclusion,
to the rejoicing of all the People of GOD.
