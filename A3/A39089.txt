TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS JAMES Duke of York and Albany, Earl of Vlster, Lord High
Admiral of England and Ireland, etc. Constable of Dover Castle, Lord Warden of
the Cinque Ports, and Governor of Portsmouth, etc.
YOur Royal Highness having been graciously pleased to constitute me Judge or
President of the High Court of Admiralty, I held it my duty (according to my
poor ability) to assert the just Jurisdiction thereof, against those undue
encroachments and usurpations, whereby the power of the Lord High Admiral has
been heretofore, and is at this present straightned, in decision of matters,
relating to Maritime affairs; wherefore having some time since in those sad and
distracted times, bestowed some labor in searching and perusing such of the
Records of our own, as well as Foreign Nations as I could meet with, wherein
the just extent of the Admirals Jurisdiction is sufficiently and undeniably
evidenced, together with the necessity of deciding all controversies about
Maritime affairs, according to the ancient Sea customs, and the reason and
directions of the Civil and Maritime Laws. I held it no less my duty to
recollect the said Papers, and reduce them into some method for the clearing
those objections which hitherto have been and still are made use of, either
against the antiquity or extent of the Lord High Admiral his Jurisdiction in
Maritime causes, or against the decision of them by the ancient Sea customs,
and the rules of the Civil Law: And as I have observed this Nation has happily
flourished a long time, under that happy Government of all Land affairs by its
municipal Laws, practiced in the Common Law Courts; so has it no less
prospered and been enriched in its Navies, Trade, and Commerce under that exact
Government which has ordered and guided all Maritime businesses and Sea
affairs, by the Civil and Maritime Laws and Customs (corresponding, agreeing,
and according with the Laws of Foreign Nations, being suitable to the nature
and negotiations of the people that are subject to them) exercised and
practiced in the High Court of Admiralty: The design therefore that I propound
to my self in the publishing this Treatise, is, to show how necessary and
fitting it is, that the power and jurisdiction of this Court should be no
longer subject to such interruptions; and how expedient it now is, that the
rights and privileges of the same should be observed and kept, and the Laws and
ancient Customs thereof, whereby all Commerce and Navigation is upheld* should
be precisely and strictly preserved and maintained: That all which may appear,
I have set forth the antiquity of the Lord Admirals Jurisdiction here in
England, by ancient Records of the Tower: Next the Jurisdiction it self, and
the extent thereof, as also the necessity and necessary use of it in diverse
respects. In all which I have endeavonred neither to eclipse the honor, power,
or least right of the Muncipall Laws of this Kingdom, nor in any sort to
detract from the renown of the Reverend and Learned Professors thereof, but
hope I have manifested that the upholding of both Jurisdictions, and
restraining each of them to its proper limits and confines, will be more
advantageous to this Kingdom and the Inhabitants thereof, then the suffering
eitber of them to swallow up or devour the other. Be pleased therefore to
receive this unpolished work from the hand of your Servant as the same is
dedicated unto the protection of your Royal Self.

THE CONTENTS.
The Chapters contained in the First Book of the Maritime Dicaeologie or Sea
Jurisdiction.
Chap. 1. THe Antiquity of the Admiralty in England set forth so far as to
prove the same to have been settled and continued in and before Edward the
Thirds time, to whose time the Statute of the 13 of Ric. 2. refers, argued
from the antiquity of the High-Officers that exercised that Jurisdiction in
those times, and from their Grants and Patents. Page 1. Chap. 2. That these
High-Officers or Admirals, or Keepers of the Seas, Seacoasts and Ports, had
like power and authority in them, and over them, as the Keepers and Governors
of Land-Provinces had over them; and had their Maritime Laws for guidance of
their Jurisdiction, both Civil and Criminal, as well as the other had their
Land Laws for the guidance of theirs. page 10. Chapt. 3. The beginning of Sea
Laws, and the further Antiquity of Admirals, and their Jurisdiction from thence
argued, p. 13. Chap. 4. Of the Laws of Oleron, and the Antiquity of the
Admiralty argued and inferred from the introduction of them into England p. 16.
Chap. 5. The ancient Introduction of the Sea Laws argued, and inferred from the
King of Englands Dominion over the British Seas. p. 21. Chap. 6. The Antiquity
of the Admiralty argued and inferred from the defect and want of ability in
other Co^rts in deciding of Maritime Causes in those ancient times. p. 25.
Chap. 7. Of the Exercise of the Sea Laws by the Grecians, Athenians, Romans,
Italians, Venetians, Spaniards; and by the Admirals of Naples and Castile. p.
29. Chap. 8. Of the Admiral of France and Denmark. p. 30. Chap. 9. Of the
Admiral of Scotland. p. 32. Chap. 10. From the common acceptance of the Sea

The Chapters contained in the Second Book of the Maritime Dicaeologie, or Sea
Jurisdiction.
Chap. 1. THat the Sea-Jurisdiction and the Land Jurisdiction are, and so
necessarily must be, two different and distinct Jurisdictions, having no
dependancie each upon the other. Chap. 2. That the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty does extend to all manner of Ships, Shipping, Seafaring, and
Sea-tradingmen. p. 41. Chap. 3. That the Ports and Havens, and Creeks of the
Sea, are within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty. p. 52. Chap. 4. The
Arguments deduced out of the Statute Law, to prove the Ports, Havens, and
Creeks of the Sea, to be within the bodies of Counties, and not within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiraltie, redargued. p. 57. Chap. 5. The Argument deduced
from the first Judgment at the Common Law, that the Ports and Havens of the
Seas are within bodies of Counties, redargued. p. 62. Chap. 6. That from the
two other Actions instanced in, to be brought against the Parties suing in the
Admiralty Court for a business done upon the Ports, no concludent Argument is
deduced. p. 72. Chap. 7. The Argument deduced from two Praemunires instanced
in, to be brought against the parties suing in the Admiralty for things done
upon Ports, redargued. p. 73. Chap. 8. The Book-Cases and Authorities brought
to prove, that the Admiral has no Jurisdiction upon the Ports, Creeks and
Havens, answered. p. 78. Chap. 9. That the Rhodian and other Maritime Laws were
ordained as well for the decision of the differences happening upon the Ports
and Havens, as upon the high Seas. p. 102. Chap. 10. That the Laws of Oleron,
and other ancient Laws of the Sea were constituted and ordained as well for the
decision of controversies happening and arising from things done upon the Ports
and Havens, as from things done upon the high Seas. p. 111. Chap. 11. That by
the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty settled before the last confirmation of
the Laws of Oleron 12 Edw. 3. and Articles of Enquiry added thereunto, it is
plain that the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the Ports as well as upon the
high Seas. p. 115. Chap. 12. That by the Inquisition taken at Quinborough
secundo Aprilis, anno 49 Ed. 3. annoque Dom. 1375. it is plain that the Admiral
has Jurisdiction upon the Ports, as well as upon the high Seas. p. 120. Chap.
13. That by the ancient Statutes of Enquiry, translated out of French into
Latin by Roughton, the Admirals Jurisdiction is upon the Ports and Havens, as
well as over the high Seas. p. 124: Chap. 14. That the Civil Law is used and
practiced in all or most Nations of Christendom. p. 129. Chap. 15. That the
Traffic and Sea-trading is different from the bargaining and trading at land;
and that therefore in Foreign Nations they have their distinct Judicatories
guided by the distinct Laws; and that though the Judicatories for Land affairs
have in diverse Nations diverse Municipal Laws mixed with the Civil Law, yet the
Civil Law is strictly used and practiced in all Admiralty Courts, and is
absolutely nece^^ary in the decision of all Maritime causes and Sea
differences. p. 135. Chap. 16. That by several of the Laws of the Titles
selected out of the body of the Civil Law by Peckius, for the determination of
Maritime Causes, and diverse other of the Civil Laws conducing thereunto, it
does appear that the Ports and Havens, and businesses done thereupon, are
within the cognizance of the Admiralty Jurisdiction. p. 147. Chap. 17. That by
the Records of the Admiralty, it appears that the Admiral had, and has power
and Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens. p. 157. Chap. 18. That by Writs de
Procedendo out of the Chancery, upon Supersedeas from thence granted, the
Admiral is acknowledged to have Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens. p. 166.
Chap. 19. That by Consultations out of the Courts of Common Law upon
Prohibitions thence granted, it is clear the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the
Ports and Havens. p. 170. Chap. 20. That the Ports, Havens, and Harbors where
Ships do lie or ride at Anchor, are not within the bodies of Counties, but that
the Jurisdiction which the Admiralty has anciently had thereon, has been by
Act of Parliament reserved thereunto. p. 175.

cap. 5. to prove that Maritime Contracts, made at land concerning Maritime
affairs, are not tryable in the Admiralty Court, answered. p. 188. Chap. 3.
That by the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty, and by the Laws of Oleron, it
appears that Contracts made at land of and concerning Maritime affairs, were
cognizable and tryable in the Admiralty, both before, and even in the time of
Edward the Third, whereunto the last mentioned Statute makes reference. p.
193. Chap. 4. That by the ancient Inquisition taken at Quinborough in Edward
the Third's time, it appears that the cognizance of Contracts made at land
concerning Maritime affairs belonged then and before unto the Admiralty Court.
p. 202. Chap. 5. The Argument deduced out of the Statute of the 15th of R. 2.
cap. 3. to prove the Contracts made at land concerning Maritime affairs, are

the Contracts made at land concerning Maritime affairs, are not cognoscible in
the Admiralty, redargued. p. 216. Chap. 7. That the Admiral by these Statutes,
was not barred the cognizance of Maritime Contracts, though made at land, made
appear by the practice of those times, proved out of ancient Records remaining
in the Tower of London. p. 220. Chap. 8. That by other Records out of the
Chancery, Contracts made at land concerning Maritime Affairs are cognoscible in
the Admiralty Court. p. 229. Chap. 9. That by Consultations granted from the
Courts of Common Law at Westminster, after Prohibitions formerly from thence
obtained, Contracts made at land of and concerning Maritime businesses to be
agitated and transacted at Sea, beyond the Seas, or upon the Ports and Havens,
or of or concerning the same, are acknowledged to be cognizable in the
Admiralty, and have been thereunto by the same remitted. p. 234. Chap. 10. That
diverse and several of the Laws under the Titles selected out of the body of the
Civil Law by Peckius for determination of Maritime Causes; and other Laws
selected out of several other Titles, as subsidiary unto them, do set forth
most exactly the determination of Controversies, which may and do daily arise
from Contracts made at Land concerning matters to be done at Sea. p. 256.

The Introduction.
ALthough the soil of this Kingdom of England, wherein we are so happily and
in so plentiful a manner planted and settled, be so blessed with all sorts of
Fruits, that it has been accounted and esteemed as the very seat of the
Goddess of Fruit: Quod solum ejus ab omni frugum genere ita beatum ut Cereris
sedem fuisse, dixerit Orpheus: And been as it were the Barn and Storehouse of
victual and provision for the Western Empire; Occidentalis Imperii quasi
horreum and cella penuaria fuerit; and does abound with an innumerable
multitude of tame and profitable Cattle, flowing with milk, and full freighted;
and laden with Wools, that it seems not to need the help of any other
Countries or Colonies, nor any of their Commodities: Yet let us withal
consider how requisite and necessary the mutual correspondency, Commerce and
Trade has been, and is, for the exchange of such Goods and Commodities as this
abounds withal in so plentiful a manner, and may well spare, and others
want, for those which those others abound withal in as plentiful a manner,
and may spare and this wants; and what plenty, store, and increase has
arisen, and does arise and arise and accrue to all, and how much they have been
and are enriched thereby.

And it is not unknown what succor and relief this Nation, though so
plentiful, has oftentimes had and received from Foreign Nations, by the
importing even of such Commodities as this Nation has at other times abounded
withal, and does generally in a most plentiful manner abound: and the like
succor no doubt other Nations have received from hence, and one from another.
Hence it is that Pliny says (...), mercium commutatio victus causa inventa
fuit; this Commerce and Trade of exchanging Commodities for Commodities was
invented for man's livelihood: diversas igitur gentes commercio ita miscuit ut
quod genitum esset usquam, id apud omnes gentes natum esse videretur: Commerce
therefore has so mingled diverse Nations one with another, that whatsoever is
begotten anywhere should seem to be brought forth everywhere.

And it is most of all to be considered, if this Correspondency, Commerce, and
Trade, should not be upheld, maintained, and continued, how the Shipping,
Navage, and Navigation of this Kingdom (the wooden walls thereof) should be
sustained, since the benefit and profit raised and gained by such Commerce and
Trade, is the only incitement and encouragement to Merchants and Owners of
Ships to build them, and unto all Masters of Ships, Pilots, and other Mariners
to sail, serve, and be employed in them, and to others to addict themselves to
that course of life, to be trained and brought up therein, for the obtaining of
skill, knowledge and perfection in Navigation.

And we may well be assured, that if this benefit should cease, few or no Ships
at all would be built by private men in the time of peace, and but few by the
public for the service of war in the time of war; and those built in the
time of peace would lie by the walls and rot, their Tackle and furniture be
decayed and wasted, their Captains, Commanders and Mariners unaccustomed to the
seas and navigation, or else unskilful and unexperienced in sea affairs, by
which means this Nation would lie open to the violence of other Nations who
envy its prosperity.

If then the loss or discontinuance of the Trade, Traffic and Commerce of
this Kingdom with other Kingdoms, Nations and Commonwealths, may prove so
dangerous, how necessary will it be to keep and preserve the Laws of Nations
Civil and Maritime, the very Laws of Traffic, Commerce and Trade, whereby the
same (withal requisites thereunto appertaining) are upheld and maintained
complete and perfect, which is a point I must leave to be considered by my
loving friends the Merchants of England, Owners of Ships and Vessels, and
Sea-trading men that will spare but so much time as to read over this small
Treatise!

THE MARITIME DICAEOLOGIE, OR SEA-JURISDICTION.
CHAP. I.
The Antiquity of the Admiralty in England set forth so far as to prove the
same to have been settled and continued in and before Edward the Third's time,
to whose time the Statute the 13 of Ric. 2. refers, argued from the
antiquity of the High-Officers that exercised that Jurisdiction in those times,
and from their Grants and Patents.
FOR the antiquity of the Admiralty some have been of opinion, that it had its
rise, and received its first beginning but in Edward the Third's time; but from
whence this opinion should arise, or what should beget the same, I know not,
unless its exceeding flourishing at that time set a greater mark upon it, then
all its proceedings and employments for a long time before had done.

Some have derived its original from Edward the Third, upon this ground, that
he in the 49th year of his Reign, caused an Inquisition to be taken at
Quinborough, by persons which he caused to be called from several maritime
Parts of this Land thither, to consider of, and agree upon such articles, as
should be necessary and fit for the Enquiry, and making presentment of all such
crimes and offenses as should be committed upon the Seas, or upon any Port,
Harbor, Haven, or Creek of the Sea, conceiving that thereupon the Admiralty
Court was then set up, and not before.

To take away this last conceit in the first place, and remove this opinion, I
shall from that 49th year of Edward the Third, look backwards unto what was
done in all his time, and then by degrees derive its original far further
upwards, by so many Admirals Patents, and Records of the Tower (which I have
seen and perused) as shall only serve to set forth, and prove the continued
settlement of that Jurisdiction all his time, and from many years before
without endeavoring a perfect Catalogue of all such Admirals upwards, as I
find amongst those Records mentioned, and set forth, it making little to my
intent, or purpose, more then to enlarge that which I study to be brief in.

But he that will be curious therein, Spelm. gloss. v^^bo Admiral. p. 16.
may find as well those that were both in and before Edward the Third's time
briefly set down in Sir Henry Spelmans Glossarie under the title Admiral, page
16. as those that have been from the said Edward the Third's time unto the 16th
year of King James, from which time the rest that have been since constituted,
are easily collected. Those then which serve to my purpose are these.

I find that before the 49th of Edward the Third, Rot. ann. 45 ^d. 3. 1. part.
pat. m. 1.
a Patent of that Office of Admiral was granted to Guy de Bryenne ad parts
Occ^^^entales, anno 45 Ed. 3.

And another to John Nevill ad parts Boreales, R^^. ann. 44 Ed. 3. pa^te paten.
anno 44 Ed. 3.

And another to John Nevill and Guy de Bryenne then Knights the same year, Rot.
ann. eodem and eadem part paten.
both joined together in one Patent.

And another to Robert de Ashton ad parts Occidentales anno 43. Ed. 3. Rot.
ann. 43 Ed. 3. 1. part. paten. m. 15.


And another to Nich. T^mworth ad parts Boreales anno eodem.

And another to Ralph Spignevell for the keeping the Town of Dover, Rot. an.
38. Ed. 3. 1. part. pat. 10. m. 3. 4.
the Cinque Ports, and the Admiralty, ad parts Australes, Boreales, et
Occidentales anno 38 Ed. 3.

Next I shall here set forth a Patent at large, Rot. ann. 35 Ed. 3. 1 part.
pat. m. 32.
granted to Robert de Herle anno 35 Ed. 3. by which Patent it will plainly
appear, that the Office of the Admiral was then accounted an ancient Office,
and had an ancient, different, and distinct Jurisdiction from the Municipall
Laws of the Land. The Patent in the Tower Roll is thus set forth: Rex
universis et singulis Vicecomitibus, Majoribus, Balivis, Ministris, Dominis,
Magistratis, et Marinariis navium, ac aliis fidelibus suis, tam infra
libertates, qua extra, ad quos, etc. Salutem. Sciatis quod nos de
circumspectione et fidelitate dilecti et fidelis nostri Roberti de Herle
before confidentes, constituimus ipsum Admirallum nostrum omnium flotarum,
navium Australium, Borealium, and Occidentalium, quamdiu nobis placuerit,
Dantes ei plenam tenore praesentium potestatem, audiendi querelas omnium et
singulorum de hiis quae officium Admiralli tangunt, and cognoscendi in causis
maritimis, and justitiam fa^iendi, et excessus corrigendi, et Delinquentes
juxta eorum demerita castigandi, puniendi, incarcerandi, et incarceratos qui
deliberandi fuerint, deliberandi, et omnia alia quae ad officium Admiralli
pertinent faciendi, et ad alios, quos ad hoc idoneos noverit, quoties idem
Robertus vacare non poterit, ad omnia praemissa, et singula faciendum loco suo
substituendum et deputandum prout ei melius videbitur expedire; et ideo vobis
mandamus, quod eidem Roberto, et ejus deputato, in praemissis omnibus and
singulis faciendis, et exequendis, intendentes sitis, et respondentes,
quotiens, et prout idem Robertus, vel ejus deputati vobis vel alicui vestrum
fecerint, vel fecerit ex part nostra; in cujus, etc.

T. R. apud Westmonasterium. per ipsum Regem 26 die Jan.


Now amongst those that have been of opinion that the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty had its beginning in Edward the Third's time, Lambard Archeion tit.
Admiral page 42.
I find Mr. Lambert to be one, who in his Archeion says, that he thinks that
the decision of maritime causes was not put out of the Kings House, and
committed over unto the Admiral, until the time of Edward the Third; and his
reason is, for that (as he says) he never heard mention of it before the
second year of Richard the Second, who in his 13th year made a Statute to
restrain the Admiralty from meddling any further then it used to do in the time
of his Grandfather Edward the Third; where he heard mention of it in the second
year of Richard the second, he mentions not.

But he must give me leave, (who by this Record last mentioned, and by diverse
others have found mention made of it before such time as he heard mention of
it, and for diverse other reasons) to believe this Court to be far more
ancient then he thought it to be.

For if this Record be well observed, it will plainly appear that the Office of
the Admiralty was an ancient Office at the time of the Grant, which may easily
be gathered out of these words: Dantes ei plenam tenore praesentium potestatem
audiendi querelas omnium et singulorum de hiis quae officium Admiralli tangunt,
etc. and likewise out of these, et omnia alia quae ad officium Admiralli
pertinent, etc. from whence it appears that there was then a known Office of
the Admiral, not then lately instituted and ordained. And it will more plainly
appear, if we look further back to the Grants and Patents made unto others
throughout this Kings Reign, and other Kings Reigns before him, which being
deduced out of the Tower Records, will show this Office and Place to be of a
far greater antiquity: I shall therefore steer my course by degrees backwards
toward the confines of the antiquity of this Jurisdiction, although hopeless
to arrive there; yet I shall go as far by the ancient Records as will serve
for my purpose. Rot. an. 34 Ed. 3.

Third relates in the Dantes ei plenam tenore praesentium potestatem audiendi
querelas omnium et singulorum de hiis quae officium Admiralli tangunt, et
cognoscendi in causis maritimis, et justitiam faciendi, etc. et omnia alia quae
ad officium Admiralli pertinent faciendi, etc. prout in dictis literis.

These had their Patents from the same King, Rot. ann. 7 Ed. 3. 2. part. paten.
memb. 5.
as appears by their Patents themselves in the Tower Rolls: Rex omnibus ad
quos, etc. salutem: Sciatis quod nos de fidelitate probata, et circumspectione
provida dilecti et fidelis nostri Rogeri de Hengham plenarie confidentes,
constituimus ipsum Rogerum Capitaneum et Admirallum, etc.

And so had the last mentioned, Rot. ann. 1 Ed. 3. 2 part. paten. memb. 23.
constituted in the first year of his Reign: Rex omnibus ad quos, etc. salutem.
Sciatis quod nos de circumspectione et fidelitate dilecti nobis Johannis
Parbroun confidentes constituimus ipsum Capitaneum et Admirallum, etc. T. R.
apud Rocksborough 2 die Jan.

And by the same Patents they have potestatem castigandi, puniendi, etc. prout
justum fuerit, et hactenus consuevit, etc. in cujus, etc. T. R. apud Stanford
21 Aprilis, et mandatum est omnibus et singulis, etc.

Now to remove the first opinion, it is plain hereby that this Office of the
Admiral had not its beginning in Edward the Third's time, the Patents
themselves, all of them, as well these of the first year, as the other,
determining the power thereby granted with prout justum fuerit, et hactenus
fieri consuevit: so that it plainly appears by the words hactenus consuevit,
that this had been a settled Office before the granting of his very Patent in
the first year of Edward the Third: nor was this, and those of his time the
first Patents that determined the Admirals power, with a Prout justum fuerit,
et hactenus fieri consuevit.

For in the 20th year of Edward the Second I find Robertus Leybourne
constitutus fuit Admirallus versus parts Boreales: Rot. an. 20 Ed. 2. paten.
m. 15.
Et Nicholaus Kyrel versus parts Occidentales anno 19 Ed. 2. Rot. an. 19 Ed.
2. 1. part. pat. mem. 12.
both which Patents conclude with the same words; prout justum fuerit, et
hactenus fieri consuevit.

In the 15th year of the same Kings Reign Robertus Leybourn censtitutus fuit
Admirallus navium Regis super mari Occidentali, Rot. claus. 15 Ed. 2. Pat. 15.
Ed 2.
et Robertus Battalius, (alias Batallus) de singulis portibus versus Austrum.

Then do I find some styled Admirals, and others styled and constituted by
other titles.

As John Athy styled by the title of Capitaneus Navigii, Rot. an. 10 Ed. 2. 1
part. pat. m 22.
in the 10th year of Edward the Second.

Et Nich. Kirel constitutus fuit Admirallus, etc. versus parts Occidentales.

And in the 35th year of Edward the First, Rot. an. 35 Ed. 1 pat. mem. 38.
viz. Symo de Monte acuto assignatus fuit Capitaneus et Gubernator Flotae,
Navium, etc.

And in the year next preceding viz. Rot. an. 34 Ed. 1. pat. mem. 21.
in the four and thirtieth year of Edward the First, Gervasius Alard
constitutus fuit Capitaneus et Admirallus Flotae, Navium, quinque Portuum, et
aliorum Portuum, a portu Dover per Costram maris versus parts Occidentales,
usque in Cornubiam, atque totius Comitatus Cornubiae.

And Edwardus Charles versus parts Boreales usque ad villam de Berwick super
Tweed, et ejusdem villae.

Johannes Botetort constitutus fuit Custos regis portuum maritimorum versus
parts Boreales. Rot an. 25 Ed. 1. 1. part. pat. m 9.


Willielmus Leybourne constitutus Capitaneus marinariorum, Rot. an. 25 Ed. 1.
claus. endors. m. 18.
etc. Idem constitutus fuit Admirallus Angliae.

Now though Mr. Lambard did think the decision of Maritime causes was not put
out of the Kings House until Edward the Third's time, Rot. pat. 23 Ed. 1. 2
part. pat. Lamb. Archeion. tit. Admiral. page 42.
because (as he says) he found no mention of an Admiral before Richard the
Second's time; yet does it plainly appear by the beforementioned Patents, that
there were several Admirals, even up unto the three and twentieth year of
Edward the First. Though some of them went without that title, yet had they the
same office, and the same power, which together with the prout hactenus
consuevit, wherewith the before mentioned Admirals Patents are terminated and
concluded, has guided me further backwards, and led me to many others of more
ancient times, that have exercised that Office under diverse other titles, which
bear the same signification, though not the same appellation; nor do these
former titles (in my judgment) seem to carry any less power and authority
under them, then does the title of Admiral, or Capitaneus et Admirallus; but
seem rather to have conveyed unto the Admirals so styled, which have succeeded
in that Office, such power and authority as they have since exercised and used.

And here I shall set forth the parties that formerly bore this Office, and by
what names and titles they bore the same, before the title of Admiral was added
thereunto.

In the two and twentieth year of the said King Edward the First his Reign,
Rot. ^^scoyn. an. 22 Ed. 1. m 8.
Willielmus Leybourne constitutus fuit Capitaneus nautarum et marinellorum,
quinque portuum et membrorum eorundem. Et similiter Jesemuch Bayon Hiberniae,
Walliae, et omnium aliorum portuum et locorum, in quibus naves et Battalli
applicant infra regnum et potestatem Regis, etc. attested by the King at
Westminster the seventh of June.

In the 48th year of Henry the Third Tho. de Moleton constitutus fuit Custos
maris, Rot. ann. 48 H. 3. 1 part. pat. m 3.
portuum maritimorum et maritimarum partium: And in the same Patent, the Barons
and Bailiffs of the Cinque Ports, and all others of or belonging unto the
Maritime parts, are commanded to be attending, aiding and assisting unto the
said Tho. tanquam Custodi maris, et maritimarum partium; attested by the King
at Canterbury.

In the 19th year of the same Kings reign Hammon de Crevequor, et Wollerandus
Tutonick habuerunt custodiam quinque Rot. an. 19 H. 3. pat. m. 14.
portuum, cum costra maris a portu de Hastings usque ad portum de la-Pool, etc.
And their Patent is attested by the King at Canterbury the 10th of February.

In the 9th year of his reign Richardus Augillan constituts fuit Custos marinae
reg. Rot. an 9 H. 3. 2 part. pat. m 9.
Norfolcae, Suffolcae, cum omnibus pertinentiis suis: sc. Erewell, Oreford,
Dunwitch, Gernemouth, and Lynne. And the King in their Patents does command all
men belonging unto these Coasts to be attendant and obedient unto them in all
things thereunto belonging. The Patent runs in these general words: Rex
omnibus de costra maris Norfolcae, et Suffolcae, salutem: Sciatis quod
concessimus Richardo Aguillan marinam nostram Norffolcae et Suffolae cum
omnibus pertinentiis suis: sc. Erewell, Oreford, Dunwitch, Gernmouth, et Linn,
Custodiend. quamdiu nobis placuerit; et ideo vobis mandamus quod ei in omnibus,
quae ad dictam marinam pertinent, intendentes sitis et respondentes. T. R. apud
Westmonast. 3 die Octobris.

In the same year commisit Johanni filio Roberti and Ohoeli de Insula, Rot. an.
eod. H 3. claus. pat. m. 15.
parts and marinam Com. Northumbriae custodiend. quamdiu Domino Regi
placuerit; and mandatum est Vicecomiti Northumbriae, quod proclamari faciat pro
totam Ballivam suam, quod omnes eis in omnibus quae ad praedictas parts and
marinam pertinent, intendentes sint, and respondentes. T. R. 26. Aprilis.

In his eighth year commisit Johanni de Baosis marinam suam de Cornub. Rot. an.

Septembris.

Eodem modo scribitur omnibus de costra Dorcest. Rot. an. eod. and eod. loco.
pro Radulpho de Germam, qui illarum partium marinam habuit.

Richardus de Lucy dicitur habuisse marinam Angliae 29 Augusti. 2 part. pat.
and m. eod. anno.


So that it appears that those that bore this Office of the Admiral, before
that title was used, were sometimes called Capitanei Navigii, in respect of the
great power they had over all manner of Shipping: for (...), navigium, with the
French, Toute sort de navire; with the Italian, navilo, vassello; with the
German, ein jede gattung eines schiffs; with the Spaniard, nave del navio, is
omne genus navium quo navigamus, what sort of Ship soever wherewith we sail.
Navigium est genus continens naves, rates, and caeteras species quibus ad
navigationem utimur, says Spieg. And thus shall we find the word used
wheresoever we read it: Jamque qui aedificare velint Fabros and Architectos
advocent; Qui navigia mari concreders, gubernandi peritos qui bella moliri,
armorum and militiae gnaros; and, ne singula prosequar, ei studio quod quis
agere velit, Cic. de Not. Deor. lib. 2. F. de verb. oblig. l. qui Romae. 1.
consultissmum rectorem adhibeat; Cicer. de Not Deorum. So general is the word
for all manner of Shipping, that it is in that regard used for Navigation it
self: Sumitur tam pro navigatione ipsa, quam navi quacunque, says Oldendorp.
And so it is used sometimes in the Civil Law: Aliis mercibus emptis and in
navem missis, ipse in Syriam per navigium proficiscatur.

Sometimes they were called Capitanei and Gubernatores Flotarum, Navium, in
regard of their employment, in ordering and ruling of the Kings Fleet, employed
either against an Enemy actively, or for the defense of the Kingdom whenever
disturbed by an Enemy; and for his power in gathering together of whatsoever
Ships he thought fitting for raising of Navies, or supply of the defects of
those formerly raised, and the like.

Sometimes they were called Custodes Maritimarum partium, for that it was his
office and duty to see all the maritime parts and borders of the Sea
sufficiently provided of all things needful and necessary for the defense of
the Nation against a foreign Enemy; and so likewise furnished with all manner
of necessary provisions, for the entertainment of our own Ships, and Mariners,
and relief of the Kings Friends which should touch there in distress, that his
Subjects might receive the like upon the like occasion.

Sometime Capitanei Nautarum and marinellorum, for the power that they had over
all the seafaring men, in ordering them, and deciding differences which should
fall out amongst them, or between them and others with whom they dealt, or had
to do: And as a Captain and Commander ought not to suffer them to wrong any,
nor to be wronged by any.

Sometimes Custodes maris and maritimarum partium, in regard they were to see
to the furnishing of the Kings Ships at Sea, with Men, Victual, Tackle,
Furniture and Ammunition; sometimes adding to the strength of the Navy, by
furnishing out more Ships from the Ports to the Sea, ready provided with
necessaries, such as they found fitting for that service; and sometimes
withdrawing, or (if present in the Navy) discharging others as occasion
required. And as well to see to the ordering business upon the sea, as upon the
Coasts and Borders of the sea.

Sometimes they were styled Custodes marinae Regis, in respect they had the
keeping, ordering, ruling and disposing of all Maritime business, and Sea
affairs, which belonged unto the King himself, and concerned his Kingdoms
general good, or his Subjects particular benefit, and quiet, either amongst
themselves, or with Foreigners.

Which Title, as it was the first, I find born by the chief Officers for the
ruling and ordering all Maritime affairs, within such limits as were assigned
them by the King: so I conceive it comprehends as much power as the title of
Admiral; and either of these as much as any of the rest, and indeed as much as
all the rest: And yet I conceive too, that any one of the rest intentionally,
and as it was used, comprehended as much as either of these: But I shall not
here dispute what the power, authority, or jurisdiction of any of these
Officers was (which doubtless was the same) but shall defer that to another
head more proper for the debate.

I have here, so far as my line would reach, and my small skill in records
direct and guide me, followed the antiquity of these highest Sea-officers,
wherein, without doubt, I have in my way mist many things that might have been
pertinent to that I aim at: Yet have I (as I conceive) by records discovered a
continued employment of such Officers, without any intermission, or cessation
at all of that Office, even from the latter end of King Edward the Thirds time,
up to the eighth year of King Henry the Third: and so I have hitherto argued
the antiquity of the Jurisdiction, from the antiquity of the Officer. What this
Jurisdiction anciently was, will hereafter be disputed; in which dispute the
antiquity of the Admiralty will be further discovered.

CHAP. II.
That these high Officers and Admirals, or Keepers of the Seas, Seacoasts and
Ports, had like power and authority in them, and over them, as the Keepers and
Governors of Land-Provinces had over them; and had their Maritime Laws for
guidance of their Jurisdiction, both Civil and Criminal, as well as the other
had their Land Laws for the guidance of theirs.
THe next thing I observe, is that the preceding Officers, which this [prout
hactenus] led me unto, are most of them rendered unto us under the titles of
Custodes: As Custos maritimarum partium; De dominio maris, lib. 2. c. 14. ubi
citat. rot. pat. 6. Johan. Reg. m. 8. and pat. 8. Hen. 3. part. 1. m. 3. and 4.
claus. 9. Hen. 3. m. 15. pat. 9 Hen. 3. part. 2. m. 9.
Custos maris and maritimarum partium; Custos Portuum cum costra maris; Custos
marinae, Custos portuum and marinae: most of which Officers so styled, which I
had formerly met with amongst the Records of the Tower, I met with again in Mr.
Seldens book de Dominio maris, quoted out of the same Records; who from thence,
and some other good and sound reasons there expressed, infers Quod aperte
constat Reges Angliae praefectos constituere solitos, qui mare Anglicanam
custodirent, seu ejus custodes essent, sive praefecti, non aliter ac Provinciae
cujuscunque terrestris. They were to be keepers of the Seas in such wise, as
others were of every Land Province. Primo autem ( says he) mari, maritimae,
and marinae (idque ubi his vocibus, non regio solum maritima, sed ipse etiam
Oceanus Britannicus plane continetur (quod non semper fieri fatemur)
praeficiebantur qui tuerentur and custodirent nomine custodum (ut interdum)
navium, frequentius vero maritimae sensu jam dicto. Eodem cap. ubi citat. Rot.
Parl. anno 14 Ed. 3. art. 2.
To which he adds another further reason, and says, that primaria
Commitiorum Parliaementariorum ratio anno Regis Edvardi tertii decimo quarto,
est; de treter sur la guard de la pees de la terre, de la march d' escoce, and
de la mier^ ut tractaretur de custodia pacis terrae, and limitis Scotici, and
maris: from whence he observes, Quod non alia, tutelae maris quam telluris seu
terrestris provinciae, habebatur ratio.

And he gathers further ex tabulis ejusdem regis Parliamentariis, seu
consultationibus ordinum regni ( as he says) held upon the same matter, Eodem
cap. ubi cit. Rot. Parl. 13 Ed. 3. part. 1. art. 6 9. and 11. a Rot Parl. 20
Ed. 3. art. 21.
ut dum de la saufegard de la terre, seu custodia seu tutela telluris sive
insulae, and de la saufegard de la mere, seu de custodia maris consilium
pariter ineunt, tam hujus dominium, quam illius ad regem suum pertinere, a
majoribus edocti manifesto testari videantur.

For (says he) non de class solum agaunt, qua hostibus per mare resisteretur,
sed de ipso mari tuendo, aeque ac de tutela, insulae, adeoque de jure in
utroque regis avito defendendo, where he makes two distinct Dominions of the
Land and Sea, and the ancient right of either of them, to be defended and kept;
and there sets forth diverse who had the defending and keeping thereof in the
second of Richard the Second, and in the time of the three Henry's succeeding
him, with many other things there worth noting and observing.

He observes further in the same Chapter the common and received acceptance of
this term Custos amongst the English in other Governments, Eod. cap. ubi cit.
Rot. Cart. 2. Jo. R. in dors. and Rot. pat. 17 Jo.
both of this Land, and other Islands, and even at that time when the name or
term of Custos maris was most frequently used; and he instanceth in the
Governors of Ireland in the time of King John and Edward the Third, who were
then severally styled Custos Hiberniae.

He instanceth likewise in John Duke of Bedford, Eod. ca. ubi cit. Th.
Walsingh. an 14. to. etc. Rot. Parl. 8 H. 5.
and Humphry Duke of Gloucester, who had, one at one time, and another at
another, the Government of England, when King Henry the Fifth was absent in
France, who were called Custodes Angliae, quod (says he) tum in historiis, tum
in tabulis publicis saepissime occurrit.

And likewise in Rot. pat. 8 Hen. 7. part 8.
Arthur Prince of Wales, who was made Custos Angliae, when King Henry the
Seventh was gone out of England.

And in Peter Gaveston, who was Custos Angliae, Edward the Second being busied
in France. And also the in Governors of Ibid ex rot. pat. 3. Hen. 3.
the Isles of Jersey and Gernsey, who of ancient times were Custodes of those
Islands, as they are now called Gubernatores, Custodes, and Capitanei.

And seeing it is so, how can it be (says he) that we should not think that
our Ancestors used under the same notion or term of Custos and custodia, the
Custodes Maris, and the Custodes Insulae, etc. Quod cum ita sit, quomodo fieri
potest ut non eadem notione vocabuli Custodis and Custodiae majores nostros
usos esse existimemus in Custodis and Custodiae maris nomine, qua in Custodia
Insulae, and caeteris jam dictis dignitatibus uti solebant? sc. in hisce
omnibus dominium imperiumque singular praeficientis apertissime ita signatur
includiturque, adeo ut non magis authoritas in personam quae praeficitur, quam
rei custodiendae dominium nomine hoc plane innuatur.

If then there were Custodes Maris, Marinae, Portuum, and Maritimarum partium,
and that in such manner as of a Land Prince, non aliter ac provinciae
cujuscunque terrestris; Then will it necessarily follow that if a Prince, that
ever was civilized by the dominion and rule of a Civil Governor or Governors
(for by such means and no other are all Nations, Princes, Islands, and the like
become civilized and ordered) could not so continue civilized and ordered
without Rules and Laws for every man's demeanor to be guided by.

That the Seas having anciently been used for Maritime affairs, for free and
peaceable Traffic, and Commerce, one Nation with another which be friends, at
unity, and in concord; and for Martial Fleets and Navies for the defense of
every Kingdom against an Enemy: And so anciently under the dominion of Civil
Princes (as under their Dominion and Government of a Civil Land Province) must
necessarily have had settled and known Laws, suited and fitted for such their
Dominion and Government, which could be no other then the Maritime Laws so
agreeable unto Sea-affairs, and so commonly and anciently accepted, and agreed
unto by most Nations and Kingdoms which have had such free Traffic and
peaceable Commerce upon, and by them, one with another, to guide and direct
these Custodes in the ministering of Justice in Sea-businesses, as well as the
Governors of Land Provinces have had their Land Laws for the ministering Justice
in Land-affairs. Hence Spelman in his Glossarie, having reckoned up all the
Admirals from the eighth year of Henry the Third, unto the 16th year of King
James, says, Nos de munere caduco aut extraordinario non agimus, at de summo,
stationarioque magistratu, qui universae marinae reipublicae praeest, suoque
^oro and amplissima jurisdictione tam in causis civilibus judicandis, quam in
class Regia gubernanda insignitur. Spelm. ead page scil. 16.
And further says that we had the name of this Magistracy, viz. Custos Maris,
Marinae, and Maritimarum partium from the Romans, Cicer. Ep. ad Attic. lib.
as may be gathered from Cicero in Epistol. ad Attic. ubi ait; vult me Pompeius
esse quem tota haec maritima ora habeat (...), i. e. speculatorem and custodem.

CHAP. III.
The Beginning of Sea-Laws, and the further Antiquity of Admirals, and their
Jurisdiction from thence argued.
Dionysius ascribes the first making of Sea-laws to the Phenicians, Di^n. de
(...) orbis.
Pliny to the Carthaginians; Plin. lib. 7. naturalis Historiae. Rhodiae leges
distin^t.
but according to the observation of most Authors out of most ancient
Monuments, our Sea-laws have had their beginning and original from the Island
Rhode. Rhodiae leges navalium commerciorum, sunt ab Insula Rhodiae
cognominatae, in qua antiquitus mercatorum usus fuit: an Island situate in the
Carpath. Sea, part of the Mediterranean, which being but a small Island, but
yet very populous, the Inhabitants, yea the very Indwellers thereof chose
rather to live by water then by the air, and to seek their subsistence, and
provide for their sustenance by constant sailing, and continued navigation;
Gell. lib. 7. cap. 3.
by which means they increased their strength, and augmented their power at
Sea, to the terror of all their Enemies, the hinderers of their Traffic, and
quelling of all Pirates the disturbers of their peace. They multiplied their
riches with an infinite increase, and advanced their wealth to the very height.
Strabo Geograph. lib. 1. 2. cap. 14.
And these principal ground-works being laid, and chief foundation settled,
that which makes principally to the purpose in hand, they grew so exquisite in
their Navigation, so skillful and cunning in their Traffic, and so expert in
the discipline of both, that as time now required, they framed Edicts to be
instituted, decreed, and published, to be established and observed for Laws,
for the guidance of all men according to the most exact rules of equity in all
manner of Sea-businesses; insomuch that all Cities and Nations near unto them,
therein sought knowledge of them; and to the further increase of their riches,
by a ready and willing Tribute, still exchanged wealth for wisdom, and thought
not that they paid any what too dear for the gain of such knowledge, and to be
directed in the rules of such Discipline and Laws as might settle such a
constant determination of every man's just right at all times, in all manner of
Traffic, Trading and Employment, upon and by the seas, as the Islanders had,
which Laws and Discipline did afterward spread to further Nations, and the
very Emperors of Rome did successively refer all seafaring Debates and
Controversies to the Decrees, Determinations, and Judgments of the Rhodian
Law. F. ad leg. Rhod. in princ.
Leges nauticas dicimus quas Rhodii condiderunt; quorum disciplinam navalem and
ut Strabo ait, (...) admirabilem, omnes populi libenter, etiam Romanus
sequebatur. F. ad leg. Rhod. l. 9. (...).
And Eudaemon Nicomediensis making his complaint to Antoninus, thus: (...):
Domine Imperator Antonine, naufragium in Italia facientes, direpti sumus a
Publicanis Cyclades Insulas habitantibus. Antoninus answers thus: (...). Ego
quidem mundi dominus. Lex autem maris, Lege id Rhodia, quae de rebus nauticis
praescripta est, judicetur, etc. Hoc idem quoque Divus Augustus judicavit. Yet
be there several other titles in the body of the Civil Law, which set forth
several Decrees and Laws particular to the Seas, and seafaring matters to be
observed: And Vlpian, a Father of the Law, having set down some of them, gives
his reason why they should be precisely kept and observed; Quia (says he) ad
summam rem-publicam navium exercitio pertinet. These Rhodian Laws, what of them
are left and inserted in the Pandects, and their defects being supplied by the
Code, and novell Constitutions, and their Rents repaired by the fair
Applications and candid Expositions of the old Roman Lawyers, and other
authentic Authors, which have since wrote of matters of that nature, still
give the rule and guidance to all seafaring business, of what nature soever,
throughout all, or well nigh all Europe, and have never been opposed,
obstructed, or interrupted, but by such as least understood them.

And these severally had their original from that Island of seafaring men,
Constat ex legibus ipsis Rhod^is and a^is ex corpore ju^u collecti^.
though they have been by successive observations, collected and gathered
together, as most just and equal for the determination of every man's just due
and right in all their Maritime affairs, whether they concerned complaints,
offenses Criminal or Civil, Sales or Assecurations of Ships, Accounts,
Covenants, or Contracts by Charter-party or otherwise, Exchanges, Freights,
Hyres, or Money lent upon casualty or hazard at sea, Causes of Reprizals,
Letters of Marque, or concerning lading or un^ading, and whatsoever other
things else among seafaring men, either of one or several Islands or Nations,
done or to be done, either on or at the sea, concerning Sea-trade.

Now who shall be imagined to have the supreme governance and power over these
seafaring men, and the cognizance of their Maritime causes, to judge them
according to these Sea-laws established amongst them, and duly to put them in
execution?

Certainly these Laws were hatched of order, and could not be bred up to
disorder: Seamen surely had amongst them a supreme Governor, one or some that
swayed and ruled the rest in the composure of them; and so must they
necessarily have in the dispensing of them, and administering justice according
to them.

Now I hope it will not be said that the maritime and seafaring men contrived
and made Laws amongst themselves, which concerned themselves, their Traffic,
and Trade; and when they had done, gave them over into the Land men hands
(which could not possibly understand the grounds and depth of them) with a
power to put them in execution, and so give others a power over themselves,
which before had nothing to do with them. If they would so have done (which no
man will judge) yet it is not to be believed, that in this Island of Rhodes
they could, which consisted generally of seafaring men.

Who should then be fit to be chiefest in managing these Laws, but such a one
as had chiefly a hand, and was most dexterous in making of them: so that I
doubt not, but that we may boldly say and conclude, that as these Laws were
composed, gathered, and collected by maritime and seafaring men, so were they
put in execution by the principal Governor and Ruler of them: and so had they
both birth and growth under the jurisdiction, rule, and governance of the chief
Captain, Commander and Governor over all these seafaring men and shipping. And
as Causes increased and multiplied, so did the Laws, according to the nature of
the Causes; and as the Causes varied, so did the Laws, until they required the
constant and continual study of such as were to judge by them.

CHAP. IIII.
Of the Laws of Oleron, and the Antiquity of the Admiralty argued and inferred
from the introduction of them into England.
AS these Sea-laws before mentioned had their beginning, and the government by
them, sprang from the Island Rhodes upon the Mediterranean Sea; so the other
Sea-laws there are extant, which had their beginning from an Island upon the
great Ocean, and it is called Oleron, situate on the seacoast of France
against the mouth of Charant, and the Maraes, nigh St. Martins, and not far
from the entry of Wellwood in p^ohem.
Garunana.

This Island likewise consisting altogether of skillful and experienced men, as
did the other, could no more subsist or proceed happily and prosperously in
their maritime affairs then could the other, without such government as the
other had.

And they being not altogether ignorant of the Rhodian Laws, nor yet very
perfect in them, and other new differences and controversies arising and
supervening, which they could not judge or determine by the Rhodian Laws, they
observed certain other Rules and Customs together with those Laws, whereby
they decided such differences, and determined such debates, as fell out and
happened amongst them.

Which Rules and Customs King Richard the First, in his return from the
Holy Land (having then the power and Government over that Island of Oleron)
caused to be interpreted, settled, and published for Laws there; and having so
settled them there, and afterward coming into England (if we shall still doubt
of the acceptance and settlement of the Rhodian Laws here, at or before that
time) yet let us not make any question but that he brought those Laws of Oleron
hither with him, and here settled and declared them for Laws, for the rule and
government of his maritime Subjects, and doing justice amongst all people of
what Nation soever, according to those Laws, as will plainly appear out of the
Roll of the Articles, upon which the Kings Justices in Edward the Third's time
were to advise: where it is said thus:

Item ad finem quod resumatur and continuatur ad subditorum prosecutionem sorma

Consilium ad retinendum and conservandum antiquam superioritatem maris Angliae,

12. Ed. 3.
la ley Oleron.

Hence as it appears that King Richard interpreted, declared, and published
these Laws called the Laws of Oleon, in that Island; so does it plainly appear
that he ordained and established them here, by these words: Ad conservandum
leges and statuta per ejus antecessores Angliae Reges dudum ordinata: per ejus,
i.e. avi sui, prius nominati; by his Predecessors; and it does plainly appear
by that in the close, that Richard the First must necessarily be one of them.
And hence likewise it does appear, that with the settlement of these Laws,
there was likewise a settlement of a form of proceeding according to those
Laws: for says this Record in prin. Ad finem quod resumatur and continuetur ad
subditorum prosecutionem forma procedendi quondam ordinata and inchoata per
avum, etc. hoc est and inchoata resumi, etc. which must be the construction, as
the words following make it plain, which are ad retinendum and conservandum:
for reteining and conserving denote something to be retained and preserved that
was before. Now for the publishing and settling these Laws, and ordaining a
form of proceedings in the prosecution of them in Richard the First's time, I
conceive I may safely conclude an Admiral and Admiralty Court to have been
settled before, and continued at the same time, unto which he added some more
exact proceedings, together with these Laws of Oleron, as several Statutes are
daily added, either in affirmance, or correction of the Common Law; and my
reason is because these Laws) without the Rhodian Laws, and those other Laws
made in supplement of them) are in no wise a complete Law for the guidance and
direction of an Admiralty Court. And it may further appear, that unto the
settlement of these Laws, this King himself added Ordinances of the Admiralty:
one of which I shall here set down, which he made at Grymsbie. The words
follow. Item Lib. nigr^ Admir. page 28.

The same ordinance being set forth in another ancient French copy of
Articles, wherein diverse other Ordinances were likewise set forth, was by one
Roughton translated into Latin in these words, viz. Item Lib. nig. Adm. artic.
39. page 157.

recordo.

This observation may very well be gathered from these Records that Richard the
first did (doubtless) settle some things in this Jurisdiction, and preserved it
during his time: And I may observe further, that the same were continued in the
time of King John, who likewise added Ordinances unto the said Laws, as may
likewise appear by the ancient Articles of Enquity adjoined unto the ancient
Statutes of the Admiralty, in one of which find it thus expressed. Item Lib. nig.
Admir. page 31.

And by Rougbtons Latin Translation out of the other ancient Articles of
Enquiry I find it thus set forth, viz. Item Li. nigro Admir. Artic. 36. pa. 155.
Inquir. de portuum custodibus sive aquae ballivis, qui clamant sive incipiunt
de novo novas custumas pro commodo suo proprio sive dominorum suorum, unde
naves, and mercatores, portus and loca hujusmodi, una cum mercandesis

sive Ballivi si indictati fuerint super hoc and convicti, imprisonamentum
dimidii anni habebunt: finem nihilominus Domino Regi facturi ad valentiam in
hoc casu praecepti, ei qui hujusmodi si usui suo proprio convertatur
praeceptis. Sin autem ad usum dominorum suorum pervenerit imprisonamentum
dimidii anni, ut praefertur subibunt, and Domini sui de fine very valoris in
hac part Domino Regi propter hoc respondebunt; and nota quod liceat
mercatoribus necessitate urgente, vendere percellas mercandizarum pro expensis

ordinationem Johannis quondam Regis Angliae apud Hastings. Et si aliqui
Custodes vel Ballivi contrar. hinc ordinationi fecerint, imprisonamentum
dimidii anni habebunt, and perpetuo ab officio eorum hujusmodi sint
suspendendi. But in King Henry the Third's time it had received so much
interruption, that the vigor and force thereof was well nigh lost, insomuch
that Edward the first was constrained, inchoata^ formam procedendi quandam and
ordinatam resumere, who likewise added certain Ordinances unto the said Laws,
as you may read hereafter, which tend very much to the preservation of that
Jurisdiction; which work being not fully perfected, soon began to decay in
Edward the Second's time (whereby it may seem that that Jurisdiction never
wanted Enemies) which withdrew its strength, and abated its power, until the
necessity thereof appearing in the decay of Navigation, and thereby of Trading
and Commerce; and of want of strength in Shipping for the defense of this
Kingdom against foreign Forces and Enemies, still revived it, and restored
unto it what had been withdrawn from it, which was the cause (without doubt)
that caused Edward the Third to proceed in that good work, which his great
Grandfather had begun: Ad interpretandum, declarandum, and conservandum leges
and statuta per avi sui antecessores Angliae Reges dudum ordinata, etc. as the
aforementioned Record sets forth; after which, in his time, it so revived and
flourished, that it might very well seem a new birth, from whence some have
conceived it to be the first birth, and to have its beginning there, but upon
no other ground at all.

I have hitherto only endeavored the proof the Antiquity of this Jurisdiction,
which will more seasonably follow when I shall enforce the necessary use of the
forementioned Laws, those which sprang from the Rhodes, suppleated out of
several other titles in the body of the Civil Law; and those which have been
derived from the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty, the Laws of Oleron, etc.

Which of these Laws were first introduced into this Kingdom I shall not
dispute; this I shall only say, that they altogether make an exact and complete
rule for the government of all seafaring or sea-trading men, and matters, and
have been here anciently and frequently used, and elsewhere, throughout most
parts of Europe.

Diverse others have been said (since the making of the Rhodian Laws) to have
made new Sea Laws; as the Rulers of Rome in 1075th year; and since that
Marseilles, Genoa, Peloponnesus, Venice, Constantinople, Constantine, and
Barcellona in several years: But the Roman Empire having (not long before that
time) been as it were rent and torn in pieces, their Laws for the Land, and
Land-affairs laid aside, and their Laws for the government of the Seas quite
subverted, and well nigh lost, some of these Nations were constrained to
recollect and gather together such parts and parcels as could be well made up
into one body again, with some small cement of our own, and might better be
called a reparation of their old Laws, then a structure or edifice of new. For
the rest, some say they are additional, some say explanatory to remove false
constructions and interpretations, and some say both: but certainly for the
most part they are but explanatory; for the other Laws before mentioned, are
accounted most authentic, and of chiefest authority throughout all, or the
greatest part of Europe. But be these additional, yet the addition of Sea-laws
to Sea-laws is no diminution of Sea-Jurisdiction, but rather a completing and
perfecting thereof: but the composure of new land-Laws, or if it be but the
reformation of old, if those Laws look but toward the Sea, they oftentimes
cause the discomposure of Sea-laws, and unless well looked unto, the very
destruction of that Jurisdiction: but of that more will appear by what shall be
said hereafter.

And now before I proceed to any other argument for the proof of the antiquity
of this Jurisdiction, I shall give you one reason only, which induces me to
believe, that the same was settled long before the time before mentioned, and
that the Rhodian Sea-laws were here settled long before the Laws of Oleron by
Richard the First; and that is an Ordinance made by Henry the first at Ipswich,
concerning the banishing a man for Felony or Trespass, which I find mentioned
in an Article of the ancient Inquiry of maritime offenses annexed unto the
ancient Statutes of the Admiralty in the ancient Parchment-leaved Book, called
the black Book of the Admiralty, where, after the manner of such banishment is
set forth, it is said: Et Lib. nig. Adm. page 27.
ceste ordonnance fat faitte primerement a Gyspswiz ou temps du primer Roy
Henry per les Admiralx de North and West, and autres Seigneurs adheirdantz.

CHAP. V.
The ancient Introduction of the Sea-laws argued, and inferred from the King of
Englands Dominion over the British Seas.
THat the Kings of France have no Dominion at all over the British Seas, or any
right or claim thereunto whatsoever, is made plain by what is Seld. de dom.
maris, l. 2. c. 14. 27, 28.
set forth in the 14th Chapter of the second book De Dominio maris, written by
Mr. Seldom, who in his 27th and 28th Chapters of the same Book proceeds to make
further proof thereof, and therein sets forth, that there being war between
King Edward the First of England, and King Philip the Fair of France, but
agreed by Covenant, that all Commerce on both sides shall be free; so that to
all Merchants whatsoever there should be induciae, which were called
sufferantia guerrae: and by both of them Judges were appointed that should take
cognizance of all things done against these Truces, and should exercise judicia
secundum legem mercatoriam and formam sufferantiae. Now it being contained in
the first head of this League, that they should defend each others rights
against all others, this afterward was the ground of an action which was
instituted in the same Kings time, etc. before these Cognitors chosen by both
the said Princes, by the Proctors of the Prelates, Nobility, and high Admiral
of England, and of all the Cities, Towns and Subjects of England, etc. unto
which are joined the Proctors of the most maritime Nations throughout Europe,
as of Genua, Catalonia, Spain, Alemania, Zealand, Holland, Frise, Denmark, and
Norway, and diverse others subject to the Roman Empire, against Reginer Grimbald
the then Admiral of France; for that there being Wars between Philip King of
France, and Guy Earl of Flanders, he had taken Merchants upon those Seas, in
their voyage to Flanders, and dispoyled them of their goods, whereas the King
of England, and his predecessors, as they all jointly by libell do declare and
affirm without all controversy, beyond the memory of man, have had the
supreme Government of the English Seas, and the Islands thereof: Praescribendo
Seld. de Dom. mar. lib. 2. cap. 27. juxta medium.
scilicet leges, statuta atque interdicta armorum, naviumque alio ac
mercatoriis armamentis instructarum, cautiones exigendo, tutelam praebendo,
ubicunque opus esset, atque alia constituendo quaecunque fuerint necessaria ad
pacem, jus and aequitatem conservandam inter omnimodas gentes tam exteras quam
in imperio Anglicano comprebensas, quae per illud Transierint; supremam ^sdem
item fuisse atque esse tutelam; merum and mixtum imperium in juredicendo
secundum dictas leges, statuta praescripta and interdicta, aliisque in rebus,
quae ad sumumm imperium possint attmere in locis judicatis; Ad praefecturam
Admirallorum a Regibus Angliae constitui solitorum spectare jurisdictionem ex
imperio ejusmodi exercendam. And he sets forth further in the same Libel, that
they do all of them together desire ut a custodia Id. eod. loco. postea.
liberati, qui carceri ita traditi essent, reddita item bona nullo jure capta,
jurisdictionem Admiralli Regis Angliae ( ad quem solum tam ex jure rerum ac
loci, quan personarum hujusmodi jurisdictio attinebat) subirent. These things I
have cited out of Mr. Seldom not only to show here for my purpose, that the
Kings of England have had from ancient times the power and dominion over the
British Seas; (for then might I have referred the whole matter to his whole
book, which does so learnedly, so many ways, and by so many several arguments
convince in that point) but as well to show that the Kings of England's
Admirals have likewise as anciently had jurisdiction under them, over those
maritime affairs, which fell sub isto regimine and dominio.

And also to show that so many Nations did concur and agree therein; and that
they had istud regimen and dominium exclusive of the Kings of France bordering
upon the same seas, and of all other Kings and Princes whatsoever; for they all
likewise jointly agree, an usurpation, and interruption of the King of
England's right of Dominion over these Seas by the King of France, in granting
a Patent of the Admiralty of the Seas unto his Admiral Reginer Grimbald, and
therefore all jointly proceed in their Petition further: Vt Idem Eod. etiam
loco.
cognitorum sententia Reginerus Grimbaldus ipsa damna Actoribus resarciret, si
nimirum solvendo esset; sin minus, tunc ut ad idem faciendum damnaretur Rex
Franciae, qui ejusmodi praefecturae codicillis eum donasset: Damnis autem
resarcitis, tum etiam Reginerus ob foederis violationem poenas daret, quales
alios a simili facinore in posterum deterrere possent. And in the Vid. cap.
ult. hujus libri.
28th Chapter of the same Book, the Libel is set out at large in its own
language worthy the reading.

Now all these things considered, shall any man that understands that the Kings
of France (who have no Jurisdiction at all over these Seas) have so anciently
had, and continued their Admirals in such power, as the Edict by Parliament at
Paris declares them to have done, so much as imagine that the Kings of England
(who have had (from Edward the First's time, and so long before, as that all
the aforenamed Nations do jointly acknowledge it to be then beyond the memory
of man) the sole rule and dominion of these Seas) should not furnish this his
maritimum regimen and dominium with those ancient maritime Laws before spoken
of? Certainly whosoever imagines this, concipit istud mare sine navibus, vel
naves sine naucleris and navarchis fluctuantes concipit istas. If furnished
with Laws, then consequently with a Commander, Admiral, or Governor, for the
dispensing and ministering of Justice amongst Sea-Traders, and seafaring-men
according to those Laws, else were these constituted and appointed to that use
in vain. But I may here rather from the forementioned Libel deduce a proof of
the ancient settlement of maritime Laws in England from the ancient
acknowledgement of an Admirals Jurisdiction, then the settlement of an Admiral
and his Jurisdiction from a former Introduction of the maritime Laws into this
Kingdom; for an Admiral of England, and an Admirals Jurisdiction are both
acknowledged by all the therein mentioned Nations, to have been from that time,
(which was anno 30 Ed. primi) beyond the memory of man. If then the Admiral had
so anciently a Jurisdiction, I must necessarily infer from thence, that so
anciently, if not somewhat before, the Laws of the Sea must be settled for his
rule and guidance: For they do not say there was an Admiral, for so there might
have been, and he have ruled by Arbitrary power: but they say (as before is
said) ad praefecturam Admirallorum a Regibus Angliae constitui solitorum
spectaret Jurisdictionem ex imperio ejusmodi excercendam. And in their Petition
as is before expressed, they desire ut a custodia liberati qui carceri, traditi
essent, reddita item bona nullo jure capta, jurisdictionem Admiralli Regis
Angliae subirent.

Now as (...) is from (...) jus, so jurisdictio is juris dicendi potestas. And
as (...), likewise from (...), or (...) from (...) lex; so Juris consultus est
is qui jus consuluit, sive studuit: and so juridicus quod secundum jus est, as
juridicus dies, quo rite jus dici potest, and juridica actio, quae secundum jus
est: dicitur etiam juridicus, qui jus dicit (...), etc. At cui jus ignotum est,
and ignota jurisdicendi potestas, and cui jus non est jus, non consuluit, and
ubi jus non est, ibi jus dici nequit. No man can have a Jurisdiction or power
of declaring the Law, or judging by the Law, to whom the Law is not known; more
especially where there is no known Law to declare or judge by. Therefore seeing
the Admiral (by common consent, and by so common a judicial acknowledgement) so
anciently had a Jurisdiction, necessarily he must so anciently have had certain
known and settled Laws to declare and judge by.

I do observe likewise that all the Patents granted unto Admirals, from the
35th of Edward the Third upwards, unto the 34th of Edward the First, do
conclude in binding them to the execution of their office: prout justum fuerit
and fieri consuevit: And as this prout fieri consuevit led me to the more
ancient Patents, wherein the Officers bear not the title of Admiral, and taught
me to understand that the variation of the title did not differ or alter the
property in the Office, or the quality of the Officer: so this prout justum
fuerit shows me as well as the Jurisdiction in the Libel before spoken of did,
that the Admirals had then; and prout hactenus shows me they had so before, a
Law to rule and judge by: For though a private man, which is vir bonus, a good
man which deals uprightly and punctually with all men, is usually said to be
vir justus, and not improperly when we speak of a private man in his private
dealings: And vir probus and sanctus, which observes the Divine Law, is very
properly called vir justus, when we speak or discourse of matters of Religion,
etc. But if we speak of a man set and put in place and authority over others in
Sea-affairs, we say he is vir justus, qui jus observat, and a jure non
discedit; for (...) which signifies justus, does as (...) and (...) do, come
from (...) jus; and so (...) from the same word signifies legitime, jure, and
just; (...) signifies jus, the Law it self.

CHAP. VI.
The Antiquity of the Admiralty argued and inferred from the defect and want of
ability in other Courts in deciding of Maritime Causes in those ancient times.
THat in those ancient times the Custodes marinae, and maritimarum partium,
etc. to whose care and trust these marinae, and maritimae parts, the Seas, the
Coasts and Ports of the Seas were committed, had a great power, and grand
authority over all those maritime parts, whereunto they were limited, and over
all Ships and Shipping, and over all things thereunto belonging, and over all
persons whatsoever, who were therein concerned within the said limits, and had
powet and authority of hearing and determining of all differences and
controversies, which did or might arise concerning the same, may be very well
concluded upon this further ground, that no other Court in those days presumed
ever to take cognizance of any such matters, or affairs, which I am confident
of for the reasons ensuing: I hope no man will say that maritime causes were
tried in the Heal-gemote, now called the Court Baron; nor in the Hundresmote,
now called the Hundred-Court, and is of the same nature with the County Court;
nor yet in the Scyedgemote, now called the Lamb. Arch.
Sheriffs Turn, which were the Courts then in use, and had been long before
the Conquest, and do yet continue, and never did, nor do assume, nay not so
much as challenge any right at all to any such power.

Nor did the Kings Court of Exchequer (which was the first Court was settled
after the Conquest) ever Lamb. Arch.
undertake to deal in causes of that nature; but (as Mr. Lambard determines
this point very well) was only settled and appointed for causes concerning the
Kings Demeasnes and Receipts. And he says that after the Conqueror had
suppressed the Forces of those that made head against him, here, he settled
this Court for his Revenues, and called it his Exchequer, after the name of his
Exchequer in Normandy; but (says he) it differed not a little from that; for
the Exchequer of Normandy had not only the Government of the Revenues of the
Duke there, but was also the Sovereign Court for the administration of Justice
amongst his Subjects until Lewis the Twelfth, King of France, anno 1499.
converted it into a Parliament, consisting of a President and Counselors, and
established it at Roan in Normandy, where it still continues. But (says he)
this Exchequer in England had only the direction of his Demeasnes and Receipts,
and the administration of Common Justice continued still in that high Court of
Justice and Equity, which did then and a long time after, as well as before the
Conquest follow the King himself; and for proof thereof he quoteth Gervasius
Tilburiensis, who wrote many observations upon the Exchequer, which he
dedicated to King Henry the second, and be yet remaining in the receipt under
the custody of the Chamberlains of the Exchequer in the black book there.

But because (as Mr. Lambard says) some contended to maintain that the
Exchequer was in those days a Court of all sorts of Pleas, for all Subjects
whatsoever, and that for the maintenance of their assertion, they do allege
the title of Mr. Glanvil's Book in part thus: Et Glanvil. in tit. ej^sd. lib.
illas solum leges continet and consuetudines secundum quas placitatur in Curia
Regis ad Scaccarium, lest others should hereby be misled, and for this reason
think so too, and so be brought to conceive, that before the Court of
King's Bench or Common Pleas were either of them settled in certo aliquo loco,
that the Exchequer might have the cognizance of all Causes between party and
party, as well maritime belonging to the Sea, and Sea-affairs, and from thence
arising; as terrene belonging to the Land, and Land-affairs, and from thence
growing; I shall here set down Mr. Lambards answer to that which is alleged
for the proof, and maintenance of this assertion, who confidently affirms,
that the aforementioned words are not the words of Glanvil himself, but of the
Publisher of his Book in print, which appears by what precedeth the words
alleged in the Title, viz. Tractatus de legibus de tempore Regis Henrici
secundi compositus ab illustri viro Ranulpho de Glanvile, juris regni, and
antiquarum consuetudinum eo tempore peritissimo; which (says he) does plainly
show and bewray that the Publisher spoke of Glanvile as another man, and which
also lived not then, but at another time. And herein he must needs say very
truly, for never was there any Author of any credit that ever gave himself this
or the like title, or being living, would say that he was juris regni and
antiquarum consuetudinum eo tempore peritissimus.

And again, they have not taken in all the words of that title, which do
follow, but have left out these, viz. Glanv. tit.
Et coram judiciariis ubicunque fuerint; which being so, the Kings Bench or
Court which then followed the King, must needs be herein comprehended and
included, and the whole title being collected thus, Tractatus de legibus de
tempore Henrici secundi compositus ab illustri viro Ranulpho de Glanvile, juris
regni and antiquarum consuetudinum eo tempore peritissimo, and eas solum leges
continet and consuetudines secundum quas placitatur in Curia Regis ad
Scaccarium, and coram Justiciariis ubicunque fuerint. Then does this title make
no argument for the proof of their assertion. And so I shall leave the
Exchequer then only to govern and rule the Kings Revenues, Demeasnes, and
Receipts, and such matters as belong only thereunto; and next cast only a
glance upon the Justices in Air and their Jurisdiction.

The Justices in Air are said by Gervase of Tilbury to be quasi errantes, but
by Bracton are called itinerantes: For King Henry the Second in the 32th year
of his reign divided the Realm into six parts, from which the Circuits which
our Judges do now ride, do not much differ; and to every of those parts
appointed three Justices, who at their appointed times kept Circuits in their
several parts to them limited, and held plea as well of Criminal as of Lamb.
Arch. page 31, 32.
Civil Causes. But Justices of Assizes being likewise appointed, whose first
office was to take Assizes of Mort d'ancester, and Novel Desseisins, according
to the customs of Normandy, where it is called la Novellette; and gaining a
further power of taking Attaints, Juries, and Certificates, and delivery of
Gaols. These Justices of Assise by the beginning of Edward the Third's Reign
gave an end to the Justices in Air, who about that time did surcease and take
leave.

Now could neither of these Justices, the Justices in Air not coming every
year into the Country, nor the other Justices (being sometimes at home,
sometimes in their Circuit; and in their Circuit, sometimes in one place, and
sometimes in another) take Lamb. Arch. page 35.
cognizance, or have the hearing and determining of maritime causes, seafaring
matters, or any thing them concerning: For such causes did and do require a
more speedy dispatch and determination than these Justices could afford them.
Nam Peckius in tit. 5. l. 11. de Naubrag
breviter and summarie tales sunt examinandae causae, nec ad plenissimas
Judiciorum formulas recurrere oportet, sed suceincte de plano sine strepitu
judiciorum and solenni figura; immo velo levato in eis procedendum est. and ut
(...) vela navis navigationem and transfretationem properant, judicium sic
properat ad navigandum and transfretandum festinatio; Merchants, Mariners, and
Seamen, whose business and affairs are ordered here, ventulated at sea, and
agitated beyond the seas, must have a quick and sudden dispatch of Justice;
that as they come in with one good wind, so they may go out with another: the
Mariners cause admits no delay, but must have a judge, and a settled place
of Judicature at all times in readiness for his dispatch: for whilst his cause
is pleading for his right, his Ship is preparing for his Voyage; to which I may
well apply the verse in Virgil, Vig. Aeneid. 3.
Interea classem velis aptare jubebat. For his ditty is always the same with
another verse of the same Authors, Id. Aen. 4.
Rursus agam pelago, and ventis dare vela jubebo.

Neither for the very same reason (if there had been no other) could the Court
of Common Pleas, when it was settled, take cognizance of maritime causes, or
seafaring matters, nor did the settling thereof dissettle the Marina, which had
at and before that time been committed unto the care and charge of several
persons, as appears by those several Records of the ninth and eighth year of
King Henry the Third already cited; for the Court of Common Pleas ('it is plain)
began not to be settled until the ninth year of the same King. if so soon; for
it was but that year determined that it should be so settled; but the power
thereof rested in the King himself, and his supreme Court, which constantly
followed him whithersoever he removed; and was by Magna Charta cap. 11. that
year appointed only to be settled in one particular place, by these words,
Lamb. Archeion.
Communia placita non sequantur curiam nostram, sed teneantur in certo aliquo
loco.

Now although differences and controversies of what nature soever, were then
perhaps neither so many, nor did so frequently arise as now, nor were of so
great consequence and concernment, as since they have been; yet cannot I, or
any man else (as I conceive) think that they were so few, ot so mean, as that
they deserved no decision or determination at all.

I cannot see then how it can be possible, but that these Custodes must
necessarily have then even in those so ancient times a complete Jurisdiction
for the regulating all maritime and sea affairs, and for the deciding of all

doubtless not unknown here, for the reasons before expressed, together with the
ancient Statutes of the Admiralty, and those Laws of Oleron, which (as it
plainly appears) were introduced by Richard the First.

CHAP. VII.
Of the Exercise of the Sea-laws by the Graecians, Athethenians, Romans,
Italians, Venetians, Spaniards; and by the Admirals of Naples and Castile.
FRom the example of these Rhodians, have all or most Princes and
Commonwealths in Europe obtained their Laws, continually constituted and
appointed chief Captains, Commanders, Governors, or Admirals over all their
Ships, seafaring-men, and sea-affairs, to order, rule, and govern them by those
Laws, and to put the same in due execution, distinctly and apart from, and in
no wise mixed or intermingled with those Laws whereby they regulated their
Land-men and Land-businesses.

The Petit. de legibus Attic.
Graecians have had from ancient times, and still have their several special
Judges for hearing and determining of all differences happening between
Merchant and Merchant, Mariner and Mariner, and between Merchants and Mariners,
and between Merchants and Owners of Ships, and Owners of Ships and Mariners,
and between them and all others that had to do with them in their sea-trading,
and sea affairs. And these Governors of their Fleets are termed or called their
(...), or chief Governors.

Athenians have likewise anciently had the like for the same purpose, which
they termed or called their Thesmothetie.

And the Sejus Satumius ad Se^. C. Trekel.
Romans had anciently their Archigubernii, praefecti classis vel maris, for
their principal Governor, Commander of their Fleet and Shipping; but because of
their great employment, sometime at Sea, sometime at Land, they had their
Magisteriani, or Judiciarii (or as Frecc. de officio Admiral. lib. ult. cap. de
Commerciis.
Freccia says) their Comes Commerciorum for the Judicature of all maritime
causes.

And when they came to be divided into Vide etiam lib. 2. de naufrag.
Kingdoms and Republiques, the Kingdoms had their Admirals, and the
Republiques their Consuls, who had the Judicature of Freight, etc.

what necessaries soever; and over all such as make it their Trade to take fish
in the Sea, etc. And his Court is called Magna Curia, from which there lies no
appeal, only to the supreme Council; all which he has exclusive to all others,
both for matters Criminal and Civil. The Admiral of Castile has supreme
Authority over all that use the Seas, and has other Judges in Port-Towns for
the dispatch of all ordinary businesses concerning Freight, Avaridge, and all
other maritime affairs.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Admiralty of France and Denmark.
BUt to come nearer home, the Kingdom of France has from ancient times had
Admirals; and so affirms that learned man De dominio maris lib. 2. c. 8
Mr. Seldom, Seculis in vetustioribus apud Gallos fuere quidem Admiralli seu
rerum maritimarum praefecti; ita tamen ut eorum scriptores de dignitatis
initiis haud parum discrepent; says he, they are so ancient, that their
Writers cannot agree when that dignity began: Sed id plerumque aiunt, reperiri
sub Idem ibid. ubi citat Chopp^^ de dominio Franc^ae, lib. 1. tit. 15.. 11. and
Pas quier en les recerches, lib. 2. cap 14. and J. Tilium de rebus Ga^licis
lib. 2.
Carolo Magno Rotlandum maris Britannici (Aremoricani) praefectum, quem ex
Eginharto vitae Caroli scriptore contemporaneo petunt: But says he in
Eginharto non maris Britannici, sed tantum Britannici littoris praefectus
express is nuncupatur; he was not Admiral of the British Sea, but of the
British Seacoasts or Shore; Quo nomine non qui mari, ut provinciae praest, sed
qui littori, and dignitatis limiti designatur: For he sets forth plainly in
the same chapter, that the Kings of France had no Dominion over those Seas;
Reges vero ipsos nullum tunc habuisse in mare imperium diserte scribit Johannes
Tilius Curiae Parisiensis actuarius: And there sets down Tilius his own words
at large, together with diverse of other proofs throughout the same chapter,
which fully manifests the same.

Yet in the beginning of the Idem. Ibid.
same chapter, he does allow the French Admiral, or their praefectus maris
copiarum, navalium in mari quocunque and nautarum regimen, and jurisdictionem
in personas and res mobiles, quae sub judice veniant, pour raison ou occasion
de faict de la mer; id est, ob causam aliquam a re maritima ortam.

And in confirmation of this Edicts per Fontenon. Append. Hen. 3.
Power and Jurisdiction, and for the more plain declaration thereof, the Office
of the Admiral by the Parliament at Paris is since thus ratified, and declared
in the Kings name.

1. That in all Armies which shall be raised, and set out to sea, the Admiral
shall be and continue chief, and our Lieutenant General shall be obeyed in all
maritime Towns or Places, which are or may be without contradiction.

2. He shall have Jurisdiction, Cognizance, and determination of all things
done or committed on the Sea, or Shoars of the same; likewise of all Acts of
Merchandising, Fishing, Freighting, or letting to Freight, Sales or breach of
Ships, of Contracts touching the matters aforesaid, of Charter-parties, of
Sea-briefs, and of all other things whatsoever happening upon the Sea, or
Shoars thereof, as our Lieutenant alone; and to all purposes in the places
aforesaid, which Jurisdiction, Cognizance, and Determination we have
interdicted to all other Judges.

3. He shall have Cognizance exclusive to all others of causes Civil, and
Criminal, of those who are of the Dutch Towns, of Esterlings, English, Scotch,
Portugals, Spaniards, and Strangers, whether the cause of suit be betwixt
Strangers only, or betwixt Strangers and our own Subjects, upon any occasion
whatsoever.

principal Court at the Marble Table in the Palace of Paris, and appoints
Judges as his Deputies in maritime Cities and Towns, who hear and judge
ordinary matters within their Circuits; and if any business fall out worthy of
greater consideration, they refer it to the Admirals principal Court.

The Admiral of Denmark is called Riiks, and has the like power and authority
the Admiral of France has.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Admiral of Scotland.
COncerning the Admiral of Scotland, we may (I am confident) very well believe
Wellwood, who was that Countryman, and in his Wellwood. Prohem.
Proheme upon his conscience, as a Professor of the Civil Law, denies that he
had any employment or part in any Admiralty; and he sets it forth thus, and
says,

1. That for the redier obedience to the Wellwood, cap. 2. page 10.
great Admiral of the Sea, it is by common consent of Nations successively
agreed, that in consideration of the Admirals sovereign commandment, special
preferment, and power over the lives of men within the Sea-flood, that
therefore they should also have a sovereign Jurisdiction only proper to
themselves over all seafaring-men within their bounds, and in all seafaring
causes, and debates, Civil and Criminal; so that no other Judge of any degree,
at least in Scotland, may meddle therewith, but only by way of assistance; and
that must be by way of Commission, and in difficult causes; and he instanceth
in an action intended by Antoni de la tour, against one Christian Masters 6
November. Anno 1542. and he quoteth for this example the first Tome, and the 555
Chapter of the Registry of Scotland.

2. He says Idem. Ibid.
the Admiral is to constitute a Vice Admiral, and Captains to supply his
absence at Sea, as also Deputies for particular parts on the Coasts, with
Coroners to view the dead bodies found on Sea, or found on the Coasts thereof;
And Commissioners or Judges General for exercising Justice in the High-Court on
Land, in causes Criminal, specifying likewise the Officers thereunto belonging,
and these Commissioners or Judges General may sit where they please, to execute
Justice, to imprison and relax, and to command the Kings Prisons, Boroughs, and
their Prison-Keepers, to receive and keep their Prisoners.

3. That Id. cap. eodem page 11.
his authority is distinctly acknowledged in all things pertaining to seafaring
matters, and therefore his Judge, Deputy, or Commissary is called Judge,
Admiral; and he and none other does sit, cognost, determine, and administer
Justice in all Civil debates between Mariner and Merchant, and between Mariner
and Mariner: as likewise upon all Complaints, Contracts, Offenses, Pleas,
Exchanges, Assecurations, Debts, Accomps, Charter-parties, Covents, and all
other Writings concerning lading and unlading of ships, freights, hires, money
lent upon casualties and hazard at Sea, and all other business whatsoever
amongst seafarers done on sea, this side sea, or beyond sea, not forgetting
cognition of the Writs and Appeals from other Judges, and the causes of Actions
of Reprizal or Letters of Marque.

Yea, and to take Id. ca. eod. p. 12 ubi citat diplomata Admiral. in utroque

Stipulations, Cognizances, and insinuations in the books of the Admiralty, and
to arrest and put in execution.

4. That he is to enquire as well within liberties, as without, by the Oath of
twelve men upon several offenses.

1. Of Revealers of the King and Country their secrets over sea in time of
war,

2. Of all Pirates, their Assisters and Abettors, Out-treaders and Receptours.

3. Of the Breakers of the Admirals Arrestments and Attachments.

4. Of Goods forbidden, and Merchandises not customed, and yet shipped and
transported.

5. Of the Resisters of the Admirals Officers in executing their praecepts.

6. Of the Forestallers, Regraters, and Dearthers of corn, fish, drink, fire,
wood and victuals carried over sea.

7. Of Pleaders before other Judges then the Judge Admiral in causes pertaining
to his Jurisdiction, as also of the Judges taking cognizance of such causes.

8. Of such as give Sea-briefs, Testimonials, or such like, over sea without
power or license from the Admiral.

9. Of Transporters and Carriers of Traitors, Rebels, manifest Transgressors,
and Fugitives from Justice over sea.

10. Of Freighters and Hyrers of Ships of other Nations, when they may be
served by their own Nation.

11. Of such as cast Ballasting-sand, or what else in Harbors or Channels that
may defile or spoil the same.

12. Of Ship or Boat-writes extorting the Leiges or Subjects.

13. Of taking away the Boigh from the Anchor, or cutters of Cables or other
Tews.

14. Of false Weights and Measures by sea.

15. Of Shedders of other men's blood on Sea, or any Port or River below the
first Bridge next the Sea.

16. Of such as have furnished Ships with all ware, or gear, as the Seamen
term it, whereby any are hurt, lamed, or maimed.

17. Of Customers and Water-Bailiffs, which take more Custom or Anchorage,
then has been usual.

18. Of such as absent themselves from Wapen-shewing, or Mustering, which the
Admiral may ordain twice a year in time of war, and once in two year in time
of peace, upon all dwellers at Ports and Harbors, or within one mile near
thereunto.

19. Of all sorts of transgressions committed by Seamen, Ferry-men, Watermen,
as well in Floods, Rivers, and Creeks, from the first Bridges, as on the Seas,
Fishers, Pilots, Ship-wrights, and Prest-men, and continuing his authority,
after due cognition to levy and gather the penalties and amercements of all
such transgressors, together with the goods of Pirates, Felons, capital
Faulters, their-Receivers, Assisters, attainted, convict, condemned, outlawed,
or horned.

20. Of Deodands, viz. the thing, whether Boat or Ship, etc. that caused the
death of a man, or by reason whereof a man did perish.

21. Of Waif or Stray-goods, Wreck of Sea, Coast-goods.

22. Of Shares, lawful Prizes, or Goods of the Enemy, Lagon, Flotson and
Jetson: Lagon, which lies on the Sea-ground, or is taken from the bottom of
the Sea: Flotson, which is found swimming on the Sea; Jetson, which is cast
forth of the Sea, and is found on the Shore, with Anchorages, Beaconages,
Mear-Swine, Sturgeons, and Whales, and all fish of extraordinary greatness,
which have always been allowed to the Admiral.

CHAP. X.
From the common Acceptance of the Sea-laws in other Nations is inferred the
Acceptance of them in England.
THus have I set forth the ancient original and beginning of the Sea-laws from
the Rhodes so exactly by them set down, according to the rules of equity, that
none of the Roman Emperors, the Masters of Law, no not Antoninus, who (as he
accounted himself) was (...), mundi dominus, would undertake the decision of
maritime causes, but would refer them to the determination of the Laws of the
Rhodes.

I have likewise set forth the common and glad acceptance of them, or of what
could be got of them; or rather the earnest suit for them by very many other
Nations, the use whereof has been most profitably continued amongst them.

Can it be thought then that this Nation being an Island (to which Shipping and
Navigation must needs be most necessary and useful) should deny or refuse
these Laws, so serviceable and useful for their Maritime affairs, there being
no other Law here useful for that purpose? or shall it be thought that this
Nation neither knew or heard of them, when so many other Nations did?

Certainly no: This Nation has very anciently flourished by its Trade and
Traffic with other Nations, and has been frequently accustomed to
Navigation, and Transfretation, and has had as well converse as commerce with
those Nations, and would as well convey those Laws hither for their common
Government, as transport their own Commodities thither for their private
benefit, which happily could not be enjoyed, one without the other. If not so,
yet let no man say that the two famous ancient Universities of the Land,
wherein there be so many Colleges, and houses of ancient foundation, in which
have been by the Founders themselves, so many Fellow-Ships, Scholar-ships, and
places founded, settled, and employed properly and solely for Students in the
Civil and Maritime Laws, or the Laws proper and necessarily useful for
Navigation and Maritime affairs, being so scattered, (or I will rather say
decently, as flowers strewed) and dispersed through the whole body of the Civil
Law, the subject whereon those Students were to spend their daily labor,
pains, and employment, could possibly be long ignorant of those Laws, that
these so many forenamed nations had so long and so well known?

What if known by this Nation, was there yet any use made of them in it? That
they were known by what has been said or considered, cetainly I cannot have so
ill a conceit of my Country men, the ancient Inhabitants of this Nation, as to
think them so long ignorant and unskilful of those ancient Laws of the Sea,
and Laws so necessary for maritime affairs, as some would make them to be; much
less will I think the Government of this Nation to be without so good order and
justice in any particular, as not to settle these Laws once known for the
government of its maritime matters; nor will I imagine the maritime men to be
so dull or stupid, as not gladly to embrace the settlement of such Laws as
tended so much to their quiet, and advance of their profit, being to trade and
commerce with such as used, in this particular, no other Laws but these.

Again, shall we say that so many Nations, some so remote, and some so near
home as France, but over against us, and Scotland even within the same Island,
all governed by the Civil Laws, or Municipal Laws thence derived, and by them
regulated and guided as the Sea Laws are, and keep the paths and very
footsteps thereof in their proceedings, as the Sea Laws do; have with so much
eagerness pursued and sought for these Sea Laws, and with so much cheerfulness
embraced, and continued them; and that this Nation that is invested in a Law
particular and municipal, which does in no wise so much as challenge or claim
any derivation from, or dependency of the Civil Law, but is altogether
different and disagreeable thereunto in its proceedings, and oftentimes in its
determinations, and has no foundation or grounds whereon the dicisions of
sea-controversies can be built, should without the knowledge and practice of
these Civil and Maritime Laws, deal and trade with such as do live under them,
and are guided by them? surely no, so many inconveniences, distractions and
distempers by reason of the variousness of two Laws, both in proceedings, and
oftentimes in determinations, would long agone have destroyed all our Commerce
and Traffic with these other Nations, and so consequently have dispoiled us
of our Navigation and Shipping, the principal safeguard of this Land.

Nay, I am so far from doubting the acceptance of these Maritime and Sea
Laws, here in England, as well as in other Nations, that I am confident they
were here settled before they were settled in diverse of those Nations before
mentioned: For I must not so much as think, or have the least conceit that
England ever borrowed any thing at all from those Articles which are
cognoscible in the Admiralty of Scotland. But I may very well believe that
those Articles of Scotland were borrowed from some of the three ancient Records
of the Admiralty of England: (For so are all things by the Admiral, Judge, or
Lieutenant decreed, and registered by an Ordinance of Richard the First, made at
Grimsby, styled and said to be) which are, with very many other ancient things,
comprised in the black Book of the Admiralty, which are therein engrossed in an
ancient Character upon Vellam, one of which immediately follows the ancient
Statutes of the Admiralty, and is there set down in old French, as the said
Statutes are, and contains 38 Articles.

A second is a Latin Copy translated out of another ancient French Record, by
Roughton, and in an ancient Character in the same manner, inserted into the
same book, and contains 52 Articles.

The third is the Inquisition taken at Quinborough, the 2. of April in the 49th
year of the Reign of Edward the Third; at which time, and to which place he
caused several maritime and seafaring and sea-trading men of the best judgment
and knowledge in sea-affairs of most of the maritime parts of England to be
summoned, and there before W. Nevel Admiral of the North, Philip Courtney then
Admiral of the West, and William Lord Latimer Chamberlain of England, and
Warden of the Cinque Ports, to meet together, and consider of all such points
and matters as had anciently and usually been observable, inquirable, and
punishable in the Admiralty, upon which inquisition 81 Articles were concluded
on, which are likewise engrossed (they being more particular than the former)
in old French, in the said ancient black Book of the Admiralty: But these (as
the Scottish Articles) do concern only matters to be proceeded against
criminally, and not matters of Trade, Traffic and Commerce, and damages
sustained at Sea, or in Ports, havens, etc. whereof I shall come to treat in
the second Book; yet do these several Records in several Articles set forth in
what manner such as shall sue or implead any Merchant, Mariner, or seafaring
man for any Contract maritime, whether made by Charter-party or otherwise, or
for any thing whatsoever done of, or concerning any Ship or other Vessel in any
other Court then the Admiral, shall be proceeded against, as I shall more
particularly hereafter set forth: But my chiefest reason that the Civil and
Maritime Law-Courts were here settled in England; before they were settled in
diverse of those other Nations, is for that this Nation has had the Dominion
over the British Seas, and their High-Admirals their Jurisdiction over those
Maritime Affairs, which fell sub isto regimine and dominio, so anciently, as
that in Edward the Firsts time the same was acknowledged by very many other
Nations to have been then beyond the memory of man, as I have before set forth
in the Sup. cap. 5
5th chapter of this Book, where I take my authority from an ancient Record of
the Tower in nature of a Libel, entitled De superioritate maris Angliae, and
jure officii Admiralitatis in eodem; as is in the same 5th chapter expressed. The
Record it self I was a long time since showed by my old friend Mr. Collet, who
for a long time had the keeping of the Tower Records under several men, unto
whose care and custody the same were committed; and afterward I met with the
same in Mr. Seldens Book, Seld de dom. maris. li. 2. c. 26.
De Dominio maris, which I had not before read over; and after that I found the
same set forth by Coke Jurisdic. Court. c. 22.
Sir Edward Coke in his Jurisdictions of Courts; yet I will not send the Reader
thither to seek it, but for his readier perusal I shall again set forth the
same here, and therewith terminate and end this first Book of my Maritime
Dicaeologie of England. The words of the Record are these.

THE MARITIME DICAEOLOGIE, OR SEA-JURISDICTION
THE SECOND BOOK.
CHAP. I.
That the Sea Jurisdiction and the Land Jurisdiction are, and so necessarily
must be, two different and distinct Jurisdictions, having no dependence each
upon the other.
ALthough the exact time of the beginning or first settlement of the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court here in England be not by me in the
preceding book so clearly set forth as some might have expected, yet is some
foundation thereof deduced from such hight of Antiquity, as that I cannot but
hope that the Jurisdiction it self will for that cause, and what shall be
showed in this ensuing Treatise, deserve a continuance to posterity. And
although in the precited ancient Records, we find not the same title of that
Office observed, and kept, yet may we very well perceive the same Office to
have been preserved, exercised, and executed, though under several titles. And
we find that in Edward the First's time (as plainly appears by the before
quoted Cap. ult. prim. lib.
Libel, and other before cited Records) the same was exercised under the title
of the Admiral: And doubtless that title was long before that time known to
belong unto the chief Captain, Commander, or Keeper of the Fleets, Ports, and
Seas, and has been so used by many other Nations in Europe. However the
diversity of names neither extinguisheth the nature of the Office, nor does so
much as make any distinction between the one and the other person so diversely
named, whilst they both bear one and the same signification.

But here I shall proceed next to distinguish this Jurisdiction from the Land
Jurisdiction, and show that the Land Jurisdiction and Sea Jurisdiction are (and
must necessarily so be) two absolute, different and distinct Jurisdictions,
having no dependency one upon the other.

And first these two Jurisdictions are absolutely different and distinct in
respect of the parties which exercise them; the one being exercised in the
active and directive part by the Admirals, Captains, and Governors of the Seas,
Seacoasts, Ports, and Shipping, which have all or most of them from ancient
times been Equites Aurati, descended from Royal Blood: Noblemen, or descended
from Nobility, as Spelm. verbo Admirallorum series.
Sir Henry Spelman says. The judicial part by the Judges of the High-Court of
the Admiralty, and Vice-Admirals Courts, learned and well verst in the Civil
and Maritime Laws, juxta illud venerabilis ejusdem Spelm. verb. Admir Gallic.
p. 16. and supra cap. 2. lib. 1. sub fine.
Spelmanni verb. Admirallo Gollico page 16. Nos enim, etc. de quo vide supra
cap. 2. lib. 1. sub fine. The other exercised by the learned Judges of the Land
in the Courts at Westminster, and within the Bodies of the several Counties of
the Nation in their several Circuits; the Judges of one Circuit having no
authority or power over the other, nor having any thing to do to intermeddle
with the other in their Circuits.

Secondly, the Court of the Admiralty has from ancient times been styled
Suprema Curia suae Majestatis Admiralitatis Angliae; so that the same has
anciently been styled the Kings Court, as well as his Courts at Westminster.
But from the one Jurisdiction there lies an immediate appeal unto the supreme
authority in Chancery, which Court appoints Judges Delegates by Commission
under the Great Seal (upon the apprehension of an illegal sentence) who are
assigned and appointed Judges for further hearing, deciding, and adjudging of
the said sentence and cause of appeal, according to the rules of the Civil Law.

In the other there lies a Writ of Error from the Common Pleas to the
King's Bench, and from that Bench to the Judges of all the three Benches in the
Exchequer Chamber.

The Appeal from the Admiralty is for the rectifying of the Sentence, as well
as of the proceedings, which appeal the Forraigner must be allowed, otherwise
he will complain at home of injustice done here, and so proceed to the course
of obtaining Letters of Reprisal for his satisfaction, whether the first
sentenc was good or not, upon this ground only, that he had not the due course
of Law allowed him, for the trial of that Sentence which was first given
against him.

The Writ of Error reverseth the Judgment, though never so just, if an error
be found in the proceedings; but reverseth not the Judgment, though the same
seem never so erroneous to him against whom it was given, if no error be found
in the proceedings.

Thirdly, they are absolutely different and distinct in regard of the different
and distinct subjects the Judges of them do handle and are busied about; they
of the one being busied and occupied in the ordering and disposing of all
businesses upon the Coasts and Havens of the Seas, tending to the preservation
of this Nation from foreign Invasion, and keeping thereof in safety and quiet;
and in the building, repairing, tackling, and furnishing, or causing the
building, repairing, tackling, and furnishing of all manner or sorts of Ships,
Boats, or Vessels whatsoever for that purpose, and keeping the dominion over
the British Seas, and in the otherwise ordering and directing of all manner of
Ships, and Shipping, and seafaring Men, and all manner of Trading,
Merchandising, Traffic, and Commerce thereby, or therewith: and in hearing,
deciding, and adjudging all differences, debates and controversies arising from
things done, or to be done at Sea, or in any Port, Harbor, or Creek thereof,
either between the King or the Lord High-Admiral, and any party, or between
party and party, Forraigner or others, whether Criminal or Civil.

Those of the other Jurisdiction being employed in ordering of all things for
the good peace and quiet of this Kingdom within self, and in the hearing and
determining of all offenses, debates and differences arising, or growing from
any thing done, or to be done within the several bodies of the Counties
thereof, whether they be Criminal or Civil, whether they concern Estates real
or personal; whether they be between the King, and any other party, or between
party and party, which are tryable by the said Law.

Fourthly, they are different and distinct, in respect of the rules the Judges
proceed unto judgment by, those of the one Jurisdiction proceeding according
to the rules of the Civil Law, known and used by all or most Courts and
Judicatures in Christendom.

Those of the other proceeding according to Rules and Laws municipal, known
only unto themselves, and such as are well skilled and verst in the same, and
are Inhabitants and Subjects of this Nation.

To set forth the differences between these two Jurisdictions in their
proceedings, was to undertake the setting down of the whole proceedings in all
several causes, tryable both in the Admiralty, and the Common Law Courts; the
one of which (with some pains) I might very well do; but the other belongs not
to me to undertake: yet so much I know of them, as that I am sufficiently
informed in my judgment, that they are exceednigly different even in their
proceedings.

Fifthly, they are different even in the Laws themselves, whereby the Judges
are guided to their determination, and directed in their giving of judgment;
those of the one Jurisdiction determining according to those Civil Laws, which
are Maritime, and still retained, and kept in use in most Nations in Europe,
adjoining thereunto those few and short Laws of Oleron, with some other
customary Laws of the Seas, which are commonly accepted and known, where such
Judicatories are kept and held; and are expressly declared and published by
several Maritime Writers. Those of the other judging according to a municipal
Law, fitted, prepared, and composed only for Land affairs, and indeed only for
the Land affairs of this Kingdom by the advice of such as have had the best
judgment in those Land affairs.

And as these are different and distinct from the Civil and Maritime Laws,
which have been composed by the advice of such as have had frequent Traffic,
Trade, and Commerce at sea, and by that means have had best knowledge and
judgment in sea affairs: So indeed in the same manner are the Civil Laws which
have been composed and established in other Nations by such as have been of
best experience in businesses of the Republique, for the guiding and governance
thereof distinguished and kept apart from those other Civil Laws which are
Maritime. Infra li isto 2. cap. 14. and 15.


The absolute necessity of keeping these two Jurisdictions thus distinct one
from the other, you shall have fully set forth in the 14. and 15. chapters of
this second Book, wherein is showed the use and practice of the Civil Law in
most foreign Nations, and that the same is absolutely necessary to be used and
practiced in all Admiralty Courts, unto which two chapters I especially refer
the Reader.

CHAP. II.
That the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty does extend to all manner of Ships,
Shipping, Seafaring and Sea-trading men.
SEeing then that the Admiralty is a distinct Jurisdiction from the Land
Jurisdiction; in the next place the bounds and limits thereof are to be
considered, and those will best appear by the before mentioned Records, of the
Patents and grants of that Jurisdiction.

First then, that this Jurisdiction extends to all manner of Ships and
Shipping, (I conceive) will not be denied; for it is plain by the Records
already quoted, that the Kings had in those ancient times their Admirals as
well for the Northern Seas and Coasts as the Western; yea, and sometimes
several Admirals for one of these Coasts, as in the twentieth year of Edward
the second, quidam Rot. an. 22. Ed. 2. memb. 7.
habuerunt custodiam costerarum maris inter Toffe and Thaw, and quidam aliarum;
and in the tenth year of the same Kings reign, one W. (...) had the same power
ab ore aquae Thamesis usque Ipswic. and Johannes de Thorpe ab Ipswic. usque
Linn.

Shall we think then that this King had in those times (when shipping was far
more scarce then it has been since) in each of these Coasts, and in every of
these particular places within these Coasts (where he had Capitaneum and
Admirallum flotae suae) a Fleet consisting of his own particular Ships, which
he called flota nostra, which required a Captain and Admiral to govern them?
Certainly no, but all Ships, Boats and Vessels whatsoever belonging unto sea,
tam remiculi, quam corbitae sive gauli; tam naves frumentariae sive onerariae,
quam naves praesidiariae: tam Beucentauri, quam naves praetoriae sive
Navarchae, etc. were all comprehended under flota navium. And this is plain,
for that these Governors were sometimes styled Sup. cap. 1. lib. prim.
Capitanei navigii, as well as Capitanei and Admiralli flotae navium: And that
navigium signifies all manner of shipping, I have already showed. And likewise
very many of the ancient Patents expressly run flotae nostrae omnium navium; I
shall instance only in one or two, as in that of the 8 Ed. 3. which runs
thus: Rex omnibus ad quos, etc. salutem; Sciatis quod nos de fidelitate probata
and circumspectione provida dilecti and fidelis nostri Rogeri de Hengham
plenarie confidentes, constituimus ipsum Rogerum Capitaneum and Admirallum
flotae nostrae omnium navium, etc. tam quinque portuum quam aliorum portuum and
locorum per costeram maris versus parts, etc.

And in that of the first of Edward the Third, in these words, Rex omnibus ad
quos, etc. salutem: Sciatis quod nos de circumspectione and fidelitate dilecti
nobis Johannis Parbroun confidentes, constituimus eum Capitaneum and Admirallum
flotae nostrae omnium navium magnae Jernemouth, and omnium aliorum locorum,
etc. per costeram maris versus parts Boreales quamdiu nobis placuerit, etc.

So that these who were Admirals of the Kings Fleet, were Admirals of all
Ports, and Admirals of all Ships of all Ports.

And as it extends to all manner of Shipping, so does it extend unto all
manner of Shipmen: for to little purpose was it for the Admiral to have had
power and authority over the wooden Vessels, if they had not had power over all
the Seamen and Mariners in them, yea, and over all others that belonged
thereunto, or had to do therewith, or were skilled therein. For by almost all
the beforecited Patents they had not only potestatem super omnes and singulos
marinarios, but also super omnes de flota, of or belonging to the Fleet,
Navage, Ships, or Shipping, as well the owners of them, the Merchants and
Traders with them, and Imployers of them, as the Mariners of what degree
soever, sailing in them, or in any wise belonging to them, tam mercatores and
exercitores, quam proprietarios; tam naucleros, quam helciarios; tam
gubernatores, quam diaturios; tam proretas, quam mesonautas: and not only over
these, but also over all such as were employed in their Art, Trade, or
Occupation, for and toward the building, repairing, fitting and furnishing of
Ships for Navigation and setting them forth to sea, as Ship-wrights,
Anchor-smiths, Rope and Cablemakers, and the like, tam fabros anchorarios quam
naupegos, prymnesia anchoralia, retinacula puppis stupea, and sunes nauticos,
tam venditores, quam fabricatores, etc. All which were said to be de flota
navium, or de navigio; of or belonging to the Fleet or Navage; and were those
o^^es alii de flota, over whom the Admirals had command, power, and authority,
besides the Mariner; as is set forth in the forementioned Records. And as it
had been to little purpose for the Admiral to have had power over the Vessels,
and not over the Mariners and Seamen, and others fit for that employment; so
had it been to as little purpose, if he had not had the same power over the
Owners of them, and the Merchants that employed them, who otherwise would have
either opposed his directing the use of them, or his own using of them at all,
though for the service of the King, and good of the Common wealth. And to as
little purpose had this extent of his Jurisdiction been, had he not had the
command over all such as were most able and skillful to fit and furnish them
for service.

And the constituting of a man Capitaneum and Admirallum Flotae navium,
Capitaneum navigii, Custodem marinae, Capitaneum nautarum and marinellorum,
etc. does give a very great power not particularly specified in the Grant.

For all men very well know, that all Patents and Grants, as well of Offices
and Places, as of Lands and other things, did in ancient times comprehend and
contain in them very much, in a very few lines and words; and have been daily
enlarged by particular expressions, and singular specifications, when as
nothing more has been granted, then what was by general words granted before:
And the reason has been, lest some particulars in process of time might be
lost for want of continual use, or drawn into question, and cavilled against,
whether used or not used.

Yet have I seldom met with any of these specifical Grants that do trust to
such specification, without the general addition, and omnia alia pertinentia,
or the like, lest in their particular specifications they should lose somewhat
of that which was formerly granted in general words, and by some perhaps
observed, and known to be appertinent, and belonging unto the thing granted,
though for some time discontinued.

We must not think therefore that by specifying particulars, and stretching a
conveyance of half a dozen lines into whole a skin of Parchment or more, one
foot of land is gained the more thereby: for if so, I might very well conceive,
that the seller oftentimes might by that means sell more then his own. For I
have often seen many more particulars specified in the Conveyance from the
seller, then were ever intended by the Conveyance to pass to the buyer, or the
seller had to sell. And indeed this enlarging of Conveyances and Grants is so
usual, that a man might very well conceive (the Evidences being perused from
the first to the last) that every alienation had begot an enlargement of the
estate, when nothing at all has been added thereto.

We must not think therefore, that because there have been more particulars of
the Admirals power and jurisdiction specified in the latter Grants, and
Patents, then were in the former and more ancient; that therefore these latter
Admirals have gained greater and larger power and jurisdiction then the former
had.

Nor certaily can any thing be gained by specifying particulars; something may
be saved, and somewhat may be very well lost, if and omnia alia save it not.

I will not deny but that there may be, and deyly are made unto Manors, Lands,
and Tenements, many additions, whereby they are much increased.

And likewise to offices and other places, both in extent of office, and
increase of fees, or other profits: But these additions do, and always will
appear by the Deeds of Conveyance, Grants or Patents themselves, and are
distinguished from the ancient Manors, etc. and their appurtenances; and from
the ancient offices and places, their rights and profits, by Et praeterea, or
ac etiam, or ac similiter, etc.

And where there is an addition, these words or the like always are; but always
where these words are, there is not always an addition; for they are sometimes
used by way of specification; and sometimes instead of an et, between two
specifications.

Now in ancient times, the very constituting an Admiral, Captain, or Governor
of the Fleet or Navage, carried with it all the power and jurisdiction
belonging unto that office or place, without specifying any of the particulars;
and when any particular design was in hand at the time of the constituting and
making of the Captain or Admiral, or whatsoever other title he bore (as often
such design at that time there was, which caused the change of the Admiral)
then was that particular power which belonged unto his office, and concerned
that design, specified either in the Mandate directed to all Sheriffs, and
other Ministers and Officers for their obedience unto him, as Admiral, Captain,
etc. but in such manner as shows that particular to be included amongst the
many other particulars granted unto him by his Patent, under the general words,
Constituimus dilectum and fidelem N. Capitaneum and Admirallum flotae navium,
or Capitaneum Navigii, etc. or else that particular, when any is specified in
the body of the Patent with an ita quod, ut ita quod potest hoc vel illud
facere; which plainly shows that that same particular was before amongst
others granted in the preceding general words. I shall here set down only one
example of each. King Edward the Second in the tenth year of his Reign, grants
a Patent of this Office to John-de Athy under these general words.

Rex omnibus ad quos, etc. salutem: Sciatis Rot. an. 10 Ed. 2. secu^da part
pat. m. 22
quod constituimus dilectum and fidelem nostrum Johannem de Athy Capitaneum
Navigii ad parts Hiberniae, etc. quamdiu nostrae placuerit voluntati, in
cujus, etc. Test Rege apud Claringdon 28 die Martii per brev. de privato
sigillo.

And he gives this Mandate upon the constituting of him, Et Rot. eodem memb.
eadem.
mandatum est Vicecomitibus, Ballivis, Ministris, and omnibus fidelibus Regis
Marinariis, and aliis ad quos, etc. quod eidem Johanni, tanquam Capitaneo
navigii praedicti, in omnibus, quae ad salvam and securam custodiam terrarum
praedictarum pertinent, consulentes sint, intendentes and auxiliantes, quotiens
opus fuerit, and per ipsum Johannem fuerint super hoc ex part Regis
praemoniti. T. ut supra per brev. de privato sigillo.

And having given this Command in general to all Officers, quod in omnibus
consulentes sint, intendentes and auxiliantes; yet lest they might perhaps not
understand one particular of extraordinary great power to be comprehended in
the Admirals Patent under these general words, constituimus Capitaneum Navigii,
by another Mandate he declares that he had made him Captain of the Navage, and
thereby given him this power; and these are the words of the Mandate.

Rex
omibus Ballivis, Ministris, fidelibus suis, ad quos, etc. salutem. Rot. eodem
memb. eadem.

Cum constituerimus dilectum and fidelem nostrum Johannem de Athy Capitaneum
navigii ad parts Hiberniae, etc. dedimus ei potestatem ad eligendum homines
sufficientes, ad arma potentes, prout sibi viderit expedire ad morandum secum
in navigio praedicto pro defensione and salvatione terrarum praedictarum, and
ad puniendum illos, quos in hac part contrarios invenerit, and rebels; and
ideo vobis, and cuilibet vestrum firmiter injungendo mandamus, quod eidem
Johanni in praemissis omnibus and singulis intendentes sitis and auxiliantes,
quotiens and quando per ipsum super hoc fueritis ex part nostra. praemoniti.

T. ut supra per breve de privato sigillo.
Now by the repetition of the Patent it self here, wherein not one word of this
particular is expressed, and by these words, dedimus potestatem, etc. we have
given him power, is plainly set forth and showed, that this particular amongst
others was granted under those words, Constituimus Capitaneum Navigii. But I
shall proceed to another example, where another particular is specified in the
body of the Grant, with an ita quod, after the Constitution it self, which
likewise shows that that particular was comprehended in the very
constitution, and granted before in the general words: And this is a Patent
granted in the 22 year of Edward the First, which follows in these words.

Rex, etc. Rot. Vescoyn. an. 22. Ed. 1. memb. 8.

quos per literas suas patentes sigillo suo signatas, assignare, deputare,
destinare voluerit, capere possint, and secum ducere homines idoneos and

expeditionem eorundem necessaria fuerint, and etiam quod capere possint
armaturas per visum dicti Capitanei, ab illis a quibus idem Capitaneus eas
viderit capiendas, dum tamen hujusmodi victualibus and aliis necessariis, quae
ad eorum, Capitanei nautarum and marinellorum sustentationem sic capita
fuerint, satisfacient illis a quibus ea ceperint, juxta rationabile pretium

The Record sets forth first the Grant in general, which is comprised in the
former words thereof, viz. Constituimus* Willielmum Leybourne Capitaneum
nautarum et marinellorum nostrorum, militum, etc.

Then it is declaratorie, and specifieth some particulars of his power, which
are comprehended under those general words of the Grant, which being not often
used or put in execution, might cause some to doubt whether ever they have been
used at all or not; and so to question whether such particulars were
comprehended in the Grant by those general words or not, being things of so
great and high authority and power: Therefore are these words ita quod
inserted, which do not import the concession of any further power or authority
then what was granted before: but in all manner of reading they intimate that
by the consequent words is understood or showed either some inherent or
adherent power, property, or quality, which is comprehended under the precedent
words.

It rests then that these specifical words inserted in this Patent, are only
declaratory, that such power and authority does belong unto that great Officer
and Governor of the Seas, by virtue of such his Office: for though first the
employment begets the Officer, and so consequently the Office; yet when it is
become an Office, the very constituting of the Officer, and granting of that
Office, is the granting of all the employment that has belonged thereunto.

These last cited Records do manifest the great power and authority which the
great Officers of the Seas had, and has over all manner of Shipping, Ships,
Boats, and Barges whatsoever, within the limits of his Jurisdiction, and over
all manner of men, ammunition, victual, tackle, and furniture thereunto
belonging; and the power and authority he had and has over all Sheriffs,
Bailiffs, and other ministerial Officers, who were and are to be attendant,
aiding, assisting, and obedient unto his and his Deputies Commands, in the
execution of the Office, of so great power and trust; yea, and they were and
are to be so attendant, and obedient, in regard and respect of the Office it
self; for the Records do run with an ideo, therefore: As Constituimus N.
Capitaneum and Admirallum, etc. vel similiter: Ideo vobis mandamus, etc. quod
praedicto N. Capitaneo, etc. in omnibus et singulis sitis intendentes, etc.

The Governor of the Seas having then with the assistance and obedience of
these other Officers, had so strong a power, and full authority and
jurisdiction from the King himself, over all these things: who else could have
any thing to do therewith, or with any differences, debates, controversies, or
whatsoever else arising from, or concerning the same?

CHAP. III.
That the Ports and Havens, and Creeks of the Sea, are within the jurisdiction
of the Admiralty.
IT is affirmed by some, whereof that most famous Lawyer Sir Edward Coke is
one, that the Ports, Creeks, and Havens of the Sea, are within the bodies of
the Counties, and are not within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty. His bare
assertion in his own learning may (I confess) very well pass for authority;
but in the decision of this matter, between that Jurisdiction he himself
exercised according to the municipal Laws of this Nation, and whereof he
himself was a Professor, and a Judge; and that other Jurisdiction exercised by
a Professor of another Law so distinct and different from his, viz the Civil
and Maritime Laws; he has in my judgment, shown himself extremely partial,
and much different in opinion from some others which sat in his place before
him, as I shall plainly show hereafter: And I must confess it sounds very
strangely in my ears, to hear that which has ever since the Sea was called the
Sea, been called an arm of the Sea, now called an arm of the Land, or an arm
of a County, or the part of the body of a County; much less then will it sink
into my understanding how it comes to be in the body or heart of a County, when
for the most part it separateth one County from another. But it has been an
ancient assertion and observation, that where any land or ground is gained from
the sea in one part, or on one side thereof, the sea does gain as much upon the
land in some other part, or on the other side thereof: And so it seems the sea
has gained upon the land of all or most other Nations on the other side, and
beyond the seas, insomuch that their Admiralties swell, and the sweetness of
that gain and profit they reap by Sea-trade and Commerce with other Nations,
has caused them to add daily new privileges thereunto, rather then to
diminish or take away any of the old. And England instead of what the sea has
gained upon the land of other Nations, has gained upon the sea; and being less
considerate or careful of the commodity and gain the Sea-trade and Traffic
brings it in, had once well-nigh quite destroyed that ancient Jurisdiction,
which is not yet quiet, but continually spurned and kicked at: for put all that
together which Sir Edward Coke would prove, and some that have followed him
would approve, and they would leave the Admiralty very liitle or no
Jurisdiction at all, and but little more then a bare and naked title, as shall
hereafter be showed.

And it would have sounded as strangely to me to have heard of ships lying and
riding at Anchor within the body of a County, but that I have heretofore often
heard of their often riding and lying at Anchor in Parochia Sanctae Mariae de
Bow in Warda de Cheap.

The Arguments that are by him used for the proof of this particular, that the
Ports and Havens are within the bodies of Counties, are confounded with those
whereby he endeavors to prove the Admiralty to have no Jurisdiction within
those Ports, Havens and Creeks; and what is used for the proof of the one, is
used for the proof the other, and will come to be considered altogether. Yet
when he has used all his arguments to prove these his assertions, out of his
ingenuity confesses the antiquity of this Jurisdiction to be fetched from far
more ancient times, then the reign of Coke Jurisdict. of Courts; cap. 22.
Edward the Third, in whose days (as says) some have dreamed it began. And
for proof hereof he sets down word for word (as he says) the Libel, (which I
have before quoted out of the Tower Roll, and is likewise quoted by Mr. Seldom)
of Edward the Firsts time.

And after that, Idem. Ibid.
to show that of ancient times there were several Admirals, for that (as he
affirms) the wisdom of those days would not trust one man with so great a
charge, nor any man to have a certain estate in an Office of so great trust, he
sets forth several of those Records which I have cited before out of the Tower
Rolls, for proof of the antiquity of that Jurisdiction, none of them serving at
all to his former purpose, but some of them may very well serve against it; as
that of the 15th year of Henry the Third; which he sets forth thus.

Petrus Ryvale Capitaneus Pictaniae habet ad totam vitam suam custodiam omnium
portuum, and totius costerae marinae Angliae, excepto portu de Dover, qui est
in custodia Rot. an. 15. H. 3.
Huberti de Burgo.

So that he reckons this man amongst the Admirals, (as indeed he could do no
less, he having that office and place) and he does acknowledge, that by his
Patent he had, custodiam omnium portuum and totius costerae marinae. Now to
have custodiam portuum, and to have no Jurisdiction or power in portibus, can
in no man's judgment seem less then a plain contradiction.

And in like manner he quoteth another of the 25th of Edward the First to the
very same purpose, which runs thus.

Johannes Botetort, custos Regis portuum maritimorum, versus parts An. 25 Ed.
1. prima part pat. m. 9.
Boreales, 25 Marrii. Now will any man say that John Botetort was the Kings
Keeper of his Maritime Ports, and yet aver that they are no part of his
Jurisdiction, or affirm that he had nothing to do therein or therewith? Surely
they be called portus maritimi, which are Ports belonging to the Sea, and Ports
so far from being within the bodies of Counties, that they do not so much as
belong thereunto; they are portus maritimi, Ports of the Sea, or belonging to
the Sea, or which warranteth our vulgar language, the Seaports, and are not
part of either Land or County, or of or belonging thereunto, and are absolutely
and properly the Homogeneal parts of that Homogeneum totum, the Sea, and and no
Heterogeneal parts of the Land, as the fresh water Rivers springing out of the
land, and contained in the bodies of the Counties thereof, are.

He instanceth in another Record of the 10th of Edward the Second (as he says)
but indeed is the 19th, which he sets forth in these words.

Nicholaus Kyriell An. 19 Ed. 2. 1. part pat. m. 12.
constituitur Admirallus flotae omnium navium, etc. tam quinque portuum, quam
aliorum portuum and locorum per costeram maris versus parts Occidentales,
quamdiu Regi placuerit. Test Rege apud Turr. London 8. Decembris.

And another of the first of Edward the Third, which runs thus.

Warrosius de Valloignes constituitur Capitaneus and Admirallus flotae navium,
etc. tam quinque portuum, quam aliorum portuum and locorum, per costeram maris
versus parts An. 1 Ed. 3. 1. part. paten. m 21.
Occidentales, quamdiu, etc ut supra.

The two former Records were, one of them in the Reign of King Henry the Third,
the other in the Reign of Edward the First; and these two are one of them in
the Reign of Edward the Second, and the other in the first year of Edward the
Third: And indeed most of the Records which are in the Reign of these four
Kings, ( viz. Henry the Third, and the 3 Edwards) which concern the grant of
this great Office, are of the same nature with these four, and run in such
like, or in the very same words with these but more especially, and most
frequently agreeable to these two last; and so do most of those Supra lib. 1.
cap. 1.
Grants which were in Henry the Fourths time, as may appear where I have set
them down in order.

And these may bear a double construction, and two several senses and meanings,
but not so different but that the best of them that can be made for the Quoter
of them will serve to confute and destroy his new-set-up opinion and assertion.

Take this construction first, and read them in this sense, Constituitur
Capitaneus and Admirallus flotae omnium navium, etc. Capitaneus and Admirallus
tam quinque portuum quam aliorum portuum, and Capitaneus and Admirallus omnium
aliorum locorum per costeram maris: That he is Captain and Admiral of the Fleet
of all Ships; Captain and Admiral as well of the Cinque Ports, as of all other
Ports, and Captain and Admiral of all other places by the Seacoasts toward
the Western parts.

And the first two Records of these four by him cited for concordancy and
agreement sake, do warrant this construction; and that the same may be made of
the words, as without any incongruity or trespass at all upon Priscian, so
without any falsehood at all of the matter: For the first two Records, the one
giving the Admiral Custodiam omnium portuum and totius costerae maris: And the
other making him Custodem Regis portuum maritimorum, do warrant the truth
thereof: And then are these two last a confirmation of the two first, and argue
the same thing, besides what else may be gathered out of them, against the
truth of that assertion. For certainly he that had Custodiam portuum, and was
Custos Regis portuum, had the rule, governance and ordering of all things in or
belonging unto those Ports, and that by way of Judicature, according to the
Civil and Maritime Laws: for it is plain by the Libel, Sir Edward Coke himself
has set down which I formerly quoted, Sup. lib. 1. cap. 5. mentionat. in
ipsissimis verbis repetit.
that these Admirals in these times had (...), Jurisdictionem sive potestatem
audiendi and determinandi causas secundum jus, as I have said Sup. lib. 2. cap.
1. and lib. 1. cap. 1.
before; or take the words as they run in the Patents themselves, viz. Rex
omnibus ad quos, etc. salutem. Sciatis quod nos de fidelitate probata and
circumspectione provida dilecti and fidelis nostri N. plenarie confidentes,
constituimus ipsum N. Capitaneum and Admirallum flotae nostrae, omnium navium,
etc. tam quinque portuum quam aliorum portuum and locorum per costeram maris
versus parts, etc. And afford them what construction can possibly be strained
out of them to save this assertion harmless, yet will it thereby be scattered
and torn all to pieces.

Take it then in this construction, viz. We make him Captain and Admiral of our
Fleet of all Ships of all Ports, as of or belonging to all Ports, etc. Will any
man say that he that is Admiral of all these Ships, that belong unto these
Ports, is not Admiral of them, whilst they lie or ride at Anchor within those
Ports, and are not riding super alto mari? and that he has not the rule,
governance, and command over them whilst they lie there? If so, let him say
likewise he has no power, governance, or command over them until he find or
take them upon the main sea, which Ships he never took out of any of those
Ports or any other.

The Admiral therefore must have jurisdiction and power upon the Creeks, Ports
and Havens, or else his power at sea will come to little or nothing. I shall
give you here but one instance which will show the necessity of his having
jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens as well as upon the high seas.

If one Ship shall do damage to another either upon the main Sea, or upon any
Creek, Port, or Haven, the damages must be sued for in the Admiralty Court, and
judgment given according to the Maritime Laws, which prescribe every Ship her
rule, how to steer her course, both going out to Sea, or coming home from Sea,
or riding at Sea; which plainly demonstrateth which Ship was in fault, by which
the Judgment must be regulated, for which the Common Law has no rules at all,
nor can any action properly by the rules thereof be commenced at that Law for
these damages: For that the Owners damnified can very hardly arrest all the
Owners of the other Ship which did the damage: nor indeed can any of those
Owners by that Law, as I have been by some of the learned of that profession
informed, be liable to such arrest, but the Master only; who, if solvent, will
not come on shore, but take his employment in some other Ship outward bound; if
not solvent, the arrest will be to little purpose: so that the remedy lies
only against the Ship by the Civil and Maritime Laws, according to the course
thereof, which proceeds in cases of this nature by way of several defaults,
etc. which either will bring in the Owners to answer the Action, or make the
Ship liable to make satisfaction for the damage done, in so much as she is
worth; which course of proceedings the Common Law has not.

CHAP. IV.
The Arguments deduced out of the Statute Law, to prove the Ports, Havens, and
Creeks of the Sea, to be within the bodies of Counties, and not within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, redargued.
HAd this been but a bare assertion, that the Ports, Havens and Creeks of the
Sea are within the bodies of Counties, and not within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, more needed not (I conceive) have been said then what has been
already said, in the former chapter: But the Arguments that are used for proof
thereof, will necessarily require a far larger discourse for answer
thereunto, and further confirmation of the contrary. For here I am to encounter
a great Antagonist, the forementioned Sir Edward Coke, sometime Lord chief
Justice of the Kings Bench, a man most famous for his knowledge and pains in
the Laws of this Nation, whose memory undoubtedly is still not undeservedly
honored: yet though my encounter be upon this disadvantage, I doubt not but to
give satisfaction to a Judge indifferent between both Jurisdictions and
Professions, as well in this point, as in some other things by him asserted.

For the proof of this point, he first asserteth the Statute of the fifth of
Eliz. 5. c. 5.
Elizabeth, cap. 5. which (says he) describes particularly the limits of the
Lord Admirals Jurisdiction, in these words: All and every such of the said
offenses before mentioned, as hereafter shall be done on the main Sea, or
coasts of the Sea, being no part of the body of any County of this Nation, and
without the Precinct, Jurisdiction and Liberty of the Cinque Ports, or without
any Haven, or Pear, shall be tried and determined before the Lord Admiral, etc.
So as (says he) by the judgment of the whole Parliament, the Jurisdiction of
the Lord Admiral is wholly confined to the main Sea, or Coasts of the Sea,
being no parcel of the body of any County of this Nation.

In answer hereunto, I do deny that these words in this Statute do prescribe
particularly the limits of the Lord Admirals Jurisdiction, if he mean his whole
Jurisdiction in general: but I will confess they do prescribe him certain
limits, quoad the increase of his Jurisdiction, by making the particular acts
before mentioned in the Statute, to be offenses, and punishable, and do declare
that his, and the Warden of the Cinque Ports Jurisdiction upon the main Sea,
shall be increased, by having granted unto them the cognizance of such of the
before mentioned offenses, as should be committed thereupon, and do restrain
his Jurisdiction within the Ports and Havens to what formerly it had, without
having any increase thereof by the Cognizance of such the before mentioned
offenses, as should be committed thereupon; and this appears plainly out of
the words by himself recited, viz. All and every such of the said offenses
before mentioned shall be triable thus and thus, not having any relation unto
any offenses, or causes triable, either before the Admiral, or cognoscible by
any other Judge.

And indeed if we look backward to those offenses before mentioned in the
Statute, which can be committed in or about the Havens or Ports, we shall find
that they are not of the nature of such Civil and Maritime causes, or offenses,
as are subject unto that Jurisdiction of the Admiralty. The particulars are
these.

1. That any Subject may carry Seafish forth of the Realm in any of the Queens
Subjects Ships, without paying Custom.

Now we know very well that the paying of Custom in every Port Town belongs
to a peculiar Office for that purpose, and the Admiral neither does, nor did
for many years meddle therewith.

2. That no person in any Port, City, Town, Market, or other place, shall set
price, make restraint, take or demand Toll, or Tax of any Seafish to be
brought into this Nation, being taken and brought in in Subjects Ships.

Here Port is taken for the Port-town, or Haven-town: for the prising, taxing,
and tolling of Commodities is done upon the land, after the goods are unladen,
and not whilst they are aboard the Ship or Vessel, and therein so stowed, as
that they can neither be numbered, weighed, nor viewed. And the Port Town is
here only collectively named with other Cities, Towns, Markets, and Places, (as
appears plainly by the words of the Statute, as they run together) to include
all sorts of Towns; nor does, or ever did the Admiral any more meddle with the
prising, taxing, or tolling of Commodities within any such Towns, more then he
does or did with the Customs thereof.

3. That no Pourveyors should take any Seafish, brought in such Ships, under
the forfeiture of the double value.

4. That no man shall buy of any Stranger, or out of any Strangers Bottom any
Herring, or other Seafish not salted, packed or casked, under pain of the
forfeiture of the fish so bought, or the value thereof.

5. That no Wares may be carried from any Port of this Realm to another.

6. That all Codd and Lings be brought into this Realm loose, and not in
barrels.

7. That no Wine be brought forth of France, nor any Wood brought into England
but in English bottoms, all under pain of forfeiture: And being so, they are by
this Statute become to be of the nature of prohibited Commodities; for
discovery whereof, there be in all Ports certain Searchers appointed which
bring the same under forfeiture; and the Admiral deals not therewith, but only
with such prohibited Commodities as are prohibited to be transported beyond the
seas, and are de facto so transported, having escaped the Searchers hands. And
in such cases the Admiralty has the power of punishing such as have so
offended; for that the fact cannot be made appear but by examination thereof by
way of Commission out of the Admiralty in the place where the said goods were
unladen and landed.

The restraint therefore upon the Admiral and Warden of the Cinque Ports by
this Statute in these cases, is, lest they, having Jurisdiction as well upon
the Havens and Ports of the sea, being parts and members thereof, as upon the
main sea, should ampliare jurisdictionem, and take the cognizance of these
things to their Courts, and abridge the Customers and searchers of that power
which belongs unto their offices and places.

And indeed this restraint in this Statute upon the Lord Admiral, the Judge of
the Admiralty Court, and their Surrogates, and upon the Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports and his Lieutenants, is a strong argument that in other matters
they have full power, governance, and cognizance upon the Ports and Havens as
well as upon the main sea; otherwise needed not these particular offenses to
have been excepted from their power and cognizance there: and this exception of
these particulars from their cognizance there, concludes other things in
general there done to belong thereunto: For quicquid accipitur in particulari,
praesumitur esse in generali: The Admirals cognizance upon the Ports and Havens
is by this Statute excepted from these particular offenses there done, and is
therefore presumed to be full in other general offenses thereupon committed,
and not otherwise excepted therefrom. And other rules there be that confirm
this Argument, as that, Id a quo fit exceptio, fit universale, ut possit
distribui: These particular offenses are excepted from the Admirals cognizance
upon the Ports and Havens: and therefore his cognizance there must be
universal; so that from that universal cognizance there, these particulars may
be excepted and divided. And, Id quod excipitur, seu subjectum exceptum, debet
contineri sub excipiente, seu eo a quo excipitur: and again: Quod excipitur
debet esse angustius eo a quo excipitur.

And further, the restraining of the Admirals Jurisdiction from meddling with
these particulars, upon the Ports and Havens, does not restrain his power from
meddling with other matters or offenses done, and committed thereon; for the
barring of his cognizance of these particulars there, is but a limitation of
his general power there; Et omnis limitatio fit per id quod subjecto aut
praedicato congreuenter inest.

For the Argument then, that is deduced from this Statute, which concludes
that the limits of the Lord Admirals Jurisdiction are thereby described, and by
the judgment of the whole Parliament (as is asserted) confined unto the main
sea, or coasts of the sea, there is no other question to be made of it, then
whether it shall overthrow and destroy all these Logical rules, or they it.
Another answer may be given to this argument, by distinguishing upon the word
Port or Haven, as it is taken in a double construction, and bears a double
acceptance, warranted by Mr. Sergeant Callis in his Callis in ^ect. apud Hosp.
Gran super stat. 23 H. ^. ca. 5. an. 1622.
Reading at Greys-Inne 1622. upon the Statute of Sewers 23 H. 8. cap. 5. who in
his first Lecture, to the diversity between a Creek, Haven and Port p. 24. 25.
says that a Haven properly is a safe place of harbor for Ships, but may be
without any privilege at all: and then makes mention of such as are always
graced with legal privileges; and for this he quoteth the Statute of Magna
Charta, in these words: Quod omnes communitates and Barons de quinque
portubus, and omnes alii portus, habeant omnes libertates and liberas
consuetudines: that all common Societies of Ports, and Barons of the
Cinque Ports, and all other Ports may have their liberties, etc. which can be
no otherwise understood, then that thereby is meant the common Societies of
Port-towns, the Barons of the five principal Port-towns, and all other
Port-towns may have their privileges, etc. so that a Port-town is ordinarily
termed a Port, as well as the Port it self; and so is a Haven Town, etc. though
not so properly. And the words of the Statute (says he) confirm my former
definition of Ports to be true; and this is his definition; A Port is a
harbor, and safe arrival for Ships, Boats, and Ballengers of burden to
freight and unfreight them at, not in: so that we see that he makes the Haven
where Ships lie at anchor, to be a Port, and the Town whereat they lade and
unlade, to be a Port; and so the same Author makes costeram maris to contain
the shore and banks, as well as that part of the sea adjoining thereunto: and
he proves it out of the Statute 27 of Eliz. cap 24. which Act was made for the
mending of the banks and sea-works on the seacoast. And out of the 7th chapter
of Macchabees, where Demetrius Son of Seleucus came to a City of the seacoast,
etc. ut in ejus libro p. 32. so that in common acceptance the places adjoining
to the Seacoasts for their adjacency, are called and taken for Coasts, as well
as the Coasts themselves; and the Towns or Cities adjoining to the Ports, for
their adjacency, are termed Ports as well as the Ports themselves: and then it
may very well be answered, that the words in this Statute, out of any Haven or
Port, are meant of the City or Town thereunto adjoining, and so called: and
this, the offenses in that Statute mentioned, unto which this clause has
reference and relation, will warrant. But more I shall not say concerning this
argument, but shall come to that which the same Author further infers upon
his own conclusion, when as his premises can no way be granted; which is that
of Job the 38th chapter, the 8, 10, 11. verses, That Almighty God (as he
himself out of a whirlwind spoke) has shut up the sea within certain doors or
bounds: Quis conclusit mare ostiis, quando erumpebat quasi de vulva praecedens?
Circumdedi illud terminis meis, and posui vectem and ostia, and dixi, Vsque huc
venies, and non procedes amplius, and hic confringes tumentes fluctus tuos.

Hence I do conceive that he would infer, that God then put the doors of the
seas, where he himself by his interpretation of this Statute would now put
them, between the high Seas and the Ports and Havens. But then he must have
said, that when God put them there, he then left them wide open, and never shut
them since; for sure I am the sea was never yet shut out of the Ports and
Havens, if we mean the Ports and Havens where ships do ride, or lie at anchor;
and not the Port or Haven Towns so termed, by reason of their adjacency so near
unto them. Nor can it be allowed by what is here urged, that there they were
put standing wide open: for he that says posui vectem and ostia, says and
dixi, Vsque huc venies, and non amplius.

So that we see his doctrine suits not to this text; but the text it self may
very well serve for my purpose, that God himself has put the gates and doors
of the sea, and has himself appointed its limits and bounds to be those,
within which it is by his own power terminated.

And look how far it extends it self, so far it is sea; and there, and no
where but there, has God placed these gates and doors, and terminated its
limits and bounds by man unalterable.

CHAP. V.
The Argument deduced from the first Judgment at the Common Law, that the
Ports and Havens of the Seas are within bodies of Counties, redargued.
OTher arguments there are by Sir Edward Coke, deduced out of the Judgments
and Judicial Presidents at the Common Law. I shall first begin with the
Judgments. And the first that he urges, is a Judgment given in the Court of
Common Pleas; Hill. 6 H. 6. Rot. 303. between John Burton Plaintiff, and
Batholomew Put Defendant; and the Case was (says he) upon the Coke Jurisd. of
Courts ca. 22.
Statutes of the 13 Rich. 2. cap. 5. the 15 Rich. 2. cap. 3. and the Statute of
the 2 Hen. 4. cap. 11. Stat. 13 R. 2. cap. 5. 15 R. 2. ca. 3. and 2 H. 4. ca.
11.
upon which Statutes the said Bartholomew having sued the said John Burton in
the Admiralty Court before Thomas Duke of Exeter, then Admiral of England, for
that the said John Burton with force and arms the second day of September anno
1 H. 6. an. 1 H. 6.
three ships of the said Bartholomews, with his Prisoners and Merchandises, to
the value of 960 marks 5 s. 5 d. ob. in the same ships being, did take and
carry away, supposing by his Libel the same to be taken away super altum mare,
upon the high sea, Judgment was given that the taking aforesaid was infra
corpus comitatus in Bristol, the said ships lying in the Haven of Bristol, and
not upon the high sea, contrary to the form and effect of the said Statutes;
the parties having descended to an Issue, which was found for the Plaintiff,
and damages to 700 l. And this is the Judgment he quoteth, Et super hoc audito
tam recordo quam veredicto praedicto, and per curiam before intellect.
consideratum est, quod praedictus Johannes Burton recuperet versus praefatum
Bartholomeum damna sua praedicta occasion attachiamenti prosecutionis, and
vexationis, quam missarum and custagiorum ad septuaginta libras per juratores
praedictos superius assess. in duplum per Statutum, etc. Quae damna in duplo se
extendunt ad mill and 400 l. Et idem Barthol. poenam december librarum erga Dom.
Regem nunc per statutum incurrat and capiatur, etc. querens remittit 400 l.

And he says that it appears by the Record, that this being the first Case
that can yet be found, that received judgment in the Court of Common Pleas
upon the said Statutes, and that the same depended in advisement and
deliberation eight Terms, whereby it plainly appears (the time being computed
from the making of the said Statutes, whereon this Action was grounded to the
time of the Judgment 6 Hen. 6.) that the Courts of Common Law had not for
above 20 years after the making of these Statutes, ever meddled with causes of
this nature. Nor can it (I am confident) be found that cases of this nature,
were any of those cases wherein the Admirals had encroached upon the
Common Law, before the making of the said Statutes; and what ground these
Statutes then gave them for this Judgment, I could wish he had reported with
the Judgment it self. The Statutes I have endeavored (to the utmost of my
weak skill) to examine one by one, but cannot find that in such cases as this
the Admiralty was by them in any wise prohibited to proceed: of which Examition
of mine, I shall hereafter render the best Account I can, more especially when
I come to treat of Contracts made at land of and concerning maritime and sea
affairs; Infra lib. 3. cap. 2.
but I must here in the first place examine the observations by Sir Edward Coke
himself gathered out of this Judgment.

From the whole he gathers these four observations.

1. That it is contemporannea expositio, being made within 20 years of the
making of one of the said Statutes; and he says that contemporanea expositio
est optima.

2. That albeit the said three Ships, with the Prisoners and Merchandises in
them, lay in the Haven inter fluxum and refluxum aquae, and infra primos
pontes, yet that the Haven is infra corpus Comitatus, and that for taking of
the Ships, with the Prisoners and Merchandises in the same, no Suit ought to be
had in the Admiralty Court, but at the Common Law.

3. That the Court of Admiralty has no Jurisdiction, but super altum mare,
which is not within any County; for the Record says (as he averreth) that the
said three Ships, with the Prisoners and Merchandises in the same, did lie
infra Comitat. Bristoliae, and non super altum mare, as the Plaintiff in the
Admiralty Court supposed the same to be.

4. That this Judgment so solemnly, and with such advisement given, if it were
alone, were sufficient to give full satisfaction in this point: for, says he,
Judicium est tanquam juris dictum, and judicium pro veritate accipitur.

I conceive that by two of these four observations (the first and the last) he
endeavors to prove that this Judgment is a good Judgment, which ought to
be observed ever after for Law; which if he has thereby proved, the two other
(the second and third) may be deduced into some conclusion, otherwise not. He
then that will examine the argument comprehended in these two observations,
must deduce it thus (or else he shall find no argument therein at all) viz. a
Judgment given per contemporaneam expositionem of a Statute or Statutes made
within twenty years after the making of one of them, and that solemnly upon two
years advisement given, is a good Judgment; which ought ever after to be
observed for Law. But this Judgment was given by a contemporary exposition of
the said Statutes, made within twenty years after the making of one of them,
and that solemnly with advisement by the space of two years; therefore this
Judgment is to be observed for Law ever after: then will the other two
observations be easily deduced into a conclusion; otherwise not. But I must
crave leave that without offense I may call into question the truth of the
premises, out of which this conclusion is deduced.

First then, whether a Judgment given per contemporaneam expositionem of a
Statute made within the space of twenty years next before such interpretation
or exposition (though solemnly advised on by the space of eight Terms, which is
two whole years) must necessarily be ever after observed for law, is that which
first comes in question. Under correction I conceive that neither the time of
such interpretation or exposition-making, nor the deliberate advisement
thereupon, conclude this necessity, that the Judgment thence proceeding must
be ever after observed, nay, I conceive it ought not ever after, or at all to
be observed, unless such exposition be grounded upon both law and reason, or at
least one of them.

This is said to be the first and leading Case, and so the first exposition of
those three before mentioned Statutes made to this purpose: and therefore the
law and reason whereupon such exposition had its ground and foundation, might
very well have been expected to have been there by him set down, where the
Judgment it self is urged; but finding neither, I have according to my weak
abilities endeavored to search both or either of them out; But indeed am so
thick-sighted, that I can find out neither the one nor the other to warrant the
same.

The Statute of the 5 Eliz. 5. before Supra cap. 4. hujus 2. lib. Super eod.
cap.
mentioned and urged for the proof of this assertion might, had it been made
before this exposition of the other three, have set some color thereon, but no
more then a color: for there is nothing therein contained substantial, that
could have afforded this interpretation of the other three; but coming after
this interpretation, this interpretation has lost that color, and is left
upon the Statutes themselves; wherein I for my part cannot find one word that
does seem so much as to lead toward any such exposition or interpretation.

The first of them is that of the 13 Rich. 2. 5. which Statute has relation
unto a Petition upon which the interpretation thereof ought to be grounded,
according to the manner of making Acts in those days; which Petition in other
Acts is inserted as a preamble to the Act it self; but in this is premised only
in part, and that not truly rendered by the Translation (as shall appear when we
come to treat of Contracts made at land for Infra lib. 3. cap. 2.
sea affairs) the Statute it self runs thus.

Le Roy voit que les Admiralls and lour deputees ne sic mellent de sore ana
vant de null chose fait deins le Roylme messolement de chose fait sur le mere
solonc ce que ad estre duement use en temps du noble Roy Edward ail nostre s^r'
le Roy quorust.

The Kings pleasure is that the Admirals and their Deputies shall not from
henceforth so meddle ( viz. as is complained of in the Petition) of any thing
done within the Realm, but only of a thing done upon the Sea.

Here sur le mere, I hope shall not be taken for super altum mare, when as the
Statute is so absolutely free from distinguishing any one part of the sea from
the other, or limiting the Admirals Jurisdiction unto one part thereof, more
than to another; but leaves all to his cognizance, Solonc ce que ad estre
dument use en temps du noble Roy Edward ail nostre sur' le Roy quorust,
according to that which had been duly used in the time of Edward the
Grandfather of the then King, which was Edward the third. Now do not I find,
nor do I believe that either the makers of this Exposition or their followers
can find that the Admirals Jurisdiction was in any part of Edward the Third's
time restrained to the main Sea, by any such distinguishing between the main
Sea and the Ports and Havens where all sea businesses are agitated. But this I
am sure of, that by the Records throughout his Reign the Admirals were
Capitanei and Supra cap. 3. hujus secundi lib. and cap. 1. lib. primi.
Admiralli omnium portuum and locorum per costeram maris (as has already been
showed) as well as of the main Sea; and by other more ancient Records (as has
been likewise showed) they were as well Custodes marinae and maritimorum
portuum, etc. as Custodes maris. And it is plain that in Edward the Third's
time, they had plenam potestatem audiendi querelas omnium and singulorum de his
quae officium Admiralli tangunt; and likewise Rot. an. 35. E. 3. prima part
pat. m 32 praecitat. in cap. 1. lib. primi.
cognoscendi in causis maritimis, etc. in causes belonging to the Sea: In
causis quae oriuntur ex maritimis negotiis, without any limitation or restraint
to one part or other thereof.

The second Statute is that of the 15th of R. 2. 3. which Statute has two
parts: the first considers the Admirals Jurisdiction exclusive, what things
he shall not have cognizance of; and it concerns Contracts, Pleas, and
Complaints, and other things done, arising within the bodies of Counties, as
well by land as by water, (and wreck of sea) which will come to be Infra lib.
3. cap. 5.
treated of hereafter. The second part considers his Jurisdiction inclusive,
retaining and upholding the same within the limits thereof: And in regard the
Sea flows sometimes further, and sometimes shorter upon the great Rivers,
leaving the extent of the Admirals Jurisdiction somewhat uncertain, it
therefore reduces it to a certainty, setting forth how far it shall extend,
notwithstanding it is said in the former part (as well by land as by water) and
distinguishes how far the water is to be taken to be within the bodies of
Counties, and how far not, which follows in these words: Nientmeyns de mort
de home and de maheym faitz en grosserniefs est-zantz and hooranz en my le haut
fill des grosses Rivers, tant solent per a vale les pontz de mesme; les rivers
pluis proheyms and mere, and en null autre luen de mesmes lez rivers eit la
Admiral conisance and auxint dare des niefs en les grant flotes pur grants
voyages du Roy and de Roylme, etc Nevertheless of the death of a man, and a
maim done in great Ships, being and hovering in the main stream of great
rivers, only Beneath those Bridges of the same rivers which are nearest to the
sea* and in no other places of the same rivers, the Admiral shall have
cognizance, and also to arrest Ships in great Flotes for great voyages for the
King and the Realm, etc.

Here the Bridges next to the sea by this Statute are appointed and put for the
limits to terminate each Jurisdiction, the one above, and the other below; and
I cannot think that any man can conceive that the expressing of some
particulars cognizable in the Admirals Court does restrain his cognizance unto
those particulars only: for certainly those particulars in the reading of this
Statute must and are emphatically expressed, and so understood, as expressing
that he shall have cognizance below those Bridges, even of things of the
highest nature belonging unto the cognizance of any Judge, even of the death
and maim of a man; yea, and shall have power to arrest great Ships for the
Kings service, and take them out of the hands and possession of the owners or
freighters of them, to what necessitous end soever designed, no ways at all
excluding his cognizance of things of a meaner and inferior For the word only
is not to be referred to any thing but to the first bridges, and not the
precedent words and things.
nature, but is thereby a confirmation of his cognizance in such things, and
the causes concerning them: nam si majus est, etiam minus erit: and cui majus
convenit, etiam minus, is a general rule: If one be stricken on the sea, and
dye on the land, the Common Law cannot try this Lacyes Ca^^
murder. And Mr. Sergeant Callis in his Reading gives this reason thereof,
that all Trials at the Common Law are to be by Jury, which must come out of a
proper County; which in this case cannot be, the Sea being in no County.

This being the reason, doubtless the Ports and Havens at the time of the
making of this Statute were not accounted to be within the bodies of Counties;
for if they had, the Jury might have been summoned out of that County, in whose
body the Port and Haven lay, whereon the death and maim of a man should happen,
for to have tried the same: but the Ports and Havens being not within the
bodies of Counties, so that the death and maim of a man thereon could not be
tried by a Jury summoned out of a proper County, according to the course of the
Common Law; therefore in express terms was the trial thereof appointed unto
the Admiral, who even in such cases then proceeded according to the rules of
the Civil Law, by which no Jury was required, but so much the more exact proof.

The same reason then, which is the reason that such an Act done at Sea could
not be triable by the Law of the Land, must be the reason why the like Act done
upon any Port or Haven should be triable by the Civil Law, and not by that Law.
But I shall proceed further to make it more plain, that this Statute neither
did, nor does limit the Admiral to the cognizance of those particulars only
which are mentioned therein to be done or happen below the first Bridges upon
the Ports and Havens.

All causes both Criminal and Civil, which have arisen from things done or
happening upon Ports and Havens, as before, so ever since the making of this
Statute (excepting the interruption made by this Judgment, and some others
which have hence sprang) have been triable and tried by, and before the
Admirals, their Lieutenants and Judges of the Admiralty Court, according to the
rules and grounds of the Civil and Maritime Laws, as will hereafter Inf^a cap.
9, 10, 11, 12, 13. hujus lib. 2. and cap. 1. lib. 3. ac etiam cap. 3. and 4.
ejusdem libri 3.
plainly appear, until the 28th year of Henry the Eigthth, in which year a
Statute was made which affirms this very assertion, quoad criminalia in these
words.

Where Traitors, Pirates, Thieves, Robbers, Murderers, and Confederates upon
the Sea, many times escaped unpunished, because the trial of their offenses
heretofore has been ordered, judged, and determined before the Admiral, or his
Lieutenant, or Commissary, after the course of the Civil Law, the nature
whereof is, that before any Judgment of death can be given against the
offenders, either they must plainly confess their offenses (which they will
never do without torture or pains) or else their offenses to be so plainly and
directly proved by witnesses indifferent, such as saw their offenses committed,
which cannot be gotten but by chance at few times, because such offenders
commit their offenses upon the Sea, and many times murder and kill such
persons, being in the Ship or Boat where they commit their offencs, which
should witness against them in that behalf and also such as should bear witness
be commonly Mariners, and Shipmen, which because of their often voyages and
passages on the Seas, depart without long tarrying and protraction of time, to
the great cost and charges as well of the Kings Highness, as such as would
pursue such offenders. For reformation whereof be it enacted by the Authority
of this present Parliament, That all Treasons, Felonies, Robberies, Murders and
Confederacies hereafter to be committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other
Haven, River, Creek, or Place where the Admiral or Admirals have or pretend to
have power, authority or jurisdiction, shall be enquired, tried, heard,
determined and adjudged in such Shires and Places in the Realm, as shall be
limited by the Kings Commission or Commissions to be directed for the same in
the like form, and condition, as if any such offense or offenses had been
committed or done in or upon the Land, and such Commissions shall be had under
the Kings great Seal directed to the Admiral or Admirals, or to his or their
Lieutenant, Deputy, or Deputies; and to three or four such other substantial
persons as shall be named and appointed by the Lord Chancellor of England for
the time being, from time to time, and as often as need shall require, to hear
and determine such offenses after the common course of the Laws of this Land
used for Treasons, Felonies, Robberies, Murders, and Confederacies of the same
done and committed upon the land within this Realm.

This Statute plainly shows, that before the making thereof, the offenses of
all Traitors, Pirates, Thieves, Robbers and their Confederates, done, or
committed upon the Sea, without distinguishing the main Sea from the Ports,
Creeks, and Havens thereof, or excluding them therefrom, as well as the
offenses of Murderers and Meighmers of men were ordered, judged, and determined
before the Admiral, his Lieutenant or Commissary: Nay, by the reason given in
this Statute for the alteration Or rather addition'd to the manner of trial;
for the other manner of trial is not taken away by this.
of this Trial, the Ports and Havens do appear to be comprehended in the word
Sea, where it is said that many times the offenders do murder and kill such
persons, and the Witnesses being in the Ship or Boat, where they commit their
offenses, which should witness against them in that behalf. Now surely all the
said offenses which were done or committed in Ships or Boats, and were
cognizable before the Admiral or his Lieutenant or Commissary, might be, and
were committed as well in Ships and Boats, which did ride or lie at anchor
within the Havens, Creeks, and Ports of the Sea, as upon the high Sea. Yet if
this be doubted, what follows in the Act will make it more plain, viz. That
all Treasons, Felonies, Robberies, Murders, and Confederacies hereafter to be
committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other Haven, River, Creek, or place
where the Admirals have, or pretend to have power, authority or Jurisdiction,
shall be enquired, tried, etc.

So that we see here the same criminal offenses acknowedged to have heretofore
been tryable by the Civil Law, and that it is now enacted, that hereafter the
same offenses committed upon the Sea, may be otherwise enquired, tried, etc.
And least any doubt should arise, how far the Sea heretofore extended,
therefore it is added, or any other Haven, River, or Place, where the Admiral
or Admirals have or pretend to have Power, Authority, or Jurisdiction.

Again, had these Havens, Rivers, and Creeks ever been within the bodies of
Counties, so that a Jury might have been had out of a proper County for the
Trial of these offenses thereon committed, then needed not this Statute have
appointed any such trial thereof by Jury, to be chosen out of any County
limited by the Kings Commission proper or not proper. Nor assuredly would this
Stature have given the cognizance of these offenses committed within the bodies
of Counties to the Lord Admiral and his Deputies.

Now if these Havens, Rivers, and Creeks were so far out of the bodies of
Counties, that a Jury could not, nor yet can be had out of a proper County, but
must be had out of any County by the King, in Chancery appointed, for the trial
of these criminal causes, arising from these offenses thereon commit, I
conceive it will seem strange that it should be affirmed that the same Havens,
Rivers, and Creeks should be so far within the bodies of Counties, that a
Jury might, or may be had out of a proper County, for the trial of such Civil
causes as might or may arise from Civil matters thereon had or done; so that I
cannot by the uttermost of my endeavor find out the foundation either of law
or reason, whereon this Judgment was built. Sir Edward Coke not seldom
terms it a Maxim in the Common Law, Quod nemo debet videri prudentior lege,
that no man ought to seem wiser then the Law: and truly from this Maxim (as he
terms it) I conceive, as strong a conclusion may be drawn, viz. Quod hisce
statutis nulli prudentiores videri deberent, none ought to have seemed wiser
then these Statutes themselves. But indeed as this Judgment has been by some
accepted as grounded upon law, so has it been by more, and those learned in
the Law, refused and rejected as not grounded thereon, as I shall hereafter
show, by Writs de Procedendo, awarded out of the Chancery upon Injunctions
thence granted, and Consultations both out of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas,
upon Prohibitions thence granted upon causes of the self same nature.

Now I hope by what has been said, and shall hereafter be showed, it plainly
will appear, that this first and leading Judgment was not so grounded either
upon law or reason, or upon so sound a foundation, as that men in succeeding
ages should build their judgments thereupon, nor so complete or fit a guide or
rule, as that Lawgivers should be directed thereby (although it had been
contemporanea statutorum expositio, made within 20 years of the making of one
of the said Statutes, and that upon two years advisement and deliberation, as
Sir Edward Coke affirms) which Induction, or minor Proposition, is as infirm
as the major, and both will leave the conclusion to stand alone without legs,
which must necessarily fall to the ground. First then, that this was
contemporanea expositio, made within the space of twenty years next after the
making of one of these Statutes, will not be made good; for the last of those
Statutes is that of 2 H. 4. cap. 11. which was anno 1400, and the Judgment was
given the 6 H. 6. Hill. which was anno 1427; and how this can be brought within
the compass of twenty years, which appears so plainly to be seven years without
the ^ompass, I know not. Besides, this Statute is only in confirmation of that
Statute 13 Ric. 2. 5. setting a penalty of double damage unto the party
grieved, and ten pounds to the King upon him that shall offend against this
Statute of the 13th of Richard the Second. Now it is true this Judgment does
pursue this Statute in giving double damages to the Plaintiff, and the penalty
of ten pounds to the King against the Defendant: But the giving of these double
damages and penalty is grounded upon the breach of the former Statute, unto
which only this has relation; and this Statute neither needed, nor had it any
exposition at all: But the Judgment was grounded upon an Exposition made of
the former Statute 13 Ric. 2. upon which (if the Statute would have born any
such construction) the Party suing in the Admiralty contrary to that Statute in
a cause of the same nature, would have before the making of the Statute of the
2d of H. 4. been liable to the single damages, though not to the double; but
the Law whereon this Exposition was made to ground this Judgment, ought to have
been some Law that declares a Haven to be within the body of a County, and
without the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and must needs have been before the
making of this Statute, if there had been any such at all, which I believe can
never be found or showed: For sure I am (as I said before) there is not one
word in the Statute it self, which can so much as seem to draw any man to
imagine that a Haven or Port should be within the body of a County; but however
it is the exposition of this Statute (though groundless) upon which the
Judgment is founded, and this Statute was made eleven years before the other;
and then will this contemporanea expositio, said to be within twenty years,
scarce fall to be within twice twenty years: For the Statute made in the 13th
year of Richard the second was made in anno 1389, and the judgment was given in
anno 1427 which is full 38 years; and ought not to have had an exposition put
upon it, clean destructive to another Statute made within two years after, and
in the same Kings Reign, which clears the Admirals Jurisdiction to be over
the havens and rivers beneath the first bridges nearest to the sea, even of the
death of a man etc. which is magis contemporanea et multo stabilior expositio,
being made upon as good advisement as this, though perhaps not upon terms of
deliberation, which consideration I come to consider next: And I cannot
conceive the advisement upon two years deliberation upon one particular point,
should render the determination thereof ever the more sound, but rather shows
a great deal of doubting and fearfulness to determine. But it seems after two
years deliberation they determined to have the Ports and Havens (without any
warrant of Law that Sir Edward Coke has declared, or that I can by any means
find) to be within the bodies of Counties. And truly I think the time was short
enough, and their pains great enough in that space, to turn so much sea, or
water appertaining unto the sea, into land, or into the heart of a County: But
if the foundation of this Judgment be infirm, surely it will not support it,
being so weighty a Judgment as it is, but that the same must fall to the
ground, and be buried in the earth, or drowned in the depth of that Sea, it
would have dismembered of its Ports, Creeks and Havens, unless whatsoever a
Court shall once adjudge through misapprehension, or any manner of
misunderstanding, must ever after be observed for law; which whosoever
affirms, must maintain some men to be infallible, or else that one injustice
may be a warrant for another: But if to persist in an error, be another, and a
greater error, then surely to square justice by so crooked and untryed a rule,
can produce no strait or upright future judgment. I must confess the
judgments of such grave and learned men, in such a place and authority, ought
much to sway with their successors in doubtful cases, and one judgment ought
as little as may be to thwart and cross another, but not unless the same be
agreeable unto justice, equity, right, reason, and binding laws, constituted,
appointed and published by superior powers, which are always to be observed.

CHAP. VI.
That from the two other Actions instanced in, to be brought against the
parties suing in the Admiralty Court for a business done upon the Ports, no
concluded Argument is deduced.
TWo Actions likewise are instanced in, instituted in the Court of the
Common Pleas to the same purpose, which can be deduced from no better reason,
nor founded upon any sounder ground then this first Judgment was, more then
that they had this for their example. ( At exempla mala sunt reprobanda, and
non L. 1. ad Senate. C. Maced.
sequenda) both of them Pasch. 12 H. 6. The one is an Action brought by Robert
Cupper upon the before mentioned Statutes in the Court of Common Pleas, against
John Raymer of Norwich; for that the said Raymer did sue the said Cupper in the
Court of Admiralty, for that he said Raymer having a Ship in portu aquae
Jernemuthae infra corpus com. Norf. ready for a Voyage to Zeland, the said
Cupper entered the said Ship lying in the said Haven, and took away diverse goods
out of the same, asserendo per praedictum placitum res illas super altum mare
emersisse, acsi res illae super altum mare emersissent, cum non ibi sed apud
Jernmutham contra formam Statutorum praedict.

The other was an Action between John Wydewell, and the said John Raymer the
same Term, in the same Court: but whether there were any Judgment upon these
two Actions, or not, or what the Judgments were, is not set forth: the
Judgments might be given for the Defendants, as well as against them for ought
appears out of what Sir Ed. Coke has set down; and since he has spared the
pains to set them down, I shall spare my labor for looking them out: If any
Judgment were given upon either, which I the rather conce^^ there were not;
for that if there had been any, Sir Edward Coke would not have spared to have
told of them, if they had been for his purpose. If the Judgments were given
agreeable to the former Judgment, and passed by that example, yet is there no
better ground for the same, made to appear for founding them upon, then for the
former, which is but a quakemire.

CHAP. VII.
The Argument deduced from two Praemunires instanced in to be brought against
the parties suing in the Admiralty for things done upon Ports, redargued.
BUt to keep some method, I must out of these things which Sir Edward Coke has
promiscuously urged against the Admirals cognizance of businesses done upon the
Ports and Havens, and of Contracts made upon the land for freight, Mariners
wages, tackle, furniture, and ammunition; and of things done beyond the seas,
etc. in the next place pick and gather the rest of those things which only
concern his cognizance of businesses done upon the Ports and Havens, and give
some answer to them first; and those are Praemunire's, Prohibitions,
Book-cases, and Authorities in Law: and then come in the third book of this
Treatise, to those things which he has urged against the Admirals cognizance
of or concerning Contracts made upon the land for freight, Mariners wages, etc.

Two Praemunire's he instanceth in, the one brought Mich. 38. H. 6. By John
Cassy Esquire against Richard Beuchampe, Thomas Paunce Esquires, and others,
upon the Statute of 16 Rich. 2. cap. 5. for sueing in Curia Romana vel alibi of
matters belonging to the Common Law, for that the Defendants did sue the
Plaintiff in the Admiralty Court before Henry Duke of Excester, that the said
John Cassy did take and carry away certain Jewels super altum mare, ubi idem
Johannes Cassy bona illa apud Stratford Bow infra corpus comitatus
Middlesexiae, and non super altum mare cepit, which (says he) is so evident,
and of so dangerous consequence, as no application shall be made thereof; but I
must (under favor) take leave to make some application, and some answer
likewise hereunto, and show that the urging ^oth of this, and the other which
he instanceth in, which is a Praemunire brought 9 H. 7. for a Suit in the
Admiralty Court before John Earl of Oxford, for taking and carrying away
quandam naviculam apud Horton Key at South-Lyn, etc. supposing the same to be
super altum mare, where it was infra corpus comitatus, is no way consequent or
concludent to prove the Ports and Havens to be within the bodies of Counties.

For the first of these, it is plainly affirmed that John Cassy did take away
the goods he was sued for in the Admiralty Court at Stratford Bow, being a Town
or Parish plainly within the body of the County of Middlesex, and no Haven or
Haven-Town. This suggestion being proved, the Admiral had no color at all to
take cognizance of this cause.

For the taking and carrying away of the little Ship, little Barque or Boat
(for navicula signifies either of the three) at Horton Key at South-Lynne, it
concludes nothing against the Admirals Jurisdiction upon the Haven or Port,
taken for the water beneath the first Bridge: for a Key is often taken for the
Wharfe, or place whereon goods are usually landed; but strictly it is taken for
the very separation of the land from the water, by wood or stone, or both in
such places as goods are usually landed at: and these are the keys that lock
those doors that Sir Edward Coke would have stand wide open, placed by God
himself to no purpose so far within the Seas. Now At Horton Key may be as
well on the dry side of the Key, as on the wet; as well upon the land as upon
the water: and little Ships, little Barques, or Boats are oftentimes drawn up
at the Keys, where they arrive, to be caulked and repaired, and might be from
thence taken and carried away perhaps from the water (their accustomed Element)
to the fire, wherewith for the most part, when they escape drowning, they are
at last consumed, when they are become unserviceable.

Again, these two Premunire's are said only to have been brought, and nothing
said of the event, or what was determined thereon; so that here is nothing but
the opinion of those that brought them, and no resolution of the Judges; and so
these two Praemunire's conclude nothing at all.

But grant two suppositions (neither to be granted nor supposed, unless proved)
viz. that these two severals Acts were done or committed upon Ports and Havens,
and that the determination and resolution of the Judges was against the
Defendants; yet he that will but look, may see the two foundations whereon
these determinations or resolutions were or should have been built, from whence
this land Argument is raised, to have been laid upon the sea sands, too
slippery a place for them to stand on; the one is that before mentioned
groundless supposition of the Ports and Havens being within the bodies of
Counties; for which no proof is offered; but that some against all reason, and
they know not wherefore, have taken them so to be. The other is the Statute
upon which these Praemunire's were brought, which he affirms to be the
Statute 16 Rich. 2. for suing in Curia Romana vel alibi, of matters belonging
to the Common Law.

This Statute consists of a Petition made by the Commons unto the King, and
the King's Answer thereunto, as all ancient Statutes of those days do. In the
Petition is first set forth that the King and all his liege People ought of
right, and of old time were wont to sue in the Kings Court to recover their
presentiments to Churches, Prebends, and other Benefices of holy Church, to
which they had right to present, etc. And when Judgment was given in the same
Court upon such a Plea and Presentment, the Archbishops, Bishops, and other
Spiritual persons, which had the Institutions unto such Benefices within their
Jurisdiction, were bound and did make execution of such Judgments by the Kings
Commandments, of all the time aforesaid without interuption, etc.

And in the next place they do complain, that of late diverse Processes had then
been made by the Bishop of Rome, and Censures of Excommunication upon certain
Bishops of England, because they had made execution of such commandments to the
open desherison of the Crown, etc. And further complaining that also it was
said, and a common clamor was made, that the said Bishops of Rome had then
ordained and purposed to translate some Prelates of the same Realm, some out of
the Realm without the Kings assent and knowledge, and some out of one
Bishopric into another, within the same Realm, without the Kings assent and
knowledge, and without the assent of the Prelates so to be translated, which
Prelates were much profitable and necessary to the King and his Realm; by
which the Statutes of the Realm would become defeated, etc. And nothing more is
contained in the said Petition, but what concerns the premises. The King in
his Answer does ordain, That if any purchase or pursue, or cause to be
purchased or pursued in the Court of Rome, or elsewhere, any such Translations,
Processes, and Sentences of Excommunication, Bulls, Instruments, or any other
thing whatsoever, which touch the King, against Him, his Crown and Regality, or
his Realm, as is aforesaid: And they which bring within the Realm, or them
receive, or make thereof notification, or any other execution whatsoever,
within the same Realm or without, That they, their Notary, Procurators,
Maintainers, Abetters, Fautors, and Counselors, shall be put out of the Kings
Protection, and their Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels forfeited to our
Lord the King, that they may be attached by their bodies, etc.

In these ancient Statutes, which are by way of Petition and Answer, the Answer
has always relation to the Petition, and grants what is therein desired;
sometimes less, but never more: by this Petition nothing is desired but the
restraint of the Popes power, and assumed authority in those things therein
expressed; nor is there any thing more in the Answer granted, if these words in
the genuine sense thereof be duly examined, which can be no other then this. If
any purchase, etc. in the Court of Rome, or elsewhere from the Pope, or any
Power or authority derived from him, viz. either in his Court at Avignon, which
he sometimes held there, or any other Ecclesiastical Court under his
Supremacy, whether beyond the Seas, or in the Realm of England: (For we well
know that in those days the Pope did challenge a power over the Ecclesiastical
Courts here as subjected unto him, as their supreme only, or at least as well
as the King) and of these Courts and none other can this [elsewhere] be
understood, as will plainly also appear, by the things specified in this
answer, to be purchased and pursued, viz. If any purchase or pursue in the
Court of Rome, or elsewhere, any such Translations, Processes, and Sentences of
Excommunications, Bulls, etc. Now cannot these things, nor could they
elsewhere, or in any other place besides the Court of Rome, be purchased or
pursued, but from the Pope or his Authority in those other Courts before
mentioned. Again, these words [else where] were necessarily inserted, and
necessarily to be understood of those Courts under the Popes authority, from
whom and whose authority those things were to be purchased and pursued (...)
otherwise, whosoever had purchased any of them elsewhere, to wit in any of
these other Courts, under his authority, and not in the Court of Rome, had not
been by this Statute liable to the punishment thereof. But some perhaps may
say, I have here purposely waved the general words, which close up the
particular specified things forbidden to be purchased, or pursued, viz. Bulls,
Instruments, o^ any other things whatsoever, which words perhaps may seem to
have relation to [else where] and be thought to be of so large an extent, that
the words [else where] must be stretched to all places whatsoever, beyond other
Courts of the Popes, or under his authority: But indeed I intended it not. But
as they are the last words, which close up the particulars specified, so I
reserved them to the last place, wherein I shall disclose and clear that doubt.

When several particulars then of the same nature are closed up with a general,
that general comprehends all other particulars of that nature, and nothing of
a different and distinct quality. So here these general words [or any other
things whatsoever] must be understood of any other thing whatsoever of the same
nature with those Translations, Processes, etc.

And this is plain enough by the words themselves, if seriously observed, and
rightly understood. For take them as they run, and they carry their limitation
with them, which binds them close, and restrains them unto what precedeth
in the Petition.

And as the Court of Rome and elsewhere, have relation to the Pope, to the
Popes Court at Rome, and unto his Courts elsewhere, so must these words
[Instruments, and other things whatsoever] have reference and relation
thereunto. And then take these words, as they answer the Petition, and they can
bear no other sense then this, viz.

Whereupon our Lord the King by the assent aforesaid, and at the request of the
said Commons, has ordained and established, that if any purchase or pursue, or
cause to be purchased or pursued in the Popes Court of Rome, or any other of
his Courts elsewhere, any such Translations, Processes, and Sentences of
Excommunications, Bulls, Instruments, or any other things whatsoever, which
touch the Kings protection, etc.

So that upon the matter Sir Edward Coke here does but tell us how these
parties were accused, against whom these Praemunires were brought; for
certainly this Statute in a right construction could not be applied against
them for suing in the Admiralty Court. And his instancing herein plainly
carraigneth the Judgment which he before used for an argument against the
Admirals Jurisdiction upon Ports and Havens, and indeed may sufficiently serve
to show how groundlesly a word in a Statute may be, and has been wrested and
caught at, to diminish and straighten the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and
enlarge the already extraordinary large power of the Common Law. Nor are these
Interpretations or Constructions in any wise contemporary with the Statutes (as
Sir Edward Coke would have them) but taken up a long time after, and crept into
their Law, as heresies do into Religion, by new constructions of Scripture:
Neither indeed can either the Judgment, or any of these Praemunires instanced
in be said to be contemporary with the said Statutes.

For further proof of this point, he instanceth in four or five Prohibitions
unto the Court of Admiralty, for holding plea of Contracts made upon Ports or
Havens, and beyond the Seas. But to these I shall give an answer hereafter,
when the Contracts made at land concerning Maritime affairs shall come to be
insisted upon.

CHAP. VIII.
The Book-Cases and Authorities brought to prove, that the Admiral has no
Jurisdiction upon the Ports, Creeks, and Havens, answered.
CErtain Book^Cases and Authorities (as Sir Edward Coke calls them) are
likewise urged for proof of this particular, of the Admirals having no
Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens.

1. Some Books are quoted, The Register; but quoteth not what place. T. N. B.
fol. 81. (...) F.
nothing being expressed what the Books say, nor any argument deduced out of them
to conclude the point: I cannot therefore give an answer to an argument
unframed, nor is it proper for me, my self to raise an argument out of those
books, and then my self to frame an answer thereunto. But I will conceive those
Authorities he has quoted at large, to make most for his purpose, and
endeavor to answer unto them.

He says in tempore Ed. 1. tit. Avowry 192. Temp. E. 1. tit. Avowry 192
a Replevin was brought for the taking of a Ship in the Coast of Scarborow in
the Sea, and for carrying the same from thence, into the County of N. Mutford
the Plaintiff counts of a taking on the Coast of Scarborough, which is
neither Town nor Place out of which a Jury may be taken, for that the Coast is
four miles long.

And also of a thing done in the Sea this Court has no cognizace, for certain
Judgment thereof is given for the Mariners. Berry chief Justice of the
Common Pleas; The King wills that the Peace be as well kept on the Sea as on
the Land; and we find that you are come hither by due-process; and therefore
ruled him to answer.

Out of which the Author observes four things.

1. That it is called the Sea, which is not within any County, from whence a
Jury may come.

2. That the Sea (being not within any County) is not within the Jurisdiction
of the Court of Common Pleas, but belongs to the Admirals Jurisdiction.

3. That when the Ship came within the River, then it is confessed to be within
the County of Northumberland.

4. That when a taking is partly on the Sea, and partly in a River, the Common
Law shall have Jurisdiction.

For the first Observation, which is, that that is called Sea which is not in
any County from whence a Jury may come; I may very well grant it, and he yet
never the nearer the proof of that he aims at, viz. that a Port or Haven is
within any County out of which a Jury may come, which is absolutely denied; the
reason whereof, as Sup. cap. 5. ^ujus lib. 2.
before, so shall be hereafter showed.

For his second observation, that the Sea not being in any County, is not
within the Jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, shall not be denied him:
but I must crave leave to observe with him, That notwithstanding this Ship was
taken upon the Seas, where there was neither Town nor Place from whence a Jury
could be taken; yet Berry the chief Justice took cognizance of this Cause, and
caused Mutford to answer: And this might have served him for as good an
Argument to have proved the Seas to be within the Jurisdiction of the Common
Law, as any that he has used to prove the Ports and Havens to be within the
bodies of Counties, and out of the jurisdiction of the Admiralty.

For his third Observation, which is, that when the Ship came within the River,
it is confessed to be within the County of Northumberland: I conceive, if Mutford
might at the Common Law have pleaded two Pleas, which in many cases is
necessary, and allowable by the Civil Law, he would as well have denied, that
ever he carried the Ship into the County of Northumberland, as he did aver
that he took her upon the Seas: and silence is not a consent, or confession,
where a man is tied to one plea; and has diverse to plead: This therefore is
neither confessed by Mutford, or any else, but by the Author himself, and such
as are of his party: for Berry neither affirms nor determines any such
thing, or causes him to answer upon any such ground, but upon this ground,
that the King wills the peace to be kept as well on the sea as on the land:
And indeed the grounds are both kept alike to sound the cognizance of this
Cause in the Court of Common Pleas, whereas the King, that wills the peace to
be kept as well on the seas as on the land, has provided, instituted and
appointed from ancient, and far past times, distinct Judges, Justices and
Officers for the keeping thereof on the one hand, and on the other: The
Admiral, his Deputies, and other Justices with him appointed for the keeping
thereof upon the Seas; and the Judges of the Land, and other Justices with them
appointed for the keeping thereof upon the Land; and neither have to do with
the others Jurisdictions: So that I cannot conceive, nor can I grant chief
Justice Berrys ground, whereon he founded this Replevin, and the taking this
Cause into cognizance to be Terra firma. And as for that which Sir Edward Coke
would have to be the ground of this Replevin, and cognition of this Cause,
namely because, after she was taken at Sea, she was carried into a Port or
Haven, which he accounts to be within the body of a County: If this should be
allowed for a good ground, then must all Reprizals taken at Sea by Letters of
Marque, and brought into the Port and Haven, be exempted from their
condemnation in the Admiralty Court for lawful prize, and may be set free by a
Replevin granted from the Common Law; and whatsoever fact done upon the Seas,
either by ship or man, the ship or man repairing to Port or Haven, Justice must
be had against them from the Common Law: So that by this construction, the
Admiral shall have no cognizance of piracy, robberies, etc. committed at Sea,
either by the course of the Civil Law, or by the course of the Law of the Land
upon the before mentioned Statute of Hen. 8. but if the Pirates, or Robbers,
etc. shall escape, and bring that which they have stolen, or by violence taken
away, etc. into any Port, or Haven or to land, this pyracy, robbery, etc. shall
be tried at the Common Law. And as well may it be said that if they shall be
taken upon the Sea, and afterward be brought into any Port, or Haven, or to
land, that then the Admirals Jurisdiction cease, and the trial belongs to the
Common Law: So that the Admiral must go set up his Tribunal upon the high Seas
(as Sir Ed. Coke distinguishes them) if he will have any Jurisdiction at all.
And whatsoever injury shall happen to be done at Sea by one Ship unto another,
the Ship which did the injury, by repairing to her Port or Haven, shall free
her self from the judgment of the Admiralty Court, etc. and the Common Law
shall free the Judge of the Admiralty, and all the Officers belonging to that
Court from any further attendance there, which doubtless was the aim of the
Author, as will plainly appear, when I shall come to sum up all he would have:
And I wish it be not the aim of a great many still, whose aim for their own
ends must necessarily be destructive to a general good, as shall be likewise
hereafter shown.

For the Fourth Observation, which is that when a taking is partly on the Sea,
and partly in a River, the Common Law shall have the jurisdiction.

For this partly taking on the Sea, and partly on the River, I must confess I
know not how it can be: for a Ship is either taken or not taken, when she is
taken at Sea; or taken or not taken, when she is taken upon the River, unless
we can say that one part of the Ship was upon the Sea, and the other part of
her upon the River, at the very instant time of her taking. But if the
jurisdiction of the Admiralty may have its right, we shall have no need of a
Mathematitian to strike a line between the Sea and the River, to make the
distinction, for indeed this distinction will be altogether needless.

But this Observation having relation to the matter of fact from whence it is
drawn, this meaning of taking partly on the Sea, and partly on the River, must
be that a Ship is so taken, when she is first taken at Sea, and then brought
into some Port or Harbor, which I shall leave to the judgment of the world,
whether this Ship was taken on the Sea, or on the River, or can be said to be
taken partly on the Sea, and partly on the River.

And if this shall be determined to be a taking partly upon the Sea, and partly
upon the River; and that therefore the Common Law shall take cognizance
thereof; I must say (as I said before) the Common Law hereby shall take the
whole Jurisdiction of the Admiral to it self. For what ship can be taken at
sea, or to what end shall any ship be taken at Sea, if she shall not be brought
into some Port or Haven, that she and her goods may be there disposed of? And
indeed all Ships that be there taken by Letters of Marque, must be brought into
Port or Haven before they break bulk: And the Common Law shall hereby cast off
all Rules, and Laws of the Sea, whereby causes of that nature have been always
(such interruptions excepted) discussed, tried, and determined between us and
foraign Nations, and between our own Merchants, and seafaring men, and try,
and determine them without either Rule or Law: For I could never yet find that
the Common Law ever afforded either Books, or Presidents to guide or direct
them in the adjudging, and determining of causes of that nature, which is a
thing most requisite and necessary, the Forraigner (between whom and us such
cases for the most part happen) expecting to have his Ship and goods
confiscated and condemned, or quit, and restored upon the same terms, and
according to the same Proceedings, Rules and Laws, as ours are in foraign
parts, which the Common Law affords not, being only a municipal Law for the
guiding and governing of the Subjects of this Nation in their land affairs at
home.

Again I would gladly know how this Observation agrees with Lacies Case,;
where one was stricken on the Seas, and dyed on the Land, the Common Law could
not try this murder; and Sergeant Callis in his reading at Gray's Inn, An.
1622. in prima Lectura p. 19. Serj. Callis in 1. Lect. apud ^esp. Grai. An.
1622.
gives this reason thereof, because that trial was to be by a Jury which must
come out of a proper County, which could not in this case, because the Sea was
not within any County. In this case the party received a mortal wound at Sea,
and was brought unto Land and there dyed; in the other case, the Ship was taken
at Sea, but brought into a Haven, and there unladen; here the party may more
properly be said to be partly killed at Sea, and partly killed at Land, then
the Ship can be said to be partly taken at Sea, and partly taken at Land, and
yet the Land shall not find a Jury for trial of one, but the Sea Port shall
find a Jury for the trial of the other, which I shall leave to be observed
upon this his fourth observation, how far the same will hold water.

Next he urges that 8 Ed. 2. tit. Coron. 399. it is no part of the Sea where
one may see what is done on one part of the water, and of the other; as to see
from one Land to another: And that the Coroner shall exercise his Office in
this case, and that of this the Country may have knowledge, whereby it appears
(says he) that things done there are tryable by the Country (that is is to say
by Jury) and consequently not by the Admiralty Court.

And after in another place of the same chapter he urges Stamford l. 1. part.
Coron. fol. 51. 6. Stam. pl. coron. li. 1. fol. 51. 6.
to this very purpose: the reducing which together can be no wrong to his
Argument, but rather a strengthening; for vis unita fortior, and so undertake
the answering of both together.

And this is that (which he says) Stamford says: If one be slain upon an arm
of the Sea, where a man may see the land of one part and of the other, the
Coroner shall enquire of this, and not the Admiral, because the Country may
take cognizance, and does vouch the said authority of 8 Ed. 2. whereupon he
concludes in these words: So this proves that by the Common Law before the
Statute of 2. H. 4. the Admiral had no Jurisdiction but upon the high Sea;
which only authority (says Sir Edward Coke) is sufficient to overruled all the
said questions; for (says he) hereby it appears, that the Jurisdiction of
the Admiral is only confined by the Common Law to the high Sea, and agrees
with all the Book-cases and Acts of Parliament.

For the first 8 Ed. 2. which says that it is no part of the Sea where one may
see what is done on one part of the water, and on the other; that is indeed to
be on the one side of the River, and see and discern what is done on the other;
and that must be so to see and discern, that he may perfectly judge of the
action, yea, and certainly of the party acting too, else can this seeing be to
no purpose. And hereby it may appear that the Admiral had in those times
Jurisdiction upon all ebbing and flowing Rivers, so far as they continued of
such breadth, that one standing on the one side of the River could not see nor
discern what was done, and by whom on the other side: So that his Jurisdiction
in some places extends far above the first Bridges; for what man is so
quick-sighted, that standing on the one side of the Thames, above the Bridge,
can so discern as to judge of the actions of men on the other; and who, and
what manner of men they are? For to see, and not so exactly and judiciously
discern in the adjudging of such actions, is as much as not to have seen at all.

But this being too ambiguous and uncertain a distinction between the Sea
Jurisdiction, and the Land, by reason of the different breadths in one and the
same River, and the different apprehension of things by several men's eyes, and
difference of the air at several times, being sometimes thick and cloudy,
sometimes serene and clear: The next Bridges unto the Seas have been always
held the most certain distinction between them. But indeed this Record is
stretched further, and indeed so far that it is impossible it should hold; for
by Sir Edward Coke it is thus set down: It is no part of the Sea where one may
see what is done on one part of the water, and of the other (as to see from one
land to the other) as if there was no difference between seeing what is done on
the one part, and the other, and seeing from one land to the other. Here to
make sure work with the Ports and Havens, and to bring them within the compass
of the Coroners Office, he will bring the main Sea, his altum mare, likewise
within the compass thereof: For he that will make that to be no part of the Sea
where one may see from one land to the other, must needs make France and
England to be one Continent, which I see he spares not to do, against the
opinion of the world; for sure I am a man may see from Dover to Callis, and yet
all men have accounted Callis beyond the seas, from Dover, and Dover beyond the
seas from Callis; and yet for all this, if it were possible with modesty to
grant him so much, yet can I not grant that, because the Coroner might exercise
his Office in this case, therefore the Admiral cannot exercise his; for it is
but argumentum ex contingenti, non ex necessario.

Now for that which he has out of Stamford Stam. pl. ^oron. li. 1. fol. 51. 6.
to the same purpose, but uses in another place of the same chapter to make
his arguments seem the more in number. Stamford is not so confident of the
truth of this assertion, as he is, and puts it not as his opinion agreeing with
the Record, but by way of a quaere, seeking only what may be inferred from that
Record.

He in that place sets down the diversity of opinions of their Books,
concerning the extent of the Coroners Office; and says that Nedham says, Que
Coroner ne poit inquirer das cun felony fors que de mort d' homme: that the
Coroner cannot enquire of any felony but of the death of a man, and yet he
says que in Northumberland Idem. Ibid.
ils inquir oient de touts felonies mes cel authority ils maintenont per
praescription, etc. That in Northumberland they enquire of all felonies, but
this authority they maintain by prescription; and he says that tit. coron. in
Fitz. H. p. 206. present fuist devant le Coroner que un tiel prise pur felony
conduct fuit ad Esglise per certem freres and adjudge vois presentment eo que
il ne parent inquirer de ceo, Fitz Herb. pl. 206.
ratione officii, etc. It was presented before the Coroner, that such a one
taken for felony was conveyed to the Church of certain Friars, and it was
adjudged a void Presentment, because he could not enquire thereof by virtue of
his Office, etc. then he quoteth Britton Britt. fol. 6.
fol. 3. on the contrary, who says Que il parent inquirer de rape de femme and
de debruser de prison quex sont author felonies que nest mort d' homme, etc.
That he may enquire of the ravishment of a woman, and of breaking of prison,
which are other felonies, which are not of the death of a man. Then follows
that which is here urged after this uncertainty of the Coroners power, thus set
down: Ideo quaere, etc. si un soit occise on rees in les bracher on sauses del
mere lon homme pent veier terre 'd un part and d' author, le Coron. inquira de
ceo and nemy Admiral eo qui le pais rent been de ceo aver conusance; Quod vide
titulo praedicto Stam. tit. draed. p. 399.
p. 399. Issint ceo prova que per Common ley devant le Statut An. 2 H. 4. c. 11.
l' Admiral naver Jurisdiction se non sur le haut mere, wherein he mis-quoteth
the said Statute, and does not rightly urge the words thereof, there being no
such word as haut either in that Statute, or in the Statute of 13 Rich. 2. of
which the latter is only a confirmation with a penalty, the words being only
sur le mere, and not sur le haut mere; and from this mis-cyting he raises a
doubt, which otherwise would have been none, Ideo quaere, therefore seek or be
advised, whether or not, if one be slain upon any arm of the Sea, where a man
may see the Land on one part and on the other, the Coroner shall enquire
thereof, and not the Admiral; because, or for that the Country may take
cognizance of it, which (says he) see in the said title p. 399. So (says Sir
Edward Coke) this that is deduced and drawn from this authority, does prove
that by the Common Law, before this Statute of 2 H. 4. c. 11. the Admiral had
no Jurisdiction but upon the high sea, whereas Stamfords Quaere rests still
upon this point; and he declares not his own opinion therein, but leaves this
as doubtful still, as he did the extent of the Coroners Office concerning
Felonies before, which he might very well do, this being raised upon so
mistaken a ground, which if it had been rightly cited, he might have easily
determined against Mr. Coro^^* and have left no doubt behind him.

Now we may see plainly by what Sir Edward Coke says in the first place, where
he voucheth this Record, that the Record (as I said before) is very far
stretched, and part which is from thence deduced and drawn very far fetched, to
make seeing what is done on one part of the water, and of the other, to be
seeing from one Land to the other; this by no Logical Rule can be allowed; the
other may, That is, a seeing from Land to Land, with the limitation before
mentioned, viz. to so to see as perfectly to discern what is done on the other
part of the water. Take this seeing then with that limitation, without which it
is as good as no seeing (for a man to see, and not discern what he sees to
guide and direct his Judgment, helps that man nothing in his knowledge of
what he is about to judge by his seeing) as I have said before. For doubtless
the foundation of this opinion, if it can be founded upon any reason (which all
opinions are pretended to be) must be that the witnesses being on Land on one
side of the River may before the Coroner give their testimonies to the Jury of
and concerning a fact, which they saw and discerned to be done, and how and in
what manner the same was done on the other side, and so ex consequenti of a
fact done, and how and in what manner the same was done upon the same River, in
what part thereof soever, even in the extreme part thereof toward the other
side to the very bank; for that a quarrel, etc. might, or may be begun on one
side, or in the midst, or on any other part thereof, and be determined by the
death of one or more, on the extreme part thereof, toward the other side, that
there may be some color to fetch a fact done upon such a River within Mr.
Coroners cognizance, and the rather because the witnesses upon the shore might
happily be land-men, which by his authority might be called to give their
testimony in such a case: whereas in case the like fact should happen to be
committed in a Ship, or other Vessel upon the Port or Haven, where the
witnesses present at such fact, and might see and discern the same, for the
most part were seamen, which had recourse usually to other Ships and Vessels,
as well as the same where the fact was done, and committed, and were and might
be without the reach of his power and authority, or any other, except the
Admirals, who (if they were in any Ship or Vessel at an Anchor, either on the
Sea, or on the Haven or Port) by his authority might call them, and have their
testimony; or if gone in any voyage to any forain parts, might by Commssion
have them examined sub mutuo vicissitudinis obtentu, and receive their
testimony. Now this seeing being rightly thus understood, the Lord high Admiral
of England will not so soon, nor so easily be thrust out of his Jurisdiction
upon the Ports, and Havens of the Sea, by the Coroner of a County, or by the
Common Law eitheir, as Sir Edward Coke by that which is deduced and drawn from
this authority, would have him.

Yet (says Sir Edward Coke) this only Authority is sufficient to overruled
all the said questions: For (says he) hereby it appears that the
Jurisdiction of the Admiral is only confined by the Common Law to the high
Sea, and affirms that it agrees with all his former Book-cases, and Acts of
Parliament: For the Book-cases, I cannot deny, but that they are much alike,
but all of them together not sufficient to make a sufficient proof, for that
which he would have, and against that which is denied him. For its agreeing
with the Acts of Parliament, I wonder he should aver it, seeing this very
point, even in this particular concerning the death of a man upon the Ports,
and Havens, is so clean contrary to what the Statute of 15 of Rich. 2. c. 3.
Stat. 15. R 2. c. 3.
in express words says; de mort de homme and de maheym fitz en grosses niefs
esteantz ethoverantz en my le haut fill de grosses Rivers, tant solement
peravale lez pontz de mesme les Rivers, pluis procheyns al mere et en null
autre lieu de mesme les Rivers est l'Admiral cognissance; of the death of a
man, and of main done in great Ships, being and hovering in the main stream of
great Rivers, only beneath the Bridges of the same Rivers nigh to the Sea, and
in no other places of the same Rivers, the Admiral shall have cognizance, which
is a thing needed not, nor would have been provided for by this Statute, if a
Jury could have been had out of a proper County for the trial thereof, which is
a thing requisite by the Common Law, as in Lacyes Case Supra cap. eod. May 1.
58.
twice already cited upon other occasions; and as by Sergeant Callis his
reading likewise in the same places. So then for this particular concerning the
death of a man upon a Port or Haven (which is the foundation of this Argument,
that the Admiral should have no Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens) it
rests only in question whether the Statute shall overruled Sir Edward Coke,
or Sir Edward Coke the Statute, and ancient Law and Practice of the Admiralty.

This next thing he urges against the Admirals having Jurisdiction upon the
Ports and Havens, is the 43. Ed. 3. 43. Ed. 3.
which (says he) the Lord Dyer Dyer term Mich. 15. 16. El.
voucheth in Mich. 15. and 16. Eliz. (saying quod vidi) The Case is that the
Abbot of Ramsey was seized of the Manor of Brancaster in Norfolk, bordering
upon the Sea, but more especially upon 60. acres of Marsh of the said Manor,
upon which the Sea did flow and reflow, and yet it was adjudged parcel of the
Abbots Manor, and by consequence within the body of the County unto the
low water mark.

This argument cannot so much as seem to carry him so far as he would have
gone before; for hereby he pretends the body of the County to reach only unto
the low water mark, and that only by consequence, which consequence will not
hold; For as Call^^ l^ct. in H^^p. G^^ii p. 26 u^i citat calu^. d^m. Hen.
Con^^able.
Sergeant Callis in his Grays-Inne Reading says, p. 26. in Sir Henry
Constables Case, the Citizens of Bristol claimed Flotzon (goods floating on the
Sea) by custom, and in B^act. c. 12.
Bracton cap. 12. one alleged to be discharged of Toll or Custom on the Seas
by praescription; in the Case of the Swans, in 7. Coke Rep.
Sir Edward Cokes 7th Report, one prescribed to have a game of wild Swans at
Abbots-beery in a Creek of the Sea, which is a member or arm thereof. And in
Sir Henry Constables Case it is taken and received for Law, that a Subjects
Manor may extend to the low water mark by praescription; yet is not the
Admirals Jurisdiction at all hereby taken away upon the same places: For Sir
Sir Ed. Coke himself in the same case declares, that the Judgments of the
Common Law have been both for the Admirals Jurisdiction, and the Jurisdiction
of the Common Law, both upon one and the same place, at several times: For
says he, Fuit resolve per totam curiam que le soil sur que le mere flow and
reflow, sc. inter le high water mark, and le low water mark poet ce parcel d'

It w^^ resolved (says he) by the whole Court, that the soil upon (...) the
(...) does ebb and flow, to wit, between the high water (...), and the low
water mark, may be parcel of a Manor of a Subject, 16 Eliz. Dyer 326. 6 acc.
(...)
and so it was adjudged in Lacyes Casus Lacy Trin. 25. El.
Case, Trin. the 25 of Eliz. in this Court, and so it was resolved, when the
Sea does flow unto the full height, the Admiral shall have Jurisdiction of any
thing whatsoever done upon the water, between the high water mark, and the low
water mark, by the ordinary and natural course of the Sea. And so it was
adjudged in the same Case of Lacy, that a Felony done upon the Sea at full Sea,
between the high water mark and low water mark by ordinary and natural course
of the Sea, that the Admiral shall have Jurisdiction: And so when the Sea
returned, the ground may appertain to a Subject, and every thing done upon the
ground when the water is returned, shall be tried at Common Law, because it is
then parcel of a County, and within the body of a County; and with this agrees
that of the 8 of Ed. 4. 19. 8 Ed. 4. 19.
So note that beneath the low water marks the Admiral has the sole and
absolute Jurisdiction; and between the high water mark and the low water mark,
the Common Law, and the Admiralty shall have severally Power interchangeable,
as aforesaid, to wit, the one upon the water, and the other upon the Land; so
it plainly appears by what himself has declared, that though the Land from
the high water mark to the low water mark, may be said to be within the body of
a Country, when the water is off it, yet is it within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, when the water does overflow it; And this will prove no argument at
all why the Admiral should have no Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens, but
rather an argument a fortiori, vel a majori ad minus, that he shall there have
Jurisdiction. For if he shall not be excluded from his Jurisdiction in those
places, where the water recedeth and leaves dry land of use and profit, which
may be claimed by the Lord of a Manor as parcel of that Manor; much less can
he be excluded from his Jurisdiction in the Ports and Havens from whence the
water does never clearly recede, or where no man does or can challenge any
right of possession: And again shall he not be excluded those places in the
exercise of his Jurisdiction, where seldom or never, and little or nothing
falls under his cognizance? And shall he be excluded those places in exercise
thereof, where things of the same nature, and by the same Law determinable of
greater consequence, fall under his cognizance almost daily and hourly? If so,
we may very well suspect the reason and cause thereof, that it came so to be,
not for any good intended, either to the Commonwealth or good people thereof,
but for some private end. S^. ampliare Juridictioonem in quibus non est
amplia^da, etc.
To this he adds, that it was adjudged Paschae 17. Eliz. (...). scac. Pasc.
17. El.
in the Exchequor, Diggs being Plaintiff, that the land between the flowing and
reflowing of the Sea belonged to the Lord of the Manor adjoining, as the Lord
Dyer does there report, but to this I shall not need to strive to give any
other answer, then to the former. To that of the 48. Ed. 3. and the 3.
concerning the contract for Mariners wages, I shall give an answer when I shall
come to handle the other contracts made at land. It is further objected that
46. Ed. 3. and the 3. 46. Ed. 3. 3. tit. tit. connusance. 36.
tit. conusance 36. an account of trespass was brought for taking of a Ship in
the Haven of Hull against certain persons: The Mayor and Bailiffs of Hull
demanded cognizance by the Charter of the King granted unto them, that the
Citizens and Burgesses of Hull, shall not be impleaded alibi de aliquibus
transgressionibus, conventionibus and contractibus infra Burgum, etc. quam
infra Burgum; And the cognizance was granted, which proves that the Haven of
Hull, where the Ship did ride, was infra Burgum de Hull, and by consequence
infra corpus comitatus, and determinable by the Common Law, and not in the
Admiralty Court. Which conclusion no Logician will allow ex necessario to be
deduced out of the premises, vix ex contingenti; nor will any Law (as I
conceive) allow it, that two contending at Law for that which belongs to
neither of them, though it shall be adjudged to one of them, that this shall in
any wise be prejudicial to a third party that has right thereunto, but that he
may by the same Law recover the same.

Several Cities and Boroughs, especially upon the Sea Coasts, do challenge
several privileges, some by prescription, and some by grant, as is already set
forth in this Chapter, as Flotson at Bristoll, etc. and the Cinque Ports have
their Admiralty Jurisdiction ab antique; yet does not this make their Ports and
Havens there to be part of their Towns, or make them to be within their
Boroughs, but within the compass of their privileges; nay it rather shows
the contrary. For things done upon their Ports, they have their Admiralty, and
do, or ought to proceed according to the Rules of the Civil and Maritime Laws,
Talem habent Jurisdictionem ratione Portuum, non ratione alti maris, and are to
give Judgment according to the same Law, as the Vice-Admirals of several parts
do, from which Judgments given in any Port-town, (except the Cinque Ports
where the appeal lies only to the Warden thereof) an appeal lies to the high
Court of Admiralty, as it does from the Vice-Admirals Court; and for other
businesses done within their Town, they proceed according to the Common Law and
they have their several distinct Officers for businesses of the one nature, and
the other, as their water-Baliffs for the one, and the land-Baliffs or
Sergeants for the other; and if the Ports and Havens were not within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, I know no use that Cinque Ports, or any other;
Ports can have of an Admiralty by themselves (as absolutely and clearly the
Cinque Ports have) seeing that the Lord high Admiral of England has that
Jurisdiction of the main Seas, together with all Ports not so privileged. And
it cannot be less necessary for all the other Ports to have all their
businesses agitated therein, tried by the Civil and Maritime Laws, then it is
for the Cinque Ports.

Hull, no doubt, has great and large privileges; but whether they extend unto
things done upon the Port or Haven there, without the authority of the Admiral,
I know not: It is like enough it may, which being made known, the cognizance of
this cause might very well be dismissed from the cognizance of the Judges, and
left unto the Major and Bailiffs of that Town. Howsoever take it that the cause
was dismissed only upon that ground which is here set forth, viz. that the
Citizens and Burgesses should not be impleaded alibi in aliquibus
transgressionibus, conventionibus and contractibus infra Burgum, etc. quam
infra Burgum. This no doubt was sufficient for the Judges of the Common Law to
dismiss the cause from being proceeded in before them, before whom it was
brought as an Action of Trespass, and not before the Admiral, etc. for that it
rather belonged unto the Major of Hull, then to them, though indeed it perhaps
belonged unto neither; and hereupon the Major de facto might take cognizance,
though by no law or right. I hope we shall not make the Judgment of evaery
Major and Recorder to be a Law, or President that others must be ruled by: For
then we may hang up the accessory, and go seek the principal afterward, as
they did at Grantham in Lincolnshire, as I have heard. But Sir Edward Coke
further says, that the cognizance was granted, etc. I hope he meant not that
it was adjudged to belong absolutely unto the Major and Bailiffs of Hull,
excluding the interest of all other parties: for that had been to have judged
the cause inaudita nec vocata part interesse habente. For the controversy was
then whether the Judges of the Common Law, or the Major, etc. had the
cognizance of that cause; and they having dismissed it from their cognizance,
could grant it no otherwise to the Major and Bailiffs of Hull, but insomuch, or
for that it belonged not unto their cognizance; so that after the dismission
this controversy was no longer between the Judges of the Common Law, and the
Major of Hull* but now the difference concerning the Jurisdiction of, and over
this cause, must rest between the Admiral and the Major and Bailiffs of Hull,
for that the Admiral being no party in fudicio, the cognizance could no
otherwise be granted unto the Major and Bailiffs of Hull, then that they should
have it for ought that Court, in which the Action of Trespass was brought, had
to do therewith, or to hold plea thereof, which could not bar the Admiral of
his claim of Jurisdiction, who was no party in judgment: And then this only
rests as an Authority quoted, that such an Action was brought at the Common
Law; and as it appears, that the same was never there determined; so does it
not appear that ever it was therefore determined by the Major and Bailiffs of
Hull. But the Major and Bailiffs perceiving an Action to be brought at the
Common Law for a trespass done upon their Pors, might very well conceive that
the Action being there brought, the same was rather tryable before them, by
virtue of that clause in their Charter which was urged then by the Judges of
the Common Law; and the Cause being dismissed, as it appears not that the
Major and Bailiffs determined it: no more does it any ways appear, that they
did yet by virtue of this Dismission, or Grant (as Sir Edward Coke terms it)
take upon them so much as the cognizance thereof; or if they did, that the
Admiral ever had notice thereof. But if the Admiral did, or if he did not, yet
if he had taken to his Court the cognizance of this Cause, I am confident that
the Major and Bailiffs could no ways by virtue of that clause, or upon any
other ground have taken it out of his hand, unless they have Admiralty
Jurisdiction granted unto them, as the Town of Ipswich has; the substance of
whose Patent concerning the same, I shall here set down in confirmation of what
I have said before concerning the Admiralty Jurisdiction upon the Cinque Ports
and other Ports.

Test meipso apud Hampton Court tertio die Martii anno regni nostri decimo per
ipsum Regem de dat. praedict. authoritate Parliamenti.
Now I hope it plainly appears hereby that the Admiral has full power and
jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens, if he be not excluded by special grant,
(and that made in the vacancy or interval between one Admirals Patent ceasing,
and another beginning.) And if the Port had been within the Borough of
Ipswich, and things there done had been triable at their Town Court, or at the
Common Law, then had they had no need of this Grant of Admiralty Jurisdiction,
etc. by which Grant of Admiralty Jurisdiction unto them, it does likewise as
plainly appear, that whatsoever is done upon the Port or Haven, is of Admiralty
cognizance, this Admiralty Jurisdiction of theirs extending only unto their
Port and Haven, which reaches only unto the place called Pollishened alias
Poleshead, and no further, which is the point of the high Sea, (as Sir Edward
Coke terms it) so that they have Admiralty Jurisdiction, and yet none upon
the main Sea, but upon the Port and Haven only. But I shall proceed unto the
next thing by Sir Edward Coke insisted upon.

And in the next place it is thus objected, that 7 R = 2. tit. trespass 7 R 2.
tit. trespass in Stath. pl. 54.
in Statham pl. 54. in an Action of Trespass for a Ship and certain
Merchandises taken away (which trespass must of necessity be alleged in some
Town and County in some River or Haven) the Defendant pleaded that he did take
them in le haut mere one les Normans quex sont enemies le Roy, and it is ruled
a good plea, which concurreth with the other books.

Here it is not said that this trespass was laid or alleged to be done in any
Town or County in any River or Haven; but says he, it must of necessity be so.
If he take Town, County, River and Haven disjunctim, then I think that
according to the Law the Action of the Trespass must have been laid to have
been done somewhere, or else the Action would have abated: but if he take them
conjunctim, as that it must of necessity be laid to be done in some River or
Haven, in some Town and County, I confess that according to reason and nature,
a Ship with her lading cannot be elsewhere, except it be upon the high Seas:
But I know that at the Common Law it is usual per fictionem impossibilitatis
(which neither the Civil Law nor Nature do allow) to lay and allege in a
Declaration that such a Ship with her Tackle, Furniture, Ammunition and Lading,
was in the possession of the Plaintiffs in parochia beatae Mariae de Bow in
Warda de Cheap, and thereby him lost, and there per inventionem came to the
hands and possession of the Defendant, etc. and why this Trespass of taking
away this Ship and Merchandises might not as well be laid to be done in some
certain place within some certain Town far enough from the Port or Haven, I
know not: And it is not said, that it was laid to be done upon a Port or Haven.

Wheresoever the trespass was laid to be done, in what Town of what County
soever (for in some Town of some County, or in some part of some County it must
be laid to be done) yet amongst all the Instances Sir Edward Coke has brought,
and amongst all that I could ever yet hear of, I never knew or heard of any
original action brought at the Common Law which was said for a thing done upon
any of the Ports or Havens, except that of Hull business, which never came to
be adjudged between the Admiral and the Mayor, etc. of Hull, etc. or whether
the action was rightly instituted or not. The defendant pleaded as above, and
it was adjudged for a good plea. I would gladly know what could be argued from
hence, if the truth had been otherwise, and he had pleaded he took the Ship and
Goods infra fluxum and refluxum maris, or that he took them in tali Portu one
les Spaniards quex sont les enemies le Roy, must necessarily this plea have
been adjudged naught, because the other was adjudged good? I see not the
consequence how this conclusion depends upon the premises, if deduced into a
Syllogism.

It is objected likewise that 7. Hen. 6. 32. 7. H. 6. 32.
an action lies at the Common Law for fore-stalling, etc. in a Port or Haven,
etc. and by consequence the Admiral has no Jurisdiction there.

Here I do observe that about the 6 and 7 year of Hen. 6. the then Lord chief
Justice of the Common Pleas did much endeavor suam ampliare jurisdictionem;
for about the same time the first judgment upon the Statute of the 2 of Hen.
4. for double damages was given for the pretended breach of the two former
Statutes of the 13 and 15th. of Rich. 2. and this 2 of Hen. 4. by suing in the
Admiralty for a thing not done super altum mare, contrary to those 3 Statutes,
whereas none of those 3 Statutes have one word in them that tends to the
binding up the Admiral to the high Seas, unless any man can make sur le mere
super altum mare; nor is there any word in them that tends to the making of
the Ports and Havens to be infra corpus commitatus; Super c. 7. hujus 2. lib.
as I have showed before. By this Judgment double damages were recovered
against him that had received a loss of 960 marks, odd moneys; and the damages
were assessed by the Jury to 700 l. which by the Judgment being doubled,
amounts unto 1400 l. so that instead of recovering of 900 marks without any
trial, whether due to him or not, he is condemned in 1400 l. how the then
Plaintiff (as the Record is cited) having got the possession of the goods sued
for by the Defendant, formerly the Plaintiff, or pars agens in the Admiralty,
could sustain 700 l. damage by being sued in the Admiralty, I know not, nor can
imagine: For the Statute does not say, the party sued in the Admiralty Court
contrary to the Statute of the 13th of Richard the Second, shall recover double
the value of what he there sued for, but double the damage he sustained by such
suit, which could be no great matter, unless he had recovered and obtained into
his possession the sum sued for, which does not appear, nor is it so much as
alleged or affirmed.

Now it could not be expected that so much sea being converted into land by
this Judgment by two years labor, and but finished and brought to pass in the
6th year of Henry the Sixth, the same land should be in the very next year,
viz. in the 7th year of the same Kings Reign reconverted into sea.

Yet is there a great deal more color for an Action to lie at the Common Law
for forestalling in a Port or Haven, then for the beforementioned Judgment:
but upon another ground then that which Sir Edward Coke would have to be the
ground (namely because a Port or Haven is within the body of a County) which is
this. Though the forestalling be an act done upon the Port or Haven, yet is it
the forestalling of a Market, which is kept at land; so that act done upon the
Port or Haven has relation unto the Market which is at land. And so the act
done upon the Port or Haven may be said to arise from the Market which is at
land, and within the body of a County, and that act upon the Port to be a
forestalling of that Market which is at land: Just as a Contract made at land
for transporting goods by sea, is an act done upon the land, but has relation
to a thing done at sea; and so the Contract though made at land, is a thing
that does arise from a thing done or to be done at sea, and does not arise from
a thing either done or to be done at land within the body of any County: And
therefore is this Contract tryable in the Admiralty, and not at the Common Law*
And this agrees with the Statute of the fifteenth of Richard the Second Stat.
15. R. 2. c. 3.
, the Statute being truly examined, which I shall plainly show when I come to
speak of Contract. Yet may not this construction of the forestalling upon the
water be allowed: for this is no Contract made for the performance of any act
or thing at land positive, and therefore arises not from any act or thing to
be done at land, but is a Contract which does privatively debar a further act
to be done at land: And besides this is a complete act, having reference to
nothing more yet to be done; but the bargain is made, the comomodity bought,
and all is done; therefore is this forestalling triable in the Admiralty Court,
and there punishable, as will hereafter appear by what I shall show Infra cap.
in several chapters of this second book.

In the next place it is objected, that the 19 H. 6. 7. 19. H. 6. 7.
it is said that the Statute does restrain that the Admiral shall not hold plea
of any thing rising within any of the Counties of this Nation, but Executions
he may make upon the land; this Statute which this Authority cites, must be
the same before mentioned Statute of 15 Ric. 2. 15 R. 2. c. 3.
therefore I will say nothing to this here, more then that Sir Edward Coke does
hence infer, that though it be said in the 22 ass pl. 93. 22 ass. pl. 93.
that every water which flows and reflows is an arm of the Sea; yet it
follows not (says he) that the Admiral shall have Jurisdiction there, unless
it be out of every County, or else such a place whereof the Country cannot take
knowledge, as it appears in the book of Lib. E. 2. praecitat.
E. 2. before cited.

But how this has any reference to that of the Statute, to serve for his
purpose, I know not. The last thing against that which is said 22. ass. pl. 93.
22. ass. pl, 93.
he would prove by that of 8 Ed. 2. 8 Ed. 2. praecitat.
before cited, which I have answered already.

It is argued out of Fortescue, cap. 32. fol. 38. Fortesc. ca. 32. f. 38.
that the Admirals Jurisdiction is confined to the high Sea, for that he there
says; Nam si quae super altum mare extra corpus cujuslibet comitatus regni
illius fiant, quae postmodum in prohibito coram Admirallo Angliae deducantur
per testes, illa juxta legum Angliae sanctiones terminari debent: which (says
Sir Edward Coke) proves by express words, that the Jurisdiction of the Admiral
is confined to the high Sea, which is not within any County of the Realm.

If Fortescue had said much more then here he does to have afforded him a
better foundation for his Argument, then this which he has said, does; I
should not have much marvelled at it: For he that conceived that if Adam had
not sinned in Paradise, all the World had been governed by the Common Law,
perhaps might in his time think it meritorious to reduce as much of the World
as he could to the subjection of that Law: But truly out of what he says here,
Sir Edward Cokes conclusion is not Logically to be deduced: For to say that
because Fortescue says that the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the high Sea,
which is out of any County of the Kingdom, that he has no Jurisdiction
elsewhere, is no better an Argument, then to say that Sir Edward Coke was Lord
of the Manor of N. and therefore he could have no Land elsewhere: For Fortescue
does not speak this exclusive to any other part of the Admirals Jurisdiction;
Nor by saying Quae super altum mare extra corpus cujuslibet comitatus regni
illius fiant, does he aver, quod aliquis portus maris est infra corpus
alicujus Comitatus. If this Answer does not satisfy, add the Answer to the
next Objection to it.

The next Objection is deduced out of the 2 Rich. 2. fol. 12. 2 R. 2. g. 12.
quod Hibernici sunt sub Admirallo Angliae de re facta super altum mare, Which
(says he) agrees with the former, viz. that the Jurisdiction of the Admiral
is super altum mare.

And no doubt but it is: but it does not therefore follow that it is nowhere
else; Now this very authority shows, the true use and ground of this
distinction of super altum mare, and super portum maris, which is this: The
Admiral of England has Jurisdiction super altum mare quo ad Hibernicos, and
Hibernici sunt sub Admirallo Angliae de re sacta super altum mare and non super
portum Hibernicum nisi per appellationem. And so it is between England and
other Nations, adjoining to the British Seas: For the Kings of England have ab
antiquo had the dominion of those Seas as is sufficiently demonstrated and
proved by that learned Gentleman Mr. Seldom Seld. Mare clausum, de dominio
maris per totum.
by exceeding many Arguments throughout his whole Book de Dominio maris, called
Mare clausum which I have touched upon before: but though the King of England
had the dominion of those Seas, yet had those Nations Admirals, who had the
Jurisdiction of, and over all business done in and upon their own Ports, so
that the Admiral of Englands Jurisdiction Respectu Regis Angliae Dominii maris
is said to be super altum mare quo ad alias omnes nationes. But as had his
Power from the King, so has he Power, Authority and Jurisdiction, as over the
Sea, so over the Ports and Havens of the Sea, belonging to this Nation, as well
as the Admirals of France and the Admirals of other Nations had, and have over
the Ports and Havens belonging to their several Nations, which undoubtedly they
had and have, as has been showed before. Super l. 1. cap. 2.
And upon Letters of reprizal no man by virtue thereof takes or seiseth any
Ship or Goods within any foreign Port, or any Port or Chambers of a foreign
Prince, other then the Ports and Chambers of that Prince, against whose
Subjects the same were granted. And in such cases as these which have relation
to the Subjects of foreign Princes or States it is necessary to deduce, that
such a fact was done super alto mari, and hoc est quoad Portus suos: but in
other cases for Maritime businesses done either upon the Port or contracted for
upon the land, it is sufficient in the first to lay in the libel that they were
done infra fluxum and refluxum maris, and in the last infra jurisdictionem
Admirallitatis, as has been already said, and shall hereafter be more fully
showed.

For that which follows in the next place out of Stamford, I joined it with
that of the 8 Ed. 2. and have already spoken thereto. Super hoc capite.


Next it is said 4 and 5 Ph. and Mar. Dyer 159. 6. 4 and 5. Ph. and ma Diet
159. 6.
by the libel in the Admiralty, the cause is supposed to commence sur le haut
mere, and infra Jurisdictionem del Admiralty ubi revera facta fuit in tali loco
infra corpus Comitatus, and non super altum mare; whereby (says Sir Edward
Coke) it also appears that the Lord Admirals Power is confined to the
high-sea.

This Conclusion can no ways be deduced out of the premises, for though, by
the libel in the Admiralty Court the cause was supposed to commence sur le haut
mere, and infra Jurisdictionem de l'Admiralty, and perhaps falsely so suggested,
because the thing was done in some Town within the body of a County: for the
instance is, ubi revera facta fuit in tali loco infra corpus Comitatus; which
locus may be any inland Town within any County, and non super altum mare, as
it deduced in the libel: For it does not say ubi revera facta fuit super tali
Portu infra corpus Comitatus: If by the Libel the cause had been supposed to
have commenced in, vel, super tali Portu infra fluxum and refluxum maris, then
the words of the Authority might have run thus, ubi revera facta fuit in tali
loco infra corpus Comitatus, and non super talem portum, vel infra fluxum and
refluxum maris, as well as non super altum mare; for the words, and non super
altum mare, are only in affirmance of the contrary to what is laid in the
Libel, and no ways confining the Admirals Jurisdiction to the particular place
laid in the Libel, specifying and designing that very place where such a
particular act was not done, if so be in the Libel it had been laid, that this
act had been done about the midway between Dover and Callis; and the Authority
had said, ubi revera facta fuit in tali loco infra corpus comitatus, and not in
or about the midway between Dover and Callis, I hope no man will say, that by
this authority the Admirals Jurisdiction had been confined to that part of the
seas that is about the midway between Dover and Callis; so that it is plain
this conclusion cannot be drawn out of the authority.

The rest of the Authorities which follow concern Contracts made at land of
things to be done and performed at sea, and of things done or contracted beyond
the seas, which Inf. a lib. 3. c. 2, 3, 4, etc.
I shall defer to their proper places.

There be two things more urged to prove the Admirals Jurisdiction to be
confined to the high Seas, and not to be upon the Ports and Havens, which are
not cited amongst his Book-cases and Authorities of Books, but are cited before
them; one amongst the Praemunire's by him cited, which I have spoken to already
Sup. lib. 2. c. 7.
, and the other cited amongst the Prohibitions by him cited, which concern
Contracts, and are referred to their proper Inf. l. 3. c. 2, 3, 4, etc.
places.

These two I shall here insert before I proceed to the next chapter.

The first of them is urged out of the book of Entries, fol. 23. tit. Book of
Entries, fol. 23. tit. Admiralty.
Admiralty, where it appears (says he) that the taking of a Ship called the
Trinity of London, lying upon the River of E. in the County of Kent, is not
super altum mare, but infra corpus comitatus Cantiae, and therefore a Suit for
the taking of that Ship lying there, in the Admiralty Court before John Earl of
Huntingdon, Admiral of England, appears to be against the said Statutes, and
yet no question that was infra fluxum and refluxum maris, and infra primos
pontes.

Here he says, that the taking of that Ship in that place appears to be
against the said Statutes, but mentions not what Statutes, having quoted
diverse before. If there had been a Judgment in the case, he certainly would
have added this proof to the Judgment of Burton and Putts Case, and have
averred it to have been against those Statutes of the 13 and 15 of Ric. 2. and
Hen. 4. but here it is inserted amongst the Praemunires by him cited, and the
Statutes next before mentioned, are, the Statute of 32 Hen. 8. c. 14. and the
Statute of Ric. 2. concerning Praemunire's, which must be the Statutes, against
which this taking must be said to appear to be; by reason he says it appears
to be against the said Statutes, which must be meant of the next mentioned
preceding Statutes; If then, it appears there to be against the Statute of
praemunire, I hope it has already Super l. 2. c. 7.
received an answer: If against that of the 32 of Hen. 8. c. 14. it cannot be
so, as shall be showed when we come to treat of freight and I^s. l 3. c. 2, 3,
4, etc.
contracts, where we shall have occasion to mention that Statute against his
tenants.

The other thing by him urged does next precede the prohibitions by him quoted
ex Rot. 140. Mich. 16. Hen. 8. Rot. 140. Mich. 16 H. 8.
The River of Thames at Billinsgate (says he) is not within the Jurisdiction
of the Admiralty, but infra corpus comitatus.

This follows next after the premunires, and precedeth next before the
prohibitions by him quoted, that the River of Thames at Billingsgate is not
within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty: by this Record it must appear thereby
not so to be, either by a praemunire brought, or by a prohibition granted, (as I
conceive) being inserted in that place, and must have some relation either to
what precedeth, or what follows.

If the River of Thames at Billingsgate by this Record appear to be infra
corpus comitatus by a praemunire brought, I can say no more to it then I have
already Sup. l. 2. c. ^.
said. If by a prohibition granted only, it proves nothing; for many a
prohibition has been granted, and consultations have been awarded, without
denial of the suggestions. And oftentimes prohibitions have been granted upon
such suggestions as could not be maintained, but deserved consultations upon
the debate thereof; and sometimes the parties have come to an agreement after
prohibition granted, when consultations would have been awarded if they had
been sued for, which are said to be Judgments in such Cases: but a prohibition
is no proof until a dispute had upon the validity, and a determination
thereupon, no more then the bringing of an action at the Common Law, and giving
a Declaration without any further proceedings, is a proof that what is by
Declaration claimed, is due, or that the action was duly and legally
instituted and brought.

CHAP. IX.
That the Rhodian and other Maritime Laws were ordained as well for the
decision of the differnces happening upon the Ports and Havens, as upon the
high Seas.
ALl these Proofs and Authorities which I have handled in the four last, and
next preceding Chapters being collected and gathered into one heap, as by Sir
Edward Coke they are, and taken by themselves, do make a specious show, and a
fair color for the turning the Lord high Admiral of England out of his
Jurisdiction, upon the Ports, Creeks, and Havens of the Sea, but no more then a
show or color as appears to my view.

For the ancient, constant, and continued Practice of the Admiralty Court, and
all the Proofs, Presidents, and Authorities, which make to the contrary of what
is by him set forth, being with them well weighed and considered, all that he
has showed in this particular, will serve only to prove what interruptions
have been put, and inrodes made upon the Admiralty Court,: For certainly the
Proceedings, Acts, and Judgments given in the Admiralty Court concerning
businesses agitated and done upon the Ports and Havens will, as presidents for
the Admirals Jurisdiction there, amount unto a great number for those few he
has quoted against it.

The Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and the Jurisdiction of the Common Law,
having always been two distinct Jurisdictions, having no dependancie each upon
the other, but both exercised under the Kings of England, (...) super l. 2. c.
1.
I know not why the ancient Practice and Presidents of the Admiralty Court
should not be as convincing in the proof of this particular, which rests in
controversy between them, as the practice and presidents of the other: But it
is like enough some will be ready to aver that the Admiralty Court, is not a
Court of Record, and therefore presidents of that Court are not of so great
credit as the Presidents of the Courts of Common Law, but it will be very unfit
for me to enter into that dispute, when as it is upon the matter put to the
question, whether it be so much as a Court at all, or not: For if it shall have
the cognizance of scarce any cause at all (as it cannot have, if all be true
that Sir Edward Coke would prove, as I shall show hereafter, when I come to
sum up all together) then does it not deserve so much as the name of a Court.

This only I shall say by the way, that when it was a Court, or if it be a
Court, it has been, and is as much a Court of Record as all Courts in foreign
Nations beyond the seas have been, and are; and whatsoever has in that Court
been, or is done, being legally transmitted and certified, would have carried,
and does carry along with it as good credit in all parts of Christendom as any
Record whatsoever, certified out of any of the Courts at Westminster, and so
will and does at this present for any thing therein transacted. But if I should
enter upon the presidents in Civil causes, which are to be brought out of the
Registry of the Admiralty for the cognizance of causes done upon the Ports and
Havens, I should make my self an endless piece of work; and when I have done
those things, perhaps may for all that has been said, be thought by many not
to be authentic: I shall therefore pass them over, and come to those things
which are as authentic, in my poor judgment, for proof of the Admirals
Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens, as any thing that has been brought
against it. And I shall begin first with the Rhodian and ancient Maritime Laws,
made, ordained, and appointed for the decision of Maritime causes arising and
happening as well upon the Ports and Havens, as upon the high Seas, and then
proceed to other proofs.

By the Laws of the Rhodes and other sea Laws inserted into the body of the
Civil Law, which give directions how to steer the Judicature of so many causes,
which may happen and fall out upon Ports and Havens, it manifestly appears
that things there done, and controversies thence arising, are properly
cognizable by the Admiral, no other Law having the like grounds, or affording
the like rules for the decision of such differences, or giving such directions
for the avoiding of strife in businesses of that nature: To introduce them all
here, would make a Volumne, which I Intend not, and it would be too tedious a
labor to effect that which so few regard, namely to set forth the most
exquisite excellency of the Civil Law founded upon the very strength of reason
it self. But why should I so highly commend that which is so much scorned,
either to be understood, or so much as looked after, and by some condemned
before it be looked into, or at all understood what it is? Sergeant Callis
Sergeant Callis Lect. 1. p. 31.
condemns the Imperial Law, which (says he) the Civilians use; for that the
Sea-shoar is therein held to be Common to all, and says that the Common Law of
England does in reason surpass either the Imperial Law or the Civil Law; which
distinction shows the understanding he had in those two Laws, which the world
hitherto made but one. And Sir Ed. Coke condemns the Civil Law for proceeding
by paper proofs (as he calls them) slighting them as if those proofs that
were taken without a public Notary without the repetition of the Witnesses
before a Judge, or without the liberty of administering Interrogatories by the
adverse party at the same time, and only expressed by word of mouth, and neither
set down in Paper or Parchment, but passes away with every air, were better
taken, and remained more perfect on record, then those Paper proofs which are
in such manner taken, and with as much care preserved. But surely in most
controversies which do arise from a thing done upon the Ports and Havens, it is
most necessary, that the proof for the decision thereof, be taken by such Paper
proofs; sometimes in regard of the speedy return of the Witnesses into the
parts beyond the seas, who cannot stay such an examination (without their
undoing) as to be present to afford their testimony viva voce at the time of
the trial: sometimes in regard necessary and requisite Witnesses are hence
departed, before the Suit be instituted, and resided beyond the seas, where
their testimony must necessarily be taken by Commission, which by the manner of
proof made at the Common Law, cannot be done; so that most differences which do
arise from things done upon the Ports and Havens, must be proceeded in
according to the rules of the Civil Law, and have their determination from the
same, or else be decided without testimony, which is to judge blindfold, or
else to rest unadjudged, and the wronged and injured party to be left
remediless and unrelieved. But it will be answered, that in such cases they may
have a Commission out of the Chancery for that purpose: To which I must reply
that the Controversy is whether the cognizance and trial of causes arising
from things done upon the Ports and Havens does belong to the Common Law, or to
the Civil and Maritime Law. And then surely it must more properly belong unto
that Law and that Court, which can of it self without the assistance of any
other Court, make a complete proceeding and trial, and give a direct judgment
according to express rules of Justice in such causes, then to that Court, which
without the assistance of another Court can do neither. Neither can the Common
Law Courts in very many such causes of it self proceed for want of such
Commissions; neither has it in as many causes any express rules to direct the
Judicature thereof. I shall here set down some few of those Laws, which the
Civil and Maritime Laws give in such Cases, so far forth only as to show,
that the Maritime Laws were ordained as well for the Ports and Havens, as for
the main Seas.

First then for the lading of a Ship, which is always or commonly in a Port or
Haven, the Civil and Maritime Law directs who of the Ship shall be chargeable
with such Lading, as shall be put aboard the said Ship, and who shall not; sunt
quidam in navibus, qui custodiae gratia navibus praeponuntur ut (...), and
diaetarii: Si quis igitur ex his receperit puto in exercitorem dandam actionem;
quia is qui eos hujusmodi officio praeponit, committi eis permittit; quanquam
ipse navicularius vel magister id faciat quod (...) appellant: Sed and si hoc
non extet, tamen de recepto navicularius tenebitur F. (...) caup. stab. l. 1.
sect. 3.
non debet per remigem, aut mesonautam obligari, sed per se, vel Ead. l. sect.
2.
navis magistrum.

This Law does not only show who is chargeable with the Wares and Merchandises
laden aboard of the Ship, but likewise what things they are chargeable for, and
says, Quod cujusque salvum fore Eod. and ead. l. sect. 6.
receperint, hoc est, quamcunque rem sive mercem receperint; and least it might
be thought that it is only meant of Wares and Merchandises, and nothing else,
it explaineth it self yet further, and says ad eas quoque res hoc edictum
pertinere quae mercibus accederent, veluti vestimenta quibus in nayibus
uterentur, and cetera quae ad quotidianum Eodem.
usum habemus; and parvi refer res nostras an alienas intulimus, si tamen
nostra intersit salvas esse. Ead. leg. sect. 7.
And as soon as such Merchandises and other Commodities are put aboard the Ship,
whether she be upon Port, Haven, or any other part of the Seas, he that is
exercitor navis, is chargeable therewith; and if the same be there lost or
purloined, or sustain any damage, hurt, or loss, whether in the Haven before,
or upon the Seas after the Ship be set forward on her voyage, whether it be
done by the Mariners or any other through their permission or negligence, he
that is exercitor navis is to make good the same.

For says the Law, recepit salvum fore, utrum si in navim res missae ei
assignatae sint, an etsi non sint assignatae, hoc tamen ipso quod in navim
missae sint receptae videntur, and omnium recepit custodiam quae in navini
illatae sunt: Et factum non solum nautarum praestare debet, sed and Ead. leg.
sect. recepit.
vectorum.

And in these cases two several Maritime Actions do lie, whereof the Agent has
his choice. Dicendum duas proponi actiones exercitorias: una est de recepto in
simplum, quae dicitur in factum; altera est actio in factum e delicto nautarum
ex quasi delicto exercitoris qui videtur delinquere quod improbis nautis
utatur. Et haec est in duplum, sed in eam non venit Glos^. super eod. sect.
verb. and factum.
factum vectorum.

So that the very lading of goods aboard the Ship, charge him that is
exercitor navis therewith (which the Common Law does not;) for he is liable for
whatsoever his Mariners shall do aboard the Ship, be she in Port, Haven, or
upon the high Seas; but he is not liable for what they shall do, being at land,
and not aboard the Ship: so that the Ship makes distinction of Actions, but
makes no distinction at all between her being upon the high Seas, or upon Port
or Haven; Debet Exercitor omnium nautarum suorum sive liberi sint, sive servi,
factum praestare; nec immerito factum eorum praestat, cum ipse eos suo periculo
adhibuerit; sed non T. eod. leg. debet Exercitor
alias praestat, quam in ipsa nave damnum datum sit, caeterum si extra navim
licet a nautis non praestabit.

But if the Exercitor shall receive goods on the shore in nave custodienda sive
transportanda, and shall lose them, or suffer them to be stolen from him before
they shall be laden aboard the said Ship, he shall be liable to make
satisfaction. Idem Eod. leg. and ita.
ait etiam si nondum sint res in navim receptae, sed in littore perierint, quas
semel recepit, periculum ad eum pertinere.

If therefore he be liable for such goods as he shall receive upon the shore to
be put aboard his Ship, and transported, in case they there perish, or be
otherwise damnified; much more shall he be answerable for such goods and
merchandises as he shall receive, or shall be laden aboard his Ship, if the
same perish or be damnified in or upon the Port or Haven.

Those Laws of the Rhodes which we find inserted into the body of the Civil
Law, which are the ancientest Sea-laws extant, do treat of the casting
overboard of goods in a storm or tempest for preservation of the Ship, and the
remainder of goods, and of the Avaridge payable out of the same, whether the
Ship be in such stress of weather upon the Ports or Havens, or upon the high
Seas; and the rules there set down do serve as well for the one place as the
other.

These Laws and Rules being general, and not restrained to the high Seas, do
sufficiently prove that they were constituted and ordained for all places where
a Ship might fall into such danger, that by this Jactus mercium the Ship and
remainder of the Goods and Merchandises might be preserved. And such danger
does not always fall out upon the high Seas, but oftentimes upon the Ports and
Havens.

But least this shall be thought not sufficient, but that notwithstanding the
generality of the Sea Laws, which have provided directions sufficient for what
is to be done in such cases, yet they were to be made use of only when such
accidents happened, and fell out upon the high Seas; and that they were
constituted and ordained only for such causes falling out upon the high Seas,
and not upon the Ports and Havens, but left such causes there falling out unto
the cognizance of the Common Law here in England, and other municipal Laws in
other Nations. I shall here set down one express Law, inserted amongst the rest
of (...) Sea Laws, which shows that all these Laws were as well appointed for
such causes happenning upon the Ports and Havens, as they were ordained for
those that fell out on the high Seas, which Law makes further provision in a
cause of the like nature, happenning either upon the high Sea or Port in
express words, and shows plainly too, that all the rest were constituted and
appointed for both; which runs thus: Navis onustae levandae causa (quia intrare
flumen vel portum non potuerit cun^^onere) si quaedam merces in scapham
trajectae sunt, ne aut extra flumen periclitetur aut ipso ostio vel portu,
eaque scapha submersa est; ratio haberi debet inter eos, qui in nave merces
salvas habent, cum his qui in scapha perdiderunt perinde tanquam si jactura
facta esset F. de leg. Rhod l. Navis onustae.


Here it is manifest by this Law, that if for the lightening of a laden Ship,
because she cannot enter into the River or Port with her burden, some of the
Goods shall be put into the Ships boat, least the Ship should be endangered
either without the River, or in the door of the Sea or Port it self, and that
Boat shall be drowned, a consideration is to be had between those which have
their Goods saved in the Ship, and those that have lost their Goods in the Boat
as if there had been a jacture made; so that here we see the same rule holds
for the preservation of a Ship, as well within the Port or Haven, or the mouth
or door thereof, as for her preservation upon the high Seas.

It may be further observed out of this Law, that ostium maris and portus maris
be both one and the same thing: for as ostium is a door-gate or entrance, so is
portus a Port or Portal, beginning or entrance of the Sea, or into the Sea; and
that ostium maris is not an imaginary thing between the Sea and the Port or
Haven, as Sir Edward Coke would have it to be; for as by saying a Port or
Haven, we mean but one and the same thing, intimating that you may take which
term you will, as this Law does in the beginning by the words flumen vel
portus, mean one and the same thing, when it says quia intrare flumen vel
portum non potuerit, etc. so does it in the next place by ostium or portus mean
one and the same thing likewise, when it says ne periclitetur aut extra
flumen, aut in ipso ostio, vel portu, the ( aut) making the disjunctive, and
not the ( vel) And indeed the whole Port withal its banks is door slender
enough for the keeping of the raging waves and wallowing billows of the Sea
from overflowing the Land. And the banks may properly enough (though they be
termed the Sea banks) be said to be the doors of the land, to keep the Sea out
of it; yet must the Haven or Port, wherein the water flows and and refloweth,
necessarily be said and concluded to be the door, portal or entrance, whereat
all Ships and Vessels whatsoever must necessarily enter into the main Sea; and
this door of the Sea is as much a part of the Sea, as a door of an house is a
part of that house, where it is the door, and does more properly belong to the
Sea then to the land, whereof it is no part, but different and is distinct both
in name and nature, being two several Elements; and the causes arising from
things done either upon the high Seas or upon the Ports, being of one and the
same nature, all belonging to Shipping, Navigation, Trading and Commerce, etc.
they are all more properly cognoscible and tryable by one and the same Law,
then by two, namely by the Civil and Maritime Laws, then by the Civil Law and
the Law of the land too. For nulli prorsus audientia praebeatur, qui causae
continentiam dividet, and ex beneficii praerogativa id quod in uno eodem que
judicio poterat terminari apud diversos judices voluerit ventilare, poena ex
officio judicis eminente ei qui contra hanc supplicaverit sanctionem. Cod. de
judi. l. nulli.


And the Rules of the Civil and Maritime Laws in Cases of this nature are very
many, and very observable for the directions of the Judicature therein, setting
forth what is to be done according to the variation of the Case, as the Law
navis onustae before mentioned sets forth what is to be done, in case diverse
Goods and Merchandises be taken out of the Ship and put into the Boat, and the
Boat perish; so contrary, if the Ship and remainder of Goods and Merchandises
remaining in her perish, either upon the Sea, or in the Port, and the Boat
arrive in safety with the Goods and Merchandises put into her, ^. ad legem.
(...). l. navis.
the same is to be done.

It is not enough to know a general Rule, without its exceptions and
limitations; nor is it enough to know that si levandae navis gratia jactus
mercium factas est, omnium contributione sarciatur, Eod. l. lege.
that an avaridge must be had upon all the Goods that are saved, toward
satisfaction of the owners of those Goods that were cast into the Sea; but it
is necessary to know (in case the Avaridge be not agreed of) what action those
whose goods were cast into the sea, have against the Master of the Ship for
those goods, and what action the Master has against those whose goods were
saved, Ead. si laborante and closs. and sect. cum in ead. and ibi gloss. and l.
am^ssae and l. cum depressa.
and what the duty of the Master is in these cases.

It is likewise necessary to be known, and the Civil and Maritime Laws do set
forth, whether the Ship be liable, and ought to be cast into the Avaridge or
not; and whether if the Ship be worn and become worse by the tempests and
storms, she shall be considered therefore out of the L. ead. si conservatis.
Avaridge of the goods saved?

And likewise these Laws set forth what is to be done in case there be goods
and merchandises of several sorts, and many passengers, bondmen and free; and
whether goods of all sorts ought to be cast over, and what is to be done in
case there be goods aboard which do not burden the Ship, as Jewels, precious
Stones, and Rings; and at what proportion or rate they are to be cast into the
Avaridge; whether Apparel, or the Passengers and Merchants wearing Rings;
whether the Passengers themselves, and their, or the Ships victuals shall be
cast into the Avaridge, the contribution shall be made according to weight, or
according to the value, Ead ^cum (...) and ibi gloss.
an prout ponderant, an prout valent.

It is considered by the same Laws likewise, if a Ship be taken by a Pirat,
whether upon the Sea, or upon a Port or Haven, and be redeemed, whether all
must contribute or not; and if any thing be taken away by Thieves or Robbers,
whether he must lose it that did own it; and if any one redeem what is so taken
away, whether Ead. (...) navis.
Contribution ought to be made for the redemption.

And it is considered how and in what manner this Avaridge is to be made,
whether the goods lost are to be valued by themselves, and the goods saved by
themselves, or whether altogether, and whether goods lost are to be valued
according to the price they were bought for, or according to the price they
might have been sold at, and at whether of those two Ead. ^. portio.
prices the goods saved are to be valued?

It is likewise considered, whether if a Servant or Slave in the casting over
board of the goods does happen to be drowned, whether any estimation be to be
made of him; and if any of the Passengers be not solvendo, whether the payment
of his share belongth to the Master or not? Whether if the goods cast over
board be again recovered, contribution ought to be made? If contribution have
been made, whether it be to be restored, and in what way the Master ought to
proceed against him that has so received it? and in what way the Contributers
ought to proceed against the Master. And whether goods so cast over board are
to be accounted pro derelicto, and so become theirs who shall afterward
possess them, or not be so accounted, but remain still the owners? Vtrum Ead.
sect. severum sect. signis sect. si res and sex. res autem and l. qui levandae.
res Domini manent, an fuerint occupantis?

It is likewise considered by these Laws, whether if the Master to avoid
danger, shall cut off, or throw over board any of his Masts or other
Instruments belonging to his Ship, for preservation of his Ship and her lading,
contribution in this case be due? Whether the consent of the Passengers and
Merchants in the Ship be requisite, or not? And whether it must be done L. cum
arbor, and l. amissa sect. arbore.
justi metus causa, and who is to judge thereof?

In like manner it is considered, if the goods cast over board be afterward
regained and saved by such as for pay or reward shall adventure and take pains
to effect the same, si per urinatores recuperatae sint and extractae, and the
Ship with the remainder of her lading shall afterward be cast away, whether
the goods so regained shall contribute to the other afterward cast away? And
if some of those goods cast away with the Ship shall in like manner be
recovered, whether they shall contribute unto him that made the first Tit. eod.
l. Navis, sect. sed (...).
jacture.

After a jacture or casting over board, if some of the goods that be saved be
deteriorated, damnified or made worse; by these Laws it is considered, whether
they were so hurt by the ill stowage, or by the dashing of the water at the
time of the jacture, or by the uncovering of them? It is considered likewise,
whether the damage be more then the contribution will come to, or the
contribution will come to more then the damage is? And then it is determined
whether the damnified goods shall contribute or not, and if they shall, L. ead.
sect. cum autem and gloss.
in what manner?

If a Ship be split, or any otherwise cast away, whether upon the Seas, or
upon a Port, and the goods some or all be preserved, and saved, it is
determined, whether the goods shall contribute to the loss of the E. ead. l.
amissa.
Ship, or not?

If the Masts of the Ship, whether upon the Sea, or upon the Port be shivered
into pieces, and the sails and other tacle be consumed with lightening, and the
goods by what means soever preserved, though by obtaining new Masts, new Sails,
and new Tacle, etc. these Laws determine whither the owners of the goods be to
make Eod. navis adveasa and gloss. and l. cum. depressa.
contribution or not?

Hereby it is plain that the special Cases, which are comprehended under one
general Law or Head, are very many and various, and require various decisions
or judgments, which are upon express reasons by the Civil and Maritime Laws
and Commentators upon them most exquisitely set forth, as he that shall look
thereinto shall find.

If one Ship shall fall foul upon another, either upon the high Seas, or upon
any Port or Haven, so that either or both of them have sustained hurt or
damage, the same Laws do most exquisitely determine between them. And under
this head do likewise fall very many various cases, variously by those Laws
determined according and agreeable to most excellent reason F. ad legem
Aquiliam l. quem admodum. Sect. 2, 3, 4, and 5.
.

If the Mariners shall do damage to the Merchants Goods, ^s by drawing out and
drinking up their Wines, etc. whether they do it upon the Seas, or when the
Ship lies at Anchor upon any Port or Haven, the case is the same; and the
Civil and Maritime Laws determine what is to be done herein: Many general heads
more containing under them several various particulars might be instanced in,
but these are sufficient to show that the Rhodian and Maritime Laws were
ordained as well for the determination of differences happening upon the Ports
and Havens, as upon the high Seas, and have express Laws for the guiding of the
judgment therein: which all Nations do acknowledge and allow, wherein the
Common Law of England under correction, is deficient.

CHAP. X.
The Laws of Oleron, and other ancient Laws of the Sea, were constituted and
ordained, as well for the decision of controversies, happening and arising from
things done upon the Ports and Havens, as from things done upon the high Seas.
BY a Record which I have before set down at large; Li. 1. c. 4.
it appears that the Laws now called the Laws of Oleron were ancient Laws,
and anciently practiced for the regulating of Maritime and Sea) affairs in that
Maritime Island, and that those Laws were by Richard the First, King of England
in his return from the Holy Land corrected and interpreted; and in that Island
published in the French Tongue for that purpose, and called la ley Oleron; in
that this Record says, they were by him Correcta and interpretata, it plainly
appears that they were made before: but whether then used in England or in
that Island only, may seem doubtful: however it appears by the Record it
self, that after such correction and interpretation, they were likewise
published in England, and were ordinata in Edward the First's time, and
consummated in the 12 year of Edward 3.

Now these Laws being thus established, do plainly show, that the Admiral had
and ought to have Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens, as well as upon the
high Seas, for that they do set forth what is to be determined in controversies
arising, as well from things done upon the one as the other; I shall instance
in some of them.

If a Ship perish in any place whatsoever, whether upon Port, or the main Sea,
the Laws of Oleron give direction what the Mariners ought to do for the saving
of the Goods, and how far the Master may recompense them for their pains, in
case they save any of the Goods, and in what manner; whether he may sell or
pawn such Goods as are saved, for, or toward their satisfaction; and whether
he may sell or pawn any of the Tackle of the said Ship (if saved) without
authority from the rest of the owners La ley Oler.


They give directions when a Ship arriveth in any Port or Haven, laden or not
laden, when the Mariners may go out of her with leave of the Master, when
without, and with how many Cables she ought to be anchored, before they may go
out without leave, and what care they ought to take, when they do so to free
themselves from making satisfaction for such damage and loss, as the Ship or
Goods shall sustain in their absence La ley Oler. Jud. 5.


They likewise determine in what case the Master shall pay for the healing of a
maim, or hurt of a Mariner, and in what cases he shall not, Ol. Jud. 6.
be that done either in the Ship at Sea, or in the Port, or at land.

They set forth likewise what the Master ought to do, in case any of his
company fall sick, what care he is to take of him, and what provision he is to
make for him at land, and what allowance he is to afford him; Ol. Jud. 7.
all which denied, or if any part thereof withheld, the same is recoverable by
these Laws before the Admiral.

These Laws do likewise set forth other duties of the Master and Mariners, when
they come into a Port or Haven, where they are to make their right discharge,
as by this judgment appears.

Il avient qun Ol. Jud 9. in quibusque l. jud. 10.
maistre d'une nef vient a sauvete a sa discharge il doit monster en aux
Merchants lescords avec quoy il quindera, and sil voit amender, le Maistre est
tenu a lamender lui, and ses Mariners and y doit partir le Maistre pourtant
quil prent in guinda ge, and doit la guindage estre mys pour restorer le
damage primerement and le remenant soit estre eulx, maiz se cords rompent
sans se quils les eussent monstrees aux Merchants, ilz seront tenus a render
tout le damage, mais se les Merchants dient que les cords sunt bonnes and
belles and ilz rompent chun doit partirau damage Cestassavoier des Merchants a
qui le vin sera tant seulement, and cest le judgment en ce cas.

And clearly this is a Judgment upon a thing happening upon a Port or Haven,
and no where else; whereby the Judge of the Admiralty is to be guided in
businesses of this and the like nature.

How a Master ought to behave himself toward and amongst his Mariners, and the
Mariners toward the Master, and they amongst themselves, be they upon Seas, or
Port, or Haven, and what the punishment is in case they demean themselves
otherwise, is by these Laws plainly showed Ol Jud. 12 in quibusque lib. 11.
.

The same Laws have likewise provided what is to be done in case one Ship shall
do damage or hurt to another, upon the Port or Haven.

Vne nef est en ung comis a maree and estant a sa maree avec autre nef vient
and fiert la nef qui est en sa paix en tell maniere q'lle este dommagee du
coup que lautre nef luy done and yades vins en fundrez dedens le dommage doit
estre apprisie and party parmoitie en tree les deuz nefs and les vins qui Jont
dedens les deux nefs dovient parti, etc. Et est raison pour quoy cest Judgment
est fait and ainsi feust quil avoit tout le dommage amend une vi eille nef se
mist volentiers en la voire dune melleure nef pour auder avoir lautere nef se
elle eustous ses dommages, mais quant elle sceit q'lle doit parir a la moitie
elle se met volentiers horse de la voye, and cest le Judgment en ce cas Ol.
Jud. 15. in aliis lib. 14.
.

By these Laws likewise are determined differences falling out between Ships
lying at Anchor, upon any Port or Haven, and determine what is to be done in
case one Ship cast Anchor too near another, and who shall pay the damage in
case any shall be sustained thereby, or for want of boighs, etc.

Vne nef ou deux ou pleuseurs en ung havene ou il ya pou deave and si assech
lune des nefs trop pres de lautre le maistre de celle nef doit dire aux autres
Mariners seigneurs levex ure ancre car elle est trop pres de nous and pouroit

and lancre leur face damage ilz serout teneuz a lamander tout au long. Et sil
yeufl mys ancre sans boy and elle face damage ilz seront tenuz a lamender tout
au long, and silz sont en ung Haven qui astech ilz seront tenuz a mettre
balingues aux ancres quilz ne peregent au plam and cest la Judgment O^. Jud.
16. in aliis 15.
.

What meat the Mariners may carry out of the Ship to land, how long they may
stay before they return, what damage happening either to the Ship or Goods
(being in the Port or Haven) in their absence, they are liable unto; these Laws
do determine, besides many other accidents happening in and upon the Ports and
Havens, whith are by them decided: as when a Ship shall by contrary winds, and
stress of weather, be tired at Sea, so that she is constrained to make to a
Port not intended, and there is in want of Victual or Tackle and Furniture, to
set to Sea again, and wants money wherewith to Victual, Tackle, and furnish
again, what the Master may then do, whether he may pawn or sell the Merchants
Goods for relief of the Ship, what and how much of the Goods he may so pawn or
sell, when the case is that he may so do, and when and upon what occasion he
may sell the Ship, and by Law is warranted so to do, and when Ol. Jud. 21. in
aliis l. 20.
.

The same Laws do determine what is to be done, in case a man take upon him the
office of a Loads-man or Pilot, and by reason thereof undertaketh to bring a
Ship safe to Anchor in the Port of her discharge, and through his negligence or
want of skill, the Ship be cast away or perished, or the Goods damnified, in
the Port or Harbor; and likewise, when and upon what grounds such Pilot or
Loads-man shall be discharged, and how and in what manner the Master of that
Ship shall be liable Ol. Jud. 33. 34. and Jud. 24.
.

These Laws set forth likewise what is to be done by the Master of a Ship, when
his Ship arriveth in the right Port of her discharge, and has stayed there by
the space of one and twenty days for discharge, and is not in that space
discharged. More particulars I might instance in, out of the said Laws of
Oleron to the same purpose, and how far the said Laws are extended or limited
by latter writers upon the Civil and Maritime Laws; but that will be a work
more properly to be entered upon, when this Jurisdiction of the Admiralty shall
be completely settled, and freed from interruptions in its due procedings: I
shall therefore only set down this last Judgment, in its own language, not
endeavoring to show what the Law is either in this case, or any of the other
before recited, but to conclude that by these Laws so long since established
for the directions of Judgments in Maritime causes it plainly appears that
the Ports and Havens are within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and that all
differences therein, or thereupon arising, are cognoscible and tryable in the
same.

The words of the Judgment are these.

Item ordonne est pour custume de mer, q'se une nef arrive en ung Port a sa
droitturier le descharge and demoure la nef illecq', chargee jusq's axxi jours
ounrables la mettre puet been mettre horse sur ung keye and le Maistre doit
ordonner and bailler ung de ses Mariners an Merchant pour prendre guard aux
vins ou autres derrenes jusque a tant q'le Maistre soit pay de son frett Ol.
Jud. 3^.
.

Et cest le Judgment en ce cas.

Very many more there are, which will be too tedious here to set down: None of
all which is by any part of the Common Law, treated of at all, nor can it if it
keep its own rules render the same Judgment with these Laws but a diverse, if
not in many cases a clear contrary.

CHAP. XI.
That by the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty settled before the last
Confirmation of the Laws of Oleron 12 Edw. 3. and Articles of enquiry added
thereunto, it is plain that the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the Ports as
well as upon the high Seas.
THere are likewise ancient Statutes of the Admiralty to be observed, both upon
the Ports and Havens, the high Seas, and beyond the Seas, which are comprised
in an old authentic Book, called The black Book of the Admiralty, which
Statutes are engrossed upon Vellam in the said Book, and written in an ancient
hand, in the ancient French Language, which plainly show the Admirals
Jurisdiction to be upon the Ports and Havens, as well as upon the high Seas. I
shall set down only one of those Statutes for proof thereof, which shows how
and in what manner damage done by one Ship unto another in a Port or Haven, as
well as upon the high Seas, shall be satisfied in case the same be wilfully
done, and how, and in what manner in case the same be unwillingly done by
chance, by reason of tempest or other mishap. The words of the Statute are
these.

It que nulle nef ne vessel de la flotte pour orgueil ne pour haine ou envy
sur le mer our entrants es ports ou en port ottroie veille audommage dautre nef
ou vessel de la flotte au pris par ceux de la flotte sur pain de fair plain
amend de ce qui est endommage en son default, and qui endommage and debrysse
au tres entrants aux ports, ou dedens ports, ou sur le mere neuvoillautz par
cause de tempeste ou autrement il paiera and amendera la moitie du dommage a la
discretion Stat. ult. pa. 16.
and Judgment de l'Admiral.

There are likewise in the same Book added unto these Statutes the Oath, and
Articles, whereupon Juries were and are to make their presentiments unto the
Admiral, all written with the same hand, the Oath only in old English, the
Articles in the same Language, with the Statutes which show what things are
enquirable and presentable before the Admiral, and there punishable, and how
and in what manner such offenses are to be punished: out of which it i^ easily
and plainly to be gathered, that the Admiral has a full and complete
Jurisdiction, exclusive to all others upon all Ports, Havens, and Creeks of the
Sea. I shall here set down verbatim the Oath to be Administered unto the Jury,
and some few of those Articles, which show the Admirals Power and Jurisdiction
to be upon the Ports and Havens.

The Oath.
This here see my Lord the Admiral that I John at nashe shall well and truly

Next unto this Oath is set forth the punishment of the Jurate that shall
disclose the secrets of the King, or any of his fellow Jurates, to be inflicted
upon him by the Admiral Page 18.
.

The very first and second Articles to be given in charge are for Theft
committed upon any Port or Haven, and the punishment thereof set down. These
are the words in the Articles.

Soit Art. 1. p. 18.

And so Art. 3. p. 19.
they proceed to set down the punishment of him that shall cut any Cable,
whereby the Ship is cast away, or any man lose his life, etc.

And Art. 4. p. 19.
of such as shall remove an Anchor.

And likewise of such as shall rob Strangers Ships not being enemies.

And Art. 5. p. 19.
how their goods shall be restored to them, though they pursue not the Felon to

is by that Law punishable upon the first conviction, by forty days
imprisonment; upon the second, half a years imprisonment; upon the third, death.

By the next Art. 8. p. 21.
Article, common disturbers of Ships and Passengers, either upon the Seas, or
the Ports, are to be enquired of, and their punishment is therein described.
Item soit en quis de touts communs malfaiseos sur la mer and en ports se acun

In what case Page 23.
the Master of a Ship is bound for the forthcoming of his Mariners.

The manner of out-lawing and banishing a Felon that absenteth himself, and
cannot be taken: And this Law, as appears by the Article, was made by Henry
the F^rst, which runs thus:

It en Page 24.
temps du primier Roy Henry, and en temps de pluseurs Roys devant de puis quant
ung homme estoit endite en fellonnie l' Admiral ou son lieutenant manderoit
ung cape a l'Admirall de la Court ou au visconte de lu visconte aux second
sessions quil restoit trouve and sera espace en tres deux sessions xxi. ovors
ou plus il sera demand a la second session solemn lement, etc.

And likewise the manner of out-lawing and banishing one that has done any
trespass upon any Ship, Tackle, or Furniture thereof, etc. whether upon the
Seas, or upon any Port, which Law by the Article appears to have been made by
the same King Henry the First, and his Admiral of the North and West, and
others of authority and power adjoined to them. The Law begins thus:

Item Page 26. and 27.
gens quit sont banniz en trespass ne seront une banniz sinon par ung an ou
deux, etc. se lon la discretion de l' Admiral and sil est trouve en Angleterre
dedens le temps, il avara judgment comme devant est dit, and les biens du
banny en trespass ne seront une forfeitz au Roy Comment, etc. And ends thus:
Et ceste ordounare fuit faitte premieremet a Gypswiz out temps du primer Roy
Henry per les Admiralz de North and West, and autres seigneurs adheirdantz.

If Ships be arrested for the Kings service, or for any other reasonable cause
by the Kings Officers or Admiral, and break the Arrest, the penalty is by these
Laws declared; and this Law wherein the penalty is declared, appears to be
made in the time of Richard the First at Grimsby by the advice of most of the
Lords of the Realm. The Law begins thus:

Item Page 28.
soit en quis de nefs qui sont arrestes pour le service du Roy ou pour autre
resonnable cause per les officers du Roy ou de l' Admiral and debrisent
larrest. And afterward it follows thus: Ordonne estoit en temps du Roy
Richard le primier a Grymsby per advys de pluseurs seigneurs du Roylme que
quant nefs seront arresters, etc.

Diverse other things of the like nature are likewise enquirable in the
Admiralty Court, the penalty and punishments whereof are declared by these Laws.

Sir Edward Coke for proof that the Admiral has no Jurisdiction upon the
Ports, amongst other things instanceth in one particular that 7 Hen. 6. 22, 35.
an Action was brought at the Common Law for forestalling in a Port or Haven;
because 7 H. 6. 22. 35.
it is infra corpus comitatus, which is a thing taken for granted, but no ways
proved at all, as is before Sup. l. 2. cap 8.
set forth: I shall therefore here set down two or three Articles which show
that if by Port be meant within the flood-mark in the Havens, forestalling and
regrating there, are within the cognizance of the Admiral in the Admiralty
Court; the first is this.

Item soit enquis de touts Merchants and Mariners qui vont horse des Ports aux
nefs charges de Marchandizes quant les dictes nefs voul droient enter ouz dits
Ports and les Marchandises a chattent en gros and les amesnent aux Ports and
puis les vendent a greigneur et plus chier march and plus que les preimer
Merchans vouldroient engrevance du commun peuple si aucun est endite en tell cas
and convicte par xii il sera imprisonne per demi an and puis fera fin autant
come les biens amsi a chattez amonterent maiz se la ditte nef sois repose
dattendre son temps and homme a chate de lui Merchandise en tell marne il ne
serame dese impesh^e ne riens ne perdra verse le Roy. Page 31.


Another against forestallers in any Ship, is this:

Item soit enquis de tous ceulx quia chattent bledz poisson ou autres vitailles
dedens la nef en regratant devant quilz soient venuz adeu march se aucun est
en ce endite, etc. it sera greissuousement pugny and fera fin au Roy de tant
Page 34.
comme la value des bledz ou poisson amsi achattez a monte.

Another against Regrators within the flood-mark is this;

Item de ceulx qui achattent en gras bledz poisson sale, poisson freiz ou autre
vitaille dedens le flodmarks en Regratant, etc. aient mesme le Page 31.
judgment.

Diverse other Articles are there expressly set down against several offenses
committed upon Ports or Havens, with the particular punishments to be inflicted
upon such offenders, as against the exactions of Page 31.
Water-officers. Against any man's appropriating to himself the benefit of Page
33.
salt-waters. Against Kidles, Wears and the like hinderance of the Fishing,
which is Page 33.
common to all. Against the false Weights, false Measure, and the like, used in
any Ship or Page 35.
Vessel. Against erecting of Mills, or adding or altering any thing about them,
to the hinderance, hurt or damage of any Port or Page 36.
Haven. Against the taking up and concealing or keeping back from the
possession of the Admiral, any Flotson, Jetson or Lagon found as well upon the
Ports, as upon the Page 36.
Seas. Against the excessive Wages of Page 37.
Ship-Carpenters.

All which do plainly show that the Admiral has had, and ought to have
absolutely power and jurisdiction of and over even such things, and in such
causes as Sir Edward Coke instanceth in, long before the times from whence he
deduceth his authorities: And diverse others of these Articles to the same
purpose I might instance in, which for brevities sake I omit.

CHAP. XII.
That by the Inquisition taken at Quinborough secundo Aprilis anno 49 Ed. 3.
Annoque Dom. 1375. it is plain that the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the
Ports, as well as upon the high Seas.
EDward the Third by a solemn Inquisition of diverse persons most famous for
skill in Maritime matters and seafaring businesses, selected and chosen from
diverse parts of the Kingdom, and assembled at Quinborough upon the second of
April in the 49th year of his reign, Anno Dom 1375. set down certain Laws
concerning the Admiralty Court and seafaring matters in old French, all which
are yet extant in the old authentic Black Book of the Admiralty before
mentioned. I shall only set down what does show the Jurisdiction of the Admiral
to be upon the Ports and Havens; the Inquisition first sets forth who was
then Warden of the Cinque Ports, who Lord Admiral, and who were the
Inquisitors, in these words.

Cest l' Inquisition pris a Quenesburgh per commandment de nostre sieur Roy
Edward le tiers puis la conquest d' Angleterre la 2d jour dauril, lan de son
regne quarante and neu^me devant William sire de Latymer Chamberlain d'
Angleterre and gardenn des aul ports, and Mr. William de Nevill Admiral de

John Burgeys leisne, and John Burgeys a puisne de Fobbing, Hammond Lovetost,
and John Snell de Bellingham, Thomas Spring de Remham, Thomas Rame and Richard
Line, William Jankyn and Richard Lorbyn de Queneburgh pour mesmes le points de
sor mais tenir firmement and continuer selon le voier dit apres Page 58.
escript.

So that by this last clause it appears that these Laws were thenceforth to
be firmly held and continued; which do thus present themselves.

Et primier dient les avaunt ditz furer per^es serements que se, etc.

It is plain by the 17 Ordinance, that if a Mariner do hire himself to a Master
of a Ship, in any Port or Haven, and shall afterward, before the Ship goes
out of the Haven on her Voyage, forsake and leave her, he shall be punished by
the Admiral. The Law runs thus:

Item que touts Ord. 17. pa. 63.
manners de mariners que sont retenuz avec aucun Seigneur de nef pour liu servir
A Bordeaulx au ailleurs pur Rainsonnable salaire ainsi comme a este use en
diverse ports par tout le Royalme, etc. and se aucun manner se void daucun e
nef en tell cas il sera gre vosement amerciez selon la discretion de l' Admiral
and fera gre au posseseur de la nef.

Hereby it is manifest that the Admiral has jurisdiction upon the Ports,
otherwise he could not punish the Mariner for his forsaking the Ship there
before her going to sea.

And the case is the like in respect of the payment of Lodmanage, which being a
thing proper to a Port or Haven, is, according to the Laws of Oleron, to be
decided by the Admiral, as has been already Sup. ca^. prox. praed.
showed, is by these Laws again appointed in these words.

Item endroit Lodemanage dient les avaunt ditz jurez que leur semble in cest cas
elz ne scavent meilleur advys ne remedy mais que ce soit de sorce usez, etc.
fait par main'e quest continue en la loyd' Ord. 16. page 63.
Oleron.

And these were established for Laws, against which if any do offend, the
Admiral does justice in such manner, that others may be thereby warned not to
offend against them, as appears by the last of them, which says thus.

Item ordonne estoit que ce aucune nef biens merchandises, etc. and concludes
with this Clause. Et se aucumy soit trouve rebelle encontre aucun des ditz
pointz quil soit ainsi justise and constraint per l' Admiral quantres y
prengnout exemple de luy and redoublet le plus datempler ou aler en contre cest
ordonnance ou aucun point contenue en Ord. ult. p. 64.
icells.

Here unto these Laws and Ordinance are likewise, as unto the ancient Statutes
of the Admiralty before mentioned, adjoined diverse Articles, inquirable,
presentable, and punishable in the Admiralty Court, many of which, as did the
others, do plainly show that the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the Ports and
Havens. Some of them here I shall likewise set down.

It soit enquis de tous petites, fellonies, emblants en ports, ou sur la mer
dedens nefs ou batealx or ou argent ou de brusent coffres and emportant ce qui
est dedens icelles ou emblest amrous ancres ou autres apperilz de nefs ou
bateaulx ou emblet ou coupent sur la mer Rees ou levant Taws.

Other Articles I find here as in the former, to enquire of such as found
either Waifs, Flotson, Jetson, or Lagon, viz. either Ships, Vessels or Boats of
any sort whatsoever upon the Seas, or Seaports, forsaken and lost by the
owners, Goods lost by Shipwreck, and found floating or swimming upon the top of
the waters; Goods cast out of a Ship being in danger of wreck, and beaten to
the Shore by the waters, or cast on the shore by the Mariners; or Goods lying
in the bottom of the Sea, or Port, there likewise left and lost by the owners,
as Art, 5, 6, 7. p. 67.
Iron, Gold, Silver, Anchors, etc. whereof the Admiral has not had his share.

Here likewise (as of all the former) is contained that Article against Weirs,
Kidles, Blind-stake, Water-mills, etc. which do an noy the great Streams, and
Channels of Havens or Ports; which follows in these words.

Item Art. 26. p. 67.
soit enquis de tous ceulx qui foustinent sur les. gros streams and channels
des Havens ou Ports, Weres, Kedylles, Blindstakes, Watermilles ou autres
instruments en aueant ance des Ports per les quelz nefs ou batean out este
periz ou homme mort.

Amongst these Articles also, one enquireth of such as have found any one dead
upon the Sea, or in any Ports within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and
has found upon him any Gold, Silver, Jewel, or any other Commodity of value,
and has not rendered it to the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, as a Deodand.

Item A^t. 27. ^a 68.
soit enquis de ceulx qui ont trouve sur aucun homme mort trouve sur la mer, ou
en Ports dedens le Jurisdiction de Admiralte or, argent ou autre Jovell ou
chose de value and le navy rend a l' Admiral ou son Lieutenant comme^dedant
car ce appertient a l' Admiral pour disposer pour lame de homme mort.

By these Art. 29 and 30. p. 68.
Articles are likewise to be enquired of the death of a man in any Ship,
Vessel, or Boat, etc. And of the maime, sheding of blood, within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and diverse other such like matters, etc.

And so for Art. 32, 33. and 34. pa. 69.
Ships, Barges and Ballengers arrested for the Voyages of the King or Admiral;
and breach of the Arrests, and the like for Mariners.

By these Articles likewise are to be enquired of all such as do drag for
Oysters, Muscles, etc. in unseasonable times, and such as do destroy the Fry
A^t. 38, 39. page 70.
of Fish, and of such Mariners as do violence to the Owner of the Ship,
contrary to the Laws of the Sea, and Statutes of Oleron; such Mariners as
disobey the lawful commands of their Master; such Masters as keep not their
Mariners in order and peace according to the Laws of Oleron, and likewise of
(...). 27, 28, 29. pa. 71. 72.
Loads-men and Loads-manage.

And here particularly is to be enquired of such as do claim propriety in any
Port or Haven, which belongs unto the King, without Charter, or Prescription
to the disinheritance of the King.

Item soit enquis se aucun clame properte en port ou comers qui attient a
^^stre sur le Roy and ne la my par chartre ou praescription en disheritance du
Art. 48. p. 72.
Roy. And in this respect as well as others, is the Admiral called Custos
portuum, and Custos Cap.
maritimarum partium, etc.

Here again, as by the former Articles, are Forestallers and Regraters, as is
before mentioned, to be enquired of Art. 41. 42. pa. 71.
; and so are Weights and Measures, and the abuses of water Officers Art. 49.
and 54. p. 73.
.

By another Article here are Fishermen to be enquired of, which take Salmons
out of season in any Arm of the Sea, as Thames, Trent, etc. specifying some
particular Arms of the Sea, and concluding withal in general, so that by Arms
of the Sea in these Laws expressed, Ports and Havens must needs be meant; the
same things which Sir Edward Coke under the same notion would have to be within
the Bodies of Counties, and out of the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty; which we
see plainly did thereunto belong in far more ancient times, then any of his
proofs and authorities are of to the contrary; and these are the words of the
Article.

Item Art. 56. pa. 74.
soit enquis de poissonners que prennent saulmons bors de saison aux bras de
mer cestassavoir Thames, Trent, Deve, Derwent, Agree, Reme, Humbre, and autres
riviers q'l conq's ou destroint fry de saulmont en aucun temps de lau.

For any one to remove an Art. 60. and 61. page 75.
Anchor of any Ship or Vessel without warning given to the Master or some of
his Company, by which means the Ship does perish, or any man is slain, or cut
the Boy from the Boy-rope, so that the Anchor is lost, are offenses against the
Laws of Oleron, presentable before the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, and
punishable according to those Laws.

Here likewise is an Article agreeable with the former, amongst those adjoined
unto the old Statutes concerning Art. 66. pa. 75.
Shipwrights wages.

Diverse other Articles there be which concern other matters belonging to the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, some of which might have been likewise deduced
into proof for the Admirals Jurisdiction upon the Ports; but I conceive these
will be sufficient to convince any indifferent man that he had Jurisdiction
there in Edward the Thirds time, and by those that are adjoined to the ancient
Statutes of the Admiralty, and introduction of the Laws of Oleron, it will
appear that he had Jurisdiction there long before.

Unto these Articles are joined several Admonitions drawn into several
Articles, for the due observance of these Articles, and putting them in Page 76*
Execution.

And next unto them is set forth the manner of proceeding according to the
Maritime Laws, both in causes Civil and Criminal.

CHAP. XIII.
That by the aucient Statutes of Enquiry, translated out of French into Latin,
by Rowghton, the Admirals Jurisdiction is upon the Ports and Havens, as well as
over the high Seas.
WElwood in his Proeme to his Abridgement of the Sea Laws makes mention of the
Inquisition taken by 18 most famous persons for skill in seafaring matters
assembled at Quinborough, and the Articles there agreed on, out of which I have
cited some in the foregoing chapter; and he says, that Thomas Roughton
afterward turned them into Latin, and entitled them Articles De officio
Admiralitatis Angliae. But I do not find that the Articles which Roughton
translated out of French into Latin were the Articles agreed on at
Quinborough; for the Articles of Quinborough set not down the penalties upon
the breach of every particular Article (but refer the punishment to the
former ancient Statutes and Articles of the Admiralty, and the Laws of Oleron)
whereas those translated by Roughton do; besides at the Inquision of
Quinborough, there were by those exquisite skillful men in Maritime businesses
both at home and abroad, several Sea Laws or Statutes agreed on, and by the
King confirmed, which I find not translated by Roughton, where he averreth such
his translation of Articles out of the French tongue into the Latin, and
calls them Statutes, in regard the penalty of all or most of them are therein
determined and appointed, which his averrement is in these words at the end
thereof; Haec statuta fuerunt translata per me I here contradict not Well for
Roughton might also translate the Statutes and Articles of Quinborow at some
other time as well as these.
Thomam Roughton a lingua Gallicana in Latinam, signum meum manuale in
testimonium ejusdem hic apponendo. Now in this averrement there is no mention
of the Articles of Quinborough, besides those; and these agree not in method,
nor in number.

Nor are these the translation of those ancient Articles adjoined unto the
ancient Statutes of the Admiralty (which have the penalty upon the breach of
every of them set down in them, as these have) for they have neither the same
method, nor the same division, these being divided into 50 Articles, those but
into 38. Yet are not these Articles in any one particular contrariant or
repugnant one unto another; but so agreeable in matter of substance, that that
agreement amongst them may stand for a true confirmation, and a strong
corroboration both of the justice, equity and authority they carry along with
them, and also of the credit that is to be given to them.

They all so agreeing (as I have said) these must needs prove the same thing
that the others have done, namely the Sup. lib. 1. cap.
Admirals Jurisdiction to be upon the Ports and Havens. I shall set down some
few of these in their own language, to show this agreement, and so pass to a
yet further proof of this particular.

But I shall first observe that as heretofore Sup. lib. 1. cap.
I have showed that the Admirals anciently have had joined unto their Patents
for that place whereof they were Admirals, a special Precept to all Sheriffs,
Mayors, Bailiffs, Constables, Headboroughs, etc. commanding them to be obedient
unto the Admiral and his Lieutenants, and to be aiding and assisting unto them
when they should be thereunto required; so by the front of these Articles or
Statutes the Admiral is directed to grant his Warrant to the Bailiffs of the
Port (if it be a liberty) as well as to his Marshall for the summoning of a
Jury to make enquiry (according to these Articles) of all such offenses as are
committed contrary thereunto; which Articles are there said to concern the
Maritime Law; and these are the words of that direction.

Inprimis Articulorum front.
cum veneris ad portum per costeras maris, si sit in villa quae habet
libertatem, fiat Warrantum Mariscallo Curiae ac Ballivis libertatis quod venire
faciant xxiiij. probos and legales de viceneto illo, viz Mercatores and
Marinarios, and alios per quos rei veritas melius sciri poterit and inquiri, ad
inquirendum in Curia Admiralli certis tida Certis tida and loco; nota, that the
tide is observed by ebbing and flowing upon the Ports and Havens, and not upon
the high sea.
and loco tenenda per eorum sacramentum fideliter praestandum, quicquid eis
constare poterit super certis articulis legem maritimam tangentibus, super
quibus erant ad tunc onerati pariter and jurati.

And the penalties of the breach of Articles first mentioned are as these are,
in case the party be convict, and that by express words, sil est de ce
convicte, etc. as will appear by some of those I have before cited, Cap.
and as will here appear by some of those I am about to cite, si indictatus and
convictus.

Whence I gather that which will clearly overthrow the very foundation whereon
many of Sir Edward Cokes arguments are grounded, viz. that wherean inquiry may
be made by Jury, there the Admiral has no Jurisdiction, which we plainly see
is not so.

The first of these Articles with a nota, is the same with that which precedeth
the first mentioned Articles, which is against such as shall discover the Kings
Counsel, or his fellow-Jurats; and the penalty is the same here with that
there, which is a very terrible punishment (but I am not about to set forth
what the penalty or punishment of the breach of every Article is) It is enough
for my purpose, that the Articles do some of them plainly show that the
Admiralty Jurisdiction is not limited to the high Seas, as Sir Edward Coke
would have it, and that by this first Article as well as by many more: For
certainly whether a Jurate does disclose the Kings counsel, or his Fellows
either at Sea or Land, or upon Port or Haven in these Maritime matters, it is
inquirable in the Admiralty Court, and there punishable; for it is a ridiculous
thing to set a penalty or punishment different from all punishments of the
Common Law (as this is) upon any offense, and not to have power to inflict it
upon the party so offending, unless he go to the sea to disclose and discover
that whch he has already done, or might have done at land. And this likewise
will check the opinion of those that hold that whatsoever is done at land,
howsoever it concern Maritime affairs, is cognoscible at the Common Law, and
not in the Admiralty: but of that in its due place. I shall here only set down
(as I said before) some few of those Articles, which show the Admiralty
Jurisdiction to be upon the Ports, and are agreeable with the former which I
have before mentioned.

The sixth Article does enquire of such as have taken up any Weife, Jetson,
Flotson, or Lagon out of the Sea, or any great River, and have not satisfied
the Admiral for his share, this is punishable, though it were Weife, Jetson,
Flotson, or Lagon in any great River or Port. The words of the Article are
these.

Inquiratur si quis reperit super mare sive in grossis rivis, naves, ferrum,
plumbum, seu aliqua alia bona fluctuantia, vel in profundo jacentia, quorum
nemo est possessor, quae vulgariter appellantur Flotteson, Jetteson, Lagon, and
Domino Admirallo non satisfecit pro part, Dominum Admirallum contingente, viz.
de medietate; qui secus fecerit, si super hoe indictatus and convictus fuerit,
etc. partem suam amittit nichilominus cum Admirallo secundum discretionem suam
finem in hac part faciendo ad valentiam bonorum Roughton Art. 6 and 18.
inventorum.

The seventh Article inquireth of Mills, Kiddles, or other things in the Sea,
or great Rivers, hurtful to Ships or Navigation, and how the causers of them
are to be punished: the Article runs thus.

Inquiratur Roughton, Art. 7.
si quis in grossis rivis levavit molendina, Kydell, seu aliqua alia
instrumenta quae navigantibus seu navibus Communiter sunt nociva. Quod si de
hujusmodi molendinis, Kydellis, aut instrumentis, in nocumentum ut praefertur
scituatis, domino Admirallo per inquisitionem constiterit extrahi de^ant
penitus, and destrui transgressores, qui in hoc casu super hoc finem cum domino
Admirallo facturi sunt.

The tenth Article is against such as being arrested to serve the King, break
the Arrest, who surely are both arrested, and do break the Arrest either at
land or upon the Port, and not upon the high Seas, and how such are to be
punished: which the Article shows thus.

Inquiratur Roughton, Art. 10.
si arrestatus ad serviend. Regi fregit arrestum, hujusmodi transgressor stat
in gratia regia sive Admiralli sui utrum voluerint committere Carceribus
mancipandum vel finem facere, in hac part, si arrestum hujusmodi factum
manifestum fuerit cognitum.

The twelfth Articles is against such as do take Oysters and Muscles in
prohibited times of the year, and such as do at any time of the year fish with
Nets of too narrow a mash in great Rivers, and destroy small Salmons, and other
fry of Fish, who are to be punished as this Article shows.

Inquiratur Roughton, Art. 12.
de his qui capiunt ostria seu musculos inter primum diem Maii, and Festum
exaltationis Sanctae Crucis, and etiam de his qui quocunque tempore anni per
retia nimis stricta in grossis rivis deflruunt salmunculos, seu alios pisces
nimis juvenes; omnes isti in hac part indictati sive officio Admiralli
detecti, sive aliqualiter accusati, finem facient secundum discretionem
Admiralli, etc.

The fourteenth Article does most manifestly show the Admirals Jurisdiction
upon the Ports and Havens; for it sets forth the punishment of such as do
hinder or resist the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, freely to determine, decide,
correct, and put in execution all transgressions, batteries, felonies, and
other causes whatsoever happening upon the Sea, or upon whatsoever Rivers,
waters, or Rivolets of the Sea unto the first Bridge, according to the custom
and Law Maritime, in these words.

Inquiratur Roughton, Art. 14.
de his qui impediunt, vel resistunt domino Admirallo; seu ejus locum tenenti,
batterias, felonias, and alias causas quascunque super mare and infra
quoscunque rivos, aquas, sive riviculos maris usque ad primum pontem
emergentes, terminare, decidere, corrigere and executioni demandare libere
possunt, quia omnes isti sunt rebels, and tanquam rebels sunt puniendi.

The sixteenth Article is against forestallers in Ports and Havens, and sets
the penalty and punishment of such offenders, and in what case such shall be
freed: thus.

Inquiratur Rought. Art. 16.
de his, qui ingressu portus, vel infra portum forinstallant and emunt
victualia in grosso, ad damnum comitatus vicinum, indictatus super hoc and
convictus, etc. imprisonamentum, dimidii anni habebit, praeterea finem faciet
domino Admirallo ad valentiam bonorum hujusmodi. Si tamen naves cum hujusmodi
merchandizis sive victualibus vento contrario reluctante impeditae, ventum
expectent faventem, emptores hujusmodi rerum sive victualium ab omni
impeditione in hac part erunt immunes, and nichil domino Regi, aut Admirallo
perdent, nec amittent.

Many Articles more there are which do enquire of offenses committed, and
punishments proper for them, which are such penalties and punishments as are
not used at the Common Law; I shall but only name the chiefest of them.

There be Articles against

Stealing, Roughton, Art. 20.
, cutting off, or carrying away the buoys fixed to an Anchor, whereby the Ship
does perish, or is made worse, which is punished by the Law of the Sea with a
punishment different from that of the Common Law.

Against Roughton, Art. 22.
Carpenters and other Artificers employed about making or repairing of Ships,
for taking excessive wages.

Against such as cast Roughton, Art. 24.
Sand, Ballast, or any other thing into the Channel of a Port or Haven.

Against a Roughton, Art. 26.
Loadsman that undertaketh to bring a Ship safe through the Haven to the Key or
place of discharge, and through his ignorance, idleness, negligence, or other
fault suffers the Ship or Merchandises to perish, the punishment is such as
is not used at the Common Law.

Against such as that Roughton, Art. 27. and 28.
strike, wound, draw blood, make any fray, or kill any man within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, they are to be punished according to the
quantity and quality of the offense.

Against Roughton, Art. 29, 30, and 31.
Regraters, such as use false weights, and false measures in their Ships for
buying and selling by in the Ports and Havens.

Against such as take Roughton, Art. ^5.
extraordinary Portage in any Haven, and the Article sets down what Portage
is to be paid by Ships of such a burden, etc.

Against Roughton, Art. 36.
Port-keepers and Water-bayliffs that raise new Customs and excessive Fees
within the Port or Haven, etc.

Against Roughton, (...)
Ships and Men appointed to serve the King, and avoid the service.

Against such as shall cut any Roughton, Art. ^0.
Cables, etc.

Against R. Art. 42, 43, 44.
Felonies done in Foreigners Ships, and other Ships upon the Seaports and
Havens; and against such as shall remove any Anchor.

Against R. Art. 45.
notorious Malefactors, either upon the Sea or Ports.

Against R. Art. 49.
such as have taken and concealed any Deodand upon the Sea, Port, or Haven.

To conclude, the Admiralty is so far from being limited to the cognizance of
things done upon the high Seas, that it is not so much as limited to things
done upon Sea and Seaports, but the power and authority thereof is, and of
ancient times has been extended to all such things as do belong unto the Seas,
Ports, Havens, and Salt-waters, as will appear by the 34th Article, which is
this.

Item R. Art. 34.
inquiratur de his qui colligunt in sossat. aquam salsam, and faciunt sibi
piscarias, scituantes and de novo facientes and incipientes gurgites, aut alia
sibi ncci^a immobilia, percipientes exitus and proficua eorundem ad eorum opus
proprium and quae in aqua salsa omnibus debent esse communia, poena si
indictati fuerint vel impetiti, poenam ordinationis Regis Johannis apud
Hastings subituri sunt: etc.

And this Article further shows, that such things as these which concern or
belong to Ports or Havens, did in King John's time belong to the Cognizance of
the Admiralty.

And now I shall proceed unto such proofs as I have gathered from the Civil ^aw
in confirmation of what I have gathered from other A^tiquity: But I must first
show that that Law is used and practiced in other Nations, being a thing by
some strongly denied.

CHAP. XIV.
That the Civil Law is used and practiced in all or most Nations of
Christendom.
I Have heard (but am unwilling to believe it) that some have strangely dreamt,
and as strangely fancied that dream to be true, that the Civil Law is not
received, nor of any use at all in foreign Nations, but the same has been
1200 years since abolished: but I doubt not but that when their judgments are
awaked, and better informed, they will find the same to be but a dream, and
will easily be persuaded not to persist in such an error unreformed, which I
will more willingly term to be but a mistake, for that the same may in part be
understood to be true, and the other part from thence miscollected; for the
City of Rome was no sooner built then it had Civil Laws, and Sanctiones
ordained, constituted and appointed for the government thereof, which in many
hundred years were, and in many more several Emperors Reigns, by them altered,
augmented, and increased, which were by wars and turmoyls about the time
before mentioned (and long before Justinians reduction of them into method and
order, and compiling them into a body) much distracted and perplexed, or rather
laid aside, and as it were destroyed, and lost, which makes Justinian himself
in his Edict of confirmation of his digests, say, Post bella Justin. in
confirm. F. in prin.
Parthica aeterna pace sopita, postque Vandalicam gentem ereptam and
Carthaginem, imo magis omnem Lybiam Romano Imperio iterum sociatam, and leges
antiquas jam senio praegravatas per nostram vigilantiam praebuit in novam
pulchritudinem and moderatum pervenire compendium: so that it seems these old
Civil Laws with their age and perplexities of wars, which do silence Laws,
were praegravatae, even suppressed, or crushed down, which some perhaps may
term an utter abolition, and not without cause, when as Justinian himself in
the same place, speaking of this reduction of them, Quod nemo antea hoc
superavit Idem. Ibid.
neque humano ingenio possible esse penitus existimavit; that no man (before he
saw it done) did ever hope for, or humane reason seriously think it possible:
For that it was mavelous that the Roman Law, which began with the City it
self, which had by the intestine wars there for almost fourteen hundred years
been staggered, and shaken, and that extending unto the Imperial constitution,
they could be reduced unto one consonancy or agreement. Erat enim mirabile
Romanam sancionem Idem, Ibid.
ab urbe condita usque ad nostri imperii tempora, quae pene in mill and
qu^dringentos annos concurrunt intestinis praeliis vacillantem, hocque and in
imperiales constitutiones extendentem, in unam reducere consonantiam.

And from this suppression, or laying aside of these ancient Roman Laws, some
it seems have miscollected, and unduly concluded, that the same has never
since been received or made use of in any foreign Nation at all.

But this new moulding, reducing, and with so much pains, labor and care,
digesting of those ancient Laws into method, form, and order, and compiling
them into a body, plainly shows the contrary, unless we will believe all this
was done to no purpose.

And if it shall be said that these Laws thus digested, and brought into form
and method, have since such their reduction (which was after the time of the
twelve hundred years before mentioned for their being abolished) been again
suppressed, born down, or abolished, and not received in any foreign Nation to
this day: What shall we say of the printing and so often reprinting of this
large body of the Law, since printing was first invented, which was but 190 odd
years agone? Next what shall we say of the so late reprinting this large body
with the gloss and case, and other notes upon the same, with the large Index
thereunto, in all consisting of six large Volumns in folio, some printed in one
Country, and some in another; some printted within these thirty years, some
within a shorter time?

Or what shall we say of the several Authors of most, if not of all the several
Nations of Christendom, which have in all the several Centuries of years since
the compiling of this body, even unto this time, wrote and commented upon the
same, some on one part, some on another; and of all those other Authors of all
or most several Nations, which have wrote several Tractates of Decisions and
other Law Books, which do ground and raise their authority from this body of
the Law, and quote the same for proof of whatsoever they determine?

Shall we say that all this from time to time continued study, industry, labor
and pains has been taken, and all this cost, charge, and vast expense laid out
to no end, for no use or purpose? or shall we say all this is done only to mock
the world? Certainly he that shall say either, will but mock himself, and such
as will believe him; but he can never deceive any one that has but once seen
the inside of a Civilian's study, either at home or abroad; for both are the
same, and furnished with books of the same nature and kind; and all Lawyers or
practisers in the Laws, in all parts of Christendom are Civilians, and do
study and take their degrees in the Civil Law, as the Civilians do here, and do
proceed in all causes for the most part according to the course and directions
set down in the Civil Law, and are regulated and guided in all their
determinations and judgments by that Law, saving that in several Nations they
have several municipal Laws, Acts, or Edicts published, and declared amongst
themselves for the regulating their own particular Government, which are
binding unto no others, nor observable in any other Nation, then that wherein
they were constituted and ordained, and that in land businesses, and not in
maritime and sea affairs, wherein several Nations by reason of their Trade and
Traffic eath with other, are concerned, and must have their differences which
happen between them determined by one and the same Law, which is principally
the Civil Law, though some other Maritime Laws, which receive their ground and
foundation from the same, are therewith practiced; by which all differences
likewise happening and arising between Nation and Nation, are to be regulated
and determined, it being now generally received as the Law of Nations, although
at the time of its being compiled into a body, Justinian himself distinguished
it both from that Law of Nations, and from the Law of Nature. And for other
municipal Laws, one Nation will not subject it self unto a municipal Law framed
and constituted by an other, they being in some sort different each from other,
though both derived from one and the same principal Law, and are neither so
many as the Statute Laws of this Land, nor so much different from the Civil Law
it self as our Statute Laws are from our ancient fundamental Common Laws: For
indeed the body of the Civil Law being so ample, large, perfect, and complete
in it self, for decision of all controversies of what nature soever, arising
between persons of what quality or condition soever; The several municipall
Laws of those several Countries, are only some ways confirmatory or
explanatory thereof; or sometimes extending, or sometimes limiting the same;
but seldom or never contrariant or repugnant thereunto, or much differing
therefrom; unless it be in the manner of punishment, or the like; and
sometimes, and in some places they are no other then the very same abreviated
or shortened, and made in affirmance of them, and have their ground from them,
as some of our Statutes here have from the Common Law. Nay, those very
proceedings, and determinations of Controversies in the Parliament of France
(which many have thought most to differ from the proceedings and determinations
of the Civil Law) are notwithstanding plainly agreeable thereunto, and grounded
thereon; nay, the very name, Constitution and Authority thereof, are all
derived from the Civil Law, as does plainly appear by that which Johannes
Montanus concerning the Authority of that great Council, has wrote, as
likewise by the additions made thereunto by Boerius that Countryman, not much
above 100 years since, where it appears that the very name Parliament,
whereby this great Council is called, is derived from the Civil Law; Bartol
Boer. de Authoritate Parla. Ga^ n. 165.
an ancient Commentatour upon that Law being there cited, upon three several
places thereof, for having or using the word Parliamentum in the same sense the
same is used in France, and where likewise diverse other Civil Law Authors are
cited to the same purpose Id. eod loco.
.

And Bartol is likewise cited for that he allows no Prince to hold a
Parliament, that acknowledges a Superior. Princeps Bart. l. 2. c. d^u^c. l.
10.
non potest habere Parliamentum, si superiorem recognoscat. And likewise
Boerius proceeds to the setting forth the use of this Parliament, namely for
the profit of the people, ubi Boer. eod. lo.
super aliquo oportet provideri pro utilitate totius provinciae, praeses debet
facere congregare generale concilium seu Parliamentum, ut super dubio
proposito, sanum and utile concilium exhibeatur. And it is there compared to
the Roman assembly, much mentioned in the Civil Laws Id. Ibid.
Et Parliamentum potest dici coetus, cujus nomen tractum est ex more Romano,
taking rise and example from that glorious Assembly of the Palace of Rome,
mentioned in the Code of the Civil Law. L. humanu^ Cod. de lege.
Id ab omnibus antea proceribus nostri palatii quam gloriosissimo coetu nostro
etc.

It is likewise called the Parliament of Paris, and it is there said to be
called Boer. eod. lo. n. 166.
Parliamentum Parisiense, quasi Parium lamentum, quia Pares Franciae, qui sunt
de numero ipsius, querelas and planctus audiunt, de quo mentionem facit Paul.
de Paul. de Castr^ Consil. 334. vol. antiq.
Castr. in Consil. 334. vol. antiq.

And it is there likewise said to be called Curia suprema, Id. Boer. n. eod.
or curia judicum maximorum juxta Authen. de Consulibus Sect. si autem
mediocre, and tunc dicitur curia, secundum eum, id est cura vel cultura juris,
so that it is said to be the very solicitude, care, or study of the Civil Law;
or the very tilling, dressing, or trimming thereof.

And this great Court at first constituted by King Pipin, consisted ex quatuor
Id. Ibid. number. 171.
viginti consiliariis computatis praesidentibus eisd. and per conclavia, (quae
cameras appellant) distributis. And after other additions made thereunto by
Charles the Great, Son of the said King Pipin; Adjuncti praeterea fuerunt
praedicto corpori octo magistri requestarum, domus regiae, ut sic centenarum
judicum numerum tenens, illius senatus effigiem haberet quem Romulus Romanorum
regum primarius ut rei-publice consulerent, creavit.

There were furthermore adjoined unto this body eight Masters of Requests of
the Kings House, that it keeping the number of an hundred Judges, it might have
the Effigies or Form of that Senate Romulus the first King of the Romans
constituted to counsel the Commonwealth.

Nay, the dignity, the precedence, and placing of the Counselors of this great
Council, is derived from the authority of the Civil Law, as is plainly set
forth in the said Montanus upon the Authority of the Parliament of France, and
Boerius his additions thereon, who both quote the Civil Law for the same; and
so is likewise the very authority of the Council from thence derived, as by the
said Authors does likewise appear. And shall we now say that this great Court
or Council, and the very order and authority thereof was thus framed and
constituted by the rules and directions of the Civil Law, and say, conceive or
think, that their judgments and determinations of Controversies, etc. there
given and made, are not according and agreeable to the same Law?

If I should here endeavor to set forth those several Authors and Writers upon
the Civil Law, which have as I said before, in the several Nations of
Christendom, in all the several Ages and Centuries of years which have been
ever since the Compiling that Body, even unto this time, written and commented
thereon, and those which have wrote the Decisions, Determinations, Judgments,
Objections, and other Law books grounded upon the same, and which cite them for
their authority and proof of what they conclude, I should extend this Chapter
to a whole Book or Volumne, and but show the Civilian, and such as have been
verst in Law Libraries, what they have seen already, and but tell others of
those things which they will neither search for, nor endeavor to see: And I am
afraid I have too far already deviated from my intended port of discharge of
the discourse I in this book entered upon; which was to prove the Ports and
Havens of the Sea to be within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty; but before I
can return to steer a right course thither, it will be necessary, first to show
that the Civil Law is likewise necessarily practiced, used and exercised in all
Admiralty Courts, and there binding, and of authority to direct the
Determinations, Sentences and Judgments decisorie in Maritime and Sea affairs,
between party and patty, be they foreigners or others; and then to show that
by those Laws so exercised and practiced in those Course, as well as by the
other Laws already set forth, it does appear that the Ports and Havens, and all
things done thereou are within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty.

CHAP. XV.
That the Traffic and Sea-trading is different from the bargaining and
trading at land; and that therefore in all Foreign Natious they have their
distinct Judicatories guided by distinct Laws, and that though the Judicatories
for land affairs have in diverse Nations diverse Municipal Laws mixed with the
Civil Law, yet the Civil Law is strictly used and practiced in all Admiralty
Courts, and is absolutely necessary in the decision of all Maritime and Sea
differences.
SUch as were apt to believe that the Civil Law was, and is abolished in all
foreign Parts, and no use made thereof, in the rule and governance of land
affairs, would very hardly (without the removal of that misapprehension) have
been persuaded that the same was of any use in their Admiraly Courts in sea
businesses.

I must therefore in the next place show that he which understands only the
Rhodian Laws, the Laws of Oleron, and the Inquisitions and Statutes before
mentioned (which the Civilian must needs most perfectly do, the first being a
great part thereof inserted in the very body of the Civil Law, and the other
from thence derived) cannot without much reading and knowledge in other parts
of that Law, be sufficiently able to manage the pleadings and arguing of all
Maritime causes arising in Admiralty Courts between party and party, and
between the supreme Authority, and those that are employed by that authority,
and such as are in subjection to the same, much less to judge and determine
such causes therein according to law and justice.

For Justice which rules and swayeth the secular Regimen or Government of all
or most Kingdoms and Commonwealths of Christendom, whereby men are made
happy in possessing and enjoying their own, and defending themselves against
wrongs and injuries offered by others, has two wings, duas volatiles habet
alas, she has two wings wherewith she soars aloft, and stretches her self
unto, and spreads her self over both sea and land, she has two
Jurisdictions, the one fitted with Laws most apt and proper for distributing of
right in all land businesses, the other furnished with Laws most meet and
convenient for the dispensing of equity in all maritime and sea affairs; and
yet how different and distinct soever these two Jurisdictions are each from
other (as I have set forth more at large in the Sup. lib. 2. cap. 1.
first chapter of this second Book) yet do both these wings of justice in all
foreign Nations spring and proceed from one and the same body of the Civil
Law, and are from thence furnished and fitted with different and distinct Laws,
whereby they keep up, and carry justice upright between them both; and by the
one extends her directions unto the business of the land, and by the other
reaches forth her proceed and effects unto the affairs of the sea.

Which two wings, if taken off, Justice must needs fall flat to the ground, and
can by no other means so expand her self, as to extend either her directions
unto the one, or reach forth such her effects unto the other; Secundis alitibus
procedere nequit, she cannot go on prosperously or happily to execute or
perform her own proper office, either upon the one, or upon the other.

Nay, if either of these two wings should be taken off, or but joynted,
implumed, or bereaved of those feathers nature at first gave it, though the
other should be preserved, and kept never so complete and perfect, yet could
Justice by the perfection of that one wing, but hover and heave her self
upwards on one side, whilst the defect in the other would pull her downwards;
and the one side falling to the ground, the other must necessarily follow.

If the power and privileges of either of these Jurisdictions should be
decayed, or but impaired, though the other should be left never so entire, yet
could not the effects of Justice in the one supply the defects in the other:
For the Laws of the Land are no more fit to regulate the Affairs of the Sea,
nor the Laws of the Sea any more apt to rule the business of the Land, then a
horse is fit for a sea Voyage, or a ship for a land Journey.

And then cannot Justice be said to be her self, whilst she shall do right in
one thing, and wrong in another; or whilst she should render that which is
just in one matter, when it is required, and can afford no help at all in
another when it is expected. Justice says Cicero, est habitus animi (communi
utilitate servata) suum cuique tribuens; Justice does every man right, still
preserving the common good.

I will not here say how slowly Justice has oftentimes put right forwards, and
as it were but soared in a circle, by one wings striving to out-fly the other.

But here I will say, that he that will make most haste to his journeys end,
and sets his best leg forward, if that leg shall not cease to kick the other
for making no more haste, or shall by that or such other means lame it, because
it self would get both the credit and profit of the journey, that leg must
necessarily but hop instead of running, or walking, and cannot come so soon to
its journey's end, if ever it come there.

And one leg being lamed, if the crutch that should supply it, be applied unto
the other that is not lame, the body will walk no whit the better; and if one
Wing be plucked, and those Feathers imped into, or added unto the other, the
Bird will fly no whit the faster.

If one of these two Jurisdictions (the two Wings which Justice has to support
her self) should be bereaved of its power and proper privileges, though the
same should be taken and assumed unto the other which enjoys all its own
before, Justice could proceed no whit more duly, but much more prejudiciously
to some or other. For as I said before, the Laws of the Sea are so different
from the Laws of the Land, that they will not serve to each others purpose.

And indeed they must necessarily so be; for the traffic and commerce in
Maritime affairs by transportation at Sea, is in its own nature as different
from the trade of bargaining and chaffering in Land businesses as is the fluid
element of water from the solid element of earth: For as the water does admit
of some mixture of the earth, and yet still remains water; and the earth does
admit of some mixture of water, and yet remains earth, though not in their
absolute purity, yet in such sort, as that the one may properly enough be
termed water, and the other earth.

In like manner does the trafficking, and commerce in Merchandising affairs,
admit in some sort of the like covenanting and contracting as the land Trade
and bargaining does; but yet remains a seafaring Traffic, and Commerce, and
the land-Trade and bargaining does likewise in some sort admit of the like
bartering and exchanging of Goods and commodities, as the Traffiick and
Commerce in Merchandising affairs does, but yet remains a land bargain.

In the same manner do the Laws, which regulate the one, and the Laws which
rule and dispose the other, admit of some mixture each with other, both in
respect of their manner of proceedings to judgment, and sometimes in regard of
their concurrency in the Judgment it self, where the nature of the causes
differs not; and yet the one remains the maritime Law, or Law of the Sea, and
the other the Law of the Land.

Now if of these two different Elements of Water and Earth, (whereunto I have
resembled the difference between the Traffic and Commerce in Merchandising
affairs by Sea, and the Laws thereunto belonging, and the land Trade and Laws
which concern the same) there should be such an equal mixture, that the same
could neither be said to be water nor earth, but a mixed Body equally composed
of both, then would the same be fit for neither man nor beast to walk or tread
on, nor Ship or other Vessel to float or sail on. In like manner if these Laws
purposely composed for the decision of Maritime controversies, and the Laws
established for determination of land differences should be promiscuously
applied to the decision, or used for the determination of both, and by that
means such a mixture thereof made, that the same could neither be termed the
Laws of the Sea, nor the Laws of the Land, then would the same neither serve
for the Government of the one, nor the other. For although the seafaring
Commerce and land-trade have some resemblance (as I have said) in respect of
the like contracting and bartering; yet are the Goods and Wares so bartered and
contracted for, by way of Merchandising of various sorts, and the lading and
stowing of them in Ships done, or to be done, after many various manners and
ways according to the nature of them, and many differences there are in the
manner of the Master of the Ship, or Skippers acceptance of them, according to
the condition and quality of the Goods so received and acknowledged by his
Bills of lading, and several are the consignments made of them, the same being
sometimes laden by Factours, and consigned to their principals for their own
proper use and account: sometimes for the account of their correspondents, etc.

And likewise much variety and difference is there, in hyring and taking of
Ships, and Vessels to freight for the transportation of such Goods, Wares and
Merchandises; the Merchants having sometimes Ships and Vessels of their own,
which they sometimes freight wholly themselves, sometimes jointly with others:
Sometimes the Merchant hyreth or takes a ship, or Vessel to freight, which
has sometimes but one, sometimes many owners: Sometimes he takes her to
freight of the owner, sometimes of the Master appointed over her by the owners:
Sometimes he hyreth her by the Month, sometimes for a whole voyage; which
voyage is sometimes from one Port unto another, from that to a second, and so
to a third, etc. And sometimes the Ship makes no Port, but is lost, or
perished, sometimes in the high Sea, sometimes in the Port or Haven out of
which she is to set sail, sometime in the Port or Haven of her discharge:
Sometimes She makes one Port, sometimes two, sometimes more, and yet is cast
away before she come to her last Port of discharge; sometimes in the same.

Sometimes such Goods and Merchandises are damnified through the wastfulness of
the Master, sometimes of the Mariners, sometimes through their carelessness in
stowage of them, sometimes by reason of ill packing or making them up, or
putting such as are liquid in ill or leakie Casks, etc.

Sometimes they are damnified by storm or tempest, or stress of weather, which
is sometimes such, as that the Master is constrained to cast over board diverse
of the Goods for preservation of the rest, and saving both ship and men's
lives, and sometimes he is constrained to cut down the masts of his Ship, as
has been Suqr. l. 2.
said before, in this Second Book. Sometimes they are damnified in the lading
of them, sometimes in the unlading of them, sometimes in the Ship, sometimes in
the Lighter, etc. Sometimes they are damnified by one Ship or Vessel falling
fowl on another, and that sometimes by the negligence or carelessness of the
Master or Mariners of either of them, sometimes of both; sometimes of neither,
but through the extremity of the weather, or through the darkness of the
season, happening either by mist, or night, etc. which could not be helped or
prevented by either the care or diligence of the Masters, or their Mariners:
Sometimes the Ship by such means is damnnified only, and not the Goods:
Sometimes the Goods, and not the Ship: Sometimes both Ship and Goods: Sometimes
the like falls out for want of a Pylot: Sometimes through the ignorance and
unskilfulness of such Pylot, etc.

I might here instance in very many more particulars, wherein this Commerce
which consists in shipping and merchandising voyages and affairs does differ
from other trades used and occupied in land business, those being far more
perilous and dangerous then these, and being likewise far more subject to
depredations, Pyratical robberies and spoils then these.

All which differences must needs introduce a Law, for the regulating the
various and diverse controversies that must needs arise by reason thereof, far
different and distinct from that Law, which rules and guides the
determinations of such controversies and debates which happen in land
businesses, not subject to such or the like casualties, dangers and damages,
arising from so diverse, various and different causes, all which do after the
very Judgments and determinations according to their different qualities,
respects and conditions, which Law (as I have said before) for the community of
Traffic and Commerce, and holding correspondency therein, and obtaining the
same Justice by each Nation from other, must continue certain and unalterable,
when as the other may suffer alterations, additions or diminutions.

It remains therefore here to show, that besides the Laws of Oleron, etc. and
the Title ad legem Rhodiam de jactu before mentioned, which is inserted in the
Body of the Civil Law, that there are several other Titles and Laws
incorporated in the same Body proper and peculiar for the Decision and
Determination of Maritime controversies, which are not at all excercised or
used in the Decision of the differences in land businesses, nor any ways proper
for them, although many of the other Titles and Laws which are for land
businesses are made use of in the proceedings, and sometimes in the
determinations of Maritime causes, and that neither those general Laws which
serve for both, nor these particular Laws which serve for marine causes only,
are either abolished, taken from, or disused in the Admiralty Courts in foraign
parts, but that the same are of most especial use in the same.

For proof hereof, I might cite the Disputations, Decisions, Determinations and
Judgments of diverse, and very many, if not of all and all manner of causes,
set forth in several Authors, of several Nations, in several ages and times,
even to this present age, which are all grounded upon the same Laws, and do
cite and quote the same for their their foundation, and proof of what they
conclude and determine, as I have said before. But no man can conceive that
this Collection of so many Causes out of so many several Volumns, could be
contained in one so small as I intended this. And some (and those not a few)
would think it a vain and needless work to jumble so many Authors together, to
no other purpose then to confute so plain an error, as no man that has been
at all verst in the proceedings of foraign judicatures, can be induced to
believe.

I shall therefore instance only in some few particular Writers of these latter
times, of most common use, and most generally known. I shall step no further
back then unto Peckius, sometime Principal of the Juridical Order in the
University of Lovain in France, who collected and gathered together several
titles, by him picked out of the body of the Civil Law, which principally
belonged unto Maritime affairs, and wrote a Comment upon the same, which was
there printed in the year of our Lord God 1556, above a hundred years since,
for the use of such as were employed in the Judicature or practice in the Law
in Admiralty Courts concerning Marine businesses; in which Commentary he does
not only cite diverse other Civil Law Authors, but likewise enforces, extends
and limiteth the understanding and construction that is to be made of the
several Laws, comp^ehended under those several titles, by other particular Laws
set forth under several other titles, within the very body of the Civil Law, as
necessarily he must do, having not taken in all those titles which concern the
business, as himself confesses in the very title of his Book, which he says
is Commentaria in omnes pene Juris Civilis titulos ad rem nauticam pertinentes;
a Commentary upon almost all the Titles of the Civil Law, which concern
Maritime Affairs. But indeed they are not near all, if we consider the diverse
particular Laws which concern the same, and are intermixed with other Laws
under other titles, and some titles he meddleth not with, which wholly concern
such matters, and nothing else; nor does he at all treat upon any other Laws
which concern such affairs, and are made use of in all Admiralty Courts
together with the Civil Law.

Wherefore Vinius a learned Civilian of the Low Countries made an additional
Commentary upon the same titles of the Civil Law, and upon the Commentary of
the said Peckius, and set forth the same, which was printed at Leyden in
Holland, in the year of our Lord God, one thousand six hundred forty seven,
wherein he undertaketh, not only to explicate and unfold those titles of the
Civil Law which principally concern Maritime affairs, as Peckius had done
before, but also to adjoyn thereunto the Laws of Wisbaith, the Laws of Oleron,
the Laws set forth in the Book de Consulatu maris; and likewise the Maritime
Law of the Rhodes, Jus navale Rhodiorum quod ad finem tomi secundi Juris Graeco
Romano relatum est a Marquardo Trahero, V. CL. as he himself says, that his
said Work might be useful to all Nations in their Judgments and Determinations
in all manner of Controversies, and therefore says thus; Cum in animo haberem
locos juris nostri, qui ad rem nauticam pertinent, non explicare tantum, verum
etiam cum generis ejusdem institutis and moribus aliorum populorum confer,
atque ad usum quendam accommodare communem, etc.

Now although that for the due administration of Justice in an Admiralty Court,
the learning in, and knowledge of the Laws in these last mentioned Books be
very requisite, that the same justice which one Nation affords to another,
may be by that other rendered unto that Nation again, and it obtain the same;
yet is the learning and knowledge of the Civil Law, which guides and directs
both the Proceedings and Judgments in all Admiralties of Europe, as necessary,
and far more requisite for him that will justify to any other Nation, or
learned Civilian his due and legal proceedings, and justify his Judgments and
Determinations in Maritime causes, though according to the Laws before
mentioned. For Vinius himself in his Epistle Dedicatory to the Consuls of
Amsterdam to his said Work praefixed, (who I doubt not but (in regard that
(which he then said in the behalf of the Civil Law) he said not to any that I
now write) will be believed before me, that may be thought to speak for my
profession in mine own Country) affirms that Peckius in his work intended to
keep himself within the rules of the Civil or Roman Law; yet he did by that
work show that he wanted not the perfection of Learning, or solid and sound
knowledge of Law, and many other things. Ac for^asse Peckius intra limits
Juris Romani se continere voluit; utcunque sit, ostendit sane hoc in opere
Peckius sibi non defuisse justam eruditionem; solidamque juris and multarum
rerum scientiam. And this I will further add, that he that in the Civil Law
only (and without the learning and knowledge which other Authors afford) has
justam eruditionem, a just, perfect, or grounded learning, or skill; and
thereby this solidam juris and multarum rerum scientiam, this solid and sound
knowledge of the Law, and multiplicity of business, or matters, for which the
same was composed and continued, may be fit to judge and determine of these
Maritime matters and controversies which happen concerning the same, when as he
which has the learning and knowledge of these other Authors only, and has no
perfection in the learning and knowledge of the Civil Law, shall be very
defective in the proceedings to the due or just judgment therein: But herein I
shall plainly agree with this my learned Author Vinius, that these Authors are
of very good use, and may conduce much to the perfection of him that is either
to judge or determine of such Controversies, or shall be practicant in the
same; and likewise in that he further adds in the same place, viz. that
notwithstanding the most perfect knowledge and learning in the Civil Laws, and
these other Maritime Laws, it is sometimes, and in some things requisite to
make use of, and consult with such Merchants and Mariners, as are expert and
skillful in Navagation and Commerce. Equidem inficior in negotiis nauticis
nonnunquam confugiendum esse ad expertes, sive nautas, sive Mercatores, aliosve
hujusmodi peritos. Yet this is by no means used, or ought to be done, but where
some such thing falls out, whereof there is nothing certain set down in the
written Law, or introduced by Custom, so that I with my same Author affirm
the same with that learned Civilian Benveautus Straccha, in these words;
Caeterum nego id fieri solere aut debere, nisi (ut recte monet prudentissimus
Straccha) tale quid occurrat, de quo nihil certi aut scripto jure cautum, aut
con^uetud^ne introductum est.

Now seeing that these Marine controversies and differences are to be adjudged
and determined by these Civil and Maritime Laws, certainly then are none so fit
to hear and decide the same, as those that are well verst and skilled in these
Laws, which necessarily must be such as spend their whole time, pains, and
labor in the study thereof, and by that means do better understand the
diversity of such Laws, and gather more knowledge therein then such as are
daily employed in Foreign affairs, and continually busied in multitudes of
negotiations, which bring home a golden Harvest, which will not be left, or at
any time set apart to give way for the study of those Laws which bring in no
such profit. Such men will rather be found in their Sellars and Warehouses
amongst their rich and precious Commodities, which are to be bartered and sold,
then in Studies amongst mustie Books, that are to be kept and not parted with;
And will rather be seen upon an Exchange, Mart, or Meeting Place of Merchants,
then upon a Bench of Justice: And in this my said Author Vinius agrees with
me, who says, Caetera enim scire possunt etiam qui vitam umbratilem colunt,
and hi si quid literis mandare volunt plura conquirere solent, and curiosius
cuncta rimari quam aut pragmatici qui raro relicta mess aurea, quam assidua
rerum forensium affert tractatio, literarum monumentis unde nullus praeventus
est, student, aut quilibet alii, quos nimia and circumfusa obsidet and opprimit
negotiorum multitudo.

And now since I have thus far deviated and digressed from the way that I was
in, give me leave here (in so necessary a course, or rather discourse) to go a
little further, and afterward get home again as well as I can. Let me show of
what necessary use the Civilian is in these Admiralty Courts, which have the
decision of Maritime Controversies, and how unfit other men not verst or
skilled in that Law are for the undertaking thereof.

I know it will be objected unto me in the first place, that some Admiralties
in foreign parts are regulated and ruled by the Justice and Judicature of
Merchants, and other feafaring men well experienced in matters of that nature.

I must confess I am no Traveller, and that in regard have not been amongst
these Mercatorian and Nauticall Judges; but yet have I in my study traveled
through the decisions and determinations of many foreign Judicatures, and by
that means (I believe) do know their Laws somewhat better then they which have
traveled through those Countries, but not through those Courts.

And I do find that where such Mercatorian and Nautical Judges are, they are
either Civilians themselves, or at least, far better verst in the Civil Law
then any of the Merchants or Mariners of our Nation do seem to be; or else they
are not only assisted, but regulated and ruled by Civilians, and moreover by
certain Letters yet remaining in my Study, which I have (in that short time
that I have been verst in the high Court of Admiralty in England) received from
such foreign Admiralty Courts, and the Copies of Letters which were unto them
returned in answer, and their replies thereunto, I can show, that upon contest
for the right of Jurisdiction in the cognizance of causes, which have happened
between Forraigners and English, whether the Causes were to be decided by their
Court or this, that they have urged and quoted the Civil Law for the foundation
of their Arguments, for their right of Jurisdiction therein, and have received
satisfaction by answers framed out of the same Law unto their said Arguments.

If I should here set forth those Letters and Copies, it would thereby appear,
that the J^risdiction of the Admiralty Court of England has been maintained
and defended by Civilians in an other manner then the same would have been by
such Mercatorian or Nautical Judges, and that the Subject of this Nation
thereby has gained that Justice and Right at home, which might otherwise
perhaps have been hazarded abroad.

But I intend not to stuff or fill up this short Treatise (which I intended
should have been far shorter, when I first took it in hand) with Packets of
Letters received from several Foreign Judicatures, and the answers thereunto
returned, which will hardly, or not at all be understood by such as are not
already convinced of that which they should be here set down to prove.

Nor will I here set forth how far those Mercatorian Courts (though assisted
by Civilians through their over-powering of their said Assistants) have fallen
short of those which have been and are wholly regulated and governed by
Civilians, as well in point of proceedings, as in point of the distribution of
Justice.

But I will here take occasion to set forth some inconveniences not a little
destructive only to Trade, Traffic and Commerce, and so to the Merchant
himself; but also to Shipping and Navigation it self, which might, and
doubtless would happen, if the dicision and determination of Maritime Causes
should be left unto, or settled upon Merchants and Owners of Ships to judge
according to their own skill and observations, without that Jus scriptum, that
written Law which passes, is allowed and practiced in all Admiralties of
Europe, wherein they cannot be so well verst, as those who have spent their
whole time in that study of such matters as much conduce to the knowledge
thereof.

I shall but once again put you in mind of what has been already said
concerning the necessity of upholding one and the same Law in all Nations in
Maritime Causes, for one Nation's rendering of the same Justice to another that
it does from thence receive, which is the chiefest thing that maintains the
Community of Traffic and Commerce, which cannot possibly be done, if the same
should be rendered, by the various fancies of men, in no wise guided by any
certain form or rule, but by that thing (then which nothing can be more
uncertain) which men call opinion; tot capita, tot sententiae.

And then I will further say, that for the reason before set down in this
Chapter, the Mariner who comes in with one good wind, and goes out with
another, and must opportune vela ventis applicare, upon any controversy or
difference arising upon or about the payment of his wages, cannot have so
sudden and quick dispatch or determination thereof by such Mercatorian or
Nauticall Judges, who have other affairs and businessss to attend, as by those
who make the decision and determination of Maritime Causes their whole work,
and attend wholly upon the same every day of the week, both Term and Vacation.

Again, it is considerable what justice the poor Mariner could expect, or
should be like to have, if the determination and adjudication of their wages
should be left unto Merchants and Owners of Ships (as some men would have it)
out of whose freight the same ought to be paid, and would be as it were parties
in all Causes of that nature; and if the Cause should not at one time be their
own, yet must it, and would it assuredly be at another; and so at all times
would it be their own case, though not their own cause: and very seldom would
it be, that it should not be their own cause, there being so many Merchants
that are Owners of Ships, and so many Owners of every Ship of any burden
considerable; and every Part-owner of one Ship for the most part, Owner or
Part-owner of more, if not of very many; so that for the most part, some or
other of the Judges themselves would be absolutely concerned in the matter of
difference depending before them, and the poor Mariner left to their good will
and pleasure for his wages and recompense for his pains impended, and his time
spent in their service, which would be a means to dishearten and discourage all
Mariners for serving in English Bottoms, whenever employment should be
offered them elsewhere.

Again, in the commixture and joint Trade of Merchants one with another, having
their accomplices and copartners in all or most of their trading and
merchandising affairs, and such their trading and dealing each for other, and
in each others name, that it might, and oftentimes would fall out, that when a
man conceived that he had commenced a Suit against his adversary, and whom he
had dealt and traded with, he should in conclusion find that he had commenced
the same against one or more of his Judges, that were to judge and determine
his Cause, or rather the same might fall out so to be, and not be at all
discovered.

Much more I could say to this purpose, but I hasten to return to that which I
principally intended to set forth in this Chapter, namely to show by some few
Authors of very many, that much of the Civil Law it self is of use, and in
force in all Admiralty Courts, as well as any other Maritime Laws.

And as I last instanced in Vinius, I shall in the next place instance in the
Authors by him mentioned, namely Benvenutus Straccha, who writes de mercatura
sive mercatore, de contractibus mercatorum, de mandatis, de sponsionibus, de
nautis, navibus and navigatione, de navibus iterum, iterumque de navigatione,
de conturbatoribus, sive decoctoribus, quomodo in causis mercatorum procedendum
sit, and de adjecto: Of Merchandises and Merchants, and of their Contracts,
Mandates, Warrants and Bargains, or promises of Mariners, Ships, and Navigation
jointly, of Ships severally, and of Navigation by it self, of Bankrupts, and
failing Merchants, in what manner Merchants Causes are to be proceeded in, and
of Factors or Substitutes, etc. which Book was printed and set forth within
this last Century of years. And I do earnestly desire those that hold the Civil
Law useless in these affairs, and in the Courts designed for determination of
differences happening therein, but to look into the before mentioned Book,
together with Grotius de jure Belli and Pacis, Gentilis and Loccenius, who are
latter Writers, being all easily to be had, and they shall find the very Text
of the Civil Law, and Commentators thereon, not only out of these before
mentioned selected Titles, but out of diverse others, cited and quoted for
authority in all the several points the said Authors do handle or treat of,
which I hope will be sufficient to convince any judicious man, and sufficiently
persuade him that the Civil Law it self is of most exquisite use in all
Admiralty Courts.

CHAP. XVI.
That by several of the Laws of the Titles selected out of the body of the
Civil Law by Peckius for the determination of Maritime Causes, and diverse other
of the Civil Laws conducing thereunto, it does appear that the Ports and
Havens, and businesses done thereupon, are within the Cognizance of the
Admiralty Jurisdiction.
HAving now made it appear that there have been several Titles selected and
gathered out of the body of the Civil Law for the dicision and determination of
Maritime Causes, and the same then, and since very lately commented on for the
better understanding thereof, and the more perfect knowledge therein; now it
will remain to show that by these Laws, and diverse others of the Civil Laws
mentioned in the foregoing Chapters of this Book, it will plainly appear, that
the Ports and Havens, and all things had, done, or agitated thereon are within
the power and cognizance of the Admiralty Jurisdiction.

And the first of those Titles, so far forth as it concerns the Admiralty
is, Nautae, F. tit. 9. lib. 4.
Caupones, etc. ut recepta restituant. And this Title consists of several
Laws, whereby Masters of Ships, Mariners, etc. are compellable to restore such
Goods, Wares, and Merchandises as they shall have received aboard their Ships.

Now if the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty Courts had been restrained unto the
high Seas, where Masters of Ships and Mariners seldom or never receive in, or
deliver out their Merchants goods, but upon some mere accidental occasion; and
had had no cognizance of Causes happening and falling out upon the Ports and
Havens, where usually they receive them in, and deliver them out; then
certainly little reason had Peckius had to have made this Title to have been
the first of those select Titles he gathered out of the body of the Civil Law,
for the decision of Marine Causes, which belong to the Admiralty Courts; and as
little reason had Vinius had to have added so lately his additional Notes
thereunto for that purpose.

The next Title so collected, is F. lib. 14. tit. 1.
de Exercitoria action, which concerns Contracts, and is to be made use of
in its place.

The next is the Title F. lib. 14. tit. 2.
ad legem Rhodiam de jactu, which I have already instanced in to this purpose
in the 9th, 10th, and 14th Chapter of this Sup. lib. 2. cap. 9, 10, 14.
second Book, and therefore shall pass it over in this place.

The next to this is the Title F. lib. 47. tit 9.
de incendio, ruina, naufragio, rate nave expugnata, of and concerning burning,
destruction, and ruin of things, ship-wrecks, robbing or spoiling of Ships.
Now as under the first of these Titles, Caupones and Stabularii, Victuallers
and Inholders were comprehended as well as Nautae, Mariners; and yet is it by
Peckius collected and commented on only for so much as concerned Marine and
Nautical Affairs, fit and proper for Admiralty Courts, who says that it is his
purpose and intent in his Comment to explain those Laws only that belong
thereunto, and says that the other are but things which have some affinity
with, or likeness unto the other, or are things handled by such as handle
things of another nature, which he expresses in these words; Contestatum ante
omnia haec volo te, Lector, non expositurum me hoc titulo, nisi eas leges quae
ad rem nauticam pertinent; illud enim nostri est instituti, caetera vel adfinia
sunt, vel ab aliis utcunque suis locis Peckius in pr^^cipio super dicto tit.
examinata. So under this Title, although burning, ruin, and destruction of
things at land be comprehended as well as shipwreck, etc. yet does Peckius his
Comment extend only unto those Laws therein which concern Maritime affairs.

Now these Laws which concern offenses committed in case of shipwreck and
robbing, and dispoiling of Ships, or other Vessels comprehended under this
Title, do indistinctly handle the same, whether they happen to be done upon the
high Sea, or upon any Port, Creek, or Haven, (where most of these things most
commonly happen) as by the particular Laws themselves it does manifestly appear.

This Title sets forth how, and in what manner such persons shall be
punished, which (when any Ship, or other Vessel (not being a derelict) shall be
wrecked, stranded, or otherwise distressed, by robbery, opposition, quarrel,
spoil, or F. lib 4^. tit. 9. l. 1. l. etiam 3. (...) Prator.
otherwise) with a deceiptfull intention, to steal, take, carry away, receive,
or damnifie Leg. eadem. non tantum.
any of the Goods, Wares, Merchandises, Tackle, Furniture, Ammunition,
Provision, etc. belonging thereunto, though the same were cast out of the L.
eadem. non solum.
Ship, and that indistinctly, whether the said misfortune happened, either upon
the high Seas, or upon the Ports, Havens, Creeks, or Coasts of the Sea, where
Ships and other Vessels do ride, lie at Anchor, or have their station; and
indeed more proper is this Law for the Ports, Havens, Creeks and Coasts of the
Sea, then for the high Seas, it rarely or never falling out, that any persons
are present to steal, take, carry away, damnifie, conceal, or imbezle any of
the goods belonging to any Ship or Vessel which shall be there wrecked, nor the
goods belonging to any Ship that shall be there robbed, or in fight with an
Enemy, but such as are either the Pirates or Enemies themselves, neither of
which fall under the Judgment of this Law, the one falling under that Judgment
which is proper to Pirates, the other under that which is proper to an Enemy;
and this being not appointed for the punishment of such as are either the
Robbers, Pirates, or Enemies, which set upon the Ship, but of such as take the
advantage whilst such strife and contestation is; or when any wreck does
happen, and when the Master and Mariners are in a distraction, do take away the
Goods belonging unto their Ship, which must needs most commonly fall out, when
any such Ship or Vessel shall happen to be so wrecked, robbed, or dispoiled in
a Port, Haven, Creek, or Coast of the Sea, where the Shore is near, and the
Goods are either cast upon the same, driven thereto, or with Boats, Engines, or
other Instruments fetched or brought thereon.

And by the two next Laws it more plainly appears, that this Title
principally aims at such as shall offend in this manner, when a Ship is in
her Port or Haven, or upon any Creek or Coast of the Sea, and there does suffer
any such distress, or any such sad accident does befall: for that those Laws
take care as well for the punishing such as shall take away any of the Goods
from off the Shore, which shall be cast or driven thereon, as the punishment of
those that shall take them out of the Ship it self. Item ait Praetor. Si quid
ex naufragio, hic illud quaeritur utrum si quis eo tempore tulerit, quo
naufragium fit, an vero etiam si alio tempore, hoc est, post naufragium: Nam
res ex naufragio etiam hae dicuntur, quae in littore post naufragium jacent,
and magis est ut eo tempore (...). de incend. ruin. nauf. l Praetor ait. Sect.
Item Praetor ait: and l. siquis 5. Sect. ^acentem.
.

And the Third Law runs in these words. Qui autem in littore rem jacentem
postea quam naufragium factum est abstulerit, in ea condition est, ut magis
fur sit, quam hoc edicto teneatur, quemadmodum is qui quod de vehiculo
exciderit, tulit Eod. l. quo naufragium in prin.
. And many things more of the same nature are comprehended under the several
paragraphes of this Law.

And these distresses happening at high Sea, there is little help to be
expected from any at land, in gathering and preserving the Goods like to be
lost; but by this Title encouragement is given to such as shall help in this
kind. Plurimum interest peritura collegerint, an quae servari possint
invaserint ^od. l. Pedius. Sect. Divus Antonius.
.

And the Seventh Law plainly forbids such as dwell upon or near the shore,
to take away such Goods so wrecked, though stranded, broken, or cast upon
ground, within the confines of any man's ground. Nam and Divus Adrianus edicto
praecepit, ut hi qui juxta littora maris possiderent, scirent siquando navi vel
infixa vel fracta intra fines agri cujusque ne naufragia deripiant etc. Eod. l.
Ne quid. 7.
. Yet to make the matter more clear that these Laws were collected out of the
body of the Civil Law, as well to direct the Judgments of Maritime Judges upon
those offenses and trespasses committed upon the Ports, Havens, Creeks and
Coasts of the Seas, as upon the high Seas, I shall instance in an Authentic,
by the same Author collected out of the same Law, and by him likewise commented
on, wherein it is expressly set forth that Ships and Vessels of what kind
soever, useful for marine businesses (for so much the word mavigia does
import) in what place they shall come, which must needs be Ports, Havens and
Creeks of the Sea, as well as the high Sea, if by any contingent accident they
shall be broken, or otherwise come on ground, as well the Ships as the Goods of
the Sailors and adventurers therein shall be preserved whole and entire unto
those unto whom they belonged before such Ships or Vessels fell upon the said
danger, the Custom of all places whatsoever contrary to this Sanction being
altogether to be set aside, unless they be the Ships of Pirates or enemies.
These are the words of the Authentic.

Navigia quocunque locorum provenerint, siquo casu contingente rupta fuerint,
vel alias ad terram pervenerint, tam ipsa navigia quam navigantium bona ipsis
integra reserventur ad quos spectabant antequam navigia hujusmodi periculum
incurrissent, sublata penitus omnium locorum consuetudine, quae huic adversatur
sanctioni, nisi talia sint Navigia quae pyraticam exercent pravitatem, sive
nobis sive Christiano nomini inimica Authr. Navigia, and de Furtis.
.

Before I pass any further, I must needs here observe the same thing that
Peckius has observed upon these words of this Law, Sublata penitus omnium
locorum consuetudine, etc. viz. Illud sane sine ulla dubitatione dici potest
quod certum sit consuetudinem contra jus naturae nullam habere potestatem
Peckius super (...).
. That it may without any doubt be said, that it is certain that a custom
against the Law of nature has no power or efficacy. And further he says, in
casu constitutionis nostrae omnium consensus operari quicquam non potest cum
divinis naturaeque praeceptis consuetudo ejusmodi repugnare videatur Peck. Ibid.
.

In this case the consent of all men can work nothing, because such a custom
may be discerned to be repugnant both to the divine and natural Precepts; and
herewith does Vinius learnedly concur and much blames such as have suffered
any such custom.

And with this Law agrees the very first Law of another Title, to the same
purpose with this collected by the same Author in these words: Si quando
naufragio navis expulsa fuerit ad littus, vel siquando aliquam terram attigerit
ad dominos pertineat, fiscus meus sese non interponat, quod enim jus habet
fiscus meus in aliena calamitate ut de re tam luctuosa compendium sectetur L.
11. and (...) naufragiis. tit. 5. l. siquando 1.
Whenever a Ship by wreck shall be driven upon the shore, or whenever she
shall be run upon any ground, i.e. either in Port, Haven or elsewhere, she
shall belong unto her owners; my Exchequer or receipt shall not intermeddle
therewith: for what right has my Exchequer, that it should require or seek for
any small matter or trifle in so mournful or sad matter or condition?

I must confess that by this last observation, I have made some digression from
my intended purpose; Yet have I not gone much out of my way, nor far about to
discover what a Rock we of this Nation (who pretend not only many Customs, but
enforce several Patents and Grants, howsoever obtained, clean contrary to this
Law) are like to fall upon, and what a wreck we are like to make of our
Maritime Law, whereby we uphold all our Trade, Traffic and Commerce with other
Nations, by falling upon this Error, so strongly maintained by Sir Edward
Coke, that the Ports and Havens are not within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty Court, where as this Law is universally practiced in all parts of the
World.

For although by this Law, and the Inquisition taken at Quinborow in the end of
Edward the 3ds. reign, and by the Inquisition translated into Latin out of an
ancient French Copy by Roughton, upon any wreck, stranding, or running on
ground of any Ship or Vessel whatsoever, or wheresoever the owners are to have
their Ship or Vessel, or such part thereof, such tackle and furniture thereof,
and all such Goods as are saved and can be found out, entirely restored unto
them: Instead hereof many Lords of Manors, who perhaps had some right of claim
to all, or some part of Pirates or enemies Goods so wrecked, as the best Anchor
and Cable, etc. where the rest of the Goods belonged or were confiscable either
to the Lord high Admiral, or supreme Authority (as in some cases they are to
the one, in some to the other) will (as I do already find) even out of the
Ships and Goods both of those of our own Nation, and of our friends, and those
that hold good correspondencie, and are in amity with us, under a pretended
custom contrary to all Law, claim and have the same in the like manner, and
other customs likewise, which are as contrary to the law of Nature, as this.

And not only so but many even of our own Nation and others of other Nations,
who neither are Pirates, nor enemies to this Nation, but in amity and friendship
therewith, may have their Ships stranded or wrecked and cast away, and have
their Goods even snatched from them by force, and violence, and carried away,
and detained by such as can have nether pretense nor color for such unjust and
inhumane dealing, contrary to the law of Nature, and Nations, and that Law
which is elsewhere universally practiced, if the current stream of Justice of
the Admiralty Court, in these Ports, Havens, Creeks and Coasts of the Seas
shall be interrupted and stopped, under this pretense, of having no Power or
Jurisdiction over them.

Which pressures in such extreamities, if they shall fall upon those of our own
Nation, we shall seem even to devour and eat up one another; If they shall fall
upon Forraigners, that are in league, and amity with us, this breach of a Law
so general may be a cause of the breach of such league, and amity, or at least
of the begetting of Letters of Reprizal, on their part against our Merchants,
and owners of Ships, which is Prima species belli; by which way of their
reparation, the Subjects of this Nation are like to pay at least three fold for
the damage done, by such wicked and mischievous people, and not by themselves.

But here an Objection Object. e^ stat. 15. Rich. 2. cap. 3.
will arise, viz. that by the express words of a Statute of the Land, made in
the 15th year of the reign of Richard the 2. the Admiral is to have no
Cognizance, Power, nor Jurisdiction of wreck of the Sea.

To which I answer, that by wreck of the Sea, in this Statute mentioned, is, as
I conceive, and under correction, only meant and intended such things as are
cast out of the bowels of the Sea, and by the waves thereof driven on shore,
and upon the reflux thereof, left upon the Land, wherein no man has any
property, or to which, no man can make any claim; this is properly called wreck
of the Sea, which belongs properly to the King, and by his grant unto the
Lord High Admiral: But in case any Ship, or other Vessel, shall be wrecked at
Sea, or in any Port, Haven, or Creek, or upon or near any Coast, neither the
Ship nor Vessel, nor any of the Goods thereunto belonging, howsoever found
therein, or found floating upon the water, or driven on shore, or dry land, are
wreck of Sea, though the Ship be usually said to be a Ship wrecked, and the
Goods said to be wreck, but indeed are bona sparsa ex naufragio; Goods
scattered and thrown over board, through ship-wreck, or fear or danger of
ship-wreck, wherein the owners of them have a just property, and may make their
claim thereunto at any time within a year and a day, and ought to recover and
have the same again, by the Laws of the Sea; and therefore has that Law
exactly set forth, how, and in what manner, such as shall either by violence, or
by stealth, or howsoever take, and carry away, or conceal any such Goods, from
the lawful owner, and proprietor thereof, ought to be punished, and make
satisfaction for such their offense committed against the Law Supra cap. hoc
hujus lib. 1.
.

And as that Law does distinguish those things, which be ex naufragio, from
wreck of the Sea, as plainly it does; so does it distinguish the offense of
taking away such Goods, at the very time of the shipwreck, from the offense in
some time after the same, as is plain by the Laws, before quoted in this
Chapter F. de incend. ruin. naufr. l. Praetor ait Sect. (...). Praetor ait, and
l. Siquis 5. Jacentem and. l. quo naufr. prin.
.

But since the making of this Statute, in regard of the differences which did
arise, and which did grow about such Goods, whether the same were wreck of Sea,
which belonged unto the King, or derelicts, Ships or Goods forsaken, and given
over for lost: or Flotson, that which after a wreck, was found floating upon
the water, and by no man claimed: or Jetson, that which was thrown over board
to disburden and lighten the Ship, for preservation thereof, and of men's lives,
and the rest of the Goods: or Lagon, that which was found in the bottom of the
Sea, or any great river beneth the first bridges, within the low water mark,
all which belonged to the Kings of England, who have usually granted the same
which belonged unto themselves, unto the said Lords Admirals, amongst the other
things before mentioned (as doubtless they may do, the same being confirmed
unto themselves by the Statute, and unto their own use) and the said Admirals
have constantly had the same, and the benefit thereof.

Another Title there is amongst the said collected Titles de Naviculariis seu
naucleris, by the Laws whereof it does likewise appear that the Admiral has
Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens. The first of them says thus: Nullam C.
li. tit. 1. de nav cular^is seu naucleris publicas species transportantibus l.

vim oportet naucleros sustinere delegatas species annonarias transferentes,
nec concussiones, nec aliquod genus incommodi; sed venientes ac remeantes omni
securitate potiri, december librarum auri mulcta proponenda his qui eos inquietare
tentaverint: No force or violence, or any manner of disturbance or hinderance
shall be offered unto the Masters of Ships, or Mariners, which are appointed by
their Prince, to transport any Goods or Commodities for the public use or
benefit, under the pain of ten pounds, to be imposed upon such as shall
adventure to molest or disquiet them. Now I hope no man will say that this
extends not to such force, violence, or molestation, as shall be offered unto
them upon any Port or Haven, either before their setting sail to sea, or in any
Port or Haven of their discharge, or in any Port or Haven they shall by storm
or stresse of weather be driven into. And this Privilege, says Peckius, is no
small benefit unto them; for they can neither be arrested, nor deteyned, nor
compelled to pay any Custom or Tribute: Quod privilegium, quae praerogativa,
utilitas meherule modica non est; etenim nec arestari (ut dicunt) nec detineri,
nec ad vectigalium solutionem compelli possunt, which certainly shows that
this Law extends to the Ports and Havens upon which all Arrests of Ships, or
other Vessels, or Mariners are for the most part made, and all compulsion to
the payment of Tribute or Custom used or exercised.

If this be not enough, take the last Law of the same Title, and Peckius
thereupon, in these words: Judices qui onusta navigia cum prosperior flatus
invitat, sub praetextu hyemis immorari permiserint, una cum municipibus and
corporatis ejusdem loci fortunarum propriarum feriantur dispendiis, naucleri
praeterea ^od. l. fin. Judice^ qui.

revelatum: Such Judges as shall permit or suffer such Ships or Vessels so laden
with Commodities for the public use and service of the Commonwealth, having
a good wind, to stay or demore in any Port or Haven under the pretense of
Winter, shall together with the Burgers, or chief of that place, bear or pay
the loss or damage thereby sustained: And the Masters of those Ships which
shall be found guilty of such offense, or fraudulent in that way, are to be
punished with banishment. Now no man will doubt but that this stay or demorage,
which is thus strictly to be looked after by the Admiralty Judge under such a
pain or penalty, and so severely to be by him punished, is such stay or
demorage, as is made in the Port or Haven, and not upon the high Seas. And
Peckius says in express words, if they shall stay or demore in the Port or
Stations for Ships at such time, it is the office of the Judges by all ways or
means to drive them out, or compel them to go on upon that Voyage they are
designed. Quinimo si tempore ad navigandum idoneo, suspensa navigatione, in
portu stationibusve haererent, Peckius super ead. leg.
Judicis erit officium omnibus modis eos abigere.

And by the same Law all Ships and Vessels of what nature, condition, or
quality soever they be, and whosoever they be, may be by the power and
authority of the Admitalty seized on in any Port or Haven where they ride, and
be F. de. navibus non excusandis. C. li. 11. tit. 3. and Peck. ibidem.
taken and employed upon any service of the King, and are not to be excused.

One Title more of the Civil Law I shall instance in, which treats of things
done upon the Ports and Havens, and then return to some other Arguments out of
our own Presidents at home; and that is the Title of the Digests, Nequid F. ne
quid. fiat in stum. publ. l. 1. in. prin.
in flumine publico, etc. where the Praetor does interdict, Nequid in flumine
publico, ripave ejus facias, nequid in flumine publico, ripave ejus emittas,
quo statio, iterve navigio deterius sit, fiat.

The Praetor forbids any thing to be done, or to be cast forth into a
public River, or upon the banks thereof, which may either hinder the lying or
riding of Ships there: and this Edict extends directly to Rivers navigable,
and none other, which are the Ports and Havens, and those other parts of the
same River through which Ships and other Vessels do sail to the place of their
station or anchorage. Hoc F. ne quia in stum. publ. l. 1. in prin.
interdictum ad ea tantum flumina publica pertinet, quae sunt navigabilia, ad
caetera non pertinet. Nor does the Praetor here forbid any public lawful use
of these public Streams, Ports, or Havens; but takes a special care, that
nothing therein shall be done which may deteriorate or hinder the safe and
quiet passage, anchorage, and lying of Ships there. Non autem omni quod in
flumine publico, ripave fit, ^od. l. (...) and ^^d.
coercet Praetor; sed si quid fiat quo deterior statio and navigatio fiat; and
the same Law sets forth what is accounted to be a deteriorating or making
worse of the said station, anchorage, riding, or sailing of Ships: Deterior
statio, item iter navigio fieri videtur, si usus ejus corrumpatur, vel
difficilior fiat, aut minor vel rarior; aut si in totum auferatur; proinde sive
derivetur aqua ut exiguior facta, minus sit navigabilis, vel si dilatetur aut
diffusa brevem aquam faciat, vel contra Eod. l. ead. and 5. 15.
sic coangustetur ut rapidius flumen faciat; vel si quid aliud fiat, quod
navigationem incommodet, difficiliorem faciat, vel prorsus impediat, interdicto
locus erit. The Station or Anchorage, and also the passage for Ships does seem
to be deteriorated, and made worse, if the use thereof be corrupted, or made
more difficult, less, or more shallow, and more seldom to be used, or shall be
wholly taken away. Further, or if the water shall be from thence drawn, and so
be made less, and so less navigagable; or if the banks shall be taken away, and
the River thereby made wider, and caused to spread it self more in breadth,
whereby the water comes to be made more shallow: or on the contrary, if it
shall be encroached on, and so straightened, that the River passes with more
strength or violence; or if any thing else be done which may disaccommodate
Navigation, or make the same more difficult, or altogether hinder it, this
Edict shall take place against the same.

From which Law many Articles of the Inquisition taken at Quinborow, and of the
ancient French Articles, translated into Latin by Roughton, set forth to be
inquirable in the Admiralty, are plainly derived: which Articles, and likewise
many Statutes which forbid the same offenses, were enacted to make the same
more notorious to the people, and are only in pursuance of this Law, which is
the fountain from whence they flow, as their original.

Now lest some should still strive against the stream, and offer to contend,
that this Edict of Nequid in flumine fiat, etc. that nothing shall be done in
any navigable River, or the Banks thereof, which may hinder Navigation, or the
station or anchorage of Ships, is meant only of the River which leads to the
Port or Haven of discharge, wherein Ships do oftentimes lie at Anchor before
they can come further up to be discharged in the Port. I shall further clear
this point by the Interdict mentioned by Labeo in the 17th Section of the same
Law, where the very word Port is used: Nequid in Eod. l. ead.. 17.
mare, inve littore, quo portus, statio, iterve navigio deterius fiat.

After all this perhaps some may lauch further out into the deep, and say that
although these Laws collected out of the Civil Law, are made use of in Maritime
affairs beyond the Seas, and do argue their Admiralties to have jurisdiction
upon their Ports and Havens, yet are they of no use here, for the Admiralty of
England is by the Common Law of England more restrained, and extends not unto
the Ports, nor has so large a power as foreign Admiralties have.

Since so many Nations as are named in the Libel subsequent unto the last
Chapter of the first Book of this Maritime Dicaeologie, have by the same so
fully acknowledged the Regimen, Government, and Jurisdiction over the narrow
Seas to belong to to the Admiralty of England, and no other Admiralty, as is
plainly in the same set forth. Let none of this Nation for shame say that the
power and authority of this Court, which extends as far, and further then
the power of any other Admiralty Courts does, shall be nothing at or near home.
Nor let it for shame be said that our Admiralty, to which they have not only
ascribed, but prescribed from so ancient antiquity, such superiority, shall not
afford unto Foreigners the same Justice other foreign Admiralties afford unto
this Nation.

But for further satisfaction to such as will be further curious, I shall
proceed to make further proof of this point by Presidents out of our own Courts
at home.

CHAP. XVII.
That by the Records of the Admiralty, it appears that the Admiral had, and
has power and jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens.
THe Statute of the 28th of Hen. 8. cap. 15. 28 H. 8. 15.
directs that the trial of Traitors, Pirates, Thieves, Robbers, Murderers and
Confederaters upon the Sea, or in any Haven, River, Creek, or other place,
where the Admiral or Admirals have, or pretend to have Power, Authority, or
Jurisdiction, may by virtue of a Commission under the Great Seal, directed unto
the said Admiral or Admirals, his or their Lieutenant or Lieutenants, and three
or four substantial persons, be made and done according to the Common course of
the Laws of the Land* but takes not away the Admirals power of trial of the
same offenses, by the course of the Civil Law, as had been formerly used; but
leaves him to proceed in causes of that nature either way, as the proof the
fact may be most fitly had, or made. And this Statute is so far from limiting
or taking away any of that power or jurisdiction he had before upon the Ports,
Havens and Creeks of the Sea, and other places, that in express words it
confirms same, and further extends his power, unto a twofold manner of
trial of such offenses committed within the same limits, that to his
Jurisdiction formerly belonged, to make use of each, as he should see cause.

And the Cognizance and trial of all offenses of this nature, whether committed
upon the high Seas, or upon the Ports, Havens, or Creeks of the Sea, and
whether proceeded against by the course of the Civil Law, or the course of the
Common Law, has belonged unto the Admiral, or Admirals, and his or their
Lieutenant or Lieutenants, Judge or Judges of the high Court of the Admiralty,
or Judges of Vice-Admiralties, and has been by them constantly and continually
practiced and used.

I might here lead you into a labyrinth and so involve both my self and you, in
such a vast thicket of heaps of ancient Records which remain in the Registries
of our Admiralty, which plainly set forth this constand and continued Power and
Jurisdiction of the Admiral upon the Ports, and Havens, that we should in no
short time, nor with little labor get out again.

If I should here go on, where I left in the first Book of this Treatise, and
endeavor to give you a view, but of the Patents only, which several Admirals
of England have since Edward the thirds time had (they having from time to time
had more plain and clear expressions of the Admirals Right, Power, Authority
and Jurisdiction, they having by that means grown very large) I should too much
swell this small Treatise in proving that which will be by far shorter
Records more briefly, and yet plainly enough made to appear.

Therefore to spare mine own labor in writing and transcribing these Patents,
and yours in reading them, I shall pitch upon some few other of the shortest
Records only of one year amongst above a hundred, since the making of the said
Statute, and that shall be the eight and twentieth year of Queen Elizabeth's
Reign, at which time all the Judicatories of this Nation were in as good
perfection and absolute luster and splendour for due observation of their just
rights and privileges, as at any other time whatsoever.

In the 28th. year of Queen Elizabeth against the Sessions to be held for the
Admiralty by virtue of a Commission grounded upon the said Statute of Henry the
eighth several precepts or mandats issued out of the Admiralty Court unto
several persons for the summoning and returning of Juries for the enquiry and
trial of all such offenses as are mentioned in the said Statute, whether
committed upon the Sea, or upon the River of Thames below London bridge toward
the Sea, or upon the Seashore, wheresoever, within the Maritime Jurisdiction,
and Limits of the Admiralty of England, or elsewhere, in or upon public
Rivers, Ports, Creeks, or places overflowed by the Sea. I shall here set down a
Copy of one of them only which bears date in the Month of Feb. in the same
year.

And the like Warrants or Precepts were at the same time directed unto the
Bailiffs of the Liberty of the City of London, Rot. Admir. an. 28. Eliz. m. 32.
in the Burrogh of Southwark, and likewise unto the Bailiff of Southwark.

Another Warrant was likewise directed unto Jasper Swift, Rot. Admir. an. eod.
the then Marshall of the Admiralty, that he should have Richard Jones, Osmund
Spark, John Barnard, Humphrey Hood, and Thomas Seal, committed for Pyracies
and Felonies by them done upon the Sea, and upon the River of Thames below
Bridge, toward the Sea, before the said Courts in these words.

Carolus Domminus Howard, Rot. Admir. an. 28. El. m. 29.
etc. ut in superdicto praecepto Jaspero Swift curiae Admirallitatis Angliae

detent. and existent. nuper de pyratiis and feloniis per ipsos super mare and
rivum Thamiseos infra pontem, etc. coram, etc. habeas, etc.

And there being then diverse other Pirates, and other offenders in the
Marshalsey, another Warrant was directed unto the Knight Marshal Keeper of that
Prison to have all and singular the Pirates and other offenders before the said
Court, which Warrant likewise ran in the manner of the former; Rot. Admir. an.
28. El. m. 33.
viz. Carolus Howard, etc. tibi praecipimus quod tertio die October. etc. coram,
etc. omnes and singulos pyratas, etc. habeas, etc.

And upon return of the said Warrants, several Indictments were preferred
against several persons, for several pyracies and other offenses committed upon
the River of Thames, below the bridge, besides such Indictments as were
preferred against Pirates and Robbers upon other navigable Rivers, and at high
Sea.

One against Conray Bows for that upon the 20th. of February, he, with a
certain Wherry, upon the River of Thames, within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, did enter upon and into a certain Lighter, lying over against
Debtford, etc. upon the same, etc. did, etc.

Inquiratur pro Dom. Regina si Conraye Bows nuper Grenwici in Comitatu Kantiae

and asportavit contra pacem supradictae Dom. nostrae Reginae nunc coronam and
dignitatem suas, ac contra formam diversorum statutorum hujus regni Angliae in
contrariam editorum and praevisorum. Billa vera.

And one John Barret, etc. was at the same time likewise indicted for that upon
the first of March, in the same year, out of a certain Hoy, called the Peter of
Feversham, upon the public River of Thames, over against Cox-key within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, riding at Anchor, did pyratically and
feloniously take and carry away one piece of Linen Cloth called Lockeram
containing, etc. together with diverse other particulars set forrh in the said
Indictment, which runs after the same manner with the former: Inquiratur pro
Domina Regina etc. si Johannes Barret, etc. Billa vera.

And another against John Clements, ^od. an. m. 1^. m 13.
Inquiratur si Johannes Clements, etc. Billa vera.

Another there was against Winterhey, Bridges, Black, Albons, Saltash, and
others, that they with two Boats upon the River of Thames within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, did by force of arms set upon a Ship called the
Richard of Dartmouth near Woolwitch, etc. and boarded her, and entered into
her; and one John Terry the Master and owner of her, did beat and evil entreat,
etc. and that one Ralph Williams did with a sword of the price of five
shillings, then and there feloniously and violently strike him the said John
Terry upon the arm, and upon the thigh, and gave him mortal wounds, whereof the
said Terry, at the same time, then and there died; And that the said Winterhey,
Bridges, Black, Albons, Saltash, etc. were then and there present, aiding and
assisting, encouraging and abetting in, and unto the said act, etc. The words
of the Indictment in brief are these.

Inquiratur, Rot. Admir. an. 28. El. m. 24.
etc. si Willielmus Winterhey, nuper de etc. Rogerus Bridges nuper de, etc.
Thomas Black, nuper de, etc. Rogerus Albons, Willelmus Saltash and alii in

navis, etc. insult. etc. ac Radulphus Williams ipsum Johannem Terry cum quodam
gladio precii 5 s. super brachio and in femore felonice and violenter tunc and
ibidem percussit, ac lethalia vulnera ei intulit, and praedicti Willielmus
Winterhey, Thomas Bridges, Thomas Black, Roger Albons, Willielmus Saltash, etc.
tunc, and ibidem fuerunt praesentes cum praefato Radulpho Williams, etc. ipsum,
etc. de quibus lethalibus vulneribus praefatus Johannes Terry tunc and ibidem
instanter obiit, and sic, etc. Billa vera.

Another against Richard Jones, ^ot. Admir. an. 28. El. m. 21.
Valentine Luyson, and others for entering into a Ship, over against Blackwall,
beating the Master, and taking away Cheese, Butter, etc. which was found. Billa
vera.

Another against Bernard Hood, Rot. Admir. an. 21. El. m. 25.
Goodwin, Hussy, and others for the like, in a Ship upon the River of Thames,
over against Erith, which was likewise found. Billa vera.

And these are Indictments preferred and found against Pirates and Pyracies, or
Sea Robberies, committed upon several parts of the River of Thames only; and
that but within but a part of that 28th. year of Queen Eliz.

If I should step into the year either before, or after, and either proceed
forwards, or return backwards, I might fill a Volumn with Warrants or Precepts
of the same kind, with the before recited, and with Indictments for offenses of
this nature, committed upon this very River of Thames; yet are there (besides
the Indictments for Pyracies, etc. at Sea) several other Indictments for
Pyracies, and other offenses of this nature committed upon other great Rivers,
beneath the first Bridges, nearest the Sea, as well as upon this; And to show
the extent of the high Court of the Admiralty unto all Ports, and great Rivers
whereso ever, as well as unto the Sea, I shall instance in two or three of
them; The first of which shall be one that was preferred, and found in the same
28th. year of Queen Elizabeth, and at the same time with those before mentioned.

And that was against William Winterhey, Humphrey Smith, and others for
pyratically setting upon a certain French Vessel called the Susan of Mestrey,
laden in the River of Bourdeaux with French Wines, and lying at Anchor upon the
public river, called Hampton water, within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty,
and then and there by force of arms, etc. making an assault, etc. upon Daniel
Bretton, Governor of the said Ship, and taking away and stealing from the said
Ship to the value of 100 l. and 70 Tun of French Wine, of the value of 300 l.
of English money, of the Goods and Chattels of Maturine Gantier, etc. The
Indictment runs thus.

Inquiratur, Rot. Admir. an. 28. El. m. 23.
etc. si Willielmus Winterhey nuper de, etc. and Umphridus Smith de, etc. in
cymba quadam vectoria tunc super publicum flumen vocat Hampton water, infra,
etc. vi and armis, etc. navem quandam Gallicam vocat. the Susan de Messhey in
rivo Burdugalensi vinis Gallicis onustam, etc, ad anchoras exist. vi and armis,
etc, ac in Daniel Bretton corrector. in Dom. navis, etc. insultum, etc. ac
eand. navem, etc. ad valentiam 100 l. ac 70 Dolia vini Gallici valoris 300 l.
monetae Angliae, de Bonis and Cattallis Maturini Gantier, etc. ceperint, furati
sint, etc. Billa vera.

And Thomas James was indicted, for that upon Severn, beneath the first Bridge
of the same, he did assault one John Gethin, and others, and with a Gun charged
with bullets shots and hatt the said John Gethin, that he then and there
instantly dyed. The Indictment runs thus; Inquiratur si Thomas James de etc.
super quandam partem maris vocatam Seavern, infra primum pontem ejusdem, etc.
vi and armis in quosdam Johannem Gethin and alios insultum fecit, and praefatum
Johannem Gethin cum quibusdam pilis tormentariis plumbeis, in bombardo, sive
tormento pretii december solidorum inclusis, etc. unam plagam mortalem, etc. de
qua idem Johannes Gethin ad tunc and ibidem instanter obiit.

I shall instance only in one notorious Pyracy more committed upon the same
Navigable River of Severn, upon which were indicted William Holborne of
Southold in the County of Suffolk Gentleman, Captain of a Man of War called
the Hopewell of Weymouth Melcombe Regis; Edward Wright of Berry in the same
County Gentleman, otherwise called Captain Careless, Captain of a French Man of
War of the burden of forty Tuns; Henry Ward of Barstable in the County of
Devon, Captain of the Ship the Mary of Stonehouse; William Sweet of Stonehouse
in the County of Devon Mariner, and 12 more by name, besides others in general:
for that upon the second day of August, etc. they being in the said three
Ships, furnished in a warlike manner, between the Maritime places called
Wormeshead and Oxmuch in the River of Severn, within the Maritime Jurisdiction
of the Admiralty of England, being pyratically and feloniously gathered
together, did by force of arms, viz. with Swords, Guns, etc. in the three said
Robbing Ships, pyratically and feloniously appointed between the said Wormshead
and Oxmuch within the said Jurisdiction, the day and year aforesaid,
pyratically and feloniously set upon, climb up into, break and enter into 4
Merchants Ships called the Margaret of Caermarthen, the little Matthew of
Caermarthen, the Tasker of Milford, and the Margaret of Burrey, laden with
diverse Goods, Wares and Merchandises at the Fair of St. James, then lately held
at Bristol, whilst they were sailing from the Port of Bristol, toward the Port
of Caermarthen, and did by force of arms assault and make Affray upon, beat and
evil entreat, and put in fear of their lives James Joanes, Thomas Richards,
William Tasker, and Griffith Jones, Governors and Masters of the said Ships
under God, and diverse other persons, Mariners of the said Ships, unto the said
Pirates and Robbers unknown, being then and there the said day and year in the
said Merchants Ships in the peace of God and their said Sovereign the Queen,
and three Packs of Woollen and Linen Cloth, Dowlas, Cress-cloth, Holland,
Cambricks and Lockerams, to the value of three hundred pounds of English money,
two great Chests of Velvets, Taffaties, and other Goods to the value of two
hundred pounds, one Iron Chest to the value of twelve pounds, one pack of fine
Dowlas, Lockerams, Cress-clothes, Hollands, Cambricks, Silk Lace, and other
Goods to the value of one hundred and sixty pounds of like English money, one
great Chest of Millian Fustians and Callicoes, and other Merchandises to the
value of sixty pounds, and a Chest of large Hats, Mantles and Clothes, to the
value of thirty pounds of like English money, of the Goods and Chattels of
Griffith Atkins and Henry Philips of Carmarthen, Merchants, then and there, the
day and year aforesaid, between the said Wormsbead and Oxmuch, upon the said
navigable River, within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty aforesaid, being and
remaining in the Custody and possession of the aforesaid James Joanes, Thomas
Richards, William Tasker, and Richard Joans, Masters under God of the Ships,
the Margaret of Caermarthen, the little Matthew of Carmarthen, the Tasker of
Milford, and the Margaret of Burry, out of the said Ships from the said
Masters, and out of their custody and possession, did then and there
pyratically, feloniously, and violently take, steal, spoil, and carry away,
contary to the peace of the Sovereign Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity,
and contrary to the form of diverse Statutes to the contrary made and provided:
The Indictment it self runs in the same form with those before mentioned,
viz.

Inquiratur pro Domina Regina si Willielmus Holbourne nuper de Southould in
Comitatu Suffolciae Genesis nuper Capitaneus navis militaris, the Hopewell, Portus

pyratae, and malefactores incogniti, secundo die mensis Augusti, anno Regni,
etc. in praedictis tribus navibus militaliter instructis tunc, etc. as in fully
set down in English.

Now to show further that the Cognizance of all matters happening upon these
Ports, and Havens, did and does belong unto the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty
properly, and entirely, and to no other Jurisdiction, I shall instance in one
Record of many, whereby it will appear that when the City of London (who by
their Charter have more power and privilege upon the River of Thames, then any
Judicatory whatsoever, except the Admiralty) have endeavored to take
cognizance of matters of this nature, the same have been demanded from them by
the Admiralty Court. And that Record shows that one John Seaward being
committed to the Counter in Woodstreet, London, for suspision of drowning a Boy
in the River of Thames, The Sheriff of the City of London was commanded by the
Admiralty to bring the said Seaward, before the said Court of the Admiralty,
upon the 15th. of March, in the 30th. year of Queen Elizabeth, which Precept
was returned by Thomas Dixon on the behalf of the Sheriff of London, together
with the said John Seaward accordingly, and the Precept and return thereof run
in these words.

I might here take an occasion to set forth a number of Records of the
Admiralty, both of this time, before it, and since, which would set forth the
multiplicity of actions entered, proceeded in, and sentenced in the Admiralty
Court, for Injuries, Wrongs and Trespasses done upon the River of Thames, and
other Ports and Havens, and likewise show that when parties have sued in the
Courts of Guildhall London, or other Courts, for any matter of such injury,
wrong, or trespass, done unto them, upon the River of Thames, or such other
Ports, that they have been called into the Admiralty Court, and there been
proceeded against, and punished for their contempt against that Court; And if I
should collect them altogether, and here set them forth, they would appear very
many for one of the instances set down by Sir Edward Coke in his 22th. Chapter
of his fourth Book of his Institutes, against the power and Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty upon the Ports and Havens.

And yet perhaps it may be said, that herein the Admiralty had usurped a power
which belonged not thereunto; but when as many instances may be set against
one, it is easily judged on which side the usurpation lies; But to decide the
question more clearly, I shall instance in some few of many of the Common Law's
own Records, which plainly determine this point of Jurisdiction upon the Ports,
and Havens, against the instances brought by Sir Edward Coke in his said 22th.
Chapter against the Jurisdiction and Power of the Admiralty upon those places.

CHAP. XVIII.
That by Writs de Procedendo out of the Chancery, upon Supersedeas from thence
granted, the Admiral is acknowledged to have Jurisdiction upon the Ports and
Havens.
WHat has been already said, I conceive might be sufficient, to convince the
Judgments of indifferent men, that the Ports, Creeks, and Havens of the Sea,
are within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and not within the Bodies of
Counties. But, because I know this Argument may meet with some particular
Contradictors, who will be apt rather to adhere to one President out of the
Courts at Westminster, then be convinced by very many binding Authorities and
Authentic Proofs of this nature, I shall make this truth likewise evident by
both Writs de procedendo, awarded upon Writs of Supersedeas, out of the
Chancery, and by Consultations awarded upon Prohibitions out of the Courts of
Common Law.

The Ship the Trinity of London, alias the Trinity of Hull-bridge, lying at
Anchor upon the River of Thames, belonging unto one Thomas Pierce, was there
arrested and taken into the possession of the Admiral, and a Supersedeas was
brought; But Termino Mich. 27th. Hen. 8. a Writ de procedendo was awarded in
these words.

John Gilbert of Ratcliffe sued Thomas Linsey of Woolwitch, Fisherman, in the
Admiralty Court for certain Wrongs and Injuries done unto him upon the River of

Now it is plain this was an Action brought in the Admiralty for, or concerning
certain things and injuries done unto the Agent, within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty; and the place which is here said to be within the Jurisdiction of
the Admiralty, is a Port or Haven, set down in express words, viz. the public
River of Thames within the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, beyond London Bridge
toward the Sea, infra Jurisdictionem Admiralitatis Angliae, super publico
flumine Rivi Thamisiae infra fluxum et refluxum maris, ultra pontem Civitatis
London, versus mare, etc. And this Action is likewise there said to be brought
according to due form of law and custom of the Admiralty Court, secundam
debitam legis formam et consuetudinem Curiae nostrae Admiralitatis praedictae
coram vobis in eadem Curia implacitaverit. And Lindsey for suggesting these
injuries done upon the River of Thames, to be done in the body of the County of
Kent, is said to have endeavored fraudulently and maliciously to decline the
cognizance of the Court of the Admiralty, and unjustly to hinder the due course
of Law there: Cognitionem ejusdem Curiae nostrae Admiralitatis in ea part
fraudulenter et malitiose satagens declinare et debitum legis praecessum ibidem
minus just impedire. And he is said unlawfully to have procured that Writ of
Supersedeas to be directed to that Court, breve nostrum de supersedendo vobis
minus rite dirigi procuravit. And that Writ of Supersedeas is said to have gone
out rashly and unadvisedly, improvide emanavit, because Lindsey was justly sued
there for things and injuries done and arising within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, pro rebus and injuiis infra nostram jurisdictionem Admiralitatis
nostrae praedictae factis et emergentibus, just tractatus extitit. And it is
there declared, that the Cognizance of the Admiralty Court shall not by such
malice and suggestion be wronged, Nolentes quod per hujusmodi militiam et
suggestionem, cognitio in praefata Curia nostra Admiralitatis nostrae Angliae
taliter derogetur: And the Court commanded to proceed according to law, etc.
notwithstanding the Supersedeas or any other Prohibition directed to the
contrary.

So by these Writs de procedendo out of the Chancery, the Admiral is
acknowledged to have Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens; and many more of
the same nature might be instanced in, which for brevity sake I omit.

CHAP. XIX.
That by Consultations out of the Courts of Common Law, upon Prohibitions
thence granted, it is clear the Admiral has Jurisdiction upon the Ports and
Havens.
AS it is manifest by Writs de procedendo, out of the Chancery upon Writs of
Supersedeas thence granted, that the Admiral has jurisdiction upon the Ports
and Havens; so it is likewise evident by consultations out of the Common Law
Courts at Westminster, upon Prohibitions from thence upon false suggestions
granted; that the Admirals power and authority does extend unto the cognizance
of such causes as do from thence arise* some of which I shall instance in.

Patrick Landy of Broheda in Ireland sued Richard Prideaux in the Admiralty
Court pro qu^^quaginta les dicars pellium salsorum, libelling that the said
Richa^d Prideaux had infra fluxum and refluxum maris received and taken into
his hands and possession, the Goods and Merchandises aforesaid, and kept the
same, or otherwise had de eitfully alienated them, or disposed of them, ipsum
Richardum Prideaux bona res and merces etc. in manus et possessionem sui ipsius
Richardi infra fluxum et refluxum maris accepiss^ et sumpsisse, eademq, tunc
penes se hab^^sse, seu saltem eadem dolo malo alienasse.

Prideaux suggesteth that these fifty Dickers of Hides being in certain
Warehouses at Padstow in the County of Cornwall, infra corpus ejusdem C^nut^us,
were by George Syddenham and George Francis there sold and delivered unto him,
and by him received and kept, and convetted to his own use, and that he was
unjustly vexed and sued in the Admiralty Court for the same, contrary to the
Statutes of 13 and 15 of R 2. and obtained a Prohibition.

But the matter being argued in Court, and the Goods and Merchandises being
found to have been in the possession of the said Prideaux within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, viz. within the ebbing and flowing of the Sea,
19 die Junii 38 Eliz. a Consultation was awarded, which says, Quia tamen
Justiciariis nostris apud Westmon. per debitam Examinationem in hac part
factam, satis constat quod praedicta Curia nostra Admiralitatis in hujusmodi
placitis, dummodo res sic se habeant, aliqualiter in eisdem impediriseu
retardari non debeat. The Consultation I shall here set down at large, whereby
both the Libel, Suggestion, Prohibition and Consultation will appear.

T. E. Anderson apud Westmon. decimo nono die Junii Anno regni nostri tricesimo
octavo. Culwicke Scott.

Shortly after the granting of this Consultation by the Lord Chief Justice
Anderson, and before the cause could come to hearing, or to be fully determined
in the Admiralty Court, Prideaux upon the same Suggestion procures another
Prohibition from the Lord Chief Justice Popham, and thereby again stayed the
proceedings in the Admiralty Court, until the 41th year of the Queen. But in
that year vicesimo septimo die Junii, upon reexamination of the point, another
Consulation was awarded agreeable with the former; and the Admiralty Court was
then a second time set free to determine the Cause in these more express words:
Ideo vobis mandamus quod praedictus Patricius in causa praedicta quoad omnes
hujusmodi res and contractus praedict. super altum mare, vel super ejus
necessaria dependentia, Ita quod vos vel praedictus Patricius de aliquibus
rebus, contractibus infra corpus alicujus Comitatus regni nostri Angliae factis
ne intromittatis, etc. in Curia Admiralitatis praedictae coram vobis, seu
aliquo vestrum licite procedere and facere valeat, etc.

Now here does this Consultation put a plain distinction between the bodies of
Counties and the Ports and Havens, here called necessaria dependentia alti
maris; and indeed they are such necessary dependants of the Sea, that they may
very well, nay they must be called mare, the Sea, though not altum mare, the
high Sea; otherwise needless, and altogether in vain was this distinction of
mare and altum mare, of the Sea, and the high Sea, and main Sea, if the Ports,
Creeks and Havens were not mare, Sea, and those parts of the Sea further remote
from the land, altum mare, the high or main Sea. And then let us consider that
though upon every suggestion, whereon a Prohibition is in such cases awarded
upon the Statute of the 13th of Richard the second, the words sur le mere in
the same, be in the Prohibition translated super altum mare; yet will not those
words sur le mere, nor any other words in that Statute bear any such
construction (as by the said Statute, if looked into, Ins. cap. lib. 3.
will appear, which Statute shall be hereafter set down at large according to
the Parliament Roll in the Tower.) And then is there nothing at all contained
in that Statute, which can so much as seem to limit the Admiral to the high
Seas, or exclude his Jurisdiction from extending to the Ports, Creeks and
Havens, which are sea, though not high sea. And so the very foundation whereon
all the Arguments which tend to the deprivation of the Admiral of his
Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens are grounded, is clearly taken away.

Patrick Landy likewise sued John Prideaux of Padstow pro tribus millibus
centenis sepi libellando eundem Johannem Prideaux bona, res and merces
praedicta ac alia bona, res, and merces in manus and possessionem sui ipsius
Johannis infra fluxum and refluxum maris accepisse and sumpsisse, eademque tunc
penes se habuisse, seu saltem eadem dolo alienasse, etc.

Prideaux upon suggestion that those Goods and Merchandises were per quendam
Georgium Sydenham nuper Capitaneum navis Anglicanae vocat. the Black Boat apud
Villam de Padstow in Comitatu Cornubiae, infra corpus ejusdem Comitatus, and
non super altum mare vendita and deliberata, and per ipsum Johannem ibi
recepta, habita and tenta, and ad vsum suum proprium conversa, etc. And
obtained a Prohibition.

12. Feb. 37 Elizab. A Consultation is awarded in the same words with the
other. (...) eod. fill. ^. 5.


The same Patrick Landy sued Digorius Halman in the Admiralty, pro quinquaginta
dycariis pellium Hibernicorum, libellando quod idem Digorius praedictas
quinquagintas dycarias pellium sub nomine bonorum, rerum and mercium in manus
and possessionem suas infra fluxum and refluxum maris accepisset and
sumpissset, easdemque tunc penes se habuisset, and saltem easdem dolo
alienasset, etc.

Digorius Halman upon suggestion that Gremfield Halse, Nicholas Halse, and John
Hoyell alias Howele at Plymoth in the County of Devon, infra corpus ejusdem
Comitatus Devoniae, and non super altum mare fuerunt possessionati de dictis
quinquaginta dycariis pellium, etc. and pro certa denariorum summa
barganizarunt and vendiderunt eidem Digario Halman, ac quibusdam Johanni
Martin, and Thomae Crane praedictas quinquaginta Dicarias pellium, etc. And
obtained a Prohibition.

Vicesimo sex to Maii 40 Eliz. a Consultation was awarded. Sup. eod. fill. m 17.
T. Edvardo Anderson.

And as before, so here in this same cause, and upon the same suggestion, a new
Prohibition was awarded by the Lord Chief Justice Popham.

But 26 Maii 41 Eliz. a Consultation was again awarded, as in the before
mentioned cause, and many more I might likewise instance in, and set forth both
the Prohibitions and Consultations at large, but that I should thereby too much
enlarge this Treatise.

Now as by the Writs de procedendo awarded out of the high Court of Chancery,
upon Supersedeas in the former Chapter set down, so by the Consultations upon
Prohibitions awarded out the Courts of Common Law here set forth, I hope it is
evident enough, that the Admirals Jurisdiction extends to the Ports and
Havens, Infra lib. 3. cap. 9.
and to all things done thereon. Vide etiam quae sunt in cap. 9. libri tertu
specificata.

CHAP. XX.
That the Ports, Havens, and Harbors where Ships do lie or ride at Anchor, are
not within the bodies of Counties, but that the Jurisdiction which the
Admiralty has anciently had thereon, has been by Act of Parliament reserved
thereunto.
NOw seeing that the Ports and Havens, whereon Ships and other Vessels do ride
and lie at Anchor, are not only of a different nature from the land, but are
absolutely consisting of the same nature with the Sea, and are sometimes more
drawn in, and sometimes again further stretched out; and are from antiquity
both by ancient Authors and ancient Records termed and called the Arms of the
Sea, as indeed most properly they still are, I cannot easily be induced to
think that these Ports or Havens, by being only encompassed on both sides with
several Counties, and touched upon by the banks thereof, can be said to be
within the body of either of those Counties, or so much as the least member,
part, or parcel thereof, or so much as properly be said to be within the skirts
thereof.

I must confess that many particular Statutes, and new Laws have been made,
directing such and such things to be done or not done, either by Sea, or upon
any Port or Haven, which by the Civil and Maritime Laws had not been formerly
in the same manner, or perhaps not so fully directed: And the cognizance of
such matters by the same Statutes and Laws, may seem to belong unto other
Courts, as well as unto the Admiralty, by reason whereof some have often
reached at all, and have strove to hold more in one hand then they could grasp
in both their arms. But such things both upon the Sea, and upon the Ports and
Havens, as have been anciently determined by the Admiralty, according to the
Laws Civil and Maritime, have not been by such Statutes or new Laws really
taken therefrom, nor were ever intended to be: But the same have been
constituted and made in affirmance of the power and authority of that Court, as
well upon the Ports and Havens as upon the high Seas; and have been by express
words continued thereunto, and the cognizance of many such matters, by such new
Laws appointed, have been directed unto that Court.

I shall instance only in one Statute that shows the same, and then leave
this subject, and break my self unto another.

By the Statute of 32 Hen. 8. cap. 14. a rate was set what should be paid for
the freight or portage of several particular sorts of Merchandises from the
Port of London to other places, and from thence to London; and this being a
thing mutable, which could not be formerly settled for a perpetual Law,
according to any Rules or Laws Civil or Maritime (though the like had been
formerly done by the Admiralty pro tempore, as appears by the Inquisition
taken at Quinborow, and the other Statutes and Articles of the Admiralty before
several times mentioned) the cognizance of the excessive freight taken for
transportation of these particular sorts of Merchandises, was by the same
Statute to be taken in the Courts at Westminster. As for the forfeiture of the
double value of the freight so taken, the one half to the King, the other half
to the Informer, yet the excessive rates for freight in general taken for
transportation of any goods whatsoever, and from and to any Port or Place
whatsoever, having been punishable by the Admiralty, that power is no more
taken from that Court by this clause, then the trial of pyracy, etc. by the
Civil and Maritime Laws is from thence taken by the Statute of H. 8. 27. cap.
4. and an. 28. cap. 15. which gives a power to that Court to try the same
offenses after another manner, which is a thing by all of both professions
acknowledged.

Another clause there was contained in the said Statute, that if any Stranger,
Denizen, or not Denizen, should lade on board any English Bottom any of their
Goods, Wares, and Merchandises to be transported to any foreign Port, that
they should pay no other Custom or Subsidy therefore, then such as the English
paid: But in case that they did laid their said Goods, Wares, and Merchandises
aboard the Ships or Vessels of Foreigners, then they should pay such Custom
or Subsidy as had been usually paid by Foreigners.

This being a thing newly by that Statute appointed, and not determined
formerly by the Civil and Maritime Laws, whereby the Admiralty proceeds; yet
was it by the same Statute provided, that if there should be no such Ships or
Vessels of England, or Dominions of the same, at or in the Port, Haven, or
Place where the said Strangers, Aliens, or Denizens, their Servants or Factors
would freight or lade their Wares and Merchandises toward the outward Regions,
that then if the said Stangers or Denizens, their Factors, Atturneys or
Servants before he or they did lade, freight, or convey the said Goods, Wares,
Commodities, or Merchandises into any strange Ship or Vessel, did notify and
declare the same lack or want of such English Ships or Vessels, unto the Lord
high Admiral of England for the time being, or his Lieutenant, Deputy, or
Deputies, if etc. and did obtain his or their Certificate to be made under his
or their Seal to whom such notice or declaration was to be made of lack and
want of such English Ships and Vessels, that then it should be lawful for them
to freight and lade their said Wares and Merchandises in any strange Ship or
Vessel, at that time being in the same Port or Haven, and to pay none other
Susidies or Customs therefore but as the English Merchants did use, and ought
to do by the Laws and Customs of England.

And it is enacted by the said Statute, That the Owner and Owners, Master and
Masters, and other Governor or Governors of Ships, and every of them to his
or their power, and for as much as in him or them should be, shall provide that
all Wares and Merchandises which shall be by Merchants, their Factors or
Servants, or any of them, brought into any Ship or Vessel, shall be honestly
and in good order saved and kept.

And under that clause it is provided, That if any Merchant, Stranger, or other
find himself aggrieved or damnifyed by negligent keeping of the said
Merchandises or Wares, or by long delaying or protracting of the time in taking
the Voyage, by the said Owner, his Factor, Master or any the Mariners of the
said Ship, otherwise then shall be agreed betwixt the said Merchant, his
Factor, So that the Charter-party though made at land, by this Statue is
cognoscible by the Admiralty for the breach of it.
Attorney, or Servant; and Master or Owner in or by the said Charter-party,
(not being let by wind or weather) shall and may have his remedy by way of
complaint before the Lord Admiral of England for the time being, his
Lieutenant, or Deputy, against the said Owner or Owners, Master or Masters,
Governor or Governors, or his or their Factor or Factors; which Lord Admiral
for the time being, his Lieutenant or Deputy shall and may summarily and
without delay, take such order, and give such direction therein, as shall be
thought to his or their discretions most convenient, and according to right and
justice in that behalf, Sup. cap 10, 11, 12, 13. hujus lib. 2.
which is in affirmance of the Civil Laws before mentioned.

But Mr. Poulton renders this Statute obsolete: And for the first part of it,
which sets a rate what shall be paid for the freight or portage of Goods and
Merchandises from the Port of London to other places, and from thence to
London. I must needs agree with him, that the same may, or necessarily must be
obsolete and out of use; for that since the time of making of the said Statute,
the rates and prizes for Cables, Anchors, and other Tackle, Furniture, Victual,
and other Provisions, have been much altered and increased, nor indeed are, or
can the Ships themselves either be built or bought at such rates or prizes as
they then were, so that they cannot be let for the same freight they then were.

For the other clause of Foreigners transporting their Wares and Merchandises
in English Bottoms, to pay no more Custom then the English, whether the
Customers have disused the same, and so made it obsolete, or not, I know not.
But in case they have so done; I know no warrant or necessary cause they have
for so doing; but for the last mentioned clause, That Masters and owners of
Ships shall provide, that all the Merchants Wares and Merchandises shall be in
good order saved and kept, and that the Merchant which shall thereby, or by
delay or protracting of the Voyage (without just cause) longer then the time
agreed by the Charter-party, find himself aggrieved, shall and may have his
remedy in the Admiralty.

This is only in affirmance of the Law of that Court, Sup. cap. 10, 11, 12, 13.
hujus lib. 2.
and was both before the making of that Act, and has been ever since used and
practiced in that Court, and cannot by the disuse of it at the Common Law
(where it is not by that Act at all to be used) be made obsolete, but is by the
practice and use of it, where it is appointed to be used, held, continued, and
preserved from being made obsolete there.

Now no man can say, but that this saving and keeping of Merchants Goods and
Merchandises honestly, and in good order, is clearly meant of such saving and
keeping them honestly and in good order, as well whilst the Ship or Vessel
remains in the Port or Harbor, as when she comes at high Sea; and the
delaying and protracting of time in taking of the Voyage with the next good
wind, according to the time agreed on by the Charter-party, is most certainly a
wrong or injury done upon the Port or Haven, and the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty in causes of this nature upon the Ports and Havens by this Statute
affirmed and confirmed.

And moreover the very breach of the Charter-party, though made at land, is by
this Act affirmed to be cognoscible in the Admiralty, which brings me in the
very next place upon that point and particular, wherewith I shall begin the
next Book.

THE MARITIME DICAEOLOGIE, OR SEA-JURISDICTION.
THE THIRD BOOK.
CHAP. I.
That all Differences arising from Contracts concerning Maritime Affairs ought
to be tried in the Admiralty Court, and the reasons thereof.
HAving been thus long upon the Ports, and Havens, it is now full time to begin
to think of the discharging of the Ship, and the delivery out of her lading to
the Merchants, to whom the same belongs, and for to come to the Caulking,
fitting, trimming, preparing and furnishing of her with Victual, Tackle,
Apparel and furniture, etc. and manning her with Seamen and Mariners for some
voyage, and taking in of her lading from the Merchants or their Factors to be
transported in the same. In the effecting of all which several men of several
Occupations, Trades, and employments, are severally to be contracted with, as
well at Land, as upon the Port and Haven. The validity and invalidity of all
which contracts, Sir Edward Coke would have to be Cognoscible, Tryable, and
determinable in the Common Law Courts, according to the Course of the Common
Law, and not in the Admiralty Court, or according to the Proceedings, Rules,
and Grounds of the Civil and Maritime Laws. But I must here likewise adventure
another dispute with him upon this point.

And first I shall offer some reasons to the contrary, and then endeavor an
answer unto his Arguments. And after both, I shall set forth what Laws have
been made for the determination of such differences as shall arise upon such
contracts, by which Laws certainly they are still to be determined.

And first I say that by Ships, and Shipping, this Nation is secured and
preserved from foraign Invasions, and by Trade and Commerce with foraign
Nations not a little enriched; and neither Shipping nor Trade, can be upheld
without the welfare of Merchants, Owners of Ships, Fitters, Furnishers of them,
Mariners, etc.

And this welfare of the Merchant, Owner, Fitter, Furnisher, and Mariner,
cannot be maintained without a settled Jurisdiction of Admiralty, regulated
according to the Civil and Maritime Laws, settled amongst, and known unto all
Maritime Nations.

Because (as it is well known) all of them have dealings with such foraign
Nations abroad, and such foraign Nations with them at home, who both expect and
will have the same Justice meted to them, that they measure unto others; else
will they both forbear to Trade with that Nation, which shall deny them that
Justice, and likewise deny that Nation to Trade with them.

Now it is most certain that the municipal Laws of this Kingdom, are so
different from the Civil and Maritime Laws, that if Maritime Causes (be they
either for freight, wages, damages done to Merchants Goods, Building, Tackling,
and furnishing of Ships, etc.) should be here determined by the municipal Laws
of this Nation, and beyond the Seas by the Civil and Maritime Laws, they must
necessarily receive many of them, a different; many of them a clean contrary
Judgment.

To instance briefly in some few of many; If Mariners be hired to serve in a
Ship, for so much by the Month, and serve diverse Months in her, and the Ship
dies at Sea, and never makes port; here the Judgment of these two Laws will
be clean contrary.

Likewise, if a Ship be let to freight at a certain rate by the Month from
Port to Port, and so home again, and the Ship in some of those Ports shall be
imbarqued for some months, here the Judgments of the two Laws both for
freight and wages for those months will be contrary, and upon other emergent
causes from hence arising, the Judgments will likewise be, in some far
different, and in other some clean contrary.

If the Merchants Wines, Oils, etc. be leaked out end for end, the Judgments
upon Action for the freight will be different, if not contrary.

If the Merchants Goods shall be damnified by ill stowage, or careless looking
to, or shall be purloyned or stolen, the party not known, or if known, not able
to make satisfaction, here, upon Action brought by the Owner for his freight,
and by the Mariner for his Wages, the Judgments will differ very much.

If in a storm at Sea, or in any Port or Haven, the Ship and her lading be in
danger, and some Goods be cast over board, for preservation of the rest, by the
Maritime Laws, the remaining Goods are to be cast into an Avaridge, to make
satisfaction for the Goods cast overboard, by which Law certain Rules, as well
concerning the danger, the nature of the several Goods, and the casting them
over board, as concerning the Avaridge it self to be made, are prescribed;
which Rules are not known, or owned by the municipal Laws of this Nation, and
therefore cannot that Law take cognizance thereof, and consequently upon Action
brought by the owners for freight wheresoever contracted for, in these and
diverse other like cases the Judgment of that Law cannot be agreeable unto the
rules and grounds of the Maritime Laws.

If a Mariner be hired by the month, and does serve several months in the
Ship, and afterward desert or leave the Ship, and run away, upon Action
brought for his wages, the Judgments of the two Laws will be clean contrary.

If the Mariner without leave of the Master lie on shore, and the Ship or goods
be damnified, or the Voyage protracted; or if the Ship be not well moored, so
that for default thereof she be damnified; or if the Mariner take up clothes,
or borrow money of his fellow, and put the same in the Pursers book, upon
Action brought for his wages, the Judgments of the two Laws will differ.

If two, be they Merchants, Owners, Mariners, or Furnishers of Ships, etc. and
those either English or Foreigners, or the one English, and the other a
Foreigner, do for Freight, Tackle, or Furniture of Ships, etc. or by other
Commerce in their seafaring business, become indebted each to other, upon
Action brought by either of them, the Maritime Law admits the other to
allege and prove what likewise is due to him from him that sueth at the same
time, and allows him compensation, which the Municipal Law allows not, but
concludes that stoppage is no payment; by which Law, if exercised in business
of this nature, the absent might recover much against the party present, and he
be constrained to wait his opportunity, for the recovery of what is due to him,
from him that has recovered against him, to the lessening of his Stock, and
great hinderance of his Trade: And in like manner the Non-solvent might recover
much against the Solvent, and he nothing at all against the Non-solvent, which
would be very much inconvenient to all seatrading men, and a thing not known
abroad.

Now these Maritime Laws for Maritime businesses are all grounded upon strong
reasons, which if they could be here at large particularly set forth, yet would
they not take away the reason whereon the Municipal Laws for Land affairs are
grounded, in regard different Judgments in different things do arise from
different grounds of reason: so that the Judgments upon businesses agitated
upon the Land may be grounded upon reason, and yet will not that reason hold to
ground the like Judgment upon in business at Sea, or upon the great waters,
those being accommodated with many advantages and helps in their agitation and
petformance, of which these are altogether destitute.

And this will introduce a second reason why the welfare of the Merchants and
other seafaring men cannot be maintained without the settling and upholding of
these Maritime Laws, for decision of differences and controversies in maritime
affairs, which is because these Laws are suitable thereunto, and complete to
determine all differences in businesses of that nature, which as I conceive,
the Municipal Laws of the Land are not.

For Maritime causes, especially those for wages, must have a quick and sudden
dispatch of Justice; the Mariners, as they come in with one good wind, so must
they speedily go out with another, and not wait Westminster Hall Terms, to the
loss of a whole Voyage, such their employment being their whole livelihood.

Nor must they commence every man a Suit according to his particular contract,
to the expense of as much, if not more, then his wages come to, but must as the
Martime Laws allow them, commence their Action in one joint Petition to a Judge
at all times settled in a readiness, and in a constant place of Judicature,
where and to whom they may make their present addresses, for dispatch,
according to such Laws as they are used unto wheresoever they come.

If the Mariner must have such dispatch against the Master, then must the
Master have the like against the Merchant for his freight, out of which he is
to pay the wages; and the Merchant the like against the Master and Owners of
the Ship for damages done to his goods at sea; all which is speedily tried at
one and the same time by the maritime Laws, which upon full hearing allows
compensation, and every one has at first his own according to proof, or
confession upon their personal answers, and no more; otherwise if the Mariners
shall by several Trials at the Common Law recover their full wages of the
Master, and be gone, and then the Merchant recover against him likewise, or
against the Owners of the Ship perhaps as much or more then their freight
amounts unto, for damage done unto his Goods, perhaps by the Mariners, who
are gone, and not to be met with again, and be put afterward to sue for their
freight: this will soon cause the owners of Ships to lay their Vessels by the
walls: or if the Mariners shall recover their wages of the Masters or Owners,
and be gone, and then the Owners shall recover their freight against the
Merchants, whose goods are damnified or spoiled by the Mariners, and not by
default of the Ship, or by default of the Ship, and not by any neglect or fault
of the Mariners, or by both and he then put to a trial to recover by Jury the
damage he has sustained, he is like to have but little or no redress. If the
Mariner shall have his dispatch, and be gone (which he must have, or be undone)
and the Merchant wait his Trial from Term to Term at the ^ommon Law, then by
reason of the absence of the Mariners, can neither the Owner prove the damage
to be done by mere casualty, or stress of weather at sea; which he is not
liable to make satifaction for; nor can the Merchant prove the insufficiency of
the Ship, in which case the Owner is to make satisfaction, besides many
inconveniences more which might be reckoned.

Thus is not the one Law only suitable and agreeable to maritime affairs, and
the other unsuitable and disagreeable thereunto; but the one is likewise
perfect and complete for deciding of all controversies thence arising; the
other imperfect, and in no wise complete for that purpose in my judgment.

For Bills of Bumery, or Bottomry (for many reasons most useful, and
absolutely necessary in sea trade) they are likewise triable only by the
Maritime Laws, and can be no ways tryable at the Common Law, wheresoever made,
by reason the Ship only is liable to payment, which may be arrested according
to the Maritime Laws, either at the main Sea; or upon any Creek, Port, or Haven
adjoining upon the land, which cannot be done by the Common Law, as I humbly
conceive.

So likewise contracts de nautico foenore, pecunia trajectitia, or nautica
usura, wheresoever made, are tryable by the Civil and Maritime Laws, and not by
the Common Law of England; and the Civil Law has several Titles concerning
these particulars, as in the Digests the Title de nautico foenore in the Code,
the same Title in the Novel Constitutions, the Title de nauticis usuris, etc.
in which Titles these particulars are defined, what they are, what makes them
so to be, and what makes them not to be so; and are likewise distinguished
into several sorts, each of which is terminated and limited unto its proper
bounds, as when this Nauticum foenus is distinguished into Heteroplum and
Amphoteroplum, as some Authors term it; Heteroplum cum commeatus tantum
periculum foenerator suscepit; Amphoteroplum cum and commeatus and remeatus
periculum suscepit; the one when he undertaketh the danger of the Ship only
outward bound, or only homeward bound; the other when he undergoeth the danger
both of the outward and homeward Voyage, and many other of the like nature, of
which the Common Law has not one word, that ever I could hear of, much less
any rule to guide the professors thereof in the Judgment of such things.

In Bills of sale of Ships, etc. though made at land, the parties to whom the
same are made, cannot (if withstood) obtain the possession thereof, but by the
Civil and Maritime Law, and power of the Admiralty Court. And every Ship that
is built may have many part. Owners, and most commonly she has, and before she
can be completely built, tackled, victualled, fitted and prepared to put to
sea, a great number of several Tradesmen must necessarily have been employed
therein, and been assisting thereunto, which cannot with any possibility, every
of them repair to every Owner, some possibly being or inhabiting beyond the
Seas, other some in this Nation; if all in this Nation, yet oftentimes some in
one place, some in another, far remote each from other, and from the place of
such her building, tackling, etc. to make his particular contract with him for
his materials, workmanship, victual, or other furniture and necessaries, so
that necessarily some one of the Owners (which commonly has not above an
eighth, sixteenth, or two and thirtieth part, and sometimes one that has no
part at all) is by the rest made Mr. of her, and contracteth with all these
several Tradesmen, who regard not his ability, by reason the Ship it self is by
the Maritime Laws liable for the payment of every man's particular debt, which
Law must necessarily take place, or else few or no Ships be built and employed
for trade; for at the Common Law I conceive they can have only their several
Actions against the Master, with whom they contracted, who for the most part is
not able to make satisfaction to one third part of them, and many times not to
one particular man.

If one Ship shall do damage to another, either at the main Sea, or upon any
Creek, Port, or Haven, the damage must be sued for in the Admiralty Court, and
Judgment given according to the Maritime Laws, which prescribes every Ship her
rule, how to steer her course both going out to sea, or coming in from sea, or
riding at sea, which plainly demonstrateth which Ship was in fault, by which
the Judgment must be regulated. And no Action can be so properly commenced at
the Common Law for these damages, for that the Owners damnified can very hardly
arrest all the Owners of the other Ship, which did the damage, nor indeed can
any of those Owners by that Law be liable to such arrest; but the Master, who
if solvent, will not come on shore, but take his employment in some other Ship
outward bound, so that the remedy lies properly against the Ship by the
Maritime Laws, as has been already said.

If a contract be made beyond the seas concerning any Maritime businesses by
bill, or otherwise, the same is not cognizable at the Common Law by their own
books, neither indeed if it were, could it receive the same Judgment it shall
by the Civil and Maritime Law; for a verbal Contract is not made by Assumsit
there, as here it is; nor in a Contract made in writing is any thing more
required, or thought necessary then the signing or subscribing of a Bill, for
performance, etc. and sometimes the sealing, but never the delivery; nor is
there any such ceremony there used or known, without which by the Common Law
(as I have heard) it is nothing; so that the English Merchants, or other
seafaring man's Bill, here signed, sealed, and deliveted, according to the
formalities of this Nation in that case required, shall, being sued in any
Court beyond the seas, prove good against him, without due examinations of half
the said formalities, whereas the Foreigners Bill, which is (according to the
customs and usages of those parts, from which they will not by auy means
depart) sometimes only signed, sometimes sealed, sometimes both, but never
delivered, shall for want of this one formality of delivery at the Common Law,
prove void and of none effect, and so the English man become undone by
formalities of the English Laws, so far different from those of foreign
Nations, especially the Laws Maritime, which are for the most part, if not
altogether, agreeable in most places, if not in all. Many more reasons might be
given, why all contracts of this nature wheresoever made, should and ought to
be tried in the Admiralty Court, by the Civil and Maritime Laws, and not by the
Municipal Laws of this Nation; and many instances more might be given, wherein
the Civil and Maritime Laws (which are Common to all Nations) do differ from
the Municipal Laws of this, and so would vary the Judgments in Causes of the
self same nature: But that is too large a task to undertake here, and but a
needless one, when some few instances may satisfy a wise man that intends not
to quarrel. I shall endeavor here in a word to satisfy but one doubt by the
way, and so proceed (according to the best of my judgment) to the answering the
Arguments brought against the Admirals cognizace of these Contracts. It is
objected that other Nations have their several Municipal Laws as well as
England; and that therefore these Contracts may as well be tried by the
Municipal Laws of this Nation, as by any Municipal Law of another. I answer
that they have in several Nations, several different Municipal Laws, whereby
they are governed within themselves, as we are here; yet are those Municipal
Laws all grounded upon the Civil Law, and are no more different one from
another, then one and the same lesson played upon several Instruments, in
several strains; nor do otherwise differ, then as the several Interpretations
of several men upon them have differed; as in many doctrinal points in Divinity
various constructions have been rendered, even upon the very text of the Divine
Law, according to several apprehensions and opinions of several men.

For upon all their decisions and determinations they quote the Civil Law, Sup.
lib. 2. c.
and the Authentic Writers and Commentators thereon, as is already said, li.
2. c.

And as the controversies happening and arising between one Nation and another,
are not to be decided by either of their Municipal Laws, that being a way to
raise a new controversy, by which of those Municipal Laws the old should be
decided; no more are those controversies which do arise concerning maritime and
sea affairs to be determined by those Municipal Laws, but by their Maritime
Laws, by which they trade one Nation with another, and which are generally the
same, and not Municipal, as is before more fully set forth. Sup. li. 2. c. 14.

CHAP. II.
The Arguments deduced out of the Statute of the 13 R. 2. c. 5. to prove that
Maritime Contracts, made at land concerning Maritime Affairs, are not tryable
in the Admiralty Court, answered.
FOr the taking away the cognizance of Contracts made at land concerning
Maritime affairs from the Admiralty Court, the Statute of the 13 of R. 2. c. 5.
the 15 of R. 2. c. 3. and the 2 of H. 4. c. 11. Coke li. 4. instit. cap. 22.
are urged by Sir Edward Coke in his before mentioned 22th Chapter of his
Jurisdiction of Courts. I shall take them in order.

The first of them he renders thus, Coke li. 4. instit. cap. 22.
that the Admirals and their Deputies shall not meddle from henceforth with any
thing done within the Realm of England, but only with things done upon the sea,
according to that which has been duly used in the time of the noble King
Edward, Grandfather to Richard the second; by which, says he, it is manifest
that the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty is only confined to things done upon the
Sea. And truly taking only these words, it may very well seem so to be. Sed
tota lex in omnibus suis partibus diligenter prospicienda est, (...)
and incivile est (inquit Celsus) nisi tota lege prolecta, de una aliqua
particula ejus proposita judicare, vel respondere. Take we then the Statute
wholly, as it is set down in the Parliament Roll in the Tower, (...)
and then to the best of my understanding, we shall find that the
mis-translation has bred a mis-construction, and wrong interpretation thereof.

These ancient Statutes were made by way of Petition and Answer, and so remain
still upon the Roll; here is set down only the Answer to the Petition, but not
one word of the Petition, to which the answer has relation. Et cum non sit
satis ad investigationem Juris si verborum superficiem teneamus, sed interius
respicienda est men's legislatoris, qua ratione motus fuerit ad statuendum
aliquid (ut affirmat (...)
Oldendorpius) loco praecitato. Certe nullo modo sunt vestiganda jura, si
verborum omnium ne quidem superficiem istam aut teneamus, aut habeamus, nec
quovismodo est intelligenda men's legislatoris, qua ratione motus fuit ad hoc
statuendum, dum abscondita sit petitio, super qua fundatur statutum. Scire
leges (inquit Celsus) non hoc est verba eorum tenere, sed vim and potestatem
habere. l. scire leges F. de legibus Quedcunque igitur negligere est legum vim
potestatemque destruere. F. de legibus l. scire leges.
I shall therefore first set down both the Petition and answer as I find them
in the Tower Roll, and then under correction examine the true construction and
interpretation of them, according to the best of my ability. The words are
these.

. The first part of the Petition, having set forth that the Admirals keeping
their Sessions in diverse places in the Realm, as well within the Liberties, as
without, had incroached to themselves greater power then belonged unto their
Office, etc. Then so much of the prayer of the Petition as is granted,
consists in these words.

Quils ne sic mellent nem pregnent sur eux conisances de nulls Contracts,

. They pray that the Admirals may not so meddle or encroach upon the Cognizance
of Contracts, Covenants, Regraters, etc. determinable before other the Kings
Judges, within the four Seas of England, within franchise and without the rest
of the Petition is not granted, but tacitly denied, and this part is thus
answered by the King.

Le Roy vort que les Admirals and lour Deputies ne soi mellent, etc.

This Sir Edward Coke positively without any relation to the Petition, renders
in the words before set down, viz. The Admirals and their Deputies shall not
meddle from henceforth with any thing done within the Realm of England, but
only with things done upon the Sea; which Poulton more truly rendereth thus;
but still without relation to the Petition, that the Admirals and their
Deputies shall not meddle from henceforth, of any thing done within the Realm,
but only of a thing done upon the Sea; rendering of, for with, which is the
more proper signification of de, and will as I conceive bring home the true
construction of the Answer, with relation to the Petition, to which it has,
and necessarily must have reference.

It has been affirmed unto me by some professors of the Common Law, that the
King upon a Petition never grants more then is desired by the Petition, and
that that which is granted more then is desired, is void in Law; but that I
leave to the determination of such as are of their own profession; but the same
thing has been noted unto me as a rule from many expert Recordmen, more
especially from my old deceased friend Master W. C. not long before his death,
then above 80 years of age, viz. that the King in Parliament never granted more
then was asked, many times less; who affirmed that this in his younger time he
had taken for a rule from those that were then ancient. But this Answer here
being set down positively alone, without the Petition, or any relation
thereunto, has (as it seems to me) made the Grant far larger then the
request, which must not be, but must be reduced thereunto, and receive a
Construction, with a due relation to it.

It being complained of in Parliament that the Admirals and their Deputies had
encroacht, as is before set forth; It is desired by the Petition that they and
their Deputies may not meddle with Contracts, Covenants, or Regraters, etc.
tryable before the other Judges; It is answered that henceforth they shall not,
of a thing done within the Realm, but of a thing done upon the Sea.

The Construction of the Answer, with relation to the Petition (which as I
humbly conceive must not be separated by any Logician) will plainly be this.

The Admirals and their Deputies shall not henceforth meddle with any
Contracts, Covenants, etc. of, or concerning any thing done within the Realm,
but only of Contracts, Covenants, etc. of, or concerning things done upon the
Sea: So that we plainly see an Answer to a Question, or Petition turned into a
positive Thesis, without relation to the thing, whereof it is an answer, is
easily turned into another sense never intended; And this answer to a Petition,
translated alone without the Petition, and put positively, as the translation
of the Statute puts it, does seem clearly to take away from the Admiral the
Cognizance of all Contracts, and Covenants whatsoever made within the Realm,
whereas taken with the relation to the Petition, it as clearly confirms the
Cognizance of Contracts of, or concerning things done at Sea unto him* For as
the answer to the Petition does grant that the Admiral shall not meddle with
Contracts of things done within the Realm, so does it reserve the Contracts and
Covenants of things done upon the Seas unto him; And the words as I said
before, can imply no other thing, to the best of my understanding.

For the following words, Solonc ce que ad estre dument use en temps du noble
Roy Edward aiel nostre sur le Roy quorust. Poulton (having thus translated the
Answer, without mention of any one word of the substance of the Petition)
renders barely thus: as it has been used in the time of the noble Prince King
Edward, Granfather of our Lord the King that now is: As if this positive
Thesis, by him extracted out of that, which was the King's Answer to a
Petition, and had only a relation thereto, had been so used in Edward the
thirds time, whereas the words are a restriction to the answer, and binds up
the Law to what was used in the Kings time; for Solonc; which in true French is
Seloon; signifies secundum or juxta, according or agreeable, so that if the
Answer could be taken positively without relation to the Petition (which as I
conceive it cannot be) yet these words Solonc ceque ad estre dument use, etc.
had restrained and limited it, not to exceed or extend it self to any thing
that was not according or agreeable to what was duly used in Edward the thirds
time: So that under correction, by that strained construction and
interpretation that is made of the former part thereof, the Admiral is not
barred the Cognizance either of Contracts, Covenants, or any thing else, which
he had Cognizance of in that Kings reign. Take that part of the Petition
wholly, and the King wholly grants it, but no more.

By the Petition it is desired that the Admirals may not meddle, nor encroach
upon the Cognizance of Contracts, Covenants, Regraters, etc. cognizable before
the other Judges; the King grants it, putting a difference between the
Contracts, etc. of things done at Land, and of things done at Sea, and by this
restriction refers to what Covenants, Contracts, Regraters, etc. were duly
used and tried in the Admiralty in Edward the thirds time, and those he
thereunto reserveth the Cognizance of, but no other. And now it comes to be
mainly considered, whether Contracts and Covenants of and concerning Maritime
businesses, though made at Land, were cognizable in the Admiralty Court, or at
the Common Law in Edward the thirds time.

And it seems plain unto me that in Edward the thirds time, the Admiral had
the Cognizance of all Maritime Causes, by the words of their Patents. I will
give but one instance of the Patent of Robert Herle, Sup. l. 1. cap. 1.
already cited, in which you shall find these words: Dantes ei plenam tenore
praefentium potestatem, querelas omnium and singul^rum de his quae offieium
Admiralli tangunt, and cognoscendi in causis maritimis, and justitiam faciendi,
etc. Now if Bills of Botomery (whereby Ships only are liable to the payment of
the debt contracted upon them) though contracted for at land, or if freight for
the service of Ships at sea, or Mariners wages, for their service at sea
likewise, for which either the Ships or Contracters are liable at the parties
Agents choice, though the said Contracts were made at land; and the like
businesses which have their first rise from somewhat done at sea, are not
maritime causes I would gladly know what causes can be called maritime: for
sure I am, that maritimus is either (...). that which is on the Sea coast, or
nearest the Sea, which the French render ou demeure aupres ou sur le board de la
mer; and the Spaniard cerca de la mar. Or it is (...), belonging to the sea,
take which signification of the word you will, and the before mentioned causes
will be causae maritimae; if for on the Seacoast, or near the Sea, then the
Contracts in such causes, though they he made at land, are made on the
Seacoast, in the Sea Town, or near the Sea: If for belonging unto the Sea,
then these Contracts (wheresoever they are made) are made for things to be
agitated and done at sea, and for things that cannot be done without the sea;
and such Contracts they are, that if the sea was not, would never have been
made; and therefore these Contracts must necessarily belong unto the sea, and
so must those causes which arise from them; and must as necessarily be those
causae maritimae, which the Admiral is to take cognizance of. And I am
confident that it cannot be showed, that the Common Law had any cognizance of
these or the like causes in Edward the Thirds time; or that these or such like
causes, were the causes wherein the Admirals are said then, or after, to have
encroacht upon the Kings Courts: Nor that the Common Law had then, nor has yet
any positive Laws, rules, or grounds for the decision of causes of this nature.
And clear enough it is, that even in Edward the Thirds Reign (to which this
Statute has reference) many Laws and rules were confirmed, and many made for
direction of the Admiral in the decision of Causes of this nature (as by
several ancient Records shall hereafter appear) by which I doubt not but that
it will evidently appear, Inf^a cap. proxim. and sequent.
that the cognizace of these Contracts concerning Maritime affairs, wheresoever
made, were then duly used in the Admiralty Court, and did properly thereunto
belong.

CHAP. III.
That by the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty, and by the Laws of Oleron, it
appears that Contracts made at land of and concerning Maritime affairs, were
cognizable and tryable in the Admiralty both before, and even in the time of
Edward the Third, whereunto the last mentioned Statute makes reference.
IF Contracts and Covenants of and concerning Maritime businesses made at land
were cognizable in the Admiralty in Edward the Third's time, Stat. Rich. 2. 13.
5.
then does the last before mentioned limitation of the Statute of the 13th of
Rich. 2. 5. continue them tryable there still, taking the construction of the
Statute to be with relation to the Petition, or without.

But before that I go about to show that they were then cognizable there, I
shall make it first appear, that they were there triable long before his time,
and so come to the cognizance of them in his time.

In the beginning of that ancient authentic book, called the black Book of
the Admiralty, whereof I have formerly made mention, in which all things
therein comprehended are engrossed in Vellam, in an ancient character, which
has been from time to time kept in the Registry of that Court, for the use of
the Judges of the Admiralty successively (and is as free from suspicion of
being corrupted or falsified, as the Records of any Court whatsoever) are set
down the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty, with directions how, in what
manner, and of what things every Admiral shall enquire, at every Port, and
Haven, after his being made high Admiral: Where amongst other things, I find an
Ordinance made by Edward the First, at Hastings, as is plain, by the Ordinance
it self, whereby all Stewards, and Bailiffs of Mannours, upon the Seacoasts
are forbidden to meddle with any plea, or try any cause whatsoever, touching or
concerning any Merchant or Mariner, whether by deed or charter party of Ships,
or other things, amounting to the sum of 20, or 40 Shillings. The words are
these.

Item, Li. nigro Admirallitatis, p. 29.
ordonne estoit a Hastings par le Roy Edward le primer and ses seigneurs que
coment diverse seigneurs avoient diverses franchises de trier plees ou Ports,
que leur seneschaulx ne Baliffs, ne tendroient null plee sil touch Merchant ou
Mariner tant par fait come par chartre de nefs Obligations and autres faitz
comment la sum amont que a xx s, ou a xl s, and saucun est endite quil a
faite le contrare and de ce soit convict, il avera mesme le Judgment come
desus est dit. They that shall do to the contrary, and shall be thereof
convict, they shall have the same Judgment as is aforesaid, which is a years
imprisonment, set forth in the next preceding Article, for a Mariners breaking
an arrest, made upon him, for to serve the King in any Ship.

And the same Ordinance concludes this: Item chu^n contract fait enter
Merchant and Merchant, ou Merchant ou Mariner outre la mer ou dedens le Flod
marks sera try devant l' Admiral and nemient ailleurs par lordonannce dudit
Roy Edward, and ses seigneurs. Also every Contract of a thing done between
Merchant and Merchant, Merchant or Mariner, beyond the Seas, or beneath the
Flood mark, shall be tried before the Admiral, and nowhere else, by the
Ordinance of the said King Edward and his Nobles.

And in another thick covered Book with great Brass Bosses, kept in the
Registry of the said Court, wherein are set down some things of Antiquity, and
likewise some things of latter times, I find this very Ordinance set down in
express words, agreeing both with the former part and with the Addition
thereunto.

Wherein I likewise find an Article of Enquiry in Latin, containing the whole
substance of this very Ordinance, in these words: Item inquiratur de hiis
seneschallis and ballivis quorumcunque Dominorum per costera maris Dominia
habentium, qui tenent, vel tenere usurpent aliquod placitum mercatorum vel
marinarum concernens, excedens summum quadraginta solidorum; paena qui inde
presentati fuerint and super hoc convicti paenam quinque librarum and judicium
subibunt, and haec est Ordinatio Edwardi primi, apud Hastings regni sui Anno
secundo.

Item quod quilibet contractus initus and factus inter Calcatorem and
Mercatorem, Marinarium, aut alies ultra mare, sive intra fluxum maris, vel
refluxum vulgariter dictum Fludd mark erit triatus and terminatus, coram
Admirallo and non alibi per Ordinationem praedictam.

And by an Inquisition, Rough. Ar. 38.
long since translated out of an ancient French Copy into Latin, by one
Roughton, and Engrossed in the said black Book, I find this whole Article in
the self same words, save that instead of these words paenam quinque librarum
and judicium subibunt, the words are these: Eandem paenam ut super and judicium
subibunt: which agrees with the Ordinance it self, which refers to the
punishment in the preceding Article thereunto: which punishment is (as is set
forth before) a whole years Imprisonment.

Now that this Ordinance and this Article only forbids Stewards, Sup. li.
1. c. 2.
and Bailiffs of Mannours, for meddling with such Maritime Contracts, and
Causes, it is because that at that time, there were no other Courts that could
encroach upon the Admiralty; for the King's Bench was not settled in any constant
place, but followed the King, wheresoever he went; and the Justices in Air,
and Justices of Assize being Itinerantes, and sometimes at home, and sometimes
in their Circuits, and somerimes in one place, sometimes in another, and so in
no certain place, and least of all in any Ports, or Haven Towns, never did nor
could take Cognizance of Maritime Contracts, or Causes, which always required a
most sudain dispatch* and could not expect their uncertain coming; nor was the
Court of Common Pleas then settled; for it was resolved to be settled in some
constant place, but in the 9th. year of Hen. the 3. all which will appear, by
what I have formerly set down.

Now that these Contracts and Covenants concerning Maritime affairs, Seunda
pars hujus Capitis.
though made at Land, were continued cognoscible in the Admiralty Court, in
Edward the 3. time, as well as before, will likewise plainly appear thus.

The Laws of Oleron, Super li.
which were brought into this Kingdom by Richard the 1. were absolutely and
completely settled, and established in this Nation by Edward the 3. in the 12
year of his reign, as will plainly appear by that ancient Record of the Tower,
Entitled, De Articulis super quibus etc. Anno Regni Regis Edward 3. 12. which
is already set down, which I will here repeat, because I will not turn you back
to the other place, being there made use of to another purpose.

Item ad finem quod resumatur and continuetur ad subditorum prosecutionem,
forma procedendi quondam ordinata and inchoata per avum Domini nostri Regis,
and ejus concilium ad retinendum and conservandum antiquam superioritatem maris
Angliae, and nos officii Admirallitatis in eodem quoad corrigendum,
interpretandum, declarandum and conservandum leges and Statuta per ejus
antecessores Angliae Reges dudum ordinata ad conservandum pacem and justitiam
inter omnes gentes Nationis cujuscunque per mare Angliae transeuntes, and ad
cognoscendum super omnibus in contrarium attemptatis in eodem, and ad puniendum
delinquentes and damna passis satisfaciendum, quae quidem leges and Statuta per
dominum Richardum quondam Regem Angliae in reditu suo a terra sancta correcta
fuerunt interpretata, in insula Oleron publicata, and nominata in Gallica
Lingua, la ley Oleron.

These Laws thus brought in and thus established for the direction and use of
the Office of the Admiralty (as its plain they were by the very words of this
Establishment, Et nos Officii Admirallitatis in eodem, etc.) were many of them
of no use at all, if the Admiral had not, at, and after the time of the
bringing of them in, or were not at, and after the time of the settlement
thereof, to have had the Cognizance of Contracts and Covenants made at Land, of
and concerning Maritime affairs; for many of them do set forth and declare,
what Judgment is to be given by the Admiral upon such Covenants and Contracts;
and the very first Judgment sets forth in what case the Master of a Ship,
(being come to a strange Port) may there sell the Ship, and in what case he may
not, and in what case he may pawn some of his tackle, and in what not; all
which must needs be done by Contract or Covenant, and he must necessarily seek
his Chapman at Land, and not at Sea. And who should have the Judgment of such
contract, whether it be good, or a void contract, but the Admiral who has his
direction by these Laws, how to Judge, I know not. The words of the Judgment
are these.

Premierement leu fait ung homme Mastre d'une nef la nef est a deux hommes,
Oler. Judge. 1.
ou a trois la nefs, seu part du pais dout ille est and voyent a Bordeaux, ou a
la Rochelle ou alles, etc. se frette pour aler en pags estranges, le Mastre ne
puet pass vendre le nef sil na commandment ou procuration des Seigneurs, mais
sil a mestier de despens il puet bien mettre aucuns des apparilz exgaige par
conseil des compaignons da la nof and cest le Jagger en ce cas.

Again a Master of a Ship hyreth Mariners in the Town where the Ship is, and by
their Agreement, contract or covenant, some are to be at marinage, others at
whole pay in money, which done, the Ship can find no freight to go to the place
where the Master intended to go, and whether he hired his Mariners, but must go
further, or not so far. This no doubt is contracting and covenanting at Land
for a Maritime voyage, which cannot as I believe be by the common Law,
according to the Maritime Rules decided, nor has it any rule of it self to
Judge it by, whether any of the Mariners so hired are bound to perform this
new voyage or not, which if the professors thereof shall undertake, I much fear
that in this very first question they must judge clean contrary to the Laws of
the sea, or clean contrary to the grounds and principles of their own Law,
which are very good and very reasonable in the land affairs; Supr. li. (...)
secundo cap. 1, 2.
but the reason thereof will not hold in Maritime businesses, as I have said
before. And excellent Authors there be written by Civili^ns, which give exact
reasons of the differences of judgments in land businesses and sea affairs. 2.
Whether those that are hired at marinage, of those that are hired at full
deneirs are the rather bound to perform the Voyage. 3. Upon what terms those
that are freest are bound; and must perform the same. 4. What is to be done in
case the Voyage prove shorter or longer then that which was agreed for. The
Judgment upon these particulars is set down briefly in the 20th Judgment of
Oleron, and is by other Civil Law Authors amplyfied, L Oler. jud. 20.
with express reasons of every particular. The words of the Judgment in the
Laws of Oleron are these.

Vng Maistre dune nef love ses Mariners eu la ville don't la nef est les low
les ungs a Marinage les autres a deniers ilz veoient que la nef ne puet troun
fretts a venie en ses parties and leur cou^ient alzr and plus loing nes ceulz
qui vont a marinage la doivent servir, mais ceulx qui vont a deniers le maistre
est tenu a leur croistre leurs loyer veve par veve and corpse par corpse par la
raison qui les avoit lovez and a termine lieu and cliz vienne^t plus peers que
leux covenant la pris il doit avoir son loyer tout au lang, Oler. jud. 20
mais il doit aidera render la nef la ou illa prist se le maistre veult a la
venture de dieu, and cest le judgment en ce cas.

Other Judgments there be which determine in what cases the Master of a Ship
may sell part of his Merchants wines, or other goods, without breach of his
Charter-party or contract of a freightment, and in what case such his sale or
contract for such wines or goods (which must necessarily be made at land) shall
be good and sufficient in law.

And such cases as these the Admiralty adjudgeth sometimes at 1, 2, 3, or 4
hours warning, or in a very short time; for if such Cases should wait Terms or
Courts, many a Voyage would oftentimes be lost, to the extraordinary great
damage both of Merchants, Owners, Masters, and Mariners of Ships.

But for Contracts and Covenants between the Master of a Ship and his Mariners;
for their wages, some have thought them to be upon sufferance allowed by the
Common Law unto the Admiralty for the quick dispatch of Mariners, and they
should not be enforced to bring several Actions at that Law; but had it been at
the allowance or sufferance of that Law, another reason might have been added
of such their allowance or sufferance, viz. because these poor men seldom have
any money to expend in Suit, for obtaining of so small a sum, as commonly
their wages severally amounts unto, whereas in the Admiralty they are, and
always have been heard summarily without payment of one penny, for the Judges
extraordinary pains in the hearing, and determining causes of this nature; and
an Advocate expects but a single Fee from them all, be they never so many,
which oft-times amounts not to 2 d. a piece.

But we see plainly that such manner of Contracts belonged unto the Admiralty
Court by the Law established and confirmed in the twelfth year of Edward the
Third, and so did all Contracts and Covenants between Merchants and Masters,
and Owners of Ships for freight or the like.

A Master of a Ship lets a Ship to freight to one Merchant or more, and they
covenant and agree, that they shall so lade, that the Ship may be ready to
depart by a certain day, and they fail, and have not fully laden by that time,
so that the Master loses his time, and oft-times his weathering; this is a
Contract or Covenant made at land; yet has the Common Law no law or rule that,
ever I could learn, to judge the same by: 1. Whether in this place the Master
may contract with any other Merchant for a new freight, or not. 2. What lading
boarded firmeth the Contract, and holds it on, and what freeth it. 3. In case
the Contract be held firm, how many days after the term is expired, bring
the Merchants within the compass of the Law to make satisfaction. 4. What
satisfaction is to be made, and in what manner. 5. How such satisfaction being
made, the same is to be divided between the Master and the Mariners. And 6. How
such an accident firmeth or alters the Contract made between the Master and
the Mariners. If therefore in Sea affairs there were not Sea Laws and Rules to
limit and regulate such general Contracts, but that they should be held broken
for defect of performance of every particular circumstance at the Common Law,
very many and great inconveniences would follow in cases of this nature,
because as the land is more firm then the sea, so are not land businesses so
subject unto various events, as the sea affairs are, but are at a far more
certainty for the performance of particular circumstances, then the sea affairs
possibly can be; and yet it will not be denied, but that some Contracts made at
land concerning Land businesses, are against the Law, some void by Law, and
some must be regulated by Law, much more must such as concern Maritime affairs
be regulated by such Laws as are most proper for them, which are the Maritime
Laws; and if these Laws shall not be observed and followed in this Land and
Nation, Super. li. cap.
as well as in all others, the English Merchants, and the Enhlish Mariner and
Owners of Ships will be tied to such inconveniences as the Merchants, Mariners
and Owners of Ships of no other Nation are, to their extraordinary
disadvantage; but this is but a digression, which has been spoken of more at
large elsewhere, and therefore we will return to the matter.

As the 20th. Judgment of Oleron is set down for a guide and direction of the
Admiral and Judges of the Admiralty in the particular Contracts before
mentioned therein between Masters of Ships and Mariners; so does the 22.
Judgment set down a rule, to guide and direct them in the Judgment of
Contracts, and Covenants made between Merchants and Mariners, and Owners of
Ships in the case above specified, which is in some particulars of that case
plain enough, yet in all it cannot be perfectly understood, but by such
Civilians as are very well verst in other both ancienter and subsequent
Authors, who have wrote of the Maritime Laws; the words of this Judgment I
shall here set down.

Vng Mastre frette sa nef a ung Merchant and est devise enter eux and im's ung
term pour chargier la nef and les Mariners par le space de xv jours ou de plus
oultre and aucune foiz en pert le Maistre son fret, and sa mession par default
dung Merchant, Ol. Jud. 22.
le Merchant est tenu alamender, and in celle amend que sera faitte les
Mariners auront le quart and le Maistre les trois parties par la raison quil
trouve les costs and cest le Judgment en ce cas.

This Judgment is without question a plain direction to the Admiral and Judges
of the Admiralty, what to determine in some of the particulars above mentioned,
upon a Contract made at Land for freight of a Ship, which serves sufficiently
for my purpose, to prove that the Admiral and Judges of the Admiralty had both
before, and in Edward the 3. time (who in the twelfth year of his reign
established these Laws) Cognizance of Contracts made at Land between Merchants
and Mariners, and Owners of Ships for freight.

And to this Judgment, which shows what is to be determined in case of
freight, where the Merchant is in fault or delay, I shall add, and here set
down one Judgment more, which shows what is to be determined, when the
Mariner, or any of the Owners are in default or delay: As if a Merchant do take
to freight by Contract or Covenant, any Ship lying in any Port or Haven, and it
falls out that the Ship is stopped or stayed, through de^ault of the Mariner,
or any of his Owners, and how and in what manner this Contract or Covenant
holds, or holds not; and these are the words of the Judgment.

Item ordonne est and estably pour loy and custume de la mer que se ung
merchant a frette une nef eu quelque Port que se soit and a viengne que le nef
soit empeschee pour default du maistre ou du Seigneur a celliu a qui la nef est
le merchant qui avoit frette la nef puet requirra le maistre entelle maniere je
te requier que tu mettes mes biens ou mes denrrees en la nef and le maistre dit
que la nef est empeschee de par aucun Seigneur le Merchant qui avoit frette la
nef se puet partir du covenant and affrettment du dit maistre and affretter a
son choys ailleurs sans ce que soit tenu audit maistre de rien a mender, Ol.
Jud, 25.
and se le Merchant ne trouve frett il puet bien demander au Maistre ses
dommages pour la raison quil la mye tenuz ses Convenants and affrement dessus
ditz and le Maistre lui doit amender, and cest le Judgment en ce cas.

Several other Judgments there be, Ol. Jud. 26. jud. 29, and 30. judm. 31.
which (when a Ship is so taken to freight by any Merchant) do set forth
several duties to be performed, both on the Merchants part, and likewise on the
Masters and Mariners parts, which I shall not here set down, because it is not
my drift, or purpose to show what the Laws of the Seas are, but only to show
that by the Laws of Oleron established in Edward the 3. time, Contracts for
freight of Ships, and Mariners wages were cognoscible in the Admiralty Court,
and these Laws are left as guides and rules for the Admirals, and Judges of the
Admiralty to determine such causes by.

Hence it is plain to my understanding, that the Statute of Richard the 2.
though taken in the most general construction, without reference or relation
to the Petition (which I cannot by any means be drawn or persuaded to allow)
yet being restrained with this restriction Solonc ce que ad estre duement use
en temps du noble Roy ail nostre quorust, does no ways at all take away the
Admirals, or the Court of the Admiralties Cognizance of any thing whatsoever
was cognoscible before them, in Edward the 3s time, and so consequently does it
not take away the Cognizance of Contracts for freight, nor wages, nor are they
any of the encroachments complained of in the Petition, whereunto that Statute
is an answer.

And diverse other Judgments there be amongst these Laws of Oleron, which
determine Contracts made between the Masters of Ships and Pilots, or Loads-men,
whether the same be made at land or elsewhere, for the conducting of Ships into
Ports and Havens, or from one Port or place to another; I shall only quote some
two or three of them, and leave the rest.

Item se ung lodeman prent charge sur luy de amaner une nef en aucun port and
avient quen sa defaulte la nef soit perie, Oler. Jud. 33.
etc. marchandises endomagees, etc.

Item estably est pour custume de mer que se une nef est perdue par la defaulte
de une lodeman, Oler. Jud. 24. and 34.
etc.

Vng bachellor est lodeman de une nef and est love alamener jusquis au port ou
len la doit discharger, etc. And some others there be of the same nature.

And the ancient Statutes of the Admiralty and Laws of Oleron before mentioned,
established by the said King Edward the Third, in the 12 year of his Reign, Sup
^.
as is before declared, having settled the cognizance of such Contracts, and
Maritime Causes in the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, he grants the same to
his Admirals by their Patents (as appears by that Patent before mentioned,
Edw. 3.
granted unto Robert Herle in the 35 of his Reign.) But (as it seems) some in
those times having opposed, or at leastwise afterward interrupted this
settlement, the same King caused an Inquisition to be made at Quinborough, the
second day of April in the 49th year of his Reign, before William Latimer
Chamberlain of England, and Warden of the Cinque Ports, and William Nevill his
Admiral of the North, by near twenty of the most able and best skilled
seafaring men of several Port Towns of this Nation, of and concerning the
ancient customs of the Admiralty, Sup. li. 2. cap. 12.
to be held firm and continued according to their Verdict, as I have at large
set forth in the twelfth chapter of the second book of this Treatise.

I shall therefore proceed to show that by the said Inquisition, it plainly
appears, that Contracts made at land of and concerning Maritime affairs, were
in Edward the Third's time cognoscible and tryable in the Admiralty Court.

CHAP. IIII.
That by the Ancient Inquisition taken at Quinborough in Edward the Third's
time, it appears that the cognizance of Contracts made at land concerning
Maritime affairs belonged then and before unto the Admiralty Court.
IT has been an ancient Rule or Maxim amongst Merchants, Owners of Ships,
Masters of Ships, and all sorts of Mariners and Seamen, that Freight is the
Mother of Wages; therefore are the Mariners wages to be paid out of the freight
the Ship has earned; and the damages done to the Merchants goods by the
Mariners, or sustained through their negligence, is to be paid out of the
freight; and what is so paid out of the freight, is to be deducted out of their
wages; and by this rule all are necessarily cognoscible in one and the same
Court or Judicature; and the damage done at sea being cognoscible in the
Admiralty, and no where else, Sup. li. 3. ca. 1.
that cause must necessarily carry the other two along with it, both which are
likewise there tryable, both for this and diverse other reasons in the first
chapter of this third Book expressed. But I am likewise here to show, that by the
Inquisition taken at Quinborough in Edward the Thirds time for direction of the
Admiralty Jurisdiction, Sup. cap. of the second book.
as is already set forth, the same were both then and before cognoscible in the
Admiralty Court.

By the 14th Article of that Inquisition, if a Ship be let to freight for
several prices or rates of affreightment, the whole freight shall be cast up
rateably, and the Mariners paid out of the whole; so that the Admiralty is to
take cognizance of the several Contracts of affreightment made by the Merchants
before the lading of their goods, and to cause the Mariners to be paid their
wages they had contracted for before their entering into their service on
Shipboard, according to the said agreements of affreightment: the words of the
Article are these.

Item se une nef soit affreta a diverse pris de fretters lentier de tout laffret
sera account ensemble and les portages paiez aux mariners selon laffera^t du
fret de chu^n tonnel lun acompte come dit est droittement avec quis lautre.
Inq. apud Quin. capta art. 14.


Diverse rules there are in the Maritime Laws for direction, whether, and when
Mariners are to have their wages contracted for, when not, when all, when some
part thereof, and what part thereof, which are guided by the rates of payment
of freight. I shall instance but in one more out of this Inquisition, and that
shall be out of the very next article to that before set down, which follows
in these words.

Item une nef soit affrettee deurs quilque' lien quae soit and ait certain jour
limite de paiement de son fret en endenture, ou autrement les Mariners scront
paiez de la moitie de lieurs louyers a la charge de la nef, and de lautre
moitie quant mesme la nef sera venus en lien de sa discharge se le maistre ou
le seigneur de la nef ny veult come dit est avoir la nef lostel and de leure
serout ilz paiez quant la moitie du dit fret est receu. Inq. apud Quin. capta
art. 15.


It being plain then that this Inquisition was in. Edward the Third's time
taken for the direction of the Judicature of the Admiralty, it is as plain by
these Articles, that in his time the Admiral had cognizance of Contracts made
for freight of Ships and Mariners wages, wheresoever the said Contracts were
made; and then the Statute of Richard the Second, cap. 13. being shut up with
this clause of Solonc ce que ad estre duement use en temps du noble Roy Edward
ail nostre, does no ways take away the cognizance thereof from the Admiralty,
which is a thing I cannot too often repeat.

Neither rests this Inquisition here, but what matters were cogno^cible, and
to be determined before the Admiral by the Laws which I have in the former
chapter quoted out of the Laws of Oleron, and by diverse others of them, as well
as those there quoted, and by diverse other Articles in the foregoing part of
this Inquisition, being then fully settled and established. It is toward the
latter end of this said Inquisition provided, and care is thereby taken, that
neither those matters, nor any of that nature should be elsewhere in any other
Court meddled with: I shall only take two or three Articles together, which
appoint, that at all Admiralty Sessions enquiries shall be made of all such as
shall implead or sue any man in any other Court then the Admiralty, for any
matters or things there cognoscible or determinable, either by the foregoing
Laws or Articles, or otherwise: And those are the 51, 52, and 53 Articles of
this Inquisition, which follow in these words.

Item soit enquis de tous ceulx q' emple^^ent aueun home a la commune loy de la
tre' de chose appurtenant dancien droit a la loy marine. Inq. Quin. art. 51.


Item soit enquis de tous juges qui (...) et devant eulz aucuns plets
apappurtenants par droiture a la court de ladmiral^^. Inq. Quin. art. 52.


Item soit enquis de tous ceulz qui distourbent les lieutenants de ladmiral ou
autres ses ministers de fair duement execution de se^ mandements. Inq. Quin.
art. 53.


These Articles are not only for the enquiry of all such as have impleaded any
man at the Common Law of the land, for any thing appertaining of ancient right
unto the Maritime Law, but likewise of all such as have held before them any
pleas of right belonging unto the Court of the Admiralty, according to the Laws
of Oleron, and the several Articles of this Inquisition both settled and
confirmed in the time of his Reign: and to enquire of all such likewise which
have at any time disturbed the Lieutenants of the Admiralty, or any other of
the Ministers of the Court in the due execution of their Mandats and Warrants.

I might here proceed further to show that by that other Inquisition translated
out of old French into Latin by Roughton, and set down in the before mentioned
black book of the Admiralty, it likewise plainly appears that Contracts made
at land concerning Maritime affairs were then, or before that time tryable in
the Admiralty Court: For whether that Inquisition was taken in Edward the
Third's time, or before, does not appear, the same bearing no date, and in that
regard likely to be far more ancient: but because the same is in most
particulars agreeable with this Inquisition, Sup l. 2. ca. 10.
and in regard I have touched upon it already in the chapter where I have
argued the self same matter from the Laws of Oleron, I shall here pass it over,
and pass unto the other Statutes which are instanced in against the cognizance
of matters of this nature in the Admiralty Court.

CHAP. V.
The Argument deduced out of the Statute of the 15 of R. 2. cap. 3. to prove
the Contracts made at land concerning Maritime affairs, are not cognoscible in
the Admiralty Court, answered.
I Am now come unto the second Statute urged by Sir Edward Coke, against the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, which howsoever he took to be plain for his
purpose, yet well weighed, and rightly considered from the original, in my
judgment, makes clearly against it, Sup. cap. 2* hujus lib.
and confirms the construction I have made of the Statute of the (...) of Ric.
2. in the second chapter of this Book.

I shall first set down the Statute it self, as he renders it, then as Poulton
translateth it; and lastly as the original truly has it, which is worthy the
observing; and then come to set forth the true meaning and sense thereof,
according to my best understanding.

And first it is by him thus rendered, Coke li. 2. inst. cap. 22.
That the Court of the Admiral has no manner of Cognizance, Power nor
Jurisdiction of any manner of Contract, Plea or Querele, or of any other thing
done, rising within the Bodies of the Counties, either by Land, or by Water,
and also of wreck, of the Sea: But all such manner of Contracts, Pleas and
Quereles, and all other things rising within the bodies of the Counties, either
by Land, or by Water, as is aforesaid, and also wreck of the Sea, shall be
tried, termined, discussed, and remedied by the Laws of the Land, and not
before, nor by the Admiral nor his Lieutenant in no manner. Nevertheless of the
death a man, and of mayme done in great Ships, being and hovering in the main
stream, in the great Rivers, only beneath the points of the same Rivers, and
in no other place of the same Rivers, the Admiral shall have Cognizance.

In the ancient Statutes, which were made by way of Petition and answer,
Poulton in his Collection of Statutes, generally sets forth the Petition by
way of Preface to the body of the Statute, which he deduceth out of the answer,
which in all Statutes which concern not one Jurisdiction and another, he has
done plainly and well enough, in the most, and yet not in all.

The same method and order he has not observed in the Translation of these
before mentioned Statutes, which concern the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty,
wherein he, or some other whom he has followed, has not dealt so fairly in my
judgment, as he has done in the translating and collecting of the rest; as
may well be observed by comparing them with the Originals; he renders this
Statute thus.

At the great and grievous complaint of all the Commons made to our Lord the
King, in this present Parliament, for that the Admirals and their Deputies do
incroach to them diverse Jurisdictions, Franchises, and many other profits
pertaining to our Lord the King, and to other Lords, Cities and Buroughs,
besides those they were wont or ought to have of right, to the great
oppression, and impoverishment of all the Commons of the Land, and hinderance
and loss of the Kings profits, and of many other Lords, Cities, and Buroughs
through the Realm; It is Declared, Ordained, and established, that of all
manner of Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels, and of all other things done, rising
within the bodies of Counties, as well by land as by water, and also wreck of
the sea, the Admirals Court shall have no manner of cognizance, power, nor
jurisdiction; but all such manner of Contracts, Pleas, and Quarells, and other
things rising within the bodies of Counties, as well by land as by water (as
before) and also wreck of the sea, shall be tried, determined, discussed and
remedied by the Laws of the land, and not before, nor by the Admiral, nor by
his Lieutenant in any wise; nevertheless of the death of a man, and of a maim
done in great Ships, being and hovering in the main stream of great Rivers,
only beneath the Bridge of the same Rivers nigh to the Sea, and in no other
places of the same Rivers, the Admiral shall have cognizance, and also to
arrest Ships in the great Flotes, for the great Voyages of the King, and of the
Realm, saving always to the King all manner of forfeitures and profits thereof
coming; and he shall also have jurisdiction upon the said Flotes, during the
said Voyages, Stat. 15 R. 2. cap 3.
only saving always to the Lords, Cities and Boroughs their Liberties and
Franchises.

As for the exposition of this Statute made by Sir Edward Coke, I shall onl^
leave it to be considered how it varyeth from Poultons, and both vary from the
Original, aiming, as I cannot but believe, at their own ends, when meeting
together in substance, will, being rightly considered, conclude one and the
self same thing.

But having here challenged Mr. Poulton, or him whom he has followed, that he
has not dealt so fairly in the Translation of these Statutes, as he has in
the Translation of the other, I shall here show how, and wherein he has
mis-translated the same, before I proceed any further.

My first challenge is, that in the Praeamble to the first of these two recited
Statutes, he affirms that there was a great and common clamor and complaint,
Stat. 13 R. 2. cap. 5.
which had been oftentimes made before that time, etc. whereas there is mention
of no one word thereof in the Petition, which denotes any manner of clamor,
but only a modest complaint of things done by the Admiralty Courts, which
indeed ought not to have been done, as plainly appears by the Petition it
self, Sup. cap. 2. hujus lib. 3.
and the answer thereunto set down before: But it is a thing merely invented in
disgrace of the Admirals Jurisdiction. And secondly, that there is, as I showed
before, left out the whole Prayer of the Petition, both that part which was
granted, and that which was not granted, by which means he would wrest and set
awry, as I conceive, the sense and meaning of the Statute. Thirdly, that in the
Preamble to this Statute, as in the former, it is said it was made at the great
and grievous complaint of all the Commons, made unto our Lord the King, etc.
whereas there is mention of no one word which denotes either great or grievous
complaint in the Petition; but is only inserted as the other words were in the
former Statute. Other things that were in this Petition, are not set forth in
the Praeamble of the Statute, which I shall not question, because I do not find
that they were granted, but tacitly denied: and therefore shall proceed to the
Petition and Answer, as they stand in the Parliament Roll in the Tower, out of
which this Statute is deduced. And these be the words.

The translations of the fore part of this Statute (the praeamble excepted)
though they do somewhat differ one from another, and both in some sort from the
original, yet in matter of substance they may very well be brought to the same
meaning and construction. This Statute was made within two years next after
that of the 13th of Richard the Second, when the true meaning thereof rendered
with the relation unto the Petition (according to the custom of those times
when all Statutes were so made, viz. by petition unto the King, and his answer
thereunto) was not forgotten; and had that of the 13th of Richard the Second
born that construction Sir Edward Coke has since made of it, the Petition
whereon this of the 15th of Richard the Second is founded, need never have, nor
ever had been made (I am confident) but these Western Petitioners from whence
all these Petitions came, and not from so general and common a clamor as
Poulton makes it, as plainly appears by the Records cited by Sir Edward Coke
in his 22th chapter of the Jurisdiction of Courts, toward the end thereof,
under this title therein ( Addition of some Records of Parliament) not being
satisfied concerning the plain meaning of the former Act, pray now that the
Admirals and their Deputies may bring into the Parliament their claim of
Jurisdiction, Franchise and Profits, which they claim to belong unto their
Office, so that the declaration of their claim being made in writing in this
present Parliament, that may be reserved unto them, which shall belong unto the
said Admiral, and no more; so that whether this part of the Petition concerning
the Admirals giving in their claim in writing unto the Parliament, was granted
or tacitly denied; or whether they gave in any such claim or not, does not
appear, but it does plainly enough appear unto me, that upon this Petition, a
true construction and exposition of the said former Statute is made, which is
multo magis contemporanea expositio, then that exposition made of it, by the
first Judgment given after twenty years at the Common Law against the Admirals
power and jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens, which Sir Edward Coke cites
in his said 22th chapter of his Jurisdiction of Courts, Coke Jurisd. of Courts,
cap. 22.
and calls optima quia contemporanea, this then must therefore be melior
expositio then his, Sup. cap. 5. l. 2.
and his not optima, which Judgment is more at large handled and treated of
before. Now the Exposition of that Statute of the 13th of Richard the Second,
Sup. cap. 2* hujus lib. 3.
made by this part of the Statute of the 15th of the same King, is not
disagreeable to the construction I have made thereof in the second chapter of
this Book, and is, as I conceive, absolutely in affirmance thereof, being so
expounded. Which Exposition, as I have there said before (being taken with
relation to the Petition, and joining them both together as they ought to be)
rendereth it self thus. The Admiral shall not meddle with any Contracts,
Covenants, etc. of or concerning a thing done within the Roylm. This says
plainly that of all manner of Contracts, Pleas and Quarrels, and of all other
things done, arising within the bodies of Counties, etc. the Admiral shall have
no manner of cognizance, etc. But they shall be tried, etc. by the Laws of the
land, and in this both Translations in substance made of this part of this
Statute by Coke and Poulton, agree with the original, which says de touts
manners, contracts, plees and quereles, and touts auters chooses sur dantz deins
les corpse de counties, etc. la Court la Admiral eit nulle manner' cognizance,
etc. Only here they would both purposely pare off (though to little purpose)
the letter a from the word arising,, and translate sourdantz, rising; somewhat
to blind the true signification, and make the word that imports most, signify
little or nothing, or at least not to be taken notice of: But let it be
arising, or rising, do but take notice of it, and then the Contracts and
Covenants that the Admiral is forbidden to meddle with, are the Contracts and
Covenants of or concerning things done within the Realm, says the first of
these two Statutes; and Contracts, Pleas, Quarrels, and other things done
arising within the bodies of Counties, says the other; for so signifies the
word surdantz. So that Contracts and Covenants, etc. of or concerning
businesses done at sea, the Admiral is not forbidden to deal with, or take
cognizance of, nor of Contracts, Covenants, etc. from them arising, no nor of
things done within the bodies of Counties, which have relation to the Sea, or
to Navigation, or do from thence arise, is the Admiral forbidden the
cognizance, but has full power and jurisdiction over the same, not at all in
my apprehension restrained by either of these two Statutes.

Now Charter parties, or other Contracts for freight or wages, tackling,
furnishing, or victualling of Ships, etc. cannot be said to be Contracts, or
Covenants of or concerning things done within the Realm, or arising from things
done, or to be done within the bodies of Counties, though they be there made,
but are Contracts, or Covenants of, or concerning Maritime businesses, done, or
to be done at Sea, and arising from such things, as are there done, or to be
done, which be the finales causae of such Contracts, from whence all actions,
or motions do arise; a fine omnis oritur actio; It is causa causarum and
impellit efficientem ad agendum, and praescribit destinatis ordinem ad agendum.

The Transportation of men, Merchandises, Wares and Commodities of all sorts,
from one Kingdom or Nation to another, or from one Port to another by Sea (a
thing not to be done within the Realm, or within the body of a County) is the
finis, or finalis causa, from whence all Contracts; or Covenants, for freight,
wages, tackling, furnishing, and victualling of Ships do arise; such Contracts
and Covenants are therefore by these very Statutes, in my opinion, cognoscible
and tryable in the Admiralty Court, and no where else.

If Bargains, Contracts, or Covenants for Land, Houses, Leases, Money, or other
Land Commodities, be made upon the high Sea, and the Deeds, Bonds, Bills, or
other Writings be there signed, sealed and delivered, here the Construction of
both the Statutes will be, that though the Bargains, Contracts, Covenants, etc.
were made at Sea, yet they were of, and concerning things done, or to be done
at Land, within the bodies of Counties, and so cognoscible and tryable by the
Law of the Land, which is true enough; and then certainly in Contracts and
Covenants made at Land of, or concerning things done, or to done at Sea, or
arising from things there done, or to be there done, the same Statutes ought to
be afforded the same Construction and Interpretation.

And had not this word Surdantz arising, cleared this Construction upon this
Statute, yet would the Law it self have avoided that Construction which has
been made of the other. For as in Land affairs, by Law every man is to be
understood, to have contracted in that place, where that which is contracted
for, is to be performed; So in Sea affairs does the same Law and Rule hold; and
in this point, F. de obl. and act. l. contraxisse.
the Law is clear, Contraxisse unusquisque in eo loco intelligitur in quo ut
perficeret se obligavit. F. de obligat. and actionibus, l. contraxisse; F. de
bonis a^ab. jud. poss.
ad hoc etiam facit lex, aut ubi F. de bonis authoritate jud. poss. and l.
haeres Sect. finali. F. de judiciis; F. de jud. l. haeres.. sin.
and l. 65. F. de judiciis. And this point is further amplified, Nam locus
contractus is propre dicitur non in quo instrumentum fuit conscriptum, F. eodem
l. 65. Decis. sen. Dolani per Grevellum decis. 91. n. 8.
sed in quo conventio suam in se recepit perfectionem. Decis. Senatus Dolani
per Grevellum Decis. 91. n. 8.

The Master or Owner of a Ship does Contract with the Merchant, for so much
freight by the month, to transport his wares and merchandises by Sea; This
contract is to be understood by Law to have been made at Sea, where the Ship
served, and where so much money for so many months grew due; and the gloss
upon the before cyted Law, says, Cum essem Bononiae, promisi tibi dare centum
in Civitate Mutinae, and de hoc factus est contractus Bononiae, dicitur quod
possum conveniri Mutinae ad illa centum, quasi ibi videar contraxisse.

When I am at Bononia I promise to give you 100, at the City of Mutina, and
hereof a Contract is made at Bononia, yet may I be convented at Mutina for this
100, as if I seemed there to have contracted, so that I am subject to the
Jurisdiction of that City. So having contracted at London to transport any
thing at, or by Sea, at a certain rate by the month, I am subject to the
Maritime and Sea Jurisdiction. But it may be objected that fictio juris is
allowed in all Laws, and although a man be bound to pay money at one place, he
may be sued at another, and so a man being bound to transport goods, or perform
any other duty, or service at one place, yet he may per fictionem juris be
fained or presumed to have been bound to perform the same elsewhere, and so be
sued elsewhere. Sol. I answer that it is true, if my fiction be of a thing
possible, it may be allowed, as if I be bound to pay money at London, I may be
sued at York, because it is possible I might have been bound to have paid it
there; But if my fiction be of a thing impossible, it may not be allowed (for
impossibilities nature abhors) as if I bind my self to transport a Merchants
Goods, to some Port beyond the Seas, it is impossible I should do it by Land;
such a fiction, therefore that I have done it by Land, is not to be allowed;
nor am I for non performance subject to any land Jurisdiction. Out of the
grounds of this Argument might be deduced a far larger debate, which by reason
of the many differences between the Civil and Common Law in this point, would
be too tedious; I shall therefore insist no longer thereupon, but come to the
latter part of this Statute, viz. Nevertheless of the death of a man, and a
maihme, etc. which had been more properly inserted amongst the particulars
which concern the Admirals Jurisdiction upon the Ports and Havens; but being
here by Sir Edward Coke enforced all together, I cannot here let it pass
without the observation due unto it. He, as I showed before, Sup. hoc. cap.
in this chapter rendereth this part of the Statute thus: Nevertheless of the
death of man, and a maihme done in great Ships, being and hovering in the main
stream of great Rivers, only beneath the points of the same Rivers, and in no
other place of the same Rivers the Admiral shall have cognizance; excluding him
from his power of the death of a man, and a maihme, etc. of arresting Ships in
the great Flotes for the great Voyages of the King, or of the Realm, within the
Ports and Havens, Sup. hoc. cap.
which both the original Statute, and Poulton's Translation allows him, as
appears by what is already set down in this Chapter. And this only cognizance
of the death of a man, and a maihme (by this his rendering of the Statute) he
will allow the Admiral only beneath the points of these great Rivers, which the
original sets down Pontz, and Poulton's Translation rendereth Bridges.

All that is beneath the points of great Rivers (it is well known, and has
always been accounted the main Sea; so that by this construction of this part
of the Statute, he has limited the Admirals Jurisdiction to the death of a man
only, and a maihme, and arresting of great Ships, etc. and that upon the main
Sea only, and will not allow him either Contracts or Covenants made at land,
of, or for businesses there done, nor the cognizance of any thing done upon the
Havens; but howsoever after this his construction of this word, he presently
with one and the same breath, somewhat contradicts himself; for in his very
exposition of this clause, he says thus: This latter clause gives the Admiral
jurisdiction in case of death and maihme (with neither of which we ever meddle)
but with all other things happening within the Thames, or any other River,
Port, or Water, which are within any County of the Realm, so that the
cognizance of this death and maihme, which before was allowed the Admiral only
beneath the points, is now acknowledged never to have been meddled with at all
by the Judges of the Land, though done upon the Thames, or any other River or
Port, but only other things there happening; but how duly that was done, has
been before examined upon his very proposal of these two Statutes, and what he
promises, shall appear afterward; he apprehended that all men must needs
grant (which proves far otherwise) that the Admiral has no jurisdiction or
power upon the Ports and Havens, more then what this Clause gives him, and
therefore says he, this Clause gives the Admiral further jurisdiction in case
of death, or maihme; and indeed by these words: Nevertheless of the death of a
man, and a maihme done beneath the bridges; It may at the first reading seem
that the Admiral should be before forbidden to meddle with the cognizance of
any thing else there, and that the cognizance of these things should only be
reserved unto him, which withal would seem very strange; and therefore more
duly weighed and considered, this word Nevertheless does not restrain the
Admiral to these particulars only, viz. the death of a man, and a maihme, and
arresting of Ships, etc. but the Statute ordaining immediately before, that all
Contracts, Pleas and Quarrels, and all other things arising within the bodies
of Counties, as well by land as by water, shall be tried by the Law of the
Land, lest the waters beneath the first Bridges should be taken to be within
the bodies of Counties, and the Admiral, by the words (as well by land as by
water) should be excluded from his cognizance of things there done, under that
General of as well by land as by water, falls this exception or limitation,
Nevertheless beneath the Bridges next unto the Sea, pluis procheyn al mere, (by
them distinguishing the waters within the bodies of Counties, from those that
are not within the bodies of Counties) the Admiral shall have cognizance of
matters even of the highest nature, and greatest concernment, even of the death
of a man, and a maihme, arresting of Ships, etc. not exclusive, excluding him
from the cognizance of matters of an inferior quality and nature; for by the
Arugument a majore ad minus, he that has power in the weightiest affairs, has
certainly power in matters of less consequence, and smaller concernment; and it
does seem strange to me, that any man should think that the makers of this
Statute (whom Sir Edward Coke affirms to be curious therein) should trust the
Admiral with the cognizance of the death of a man, and a maihme, etc. where
they should not trust him with the sinking or maihming of a Ship or Vessel, ot
of the cognizance of the pilferings, or stealing of a Cable, or some such petty
trifle: and it may as well be said that the Admiral by this Statute has power
to arrest Ships in the great Flotes for the great Voyages of the Commonwealth,
but he has no power to arrest the Ships, Guns, Boats, Tackle, or Furniture; or
that when he has arrested such Ships, he has no power to press Mariners, or
to take up Victual, Tackle, Furniture, or Ammunition for them; and how
agreeable to reason (whereon all Laws ought to be grounded) this is, I leave it
to the judgment of all men; and though this arresting of Ships may be said to
be of no matter of cognizance, yet is there the same reason of the one, there
is of the other.

Yet of matters cognoscible by the Admiral, it may be questioned, why these two
particulars, namely the death of a man, and a maihme should only be specified,
and nothing in general be expressed, for the cognizance of other things there
done, if the same were intended him, Ratio est in promptu. Sir Edward Coke
could not say, nor can I believe any man else, or show that before the making
this Statute, the Common Law Courts ever took cognizance of any matters
concerning Ships, or other Vessels, their Tackle, Furniture, Ammunition, or
whatsoever else to them belonging or appertaining, but always left them to the
cognizance of the Admiral, as matters belonging to the Sea, and so proper to
the Sea Jurisdiction; but for the death of a man, and a maihme, which
oftentimes happen above the first Bridges (where Ships neither do, nor can come
conveniently) whereof the Common Law had cognizance, and not distinguishing of
such death or maihme, whether the same was done above or beneath the said
bridges, they had unduly taken cognizance thereof, as well beneath the bridges
as above, as appears by what Sir Edward Coke himself has cited in this his
22th chapter of his Jurisdiction of Courts; out of the 8th of Edward the
Second, tit. coron. 399. where it is affirmed, that it is no part of the Sea
where one may see what is done one of part of the water, and of the other, 8
^d. 2 tit. Coron. 399.
as to see from one land to the other; that the Coroner shall exercise his
Office in this case, and of this the County may have knowledge, whereby (says
he) it appears that things done there are triable by the Country (that is by
Jury) and consequently not in the Admiralty Court. Now by his leave, it only
appears that they would have made it law, that of the death of a man there,
which concerns the Coroners Office, they might take cognizance; and this
says he is affirmed for law by Stanford's Pleas of the Crown, lib. 1. fol. 51.
b. in these words, If one be slain upon any arm of the sea where a man may see
the land of the one part, Stan^. Pl. of the Crown. lib. 1. fol. 51. b.
and of the other, the Coroner shall enquire of this, and not the Admiral,
because the Country may take cognizance of it. And he voucheth the said
authority of the 8th of Edward the second, whereupon he concludes in these
words: so this proves that by the Common Law, before the Statute of the 2d. of
Henry the Fourth the Admiral had no jurisdiction but upon the high Seas, which
is no good conclusion, if well observed, as if it were impossble that the
Common Law could not by some men be mistaken and made to encroach upon the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, as the Admiralty is accused to have done upon
theirs; whereas here we see it plain in the 8th of Edward the Second, they had,
or would have done in this particular; and therefore in express words does this
Statute declare, that of the death of a man, and a maihme, the Admiral shall
have cognizance beneath the first bridges; let no man therefore from this of
the 8th of Edward the Second conclude that the Admiral has no Jurisdiction of
any thing done upon the Ports and Havens, or water, where one may see from one
side to the other, since that one particular from which a general is argued (an
argument never allowed amongst Scholars and Logicians) is by Statute corrected.

For the rest of the particulars, whereon Sir Edward Coke insisteth, he
instanceth not in any one before the making of these Statutes (saving that
before mentioned, and thus corrected by this Statute) nor of almost 30 years
after the making of the last of three, and well nigh 40 y^ars after the making
of the first of them; for it will be found to be little less then 30 years from
the second of Henry the Fourth, to the sixth of Henry the 6. and little less
then 40 from the 13th of Richard the Second, to the 6th of Henry the Sixth, in
which year the first Judgment is said to be given in the Court of
Common Pleas, upon these Statutes, which Sir Edward Coke affirms to be within
20 years of the making of the Statutes; and therefore his first observation
upon the Judgment, raised from this mistaken ground is, Sup. li. 2. ca. 5.
that it is contemporanea expositio, which he says is expositio optima, as is
said before, to which I may without danger agree and consent; for I shall in
the next chapter save one show that there is expositio magis contemporanea,
Ins. cap. 7. li. 3.
and will not very well agree either with this, or any other of these latter
Expositions of those Statutes; and what is inferred upon this Judgment by Sir
Edward Coke, Sup. li. 2. ca. 5.
that it depended in advisement and deliberation, in the Court of Common Pleas
eight Terms, as is before repeated, will clearly take away what is both by
Stanford and himself affirmed in general, upon that one particular, of the
Coroners taking his Inquest upon the death of a man upon the water, where one
may see from the one side to the other, by that of the eighth of Edward the
Second, namely that it appears, that by the Common Law before the Statute,
things done there were tryable by the Country (that is by Jury) and not i^ the
Admiralty Court; for if this had been so clear as both these two would make it,
then needed not the Judges of the Common Pleas have advised or deliberated two
days upon that point, wherewith they were troubled two years; which long
deliberation and advisement plainly shows, that they were at first very loath
to adventure themselves upon the seas (though at a Port) where they had never
been before, yet at length they adventured, but truly, without any offense be
it said, in a rotten Barque, without either Pilot or Stearsman, as I conceive
such a Voyage has seldom been taken since, until Sir Edward Coke's time,
immediately after which some have followed his Barque or Vessel, and will so
continue, if their Voyage be not stopped. But I shall proceed unto the next
Statute, leaving that point of the cognizance of wreck of sea in this Statute
mentioned (which is a thing that concerns not Contracts, etc. about Maritime
affairs made at land) unto a chapter by it self.

CHAP. VI.
The Argument deduced out of the Statute of the second of Henry the Fourth,
cap. 11. to prove the Contracts made at land concerning Maritime affairs, are
not cognizable in the Admiralty, redargued.
THe Statute of the 2d of Henry the Fourth is likewise urged against the
Admirals cognizance of Contracts and Covenants made at Land concerning Maritime
affairs, and has been usually recited in prohibitions with the other two.

This Statute is thus rendered by Sir Edward Coke. It is enacted (says he) that
the Act of the 13th of Richard the second, cap. 5. be firmly holden, and kept,
and put in due execution, and further at the prayer of the Commons, that as
touching a pain to be set upon the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, that the Statute
and the Common Law shall be holden against them, and the party grieved shall
recover his double damages.

For the first part of the Statute he apprehends that he has given a due
exposition of that of the 13th of Richard the second, by setting down the
answer to the Petition, without any relation to the Petition it self, and then
indeed this Statute to ordain that the former should be firmly holden, and
kept, and put in due execution, would have made somewhat to his purpose: But if
that first Statute be duly examined, and receive a due construction, then I
conceive this will no ways advance his cause. He further infers, that
because this Statute does ordain, as touching a pain to be set upon the
Admiral, or his Lieutenant, that the Statute and Common Law should be holden
against them; That therefore it appears by this Act, that the Statute of the
13th of Richard the second is but an affirmance of the Common Law, Cokes Juris
of Courts, cap. 22.
promises shall afterward appear, which I with much diligence in my reading
expected, but could find nothing more, then what (as I hope) has in its due
place received an answer. And if we examine the original Statutes, and
Poulton's Translation of this part of this Statute, they will plainly show what
Statute, and what Common Law shall be holden against them.

I shall therefore here set down the Statute according to the original, and
likewise Poulton's Translation thereof; and the original is by way of petition
and answer in these words.

Which Statute is by Poulton rendered thus.

Item, Whereas in the Statute made at Westminster, the 13 year of the said King
Richard* amongst other things, it is contained that the Admirals and their
Deputies shall not intermeddle, from hence forth of any thing done within the
Realm, but only of a thing done upon the Sea, according as it has been duly
used in the time of the Noble King Edward, Grandfather to the said King
Richard, our said Lord the King, wills and grants that the said Statute be
firmly holden and kept and put in due execution; and moreover the same our Lord
the King by the advice, and ascent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and at
the Prayer of the said Commons, has ordained and stablished, That as touching
a pain to be set upon the Admiral, as his Lieutenant, that the Statute, and
the Common Law be holden against them; and that he that feels himself grieved
against the form of the said Statute, shall have his action by Writ, grounded
upon the Case, against him that does so pursue in the Admiralty Court, and
recover his double damages against the pursuant, and the same pursuant shall
incur the pain of ten pounds to the King, for the pursuit so made, if he be
attainted.

Now it plainly appears by the Original, which I have here verbatim set down,
that this Statute is only in confirmation of the former Statute as originally
enacted, according to the true construction thereof, which taken together with
that exposition of the 15th. of Richard the 2. has truly rendered of that and
the same, being taken with relation to the Petition as I conceive it ought to
be, and by Sir Edward Coke and Poultons Translations here, it is in affirmance
of the first of them only, as Poulton himself has in his Translation thereof
rendered it; so that neither of these two Translations agree with the Original,
saving in this, that he that shall find himself aggrieved against the form
thereof, shall recover double damages against the pursuant.

Now what may be called Damages that shall be recovered double by this Statute,
is a great question: If a man do sue in the Admiralty Court, and there recover,
and is paid a just and due debt of 100 l. which he ought to have sued for in
the Common Law, and might have there surely recovered, the question whether the
other party can be said to be damni^^ed, that 100 l. over and above his
expenses and trouble; I cannot imagine any reasonable man will say he was. What
shall be thought then of the leading case, Hill. 6. H. 6. in the Common Pleas,
cited by Sir Edward Coke for the first that received Judgment in that Court
upon this Statute, of double damages, who says that Bartholomew Putt sued John
Burton in the Admiralty, for that he by force of arms, three Ships of the said
Bartholomews with his Prisoners and Merchandises to the value of 960 marks, odd
money, being in the said Ships, did take, and carry away, supposing the taking
to be super altum mare, whereas it was in the Haven of Bristow: whereupon the
said Burton sued the said Putt upon the Statutes, and a verdict was found for
the said Burton against the said Putt, and damages assessed unto 700 l. and
Judgment given double for 1400 l. In this place, I shall set aside the
Question, whether this case was proper to the Admiralty Court, or the Common
Law, having spoken to that purpose already in a place more proper; ^up. li. 2*
cap. 5.
and here only examine the question, concerning the damages, and them doubled.
It does not appear by any thing is said by Sir Edward Coke, that Putt had
either received from, or so much as recovered of the said Burton the said 900
marks, or any part thereof; and yet the said Burton is found thereto be
damnified the said 900 marks, besides 100 l. more for his expense and trouble,
all which is double by the Judgment; so that by this Judgment he was barred
and hindered any trial for his 900 marks, or whatsoever else he should prove
himself to be damnified, which no man can or could then say he was not to have
recovered in one of the said Courts, but was condemned to pay 1400 l. damages
to Burton, who was damnified nothing more then his expense, and some trouble in
a wrong Court (as is pretended) for what he had unjustly done, for ought ever
appeared, or was ever attempted to be made appear, and he hereby acquitted of
that Act, how unjust soever.

If it might have been granted (which may not be) that the Admiral had no
jurisdiction nor cognizance of this Cause, yet surely that Court which had,
might first have examined whether Burtons act, complained of, was an unjust act
or not, and whether Putt should not there have recovered 900 marks as well as
in the Admiralty Court; and certainly if he should, then cannot I conceive how
Burton can be said to be damnified that 900 marks which might elsewhere have
been recovered, and obtained against him; nor can I judge that he being sued
for 900 marks, which neither were or could there or elsewhere have been
obtained against him, was thereby damnified 900 marks. I shall therefore leave
it here to be considered, whether such a Judgment once given at the Common
Law, is to be held firm and continued for law ever after, or not.

But I must not pass over a main objection, which might have been, or may
hereafter be raised out of this Statute, as the same is by Poulton rendered,
which is this: The Statute (as he rendereth it) says, that whereas in the
Statute made at Westminster, the thirteenth year of King Richard the second*
amongst other things, it is contained that the Admirals and their Deputies
shall not intermeddle from henceforth of any thing done within the Realm, but
only of a thing done upon the sea, etc. so that hereby it may seem, and be very
well urged that this Statute does clearly confirm the Statute of the 13th of
Richard the second, as the same is both by Poulton and Sir Edward Coke rendered
and translated without any relation to the Petition: but if this very Statute
be duly considered, it will plainly appear that Poulton has here thrust in a
repetition of the former Statute, according to his own former rendering
thereof, Sup. hoc cap* (...).
to make the same good, which the original before inserted in this very
chapter, being consulted withal, will not allow him; for there is not one word
of this repetition mentioned either in the Petition or Answer, quod vide; for
the Petition is that the Statutes made in the time of Richard the second
touching the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, comprehending the one as well as
the other, as well the latter which renders the true construction of the
former, according unto the true meaning thereof, taken with relation to the
Petition, as I cannot conceive but that it ought to be, as the former of the
13th of Richard the second may be held and firmly kept, and that the Admirals
and their Lieutenants* may not hold any manner of plea in the Court of the
Admiralty, contrary to the form and ordinance of the sai^ Statutes, which by
the Answer is granted in general, without repeating any part, either of the
one of them, or of the other.

So then these former Statutes, being only considered with relation to the
Petitions, whereunto they are answers, I conceive this Statute affords no
Argument at all against the Admirals Jurisdiction, or cognizance of Contracts
made at Land, concerning Maritime affairs, more then what the other afforded;
and so I hasten to what I promised in the Chapter preceding this.

CHAP. VII.
That the Admiral by these Statutes, was not barred the Cognizance of Maritime
Contracts, though made at Land, made appear by the practice of those times,
proved out of ancient Records remaining in the Tower of London.
THe Judgment given in the Case of Burton and Putt by Sir Edward Coke, said to
be the first that can be found, that was given upon the Statutes, against the
Admiral's having Jurisdiction any where, but upon the high Seas, and by him
said to be within 20 years of the making of the Statutes, and so contemporanea
expositio, the time being duly computed, as I have said before, Sup. lib. cap.
will be found to have been given full 27 years after the last of them; For the
Parliament, wherein the last of them, viz. the Statute 2. H. 4. was made, was
begun and holden at Westminster in the utas of St. Hillarie, Anno Domini 1400;
and in Hillary* Term 1427, being 6. H. 6. was this Judgment given, so that the
largest part of four in this computation, is abated, to bring this Judgment
within the compass of a contemporary exposition* but indeed this Judgment must
be grounded as well upon the two former, as this latter, and principally upon
the first of them; and then is this Judgment 37 years and more after the
making of that Statute, the same being made in Anno 1389. this Statute
therefore having not born this construction or exposition from the time of the
making of it, until 37 years after, and upwards, this being the first Judgment
thereupon (as is confessed) and that given by the Judges, not without a great
deal of doubting for the space of eight Terms, before they could agree, or
would adventure to give that construction, or such exposition thereof, though
tending ad suam jurisdictonem ampliandam, I cannot apprehend that this was
contemporanea, or optima expositio, nor do I find by all the particulars cited
by Sir Edward Coke concerning this matter, that this Judgment was ever pursued
as a president or example, by the same, or other succeeding Judges.

Indeed two Actions he instanceth in brought upon the same ground, one by
Cupper against Rayner, and the other by Wydewell against Rayner, brought both
in the Court of the Common Pleas, Sup. c. 6. li. 2^.
about six years after this Judgment, viz. Paschae 12. H. 6. But he speaks
not of any Judgment given therein, which if there had, he would not willingly
have omitted to have inserted the same, which makes me verily conceive that no
Judgment was given upon either of them, nor indeed can I think that the former
Judgment by him cyted, ever took any effect, or was ever put in execution.

If Sir Edward Coke's rule be true, that contemporanea expositio est optima, a
contemporary exposition is best, then is not this exposition made by this
Judgment the best, though it may be magis contemporanea, more contemporary
then the other Judgments, or expositions given longer after, 28. Eli. Paschae.
viz. Paschae 28 Eliz. which he instanceth in, That Evangelist Constantine
having covenanted with Hugh Gynn, that his Ship should sail with Merchandises
of the said Gynn to Muttrell^in Spain, and should there remain for certain
days, upon breach of which Covenant, Gynn brought an Action of Debt of 500 l.
in regard the Charter party was made at Thetford in the County of Northfolk,
and had Judgment in the Kings Bench; And that Mich. 30. and 31. Eliz. of an
Action of case brought upon a policy of ensurance, so that the former may be
said to be melior expositio, a better exposition then those latter, because it
seems to be the foundation whereon they are grounded, and therefore more
authentic. But if I shall show that within a far shorter compass of time
after the making of the said Statutes then any of those Judgments were given,
which he has instanced in, no such exposition was made of the said Statutes,
but that the Admir^^ty was held to be the proper Court for such causes, and the
Civil Law fittest to Judge them by, then will mine be multo magis contemporanea
expositio, a far more contemporary exposition then his, and by his own rule,
si non optima, multo tamen suis melior, If not the best, yet far better then
his.

I shall therefore instance in an Action brought in the Admiralty within three
years after the making of the first of these Statutes, and in August next after
the making of the second of them, and in the same year that this last Statute
was made, as will appear by the Record it self, which I shall in this chapter
set down at large.

The Action was brought in the Admiralty of the West, before Nicholas Clifton,
then Lieutenant to the Earl of Huntingdon Admiral of the Western parts, by
Peter Draper and Robert Ancleyn of Sherburne, Merchants, against William
Stillard Mariner, in a cause of contract, and letting to freight a ship of the
said William Stillard, called the Lethenard of Haniel, to sail thence to the
Isle of Ree, for Salt, there to be had, and carried or brought back from thence
to Weymouth or Southampton, at the choice of the said Merchants, as by the
Charter-party of contract and affreightment of the said Ship indented, and
between the said parties made, evidently appeared: and this Action there
sometime depended, and was proceeded in unto sentence without any interruption,
or being any ways hindered by any manner of objecting either of the said two
Statutes, against the proceedings in the said Cause, and sentence was given for
the said Stillard, from which the said Draper and Ancleyne appealed unto the
King in Chancery, and a Commission was from thence by the Lord Chancellor
awarded unto five other Civilians, or to any four, three, or two of them,
giving them full power and authority to take the said cause of appeal into
their cognizance, to be proceeded, heard, and discussed in due form of law,
and the same to determine according to law.

All which will appear by the Commission it self, upon record in the Tower,
which I will here set down verbatim.

And in the 17th year of the sam^ Kings Reign, John Coppin Matiner and Owner of
the Ship the Gabriel of Sancta Osicha of Burdugall sued William Snoke and
Thomas Saxtingham, Merchants, for freight of that Ship; first at the Common
Law, where the Action lay not, and so failed; and then in the Admiralty; but
before sentence appealed to the High Constables Court, where his Appeal lay
not; and was therefore from thence dismissed, and condemned in Expenses; who
then appealed to the King in Chancery, and had a Commission from thence
directed unto Richard Stury Knight, Mr. John Bennet Official of the Court of
Canterbury, and Mr. Michael Sergeaux Dean of the Arches London, to hear and
discuss the said cause in due form of law, and to determine the same according
to the rules of the Civil Law, they being all three Civilians: All which

After this, and after the making of the other Statute of the 2d of Henry the
fourth, one Edmund Brooks, Mariner, brought his Action in the Admiralty Court
before John Sturmister, Lieutenant General of Edmund Earl of Kent, Admiral of
England, against John Birkyrne, Richard Honesse, John Walls, and William Burton
of Kingston upon Hull, Merchants, Partners in a Maritime Cause of contracting
and taking to freight of a certain Ship, called the Laurence of Gyppelwich, and
the same was there proceeded in unto sentenc, and sentence was given for the
said Edmund Brooks against the said John Byrkyrne and Company; from which
sentence the said Byrkyrne and Company appealed unto the King in Chancery, and
there obtained a Commission of Appeal from thence directed unto John Kington
and others, who by virtue thereof proceeded in the said Cause unto sentence,
and thereby reversed the former sentence, and condemned the said Brooks in
expenses; from which said sentence the said Brooks again appealed unto the
King in Chancery, and obtained a Commission of Review directed unto the then
Bishop of London, and six Civilians, to review, discuss, and hear the said
Cause in due course of Law, and to determine the same according thereunto.

And this last Commission of Review was granted but eight years after the
making of the said Statute of the 2d of Henry the fourth; and therefore the
Cause must needs be instituted and begun in the first instance some years
before, nearer unto the time of the making of the said Statute, the same having
been proceeded in even unto seentences in two several instances before the
granting of this Commission: all which appears by the Commission of Review it
self, which is upon Record in the Tower in these words following.

Admiralty Court, which Cause was from him appealed unto the King in Chancery,
and a Commission in the eleaventh year of Henry the fourth, being but nine
years after the making the said Statute, and the Cause in the first instance
must needs have been begun some good space of time before that. The Commission

Now for the three Records instanced in by Sir Edward Coke, and brought out of
the Courts of the Common Law, against the Admirals Jurisdiction upon the Ports
and Havens, and in matters of contracts upon businesses to be agitated at sea,
I have showed four out of the Chancery which was then (as by his own setting
forth appears) the only Court enabled to grant Prohibitions in case the
Admiral meddled with causes belonging unto the Common Law: for thus he says.

Sundry Towns of the West part praying remedy against the Officers of the
Admiralty, Coke Instit. part^ 4. cap. 22. page 146.
for holding plea of matters determinable by the Common Law, which they pray
may be revoked, the Kings Answer was.

The Chancellor by the advice of the Justices upon hearing of the matter, shall
remit the matter to the Common Law, and grant a Prohibition.

And as these Records are of far greater antiquity then those by him
instanced in, so are they far more contemporary with the said Statutes; and
therefore, by his own rule, of far greater authority.

Besides, these three Records by him instanced in, do but de facto set forth
what was done, and that but as those three several times in those Courts, sed
quo jure, non arguitur. But it may be very well apprehended, that in 27 years
after the making of the last of those Statutes, and 37 after the making of the
first of them, the Petitions upon which those Statutes were grounded, and from
whence they must receive a right construction, began to be forgotten; but after
the same were revived and brought again into remembrance, and Admiralty Court
had no more such interruptions, but proceeded as before until the times of
those Actions wherein he instanceth which were brought in far later times
then the former, when the said Petitions, whereunto the Answers have, or ought
to have reference, were (as it were) again quite out of remembrance: For if
from the time of the making of those Statutes, until the time of the last of
the Judgments instanced in, all the particular Actions that have been brought,
and ^^^tences that have been given in the Admiralty for things done upon the
Ports and Havens (against the cognizance of which causes one of these
Judgments is brought) and all the Actions brought, and Sentences that have
been there given upon Contracts made at land for businesses to be agitated at
sea, against which the other two Judgments are brought, should be set forth, I
might boldly say there would be many hundreds for one; and I might very well,
and very justly cite diverse of those Records out of the Registry of the
Admiralty for the Jurisdiction of that Court in matters of this nature, which I
doubt not but ought to be as good proof for the Jurisdiction of that Court
whereunto they do belong, as those few Records picked up out of the Registry of
the Common Law Courts ought to make for that Jurisdiction whereunto they
belong; nay by those Records of the Admiralty, and the constant, the continued,
and the general practice and usage of taking cognizance of Causes of this
nature, (...).
it plainly appears that the Jurisdiction thereof anciently did, and still
does belong unto that Court; for in land businesses whose land or soil shall we
judge that to be, but his who has generally, continuedly, and constantly reapt
the Crop, and not his who has at some times come by and taken up a a Shock or
two, and so done as much as he which reapt where he never sowed? which he must
needs do which is neither verst nor skilled in jure scripto, in that Law which
is positively set down for that purpose, but shall judge thereof at randam, and
will so do because others have done so before him; nor under correction can it
be held to be any good rule of Justice to judge by president; for if one man,
or more, have judged unjustly, and not according to law, I would not have it
said, that he which knows the law, is notwithstanding bound to judge as the
other did, because he has a president for it. But I shall pass them presidents
over, and as I have in the second book of this Treatise showed you, that even
by Records out of the Chancery and Common Law, things done upon Ports and
Havens are cognizable in the Admiralty Court, so I shall here show that by
Records of the same Courts the Admiralty has cognizance of Contracts made at
land of and concerning Maritime affairs and businesses agitated, or to be
agitated at sea.

CHAP. VIII.
That by other Records out of the Chancery, Contracts made at Land concerning
Maritime affairs are cognoscible in the Admiralty Court.
ONe Lodowick Sutton sued John Pettite of Abville in Picardy, Merchant, Andrew
Lord, and Daniel Lancel, in the Admiralty Court, upon several Maritime
Contracts made between them in the City of London, the said Pettite, Lord, and
Lancel upon their complaint made in Chancery, that they were sued in the
Admiralty Court upon several Contracts and Agreements made between them upon
ordinary trading and bargaining within the City of London, obtained a
Supersedeas grounded upon the before mentioned Statutes, to stay the
proceedings there; but upon further complaint of Sutton made unto the said
Court, and upon showing that the said Contracts, though there made, were
maritime and within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, a Writ de procedendo was
awarded, commanding that the said Admiralty should proceed in the said Cause
according to law, and the custom of the said Admiralty Court, and to do
justice between the said parties, notwithstanding the said Supersedeas. The
Writ de procedendo runs thus.

In the same year one Lodowick Davy sued John Turner in like manner upon
several Maritime Contracts and Agreements made between them in the City of
London; An. 29. H. 8. in (...) ut in. (...) Adm. m. 34.
likewise, and upon the said Turners like complaint in the Chancery a
Supersedeas was awarded, which in the same manner, and upon the same ground,
was dissolved by a Writ de procedendo; the Writ de procedendo is the same with
the other, saving that they differ in the date and names, etc. I shall
therefore spare the setting of it down.

In the 31 year of Henry the Eighth, Miles Middleton, Ralph Hall, and Henry
Dyconson, Merchants of the City of York, being sued before Robert Bishop of
Landaffe, and others the Kings Commissioners for his Northern parts, upon
Maritime businesses and contracts, the said Middleton, Hall, and Dyconson
complained in Chancery; and a Supersedeas was in the Kings name awarded out of
the Chancery, directed unto the said Bishop, and the rest of the Kings
Commissioners, straightly charging and commanding them altogether, and without
delay, to forbear all examination and cognizance in any Civil Causes, or
Maritime Affairs, of or upon whatsoever Contracts, Pleas, or Complaints between
Merchants, Masters, and Owners of Ships, and others whatsover, with the said
Merchants, Masters, or Proprietors, for any thing by sea or water in any manner
whatsoever to be expedited or contracted, taking their rise or original either
in the parts beyond the Seas, or upon the high Seas, or any where else where
his high Admiral had jurisdiction, whether by passage or voyage at sea, or
whatsoever way appertaining unto, or howsoever touching or concerning Maritime
affairs against the said Miles Middleton, Ralph Hall, and Henry Dyconson, by
whomsoever before them or any of them moved, or howsoever to be moved, or
attempted, remitting the parties (if they would sue) unto his Court of Amiralty
of England for justice to be to there administered according to the Maritime
Laws.

The Supersedeas it self runs in these words.

Afterward in the same year, in the same Kings Reign, the said Bishop, and the
rest of the said Kings Commissioners being thus forbidden to meddle with
matters of this nature, one John Bates a Merchant was sued before the Major and
Sheriffs of the City of York for selling and delivering xlii. Fowder of Lead at
the City of Bourdeanx, in the parts beyond the seas, and complaint being by him
made in the Chancery, a Supersedeas was awarded in the Kings name unto the
Major and Sheriffs of his City of York, charging them likewise that they should
altogether, and without delay forbear all manner of cognizance in Civil and
Maritime causes, contracted in the parts beyond the seas, upon the high Sea, or
in any place where his Admiral of England had jurisdiction, or from thence
proceeding against the said John Bates, by what names soever called, by
whomsoever, or in what manner soever begun, or to begun for the selling and
delivering of the said xlii Fowders of lead as aforesaid, in like manner as
before, remitting the parties (if they would sue) to the Court of the Admiralty
of England for justice to be to them there administered in that behalf.

The words of the Supersedeas are these.

Anno Regni nostri trice simo primo.

Now I shall here by the way observe unto you this thing in particular out of
this last Suprrsedeas, and out of these words, apud Civitatem Burdugaliae,
venditioni expositis, That though by the course of the Common Law, if a man do
deliver certain Goods unto another man, and does entrust him with the keeping
of them, for his the Owners use, or to be by him disposed of in one manner, and
he either sells them, or disposes of them in another (I do conceive) he that
so entrusted the other, may recover of him such damage as he has sustained by
such the others sale, or disposal. Yet if a Merchant does entrust a Master of a
Ship with his Wares or Merchandises to be transported to any Port or place
beyond the Seas, for his own use, or for the use of any other particular man,
to whom the same are by him consigned, or does entrust him to dispose of them
in any particular manner whatsoever; yet he may in many cases upon certain
exigencies happening sometimes sell the same, sometimes he may dispose of them
otherwise then he was appointed by the Merchant or Owner of them, and no damage
shall be by the course of the Civil and Maritime Laws recovered of him; and
herein those Laws have very many nice and curious distinctions: and for this
Cause, when the Merchant very well knows that in such causes he cannot in the
Admiralty Court recover any damages at all, he presently flies to the Common
Law, where he knows he shall recover damage against the Master, who was in no
fault at all; in such manner as mutinous and disobedient Mariners (who have
either through their misdemeanors by the Civil and Maritime Laws, forfeited
their wages, or some part thereof, or having received due correction from the
Master at sea) do fly to the Common Law, either for recovery of their wages
upon their Contract, which they have no ways deserved, or do there bring their
Actions of Battery against the Master, when as he has only given them such due
correction, as the Civil and Maritime Laws do allow, that being a thing done at
sea, where complaint cannot be presently made, or remedy had before a
Magistrate, (as may be at land) and therefore the like at land not to be
allowed, in both which cases they oftentimes recover, and are gone on another
voyage before the Master can make proof of their misdemeanour done either
beyond or upon the seas, which cannot oftentimes be possibly done, but by
Commission out of the Admiralty Court, which turns exceeding much to the
disheartning and discouraging of Masters and Commanders of Ships, which if not
remedied, will be the utter destruction of Navigation.

And another thing I shall observe in general from both the two preceding
Supersedeas's, That all Contracts of and concerning Maritime affairs made
between Merchant and Merchant, Masters and Owners of Ships and Mariners, or
between them or any other person whatsoever, and in what manner soever, to be
agitated or performed by sea, upon the seas, beyond the seas, or elsewhere
within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, or taking their rise or original from
thence, or do in any manner of wise touch, or concern the same, were not
permitted in those times to be examined or adjudged in any Court but the
Admiralty.

And these Supersedeas's in my judgment are a full confirmation of the
Exposition I have before rendered of the two before going Statutes, viz. that
Contracts of this nature, though made at land, which do maris per transitum,
sive viagium, aut negotia maritima quoquo modo respicere vel qualitercunque
tangere and concernere, and so do arise from things done, or to be done at sea,
and not from things done, or to be done within the body of a County, do de jure
belong unto the Cognizance of the Admiralty, and are in no wise by the said two
Statutes taken from the same, and if by them not taken from thence, then does
not the penalty of the other praementioned Statute of Henry the fourth, run
upon those that do sue in the Admiralty Court in causes of this nature, but
only upon such as shall there sue upon Contracts made at land, of or concerning
things done or to be done, or performed at land; and hereof you shall have
further confirmation by Consulations granted at the Common Law upon
Prohibitions from thence upon false suggestions issued.

CHAP. IX.
That by Consultations granted from the Courts of Common Law at Westminster
after Prohibitions formerly from thence obtained, Contracts made at land of and
concerning Maritime businesses to be agitated and transacted at Sea, beyond the
Seas, or upon the Ports and Havens, or of or concerning the same, are
acknowledged to be cognizable in the Admiralty, and have been thereunto by the
same remitted.
I Shall here proceed to show that the Maritime Contracts, whereof I have
hitherto treated in this third Book of this Treatise, and particularly expressed
in the Title of this Chapter, have been by Consultations out of the Courts of
Common Law at Westminster, after Prohibitions from thence obtained, determined
and adjudged to belong unto the Admiralty.

One Robert Baker of the City of London Vintner, sued one John Maynard in the
Admiralty Court, upon a Contract made at land of and concerning a thing done
upon the Sea (as by the Consultation it self does appear.) But one John Gilbert
Esquire being Bail for the said Maynard, endeavoring to decline the cognizance
of that Court, and hinder the just and due proceedings thereof, suggested
before the Kings Justices at Westminster, that he and one William Cowick his
Proctor, were by the Officers of that Court cited to appear in the said Court
in the said cause, pretending the same to be a cause cognoscible before the
said Justices, and not in the Admiralty Court, and obtained a Prohibition;
after which the Libel in the said cause being exhibited before the said
Justices (as likewise appears by the said Consultation) and it being thereby
plain that the same was for a Contract made concerning Sea business, it is said
that the Prohibition issued out unadvisedly, praedictum breve nostrum de
prohibitione a dicta curia nostra coram Justiciariis apud Westminster. improvide
emanavit, and concludes with a nolumus quod per hujusmodi malitiam and
suggest. cognitio in praefata Curia nostra Admirallitatis taliter derogetur.
That the cognizance of that Court shall not be hindered by such malice or
suggestion; and so the cause is thither remitted, by consultation bearing date
the 11th of July in the 24th year of the said Henry the eighth. T. R. Norwich

Sommerset, and Earl of Nottingham, high Admiral of England, Ireland, Gascoine,

Laws, Official Commissary, or Judge of the High Court of the Admiralty, and to

One Richard Bell likewise sued one John Crayne in the Admiralty Court, for
that the said John did at Dartmouth within the Maritime Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty promise and bind himself to exonerate and keep indemnifyed the said
Richard for taking or restoring of a certain Ship called the Mary Fortune, and
the apparel of the same, and the Goods and Merchandises in her at the time of
the taking of her; and that he the said Richard at the time of the taking of
the said Ship, together with John Bell and others was present against one John
Destyron and other Spaniards, affirming themselves to be the Masters and Owners
thereof.

And the said John Crane not setting forth what this Contract made at Dartmouth
was for, but barely suggesting that he was sued upon a Contract made at
Dartmouth within the body of the County of Devon, and not within the
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, obtained a Prohibition.

But upon complaint of the said Bell, setting forth from whence the Contract
arose, and for what the same was, it was held to be within the Maritime
Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and a Consultation was awarded, by which it is
said to be in ipsius Richardi Bell grave damnum, and legis libertatisque
Admiralli laesionem manifestam, to the grievous damage of the said Richard, and
manifest wrong of the law and liberty of the Admiral; and further says, Et
quia cognitionem Jurisdictionemque Admirallitatis in causis maritimis per
hujusmodi callidas assertiones impedire noluimus, vobis jam significamus etc.
And because we will not have the Cognizance and Jurisdiction of the Admiralty
in Maritime caves to be hindered by such crafty assertions; we therefore, etc.

In the time of Queen Elizabeth Christopher Turner sued Thomas Simpson of
Beverly in the County of York before Matthew Bodsworth, Bachelor of Laws, and
Commissary of the Court of the Admiralty in the Northern parts of England, and
Judge of the Vice-Admiralty of York, upon a contract before that time made
between them the said Christopher and Thomas; and thereupon laid and articled
in the said Court, that in the Months of April and May 1586. they the said
Christopher and Thomas had speech or talk between them, concerning certain
quarters of Wheat and Rye, to the number of 69 or thereabouts, namely forty and
one quarters of Wheat, and twenty and eight quarters of Rye, whereof part was
to be taken into a certain Ship called the George of Beverley at a certain
place called Emot-land upon the River of Hull, alias Hull Water, and the other
part thereof to be taken into the said Ship at a certain place called the Good
Alehouse, adjoining to the said River, to be from thence carried and conveyed
in the said Ship by water, unto the City of York, and there to be delivered on
Shipboard at a certain place called the Queens Stathe at the said City, and
further had talk of the freight or price to be paid for the carriage of the
said quarters of Grain, and that they the said Christopher and Thomas bargained
and agreed concerning the said carriage and transportation of the said Grain in
the said Ship the George, in form following, viz. that the said Thomas Sympson
should take and receive into the said Ship the said forty one quarters of
Wheat, and twenty one quarters of Rye at the said place called Emots-lands, and
the said other place called the Good Alehouse, and should from thence transport
and carry the same with all convenient speed to the Queens Stath aforesaid,
being beneath the first Bridge of the River of Owre toward the sea, and there
deliver the same on Shipboard, and that in consideration thereof; the said
Christopher Turner did agree to and with the said Thomas Sympson for the
transportation of every quarter of the said Grain, to pay the sum of ten
pence of lawful money of England; and further, that the said Christopher
Turner in consideration that the said Grain might be more safely and securely
transported and carried, then other his Grain before that time had been, and
that the same might not be heated, wetted, or otherwise impaired, as before
that time, other his the said Christophers Grain had been in other lesser
Vessels of his, the said Thomas Sympson promised and agreed to and with the
said Christopher, that if the said Christopher should not deliver into the said
Ship called the George sixty quarters of Grain, nevertheless in regard that
Ship was of a greater burden then other Ships of the said Thomas Sympsons
were; he the said Christopher would pay to the said Thomas Sympson or his
Assigns the whole freight for sixty quarters of Grain according to the rate of
ten pence for every quarter of the aforesaid Grain; and if there should be more
then sixty quarters of the said Grain, that then the said Christopher Turner
should pay for every quarter above the number of sixty quarters, according to
the said rate of ten pence for every quarter thereof. And that the said Thomas
in consideration thereof promised and convenanted to and with the said
Christopher Turner, that no Grain or Goods of other men should be received into
the said Ship in the said Voyage; and that the said Ship should be sufficiently
manned and victualled, so that by reason thereof the said Christopher Turners
Grain might be safely transported and carried without any heating, wetting, or
other impairing, etc.

Which cause was afterward removed from the said Court of the Admiralty in the
Northern parts, by way of appeal made by the said Thomas Sympson on his part
unto the supreme Court of the Admiralty of England, and there in the end of the
31 year of the said Queens Reign depended undecided.

And the said Thomas Sympson in Hillary Term following suggested in the Kings
Bench that the said Christopher had libelled in the high Court of the
Admiralty, Hill. 32. Eliz.
that the said Contract was made at Beverley, within the Body of the County of
York, and that the said Contract was, that one part of the said Grain was to be
received into the said Ship at a certain place called Emot-land upon the River
of Humber, alias Hull-water, whereas indeed the said Christopher had libelled
in the Court of Admiralty before the said Matthew Dodsworth in the Northern
parts, that that Contract was, that the said Grain should be received into the
said Ship at the said places called Emot-land, and Good Alehouse upon the River
of Hull, alias Hull-Water, and not upon the River of Humber, alias Hull-Water:
And whereas that plea upon the said Libel only depended in the High Court of
the Admiralty, by way of the Appeal aforesaid by him the said Thomas Sympson,
in form aforesaid prosecuted, and otherwise he prayed a Prohibition from the
said Court of King's Bench, and procured the same to be directed unto to the
said High Court of the Admiralty, whereupon the said Court desisted.

But in Trinity Term following, Term. Hill prox.
the said Court of Kings Bench being informed of the whole matter, deduced and
set forth in the original Libel, a Consultation was awarded, which in its own
phrase (and in all things agreeable to what I have here set forth) repeateth
the tenor, effect and substance of the said Libel, with a prout per libellum
ipsius Christopheri before liquet, as by the Libel of the said Christopher in
that behalf does more plainly appear, and concludes, that notwithstanding the
Prohibition for the causes before expressed, and for other the said defects in
the said Thomas Sympsons Suggestion contained, and in the said Court depending,
them moving with an Ac similiter nolentes per hujusmodi falsas and callidas
assertiones placita in Curia Admirallitatis praedicta pendent. diutius
impedire; where nolentes signifies an absolute forbidding or checking rather
then unwilling that the said Pleas in the Court of Admiralty depending should
any longer be hindered by such false and crafty assertions, and therefore
signified that the said Court of the Admiralty might lawfully proceed in the
said Cause between the said parties, and do and perform all other things on
that behalf, which the said Court did know did belong thereunto, etc.

Take here this Consultation more in its own language at large, and I shall set
forth but some few more, and those as briefly as I can. This runs in these
words.

And in the same Queens Reign John Buckhurst infra fluxum and refluxum maris,
within the ebbing and flowing of the Sea upon the River of Thames, arrested the
Ship the Spark, alias the Michael and John of Plymouth, as belonging unto
George Ascoth, and cites him in specie, and all others in genere, and
libelleth, that in the Months of August, September, etc. 1597. the said George
Ascoth was Owner of the said Ship, and had an intent to make a voyage unto the
parts beyond the Seas, and to the effect of expediting the Voyage, bought of
him the said Buckhurst, or his servant, certain necessaries for his Voyage, to
the value of 72 l and received them, and had them into the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, etc.

Zacharias Ashton put in Bayl to answer the Action, and had the Ship released,
and afterward upon suggestion that upon the tenth of March, 39 Eliz. for the
space of two Months before George Ascoth was in the Parish of St. Mary le Bow,
in the Ward le Cheap London, lawfully possessed of this Ship, Tackle, and
Furniture, and that upon the eleventh of March he sold her unto him for 400 l.
and that the Ship belonged unto him: and thereupon obtained a Prohibition.

The Prohibition alleges the Statutes of the 13th of Richard the second, the
15th of Richard the second, and the 1. of Henry the fourth, quodque post
edictionem Statutorum praedictorum, scilicet decimo Martii, anno, etc. apud
London, in parochia beatae Mariae de Arcubus in Warda de Cheap London, ac per
spatium duorum mensium ad tunc praeantea praedictus Georgius Ascogh legitime
possessionatus fuisset de nave praedicta vocat. The Spark, alias The Michael
and John, portus de Plymouth, ac apparat. accession. and ornament. ad eandem
navem tunc spectan. ad valentiam trecentarum librarum monetae Angliae, ut de
bonis and catallis suis propriis, and sic inde possessionatus existen. Idem
Georgius postea, scilicet undecimo die Martii, anno superdicto apud London
praedict. in Parochia and Warda praedictis pro summa quadringent. librarum
legalis monetae Angliae, eidem Georgio per praefatum Zachariam, ad tunc
solveret, etc. contraxisset and vendidisset praefato Zachariae navem praedictam
ac praedict. apparatus, etc. Quodque praedictus Johannes Buckhurst inde non
ignarus machinans cognitionem placitorum quae ad, etc. quandam prohibitionem in
Curia nostra coram nobis, ne etc. prosequit fuerit, etc.

But no proof being made by the said Ashton that he had so bought the said
Ship, or that she was his, and not the said Ascogh's, and the said Court of
King's Bench being informed that the effect and substance of the said Libel was
as is before expressed; and the Cause being held and adjudged cognoscible in
the Admiralty Court, a Consultation was awarded, which says that the
Prohibition was in Johannis Buckhurst, grave damnum and libertatis Curiae
Admirallitatis laesionem manifestam; to the grievous damage of the said
Buckhurst, and manifest wrong of the liberty of the Admiralty Court, and
therefore concluded as the former did, with a Nolentes cognitionem quae ad
Curiam Admirallitatis pertinet in hac part per hujusmodi falsas and callidas
assertiones diutius impediri, etc.

In the Body of which Consultation, the effect and substance of the Libel is
thus expressed.

Inprimis videlicet quod mensibus Augusti, Septembris, etc. Anno Domini
millesimo quingentesimo nonagesimo septimo jam curren. eorumve mensium quolibet
pluribus, uno sive aliquo, praefatus Georgius Ascogh fuit, erat nec non tempore
aresti ab hac Curia interposit. ac in praesenti est Dom. Proprietarius and
legitimus possessor navis vocat. The Spark, alias The Michael and John, portus
Plymothiae ejusque apparatus and ornamentorum, seu saltem mediatatis, seu
alicujus partis dictae navis, proque tali, and ut talis fuit and erat
co^muniter dictus tentus habitus nominatus and reputatus. Item quod annis and
mensibus praedictis eorumve uno sive aliquo, praefatus Georgius Ascogh
intentionem habuit profectionem faciendi in parts ultra marinas, and ad
effectum expediendi viagium sive profectionem praedictam, and paulo ante
decessum ejusdem pro necessariis quibusdam suis, and in itinere sive viaagio
praedicto ab antedicto Johanne Buckhurst, aut ejus famulo ad usum ejusdem
Georgii nonnulla bona ad valentiam septuaginta duarum librarum legalis monetae
Angliae, etc.

In the same manner John Fox arrested the same Ship upon the River of Thames,
as belonging unto the said George Ascogh, and libelled against the said Aschogh
in the same manner, for certain necessaries sold unto him to the value of 50 l.
which he received, and had into his possession within the Jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, and the said Zachary Ashton put in Bayl to the said Action in such
manner as in the other Cause, and afterward upon the like suggestion made unto
the said Court of the King's Bench, as he had there made in the said former
Cause, he likewise obtained a Prohibition in this Cause as in the other; but
the said Court being likewise by the Libel in this Cause informed of the nature
of the Cause, a Consultation was awarded in this Cause as in the other, and
concludes in like manner as the other did, that the said Prohibition was in
grave damnum Johannis Fox, and libertatis Curiae Admirallitatis laesionem
manifestam, and with a Nolentes, etc. as in the former, and both the
suggestion, and substance and effect of the said Libel are inserted in the body
of the Consultation upon the File in the Registry of the Admiralty with the
others, as it and they came directed from the said Court of Kings Bench thither
under seal.

42 Elizab. William Rolfe of Woolwich in the County of Kent did contract and
agree with Thomas Freeman Shipwright, upon a certain rate for day-wages for
himself and his Servants, and for certain other materials or necessaries for
and toward the building of a certain Ship or Pinnace for him the said William
Rolfe, according to which agreement the said Freeman, and one Arthur Argill and
others, as his Servants did afterward in the Month of April in that year at
Woolwich in the County of Kent for diverse days labor in performance of the
said work in their Art, about the structure or building of a small Ship or
Pinnace for the said William, and built a great part of the same; and the said
Ship or Pinnace being built, she was named or called by the said William, The
Anne and Francis, and the said William being in possession of her as his own
proper Vessel, and standing so possessed, he afterward, to wit upon the eighth
day of March in the 43 year of the said Queen, at Woolwich aforesaid in the
County of Kent, for a certain sum of money unto him then and there paid by
one Hugh Lydyard, sold and delivered the said Ship unto him the said Hugh, by
which means the said Hugh upon the said eighth of March in the year aforesaid
became possessed of the said Ship or Vessel, as his proper Ship or Vessel; and
the said Thomas Freeman caused the said Ship or Vessel being upon the River of
Thames, to be arrested, by which means the said Hugh Lydyard was constrained to
appear in the Admiralty Court, and to answer unto the said Tho. Freeman after
upon a Contract of or concerning the retaining or hyring him the said Thomas,
being the Shipwright, to make and build the said Ship, and of and concerning
several promises and undertakings of the said Hugh and William made unto the
said Thomas in the Months of March, April, etc. in the year, etc. concerning
the payment of diverse sums of money to be paid unto the said Thomas for his
Wages and Salary, for his work about the structure and building of the said
Ship or Vessel, and for meat and drink of other Workmen that wrought upon the
said work, and for other necessaries for the fitting of the said Ship, bought
and bestowed thereon by the said Thomas.

The said Hugh Lydyard alleging the Statutes of the 13 and 15 of Richard the
second, and the 2d. of Henry the fourth unto the Court of Common Pleas, and
there suggesting the same fact, and further suggesting the same to be done, and
the said Contracts to be made within the body of the County of Kent, and not
within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty; and that therefore the Action was
brought contrary to the form of the said Statutes, and procured a Prohibition
to the Court of the Admiralty; but upon consideration of the whole matter, the
said Court upon the last day of January in the 45th year of the said Queens
Reign awarded a Consultation, and remitted the said Cause to the Admiralty
Court.

And now in regard that the fact in this case was agreed on both sides, and
therefore no repetition made of the Libel in the Body of the Consultation, the
right of jurisdiction and power of the cognizance of the cause being only in
question, and in regard this Prohibition and Consultation issued out of the
Court of Common Pleas, and the former mentioned out of the Kings's-Bench, take
this Consultation at large as it came to, and remains in the Registry of the
Admiralty.

quadragesimo quinto. Cuick Scot.

Now it hereby appears, that though this Contract was made at land, and the
Ship built at land, yet because both the Contract and work did arise from the
Sea, sailing and transportation of Men, Wares, and Merchandises, being the
principal or only end both of the contract and the work, and the Ship being to
be employed at sea, both the contract and the work were adjudged to be within
the jurisdiction and cognizance of the Admiralty.

Yet must I not let one observation slip, which is here to be observed; and
that is, that this Consultation and all others which repeat those Prohibitions
which have been founded upon the 3. before mentioned Statutes, show that all
those Prohibitions have in their Latin rendered the Statute of the 13th of
Richard the second, to prohibit the Admiral for meddling with any thing but a
thing done super altum mare, upon the high Sea; whereas Poulton's Translation
renders it only upon the Sea; and the original rendereth only sur le mere,
which is upon the sea in general, as well one part as another, as well upon an
arm of it, as upon any part else of the Body; Sup. lib. 3. ^ cap. 2.
besides what follows, viz. Solonc ce que ad estre duement use en temps du
noble Roy Edward ail nostre, as I have already observed, and shall therefore
pass to the next.

Richard Husbands of London, Draper, sold unto Adam Bonner, Master and Owner of
one sixteenth part of the Ship the Advantage of London, certain cloth for the
use of that Ship, to the value of twenty pounds; the money not being paid,
Husbands arresteth this sixteenth part of the said Ship, with Tackle and
Furniture thereunto belonging, and cites Bonner specially, and all others in
general to answer unto him in the Admiralty Court for the said Debt. Bonner
dies, Rachel his Wife takes Administration, and the Suit proceeds against her.

Richard Dove Owner of the other parts or residue of the said Ship became Bayl
for the said Bonners sixteenth part. And afterward upon suggestion in the
Kings Bench, that the Debt was for cloth and other things bought by the said
Bonner of the said Husbands in Cheapside London, and that the said Ship being
freighted and laden in the Parish of St. Mary Bow in the Ward of Cheap London,
with Provision of the Queens to go for Ireland, was there arrested by the said
Husbands, and alleging that the said Action was brought in the Admiralty Court
by the said Husbands against the said Bonner, contrary to the three before
mentioned Statutes, etc. And thereupon obtained a Prohibition. But upon due
information made unto the said Court, setting forth the effect and contents of
the Libel, a Consultation was npon the 25th of April, in the third year of King
James awarded, and the cause returned unto the said Court of the Admiralty,
there to be duly proceeded in* The Consultation plainly expressing that the
matter contained in the Suggestion was no ways sufficient to maintain the
Prohibition. The Consultation runs thus.

T. J. Popham apud Westminster. vicesimo quinto die Aprilis, anno Regni nostri
Angliae, Franciae, and Hiberniae tertio, and Scotiae tricesimo octavo. 1. L.
Rooper.

I shall instance only in one or two more of latter time, and that very briefly.

Claos Cornelius Borss by Charter-party let to freight the Ship the Young Swan
of Horn in Holland, whereof he was Master and part-Owner, unto George Rook and
Robert Grove for a Voyage from London to several Ports and Places beyond the
Seas, and from thence to the Port of London. Borss after the return of the said
Ship, sueth Rooks and Grove in the Admiralty Coutt for his freight due by the
said Charter-party, and likewise for demorage. Rooks and Grove suggest in the
King's Bench, that the Charter-party was made in the Parish of St. Mary le Bow
in the Ward le Cheap, and alleged the three before mentioned Statutes, and
that they had performed the Covenants of the said Charterparty, and that the
Action brought against them in the Admiralty was contrary to the said Statutes,
and obtained a Prohibition.

But the said Court being fully informed Termino Pascae nono Caroli, Pasc. 9
Car.
a Consultation was awarded with a Nolentes, etc. as in the former. And
further, quod in causa praedicta quatenus de non performatione conventionum
praedictarum quoad naulum and morationem coram vobis duntaxat agatur, licite
procedere poteritis, and ulterius facere quod ad Curiam Admirallitatis
praedictae noveritis pertinere, dicta prohibitione nostra non obstante. T. T.
Richardson apud Westminster. tertio die Junii, Anno regni nostri nono, Henley and
Whigswick.

In like manner David Guy of Disart in Scotland let to freight by Charter-party
the Ship the Grace of God of Disart, then lying at Anchor in the River of
Thames, to John Delabar and James Hope, upon a Voyage; upon which Guy sued the
said Del^bar and Hope in the Admiralty Court for his freight thereby contracted
for, and unpaid. Hope and Delabar setting forth in the Kings Bench, that the
Charter-party was made in St. Michael Cornhill, and alleging the three before
mentioned Statutes, and that the said Action was brought in the said Admiralty
Court contrary to the said Statutes, Pasch. 9 ca^.
obtained a Prohibition. But in Easter Term in the 9th year of King Charles, a
Consultation was awarded as in the other.

Hence I do observe that all these Judges which granted these before mentioned
Consultations, have heretofote afforded the before mentioned Statutes the same
interpretation that I have since gathered, and in this Treatise set down, viz.
That a Contract, whether made at land or at sea, if the same does arise from a
business to be done or performed at land, the same is to be tried by the Law of
the land: But a contract, whether made at sea or at land, if the same does
arise from a business to be done or performed by or at sea, or beyond the sea,
the same is cognoscible in the Admiralty Court. Sup. li. 3. ca. 2, 3, 4, etc.
For upon the granting these Consultations, the question was not whether either
the Contracts or the Charter-parties were made at sea, or at land, or whether
they were made in the Parish of St. Mary le Bow, or St. Michael Cornhill, or
not; but whether the same were Maritime contracts, or concerned Marrtime
business or not, and so within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, or not; as in
the first of these five last cited Consultations concerning the building of a
Ship, the question was not, whether the contracts for the wages in building of
her, or the materials bought and employed upon her, the meat and drink bought
and spent in the time of the building of her were made at land or not, or
whether the Ship her self was built at land or at sea; for the case was plain
in the one as well as in the other, that the Ship was built at land as all
Ships are upon the Stocks, is no doubt at all: and the Ship being there built,
it is as little doubt that the contracts were there made, nnless we will
suppose that which is not to be supposed, viz. that the parties went to sea to
bargain for the building of her at land, and to bargain for materials to build
her with, and for meat and drink to be spent in the time of the works being in
hand; but the question was, whether these contracts concerned a business that
was maritime or not, which did arise from somewhat to be done at or by sea, or
not; and it being plain, that had it not been for sea employment, none of these
contracts had been made. And therefore was it adjudged that these contracts did
arise from businesses to be done at sea, and were therefore maritime, and
belonged unto the maritime Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, as all other
contracts for victualling, tackling and furnishing of Ships, with either
Anchors, Cables, or other Ropes, or whatsoever other necessaries, (although the
same were contracted for and bought at land) anciently were and did belong, and
of right still are, and do belong.

And as for the Contracts and Charter-parties made of letting Ships to freight,
it is sure enough that they are seldom or never made but at land; yet are
these contracts made of and concerning a Ship which at the very time of the
making thereof is, Aut super mare fluctuans, aut ad Anchoras in quovis portu
natans infra fluxum and refluxm maris infra Jurisdictionem Admirallitatis,
either sailing upon the Seas, or lying at Anchor in some Port or Haven, where
the Sea ebbeth and flows within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty. And these
contracts do arise from businesses to be done at sea, and were therefore
adjudged to belong unto the Sea Jurisdiction.

But perhaps it may be still objected that the Law does allow a fiction of
place for the doing of any thing, and it mattereth not whether the thing was
there done or not; and I do agree that the Law does allow such a fiction, so
that the same be within the compass of a possibility. But to feign a thing
impossible, as to fain that Ships sail in Cheapside, Sup. li. 3. cap.
or elsewhere upon the dry land, the Law abhors, as I have said before.

And then is it more proper and more agreeable to law to feign the
Charter-party that was made at land to have been made at sea, which is
possible, then it is to feign a Ship to be at land, where the Contract was
made, or when she was laden or furnished with either victual, tackle, or any
other manner of provision or furniture, which is impossible?

I shall instance only in one Contract made beyond the seas concerning sea
affairs, upon which a Bill obligatory was taken for the payment of a certain
sum of money, and the said Bill obligatory was adjudged cognoscible in the
Admiralty Court, and then proceed upon another argument; and this appears by
a Consultation granted out of the Court of Common Pleas in the 10th year of
King James (Sir Edward Coke himself being then Lord Chief Justice of the Court)
directed unto Sir Daniel Dunn Knight and Doctor of Laws.

Thomas Alport libelled in the Admiralty Court against Philip Cooper, that in
the Months of January, etc. Anno 1609. and in the Months of March, April, etc.
the said Philip Cooper remaining in the parts beyond the seas, etc. did by his
Bill obligatory in the said parts beyond the seas, etc. lawfully make, and with
his own proper hand subscribed, and sealed with his Seal, tie and bind himself
to the said Thomas Alport for the due payment of the sum of 275 l. and six
shillings of lawful money of England, as in the said Libel in the said
Consultation is summed up, viz.

Quod men's. Jan. etc. Anno Dom. 1609. nec non mensibus Martii, Aprilis, etc.
1610. seu eorum aliquo, praedictus Philippus Cooper, dum partibus ultramarinis,
etc. remanebat, se pro debita solutione summae ducentarum septuaginta quinque
librarum and sex solidorum legalis monetae Angliae praefato Thomae Alport per
scriptum suum obligat. in partibus ultramarinis, etc. legitime factum, manuque
sua propria subscript. ejusque sigillo, etc.

But the said Philip Cooper suggested in the Court of Common Pleas, as in the
said Consultation is set forth; Quod tertio die Aprilis anno Regni Jacobi Dei
gratia Angliae, etc. septimo infra corpus Comitatus Civitatis London, viz. in
Parochia Beatae Mariae de Arcubus in Warda de Cheap, et non super altum mare,
nec infra Jurisdictionem Curiae Admirallitatis Angliae per quandam billam suam
obligatoriam sigillo suo sigillat. et ut factum suum cuidam Thomae Alport tunc
et ibidem deliberat. gerens datum eodem die et anno obligasset se et Haeredes,
Executores et Administratores suos, ad solvendum praefato Thomae, Haeredibus,
Executoribus et Administratoribus suis ad omnia tempora super demand. summam
ducentarum septuagint'. et quinque librarum et sex solidorum legalis monetae
Angliae; cumque idem Philippus liber homo, etc. And recites the said three
before mentioned Statutes. Praedictus tamen Thomas praemissorum non ignarus,
sed machinans non solum ipsum Philippum contra debitam legis hujus regni
Angliae formam, et contra formam et effectum statutorum, etc. traxit in
placitum false, caute et subdole libellando in Curia Admirallitatis, etc. cujus
quidem suggestionis praetextu, etc.

That upon the 3. of April 7 Jacobi within the body of the County of London,
viz. in the Parish of St. Mary de Bow, in the Ward le Cheap, and not upon the
high Sea, nor within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court of England, he by
his certain Bill obligatory, sealed with his seal as his deed, then and there
delivered unto one Thomas Alport, bearing date the same day and year, did bind
himself, his Heirs, etc. to pay unto the said Thomas, his Heirs, etc. at any
time upon demand, the sum of 275 l. and 6 s. of lawful money of England, and
alleges the three before mentioned Statutes, and that notwithstanding the
said Thomas not being ignorant thereof, etc. had brought his Suit in the
Admiralty Court for the recovery of the said debt upon the said Bill obligatory
contrary, to the form of the Law of England, and contrary to the form of the
said Statutes, and thereupon obtained a Prohibition.

But upon the 20th day of June, in the tenth year of King James, it being made
appear by the Libell and Bill obligatory, that the same was made beyond the
seas in respect of a Maritime business had and done at sea, the said
Prohibition was released by consultation, which concludes that the Prohibition
was to the grievous damage of the said Thomas Alport, and manifest wrong of the
Court of the Admiralty, and says the proceedings in that cause in the said
Admiralty Court ought not to be delayed.

Et quia videtur praefatis Judiciariis, and pro certis caeusis ipsos
specialiter moventibus, quod processus in praedicta Curia Admirallitatis in
praedicta causa ad prosecutionem praedicti Thomae ulterius retardari non debet;
Ideo vobis, etc.

T. E. Coke apud Westminster. xx. die Junii, Anno Domini nostri Angliae, Franciae and
Hiberniae decimo, and Scotiae quadragesimo quinto. Crompton.

But it may be said that many more Prohibitions have been granted out of both
the said Courts at Westminster, as well in causes of this nature, as in causes
for things done upon Ports and Havens, upon which Consultations have not been
had, and I doubt not but in latter times there have; but it has for the most
part been when the parties have agreed, and the cause compounded, and so no
Consultation prayed or sought for, if otherwise, let no man brag of that which
has been done, which ought not to be done. But another cause may be given, and
that is this, that the Civilian not being suffered there to plead the right of
Jurisdiction belonging to the Admiralty, the same has not been undertaken by
any practicers in those Courts, and if undertaken, yet pleaded but coldly
against the Jurisdiction of their own Courts: Howsoever I do conceive that the
Procedendoes out of the Chancery, and the Consultations out of the Kings Bench
and Common Pleas, which I have in this and the second Book of this Treatise set
forth (though I might have instanced in very many more) will be sufficient to
determine the right of Jurisdiction as well in causes of the one nature, as of
the other against the said several Courts from whence such Supersedeases and
Prohibitions were granted.

I will not say but that the Admiralty Court may sometime have intermedled with
Contracts made at land, arising from businesses done or to be done or performed
at land, which is here in England, as it were to take Cattle from a Pasture and
put into the sea to feed. And in such cases I doubt not but a Prohibition may
lie, which shall not be dissolved by Consultation.

But by Prohibitions to take businesses of the Ports and Havens, or Contracts
made at land concerning Maritime affairs from the Admiralty, to be determined
by the Common Law of the land, is to take fish out of the sea to be kept alive
and fed upon pasture, or in some Forest or Park at land.

For I shall in the next Chapter out of many show you some few of those exact
rules the Civil Law has to proceed by in causes of this nature, besides the
Laws I have before mentioned, which the Common Law has not.

CHAP. X.
That diverse and several of the Laws under the titles selected out of the body
of the Civil Law by Peckius for determination of Maritime Causes; and other
Laws selected out of several other titles, as subsidiary unto them, do set
forth most exactly the determination of Controversies, which may and do daily
arise from Contracts made at land concerning matters to be done at sea.
NOw concerning this matter I may rather refer the Reader unto Peckius
himself, Vinius, and other Authors writing thereon, then to spend any great
labor about it: but whilst he has this book in his hand, let him cast his
eye upon some few of a great number of such Contracts made at land, concerning
businesses to be done at sea, which are exactly determined by these Laws, and
are used and held absolutely necessary in all foreign Maritime Judicatories,
(and not by any the rules of their Municipal Laws) which as they are little or
nothing different in their proceedings from the proceedings of the Civil Law,
so are they far less different in their determinations from the
determinations of that Law, then our Municipal Laws be.

As in the first of these Titles.

If Mariners before they receive goods on board, do contract with the Loader,
ut recepta restituant.

Quaeritur utrum Nauta an Exercitor navis pro restitutione conveniatur?

Quaeritur etiam an Exercitor, Magister, aut Nauta ex contractu teneatur de
rebus non ostensis; Ac utrum amicus ex contractu amicum in navem recipiens
teneatur de perditione?

Quaeritur etiam utrum nautae ex sola emissione teneantur? Ac etiam an nautae
de facto vectorum teneantur?

Quaeritur etiam quae and quando actio detur, subsidiaria, protestatio an

vis protestationis? Cum quolibet nautarum sit contractum, an detur actio in
exercitorem? Ac quid si nauta per Magistrum navis conductus in nave deliquerit
an in exercitorem detur actio? Magister navis per exercitorem conductus, an
alium substituere potest? Mutuum dans in navis usum, an caeteris creditoribus
praefertur? and quando? and quare? an? and quando navis per aversionem
conducitur?

Dominus an? and quando? and quare? invitus and ignorans de peculio teneatur?
Merces an pro naulo contracto cum magistro sint obligatae?

Quaeritur etiam quando argumentum a contractibus ad delicta procedat? quando
non? quae autem diversitatis sit ratio, quam optime declarat Ulpianus.

Variae etiam quaestiones assurgunt ex variis navium conducendarum modis
contractis; ut de navibus locandis, varia sunt diversorum hominum studia, alius
conducendis tantum vectoribus, alius ob naulum mercibus transferendis, alius ex
longinquis Regionibus aromatibus abducendis intentus est. Ex quibus quidem
variis locationum modis contractis variae sunt quaestiones.

Quidam iterum cum navibus suis navigare velint, quidam tamen cum rebus suis
ipsi superesse non possint, magistrum navi praeficiunt; and ex ea ratione
iterum aliae omnes duplicantur and quaestiones and determinationes earund.

Vtrum conducta nave per aversionem, avertitur a conductore periculum, and
quando in locatorem rejicitur cum aliis quaestionibus de conductione per
aversionem.

Si plures per contractum suum navem exerceant, an cum quolibet eorum in
solidum agi potest.

Si navis lacera sit and inde res deterioratae; an, and quando, vector ex
locato contra magistrum agit?

Quaeritur etiam an, and quando, pro pecuniis mutuo pro reparatione navis
sumendis aut aliter in ejus usum disponendis, in exercitorem detur actio and
quaenam detur actio?

Quamplurimae etiam sunt leges diversis in titulis per totum Juris Civilis
corpus distentae and diffusae, quae (ut flores ex horto amoeni and salutiferi)
hisce selectis ut eisdem subsidiariae per authors super ipsis conscribentes,

Now have I not here rendered or set forth the determinations of these few
questions which I have here nominated, they being not considerable without the
rest, which taken altogether with their divisions, distinctions, decisions and
determinations, would make by themselves a whole Tract de jure Admirallitatis,
which would be a Book to little or no purpose, nor receive any welcome, unless
this which is de ejus Jurisdictione, may first receive some entertainment,
which how necessary and advantageous the same may redound unto this Kingdom, I
shall leave to the consideration of him that has or shall thoroughly read this
Maritime Dicaeologie.

THis small Treatise which I have written in Vindication of the Jurisdiction of
the Lord High Admiral of England, etc. I doubt not but will receive this
Addition of Advantage, as to tend likewise to the vindication and clearing of
the honor and reputation of those Reverend and Learned Judges of the Land (the
two Lords Chief Justices, the Lord Chief Baron, and the rest of the then Judges
their Associates, together with the Attorney General) whose Judgments and
Justice have been blemished, and unworthily aspersed by some of their own
Profession, in saying those Reverend Judges were questioned in Parliament for
setting their hands unto an Agreement made (before his Majesty of Blessed
Memory Charles the First) between them his Judges of the Land, and Sir Henry
Martin Judge then of his High Court of Admiralty, purporting in substance the
matter of this Treatise.

It Is true, I have heard that some of the Puisne Lawyers, and young men of that
Profession (sitting in the Long Parliament) would have attempted such an
undiscreet, and unparelleld act; but by the gravity and wisdom of others more
learned in that Profession then themselves, were dissuaded from it. Yet if they
had, I doubt not but he that reads this Treatise, will find sufficient reasons
to justify their assent to that agreement, and that it contained nothing but
what they might and ought to do, notwithstanding the Judgments of their
Predecessors or Successors.

Others do not forbear or stick to say this Subscription to this Agreement was
an extrajudiciall act, and so takes not the effect of a Law either to bind them
or their Successors, as though the place and formality of sitting upon the
Bench were of the essence of a true and just opinion; and the Judges being
called and convened by special summons before his Majesty, that their
Judgments and Opinions there delivered in matters propounded, debated, and
argued, were of less force and validity, and more extraneous to reason, then if
they were judicially sitting.

Which is an opinion that I cannot conceive any man of sound judgment can
adhere unto; and therefore I shall conclude this Treatise with that judgment
given by those twelve Learned and Reverend Judges of the Land, with the consent
of that famous Man Mr. Noy, his Majesty's Attorney General.
