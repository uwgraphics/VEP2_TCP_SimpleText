LONDON, Printed for R. Austin. 1645.

CHARLES by the grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting.
WHereas in the time of this unnatural Rebellion, our own Ships and Vessels
belonging to our Royal Navy have bin traitorously seized upon, and those and
diverse Ships and Vessels belonging to others, as well Strangers as our own
Subjects, have bin and still are employed against us, or in the service of the
Rebels in Arms against us, by carrying or conveying of Arms, Ammunition,
Money, Victuals, and other Provisions for their aid and assistance, or by
exporting from them Money, Bullion, Plate, or prohibited Goods, without
license, contrary to the Laws; or by trading and carrying of Goods and
Merchandise for trade and commerce, to and from those parts, Cities, Towns,
and Places which are under the usurped Powers the Rebels in Arms against us:
And likewise by paying Customs, Subsidies, and Imposts, to the said Rebels,
contrary to the Laws, and our Proclamation in that behalf, which affoords them
means and ability toward the maintenance and upholding of the said unnatural
Rebellion.

And whereas diverse of our good Subjects adhering to us, have suffered great
loss and damage by the said Rebels, and their Abbetors as well upon the Land
as upon the Sea, for which they can have no remedy in ordinary course of
justice, in regard those that have done the same, are kept out of the reach or
hand of justice, by the Powers and Forces so traitorously raised against us.

And whereas in these times or distractions diverse Pirates, and Sea-Rovers
commit great spoils and outrages upon our own Subjects, and the Subjects of
our friends and allies, and diverse of our Subjects of our Kingdom of Scotland,
have most perfidiously and traitorously risen up in Rebellion, and taken up
Arms, against us their natural Liege Lord and Sovereign, and have in a
hostile manner invaded this our Kingdom of England.

And whereas diverse Ships and Vessels as well Scottish, as others, are employed
at Sea in their aid and assistance, in manner as aforesaid. And whereas upon
those occasions we have been forced to set out Ships at our own great charge,
for our own defense, and the defense of our loyal Subjects, and preventing
the mischiefs before mentioned, and have likewise thought fit to give all
encouragement to any of our good Subjects which are willing and desirous to set
out Ships at their own charges for and toward the weakening and suppressing of
the said Rebels, and more particularly to those our good Subjects who have
sustained damages by the said Rebels, either at Land or Sea, to the end they
may obtain some recompense or satisfaction for their said losses.

And whereas we are informed that Sir Nicholas Crisp Knight, has suffered
great loss and damage in the time of this unnatural Rebellion, by the said
Rebels, their Adherents, or Abettors, as well at Sea as upon the Land.

Know ye therefore, that we reposing special trust in his, the said Sir
Nicholas Crisps fidelity and circumspection, whereof we have had very good
experience, have given and granted, and by these Presents do give and grant
unto him, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and to such as he shall take into
Partner-ship and Consort-ship with him therein, full power and authority, at
his and their own charges to set to Sea, out of any of our Ports of our
country of Cornwall, or out of any other our Ports or Havens whatsoever,
fifteen or twenty ships, or vessels or war, or any other number of ships and
vessels, not being less than fifteen, equipped, victualled, fitted,
furnished, and marined for war.

And, we do hereby give unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp full power and
authority to command in Chief, as Admiral of the said ships, and other
vessels, and men in them, either in his own person, or by his Substitute, and
to nominate and appoint Vice-Admiralls, Reare-Admiralls, Captains, Commanders,
and Officers, in the said ships, as shall be necessary for each ship.

And, we do hereby give unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and to such as
shall be employed by, or under him, in this service, full power and authority
with the said ships so to be set out by him and his partners, as aforesaid, or
any of them, to take, seize, or surprise, or in case of resistance, or where
necessity requires, by fight to compel, and take into his or their
possessions, or destroy any of our own ships or vessels, set forth without our
Commission, Warrant, or Leave. And also, any other ships or vessels belonging
to what person, or of what place soever, which are or shall be employed in any
service for any of the said Rebels, of either our said Kingdoms of England or
Scotland, or of any their Aiders, Abettors, or Adherents; and all goods and
merchandice in them contained; and all ships and vessels which shall be
employed in importing, carrying, or conveying any Arms, Ammunition, materials,
or provision for their, or any of their aid or assistance, or in exporting, or
transporting for them, or any of them, or for their, or for any their use, any
money, Bullion, or prohibited goods whatsoever, without our License, or
contrary to the Law, or in trading, or carrying merchandice for trade or
commerce to or from any Port, City, Town, or Place; now, or which at any time
hereafter shall be under the usurped Power, or holding of the said Rebels, or
of any of them, or which have paid, or shall pay them the said Rebels, or any
of them, or any other by their direction or appointment, any Customs,
Subsidies, Imposts, or other duties whatsoever, unless it be by, and with our
special License or allowance: And likewise the ships and vessels of all Pirates
and Sea-Rovers, together with all furniture, Ammunition, provisions, goods,
lading and merchandice in any of the aforesaid ships or vessels; and the said
ships, vessels, furniture, ammunition, provisions, goods, merchandice and
lading, to cause to be proceeded against, adjudged and condemned, according to
the Law and Course of the Admiraltie, as the case shall require before the
Judge of our Court of Admiraltie for the time being, or other Judge or Judges
of any Vice-Admiraltie, as good and lawful Prize. And after such adjudication
and condemnation, to have, keep, possess, and enjoy all the said ships,
vessels, furniture, ammunition, provision, goods, lading, and merchandice, so
by them, or any of them taken as aforesaid, as good and lawful prize and
purchase to their own use and uses of the Adventurers and Company joining, as
aforesaid, to be shared and divided amongst them, as they shall contract and
agree together, without any account to be made to Us, our Heirs or
Successors, except such of our own ships and vessels, with their Ordnance,
tackle, and furniture, as shall be so by them taken, which we will and require
shall be restored to Us and to our use, we paying and allowing the sum of five
pounds of lawful money of England, upon every Tun of our said own ships and
vessels, as shall with the Ordnance, tackle, and furniture of the same, or
belonging thereunto, be taken and restored to Us as aforesaid: And allowing
also to the said Sir Nicholas Crisp his Partners, Associates, the goods and
merchandices in any such of our own ships or vessels, to be made prize and
divided amongst them, in such manner, and under such reservation to Us, as
other goods and merchandices taken in any other ships or vessels ought to be,
according to the tenor of this our Commission.

And we do also hereby give and grant to him, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his
Partners and Associates, that it shall and may be lawful for him and them, to
retain, use, and employ such of our said own ships so to be taken and
surprised, till we have made payment of the said five pounds per Tun to him or
them for the same, without any account or satisfaction to be made to Us for the
same whatsoever. Excepting also further, and reserving to Us all tenths
heretofore used to be paid in cases of like nature to the Admiral of England,
and all Customs and duties due, or accustomably paid for and upon any the said
prizes which we will shall be paid and accounted for to us, and to our use:
Provided always, that before any of the said ships or vessels of war so to be
set out by him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners or Associates, shall
go out of the said Ports, Havens, or Harbors aforesaid, upon the said
employment, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp shall cause the Captain, Master and
chief Mate of every of the said ships, to enter into a bond or obligation of
the penal sum of one thousand pounds to Us, with condition thereupon, that
they, nor either of them, nor any their company employed in the said ship,
shall wittingly, or knowingly, rob, spoil, hurt, or endammage any of our
Subjects, or the Subjects of any of our friends, or allies, other than such of
either of our said Kingdoms of England and Scotland, as shall be in Rebellion
against us, or shall be Abettors to the said Rebellion, or have, or shall pay
Customs, Subsidies, or Impost to the said Rebels, contrary to the Law,
without our special license or allowance; or shall be employed in aid or service
of the said Rebels, or any of them, or which are or shall be employed in
exporting for them, or for their use, any Bullion, Plate or other prohibited
Goods, without our license, or shall convey any provisions to or for the said
Rebels, or shall trade to or from any of those Cities, Towns, Ports, or
places, which are or shall be under the usurped power or holding of the Rebels,
of either of our said Kingdoms, of England, or Scotland, or have or shall take
the late traitorous Covenant, or League, against us. And likewise, that all
Ships by them taken, and surprised, with their furniture, goods, and lading,
shall be brought entire, without breaking bulk, into some Port of our Kingdom
of England; now or then in our possession and obedience, except in case of
apparent danger of the Rebels Ships: In which case it shall and may be lawful
to carry the said Ships, or Vessels, or any of them, into any Port of our
Kingdom of Ireland, or into any other Port of any Forragine Prince, or State
in league or amity with us; and there to be and remain till the same shall
receive sentence, and adjudication of any of our Courts of Admiralty, or
Vice-Admiralty, in such manner and upon such testimony, as if the said Ships
and Goods were in any of our own Ports and Harbors, so as a true inventory
valuation and apprizement of the said Ships, and Vessels, and of their goods
and ladings, be first made and delivered into the Court of Admiralty, or
Vice-Admiralty, where the proceeding, sentence or adjudication touching the
same shall be.

And forasmuch theas setting out and finishing of the said Ships of War
cannot be done without the great charge and expense of the said Nicholas Crisp,
his Partners, and Associates, and may probably conduce, not only to and for
the reparation of the losses and damages by them sustained, by the said
Rebels, but may also much tend to our Service, by weakening the trength of the
said Rebels, destroying their trade, and suppressing this present Rebellion.

We do therefore hereby further grant unto him, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp,
and such others as he shall receive into his association and partnership a
aforesaid, that none of the said ships, or vessels of war, so by him or them to
be set forth, shall be imprested, commanded, or employed upon any other service
for Us whatsoever, save only to fetch or convey Arms, or Ammunition from
foreign parts into this Kingdom, for our special service. And that only by
warrant from Our Self, under our Sign Manual, and then not to stay in any
Harbor above twenty days, and to be paid for every such voyage according to
the rate of four pounds per month for every man to be employed in every such
voyage. And that none of the said ships, vessels, or men be commanded, or
employed in any second, or other voyage, upon the said service, until they
shall be paid and satisfied what shall be so due unto them upon the first
voyage, as aforesaid.

And further, That no Masters, Masters-Mate, Gunner, Sailer, Mariner, or other
Officer or Servant employed by, or under the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, in any of
the said ships and vessels shall be imprested, or taken out of the same upon
any occasion whatsoever, without the consent of him the said Sir Nichelas
Crisp. Nor that any Ammunition, victual, or provision taken up, or provided
for the said ships or vessels, or which shall be in, or belonging to any prize
taken by any of the said ships or vessels, shall be taken away, or seized upon
for our service, or other occasion whatsoever, without the consent or agreement
of him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners or Associates.

And that the said service and employment may be the better effected and
performed, and the said Sir Nicholas Crisp the more enabled to provide,
furnish, and set out the said number of ships and vessels, by him propounded as
aforesaid, We do hereby given and grant to him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp,
his Partners and Associates, full power and authority to provide or take into
his or their consortship, any other ships or vessels, as well of Forrainers in
amity with Us, as of our own Subjects, upon the best conditions he or they
can contract or agree for the same with the Owners thereof; and to employ and
use them in the said service.

And We do like wise give unto the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners and
Associates, full power and authority from time to time, and as often as he or
they shall think fit and requisite, or conducing to the service, to land Forces
as he or they shall think fit, in or near unto any place or places within any
our Dominions, where any Insurrection or Rebellion is, or shall happen to be,
and to suppress such Rebellion; and in case of opposition or resistance, by
fight to subdue, or destroy all such Rebels and Traitors; and to appoint such
Commanders over such part of the Forces as shall there be landed, as aforesaid,

of them as shall submit unto Us, and desire to receive our mercy: and shall be
thought meet persons to be received into our favor and grace, other than, and
except such as are already excepted by Us in any of our Proclamations, or
Declarations.

And, We do likewise give unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, power and
authority, to make, ordain, proclaim, and put in execution Laws,
Ordinances, and Constitutions, for the better order and government of the ships
and men, which by virtue of this our Commission, shall be under his charge and
command. And to punish mutinies, tumults, rapines, murders, and other crimes
which shall be committed and done by any person or persons, under his charge or
command, either upon the Sea or Land, according to the course and usage of the
Sea, or of War, as the case shall happen to be.

And we do hereby require and command the Judge of our Court of Admiralty, and
the other Judges of their several Vice-Admiralties within our Kingdom of
England and Dominion of Wales, or elsewhere, according to this our Commission,
they forthwith proceed to sentence, or adjudication of the same with speed and
effect, as good and lawful prize, without any unnecessary delay, which may
turn to his or their prejudice.

And we do hereby command and require all Governors, Captains, and Commanders
of all our Cities, Castles, Towns, and Garrisons, and all Sheriffs, Majors,
Bailiffes, Justices of the Peace, Vice-Admiralls, Constables, and all other our
Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever, within any of our Dominions, to
be aiding and assisting to him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners, and
Associates, and such as shall be employed by, or under him, or them, in the

perils.

And we do also hereby desire all others, as well Admiralls, Vice-Admiralls,
Captains, and Officers, and other the Subjects belonging unto any Prince or
State now in amity with us, to be aiding and assisting to us as occasion shall
require, to him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners, and Associates, and
those under his or their command, in the execution of this our Commission.

And we do hereby also require and command the Judge of our Court of Admiralty,
for the time being, upon Request made by him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, for
that purpose, to grant unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and to the
Captains or Commanders of every the Ships to be set out, or employed as
aforesaid, several Letters of Mark, or Reprisall, or Commissions of that

esteem in Foreign parts beyond the Seas.

And further know ye, that we putting special trust and confidence in the

Port or Haven of this our Kingdom in actual obedience to us, upon such terms
or articles as he and they shall agree; which we hereby, for us, our heirs and

they shall proceed to sentence or adjudication of, and upon the said ships, and
goods, as if the same had been taken and seized upon by force and strength at
sea.

Nicolas Crisp for: And that the said Sir Nicholas Crisp and his Partners, and
Associates, shall have and enjoy, to their own uses, the residue of the said

Foreign Ships, we of our further grace do grant unto the said Sir Nicholas
Crisp, full and free power and liberty by himself, or his agents, to barter,
exchange and sell away any of his said ships, or any which shall be taken as
prize in this service, other than our own shpis and vessels which are to be

of every such ship so bartered away, exchanged, or sold, there be one other
ship provided from Foreign parts, at least equally useful, if not better for
the present service and employment.

And our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby declare, that this our
Commission, and the Powers, Liberties, License, Authority hereby respectively
given and granted, shall be and continue in force for and during the space of two
whole years next ensuing the dare hereof (if this Rebellion should so long
continue) and no longer.

In witness whereof We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents;
Witness Our Self at Oxford, the sixth day of May, in the twentieth year of
Our Reign.

To the Committee for the Navy.
Noble Sirs:
WE present you here one piece of the Enemies care by sea, the readiness of
their undertakings, the willing acceptance of such tenders, the counsel they
have, their present executions, their engaging of their whole party, even as
far as Popery reaches, and as low as Hell; for from this Commission, the
Dunkirk and Ostend Frigots get theirs, and act vigorously: some have formerly
said of England, That the sea could give laws to their foreign and domestic
broils. We therefore desire that you would look upon this Critical year,
and upon such means as God has betrusted you withal. Remember the sea (in
former times) has ever danced under our vessels laden with victorious trophies
from abroad; let us not be baffled at our doors, the ships and seamen are yet
yours, it is a great prize: God keeps all the world upon the hinges by his
counsel; States and Kingdoms must keep their work on the wheels by the same
way; this Kingdom will never be delivered by Law, but Men, who being good,
carry Law in their bosoms. Show your selves now, if ever, to save a gasping
Nation, that after-ages may say, There was a blessed, faithful, State-saving
Committee of the Navy: The Lord help you and us. AMEN.
