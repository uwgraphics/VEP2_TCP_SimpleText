A SONG for St. CAECILIA's Day, Nov.22. 1686.
Written by Mr. Tho. Flatman: And Composed by Mr. Isaac Blackwell.
I.
FRom those pure, those blessed Abodes,
Where none but Tuneful Spirits dwell,
Or Gods, or like to Gods,
That did on Earth in Harmony Excel,
Descend ye Powers on this illustrious Day,
Devoted to the bright Caecilia;
Inspire us how to Sing, and how to Play;
Transport us with Seraphick Fire,
While our Ambicious Voice we raise,
Full of Wonder, full of Praise,
And boldly touch the trembling Lyre.
II.
Humble Song Advance! Arise!
Of Laurels, Palms, and Triumphs Sing,
Of Crowns that dazzle mortal Eyes,
Crowns obtained by suffering,
Divine Caecilia be thy lofty Theme;
Sing Her Immortal Diadem;
Sing aloud Her Heavenly Race,
The Raptures of Her Soul, the Glories of Her Face,
And what we Sing aloud
Let Echo double from a beamy Cloud.
III.
Think on Caecilia you that be
Enamourd of Angelick Symphony:
Think with a pious Rage,
On this our weary Pilgrimage;
This Vale of Tears, this heavy load of Life,
And contend to be as free,
And as easy as She,
Void of sorrow, void of strife:
Thus o're-whelm'd with Joy and Love,
You need not envy those above.
CHORUS.
Then while we are here, let us innocent be,
And as frolic as Music can make us,
That when we must waft over this troublesome Sea,
And the Monarch of Terrors overtake us,
We may practice Above, what we dote on beneath,
Loud Anthems of Life, in defiance of Death.
London, Printed for John Carr at the Middle Temple Gate, 1686.
