A discovery OF NEW LIGHT OR Ancient truths revived.

Containing principles and inferances of a Church way.

Matthew. 22.19. Ye are deceived, not knowing the scriptures. 1. Cor. 14.38. If
any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. Job. 19. verse 4. Though I had indeed
erred, mine error remains with me. Verse. 19. All my secres friends abhorred
me, and they whom I loved are turned against me. Printed in the year Anno

The Author to the Reader.
LO here gentle Reader a short description of the new Testament which was once
established by the blood of Christ: after that the old testament by the blood
of that his cross was disanulled: Remember that there be alwais a difference
put betwixt the covenant of grace, and the manner of dispensing it, which is
twofold: the form of administering the covenant before the death of Christ,
which is called the old testament; and the form of administering the covenant
since the death of Christ, which is called the new Testament or the kingdom of
heaven. In this little treatise the ordinances of Christ for the dispensing of
the covenant since his death are described: read, consider, compare the truth
here expressed with the frame, ministry and government of the assemblies of
the land: and accordingly give sentence, judge righteous judgment, and let
practice answerable to the truth follow thereupon: fear not the face of man,
love not the world, be not deceaved with the shapes of Angels of light, cast
away all prejudice against the truth, remember that Antechristianisme is a
mystery of iniquity and that it began to work early during the Apostles
life, and so grew by little and little to this strength and exaltation from
which it shall decline by degrees even til the man of sin be destroyed, whom
the L. shall consume wit^ the brightness of his coming, for God which
condemns the whore of Babylon is a strong Lord: Fare well.

The Author entreats the gen^le Read not to cavil or wrangle at the contents
of this present Treatise nor to ^raduce or calumniate his person in secret, but
by writing to discover the errors thereof which he desires may be manifested
to him, remembering that therein he shall perform a charitable work: for he that
converteth a sinner from going astray out of his way shall save a soul from
death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. Iam 5.20

A discovery of New Light, or ancient truths revived, Containing principals
and inferences of a churchvvay.
A Man may be a member of the visible Church and no member of the Catholic
Church, John 17, 12. Genesis 4, 11, 1^, Heb. 12, 1^, 2 Samuel 7.15.

A man may be a member of the Catholic church and no member of the visible
church. 1 King, 14, 13. Rev. 18, 4. Romans 11.4 1. King. 19, 18.

The Catholic church is the company of the Elect. John. 1^.20. and it is
invisible. Col. 1.20.

The visible church is a visible communion of saints. Mat 13.12. Act.
2.^.41.42.46. and 1.15. and 19.7. 1 Cor. 1, 2. Phil. ^, 1. al which are to be
accounted faithful and elect: Ephesians. 1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 1^, 13, 14 til they by
obstinacy in sin and apostasy declare the contrary. 1 John. 2, 19.2 Tim, ^.10
and. 1.1, 19.20.2. These, 3.14.15.2. Tim. ^.17.18-21.

It is one thing to be a Saint, another thing to be of the visible communion of
Saints. 1 King. 14, 13. compared with 2. Chron. 13, 8-12,

The communion of Saints is either Invisible or visible, Ephesians. 3.17. Mat. 18.10.
Heb. 1.14. 1 Cor. 3.13.9.13.

The invisible communion is with Christ 1 Cor. 15.28. Ephesians Elect 1.17.1. Cor.
13.13.


Invisible communion with Christ is by the spirit and faith, Ephesians. 3.17. and
4.4. and 2.22.

Invisible communion with the Elect. Men Heb. 1.14. Angels 1 Cor. 13.13


Men Elect are Dead Elect living are uncalled Living Elect living are called.


Communion with the Elect living is prayer proceeding from love, John. 17 20.

For them that are uncalled that they may be called, Romans 10.1.

For them that are called that they may be confirmed, Col. 1.9.12.

Communion with the Elect Angels is the help of their ministry. Mat 18, 10
Heb. 1, 14. Genesis 28 12. and 32.1 2. Psalm, 34, 7. reverence of them 1. Cor.
11.10. and love unto them. 1 Cor. 13, 13.

A visible communion of Saints is of two, three, or more saints joined together
by covenant with God and themselves, freely to use all the holy things of God
according to the word, for then mutual edification, and Gods glory. Mat. 18.20.
Deuteronomy, 29, 12. etc. Psalm. 147.19 and 149, 6-9. Rev. 1.16.

This visible communion of Saints is a visible Church. Mat. 18.20, Act. 1.15.
and 2.1.41.42.46.

The visible church is the only religious society that God has ordained for
men on earth. John. 14.6. Mat. 18, 20. and ^, 13.14. 2. Chron. 13.8.12. Act.
4.12. Rev. 18.4. 2. Cor 6.16-18.

All religious societies except that of a visible church are unlawful: as
Abbayes, monasteries, Nunries, Cathedrals, Collegiats, parishes.

The visible church is Gods ordinance and a means to worship god in. Ephesians. 4,
6.-6, Mark. 13.34. 2. Chron. 13.10.11. Heb. 3.6. compared with Heb. 8.5. and
3.2.-6.

No religious communion to be had, but with members of a visible church Mat.
18.17.20. 1. Cor. 5, 12. Act. 4.11.12. 2. Cor. 6.16-18. Rev, 18.4.

Whatsoever company or communion of men, do worship God, being not of the
communion of a visible church, sin. 2. Chron. 13.9.10. Mat. 15.9, 1. Cor.
5.12.13.

The true visible church is the narrow way that leads to life with few find
Ioh. 14.6. Mat. 7.14.

Other religious communions are the broad way that leads to destruction which
many find: Mat. 7.13. Acts. 4.12.

Gods word does absolutely describe unto us the only true shape of a true
visible church Mark. 13.34. 1, Cor. 12.5 Heb. 8.5. and 3.2.6* Rev. 22.18, 19.2.
Tim. 3, 16, 17. Romans 14.23. Heb. 11 6,

There is one only true shape or portraiture of a the visible church for there
is only one faith and truth in every thing. Ioh: 14.6, Ephesians. 4, 4, 5. 1 Cor
1.10.13. I h. 17.17.

Forms, or shapes, of visible churches or religious communions, to worship God
in or by, devised by men are intellectual Idols, or mental Idolatry. Exodus
20.4, 5, Mat, 15, 9.2. Coron 17, 8, 12. 1 King. 12.33.

Visible Churches or religious communions constituted according to the forged
devise of men are real Idols, and to join to them and to worship God in them
is to join to Idols, or to worship God in or by Idols, by consequent from the
former.

Visible churches or religious communions are either true or false, Ioh. 14.6.
Psalm. 119, 28 2 Chro 1, 8, 12. Ephesians. 4, 4, 5, 6.

True visible churches are such as have the true essential causes and
properties, which Gods word ascribes to the true visible Church, from the
definition thereof. False churches are the contrary to the true by portion.

To a true visible Church are requisite three things 1 True matter. 2. true
form. 3. true properties.

The true matter of a true visible Church are Saints, Exodus 28, 9, 10, 15-21.
compared with Rev. 11, 11-21. and 1 King ^, 17, compared wi^h 1 Pet. 2.5,
Levit. 1^. (...) 1^, ^^ 4^, compared with Rev 18, 2, 1 Pet. 2, De^. 1^, ^ ^om
1, 7, 1 Cor. 1, 2. Ephesians 1, 1, Phil. 1, 1, 1 Pet. 1, 2, Heb. 3, 1.

Saints are men separated from all known sin, practicing the whole will of Go^
kn^w^e unto them Col. 1, 2. and 2, 11-1^. Romans 17. and 6.2.12.22 growing in
grace and know^edg. 2. Pet. 3.18. continuing to the end 1. Ioh. 2.19.

The true form of a true visible Church is partly inward partly outward.

The inward part of the fo^me consists in 3. things 1. the Spirit. 2 Faith. 3
love.

The Spirit is the soul animating the whole body Ephe. 4 4. 1 Cor.
12.4.11-13.7-10. 1 Cor. 6.17.

Faith uniteth the members of the body to the head Christ: Ephesians. 3.1 and
4.13.15. and 5.30. 23. 1 Cor. 6.17.

Love uniteth the members of the body each to other. Ephesians. 2.20.21. and 4.16.3.
Col. 3.14.15.

The outward part of the true form of the true visible church is a vow,
promise, oath, or covenant betwixt God and the Saints: by proportion from the
inward form: see also Genesis 17.1.2. and 15, 18. Deuteronomy. 29.1 9-13.2. Chron.
29.10, and 34.30.32. Psalm. 119.106. Nehem. 9, 38. and 10.29. 1. Cor 12.25.26.
Romans 12, 5.15.16. Mat. 18.15.17.

This covenant has 2 parts. 1. respecting God and the faithful. 2. respecting
the faithful mutually. Mat. 18 20.

The first part of the covenant respecting God is either from God to the
faithful, or from the faithful to God 2. Cor 6, 16

From God to the faithful. Mat, 22.3.2. the sum whereof is expressed. 2. Cor.
6.16. I will be their God.

To be God to the faithful is 1. to give Christ, 2. with Christ al things else
Esaias 9.6. 1. Tim. 4.8.2. Pet. 1.3. Romans 8.32. 1. Cor. 3.21-13.

From the faithful to God 2. Cor. 6.16. the sum whereof is to be Gods people,
that is to obey all the commandments of God. Deuteronomy. 29.9.

The second part of the covenant respecting the faithful mutually, contains
all the duties of love whatsoever Levit. 19.17- Mat. 18.15, 16, 1. These. 5.14.
Mat. 22.39.2. These, 3, 14.45. Heb. 3.13 and 10, 24 25.

The true properties of a true Church visible are two. I communion in all the
holy things of God. 2, the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Ioh. 1, 5. 1, Cor
10 16 and 5.4.5. Mat, 18.20. Esaias 55, 3 Act 13, 34.

The holy things of God are 1. Christ. 2. benefits by Christ. Rom, 8.32

The true Church has title, possession, and use of Christ. Esa. 9 6, Song 2
16. Mat. 18.20. 1. Cor. 3 21.23. Ephesians 5 30

The benefits which the true Church has by Christ are the means of salvation
and alms, 1 Timothy 14 8, 2 Pet. 1, 3.

The means of salvation are the word, Sacraments, prayers. Censures, and the
ordinances of Christ for the dispensing of them all, Romans 3, 2, and 4, 11. Luk
19 46, Mat. 18, 15, 17. Act. 2, 42, 1 Cor. 11, 23, 26, Mat. 28, 19, Psalm. 149,
6, 9.

Alms are the works of mercy yielded to the Saints in distress. Act. 2, 44,
45, and 5, 4, Mat. 25, 34, 40, Heb. 13, 1, 3, 1 Timothy 3, 2, and 5, 10.

The power of the Lord Jesus Christ given to the church has three parts.

viz. power to 1. receive in. Ioh. 10.3. Ast. 9, 26.27. and 18, 27. and 6, 5. 2
preserve and keep within 1 John. 2, 19. 1 Pet, 1, 5. 3. to cast out 1 Cor 5, 13.


The true visible Church has power to ceive in (...) Members into communion.
Act 2, 41, and 18, 27, and 9, 26, 27. and 2. officers into office Act 6.5. and
14, 23.

The way or door whereby both members and officers enter in, is Christ, that
is the way taught by Christ in his word. Ioh, 14, 6. and 17.17. Marc. 13, 34,
^7.

The way of receiving in of members is faith testified by obedience. Act 8 36,
37. Mat, 3, 6. Luke 7, 29.30.

Faith is the knowledge of the doctrine of salvation by Christ. 1 C^r, 12, 9
Gal, 3, 2.

Obedience is a godly, righteous and sober life Tit. 2, 11, 12, Rom, 5.

Members thus received into communion are of two sorts. 1 Prophets a private
persons 1 Cor, 14.24. 1 Samuel 19, 24, 23.

Prophets are men endued with gifts apt to utter matter fit to edification,
exhortation, and consolation. 1 Cor, 14, 3. Act, 13, 1. Rom 12, 6.

These persons must first be appointed to this exercise by the Chu ch, 1 Cor 14
49. Act. 13, 1.

The Prophets care must be to prophecy according to the proportion of faith.
Rom, 12, 6, 1 Cor 14, 26.

Let the Prophets speak two or three and let the rest judge. ^ C^r. 14, 29

If any thing be revealed to him that sits by, let the first hold his peace.
1 Cor 14, 30, 40.

All that have gifts may be admitted to prophecy. 1 C^r, 14, 31.

Private persons are a men 2. women.

Private men present at the exercise of prophecy may modestly propound their
doubts which are to be resolved by the Prophets: Luk, 2, 46.47, 1 Samuel., 19, 20,
23 1 Cor. 4, 30.

Women are not permitted to speak in the church in time of Prophecy 1 Cor 14,
34. 1 Timothy 2, 12, Revel, 2 20.

If women doubt of any thing delivered in time of prophecy and are willing to
learn, they must ask them that can teach them in private, as their husbands
at home if they be faithful* or some other of the Church, 1 Cor, 14, 35, 1 Timothy, 2 12.

To this exercise of Prophecy may be admitted unbeleevers or they that are
without. 1 Cor 14, 24. Act, 2, 6, 13.

The exercise of prophecy, and the preaching of the word by them that are sent,
is that ordinary means God has appointed to convert men. 1 Cor. 14, 24, 25.
Rom, 10, 14 14.

They are sent by God to preach whom the church sends. Act 13, 2, 4, and 8,
14, 15.

If any man be converted by other means it is not ordinary. Rom 10, 14, 15.
John, 4, 39, 41. Act 9 5, 6

Therefore they that are converted in false Churches, are not converted by
ordinary means. 1 King 14.13. and 19.18. Rom.11.3.4. Rev. 18.4.

The way of receiving officers into office is, 1 Election, 2 Approbation, 3
Ordination: which must be performed with fasting and prayer, Act. 6, 5. and 14,
23. 1 Timothy 3.10. and 5.22. and 4.14. Tit. 1.5. Act. 13.3.

The person to be admitted into office must first be a member of that visible
church whence he has his calling, Act. 1, 21, 22, and 6, 3, 5. and 18, 27, 28,
1 Cor. 11, 12, and 3, 6, 1 Timothy 3, 2, 3, 10.

Election is by most voices of the members of the Church in full communion.
Act. 6.5. and 14.23.

Quaere: whether women, servants and children admitted into full communion, yet
under age may not give voice in elections, excommunications, and other public
affairs of the Church, 1 Pet. 3.7. Ephesians. 4.4. 1 Timothy 5.9.10. Number. 30.5-10-16.
1 Cor. 14.34. Genesis 3.16. 1 Cor. 11.3.10. Genesis 18.19. Josh. 24.15.

Approbation is the examining and finding the officer elect, to be according to
the rules of his office, 1 Timothy 3.10. and 5.9.10. Act. 6.3.

In approbation every member is bound to object what he can, especially they
that denied their voices, Act. 15, 37, 38. 1 Timothy 3.2.3, 10. Act. 6.3.

Approbation must be after election, least without cause the infirmities of the
brethren be discovered: for there are faults disabling men to offices which do
not disable them to be members of the church Ezekiel 44.9, 15. Act. 15.^7.38. Mat.
18.21.22. compared with Prove. 10 12. 1 Pet. 4.8.

If the things objected bear weight against the officer elect, the election is
void and they must proceed to the choice of another. 1 Timothy 3, 4, 5. and 5.11.
Act. 15, 37, 38. Ezee. 44.10. 2 King. 23.9.

Defects or faults that cast men out of office. are sufficient to hinder men
from entering into office: by proportion.

If the things objected be frivolous the el^ction is approved. 1 Timothy 3.10. and
they that dissented are to consent to the rest that so the whole church may
agree in one person. 1 Cor. 1.10. Ephesians. 4.3 compared with Act 1.26.

If the parties objecting still dissent without an approved reason, they are to
be reformed by censure. 1 Cor. 11, 17, 18. Mat. 18 15, 17.

Ordination is the dedication of the officer thus approved, to his office Exodus
29 44. and 40, 12, 16. Nomb, 8, 6, 15. Heb. 5, 4, 5, Mat, 3.1^ 17 Act 13, 3, 4.
1 Timothy, 4, 14. Heb. 6, 2. Ordination has three parts.

The first is the power which the Church commits to the officer approved: to
administer according to his office Ioh. 20, 21, 23, Mat. 1^ 1^ 20, c^mpared
with Exodus 29, 1, 38 N^mb 8.10.11. Act, 6, 3 5 and 14, 23, and 20, 28 ^ Tim.
4.14. 2 Timothy 1, 6, 14.

The second is prayer made by the whole church for the officer invested with
this power that he may faithfully administer Act 6, 6, and 13, 1, and 14, 13 1
Cor 4, 2.

The 3. is a change given to the officer thus admitted to look unto his office
in all the parts th^^eo^. Mat, 28, 18 19 1 Timothy 5, 21. 1 Pet, 5, 1, 2, 1 Timothy 6,
13, 14, c^mpared with Deuteronomy 1.16.

The ceremony used by the Apostles in ordination is imposition of hands: which
ceremony first of all was used in the old testament, Number 8, 10. then in the new
by Christ in praying for children. Mar 10, 16. by God the Father in ordeining
Christ to his office of Mediator. Luke 3, 21, 22 by Christ in ordeining the
Apostles. Act 2, 3, 4, and 1, 4.8, by the Apostles in giving the holy Ghost Act
8, 15, 17, in ordeining Evangelists 2 T^m, 1 6, and in ordeining ordinary
ministers: Act 6 6, and 14, 23, by the Eldership or church in ordeining
officers Act 13 3. 1 Timothy 4, 4. by the Evangelists in ordeining officers. 1 Timothy, 22 Tit, 1 5. and so may lawfully be retained and used in the church still.
Heb, 6, 2.

The use of imp^sition of hands, is two fold.

First to point out the officer in time of prayer made for him, as if it should
be said: this is the man by proportion from 1. Sam. 10, 24. Math. 3.17.

Secondly to signify and to assure the officer to be ordained that the Lord by
the church gives him power to administer, Act. 13, 3.4. and 20, 28. Ioh, 20,
21.

Ordination and so imposition of hands apperteineth to the whole church as does
election and approbation, Act. 13, 3. Number. 8, 9, 10. yet for order sake the
fittest members lay on hands and perform all other particulars of ordination
for and in the name of the whole church, 1 Cor. 14.40 compared with Number. 8,
9.10. and Act. 13.3, and 1 Timothy, 4, 14. and by proportion from Lev. 4.15.

The fittest persons are Elders when the church has them. 1 Timothy 4.14. when
the church wants Elders, men of best gifts appointed by the church. Number.
8.9.10.

Thus after the apostasy of Antichrist arises a true Ministry in the church.
Revel. 18.4.

The officers of the true visible church thus admitted, are then to administer
faithfully. 1 Timothy 3.10, 1 Cor, 4, 2.

The officers of the true visible Church are all absolutely described in the
word of God, Heb. 3, 2, 5. and 8, 5. Rom 12, 7.8. Mark. 13, 34.

These officers are of two sorts: 1 Bishops, 2 Deacons, Phil 1, 1.

The Bishops are also called Elders or Presbyters. Act. 20, 17.28, 1 Pet. 5, 1.

The Bishops or Elders jointly together are called the Eldership or
Presbytery, 1 Timothy 4, 14. and 5, 17. compared.

The Eldership consists of 3 sorts of persons or officers: viz. the Pastor,
Teacher, Governor, 1 Timothy 4.14, and 5, 17.

All the Elders or Bishops must be apt to teach, 1 Timothy 3, 2. Tit. 1 9.

The Pastor is a Bishop excelling in the word of wisdom or exhortation: Romans
12, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 8. he is called the Angel of the church, Rev. 2, and 3

The Teacher is a Bishop excelling in the word of knowledge or doctrine, Romans
12, 7. 1 Cor 12, 8.

The Governor is a Bishop excelling in the quality of wise government, 1 Timothy
5, 17. Romans 12 8.

The Pastor and Teacher have also power to administer the Sacraments. Mat. 28,
19. Ephesians. 4, 12. 1 Cor. 11, 23.

All the Bishops deal by office in the government of the church, 1 Timothy 5.17,
and are conversant about the soul and spiritual part, Ioh. 18, 36. 2 Cor, 10,
3.

The Deacons are officers occupied about the works of mercy respecting the body
or outward man Act. 6.2.

The Deacons are 1 men, 2 or women deacons or widows, Act. 6.2. Romans 16.1.

Men Deacons collect and distribute with simplicity the churches treasury,
according to the churches necessities, and the Saints occasions. Ro^. 12, 8. 2
Cor. 8, 2.8. 1 Cor. 16.2.3.

The churches treasury, is silver gold or money worth, freely given by the
members of the visible church for the common good. Lev. 27. toto. 2. King.
12.^4-16. Luke 21.4. Act. 4.34, 35. 2 Cor 8, 2-8. and 9.7.

The churches treasury is holy. Mat. 27.6. Luke 21.4. Quaere.

None of those that are without may cast of their goods into the treasury,
lest the treasury be polluted. 2 Cor. 8, 4, Josh. 6, 17-19 Q^aere.

Nothing that is gotten by fraud, violence, or any wicked means, may be cast
into the churches treasury. Deuteronomy. 23.18. Micah 1, 7. Esa. 67, 3.

The use of the churches treasury is peculiar to the Saints: and it consists
in provision for holy things, or holy persons. Deuteronomy. 14, 2.5.21. Exodus
30.12-16. Quaere.

Holy things: as bread and wine for the Lords Supper, places and instruments
serviceable to holy uses Exodus 25, 2, 8. Mat. 27.7. per contrarium.

Holy persons: as the maintenance of church officers and the poor brethren
either of that particular visible church or of any other true church 1 Cor. 10,
^.2. 2 Cor. 8, 7. 1 Cor. 9.6.14. 1 Timothy 5, 17, 18.

In the necessity of the church, if they that are without bestow any thing
upon the Saints, they may receive and use it with thanksgiving. 1 Cor 10, 25,
26.

If it be manifested by evidence, that the goods of them that are without
offered to the Saints be the treasures of wickedness, the Saints are not to
receive and use them to avoid offense, 1 Cor. 10, 28 29.

Women deacons or widows are of 60 years of age, qualified according to the
Apostles rule, 1 Timothy 5 9. releeving the bodily infirmities of the Saints with
cheerfulnes, Romans 12, 8, and 16, 1.

Hitherto of the churches power of receiving in: now follows the churches
power of pr^serving and keeping within.

The power of preserving within, is manifested by the heedful use of all the
holy things of God by the whole church jointly, and by every member
particularly, Mark. 13, 33-37 Heb. 10 24, 1 These. 5, 14, Mat. 18, 15.17. Act.
6, 1.

The Pastors chief endeavor must be to make the church zealous holy and
obedient, Romans 12.8. 1 Cor. 12, 8. Apoc. 3, 19, by proportion.

The Teachers chief care must to be preserve the church from ignorance and
error 1 Cor. 12, 8. Romans 12, 7. 1 Cor 3, 10, 12. compared with Tit. 1, 9.

The chief office of the governors consists in preserving peace and order
in the Church, 1 Cor. 14.40, Romans 12.8. 1 Timothy 5, 17.

The Deacons chief care must be that none of the Saints want bodily
necessaries, and that due provision be made for holy things and persons, Romans
12, 8. John. 13, 29. and that with simplicity John 12.6.

The widows chief office is to visit and relieve the widow fatherless,
sick, lame, blind, impotent, women with child, and diseased members of the
Church, 1 Timothy 5, 9, Romans 12.8, Mat. 15, 35-40.

The care of the Eldership must be the order, direct and moderate the public
actions of the church. 1 Cor. 14, 40. 1 Timothy 5.17.

The prophets chief care must be to resolve doubts, difficulties, and dark
places, and to give true expositions, translations, and reconciliations of
scripture. 1 Cor. 14, 29, 30. Luke 2.46, 47.

The office of the pastor and teacher in the exercise of prophecy is to
moderate and determine all matters out of the word. 1 Cor. 14 32. 1 Samuel 19, 20.

The care of the whole church jointly, must be to keep her power given her by
Christ, and not to suffer any open known sin, or any tyranny or usurpation
over them. Mat. 18, 15-17. Mark. 13, 37. Col. 4, 17. 3 John 9, 10. Rev. 2, 2.
Gal, 1, 8.9.

The chief care of every member must be to watch over his brother Mark. 13,
37. Heb. 10, 24. in bearing one another burden Gal. 6, 2, 1 Cor. 10, 24.28, 29
admonishing the unruly, comforting the feeble minded. 1 These. 5, 14,
admonishing the excommunicate 2 These. 3, 15, restoring them that are fallen.
Gal. 6.1.

Here special care must be had of admonition, Mat. 18.15-17.

Admonition must be administered with prayer and in love, 1 Timothy 4, 5, Gal. 6,
1, Lev. 19, 17, 1 Timothy 1, 5, Romans 13, 8.

Prayer is needful that it may please God to give his blessing to the
admonition administered, Mat. 7, 7, 8. Iam. 1, 5, and 4, 2.3.

Love must be manifested to the offender that he may be the better won. Ephesians.
4, 2. Col. 3.14, Lev. 19, 17, 1 Pet. 4, 8.

Admonition is either private or public. Mat. 18, 15, 17.

Private admonition is either solitary or before witnesses, ibidem.

Private admonition is performed by one particular brother offended, to another
brother offending, and that in secret, Mat 18, 15.

The admonisher must not tell the fault of the offender to another, but himself
must admonish the offe^der, Psalm. 15, 3. 1 Pet 4, 8, Pro. 25, 9.

If the offender repent upon admonition, the fault must be covered Pro. 10.12.
if not the admonisher must proceed to the second degree of admonition: viz. to
admonish the offender before witness. Mat. 18.16,

The fittest witnesses must be chosen. 1 King. 21.10.13. Mat. 26-59-61. and
28.12-15. the fittest witnesses for the most part are the Elders, who for their
wisdom and authority can best sway with the delinquent.

If the offender repent upon admonition before witness, the fault must yet be
covered also Prove. 10.12. 1. Pet, 4, 8, Iam 5.20.

If the offender admonished before witness deny the fact, then protestation or
an oath of God must end the matter, Exodus 22.11.

Though the admonisher know the fact to be so* and the offender deny the fact
before witness, yet the admonisher is not to forsake the offenders communion.
John. 5.31. and 13.26. notwithstanding he must still seek to bring him to
repentance Levit. 19.17.

If the offender acknowledge the fact and repent not, the admonisher and
witnesses must bring the matter to the church. Mat. 18, 17.

In bringing the matter to the church if the Elders be not already interessed
in the cause, it is meet to use the advice and help of the Eldership who are
fittest to deal in all public businesses, 1 Cor. 14, 33, 40. 1 Timothy 5, 17.

The matter being before the Church the offender is to be dealt with by all
possible means, that he may come to repentance, as by admonition, by threat, by
entreaty, by prayer for him etc. Gal. 6.1. 2 Cor. 2.6.

If the offender repent upon the Churches admonition, he is still to be
continued, and accounted a brother. 2 Cor. 2.6. Mat, 18, 17.

Thus the church and all the members thereof shall be preserved and kept pure
within, and their communion shall be holy: Lev. 19.17. 1. Tim. 5.22. 1 Cor. 5,
20. and 5.6. and so shall increase with the increasing of God. 1 Cor. 11, 17. 2
Pet. 3.18.

All the degrees of admonition must be administered upon the offender before the
Church have any communion with him: Mat, 18, 15-17, 1 Cor. 11.17, 1 Timothy 5, 22.
Levit, 19.18. Mat. 22 29.

If a man see his brother sin, and admonish him not, but suffer his sin
unreproved he is defilled therewith. Levit. 19, 17. Mat. 18.15. and 22.33. 1 Timothy 5.22.

In solitary admonition, if the admonisher stay in the first degree of
admonition, the offe^der not repe^ting he is defiled with the sin:

In admonition before witness, if the admonishers cease and stay in the second
degree of admonition the offender not repenting, they are defiled with the sin.

In admonition before the church if the church bear with the party offe^ding
and bring him not to repent: but leave him in sin and impenitency, and yet hold
him still in communion, then the whole church is defiled: and so that is
verified, a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 1 Cor. 5.6 and 11, 17. Mat.
13.33.

If a sin be publickely known in a church, or if more sins be openly known
and suffered: the whole church is defiled and leavened. Ibidem.

No communion can be had with, nor no joining ca^ be to, a church thus leavened
without manifest consenting to sin, Ibidem.

Therefore if the church will not reform open known corruptions after due
proceeding separation must be made from it till reformation come.

Therefore separation may be made from true churches for incorrigible
corruptions, and to separate from a defiled church that is incorrigible, is not
to forsake the communion of holy things, but the pollution and profanation of
holy things.

Thus much for the second part of the churches power of preserving and keeping
within.

The churches power of casting out follows, which is twofold.

First of officers out of office, Act, 14.23, compared with Colos. ^.17. Rev, 2
2, Gal. 1.8.9.

Second of members out of communion Mat. 18.1^. 1 Cor. 5, 4, 5. 2 These. 3.6.14,
1 Timothy, 1.20.

The cause of casting officers out of office, are apostasy or disability. Ezec.
44, 10. Nom. 8, 23-26.

Apostasy is when the officers shall fall to open Idolatry, Atheism, heresy,
or other sins equipollent of the first or second table: Ezech. 44.10, and by
proportion drawn from 2 King. 23.9 1 Timothy 3.2, Lev. 22.1-5 and 21, 16, 24,
Ezra 2, 61, 62.

The officer upon repentance after apostasy or sin equipollent thereto may be
retained as a member of the church, but not as an officer. Eze 44, 13, 14, Mat.
26, 69-75. compared with John 21, 15-18. Act. 15, 38. Quaere

Disabilitie is either of age, or sickness, or mayming, etc

Disabilitie of age is when the officer can no longer by reason of old age
discharged the works of his office: then he may reteyn his dignity and ought to
be honored of all, Number. 8, 23,-26. Philemon 9.

Disability by sickness, as frenzy, Madness, Melancholy, or by mayming as loss
of the tongue in the pastor or teacher etc. or by any other infirmity disabling
him to the actions of his office, Lev. 16-24, compared with 1 Timothy 3, 2, Tit.
1, 6, 9, Quaere, Whither an officer may refuse an office imposed upon him by a
lawful calling. Exodus, 4, 14, Ier. 1.6, 7, 17.

Quaere, Wether the church may suffer her officer to be translated from her
self to other churches upon any ground, Act. 20, 28, 1 Pet. 5 2, Act 13.4. yea
though it be granted that she have members as fit for offices as her officers
are in present? yea though the life of the officer be endaungered, Act. 9, 25.
Mat. 10, 23 1 King. 18 4.

The cause of casting members out of communion is only one: viz. sin
obstinately stood in without repentance and confession after due conviction,
Mat. 18, 17. Job 31, 33. Prove. 28, 13.

Due conviction is the discovery of the sin by manifest evidence, Job. 19, 4,
and 32.12.13, and 39, 37.

Manifest evidence is either to the fact, or sinfulnes of the fact.

The fact is evident either by confession of the party that committed the
fact: or by sufficient witness, Mat. 26.65. Deuteronomy 19, 15, John 5, 31.

Quaere, whether the testimony of them that are without, is sufficient or no.

The sinfulness of the fact is evident either by direct Scripture, or by
necessary consequence from the scripture. Mat. 22, 31, 32, and 4, 4.

Due conviction is perceived two ways, first by the delinquents shifting,
cavils, excursions, tergiversations etc. 1 Timothy 1.6, Tit, 3, 11, Secondly by the
conscience of them that have power to censure the fact. Psalm. 36, 1, Prove, 17,
19. Tit, 3, 10. 1 Cor, 2, 15 and 12, 10.

Obstinacy in sin is the refusing of confessing and forsaking the crime. Pro.
28.13. Mat. 18, 17. Ioth. 7, 1, 9.

If the matter be not evident, but doubtful and controversall, communion still
must be preserved peaceably, notwithstanding diversity of judgment, till the
truth be discovered. Phil. 3, 15 16. 1 Cor. 13.49.7.9.

Persons that differ in judgment are either strong or weak. Romans 15.1

The strong must not maintain controversies with the weak, nor despise them,
but bear their infirmity and burden, Romans 15, 1 and 14.1, 3. Gal. 6, 2. 1 Cor
13, 5, 7. and 9, 22, and 10, 23.34.

The weak must not censure or judge the strong as delinquents, but meekly desire
instruction and satisfaction, Romans 14.3. Mat. 7, 1-3.

Thus must men walk in diversity of opinion, during which time, all men must
carefully search out the truth, and labor for information 1 Cor. 1.10. 2 Pet.
3.18. Phil. 3.15, Iam. 1.5.

The power given the Church for casting out obstinate convicted offenders is
the power of excommunication. 2 Cor. 18.3 6. and 1, 5, 4, 5, 1 Timothy, 1.20. Gal.
5, 12, 2 Thessalonians. 3, 6, 14. Mat. 18.17.

Quaere, whether delivering to Satan be not, or contain some bodily punishment
inflicted upon the offender. see. Act. 5, 5, 10, 1. Cor. 12.10.

Excommunication is the depriving of the offender of the visible communion of
Saints, and the benefit of the holy things of God given to the Church. 1 Cor.
5.4, 5, 11, 13.2. These. 3, 6, 14. Mat. 18.17.

Quaere, Whether separating, withdrawing, turning away from false teachers and
wicked liver^, be the same with excommunication, 2 These 3, 6. 1 Timothy 5, 6. and
2, 3, 5. Mat 18, 17. 1 Cor. 5, 4, 5.

Excommunication duly administered is ratified and confirmed in heaven. Mat.
18.18. Job. 20.23.

Therefore the party excommunicate is in the hands of Satan, and out of the
Lords protection and blessing, being deprived of all the public means of
salvation. Mat. 18, 17. Cor. 5.5. Esaias 4.5, 6.

In excommunication consider two things: first the decreing of it, which must
be done by the whole church. 1 Cor. 5 4, wherein the church must proceed as in
approving her officers. Secondly the pronouncing of excommunication which must
be performed by the fittest person deputed thereto by the Church. 1. Cor. 14,
40.

The end of excommunication is not the destruction of the offender, but the
mortification of his sin, and the salvation of his soul 1 Cor. 5.5.2. These.
3.14.15. 1 Timothy 1, 23,

The party excommunicate is not to be counted as an enemy, but to be
admonished as a brother, 2 Thessalonians. 5.15. Quaere,

The members of the church are to avoid all religious and civil communion with
him that is excommunicate, Mat, 18.1^. 1 Cor 5, 11, except that subjects,
servants, children, parents, wise or husband etc. that are bound to him may
perform civil and natural offices to him. 1. Cor. 7 5, 12.13, and by
proportion.

The party excommunicate upon repentance is to be admitted again into the
communion of the visible Church. 2 Cor. 2.6-8. yet so as that the Church
always have an especial eye to him, as being a suspicious person that durst
despise the Church, Mat. 18.17. Ezech. 4^, 10. 2 Pet. 2.22. Heb. 10.26. by
proportion.

Quaere, Whether an officer excommunicate, upon repentance may be again
admitted into office: and whether must he have new vocation by election
approbation, ordination yea or nay?

The visible Church walking in this holy order has in it the presence and
protection of Christ. Esa. 4.5.6. Mat 28 20. and 18.20.

To this visible Church must al sorts of persons resort that desire to be
saved. Act. 4, 12. Mat. 7.13.14. Ioh 1^.6.

True visible churches are of two sorts: first pure where no open known sin
is suffered. Rev. 2.7-13. and 3.8-11. second corrupt, wherein some one or more
open known sin is tolerated. Rev. 3.1.6. 1 Cor. 11.17.21.22.

True visible Churches are so far forth good as they agree to the pattern of
the word: Heb. 8.5. Rev. cap. 2. and 3.1 Cor. 1, 2, 17.22.

Every true visible Church has title to whole Christ and all the holy things of
God. Esa. 9.6, 7. Song. 2.16. Ephe. 1.22.23.

Every true visible Church is of equal power with all other visible Churches.
Apoc. cap. 2. and 3. 1. Cor. 5. and has power to reform al abuses within it
self 1 Cor. 11.2.17. which power is spiritual as is Christ's kingdom not
worldly, bodily, nor carnal, Ioh. 18, 36, 2 Cor. 10, 3.5.

The erecting of visible churches apperteyneth to princes and private persons.

Princes must erect them in their dominions and command all their subjects to
enter into them, being first prepared and fitted thereto. 2. Chron. 29. and 34.
and 17.

Private persons separating from all sin, and joining together to obey Christ
their king, priest and prophet, as they are bound, are a true visible Church,
and have a Charter given them of Christ thereto, being but two or three. Mat.
18, 20. Act. 14, 19, 20. Heb. 11.38. and further power then to reform
themselves they have none.

Every man is bound in conscience to be a member of some visible church
established into this true order. Mat. 7.13. Rev. 18.4.

Because every man is bound to obey Christ in his kingdom and spiritual
regiment and no other Luke 19, 14, 27 and the true visible church is Christ's
kingdom and house Mark 13.34. with Luk 19, 14.27, Act. 1, 3. Heb 12, 28, and
3, 6,

Therefore they that are not members of this visible church, are no subjects of
Christ's kingdom Luke 19.17, 1 Cor, 5.12.

This true visible church is called Christ. 1 Cor. 12.12.

Thus much concerning the true church: the false church of Antichrist follows
to be considered.

Whatsoever thing is contrary to this order of the visible church is
Antichristian, by notation of the word compared with 1. Cor. 12.12.

Whosoever takes upon him to erect new form or shappes of visible churches,
and to appoint new officers, laws, ministry, worship, or communion in the
church is Antichrist. 1. John. 4 3. 2 These. 2.4 Rev. 13.16.17.

Whosoever yields or submits to any other constitution, laws, officers,
ministry or worship then that of Christ's appoyntement is the subjecte, servant
of Antichrist, by necessary consequence from the former. and Romans 6.16.

A man cannot be both the servant of Christ and of Antichrist. Mat. 6, 24.
