The Hunting of the Fox. A NEW SONG.
To the Tune of, Now the Tories that Glories, etc.
I.
HEy Jouler, Ringwood, and Towzer,
Ho Smoaker, Drunkard, and Fly;
Sweet-lips, Light-foot, and Bowzer;
Brave Bowman, Lofty, and Cry;
And Four and Twenty brave Couple,
To make a Pack for the Downs,
Sure footed, and your Limbs supple;
The Scent's hot yet on the Grounds.
The Old White Fox is got loose again;
We think he is gone to ketch Goose again:
His Cubs they sculk and desert amain.
Come let us beleaguer their Holes:
For they are past Evil; to the Devil
We'll send 'em with thread bare Souls.
II.
They have left the City, it is pity,
And their damned Party in the Lurch:
If to be Hanged, 'twould be pretty,
For Treason against King and Church.
For Sink-ports, Venus and Juno;
For Champian, Thunder and Spark;
Let Swift beat for Caralino,
And Noser wind 'em in the Dark.
Like Wasps and Flies, they would bite us;
As Wolves do Sheep, they would treat us;
Like Crockadiles, they would eat us;
They thirst for Innocent Blood:
Then never scruple, but graple
For King and Country's Good.
III.
Round the Demantion of the Nation,
Beat all the Banks on the Shore;
And some leap over the main Ocean,
If they are gone before.
O surround 'em, confound 'em,
From Seaport to City-Walls;
If there they venture to shelter,
Zounds, tear 'em out of their Holes:
For making Church into Stables,
And vaumping Kings up of Baubles,
And forging Plots out of Fables,
And seizing Kings in a trice;
That the crooked Piper, might vapor
Like Rat amongst Fifteen Mice.
IV.
Scour the Globe to the Axels,
From Pole to Pole then retire,
And center at Mother Creswels;
The Fox used to Harbor there:
There, there both Wives, Whores and Virgins,
He had them all at his Call,
T'oblige his Captains and Surgions,
'Till better Occasions fall.
At Oxford late all his Cubs and He,
To the Exclusion did all agree;
Could not budge further, till signed and free.
Yet Rowley rouzed the Rump,
And sent 'em all to Pegg Trantams;
And Tapsky's worn to the Stump.
V.
Oh, Swift's returned, and Noser,
Their Hoofs are battered with Greet:
The Game shows by the Opposer,
He Is lodged in Aldersgate Street.
Come ring a Peal with a Courage,
The Grains of the Tap makes a Train;
He lurks in the Hole to make Forage
Of all that uses his Name.
We'll fetch him out with Mandamus,
And hang him with Ignoramus;
There Is none but Rebels can blame us:
More Pardons let him not hope;
For all his Squinting and Blinking,
He must to th'Hatchet or Rope.
LONDON, Printed for J. D. in the Year, 1682.
