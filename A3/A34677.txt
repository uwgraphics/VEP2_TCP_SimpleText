FUIMUS The Right Honble. Charles Viscount Bruce of Ampthill (^en ^. Heir
Apparent of Thomas Earl of ^^^^bury) and Baron Bruce of Whorleton


To His most SERENE HIGHNESS, RICHARD, Lord PROTECTOR OF THE Commonwealth of
England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories thereunto
belonging.
May it please Your Highness,
AS nothing can be presented to the Potentates of the World of greater value,
then the Labors of Famous Historiographers, who describe to the life the
Examples of such Eminent Personages as were transcendent in preceding Ages; and
may in their Successors beget both Emulation and Experience: so shall I not
need to apprehend that this History (which in all humility I present unto Your
Highness) will prove unacceptable, since therein You may encounter with such a
Model of all kind of Virtues and Perfections, as I hope may take a deeper
impression in Your Highnesses Breast, in regard that it will be found, that Art
herein is seconded by Nature. And whereas I am under the lash of a severe
Castigation for my presumption, in profering this History to Your Review, as I
acknowledge, when I seriously consider how You have attracted to Your Self that
lively Pourtraiture of his Great Soul, that You appear the true Emblem both of
his Virtues and Majesty.

May it please Your most Serene Highness, I cannot choose but address this
present Oblation as to Your Self, so in other Languages, to the rest of the
Princes and Potentates of the Earth, I bequeath it unto posterity, very humbly
craving the favorable Protection of Your Highnesses Patronage. Nor durst I
publish so glorious a Work to the World, before I had craved Your Highnesses
pardon for my Rashness, in adventuring to trace those Vigorous Lineaments in
the Alexander, whom Your Highness so well resembles, and in whom your Highness
bears so great a part. Moreover, as a sole Apelles could only be capable of
so great an Enterprise, so it will be altogether unnecessary for me to
endeavor the Description of that Pourtraiture, which so evidently is
manifested to all the World, both in Your Highnesses Person and Actions:
Wherefore, my Lord, I must needs confess, that Your Highness is the true
Original, and mine only relating to the Outside of so Great and unalterable
an Albionist. The truth is, I find not in my self ability to express the Real
Worth of His Accomplishments, and Hardy Features, accompanied with that
Vivacity and Luster, which secret Mystery lies only in the Hand of that great
Master of Nature, and Extant in that very Personage, whose Simile is hardly
this Day to be found in the whole Universe, except in Your Inimitable Self. Nor
does Art or Humane frailty allow so much to be in the Possession of the best
men. Therefore those who go about to Pourtraict such like Incomparable
Personages, cannot avoid one of those extremities, which Painters run into when
they go about to represent the Sun; who either place themselves at so great a
distance, as that they can only discover an ineffications and feeble
Reflections of its Beams; or approach so near unto it, as that being dazzled
with its Resplendency, and overcome with its Heat, they are bereaved of their
Senses, and retain only their Hearts at liberty to adore and admire that
powerful Hand, which formed so glorious a Creature. To the like Non plus am I
reduced, who rashly ascend to the very summit of the Throne of Honor, thence
to contemplate his late Highness Person, surrounded by so glorious a
Resplendency as no eyes are able to behold, nor to be comprehended by the
minds of men; so that I must needs sink under the burden, and content my self
with the Poets Expression, -- Inopem me copia fecit.
In which ecstasy all my Senses being surprised, my Heart is only left free to
admire, and my Tongue to plead Excuses, and offer up good Wishes, which I most
humbly Dedicate and Devote unto Your most Serene Highness. Nor could the
Heavens have ever established a more fitting Personage, to bear a share in, or
inclination unto this Work, then Your Highness, as well as to defend it from
Envy it self. And if so be History be a second Life, Your Highness may judge by
the black Attempts which threatened Your Glorious Father, how this Work will be
assailed; and how many Enemies its Author must resolve to enter into the Lists
withal: their Rage being thereby renewed and augmented, by their perceiving
that the Tomb has only bereaved us of the least part of this Great Hero. And
how malicious soever their Envy may appear in such Stories which possibly may
be written in Contradiction hereof; it will only publish from Truth it self,
to the World, their inveterate Spleen, which can never pierce through the
bright Rays of his Innocent and Glorious Actions.

Moreover, whereas the Divine Providence has so often and miraculously
preserved the first life of his late Highness, against the Attempts both of men
and monsters; Your most Serene Highness is also engaged, as well by Imitation,
as by the Interest of Your Care and Royal Dignity, to watch over the
Preservation of his second Life, which is in Your Highness by so Lawful a
Succession, as is devolved upon Your Self. The Glorious Course whereof I
resolve to trace from this very moment; that I may the better publish the
Illustrious Transactions thereof in five other Languages, which during my
Travels I have acquired. In which also I intend to publish this present
History, the French being already perfected and fit for the Press: His great
Soul expecting proportionable Honors to its Dignity; and his vaste Mind
requiring number less Elegies, which may remain as so many living Monuments,
not to be defaced by Times Violence nor Envy. But I press this Subject too home
to Your Highness, since You bear so great a share therein, and my self dare
attribute so little of it to my own incapacity, of compassing so great an
undertaking.

Wherefore, I shall only hereby endeavor to attract others, and to show them
the Borders and Coast of that vaste Sea into which they ought to lanch: so that
like to a Forelorn Hope, I shall only first mount the Breach, and by diverse
Languages animate all the Trumpets of Fame, to Celebrate the Glory of his late
Highness, in those parts of the World, where I have conversed for the space of
sixteen or eighteen years past. Hoping for the future to write the Heroic
Actions of this Nation in unexpugnable Characters, to leave unto Posterity (as
an eye witness) the Rehearsal of those Victories which Heaven shall bestow on
England, under Your Glorious Government; that so I may the better satisfy my
Zeal and Fidelity to Your Highness, and approve my self to be

Your Highnesses most Humble, most Obedient, most Faithful Servant, and Loyal
Subject. S. Carrington.

The Preface.
Courteous Reader,
THat which I do here intend to present you with all, is, the Life and Death of
Oliver Cromwell, late Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England; that Grand
Personage, whose Conduct and Fortune all the world does admire; and who in the
space of ten years time, did accomplish the work of a whole Age: nay more, he
perfected the work of future Ages; having settled England on such good
Foundations, that if she continues to build thereon, she may expect to produce
second Edwards, and second Henry's.

This Illustrious Personages life is presented unto you in three several
Scenes; First, you will find him Dormant, like unto David midst his Flocks,
until the Troubles of his Country awake him. And that the Almighty was
pleased to call upon him to appease them, as well as to en crease his glory,
you may reflect upon the course and progress of his valor; by which being
elevated almost to the sublimest pitch of his Grandeur, he was left to act more
absolutely according to his own prudence, and was enforced to lay hands on the
Reins of the most confused State that ever was.

Where you will find his late Highness demeaning himself like unto a well
resolved skillful Pilot in a Vessel tossed and tumbled by a tempest, bestirring
himself amidst the contrariest of Winds, and wisely and dexterously avoiding
those Rocks, Shelves, and Quicksands, which threatened England with a second
Shipwreck. This his sage conduct being the more to be admired, in that as then
he had but a limited Power, although the whole was due to his dexterity and
prudence; yet each one thought they had as great a share as himself in the
Sovereign Power, which as they supposed they had acquired by the Pen or the
Sword; either in the Army or in the Parliament: so that all this great
Politician could as then do, was to reconcile those several Opinions then in
agitation, and to suffer himself to be swayed by the current of those winds
and streams which he was neither willing nor well able to withstand at that
time.

Now as there is nothing more dangerous in States then great and sudden
changes, so nothing more difficult to be managed; and this being the
Masterpiece which a Politician has to act, this ensuing History will discover
unto us the chief and several Motions, Turnings, Windings, and Settling of the
same.

His late Highness like unto an expert Physician, was first put to read the
Temperment of England, her former way and manner of actings, before the Current
of her Humors, and the Symptoms of all the Evils and Malignities which
threatened her. He likewise reflected on the Body Politic, which he found as
well as the Humane had its Replenishments, and Evacuations, and Crisis; and
then observed that as well in the one as the other, those sudedn changes which
happen are either Destructive or Salutary. He observed that these Bodies
nourished Choler as well as other Humors; and thence deemed War to be the best
Rubarb to purge them, least otherwise they might evacuate of themselves.
Moreover, he observed these Humors were subject to grow sharp and to rebel,
and that they oftentimes caused such violent and hot fits, as that without the
assistance of an expert and accomplished Physician, death was like to ensue; or
which is worst, most violent languishing and intolerable diseases. So that the
thing which is most to be admired at in the conduct of this grand Politician,
is, that he could govern a People, and procure a perfect Union and
Tranquillity amidst three Nations, whose minds were agitated by several
Opinions, and whereby they are continually stirred against each other; no
motion transporting men more impetuously toward civil Dissentions, then those
which arise from the several Professions in Religion. For besides the chief
Religions professed in these three Nations, viz. that of Geneva, the Protestant,
the Episcopal, and some Roman Catholics, there are sprung up throughout all
England, an infinite number of other Sectaries, which like unto so many
Hidra's, did seem to issue forth from each others neck; and whereby the minds
of men were so discomposed and hurried away into such violent Enthusiasmes, as
they stood in need of a good Guide to conduct and refrain them from a total
precipitation. And as it would be a difficult task to give you the several
Denominations, Derivations, and Offsprings of all these several Schismatics, I
shall therefore pass them by as being numberless.

Wherefore, if we acknowledge as it is most assuredly true, that Religion is
the chief principal part which does most of all contribute to the well
ordering, quiet, and peaceable settling and Governing of a People; we may
easily judge that his late Highness the Lord Protector stood in need of more
then ordinary Sagacity, Prudence, and Conduct, to procure that Tranquillity,
Plenty, and Splendor to England, wherein he left it; and the which without
example, is hardly to be found in all the other parts of Europe.

But to come nearer home, to my own enterprise, the Life of an Historian is the
Life of History; and his truth the most proper Preface to it. Thus much I can
safely write for my self, that I have entertained no design beyond Truth; as I
have not made this History subservient either to Flattery or Interest: I
question not but the prejudice of some may go about to detect, but I am so
confident of my own integrity, as to believe, no person can form a truer
Relation of the late disturbed Affairs of these Nations. I acknowledge where
Originals have failed me, and must do others, I have conformed to Copies, but
of so near extraction, as that they are but once removed from their Fountain.

I being so truly acquainted, my knowledge so strongly established to trace
this History, as to discern how to write; so also for the credit of my
laborious Industry, I can affirm, That my Information was not without near
approaches, as I continually conversed with the most principal Instruments in
these admirable Transactions, persons Unbiased, that had certain and full
Intelligence of the highest emergences, whether Foreign or Domestic. If I
have been but as judicious and clear-sighted to perceive and write, as I have
been honestly unconcerned to transmit this History to posterity, I shall not
need to fear but stand secure against the most malicious, or otherwise
impertinent Imputations. Having thus discharged my Conscience in these my
honest endeavors, I have no more to write, but to bid thee read, and then
censure Impartially.

Farewell. Thine, S. C.
The Postscript.
REader,
Be pleased to take notice that this History is Translating into five other
Languages; it is in French ready for the Press: the other Translations for
other parts of the World being in such forwardness, as that they will be
speedily extant.



An Advertisement.
Courteous Reader,
BE pleased to take notice, that in the Page 195. seven lines before that never
till now published, an Incomparable Poem of the English Virgil of our times,
Mr. Edmund Waller, on General Mountague's wonderful Victory at Sea over the
Spaniards, at Sancta Cruze, that in the Printing this escaped, for shaming read
sublime: for other lesser Mistakes, the expedition of the Press may obtain thy
excuse.

THE HISTORY Of his Highness OLIVER, The late Lord-Protector, From his Cradle
to his Tomb.
The Introduction.
IF those Writers who pen the Histories of great Men, had the same advantage as
Painters have, who oblige those whom they are to Portraict, to seat themselves
in such a posture, as they may best consider and judge of them, who do choose
their Lights, and thereby discover most apparently the most delicate and
neatest feature of the Faces, which they are to represent; I might hope to give
unto the public and to Posterity a perfect Resemblance of his late Highness
the Lord Protector of England, although I should meet with a great deal of
difficulty in the well applying of the Colors, and to make choice of such
exquisire Ones to trace the Footsteps of so glorious a Life. True it is, that
the Soul is not visible, as Men's Bodies are; for as it has its Origin from
Heaven, we must of necessity ascend up thither, and enter into the Councels of
the Almighty, to observe those Lights and Inspirations which he gives unto
those persons whom his Divine Providence does make choice of to command here on
Earth, and those designs which he does frame in these great Souls, for the
increase of his Glory, and for our Peace and Tranquillity. So that our
Ignorance does oblige us herein to immitare the modesty and good behavior of
Painters, who instead of a beautiful nakedness, render it to our view wrapped up
in fine Linen, and not discovering unto us the Brain, whence the several
motions of the Body do proceed, they only set before our eyes a dumb Image
without Motion, and some few Physionomical Marks, which do help us to guess who
the party is they intend to represent unto us.

My intent is, to give you a rough Draught of this most excellent Personage,
whose Actions are so glorious and surpassingly winning in themselves, as that
we shall only need to enter upon a Relation of them, and so insensibly complete
a Natural Panegyric, much like unto those exquisite Beauties, the advantages
whereof we so much the more lessen, and detract from, by how much the more we
go about to embellish them with Ornaments and Clothing; so that the
Resplendency of my Subject it self will spare me the labor of making a long
Introduction, and the vastness of its Renown saves me the care I ought to have
taken in duly preparing the Readers Mind to conceive worthily of this my HERO,
and to have begot in them a Love and Esteem of his Person.

His late Highness was born in the Town of Huntington, the chief of the Shire,
which bears the same Name, of a Noble Parentage, being descended from the
Ancient and Illustrious Family of the Williams's, of the County of Glamorgan,
which Name in the Reign of King Henry the Eighth, was changed into that of
Cromwell, as will appear by the ensuing History. His Highness Birth and
Parentage.
His Parents left him not much Wealth, but caused him to be educated in the
University of Cambridge; where, as it is reported, a public Representation
being to be performed, he that was to represent the Kings part, falling sick,
this our Cromwell was said to have taken the Part upon Himself, and so well
employed the little time he had to get it by Heart, Lingua the Combat of the
Senses.
as it seemed, that it was Infused into him, and whereby he represented a King
with so much Grace and Majesty, as if that Estate had been natural unto him:
And truly thus much may be averred, that his Soul comprehended all those Seeds
and Foundations of such Virtues, as do usually render a Person capable to
govern others.

His excellent qualifications.
Having finished his course of Study at the University, when he had perfectly
acquired unto himself the Latin Tongue (which Language, as all men know, he
made use of to treat with Strangers) his Parents designed him to the Study of
the Civil Law, which is the Foundation of the Politics: It being very
requisite that he who was Ordained to give Law to three Kingdoms, and to the
whole Sea besides, should have a smack of the Law, and chiefly of those which
were the most Essential and Universal, for he dived not over deep into this
Study, but rather chose to run a Course in all the rest of the Sciences, and
chiefly in the Mathematics, wherein he excelled, as likewise he may be justly
said to have yielded to no Gentleman whatsoever in the knowledge of the rest of
the Arts and Sciences. But to keep more close to our History.

His Fortune and Rise did commence by those very means which by degrees
elevated him to the Supreme pitch of Grandeur; The conjuncture of Affairs
brought him on the Stage, his Valor raised him up, and the Politic part
taking the upper hand as belonging to Her by Birthright, Crowned him with all
those Blisses which both the former and latter could justly discern.

Wherefore the Disorders of England and Scotland being not possible to be
appeased without the intervening of a Parliament, there was one summoned in the
year 1641. in which the late Protector assisted in the quality of a Burgess,
for the Town of Cambridge, one of the most famous Universities of England, who
could not fail in making so good a Choice, and so worthy of such Eminent
persons as themselves, verst in all Sciences and Profound Knowledge. Things
growing past an amicable reconciliation between the King and the Parliament,
after several and infinite Treaties and Proposalls; the last Reason both of
the one and the other terminated in the loud Volleys of Canons, each Party
took the Field, The first Engagement.
and those Parliament Men who were minded to engage in the War, did with a
general consent and approbation obtain leave to suspend their Employment in
the House whereunto they were called, To maintain the Liberties of Parliament
with the points of their Swords; His late Highness was none of the last that
proferred his Service to the Parliament, and the better to witness his Passion
and Zeal to the Cause, he raised a Troop of Horse at his own costs and Charges.
The esteem he had in the House, and the value which the County of Essex put
upon his Person, obliged the Parliament to grant him a Commission to levy as
many men as he could, that so he might make up a complete Regiment: And as he
was Burgess of the Town of Cambridge, so his first care was to settle that
place for the Parliament, although he met with great Obstacles therein, and the
Reason likewise was very harsh; it being the Month of January, the very heart
of the Winter: Now you are to note, that the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge were the first of all the Towns in England which declared themselves
for the King, and the last which acknowledged the new established Authority; by
reason they were filled with persons designed to possess those Church Goods
which were in the Kings Donation, besides which the Parliament detesting their
Commissions, was resolved to reduce and reform them.

The Treasure of the University sailed on.
His late Highness having notice that all the Colleges were making a Stock and
Assembly of all their Plate, and of what ready moneys they had, to send it unto
the King, all which amounted unto a very considerabe Sum, went suddenly to
Cambridge, and seized all that Treasure just as it was ready to be sent away
unto Oxford: And as he was upon this Expedition, he signallized himself far
more by another Action; Sir Thomas Comes who was newly made Sheriff of Hertford
Shire, had received Orders from the King, to publish a Proclamation, by which
the County of Kent, and all its Adherents were proclaimed Traitors. His late
Highness. surprised him in the very Action on a Market Day, in the Town of St.
Albons, and having seized the said Knight, he sent him up to the Parliament.

And not long afterward he very oportunely assembled all the Forces of the
County of Cambridge, and exhorted the Neighboring Counties of Suffolk,
Norfolk, and Essex, to send him their Aids to oppose the Lord Capell, who was
to have been seconded by Prince Rupert, and should have seized Cambridge, and
thereby have impeded the association of the united Counties about London, which
were the only Bulwark and Defense of that great City, wherein the Sinews of War
did consist, and by whose resolutions and proceedings the rest of the Kingdom
was then governed; His Highness diligence and vigilance at that time, brake the
Neck of that Design, and forced the Lord Capell, and Prince Rupert to direct
their Thoughts another way. In the beginning of the Month of March, next
ensuing, his late Highness having completed a Regiment of Horse to the full
number of a thousand Men, marched with great diligence into the County of
Suffolk, on the advice which he had received of a great Confederacy which was
there hatching between the Nobility of the Kings Party who were assembled in a
considerable Town, called Lowerstost; whom he so unsuspectedly surprised, as
that he became Master of the place without the fiering of one Gun; He took
Prisoners Sir Thomas Barker, Sir John Pettas his Brother, Mr. Knevet, Catlines
Hammond, Cory Turrill, Preston, and above twenty other Persons of Note. He
likewise there took several parcels of Arms and Ammunition, and other
Warlike Equipages, sufficient to have armed a considerable Party, and had not
his Highness made use of his accustomed Prudence, and his usual Activity in
this Conjuncture, he had met with a great deal of difficulty on this account,
and the whole County had run a danger to have been lost: several persons of
Quality, and diverse Noble men hourly flocking to that Randezvous; This Service
was most seasonably rendered to the Parliament, and the Kings Party both in
Suffolk and Norfolk, were thereby totally disheartened and di^ncouraged.

The Spring being advanced, and the Season permitting the framing of greater
Designs, and taking of longer Marches, his Highness having well settled the
Peace and Tranquillity of the associated Counties; which (as we have said)
served as a Bulwark to the Parliament, his Mind and his Valor requiring a
space of Ground as vast as its Activity, he raised a Body of an Army and that a
very considerable one, being composed of such zealous persons as had already
been charmed with his Conduct, and being attracted by his Reputation, did
voluntarily come in unto him to serve with, and under him in the Cause of
Religion; He thus Marched into Lincolnshire, with a Resolution to assist those
Forces which lay about Newark, one of the strongest places which held out as
then for the King, into which the greatest part of the Gentry of Lincolnshire
had retired themselves, and where there was a good Garrison commanded by
Officers, who had served their Apprentiships in the Military Art beyond the
Seas; so that they fetched in vast Contributions out of the Neighboring
Counties, and made Inroads to the very Gates of Lincoln: And his Highness being
now at the Head of a Regiment of Horse, in his passage through Huntingtonshire,
was willing to deliver his Native Country from those Disorders which two
contrary Parties do usually cause and commit being in one Shire, he therefore
disarmed all those who were not affectioned to the Parliament, by which means
he so enlarged and augmented his Troops that he had gotten two thousand Men
together; and before he came near Newark, he received another re inforcement of
Horse, which was sent him by Captain Hotham, as also some other Troops which
were sent him from Lincoln: insomuch that he thus framed a sufficient
considerable Body of an Army for that time: A remarkable expedition.
He no sooner was come nigh to Newark, but that he signallized himself by an
Action which was the more glorious, by how much the less it was expected nor
foreseen; Captain Wray having so inconsideratly placed himself with his
Lincoln Horse too nigh Newark, was in the Night set upon by the Garrison,
which made a great Sally, and surrounded and took all his Men; the Alarm
coming hot to his late Highness Quarters, he forthwith repaired to the place
where the Fight was, it being then about ten of the Clock in the Night,
relieved the said Captain Wray, and took three whole Companies of the Enemy,
killed the rest on the place, and made good his Retreat by Favor of the dark
Night.

After which, having blocked up the place, he received those Sallies which were
made by the Besieged, with so much Courage and Vigilance, as that he always
came off with advantage, sometimes forcing the Enemies into their very Works,
and sometimes cutting them in pieces, insomuch that he never returned unto the
Camp but he was laden either with Prisoners, Spoils or Colors, and that he
might neglect no occasion for to give a testimony of his Prudence and Activity,
he also scouted abroad into the Country with his Horse, and near unto Grantham
he defeated a strong Party which came forth of Newark, with a handful of Men,
only since which, the World did take notice that there was somewhat more then
ordinary in the person of his late Highness: And not long after he also
defeated part of the Lord of Newcastles Army, which came to relieve Newark,
setting upon them in their Quarters betwixt Grantham and Newark, where he took
one hundred Horses, forty Prisoners, and killed several on the place. And
should I particularlize all his late Highness's memorable Actions, during these
English Civil Wars, I must of necessity compile a whole Volume thereof, since
nothing worth the taking notice of ever happened in which he was not a Sharer,
and wherein he was not always one of the foremost: wherefore I shall only
insist upon two chief Actions which were of so great Importance, that the
decision of the whole War depended thereon, and wherein the Valor of his late
Highness may justly claim the greatest, if not the sole share. Two of the
Parliaments Armies, the one commanded by the Lord Fairfax, and the other by the
Lord Manchester, being united to the Scotch Army their Confederates, Commanded
by the Earl of Livin, had jointly besieged the City of York, the Metropolis of
that County, and whereof the Earl of Newcastle was Governor for the King, who
over and above his Garrison which was very strong, had also a brave and gallant
Army, Prince Rupert was sent by the King to raise that Siege, with such
considerable Forces, as being joined to those of the Earl of Newcastle, did
well nigh equallize the Parliaments in number. The three Parliament Generals
did immediately raise the Siege to encounter Prince Rupert, and the Earl of
Newcastle, drew forth also his Forces out of the Town, and both Armies being
drawn up in Battell-Array upon Marston Moore, The Battle of Marston Moor.
they both fought with a great deal of Fury, Animosity, and hopes of Victory,
which at first seemed to incline to the Kings Part, the right Wing of the
Parliaments Forces Commanded by the Lord Fairfax, having the disadvantage of
the Ground, was overwhelmed by the left Wing of the Kings Party, who routed
and defeated it: But his late Highness (who as then was styled but a Colonel)
whose after Appellations I shall observe by degrees, which Fortune advanced him
to) who commanded the left Wing, and had not the least advantage of the Ground,
did so violently set upon the right Wing of the Kings Party, as that he brake
in pieces Prince Ruperts best Regiments, and forced them not only to give way,
but to turn their Backs, and suffering only some part of his Men to pursue the
Enemy, he with the rest made half a turn about and charged the Enemies main
Battle in the Rear so vigorously, as that putting Life again into the Lord
Fairfax's Soldiers, he constrained them to face about, and thereby so well
restored the Success of the Battle, as that he obtained and Entire and
complete Victory. Two Generals of the Enemies, and some of the best mounted of
their Officers only making their escapes by their Horses good heels; and this
Battle was accounted the greatest that ever was fought during these last Wars.

His Highness admirable management of the Bartell at Nazeby.
The same thing likewise happened in the famous Battle of Naseby, near unto
Northampton; when as his late Highness ariving in the Camp but on the Evening
before the Fight, gave such encouragement and joy to the whole Army, by reason
of his so sudden and unexpected Arivall from so great a distance of place, as
that it presaged an undoubted Victory. The left Wing of the Parliaments Army
was quite over borne; General Ireton his late Highness Son-in-Law, and who
afterward governed Ireland in the Quality of Lord Deputy, with as much Prudence
and Conduct as he showed Valor and Deserts to merit so considerable an
Employment, being the second Person of the Commonwealth, was carried off from
the Field by two Wounds he received, and was taken Prisoner, but was relieved
again, and Prince Rupert pursued his Victory with as much vigor and hopes to
gain the Battle, as if the day had been his own: But his late Highness on his
side defeating that Wing which was oposite to him, charged them with such force
and Courage, as that he made the Victory dubious, and so it continued for a
good while, neither inclining to the one side, not the other, till at last the
Kings Horse falling a running, left their Foot to shift for themselves, which
were all cut in pieces and taken Prisoners, all the Canon and Baggage was
likewise taken, of a considerable value; there was also found a Cabinet of the
Kings with his Papers of great Importance: The royal Standard, and one hundred
Colors beside were brought off, and his late Highness having pursed the Kings
Horse as long as he listed, at length returned to the Camp with a great number
of Prisoners. Should I go about to number up the several places of consequence
which this Conqueror has taken, either by force or by Capitulations, I should
fill up a whole Volume with the Names of Towns and Fortresses alone, besides
intending hereby only to give you a Perspective of his glorious Life: I will
only instance in those worthy Actions of his, whereby the Fortunes of the Wars
did decide the possession of three Kingdoms.

The Victory of Preston in Lancashire.
Nor may we omit to reckon amongst the rest of his Heroic Achievements, the
Victory which he obtained by Preston in Lancashire, over Duke Hamilton, and Sir
Marmaduke Langdale, whose united Forces amounted unto 25000, his late Higness
having not above 10000 at most, notwithstanding which inequallity of Forces he
gave them Battle, and entirely routed that puissant Army, killing 3000 Scotch
upon the place, and taking 9000 Prisoners, chasing the remaining Forces to
Warrington about 20 Miles from the place where the Battle was fought, and
taking Duke Hamilton Prisoner, at a place called Vttoxeter, whither he was
retired with 3000 Horse, as also Sir Marmaduke Langdale, the one by my Lord
Gray, and Colonel White, and the other by Captain Widmonpoole, so that but few
Scotch returned to their own Country, to carry back the News of so prodigious a
Defeat.

NO sooner were the Civil Wars of England terminated by the discomsiture of
all the Kings Armies, the taking of his own Person, and by his death, but the
Parliament by a solemn Vote and Ordinance, changed the Monarchiall Government
into a Commonwealth. The Monarchiall Government changed into a Common Wealth.
The Kingdom of Ireland was the first that witnessed a discontent of this
Change, and all the several Parties there uniting themselves on the News of
this Change, they owned the late Kings Son, and joined all their Forces against
the Interest of the Commonwealth, and on a sudden became so powerful and
formidable, as that the chief Places in those Parts submitted to their
obedience, Dublin only, and London Derry excepted, the first whereof was
immediately besieged by an Army of 22000 Men, Commanded by the Marquis of
Ormond, and the other by a considerable Party, the Natives of the Country. The
Royallists were as yet in possession of the Isles of Jersey and Man, which
places although they were adjacent unto England, yet they only stood them in
stead for a retreat to some Ships, which robbed up and down the Seas in those
Parts: Nor were the Irish Businesses there arrived at the height of perfection,
whereas they began to decline: Forces sent into Ireland.
for 3000 Horse and Foot which the Parliament sent into Ireland, as the
forerunner only of a more considerable Body being safely landed at Dublin,
joined themselves unto the Garrison, and unto the rest of the Forces which could
be got together in a Body, which in all amounted not unto above 9000 Men, and
who jointly made so general and vigorous a Sally upon the Marquis of Ormond
(which Sally was so well ordered by the Prudence of Colonel Michael Jones, and
so well encouraged and led on by his Prudence and Valor together) as that they
forced the Marquis to quit the Siege, and so well prosecuted the point of their
Victory, as that they cut all the said Marquises Troops in pieces, who with
much ado saved himself; there were slain in the Combat and pursuit about 2000
Men, as many were taken Prisoners, and all the Ammunition of War, with the
Baggage and Ordnance were likewise left behind as a Prey to the Besieged.
General Cromwell goes for Ireland, and arrives there in August, 1649.


And the better to advance this general Defeat, and to cause these puissant
Confederates the sooner to run into their Ruin, who a little before promised
themselves no less then the Conquest of the three Kingdoms; Oliver Cromwell
being by the Commonwealth nominated Governor of Ireland, took footing at
Dublin with an Army furnished with all Necessaries requisite toward the
Crowning of an Undertaking, which already had so happy and successful a
beginning.

But General Cromwell having in vain sought for the Enemies, who by these
addition all Forces were forced to take Sanctuary in the best places and
Fortresses of the Country, at length besieged Drogedah, Drogedah in Ireland
besieged.
one of the best and considerablest places in all Ireland, defended by so
strong a Garrison as it might well have framed a little Army, and was commanded
by such Officers as had been signallized beyond the Seas, whose numbers were so
exceeding great, as that several of them bare Arms only as private Soldiers.
There was no time spent in the framing of a Siege, or in the opening of
Approaches, but each one minded the beating of the Iron whilst it was hot, and
concluded that the Confederates ought not to be suffered to rally themselves,
nor to unite in a Body again, wherefore a slight Breach being made, the Orders
were given out for a general Assault, but the Walls were lined with so many
and so good Men chiefly in those places where the Assault was to be given, as
that the solidst and gravest Officers of the Army did represent unto his
Excellency the General, that there was no appearance at all to carry the place
by force, but that it would be better to tire and weary out the besieged by the
length of a siege, during which the breach might be made the larger. But
General Cromwell, whose prudence (as we have already observed) seconded his
valor, did briskly answer them that he would go and open the breach for them,
and placing himself at the head of his Troops, caused the assault to be given,
rendering this example of wisdom to all great Personages, that in Actions of
important consequence neither Age, nor great Commands, or high Preferments,
ought to hinder a General to be the first man to go on upon an assault, since
it must render them the most considerable, and raise them up to the highest
pitch of honor and esteem.

Finally, after a sharp and bloody contest hand to hand, most obstinately
maintained on all sides, the English forced their entrance, and the General
went into the place pell mell with his Soldiers, at which time the ardour and
heat of the victory did appear to correspond with his prudence, for though his
generosity did oblige him to give quarter to those who had so well defended
themselves, notwithstanding, deeming it fitting to make that place an example
of terror unto the rest of the Towns which were garrisoned, and which might
cost him too dear should they stand out as sturdily and obstinately as these
did, he caused all those to be put to the sword who were found to be in Arms,
and thus he sacrificed 3000 Irish unto the Ghosts of 10000 English whom they
had massacred some years before. The taking of this place was followed by the
surrender of several others, fear causing the weakest to yield, but those which
were able to defend themselves were sold at dear rates. Trin, Dundalke, Nury,
Wexford, R^ne, Bandonbridge and Kingsale were subdued, this last being a very
considerable passage, so likewise were several other places taken by the
respective Commanders of the Commonwealth, at the self same time in the other
parts of Ireland, and several parties of the Enemies field-Forces were likewise
defeated by Sir Charles Coot, Colonel Venables and Jones, and the Lord
Broghill, each of them signalizing themselves according to their accustomed
valors, and the Lord Broghill having since made it appear in the managing of
States affairs that he is as great a Politician as a Soldier. One would have
imagined that the impetrous course of these victories should absolutely have
quelled and abated the courage of the Irish, or that force and might would soon
have reduced them to terms of reason, but they held out for a long time
together in unaccessable places, in Woods and Bogges, over which none but the
Natives both Horse and Men can pass without perishing, which does manifest
unto us, that the Conquest of that Island is not so easy at present, as it was
formerly when Henry the second of England reduced it in one Winter, which, as
certain Writers say, is almost incredible. That so populous a Nation, so hardy,
so well disciplined, so active and dexterous, should not so much as lift up a
hand to defend themselves: But as the same writer says, it is apparent that
they were not accustomed to our manner or ways of warring, nor to defend
themselves against such kind of weapons as were then used; however, if the
Conquest was easy, the preservation was not found to be so, and cost far
dearer. True it is, that this last Conquest of that Nation was not so suddenly
archieved, but those means which have been used to assure and preserve it, will
give occasion unto our nephews, -- that this present age has much profited by
the faults and omissions of our Ancestors. Moreover, that fire which the Civil
Wars had kindled: in the Britannick Islands, was so violent, as that all the
Sea which separates the Old World from the New, was not capable to hinder the
Communication thereof even to their Colonies in America, for Virginia and the
Carybde Islands refused to acknowledge the power of the Commonwealth, all
those who inclined thereunto were either banished or executed, and despoyled of
their goods, and however those Collonies could not subsist but by the Commerce
of England, and that this Revolt did bring along with it their ruin, yet their
obstinacy was such, as that they would neither yield to their own Interest nor
Reason. Till at length the Commonwealth sent a Fleet thither, under the
Command of Sir George Askue, who delivered them out of their miseries, by
ranging them under the obedience of the Parliament. Meanwhile the Royallists
Forces were very considerable at Sea, for Prince Rupert had a Fleet of nine
great Ships which served to shelter several other small ones, whereby the trade
of England was much impeded and incommodated, which obliged the Parliament to
put forth a most puissant Naval Army to Sea, fitted with good Mariners, and all
kind of necessary warlike Ammunitions. The sole brute of this Fleet made all
the Enemies Ships to run into their several skulking holes like unto so many
Conies, and Prince Rupert being not strong enough to encounter them, was forced
to retire into Kingsale Haven in Ireland, where he was immediately blocked up
by the Parliaments Fleet, whilst General Cromwell besieged both the Port and
Town by land, and Prince Rupert being forced to make a virtue of necessity,
resolved to bear the brunt of all the English Fleet, and so saved himself,
leaving behind him three Ships, which by that occasion were taken, and finally
after several turnings and turmoilings, be cast anchor at Lisbone, where he was
protected by the King of Portugal, which caused the rupture betwixt this
Commonwealth and that Crown, and all those mischiefs which ensued, as we
hereafter shall rehearse.

Meanwhile the Royallists in Scotland seeing the Parliament was busied in
Ireland, thought to lay hold on a fit opportunity to play their game, and to
that purpose the Earl of Montrosse having landed in the North of Scotland,
with some Forces he had raised in Holland and other parts, assembled the old
Soldiers who had formerly served under him, and armed them with such Arms as
he had brought from Holland, but before he could make a considerable body, he
was defeated by the Presbyter Forces, taken, and hanged on a very high Gibbet,
which is the last mark of infamy in that Country.

Within a while after, there was a Treaty commenced at Breda, between the Scots
and their King, to install and re-establish him in that Kingdom, and in the
others, according as Fortune should answer their designs and expectations; and
to this end, they deputed Ambassadors into Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden,
Russia, and into Turkey, and finally throughout all Europe, to demand relief,
aid and assistance: But all their Embassies procured neither men nor money,
only their Ambassadors were laden with Complements and good wishes in return,
each others particular affairs not permitting them to do more.

All which gave unto the Commonwealth of England, not any great fears, but
great jealousies, wherefore the better to be informed of the passages abroad,
and the better to fortify themselves by foraign Leagues and Alliances, M.
Dorislaus a person full of knowledge and conduct, was sent in the quality of an
Agent toward the States of the United Provinces, the chief drift of this
Negotiation being to criment a good and firm understanding between the two
Commonwealths: But scarce was he arrived at the Hague, when five or six
disguised persons entered forcibly into his Chamber and massacred him. And
whilst it seemed all things were a profound Calm in England, or that at least
the course of the Enemies designs both at home and abroad, being sufficiently
known to the State, on a sudden there sprang up the most formidable faction
that ever was hatched since these last Wars: A certain number of persons who
called themselves Levellers, whose pretenses were to render all men's goods and
possessions alike, and truly this was a very plausible design, and might
doubtless have met with as many Abetters as there are men in the world, who
have no other possessions or Revenues, but their good wills to obtain them.

The chief of these Levellers was one John Lilborn, a man of a dating and
attempting spirit, who could not remain quiet, but was altogether invincible,
not to be moved by threats nor gained by the favor or presents of fortune,
which were beneath the extent of his ambition, and a considerable part of the
Army siding with their Leader, they augmented in numbers as fast as the
shortness of the time would permit, the confluence of such men as flattered
themselves with such fond hopes, and who promised themselves a revenge, and and
establishment by a second Revolution and change. But before all those who
intended to have sided with them could come up to them and unite in one body,
they were vigorously set upon by the Lord Fairfax, at that time the
Commonwealths General, who defeated them at a place called Burford in the
County of Oxford, where their Leader and the best part of his Soldiers were
taken, some of which were put to death for example sake, and some others were
banished, but the greatest part were pardoned, and admitted into favor again.

As for their Leader John Lilborne being brought up to London, he appeared
before the chief Officers and Judges of London and Westminster, the Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and diverse others, where he was not only accused of diverse Martial
Crimes, but also Politic ones, as having been the Author of several scandalous
and defamatory. Libells against the State, which tended to render the
Government odious, and to beget a Mutiny in the people; however, he so
dexterously shifted himself of all these accusations, as that the Judges
declared him Not guilty. Much about that very time Mr. Anthony Ascham a most
judicious and accomplished Gentleman, was Deputed, and sent over in the quality
of an Agent to the King of Spain, and arrived at the Port of Sancta Maria, on
the 5. of June, 1650. where being advertised but his person was in danger, he
was constrained to cause himself to be guarded to Madrid, where the next day
after his arrival, as he was at Dinner, six men knocked at his Chamber door,
which was immediately opened unto them, and he rising from the Table to receive
them, the first of the said parties stabbed him in the head with a Dagger, so
that he fell down dead to the ground, and his Interpreter Signior Riba being
not able to make his escape soon enough, was likewise stabbed in the belly;
which being thus done, the Murderers would have saved themselves in the
Venetian Ambassadors house, who refused them protection, whence they retired
themselves into a Church, which in Spain is a Sanctuary which the Justice ought
not to violate, whence however the King of Spain had them taken, and put into
prison, one only excepted, who made an escape. Hence there arose a great
contest betwixt the King and the Clergy, who complained that their privileges
had been infringed, and demanded that the Prisoners might be returned unto
them: and on the other side, the Parliament of England pressed hard to have
justice done on them, and though message upon message, instance upon instance
were used therein, yet they took no effect. And lest it may seem that all these
foraign Negotiations which we have here inserted, may be beyond my subject,
however if they be considered as so many obstacles which Fortune opposed unto
the virtue and greatness of his late Highness, you will find that the recital
of them will not be altogether useless, the rather since I have related them
as succinctly as possibly: Besides, we may also look upon them as so many seeds
sown, to beget those wars which thereon ensued, and which were by the late
Protector, rather by most glorious Treaties whereunto he was sought, or by most
signal Victories which were obtained, and brought to a happy period, by which
the blood of these two Agents, so cruelly murdered, were retaliated with use.
But to go on to our History, the Treaty of Breda being absolutely concluded,
and notwithstanding the great Antipathy and animosity between the Royallists
and the Presbyterians, all their jealousies and grudges were seemingly
reconcised, so that the Scotch wanted nothing to complete their design, but to
enjoy their Kings preserce, who immediately coming to the Hague, went thence
for Schevelinge, and embarked himself for Scotland notwithstanding the dangers
and perils of the Sea, which were very great, and the English Ships which had
waylaid him to surprise him. As soon as he was landed in Scotland, the first
thing they propounded unto their King was to take the solemn Oath, called the
Covenant, that burning Torch which the Mother of Paris did see in her frenzies,
that fatal fire which the Scotch believe descended from Heaven, and by which
they at their pleasures kindle those wars wherewith they infest England,
which Covenant as we know was only a superstitious and warlike Prorestation
made in the presence of God and Men: To maintain the purity of the Religion, to
preserve the privileges of Parliament, and the people, and to re-establish the
King in his Ancestors Throne.

But that which seemed somewhat harsh and rude to this Prince, was the terms
wherein they caused him to take this Oath, quite contrary to Physicians, who
dip their Pills in Syrrops or Sugar, to make them down the glibber, yet these
Politicians when the whole lay at the stake, it seems, troubled themselves not
much with the wording of the thing; for amongst real friends indeed, there
needs not many complements nor much complacence to be used. Therefore the
Churches of Scotland made their King swallow this restorative in the following
Beverage, constraining him to protest, That he renounced the sins of his
Fathers and his own house, the Idolatry of his Mothers, and that he would
adhere unto Gods cause in conformity to the Covenant, in the firm establishment
of the Church Government, as it was expressed in the Directory, for that
public worship which is to be rendered to God, contained in the Belief and
Catechism: And this Cup he was forced to drink, that he might obtain his
Fathers Kingdom, which formalities were more then requisite for to establish
that Prince in the opinion of the prevailing party, which was only then in a
condition to help him. The Commonwealth prepares to war against the Scots.
Howbeit the English knew very well to distinguish between these Artificial
fictions, and the truth, for the Parliament of England being duly informed of
the Scots, their designs and practices, thought it was high time to think of
the best means to oppose them, and after several consultations upon this
business, it was resolved that the Lord Fairfax should command the Army in
chief, and with all speed march toward the North of England. But he most humbly
thanked the Parliament, and like unto a second Cincinatus, retired himself from
the Dictatorship to a Countrey-life, excusing himself for not serving them in
that Expedition, upon his Indisposition at that time. His late Highness made
Generalissimo of the Commonwealths Armies.
The Renown of General Cromwells feats of Arms, both as Governor and Conqueror
of Ireland, admitted of no less Proposals, then to make him Generalissimo of
the Commonwealths Armies, in the Lord Fairfax his stead: So that he came over
again into England, whilst his hands were as yet warm, and was sent to give a
check unto other Enemies in another Climate, and under another disguise, after
he had settled and assured all the Conquests of Ireland, and had left the
necessary and requisite Orders, conducing to a solid peace and establishment of
those parts, with his sonne-in-Law Henry Ireton, so that he returned thence
laden with Palms and Laurels, as Trophies of his worthy Acts in those parts.
And scarce was he returned home, but he was enforced to march toward those
parts, whither the glory of Conquering a second Kingdom called upon him. Now
the Scots, who by no means would make any outward show of the grand designs
which they were hatching, at the approach of the English Army on their
Frontiers, seemed to be very much astonished, and the whole Country took the
Allarum, moreover, the better to color this their astonishment and seeming
surprizal, they deputed a Messenger to Sir Arthur Haslerigge, as then Governor
of Newcastle, upon the Borders of England and Scotland, to know the reason of
that so sudden March of the English Army toward their Frontiers, whereunto
they joined several Manifesto's, setting forth the Contents of the Leagues and
ample Treaties of union between the two Nations, and several other particulars,
which served only to gain time, and to make the better preparations to receive
their Enemies. At the same time of the English Armies advance toward the
North, the Parliament set forth a Manifest accompanied by another from the
General, and chief Officers of the Army, whereby both the one and the others
declared, viz. A Manifest concerning the Scotch war.
That the reasons which moved them to this great undertaking, was neither the
support which they expected from the Arm of flesh, nor the consideration or
vanity of former successes, not the desire they had to compass any of their
own designs; But the true assurance they had, that their cause was just before
God; reflecting on the foregoing Revolutions, and the success which had
followed them, not as the handiwork of Politic men, or of Humane force, but
as the most eminent works of Providence, and the power of God, thereby to make
his good will appear, and to show his pleasure concerning those things which he
had decreed in this world: That they were obliged, not to betray the cause
wherein God had so evidently manifested himself, after which there was nothing
more dear unto them then the preservation of those who feared the Lord, and who
might greatly suffer either by being mistaken, or by not being capable to
discern the true tie of a General Calamity, of which their Christian charity
they hoped they had given sufficient proofs, at the last time, when they were
in Scotland with this very Army, of which God was pleased to make use, for to
break in pieces the power of those who oppressed the faithful in those parts.
But that the acknowledgements of so signal a favor, did but little appear in
the Engagement which they had lately made with their new King, and that they
had not proceeded like unto good Christians, in publishing that their Army was
but an Army of Sectaries: However, that they doubted not, but that God would
give them the grace to forgive them that calumny, and to that effect they
beseeched him to be so good unto them, as to separate the Chafe from the good
Corn, concluding in like manner as they had begun by a most solemn and terrible
Imprecation, beseeching that in testimony of the truth of all these
particulars, the great God of Heaven, through his infinite mercy pardoning
their failings and weaknesses, would judge betwixt them when they should come
to join in battle with their Enemies. This Manifesto was sent from the Generals
quarters, as then at Barwick, to the Metropolitan of Scotland, by a Trumpet,
whose eyes the Scots did blind both going and coming. Meanwhile the Army
advanced as far as the Lord Mordingtons Castle, on the 22 of July, 1650. and
refreshed there three days, on the 25. they advanced toward Copperspeth, and
the 26. they arrived at Dunban where the Army received those Ammunitions
wherewith such Ships were laden, as were come thither on purpose to observe the
motions of the Army, by reason that the Peasants had abandoned their dwellings,
not leaving so much as any thing which might serve for refreshing. The Army
being somewhat refreshed at Dunbar, marched toward Haddington, and the next day
understood, that the Enemies were disposed to give them battle on a Heath
called Gladsmore, so that the English endeavored to possess themselves of the
place. But the Scots appeared not, whereupon it was resolved, that Major
General Lambert, and Colonel Whalley persons of an approved valor (and who
have since proved themselves as great Politicians as they were great
Commanders) should with 1400. Horse advance toward Muscleborough, to endeavor
if possible to draw forth the Enemy, and to engage him to fight, whilst the
rest of the Army marched up unto them, whereupon there happened some slight
skirmishes, but the Scots would not by any means be engaged in a general
Combat, so that the English that night encamped hard by Muscleborough, from
whence the Scots were but four miles distant, defended by a brest-work which
they had drawn from Edinborough to Leith, and which was well nigh flanked all
the way by the Canon of the last place, so that they were possessed of a very
advantageous Port. The English being approached unto Muscleborough with a
resolution to have set upon the Enemy in their works, found that it was a
difficult matter to force their Line, and so were constrained to set down their
Camp hard by that place all the day, to discover the countenance of the Enemy:
But the desire they had to fight was somewhat abated by a great shower of rain,
which continued all the day, and which did much incommodate them, by reason
they had no shelter at all. On the 30. finding that they were put to it for
want of Victuals, and the ground being so thoroughly soaked by the rain, as that
it was far more difficult to attempt the Enemy then before, the English
retired to their former quarters; which begat heart in the Scots, who fallyed
out of their Lines, and fell so fiercely upon the Rearguard of the English, as
that they put them into a kind of disorder, but some Squadrons of Horse
fronting in the Rear, and making good the ground, assured the March of the
foot, and so vigorously continued their charge, as that they had like to have
brought the business to a general Combat; had not the Commander in chief of
the Scots Army caused a retreat to be sounded, that so they might bring their
men into their Lines again, whither the English pursued them, fighting all the
way with their Cavallry. In this Encounter, Major General Lambert engaged so
far, as that he was hurt in the Arm with a Lance, and received another wound
in the body, and once he was taken prisoner, but was rescued again by
Lieutenant Empson of the Generals Regiment, there were but few English killed,
but far more of the Scotch, and amongst them some persons of quality, several
prisoners of theirs were also taken, as a Lieutenant Colonel, a Major, and some
Captains. By which means the English recovered Muscleborough that night without
being molested by the Enemy, but they were so disheartened for want of sleep,
and so tired by the dirty slabbery ways, as that misdoubting least the enemy
being aware thereof might give them an Alarm, that night they stood upon their
guard, and accordingly they failed not betwixt three and four of the clock in
the Morning, with fifteen Companies of choice Horse, commanded by Major General
Montgomery, and Colonel Straughton, to fall into the English quarters with
such a vehemence as that they bare down the Guards, and put a whole Regiment of
Horse in disorder, whereby the whole Army taking the Alarm, the English
charged them so home as that they put them into a rout, and pursued them within
half a League of Edinbourgh, killing them a sufficient number both of Officers
and Soldiers, and taking several prisoners: After which, the Scots being
disgusted at these their ill successes, retired themselves for a while within
their intrenchments, where we shall also leave them to their closer guards. In
the meanwhile the Parliament interdicted the Commerce between England and
Scotland, and caused their Ships to be adjudged good Prize, which contributed
very much to their undoing and ruin: During which they wanted for no
Partisanes in England, who labored to dispose things toward the effecting of
their grand design, and amongst their chief Agitators, Colonel Eusebius
Andrews being discovered and convinced, was also condemned and beheaded on
Tower Hill.

The whole Month of August passed almost away without any action in Scotland,
toward the latter end whereof, Collington and Readhall were taken by attempt,
where the Lord Hamilton and Major Hamilton were taken, with 60. Soldiers, 60.
Barrels of Powder, Arms for 60 men, and a considerable quantity of Victuals,
and other good Booty, all which happened on the 24 of August.

After which the whole Body of the English Army quitted the Mountains of
Pencland, and encamped about Collington and Readhall, and the parts adjacent
within one Mile of the Scotch Army; on the seven and twentieth both Armies
marched Flank to Flank, being only separated by a little Quagmire or
Marsh-ground, which hindered their Conjuction, however the Canon played upon
each other, and on the 28th the English Canon plied the Scots hard, and
endamaged them very much, notwithstanding they neither quitted their Ground,
nor would they come to a Resolution to join in a closer Fight. And the English
having consumed all their Provisions of Victuals, retired unto their former
Quarters, first unto Pencland Hills, and afterward unto Mussleborough whither
they had much ado to reach, where being some what refreshed, they dreyned their
Garrisons, assembled also their Forces, and took their March toward Hoddington,
at which the Scots coasting their March on their right Wing, did charge them
with a Squadron of stout Men, and as they did most briskly set upon the
English, so they were in like manner vigorously repulst by a Regiment of Foot
commanded by Colonel Fairfax: On the first day of September both Armies found
themselves only separated by the Town and the Scots, being encamped in an
advantageous place, on the West Side of the Town the English were engaged to
encamp themselves on the East Side of the Town, in an open Field, very fit to
give Battle in, without that either Party would give or take advantage of the
Ground, where the English having attended the Enemies a sufficient space of
time, and perceiving that they would not fight but upon an advantage, they took
their March toward Dunbar, whither the Scots followed them immediately, and at
a certain passage endeavored to charge their Rearguard; But the English
immediately facing about, the Scots changed their resolution and gained the
Hills, where they thought they might with advantage cut off the English their
passage to Coperspeth: at which time the English Army was but in a very ill
Condition, the Winter which begins betimes in those parts had so nipt them with
Colds and great Rains, and the ill Victuals which they had besides, caused a
great deal of sickness in the Army, Fluxes, Looseness, and other Diseases,
whereby many died, and were rendered incapable of Service, being sent and
carried away to Barwick, and the adjoining parts.

The Scots who very well knew the sad estate of the English Army, which they
had really blocked up at the passage of Copperspeth, which is betwixt Dunbar
and Barwick, thereby impeding the English's Communication with that place, and
by hindering them from those Conveniences which they thence received, intending
either to overcome them there, or to cause them to perish there for want of
Necessaries, so that they promised themselves an unquestionable Victory without
much loss on their sides, whereby they presumed to brag that they had gotten the
English in the Earl of Essex's Pensold, alluding to that extremity whereunto
the Royallists had reduced that Earl in the County of Cornwall. where his Army
surrendered at discretion (the Horse only excepted, who made their way through
the Enemy in the Nightime.) Nor were the Scots their hopes ill grounded,
considering the ill plight wherein the English Army was at that time, and the
inequality of their Forces, the Scots being at the least 20000 Men, and the
English not above 12000, diverse of which were likewise sick: But the extremity
whereunto the English were reduced, made them pitch upon so firm a resolution,
either to overcome, or to die in the Battle, as that the Scots were totally
routed and defeated, by those very reasons, and that very confidence which had
made them as it were sure of the Victory. The B^^te^ of Dunia gainte by the
English
Wherefore the General, and the chief Officers of the English Army, deeming that
the longer they should delay, to put it to a noble adventure, whereby to get
out of this great straight wherein they were, the less they should be able to
compass it, resolved either to make their passage through their Enemies by the
points of their Swords, or to perish in the undertaking; So that they employed
the whole Night in seeking of the Lord, and imploring his Assistance from
Heaven, as also in giving out and distributing the Orders requisite for the
Fight, and just at break of the day, the Army was ready drawn up into
Battel-aray, and to give the onset; the English word was, The Lord of Hoastes:
and the Scots word was, The Covenant, which did very well represent the state
of their Affairs, and the subject of their Quarrel, and in an instant both the
English Horse and Foot, with a gallant resolution, fiercely charged the right
Wing of the Scots, where the Enemy had placed all their Cavalry, on purpose to
hinder the English in their passage that way. The Scots received their Charge
with a great deal of constancy and resolution, and it may justly be said, That
Alexander did not meet with more resistance, nor glory at the passage of
Granicia, then our late Protector met with at this Encounter; especially if so
be we consider, how that the said Conqueror of Asia had to do with an
effeminate kind of People, bred in a delicious Country, accustomed to their
ease and pleasures; but here on the contrary, That the English brought up in a
fertile abundant Soil, and under a middle Climate, should come to confront a
Warlike Nation in a harsh, barren, and cold Climat. The General's own Regiment
of Foot had the Vanguard that day, and performed the parts of men, answering
most gloriously to that honor which belonged to them: Their Colonel and
General together animating and encouraging them by his own example, witnessed
by his Actions, that there was not a straws breadth that day betwixt them and
death or the Victory: Major General Whaley charged the Enemies whole Army
through and through, with his Regiment; bearing down all those who durst
withstand him, and without the loss of many men; having wheeled about again,
and cleared all before him, regained his former station himself, having only
received a slight Wound in the Arm, and had a Horse killed under him. And not
to detain the Reader in any further suspense, all the Regiments of the Army
performing their parts, like resolute gallant men, (For should a man go about
to praise one Squadron or Battallion of them in particular, he must of
necessity derogate from the rest) you might have observed as many Soldiers as
Officers, and as many Officers as Soldiers, who being all of them animated, or
rather inspired by a supernatural instinct of Valor, a man would have thought
they had been invulnerable, or shot-free, and that a Hand from on high did
defend them from the showers of Lead and Lances, which were ready to
overwhelme them, so that the violence and force wherewith they fought, did only
permit the Scots to put by their Blows, as also it is worthy to be noted that
in all this Fight the English lost but forty men, whereas of the Scots there
were four thousand killed upon the place, and that Army which was stronger
then the English by two thirds, thinking to have overwhelmed them, did only by
closing in upon them, force them to fight with the greater vigor; and you
would have imagined, that the little Army of the English consisted only of one
Body, which had but one only motion, and charged the Enemy on all sides with so
much Impetuosity and Animosity, as that you would have said it had been and
insensible Mass, or Lump which only pressed forwards, where the weight of Arms,
or the force of Powder did transport it. Finally, after one whole hours
dispute, very hot Fight, and violent furious Contests, the Scots gave way, and
their Horse being put to flight, endeavored to save themselves by the goodness
of their heels, the English Cavalry pursuing them to Haddington, all the Scotch
Foot remained on the place, and that which rendered the slaughter of them the
greater was, that the English Soldiers remembered an Action which happened the day
before, in which thirty Soldiers of Colonel Prides Regiment being commanded to
possess a House situate betwixt both Camps, and not being seconded, were
over-powred by a greater number of the Scots, and so forced to deliver up the
place again, notwithstanding which, after they had promised quarter to the
English, they killed three of them, and hurt all the rest: There was no English
Soldiers but had a Prisoner in this Battle, there being taken ten thousand,
most of all which, except the Officers, were suffered to steal away, amidst
which there was ten Colonels, twelve Lieutenant Colonels, nine Majors, forty
seven Captains, seventy two Livetenants, and eighty Ensigns, and amongst the
Prisoners of Quality, there was the Lord Libberton, and his Son, the Lord
Cranstone, Sir James Lundsdale, Livetenant General of the Foot, and Sir
Pickerten Adjutant General, all their Baggage and Canon was taken, to the
number of two and twenty great Guns, and several lesser ones, two hundred
Colors, and Arms for 15000 Men; of the English there was but one Officer
killed, and Major Rooksby, who afterward died of his Wounds, as also Captain
Sloyd of the Lord Fleetwoods Regiment, dangerously wounded. His late Highness
obtained this memorable Victory on the third day of September, 1650, on which
day he also obtained another no less famous then this: And on this very day God
crowned his Labors with a peaceful and resolved quiet death, whereby he no
less triumphed over the World, and the rage of Hell, then he did in this last
Battle we have related, over a most puissant raging Enemy; at which time his
Army, as a man may say (brought low by Want, and Sicknesses) was even Bedrid,
and at deaths very Door. And as the Parliament of England had caused a day of
universal Prayers and Fastings to be kept for the good success of their Army
in Scotland, so likewise did they order a day of general Thansgiving for this
so notable and famous Victory: and the General likewise on his part did not
fail with the whole Army, to acknowledge the good handy work of God, who had
so visibly gained him and them this Battle: And the better to prosecute the
said Victory, and Lies taken.
to reap the fruits thereof, On the seventh day of September, four Regiments of
Foot were sent to possess Lies, a very considerable and advantageous place,
where seven and thirty piece of Ordnance were found mounted on Plat-forms, and
a considerable quantity both of Ammunitions of War and Provisions of Victuals.
And on the same day his late Highness became Master of the City of Edinbrough,
the Metropolitan of all Scotland, and caused his whole Army to march into it,
without any loss, save the Arm of one Soldier, which was shot off by a
Canon-bullet from the Castle. Edinbor^ugh taken.
And on the next Lord's Day he sent a Trumpeter to the Castle, to give notice to
such Ministers as had abandoned their Pulpits, to come and perform their Duties
in their said Callings, which they having refused to do, he caused English
Ministers to Officiate in their places; in the mean while, all possible
diligence was used in the Fortifying of Lies, it being concluded to be the
best and most commodious sheltring-place the English could have in Scotland,
for the Winter Season. And after his late Highness had by sound of Trumpet,
both at Lies and Edinbrough, caused the freedom of Traffic, and liberty of
Trade to be published and established, a sure way for the public Markets,
himself on the fourteenth marched toward Nethrife, six miles from Edinbrough,
leaving Major General Overton with his Brigade in Edinborough. On the fifteenth
the Army adadvanced toward Linlithgo, but by reason of the ill Weather they
could not pass on forward; On the sixteenth, they marched toward Falkirk, and
the next day they came up within one mile of Sterling; On the eighteenth, the
Council of War being assembled, a Letter was drawn up to be sent thither, by
which the tenderness and affection of the English toward the Scotch Nation was
represented, alleging that though formerly it had not taken its desired
effects; Notwithstanding, seeing that at present the Fortune and Success of
Arms had been so contrary to them, they desired them to reflect on those
Proposals which had been formerly made unto them, and to surrender that place
unto them, for the use of the Commonwealth of England, and a Trumpeter being
sent with the aforesaid Letter, who coming up almost to the VValls, met with a
Gentleman on foot, with a Pike in his hand, who told him he should not be
suffered to come into the place, and that his Letter should in like manner not
be received: In the Afternoon that very day, those of the Town sent a Trumpeter
to demand the Prisoners, with a proffer to pay their Ransoms; To whom the
General made answer, That they were not come into Scotland to trade in Men, nor
to enrich themselves, but to do Service to the Commonwealth of England, and to
settle and establish those Dominions. On the same day, Orders were issued to
draw up the whole Army to the very VValls of the Town, and by setting scaling
Ladders to the place, to give a general Assault, but after it was found that
there was but a little appearance to effect the same, in regard of the good
Condition the Place and Garrison was in, they changed their resolution, and on
the nineteenth the Army retired to Linlithgow, which was accounted a very fit
place to make a Garrison of, whereby both Sterling and Edinborough might be
bridled and curbed, and the necessary Orders for the fortifying of the place
being given, there were five Troops of Horse left in Garrison, and six Companies
of Foot, and the Body of the Army returned to Edinborough, where on the twenty
third of September, there was a day of Humiliation celebrated and solemnly kept.

And much about the same time the Churches of Scotland likewise ordered a
solemn Festival for the ensuing Reasons; Viz.

I. To humble themselves before God, and to crave his pardon for having too
much relied on the Arm of Flesh. II. For the wickedness and profaneness of
their Armies. III. For the Spoils and other Misdemeanors their Soldiers had
committed in England. IV. For having not sufficiently purged their Armies; that
is to say, For not having put out such persons as were not godly, and of their
Belief. V. For the indirect and sinister Means which their Commissioners made
use of in their Treaty with their King, and the indirect ways by which they
had brought him into Scotland. VI. For their not having sufficiently purged the
Kings Family. VII. For the just Grounds they had to believe that his Majesty's
repentance was not real; nor from his heart.
The besieging of Edinborough Castle.
The rest of the Month was employed in the making of the Siege and Approaches
against the Castle of Edinborough, and in applying the Mines to the VValls. And
on the thirtieth the English with so much gallantry surprised one of their
Bulwarks, as they carried thence three hundred Muskets, one Ensign, and
several other Arms, without the loss of one Man. On the first of October, the
Besieged began to make their Salleys to hinder the working of the Miners, upon
whom they fired incessantly with their great and small Shot, yet however they
continued their Sappinges. Upon the second of the said Month, upon notice that
several Arms and Ammunitions of War were hidden in the Cathedral Church at
Edinborough they were transported thence. Whilst the fortifying of Leith was
carried on vigorously, as well as the Mines under the Castle of Edinborough,
that no time might be lost; his late Highness whose great Soul could not live
without Action, and who was not to be taken up by one or two single Objects,
marched off with part of the Army to go and view Glascow, which having done,
and finding that he was not in a Condition to assail it at that time, he
returned back to Edinborough; but by the way, he rased two strong Holds whither
the Moss Troopers were accustomed to retreat and shelter. And as the Scots had
a puissent Enemy in the heart of their Country, so had they a far greater in
their very Bowels, since its generally confessed, That the greatest of all Evils
which can possibly happen to a State, Is the Divisions which the different
professions in Religion, and the other particular Interests do beget: For in
the North of Scotland, there was a Party for the King, separated from the
Churches, in the West, there was a Party for the Church separated from the
King; so likewise there was a third Party more moderate, who held both for King
and Church, and all these intestine Divisions were carried on with such a
violent animosity, as that they neglected the common good, and were even ready
to cut each others throat: The last of these parties was the strongest, being
composed of the General States of the Kingdom, as then held at Sterling, who
nevertheless stood upon their Guards, as well as the several others did, they
being afraid of each other. The Assembly of the Estates used their best
endeavors to reconconcile these two parties, and to this purpose treated
mainly with the Colonels Carre and Straughan, who seemed to be the chief Heads
of the said parties, but they could not prevail with them. His late Highness
who was always as politic as vigilant, endeavored to make good use of their
dissentions, and so wrote both unto Carre and Straughan, but their particular
quarrels hindered them not to join in their general animosities against the
English, whom they reputed to be their common Enemy. But the said proffers
which were made unto them, having as little wrought upon them as the care of
their own preservations, Colonel Whaley was commanded with a good Squadron of
the Army, to go and reduce them to their obedience, which he undertook not,
however, before he had once more assailed to gain them by fair means, wherefore
he sent a Letter unto them both, representing unto them in substance as
follows, viz.

That all the world knew how many amicable ways and endeavors had been used
by the English since their being in Scotland, to hinder the effusion of
Christian blood; and although all the said undertakings had proved fruitless,
yet they still harbored the same thoughts and resolutions, continuing thus,
that their arms were always ready and open to receive and embrace them,
whenever it should please God to inspire them to meet them halfway. That
their design was not to rule over them, nor to entrench upon their liberties,
far less on their Church Government, or to possess their goods and fortunes,
their drift being only to advance the Lords work: But if they perished in their
blindness, and would continue to harbor frivolous and vain hopes, they must
continue to be their enemies to their rests, and declared unto them, that all
the miseries which should befall them hereafter, either by the sword or famine,
would fall very heavy on their own account.

Colonel Carr sent an answer to this Letter quite in another strain then it
might have been expected from persons who professed to desire nothing so much
as an accommodation; and this Answer was returned to Commissary General Whaley,
at his being at Carlisle, according to the tenor following, or very nigh the
same: That although they were not strong enough to resist the English their
unjust Invasion, yet that they had strength enough to undergo it, and that by
their actions and sufferings they would submit themselves to the will of God,
until the time of their deliverance should come: That in case they should have
the happiness to perish in doing of their duties, it would be too much grace
that God would do unto them, that they doubted not but when their miseries
should be arrived at the full pitch, their Fortune would then change, adding
that they thought it very strange, that the English should mention a cessation
of Arms at the same time when they laded their Subjects with Irons, when they
took their Towns, when they imprisoned their Ministers, and by this means
bereaved their flocks (now going astray) of the only and best comforts which
they had left unto them amidst their greatest miseries: Concluding thus, That
if they would voluntarily desert and relinquish Scotland, and afterward enter
upon a Treaty in such a manner as becomes Christians to do, it would be a
reciprocal grace and favor they would do unto both Nations. But these
Interparlies having proved thus unprofitable, the English began to fall to work
again, and Major Brown possessed himself of a strong place called Ball-house,
and afterward took the Castle of Dorlington, in which there were great store
of Ammunitions of war found, and in this last some Mosse-Troopers, some of
which were put to death. Colonel Monk likewise with a party both of Horse and
Foot, marched toward the Castle of Rozellar within seven miles of Edinborough,
which was also surrendered after some Granado Shells were fired into it:
Immediately after which Colonel Lambert marched with 2000 Horse toward
Dumfreez, in quest of Colonel Carre who was about Peblies, and likewise Colonel
Whalley who commanded a Squadron of that party, took Dalkeith on his march,
which merely surrendered upon the threats which he sent in unto those who
defended it, although the walls of the said Castle were 13 foot thick, and that
they were well stored with Canon, Arms, and all kind of warlike Ammunitions,
and provisions of victuals. Meanwhile Colonel Lambert having with much
difficulty passed the River Hamilton, encamped there that night, whereof
Colonel Carre having notice, did endeavor to surprise him the next morning at
the very break of day, which he likewise did very briskly, but the English
having opportunely taken the Alarm, and being unwilling that any of the
Enemies forces should escape out of their hands, did surround them in such a
manner, as that they found themselves at one and the self same time set upon on
all sides. The English in a trice killed them 100 men, and took as many
prisoners: Not could the Scotch Horse escape their clutches, so that they
dismounted 400. Horsemen, whose Horses and baggage they brought away, and
might have had the men too, but that they would not stand to trouble themselves
with so many Prisoners, but rather follow the Run-awayes, and so contented
themselves to take the most considerable persons: They chased the Scots as
far as Air Town: Colonel Carre himself was wounded and taken Prisoner,
together with his Captain-Leivtenant, as well as his Lievtenant-Colonel and
Major Straughon: as for Captain Giffin, and several other chief Officers of
their party, they came and voluntarily surrendered themselves up to Major
General Lambert, who brought them all with him to the Head quarters at
Edinborough. During all which, the approaches against Edinborough Castle, were
continued, but to speak the truth, with little or no effect, till the Month of
December, when as all the Troops which were dispersed up and down the Country,
were assembled and brought together, by reason of the ill weather and sharp
season, which would not permit them any longer to keep the field, and then they
fell to work in earnest toward the reducing of the said Castle, which is the
strongest and most considerable of all that Country, against which a Platform
was raised to place the Morter-pieces and the great Guns on, but those within
relied so much on the strength and goodness of the place, that they hung out a
Flagge of defiance; but not long after they were glad to take it in again,
whereby it was conceived that the Morter-shells had done some execution, and
that thereby they were constrained to change their tune; so that in lieu of
their former Flagge, they were glad to hang out a white one, betokening Peace,
and likewise they sent out a Drummer to propound, That they were resolved to
yield, if so be they might be permitted to send to the Deputy of the States,
which being refused them, they desired to parley, and so delivered up the
place. Moreover one of the most remarkable and essential parts of his Highness
life, was his ability in making choice of capable personages, fit to serve the
State as well by their Councels, as for the managing of the wars, and indeed
herein the Parliament always preferred his opinion and sense beyond all
others, having found by experience, that his advice and counsels were
accompanied with a good fortune, as his valor constrained her to Crown his
actions.

The good success of the Naval Forces under General Blake.
And on the other part, General Blake, who commanded the Commonwealths Fleet
at Sea, was no less successful by Sea then his late Highness was by Land,
whose Naval Forces being anchored before Lisbone, having taken several French
and Portugal men of war, which much endamaged the English Merchantmen,
especially those which traded to the Levant, was obliged by ill weather and for
want of provisions, to quit that Coast, and to leave the Port of Lisbone free.

During which, Prince Rupert making use of this opportunity, set sail toward
Mallaga, where he took, burnt, and pillaged several English Merchantmen,
which obliged Admiral Blake to reduce his Fleet to seven of his best sailing
Frigates, and sending the rest into England with the Prizes which he had taken,
he pursued the Enemies with all possible speed and diligence, and being arrived
at Mallaga, he understood that they had made sail toward Alicant, and in his
search of them, betwixt the Cape of Gat and Paulo, he took a French Ship, which
carried twenty Guns, and presently afterward the Roe-buck of Prince Ruperts
Fleet, after which he encountered with another called the Black Prince, which
rather then she would suffer her self to be taken, ran on shore, and fired her
powder: Some few days after four Vessels more of Prince Ruperts Fleet ran on
shore in the Bay of Carthagena, where they were lost, and deserted by their
Ships Companies: Prince Ruperts Fleet ruined.
Insomuch that of all that Fleet, there was but two left, which steered their
course toward Majorca and Sumaterra. General Blake having thus missed them,
would no longer continue the pursuit, lest the Commonwealth might need him on
more urgent and important occasions, so that he set over for England, to
receive the Laurels due to his good service, having done as much as could be
expected from a person of Honor and Courage, always faithful and true to the
Commonwealth. He was received by the Parliament with all the praise and thanks
he could expect for his good service, but especially by the Merchants, who
treated him highly, and immediately revived the Trade again, which had for so
long time as it were layn dead by the interruptions of so many Enemies.
Notwithstanding which good successes the Royallists were not backwark to be
stirring in England, being incited thereunto by the Ministers of the old Church
of England, one of their Agents Benson being discovered, was put to death: So
likewise in the County of Norfolk certain people made a rising, and under the
notion of abolishing Papisme, Schisms and Heresies, and of re-establishing the
King, they gathered to a head, but the Parliament not giveing them time to get
into a body, they were routed and defeated, and a score of them were put to
death. Much about which time there happened a contest at Constantinople betwixt
two English Ambassadors, the one a Royallist, the other a Common-wealths-man,
and to know which was the true Ambassador, they referred their business to the
-- who delivered the Royallist into the others power, to dispose of him as he
pleased, and in reference thereto he was imbarqued at Smyrna for London, where
he was beheaded before the Exchange.

But to return to Scotland, where the cold Northern Climate seems to have
buried all the Martial heat, although not the Scotch Ministers zeal, who had
excommunicated Straughon and Swinton, for adhering to the English, who
performed in those parts as much as the rigor of the season would permit men
to do, and the Scots on the other side labored to unite and settle each
others minds and differences, give order for new Levies, and Crowned their
King with the greatest magnificence as the indigency and necessity of their
affairs would permit. The Scots, who were better accustomed to the rigor and
violence of their Winters then the English, thinking to have some advantage
over them, would not let slip so favorable a season without their making some
good use thereof, wherefore Lieutenant General David Lesly, with a party of 800
Horse endeavored to surprise Lithgoe, maintained but by one Regiment of Horse,
under the Command of Colonel Sanderson, but finding the English upon their
guards, were forced to return without any attempt at all: And the English on
the other side, to let them see that the harsh season had not quite benumbed
them, took the field with two Regiments, one of Horse, the other of Foot,
commanded by Colonel Fenwick, and marched toward the taking of Hume Castle,
which was very strong by reason of its situation; I have here inserted two
Letters which passed between the Besiegers and the Besieged, by reason that the
one denotes an absolute power in the Country, and the other bears an
extraordinary style.

TO THE GOVERNOR Of the CASTLE of HUME.
SIR,
HIs Excellency the Lord General Cromwell, Has commanded me to reduce to his
Obedience the Castle which you keep; In case you deliver it into my Hands for
his Service, it shall be on such Articles which may please you, and those which
are with you, by which means you will not a little ease the Neighboring
Countries about you: In case you give me a refusal, I doubt not but by Gods
assistance to obtain that which at present I demand of you: I expect your
Answer to Morrow by seven in the Morning, and remain your Servant

FENVVICK.


THE ANSWER: To the GOVERNOR of BARWICK, Colonel FENWICK.
Right Hourable,
I Have seen a Trumpet of yours, as he says, without a Pass, who does summon
me to surrender the Castle of Hume to the Lord General Cromwell; That it may
not displease you, I never did see nor know your General: as for the Castle of
Hume, it is seated on a Rock. Given in the Castle of Hume this day, before
seven of the Clock. In these terms I do remain, without prejudice to my
Country, your most humble Servant

Tho. Cockburne.


BUt the Morter-pieces had no sooner made a slight breach, when as they
demanded to parley, and because they would not receive such Conditions as were
preferred unto them, they were forced to be contented with such Conditions as
they could obtain, and thus they surrendered at discretion. After which, Colonel
Monk with about three Regiments of Horse and Foot laid siege to Tymptallon
Castle, which for the space of eight and forty hours together, he battered with
Morter-pieces without any effect, whereby he was enforced to raise a Battery of
six Guns, which did mavelous execution, whereupon the besieged desired to
parley, but no composition would be given them, so that at last they were
constrained to yield to the mercy of the Conqueror, and to deliver into his
hand all the Arms, Cannon, Ammunitions of War, and Provisions; The keeping of
which Place by the Scots, was a shrewd Thorn in the sides of the English, who
were by the parties from the said Castle situate between Edinborough and
Barwick daily taken and dispoiled, when as they stragled never so little out of
their way, which enforced his late Highness to cause this ensuing Declaration
to be published, and to have executed with the utmost rigor; Viz.

A DECLARATION
By GENERAL CROMWELL.

A Declaration for the security of the Soldiers.
FInding that several who bear Arms under our Colors, are stripped, robbed, and
most barbarously and inhumanely murdered by Thieves and Vagabonds, who are not
under discipline of any Army; And moreover that the Inhabitants of these Parts,
instead of answering our goodness, do join with such people and support them;
And considering that it is in the power of the said Inhabitants, to discover
and produce them, since they do for the most part dwell round about those
places, where usually the said Villainies are committed; Observing moreover,
that by the Intelligence which is given by the Peasants, the said Robbers come
forth of their lurking places. Therefore I do declare, That in whatsoever place
it shall happen, that any of our Men shall be robbed and dispoiled, or killed by
such like persons, I shall require life for life, and an entire restitution for
those things which shall be so stolen, upon the Villages, and other places,
where the Fact shall have been committed, unless they discover and produce the
Malefactor: And hereof I will that all men take knowledge, that none may
pretend cause of Ignorance herein.

Given under my Hand and Seal at Edinborough 5. November. 1656. Signed, O.
Cromwell.

BY virtue of this Proclamation several sums of money were raised on those
Parishes and places where the like Robberies and Murders were committed, and
those who were found either to be the Authors of, or Accomplices therein, in any
manner whatsoever, were either put to death, or put to a pecuniary Mulct.
Shortly after there was a design upon Brunt Island, but at that time it took
not any effect; whereas General Cromwell, drew all his Forces out of
Edinborough, to have maintained them all the rest of the VVinter in Fyfe, which
is the best part of all Scotland, but the rigor of the Season, and the
difficulty of the passage constrained him to face about again to his old
Quarters, which were very good by reason of the Shipping which continually
arived at Leith with all kind of Provisions for the Soldiery Horse and Foot;
which said Refreshments came in very good time to the Army, which being not
accustomed to the extreme rigor of the VVeather in those Parts, was
incommodated by several Diseases, and amongst the rest, by a certain
contagious Fever which is peculiar to that Country, and the which had also
seized the General himself, who spared his person no more then the least
Soldier; His late Highness was so cast down by this kind of Contagion, as that
it was believed he would scarce have escaped death: and it may be said that his
sickness was the greatest of the whole Armies, for the private Soldiers they
lost no Courage, but did gladly and joyfully withstand and out-brave those
difficulties which stopped Julius Caesar in his enterprise in those parts, and
who chose rather to be at the charge of a prodigious Wall which fenced him
from the Scotch Incursions, then to engage his Army in that mountainous
Country, hoary with Snow and Ice, and the Conquest whereof was by the English
undertaken in the very heart of the VVinter.

And whilst the fierceness of the VVinter is passing over, we will leave both
parties in Scotland, being separated by a River, which was impossible to be
passed over in that Season, and will make a small digression into England, to
see what in the mean while passed there. At Oxford, one of the most famous
Universities of England, A certain Maiden, who bym if chance at four Months end
cast her Fruit, was accused, to have done it wilfully and of set purpose, to
have used some art therein; and without any more formalities was Impeached and
condemned to be hanged, which was accordingly done; and some while afterward
the Physicians and Chirurgions being resolved to make a dissection of her body,
there being no Symptoms of life at all in her: Notwithstanding, just as they
were ready to cut her up, as if she had been only in a Dream, and as if her
shamefacedness being not able to endure the touching and looks of so many men,
had awakened her to shun their Eyes and Rasors, she gave some tokens of life,
to the admiration of the wisest and most judicious men learned in the like
Cases, who all of them declared, that she was really dead* whereupon no kind of
remedies were left unassailed to bring her to herself, which accordingly was
accomplished, and she at present lives in as perfect health as even she did
before; It being not Gods will nor pleasure, that during the Government of the
justest of Conquerours, there should an act of so high an Injustice pass, as
the barbarous condemning and putting to death so innocent a Creature, as the
Event proved this silly Maiden to be.

But to come to public Concernments, the Parliament being desirous together
with the Kings person to extirpate his Memory, and to remove those Objects
which might beget tenderness in the people (who do always bemoan the
misfortunes of those whom before they hated) Commanded that his Statues should
be flung down, whereupon that which stood on the VVest-end of St. Paul's Church
in London was cast down, and the other which was placed in the old Exchange,
placing this following Inscription in the Comportment above the same; Exit
tyrannus Regum ultimus Anno Libertatis Angliae restitutae primo, Anno Domini,
1648. Januarii 30. In like manner the A^mes of the Crown of England, which were
placed in the Churches, in the Courts of Judiciture, and other public places,
were taken down: And the Commonweath being now as it seemed solidly
established, some neighboring States who desired to be in Amity with Her, sent
their extraordinary Ambassadors over; as namely, the Hollanders, Spain and
Portugal, and by the following Negociations the issues of the said Embassies
will easily appear.

As to the Spanish Ambassador, satisfaction was continually demanded of him,
for the Murder which was committed on the persons of this Commonwealths
Agents at Madrid, nor was this State at all satisfied with the Answer thereon
returned; That the Contestations between the King of Spain and his Clergy, on
that particular were not as yet reconciled or brought to naissue. And as to the
Portugal Ambassador, great and vast sums being demanded of him for the
reimbursement of those Charges which the King his Master had caused the
Commonwealth to be at, and for the reparation of those damages which the
English Merchants had sustained: He replied, he had no Orders to make Answer
thereunto; whereupon he had his Audience of departure, and went his way.

Immediately after, this Commonwealth sent two extraordinary Ambassadors to the
States of the united Provinces, the Lords Oliver St. John's, and Walter
Strickland, Personages of a high repute, and endowed with exquisite Parts;
their Train was great ad splendid, and their Equipage favored not a little of
the Splendour of their continued Victories: They Embarked in the Downs on the
eleventh of March, 1651. and the next day toward even they came to an anchor
near Helvoot Slugs, but not without some danger, on the 13 they made toward
Rotterdam in the long-boats, and by the way they were met by some of the States
Jachts or Barges, and being arrived they were by the English Merchants
conducted to their public House, where they were most splendidly entertained;
whither the Spanish Ambassador sent to complement them, by one of his
Gentlemen, to testify unto them his joy for their happy arrival, beseeching
them to enter into and join with him in a right understanding. Two or three
days after, they set forward toward the Hague, and by the way were met by the
Master of Ceremonies, accompanied with about thirty Coaches, and after some
reciprocal complements passed and exchanged, they were conducted to a stately
House which was prepared for them in the Town, where having been three days
treated at the States charges, they had audience. In which the Lord St. John's
made a most Elegant and learned Speech, in English, and gave the Copy thereof
unto the Lords States both in English and in Dutch, the most essential points
whereof were as follows.

I. That they were sent unto the Lords, the High and mighty States of the
United Provinces, on the behalf of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of
England, to ciment a firm League and Confederation betwixt the two
Commonwealths, in case their Lordships thought it fitting, notwithstanding the
injuries which the English had received from the Holland Nation. II. That they
desired to renew and confirm the Treaties and Agreements formerly made,
concerning the Traffic and Commerce betwixt both Nations. III. After which
they exhibited the advantages which the Hollanders would reap by this said
union, in regard of the commodious situation of England, for the Traffic,
with the multitude and security of her Havens, and of all things which may
advance the Commerce and Trade. IV. Finally he told them, That he wus commanded
by the Parliament of England and by the Commonwealth, to make known to their
Lordships, how sencibly they were touched with the Murder which was committed
on the person of their Agent, Mr. Dorislaus, and that they doubted not but
their Lordships would use all possible endeavors to discover the Authors of
that horrid and unworthy action.
After which, the Lords States being informed, that the said Lords Ambassadors
followers were daily molested and affronted by the English Royallists, and
other persons, who resided in Holland, they caused a Proclamation to be drawn
up, which they sent unto the Lords Ambassadors, to know of them whether it was
penned in the due terms, according to their good liking, whereby on pain of
death they prohibited, that no man should either by words or deeds, offend or
molest any of the said Ambassadors followers or retainers. Three months time
was already elapsed in their Negotiation at a vast expense, and with a far
greater patience, without that the least satisfaction in the world could be
obtained at the hands of Justice, for those daily affronts and injuries which
were put upon the Lords Ambassadors Retinue and Servants, and the scorns and
disgraces offered to their own persons, even to such a pitch, as that the
Common people and Rascality would assemble themselves at the Gates of their
house, and belch out injurious language, and set upon, and injure their
Servants. Now the Parliament being sensible of these wrongs and injuries, and
seeing the Lords States did not at all answer those kind proffers and
endeavors which were made unto them, to beget and fettle a solid and firm
alliance and peace betwixt the two Commonwealths, save with delays and
shifts, purposely to gain time upon the English, till they should be able to
judge how the face of things would evidence it self in Scotland, and which way
the Chain would turn there, they recalled their Ambassadors.

Which sudden and unexpected news extremely surprised the Hollanders, who
testified their astonishments thereon to the Lords Ambassadors, by more
frequent and oftener visitations then formerly, and by which they endeavored to
persuade them to believe the sincerity of their intentions, and how earnestly
and ardently they desired the alliance which their Lordships had propounded.
But all these fair words were not able to stay the Ambassadors, who immediately
returned into England again, to cut out another guess kind of work for the
Hollanders. And that which gave the greater cause of jealousy unto the
English, and made them believe that the Hollander dealt deceitfully with them,
was that their Admiral Van Trump lay lurking about the Isle of of Scillie,
with his Fleet, as if he had some design to make himself Master of them: But
when as the States were demanded the reason of his lying there, they replied,
that their Admirals being in those parts was only to demand restitution of some
Ships, Goods and Merchandises which the Pirates of those parts had despoiled
their Merchants of: Which answer though in some measure it satisfied the
Parliament, yet not so far as to trust too much therein to the Hollanders,
and whereby the Parliament was obliged to give order for the sudden reducing
of that Island to their obedience.

The reducing the Isle of Scilly.
General Blake being reinforced by a Squadron of Ships commanded by Sir George
Askue which was designed for the reduceing of the Cariba Islands made sail
toward Scilly, where immediately they set ashore 300. Seamen, besides the
Land-men, the Seamen gave the first onset with a great deal of courage and
resolution, and the Land-men did second them very well, insomuch that they
speedily became Masters of the Isles of Tresco and Briars, where they took 150
Prisoners, after they had once slain a score of them. They found in the place
two good Frigates, one of 18 Guns and the other of 32. and immediately possessed
the best Haven of all these Islands, whence the Enemies fled unto St. Mary's,
the strongest of all those Islands, but which held not long out afterward, and
so they were all reduced. It is unnecessary to lose time in the disating upon
the strength and conveniences of those Islands, since all what art and nature
could possibly allotte unto them, is there to be found, and so need but look
into the Mappes, to judge by their very situation, of what concernment they are
unto England. Meanwhile it is worthy admiration that so difficult a Conquest
should be attained in so little a space of time, with the loss of so few men
only. And whereas the Royallists did continue to make good Cornet Castle in
the Isle of Guernsey, and on a false advise, that there were but forty men in
the place, eighteen of which were also said to be incapable of doing service, a
resolution was taken to set upon the said Castle, and to carry it by
surprisall; but when the attempt was made, there were found to be in the place
threescore good men, who when the Scaleing Ladders were applied to the walls,
and the assault given to the place, defended themselves resolutely, and
endammaged the Assailants in such a manner, with Stones and Timber which they
cast down upon them, as also by their Canon which flanked the wall, charged
with Case-shot, as that they killed diverse of the Assailants, and constrained
the rest to retire, and the greatest dysaster that happened, was, that a Vessel
or two in which the men retired, were sunk by the Canon from the Castle: And
however this attempt did not succeed, yet the English did like courageous men,
and deserved no less praise then if they had carried the place. About which
time, one Brown-Bushell was beheaded at London, a famous Royallist both by Sea
and Land, for having deserted the Parliaments Forces, and having since
committed several Murders and mischievous actions.

But it is time to return into Scotland, and to see in what posture both Armies
are there. The English, who would not remain idle, only to keep their Men in
action, besieged Blackness, a considerable place, and whence their quarters
were continually allarum'd by the Mosse-Troopers, who retreated and sheltred
themselves in that place. Blackn^sse taken by Colo^el Monk.
Colonel Monk commanded in chief in this Expedition, who with but a handful of
men, causing a Battery to be raised, and having given them some few volleys of
Cannon, constrained them to yield. The Scots unit^.
On the other side, all the several dissenting parties amongst the Scots,
notwithstanding their differences, quarrels, jealousies, and their terrible
excommunications, did unite themselves altogether, by their common interest,
wherein they concurred to re-establish their King, whereunto they were
encouraged by several under hand practices which were carried on here in
England, and chiefly in Lancashire, which was generally to have risen in Arms:
A Plot discovered.
One of the chief Agents interessed in this business, by name Mr. Thomas Cook,
was taken at London, who discovered part of the design, and more was known by
Letters which were found in a Vessel sailing from the Mount of Scotland to the
Isle of Man, which belonged to the Earl of Darby, and who anon will appear more
visibly in this business, as also Mr. Birkenhead was taken, being charged with
several Orders and Instructions by which the most hidden and intricate secrets
of this conspiracy were discovered. Major General Harrison sent to the North.
These proceedings obliged the Parliament to order a party both of Horse and
Foot under the command of Major General Harrison, to march toward the North,
as well to dissipate such raisings as should chance to happen there, as to
oppose the Enemy, should they make an irruption by the way of Carlisle.
Meanwhile, several persons of note were impeached, and tried for having a hand
in this Conspiracy: Mr. Love and Gibbons beheaded.
The names of the chief are as follows, viz. Mr. Christopher Love, Major
Alford, Major Addams, Colonel Barton, Mr. Blackmore, Mr. Case, and Mr. Cauton,
Doctor Drake, Mr. Drake, Captain Far, Mr. Gibbons, Mr. Haviland, and Mr.
Jenkins, Major Huntington, Mr. Jackwell, Mr. Jackeson, Mr. Walton, Mr.
Robinson, Captain Massey, Captain Potter, Lieutenant Colonels, Jackeson,
Sowton, and Vaughan, and several others.

Two of which number were only put to death, being found more guilty then the
rest, to wit, Mr. Love and Mr. Gibbons, who were both beheaded on Tower Hill.
And a false report being spread in the principality of Wales, that General
Cromwell was defeated in Scotland, and that the Royallists Army was entering
England, a party began to form it self in those parts, but as the cause of the
same rising was false, so the effect thereof did soon vanish.

Now the English being resolved to terminate the war of Scotland, caused
Vessels to be built, to pass over the River, and to enter into Fife, which
began to allarum the Enemies who were on the other side of the water, as also
those in Brunts-Island. Nor were the Scots idle neither, but incommodated those
quarters of the English which were the most advanced, which they effected with
the greater advantage, being versed and known in the ways and advances, and by
this means they slew several English Soldiers as they went out to forage and
to get in Provisions, whereby the English were constrained to quit their
Out-quarters, and having thus engrossed their Army by the said Garrisons, they
advanced toward Fife, and to that end made their Magazine at Blackness, but
not finding wherewithal in the Country to feed their Horse, they retarded
their March for some few days: The Scotch army completed refuse to fight.
By which time the Scots having completed their Levies, found themselves to be
15000 Foot, and 6000 Horse, with which Force they marched toward a place called
Torwood on this side Sterling, whereby they were faced by the English Army, but
would not engage in a Battle, keeping themselves within their Bogges, and
other inaccessable places, Colonel Overton passes into Fife.
whereupon the English resolved to pass over part of their Army on the other
side of the River, and Colonel Overton being thereunto ordered, did on the 6th
of July, 1651. pass at Queens Ferry with 1600 Foot, and four Troops of Horse,
having in his said passage lost but six men; as soon as they were arrived they
fell to intrenching themselves, and at the same time, the General with the
body of the Army marched directly toward the Enemy, to the end, that in case
the Scots should make a show to march toward Fife, he might charge their Rear,
before they should gain Sterling, and the Scots being unwilling to let the day
pass without driving the English out of Fife, sent 4000 Horse and Foot, under
the command of Sir John Brown, to set upon the English, which obliged General
Cromwell to send over a re-inforcement of two Regiments of Horse, and two
Regiments of Foot, under the Command of Major General Lambert, Major General
Lambert passes into Fife.
in less then 24 hours they were passed over and joined to the others, and
immediately the Regiment of Colonel Okey advanced toward the Enemy, which
engaged them to draw up into Battel-array, and the English likewise did the
same, who though they were more in number then the Scots, yet they had the
advantage of the ground, and the Scots being placed on a hill, they remained
face to face for the space of an hour and a half, looking on each other, the
Scots not being willing to march down nor lose their advantage, insomuch that
the English at last resolved to march up toward them, and set upon them so
resolutely, as that after a very slender contest they quite routed them, and
made such a butchery amongst them, that they killed 2000 of their 4000 took
1400 Prisoners, 4000 Scots defeated by the English.
amongst whom Sir John Brown who commanded the Party, Colonel Buchanam, and
several other persons of quality on the English side, there were but few
slain, but many hurt; and in reference hereunto more Forces were sent over into
Fyfe, in case the whole Body of both Armies might chance to come to a general
Battle. Immediately after the English became Masters of Inchigarvy a strong
Castle, situate upon a Rock in the midst of the Province of Fryth, between
Queens Ferry and North Ferry, in which there were sixteen piece of Ordnance
mounted. Brunt Isleland surrendered.
On the twenty seventh of July, all the English Army appearing before Brunt
Island, the Governor there of took such an Alarm thereat, as that after a
small Contest in a Parley, he surrendered the same, delivering unto the English,
together with the said Island, all the Men of War which were found in the
Haven, all the Cannon of the place, as also all the Arms, Ammunition of War,
and the provision of Victuals; which said Isle was very considerable for the
English to make a Magazine and Storehouse for the Provisions and Ammunition for
the Army.

St. John's Town surrendered.
Thence the Army marched to St. John's Town, a very strong and considerable
place, into which the Enemy had but just before put a fresh Regiment, who were
resolved to have defended themselves very well, but as soon as they saw that
their Sluices were cut off by the English, they lost their Courage, and
surrendered the place,

The Scots enter England by Carlisle.
Meanwhile there happened a great change of Affairs, for the Scots Army
consisting in 16000 men, abandoned their own Territories, in hopes of
establishing themselves in a better Country, and by the way of Carlisle enter
England.

The English follow
General Cromwell being advertised hereof, issued out immediately such Orders as
were requisite to pursue the Scots, and with all possible speed the Army
repassed the River of Fife upon a Bridge of Boats at Leith, Major General
Lambert the sooner to overtake the Enemies Rear, with 3000 Horse and Dragoons
followed after them, and Major General Harrison with a Body of lighter Horse,
was commanded to get into the Van of the Enemy, for to amuse and detain them,
whilst the General himself with the Body of the Army consisting in sixteen
Regiments of Horse and Foot immediately pursued the Enemy.

Colonel Monk with 7000 men reduces all Scotland
But not wholly to abandon the Affairs of Scotland; Colonel Monk was left there
with 7000 men, with which alone he perfected the Conquest of that Kingdom,
taking immediately after this Change of the Scene, the strong Town and Castle of
Sterling, being a very considerable Place, and also Aberdeen, Dundee, and the
strong Castle of Dunnotters, and Dunbarton, with many others: Insomuch, as that
after the passage into Fyfe was once gained, the remaining parts of Scotland
were so on entirely subdued, and were made tributary unto the Commonwealth of
England.

Mean while, the divided Parties of the English Forces which pursued the Scots
Army, did quite and clean tire them out during their March, setting upon them
sometimes in the Van, sometimes in the Rear, sometimes in the Flank; and
finally, on all sides as they saw their opportunity to disturb and annoy them:
Insomuch that their long and precipitated March did much weaken the Scots. But
that which troubled and vexed them most of all, was the little hopes they saw
of those promises of relief which were given them from England, The Parliament
having settled such good Orders in all parts, as that no body durst stir or
rise in Arms to their Aid. In all places wheresoever the Scots came they
proclaimed their King, To be King of great Britain, France, and Ireland,
according to the accustomed Forms, and in his Name they sent unto all those
who had any Commands, or were in any Authority in those parts through which
they passed, to rise in Arms jointly with them, but no body budged. To the
contrary by Order of Parliament the Trained Bands of several Countries drew
forth in Arms, to hinder the Risings, and to augment the Commonwealths
Armies. On the one side, General Cromwells Army marched on the Heels of the
Scots to their Terror; on the other side, the Major General Lambert and
Harrison waited upon their Designs, and Colonel Robert Lilborn was left in
Lancashire, to hinder the Earl of Darby from levying men in those parts, and to
the same purpose, several other Bodies were placed in other places, as the
occasion required, both to cut off the Enemies Provisions, as well as his
passage; In case they should resolve to retreat back again, or to fly away.
Finally, the Scotch Army having reached the Town of Worcester, pitched its Camp
there, having much debated where, and in what manner they should fix upon a
resting and breathing place, after so long and tedious a march: Whereof the
Earl of Darby was no sooner assertained, but he issued forth of his Island with
300 Gentlemen, and Landed in Lancashire, where he assembled at least 1200 men,
during which, the Generals Regiment which was left at Manchester, was Commanded
to join with Colonel Lilborne, to cut off the Earl of Darbies passage to
Manchester, whither he was marching to have fallen upon the said Regiment; but
Colonel Lilborne observing his motion, marched the very same way, joining Flank
and Flank, with the Earls Forces, who deeming that he ought not to defer the
Fight with Lilborne, till he should have joined with the Generals Regiment,
when as then he might have proved too strong, but whilst he was weaker being
alone, fell upon Colonel Lilborne, and each side for the space of four hours
fight did behave themselves very well, The Earl of Darby defeated.
till at length the Earls Forces being worsted, he was constrained to save
himself, and to gain Worcester, almost all alone; amongst Prisoners of note,
which were taken in this Encounter, were Colonel Leg, Robinson, Baines,
Gerrard, four Livetenant Colonels, one Major, four Captains, two Livetenants,
twenty Gentlemen, and five hundred Soldiers. There were killed the Lord
Withrinton, Sir Thomas Fieldsley, Colonel Boynton, Sir William Throgmorton, Sir
Gamuell, and sixty Soldiers.

On the Parliaments side there were but ten men slain, but abundance were hurt,
which defeat, although it was but a small one, yet it was very ominous, and
served not a little to discourage those who were on the Brink of declining
themselves, and ready to rise in Arms; so that it may be said without vanity,
that the defeating of those 1500 men, hindered above 10000 to join with the
Scots at Worcester: and indeed Colonel Lilborne received those Honors and that
recompense from the Parliament which was due to his Valor; And the Lord
General Cromwell whose prudence did at all times equallize his Valor, nay far
surpass it, being conscious that diligence and expedition was more then
requisite in this Conjuncture, which was like unto a Gangren, continually
gaining ground, and therefore immediately to be cut off, least it should
endanger the whole; arived with his Army at Worcester, sooner then he was
expected, with a resolution to make his Enemies either perish within the place,
or constrain them to give Battle. Here Warlike stratagems or wiles were not
necessary, for there was no delaying of the business, neither was there any
retreat to be made, or flight to be taken; It matters not for one Town more or
less, This is the upshot Blow, where the best Swords were, to decide the
Interest of three Crowns. The Royallists were backed by despair, and the
others were animated with the continual and accustomed defeating of their
Enemies; Now both must either fight or die, and resolve to be a Cast or
nothing, and the Town of Worcester, this very day must be the bloody Theater,
of the fairest chance of Fortune which ever happened in the Isles of great
Britain; The first thing therefore which the Parliaments Forces endeavored,
was to gain a pass over the River of Severne, which was immediately performed by
Major General Lambert, at a place called Vpton, and which passage was made good
by Liveten at General Fleetwcods Brigade, which advancing toward Tame River, a
Bridge of Boats was laid over the same, and likewise another Birdge was made
over Severn on the Generals side, which being perceived by the Royallists they
caused a Body both of Horse and Foot to advance to oppose the Livetenant
Generals passage, Worcester Fight.
who was backed by two Regiments of Foot of Colonel Inglesbies, and Colonel
Fairfax's, by the Generals Troops of Guard, and Clonel Hackers Regiment of
Horse, all which were animated and encouraged by the Generals prerence, who
marched at the Head of them; after which Colonel Goff's, and Major General
Deans Regiments were passed over the River, who began to scour the Hedges
which were lined by the Enemy, and whence they drove them away, beating them
from Hedge to Hedge, being supplied with fresh men, but after this kind of
Skirmish had lasted well nigh a good hour, very smartly, the Royallists were
constrained to give ground, and to retire to Powick Bridge, which they made
good for an hour longer, but quitting it at length, they retired toward the
Town, except those which were made Prisoners; and within a little while
afterward, having assembled all their Forces, and all their Courage to boot,
they issued forth of the Town in a Body toward the Generals side, believing
that the best part of his Army had been on the other side (as in effect it was
separated in two by the before specified River, and the Royallists at their
first charge were so furious and resolute, as that the Generals Troops were
constrained to give way, but that only served to augment their courage, and
make them more covetous of Glory: Insomuch, that renewing their Fight with a
fresh vigor, they charged the Enemy so impetuously, as that the Scotch Army
both Horse and Foot were on a sudden over borne and quite brought into
disorder, all their Works and Lines, together with their Royal Fort, and their
Cannon were immediately taken, and turned upon and against themselves; the Town
was given in Pillage, The Scots defeated at Worcester.
and all their Foot were either slain or taken Prisoners, a Body of 3000 Horse
brake through and made their escape, and one thousand of them were taken by
Colonel Barton who lay about Bewdly, only with a few Horse and Dragoons, and
Colonel Lilborne with the Generals Regiments of Foot accidentally met with the
Earl of Darby, who a little before had escaped him, whom he seized, together
with the Earl of Landerdale,, and above a hundred persons of quality, several
others were likewise taken by the other parties which were abroad; as Duke
Hamilton General of the Scotch Army, who afterward died of his Wounds, the
Earl of Rothe, the Earl of Cornwarth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Packington,
Cunningham, and Clare, Knights, the Lords Spine and Sinclere, the Earl of
Cleaveland, of Kelley, and Colonel Greaves, six Colonels of Horse, thirteen of
Foot, nine Livetenant Colonels of Horse, eight of Foot, six Majors of Horse,
thirteen of Foot, thrity seven Captains of Horse, seventy three of Foot, fifty
five Quarter Masters, eighty nine Livetenants of Foot, Major General Biscotty,
Major General Montgomery, the Livetenant General of the Ordnance, the adjutant
General of the Foot, the Martial General, the Quartermaster General, the
Conductor General of the Baggage, seventy six Standards, ninety nine Ensigns,
nine Ministers, nine Chirurgions, one hundred fifty eight Colors, and all the
Cannon, and Baggage generally, the Royal Standard, the Kings Coach and Horses,
the Royal Robe, the Collar of the Order of the Garter, thirty of his domestic
Servants, and his Secretary Fa^shams as for the King his own person, he made
and escape strangely, and in a disguise he saved himself at length into France,
not without many difficulties and dangers; Notwithstanding the Parliament had
promised five hundred pounds to any one that could discover his Person. Several
other persons were also afterward taken in the remotest Countries; as Major
General Massey, who afterward made an escape, Major General Middleton,
Livetenant General David Lesly, and several others; insomuch, as that it may
be said, the Gleanings of this Victory, were as considerable as the whole
Harvest it self.

But let us return to our CONQUEROR, and observe with what a moderation he
enjoyed this his victory, he desires no triumphall preparations, He would not
that thanks should be returned to him for the same; but only to God alone, who
helped him with his mighty Arm to advance his own Glory, and to establish the
peace and repose of England, upon solid and firm Foundations, and when as the
Parliament did propound unto him most splendid and magnificent Presents, in
recompense, he only desired the Lives and Liberties of their Prisoners. They
proposed to have Bonefires made, and to have Triumphall Arcks erected, but he
answered; That it would be better to raise Monuments to such of their
Illustrious Patriots as lost their lives in the gaining of that Day, and to
bewail their deaths with Teats. And Iastly at the Generals request; there were
only the Earl of Darby, and Sir Fetherston Knight, of all this great number
of Prisoners put to death. besides some few others of less quality.

The remaining Nobility of Scotland seized and sent into England.
Much about which time also, that small Body of an Army which remained in
Scotland, seized upon a great number of the Nobility of the Country, who were
assembled all together at a place called Ellet; where the old General Lesly,
Earl Marshall, the Lord Keith, Cofford, Ogleby, Barany, Huntly, Lee, and
several other Knights, Gentlemen, and Ministers, were in Consultation, all of
which were put on board a Ship, and sent into England.

This great Storm being thus over-blown, and the Minds of the Parliament
Members being calmed, after the apprehensions of the Scotch Invasion, and the
doubtful and unexpected Events of a Battle, they began to track the Footsteps
of their Conquest a new, and the whole Commonwealth being entirely cleansed
within, they cast about how to reduce those Islands which sheltred several of
the Enemies small Vesssels, whereby the Trade was interrupted, and several
Merchantmen impeded in their Voyages: The Isle of Jersey attempted
The Isle of Jersey was the first they resolved to begin withal, and the
Conduct of this Enterprise was left to Colonel Haymes, who upon the same
account on the fourteenth of October, 1651. caused two Regiments of Foot, and
as many of Horse to be embarked on board of eight Ships, in the Port of
Weymouth, and the seventeenth they set Sail, but the Stormy Weather forced
them to return: On the nineteenth they set sail again, and on the same day
about Midnight, they came to anchor under the Island of Zoark, and next Morning
continuing their Course, they arived at Stowens Bay in Jersey; on the next day
they fell down with the Tide, and got into St. Brelads Bay, where they were
assailed by so vehement a storm as that the Fleet was dispersed, but having
joined to each other again; on the one and twentieth they resolved to go
ashoare that Night at Stowens Bay, wheunto they were necessitated for want of
Forage for the Horse, and as it were in a trice, they landed their Horse by an
admirable Industry of General Blake, and his other Officers in Boats, and two
hours after the Flood they weighed anchor, and some cut their Cables to run a
shore, and so the Foot Landed some at three some at four, some at five, and
some at six foot set and more, receiving all that while both the Cannon and
Musket shot which played upon them from the shore; Notwithstanding which they
gained Land, although they were faced by both the Horse and Foot of the Island,
but this was their advantage, they were so overcharged with Water, as that
they were not succeptible of Fire. Finally, after they had endured this first
brunt, they got all of them on shore, and quickly gained as much Ground as
served them to draw up into a Body to fight, which they accordingly did, with
so much resoluion and vigor, that in one half hours time they forced the
Enemy to retreat, who left their Ensigns behind them, and twelve piece of
Cannon, after which the Horse being a little heartned having been refreshed in
their Quarters in the Island, on the two and twentieth of October they
attempted three small Forts, each having two piece of Ordnance in them which
they took, after which, they advanced within sight of Elizabeth's Castle, to set
upon a Fort called the Tower of St. Albons, having fourteen piece of Ordnance
commanded by the said Castle: In two hours time they gained the said Tower, and
their next work was to possess the Castle of Montorqueil, which they also took
without much trouble; Jersey and all the Castles taken.
But Elizabeth's Castle being a very strong and considerable place into which
they had retired all rheir Forces, was not surrendered until the midst of the
Month of December, on the most advantageous Conditions which so considerable a
place could expect.

On the sixteenth of October 1651. there were embarked at Westchester and
Leverpoole three Regiments of Foot, to wit, The Isle of Man attempted, and
reduced.
General Cromwells, commanded by Livetenant Colonel Worstey, Major General
Deanes Commanded by Livetenant Colonel Michell, and Colonel Duck^nfields, who
Commanded the whole Brigade, together with two Troops of Horse, which Forces
were sent to reduce the Isle of Man.

On the eighteenth of the said Month they set Sail, but the VVind coming
contrary, they were driven into the Port of Beaumorris. On the twenty fifth, by
two in the Morning the Wind coming Southwardly, by the favor of a fresh Gale,
they set Sail again, and about two of the Clock in the Afternoon they
discovered the Custle of the Isle of Man, Rushen Castle, Darby Fort, and a good
part of the Island, as also the Inhabitants and Soldiery, as well Horse and
Foot in Arms, who were drawn out to make a review of their Forces, when as by
a sudden Gust the Fleet was hindered from approaching nearer the shore,
whereupon they tacked about toward the North of the Island, and not without
some difficulty they gained Ramsey Bay, where they Anchored that Night in sight
of the Island, and sent them Volleys of Cannon which were not at all answered
by those of the Island. On the twenty sixth of October, an Inhabitant was sent
on board the Fleet from the chief persons of the Island, to assure the
Commander that they would not in any wise hinder their Landing, But to the
contrary that they would deliver up unto them two Forts which they had
Mastered, after which there remained only Rushen and Peele Castle to be taken,
wherein they would also be assisting to the utmost of their powers: But because
the said Inhabitant brought nothing in writing to confirm what he had said,
Major Fox went on shore to be assured of the certainty thereof, and returning
well satisfied, he was followed by some Commissioners of the Island, who most
humbly beseeched the Officers not to ruin them, which must of necessity ensue,
should they Land all their Men, obliging and engaging themselves to bring
Provisions at reasonable rates, unto those who should remain on board the
Ships: The Commander in chief returned them thanks, promising them to do them
all the favor possible and imaginable; but it fell out unhappily for all
sides: That on the twenty seventh the Sea became very rough, and the Ships
being not able to remain all of them under shelter in the said Bay, they were
in a great deal of darger, and one Ship running a shore, was broken and rent
in sunder; however all the men were saved, and those within the Castles knowing
full well the danger wherein the Ships were, did increase the dangers from
shore as well as from Sea, and thereby became the more resolute and obstinate;
Insomuch that on the twenty eighth they were constrained to Land the Horse and
the rest of the Foot; who became Masters of the Forts, and afterward set upon
the Castles, in one of which was the Earl of Darbies Widow, who quickly
surrendered herself, together with all the Ammunitions of War, and some Vessels
which were Anchored in the Harbor.

Guerns^y Castle surrendered.
And not long after the strong Castle of Guernsey was also surrendered to the
Parliament, the whole Island having always remained under the obedience of the
Commonwealth, and never deserted the same.

And, as there is no felicity or bliss under the Heavens, which is not mingled
with some bitterness; The death of two famous Persons in England.
so in like manner, the great Conquest of the Parliament both by Sea and Land,
had some mixture of missorrunes on both Elements, on the Land by the decease of
a great Captain, and a greater Statesman, and on the Sea by the death of a
great Pilot, and a greater Admiral both together. The first was the Lord
Ireton, Son-in-law to his late Highness, who immediately after the taking of
Limrick, a very considerable place in those parts, died, during his being Lord
Deputy of Ireland, he was generally bemoaned of all men, being a person who had
rendered himself equally famous in Warlike Exploits, as well as in Politic
Affairs, and Sagacious Councels, and to speak the truth, there was scarce his
like in all England, and all the Comforts which survived his loss, were, that
those good Foundations which he had laid, and the Maxims which he had
prescribed for the Government of Ireland did not perish with him, but have
remained to his Successors, as Lamps and Lights whereby they may safely conduct
their Footsteps, and assuredly carry on their Designs.

The other famous Person who also dyed, was General Poppham, a Personage
endowed with all the good qualities of an exquisite Seaman, being valiant,
active, and well versed in Sea Affairs, his precipitated death, and the small
time he continued in that Employment, did show unto us less what he was, then
according unto all appearance what he would have been, had it pleased God to
have lengthned his days. And now the Parliament being truly sencible both of
the old and new Injuries which England had received from, and by the States of
Holland, thought it fit to publish this ensuing Manifest; Viz.

An Act of Parliament, concerning the Importation and exportation of Goods and
Merchandises.
THat no Commodities whatsoever of the growth or Manifacture of Africa, Asia,
America, or Europe, should be brought into England, or into any of the
Territories belonging thereunto, either by the English themselves, or by any
others, save in Vessels, or Barques, effectively belonging to this
Commonwealth, or the Collonies and Plantations in the Indies, who depend on
the same, on the penalty of forfeiting both Ships and Goods.

2. That all Commodities whatsoever of the growth or manifacture of Foreigners
which shall be brought within the Dominions of this Commonwealth, in Vessels
belonging to the Inhabitants thereof shall be taken and laden only in the
places where the said wares do grow or else in those Ports and Havens, whence
they must of necessity be brought, and where they are accustomed to be had and
bought at the first hand.

3. That all kind of Fish of the Fishing belonging to the people of this
Nation, as also all kind of Oil of Fish, Whales Oil, and VVhale Bones, shall
not be brought, save in such Ships where the said Fishing shall have been made,
upon the forementioned Penalty.

4. That after the first of February, 1653. there shall be no Salt-fish
transported out of England, save in English Vessels, etc. Then which, nothing
was more pleasing to the Merchants, nor could any thing have more eucouraged
them, to cause the Traffic and Navigation to flourish again, and whereby they
were not a little also endeared to the Parliaments Interest: So likewise was it
very effectual to gain the Seamens hearts, then which nothing is so apt to
rebel, and so hard to be kept in awe.

So likewise several other Ordinances and Regulations were made concerning
those Merchandises which are brought from the East Indies, from the Levant, and
from the Coast of Spain and Portugal, A Rupture with Holland caused.
all which did not much please, and but lease oblige the Hollanders; but to the
contrary did so exasperate their Minds, as that even during the time when they
were treating of an Accommodation, it came to an open War, concerning the
point of Honor at Sea, and in this wise the Quarrel begun.

The first Sea Fight with the Hollander, May 52.
MAjor Bourn Commander in chief of a Squadron of English Ships, discovered Van
Trump Admiral of the Dutch Fleet, on the back of Goodwine Sands, who with two
and forty Sail of Ships made toward Dover Road, whereupon the Frigate called
the Greyhound was commanded to make all the possible sail she could after
them, to speak with them, which she accordingly did, whereas they struck their
Sail, and gave all kind of tokens of honor and respect, saying moreover, That
they would gladly tell something in the behalf of their Admiral, unto the Party
that commanded the English Fleet in chief, and coming on board, they saluted
the English Ships, and to seem the more officious, they gave them an Account of
their Navigation in this wise; saying, That the Nothernly Winds having been
somewhat high for some days, they had been constrained to ply more to the
Southward, then else they willingly would have done, and that being come to an
Anchor somewhat hitherwards, to avoid the falling too near unto Dunkirk, they
had lost several Cables and Anchors, concluding that they had not the least
intention to do us any Injury. General Blake was at that time with the rest of
the Fleet toward the West, who being informed by Major Bourn of the
Hollanders proceedings, he used all the possible speed he could to join with
him, and on the nineteenth of May he discovered the Hollanders Anchored in
Dover Road, and being within three Leagues of each other, the Hollander weighed
Anchor, and sailed Eastward, where they met with an Express from the States,
whom they spoke withal, and afterward made all the Sail they could up to the
English Fleet, their Admiral Van Trump showing himself upon the Decks of the
foremost Ships; And General Blake coveting the honor to give the first Volley,
let fly three Guns at Van Trumps Flag, though without Bullets, To which Van
Trump answered by a shot from the Stern of his Ship backwards, signifying his
disdain to vale his Flag, and instead of the striking his Main Top-saile, he
caused a red Flag of War to be set up, in token of a Combat to his whole Fleet,
and without any further delay, he gave General Blake a whole Broadside, who
joyfully received it, and returned two for one, and for the space of four
hours together both Fleets fought with that Animosity and vehemence, which is
usually on the like occasions at the first fallings out: when at last, having
several times past and repast, through and through each other, General Blake
obtained the Victory, having sunk one Holland Man of War, took another with
thirty Guns made a hundred and fifty Prisoners, and both the Captains of the
said Ships, and sent the rest of their Fleet home by weeping Cross, to tell the
rest of their Butter-box Brethren the success of their rash Attempt: The
English lost but ten Men in this Fight, and had forty wounded, and of the whole
Fleet, the Generals Ship alone was somewhat endamaged in her Masts, Sails,
Tackling, and Apparel; After which the States of Holland disowned and disavowed
this Action, and to that purpose sent over two extraordinary Ambassadors into
England, who represented these Reasons to the Parliament of England, therein
declaring, Viz.

That the unhappy Fight betwixt the Fleets of both Commonwealths, happened
without their knowledge, and contrary to the will and desire of the Lords, the
States General of the united Provinces, taking God to witness of this Truth,
who knows the hearts of men, and that both by Letters and Messages they had
continually been assured of the said Lords and States Sincerity: That with
astonishment and amazement they had received the fatal tidings of so rash an
Attempt and Action; and that immediately they entered into Consultation, how they
might best find out a remedy to soften and excuse this fresh bleeding Wound: To
which end they had convocated a general Assembly of the Provinces, in the which
they doubted not, God willing, to meet with a present remedy to these Troubles,
whereby not only the Causes of all the evils which might ensue, should be
removed, but also by an interior Comfort men's Minds might be rectified, and
brought to a better hope of the Treaty which was on Foot, wherein their
Lordships labored daily, and in good earnest for the Welfare of both Nations,
to avoid the further effusion of Christian blood, so much desired by the
Enemies unto both Nations; wherefore they requested and desired most humbly of
this honorable Council by the Pledges of the Liberty and their mutual
concurrence in Religion; Not to suffer any thing to be undertaken with too much
precipitation and heat, which might at length become irrevocable, and not to be
remedied by vain Wishes, or too late Vows; but that without delay they might
receive a favorable Answer, which they the more earnestly desire, since their
Lordships, the States Ships, and Mariners were detained and impeded in their
Voyages, some by force and others by the Fights at Sea, and the rest in the
Ports of this Commonwealth.

Whereunto the Parliament thus replied, Viz.
THat whereas they remember with what continual Demonstrations of Friendship
they always Comported themselves toward their Neighbors of the united
Provinces, ever since the beginning of their Civil Wars, having not omitted any
thing which might tend to the preservation of a good understanding betwixt
them, they think it very strange to find how ill the said States have answered
these their Civilities, and especially by the Acts of Hostility which they
have lately exercised against this Commonwealths Fleet, and having taken the
whole into their Consideration, as well as the several Papers presented to the
Council of State by their Ambassadors; They do thereon answer, That as they are
ready to give a favorable interpretation to the expressions contained in the
said Papers, tending to represent how that the last Fight which happened lately,
was without the knowledge, and contrary to the intentions of their Masters; so
likewise, when they consider how incomformable and inconsistent with these
Thoughts and Discourses the proceedings of their State, and the behavior of
their Seamen has been in the very midst of a Treaty, and in what a manner the
said particulars have been Negotiated here by their Ambassador; The
extraordinary preparations of a 150 Ships without any apparent necessity, and
the Instructions which were by the said Lords States given to the Seamen, we
have but too great cause to believe; That the Lords the States General of the
united Provinces, have a design to usurp the known right which the English
have to the Seas, To destroy their Fleets, which after God, are their Walls and
Bulwarks, and thereby to expose the Commonwealth to an Invasion, according to
their own good liking, even as they have attempted to do by their last Action:
whereupon the Parliament do think themselves to be obliged, to endeavor by
Gods assistance, as they shall find occasion for the same, to seek the
reparation of those Wrongs which they have already received, and an assurance
for the future against the like which might be attempted against them: However
with a desire and an intention that things may be composed and put up in an
amicable way, if it be possible by such ways and means as God by his
Providence shall lay open, and by such circumstances as may tend to hasten this
Design, and may render it more efficacious then any other of the like nature
has not yet been.

Open War with Holland.
So that this Conference besides many others, having not been caple to produce
the Agreement and expected Reconciliation; the Holland Ambassadors took their
leaves of the Parliament, by a public Audience, and went their ways. And
immediately both these powerful Commonwealths prepared for an open War, all
the Waters of the Ocean being not able to quench their just Indignations, and
those Forces which they will both engender upon the Surface of the Sea, may
well and duly represent unto us the Image of the Chaos, and the Wars of the
Elements.

The Hollanders Fishermen destroyed in the North.
General Blake who seemed to have fastened the Sail of Fortune to his most
prodigious mast by the glorious appearance of his gallant and resolute Fleet,
makes Sail toward the Northen Parts, and about the Isles of Orkney, and
seized upon all the Holland Vessels which he found Fishing on that Coast, most
part of the Fishing Barques he sent away, and discharged as unworthy Objects,
or Ornaments to so stately a Navall Armado; but the twelve Holland Men of War
which were to convoy and secure them, he brought home with him.

A Holland Fleet destroyed by Sir Geo. Askue.
On the other side, Sir George Askue remaining in the Channel with another
Squadron of Ships, to clear and guard the same, discovered thirty Sail of
Hollanders betwixt Callis and Dover, to which he gave Chase, and constrained
them all for the most part to run a shore on the Coast of France, only ten
excepted, which were taken, burnt, and sunck, and in reference to this fatal
Rupture, there was not a day past wherein Prizes were not made by the English on
the Hollander and French, who likewise were not as yet well reconciled to the
English.

Thence Sir George Askue set Sail toward the West, as well to seek out for
the Hollander, as to guard those Coasts, and to convoy the Merchantmen which
were ready to set Sail from Plymouth through the Channel, and being come
within seven or eight Leagues of the said Port, he had notice given him that
the Holland Fleet was not far off, whereupon calling a Council of War, it was
conceived they might be met with about the Coast of France, a Resolution was
taken to make Sail thitherwards; and the same day which was the sixteenth of
August, betwixt one and two of the Clock in the Afternoon they discovered the
Holland Fleet, and immediately made up toward them as fast as they could, and
found them to be sixty Men of War, and thirty Merchant men; the English were
but eight and thirty Men of War, four Fire Ships, and four small Frigates,
who notwithstanding the inequality of of their Number, about four of the
Clock of the said Afternoon, encountered the Enemy with as much Gallantry and
Resolution as possible could be expected.

The Plymouth fight with the Dutch.
And Sir George Askue seconded by six other Ships immediately Charged into the
very Body of the Enemy, and however they were sufficiently damaged by this
first Charge, in their Sails Masts, and Yards, yet they got to the Wind-ward
of their Enemies, and once again Charged the whole Body of them, continuing
their said Combat very fiercely in this wise, and always being intermingled
pell-mell with the Enemy; until the obscurnesse of the Night had separated
them, and had the rest of the Fleet employed their parts as well as Sir George
Askue's Squadron did, it is believed the whole Hollands Fleet had been
destroyed: amongst the English there were several hurt and killed, however but
one Person of Note, Captain Pack a Person of Honor, and a very Valiant,
stout, and experienced Seaman, whose Leg being shot off by a Cannon Bullet,
he died immediately; there were also two other Captains hurt, Viz. Little, and
Whiteridge, Two of the Holland Men of War, and one of their Fire Ships were
sunck, as might be guest by the Wrecks afterward; for the Night which
terminated this Fight, did also debar the sight of the Fleets what it had
produced: So that the Hollanders continued their Course toward the Coast of
France, and the English toward Plymouth, to repair their Vesseels, but
especially their Masts, Yards, and Tackling, which were so much endamaged, that
they were forced to give over the pursuit of the Enemy.

Six Hollanders Ships taken by Genesis Blake.
And much about the same time that this Fight happened, General Blake steeting
North-wards, took six Holland Ships of a great value about the Downs, and sent
one Frigate toward the East, to reinforce Sir George Askue; presently
afterward Captain Pen Six more taken by Captain Pen.
plying also upon the Coast of France, took six Holland Ships, which had
formerly been in the Venetian Service, and were all of them bound homewards
richly Laden, being all Men of War of considerable Burden. A French Fleet
taken by Genesis Blake.


On the fifth of September, General Blakes Fleet riding at Anchor in the
Downs, having notice that a French Fleet was to touch in Callis Road, there to
take both Men and Ammunition on Board for the Relief of Dunkirk, he weighed
Anchor and made toward them, and about five in the Evening they were tiding it
out of Callis Road, with a Design in the Night to have set Sail toward
Dunkirk: But General Blake as soon as they were got to Sea gave them Chase, and
pursued them to the very Flats before Dunkirk, as far as he durst, by reason
of the Flats, and the Burden of his Ships; he took seven of their Men of
War, the least carrying two and twenty Guns, and one Frigate with eight Guns,
and also one of their Fire Ships; whereupon the Garrison of Dunkirk having been
disappointed of their expected Relief of Ammunitions and Provisions: Not long
after was forced, together with the rest of the Garrisons which depended on the
same, to yield to the Spaniards.

On the twenty seventh of September, General Blake discovered about sixty Sail
of Holland Men of War, Commanded by Admiral Dewit, on the backside of the
Goodwin Sands, so that next day he set Sail and made toward the Enemy, but
falling upon a Flat called the The Kentish Knock, a fight with the Hollanders.
Kentish Knock (under which the Hollander had purposely sheltred themselves, to
endanger the English, should they attempt to gain the Windward of them) they
found they had but three Fathom Water, so that several of the Fleet struck
upon the Sands, but had no other harm, which caused them to stand off again,
and to make directly toward the Enemy, endeavoring to engage them to a Fight:
But the Hollander being unwilling to engage, all that day past in slight
Skirmishes only, toward Evening the Hollanders changed their Station, but
kept themselves off from the English toward the Flats, making a show of being
desisirous to fight: But the next Morning by break of day, the English Fleet
perceiving that the Hollanders were gone about two Leagues Northward from them,
they resolved although they had but very little Wind, and that various to make
up toward them, which they endeavored all the Morning, but could not reach
them, the Wind being come North, inclined to the West: However the best Sailing
Frigates were commanded to make after them, and to keep them in play till the
rest of the Fleet could get up to them, and about three in the Afternoon, the
said Frigates with much ado got within shot of them, but the Hollander fearing
least by degrees they might be drawn to a general Combat (as it indeed was the
English's, Design) hoyst up their maine Top-sailes, and fairly run away:
Notwithstanding which, ten good Frigates gave the Chase, till ten at Night, and
the next Morning by the favor of a fresh Gale from the Southwest, the whole
Fleet pursued them till they came to West Cappell in Zeland, when as they put
into Gore, the English would feign have fallen on and fought them in their own
Ports, but a Council of War being called, it was judged unfitting to pursue
them any further upon their own Coasts, by reason of the Flats, and also by
reason that the English Provisions began to fall short: The Hollana^ers loss in
this Encounter is not well known, that which was visible was, that three of
their Ships were disembled from fighting, the one having her Mainmast shot
down, and the Mizen-mast, Bowsprits, Stays and Tackling of the other two; the
Admiral of their Rear Squadron was reduced to so ill a plight, as being not
able to make any way of her self, they were constrained to tow her a long by a
Hoy of two and thirty great Guns, which advanced but slowly forward: so that
the Nonesuch Frigate boarded her, and having put thirty men over into each
Vessel, they mastered them, but finding that they were extreme leakie, and
began to sinck, they took eighty men out of them, and their Officers, the Rear
Admiral, and the Captain, and left the Hulks to serve the dead men for a
Coffin: The English had but forty men killed, and as many hurt. Now the fame of
this notable War between these two Queenly and Mistress Commonwealths of the
Navigation, having spread it self throughout the Universe in all places where
Trade and Commerce is used; The effects thereof appeared shortly after in the
Mediterranian Seas, as well as in the Ocean and in the English Channel: Some
Frights were sent toward the Levant, to guard the English Merchant Men from
the French Shipping of Marselleis, and Toulon, a Squadron of which Frigates
consisting only in four Sail of Ships, viz. The Paragon, the Phoenix, the
Constant Warwick, and the Elizabeth, convoying three Merchant Men, two of which
had taken in their Lading at Scandaroon, and the other at Smyrna, were
encountered by eleven Holland Men of War, who made up toward them, and set upon
them; All that the English could at first do, was to return their broad Sides
on their Poopes, to let them see that they were not afraid of their exceeding
them in number, but ere the fight was well begun, the Night separated them, and
the next Morning the Hollanders began the fight again, and were received as
briskly, as if they had been equally matched. The Masts and Yards of two of
their Ships were quickly shot down, and another was set on fire, but quickly
recovered; The Phoenix a gallant Frigate of five and forty Guns was boarded by a
huge States Ship, and after a mavelous defense lost almost all her Men (and
being over powerd) was forced to yield, but not without a great loss on the
Hollanders side; Nor did the English quit the fight till all their Men and
Ammunition were killed and spent: The Paragon lost seven and twenty Men, and
had sixty wounded, the Elizabeth had but two Barrels of Powder left; However
they disengaged themselves from so great a number of their Enemies, and put
their Merchantmen safe in Porto-longone; So that the Hollander had not much to
brag of in the fight which happened near Corsica. Much about this time an
Ambassador from the Queen of Sweden; Two Ambassadors arrive in England.
but before he had made the least overture of Business, he dyed: Another
Ambassador arrived from the King of Denmark, but finding that it was impossible
to reconcile the differences betwixt the two Commonwealths, he withdrew again
and went his ways, by reason of the common Interest of the Danes, and the
united Provinces: And the Parliament having notice that the Hollanders who
blocked up the passage of the Sound, had constrained two and twenty English
Merchants coming from the Eastern Parts toward England, to put themselves
under the King of Denmarks protection, ordered eighteen Sail of Ships to go to
fetch them home, the rather because they were Laden with such Merchandises, as
were at that time very useful for the State, and without which the War
against the Hollanders could not be prosecuted nor continued.

Several passages between the English and the Danes.
On the nineteenth of September, the Fleet set sail from Yarmouth, and the next
Morning they came to Anchor within two Leagues of the Castle of Essenhoeur, in
Denmark, whence the Commander in chief sent away the Greyhound Frigate, with a
Letter directed to the Governor of the Castle, and another to the Admiral of
Denmark, by which he desired them to inform the King of Denmark of their
arrival, and of the Subject thereof, whereunto he added a third Letter,
directed to the Masters of the English Ships, ordering them to make their
Addresses to the King of Denmark, and to procure liberty from him that their
Ships might with all speed be suffered to come out of the (...) of Copenhagen,
where they as then lay: But the Frigate was not suffered to approach nearer then
within a League of the Castle, whence she returned again. The next Morning the
Commander in Chief himself went thither in his long Boat, and declared the
Subject of his Arrival, and delivered his Letters, but no Answer was returned
unto him, which obliged him the second time to send to the King, and to the
English Merchants, but without success, for the King was not to be heard of,
nor seen, nor to be spoken with; at length two Lords sent from the King of
Denmark, came to Elsenore Castle, whither also the Captains of the English
Fleet went, who vigorously pressed the Restitution of their Merchantmen: But
in answer to this their Demand they were interrogated; Wherefore their
Ambassador had not been admitted to Hearing at his being in England? wherefore
they came so boldly into his Majesty's Seas, and so near to his place of
Residence, and of his Castles, with so strong a Fleet, before they had given
notice thereof three weeks before?

But the English not standing to Canvasle these Demands, save only to procure
satisfaction on their Pretenses, pressed to have a positive Answer returned
thereunto: Whereupon on the seven and twentieth of the said Month they
received a Letter from the King of Denmark, telling them, That he would
preserve the said Ships for the Merchants, as carefully as he had hitherto
done, but that he would not deliver them into their hands. Whereupon the
English Merchants, and the Masters and Seamen, seeing there was no hopes to
get their Ships released, abandoned them, and came aboard of the Fleet, and
straightway quitting the Sound, made over again toward England, but in the
Night of the following Day, which was the last of the Month, the VVeather
proved so dark, that the Admiral Ship Commanded by Captain Ball, The Antelope
Frigate lost.
steering too much toward the shore, run on ground upon the Coast of that
Sand, where she was lost, only all the Ships Company was saved, and it was ten
to one that the whole Fleet had not followed her, she bearing the Lantern:
she was an excellent Frigate, called the Antelop, carrying fifty brass Gunnes.
But this Loss was presently after repaired by 20 Holland Barques, and 2 Men of
War taken.
taking of about twenty Holland Barques, and one Convoy Man of War, as also
one other Ship carrying twenty Gunnes, and thus without any other Loss, or
adventure, they returned into England, and on the fifteenth of October, they
came to an Anchor in Burlington Bay, within a little while after Master Bra^haw
was deputed in the quality of an Envoy, or Deputy toward the King of Denmark,
to try whether the Restitution of those Merchants Vessels might not be procured
in an amicable way, but this Attempt proved as bootlesse as the former; For the
said Ships were not only detained, but their Lading was carried on Shore and
Sold: Which Acts of Hostility committed against the Law of Nations and of
Hospitality to innocent Persons, and against a State which had desired their
Amity, by all ways and means possible, will sooner, orlater meet with their
Reward and Punishment, either by the hands of those who were endamaged, or by
some others, which by the sequel you will find proved so.

But to return again to the Hollander, who were almost enraged at their
continual Losses of their Ships, with which all the Havens in England were
filled, and being resolved to be revenged for so many Another Sea Fight betwixt
the English and the Hollander, in December.
Sea Fights as they had lost, busied themselves in setting forth a great Fleet,
and notwithstanding the rigor of the Season in the very midst of Winter, they
came to Sea with a Fleet of ninety Sail, and ten Fireships; and on the
twentieth of December, they appeared on the back of the Goodwins, the English
Fleet under General Blakes Command, consisted but in two and forty Ships, ill
furnished, wanting Men, and all other Necessaries: The greatest part of the
best Ships having been rendered incapable of going forth to Sea; whereas there
was the greatest occasion to make use of them, which happened either by the
negligence, or rather by the perfideousness, and treachery, and set Malice of
some, who at that time had the management of the Sea Affairs, being over
jealous that the Military Persons and Men of Action, should grow too high and
overtop them; although afterward God in his own time found out these men, and
caused them to give an account of these their pernicious averseness to the
public Good of the Commonwealth, and to the private interests of the
particular Members thereof. Hour the English, notwithstandsting the Inequality
of their Forces, resolved to Launch out and fight them so that on the thirtieth
of December being a very fair day, both Fleets steering Westward, encountered
each other about eleven of the Clock in the Morning, and began the Fight, the
English having the upper hand of the Wind; of two and forty English Ships, not
one half of them engaged in the fight for want of men, insomuch, that twenty,
or two and twenty Ships bare the brunt of the puissant Holland Fleet. The Avaunt
guard, and the Victory, two brave, Frigates, having been the whole day engaged
in the midst of the Enemy, firing from all sides, got off in a very good
Condition: But toward the Evening, the Garland, carrying about forty pieces of
Cannon, was boorded at once by two great Dutch Ships, which she manfully
resisted, till her Decks were quite unfurnished of men, which having blown up,
and finally being over powered on all sides, was forced to yield. The
Bonaventure being a Merchant-man, but a, good Vessel going to relieve the
Garland, was clapped aboard by a Man of War, and after she had several times
cleared her Decks of the Enemy, which were gotten into her, at length by the
death of her Captain, who behaved himself stoutly, she lost both Strength and
Courage, and so fell into the hands of her Enemies.

Meanwhile, General Blake, who Commanded the Triumph, seeing this Disorder,
plunged into the thickest of his Enemies to rescue the Garland, had his
Foremast shot down close by the Board, and was Clapped on Board by the Enemy,
but having stoutly defended himself, and several times beaten them off
again, he at length got clear of them, and went off with the rest of his
Fleet, only with the loss of two Ships, which cost the Dutch dear enough,
before they got them: and after the fight two English Merchantmen falling
casually into the Hollanders hands, helped to make up the Friutes of this their
great boasted of Victory over the English, which being in it self but a small
Check, served only to whet the Valor of the English, and to edge them on with
the more vehemence to dissipate that Eclipse which had so lately over Clouded
their wonted Glory; Wherefore they made a very considerable Sea Equipage, and
fitted out with all speed a brave Fleet of the best and gallantest Ships, as
well to bring down their Enemies Pride, who were devoid of all Moderation,
after this their pretended Success, as to stop and silence the Murmurings and
Clamor of the People, against those who at that time held and guided the
Reins of the State; some of which behaved themselves so untoward, that it
could not be imagined, save that by a base and vile black policy they
intended, together with the Ruin of Maratine Affairs, to bring Destruction
upon the whole LAND.

THE HISTORY OF OLIVER Lord Protector, From his Cradle to his Tomb.
HIs Highness at that time being General, was as it were seized with a kind of
horror, by the very sense of these disorders, which could not be excused
either by reason of the disabillity of the Country, of any misfortunes, or ill
accidents, nor by any imprudence, but were manifestly committed out of mere
malice, through a blind zealous ambition, His great soul did even reproach him
inwardly for letting the honor of his Country (as it were) fall to the
ground; and that a Million of brave Merchants were suffered to run into
perdition, by default of a discreet Pilot to steer at the Helm, which was so
ill guided; and although the Sea-affairs did not properly concern him, He
conceived however, that in case during the General Shipwreck, he launched into
the Main with some small Barks to save the grand Vessel and body of the State
which was perishing, he might do both a beneficial, commendable, and
praiseworthy work. He therefore believed that in Honor and Conscience he was
bound to dive more narrowly into the secret of the Affairs, and to employ the
keenness of his Sword to set an edge upon the subtle Cabinet pens, and mend
their bluntness and dullness: so that after the most requisite Orders for the
arming and equipying of the Fleet had been issued out, he hammered out some
others, for the better encouragement of the Seamen in general, as well
Commanders and Soldiers, as Mariners. In reference whereunto it was ordered,

1. That some musters should be advanced them, to put themselves in a fit
equipage to go to Sea, and to leave a subsistence with theit families during
their absence. 2. That for every ship which was adjudged good prize in the
Admiralty, they should have two pounds per Ton, and six pounds for every piece
of Canon, Brass, or Iron, as should be found in the said Vessels, and the which
should be equally distributed amongst them in relation to the Offices they bear
in the Ship which had taken the said prize. 3. That they should have ten pound
for every piece of Cannon on board of such Ships as they should sink, or
destroy by firing, or otherwise. 4. That those who should enroll themselves
before the forty days should be expired, should receive a months pay as a
gratuity which should not be put to account. 5 That Hospitalls should be
erected at Dover, Deal, and Sandwich, for such sick and wounded Men as should
be brought on shore; and that a Stock should be settled for their maintenance,
as also for the subsistence of such other sick and wounded men, as by reason of
their Diseases and Wounds could not be brought on shore, or should be too far
from Hospitals.
Diverse other Ordinances of the like nature were also settled, which did
wonderfully encourage the Seamen and Mariners; so that toward the latter end
of February; 1653. the English put forth a puissant Fleet to Sea, frighted with
gallant men, who were resolved to fight it out, although at that time the
Hollanders had made use of their best wits and stratagems, and had negotiated
almost with all the Nations of Europe, to hinder the bringing into England any
Pitch, Tarr, Masts, and such other necessaries for the Navigation.

This brave Fleet being in a longing desire to encounter their enemies; on the
eighteenth of February about eight in the morning, descryed eighty Holland men
of War conveying one hundred and fifty Merchantmen coming from Bordeaux,
Nants, Roan, and other parts of France; A Fight between the English and the
Hollander, near the Isle of Wight and Portland.
and just between the Isle of Wight and Portland, the foremost Frigots of the
English Fleet, to wit, General Blake in the Triumph, followed by General Dean,
and three or four others, began the fight; the rest of the English Fleet being
toward the Coast, was not able to get up; insomuch, that from eight in the
morning till two in the afternoon, this small squadron of General Blakes was
enforced to stand out the brunt of above thirty of the enemies ships, with
which they incessantly fought, and demeaned themselves gallantly; till at
length about two in the afternoon, as aforesaid, half of the Fleet got up to
them, and began the fight for good and all, which ceased not but with the dark
night. The English lost the Sampson, a Ship which they had formerly taken from
the Hollanders, and by reason she was quite shattered in pieces, they sunk her
themselves after they had taken the men out of her; however she cost the
Hollanders dear, for she sunk the Sip which had so evilly entreated her. On the
ninteenth of February, the English again made up toward the Enemy, and gave
them Chase for a long while together, and forced some of their Ships upon the
Sands where they destroyed them. The day following, the English again assaulted
the Hollanders, and the fight became more obstinate then on the two days
before; but at length the Enemies having their bellies full, began to fire out
of their Sterns, and like unto the Parthians to make a running fight of it;
when as all their Merchantmen being not able to follow them, they became unto
the English like unto so many Golden apples which stopped their pursuit of the
Enemy. Toward the evening they came toward the height of Bullen, but the
wind coming North, North-East, and consequently not fit to regain their own
Coast, their sails and tackling being pretty well disordered, they resolved to
come to an Anchor. The English in this fight took about fifty Merchantmen and
nine men of War, they sunk several besides those the Enemies themselves sunk to
save their men; their Ships having been sorely shattered upon the Coast of
France; there were above two thousand of their dead bodies found floating, and
there were above fifteen hundred Prisoners brought up to London. General Blake
was hurt in this encounter, having done as much as could be expected from a
gallant Seaman; and likewise several of his Officers and persons of Mark, who
behaved themselves courageously, were both hurt and killed on this occasion. It
is hard justly to describe the loss which the Hollanders sustained in this
burnt, by reason that parties frequently endeavor to silence their disgraces,
and that the Sea does usually better swallow up and hide the events and effects
of such bloody Sea Fights then the Land. The Hollander by this prodigious and
vast loss, being touched to the quick, did send a Letter to the Parliament, to
endeavor to mediate a means to terminate these Differences, but the said
letter being signed only by States of Holland and West Freizland, the
Parliament made answer unto by a letter, witnessing their earnest desires to
accommodate things in an amicable way, and so to stop the current of so bloody
a War, but the said Negotiation produced not the expected effect.

Mean time Fortune, which is as unconstant as the Sea it self, found out a way
to produce the effects of her unstabillity better on this Element then on the
Land; and this Goddess being thus exasperated at the constant prosperity of the
English, would let them see that she had as great an advantage over their
valor at Sea, as their Valor had over her in their Land fights: Wherefore to
bereave them of her Land-aids, she surprizeth them in foreign Seas, and causes
them to seel one of her back-blows when they least of all expected it.
Wherefore the English having by a stratagem recovered again the The Phoenix
regained.
Phoenix Frigot from the Hollanders; as she lay at an Anchor in the Mole of
Leagorne, disposed themselves to a second encounter with the Hollanders in
those Seas.

A second Sea Fight in the Levant between the English and the Dutch.
Captain Badiley with nine men of War set sail from Porto-Longone, to deliver
and free certain Frigots Commanded by Captain Appleton, which were by twenty
two Holland men of War cooped up in the Mole of Legorne, and had been detained
in the like manner for several Months; the mischance was, that both these
Squadrons could not come to fight the Hollanders at one and the self same time,
for Captain Appleton and his Ships setting sail out of the said Mole sooner
then they should have done, were immediately surrounded by the whole Holland
Fleet, who being more in number, had also the advantage of the wind. The Dutch
Admiral seconded by two other great Ships, fell upon the Leopard a smug Frigate,
carrying fifty piece of Cannon, who for the space of five hours together
maintained a stout fight against all the said Ships, whereas being over-powred
by the number of their men, she fell into the Enemies hands; and a
Cannon-bullet having unhappily fired the Bonaventure's powder, occasioned the
loss of her without Labor or Valor to the Enemy, for she was blown up; a
loss which otherwise would have cost them dear. The Pilgrim having sustained
the brunt of four or five Holland Ships for a long while together had her Main
and Mizen-Masts both shot down, and so was taken, being over-powred with
numbers which she was not able to resist.

The Levant-Merchant, another English Frigot, maintained a long fight against a
great Holland Ship of thirty six Guns, and being just on the brink of obtaining
the Victory over her Enemy, (whom she sunk downright a little after) was set
upon a new by a fresh Ship as big as the former, with whom she fought two
hours, and having lost all her men, was at length; taken. The Sampson on the
one side being assaulted by young Van-Trump, who commanded the Admiral of the
Rere-Guard, and on the other side by a Fire-ship, was soon set on fire, and
midst of the flames met with a Tomb which had some conformity to the noble heat
with the which its company was animated. Thus you have a relation of the
greatest misfortune which befell the English during the continuance of his
whole War, and which was the more to be lamented, that it happened within sight
of nine of their own Ships, commanded by Captain Badiley, who could not with
all his endeavors come up to join with them, but who was nevertheless so happy
and so prudent as to save his squadron, after he had done the best to relieve
his companions, and had seen that the disaster was not to be remedied.

But let us for a while quit the Sea, and take a view of some Land passages,
and see in what a posture the Affairs of great Britain are with the
neighboring States.

It is a thing worthy of observation and admiration both together, that our
Protectors Ancestors did always bear this Motto in their Arms, Pax quoeritur
Bello: which seems only to belong to Sovereign Princes, as if by a
prophetical chance, or else rather by a Divine Providence, this Family, which
as it seems was designed to bear the Scepter, and to restore and give peace
unto England after so bloody a Civil War, and so many other foreign broyls,
had received this glorious Motto as an earnest of its future Grandeur; which
said Motto does in substance contain all the mystery of the Politics, and
comprehend the two powers which God does give to those whom he establishes his
Lievetenants upon Earth. In effect, we may observe that peace which seemed to
have embraced our incomparable Oliver, and as it were to have been incorporated
with him, has ever since grown up with him, until such time as its powerful
branches, which increased and grew up to an infinite height, had spread it felf
so far, as that this dutiful Daughter of Heaven whose growth is limited by
God, being not able to follow him no longer, was constrained only to fix her
self to the body of the tree, and to suffer the branches to extend themselves
to the other sides of the Seacoasts, for to deprive that Nation of Peace which
does least deserve it, having extended the War and her Tyrannies throughout all
the inhabitable parts of the World. For as soon as his late Highness, our dread
Protector, had attained to the power (by the means and force of Arms) in
England, Scotland, and Ireland, Peace immediately brake forth, and
resplendently shown throughout all those parts, and stopped those floods of Blood
which could never have been stanched, but by the greatest branches of our
illustrious Oliver: and not sooner had his Voice a transcendency in and over
the Councels, but Peace continually accompanied his Oracles. Do but with me
track the course of his fortunes, and you will find that bright Astrea does
follow, or rather does conduct and lead by the hand this blessed Deity, and
chains her up to the triumphal Chariot, there to humble her and to make her
know, that this our Oliver was not the work of her hands, but rather of her
own, since it is the end which does always Crown glorious and magnanimous
Actions. Now whereas the last Victory which General Blake obtained at Sea, had
gained a great stock of credit unto his late Highness, both at home and abroad;
the whole English Nation began to witness a desire that he would undertake the
Management of Affairs, and put himself at the Helm of the Government; and
likewise all Strangers and Foreigners endeavored to be in a good
understanding with England. A Portugal Ambassador obtains Peace.
The King of Portugal sent an extraordinary Ambassador over into England, with
a gallant retinue, the stateliness whereof savoured of the profusion of Peace,
which was also immediately granted them on very advantageous Conditions for
England.

And almost at the same time, two deputations were admitted from France, which
Kingdom was again for the second time unfortunately divided by a Civil War.
French Deputations sent to England.
The French King by his Deputy demanded the restitution of those Ships which
had been taken by the English, as they were going to the relief of Dunkirk; and
on the other part, the Prince of Conde sent a Deputy from Bordeaux (besieged by
the King) to demand relief; but all the Civility England could show either of
them at that time, was, not to assent at all to their demands, and by that
means remove all occasions of jealousy from each party: besides that business
being too much exasperated between England and France, there could not so
sudden an occomodation be expected; and as to the Bourdelois, all men know
those French Quarrels are as short as violent.

Deputations concerning a peace with Holland.
In like manner, several other foreign Princes and States sent over Deputations
into England, to endeavor to moderate a Peace between this Commonwealth and
the Hollanders, as amongst the rest, the Queen of Sweeden; The Cantons of
Switzes, the Imperial Hansiatick Towns of Hamborough and Lubeck: But at that
time there was such a combustion in the mind of the English, who were at
variance amongst themselves, as that there was no appearance of thinking of any
peace with strangers and foreigners. Affairs being therefore thus embroyled at
home, his late Highness, as then General, seeing that in the Parliament, the
particular Interests overswayed the public Good, and that it was aparent, all
their drifts tended but to establish themselves into a perpetual Senate,
contrary to the ancient Customs and Liberties of England, which require that
Parliaments should have their successions, and should only be convocated from
time to time; and that therefore the members of the house wiredrawed Affairs by
unnecessary Centestations, which only served to publish the designs, and to
retard the execution of them. This our General, I say, who was designed by the
Divine Providence to establish peace and tranquillity in England upon surer,
more sollid, and more glorious Foundations, entered the Parliament House,
accompanied by the Chief Officers of the Army, and briefly represented unto
them the Reasons why the Parliament ought to be dissolved; which was also
accordingly done. The ^ong Parliament dissolved.
The Speaker with the rest of the Members immediately departing the House; some
by force, some through fear, and others not without a great deal of reluctance
and murmuring. No one living soul was aggrieved at this action, neither was it
so much as endeavored to be questioned or redressed by any one, all the world
believing, that in case the said change should bring no good with it, at least
it would not put Affairs in a worse predicament then they were: so that the
sovereign Senate was dissolved, as you have heard, and the power thereof was
transferred into the hands of those who better deserved it, since they acquired
it by the points of their Swords; and that they have since made appear, that
they knew how to use it with more prudence and moderation. Nay, the
Parliament Men were even made so cheap unto the people, that they became their
reproach and obliquie, and so were a consolation to the unfortunate, who saw
themselves revenged on them by those from whom they had least cause to suspect
or expect it. There was not so much as the least questioning nor censuring of
the cause of this revolution, but every one found it expedient according unto
the several satisfactions which he thereby received or hoped for; and as the
Army was only looked upon as Soldiers of fortune, whom the necessity of the
Affairs, or the dangerous conjuncture of the times had enforced to take up
Arms, so that which was past and gone was not laid to their charge; and the
world could not choose but applaud them for what happened at present, but
expect from them for the future that generosity which the Millitary profession
does inspire into great courages, as to this very day all men do enjoy, and are
sensible of the favorable effects which have since been produced. However, the
universal joy which was so evidently to be seen in all their countenances did
not hinder, but that it was thought fitting for the better satisfaction of the
generality, and of all men in particular, to publish the causes, the grounds
and reasons of the dissolving of the Parliament, which was accordingly ordered
by the General and by his Council, consisting of the chief Officers of the
Army, and was manifested accordingly in a Declaration, whereof the following
are the chief Heads.

The Lord General Cromwell and his Counsels Manifest for the dissolving the
Parliament.
That after God was pleased marvellously to appear for his people, in reducing
Ireland and Scotland to so great a degree of peace, and England to perfect
quiet, whereby the Parliament had opportunity to give the people the harvest of
all their Labor, Blood, and Treasure, and to settle a due liberty in reference
to Civil and Spiritual things, whereunto they were obliged by their duty,
engagements, and those great and wonderful things God had wrought for them; But
they made so little progress, that it was matter of much grief to the good
people of the Land, who thereupon applied themselves to the Army, expecting
redress by their means; who though unwilling to meddle with the Civil
Authority, agreed that such Officers as were members of Parliament, should move
them to proceed vigorously in reforming what was amiss in the Commonwealth,
and in settling it upon a Foundation of Justice and Righteousness; which being
done, it was hoped the Parliament would have answered their expectations. But
finding the contrary, they renewed their desires by an humble Petition in
August, 1652. which produced no considerable effect, nor was any such progress
made therein, as might employ their real intentions to accomplish what was
petitioned for; but rather in aversness to the things themselves, with much
bitterness and aversion to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them,
insomuch that the Godly party in the Army were rendered of no other use then to
countenance the ends of a corrupt party for effecting their desires, in
perpetuating themselves in the supreme Government. For the obviating of these
evils, the Officers of the Army obtained several meetings with some of the
Parliament, to consider what remedy might be applied to prevent the same; but
such endeavors proving ineffectual, it became evident that the Parliament
through the corruption of some, the jealousy of others, and the non-attendance
of many, would never answer those ends which God, his People, and the whole
Nation expected from them; But that this Cause which God had so greatly
blessed, must need languish under their hands, and by degrees be lost; and the
Lives, Liberties, and Comforts of his people be delivered into their Enemies
hands: all which being sadly and seriously considered by the honest people of
the Nation, as well as by the Army, it seemed a duty incumbent upon us who had
seen so much of the power and presence of God, to consider of some (...) means
whereby to establish Righteousness and Peace in these Nations. And after much
debate it was judged necessary, That the supreme Government should be by the
Parliament devolved upon known persons, fearing God, and of approved integrity,
for a time, as the most hopeful way to countenance all Gods people, reform the
Law, and administer Justice impartially, hoping thereby the people might forget
Monarchy, and understand their true interest in the election of successive
Parliaments; that so the Government might be settled upon a Right Basis, without
hazard to this glorious Cause, or necessitating to keep up Armies for the
defense of the same. And being still resolved to use all means possible to
avoid extraordinary courses, we prevailed with about twenty Members of
Parliament to give us a Conference, with whom we plainly debated the necessity
and justness of our proposals; the which found no acceptance, but instead
thereof, it was offered, that the way was to continue still this Parliament, as
being that from which we probably might expect all good things. This being
vehemently insisted on, did much confirm us in our apprehensions, that any
love to a Representative, but the making use thereof to recrute and so to
perpetuate themselves, was their aim in the Act they had then under
consideration. For preventing the consumating whereof, and all the sad and evil
consequences which upon the grounds aforesaid must have ensued, and whereby at
one blow the interest of all honest men, and of this glorious cause had been
endangered to be laid in the dust, and these Nations embroiled in new troubles,
at a time when our Enemies abroad are watching all advantages against, and some
of them actually engaged in War with us, we have been necessitated (though with
much repugnancy) to put an end to this Parliament. This Declaration and these
proceedings of his late Highness, then General, and of his Council of Officers
of the Army, were backed by the consent of the Generals at Sea, and by all the
Captains of the Fleet, and in like manner by all the other Generals and
Officers of the Land forces, both in Scotland, Ireland, and the other
Territories.

But least the Magistrates and other public Ministers of Justice and Policy,
suprized at this sudden change, should chance to swerve from their duties; or
that other persons should thereby take occasion to foment disturbances
prejudicial to the Commonwealth, this ensuing Declaration was published. A
Declaration for settling a Council of State.
Whereas the Parliament being dissolved, persons of approved fidelity and
honesty are, according to the late Declaration of the two and twentieth of
April last past, to be called from the several parts of this Commonwealth to
the supreme authority; and although effectual proceedings are, and have been
had for perfecting those resolutions, yet some convenient time being required
for the assembling of those persons, It has been found necessary for
preventing the mischiefs and inconveniences which may arise in the mean while
to the public Affairs, that a Council of State be constituted to take care of,
and intend the peace, safety, and present management of the Affairs of this
Commonwealth; which being settled accordingly, the same is hereby declared and
published, to the end that all persons may take notice thereof, and in their
several places and stations, demean themselves peaceably, giving obedience to
the Laws of the Nation as heretofore, in the exercise and administration
whereof, as endeavors shall be used. That no oppression or wrong be done to
the people, so a strict account will be required of all such as shall do any
thing to endanger the public peace and quiet upon any presence whatsoever.
Dated April the thirtieth 1653. subscribed Oliver Cromwell.

These domestic revolutions did in a manner put a new life into the Dutch
again, who thought that they would cause some eminent distractions and
disturbances as well on the Seas as by Land. But they were very much deceived,
for the Maratine Affairs of these Lands, on which either the good or bad
fortune of England depended, were carried on with so much dexterity, diligence,
and vigor, as that they had reason to confess, that the change of the Pilot,
and the entire obedience which is rendered to an absolute Captain, who has the
sole power in his hands, are but ill signs that the Vessel should be therefore
the worse guided and conducted. And to give you a proof of the truth, the
Hollanders having at that time a vast number of Merchantmen in their Harbors
ready to set Sail, durst not hazard them through the Channel, although they had
a Fleet of ninety Men of War to conduct them. But conducted them by North of
Scotland to reach the Sound, where they met with another great Fleet of their
Merchantmen, some coming from Russia, some from the East Indies, and others
from France, all which they carried home into Holland; after which, hearing
that the English Fleet was steered Northward, instead of seeking them out, and
to take the advantage of the English divisions, as they had pretended and
bragged, they amuzed themselves in making several bravadoes in such places
where there was neither honor, glory, nor benefit to be acquired: at length
they steered toward the Downs where they carried away two or three despicable
Barks, and sent some volleys of Cannon into Dover, their Hearts and their Sails
being equally puffed up with these imaginary successes, which savouring
something of their old Masters Jack Spaniards Rodomontado's, they thought they
could not better express them then at that time, saying, That the English Fleet
was to be cried out by the sound of Trumpets and Horns, as if she had been
lost. But the Wind being as unconstant as the Sea it self, and as dangerous,
quickly tacked about to their confusion, and the Old Proverb, That all the evil
comes from the North, was made good to their cost and charges.

For the English Fleet returning on a sudden from the Northward, on the twenty
eighth of May came into Yarmouth-Road, and on the first of June next ensuing,
being at an Anchor, they discovered two Dutch Galliots, to which they gave
chase till they came up to the body of the Dutch Fleet. A Fight between the
English and the Dutch on the North Foreland.
But the weather proving overcovered and dusky, they could not join with them.
On the third, the English being at Anchor near unto the South-point of the
Gober, descryed the Enemy about two Leagues to Leeward of them, being about one
hundred Sail of Ships, wherefore without loss of time the English weighed, and
made up to them. The engagement began between eleven and twelve at noon, and
for some hours the fight was sharp until about six in the evening; the enemy
bare right way before the wind, and so ended that days fight. On the next
morning both Fleets came in sight of each other, but there was so little wind
stirring that they could not engage each other till twelve at noon; The Dutch
worsted and many Ships taken.
when as they fell to it again for good and all, and after four hours fight,
which proved very disadvantagious to the Hollanders, they thought it not
fitting to contest any longer, but to get away as well as they could; However a
fresh westerly gale arising very opportunely, the English being encouraged by
their flight, bare in so hard amongst them, that they took eleven Men of War
and two water Hoyes: in which fight one thousand five hundred prisoners were
taken, and six Captains, besides which, six Holland Men of War were sunk, and
all the rest of the Dutch Fleet had according to all probability been cut off,
had not the night happily closed in for them. But the darkness growing on, and
the English finding themselves near the Flats, and necessitated to stay and
mend their Sails and Rigging, which were much shattered and torn, about ten at
night they came to an Anchor. The greatest loss the English sustained was of
General Dean one of their Admirals, who was taken off by a great shot in the
first days engagement, and whose death did sufficiently recompense all the
Enemies loss; he having been a person of reputed Valor and great experience,
besides which, there was one Captain slain, and about one hundred and fifty
men, and two hundred and forty hurt, but not one of the English Ships were
lost. That which greatly encouraged the English and disheartened the Dutch, was
the arival of General Blake to their aid and succor with sixteen good Men of
War very opportunely. Now the Dutch by the favor of the night being gotten
off, and having retired themselves into the Weilings, the (...), and the Texel,
the English called a Council of all the Officers, to advise on, what would be
most expedient to be undertaken to improve this Victory to the best advantage;
and it was resolved, to advance with the whole Fleet as fast as they could to
the Weilings as far as they could possibly approach with safety, by reason of
the Flats and Shelves, and in this wise forage the whole Dutch Coasts till
they came to Texel: which being accordingly performed, and being arrived at the
said height, they there remained a pretty while, taking every day some prizes
more or less, to the great prejudice The Hollanders pursued and blocked up in
their own Ports.
of the Dutch, whose Ships could neither get in or out of any of their Ports, as
long as the English continued there: Nor could their Men of War unite and come
to a head to make a body to come forth. Wherefore leaving them to take breath,
and to recollect their spirits again, and so to think of the best means for
their Deliverance, we will return for England again with our Fleet and see how
squares stands there.

General Cromwell who always made use of more moderation then power in the Rise
of his Fortune, being unwilling to deprive England of her ancient Liberties and
Privileges, resolved together with the chief Officers of his Army to assemble
a Parliament. A Parliament called by General Cromwell.
To invest them with the power of administering and exercising the Laws, and to
appoint them as it were Judges of his Council and Government. And the Warrants
requisite thereunto were issued out unto such persons as through England,
Scotland, and Ireland, were chosen by himself and his Council, to assist in the
said Parliament, for them to meet in the Councel-Room at White Hall on the
fourth day of the month of July, in the year of our Lord. 1653. A form of
which said Warrant you have, as follows, viz.

For as much as upon the dissolution of the late Parliament, it became necessary
that the Peace, Safety, and good Government of this Commonwealth should be
provided for; and in Order thereunto, diverse persons fearing God, and of
approved sidelity and honesty, are by my self, with the advice of my Council of
Officers, nominated, to whom the great charge and trust of so weighty Affairs
is to be Committed. And having good assurance of the love to, and courage for
God, and the interest of his Cause, and the good people of this Commonwealth, I
Oliver Cromwell, Captain General, and Commander in chief of all the Army and
Forces raised and to be raised within this Commonwealth, do hereby Summon and
Require you (being of the persons nominated) personally to be and appear at the
Councel-Chamber, commonly called or known by the name of the Councel-Chamber at
White Hall, within the City of Westminster upon the fourth day of July next
ensuing the date hereof; then and there to take upon you the said trust to
which you are hereby called and appointed to serve as a member for the County
of (...), and hereof you are not to fail.

Given under my hand and seal the day of (...) July, 1653. subscribed Oliver
Cromwell.

And in conformity to this Convocation, the nominated for every County did
accordingly meet on the fourth of July in the Council Chamber, where the Lord
General Cromwell, being accompanied with the greatest part of the Officers of
the Army, delivered himself to the laid members in an excellent Speech; in
which, his Prudence, Valor, and Piety, were at once manifested; but chiefly
his passionate tenderness for the good of the Commonwealth in General, and for
the peace and tranquillity of each member in particular: so that we may justly
attribute unto him the qualities both of a Caesar, and of a Moses, by reason of
his elegant Speech which he prosecuted in this manner.

The Generals Speech to the Members.
By recounting the many wonderful Mercies of God toward this Nation, and the
continued Series of Providence by which he had appeared, in carrying on his
Cause, and bringing Affairs to that present glorious condition wherein they
were. He likewise manifested the progress of Affairs since the famous Victory
at Worcester, as also the actings of the Army thereupon: After diverse
applications to the Parliament, and much waiting upon them, with the Grounds
and necessities of their dissolving the last Parliament, which he declared to
be for the preservation of this Cause, and the Interest of all honest men who
had been engaged therein.

In like manner, he set forth the clearness of the Call given to the Members
then present, to take upon them the Supreme Authority; and from the Scriptures
exhorted them to their duties, and encouraged them therein. He further desired
them, that a tenderness might be used toward all conscientious persons of what
Judgment soever. Which said Speech was pronounced with such a grate tone, and
in such excellent manner, as it sufficiently manifested, that as he himself was
thoroughly persuaded thereof, the Spirit of God acted in and by him, he had
adorned it with no other eloquent phrase, save that of Holy Writ. The rest was
a masculine and convincing style, the comeliness whereof consisted in its
plainness, without any Rhethorical or Artificial words, but single and pure,
such as proceeded from our Saviors Ministers, the which begat the peace,
tranquillity, and glory of all men.

The Instrument of Government delivered to the Parliament.
The Lord Generals Speech being ended, he produced an Instrument under his own
Hand and Seal, whereby he did with the Advice of his Officers, devolve and
entrust the Supreme Authority and Government of this Commonwealth into the
Hands of the persons there met in the manner aforesaid; who, or any Forty of
them, were to be held and acknowledged the Supreme Authority of this Nation:
unto whom, all persons within the same, and the Territories thereunto
belonging, were to yield obedience and subjection. That they were to sit no
longer then the third of November, 1654. And that three months before their
dissolution, they were to make choice of other persons to succeed them, and
whose Powers and Sitting should not exceed twelve Months time; at the end of
which, they were likewise to take care for a succession in the Government.
Which said Instrument having been thus delivered unto them by the Lord General,
he did again exhort them to take the Business to heart, and to set nothing
before their eyes save the Glory of God, and the Good of Public Weal;
promising them, that on his part, he would neither spare his Goods, Life, nor
his Rest, to answer that great Mercy of God which he had shown them, in making
choice of them to follow those tracks which the Divine Providence had set
before them for their good, and for the glory and tranquillity of these Nations.
Finally, he recommended them to the Almighties protection, and so together with
his Officers withdrew, leaving them to take their places in the former
Parliament House, and to act accordingly; who forthwith named their Speaker,
and took their places, meeting in the House and sitting in due form.

John Lilburn demands Protection is denied and remitted to the Law.
Upon this change of Government, John Lilburne, the chief of the Levellers, of
whom mention was formerly made, and who had been banished the Land upon an Act
of the foregoing Parliament, thought to be protected by this, and cast himself
upon the Lord General; who being unwilling to interpose matters of that nature,
left him to the Law, whence he always freed himself by a most strong fatality
of Fortune.

And whilst this new Parliament is settling it self in England, let us look a
while back into Scotland and Ireland, and see how things have prospered there
since we left them. The state of Affairs in Scotland.
Now although the English were possessed of the best strong places and
Forteresses of all Scotland, and of all the Castles and Forts of value in the
Low-lands, yet however the High-landers who perceived their inaccessible
Fortresses, did make continual excursions on the Low-lands, being a people
hardy and laborious, faring hardly, used to the cold and rigorousness of those
Climates, as swift and nimble as Stags; and however they have more Valor then
Conduct, and more Temerity then Discipline, yet some of them chose to be
commanded by Glencarne, Athol, the Lord Seafort, and others; who framing
several small Bodies of them, would unexpectedly fall in upon, and surprise the
Inhabitants and English Soldiery, without either giving or taking quarter,
spoiling and murdering all that came in their way; and when the English would
make show to charge them, and to pursue them, in case they found themselves to
be the weaker, they then betook themselves to their heels with such swiftness,
and sheltering themselves in such unaccessible Rocks and Holds, that it was
impossible to pursue or light upon them: by which advantages they were
emboldned to commit several outrages, murders, and had like to have surprised
an English Ship which came to an anchor at Leevis Island, some of which ships
company going on shore to get in fresh water and provisions, were detained by
the Lord Seafort, who also sent a ridiculous Summons to the said ship for its
surrender, freighted with threats and detestations of the English Government,
although the said ship the Fortune, bearing more sails then their threats could
fill, laughed at their temerity, and got off at will.

The state of Affairs in Ireland.
Moreover, the state of Affairs in Ireland were much about the same predicament;
for the English having reduced all the strong Holds of that Country, and
having shipped away all those who had born Arms in the last Wars, to be
transported into Spain, France, Flanders, and other parts whither themselves
would go, those only excepted, who during the first Rebellion, had a hand in
the murdering of the Protestants, and who were brought up through all the
parts of the Country, were tried, condemned, and excuted in great numbers,
they drove the rest of the Irish into Cannaught, within the heart or center of
the Country; where they are cooped in by the English, who have possessed their
Lands, and have given them others in that Province to the value of them:
however, the English were continually molested by the Outlaws of that Nation,
the Tories, much like the Moss-Troopers, or Italian Bandittoes, but of late
they are pretty well calmed, and almost quite exterminated.

An admirable effect of his Highness Prudence and Justice
Mean while the continual Wars in Ireland, as well as the said Banishment and
Executions, having left above one half of Ireland almost as it were desert, and
left all the rest of the Couutrey as a prey to the Conqueror; hereupon his
late Highness made use of this occasion to give an evidence both of his Justice
and Prudence together. For whether the Exchequer at that time was bare of
Moneys or no, or whether this great Politician had wilfully deferred the paying
of the English Forces in Ireland till this very time, the better to settle the
English in those parts, he gave unto them those Lands which themselves had
conquered, in part of their payment; whereby he did according to the usual
saying, kill two birds with one stone, if not three; which is, that at the same
also he did recompense them with that which was far more worth then that which
was owing unto them, and a far more worth then that which was owing unto them,
and a far more solid thing, which was not to be easily taken from them; so that
part of the Irish Lands were allotted to pay the Soldiery, and at the same time
to establish and settle the Conquests of Ireland, by giving them a subsistence
to maintain and preserve them in those parts. As for the other part of the said
Lands, we must look back, how in the beginning of these Wars, the State being
not in a capacity to furnish sufficient moneys to defray the charges thereof,
was Constrained to borrow monyes of private persons on the promises of paying
them both Principal and Interest, as soon as the Conquests of Ireland should be
perfected; and however since that time the scene of Affairs was mightily
changed, that those who were engaged in this promise, and who at that time
governed the State, had no more power or might, and that his late Highness was
not in reason bound to subscribe or make good those Conditions or Articles on
which they received the said moneys, nor to heed the same at all; yet however
by a transcendent act of Justice he consented unto the disposal of the
remaining Lands toward the reinbursing of the Irish Adventurers, and by this
means made his Laurels become as fruitful as if they had been watered by the
sweat and labors of those people, and brought up at their costs and charges;
so that he both satisfied the Soldiers Arrears, and the Adventurers Advances
to their own content and hearts desires, and to his own praise and glory as
long as the memory of man lasts.

Continuance of the Dutch Affairs.
Mean while the Hollanders being quite tired by their continual losses, and
seeing that Fortune remained obstinate to their prejudice, and seldom or never
frowned on the English, resolved at length once more to come to a Treaty, and
to this purpose sent four Commissioners Holland Commissioners sent over to
treat.
into England, viz. the Lords, Beveringe, Newport, Yongstal, and Vanderperre,
which last no sooner arived here, but took leave of the world; so that the
other three pursued their Negotiation with hopes of a good success: yet however
these fair appearances did not produce either a cessation or a suspension of
Arms, but both parties treated and fought together, insomuch that all kind of
hostilies were exercised on both sides against each other; and as they seemed
both desirous to show the most of their powers, and that there was no necessity
at all of a peace, so they came at length to a notable fight even during the
Treaty, and the which did not a little conduce to hasten the Conclusion of the
peace. The manner of which fight was as follows.

A notable fight between the Dutch and English during the Treaty.
On the twenty ninth of July, two English Scouts, where abroad at Sea on
intelligence, discovered the Holland Fleet coming forth of the Wielings of
about ninety five sail, all men of War; and as soon as the English Fleet
received notice thereof, they made all the fail they possibly could toward
them, but the Enemies discrying our Fleet, witnessed a desire not as yet to
fight and so stood away. But by five of the clock that evening some of the
English Frigots getting up to them, engaged them into a Fight; and soon after,
thirty of our Ships seconding of them, began the Fight for good and all, and
were constrained to bear the brunt of the whole Holland Fleet, by reason the
rest of the English Fleet being asterne could not get up to engage. However
they were only separated by the night which forced both Fleets to retreat; and
the Fight although it was but short, yet it proved smart, and the Hollanders
had several of their Ships put out of a condition to serve, being so soarly
maimed, that they were forced to send them away in the night, by the favor
whereof they got by the English, and strove to join with a relief of five and
twenty good Ships which which were coming to the mouth of the Texel.

The Fight renewed.
On the morrow, the Hollanders being encouraged by their new recruits which they
had joined with the night before, by reason of the thick and fowl weather which
hindered the English from debarring them thereof, fell first of all upon the
English Fleet with a great deal of gallantry and resolution; and from five in
the morning till one in the afternoon fought as courageously as possibly men
could, either in respect of the Valor they showed, or in their conduct and
dexterity in mannaging of the said Fight; and the English on their sides being
well pleased to have to do with so gallant and resolute an enemy, and who
promised them a great deal of glory in their manful and vigorous resistance,
received them as gallantly on their parts; and the fight being by this time
well exasperated on both sides, they passed through, and upon each other with
so much violence, impetuosity, and dexterity, as that it might be easily
conjectured each particular person knew that the whole decision of the War
depended on the event of this combat. The Sea was never so much pressed by its
contrary Elements, and the combatants which covered the Decks and Galleries
appeared like unto so many Salamanders that live in the fire; and indeed the
zeal and earnestness which transported them were of the very same nature; each
Vessel chose another to try the day withal, and whenever one was charged by
two or three, more or less, that only served to waken her dexterrity, and to
excite her resolution; and those who could not burn, destroy, or sink their
Enemies by a close boarding and grasping hand to hand, endeavored to dispute
that which their Cannons could not effect. The Fight at length became so
obstinate and violent, as that the Air was red by fire, and the Sea with blood,
and these two floating Forests, whose high and thick Masts sunk as fast as the
Corn under the Mowers hand, gave to believe by their redoubled and obstinately
continued blows, that the Sea would at length serve both the Fleets for a
Triumph and a Tomb.

The Dutch Admiral Van-Trump slain.
And in the very midst of this contest, the Holland Admiral Van-Trump being
wounded, presaged his death, wherefore like a Lion, who having received his
mortal wound by the hand of the Huntsman, redoubleth his force ever at the
Article of his expiring; so this famous and renowned Admiral did sell his life
at a dear rate, and had received that happiness to be sprinkled with the blood
of his Enemies in that barbarous Element in which he had so often sown his
Palms and Laurels.

In like manner, the Generals Blake and Monk did most admirably well sustain
the last Assaults of this desperate dying Admiral, who desired not so much to
live as to revenge his own Death; Both these gallant Generals I say were
present every where, and in all occasions; and where their persons could not
show themselves, Vice Admiral Pen and Rere-Admiral Lawson, so well supplied
their places, as that the Hollanders encountered none but Admirals wheresoever
they charged. Finally, all the English as well Officers as Seamen behaved
themselves wonderously well, and had the Honor to obtain jointly with the
Laurels of War, the Roses and Olive-branches of a glorious Peace. And amongst
the rest of the Holland Ships of note, the Garland a stout man of War, which
the Hollanders had formerly taken from the English was laid aboard by the
Worcester Frigot, and was fired and burnt by her. The Triumph and the Andrew of
the English side were also boarded by two or three Dutch Fire Ships, and
received some damage in their sails and rigging, but were quickly again
cleared by the Valor and industry of the nearest Ships, and some of particular
persons. As to the Hollands Fleet, it seemed to have been all on fire, so well
did the English Fire Ships second by their dexterity the men of War, and the
Cries of those who saw their ships rouling and sinking alike, were more
formidable and loud then the roarings of the Sea; so that as they endeavored
to avoid the flames, they were sure to find their deaths in the merciless
Waves. There were at least twenty Holland men of War burnt and sunk in this
fight, and almost all their Companies lost, although the English took more
glory to save them, then their valor as it seems had to destroy them; the
generosity of the English causing them to precipitate themselves midst all
dangers whatsoever, to save the lives of above a thousand of their enemies:
amongst which, there were six Captains which the Hollanders themselves had
abandoned, by reason they were not in a capacity to save them.

The Dutch put to flight.
Finally, the Hollanders seeing so great a number of their ships sunk and lost,
began to despair of the Victory; and the spirits of their men being drowned and
fallen, they thought it not fitting to expose themselves with the rest of the
Fleet, to the hazard of a general defeat and rout, they faced about, and began
to bear away with all the possible sail they could make toward the Texel. And
the English not judging it expedient to engage too far upon the Dutch Coast by
reason of the Flats, the Wind being also very uncertain and inconstant at that
time, and moreover their sails and tackling being sufficiently torn and rent,
they resolved at a Council of War, to set sail with the whole Fleet to
Soles-Bay, to dispose of such ships as were disabled, and to put their wounded
Men and Prisoners on shore, and sending two small Frigots to observe the Course
they steered, who kept in sight of them till next morning by break of day, when
as they steered into Texel Harbor, by the favor of certain Boats with Lights,
which were sent them out to conduct them in. The loss which the English
sustained in this Fight, was of about three hundred men who were slain
outright; amongst which there were eight Captains, to wit, Graves, Chapman,
Tailor, Newman, Crispe, Owen, Cox, and Peacock; the wounded were about seven
hundred in number, whereof five were Captains, viz. Stokes, Seaman, Rous,
Holland, and Cabitt, who all of them behaved themselves like persons of Courage
and Conduct. As for the number of the killed and hurt on the Hollanders part,
we can make no other guess thereat, save only according to the number of the
ships which they lost, however several Letters from Holland certified, that in
the Fight they lost about six thousand men.

This Naval Conflict being the most bloody and most famous Fight which happened
between the English and the Hollander since the Wars began, did evidently
manifest what a kind of Martial genious it was, that had gotten such a
transcendency upon the deciding of a Victory; and how wise and vigorous a Pilot
there was both at the Helm of the State and of the Fleet: So likewise the
advantages which were obtained by this Victory were very considerable, during
the conjuncture of Affairs at the present, just on the point of an
accommodation, which also ensued both unto the profit, honor, and glory of
England. And in reference thereunto, the Parliament did acknowledge this so
important and considerable a peace of service by all the marks of honor, which
could be worthily conferred on persons who had so valiantly acquitted
themselves. To the Generals, Blake, Monk, Pen, and Lawson, and to the other
Flag Captains, Gold Chains were presented as precious tokens of their favor
and acknowledgements; and to the other Officers of the Fleet, silver Meddals
were distributed, which although they were not of so much value yet they bear
as great a weight in the Scales and Balances of honor and glory.

The weakness of the new Parliament.
And this very Parliament which truly had procured very beneficial Orders in
matters of the lesser consequence, extremely advantageous to the people, in
respect of the small time during which they had been assembled, however in the
greater concernments they had not so good Fortune; there was so much of
confusion in their Councels, such a contrariety in their opinions, such a
dissonancy in their actings, and disparity in their aims and projections, as
that this Senate was more like unto a Monster with many heads, then a well
ordered grand assembly, or supreme Council; insomuch, that there was little or
no appearance it should continue out the prefixed time of their sitting.
Moreover, the chiefest designs by their long and tedious discussions and
debates did even perish and vanish through the loss of those urgent actions
which are the soul of execution, or became public by a too public devulging
of such secrets as are not usually discovered by great Statesmen, until the
very effects of them are ready to appear. All which reasons being naturally
pondered by the wisest and most zealous persons interessed in the glory of the
English Nation, the good and welfare of the Commonwealth, and particularly by
his excellency the Lord General, it was resolved that the Parliament should be
dissolved; in reference hereunto, on the twelfth of December, 1653. as soon as
the Parliament was met, A Member of the said House stood up and moved.

A motion to dissolve the Parliament.
That the sitting of this Parliament as it was then constituted, being not
thought proper nor fitting for the good of the Commonwealth, It was therefore
requisite to deliver up unto the Lord General Cromwell, the powers which they
had received from him. Which motion being seconded by the greatest part of the
other Members, the House arose, The Parliament meant dissolved December, 12,
1653.
and the Speaker accompanied by the major part of the House departed, and went
to White Hall, where they did by a Writing under their hands (being the greater
number of the Members sitting in Parliament) resign unto his Excellency the
Power which they had received from him, and the which was by the Speaker
presented to his said Excellency accordingly, in the Name of the whole House.

No sooner was the Parliament dissolved and that Affairs of moment and weight
came crowding in apace, but that there was a necessity (during the intervalls
of Parliament) to form (as it is called in foreign parts) an upper Council,
and to create a superior dignity, to avoid both tediousness and confusion in
the dispatch of Affairs; which said dignity holding the midway between a
Monarchial and Democratical, might avoid the inconveniences which these two
extremities are subject unto; and the thing it self having been well pondered
and maturely deliberated, the choice of the person on whom this dignity was to
be conferred, was soon made, God having pointed him out unto them by a mark,
those admirable and uninterrupted Victories which he caused him to gain; and by
those excellent productions of a mind, which had something of supernatural in
it, and partaked of the Divinity.

The Lord General Cromwell chosen and sworn Lord Protector.
Wherefore the Lord General Cromwell was Elected, Declared, and Sworn at
Westminster, in the presence of all the Judges and Justices, the Barons of the
Exchequer, the keepers of the Liberties of England, the Lord Major and Aldermen
of the City of London, with most of the chief Officers of the Army, Lord
Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the
Islands and Territories thereunto belonging; and at the same time several
Articles were presented to the Lord Protector, by which he was to govern the
people; which being red unto him, he took a solemn Oath to perform and see
them kept in the presence of the whole assembly, protesting moreover, that he
would mind nothing so much as the good of the Commonwealth, the Glory of God,
and the Honor of the English Nation.

The chief heads of the Articles of Government were as follows.
The Protector Sworn to the ensuing Articles.
1. That the Protector should call a Parliament every three years. 2. That the
first Parliament should assemble on the third of September, 1654. 3. That he
should not dissolve the Parliament till it had sat five months. 4. That such
Bills as he should not sign within twenty days should pass without him. 5.
That he should have a select Council to assist him, not exceeding one and
twenty, nor less then thirteen. 6. That immediately after his Death the Council
should choose another Protector before they rose. 7. That no Protector after
him should be General of the Army. 8. That the Protector should have Power to
make Peace or War. 9. That with the consent of his Council he may make Laws
which shall be binding to the Subjects during the intervals of Parliament, etc.
Immediately after which, the Lord General Cromwell, without the devesting of
himself of the Command of the Army, (which he preferred before all other
charges) took upon him the title of Highness, and the dignity and name of Lord
Protector. A very fit appellation, in regard of the Infantine, and as yet
growing State of England, which the several Factions and Divisions, as also the
different Opinions in Religion would have exposed to a numberless kind of
unavoidable miseries, had not a powerful Genius, armed with Force and
Judgment, protected it from ripping up its Entrails and Bowels by its own
hands. And immediately after, he was proclaimed Lord Protector of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, etc. The Lord Protector proclaimed.
First in the Palace yard at Westminster, by the Officers of State, and
afterward at the Royal Exchange by the Lord Major and Aldermen in their
Scarlet Gowns.

Some few days after the body of the City invited his Highness the Lord
Protector to a most splendid feast and gallant entertainment, at Grocers-Hall;
not so much to treat him with their good cheer, as with the resplendent
testimonies of their joy, and with the submissive tenders of their devoires.

His Highness would by no means refuse to give that satisfaction to their
evidences of respect and joy; and the better to testify unto them on his
behalf, the high value he put upon their care and love, he set forth toward
them in as great a pomp and magnificence as befitted a person invested with so
eminent qualities; and as one who having reaped so many Laurels, had newly
restored peace and tranquillity unto three distracted Kingdoms.

The manner of his Highness going to the City and reception there, was on this
wise.
His Highness's Lifeguard of Horse marched in the first place, after which
followed the chief Officers of the Army on Horseback, and some of his Council
of State: after them rode two Pages bare headed in sumptuous Apparel; after
them came twelve Lackeys in velvet Caps and gray Liveries, with silk and silver
Fringe; then followed his Highness seated in a Charet of State drawn by six
beautiful Horses richly trapped, which by their lofty gate seemed to glory in
their drawing so victorious a Hercules, triumphing over so many Monsters: and
his Highness who always preferred the little ornaments of the Soul before
those of the Body, was only clad in a dark colored Suit and Cloak, the
greatest part of the other Nobility attending in their Coaches and six horses.

At Temple Bar his Highness was met and received by the Lord Major and
Aldermen; and the Recorder of the City saluted him with an excellent Speech,
containing several expressions of Joy, Fidelity, and Obeisance, and of good
Hopes of his prosperous and happy Government. His Highness having thanked him,
alighted from his Chariot, and quitting his Cloak, put on a rich Riding Coat
imbroidered with Gold, and got up on Horseback on a Palfrey richly trapped,
and was followed by three other led Horses of State. By which change of
Garments, his Highness testified unto them, that when as occasions of the
States-service should call upon him, he would descend from his Triumphal
Chariot, where the glory of his Conquests had set him in rest, and mounting his
Horse for Battle, would expose his Life as freely, as he formerly had done, for
the peace and tranquillity of their City, and for the Liberty of England. The
Lord Major rode all the way bare-headed, as also carried the City Sword drawn
before his late Highness the Lord Protector. By the one, representing the
Respect and Obedience of the City; and by the other, its Fidelity and
Resolution, to spill their Blood in the defense of the Peace of the State, and
for the preservation of the Life and new Dignity of his Highness.

The Streets were railed up, and the several Companies of the City in their
Liveries sat on both sides of the way, with Streamers sticking up to
distinguish each Company. Moreover, it is a thing worthy to be observed, how
that the Character which God does imprint on the Forehead of those whom he has
designed to be his Vicegerents on Earth, does beget an astonishment and fear in
the hearts of those where it cannot raise a respect; but in the others, both
admiration and love: so that on all sides the Divine Providence compasses its
Glory, either by the means of its Justice or Mercy. And thus you see his
Highness the Lord Protector passing through this great City, which was drawn up
in Arms, having his Head only covered with Laurels, and his guarded with a
simple though resplendent morsel of Glory; The one surrounding him to cover and
protect him with her wings; and the disarmed Justice which accompanied this
great Heroes footsteps, seemed to Lead a naked and fettered Mars by a silken
thread

Sir Thomas Viner Knighted.
And thus after his Highness had been most splendedly entertained by the City,
before he departed, he conferred the Honor of Knighthood upon the Lord Major,
and left all the City filled with an admiration of his Heroic Virtues, and
with a general satisfaction of his candor and generousness; their hopes being
freighted with acclamations and good wishes.

No sooner was his late Highness settled in the Supreme degree of his
Protectorship, but just like the Sun elevated in a high sublime Sphere, he
begat an infinite number of malignant Exhalations, which however were soon
dissipated by his luster and resplendency; and at the same time by his virtue,
he gave a life and being to all those glorious actions which knowing men did
expect from his sage Government.

A Conspiracy discovered.
On the Eighteenth of February, 1653. a most dangerous Conspiracy which was
hatched by the Royalists was discovered; several of the Conspirators were taken
and sent to the Tower of London. But his Highness willing to begin his
Government by an Act of Clemency; and to let the world see, that the Grandor of
his new Dignity did only render him powerful to do good, he pardoned the said
Delinquents, and caused them to be set at liberty.

Addresses to his Highness from all parts.
Much about which time arrived Deputies from the several Counties and Shires as
well of England, Stotland and Ireland, to congratulate his Highness happy
Inauguration, and to assure him of their fidelity and submission to his
Commands; all which his Highness received with a great deal of Candor, and
repaied them with Use (to wit) the establishing of good and salutary Orders for
the Peace and Tranquillity of the Commonwealth, and each Member thereof in
particular; Nor did he forget to regulate the Spiritual Affairs, and out of an
infinite number of Opinions, he begat a pleasant harmony; the seeming
dissonance and harshness whereof, was only unsavory to the ignorant, and to
such as had stopped their ears.

The Scots frame an Army.
Mean while the Scots animated by several discontented persons here in England,
did levy an Army by Command from their King, and began to take heart of grace
again, reassuming their former courage and hopes. The Earls of Glencarne and
Kenmore were at the Head of four thousand Horse and Foot, joining several other
small parties, which from all sides flocked down unto them. But Colonel Morgan
was so vigilant and active, that before they could have time to Form a greater
Body, he marched with fifteen hundred Horse and Foot, and on the seventh of
February he arrived at Lough, The Scots defeated by Colonel Morgan.
which was the Enemies appointed Rendezvous, where having charged them, after a
short but smart Fight, he killed one hundred and fifty of them, and defeated
all the rest, the Earl of Glencarne with much ado making his escape only with
forty Horse. But all these small Bickerings, and as it were shadows of War, did
only serve as a foil to that most important and considerable Peace which both
England and Holland was to reap at our Olivers hands.

Peace with Holland concluded and proclaimed.
When as most part of the Winter was well nigh passed over in this Negotiation
at London, where the Hollanders had four Ambassadors who daily labored to
compass the same. Two of them, to wit, the Lords Newport and Youngstall
re-passed into Holland about the Month of February, to communicate unto the
High and Mighty Lords the States their Masters, the Conclusion of the Treaty,
and to get them to ratify the same. On the third of March 1653/4. of the same
Year, they returned back again, where they were received with all the pomp and
state that could possibly be imagined, and might demonstrate the Joy which the
Merchants conceived of the happy effects of so happy a Reconciliation. The next
day they had Audience from his Highness, where declaring the full powers they
had from the Lords States to ratify the said Peace which they had made, they
desired a speedy Cessation of Arms should be published on both sides; and in
conformity thereto, on the fifth Day of April next ensuing, the Articles of
Peace were signed, sealed, and delivered on the behalf of both parties, and
were accordingly published and proclaimed, to the general satisfaction of all
men. And his Highness, the better to testify the particular pleasure he took
therein, did most sumptuously treat the Holland Ambassadors; witnessing unto
them by his noble Noble treatment, all the marks of Joy which might manifest
and make good, by his Conduct and Entertainment, the old Motto of his Family,
That War has no other end save to beget a Peace.

And as to the Affairs of Ireland, his Highness by his good Orders, and
establishing the Natives in the Province of Cannaught, which is in the heart of
Ireland, had settled all things so well in those parts, as that the English
needed not to fear any either abroad or at home; The Affairs of Ireland settled.
and the Irish beginning to be sensible that the Yoke of a vigilant and
absolute Protector was far more tolerable, and to be preferred before the
Servitude of a feeble and tottering multitude, who only heeding their own
preservations and particular interests, do abandon the People and their
wellfares, either to their own capriciousness, or to the imbroils of ambitious
and hot spirits, who abusing of the Commonalties simplicity and sincerity, run
them headlong into Ruin.

But some enemies of the State perceiving that it was impossible to hinder the
Earth from bringing forth of good fruits, as long as it was animated by so
sensible and feeling a warmth, resolved to beget an Eclipse of its Sun; and
having covered it with darkness, to bring down Horror and Confusion upon it:
wherefore a black Conspiracy was hatched again his late Highness's Life; but
Heaven which had preserved A second conspiracy.
him for her glory, and for the good of England, and carried him through so
many dangers during the Wars, did even as yet watch over him in the times of
Peace, and miraculously preserved him for this heinous attempt, as well as from
many others. Several of the Conspirators were apprehended; and amongst the
rest, Mr. Thomas and John Gerrard, Brothers, John Jones an Apothecary, and
Thomas Tender, Somerset Fox, and Peter Vowel, who being Tried and Condemned to
dye, Vowel was Hanged, John Gerrard by reason of his Birth was Beheaded; Mr.
Vowel Hanged Mr. Gerrard Beheaded.
Thomas Gerrard and Fox were pardoned by his Highness, by reason of their
ingenuous confessions, and some other further discoveries which they made of
the Fact.

The Portugal Ambassadors Brother Beheaded.
At the same time the Portugal Ambassadors Brother was likewise Beheaded, for
having caused the Death of an English Gentleman, at a hubbub and quarrel made
by the Portugals in the New Exchange: neither could States policy, nor the
complacency and gallantry which are often used by Princes, to the prejudice of
the Commenwealth, and of the particular members of the same, hinder the doing
of Justice in this case; so much did the love of his Country, and the
suffering of Justice to take place, prevail with his late Highness.

The Scotch Highlanders rise in Arms.
Mean while, the Scotch Highlanders not being able to brook the English yoke,
although they full well saw that their continual Conspiracies and Risings were
discovered and crushed, yet they believed that a far greater and more
considerable one might happily break forth and show themselves, in case any
considerable party should rise in Arms; they therefore got together in a body,
and General Middleton being passed out of Holland into Scotland, joined himself
to them. But General Monk falling into the North of Scotland, and for some time
driving them from place to place, did at length on the one and twentieth of
July 1654. give them such a full charge at Loughberrie, that he defeated them
and made them incapable of ever after thinking of appearing in Arms again.
General Middleton defeated by General Monk.
However, all these happy successes, such an absolute power, and so invincible
an Army at command, did not at all insult in his Highnesses thoughts, nor puff
up his mind, nor inhaunced his authority, save only armed him with much
precaution as he stood in need of, to maintain the Peace and Tranquillity of
the People, to augment their wealth, and to increase the glory of the
Commonwealth; therefore to produce that mediocrity which the Gown adds to
Arms, and which public Councels, do unto private Deliberations, on the third
of September 1654. a Parliament A Parliament assembly September 3. 1654.
(which had been convocated by his Highness Writs according to the tenor of the
precedent ones) assembled at Westminster, and began its sitting, after the
members had been present at a most learned and eloquent Sermon preached by Mr.
Marshal, when as Mr. Lenthal was declared Speaker of the House; and as soon as
they were met, they fell upon the questioning of the Power by which they were
convocated, and doubted of its lawfulness; so that his late Highness
considering with himself the evils which a new change might produce, caused a
form and acknowledgement of the Government to be drawn up, which was to be
signed by all the Members of the House before they were to meet again. The
Tenor whereof follows, viz.

The Recognition to be signed by the Members before they were admitted to the
House in the Parliament of September 3. 1654.
I do hereby freely promise and engage to be true and faithful to the Lord
Protector, and the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and shall
not (according to the Tenor of the Indenture, whereby I am returned to serve in
Parliament, propose, or give my consent to alter the Government, as it is
settled in one person and a Parliament.

After which subscrption, the Members were admitted to assemble again; but not
at all minding those things which the State expected at their hands, and on the
contrary, instead of cementing the commonalty in a perfect union; they fed them
with vain and imaginary hopes, and endeavored to disgust them with the
Government: giving them to understand, that they should enjoy happy days
again, which they could not have hoped for till then, and which they were to
expect from their consultations and assemblings. Wherefore his Highness having
had patience with them full five entire months, after he had several times
exhorted them to follow more lawful courses, and not to forget their Duties by
swerving from them in such a manner as they did: Parliament d^^^^ved January
10. 1655.
But seeing all this gained nothing upon their Spirits, his Highness dissolved
the Parliament on the tenth day of January, 1655 five Months after its
Convocation: and truly it was high time to put a period to their Consultation,
which only tended to have ripped up again the old sores of the State, which his
late Highness had so happily closed up; and to have engaged England into a
worse Relapse then its former Mallady.

Several Conspiracies discovered.
And the venom and rancor which was hatched in the said Parliament was so
general, that it had spread it self through all the Counties of England. Sir
Henry Littleton, and Sir John Packington, chief Actors in this Conspiracy, were
apprehended; and Major Wildman on the behalf of the Levellers was surprised and
seized on, as he was dictating a Paper to one of his Servants, or rather a
Libel, the Title whereof was, A Declaration containing the Motives and Reasons
which oblige us to take up Arms against Oliver Cromwell. Nor did this discovery
at all dishearten the Conspirators, the business being so general, and so many
People being engaged therein, insomuch, that they ceased not to carry on the
Design, which they grounded more upon the force then the fear thereof: and
immediately News was brought, that a party of two hundred armed men had entered
the Town of Salisbury A Rising at Salisbury.
on Sunday about midnight, commanded by Sir Joseph Wagstaff, Penruddock, and
Jones, who had been formerly Officers in the late Kings Army. They presently
seized on all the Inns, and chief Houses; and whereas at that time the Assizes
were held at that place, they were so bold as to take away the Judges
Commissions and Patents; and having likewise taken all their Horses, they went
away and marched toward Pool.

A Rising in Shropshire.
At the same time a second party of these Risers did endeavor to surprise the
Town and Castle of Shrewsbury, but being discovered, their design failed.

A Rising in Montgomery.
In Montgomeryshire eight hundred men got to a head, which marching backwards
and forwards, daily increased; and committed all kind of Acts of Hostility.

A Rising in Nottinghamshire.
There likewise came tidings from Nottinghamshire, that a party of five hundred
Horse had been seen together in Sheerwood Forest, with several Carts laden with
Ammunitions; who making an halt at an Inn which was situated from the Road, to
consult on their Business, were seized with a Pannick fear: and no one of their
Enemies appearing or pursuing them, they cried out that they were betrayed; and
so betook themselves to their heels, some one way some another, in a confused
manner.

A Rising framing in Northumberland.
So likewise did Colonel Lilburn send word out of Northumberland, that they
were busy in framing of a party there also, but that they had dissipated
themselves through their own Fears and Jealousies.

A rising in Yorkshire.
Finally, in Yorkshire, Sir Henry Slingsby, and Sir Richard Maleverer had also
assembled some Forces to have seized the City of York, having two Cart-loads of
Ammunition with them, but they dispersed themselves on their own account,
seeing but little appearance to succeed in their design; Sir Henry Slingsby
was taken and Imprisoned, and afterward Beheaded upon another account.

Wagstaff defeated and Penruddock and others executed.
The first party commanded by Wagstaff and Penruddock was defeated by Captain
Vnton Crook, at a place called South-melton; some whereof were killed and
others were taken, who were Tried and Condemned; and those which dyed of note
were Mr. Lucas, Thorpe, Kensey, Graves, and Penruddock, Sir Joseph Wagstaff had
the hap to make his escape and to get away.

Royalists sent toforreign Plantations.
Moreover a little afterward to rid the State of such like Incendiaries and
Firebrands, the several Prisons and Goals of England were delivered from the
Royalists, which were detained prisoners on the foregoing accounts, who were
sent away to the Plantations and Collonies in America.

The Insurrections all dissipated.
In like manner, the rest of the other risings before mentioned, were quelled
and dissipated, which both struck a terror in those who had not as yet shown
themselves, and restored peace and quietness to the State.

A Spanish Ambassador sent over to his Highness
By this time the subtle Spaniard, whose quaint policy does for the most part
hug the prosperous, and destroy the miserable and distressed, seeing that
Fortune did daily more and more incline to favor his late Highness the Lord
Protector, that his Vigor and Force increased by opposition, and that the sole
resplendency of his glory dissipated all those fogs and mists which endeavored
to obscure it, thought it meet to court England, and to endeavor to engage
this State in his interests, in which was omitted no proffers which a Puissant
Monarch could possibly make unto a Prince, whose Power was but as it were in
the bud, and beginning to sprout forth. To which purpose the Marquis of Leda
arived at London in the quality of an extraordinary Ambassador to his late
Highness; where he was received with all the Demonstrations of Honor and Pomp.
But his late Highness being over-sensible of all those gross injuries which the
Spanish Nation for several years together have committed against the English,
and also against all Europe besides; and being not willing to conform his
Maxims with the tyrannical and unjust principles of the Spaniards, returned
civil and ceremonious Answers to the said Ambassadors Proposals; who returned
back again very speedily with all sorts of contentment and satisfaction, save
only to that which he chiefly expected and most of all insisted upon. And
England being at that present time in a peaceable posture, the Almighty having
Crowned his late Highness the Lord protector with several signal Victories and
Deliverances of his person from an infinite number of Dangers, his Highness
thought he could not in a better wise express his acknowledgements Motives
inducing his late Highness to a Breach with Spain.
for so many mercies, then by the employing of all his Care and Forces to
oppose and beat down the Ambition (nay I may justly say, their Sacraledge and
Impiety) and Avarice of the Spaniards, since it only belongs to a God to Style
himself the Universal Monarch; who at the expense and charge of an hundred
thousand Murders and Devastations, have rendered themselves Masters of the whole
worlds Treasures. And withal, totally to extripate and root up the profound
plots and devices which the Spaniards had long since laid in England to become
Masters thereof; or at least to breed divisions in it at their own pleasures.
Nor shall I need to enlarge upon the ambitious and cruel designs of that
invincible Armado of Philip the Second, which was to have invaded England, and
to have made it swim in its own Blood; nor of those several entreagues and
policies which Spain has hatched in Ireland, by assistances of men and moneys;
as also by their several Conspiracies in England, abusing of the Religion and
blind zeal of some particular persons there: I shall only begin with Gundamore
that arch Machiavilian Spanish Ambassador, who had gained such a Credit and
Power in the Court of England, as that when he pleased he could dispose of the
Lives of the greatest and best men in the State, when he had discovered they
were his Masters Enemies: I shall only instance in one, that admirable
personage Sir Walter Rawleigh, who by reason he had undertaken to visit their
Treasures in Hispaniola, and had Committed some hostillities in those Seas in
former time, Gundamore never left importuning of King James (whom he had in a
manner bewitched) till he had obtained his death, and thus bereaved England of
one of the great Politicians and Universallest men that ever this Isle brought
forth; leaving us a testimony of his vast knowledge and experience, to wit, his
famous History of the World. From hence his late Highness resolved to begin his
just War against the proud Spaniard, and to sacrifice to the memory of this
great Captain (and one of the most experienced Seamen of all the World) all
the Spanish Blood which the valor of the noble English has so generously by
way of retaliation drawn and let out since his late Highness's expedition
against them.

There are some friends with whom a man is forced to break off all friendship,
because they will be too much our friends; that is, because they over-act the
part of friendship by prying too deep into our Affairs and Designs, and by
interesting themselves too far into the concernments of those who depend on us,
as that thereby they steal away their hearts from us; and such like friends
have the Spaniards been to England, who buy their friendships at such cheap
rates, as that they feed those who side with them only with imaginary
speculations here on earth, making them eternally miserable; and with specious
promises in the world to come, which would be obtained at cheaper and more
assured rates without the interposing of their Hippocritical and Ambitious
trains.

But to return to our History again, his late Highness whose Genius affected
the greatest difficulties, and the most extraordinary and rarest Designs, fixed
his thoughts upon New Spain; not to bereave them of their Treasures, which are
with more ease to be interrupted at their coming home, but to revenge all
Europe, unto whom the Jealous humor of the Spaniards denies Traffic and
Commerce into those parts; having at all times exercised unheard of Cruelties
and horrible Treacheries on such as were driven into those parts accidentally
and forcibly by storms and tempests; or such as were by themselves, under the
notion of friendship and kind entertainment, drawn in thither to trade with
them; whom they tied stark naked unto trees, placing this Writing on their
Breasts, Who sent for you hither? And in this wise suffered them to be eaten up
alive by the Fowls of the Air, and the wild Beasts of the Field.

The Hispaniola expe^^ion
And the better to accomplish this Design, on the twenty seventh of December,
1654 a gallant Fleet manned with brave Sea and Land-men, and well furnished
with all kind of Provisions and Ammunitions of War, set sail from Portsmouth
Road under the Command of the Generals, Penn and Venables, upon a Design which
was not made public. On the first of May 1655. news was brought that they were
arrived at the Barbados on the twenty eight of January, where they had seized
eighteen Holland Merchantmen, which traffiqued in those parts contrary to the
Ordinance of the long Parliament, prohibitting the same. And by Letters of a
fresher date, that they set sail from Barbados on the thirtieth of March
toward Hispaniola. Where being arrived, by an unfortunate excess of prudence,
the Commanders not deeming it fit to make a too near descent unto Sancto
Domingo in Hispaniola, (which notwithstanding was deserted by all the Garrison
at the very sight and appearance of so considerable a Fleet) landed their men
somewhat lower; that so, during the time the Spaniards should come to impead
their descent, they might have liberty to disimbark all their men, and to
refresh themselves of the toils of the Sea. But this landing so far from the
place, and deferring of the attempt, put a new life and courage into the
Spaniards, who repossessed their place again; imagining that the English being
unaccustomed to the excessive Heats of that Climate, and the deepness of the
Sands, would be infinitely tired in their March; and that by the said means
they should be able to repulse and withstand them at a very cheap rate; which
fell out just as the Spaniards had foreseen it: for the Climate was so hot and
the Sands so deep, as that the English after their long march were not able to
fight, were put to flight, and enforced to march back again to their ships, not
without some difficulty; however, being seconded by fresh and vallant Seamen,
who went on shore to bring them off, they got on board again.

And that their long voyage and course might not prove totally useless and
unprofitable, they Jamaica attempted and carried.
resolved to set upon the Island of Jamaica, where they arrived on the tenth of
May next ensuing; and after a little resistance which was made by the
Spaniards, they became Masters of the place, which they have ever since
preserved and kept with a great deal of constancy and glory, as we shall see
hereafter.

And that the English valor might be rendered more considerable and formidable
to the whole World, the Almighty inspired into them that Religious Design, to
revenge the Christians wrongs and sufferings against the Profanations and
Abuses of the Turkish Barbarians, and crowned their pious attempt with as holy
and glorious a Victory. General Blake demads satisfaction for wrongs sustained.
Wherefore, General Blake having cast Anchor before Tunnis on the eighteenth of
April, 1655 sent unto the Die of the place, to demand satisfaction for some
English ships which the Pirates of those parts had carried away, and the liberty
of the English Slaves they had detained. But it was refused with scorn and
derision, the Turks making this Answer, Behold our Castles of Galetta, and our
Castles and Vessels of Porto Ferino, do your worst against them, and do not
think to brave us with the sight of your great Fleet. Whereupon, General Blake
being sensible, that the Glory of God, and the Honor of the English Nation was
concerned in the punishing of so great a disdain; and to let the Enemies of
Christ and Christianism see, That they can do all things in and through him
their strength and fortress, he called a Council of War, rather to implore the
Almighties assistance toward the compassing of so glorious a Design, then to
resolve on the performing it. Each one finding himself animated and armed with
a more then natural courage, to let those Infidels and all the World see, That
the English are none of the least zealous in the Concernments of Christ; and so
jointly resolved by all means possible to burn nine of their men of War which
lay in Porto Ferino, which was performed in the manner following. General Blake
attempts the Turks fortresses and navy.
The Seashore was lined by one hundred and twenty pieces of Cannon, and the
Port was defended by the Castle, on which twenty pieces were mounted, besides
some other small Forts which were also defended by great Guns and Musket shot:
However, it was resolved, That the Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rere-Admiral
should approach within musket shot of the Castle, and there come to an Anchor,
and incessantly fire upon the Castle and other Forts, whilst the rest of the
Fleet should second and back the Fireships and long Boats which were designed
to fire the Ships in the Port. And the Almighty did evidently manifest as well
in the hearts of the men, as by the blowing of the Wind, that he bare a part
in this undertaking; so favorable was the Wind to the English, and so much
were their courages animated by his Grace and Spirit: therefore in less then
four hours time the said nine Ships were burnt down to their very Keels, the
English for their part losing but five and twenty men which were slain, and
eight and forty wounded. Whereupon, the King of Tunis sought to the English for
their friendship, and restored all the Prisoners for little or nothing: amongst
which, diverse Dutch also obtained their liberty amongst the English, not being
distinguished by the Turks. And one of the English Admirals who went ashore to
redeem the Captives, was highly honored and treated; all which sufficiently
recompensed the disdain they harbored against the Valor and Piety of the
English.

Nor had these bold and glorious attempts sufficiently blazed the Virtue and
Fortune of our late Protector, had they not continually been assailed by
intestine Conspiracies which rose one on the back of the other, like unto so
many Surges of the Sea, but which brake themselves in like manner upon a small
shelf of Sand, on which the finger of God had worked their limits which they
durst not exceed. A fourth conspiracy suspected.
Thus on the twelfth of June in the same Year, the Lords, Willoughby of Parham,
and Newport, Mr. Seamore, and Mr. Newport, with some others, were sent
Prisoners to the Tower of London, on suspicion of intermedling and assisting in
a new Conspiracy.

A Relief sent to Jamaica in twelve ships.
But to the end that evil might be repayed with good, and that the Sun might be
heightened in its heat at the same time that the mists and fogs did thicken to
obscure it, his Highness sent twelve good men of War, well manned, with
Colonel Humphreys his Regiment to boot, and well provided with all
necessaries, as well to reinforce the Naval Army as the Land Forces in
Jamaica; which Fleet set sail on the second of July next ensuing, and in
convenient space of time arived safely at their designed Port.

General Pen returns to England.
Within a month after which, General Pen arrived in England, having left the
best part of the Fleet in those parts under the Command of Vice Admiral
Goodson, a very valiant and experienced Sea-Commander, and the Troops which had
mastered Jamaica under the Command of Colonel Fortescue. But as all
prosperities are usually accompanied with some small Allayes of adversity, the
Almighty suffering it to be so for our instruction and precaution, and to
humble us in our highest transcendencies of Fortune; Wherefore the said Fleet
having gained the height of the Havennas in the Isle of Cuba, the Paragon
Frigot was fired by negligence, and perished in the flames with the greatest
part of its Company and Mariners before she could be succored or relieved.

General Venables also returned.
On the ninth of the month of September ensuing, General Venables likewise
returned from the Indies in the Frigot called the Marston-moor, in so weak and
dejected a condition, that he was even at deaths door and nothing save the
change of Air could possibly have saved him.

Treaty and Peace with Sweden.
Mean while, the sympathy which all great and courageous persons seem to have
for each other, begat a desire in his late Highness to be in amity with the
King of Sweden, and likewise the King of Sweden on the other side coveted the
same thing; so that the noble Lord Bulstrode Whitlock, one of Englands
Worthies, having scarce his like for profound Knowledge and Sagacity, after he
had resided for the space of eight Months in Sweden, terminated his Embassy by
a complete Peace and glorious Alliance, which he had concluded between that
Crown and England; and returned himself to bring the good tidings thereof.

Now for the preservation of the Peace of this Commonwealth, his late Highness
constituted several Major-Generals in the respective Counties thereof, whose
Names are as follows: viz.

1. For Kent and Surrey, Colonel Kelsey. Major Generals constituted.
2. For Sussex, Hamshire, and Barkeshire, Colonel Goff. 3. For Glocestershire,
Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, General Desborow. 4. For
Oxfordshire, Bucks, Hertford, Cambridge, Isle of Ely, Essex, Norfolk, and
Suffolk, the Lord Deputy Fleetwood. 5. For the City of London, Major General
Skippon. 6. For Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Derby, Warwick, and Leicestershire,
Commislary General Whaley. 7. For Northamptonshire, Bedford, Rutland, and
Huntington, Major Butler. 8. For Worcester, Hereford, Salop, and North Wales,
Colonel Berry. 9. For Cheshire, Lancashire, and Staffordshire, Colonel
Wortley. 10. For Yorkshire, Durham, Cumberland, Westmerland, and
Northumberland, the Lord Lambert. 11. For Westminster and Middlesex, the
Lieuetenant of the Tower.
France seeks his Highness to perfect a Peace.
At this time France on her side being jealous of the several applications,
profers, and propositions which the Spaniards made unto England; to beget an
alliance with us, began to be sensible that it was high time to think upon her
own preservation, her navigation being quite ruined, her subjects divided by
Civil Wars, and intestine troubles, and her foreign Enemies as powerful as
ever, resolved at length to make an address to his late Highness for an
Alliance of Peace.

Besides, that his late Highness harbored a natural aversness and hatred
against the Spaniards, who time out of mind have always been the implacable
and cruel Enemies of England, Reasons inducing his late Highness rather to
condescend to an alliance with France then Spain.
as well as of all mankind besides; and who under a fair pretense of Religion
and Amity, endeavor to withdraw the Subjects of their Allies, and make them
swerve from their Allegiance and Fidelity, either by the powerful operations of
money, gifts, and such like other bewitching inducements, rendering themselves
the Masters of the peoples inclinations, when by their Valor they cannot
overcome them in Battle, nor by force of Arms gain their Towns or Fortresses.
But his late Highness open virtue and magnanimous courage disdaining any
Commerce with this kind of insinuating and entreaguing Nation, the Lion being
too noble to enter into association and communication with the Fox; The French
policy did better jump with his humor; and their manner in vanquishing their
Enemies in a pitched Battle, and forcing them upon the very Ramparts of their
Fortresses, did better please and second his Warlike virtue; and by whose good
intelligence and communication, the English growing discipline could not choose
but attain to a rare perfection; whereas the Spaniards might happily have
poisoned them by their Wiles and Subilties, and have corrupted them by their
Hipocritical false Alloy and Metal. Besides that the Liberty which is granted
by the French to those who are of a different opinion in the points of
Religion, was a great inducement to move his Highness rather to incline to a
peace with that Nation, since himself was ever so tender in matters of
Religion, as that he believed it did only belong to the Almighty to force the
Consciences of Men, at least to enlighten and inspire them by his Graces, which
are only capable to convince our reason.

A Peace with France Concluded and Proclaimed.
Finally, The Articles of peace with France, which were so much traversed by
the Spanish Faction, were concluded and signed by such Commissioners as his
late Highness had thereunto deputed; and on the other part by his excellency
the Lord Bourdeaux Ambassador of France: and on the eight and twentieth day of
the month of November next ensuing, the publication of the said Treaty was
proclaimed first at White Hall by the Heralds of Arms, the sound of Trumpets,
and other formalities accustomed on the like occasions; afterward in the
Palace-yard at Westminster, and in the other usual places in the City of London
where such like Proclamations are made; and on the self-same day it was also
published at Paris with a general applause and joy, at least of the Merchants,
who by the preceding misunderstanding between England and France were quite
ruined; and who by this conclusion of peace, found not only the Seas open and
free for them to trade in, but that the English of their worst Enemies became
their best friends; by causing a bundance to reign in their Rivers and
Territories, and by begetting an assured Commerce and Navigation in all those
Seas wherein the Navigation extended it self. Nor was the Lord Major of the
City of Paris less glad then the poor Citizens, who all of them witnessed an
equal joy and allacrity, finding themselves indulged by this Treaty of peace
from breaking their Ember-weeks, their Lent, and Fasting days, (as they call
them) since they would otherwise have been constrained (by reason of the
excessive rates which fish, butter, and cheese, and such other small ratable
wares were grown to) to have kept more fasting days then the Roman Kallendar
does enjoin them; which would have been a double Penance and an intolerable
mortification.

From all which they were freed by this happy Peace; and in acknowledgement
whereof, the Guns and Chambers from the Marketplace and Townhouse called the
Greve, as well as those from the Bastile or Tower, ecchoed forth the joy which
the Monsieurs conceived of this forerunner of the peace and tranquillity which
they have since enjoyed in the heart of their Dominions, and the Victories and
Conquests which they may yet atchieve by this happy Union, if their victorious
and gallant Prince does continue to accompany his Valor with those Virtues,
which are only capable not only to give him addition of Crowns, but also to
preserve them.

And lest I might insensibly out-slip my chief intent and purpose, and engage
my self in the giving of you a Relation of the chiefest and most important Wars
and Transactions of all Europe, should I recount unto you all the glorious
Actions which have happened since the Breach between England and Spain; in which
our late Protector bare away all the share at Sea, and a very great part also
by Land; as in our joint Conquests in Flanders, and our particular ones in
Lorain.

I shall therefore contract my pen a little, and only give you a Breviate of
the chiefest Actions, remitting the Reader to the more ample Histories both of
France and England, to peruse the Relation of those Victories, wherewith Heaven
has blessed this Alliance for these late Years past: In which the mature
deliberations and good Councels do more concern his late Highness, then the
execution of those gallant Attempts which proceeded from them; although in
truth both the one and the other may well be attributed to his great prudence,
and to those Blessings which it has pleased the Almighty to shower down upon
his admirable good fortune, of which take some few Instances.

The defense and good success at Jamaica.
It is apparent to all the world in what a manner his late Highness provided
for the preservation of Jamaica, notwithstanding all the force and attempts of
Spain and the Indies, to free that Island again, although they never yet did
set foot thereon, save to their own shame and confusion, having been driven
thence again with the loss of all their Cannon and Baggage; and the which
happened two several times, when as the Spaniards assembling all their Forces
in the Indies, came and encamped themselves in the Island with two or three
thousand men, had the time and opportunity to build and erect Forts, and for
the space of some days to settle themselves: Notwithstanding which, the
English as if they were but newly arrived from England to attempt a new
Conquest of the Island, were constrained to imbark themselves and put to Sea
again, the ways being not passable by Land; and in that wise compassing the
whole Island, they made their descent at the very place where the Enemies were
encamped, and assailed them in their Forts and Breast-works with a far less
number of men then theirs, and drove the Spaniards quite from them, and out of
the Island, killing and taking several of their men, and retaining several of
their great Guns and stately Standards as Trophies of their Victory. General
Mountegue his victory over the Spaniards at Sea.


Nor shall I enlarge upon that glorious Victory obtained by General Mountegue
over the Spaniards at Sea, which was the first that made this entrance into
that famous War, and gave the Spaniards to understand, that it would cost them
far more to transport their Gold from the Indies to Spain, then to dig it out
of the Mines, or to refine it: The ensuing Poem penned by one of the most
exquisite Wits of England, upon that subject, may better suffice to satisfy
the Reader of the gloriousness of the Fact, and the shaming Style which it is
described by, is more proper to express this Heroic Action, then my low and
unpolished Prose, which might happily obscure and detract from the luster and
splendour of so brave an Exploit; wherefore I have thought fit to insert the
Poem it self.

Upon the present War with Spain, and the first Victory obtained at Sea.
Now for some Ages had the pride of Spain,
Made the Sun shine on half the World in vain;
While she bid War, to all that durst supply
The place of those, her Cruelty made dye.
Of Nature's Bounty men forbear totaste,
And the best Portion of the Earth lay waste.
From the New World, her Silver and her Gold;
Came like a Tempest, to confound the Old.
Feeding with these the bribed Elector's Hopes,
She made at pleasure Emperors and Popes:
With these, advancing her unjust Designs,
Europe was shaken with her Indian Mines.
When our Protector looking with disdain
Upon this gilded Majesty of Spain;
And knowing well that Empire must decline,
Whose chief support, and sinews, are of Coin:
Our Nation's sollid virtue, did oppose
To the rich Troublers of the World's repose.
And now some months encamping on the Main,
Our Naval Army had besieged Spain.
They that the whole Worlds Monarchy designed,
Are to their Ports by our bold Fleet confined:
From whence our Red Cross they triumphant see,
Riding without a Rival on the Sea.
Others may use the Ocean as their road,
Only the English make it their abode:
Whose ready Sails with every Wind can fly,
And make a covenant with th'unconstant Sky.
Our Oaks secure, as if they there took root;
We tread on Billows with a steady foot.
Mean while the Spaniards in America,
Near to the Line, the Sun approaching saw;
And hoped their European Coasts to find
Cleared from our ships, by the Autumnal Wind.
Their huge capacious Gallions stuffed with Plate,
The laboring winds drives slowly toward their fate.
Before Saint Lucar they their Guns discharge,
To tell their Joy, or to invite a Barge.
This heard some Ships of ours, though out of view,
As swift as Eagles to the quarry flew.
So heedless Lambs which for their mothers bleat,
Wake hungry Lions, and become their meat.
Arrived, they soon begin that Tragic play,
And with their smoakie Cannon banish day:
Night, horror, slaughter, with confusion meets,
And in their sable Arms embrace the Fleets.
Through yielding Planks the angry Bullets fly,
And of one Wound hundreds together dye.
Born under different Stars, one Fate they have,
The Ship their Coffin, and the Sea their Grave.
Bold were the men, which on the Ocean first
Spread their new Sails, whilst shipwreck was the worst,
More danger now from men alone we find,
Then from the Rocks, the Billows, or the Wind.
They that had sailed from near the Anartick Pole,
Their Treasure safe, and all their Vessels whole;
In sight of their dear Country ruined be,
Without the guilt of either Rock or Sea.
What they would spare, our fiercer Art destroys,
Excelling storms, in terror and in noise.
Once Jove from Hyda did both Hoasts survey,
And when he pleased to Thunder, part the Fray:
Here Heaven in vain that kind Retreat should sound,
The louder Canon had the thunder drowned.
Some we made Prize while others burnt and rent,
With their rich Lading to the bottom went.
Down sinks at once (so Fortune with us sports)
The Pay of Armies, and the Pride of Courts.
Vain man, whose rage buries as low that store,
As Avarice had dug for it before.
What Earth in her dark bowels could not keep
From greedy hands, lies safer in the Deep:
Where Thetis kindly does from mortals hide,
Those seeds of Luxury, Debate, and Pride.
And now into her lap the richest Prize
Fell, with the Noblest of our Enemies.
The Marquis glad to see the fire destroy
Wealth, that prevailing Foes were to enjoy:
Out from his flaming Ship his Children sent,
To perish in a milder Element.
Then laid him by his burning Ladies side,
And since he could not save her, with her died.
Spices and Gums about them melting fry,
And Phenix-like, in that rich nest they dye.
Death bitter is, for what we leave behind,
But taking with us, all we love, is kind.
What could he more then hold for term of life,
His Indian Treasure, and his more prized Wife?
Alive, in flames of equal Love, they burned,
And now together are to ashes turned.
Ashes more worth, then all their Funerals cost,
Then the huge Treasure which was with them lost.
These dying Lovers, and their floating Sons,
Suspend the Fight, and silence all our Guns.
Beauty and Youth, about to perish, finds
Such noble pity in brave English minds;
That the rich Spoil neglecting, and the Prize,
All labor now to save their Enemies.
How frail our Passion's? how soon changed are
Our wrath and fury to a friendly care?
They that but now to gain the Spanish Plate,
Made the Sea blush with Blood, forget their Hate;
And their young Foes, while sinking, they retrive,
With greater danger then they fought, they dive.
With these returns Victorious Mountague,
With Laurel in his hands, and half Perue.
Let the brave General divide that bough,
Our great Protector has such Wreaths enough.
His conquering Head has no more room for Bays,
Then let it be as the whole Nation prays:
Let the rich Oar forthwith be melted down,
And the State fixed, by making him a Crown:
With Ermins clad, and Purple; let him hold
A Royal Scepter, made of Spanish Gold.
Take the particulars of the Fight briefly thus: The Spaniards were seven in
number, richly laden, about nine Leagues from Cadiz, coming from the West
Indies; one whereof was burnt another sunk, two run aground, two were taken,
one got away, with a Portugal Prize. In the ship that was burnt was the Marquis
of Badex, his Wife, and one Daughter. In one of the ships taken, was the young
Marquis his Brother, and another Sister, who was set on shore in Spain. The two
Brothers were brought to England with a great deal of wealth.

General Blakes destroying the Spanish Fleet at the Canaries.
And amongst these Victories which were gained at Sea against the Spaniards
since the breach of the Peace, that which was obtained by General Blake at
Sancta Cruza, in the Island of Teneriff, on the twentieth day of April, 1657.
was none of the least; in which Port there was sixteen great Vessels burnt and
sunk by the English; and the Spaniards Forts and Castles of the Isle, amidst
which there were five or six great Gallions, the Admiral, Vice Admiral, and
Rere-Admiral, the greatest part whereof were mounted with Brass Ordnance, and
laden some with rich merchandises from the Indies, and the others with
provisions and other manufactures to be transported thither, equipied in ample
manner both with Soldiers and Mariners.

All which having their Flags, Ensigns, and Streamers flying, were set upon by
the English, who in less then four hours time destroyed them all without the
loss of above sixty men; the greatest part of which were killed by the Musket
shot which played from the shore: But in lieu of them, the English with their
Cannon killed a great number of the Spaniards in their Breast-works and Forts.

Wherefore his late Highness who never recompensed virtuous and magnanimous
actions which bare praise, sent a civil Letter of thanks to General Blake, with
a Diamond Ring valued at five hundred pounds, and gave the Captain that brought
the news one hundred pound for a present. Moreover, according to his accustomed
Piety, be ordained a day of public Prayer and Thanksgiving to be set apart, to
return all Thanks, Acknowledgements, Praise, and Glory to the Almighty, for
this so happy and signal a success; and to supplicate his Divine Bounty to
bestow frequent and like Blessings upon the English Armadoes and Land Forces.

But the Sea being a Theater or Stage too unstable for so settled a valor and
constant aFortune, the traces and marks which she receives of Combats and
Victories are too soon worn out, and scare leave unto History, and to the
memory of men, wherewith to raise Monuments, erect Triumphs, and to transmit
unto posterity the truth of things; and although that virtue be the more
glorious, by how much the greater dangers it assails and surmounts; yet
however, as a flight is more easily made by Sea then by Land, where seldom men
fight at hand-blows, we have reason to give the first praise and honor to that
Element which first brought us forth, and whence we reap the most beneficial
necessaries toward our subsistence. In like manner, his late Highness's solid
policy was employed on such solid foundations where it might lay deep rooting,
and spread its large branches far and near without the apprehension of being
sapped or dug up.

May. 4. 1657. The English join with the French in Flanders under Sir John
Reynolds.
The French therefore being desirous to be revenged for their ill success at
Valenchenes, resolved the next summer to assault Montmedy, a strong Frontier
seated upon a Rock; but being not strong enough to keep the Spaniards in play
in Flanders, they separated part of their Army to prosecute the said siege; and
the English began to make their first landing in Flanders, Sir John Reynolds
was chosen by his late Highness to command the Body of the English Forces,
consisting in six thousand Foot, who happily landed in Picardy about the latter
end of May. And that it may not seem to be a digression from my subject, I
shall omit the particularizing of the siege, and the taking of Montmedy, and
shall only tell you, that the Marshal De la Ferte, who carried on that siege,
was not at all incommodated by the Enemy from without, during the whole siege;
nor durst the Spaniard ever set upon the French Army, thereby to attempt the
relief of that place. And although it would be a piece of injustice to dispoil
that warlike nation of their glory, yet all men know that their Army wanted
Foot extremely that Summer; but the English foot (which we must confess is the
best in all Europe) being joined to their Cavalrie, (which also excel all
others) there had not a more resolute and gallant Army been seen in France for
many years together.

His Highness Installment in the Protectorship.
And here by the way take notice of the Installment of his late Highness in the
Protectorship, which was on this manner, viz. On the twentieth day of the
month of June, in the year of our Lord God 1657. being appointed for the
Installment of his late Highness the Lord Protector; a large and spacious place
was raised at the upper end of Westminster Hall under the great window, in the
midst whereof, a Rich Cloth of State was set up, and under it a Chair of State
was placed upon an ascent of two degrees, covered with Carpets; before which
stood a Table with a Chair appointed for the Speaker of the Parliament. On each
side of the Hall, upon the said Structure there were seats raised one above
each other, and decently covered for the Members of the Parliament; and below
them there were Seats made for the Judges of the Land on the one side, and for
the Aldermen of the City on the other side.

About two of the Clock in the afternoon, his Highness met the Parliament in
the Painted Chamber, and passed such Bills as were presented to him; after
which they went in order to the place appointed in Westminster Hall: his
Highness being entered on the place, and standing under the Cloth of State, Mr.
Speaker did in the Name of the Parliament, present several things which lay
ready on the Table, unto his Highness, viz.

A Robe of Purple Velvet, lined with Ermines, being the habit, anciently used
at the solemn Investure of Princes; next a large Bible richly Gilt and Bossed;
and lastly a Scepter of massy Gold; which being thus presented, Mr. Speaker
came from his Chair, took the Robe and therewith vested his Highness, being
assisted by the Earl of Warwick, the Lord Whitlock, and by others; which being
done, the Bible was delivered to his Highness; after which Mr. Speaker girt
about him the Sword; and finally delivered his Highness the Scepter; which
being thus performed, Mr. Speaker returned to his Chair, and administered the
Oath to his Highness which had been prepared by the Parliament for him to take.

His Highness standing thus adorned in Princely State, Mr. Manton, by prayer
recommended his Highness Forces by Sea and Land, the whole Government and
People of these Nations, to the blessing and protection of God Almighty.

After which, the people gave several shouts, and the Trumpets sounding, his
Highness sat down in the Chair of State, holding the Scepter in his hand; and
whilst his Highness thus sat, a Herald of Arms stood aloft, making a signal to
a Trumpet to sound three times; after which, by direction and Authority of
Parliament, he did there publish and proclaim his Highness, Oliver Lord
Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Dominions
thereto belonging. Hereupon the Trumpets' sounded again, and the People gave
several Acclamations, with loud shouts, crying, God save the Lord Protector.

After a little pause, the Ceremony being ended, his Highness saluting the
Ambassadors, and public Ministers, proceeded thence in his Princely Habit,
(the Train whereof was borne up by six noble persons) and passed through the
Hall into the Palace-yard, the Earl of Warwick, carrying the sword before him,
where his Highness entered into his Coach, attended by his Life-guards and
Halberdeirs; the Officers of State; the Lord Major and Aldermen; all which
waited on his Highness back to White Hall; the whole Ceremony having been
managed with State and Magnificence, suitable to so high and happy a Solemnity.

Mardike taken by the English and French.
But to return to our History again, toward the end of the Summer therefore,
the united Forces of England and France took the Fort of Mardike, whereof Major
General Morgan took possession for the English, as the earnest of further
Conquests. The Spaniard hereupon conceived all the fears and jealousies which
so dangerous a neighborhood might justly cause, which obliged them in the
following month to resolve vigorously to assault the place, and to carry it by
force: But they were received with The Spaniards repulst at Mardike.
so much vigor by the English, as that they were manfully beaten off, and
constrained to retire with a great loss of their men, and of several Officers
of note.

General Blake dies in sight of Plymouth.
But the joy of these successes were moderated by the death of Admiral Blake, a
person who had so well deserved of England, as that he may be justly entitled
its Neptune, at the same time when as his Highness was its Jupiter and Mars;
who caused him to be buried with all the Demonstrations of Honor due to his
high demerits. He came within sight of Plymouth only to give up the Ghost, and
received this satisfaction at his death, to have bestowed all the Moments of
his life on that Element which had given him so much glory; just like unto
Moley Moluch that Illustrious King of Fess, who at the Article of Death, caused
himself to be carried in a Litter into his Camp, where he expired in the middle
of the Battle, as he was exhorting his Soldiers, and gained the Victory. In
like manner dyed General Blake in the midst of his famous Combats and
Victories, regretted by all England; and his late Highness, who had always an
especial care to cause those honors to be rendered to such great persons as
were due to their demerits, would have him stately interred, as the Earl of
Essex had been before; but General Blakes body was only brought with a Naval
Pomp by Water in State on the Thames from Greenwich to Westminster, as being a
more suitable Ceremony to his employment; and was there buried in Henry the
Seventh's famous Chapel.

Now the Spaniards disgusted at the firm footing the English had both gotten
and kept at Mardike, conceiving that against the next The Spaniards repulse
again from before Mardike.
Spring it might give them a greater inlet in Flanders, deemed they had best
to endeavor the driving of them thence betimes, before they should be too well
settled and established there; they resolved to assault them again, and
accordingly did set upon them very vigorously and resolutely with a party very
considerable, commanded by the pretended Princes of England, and the Marquis of
Coracene; but the English defended themselves so manfully and stoutly, as that
the Spaniards began to judge that as the French are good at taking of places,
so the English were constant in keeping and defending them; insomuch as that my
Dons were forced to return by weeping cross to Dunkirk, and take their last
farewell of Mardike.

St. Venaut taken by the English.
For they might very well have perceived by the business of St. Venant, that
the English were as good at the one as at the other; when as the Spaniards
having besieged Ardres, the English supposed that their advance into France was
only to retard their progress into Flanders, gave so resolute an assault to
St. Venant, as that they carried the place and had the sole honor of it; and
immediately marching toward Ardres, they drove away the Spaniards then with so
much courage and resolution as amazed the French. Wherefore this latter part of
the season having been employed in sowing the seeds of those Laurels which they
were to reap in the next years expedition in Flanders. His late Highness
recollected himself, to establish Peace and Tranquillity in England, and to
settle the foundation of a happy and glorious Government.

The Lord Henry Cromwell made deputy of Ireland.
And deeming that he could not more justly confer the eminent dignities of the
Land, save upon those who together with their blood had sucked from him the
seeds and buds both of Military and Politic Virtues; he created his younger
son the Lord Henry Cromwell, Lord Deputy of Ireland; who has always and does
still behave himself with so much conduct and applause in this so eminent a
charge, as that envy it self is constrained to confess, that his Fathers
wisdom could not have made a better choice.

Much about this time the Officers at Mardike, in whose breasts the rigor of
the winter did only excite the heat of those designs which they had conceived
in their souls, being desirous to employ part of that unprofitable season to
concourse and consult that Oracle of Prudence, who by the conduct of their
Heroic Projects did inspire into them the virtue and efficacy to compass their
designs, and to surmount even the greatest difficulties; Sir John Reynolds, I
say, Sir John Reynolds and others drowned.
Commander in chief, Colonel White, and some other Officers, being impatient
to enjoy the happiness of seeing and consulting his Highness, embarked at
Mardike for England; but the mischance was, that being assailed by a tempest,
they were unfortunately cast away upon the Goodwin Sands, and so frustrated all
the world of the expectations of those fair hopes which were conceived of their
valors, and of so fortunate beginnings.

On the fourth day of the month of February then next ensuing, his late
Highness repaired to the Lords House then in Parliament, and having sent notice
thereof to the House of Commons by the Keeper of the Black-Rod, the Speaker
with the Members came to the Lords House, where standing without the Bar, and
his Highness within under a Cloth of State, being animated with his wonted
vigor and resolution, succinctly told them without many preambles, The
Parliament dissolved Febr. 4. 1657/8
That it concerned his Interest as much as the public Peace and Tranquillity,
to terminate this Parliament, so that he was come thither to dissolve the same,
which was also immediately performed.

The City Militia settled again by his late Highness.
On the twelfth day of the month of March ensuing, his late Highness being
desirous to oblige the City of London in a particular manner, and at the same
time to witness unto them the care he took for their preservation and
tranquillity; he sent for the Lord Major, the Aldermen, and the other
Magistrates of the City, and having made them sensible of his tenderness and
care for their good; he also represented unto them, that during the Calm,
Tempests were most of all to be apprehended: so that at such times, the
requisite Orders and necessary preventions to resist Troubles, were to be
chiefly minded. For to this knowing and vigilant Spirit, to whom nothing was
dark or hid; this penetrating Light, who could pry even into men's hearts; and
who from out of his Cabinet could discover the most secret Plots which were
hatching throughout all Europe, declared unto them, That the Enemies both of
the State and of their City did not sleep, although it seemed they were quite
lulled: That their City was great and vaste, and like unto a corpulent Body,
nourished several ill humors: That he requested them for their own goods to
have a special care, and to bear a watchful eye: That he relied much upon their
Vigilance and Affection, and that all he could contribute thereunto on his
behalf, was to re-establish the City Militia, (which had been abolished through
the disorder of the foregoing Wars) and to desire them to appoint for their
Officers, persons of Honor and Probity, well-wishers and friends to the peace
and quietness of the State and public Good. Whereupon, the Lord Major and
Officers having returned thanks to his Highness for so signal a Mark of his
confidence and goodness toward them, proceeded to settle the Militia, and
repayed him with all the Obedience and Fidelity, which a Magnanimous Prince
could expect from Subjects, who were well versed in the duties they owed to a
Governor, who had rid them of a world of miseries, and delivered them from the
burden of a Civil War.

Nor was this precaution or forewarning of his late Highness without some
grounds or foundation; A Conspiracy discovered
for on the twenty fourth of the said Month, the quiet Serpent which hatched
its poison under the green grass, unawares let slip a Hiss, whereupon an exact
search was made throughout all London and Westminster for suspected persons,
diverse of which were secured and imprisoned. His late Highness knowing full
well, that States are maintained, as well by Justice as by force of Arms, and
that those chiefly stand in need of both, which through the divisions of Men's
minds, touching Spiritual concernments, seem to be in a continual apprehension
of those revolutions, which at all times have been caused in the World by the
means of these diversities of opinions. His Highness I say through the cause of
these apprehensions, and the discoveries which were already made, as aforesaid,
caused a High Court of Justice to be erected, A high Court of Justice erected.
according as it had been decreed by an Act of Parliament, and settled under
the great Seal of England: and truly it was high time for the Swords of Justice
to appear to chastise the Conspirators, since the sparkles of their fury had
spread themselves abroad through its veil, rather by their immoderate heat then
their sad looks; several persons of quality were imprisoned in the Tower of
London; and within few days afterward, just like unto a River, which is ready
to disgorge it self into the Sea, appears great and violent at its entrance, so
also the Conspiracy being just ready to break forth, appeared the more
formidable; and assured there were whole Regiments enrolled; and in the
midnight of Mayday they should have set fire on several parts of the City, and
whilst the confusion and horror thereof had seized all men, they should have
made a general Massacre of all those who would have opposed their fury. His
Highness like unto the Sun, elevated up to the highest Heaven, peirced through
all those other Spears, which were darkened to all other Lights but his, and
dissipated those Fogs and Mists, which the darkness of the Furies had spread
over the City of London; The Plot prevented
for on the morning of that fatal intended day, the Guards were doubled both
within and without the City; and about five of the Clock in the Evening, both
Horse and Foot were drawn up in Arms; the City Militia likewise keeping strong
Guards all that night, to prevent and hinder so sad and horrid an attempt.
Several Conspirators taken and sentenced, some condemned, others pardoned.
Mean while, all care was taken to discover the Firebrands before they could
enter upon their exploit; and as Enterprises wherein so many persons are
engaged cannot remain very secret or hidden, about seven of the Clock that
Evening, about forty of the Conspirators were taken and carried to White Hall,
and on the day following, several others of all kinds and conditions were also
apprehended; as Gentlemen, Merchants, Soldiers, and the like; many of which
were condemned to dye as Traitors: but his late Highness was so merciful to
pardon the most part of them, to the end that like unto a second Augustus he
might gain by his Clemency those hearts which would not be mollified by the
horror of the undertakings, nor the rigor and severity of the punishments.

On the second day of the month of June then next ensuing, there arrived a
strange accident on A Whale cast up in the Thames.
the Thames near London, to wit, a Whale of a prodigious bigness, at least
sixty foot, and of a proportionable breadth, was cast up. This great Fish,
which may be styled the King of the Sea for his bulk, came to do homage to his
late Highness, and by his Captivity and Death, to to let him see he was
absolute Master of that terrible Element which had given her a being.

Dunkirk besieged by the English and French.
But let us again return to the Wars in Flanders, and let us see how whole
Armies and Cities do there submit unto his Highness power, as well as the Sea
Monsters here. Now although taking and keeping of Mardike had been a sufficient
warning to the Spaniards to provide the Town of Dunkirk with all necessaries to
withstand a Siege, however that changed not the English their resolution to
attempt it; wherefore the United Forces both of France and England, under the
Command of those two glorious Chieftains, his Highness the Martial of Tureine,
Prince of Quesnoy, and his Excellency the Lord Ambassador and General Lockhart,
besieged the place, opened the approaches, and with an incredible diligence
perfected the Circum volution. The Spaniards attempt to relieve Dunkirk.
The Spaniards intending to attempt the relief of the place, being the Key of
all Flanders, and the chief Sea Port, assembled all their Forces, and made up a
considerable Army of sixteen thousand men, with a design to have forced the
Lines, and to have raised the Siege. To which intent, on the third of June they
came in a Body through Fuernes, and encamped within an English mile and a half
of the Martial Tureines Quarters, who being aware of their intent, the
following night brake up his Camp; and having left part of his Forces to make
good the Approaches, and to guard the Trenches, marched all night with fifteen
thousand men and ten pieces of cannon to encounter the Enemy, to decide in a
pitched Battle and an open Field, with an equal advantage, which party should
be victorious.

The English Foot drawn up into four great Battalions, and led on by his
Excellency the Lord Ambassador and General Lockhart, gave the first onset upon
five great Battalions of the Spanish Foot placed very advantagiously on three
high and great Downs, feconded by Don John of Austria himself, and the best of
the Spanish and Condean Forces, which they had purposely opposed unto the
English, conceiving them to have been as yet Novices in the manner of waging
War beyond Seas, and that for want of Discipline and Conduct they would soon
have been routed and disordered: But they were suddenly deceived in their
expectations, and found that they had to deal with persons of courage and
resolution, who as well in the Military Discipline, as in the Art of Courtship,
became perfect and absolve Masters even during their first years of
Apprenticeship; wherefore it was not without reason the Ancients did always
join Mars and Venus together, since toward the doing of gallant Actions, it is
sufficient to be passionate and resolute at the very entering into the Lists of
either of these Divinities. The English therefore assailing the Spaniards in
their advantageous stand as aforesaid, in the high Downs, did themselves alone
several times charge them, and sustained both the burnt of their Horse and
Foot, without ever being seconded or relieved by the French; who were so
confident of their Resolution and Valor, as that they would not seem to
entrench upon their Honor; besides that, they were loath to change their
Stands, least thereby they might bring themselves into a disorder: The Spaniard
beaten by the English and French
and finally, forcing the Spaniards to quit their stations, they put them to a
total rout and confusion. In which Charge up the Downs, Lieutenant Colonel
Fenwick, who showed a great deal of Gallantry in leading on his Excellency the
Lord Ambassador and General Lockharts Regiment of Blue, received his mortal
wound by a Musket bullet through the Body, whereof he dyed some few days
after. Diverse other persons of quality and note signallized themselves not a
little that day at the Head of their respective Regiments; as the Honorable
Colonel Lillingston, Lieutenant Colonel Fleetwood, Captain Devaux, who led up
a Forelorn of three hundred Musketeers, and gave the first Charge upon the
Spaniards: And of the Volunteers, Colonel Henry Jones, who at first charged
with Lieutenant Colonel Fenwick on foot, afterward on Horseback, when as
engaging too far, he was taken prisoner, but was afterward exchanged; and by
his late Highness at his return into England, made Knight and Baronet. Diverse
others did gallantly, who doubtless will not be forgotten in the English
Annals, and would be too large to be expressed in this Epitome relating only
to his Highness.

The Spaniards had at first resolved to have given no English man quarter, but
the fortune of the day made them glad to seek to the English for quarter
themselves; and it was well they could have it given them, although the English
were generous enough to have spared their Lives, had not the zeal of
overcoming, and their resolutions to perfect the Victory, taken up all their
care and passions. Finally, the Spanish Foot being totally routed, and coming
to surrender themselves to the English in whole troops, the English mistrusting
they had some other intentions and stratagem thereby, neither understanding
their Language nor design, continued charging them, and enforced them to seek
quarter elsewhere, preferring the gaining of the Victory to their own
particular interests; and so reaped an entire glory in their despising and
rejecting several prisoners of quality, who proffered themselves to them, and
for the which they might have had considerable ransoms.

And in the gaining of those high Downs on which the Spaniards were placed, the
English behaved themselves with so much gallantry and resolution, as that envy
and malice raised a report amidst the jealous and their Corivals, that it
savoured more of a piece of rashness then of a true valor; as if Soldiers
could possibly with too much zeal and readiness perform those Commands which
are given them.

To be brief, the victory wholly declared it self for the English and for the
French, and the whole Spanish Army was quite discomfited and pursued to the
very Gates of Fuernes, with the loss of three thousand five hundred men, two
thousand whereof were killed on the place of Suydcote, a Village seated in the
Downs between Dunkirk and Fuernes; and the rest were taken prisoners, and the
whole Army dissipated and disordered: which defeat having quite disheartened the
besieged, and depriving them of all hopes of relief, besides their Govornour
the Marquis De Leda being mortally wounded by two hand Grenades as he defended
the false bray, and of which wounds he dyed, constrained them to beat a Parley
fourteen days afterward, and to surrender the place on the fifteenth of July
1658. after the one and twentieth day of the opening of the Approaches. Dunkirk
taken and possessed by the English.
And in this manner this famous Seaport was reduced under the obedience of his
late Highness the Lord Protector, and was by the French put into the hands of
his Excellency the Lord Ambassador and General Lockhart, who was by his
Highness declared Governor of the same; and took possession of it with four
English Regiments which compose the Garrison thereof, and serve to defend the
Fort Mardike, and the new Fort Royal, begun by the Spaniards on the Channel of
Burges, and perfected by the English, now called Olivers Fort. The Inhabitants
of which place are so much taken with the superabundancy of the generosity and
goodness of their said Governor his Excellency the Lord Lockhart, as that they
repent themselves to have so much listened to the Spanish false persuasions and
fears, which they possessed them with, that they should be cruelly and
inhumanely treated by the English, purposely to make them resist the longer. It
had been well they had had so much care of their Souls, as they persuaded them
they had of their Goods and Fortunes.

But it would be too great a conquest to pretend jointly to overcome both the
Consciences of men and their Town to boot; the first is Gods due, and the other
Caesar's. And we may observe in Alexander the Great, whenever his Forces
became Master sof any place, he would always sacrifice to the Gods of the
Country; thereby to gain the Inhabitants hearts, and to induce their Gods to
become propitious to him. Numa Pompilius was a King before he was a Priest, and
although the Almighty has imprinted in all men a particular inclination to
adore him, yet however as concerning the manner of worshipping him, Policy
always preceded Religion, and ever kept the upper hand over her as much as she
possibly could.

King Henry the Fourth of France was a Protestant whilst he had overcome his
Enemies, but as soon as he was settled in the Throne, and that he was to Reign
as King, he seemingly returned Papist, and said, That the Kingdom of France
and City of Paris was worth a going to Mass. But when as superstitious and
zealous spirits counseled him to prosecute and pursue the Protestants, he
answered, That so long as they remained faithful and true to him, and continued
to stand by and serve him as they were wont, he would be as much a Father and
Protector unto him, as unto the rest of his good Subjects. These Maxims are
general and common, and admit of no distinctions save in Schools; nor need the
Spaniards with all their Hypocrisy and Pious malice to doubt, but that France
and England understanding each other well enough, and that the English
themselves are prudent enough to avoid that which may prejudice them, and to
tolerate whatsoever may advance and further their conquests, and beget a love
and esteem of their government. But to return to our former subject again, as
we have often before alleged, the joys of this World are always for the most
part mingled with some allayes of sorrow; the Almighty being willing to keep us
mindful that there are no perfect felicities to be enjoyed here on earth; and
that its only in heaven we are to expect an entire and perpetual Contentment
and Bliss. Wherefore the Laurels of the Victory obtained against the Spaniards,
and of the taking of the Town of Dunkirk, were soon withered, and the joys
abated, by the interposing of the Cypress-tree which death planted upon the
Tomb of the Illustrious and most generous Lady Cleypoll, second Daughter to his
late Highness; The Lady Cleypolls death.
who departed this mortal life to a more glorious and eternal one on the sixth
day of August this present year: a fatal prognostication of a more sensible
ensuing loss. For even as Branches of trees being cut and lopped in an ill
season, do first draw away the sap from the tree, and afterward cause the body
thereof to dry up and dye; In like manner, during the declining age of his late
Highness, an ill season, in which men usually do as it were reap all their
consolation from the youth and vigor of their Children, wherein they seem to
ruin by degrees as they draw near to their death, it unfortunately fell out,
that this most illustrious Daughter, the true representative and lively Image
of her Father, the Joy of his Heart, the Delight of his Eyes, and the Dispenser
of his Clemency and Benignity, dyed in the flower of her age; which struck more
to his heart then all the heavy burdens of his Affairs, which were only as a
pleasure and pastime to his great Soul. So great a power has Nature over the
dispositions of generous Men, when the tie of Blood is seconded by love and
virtue. This generous and noble Lady Elizabeth therefore departed this World in
despite of all the skill of Physicians, the Prayers of those afflicted persons
whom she had relieved, and the vows of all kind of Artists whom she cherished:
But she dyed an Amazonian-like death, despising the Pomps of the Earth, and
without any grief, save to leave an afflicted Father perplexed at her so sudden
being taken away; she dyed with those good Lessons in her mouth, which she had
practiced whilst she lived. And if there be any comfort left us in her death,
it is the hope we have, That her good Example will raise up the like
inclinations in the remainder of her Sisters whom Heaven has yet left us. I
shall not at all speak of her Funerals, for if I might have been credited, all
the Muses and their God Apollo, should have made her an Epicedium, and should
have appeared in mourning, which should have reached from the top of their
Mount Parnassus to the bottom of the valley thereof. But if this illustrious
Personages death received not the Funeral Rites which all great Wits were bound
to pay it, at least the Martial men did evidence, that the disgrace lay not at
their doors, but that they ought to reap all the glory, since they were not
backward to continue to brave and affront dangers in the behalf of an
illustrious and glorious Cause: wherefore the sad tidings of this noble
Personages death touched the gallant English to the heart, seeing they were
bereaved of their English Pallas, and of their Jupiters Daughter; they
therefore accused the Destinies for intrenching upon their Privileges, and
evidenced, that it appertained not alone unto them to dispose of the lives of
men. Their wrath therefore discharged it self on the first Objects which
presented themselves to their eyes: and the harmless Spaniards were so many
Victims offered up to this Amazons shrine; and as if Graveling had been her
stake, they were so eagerly bent to fire the Enemies out of the same, Graveling
taken by the French
as that the Spaniards were constrained to open their gates to give vent to the
fire and flame which suffocated them, and surrendered themselves to the
Conquering French Army; to whose share that place fell, and by whose force it
was solely gained.

As Physicians do agree that extreme Joy causes Death as well as excessive
Grief, so may we likewise say, That both these violent Passions united
together, must needs destroy the strongest person on earth; and that the
Conflict which they produce in a Soul, is capable to turn the edge of the
keenest weapons which are opposed to their resistance, and to make the fairest
champain Field become a parched barren plat of Ground. But what need we to seek
external Causes in a Death which brought along such violent ones with it, a
Cardinal of Richelieu, who was one of the best Tempers and Constitutions in the
world, did fall under the burden of the Anxieties and Agitations of the Mind.
The scabbard (as the Proverb says) being worn out by the sharpness of the
blade, must of necessity find a vent: And how could it otherwise choose, that a
Man who for the space of ten or twelve years together had opposed himself to
all the Injuries both of Time and of War, should not at length fall under the
activeness of a soul which seldom gave him any rest, which governed and
directed the Reins of three restive Kingdoms, unaccustomed to the noble and
famous Trappings of a Military Government; and who moreover was to direct and
guide the Consciences as well as the Bodies of Men, and their Reasons as well
as their Wills. It had not been considerable had the Interest of England only
required that his Cares had been limited within the Pales which the Sea
prescribes to her Precincts; But as the cause of the Disease was from abroad,
and that from the Closets of the Escurial, the Spaniards had employed their
false Piety as well as their Peru Gold, to discover and molest the repose of
England; so fire and flame was to be applied without, and it was necessary to
penetrate into the very secret causes of the evils. The People of the Cities of
the Continent were to be disabused, and the Soldiery were to be overcome in
open field. The Mines of Mexico were to be looked into, and the extent of that
Ambition was to be curtailed, which boasts it self both to see the Sun set and
rise.

These were vaste employments indeed of a large activity, to run through these
undertakings, the fervor of them was scorching; and although the Heavens did
second these lawful Designs with all its Graces, yet it could not without a
Miracle, and without destroying the secondary Causes, hinder the separation of
a Soul from a Body which it had so often employed, and so efficaciously
seconded the grand Affairs both of State and War for the Peace, Glory, and
Tranquillity of three Nations. Wherefore Nature it self did witness her grief
some two or three days before, by an extraordinary Tempest and violent gust of
weather; insomuch that it might have been supposed, that her self had been
ready to dissolve; or that the Masterpiece of Nature suffered a violent
agitation. And as the Death of the Sun of Righteousness was foretold by an
Eclipse of the Sun, which covered the surface of the whole Earth with Darkness:
In like manner, at the death of the People of Englands Hercules, both Force and
Nature were let loose to shake the very Elements; and by the reuniting of their
violence, like unto those who are ready to give up the Ghost, to leave some
marks of an extreme dissolution; all which is so lively set forth by the
quaintest Wit of these times, as that I shall not enlarge any further upon this
observation, Mr. E. Waller.
but shall only content my self to repeat unto you his Verses, who expresses
it more elegantly and copiously then my rough Prose can possibly reach to.

Upon the late Storm, and his Highness death ensuing the same.
We must resign, Heaven his great soul does claim,
In Storms as loud as his immortal fame.
His dying groans, his last breath shakes our Isle,
And Trees uncut fall for his Funeral Pile;
About his Palace there broad roots were tossed,
Into the Air, so Romulus was lost.
New Rome in such a tempest mist their King,
And from obeying fell to worshipping.
On Aetna's top, thus Hercules lay dead,
With ruin' Oaks and Pines about him spread;
Those his last fury from the Mountain rent,
Our dying Hero from the continent.
Ravish whole Towns and Forts from Spaniards reft,
As his last Legacy to Britain left.
The Ocean which so long our hopes confined
Could give no limits to his vaster mind:
Our bounds enlargement was his latest toil,
Nor has he left us Prisoners to our Isle.
Under the Tropic is our Language spoke,
And port of Flanders has received our Yoke,
From Civil Broyls he did us disingage,
Found nobler objects for our Martial rage;
And with wise conduct to his Country showed,
Their ancient way of conquering abroad.
Ungrateful then it were no tears allow,
To him that gave us peace and Empire too:
Princes that feared him grieve concerned to see,
No Pitch of glory from the Grave is free.
Nature her self took notice of his death,
And sighing swelled the Sea with such a breath;
That to remotest shores her billows rould,
The approaching fate of their Great Ruler told.
And truly I had need of all Parnassus his art to sweeten and mollify the
bitterness of this death, which causes my pen to fall to the ground, and would
cast up my Muse into a pitiful swound, did not all the rest of the Muses come
to her aid, and sprinkle her with some of that divine Water which nourishes
her, to make her revive again, and to restore her to her strength, to announce
to posterity the time, the day, and the manner when and how his late Highness
our great Oliver breathed his last.

After his late Highness had therefore been sick about a fortnight of a Disease
which at the beginning was but an Ague, on a Friday being the third of
September 1658. in the Morning, he gave all the signs of a dying person, and
for whom the Physicians had only Vows and Prayers in reserve: However, he
remained in that manner till about three of the Clock in the afternoon, when as
his Soul which had always retained the upper hand of his Body, preserved her
Empire till the last moment; he had always his wits about him, and his perfect
and entire understanding, and continued to deliver those Oracles which were
necessary to establish, after so great a loss, the Peace and Tranquillity of
England; and immediately to repair the ruins which so dangerous a dissolution
had threatened the State withal, and might cause in the minds of every
particular person.

His greatest and most important care was to name a Protector to be his
successor, which he did with Reasons so little savouring of his own interests
and worldly concernments, as that he testified, that being not content to have
sacrificed himself for the common good by the shortning of his days, he was
willing to consecrate his Children thereunto, by the lading of them with the
heavy burden of those weighty mysteries, which may well be termed a Royal and
Gilt Servitude.

Which succession was so necessary to the Peace and Tranquillity of the State,
that the Commonwealth and the Elective Kingdoms are constrained to imitate it;
and the successive Monarchies have oftentimes done more with a young Prince in a
Cradle, hung betwixt two Trees in the midst of their Camp, then they would have
done by the Orders and the Examples of the most expert Captains: But when as
the Age, Experience, and Deserts of a Son do unite and combine in the Love and
Memory of the virtues of a Father, what shall not betide so wise and worthy a
choice? and what shall not be thence expected? For who can with more reason
hope to be feared, loved, and obeyed by a whole Nation, save the worthy Heir of
him, who has rendered them so formidable, and who has ruled over, and governed
them so tenderly and meekly? How should unavoidable and strange changes have
been prevented, if domestic broils had not been shunned? and whom could we
thave better met with the resemblance of a Father, who never had his equal in
Prudence, Fortune, and Valor, save in a Son?

Politicians and Nature delight in the diversifying of their works; the one
produces few men alike, and the other delights in the condemning and
destroying of the designs of those who have preceded them, to the end, that
they may thereby show their own good parts, and rather appear Originals then
Copies. After the giving of these and like Orders, and the settling of the most
important Concernments of the State, this great Personage gave up the Ghost,
just like a man that falls asleep through the toil of a laborious task. The
ensuing night was serene and peaceful, like unto those who display their Sable
Veil spangled with Stars, to deck and wrap up the Sun after its long and
serious ardent Course.

He died in the midst of his Victories and Triumphs, after he had caused all
the fair fruits which shall be reaped for ever by England, as well in the
Continent, as within the Circumference of its Isles, to bud forth into Blossoms
and Flowers. He dyed in a Bed of Bucklers, and on a Pillow of Caskets; and
though the Wreaths of the Imperial Laurel which environed his head did wither
at the Groans of his Agony, it was only to make place for a richer Diadem
which was prepared for him in Heaven; and which must needs be more sumptuous
and resplendent, in that it is ingrafted upon that Christian humility wherewith
he did so constantly refuse a temporal Crown, which was due unto his deserts,
and which was proffered him several times by the People of England: and although
he be dead, yet he is living, nay, triumphing, and pronouncing Oracles to his
very last Groans, most clear and intellegible Oracles; and as being inspired by
the Spirit of the God of Truth, he dyed like a second Vespasian, who even on
his Deathbed continued to enlarge the Bounds of his Empire, and as long as he
had breath, ceased not to dispatch several Businesses of consequence; answering
the Physicians who reproved him, as the Emperor did, That an Emperor ought to
dye standing. Truly it is a great comfort at the Article of death, to dye
profitably for Heaven, and for the good of ones Country.

But before we close his Eyes, let us once more reflect on the constancy
wherewith he expects her last assaults, and with how much fear and trembling
this inexorable one sets upon him unarmed, and resolved to yield to her; and
however she was accustomed to cast her darts before him, yet she is afraid, she
trembles and hides her treacherous sithe, and never producing it till she sees
her blow sure. How oftentimes approaching him in the heat of Battles, armed
with despair and horror, was she constrained to turn her back, and to serve
him for an Instrument of Victory, whom she was resolved to have laid along? How
often has she been seen to change color, and to embrace the weaker party, to
the end she might show her force, and cut down a greater number of victimes?
Self-Interest is then made this insensible one grieve for those which she had
rashly slain on Olivers side, she lost by their not being, since her sacrifices
were there lessened, and that Olivers Arm alone was forced often to supply the
absence of his companions, or their ill fortunes. But as the love of this
step-dame was false, so likewise was it converted into rage as soon as his late
Highness caused Peace to succeed War, and that he outvied this furious Hag by
the undaunted courage; as then she brake off all intelligence with force and
horror, and she raised up from Hell all the malicious and subtle Furies, both
Envy and Treason came to her relief and aid; and by a sacrilegious Spell, she
has sought the Blood of Christ in the very Sacrament thereof to compose her
Poison; and by abominable wit chcrafts she sowed sedition in the Hearts of the
People; she bewitched the Wise, she blinded the Nobles, and finally she
therewith colored and cloaked all her most black and horrid Designs. But on
Oliver his late Higness, she could never fasten her baits, finding him always
armed with that Antidote which he renewed daily on the same Altars whence she
sucked her venom. He always opposed his Wisdom to her Craft, his Justice to
her Violence, his Prayers to her Impieties, and his Clemency to her Obstinacy.
The Tempest environed him on all sides, but he was in the Ark; his Enemies set
upon him whilst he was asleep, but the Character of God which was imprinted in
his Forehead, caused the Sword to fall out of their hands; and Goliath with his
Legions of Philistines fell down at the sole report of his Sling.

Finally, God has made him to pass safe through the lifted up Waves of his
Enemies, in which themselves were drowned; and in case the Sea did prove Red,
God be praised it was not by his Blood, nor by the stains of his Soul which
abhorred all kind of Cruelty. For if the Pardons which he granted were put in
an equal balance with the Deaths which happened during the time wherein his
Power was as yet but limited, it would be found, that he did not always give
ear to the prudent Politician, to abandon himself from the meekness and
generosity of his natural inclinations. Those who shall read the Histories of
such like Revolutions as these, will find that they never attained to so high
a pitch of Grandor, by such meek and merciful means, and so void of passion.
Wherefore his peaceable and natural Death has been also a Reward for his so
great a Moderation; nor can any one doubt but Heaven has had a particular care
of that life, which has been so often attempted and so desperately assaulted:
Not but that he would happily have rather chosen to have dyed with his Sword in
his hand, for the Glory of God and the Defense of his Country, as better
befitting his Warlike humor and Men of Courage, but Heaven had otherwise
evidenced its Miracles in his preservation. Nor had our Champion had the glory
to have wrestled with this powerful Enemy upon unequal terms, and in an estate
wherein the imbecility of the Spirit has no other relief but that of Grace
and Reason: This his preservation was also an effect of his Prayers, which he
had chosen with a great deal of prudence out of the holy Writs. He caused one
of his Gentlemen often to read the tenth Chapter of Matthew's Gospel; and twice
a day himself rehearsed the 71. Psalm of David, which has so near a relation
to his Fortune and to his Affairs, as that one would believe it had been a
Prophecy purposely dictated by the holy Ghost for him; or else that this great
Personage was a Mortal Figure of that great Favorite of God, who has done so
many mavelous things with such slender beginnings, passing through so many
obstacles, difficulties, and dangers: so likewise was it very just, that he
should enter into the eternal Rest on the like day wherein he had undergone
such great and glorious Labors and Dangers; and that he should triumph over
Death even in his weakness, at the like time wherein he had overcome her at her
fullest strength and greatest advantages. This conformity happened unto him as
well as to several other great Personages of the Earth, but by such observable
and reiterated notable actions, as that it is void of all doubt but the Heavens
had foretold by the Stars (which are the Looking-glasses and Rule of all famous
Men's Lives) the Events of our glorious Protectors successes. To instance in
some, Alexander the Great was born on the sixth day of April, on the like day
the famous Temple of Diana at Ephesus was burnt, presaging that fire which this
Conqueror should kindle in Asia. On a sixth day of April he overcame Darius
King of Persia in a Battle; and on the like day he departed this life:
whereunto there may be added, that his Birth was preceded by a famous Victory
which the Greeks his Subjects obtained on a sixth day of April against the
Persians hard by Plutea, and by a Naval Combat which also happened the same
day. So likewise Pompey was born and triumphed on a like day, to wit, the
thirtieth of the Month of September. Charles the Fifth the Emperor had also
such like observable Encounters: he was born on a twenty fourth of February,
and being twenty four years old, on the like day he obtained a great Victory,
in which a great King was taken prisoner. And on a twenty fourth day of
February, he was crowned Emperor by the Pope.

But not to look any further then our own Country, and into our own Histories;
It is observed that his late Highness our present Lord Protector, Richard, was
Installed in his Protectorship on the like day, being a third day of September,
when as Richard the First, that Famous King of England, so much spoken of in
the Histories by reason of his great Wit, Understanding, and Resolution, began
his Reign; an accident which cannot choose but promise a most favorable Omen
and good Token. In like manner his late Highness had more favorable and famous
days encountering together, then any of those foregoing Worthies which we have
specified.

The remarkable passages which happened on the like days in his Highness life.
For on a third of September he was confirmed in his Protectorship by the
Parliament. On a third of September he gained in Scotland that famous Battle of
Dunbar. On a third of September he gained that great Battle at Worcester. And
Finally, on a third of September his glorious life was Crowned with a peaceable
and resolved death in the midst of all his Triumphs, in his Palace at
White Hall, with all the comforts which good hopes could give in his posterity,
both to his Children, and to the Companions of his Fortune.

His late Highness Corpse removed to Somerset House.
The Corpse of his late Highness having been Embalmed and wrapped up in a sheet
of Lead, was on the six and twentieth of September, about ten of the Clock at
night, privately removed from White Hall to Sommerset-house, being only
attended by his own Domestic Officers and Servants, as the Lord Chamberlain,
and Comptroller of the Household, the Gentlemen of the Lifeguard, the Guard of
Halberdiers, and diverse other Officers and Servants, two Heralds of Arms went
next before the Corpse, which was placed in a morning Hearse, drawn by six
Horses; in which manner it was carried to Sommerset-House, where it remained
for some days in private until things were in a readiness to expose it in
State to a public view, which was performed with the following order and
Solemnity.

The manner of his Highness lying in State.
The first Room at Sommerset-House where the Spectators entered, was formerly
the Presence Chamber, completely hung with Black, at the upper end whereof was
placed a Cloth of State with a Chair of State under the same.

The second large Room was formerly the Privy Chamber, hung with Black, with a
Cloth and Chair of State under the same.

The third Room was formerly the Withdrawing Room, hung with BlackCloth, and
had a Cloth and Chair of State in it as the former; all which three large Rooms
were completely furnished with Scutcheons of his Highness Arms crowned with the
Imperial Crown; and at the head of each Cloth of State was fixed a large
majestique Scutcheon fairly painted and gilt upon Taffity.

The fourth Room where both the Corpse and the Effigies did lie, was completely
hung with Black Velvet, and the Roof was cieled with Velvet, and a large Canopy
or Cloth of State of black Velvet fringed, was plated over the Effigies made to
the life in Wax. The Effigies it self being apparel'd in a rich suit of uncut
Velvet, robed in a little Robe of Purple Velvet, laced with a rich Gold Lace,
and furred with Ermins; upon the Kirtle was the Royal large Robe of the like
purple Velvet, laced and furred with Ermins, with rich strings and tassels of
Gold; the Kirtle being girt with a rich embroidered Belt, wherein was a fair
Sword, richly gilt and hatched with Gold, hanging by the side of the Effigies.
In the right hand was the Golden Scepter, representing Government; in the left
hand the Globe, denoting Principality; upon the Head a purple Velvet Cap furred
with Ermins, signifying Regality: Behind the Head there was placed a rich
Chair of State of tissued Gold, and upon the Cushion which lay thereon was
placed an Imperial Crown set with precious Stones. The Body of the Effigies lay
upon a Bed of State covered with a large Pall of black Velvet, under which
there was spread a fine Holland Sheet upon six stools of tissued Cloth of Gold:
on the sides of the Bed of State was placed a rich suit of complete Armor,
representing his late Highness Command as General: at the Feet of the Effigies
stood his Crest according to the custom of ancient Monuments.

The Bed of State whereupon the Effigies did thus lie, was ascended unto by two
steps covered with the aforesaid Pall of Velvet, the whole work being compassed
about with Rails and Ballasters covered with Velvet; at each corner whereof
there was placed an upright Pillar covered with Velvet, upon the tops whereof
were the four Supporters of the Imperial Arms, bearing Banners or Streamers
Crowned. The Pillars were adorned with Trophies of Military Honor carved and
gilt; the pedestalls of the Pillars had Shields and Crowns gilt which
completed the whole work. Within the Rails and Ballasters stood eight great
Silver Candlesticks, or Standarts, almost five soot high, with Virginwax Tapers
of three foot long; next unto the Candlesticks there were set upright in
Sockets the four great Standards of his Higness Arms, the Guydons, great
Banners, and Banrolls of war being all of Taffity very richly gilt and painted.
The Cloth of State which covered the Bed of State, and the Effigies, had a
Majestic Scutcheon; and the whole Room was fully and completely adorned with
Taffity Scutcheons: several of his late Highness's Gentlemen attending
bare-headed round about the Bed of State in Mourning; and other of his
Highness's Servants waiting in the other Rooms, to give directions to the
spectators, and to prevent disorders.

His late Highness standing in State.
After which, his late Highness Effigies was several days shown in another
Room, standing upon an Ascent under a rich Cloth of State; vested in royal
Robes having a Scepter in one hand, and a Globe in the other, a Crown on his
Head, his Armor lying by him at a distance, and the Banners, Banrolls, and
Standards being placed round about him, together with the other Ensigns of
Honor: the whole Room which was spacious being adorned in a majestical manner,
and several of his late Highness's Gentlemen attending about the Effigies
bare-headed, in which manner the Effigies continued until the solemnization of
the Funerals.

The Funeral Solemnities performed at his late Highness's Interment.
On the three and twentieth day of November in the morning, the time appointed
for the solemnization of the Funerals of his late Highness, the several persons
of Honor and quality which were invited to attend the Interment, being come to
Somerset House, and all things being in a readiness to proceed; the Effigies of
his late Highness standing under a rich Cloth of State in the manner before
specified, was first shown to the company, and afterward removed and placed on
a Hearse richly adorned and set forth with Scutcheons and other Ornaments; the
Effigies it self being vested in Royal Robes, a Scepter in one hand, a Globe in
the other, and a Crown on the Head: after it had been a while thus placed in
the middle of a Room, it was carried on the Hearse by ten of his late Highness
Gentlemen into the Courtyard, where a very rich Canopy of State was born over
it by six other of his late Highness Gentlemen till it was brought and placed
on the Chariot, at each end whereof was a seat wherein sat two of his late
Highness's Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, the one at the Head and the other at
the Feet of the Effigies. The Pall which was made of Velvet and the white
linen was very large, extending on each side of the carriage and was born up
by several persons of Honor thereunto appointed. The Chariot wherein the
Effigies was conveyed, was covered with black Velvet, adorned with Plumes and
Scutcheons, and was drawn by six Horses covered with black Velvet, and each of
them adorned with black Plumes of Feathers.

From Somerset House to Westminster the streets were railed in, and strawed
with Sand; the Soldiers being placed on each side of the steeets without the
Rails, and their Ensigns wrapped up in a Cypress mourning Veil.

The manner of the proceeding to the Interment, was briefly thus.
The several distinctions observed in the Funeral Solemnities.
First, a Knight Martial advanced on Horseback with his black Truncheon tipped
at both ends with Gold, attended by his Deputy and thirteen men on Horseback,
to clear the way.

After him followed the Poor men of Westminster in mourning Gowns and Hoods,
marching two and two.

Next unto them followed the Servants of the several persons of all qualities,
which attended the Funeral.

These were followed by all his late Highness's Servants, as well inferior as
superior, both within and without the Household, as also all his Highness's
Barge-men and Watermen.

Next unto these followed the Servants and Officers belonging to the Lord Major
and Sheriffs of the City of London.

Then came several Gentlemen and attendants on the respective Ambassadors, and
the other Public Ministers.

After those came the poor Knights of Windsor in Gowns and Hoods.

Then followed the Clerks, Secretaries, and other Officers belonging to the
Army, the Admiralty, the Treasury, the Navy, and Exchequer.

After these came the Officers in Command in the Fleet, as also the Officers of
the Army.

Next followed the Commissioners for Excize, those of the Army, and the
Committee of the Navy.

Then followed the Commissioners for the Approbation of Preachers.

Then came the Officers, Messengers, and Clerks belonging to the Privy Council,
and the Clerks of both Houses of Parliament.

Next followed his late Highness Physicians.

The Head Officers of the Army.

The Chief Officers and Aldermen of the City of London.

The Masters of the Chancery, with his Highness learned Council at Law.

The Judges of the Admiralty, the Masters of Request, with the Judges in Wales.

Next to these the persons allied in Blood to his late Higness, and the Members
of the Lords House.

After them the Public Ministers of Foreign States and Princes.

Then the Holland Ambassador alone, whose Train was born up by four Gentlemen.

Next to him the Portugal Ambassador alone, whose Train was held up by four

Then followed the Lords Commissioners of the great Seal.

The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

The Lords of his late Highness most Honorable Privy Council.

After whom followed the chief Mourner, and those persons of quality which were
his Assistants, and bare up his Train. All the Nobles were in close Mourning,
the rest were but in ordinary, being disposed in their passage into several
Divisions, being distinguished by Drums and Trumpets, and by a Standard or
Banner born by a Person of Honor and his assistant, and a Horse of State
covered with black Velvet, and led by a person of Honor, followed by two
Grooms: Of which Horses there were eleven in all, four covered with black
Cloth, and seven with Velvet. These being all passed in order, at length the
Chariot followed with the Effigies, on each side of which were born six Banner
Rolls, twelve in all, by as many persons of Honor. The several pieces of his
late Highness Armor were born by eight Honorable persons, Officers of the Army,
attended by a Herald and a Gentleman on each side. Next followed Garter
principal King of Arms, attended with a Gentleman on each side bare-headed.

Then came the chief Mourner together with those Lords and noble personages
that were supporters and assistants to the chief Mourner.

Then followed the Horse of Honor in very rich Trappings embroidered upon
Crimson Velvet, and adorned with white, red, and yellow Plumes, and was led by
the Master of the Horse.

Finally, in the close of all followed his late Highness Guard of Halberdiers,
and the Warders of the Tower.

The Solemnity was managed with a great deal of State from Somerset House to
Westminster, many thousands of people being Spectators in the Windows and upon
the Scaffolds all along the way as it passed.

At the West Gate of the Abbey Church, the Hearse with the Effigies thereon was
taken off again from the Chariot by those ten Gentlemen who placed it thereon
before, and in their passing on to carry it into the Church, the Canopy of
State was by the former six Gentlemen born over it again: In which stately
manner it was carried up to the East end of the Abbey, and there placed in that
Magnificent structure which was purposely erected there to receive it; where it
is to remain for some time exposed to public view. The Corpse having been some
days before Interred in Henry the Seventh's Chapel in a Vault purposely
prepared for the same, over which a costly Monument is preparing.

Thus have you a brief Relation of the last Ceremonies of Honor which were
performed to the Memory of his late Highness, who by his Heroic Acts had so
well deserved, as that my dull pen not able to express them, I shall remit the
Reader to censure my endeavors, and submit to those that shall hereafter
undertake to present the World with a larger Chronicle.

FINIS.
THE CHARACTER of his late Serene Highness, OLIVER, Late Lord Protector: With
several Reflections on the foregoing History.
SEeing Philosophers are of opinion, that the Resemblance of Children to their
Parents, as well in their bodily shapes and features, as in the Inclinations of
their Souls, is produced by one and the self-same Cause; chiefly grounded upon
this reason, That the one is the Representative of the other. And seeing
moreover; that we may not attribute unto a material Cause an immaterial Effect,
such as are all the operations of a Rational Soul; they reject the power of a
forming virtue, the the Imaginary one, the Constellation of the Planets, and
the qualities of the Seed. To fix upon a more sublime mystery, whereby God
would have the Legitimateness of Children and Nephews to be manifested, rather
by the better part of man, which is the Soul, then by his Complexion, his
Behavior, his Speech, and the shape of his Body. And that such glorious souls
as are wrapped up as it were in the body, should like unto a transparent sun
penetrate through those thick clouds, and by that resplendency which they
infuse through the whole body, should attract the esteem and veneration which
they beget in men; either in the vulgar sort, who are only taken with the
outside, or in the malicious and envious, who endeavor to smoother those
Talents in others which they do not possess themselves.

Which truth, that we may the better make good, it will not be amiss, having
first represented unto you some of his late Highness the Lord Protectors
memorable Acts, to demonstrate unto you the greatness of his soul, and how well
it was placed, whereby all its Heroical virtues may, as through a Crystal
glass, appear unto the eyes of the whole world.

In this wise all Hystoriographers have proceeded, not only in their
describing of the lives of Illustrious Personages, but also in subduing of
Cities and Towns, Foretresses, and places of Consequence, which no sooner had
received the Conquerours yoke, but the Origin and Foundations were narrowly
pried into, the manner of their being fortified was described, the form of
their being besieged, the assaults which they sustained, and the glory which
they acquired even by their surrendry upon honorable terms; whereas on the
contrary, inconsiderate ones are quite neglected, their appellations and
reductions being scarce deemed worthy to be specified in a History.

In like manner, since death after several vain attempts and successess
assaults has at length bereaved us of our Illustrious late Lord Protector, we
shall give you the Character of his person, to let you see how much he
resembled his glorious predecessors. And howbeit we may thereby somewhat
diminish and detract from his glory, however so beautiful a soul as his was,
accompanied by a body participating of all those Organs which were succeptible
of such high and admirable operations, could not choose but produce the ensuing
glorious effects?

In his person he somewhat exceeded the usual middle stature, but was well
proportioned accordingly, being of a becoming fatness, well shaped, having a
masculine face, a sparkling eye, both courteous and harsh at once, according as
there was occasion; hardy and fierce in combats and reprehensions, tempered in
councels and meek, promising to the afflicted and suitors. He was of a strong
constitution, and of an active body well disposed, an enemy both to ease and
excess; and although in his youth he was capable of, yet he used not those fair
and bewitching pleasures which a country (where idleness and wantonness did
reign) does afford to vigorous constitutions with a great deal of mediocrity in
the War, he was active, vigilant, and circumspect; and although he was
doubtless one of the best head-pieces in the world, yet he disdained not to
confer and take counsel with others, even in Affairs of the least concernment.

His greatest delight was to read men rather then books, and his Eloquence
which was both Masculine and Martial, was rather a natural gift then an effect
of art, wherein he always mingled some passages of the holy Writ, in which his
piety had amply instructed him; to which most charming part as well as to his
Sword, he owed most of his Conquests and Victories; being always accustomed to
exhort and animate his Soldiers at the undertaking of any great enterprise,
and before the giving of a battle, so likewise after he had gained the victory,
he himself did express unto God his thankfulness and acknowledgements with so
profound an humility, as that he attributed unto God alone all his good
success; and did constantly refuse all those triumphs which were prepared for,
and proffered to his valor. He had an especial care to have Piety and Godliness
reign in his Armies, and punished as a most enormious crime, those who took
Gods name in vain. Moreover, he loved his Soldiers as his Children, and his
greatest care was to see them provided for with all necessaries requisite; by
which foresight and provividence, he was the better able to execute that severe
punishment which he usually caused to be inflicted on those who plundered and
spoiled the Peasants, for which crime he would not have pardoned his
ownbrother; and on the other side he was always most bountiful and liberal to
his Soldiers, and those Pensions which are yet paid daily unto the old
Soldiers, unto their Widows, and to the maimed and hurt men, may save those
charges which some Princes have been at to hire persons to weep and lament at
their Funerals, and over their Tombs.

See History and Policy reviewed.
He took great delight to discourse of the Affairs of the World, and his own
judgment did furnish him with such exact resolutions concerning the Government
of his Estates, and touching the interests of other Princes, as without the
entering into their Cabinets, or partaking of their Counsels, he discoursed very
pertinently of their Affairs, and foretold their several issues and events. He
likewise was an excellent Phisionomer, and having once seriously considered any
one, he was seldom deceived in the opinion he conceived of him.

He married into the ancient and noble family of the Bourchers, whence the
Earls of Essex were descended; his marriage bed was blessed with many Children,
none of which did ever degenerate from the eminent virtues of their most
Illustrious Father. His eldest son named Ricard has succeeded him in the
Protectorship; his younger son named Henry, being at this time Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland; both of them capable to follow their Fathers glorious footsteps,
and to perfect and crown such hopeful, promising, though difficult, beginnings;
their Father having as it were divided, shared, and left by inheritance unto
their youth (swelling with mavelous hopes) that most exquisite Quintessence
of two great Talents, which he had acquired by his age and by his experience;
so that the one of his sons may be styled the Jupiter, and the other the Mars
of England.

He had four Daughters, all of them Ladies of a most eminent and virtuous
disposition: The Lady Bridget first married unto the Lord Ireton, in his life
time Lord Deputy of Ireland, a Personage of sublime worth; and afterward
espoused unto the Lord Fleetwood, sometimes Lord Deputy of Ireland, and at
present Lieutenant General of all his Highness Forces. The Lady Elizabeth his
second Daughter, married unto the Lord Cleypoll, and dyed a little before her
Father; of whom we shall speak hereafter. The third, the Lady Mary, espoused
unto the Lord Viscount Faulconbridge. And the youngest, the Lady Frances, at
present widow of the Lord Robert Rich, Grandchilde to the late Earl of Warwick.

Nor did the change of his late Highness Fortunes in the least decline or
diminish the tenderness and affection which he ever bare toward the worthy
Mother of so numerous and hopeful an issue; and that absolute power which he
had over all his Dominions, never gave him the least desire to captivate any
heart, save that which God had given him in marriage. And that which is the
most to be admired at, and seems to be the sum of all bliss, is, that the
Almighty lent his late Highness so much life as to see all his Children
disposed to the most gallant personages, and allied to the most Illustrious
Families of England; which are as so many props of his Fortune, and Fences
against the enviers of his Virtue.

He was an enemy to vain gloriousness and ostentation, and although he was all
as it were fire, that is, of a passionate constitution; yet he had so overcome
his passions, that he was seldom or never moved but when there was a great
cause given: so likewise was he more subject to repress and keep in, then to
give way to his passion. The actions of his body denoted those of his mind,
his actions were in a manner without motion, and without any forcings of the
body; in like manner his mind was not at all agitated, nor his expressions
precipitated; sweetness and tranquillity accompanied his thoughts and his
words; but when there was occasion to carry a business, he expressed himself
with so much vigor, as gave to understand, that he was not easily to be
dissuaded from the thing he had once resolved.

In like manner during the whole course of the War, he never harbored the
least thought of changing of parties. And as for Ambition, which is the only
passion whereof envy it self seems to accuse him, the effects thereof were so
inconfiderable and unnecessary unto him, nay, so unpleasing and unwelcome; and
which is more, he so often refused the pomps, delights, and grandours which
were proffered him, that all the world must needs confess, that where Nature
could claim so small an interest, the master and directer of Nature must needs
have had a great share. Wherefore we may aver with a great deal of reason, That
in case he has hoorded and laid up Treasures, it has been in the Intrals of
the Poor of all Sexes, and of all Nations, of all Professions and Religions,
both at home and abroad; insomuch, that it has been computed, that out of his
own private instinct particular Motions and pious Compassion, he distributed at
least forty thousand pounds a year in Charitable Uses, out of his own purse,
out of such Moneys as the Commonwealth did allow him for his Domestique
Expenses, and for the maintenance of his State, and the Dignity of his Person,
Family, and the keeping up the splendor of his Court.

And the better to illustrate this matter, we shall insert an Essay of two
examples of Generosity and Gratitude, which are not to be paralleled, save in
the persons of Thomas Lord Cromwell, his late Highness's predecessor, in Henry
the Eighth's Reign, and in the person of his late Highness, Oliver Lord
Protector.

An example of gratitude and generosity in the Lord Tho. Cromwell.
In those glorious days, when the English young Gentry endeavored to outvie
their elder Brothers, by undertaking far and dangerous journies into Foreign
parts, to acquire glory by feats of Arms, and experiencing themselves in the
Military Discipline; Thomas Cromwell a younger Brother, to better his knowledge
in Warlike Affairs passed into France, and there trailed a Pike, accompanying
the French Forces into Italy, where they were defeated at Gattellion; whereupon
our English Volantier betook himself to Florence, designing to pass thence home
again into England; but having loft all his equipage, and being in a
necessitated condition, he was enforced to address himself to one Signior
Francisco Frescobald an Italian Merchant, who corresponded at London; and
making his case known unto him, Frescobald observing something remarkable, and
a certain promising greatness in the Features, Actions, and Deportment of
Thomas Cromwell, who gave an account of himself with so candid an ingenuity, and
in such terms as beseemed his Birth, and the Profession he then was of: whereby
he gained so much upon Frescobald, as inviting him home to his house, he caused
him to be accommodated with new Linen and Clothes, and other suitable
necessaries; kindly entertaining him, till such time as he testified a desire
to return for England; when as to complete his Generosity and Kindeness, he
gave Mr. Thomas Cromwell a Horse, and sixteen Duccats in gold, to prosecute his
journey homewards.

In process of time, several disasters and Bankrupts befalling Signior
Frescobald, his Trading and Credit was not a little thereby impaired; and
reflecting on the Moneys which were due unto him by his Correspondents in
England, to the value of 15000. Duccats, he resolved to pass thither, and try
whether he could happily procure payment.

During which interval of time, Mr. Thomas Cromwell being a person endowed with
a great deal of Courage, of a transcendent Wit, hardy in his undertakings, and
a great Politician, had by these his good qualities gotten himself entrance and
credit at Court, and highly ingratiated himself with King Henry the Eighth;
having advanced himself to almost as high a pitch of Honor, in as short a
time, in a manner, as his late Highness did.

The Lord Thomas Cromwell therefore riding one day with a great train of Noble
Men toward the Kings Palace, chanced to espy on foot in the streets Signior
Frescobald, the Italian Merchant, in an ill plight: however, he immediately
alighting from his Horse, embraced him before all the world, to the great
astonishment of the beholders; and chid him, that at his very arrival he came
not to visit him. Frescobald being astonished at so unexpected an encounter,
and receiving so signal a favor from a personage he could not call to mind he
had ever known, was quite surprised; and my Lord Cromwells pressing affairs at
Court not permitting him the while to acquaint him further who he was, only
engaged him to come and dine with him that day. Frescobald full of amazement,
enquired of the attendants who that great personage might be? And hearing his
name, he began to call the Feature of his Face, and the Idea of his Person to
mind; and so by degrees conceiving with himself it might happily be the same
Mr. Thomas Cromwell whom he had harbored at Florence; he enquired out his
Lordships habitation, and attended his coming at Noontide, walking in his
Courtyard. No sooner was the Lord Thomas Cromwell entered the same, (attended by
several persons of quality, and officers of the Crown) but speedily alighting
from his Horse, he embraced his friend Frescobald in the same manner he had
done in the morning; and perceiving that the Lords which accompanied him were
amazed at such a disproportioned familiarity, he told them that he was more
obliged to Frescobald then to all the men in the world, owing unto him the
making of his Fortune; and so proceeded to relate unto them the whole story
which had befallen him at Florence. So great a delight do generous minds take
to recount their foregoing Misfortunes, when their Grandor has elevated them
to such a pitch, as that they triumph over Shame, and are incapable of
Ingratitude.

Frescobald was treated at Dinner with all the tenderness he could expect from
so great a personage, and so good a friend; after which being carried up by the
Lord T. Cromwell into his Closet, he was there presented with four bags of Gold,
each containing four hundred Duccats, in return of his former civilities: which
Frescobald (being of a gallant spirit) at first refused, but after several
contestations was constrained to accept as an acknowledgement from the Lord
Cromwell; who, moreover enquiring of him concerning his coming over, and
affairs in England; and understanding his Losses, and that there were Moneys
due to him, caused him to write down his Debtors names; and by his Secretary
summoned the several Merchants which were indebted to Frescobald (upon pain of
his displeasure) to clear their Accounts with him, and to pay him within the
space of fifteen days; which was accordingly performed: only Frescobald freely
forgave them the Use.

Over and above all which, the Lord Thomas Cromwell endeavored to persuade his
friend Frescobald to have remained in England the rest of his Days, profering
to lend him a stock of 60000. Duccats to trade withal: But Frescobald being
overcharged with all those grand obligations which the Lord Cromwell had
conferred on him; having by his Lordships Generosity acquired enough to keep
him from being necessitated all his life time; and deeming that the trading in
good Works was incomparably more sure and gainful then in the richest Wares and
Merchandises, being resolved to quit Trading, and to end the rest of his days
peaceably and quietly, he obtained leave of the Lord Thomas Cromwell to depart
toward his own Country, freighted with so great obligations as caused in him
a generous shame.

But the Almighty does not always recompense the fruits of good Works here on
Earth, often repaying the greatest with the least rewards; and Heaven delights
in the exercising of its great Virtues, by the Vices which are thereunto
opposite: and as the most noblest Creatures are the slowest in the attaining to
their perfections, so the Almighty does not immediately cause those Fruits to
ripen, which are sowed here below by Christian Charity.

The Lord Tho. Cromwels Seed, Destiny, and end.
Wherefore to return to the Lord Thomas Cromwell, who had made the Match
between Anne of Cleve and King Henry the Eighth, you shall see how he was
rewarded for his Generosity and good Services; for this Princess Anne of Cleve,
conceiving a certain womanish Jealousy, she knew not why nor wherefore,
against the Lord Thomas Cromwell, save only that she apprehended he had too
great a power and sway with the King; never left off soliciting and
importuning of him, till he caused the Lord Thomas Cromwell to be beheaded; by
which sad compliance, the King lost the best Supporter of his Crown, and the
faithfullest of his Servants and Subjects. The Lord Thomas Cromwell dyed
without Heir Males, leavingone only Daughter, espoused to one Mr. Williams a
Gentleman of Glamorganshire, of a good Family; who, as we have before said,
inherited little of his Father, save his Virtues, besides what his own Deserts
had procured him, and what he might promise himself by the Match with this
Heiress the Lord Thomas Cromwels Daughter: (from whence our Lord Protectors are
lineally descended) and who was the lively representative of her Father, and
the very pourtraiture of his great soul, as the Lady Cleypool was of his late
Highness the Lord Protector.

Now that you may know on what occasion How the Name of Williams came to be
changed into that of Cromwell.
the Name of Williams came to be changed into that of Cromwell; it happened
when as King Henry the Eighth was in the midst of his Splendour, Pomp, and
Magnificence, wallowing in the pleasures of a sumptuous Entertainment at Court,
Mr. Williams (who had been a retainer to the late Lord Thomas Cromwell) made
his appearance before the King in deep Mourning, like a dark Cloud eclipsing
the Sun at Noontide. The King casting his eye upon so unexpected and dismal an
Object, (which seemed to reproach his rash fault) was surprised and offended,
at the interrupting of his Pleasures, by Williams so unseasonable apparition;
wherefore the King asked him how he durst appear at Court in that garb?
whereunto Williams replied with a sad but assured countenance, That not only
himself, but the King and all the Court had reason to mourn for the loss of the
greatest and faithfullest of his Subjects and Servants, whose Death himself
might one day chance to regret, when he should stand in need of his Councels
and Fidelity. But the King whose thoughts were at that time taken up with his
Pastimes, wished Williams to be gone, and to get himself cured of his Frenetick
Mallady.

Some while after troubles arising, and the King finding himself in a strait
for want of so faithful a Minister of State as the late Lord Thomas Cromwell
was, whose life he had so inconsiderately taken away; began to reflect on the
loss he had sustained; and how requisite it was, for Princes, and great
Potentates, to retain near their Persons, Men of Knowledge, Worth and Fidelity;
and calling to mind the action and discourse of Williams, conceiving that it
could not proceed but from a great soul endowed with extraordinary virtues, and
such a one as might be useful and serviceable to him; he sent for him up to
Court, and commanding him to take the name of Cromwell upon himself, (unto whom
he had testified so much Fidelity and Gratitude) he invested him with all the
Offices and Charges the late Lord Thomas Cromwell enjoyed near his person; and
re-instated him again in all his Goods and Lands which had been confiscated; so
that the Lord Williams assisted in the Kings Council, as his Father in Law the
Lord Thomas Cromwell before had done.

His late Highness descent.
From this Noble Lord Williams, alias Cromwell, and the Illustrious Daughter of
the renowned Lord Thomas Cromwell, his late Highness and our present Lord
Protector are lineally descended; in whom the Almighty has raised up and
ripened those generous virtues of their predecessors, and has elevated and
spread their branches as high, as their deep roots had taken profound and
vigorous Foundations.

So that to complete our parallel, we may observe by the fruits of this
Illustrious Stock from whence his late Highness is descended, whether they
retained their accustomed Generosity and Clemency; which we will not go about
to prove by the Military Acts, in which they have outvied their Predecessors;
nor by their Politic and prudent Government of the State, in which they have
at least equalized them; but by their private and domestic actions, since the
resemblance of Children to their Parents may be more observed by the Features
of the Face, then by the course of their lives, which are subject to vary,
either by the inconstancy of Fortune, or the Communication of other men.

An example of his late Highness gratitude.
To come therefore to his late Highness the Lord Protector, and signalize his
gratitude; we shall instance in the person of one Duret a French attendant of
his Highness during his General-ship; who served him with so much Fidelity and
Zeal, as that he entrusted him with the managing and conduct of the greatest
part of his domestic Affairs; always retaining him nigh his person, bearing
so great an affection toward him, and reposing so entire a confidence in him,
as during his late Highness's great sickness which he had in Scotland, (and
whereof it was thought he would have dyed) he would not be served by any one,
nor receive any nourishment, or any thing else that was administered unto him,
save from the hands of Duret, who both day and night continued to watch by his
Master; tending him with a special care and assiduity, not giving himself a
Moments rest until his late Highness had recovered his perfect health; which
long and continual watches of Duret, and the pains he had taken in the
administering unto his Master, plunged him into a sad fit of sickness; during
which, this faithful servant received all the acknowledgements which his good
and zealous services had demerited, his late Highness applying all the possible
cures he could, not only by his commands, but by his personal visits, (so often
as his urgent Affairs would permit him) to comfort Duret, and to see all things
applied, that might conduce to his recovery: but Durets hour being come, he was
content to lay down his life in his Masters service; and the Physicians having
quite given him over, his late Highness would needs render him his last good
offices, by comforting him at his death, by his sensibleness of his good
services, and the extreme zeal and affection he had born to his person; which
although he could not requite unto him, yet his Highness assured him he would
manifest his acknowledgements thereof unto his Parents and Kindred: Whereunto
Duret replied, That the honor he had received in having served so good and
great a Master, and the glory he reaped in having laid down his life for the
preservation of his Highness, and of so good and glorious a Cause, was extreme,
satisfactory unto him in his death. That he had a Mother and a Sister, with
some Kindred in France, who were unworthy his Highness thoughts, or reflecting
on them; however that he remitted them to his Highness gracious consideration.
And so Duret, his good and faithful servant, breathed his last.

In which contract of grief, and resolution of acknowledgement, his late
Highness may be said to have harbored the same thoughts as Henry the Eighth
did; persuading himself that he had been the Author of Durets death, though in
a far innocenter way; However his late Highness retained all the resentments
and sensibleness of the acknowledgements and gratitude, expressed by his
generous predecessor the Lord Thomas Cromwell, toward his dear Friend
Frescobald.

For his late Highness immediately sent over For Durets Mother, Sister, and two
Nephews out of France, and would have the whole Family of the Durets to come
and establish themselves here in England; that he might the better manifest his
Love and Gratitude in their persons, toward his deceased faithful servant. And
whereas by reason of the continuance of the Scotch Wars, his late Highness was
at that time, as it were confined to the North, he wrote unto her Highness, the
now Lady Protectoress Dowager, his wife, that she should receive and use Durets
Mother, Sister, and Allies, accordingly as she praised the good offices of his
deceased faithful servant, to whose cares, pains, and watchings he owed the
preservation of his own life; and that she should proportion that kindness which
during his absence she should show unto them, unto the love which she bore unto
him; insomuch, that Durets Mother was by her Highness admitted into her own
Family, and seated at her own Table; his Sister was placed in the rank and
quality of a Maid of Honor to her Highness; and his two Nephews were admitted
to be her Highnesses Pages; whereby the Almighty Crowned Durets good and
faithful services toward his Master, and his piety and observance toward his
Mother and Sister, whose only support he was in his life time, with the rich
Flowers of Prosperity, and with the Fruits of Fortune; advancing them as fast
as the sad destiny did his precipitated death.

And no sooner was his late Highness returned into England after the conquest
of Scotland, and the glorious Victory he had obtained at Worcester, full
freighted with the resplendency of his noble achievements; but he desired to
see Durets Mother, Sister, and Nephews, enquiring how they had been received,
and treated; and whether they were well pleased to be in England; and as soon
as they appeared in his presence, he could not retain his generous tears for
the loss of Duret; nor could he cease to testify his inward grief for him,
comforting the good old Gentlewoman Mrs. Duret, by the mouth of his Children
who spoke French, telling her, She had not lost her son, although dead; for
that himself would be her son, since the preservation of his life had its being
from her entralls; that both her and his Duret was with a better Master; a
Master, who was his Master also; and whose recompenses and rewards were for
greater and more assured then these worldly ones. And that the great thoughts
of his heart might not lose their force and energy, by his employing of
another tongue to express them; this great Personage who never made use of the
French language to entertain the Ambassador of Kings and Princes withal, did
put himself to the trouble of learning some French words, with which he always
was used to cheer up and comfort the good old Woman whenever he met her: and
he that was wont to swim in the blood of his enemies, and could look with an
undiscomposed brow on thousands of men, and of his friends, lying dead on the
Field after a battle, had so much tenderness for the loss of one of his
domestique Servants, as that he could not refrain from tears when he beheld any
of Durets relations. Nor need we to wonder hereat, since his late Highnesses
general spirit contained as well private as public Virtues. And his Reason
which was always mistress of his Passions, knew full well how to employ them
on such occasions, and at such times as they were most requisite and
commendable: to let us see, That the Dignity of a General and a Protector, had
not made him relinquish the quality of a Man; and that Maxims and Reasons of
State had forced several things from him, which were absolutely repugnant to
his natural inclinations. Besides, this great Politician knew, that the
greatest part of Famous Men, which Fortune had elevated to the top of her
Wheel, were for the most part come to untimely ends by the corruption of their
domestique Servants, or the treachery of their intimatest Friends and bosom
Favorites: in regard whereof, his late Highness lamented the more the loss of
this his Faithful Servant.

Nor need we to wonder hereat, since Fortune had heaped all the perfections of
Virtues in his great Soul, which he evidently manifested, by his so orderly,
and peaceably re-uniting, and as it were, matching together the Virtues both of
War and Peace; the ruffness and harshness of War, with the tenderness of
Nature; their Licentiousness with Piety; Confusion with good Order; and so
resplendent an eminent Greatness, to such inconsiderate, abject, and humble
domestique considerations.

Wherefore this Nation may account it self thrice happy, in enjoying such
sublime rising Powers to govern it, who are able to distinguish between Good
and Evil; and who suffer not themselves to be puffed up so high, as that they
scorn and disdain to look downwards, and so stand not in need (as the waters
poured far from the Ocean) of a borrowed and corrosive salt, to preserve things
from corruption.

Thus as I have already given you rather a Glimpse then a Character of his late
Highness his Person, I shall now render you some other considerable Remarks of
his Affairs.

After the discoveries of an hundred Plots and Designs laid open and
frustrated, the defeating of many jealous parties all of them convinced; and
finally, sundry Foreign Negotiations and Treaties, which has given you
occasion as well to admire his Judgment as his Valor, whence you have found
as bold undertakings to have proceeded from his late Highness, as ever were
commented; and as admirable Conquests on the Continent, as may well answer the
ancient (though long time dormatick) Valor of the English Nation.

To consider how he joined the Piety and good Order of Numa with the Vigor and
Force of Romulus, in those foundations which he laid of this new and Warlike
Empire; which although they scarce budded forth of the earth, are never the
less substantial enough to bear up a solid building; and do sufficiently
discover all the several beautiful Repartitions of the same in a most exquisite
manner, and in a goodly ground plot.

First, his late Highness settled such a Military Discipline, as partaking of
the Virtues of the three first Roman Founders, did strike a terror into the
most ambitious Monarchs of the earth; and does give Instructions, or rather
read Lectures on both the Christian and Moral Virtues unto that Nation which
pretends to be the wisest and most Religious of all the world. See History and
Police reviewed.
I believe that if a Croysade had armed all the Priests and Religious Men,
there would not be so strict an order observed in their Christian Military
Discipline, as that which we now see is established in England, where Sobriety
flourishes amidst abundance, in a Country where formerly Debauchery was
accounted as a Gallantry, and converted into a custom; where Modesty is wedded
to Cruelty, Justice with the extremity of Power, Meekness with the stubborness
of Arms, War with Piety, Valor with Fear and Obedience. And since we speak of
the Piety of this English Pompilius, may we not say that the Goddess Ageria did
nightly in his solitudes appear unto him.

Nor need we to say that he made use of fire and flames by a barbarous and
unchristian-like Zeal to establish the truth of the Gospel. Nor did he send
millions of Pagans to Hell, thereby to be strong enough to force five hundred
against their wills into Heaven: The Piety of this our Common Father was void
of Envy and Cruelty. He has defied the Tyrants over men's Consciences by
Clemency and Charity, and has caused those who profess those two Virtues
before all others (which are more sublime though less profitable to our
neighbors, and consequently of less concernment) to doubt, whether or no the
Quality of the most Christian King is not far better then that of the
Catholic. All which being maturely considered, we may say when a State erreth
both in the Ecclesiastique and Politic Government, he that is invested with
the Sovereign Power, far from being reputed a Tyrant, is accountable before God
if he does refuse the same, and if he lets that Talent remain useless which may
otherwise be advantageous to the whole world.

To say more of his Generosity, this Virtue he highly recommended above all
others unto his Ministers of State, and unto his Ambassadors, and unto his
Children; and whereof that noble Lady Cleypoll, his Daughter of worthy memory,
did give so many evidences during her life, and even at the Article of her
Death, as that she thereby did beget tears in the most obstinate and hardiest
enemies of this State. A worthy Daughter of so famous a Father, whom Heaven too
soon snatched away both from the Virtuous and from the Miserable; and whose
soul did admirably correspond with her Fortune, and the Majesty of her
Comportment. How many of the Royalist prisoners got she not freed? How many did
she not save from Death whom the Laws had condemned? How many persecuted
Christians has she not snatched out of the hands of the tormenters; quite
contrary unto that Herodias who could do any thing with her father. She
employed her Prayers even with Tears to spare such men whose ill fortune had
designed them to suffer: when as this grand Hero being transported as it were,
and even ravished to see his own Image so lively described in those lovely and
charming Features of that winning Sex, could refuse her nothing; insomuch, that
when his Clemency and Justice did balance the pardon of a poor Criminal, this
most charming Advocate knew so skilfully to disarm him, that his Sword falling
out of his hands, his arms only served to lift her up from those knees on
which she had cast her self, to wipe off her tears, and to embrace her. So
likewise it is believed, that this illustrious Princess precipitated death, did
not a little contribute to his late Highnesses sickning; all whose noble parts
were found to be very sound and whole, only his Heart, which sorrow had seized
and dried up. Nor did he long outlive her, since it was impossible he should
survive the love of so generous a dispencer of his Clemency and Generosity.

For brevity, I shall make choice of one of the Ambassadors of this
Commonwealth, to denote the splendour of the glorious Ministers of this generous
Prince; he being in such a place where he has more occasion then any of the
rest, to give far ampler marks of the most Heroical Virtue, which acquires more
glory to the victorious then the victory it self, and which is the most assured
Character of a true Christian, his Excellency the Lord Lockhart, Ambassador in
the Court of France, General of his Highness Forces in Flanders, and Governor
of the Town of Dunkirk, who is espoused to that most renowned Lady one of his
late Highness's Neeces. In both which noble Personages we may behold at once
shining forth those two happy and glorious Talents, which most of all render
persons of their Birth and Quality recommendable and famous. His person seems
only to have been sent into France to charm the whole Nation, and to attract
and accumulate graces; and did he not expose himself to so many dangers and
hazards in the Wars, men might easily believe that after he had long born Arms
in Holland, in France, and ten years space for the late King of England, that
he only ranged himself on the victorious sides to save the Kings Party, and to
reinstate them in their Lands and Goods.

Wherefore the Generosity, Courtesy, and Affability of his late Highness did
so superabound, as that no one person ever departed from his presence
unsatisfied; for he received the Petitions of all men, he heard their
Grievances, and his charitable memory was so retentive, as that he never forgot
their requests, but made it his chief object to bear them in mind, and most
tenderly to provide for them. He esteemed those he had overcome, and took a
delight to pardon them, and to make them sharers of his good Fortune; provided
that they would give over to make themselves unfortunate, by their obstinacy.
He was used to say, that Hearts were as well to be overcome as Fortresses, and
that the one were no more to be demolished then the other, because they had
belonged to other Masters; insomuch, that he esteemed it a great Conquest to
have gained a gallant Man to his party. And as for those who have been put to
death in his time, they may be said to have been their own Judges, and their
own executioners. And however Politicians hold, that in the changing of a
Government, all things ought likewise to be changed if possible, even the very
Religion it self, (were men profane enough to meddle therewith) and that
Cruelty ought wholly to banish Clemency, yet all men know, that as to the point
of Religion, he did leave things as he found them; and that he saved more lives
by thousands, then obstinacy and despair did cause to perish. Nay, he did even
wish when he came to have a more absolute power toward the latter end of his
days, that those which had been put to death were yet alive; protesting
solemnly, that if he could not change their hearts he would have changed their
Dooms, and convert their deaths into a banishment; which is easily to be
believed, by the goodness which he has exercised toward the children of such
as were put to death, even those who were his most implacable enemies; leaving
them in possession both of their Goods and Titles; and whose losses he has
recompensed by such civillities as does evidence, he learned not his Politics
in Machiavils School; See History and Policy reviewed.
who teaches, that the children and all the Generation were to be exterminated
together with their Fathers: so that many men wished that his Highnesses power
had been as absolute ten years since as it was some years before his death.

So likewise those Alliances which he made, and those Wars which he undertook,
had all of them motives of Generosity, and were founded on Equity and Reason;
if so be we consider the very first whereinto he only stepped by the degree of a
Captain, and which may be termed a necessary evil and an inevitable one,
begotten by the remissness of the Political Body, and by the corruption of the
Clergy; I do find that two high injustices were the primitive causes thereof,
the first was the usurpations of the Saxons, Danes, and Normanns; the second
was the peaceful humor and dispositions of King James, and the idleness and
sloathfulness of the Nobility, who constrained their younger brethren to serve
them, or to learn Trades, by taking away from them the means to subsist by the
way of Arms; which is a privilege more then legitimate, due by the elder
brother to the younger, and by Princes to such Martial Spirits as live in their
Dominions; if the Saxons and other Usurpers or Conquerors of England did by
force of Arms become Masters of the Country, and did cast out the right
Possessours thereof, and by success of time falling from a Foreign Injustice
into a Domestic Injustice, they reduced their younger Brothers to Mecannick
professions.

At present they demand that they may be permitted to expose their bloods and
their lives for the preservation of their Brethrens: That the exercise of Arms
may be abolished in so Populous and Warlike a State: that the banished glory
which formerly with so much Pomp reigned in England may be restored again.

And as for the War which his late Highness declared against Spain, that is so
generous, that a man may aver, that glory was the only motive thereof; and
that thereby he espoused the Interest of all the people which were oppressed,
and of all the Princes which the Ambition of Spain had despoyled of their
States and Territories. And the two most unfortunate people of the earth were
the first objects of his Generosity, and those which were the most of all
abandoned, were the first that felt the effects of that Arm which stretched it
self forth to their assistance; Which you may see in two Books, viz. Teats of
the Indies, and the other, America Painted to the life.
To wit, the poor Indians, those wretched slaves, who behold no other faces
save those of their tormentors; and who were made to believe that perishing in
the Mines of Peru, they thereby did raise to themselves Thrones of Glory in
Heaven, since thereby they furnished Spain wherewithal to adorn and enrich
Altars throughout the whole world. In these torrid Climates the gallant English
went to revenge the death of several Merchants, and many brave Seamen of all
Nations, which the Spaniards did surprise in those Seas; and who they did decoy
and attract by specious promises, that they would not mischief them:
Notwithstandstanding the Law of Nations, and the Faith which they had plighted,
they seized their ships; and having tied the men alive to trees, placed this
Superscription on their Breasts, Who sent for you into this Country? And let
them there starve to death, whilst the Birds of the Air did feed upon their
flesh as they were yet alive.

And also Flanders, the Sea whereof like unto a sharp humor, did always
nourish the wounds and incurable evils, she never was in so fair a way to
recover her perfect health by the neighbourly refreshments which England at
present does profer unto her, and the fresh Air which France would also have
her enjoy. Nor was the French letting her blood sufficient to cure her, for she
needed an English Physician who was accustomed to cure and treat incurable
bodies; so that in case this unfortunate fair one will in the least conform her
self to those Remedies which are proffered unto her, and the which will be no
violenter then she her self pleases; she may be rendered plump and well liking,
as the fresh Air and Blossoms of France can make her, and as the Sweets and
Delicacies of England can procure unto her.

In like manner, it was a high point of Generosity in the English, since they
caused France to lose Graveling and Dunkirk, to help France again to re-take
such places in those parts as might repay them with use, and elsewhere also,
such as might stand them in as great stead; as Montmedy, which was the first
considerable reduced place after this happy Alliance, and the which crowned the
same.

And truly here we may consider the Generosity of his late Highness, in its
most perfect dye or luster; for without having regard to those Advantages which
Spain might render him as to the Commerce, the places of Hostage which she
proffered to put into his hands for secure Retreats, as Graveling, Dunkirk, and
others; he was swayed by those Resentments which the English Nation ought to
have harbored for the several and innumerable injuries and wrongs sustained by
that Nation; as the Spanish intended Invasion with their great Fleet in 88.
Their Tyranny in the Indies, and the Cruelties and Barbarismes which they
inflict upon all those who will not acquiess unto, and follow their Maxims and
Opinions. His late Highness therefore preferred the Alliance and League with
France because it was more Christian-like, permitting all men to make use of
that Liberty of Conscience and Freedom, which Jesus Christ has acquired unto
them by his Blood; and gaining them by meekness and courteousness to his Divine
example, and not by Cruelties and Oppressions.

His late Highness sided with France the rather, because she has undertaken
the Defense of all oppressed people, as well Princes as Subjects. And to
allege all in one word, and so to complete the height of Generosity it self;
because France at that time was the weakest, as being abandoned by some of her
ancient Allies, and as it were quite disordered by an intestine War, which had
most violently shaken her bowels; so likewise must France needs confess, that
without the assistance of England, her Navigation was totally ruined; the
Pirates of Dunkirk having blocked up all her Sea Ports, in so much, that
Merchandises were brought in as it were by stealth; and France might have been
forced to have kept but a lean Lent, all their Farms and Farmers being
destroyed; their Butter, Cheese, and all kind of Spices and other Wares of
that nature, being set at such rates as the Common people were not able to pay
for them: So that had not the English scoured their Seas, and driven away and
chased those Pirates which lay lurking in such neighboring Ports, France had
been in a sad condition; whereas now by the means of the English, all Foreign
Nations come freely into the French Ports with their Ships and Goods. And for
to increase the courtesy of the English yet more to France, by saving the
French the labor, charges, and hazzards of going to the Indies, they thence
bring home unto their doors, in Exchange of their Linen and Wines, all the
good things and delicacies, which not only the New World, but the rest of the
World plentifully and abundantly affords.

I shall enlarge my self no further in these Political Reflections, but refer
the Reader to the incomparable Work lately Printed, entitled, History and
Policy reviewed.
