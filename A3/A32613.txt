By the King. A PROCLAMATION Prohibiting the keeping of Bartholomew Fair, and
Sturbridge Fair.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, out of His Princely and Christian care of
His loving Subjects, that no good means of Providence may be neglected to stay
the further spreading of the great Infection of the Plague, does find it
necessary to prevent all occasions of public Concourse of His people for the
present, till it shall please Almighty God of his goodness to cease the
violence of the Contagion, which is very far dispersed into many parts of this
Kingdom already: And therefore remembering that there are at hand Two Fairs of
special note, unto which there is usually extraordinary resort out of all parts
of the Kingdom; the one kept in Smithfield and Saint Bartholomews the Great,
near the City of London, called Bartholomew Fair; and the other near Cambridge,
called Sturbridge Fair; the holding whereof at the usual times, would in all
likelihood be the occasion of further Danger and Infection to other parts of
the Land, which yet, by Gods mercy, stands clear and free; Has, with the
Advice of His Privy Council, thought good by this open Declaration of His
Pleasure and necessary Commandment, not only to admonish and require all His
loving Subjects to forbear to resort for this time to either of the said two
Fairs kept in Smithfield or Saint Bartholomew the Great, and at Sturbridge
aforesaid, or within the Liberties of the University and Town of Cambridge, or
to any other Fairs within Fifty miles of the said City of London; but also to
enjoin the Lords of the said Fairs, and others Interessed in them, or any of
them, That they all forbear to hold the said Fairs, or any thing appertaining
to them at the times accustomed, or at any other time, till by Gods goodness
and mercy the Infection of the Plague shall cease, or be so much diminished,
that His Majesty shall give Order for holding them, upon pain of such
punishment, as for a Contempt so much concerning the universal safety of His
people, they shall be adjudged to deserve; which they must expect to be
inflicted with all severity. And to that purpose does hereby further Charge and
Enjoin under like Penalty, all Citizens and Inhabitants of the said City of
London, that none of them shall repair to any Fairs held within any part of
this Kingdom, until it shall please God to cease the Infection now reigning
amongst them: His Majesty's intention being, and so hereby declaring Himself,
That no Lord of any Fairs, or others Interessed in the Profits thereof, shall
by this necessary and temporary restraint receive any prejudice in the Right of
his or their Fairs, or Liberties thereunto belonging; Any thing before
mentioned notwithstanding.

Given at Our Court at Salisbury the Seventh day of August, 1665. in the
Seventeenth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
