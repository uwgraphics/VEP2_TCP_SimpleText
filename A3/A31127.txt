THE CASE OF THE BOROUGH OF BUCKINGHAM.
HIS Highness the Prince of Orange having sent his Circular Letter to the
Borough of Buckingham to Elect Members to meet in the Convention on the 22th.
of January 1688. By which Letter, notice for the said Election was directed to
be published in the said Borough, by the space of three days before such
Election at the least. Notwithstanding which Order, the present Bailiff without
giving such due notice, or making such publication as was required, did proceed
privately to the Election, and returned Sir Richard Temple and Sir Ralph Verney
Baronets, as chosen by the said Bailiff and Twelve principal Burgesses, which
was done in prejudice to the rest of the Freemen, and Inhabitants of the said
Borough, who claim a Right of Electing their Burgesses to serve in Parliament,
and in wrong to Sir Peter Tyrrill Baronet, and Richard Atkins Esquire who at the
instance and request of diverse of the Freemen of the said Borough, would have
been Candidates in the said Election, if due notice and publication had been
thereof made.
