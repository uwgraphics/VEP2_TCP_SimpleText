Joyful News out of SVRREY.
AFter the Battle of Keynton, Prince Robert with part of His Majesty's Forces,
being the most bloody and mischievous of all his Cavallers, drew toward
Windsor, in his thoughts aspiring to the taking in that Royal Castle, the
ancient Seat of our English Kings, the place where the celebration of the most
Noble Order of the Garter, has been solemnized ever since it is first
institution: so with some six thousand, most horse, passing through the
fruitful County of Buckingham, which he plundered with all hostility and rapine
possible, he passed over the Thames, and came upon the Town, which being
utterly indefensible he was without resistance Master of, and from thence made
his approaches toward the Castle, which commanding the River, he and his
malignants considered as a place of much importance, intending if they could
surprise it, to put into it an able Carrison, and so cut off all traffic out
of the West to London, by stopping their Barges from passing further; but
thinking to find as easy admittance into the Castle as they had into the
Town, they were deceived in their expectation, and saluted with a lusty volley
of Musket Shot from the walls and works, the City of London having sent thither
before to secure the place, a strong Garrison of able soldiers, Prince Robert
galloped with this unexpected resistance, sent one with a Trumpet to treat
with them within for the surrendering the Castle, promising them fair quarter;
but if they resisted, threatening them with all the terrors of death and
destruction: The Commander within answered, That he was to defend that
fortress for the King and Parliament, and so would do against him and all the
world, being neither to be mollified by his fair promises, nor terrified with
his threatenings, that for any other he should expect none, but what came to
him out of the mouth of the Cannon.

Prince Robert and his soldiers much enraged at this stout re^ly, resolved to
beleaguer the Castle; for that cause intrenching themselves as near as they
could possible to the walls, intending to watch all occasions to take it by
assault, disturbing the Garrison as much as was possible with their Musket and
Carabine shot, and continual Alarums, the Garrison in the mean time being not
idle, nor uncarefull of their safeties played upon them with their Ordnance,
cutting them off by scores, their Muskets pouring their dreadful Bullets into
their bosoms, so that the Cavaliers (glad to shelter their Coxecombes) retired
into the Houses, telling Prince Robert they would willingly attend him to fight
against men but not against stone-wals, rocks and inaccessible places, where a
hundred men might keep out ten thousand, all valor being useless; and
therefore desired the Prince that he would rise thence, and depart into other
places where they might do the Cause better service. Prince Robert told them
he would not stir thence to dishonor the glory of his former actions,
without taking that Fort from those Roundheads, and so cheered them on to a
new assault, which was performed very faintly on their side, and answered on
ours with much courage, some of the Garrison soldiers sallying out and beating
those Devils away at handy-blowes, they tumbled some twelve score of them dead
upon the place, which made Prince Robert hearken to the former advice, and so
trusting up his trinkets, and bidding adieu to his Host atthe quarter where he
lodged (very courteously not paying him a penny for his entertainment) with his
company of Rake-shames, he struck up to Stanes ward, killing, destroying all
before him, and so made up as near as he could to Kingston ward upon Thames,
intending if he had possessed himself once of that Town, to have built a Fort
there to impeach all Navigation that way to the City; but being assured, both
the Trained Bands of Barkeshire and Surrey were up, and joined in one Body,
with some of his Exceslencies Forces, sent for the security of those Countries,
he was resolved not to advance too hastily till he had understood the safety of
the passage: Master Carry therefore the Keeper of Mary-bone Park, a strong
malignant, being well acquainted with all the by-ways thereabouts, undertook
to go to Kingston for intelligence, and so in the habit of a Miller disguising
his face to make him further out of knowledge, he trudged on toward Kingston,
and in the way within a mile of the Town some of our Horse met him, and not
suspecting him by his habit, let him pass, till one that came behind knowing
him, made a stop of him; and hallowing in the rest of his fellows, told them
that Miller was Master Carry, and so searching him found good clothes under his
Millers case, and money in his Pockets, which making prize of, they carried him
to Kingston, and there put him in safe custody. Prince Robert in the meanetime
hovering privately about Oatlands, in expectation of Master Cary's return; but
finding his hopes fiustare, he guest at his success, and so with an undaunted
courage he set forward with his Cavaliers. Our forces having notice of the
motions of the Prince, resolved to give him an encounter, being in all, of the
train'd-bands and auxiliary soldiers, some three thousand five hundred, of
which three hundred were horse, who with good courage went on; and about two of
clock in the afternoon on Friday, the eleventh of November, they got a sight
of Prince Robert and his desperate malignants, being most of them horsemen, who
at the view of our forces, came on in the form of a crescent, the two horns
extendent to a great length, leaving a large intervall in the middle, the right
wing, in which Prince Robers was coming on with much fury, the way lying
between two hedges, but at least forty foot broad, being the Scene where this
tragedy was acted; our footmen were amongst our horsemen, and discharged
their Muskets with good aim, but their forces coming on the spur, Prince
Robert with his own troop charged into our body; our horsemen scarce well
able to stand the stroke of those blood thinsty Tigers, when being engaged
among our forces, and encompassed, some ten of good quallity of his Cavaliers
fell, till Sir Lewis Dives his troop seconding the Prince, charged us with much
fury, so that some of the trained soldiers (uninur'd to such deadly salutes)
could have found in their hearts to have been further off; but those that came
thither from his Excellency, being men of resolve, and accustomed to such
greetings, stood their ground firmly, and with their stiff pikes kept back the
fury of the horse, while the Musketeers had leisure to charge and discharge
their pieces; and some Companies being behind of ours, that had never come into
the skirmish, got over unseene by the enemy, those hedges on either side the
broad highway and running nimbly under the covert of the quicksets, they got
clean behind the Princes forces; having also some forty Musketeers on each
side in ambush against the body of his army, who thinking to make dispatch of
the business, crying out courage to his accomplices, in they went pell mell,
into the heart of our soldiers, where at one instant the Musketeers giving
fire in the middle, and the other with cheerful outcryes, charging upon their
rere, it made the Prince turn about to regard the matter, little dreaming to
be incompast by so many enemies; our men that were before almost in rout,
pulling up their hearts, and courageously charging them, who before esteemed
themselves conquerours; so that the Prince and his fo^ces were now faces about
to the rere, where the fight was hottest, the Musketeers from either side the
hedge, playing on the stanks of the enemies troop, and killing them without
mercy; Prince Robert, Sir Lewis Dives, and the rest, rallying together their
distracted troops, resolved to make their way through those who had so
unexpectedly charged them in the backs, deeming them, as indeed they were,
far the lesser number, on the spur therefore they galloped in among them, who
gave them a bloody welcome, but their number being treble to ours, their horse,
and ours foot, at last they got passage, driving our footmen up to the hedge,
whom, when they had past, as fast as ever they could gallop, away they went,
giving them to a thousand devils; leaving behind them on ths ground, at least
three hundred foot, and as many horsemen; few prisoners there were taken, by
reason we were most footmen, and could not pursue them: of our part some
hundred persons of all sorts were lost, so that it was evident, God did fight
for us. Prince Robert, as it is reported, intends to wheel about, and get, if
possibly, into Kent, where he hopes to have a sufficient supply to his so often
beaten Cavaliers, out of those malignants which are there; For our parts, we
are no ways exalted with our victory, but ascribe it to the most High,
resolving with courageous hearts and willing minds to offer our lives and
estates for the defense of the Commonwealth, and that sacred assembly, the
high Court of Parliament, whom God bless with all happiness.

FINIS.
