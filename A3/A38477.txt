The English PRESBYTERIAN AND INDEPENDENT Reconciled.

SETTING FORTH THE Small ground of Difference between them Both.

THE ENGLISH PRESBYTERIAN and INDEPENDENT RECONCILED.
THe great, long, and heavy troubles brought upon the three Kingdoms under the
late King's Dominions complained of in the Discourse and In the Meditation upon
the second Treatise in the (...)
Meditations of the Book called [ The Kings Pourtrayture,] have had other
Causes from whence they originally did spring, and have derived their Being
from a more ancient date of time, than of what the Author of that Book
complains of the King's Compliance, and giving way unto the death of a Lord, a
Favorite of his mentioned in that Book, when as the late Jealousies between the
King and his party on the one side, and the Court of Parliament on the other
grown into Civil broils, and having for many years disturbed the Peace of his
Kingdoms, cannot be ascribed to any other visible Motive, than to a more
general and universal one at first, Injustice and Oppression practiced where
no Power was able to resist, for if as the Proverb.
Wise man observes, Righteousness exalts a Nation, shows also how the King's
Throne may be established; by the rule of contraries, Injustice overthrows a
Nation, and by His listening unto the wicked His Throne is thrown down. The
next motive whereunto the continuation of these troubles mentioned in that
Book may be ascribed, is unto the Violence and Heat in the prosecuting their
several Interests, upon the one Party's mis-apprehending the Subject of the
Quarrel, both Parties pretending to the preservation of the common Peace, and
severally setting forth the justice of their Cause, the reason and equity of
their proceedings, which has produced so much Sedition, Strife, and Faction,
that until in more of all sides a right and perfect understanding be had, the
Commonwealth is likely to remain, as a long time it has, in a languishing and
sad estate: Several discourses have been vented, diverse Books of an opposite
sort each to other published to vindicate and clear the one, to calumniate and
traduce the other Party, when as there is but one Truth and Justice, which both
Parties challenge to be theirs, laying the Iniquity and Wrong-doing to their
Adversaryes charge. A scrutiny made into the falsehood and counterfeit glosses
practiced by the one, an equitable acceptance of the just interest and
pleading of the Other, a serious and true examining the various Writings on
either part, what has passed in the transaction of their Affairs might stint
the Quarrel, the observing how the one Party in their Declarations have
unjustly and deeply charged the other of several Crimes and Misdeamenours,
thereby wronging their own proceedings, in the manner of their dealing, might
convince the Adversary, and consequently put a speedy period to this
contention. When about eleven years since, the King See the (...)
from the urgency of his own affairs (as is given out in his behalf,) from
indeed His contesting with His Subjects of Scotland, about their endeavoring
to defend their ancient Constitutions, summoned this Parliament, and by his
Writ confined it to such a Time and Place, when the matters were debated there,
the Convention being full and free, so by himself acknowledged, that which
seemed displeasing and not consonant to his Will, was attempted to be made
frustrate by his Power; which the Parliament being sensible of, and foreseeing
future and forcible attempts to be made upon their Privileges, sought on the
other side to maintain their Power and Rights, to relieve their fellow subjects
suffering under the late oppressions offered by the Ministers of Justice
against the peoples liberties against the known and fundamental Laws; The
infringing of which added to the late jealousies entertained by our
neighboring Nation the Scottish, and diverse of the English Nation, was in most
men's judgment, the first Ascent to these Divisions. Oppression, Injustice in
the King his party first, then their contending to defend and excuse
themselves, to accuse and retort on the Parliament and their Party the guilt of
their own demeanor, wherein when they could not prevail, their desire and
pursuit of making good their Accusation increased the division to this height;
how and by what degrees it went higher, what projects and practices to get the
upper hand, follows in this Narration; In the resenting which, all men seemed
engaged either in Affections and tacit Wishings, or in Action, some to the
one, others to the other Party, most unto that which they conceived was
ordained, and then convened to preserve Peace and Justice, which by the other
had been not long before disturbed. Not by the way,
that it is thence inferred that the Parliaments Cause was therefore the better
or more just because the most and greatest part of People then sided with them,
or that the King's Parties Cause is so now, in that so many are fallen off from
the Pa^^. and that party, some upon dissenting in Opinion, others grudging at,
without duly weighing the reasons of the Parliaments actings, most indeed
troubled at being subject to their Power and Government, by reason of the
Impositions and Taxes, which. for a time they do lie under and repine to pay not
looking back to the first Occasioners of the war, but fondly conceiving,
because they feel not the fury of a prevalent hostility and war, that therefore
there is no war; but because the People, the wiser sort at least, long since
knew the benefit and use, the dignity and necessity of that Court as the
supreme Judicatory of the Kingdom, therefore the ancient Authority thereof to
be maintained, the Power and Privileges not to be infringed or violated, they

together with the Lords and Commons assembled at Oxford) the Privileges of
Parliament to be so substantial and entire a Right, that the Invasion of the
liberties of either House, as the course of Parliaments was then, and
heretofore held, was an injury to the other, and to the whole Kingdom. In
several his Messages returned unto their Propositions, he repeats and confirms
the same judgment of and concerning their full and ample power, being lawfully
summoned, and by a Law consented unto by himself in full Parliament, Not to be
dissolved unless by their own consent: Notwithstanding which, several attempts
of force and violence were offered, as far as his and his parties power could
extend it self, to the dissolving it, by contending to divide and scatter them,
accusing the remaining part of the Members sitting in the House at Westminster
of being Rebels, so being divided, to account no other of the Parliament at
Westminster, than he did soon after the Pacification made with his Scottish
Subjects, of the Parliament in Scotland, terming them In his Declaration
concerning his proceedings with his Subjects of Scotland, since the
Pacification in the Camp near Berwick, Printed 1640, page 38.
[ The divided Members of that distracted Parliamentary Body remaining at
Edinburgh] So that as to the Parliament of England, it must be confessed, that
he meaned not what he expressed, in allowing to them that lati-tude of Power
and Privileges, or that his Party has since prevailed with him to renounce
that judgment, which he declared to have had of them. That the contentions at
the first sitting of the House were upon the point about matters of fact, what
things were done, what projected to be done, How the King and his Ministers of
Justice had demeaned themselves since the beginning of his Reign, how many
oppressions of several kinds had been offered by them, how they had offended
against the known Laws in an Arbitrary way of Government, which being disputed
by all men as they conversed together, or within themselves, a Division could
not be avoided, but must break out into contrariety of Opinions and Affections,
consequently into Parties and Engagings as their judgments should direct, some
likely to adhere unto the King, contending to make him Absolute, to do
whatsoever he pleased, others contending on the other hand to have him govern
according to the Laws as bound by his Oath, the result from out the
differences betwixt them both, could be no other than for the one Party knowing
what of late had passed, to endeavor a redress, to consult a remedy against
the like Exorbitances, withal that there was no other visible power in being
to emulate and check a King's except a Parliament's, Namely in that Recorded in
the Chronicle of Richard Earl of Warwick his Answer unto King Henry the 6th,
who directing His Privy Seal to discharge him of his Governourship of Callis,
the Earl refused, alleging. That it was granted him by Parliament, Whereunto
if it be answered, That that might be a personal Contumacy in the Earl,
nothing proving the validity of that Court, the reply may be, That the
Authority of Parliament has been of so large an extent, That some Kings of
this Realm have been by Act of Parliament confirmed, as Edw. the 4th, Some with
their Wife and Issue dis-inherited of their Right to the Crown, as Hen. 6. the
lawfulness whereof not at any time questioned, and when the Title to the Crown
has been disputed, it was by Authority of that Court settled, and the Crown

the Power and Privileges of which Court in Rivalship with the Kings have been
many ways manifested in the actings and contestings betwixt their powers.

In the present contention betwixt which, it is not so much what has
accidentally fallen out in the progress of this war, as what has been
actually and intentionally attempted to be done, which foments the quarrel, or
decides the controversy, That this Parliament in contending to maintain their
power, their friends and assistants against their enemies confronting them* was
by an high hand interrupted and opposed; and if we take our Neighbor Nation
the Sea the Scots Remonstrance Printed 1640* cited by Master. Thomas May in his
History of the Parliament of England, written 1647.
Scots their judgment in the stating the occasion of this War, and the
Enemies design, this Parliament was for no other reason called then to give
the King relief and aid against their coming into England; This the occasion
of the League and union betwixt us and them. On these and the like grounds,
they knowing what had been attempted against their National Laws and Rights,
foreseeing what the event was like to be in case they did not bear with
patience, knowing also in what condition the English at or near that time were,
what Declarations the King had published against some, what severe courses he
had taken against other Members of the Parliament of England, which the
Historian notes the dejected People were enforced to endure with patience, and
to allow against their own reason; the Scots considering withal, that if of
themselves they made resistance without the aid of friends they were too weak a
power, that if they delayed their course for remedy too long, their friends and
strength might have been prevented, and knowing before hand that there are but
two remedies applyable to the approach of dangers [ Prevention and Recovery]
the first the right hand rather the heart of Policy, the other the left and
after-game, They begun before any preparations made for or against a War, with
sending to the Parliament of England a Justification of their proceedings,
entreating them to be wary in Vindicating their own Laws and Liberties, to
frustrate the designs of those evil Counselors who had procured this
Parliament for no other end than to arm the King with warlike supplies against
his Scottish Subjects, and by that War to enslave if not to ruin both
Nations; that after many violations and dissolutions of Parliaments in England,
This was not to redress grievances, but to be so overreached, if they were
not careful and courageous, that no possibility should be left for the future
redressing any; That so dangerous practices might be well suspected when at the
same time a Parliament was denied to Scotland (although promised on the word of
a King) granted to England when not expected, and obtruded upon Ireland when
not desired. The rise of all which was from the anger which the Scots knew the
King conceived against them for some particular acts of theirs charged with
Disloyalty, as (without recounting all other differences and jealous^es betwixt
him and them) That they refused and declared against the Messages sent them to
receive the Service Book obtruded on them; for which as for vindicating
themselves from the like charged Disloyalties, they were accused by the King to
have wrote a Cited and complained of by the King in the same D^clararation
against His Scottish Subjects, for inviting foreign forces into this Kingdom,
page 55, 56. See the Letter it self in the same Declaration, signed by seven of
the principal of the Nobility of Scotland.

Peer of theirs was imprisoned and condemned to dye. That the Pacification had
and made to take away all differences past, and which might ensue betwixt the
King, the English and the Scots, by the prudent and joint advice of a select
Committee of English and Scottish Lords, as to remove all jealousies betwixt
both Nations, was, soon after it was made, sco^ned and slighted, the Scots
then complaining in their informations made unto the English, their Friends and
Brethren, of many injuries they had received since the Pacification made, and
contrary to that Agreement. This was the condition of the Scots, these the very
words of their Remonstrance, That the Union and Brotherly League, entered into
by both Nations, was no otherwise construed than an Invitation in the one, and
invasion of See in the Kings name, the Authors account of them, how in the
(...) he keeps in memory, That the Scots we^e the first that began the Kings
troubles, in the Treatise of his leaving Oxford, and going to the Scots, and
elsewhere in several places of that Book. Also in the Declaration printed on
the Kings behalf at Oxford, 1643. page 23. suggesting an intent in them to
confound the Government, and alter the Laws of England. The Marquess of
Montrosse declares how they began His Troubles, (viz.) by dispersing their
Apologeticall Pamphlets (as he terms them) through Great Britain before the
Troubles began, and before their coming with an Army into England: See a Book
entitled, The History of His Majesty's affairs under the Conduct of the
Marquess, in the years 1644, 1645, 1646. page 3.
Forreiners in the other Nation, and howsoever the Charge in the 7. Articles,
exhibited against the 5 Members of the House of Commons, and one Lord of the
House of Peers was laid to those few only, yet probably it had reached many
other of the English Nation, had not the first assault of violence in the Kings
party miscarried as it did; But wherefore were those Articles exhibited against
those Members, and the King attempt in an hostile array to seize their Persons
in the House of Commons which when he could not effect he was blamed by some of
his nearest friends for not seizing some others in their stead as has been
credibly given out, so that nothing was properly to be laid to the charge of
those six, when as the same crimes were to be fitted to any other in the House;
the Articles charged on them are elsewhere mentioned by a Gentleman who has
written the History of the Parliament of England, and those six Gentlemen
charged to be Ringleaders in the committing several Treasons but how justly?
in every design and purpose there is some more activity in one, two, three, or
more than in the rest, and every conpleated Act is first the conception and
motion of some few individual persons, than the consent of the rest, if the
first motioners of such a design shall for their forwardness without any
advantage to themselves, be therefore accused of Treason, and in a violent way
pursued, and when their persons could not be met with others of their fellow
Members were to be seized in their room, it could not but strike at the root of
the Subjects liberty the power and privileges of Parliament: So many sad and
direful notes could not but portend a War against one or both Nations, as time
and opportunity should best serve to manage the design in hand, or else the
Parliament, knowing themselves to be a free and full Convention, in all parts a
Parliament, both in the Substance and Form, summoned by the Kings Writ to meet,
etc. as in the circumstance of Time and Place, must submit to the will and
pleasure of an Amongst other Motives to his a^g^r about the Earl of Strafford's
death, which whether he would have avenged on the Party who condemned him, may
be guessed at, in that an unknown Author in his name, several times repents
the injustice of that Act, to which he was forced to yield compliance, for
which sin, as the Author mentions it, the King and his Kingdoms have felt
long, great, and heavy Troubles. See the (...) in the Treatise concerning the
Earl of Strafford, and the Marquess of Mo^trosse his Declaration set forth
1649 aggravating the same to incense the King and his party against the Scots,
expressing in it their disloyal Practices, Breach of Duty, Covenants, calling
them Traitors, etc.
incensed King, so to be dissolved, or awed at pleasure, or to have Boundaries
put upon their Acts and Counsels, by such as they knew to be corrupt, and would
have removed from the King, to the end his Throne might be established; which
desire of theirs was on the other side counterpoised by a factiously framed and
superstitious Maxim amongst his Favorites, That if a King will suffer men to
be torn from him, he shall never have any good service done him: So that in
this Doubt and Perplexity, whether the Parliament should Submit, Desist, or Act
according to their Trust, they thought it nearly and necessarily concerned them
to provide for their own and the Kingdoms safety, for the public welfare, some
of their Members being impeached and charged, two Kingdoms provoked and
m^na^ed, the Sea the Kings grateful acknowledgement of the Affection and
Loyalty of his Irish Subjects in offering to supply him with Preparations, etc.
together with their Persons and Estates, even to the uttermost of their
ability, to reduce his disaffected Subjects of Scotland to their obedience,
desiring withal it may be Recorded as an Ordinance of Parliament, and to be
Printed as a Testimony of their Loyalty to all the world, and succeeding Ages,
In his Declaration since the Pacification, page 63. Which could not but stir up
the Scots to seek protection and assistance from their fellow subjects and
friends wheresoever, whom the King calls his disaffected subjects, and how he
does secern them from the rest is hard to judge, when as the whole and most
considerable part of that Kingdom did by their Pacts and Counsels at their
Assemblies h^ld, withstand and resolve to withstand diverse of his Messages
obtruding on them such matters as made against the Peace of their Church and
Kingdom.
Third also likely to bear a part in the broils of the other Two, the King
himself jealous and displeased to see the Parliament (then at distance with
him in transaction of matters concerning the three Kingdoms) Petitioned and
Appealed unto, termed in an envious and scornful way by some of his Party
Omnipotent, others murmuringly upbraiding that it was Idolized, himself as it
were neglected and left out, none or seldom Addresses made to him, which by
the Author of the In the third Treatise.
(...) is with much indignation urged, that some few of the Members of the
House were more looked on as greater Protectors of the Laws and Liberties than
the King, and so worthier of public protection. Hence it was that the
Parliament had a narrow path to tread between their hopes to regain the Kings
lost favor after many evidences of his anger poured forth, and their hazarding
the ruin of those principles, whereon they did first engage, that they thus
Acting knew well that their Cause was just, their War defensive, as was at the
beginning of these Troubles by a Mr. D^nz. Hollis his speech, June 1642.
Gentleman of good abilities, in an excellent Speech of his, delivered to that
purpose, setting forth the Enemies series and succession of designs to
interrupt the Parliament, as first by awing and taking away the freedom of it
by an Army, then actually assaulting it, and with the sword to cut asunder the
only Nerves which strengthens and knits together the King and People, the
People amongst themselves, and the whole frame of Government in one firm and
indissoluble knot of Peace and Unity; That the Parliaments taking up Arms was
to defend only, to repel the force, and violence practiced by a few of the
King's side at first, afterward to provide against the mischief which his
Party heightened through rage against the Parliament, pretense of Loyalty
toward the King, might several ways intend; That their resisting his and his
Parties practices was then judged and discoursed to be for no other end then to
maintain their own just Privileges in order to the maintenance of the Laws and
Liberties of their Fellow Subjects; that for these familiar Reasons here
ensuing no man would imagine that they d^^ intend an Offensive War, to engage
the Subjects one against the other, or the King against themselves; An instance
thereof may be fully seen in these particulars following.

I. First, for that they could not but foresee that the consequences of a War,
falling ou^ betwixt a People oppress^d, a Court of Parliament provoked, and a
King displeased, See the Message s^nt from both Houses of Parliament to the
King, and his parties receiving it, mentioned in this Book.
(Counsel and Duty on the one being recompensed with Indignation and Reproach
on the other side) would prove calamitous and sad, but on which side the
calamity would fall with greatest force and fury very uncertain, when as
besides the two Parties immediately engaged one against the other, a middle and
Neutrall part worse a^ well in the Sea the Declaration of the Lords and Comm^ns
assembled at Oxford, printed there 1643.
Kings Parties account as in the Sea the Remonst^ance sent out of Scotland,
1639.
Parliaments, would fall in as opportunity should serve.

II. That it being presumed the aim and Counsels of the Parliament, and all
men else ^^ing for Peace and Justice, a War once waged would hinder and destroy
their aims, and produce more overtures for discord more fresh supplies for
quarrelling, in the prosecuting which, many unexpected chances would fall out
to increase the discord, as in the controversies between man and man, he who
has not been so forward and visibly active for them unto whom he did adhere,
as in every particular opinion of theirs concurrent with them, shall be
traduced and accused by them also for a Neutrall or an Enemy, when as m^n not
at all assisting have therefore been by the one Party convicted Neutralls and
thereupon pronounced See the same Declaration ibid.
Forsworn.

III. That amidst their hopes of conquering, there would not be wanting
discontented and seditious humors even out of their own first Party to traduce
and vilify their proceedings, if not consonant to their particular humors and
fantasies, that those humors would be fed and animated by the first and common
Enemy on purpose to divide and weaken the prevailing Power.

IV. That diverse other consequences likely to result from War would prove harsh
and irksom to a people born free and governed under Laws and Peace, as that the
Soldiery and prevailing Power knowing their own opportunity and strength, would
be apt to intermeddle with private Interests, or at least the People would be
jealous of it, to the perver^ing Justice and trampling down the Laws, which in
a time of Peace distristributes to every man his just Right, so that the people
would not only want the blessing of Peace, but grow subject to the oppression,
charges, and injuries incident to a War.

V. The Parliament could not but foresee that in case a War were to be waged,
their own Contrymen both Officers and private Soldiers must fight it out,
Soldiers of Fortune when they have gained, will sometimes desist their
undertakings and leave off the service.

VI. That the English were unaccustomed to War, and by reason of their easy
and soft way of breeding not fitted to the discipline and managing thereof,
neither able to endure the hardship and duties of a War, howbeit experience
has otherwise proved it.

VII. That the English gallantry and their courage unacquainted with the
conditions of a warfare, and the temper requisite to a Soldier, might make
them upon every discontent as apt to Mutiny and Resist as fight.

VIII. The Parliament could not but be sensible withal of their fellow
subjects, that the apprehension of Engaging would carry with it a sad aspect,
all men unwilling to and wary how they did Engage, that if they did Engage the
Engaging parties on either side when they see the face of a War inevitably
approaching, would and must for their better strength and union betake
themselves to what Policy, Pacts and Leagues they could, Defensive and
Offensive, as to bind themselves and friends by Vow and Covenant, which being
to consist of several Heads and Parts to be without much study or delay
framed, for fear of their Enemies gaining time on them could not be so exactly
and entirely devised, but might admit of a doubtful sense, how to be
understood, in part or in the whole, so consequently divide the Covenanters
within themselves.

IX. That when they should have gained a power, they must to maintain the same,
Engage and Enforce all men to acknowledge and conform unto their Power, thence
hazarding the repute and censure of becoming Usurpers over their
fellow subjects, of exercising an Arbitrary and Tyrannical power over the
Peoples estates and consciences.

X. They could not but withal know that which side soever should prevail both
sides would be losers, the King and Kingdom vast sufferers in the loss, as
they in an humble and dutiful See it cited in the Declaration Printed at
Oxford 1643. page 13.
Message, although contrariwise interpreted, did in the sadness of their
hearts foretell the King.

XI. That in this War the prevailing Power would be to seek (to carry an even
and well tempered hand) how to deal with the vanquished their own Countrymen,
and mistaken fellow subjects, for 'twas a Misunderstanding which first made the
rent between them, scorn to acknowledge and retract their Error widened and
continued it; amongst which doubtings if they did inflict too heavy a
punishment, either pecuniary by Mulct, or corporal by Imprisonment, 'twould
seem unjust and harsh from the Conqueror, being of their own Nation, and keep
off the hopes of reconcilement and reunion; if too gentle and remiss, 'twould
leave and allow the Conquered a power and means of recovering their power again.

XII. That if the Parliament should in any degree prevail, there would want no
Policy or Stratagems to disturb and interrupt their further prevailing, all
Falsehoods, Impostures, Counterseitings, Semblances of friendship, of business
and Commerce to be practiced against them and their success, as by Foreign
Tenders from abroad, Private Addresses here at home, all from the same
disaffected and troubled Fountain, moved and stirred by the Enemy on purpose
to divert their thoughts and counsels, to retard and hinder their progress and
success.

XIII. That above all in the doubtful events of War as it was likely to fall
out betwixt Persons offending on the part hating to be reformed, and a Court of
Parliament on the other, chosen and set apart to redress Grievances in a
Commonwealth, Offenders would apply themselves for refuge to the King a supreme
Power, whom if he did protect, Mr. John Heywood on the life of Hen the 4th.
(making thereby the Offenders faults his own) would without dispute revert to
his dishonor, and consequently beg^t a Jealousy and Difference betwixt him and
his People; and if the Parliment should take ill his protecting them, there
would issue a Contest kindling and preparatory to a War, thence if the King
engaged, and the Parliament resisted or fought, they could not hope if they
were subdued to avoid the Charge of High Treason, nor think it an easy thing
in the first beginning of their strength to prove Conquerours over a King
seated a long time in an ancient Monarchy, invested with many advantages of
power, and guarded with Courtiers, Friends of all sorts, Servants, and
Favorites, all of which had their retinue also and train of Friends to assist
in case of needing such: Besides, the King if resisted and opposed, and thence
a War fall out betwixt him and his subjects, They could not hope soon, or
suddenly to overcome him, but the War must be of some continuance, the seat
thereof in the bowels and best parts of the Kingdom, nor to be only an
intestine War at home, but foreign Forces to be expected from abroad, for that
the King to maintain his cause would endeavor to engage other Kings in his
Quarrel to take part with him upon this suggestion, That their Subjects by the
example of his may do the like, how treasonable and dangerous a President it
is for Subjects to rise in Arms against their King: when as unto them who have
known the state and government of other Kingdoms, the case between other Kings
and their Subjects is far different from This both in the manner and frequency
of his Offendings (as the Charges and Remonstrances of both Houses of
Parliament published to the world have declared) touching his actions and
demeanor during or near the time of his whole reign as also, in the condition
and quality of the Government of this Kingdom different by many Notes of
distinction limited from all other throughout EUROPE; all States and Kingdoms
having their peculiar Laws, Constitutions, Forms of Government, Degrees of
Subjection in the Governed: This having been no absolute but a limited and mixed
Monarchy, where the King was (as a great Bracton lib. 4.
Lawyer takes his Dimension) Singulis mayor, universis minor, etc.

Wherefore if amongst other Nations, our neighboring France.
Kingdom by reason of the Commotions and Civil broyls in it shall as some of
them do object, That the Subjects of this having taken up Arms against the
Kings Parties attempts and force, have infected the Subjects of that Kingdom
with the like disposition and design of disobedience and rebellion; It Is
answered, the Government of That differs in their Laws, Manners, Constitutions,
and Policies, as much from This as two Christian Kingdoms may in theirs; and as
to the matter of Freedom the old received saying mentions the different ways
of Government betwixt Us and Them, betwixt the King of that Realm commanding on
his part whatsoever he pleases, and the Subjects obeying on theirs, in that it
is commonly said, howbeit with too acute and bold a censure, that their King is
Asinorum Rex, the King of England Hominum; for no other reason than that the
People of the one are subject and obedient to the Will and Arbitrary Government
of theirs, the People of England pay a known and limited obedience by the
Laws, which the King is alike sworn to keep by his practice in his own Person,
and by his power to maintain it toward others, as the People to obey. The
Laws, Customs, and Constitutions of England as a See the Duke of Rohan in his
Treatise of the Interests of the Princes and States of Christendom, calling
England a little world set apart as having nothing to do with other Princes,
etc.
Noble Prince and Peer of France observes, are of another Form of Government
differing from all other Nations, some being Free-States, others simply and
absolutely Monarchies, having Power, and as they think also Right to enforce
and conform all under them to slavery and vassallage.

XIIII. That if the Parliament notwithstanding these attempts and practices
against Their Power should prevail, They would and must to keep up Their Power,
lay Taxes and Payments on the People, who when the War did seem or was near an
end, their complaint would be, and that with repining and murmuring [ The War
is ended, the Taxes and Payments yet continued] not considering that it is of
as great concernment to keep as to gain a Victory, nor sensible of the quiet
and safety which through the counsel and vigilance of the higher Powers they
do enjoy, and other Countries infested with the like Civil Wars do want, when
as the Parliament in case of Their prevailing were to weigh withal the doubts
and dangers attending Them, the care, jealousy and fears which no men but
would avoid the troubles of, and such as They must be subject to until the
Conquest be fully made, the cares against the surprizall of their Enemy, the
Jealousy of friends proving false, or falling off, the fears of losing what
They should gain; all these being passive more serious and anxious than the
hopes of the adverse part, Fears more deeply seizing and disquieting the
Conquerours spirits especially whilst their Victory is accompanied with study
and thoughts of mercy toward the Conquered, hopes in the vanquished being more
bold and active, raising thoughts working still how to recover what they have
lost.

XV. Again, They could not but consider that in a War with Them, the King Their
Enemy would have some of his Party fit and able to inveigh and declaim against
Them as being Rebels for contending with him, wherefore in case of the
Parliaments prevailing until a full Conquest made, They being subject to the
charge of Rebellion, Treason, and accused thereof, as by several Edicts and
Declarations published it has fallen out; and that the King with the help of
his Mercurius Aulicus.
Chronicler has in a continued tone named Them the Rebels at Westminster,
Perjured, and nothing since of pardon to assoil them from such guilt to repeal
such censure, could not but expect to be dealt with by their Enemies thirsting
after Revenge and Conquest with Vices of as sharp an edge to revenge and wound
as with Dissembling, Treachery, Falsehood, Perjury, whilst the Parliament and
their friends are in the state of Traitors, as the Kings party counts Them,
and nothing done by him to clear Them from such guilt, it is held but just to
recompense Treason with Treachery, Forswearing with Forswearing, and all held
honest means in order to the chastising Rebels, and good enough to be
practiced against the Power of Traitors, casting and scattering the seeds of
those Vices even amongst the Parliaments own Friends, to divide Them within
Themselves, to cut asunder the Ties and Ligaments which should strengthen their
Accord, that being weakened they may be overcome at last; So the Dissembling,
Fraud and Art which the Loser practices as his means of recovering his loss,
may teach the Winner as his means to keep what he has got,

XVI. That all disasters and evils, whether Sickness, Dearth, or what
Calamities soever happening through and by reason of such numerous bodies as an
Army consists of, what Enormities and Errors committed or suffered either in
Church or State, an Army can by their strength defend, and justify, none
daring to question them, so all the evils and injuries done to be laid to the
charge of the present power, which Governs and Rules no better in the peoples
account, thence reckoning all the disasters of the war to flow, not looking on
the first occasion and Authors of the war.

Neither does the peoples Regreet and Jealousy cease in this surmise, for that
moreover there are to be Agents and Officers belonging to, and providing for an
Army (Receivers, Expenditors, Treasurers) others, too many to be here recited,
who in troubled waters will bring in to their private bank what is to be
raised for the public use, and that the War and Calamities thereof are
protracted through their corruption and privy gainings.

XVII. That in a Battle fought which side soever should prevail, there would
fall ou^ enough to disturb and divide the thoughts of either side (the
Conquered and Conqueror) fears and doubtings in the Conquered, whether they
should wholly yield unto the Conqueror, or entertain hopes of recovering
their loss again, Pride and Insolence in the Conquerours dividing them
likewise into variety of opinions what course were fittest to be taken for
their next achievement, the distractions thereof have sometimes overthrown an
Army, the Commander in chief being not at al times present nor his judgment at
any time infallibly certain to direct, and when a Victoria natura insolens and
superba est Cicero.
victory shall be gained, which naturally is proud, and by Pride comes
contentions, emulations, and variances in actions as well as in opinions, the
Conquerors strength would be thereby weakened, and thence in danger to be lost.

XVIII. That until a complete and full conquest made, which could not be
without much pressure, and heavy sufferings on the vanquished, without charge
and payments laid on all, Enemies, Friends (Enemies in being fined for their
Delinquency, Friends burdened by reason of their expense and charge in the
public service, of providing for the common peace, for the maintenance of the
Soldiery and the like) an Army was to be continued and maintained to prevent
Insurrections here at home, inroads and invasions from abroad, that the Army
was to consist of multitudes of Soldiers, those multitudes would have their
several humors and opinions tending to divisions, consequently to the
destruction and ruin of the whole, that without an extraordinary care to
please and satisfy them in their demands, there would be mutinying, revolting,
and inconstancy in the private Soldiery for want of judgment to discern for
what they fought.

XIX. That if the Conquerours power should at any time abate, before a full and
total conquest made, he would be put to it what course to take to increase it
again, Forcing and Impressing men to fight in a cause so intricate, as unto
some it seemed then, and for a long time controverted as this has been would
prove harsh and irksom and would meet with resistance in a people made and born
free, unless their pay and reward be answerable to, yea beyond their meritings.

XX. That in the confusion of a civil War, many dissentions and emulations
upon true or misapprehended grounds, would fall out amongst the orders and
ranks of men, to disturb and overthrow the degrees and dependencies each on
other, according to their several and respective Qualities, all begetting and
Fomenting an universal distraction throughout the Kingdom, not easily to be
allayed in the heat and preparations to a War, until a deliberate and true
examining the misunderstandings which the fury of a War begun would scarce
endure, should set it aright.

XXI that if new and sub-divisions should fall out amongst themselves in
matters of judgment or opinion, and thence contentions grow, the prevailing
party would be to seek how to deal with those who formerly had been their
friends, and heretofore assisted them in their greatest wants, but since by
reason of new dissentions have discontinued their affections acting and
laboring against their proceedings, whether in point of Gratitude they should
forbear to punish them as their adversaries, or in point of Safe^y take such a
course as may best defend and secure them, and themselves also, from the common
enemy.

XXII. That a War, the longer it continues, the more cruel and desperate it
would grow; for that, when as one party has prevailed, and afterward the
victory comes again to be disputed, the success grow doubtful, the
prevailing power must, and with good reason would, punish their adversaries
with a severer hand, the adversaries out of foresight thereof would be the more
sedulous to prevent, the more active to provide against such severity, so the
contention between them would become the more extreme.

XXIII. That, in the sum of all, a War although of a short continuance
would produce more mischiefs, more Sects and Schisms, more disorder and
disturbances in a commonwealth, than a Peace restored again, although of many
years growth would recover to its former temper.

So many anxieties, so much evil incident to a civil war, could not but keep
wise men from harboring the least thoughts of Leavying one, yea to say more on
the Parliaments behalf, and Their desires of peace, after the war was waged,
and to prevent the effusion of more blood, Their offering and accepting
Treaties, have manifested the same; that when in Their Battails fought, They
were at the highest Tide of success, They did not refuse to Treat, nor when at
the lowest Ebb forbear to Fight.

These prudentiall Reasons incident to, and consequent on a War, and to wise
men obvious to have been foreseen could not but induce Them to decline a War,
yea deter Them from levying one, These might withal together with many more
which might be added hereunto, and put into the Balance with the Objections
offered by the Kings Party [ to prove the Parliaments design of overthrowing
Monarchy, which they could not do but by a War,] will outweigh the
objections, and imprint in all men who shall impartially look into the
beginnings and progress of this War an undoubted knowledge of the Parliaments
just actings, and these Reasons of foresight together with what has past,
might satisfy all knowing and discerning men that if the Parliament did intend
to levy a War against the Kings evil Councillors, the Kingdoms King James
his Speech in Parliament, 1609
Pests and Vipers, rather then They should be borne down in Their just defense,
They did not intend to levy one against the King who had as many friends to
adhere unto as the Parliament had enemies of many sorts Offenders Interested
and Obnoxious Persons to confront and oppose Them in their proceedings.

The Reasons being now set forth which might give assured satisfaction to the
Reader of the Parliaments averseness from a War, of their desires for Peace,
it is to be equally considered what may be brought in by way of opposition
against the applying them rather to the Parliaments Interest than to the Kings.
If it be retorted as an Objection against the Parliament and Their Friends,
that the Kings Party being discerning and prudent men, might have made use of
the self same Reasons for their declining a War also being of the like
prudence and foresight: It Is answered, they being invested with a full and ample
power of the King and his adherents it might breed in them a greater confidence
of prevailing, and so were not to be conceived to apprehend so many doubts and
fears in their undertaking a War as the Court of Parliament did.

The chief matter of Objection which their enemies give out whether published
in Print or discoursed only is that three or four Gentlemen of quality of
popular note as they render them before the beginning of this War, chosen
Members of the House of Commons together with a Baron of the Realm, a Peer of
the House of Lords, dwelling in neighboring Counties each to other, and
sojourning before the beginning of these troubles with a In Norththamptonshire.
Gentleman a Neighbor and Friend of theirs did there conspire or contrive the
overthrow of Monarchy, to alter the frame of Government with intent to act
against the Power and Person of the King: If neither of these contrivances or
intents appeared by any Discourse, Letters or other Acts of theirs, the
Objectors show more spleen against those Gentlemen then reason in drawing a
prejudicial conclusion against the Parliament from their own feigned or
mis-conceived premises.

Many the like objection may be devised and whispered on purpose to traduce the
Cause and Persons now opposed, but unless the Truth were proved, and the
Inference better framed, the Objections are of little use.

Did not the Parliament suffer more through Divisions within Themselves, then
by such Arguments and Inferences used by Their adversaries, such like Calumnies
could not hurt Them; for that They have now got the upper hand They seem
notwithstanding to divide anew, with appearance and approach of danger to both
the divided Parties, the one leaning on a Covenant which party supposes it to
enjoin and hold a Presbyterian Form of Government, the other contending for a
kind of Independency, as it is called, yet it is to be presumed that neither
the Independent which seems a privative, nor the Presbyterian a positive Form,
can as yet during these Distractions be firmly and thoroughly established, such
Contentions may unhappily beget a Quarrel to the overthrow of both upon their
Conquering, which will be held rather an event of the Conquerours good success
than from any self-wilfull humor, many on either side being sober and
discerning Gentlemen, which division if it should continue, what may be guessed
to be the event thereof, that for the sake of a few dissenting in opinion we
should fall out within our selves, or that a Neighboring Nation of late our
friends and fellow sufferers Sir Francis Bacon on the life of Hen. the 7th.
whose aid and union might have been of mutual security and use to Us both
should fall out with Us or We with Them, and so imbroil two Kingdoms at the
least in an irreconcilable War about differences in opinion, about terms
merely notionall, about opinions strange and unknown to them (In the first War
they knew for what they fought) about a form of Government, which has not nor
can take root until the War which confounds and overthrows all Government be
ended; The direct and certain issue in the trial of the first Contention
betwixt the King and Parliament was Whether the King having by his Creatures
actually invaded the Subjects Liberties (the other differences in Church and
State are collateral accidentally emergent out of the grand Difference about
the first and more principal ( viz.) the Subjects Liberty) The Court of
Parliament should sit as Scepticks to look on only without purposing or
endeavoring to redress the same, or to be so confined in Their Consultations
and Resolutions, as their Enemies should prescribe, or the extremest of all,
be so driven to new Councels, to extraordinary high and severe proceedings, to
courses seldom practiced, (the passages and quality of the persons with with
whom they had to deal being weighed withal) as where the disease is imminently
dangerous the mischief desperate, the Cure must be answerable, or the whole
Body perish for want of a timely and prudent remedy to be applied: The
Parliaments actions if therefore rigid and severe as to their Enemies, if
variable and uncertain as to their selves may in these streights and
exigencies whereunto they are driven and forced for safety be dispensed with:
It seems to fare with them as with Seafaring men in a boisterous Storm who are
fain to steer their vessel, which way they may best secure their Fraught and
Charge, sometimes Northerly sometimes plain North, sometimes Northwest,
sometimes Northeast, sometimes plain South, sometimes North again, so from one
cross point unto another having still the Harbor and End of their Voyage in
their eye, so with Them encountering with such uncertainty and variety of
oppositions from their Enemies, (yet all meeting in one Center to the
subversion of their power and strength) such Nonconformity and dissension even
amongst themselves and friends that They cannot yet Act within a direct,
certain, and constant compass, to please all lookers on, Their aim and end
notwithstanding may be one and the same [ the defense of the Laws, the peoples
liberties, and the maintenance of the supremest Law the Peoples safety] yea
Their Edicts, Orders, and Ordinances devised and made in jealous* and troubled
times cannot well be free from all exception, Many of their adversaries being
knowing and prudent men if their animosity and height of Spirit would give way
to the exercise of their knowledge upon their consulting and conferring their
observations to what they have known and read can no doubt frame exceptions
against the Parliaments proceedings, as the acute and more witty sort can
deride and make sport at Them in their looser jests and Poems: Neither will any
man imagine that in the fiercenes and heat of preparations for a War, when their
chief thoughts of providing to assail and to defend were most attentive and
wholly taken up, that then They could devise so punctually exact and perfe^t
Laws and Ordinances as perpetually to bind, or such as no specious Objections
might be urged against the consonancy of some of Their late Ordinances to
former and wholesome Laws; yet whilst their endeavors are to maintain and
defend the main Principles ( viz.) God's Honor, the Subjects liberty (the one
in danger to be born down, the other by several arbitrary act^ of power
invaded) and the Laws and Ordinances for maintenance of both by the same power
made in-effectuall and neglected: when the Parliament in defense thereof saw
how They were interrupted in Their proceedings how compassed about with a
potent Enemy surrounded with many advantages of power and policy to bend his
forces against Them under the calumny of being Rebellious Subjects They were to
provide alike how to preserve and secure by all possible means what he did
attempt to overthrow; wherein they could not tread so even and precise a way in
making all their Acts and Ordinances as to be free from being quarrelled, with,
that no Reasons might be framed and arguments raised by such as were likely to
prove their adversaries against some of such Their Ordinances yet the intent
and ultimate end of Their undertaking may be one and the same [the preservation
of the Laws, the maintenance of the chief and supremest Law the Peoples Nulla
tam sancta Lex est quam non oppo^ceat, si salus populi post^let, urgeatque
necessit^s, mu^are. Bodin lib. 4. de Repub.
safety,] wherein if They shall fail or not be able to make it good, we know
by some late years since experience how barbarously and cruelly their enemy's
malice did show it self against Them as being reputed Rebels, in case he shall
recover his power again, how a desperate Revenge added to will second his
first and furious cruelty, and to Crown his glory, as for the better exalting
his pretense he shall impute it unto Gods justice saying [ It is the Lord's
doing (it may be his suffering it through their divisions) and it is marvelous
in our eyes that he has wrested the Sword out of our enemies hands and put it
into ours, for no man he will say can think that Rebellion as he takes it shall
for ever pass unpunished] th^n when he has regained his Power, he will not
want Arguments from his own, nor from a neutrall party siding with him upon his

Rebellion to make the Parliament men's Persons and Acts his See the Parliaments
Remonstrance 1647.
sport and scorn, those Proclamations of his lately accusing and proscribing
many of both Houses of Parliament as guilty of High Treason, with other Edicts
of his to be revived, those sentences and judgments seriously denounced against
Them and Their proceedings, the scoffs and flouts jestingly passed on the
Parliament and Their friends and by the wi^ and power of Their adversaries made
good against Them whey They have lost Their Power; which Power is visible yet,
Their strength not shortened, the great difficulties the fierce conflicts which
They have wrestled with, the Revolting of Their Friends, the multiformity of
Opinions amongst Themselves might have have abated Their success and weakened
Their strength, had not an Almighty hand supported Them amongst those
difficulties, never so many stratagems policies and falsehoods practiced by an
Enemy to impair the Parliaments strength to advance his own, but that the God
of Truth has discomfited and dispelled them all, in which whither ^he has
done it in favor to the justice of Their Cause, or in his foreknowledge of
Their Enemy's malice to be avenged if he could have got the upper hand, I leave
to the judgment of the cried up In the (...) Treatise 28. upon the Vote of
Non-Addresses.
Author who has more fitly observed That Gods wise providence often permits
what his revealed Word approves not, then he has suited his resembling of the
Parliaments successes to prosperous winds filling the Sails of Pirates to
justify their Pyracy, when as the giving or denying victory and courage in the
day of Battle is a more immediate and effectual work of God's Almighty Power
acting and taking an especial care in the affairs of War.

The Reasons In the Book styled the present judgment of the Convocation held at
Oxford.
offered against the Covenant Directory and Negative Oath are learnedly penned
if as appositely applied: To the two first, let the Scots maintain what they
were the first contrivers of themselves, yet thus much may be said on their and
our part jointly that the signification of the terms [ Tyrant and King] being
opposite (although in Cal^ing J^piter (amongst the rest of the heathen Gods)
(...).
Homers time the word Tyrant was taken in the better part) the one the
desolation, the other the (...) quasi (...).
foundation of a people, both Nations declaring and accusing the King of
Tyranny neither of them could think that the frequent Petitions in the Common
Prayer book for and in the King's behalf were to be used by his people,
himself being in open arms against them: The Common Prayer book was confirmed
by a Statute Law in a Princes time who at the beginning of her Reign having
redeemed the protestant Religion out of the bondage of Popery and superstition
did by her piety and prowess keep her people in peace and plenty, and
therefore might deserve their prayers when and as often as the Liturgy
prescribes. The Ordinance for laying aside the Service book for enjoying the
Directory is an act of their present Judgment who have done it, as the arguing
against the Directory from Oxford is an act of theirs which they so represent
as if their after-Iudgement and second thoughts might admit what for the
present they have reasoned against, who with a cautious modesty have argued and
styled it their present Judgment: If positive Laws be subject to alteration
and repeal, Ordinances which bind only for the present may likewise be, so
then a set form of prayer may be resumed and used according to the Orthodox and
true Church discipline admitting also the most principal and necessary parts
of divine service prescribed in the Liturgy.

So the Negative Oath, That none shall assist the King against the Parliament
and his People, etc. where a thing is commanded or forbidden by any Powers, the
withstanding and doing contrary to the command of such Powers is a
transgression punishable at their pleasure and discretion, whether it be by
Fining, Imprisoning, according to the degree of the offense, wherefore the
urging Cap. 11. Hen. 7. seems not applyable to the condition of this present
Quarrel; for admit that neither of the three ( viz. The Covenant, the
Directory, the Negative Oath) be in the judgment of the Convocation at Oxford,
and of many others free from being excepted against; as that neither the
Covenant nor Negative Oath are to be imposed upon the Subjects, yet the
distinction being made between the times of Peace and these of War takes off
from the value of the exceptions: where two Parties are extremely opposite,
each Party striving to make good their Interest, if the one may impose what
Oaths they please as the Kings party did at Oxford, to enjoin all within their
power (whether satisfied in their Consciences of the truth thereof or no) to
swear that he was a Just, Pious and Protestant Prince, the present Powers may
enjoyne what they think fit in their prudence and knowledge of him to abrogate
this latter Oath, and to forbid the assisting him

In the Convocation House at Oxford their examining the Ordinance for enjoining
all the Three particulars forementioned, they should as well have examined the
Reasons of the Ordaining them, they should have premised and stated the
occasion the beginning of the War how it came to be waged by whose means on
which side the Offensive, on which the Defensive was; For to measure the thing
enjoined by the particular events, by the subsequent and emergent actings, as
what has since fallen out, what has been done what required to be done, is no
good or adequate rule: had the matter occasioned been more suitable to the
occasion, their exceptions against those Ordinances had more availed their
Cause.

The urging the transgression of a known Law ( viz.) the 11 of Hen 7. 18. [
That none that shall attend upon the King and do him true service, shall be
attainted or forfeit any thing] fitteth not this present case, neither do they
who urge the same, rightly examine the occasion and ground of enacting it, the
Parliaments imprisoning fining their Enemies, is no transgression of that Law
if rightly and formally understood, and wherefore it was made; The reason of
enacting that Law is to be weighed, It was not with the late King as with Henry
the seventh, the late King had no foreign or domestique VVarres, none stood
in Rivalship with him for his Crown, he came in Peace and by a lineall
succession to it: when that Law was made in the eleventh of Henry the seventh
his Reign and after his conquest made, many the like Laws were made in
several Parliaments from his first coming to the Crown in relation to the
security and attendance upon his person meeting with a Rebellion in the Kingdom
of Ireland, mutinous and male-contented Subjects in the Kingdom here, ready to
bid battle to him, the Parliament called when that Law was made (therefore
styled by a learned Sir Francis Bacon on the life of Hen. the 7th.
Writer a Parliament of War being indeed in substance a Declaration only of a
War against two potent Kings Charles the eighth of France and James the fourth
of Scotland two Neighboring Enemies of Henry the seventh) and then enacted
with some Statutes conducing thereunto as the severe punishing mortpayes and
keeping back Soldiers wages by their Captains, the like severity for the
departure of Soldiers without License, strengthening of the Common Law in
favor of protections for those that were in the Kings service, and setting the
gate open and wide for men to sell and morgage their Lands without Fines for
alienation to furnish themselves wi^h money for the War, and lastly the voyding
all Scottish men out of England; So the reader may observe wherefore that
Statute so much urged against this present Parliament and on the Kings behalf
was enacted which also the aforesaid Writer judges to be more just then
legal, more magnanimous than prudent, his reason was That it was both
agreeable to reason of State that the Subjects then should not enquire of the
Justice of the Kings Title or Quarrel, as also to good Conscience that
whatsoever the fruits of War were, the Subjects should not suffer for their
obedience, besides it did the better take away the occasion for the people to
busy thewselves to pry into the Kings Title or Quarrel for that however it
fell, their safety was already provided for, withal it could not but greatly
draw unto him the love and hearts of his people because he seemed more careful
for them then for himself, the Writer excellently disputes the quality of that
Statute setting forth the reason for, the inconvenience against the making it,
observing also that it did take off from his party that great tie and spur of
necessity to go Victours out of the field considering their lives and fortunes
were put in safety and protected whether they stood to it or ran away,
concluding the force and obligation of the Law to be in it self Illusory as to
the latter part of it by a precedent act of Parliament to bind and frustrate a
future; whenas a supreme and absolute power cannot conclude it self neither
that which is in nature revocable be made fixed* no more then if a men should
appoint or declare by his Will that if he made any latter Will it should be
void. the quality of the Statute it self being considered as to the Imprisoning
Fining some of the Kings Party for adhering unto for taking part with him
against the known and fundamental Laws seem to be of no use to the present
Quarrel betwixt the late King and the People, that objected Statute seeming
Temporary only, whereupon the aforesaid Writer concludes with this Aphorism
that things that do not bind may satisfy for the tim^.

But to return to the occasion of this War, how unhappily continued how
easily the terms of dissension now in being are reconcilable how petty a
difference there is betwixt the two Tenants of Independent Presbyterian is easy
for any man to know who shall enquire into the quality of either, of what growth
settlement and extent they are, the one the Presbyterian not ripe enough as yet
to be established, neither the times now fit to entertain a fixed or
established form of Government to bind all sorts of men, many having been left
at liberty whether they have or will take the Covenant, many who have taken it
thinking themselves not obliged forthwith and in all parts to keep it having
for some cause discovered since their taking set it aside: The other the
Independent a seeming rather then a certain abdication or total renouncing all
Government or for ever, the Lord General and his army called Independents (but
why let them that call them so answer for it) have solemnly In the Remonstrance
dated Nov. 1648. page 6.
declared against such disorder and non-Government: There are it is to be
believed some adhering to the Parliament other of the same sort belonging to or
having been of the Army that desire an independent and unlimited Power which
neither derives its beginning nor receives its bounds from the Magistrate which
kind of humor the Parliament neither See the Declaration of the Lords and
Commons in Answer to the Scots Commissioners dated the fourth of March, 1647.
approves nor admits of. There are some besides styled Independents and
many of them may happily desire to shake off that heavy yoke of Government which
grown through the corruption of manners and indulgency of times into abuse
exorbitancy and oppressings does gall and heavily press their Fellow Subjects
necks not by an easy or ordinary course to be taken off; yet the granting these
proves not that the Parl. maintains or which is less allows Disorder or
Non^Government in a Commonwealth, the Division between them two Presbyterian
and Independent was handsomely hatched and as cunningly carried on by the
Common Enemy on purpose by Dividing to overcome them both, or as is before
observed, it befell through their pride of Conquering: The main and original
difference first in dispute between the Kings party and the Parliament's arose
from matter of Fact which brought in this dispute or question (amongst other
things) unto whose charge the Deluge of blood spilt in this War is to be
laid: The Parliament has declared, That it is to be l^i^ at the King and his
Parties doors: For instance sake, The bloud-guilty and horrid act of hindering
the relief of Ireland whereby thousands of his Protestant Subjects have been
slain, which holds the three heretofore united Kingdoms in a languishing and
sad estate even at this day, the one divided against the other and many of the
People of all three despairing to enjoy their former P^ace, the Parliament

Member of this State of England is by his and his Party's abetting it put into
a Condition and even invited to invade and conquer This, And what was wanting
to be further acted by himself and his Council is now set on and continued by
his Party, hindering the supplies and forces sent over by the Parliament to
reduce the Rebels, raising and somenting a new War between Us and the Scots
to divert the Forces intended for the relief of Ireland, that by a War with
Scotland the English may be less enabled to prosecut^ their design in Ireland.
That the Commissioners sent by the two Houses of Parliament for the better
supply and encouragement of the Army in that Kingdom, were discountenanced and
commanded from the Council there where the prosecution of the War was to be
managed. The Houses of Lords and Commons in the debate with the King about the
Affairs of Ireland sent him word that his Message then sent to Them wherein He
charge them with false pretenses and a purpose in Them to divert large sums
of money collected from the English from the proper use to which it was
intended, was an high breach of the Privilege of Parliament, and upon that
occasion They declare many particulars of their care for the reliese of I^eland
and the Kings hindering it. Those particulars there expressed are as follows,
They declare that this bloody Rebellion was first raised by the same Counsel
that had before brought two great Armies within the bowels of this Kingdom
and two Protestant Nations ready to welter in each others blood, which were
both defrayed a long time at the charge of the poor Commons in England, and
quietly at last disbanded by Gods blessing on the Parliaments endeavors; That
this design failing, the same wicked Counsel who had caused that impious War
raised this barbarous Rebellion in Ireland and recommended the suppressing
thereof for the better color to the Parliaments care who out of a
fellow-feeling of the unspeakable miseries of their Protestant Brethren there,
not suspecting this horrid Plot (now too apparent) did cheerfully undertake
that great work, and do really intend and endeavor to settle the Protestant
Religion and a permanent Peace in that Realm, to the glory of God, the honor
and profit of his Majesty, and security of his three Kingdoms: But how they
have been discouraged retarded and diverted in and from this pious and glorious
work by those traitorous Counsels about his Majesty will appear by these
particulars. They there mention the sending over at the first of twenty
thousand pounds by the Parliament and that good way found out to reduce Ireland
by the Adventure of private men without charging the Subject in general, which
would probably have brought in a million of money had the King continued in or
near London, and not by leaving his Parliament and making War upon it so
intimidated and discouraged the Adventurers and Others who would have
adventured, that that good Bill is rendered in a manner ineffectuall. They
mention that when at the sole charge of the Adventurers five thousand Foot and
five hundred Horse were designed for the relief of Munster under the Command of
an English The Lord w^a^ton.
Lord, and nothing was wanting but a Commission to enable him for the service,
such was the power of wicked Counsel that no Commission could be obtained from
the King, by reason whereof Lymrick was wholly lost and the Province of Munster
since in very great distress, That when well-affected Persons at their own
charges by way of Adventure had prepared diverse Ships and Pinnaces with a
thousand Land Forces for the service of Ireland, desiring nothing but a
Commission from his Majesty, that Commission after twice sending to York for it
and the Ships lying ready to set sail three weeks together at the charge of
near three hundred pounds a day was likewise denied, and those Adventurers
rather than to lose their Expedition were constrained to go by virtue of an
Ordinance of both Houses of Parliament, That although the Lords Justices of
Ireland earnestly desired to have some pieces of Battery sent over as necessary
for that service, ^et such Command was given to the Officers of the Tower that
n^ne of the Kings Ordnance must be sent to save his Kingdom, That a prime
Engineer and Quarte^ master General of the Army in Ireland and in actual
employment there against the Rebels was called away from that important
service by express command from the King, That a Captain Comptroller of the
Artillery a man in pay and principally employed and trusted here by the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland for providing and ordering the Train of Artillery which
was to be sent to Dublin, and who had received great sums of money for that
purpose, was Commanded from that Employment and Trust to serve the King in this
unnatural War against his Parliament, and when the Parliament had provided
many hundred suits of Clothes and sent them toward Chester, the Waggoners that
undertook the Carriage of them were assaulted by the Kings Soldiers lying
about COVENTRY who took away the Clothes, That three hundred suits of Clothes,
sent likewise by the Parliament for Ireland toward Chester were all taken away
by the Kings Troopers under their Captain allowing it. As likewise that a great
number of Draught-Horses prepared by the Parliament for the Artillery and
Baggage for the Irish Army and sent to Chester for that purpose, being there
attending a Passage were then required by the King for his present service in
England, whose Forces were so quart^r^d about the Roads to Ireland that no
Provision could pass thither by Land with any safety, That two other Captains
the the Admiral and Vice Admiral of the ships appointed to lie upon the Coast
of Ireland, to annoy the Rebels and to prevent the bringing Ammunition and
Relief from Foreign Parts were both called away from that employment by the
Kings Command and by reason of their departure from the Coast of Munster to
which they were designed, the Rebels there have received Powder Ammunition and
other Relief from Foreign Parts. By which See these Charges mentioned by the
two Houses of Parliament against the King in M^. May his History lib. 1. cap.

particulars say they it may seem that those Rebels were countenanced there to
assist the Enemies of the Parliament here especially considering that those
confident Rebels have presumed very lately to send a Petition to the King
entituling themselves his Majesty's Catholic Subjects of Ireland, complaining
of the Puritan Parliament of England and desiring that since his Majesty comes
not over thither according to their expectation they may come into England to
his Mai^sty.

These are the Charges whereof both Houses of Parliament have in these very
words accused the King and cannot look back to retract their Charge: And what,
at the beginning of this War, was imputed to the Kings evil Counsel as
their crime in seducing him to an arbitrary and tyrannical way of Government,
to the countenancing if not the promoting this Rebellion of the Irish, even now
mentioned, to the refusing to sign the Proposition tendered to him by the two
Houses of Parliament as the only and necessary means for settling a firm and
well-grounded Peace (with other of the like kind which might be instanced in)
the Houses out of tenderness to his honor would have remitted as to him,
being willing to abstract and sever his personal Acts from the Acts of such
his Counsel: yet he refuses not to excuse his Counsel nor positively or
seriously denies those Charges as to himself, only jestingly declines the
particular presumptions wherewith he was charged of his privily countenancing
that Rebellion in Ireland as not worth the answering; Withal whereas the Kings
party argue to have the King himself excused, his Counsel blamed for his
mis-government, they must as well distinguish betwixt his Counsel before the
War and his Counsel since the War began and limit it to whom of that his
Counsel were his Seducers: so the distinguishing before the War began, between
the Kings own Acts and those of his evil Counsel seems to be of no value
whereby to excuse the King, and wholly and in a general way to charge his
Counsel indefinitely named [ his Evil Counsell] igno^ely spoken who they
were, neither assigning or setting forth (as the Arguers in the particulars
should for the better completing their Apology for the King) who the
Super-intendent and President of that Counsel was: Besides, the King
contending on the one hand to rescue and protect whom the Parliament on the
other did contend to punish, it was a matter of no small difficulty to discern
and judge by the understanding how an abstract and separation might be had
betwixt the King and that his Counsel they mutually and strenuously contending
to assist and defend one another.

The Question therefore by way of Argument betwixt the Kings party and the
Parliaments as between the Commissioners employed on either side to Treat,
admits now no verbal or written Answer to or Denying; it is to be determined
by no other Umpire then the Sword, and what the two opposite Parties have a
long time strove for, the one defending their Cause in their Books and Writings
by vehemence and height of Wit, the other theirs by solid and substantial
Prudence seems to be left to the Conqueror to determine.

What the odds is betwixt their Writings because controverted by either side
which Party does declare and argue more prudentially the Reasons of their
several undertakings in this Quarrel as which Party the Kings or the
Parliaments have writ more sufficiently and substantially concerning the
subject of their Proceedings in this War, whose Writings and Declarations
have been more true, whose most seditious and false, which Party has in their
several Books been most seriously and truly charged and accused of offending,
which more genuinely and sincerely have argued, let the Reader judge: So
because there may not want Fuel for Contention it is debated concerning the
actions of Violence and Terror to the People on either part (the Kings and the
Parliaments) which did act with more Cruelty by putting all sorts of People to
the Sword, spoiling, consuming with sire laying wast Houses, Villages, Towns,

fire against the one in a sad Record.

As to the Writings on either side where the one has propounded and objected
what the other has answered, for instance sake take three or four here
following for the rest.

First the Letter to the Governor and Council of War at Bristol (that City
being then a Garrison for the Parliament) from the Lord Lieutenant-Generall of
the Kings Forces See Master May his History of the Parliament of England

Book of an unknown Author called The State's Martyr.
Print to be an insolent Pamphlet with other words of scorn, which Letter and
Answer being here set down, the Reader may discern the difference between the
weight of either.

PATRICK Earl of FORTH Lord ETTERICK, and Lord Lieutenant-Generall of all his
Majesty's Forces.
I Having been informed, that lately at a Council of War you have condemned to
death Robert Yeomans late Sheriff of Bristol, who has his Majesty's
Commission for raising a Regiment for his service, William Yeomans his Brother,
George Bourchier, and Edward Dacres, all for expresing their Loyalty to his
Majesty, and endeavoring his service, according to their Allegiance, and that
you intend to proceed speedily against others in the like manner; do therefore
signify to you, that I intend speedily to put Master George, Master Stephens,
Captain Huntley, and others, taken in Rebelion against his Majesty at
Cyrencester, into the same condition. I do further advise you that if you offer
by that unjust judgment to execute any of them you have so condemned; that
those here in Custody Master George Master Stephens and Captain Huntley must
expect no Favor or Mercy.

Given under mine hand at Oxford this 16th. of May 1643. FORTH.
To the Commander in chief of the Council of War at Bristoll.

The Answer of this Letter was as follows.

NATHANIEL FIENNES Governor, and the Council of War in the City of BRISTOL.
HAving received a writing from your Lordship, wherein it is declared, that
upon information of our late proceedings against Robert Yeomans, William
Yeomans, and others, you intend to put Master George, Master Stephens, Captain
Huntley and others into the same condition, we are well assured that neither
your Lordship, or any other mortal man can put them into the same condition,
for whither they live or dye, they will always be accounted true and honest
men faithful to their King and Country and such as in a fair and open way
have always prosecuted that cause, which in their judgment guided by the
judgment of the highest Court they held the justest; whereas the Conspirators
of this City must both in life and death carry perpetually with them the Brand
of Treachery and Conspiracy; and if Robert Yeomans had made use of his
commission in an open way he should be put in no worse condition then others in
the like kind bad been; but the law of Nature amongst all men, and the Law of
arms among Soldiers make a difference between open Enemies and secret Spies
and Conspirators. And if you shall not make the like distinction we do signify
unto you that we will not only proceed to the execution of the persons already
condemned, but also of diverse others of the Conspirators, unto whom we had some
thoughts of extending mercy. And do further advise you, that if by any
inhumane and un-souldier-like sentence, you shall proceed to the execution of
the persons by you named, or any other of our friends in your custody that have
been taken in a fair and open way of War, then Sir Walter Pie, Sir William
Crofts and Colonel Connesby, with diverse others taken in open Rebelion and
actual War against the King and Kingdom, whom we have here in custody, must
expect no Favor or Mercy: And by Gods blessing upon our most just Cause, we
have powers enough for our friends security without taking in any that have
gotten out of our reach and power, and although diverse of yours of no mean
quality and condition have been released by us.

Given under our hand the 18th. of May 1643. Nathaniel Fiennes President.
Clement Walker etc.
To Patrick Earl of Forth Lord Lieutenant-Generall.

Secondly See the Message and Answer.
That from the Marquess of Argyle and Sir William Armine Commissioners from
both Kingdoms of England and Scotland, fully and in few words delivering their
Intentions and Reasons for the Summons sent to the Governor of Carlisl^ a
Garrison for the King, with his Answer to them, full of words, pregnancy of wit
and jealousy, rejecting their Summons, and some of his Party derogating
elsewhere from the worth of See the History of the Kings affairs in Scotland,
etc. where the Historian speaking of the Marquesses M^n^^osse and Argyle, the
Generals of the two opposite Armies in the Kingdom of Scotland he highly
ex^olls M^ntrosse and as much reviles and derogates from Argyle, rendering him

one of the Commissioners.

A See it cited in the Oxford Declaration page 1^.
third of no great length the Reader has it in the very words sent from both
Houses of Parliament to the King, with his Parties descant and scornful
Comment on the same.

The Message sent from both Houses of Parliament to the King.
WE the Lords and Commons assembled in the Parliament of England taking into
our Consideration a Letter sent from your Majesty dated the third of March
instant and directed to the Lords and Commons of Parliament assembled at
Westminster, (which by the contents of a Letter from the Earl of Forth unto
the Lord General the Earl of Essex we conceive was intended to our selves)
Have resolved with the concurrent advice and consent of the Commissioners of
the Kingdom of Scotland to represent to your Majesty in all humility and
p^ai^ness^ as follows.

That as we have used all means for a just and safe Peace; so will we never be
wanting to d^e our utmost for the procuring thereof: But when we consider the
expressions in that Letter of your Majesty's, we have more sad and despairing
thoughts of attaining the same then ever; because thereby those persons now
assembled at Ox^ord who contrary to their duty have deser^ed your Parliament
are put into an equal condition with it, and this Parliament co^v^ned
according to the known and fundamental Laws of the Kingdom (the continuance
whereof is established by a Law, consented unto by your Majesty) is in effect
denied to be a Parliament, the scope and intention of that Letter being to make
provision how all the Members (as it is pretended) of both Houses, may securely
meet in a full and free Convention of Parliament whereof no other conclusion
can be made, but that this present Parliament is not a full and free Convention
of Parliament, and that to make it a full and free Convention of Parliament the
presence of those is Necessary, who notwithstanding that they have deserted
that great Trust and do levy War against the Parliament, are pretended to be
Members of the two Houses of Parliament.

And hereupon we think our selves bound to let your Majesty know that seeing
the continuance of this Parliament is settled by a Law (which as all other Law^s
of your Kingdoms your Majesty has sworn to maintain, as we are sworn to our
All giance to your Majesty, those obligations being reciprocal) we must in
duty and accordingly are resolved with our Lives and Fortunes to defend and
preserve the Just Rights and full power of this Parliament; And do beseech
your Majesty to be assured, That your Majesty's Royal and hearty concurrence
with us herein will be the most effectual and ready means of procuring a firm
and lasting peace in all your Majesty's Dominions and of begetting a perfect
understanding between your Majesty and your People, without which your
Majesty's most earnest Professions and our real Intentions concernign the
same, must necessarily be frustrated. And in case your Majesty's three
Kingdoms should by reason thereof, remain in this sad and bleeding condition,
tending by the continuance of this unnatural War to their Ruin, your
Majesty cannot be the least nor last sufferer. God in his goodness incline
your Royal breast out of pity and compassion to th^se deep sufferings of your
Innocent People, to put a speedy and happy issue to these desperate Evils by
the joint advice of both your Kingdoms now happily united in this Cause by
their late Solemn League and Covenant. Which as it will prove the surest
remedy, so is it the earnest Prayer of your Majesty's loyal Subjects, the
Lords and Commons assembled in the Parliament of England.

Westminster the 9th. day of March. 1643. Gray of Wark Speaker of the House of
Peers pro tempore. William Lenthall Speaker of the Commons-House in PARLIAMENT.



The Kings parties Apprehension and Comment on the Letter in these words.

Whosoever considers that this should be a Letter from Subjects might well
think it very unbeseeming language in them to call his Majesty's earnest
endeavors for peace but Professions, and their own feigned pretenses most
real Intentions, but much more wonder at that menacing language, that his
Majesty cannot be the least nor the last sufferer; which expressions from
Subjects in Arms to their Sovereign, what dangerous construction they may
admit, we are unwilling to mention. Thus much for the Kings parties Comment on
the Letter.

One other intercourse of Messages between both Parties of a latter time. The
Summons sent by the Committee of both Kingdoms to the Governor of Newarke for
surrendering that Town and Fort. The Sea the Kings Letter March 23. 1644. and
the Committees Summons in April following.
Summons expressing persuasive and valid reasons to surrender it, the Governor
rather his Secretaries Answer full of good Language, courage and strength of
wit, wherein mentioning the Kings Letter sent the 23 of March 1644. unto both
Houses of Parliament, he urges the Kings granting Graecious Conditions, and
proves it, in that he would Disband his Forces Dismantle his Garrisons etc. he
who penned the Answer recites not all the Kings Proposalls, as that he would
have withal his Friends pardoned, the Sequestration taken from off their
Estates and the like: either he saw not the Kings whole Letter, being he
recites but one part only, or else he smiles in his sleeve, thinking by his
reserved Comment on the Letter to satisfy the Committee there and the whole
Kingdom besides of the Kings gracious inclination in that Letter, whereof the
Answerer recites but one part: the offering those promises which he mentions
and commends the King for, seems like Satan's contracting with our Savior in
the Gospel who tells him of large gifts to give him all the Kingdoms of the
Earth and the glory of them, but on what condition? On such as Christ his
purity and immunity from all sin could not accept viz. to fall down and
worship him. The Kings Letter was easily to be understood by any who shall read
it collectively and all together but not a part only, as of disbanding his
Forces dismantling his Garrisons with other the like gracious proffers made;
but on what condition are they made? to have his friends pardoned and their
Sequestra^i^ns wholly taken off. Such manner of collective speaking being
conditional the one is not expected to be done on the one side, if the rest be
not performed on the other. The Answerer's mentioning so much of the Letter as
may serve the turn in reciting the Kings gracious promise leaves out on what
condition the promise is made: the condition annexed to the promise frustrates
the virtue of the promise, for that which the answerer calls gracious in the
Kings Letter of Disbanding his forces, if nothing else were to be expected are
in every man's Judgment as in the Answerers gracious indeed, but that the Kings
expects to have his Friends pardoned the Sequestrations wholly taken off from
their Estates, were by the Parliaments giving way to the revoking their own
Judgments to accuse themselves of Injustice-doing to put them whom they
accounted Offenders and their enemies into as good or better condition then
their own friends, the Answerer if knowing the Kings whole letter and would
contract it into parts reciting only that which serves his turn, the Committee
being presumed solid and understanding Gentlemen would questionless follow the
dictates of their own Judgment without replying to the Answerer.

For an handsome Dialect and height of wit which happily may delight some Readers
but cures not the distempers and calamities of a Civil war, nor satisfies the
serious expectation of unbiassed spectators or Actors in these Tragedies, it is
confessed that the Assembly at Oxford and their Party in their Quarters there
having the more facete and nimble wits with the help and influence of the Youth
and Scholars there, not ripe enough nor versed in the Laws and policies of a
State, may seem to exceed the Parliament and those whom the Parliament imployes
in their expressions, but let the Books on either side be examined by the test
of Reason and Prudence, the Reader will soon discern the difference and these
four remarkable Messages instanced in may decide the contest, none other of
all their conflicts of that kind being more opposite each to other, nor any of
their Messages reciprocally sent more disdainfully rejected on either side then
these four abovementioned.

The Convocation house at Oxford urging a violation of that Statute 11 Hen. 7
before recited, and in page 31 of their Book ( viz.) that [ None that shall
attend upon the King and do him true Service shall be attainted etc.] therefore
requiring the people by virtue of that Statute to assist the King contrary to
the Negative Oath imposed by the Parliament in these words [ That I will no^
directly nor indirectly adhere unto or willingly assist the King in this Cause
or War against the Parliament nor any Forces raised without the consent of
the two Houses of Parliament.] The words [ assisting him] are made use of only
without the termination or qualification how or on what terms; neither the
People nor the Parliament (the Representative of the People) in Henry the
seventh his time would have made or consented to a Law made noxious to
themselves: If Henry the seventh had several ways oppressed his people and
afterward taken up arms to maintain his oppression, the Parliament would
questionles have forborne the enacting such a Law, the Title whereof especially
relating to the doing the King true service; wherefore unless true and lawful
be contradictory terms which no man will suppose, that Statute was not so fitly
applied in opposition to the Negative Oath, Neither does the Objectour taking
out only the word assisting and confining it to such a contracted sense as may
serve his turn, satisfy the impartial Reader weighing and examining the
tenor of the Statute and wherefore it was enjoined.

But to the Reasons of the Presbyterians and their parties deserting their
first judgment if so they have, it may be rather judged to be a fencing and
trial of wits in an argumentative way of discoursing only, then any settled
revolting from their first opinion. They are well read in the good man's
Character who will not be afraid for any evil tidings, his heart stands fast
and will not shrink until etc. which suiteth well with the beginning of their
Covenant, That they will sincerely really and constantly in their several
places etc. Sincerely and Really that is with all truth and faithfulness,
Constantly which is without defection or falling off on trivial dissentings in
judgment and opinion: The Arguments they have lately taken up against the
residing part of the Parliament and the Army, the maintainer of their power,
and next under God the preserver of our Peace, are none of the more eminent
sort of the Presbyterian Parties nor like to theirs, rather from a more
wilful and weaker sort. The House of Parliament being grown thin by their
first dividing, is by the Presbyterians deserting it become more thin, the
more weak it is through their defections the more need it has of being
supported by their return. As for the Force which they and their sub-divided
Party urge to be offered to them by the Army their Servants, an high affront
and breach of Parliament Privileges, both parties Presbyterian and Independent
seem to be forced alike though not in an equal degree of strength and number
yet in a strict and closer tie of Policy and Prudence by and through an extreme
and inevitable necessity for the preservation of themselves and their fellow
Subjects, neither they nor any of their party can devise or act a means how to
s^ttle such a course as may prevent a total confusion or the overthrow of
those who have already prevailed by the Sword, Nor to Still the common Enemy
and Avenger; but if he being hard driven should by Treaty or other unsafe way
of settling a peace have prevailed he had been left at liberty to do his
pleasure: in Treaties or like ways of Parleance what security could he have
given or would he have kept commensurate to the safety and welfare of many
thousands engaged in this quarrel to the avoidance of those dangers and
jealousies administered by him? The example of Henry the third of England is
memorable for his compliance and giving way unto a Treaty, his signing Articles
to perform the Treaty, but when he had by that recovered his power again kept
none of them. But to the Presbyterians Arguments, and their paralleling the
Kings offering a force to six members of the Houses of Parliament to the force
offered unto the e^ected and repulsed Members by the Army: the King might by an
usurped authority break in and do whatsoever he pleased, to grieve and vex
whosoever should not submit to his will, to exercise a regal power above the
Laws from assuming unto himself by a strong self conceit an unlimited
Sovereignty and transcendency of Might in nothing to be resisted, to awe and
force this present Parliament and all future Parliaments (in case he had any
purpose to summon any more) to his beck as it is probable. Not long after, by the
like menacing and imperious Act of Proclaming those Gentlemen See the
Proclamation in the Kings name set forth 1642* accusing many Gentlemen serving
as Knights and Burgesses for their several and respective Count^es to be
Tray^ors and their Persons to be seized on as Rebels.
Traitors who either obeyed not or refused to conform to his present will:
There was no necessity but his sole will to force all those who complied not
with him to save and rescue his creatures from the hand of justice; and whether
there be not now a stronger necessity then before the great and universal
engagement of many good and deserving men, let all men judge. In that the
Presbyterians take it ill that their servants (so the Army style themselves)
should force their Masters, they are not simply and precisely servants
immediate, many of them their equals as being Members of the same Parliament
and Commanders and Officers in the Army, the private Soldiers commanded and
led by them; or the Army relatively unto Them as Jurors in a trial of Right at
Westminster before a number of Judges (for so the Parliament are although the
resemblance holds not adequately as to an Army and to a Jury) Let a Mayor part
of the Judges incline or direct which way they please yet an upright Jury will
find according to the evidence in being: The evidence in this case is the
certainty of knowing and recollecting things past, the foresight of things to
come, which induces them to bring in such verdict as may render all things
just and safe: for when it shall happen to be debated which ought to be
prefered, The Privilege of Parliament or the safety of a Kingdom every one can
judge which ought to sway the Balance. Again admit (...) Army to be their
Servants (yet properly they are servants unto those from whom they receive
their pay, that is from the Kingdom and the Representative thereof, neither
from the Presbyterian nor Independent party) In a mixed and joint Government
where more then one commands and a mutual consent had betwixt the Governors
that the People to be commanded shall obey the discreeter party, they mutually
consent that the people shall be directed by the wiser of the two; there it is
left to the Election and discretion of the people which of them to pay
obedience unto: It skills not in a governing and politic body (consisting of
many Ruling and all consenting in the maine) which is the Major part or which
is to be obeyed, unless that Major part will do the work themselves without
the help of those whom they do employ: that part rather it should seem most fit
to be obeyed, which acts and endeavors (without respect had to the Majority)
in the more prudent watchful and safe way, so it is no disobedience or affront
offered by their Army, where obedience may be dangerous to the obeyers, to the
Parliament Party of what kind soever and Their adherents. The Quarrel is not
between a power of a momentary and slight concernment on the one side, and a
vanishing and light obedience on the other, but a long and thoroughly
controverted contention between two Powers upon the issue whereof the safety
and welfare of the two Kingdoms does rest, and besides that, on which the
Correspondencies Observations and Commerce between Them and most Foreigners
throughout the Christian World (looking on the passages of our Affairs and
giving Judgment thereupon) depends. It may seem as the design is driven on a
Contention tripartite, handsomely devised and with a great dexterity of wit
carried on by the common Enemy, in that some of the Kings Party prefer the
Presbyterian before the Independent, some the Independent before the
Presbyterian, See the (...) in Treatise 17. on Church Government.
ha^ing both yet they give good words unto and comply with the more
discontented and weaker party until by their cunning Artifice they overcome
them also, so in this Legerdemain and sleight of wit blow the coals of
Dissension betwixt them both, those of the Presbyterian can look for no other
then Polyphemus his courtesy to be of those last to be devoured. The
Presbyterian out of zeal for the maintenance of his Cause not foreseeing what
danger might befall by his Dividing fondly conceives that either the War is
ended, therefore he may now safely Divide from those with whom he heretofore
has joined or that his Cause for the Covenant sake is so good that to
maintain his Tenent he sticks not at the endangering himself and his Friends,
nor that the Enemy having his Friends and instruments up and down in all
Corners of the Realm will and can keep those two parties now in difference at
that distance that they shall not be able to join their Forces again to conquer
him: where it is not meant to involve all Presbyterians in the same Tenants or
Intents, Counsels and Affections, for it is to be believed there are a
considerable party amongst them who rightly apprehend the true state of the
Controversy between Us and the Scots, and cannot but foresee that a compliance
with the Scots as matters now stand would prove pernicious to the English
Nation as well to themselves as to the Independents so termed, for
notwithstanding any pretended difference between them they cannot well avoid
the danger of jointly suffering if by their Dividing the public and common
safety be deserted.

Besides as to the major and minor part of Members sitting in the House or
secluded, or voluntarily absenting themselves from the House, so that the
greater number are absent as the Presbyterian reckons, he must take heed of
that Objection least he open an old wound long since salved up (through Gods
blessing on their success) and that Objection be made use of against them all
of both Houses, and against that Authority whereby they have at any time acted
since the Contention first began betwixt the Kings Party's claim to their
Parliament at Oxford, and the Parliament Party's claim to theirs at
Westminster; For if the Kings Party did rightly calculate their Numbers which
were in both Houses of Lords and Commons See their Declaration Printed at
Oxford, March 1643. toward the end of the Book.
258. either personally sitting or absent upon employment for the King, that
number exceeded that of those sitting at Westminster, so that the Argument for
the mayor part of the number of Members Presbyterially affected and that way
Covenanted, against which ( viz. the Covenant) the King friends have learnedly
as yet unansweredly In a Book styled [ The present judgment of the Corvocation
at Oxford, dated June 1647.] which if weighed with the Arguments in the Letter
written by the London Ministers to the Lord Fairfax and his Council of War,
dated January 1648. in behalf of the Covenant and the keeping it the Reader
will soon discern the odds.
argued is no safe or prudent Argument at this time to be used, (however the
Covenant and the Reasons for keeping it are abetted and seconded in an
elaborately written Letter by the London. Ministers) least they help their
first and common Enemy to rowse an Objection which has a long time slept for
the maintaining their Parliament at Oxford, For, by the way, had those
Ministers employed their pains in answering that Book first, which indeed was
worthy of and required an Answer to have cleared the Question, their Letter
might have been better credited and more universally received, which Book had
it come sooner to the public view and before the universal entering into the
Covenant, many had been drawn for the reasons therein expressed from taking the
Covenant.

The Ministers in that their Letter much insist on the Protestation taken May
1641. wherein the Protesting is for the maintenance of the Kings Honor, Person
and Estate, yet the End (at which all matters of weight do aim) is the
Preservation of Religion, Laws and Liberties. The maintenance of the Kings
Honor, etc. is but a piece of the Protestation, the sum, full sense and scope
thereof the Preservation of Religion and Laws. The Principles which were first
engaged upon and protested for if rightly cast up but two in Chief, the
securing the Protestant Religion, the Primum quaerite, the preservation of the
Laws and Peace, the Suprema Lex Salus Populi.
chiefest Law the Peoples safety, the other Principles are subservient only,
and fall in by way of complication and dependency upon those two as the Means
unto the End.

The well weighing the Protestation might have confined and settled the
unresolved and doubtful thoughts of man in what the End and Aim of the
Protestation was, a Promise to fulfill as much as in us lies the Commandments
of the first and second Table of the Law directing our duty toward God and
Man, the several parts in the Protestation tending in the sum to the
maintenance of Gods Honor, the Kings, the Subjects Right and Liberty, no one
part thereof if rightly applied and understood crossing another, and therefore
how comes it to pass, that the Protestation being one and the same, the course
of men's affections should be thus divided into Factions and Part-takings, or
that some should be of opinion, That [ To maintain the Kings Honor, Person
and Estate, is to adhere unto him in this present War in what he shall
command?] even because they do not equally weigh each part of the Protestation
(viz.) The defense of the Protestant Religion, the Power and Privileges of
Parliament, the Subjects Right and Liberty, for by the Protester's observing
all, the King is best observed and truliest, his Honor and Promises being
engaged to maintain the latter three, when as every one who took the
Protestation did in his thoughts endeavor and intend according to his power to
make him a Sovereign Lord of a free and flourishing People, the Kings
Protestations concurring with and tending to that end, so the Protestation
taken all together is best observed and kept.

To the Protestation for the Defense of the Protestant Religion, every one who
takes it is not immediately and specially bound by virtue of his Vow to See the
Exhortation to the taking the Covenant for Reformation and Defense of Religion,
etc.
extirpate and remove all Papists or to offer violence to their persons, that
is above the Power and Liberty of every common Person, neither is wishing well
alone and sitting still a sufficient discharge of the Protesters duty of vowing
to endeavor: Endeavoring is a progressive motion and the Protesters
neglecting and supine failing to endeavor can be no better reckoned of in
these divided and subtle times then the Livy.
Historian did of those Soldiers who dreamed of their enemies Votis and
Seden^o debellari posse, or what the Isaiah.
Prophet does of the Egyptians, that their strength was sit^ing still: A
perfunctory and neutrall slackness in the Protester satisfies not the precept
which God himself enjoynes, When thou vowest a vow unto the Lord, thou shall

but endeavored against the same, others contemplatively only and remiss as

Orator,) who to carry on his Ambition and private Interests did outwardly
comply with all sides, concealing and reserving the affections of his heart to
his best advantage: The passive and faint observing of the Vow and Protestation
in some, the Acting contrary to it in others is a sin which GOD is justly
angry for, the neglect of which vow as we may justly fear (to use the very
words of the Sea the Exhortation of the Assembly of Divines to the taking the

that the Papist was then See the Lords and Commons Instructions for taking the
Covenant. The unanimous judgment of most part of the Kingdom observed by their
several Peti^ions at that time presented especially that of the Gentry and
Trained Bands of the County of Essex presented to their Lord Lieut. the Earl of
Warwick. Likewise Sir Benjamine Rudyard his speech in the beginning of this
Parliament about Popery countenanced. See Master May his History, Lib. 2.

connived at and countenanced by higher powers (for the Question is not about
the certain and actual bringing in of Popery, but touching the pregancy of
suspicion) if the Protestor adhereth to that party which promises to defend
the Protestant and opposes that which countenanceth the Popish, his
Protestation is then truliest kept, a promise or vow the more pursued the more
fulfilled; in like manner to the other part of the same Protestation viz. The
maintenance of the Kings honor, every one who takes the same is not thereby
bound to comply assent unto and obey the King in whatsoever he may command
whether unlawful or unjust, or to think all his attempts and actions
Justifiable throughout; This were indeed in the highest degree and seemingly to
honor him but in a more serious and as truly a loyal way of his being
honored by his Subjects is when they or those who are put in Place and
Auhority over them shall enquire into and provide against all things incident
to his Dishonor, when they shall endeavor to suppress all Astronts which may
be offered to his Dignity: This though a more remote and less flattering, yet
a more stableand certain discharge of duty in honoring him.

To the COVENANT, the Sea the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in
Parliament with Instructions for taking the Covenant.
Preamble prefixed thereto points at the sense thereof in these words.

Whereas a Covenant for reformation and preservation of Religion, the
maintenance and defense of Laws and Liberties has been thought a fit and
excellent means to acquire the favor of Almighty God toward the three
Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and likewise to unite, and by
uniting to strengthen and fortify them against the common Enemy of the true
reformed Religion peace and prosperity of these Kingdoms.

And in the Covenant it self wherein the Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Burgesses,
Ministers of the Gospel and Commons of all sorts in the Kingdoms of England
Scotland and Ireland do swear,

That they shall sincerely really and constantly through the grace of God
endeavor in their several Places and Callings the preservation of the
Reformed Religion.

Secondly, That they shall in like manner without respect of persons endeavor
the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, etc.

Thirdly, That they shall with the same reality and constancy in their several
vocations endeavor with their Estates and Lives mutually to preserve the
Rights and Privileges of the Parliament, and the Liberties of the Kingdoms, and
to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's Person and Authority in the
preservation and defense of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdoms.

Fourthly, That they shall with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of
all such as have been or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or Evil instruments
by hindering the reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his People, or
one of the Kingdoms from another, and them to bring to public trial.

Fifthly, That Justice may be done upon the wilful opposers of the firm
Peace and Union betwixt the Kingdoms.

Sixthly, That they shall in this common Cause of Religion Liberty and Peace of
the Kingdoms assist and defend all those that take the Covenant, and shall not
suffer themselves directly or indirectly by whatsoever combination persuasion
or terror to be divided or withdrawn from this Union or Conjunction.

The Objection which some men make that the late Engagement does cross the
Covenant at least one Article thereof [ of defending the Kings Person and
Authority] It seems not so if we go further to what his Person and Authority is
to be defended, and observe the whole Article, the current of the Covenant
being for the preservation of Religion, the Liberties the Peace and Union
betwixt the three Kingdoms against Papists Prelates Disturbers and Opposers of
such Peace Mr. Alexander Henderson in his reply to the Kings first Paper.
In diverse cases it cannot be denied but the obligation of an Oath or Covenant
does cease, As when we swear Homage and Fealty to our Lord and Superior, who
afterward cease to be our Lord and Superior, then the formal cause of the
Oath is taken away, and therefore the Obligation, Sublato relato tollitur
Correlatum. Admit that the three Kingdoms had been in imminent danger of
Invasion from a Foreign Enemy and the Subjects should for the defense thereof
enter into a Solemn League in these words, Whereas a League and Covenant for
strengthening the three Kingdoms is thought a safe and necessary means
conducing thereunto, That they will resist prevent, and bring to public
Trial all wilful Opposers of the safety of the said Kingdoms, with sow
other subordinate clauses and branches in the Covenant as namely, That they
will maintain the Chief Governor of them in his just Power etc. let it be the
King himself or some other supreme Power equal to the King, although the King
were to be valued as King David's People did value him at the price of ten
thousand of themselves, yet if there be a greater price at stake and the chief
Governor be false to his Trust in Government, that thereby the safety of many
hundred thousands be in jeapordy, that his design be probably such as to make
his way through the shedding the blood of many thousands for compassing it, and
rather than fail, engage the Kingdoms each against the other to the destruction
of all three; It cannot be thought a breach of the Covenant in the Covenanters
to remove the Governor, when as the more principal matters to be secured are
in danger to be destroyed: The Resemblance may be fitted in a case of a
narrower orb: if soldiers in a Town of Garrison for the better security of
the Town shall enter into a League and Covenant to preserve the Magazine
thereof, to keep witho^t making away or suffering to be made away the Arms and
Ammunition belonging to the Garrison, to defend the Governor thereof; if
notwithstanding this their Oath and League, they shall suspect Revolting in the
Governor, a Failer of his Trust whereby to turn the Arms and Ammunition
against the Garrison and the Inhabitants to the detriment and destruction of
the Town, so that upon good causes of suspicion of their Governors breach of
Trust they remove the Magazine and Arms, they withstand and resist the
Governor, it is no violation of their Oath, for what they swore was in order
and relation to the most considerable part of what they were to maintain, viz.
The defense of the Town and Garrison, without staying until they had too late
made a perfect and full discovery of the Governors Revolt and Falsehood; If the
King has given cause of suspicion of maintaining See the Essex Petition before
cited.
Popery, Prelacy, or of disturbing the Peace of any of these his Kingdoms, it
is no breach of the whole Covenant to provide against the endangering of what
they have Covenanted more principally to secure: The Question is not of the
King his enjoining, his immediate and actual bringing in of Popery (for then
his own Protestant Party would have failed him in the maintenance of his Cause
and Quarrel) nor of his upholding and adhering unto Prelacy, which the Sea

Hierarchicall Government) and had they not had tuition and support from his
exercising a more powerful Authority then their ordinary and meaner friends
could have supplied them with, there had not so much blood been spilt in this
Quarrel: So the substance and drift of the Covenant, one part of the Article
being [to defend the Kings Person and Authority] is not crossed by taking the
Engagement of late enjoined, if duly weighed.

Admit that the Letter of the Preamble to the Covenant did in the Covenant^rs
sense comprehend the Kings Heirs and Successors, yet still the maine and
principal parts of the Covenant are to be observed in order to the
preservation of the Protestant Religion, the Subjects Liberty, the Peace Union
and Safety of the three Kingdoms; So that if his Heirs and Successors shall be
discovered and known to tread in their Predecessour's steps, he having given
cause of suspicion of his endeavoring to overthrow them all, the Covenanters
could not both maintain the Honor of his Heirs and Successors, and yet in the
common Cause of Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdoms withstand as they
See the 6. Article of the Covenant.
protested they would, all opposition to be made against the same, and what
they could not of themselves suppress they would do their best to prevent and
remove.

The Scots our Covenant-Brethren cannot but confess that the words [ Preventing
and Opposing] in the Covenanter wi^h his large expression of bending his whole
force and power carry an universal and greater latitude then to take away the
present power of the Fathers Person, or that the Covenant should continue only
for his life time, seven years, and the term of life being by common repute in
men's commerce equivalent each with other: the Covenant (near half so many
years in framing) no doubt was made and entered into to remain for longer then
for so soon an expiring term as a man's life, to provide against his future and
successive power, To take the pains of removing Danger out of the Fathers
reach, and leave it in the Son or any of his Successors being of the Fathers
temper and laying His Cause to heart could not be thought a Task worthy of so
solemn a LEAGUE and COVENANT, or the Industry which both Kingdoms have taken
to settle their Peace and Liberties.

As to that part of the Covenant [that they had then no intention to diminish
the Kings just power and greatnesse] they might intend no less until they saw
they could not overcome him by humble applications and dutiful addresses, by
their Reasons, Declarations, and Messages, setting forth the wrongs and
injustices acted by his Ministers of Justice, the mischiefs and dangers
whereunto his Kingdoms were exposed unless he returned and hearkened to their
Councels and join in redress of such Grievances; yet notwithstanding those
faithful and humble expressions, that they could not discern any con^iscending
to such Pe^tions, any acknowledgment of his former errors, any placable or
propitious heart toward his Parliament and People, any purpose in him to sign
those Propositions as the only and necessary means for settling a safe peace
long since tendered to him jointly and unanimously by the Parliament then
sitting, whether Presbyterians or Independents as they are called, yet not
concluding or providing what was to be done in cased he did refuse; but instead
of sorrowing for what he had done his refusing to sign those Propositions and

whether and how far it is to be kept how little uniformity in the taking or

making it at first, or mis-representing by those who like it no^, that howbeit
one part thereof is That they had then no intention to diminish the King's just
Power and Greatness, the Author in the King's name conceives that it was made
and intended against the King as in many places of the Treatise against the
Covenant the Kings Party complains.

See also the Kings Declaration since the Paci^i^a^ion against the Scots and
the Covenant page 8 which opinion of his see confirmed in the Marquess of
Montrosse his Declaration set forth 1649 As in a B^ok called the History of the
Kings affairs in Scotland before cited, page 6.


one part of the Covenant then being, that they had no thought or intention to
diminish the Kings just power and greatness, another part (when they press
the Covenant-taking, the maintenance of the Peace and Union between the three
Kingdoms) they would bring to Justice all without respect of Persons who did or
should wilfully oppose the same or hinder such Peace or Union, so that if the
King did by himself, by his friends and followers by his example awing other
men from taking the Covenant or did by any Power or Commission whether to
defend himself or offend his Opposites act or abett whereby the Peace became
disturbed one Kingdom engaged against another, the Parl. could not according to
their Covenant preserve his Power and Greatness, and punish such without
respect of Persons as did wilfully oppose the Peace and Union (as is before
observed) comprehending within that Universality of [ without respect of
Persons] him and all who did adhere unto or take part with him, so that the
Covenant the parts whereof seem to be hetreogeneous and inconsistent within
themselves, and therefore not perfectly and exactly to be kept is either newly
to be molded, or which is more probable if he had had power to carry on his
purpose, the War to continue between the Covenan^ers and the Non-Covenanters,
many thousands of men neither having nor through the Kings example willing to
take the same.

By the observing the passages and times when the Covenant was made and
tendered, what since has happened, impartial men will judge that there was no
fraud or failing of syncerity in the Parliaments proposal of the Covenant
before, nor any backsliding or levity since in preferring the main end (which
was and still is the public safety) before any of the clauses supposed and
set down as conducible to the Covenant. The great Quarrel of profane and
ignorant persons against the uniforme current of the Holy Scripture, of an
higher concernment then an humane Covenant, is acutely taken up by a learned
Pa^au^.
Writer, Distingue tempora and reconciliantur Scripturae, in answer unto those
who cavil against the Scriptures as if the Texts thereof were dissonant and
repugnant each to other, as if Gods word (most certain and infallible in it
self) were contradictory to it self: distinguish between the time of the
Covenant taking four or five years before the time of bringing the King to
Trial, observe the limitation in the particle of the Covenant [That they had
then no intention to diminish the Kings Just Power] in opposition to unlawful
and Arbitrary, and you will find that the Covenant could not be so well and
safely taken or that it is not so heinously broken as some of the Covenanters
give out.

But to the Objections against the Army and the pow^^s establishing it, That in
adhering to them is to trust to an Arm of Flesh, so all sublunary and Earthly
Powers are but Arms of Flesh, and it does not therefore follow that those that
do set forth the Army do put their confidence in Them further then God is
pleased to give a blessing to their endeavourings. Secondly, That Independency
admits of all Irreligion, Heresies, etc. The Proposition is not well proved, in
that some particular Soldiers others well-wishing to the Army do devise and
publish strange and unsound Tenants and Opinions, which is not to be imputed to
the governing part of the Army, to the Court or Council of Parliament, neither
is a present ^ure forthwith to be applied in all parts and places where they
are vented; The Army and their party have enough to do to prevent and provide
against the Power and Policy of their Enemies without an overhasty endeavoring
to suppress the Schisms and Errors of every one of their Adhere^ts.

The Complaint against Heresy and Schisms abounding is just, seasonable, and
most sit that the Herefies should be suppressed both to settle the Discipline
and Government of a Reformed Church as to remove and take away all occasion of
scandal and quarrellings between us and other Nations, but how and when? Every
thing to be done in its order and appointed time; The complaint was long since
made, and it was foretold of old, That Heresies must be, the Apostle gives the
reason, That the sound and approved Truth may be known and differenced from
fond and received Heresy, the ground and seminary of broaching them may be
(besides the common and inbred corruption of Pride and Falsehood which mankind
is prone unto) that so many sorts of men in many places do despise and speak
against the Scriptures although they be the infallible rule of our Christian
Faith.

In disordered and licentious times caused through the distractions of a civil
War, it may fall out as a St. Jerome.
Father of the Church complained it did in his, of Scripture Teachers, of
expounders of the Mysteries in Divinity cited by a learned Divine upon the
words of the Apostle charging the unlearned and unstable for wresting the
Scriptures to their own destruction; whose presumption (the Divine tells us) is
enough to produce any Schism or Heresy, Sola says he Scripturarum ars est
quam sibi omnes passim vendicant, hanc garrula Anus hanc ^elirus Senex hanc
Sophista verbosus (he might have filled up the measure of his complaint by
discovering many other sorts of unlearned people intruding into the holy
mystery of Divinity) hanc universi presumunt lacerant docent antequam discunt;
every one presuming upon his parts and gifts to be a teacher and interpreter of
Scripture whereas Practitioners in other arts can keep themselves within the
the bounds of their own profession; the times are now for Reforming and the
Parliament is sedulous therein wherefore there must be persons to Inform and
instruct qualified with Knowledge for that Office: The Divine gives the reason
why the unlearned are so bold, namely the want of abilities to discern the
strength of the Objections which may be made against them: By the unlearned is
not meant he who has not read a multitude of Au^hors but he who taking upon
him to divide the word of God is raw and unexperienced, or if he has
experience wants judgment, to make use of it; the anguish that these rash
presumers bring unto the discreeter sort of Brethren cannot but be great when
being convinced of their unsound O^inions for the maintaining that which with
much boldness and open falsehoods they have averred they pretend the Authority
of the Word, and whatsoever conceit is begotten in their heads, the Spirit of
God to be presently the Author of it, when as learned and judicious men, in
whom the Lord has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all
manner of work for the service of the Sanctuary like Bezaleel and Aholiab
refuse much of the stuff which is offered them. Scripture is given to all to
learn, to teach to interpret only to a few: It is the voice of God confessed
by all that the sense is Scripture not the words, it cannot be therefore
avoided but that he that wilfully strives to fasten some sense of his own
other then the nature of the place will bear must needs take upon him the
person of God himself, and to be an indicter of Scripture: No Scripture is of
private interpretation, There can be but two certain and infallible
Interpreters of it, either it self or the holy Ghost the Author of it, it
self does then expound it

most part exempted them from any Charge or Tax for raising money toward this
War, by giving way unto and placing painful and sober Governors in the

War was likely to demolish and destroy, is yet recoverable by the care and
industry of their Governors, that whereas there is a Disproportion and
Antipathy between Science (a soft, mild and tender habit) and a War (a
privative and destroying judgment) there is yet by Gods blessing left a
possibility and means of a regresse from a War (and Garrison of Soldiers in
Oxford.

Parliament for ought we see neglect or disesteem the Universities or other
Seminaries of Learning, or take away the Endowments of Colledge^ (as their
Enemies give out) in that some of the most learned of the Scholars there are
dispossessed of part of their Estates for their disaffection, or because that
able men of the Universities and elsewhere are sequestered for a time by reason
of their constant prejudice and ill will against the Parliament and their
Proceedings, the Parliament knowing such to be Interested and not long since
seasoned by the Enemy, (Garrisoning in one of the Universities) and devising
yet to contrive their overthrow to let in the King's Power again: They could
not be ignorant of the discontent and envy borne toward Them by diverse of the
more ripe and learned of the Clergy to see the Church Preferments and Dignities
which they aimed at to be taken away, how apt withal to engage the younger
sort of Scholars in this their Cause by seasoning them with the same leaven of
Discontent, without consid^ring that what was bestowed and instituted at first
by Pious See the like observed in the Consecration of the Bishops of England,
written by Mr. Mason sometimes Fellow of Merton College in Oxford in his
Ep^stle to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Founders for the encouragement of Learning, study and good uses many of them
did betray to Luxury and Ease, which the Parliament not knowing how otherwise
to correct or moderate, and foreseeing such Corruption to be so incorporate
into their Prelaticall and Ca^hedrall Calling that amidst these oppositions and
distractions threatening the ruin of Three Kingdoms occasioned chiefly by
reason of a corrupt and Prelaticall Clergy (as the Sea their Remonstrances
since the beginning of this War.
Estates of 2 of the said Kingdoms have observed) They knew no other remedy to
be applied then to alienate those Endowments, to dispose of them to other uses.

The work of Reformation being in hand, and Preaching the Gospel the
isntrumental means thereof, no man will judge such an emulation or ill will to
be in a prudent Laity intending to Reform toward a learned Clergy the means of
Reforming, that the one should discountenance or bring down the other, the
Clergy such as the Apostle would have them be, Blameless, (...) have See their
Remonstrance before cited.
Remonstrated and Protested for the contrary. Rather the Kings Party with the
Presbyterians, most adhering unto him now, seem to give way to many practices
tending to Irreligion, although not directly and immediately unless by those of
the Popish Faction, yet remotely and consequently whilst they so earnestly
contend against the opposite Party called Independents that they would rather
submit unto a Turk or Jew then to be mastered by that Party; for the
Presbyterians weakening them and themselves also by striving each with other,
help the Enemy into a Power to subvert that which some of the Kings Party have
heretofore aimed at, and has been the first object of this Quarrel, Religion.

The Emulation and Discontent of which Parties (the Kings and those of
Presbyterian) grows out of a fear to be overcome, (Adversaries convinced are
prone to Revenge and Envy) and that appears from the judgment and censure the
Kings Party have passed against the Parliaments, in the punishment had the
Kings prevailed they would have condemned them to, for of the moderate sort of
the Parliament and their Friends they hold them unskillfull, See the
Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled at Oxford etc. printed there

term) it and their Multitudes, the more eminent and active sort Traitors,
Perjured All, yea the Neutralls too for not offering to defend the King
according to the Oath of Allegiance, the Parliament Party having a more
moderate and mild judgment of the King's, knowing many of them restless and
implacable as yet, judging others mistaken only, misapprehending the Cause in
hand or to have been led away through ambition and aspiring thoughts to adhere
unto the King, whereupon they have accordingly passed by the Errors and
Transgressions of the Kings by an easy mulcting them giving way unto their
enjoying their Estates and Fortunes, so that if the judgment at the first had
been no worse, no more rashly and erroneously passed against the one then it
was against the other Party, the War had soon been ended and a Peace restored.

By the Kings Parties large exten^ion of which Oath in not offering to defend

That the Parliaments party did begin the Preparations for a War before the
Kings. The People it is true were discontented and greived at the Exactions and
Oppressions practiced in the time of his Reign, they held themselves destitute
of any means of redress, and therefore might harbor Heart burnings, and
thoughts of Rising but could not devise or think of any course toward the
Preparations for a War, the Power of the County being in every Sheriff of the

the strength of any Power to levy War on their behalf, a Parliaments strength
they sadly and long since observed was of too frail and uncertain a fabric for
them to trust unto, as being awed and dissolved at pleasure, so that if they
had no thoughts of levying a War wanting the opportunities and means of
Prevailing if they had entertained such thoughts, the first offering of Hostile
attempts and acts will lie upon the Kings Parties account; his averseness to
call Parliaments, his awing and dissolving them when called, often and long
before any preparations could be thought of for a War may satisfy the
Objection: when as (to add to the probability of some of his parties hostile
and warlike preparations) it has been observed that some of his Friends
knowing themselves obnoxious and questionable for their Tenants and Demeanours
when time should serve, have long since before this Parliament was called,
fortified and furnished their Houses in diverse parts of the Klngdome with Arms
and Ammuni^ion, no other notice taken til of late then of adorning them for
strength and splendor, which with some small addition became strong Garrisons
for him; the Parliaments Friends had none or not so many Holds so soon or
suddenly to be fortified for their defense: The most wise and happy of Hen. the

Kings could tell us by his own practiced Policy That it is not the first Blow

first Preparations toward a War.

Injuriously charged on the King in that the Author and Reader also if a friend
to Him and would have the Book reputed his, do unawares and as it were against
their Will wound his honor, and render the manner of his death the more
unchristian then otherwise it might be judged, when whilst the life is mortal,
they make the Vices of Dissembling and Uncharitableness to be surviving and
immortal mo^ions: The reporting it to be the Kings seems besides to blemish
the credit of those penitential expressions therein, derogating from the
serious retired and solid Parts wherewith he was endowed, then doubtless free
from the affectated words whereof the Book is full in defense of the manisold
actions of his incident to this War, many of them too weakly excused to be his

on him by indeed the Author of the Book, (...) of Divine and wholesome Council

suspected to the contrary [That the Fathers heart was seasoned with the like
Principles according to the Council given unto the Son;] and as to the time

only and a long time more then those of the growth of Anarchy easy to be let
in amongst other disturbances and distractions through the licentiousness and
confusedness of a civil War, and wherefore is that Council given? as if the
Parliament did intend or had brought in Anarchy or devised to root out all
Government; No calumny whereby to render them and their proceedings odious and
detestable, is of extent enough to serve and satiate their Enemies appetite:
The Parliament in their prudence and experience might discern a reason for the
changing the Monarchical into some other form of as much conducement to the
maintenance of Peace and Justice: But The speedy and effectu-suppressing Errors
and Schisms is charged on him.
what that Religion is which the Author enjoynes the Prince unto whether
opposite to Popery or Schism (this like weeds in Corn choking and hindering
its growth, that like Mildews blasting and destroying it) he defining not makes
it seem do^btfull to the Reader, for presently after he would have the Prince
his Judgment and reason to seal to that Sacred Bond which education has
written in him; let a computation be had of his young years how in his infancy
incapable of discerning the differences of Religion before this War began,
where and with whom he has lived these eight or nine years since it began, all
men will not believe that to be the Reformed Protestant Religion which is there
enjoined him (take it in its purity or as the corruption of times has
fashioned it) the Prince is vehemently suspected to go in a contrary Diameter
to either as to those Instructions given him by the Author, by what is reported
of his having favored and entertained at his Court the greatest and most known
Papists, Forraigners of all parts, setting aside his Protestant and Native
English: And howbeit he seems now for a time to comply with the Protestants and
other of the Scottish Nation and they reciprocally with him, his constant and
certain aid is yet kept up, his interest maintained by the Kings Catholic
Subjects in Ireland, as they term themselves in favor to the Prince, so that
what at the beginning of these Wars was acutely urged as a witty and
plausible fallacy of the Papists taking up Arms for the Protestant Cause is at
this day marveled at, the name changed, only as that the Papists in Ireland
take Arms to defend a Protestant Prince in Scotland: All which considered the
Prince cannot be thought to take those instructions to be truly and genuinely
the Kings or little observes them as the Kings.

That which should have been expunged out of the Book to make it the more
admired his is that one passage (strange amongst the rest) about the Authors
challenging the Parliament for discovering the Letters taken at Naseby Fight
even now mentioned, unless it were ill taken by the Author in the Kings
behalf that the naming his friends assembled at Oxford in the nature of a
Parliament [ his Mungrell Parliament] as himself styled it, should be
disclosed together (...) and Liberties of a Freeborn people or presumptuously
shall take part with the subverters of the same, although in a small degree of
Oppression and E^action (the Laws having their Metes and Limits to bound out

beforementioned.
Prince no better than Pests, Vipers and Traitors to a Kingdom, whence it
might be mervailed at, but that the Parliament has with Clemency passed by the
Transgressions of their mistaken Countrymen and fellow Subjects without any
heavier censure then Fining them, that the violating the ancient Law of Magna
Charta so industriously and religiously preserved by their Ancestors, and above
thirty several times confirmed in Parliament (to use the very words of the
Lords and Commons assembled at Oxford in their See the Oxford Declaration page
19.
Declaration printed there) should be objected against the Parliament sitting
at Westminster, to be a bold and avowed transgression of the Laws and Liberties
of the People, as if the parties of those Lords and Commons were altogether
free from the like transgressions; so they may in like manner object a
violating the late Kings Grant to the Petition of Right, when they and their
party are (setting aside the justice of the ^ause on either side) as culpable
as the Parliaments party are. The pillaging the Earl of Stamfor^'s house in
Leicestershire by the Kings Party commanding there an undoubted and notorious
Felony by the Letter of the Law, all his Soldiers guilty of the same: The
storming by day and night the breaking into the Marquess of Winchester his
house in Hantshire by the Parliaments Party the highest degree of Burglary:
many the like Hostile Acts may be instanced in on either side, but how? in the
heat of War in the pursuit of Conquest, each party striving who should overcome
and destroy their Enemy.

One other passage in the (...) as unjustly and improbably delivered is
considerable ( viz.) the plausible reasons In the treatise concerning the Kings
going to the House of Commons to surprise the five Members.
given of the Kings going to the House of Commons with so many armed Gentlemen,
which as the Author says was no unwonted thing for the Majesty of a King to be
so attended especially in discontented times. The times were not then so
discontented as that unheard of and horrid act might have made them at that
time, had but the hand of one desperate Caitiffe given fire to his Pistols
ready cockt, the House of Commons being near full and equal in number to the
Forces prepared against them, no man knows how disastrous and fatal the Event
had been: Neither could the King justly fear to be assaulted by any in the
House as the Author intimates, None in the House within being armed answerable
to the Kings Guard without: The Author thinks he has handsomely palliated that
Attempt under color of the Kings standing in need of a Guard, rendering those
His Attendants there short of his ordinary Guard, but whether he meant short in
number or in a daring and forcible array he declares not. Many other Passages
as improbable as these are the Discourses of the Book too tedious to recite,
the examining and search whereof is besides this purpose: It seems to have
little of the King, it has elegancy of wit enough and affectation of
expressions to be applauded inconsistent with a sound and Christian wisdom
whereunto his present condition was to be fitted, and Charity enjoins not to
think it his, when full of so ma- (...) every three years presumes an
expiration of that Parliament which enacted it, and the King binding himself
not to dissolve this without their own consent implies a consummation of such
matters and Acts as were to be handled and dispatched within the time before
the Trienniall was to commence (which could not well be done by reason of the
Oppositions and Affronts offered to blast their meetings and retard their
Counsels) otherwise a Trienniall Parliament would have began before the
present Parliament should end: Besides every future Parliament could not but
expect an over-awing Power to shake and dissolve it at pleasure, wherefore the
care and task of this could be no less then to make sure and valid Their
power and station, which if it be or had been borne down what security could
be had in the power and stability of Trienniall or future Parliaments.

The Kings forbidding Papists to fight in his Quarrel, is in that his answer
to the Lords and Commons well expressed, and might give seeming satisfaction to
the Protestant Party had it been as well observed, for if that be true which is
credibly reported, of the soul and unheard of misdemeanour to the affront and
scorn of the Protestant Religion committed by his party (part of the Northern
forces and styling themselves the Queens Army) at the storming a Marlboroug^*
December. 1642.
Garrison Town in Wiltshire, with many other Acts of his and his party in
countenancing Papists charged on him by his people, was no good evidence of his
inclinations to the Protestant: And how by his Catholic Subjects, as they are
ambitious to style themselves in Ireland, and desirous they may be so Recorded,
and by the Queens party and Army here, shall his disavowing Papists be made
good? her Opinions and Demeanor destructive to Protestantis^^^e, together with
the aid of an obnoxious and discontented party here at home to affront the
Parliament and their proceedings in favor to the King when time should serve,
being no good Arguments to prove his constancy or sincerity really to perform
what he promised and professed: the Scots having a previous sense gave the
English notice hereof to entreat them to be wary etc. least if they were not
careful and courageous they might be over reached as in the beginning of this
discourse is set forth at large, which the Parliament revolving and from their
own Observation and Experience tender also of the great Trust which the people
had reposed in Them, were not willing to put it to the hazard whether the King
would make good his promises, which if he did not, the sad return which They
must have made to the People of their Trust had been They could not have
thought it would have so fallen out: personal promises and tenders of grace
are not compensatory nor an adequate discharge from real injuries: Which
promises when again objected, the season of offering them may be retorted as
an answer to the Objection as when they were promised ( viz.) when he saw his
Prerogative Acts scanned and enquired into swelling above the bounds of Law and
Justice, when diverse of his friends and favorites questioned and even
convicted of high and Capital enormities, and that he could not otherwise
rescue them from the hands of Justice then by engratiating himself with the
people by telling them of such Laws made for their ease and benefit until he
had gained (...) then their fellow Subjects did or could have discovered any
dark or secret contrivances of such intendment or conspiracy against his
person deeming all others of a narrow capacity ignorant and dull spirited, they
were too blame to conceal the plot, the manner and means of effecting it; they
had opportunity encouragement and liberty enough, when his Party were with him
at Oxford, and then and there accused the Parliament sitting at Westminster of
many Treasonable designs, when (the quality of the persons accusing being
considered the heinousness of the crimes wherewith the accused were charged)
the accusers would leave no means unattempted to enhance their power, to make
good their accusation for the Justice sake of their own proceedings: which
heavy charges devised by them could not be the Judgment of them all, to censure
those of Westminster Trayteurs etc. It was most likely to be the pride of some
few thirsting to overcome, and taking upon them to be dictatours of Law and
Treason, who it is probable forced and drew on the rest (present then and
unawares of what sad consequences might follow) to partake of their own Crimes
and Errors: So then the case is briefly thus, The Kings party have in their
Declarations charged the Parliament and their party of High Treason, which
party of the Kings to make good their charge have striven and done their utmost
to improve their own to consume the Parliaments strength, as by inviting both
Foreigners and Natives to come to their assistance, yea See the Oxford
Declaration page 26. 27.
Neutrals too, under pain of Allegiance forfeiting and breach of Oath: The
Parliament have on the other side to defend themselves and friends from such
guilt the Neutrals also from the censure of Allegiance forfeiting as much
contended to abate and take away the Kings parties strength: so both party
coming as it were to join issue in the trial, there is likely to be no
further dispute concerning it then what the sword shall determine.

The next Treason wherewith the Parliament stands charged is the making a new
Great Seal counterfeiting the Kings; the Reader may observe the justness of
such charge, the Great Seal an Instrument of State See the same Declaration
page 11.
whereby Justice is derived and distributed to the people, as the Kings party
at Oxford have confessed, being surreptitiously and vafrously taken away from
the Parliament the Representative body of the People, contrary to the trust
reposed in the Keeper of the same, the making a new one cannot be rightly
judged Counterfeiting within the meaning of the 25 Edw. 3
Statute: Counterfeiting is a close and cover act against the knowledge and
privity of a superior and lawful power damnified by such counterfeiting; nor
is every thing which is made to the mould by which it is made a simply
counterfeiting. The quality of the offense is discerned in the manner of the
offending and the making a Law commonly relates to some precedent crime or
fraud; Now no man will believe that it is any where to be found upon Record
whereon to ground a Law, that a King and Parliament have at any time made use
of a Great Seal to cross or thwart each others actings. Many other
accusations of this kind are charged on them as disturbers of the Peace,
Authors and Fomentors of this they call Rebellion: wherefore lest these
several charges heretofore denounced against them should by the Enemy's
recovering his power again be hereafter made good (...) obedience to Their
power, They require no more then what the Apostle enjoins, Let every Soul be
subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; the Powers that
be are ordained of him, and whereas they have enacted and declared that all men
in Offices of trust and qualified shall promise to be true and faithful to
this Commonwealth wherein they live, and from whence they hold and enjoy their
welfare, requiring afterward a Subscription and Engagement of Fealty unto the
Commonwealth as it is now established without a King or House of Lords, the
peoples subscription thereunto is no more, if small matters may hold
resemblance with greater, then Tenants of a Manor unto a Lord thereof, unto
whom without disputing the Right and Title they promise their present Fealty:
If the Lord unto whom they have heretofore done Homage be disse^sed by a
stronger then himself, take it either of Right or Power, the Tenants are to pay
their Homage to the Lord that is. It is not to the Power already past or that
which is to come but to the powers that be, unto which Subjection is to be
rendered. The name as the Office of a King has been an ancient continued and
supreme Title before and since the Conquest, his single person subject yet to
Passion Error Faylings, through which he may more expose his Kingdoms unto
dangers then a Council of Parliament can well be thought to do: A Parliament
has been a discontinued and intermitted Court howbeit of Sir Edward Cook his
Collections concerning the Authority of the Parliament in the fourth Book of
his Institut.
Supreme Authority and Honor, within the power of any wicked or impious King,
if any should happen to reign, to be held on or dissolved at pleasure, until
by a Law Enacted by the late King's consent, This was not to be dissolved
unless they pleased: Wherefore the People leaning rather on the one (the King)
being of a settled Being, and who could Reward or Punish at his Will: then on
the other (the Parliament) of a more unstable Being, and heretofore Dissoluble
at the pleasure of a Prince, the Parliament judged it fittest to take away his
Power and Office, lest by virtue of such Power he might Dissolve, Convene at
pleasure, and so Awe their next Convention, as to Repeal and make Null the
Laws and Acts of this. The Inconveniences may be many discovered by their
prudence which the state of Commonwealths in a Monarchy may be subject unto,
when Princes in their Usurpingly Absolute and Monarchical estate, abusing
their Power Trust and Liberty, have become Tyrants over the Lives and Liberties
of the People, ass^ming moreover so much unto themseves or having been
flattered by their Creatures to believe, That they are Gods on Earth, as some
of the Roman Emperors did arrogate unto themselves, That their Power is so
vast, so Sovereign that the People were ordained for their behoof to do and
pay Obedience in whatsoever they shall Command, not the King for the Quanquam

Peoples good, That Kings were accountable to none but God for whatsoever they
do, as of late 'twas threatened, That the Kingdom has its Power and Being
from the King, when as a grave The Author of the Peoples Plea,
Divine by his Reading, proves

That the King has his Power from his Kingdom, therefore his Authority,
further illustrating upon the point, That howbeit [ Power and Authority] be
terms sometimes confounded, if distinguished makes clear the matter, for
Authority is a Right and Lawfulness to command Obedience, such as all
Governors and Magistrates have more or less; But Power is a lawful ability
to force Obedience, where upon command it is denied: One may have a just and
lawful right to command that wants a compulsive power to restrain from
committing sins, as to enforce men's duties, Others may have strength to force
(commonly called Power) that wants Authority to command; and Power is that
which in all Government bears the sway: Wherefore in the Scripture Romans 13. it
is taken concretively for the Governors and Magistrates themselves, which have
Powerat Command to force Obedience to their Commands.

Now there is no doubt but the King has full power to command according unto
Law all such as are subject to him by Law; But if upon command obedience be
denied, whence has he lawful power to enforce obedience? whence has he power
to make good his Authority but from the people? he cannot have it from himsele
being but one man; To keep a strong guard of some of his people to impugn and
force the rest, must needs produce Commotions, Insurrections, and a civil War;
the Aristotle.
Philosopher and others who write of Policy, will tell you it is Tyranny, nor
is such ability Potestas but Vis, Violence not Power because unlawful: when
Vis and Potestas or Vis and Jus do clash and skirmish, the consequence is
dangerous: To keep an Army on foot continually under other pretenses thereby to
affright and force the Subjects is little better, therefore the Kings Power
must needs come from his own Peoples hands and strength, and from the same
People must come his Authority: If any other should give him Authority which
were not able to make it good by Power, it were given him in vain, nor were the
People bound to make that good which themselves gave not; whence he has his
power then, from thence he must needs receive his Authority, even from the
Kingdom.

Notwithstanding which, admit what the Kings party would have, That the
Kingdom has its Power or Being from the King, that Kings as Nursing-Fathers
are worthy of much honor, yet where they lay waste their Sovereignty by
oppressing their People, by exercising a Tyrannical Power over their Estates
and Lives, where they embroyle their Kingdoms in such a War, as the
doubtfulnesse of the success has protracted it for many years, the continuing
it has consumed the Estates and appalled the hearts of most of his people (no
man knowing yet the worst and end thereof) they cannot expect Power, Being, and
Welfare from such a King: The danger of the continuing thereof consists in this,
That howbeit there have been heretofore Civil Wars betwixt the King and
Subjects of this Nation, none like to this, consider it either in the manner
for the beginning and continuance of it, for the opposite and cross
Engagements even beween the nearest Friends, between Brethren of the same
Blood, between the Father and the Son, between Equals in all Degrees and
Faculties; Amongst some really and with vehemence pursued, amongst others
(though opposite in judgment and opinion) yet so linckt in relative affection
each to other, that their Actings and Contendings seem rather a mutual
agreement with their Friends of the opposite part to serve each others turn,
then a true and real Discord, to the end that which of the parties shall
prevail, the Prevailer by such mutual contract shall be able to help the
Conquered: And that which seems strange in the Quarrel, the most unhappy to
the protracting it, is the Violence and Heat in many of the Opposites shown in
their contrary arguings and assertions one to the other, as that the taking up
of Arms in the defense of the Laws and Liberties was judged by the one side to
be Lawful and Necessary, condemned on the other to be Traiterous and
Rebellious, the same act could not be Lawful and Traiterous too; the
Difference only is as a long time it has been, concerning the several
objects and matters in dispute, as how Peace has been forfeited, how lost, now
on what terms, and by what means to regain and secure it when regained: The
Kings party say (the more moderate from a reluctance of heart, and
unwillingness to be Conquered, others of a fiercer spirit to be Avenged on
their Adversaries) the surest and next way to Peace is in the Prince his
enjoying what his Father had, faintly believing, that he will be avenged only
on those who were the Authors and Contrivers of his Fathers death, that he will
pass by with a general Act of Oblivion, all other of the People by a light
Fining, or putting them to Compound for their Estates. The Parliament having in
their wisdom and experience discerned and foreseen the danger which the Common
wealth They and Their Friends are thereby subject to, are of a contrary mind
to what the Kings party do give out, They do foresee (and know that it
concerns them to provide against) that the Prince will not only rest there to
be avenged for his Fathers death, he will remember his own being kept out, and
as it were exiled from out the Kingdom whereunto he aspires, and has engaged
so many against this. The Scots in maintenance of the Kings Party's judgment
contend to aid his Son the Prince, but whether for tho Covenant as their
Motto's do profess, or against through a misunderstanding it, or through
wilful blindness, their Actions do declare and are here expressed: They give
out that they have brought the Prince to repentance for his Fa^hers sins and
for the sins of his Family, but that their Prince does threaten not many
months before, requiring aid to be avenged for his Fathers death, and yet to
repent and to be humbled for his Fathers sins seems inconsistent: But do
they mean the Prince in his Person only or his Party? they should withal have
brought to repentance all the King his Fathers party, else their Covenanting to
prevent and oppose seems to be of little use, the meaning of [ preventing and
opposing] carries with it a further progress of motion, then to intend only
the person of the King then living; the Repentance which they speak of, if it
should prove feigned and dissembled [ the Heart is desperately evil, who can
know it?] and thereby the safety of many thousands engaged in this Quarrel
swallowed up, the too late (...) his Parties construction, as to offend:
Whosoever shall look on in a conflict betwixt two opposite Parties, his
affections questionless incline (whatsoever his Actions are) more to the one
party then to the other: So Neutrals such as have not acted for the King, being
already by his Party adjudged Guilty, are subject to the censure, and may be
brought in within the compass of the Prince his meaning, for if upon the late
King his Parties good success in some victories obtained when they kept
Garrison at Oxford they in the high tide of triumph construing their fellow
Subjects demeanor in relation to the King, spared not to bring in all
Neutralls, if the Prince shall come in Conqueror, what shall be judged and who
reputed Principalls, who Accessaries (which is all one if it were Treason) to
his fathers death? when as the Charge of taking away his life Forraigners and
strangers beyond Sea reckon to be a National and the Peoples Act, because the
Parliament is the Representative of the people; for they not knowing the reason
and exigency of matters here, account it not an Act only of the Judges,
Advocates, and Officers deputed for his Trial, but include the whole English
driven on first by the Scottish Nation, the English more manifestly in that
diverse of their Friends and Agents being employed beyond Sea for making good
the Amity and correspondence betwixt Them and other States and Nations, have
been barbarously and inhumanely murdered by the enemies party, several
affronts and indignities offered them, all to disgrace, lessen, and discourage
the Parliament and their Actings: So that it concerns both Nations (the
English and the Scots) rightly to apprehend, and rather to have continued in
their mutual League then be led away (as the Scots have manifested themselves
to be) by the power and ambition of the greater ones, to engage one against the
other: The English have sufficiently expressed their averseness from a War
with the Scots, their readynesse to afford them aid in their greatest wants,
and cannot now be thought forward, unless provoked to invade their Country, or
if they do to be gayners by it, what the Scots may by invading This, all men
know who know the condition of Theirs and Ours, how sterile the one, how
fruitful the other Country is; the setting Us and Them at variance, the
differences and dissentions between Us now, flow frow one common Source, to wit
the Enemy his wiles and subtilty, who wants no stratagem to bring this contest
betwixt him and Us into a fresh debate, both by secret and covert acts at home
to promote sedition and division amongst those whom he would overcome, as by
open Acts and solicitings abroad to pursue his attempting to bring in any
foreign force, how wild or barbarous soever they be, how hard to get them out
again out of this plentiful Nation, yielding them all provisions all
habiliments of War to strengthen themselves in this, as to provide for their
next attempt elsewhere after they have destroyed and harrased this, not knowing
how to distinguish between Presbyterian, Independent, and Royal Party, and
this to be driven on by him and his accomplices (in an hazardous and uncertain
way) out of revenge and thirst to regaine unto himself his power again, long
since forfeited through his mistaken loyalty, certainly through disaffection
to his native Brethren of the same Nation, or without considering (which wise
men should) (...) the price of peace which cannot be had without a War, Money
being the sinews and support thereof; the Countryman grudgeth not to pay for
seed expecting a plentiful harvest, nor the Tenant to contract with his
Landlord to disburse great sums for an estate in Reversion for his posterity,
yet the laying out money by either of them, for that without which the
Countrymans harvest nor the Tenants Estate can fall out joyously, is irksome to
them both.

The frequent exception which the People make by way of comparison between the
payment of Ship Money in the late Kings time, and the Impositions and Taxes now
required, comes fitly to be answered: Better (say they) that the payment of
Ship Money should have continued and the like illegal Taxes demanded beyond
and above the power of Law, easier to be born then so much Blood spilt, then
such vast sums of money spent in the maintenance of this War, and the People
thereby impoverished: The Parliament confesses and allows as much, that of two
Evils the lesser is to be chosen, where of necess^y one must happen, as in case
of inevitable necessity that Wisdom and Industry cannot prevent: if otherwise,
Necessitas non excusat quae potuit esse non necessitas, as a learned Tertullian.
Writer of the Church acutely argues; when that a King his Treasure or Revenue
suffices not for the Common good, as when the Realm is invaded, or any notable
Rebellion of the Subjects shall happen, such an Invasion or Rebellion as is not
procurata, not simulata, but verae gravis manens, the King then by the common
opinion of the CIVILIANS may impose new Taxes in requiring aid, although out of
a Parliamentary and common way.

The Answer to this Exception is made good resembling it to one of the same
kind; it were better that a man should receive a wound from a stronger then
himself, and afterward be assaulted and affronted a second or third time, yea
even until he be maimed; then, although in his own defense be killed (for so
it may happen upon his resistance-making) It had bin better for him to have
endured those and many more affronts and wounds as the lesser Evil of the Two,
then by striving and repulsing them to lose his life, But where the one might
have been avoided, no necessity of the other to have happened, the Exception
seems invalid: Again if a man having an estate in Fee, in Land or otherwise,
free from any Charges, Taxes, Tallages, Annuities or the like, and a firm and
undoubted Title to the same, rather then he will suffer a rentcharge although
of a smaller value to be unjustly and wrongfully paid out of it through the
oppression of an Adversary stronger then himself, demanding such a rent, will
do his best to defend, yea peradventure at a greater expense of money then the
rentcharge may amount unto: Nor is his failing to maintain his Title an
impeachment to the credit of it, no more then it is an advantage to his
Adversaries right being of ability to oppress his Tenant weaker then himself;
There was no necessity of levying Shipmoney when it was required, first from
the Maritime places and Countries, which when they did submit unto, was
generally paid throughout the whole Land, and for diverse years continued, and
wherefore when the English had Commerce, Trade, and Correspondency with all
other Nations without Interruption or Hostility? Wherefore the (...) for
standing out longest against his and his Fathers power, the Presbyterian next
for his opposing and contending with it at first, the Neutral for his double
minded and ambidextrous carriage, and upon an inquiry had who have subscribed
the late Engagement which the greater and more considerable part of the whole
Nation have, to punish the Subscribers or put them all to their suit for
Pardons: At what rate? That the price of purchasing shall both gratify his
friends Foreign and Domestic and defray the charges of the War, that not
all, but seize and become Lord of the peoples Estates and Lives by way of
policy and prudence to keep and prevent them from committing the like Rebellion
as it is ^armed, that they may not have wherewithal hereafter to leavy a War
for the maintenance of Treasons, that the same may not be said of them as the
Kings party in their indignation said at the beginning of this War of the
City of London [Their wealth was the occasion of this War by consequence of the
ruin of this Nation.] Lastly this may be seen in the sum of all, that if the
prevailing party in any division shall divide according to their varying
judgments, then subdivide, after subdivide again, there will be no end of such
dividings, until their number and their friends be reduced into few or none,
and shattered in pieces as their Enemies would have it, even as dust before the
Wind; for instance sake, the Kingdom did at first divide into a Party for the
King, another for the Parliament, the Parliaments Party upon their Conquest did
divide into two sorts, the one called Presbyterians, the other Independents,
the Presbyterians if they shall prevail may divide into a Scottish rigid
Presbyterian and an English Presbyterian of a milder Test, and to be new molded
to the Conquerours fashion: If the Independent shall prevail they may rend into
new Sects and Divisions, and the prevailing Party in such Sects may divide
again, so there will be no end of Dividing till all be scattered and lost.

The Emulations, Part-takings, and Dissentions now on foot and spreading far,
give to the Enemy's indefatigable and restless malice new hopes of recovering
his Power again, that through these conflicts the deciding this Quarrel may
come again to be debated and the Cards new shuffled, be taking advantage of the
Presbyterian's ^iscontent and making use of his Power mingleth Interests' is to
be seared, as the State and Kirk of Scotland have likewise done to promote the
design in hand, joining with him in this particular against subscribing the
Engagement, where the Kings Party may seem to have the better color to
Quarrel with the Subscription because that thereby the Kingly Power and Office
are excluded, their task is therefore to Dissuade, to Argue against Subscribing
(whether they do subscribe or no themselves) on purpose to keep in the Fuel
of Emulation and Contention in these distracted times, yet it is to be believed
that many of themselves subscribe, whether against their Will and to avoid the
penalty of not Subscribing, and so the more active and eminent sort of their
Party may peradventure be privily dispensed with for their Subscribing, in case
they come at any time after to be questioned for it, knowing then how to excuse
themselves by one common Plea of submitting rather unto, then to be undone by
their Enemies and the Kings, But how justly do they plead thus when as the
Parliament judges it in most of them to be an outward only and feigned
conformity to Their present Government, an enforced submission to the
Engagement, and so pass it by without punishing any for refusing? They knowing
withal that the Engagement is so commonly received, so easily swallowed by the
Enemy and his Party, that many of that Party are nothing the worse thought of
by them for refusing, nor many other the better for their taking it, their
affections little known or measured, by either taking or refusing. But why the
Presbyterian so much against Subscribing, in opposition to the Party which he
calls Independents, or in favor to the late King, or to the Prince his Son and
his surviving Party? The Author of the Treatise 26.
(...) in the Kings name remembers and observes the demeanor of them both,
That the Presbyterian did hunt for that which the Independent caught in
hunting, viz. the overthrow of the King in Person or in his Monarchical
Estate, and the Prince in his Messages before recited, remembers how they have
both behaved themselves: The Presbyterians being against Subscribing is not in
respect to the House of Lords, nothing in the Covenant to deter them from
Subscribing as touching the leaving out or holding in the Lords, whom no part
or Article of the Covenant includes or comprehends.

Briefly to understand the Reason of Enjoining, Taking or Refusing it, which is
now become a disputable Theme, the exception against the taking is either in
the manner, the formal reason, the scope and intention of those who enjoined
it or the matter enjoined, as to the first, the reason of enjoining it seems no
other Bond and yet then what the Parliament and their friends did about 8 years
since of entering into a Covenant for the better streng^hening and (...) fi^mly
binding all men together in a Religious and Civil Union, that seeing Dividings
in Opinion and Dissentings in practice are fatal to the Conqueror, Union and
Accord to the Conquered, the Parliament contends to bring all men into one form
of Civil Government to one unanimous judgment, whereby after the Master
Lambards Eirenarch, cap. 2. in his Tract on King Edw. the third his Writ
directed to the high Sheriff: of Kent for the Proclaming Peace, where he speaks
first of U^iting Minds, then of Restraining Hands as a means for the
preservation of the public peace.
Uniting of their Minds, a Restraint of Hands and ceasing from further
Contentions might ensue to the begetting a firm and lasting peace, Opposition
in Affections begets the like in Actings and Endeavourings, especially in a
Civil War where men of eminent and active spirits, zealous for and fond of
their own Opinions an^ bold to vent them, when subdued by Arms and convinced by
Reason shall resolve into Revenge and Fury and become restless in their
attempts even to the hinderance of an ensuing Peace until they and their Party
may gain what they have lost.

The Engagement now enjoined and tendered seems more easy to be observed, more
uniforme then the Covenant, the Sea the (...) upon the Covenant.
Covenanters protesting in one place That they will desend the Kings Person and
Authority in the preservation of the true Religion and Peace of the three
Kingdoms; in other places, That they will really sincerely and constantly,
without respect of persons, endeavor to bring unto condig ne punishment all
such as shall oppose and disturb such Peace, If a King shall swear to govern
according to the Laws of the Land as the late King did, the Oath is no longer
to be understood an Oath then the Laws have being; [To govern] taking it
without an addition is an indefinite and indeterminate act; [To govern
according to the Lawe*] a qualified and limited one in the termination of his
Oath: The termination in the Covenant [for the preservation of the true
Religion Liberties and Peace] is the reason and formality of that and of other
Articles of the Covenant; A Covenant or Promise to preserve the Kings person,
without setting down wherefore or to what end, is a short and indeterminate
promise unless the intent or final Cause of such promise be expressed:
Wherefore if the King as the Lords and Commons have often charged him, be
guilty of the blood spilt in these his Kingdoms, the Covenanters could not,
both defend his Person and Authority, See the Covenant.
and yet bring to public Trial the ^uthors of the effusion of that Blood and
to bring them to that condign punishment as the degree of their offenses
should require or deserve as is elsewhere mentioned.

As to the matter of the Engagement [ to be true and faithful to the
Commonwealth as it is now established without a King or House of Lords] what is
the exception against the subscribing this? The King being dead, and least the
Prince (his Son) or any other of his Family, shall pursue what he has
threatened, the revenge of his Fathers death, the Parliament has thought it
fit, yea necessary, to exclude him as a King from the Supremacy of this
Government, the Competition being betwixt a Monarchical form of Government [a
Government by a King] and a mixed of Aristocraticall and Oligarchicall, or of a
Commonwealth without a King: If the former be admitted viz. a Monarchical the
power of Government then descends unto the Prince (the late Kings Son and
Heir) So the Presbyterian having entered into a Covenant chiefly and
principally for the defense of the Protestant Religion, the Subjects Liberties
seems to waine those parts of the Covenant entered into for defending them, if
now that the Father is taken away they admit the Son treading in his Fathers
steps; unless the making and taking it were in^ended only to inure and
remain in force for the term of one man's life: Wherefore the Powers that be
have good cause to be jealous of such as reject the latter Form, embracing a
Monarchical one, as complyers with the late King and Prince, and weary of
submitting and adhering unto them.

Wherefore the States enjoining the Engagement is no matter of chance, as a
thing which may be required to be done or let alone, of none or a slight
concernment devised or instituted to little or no purpose, when conducing as
far as at the present they judged it might avail to the discovery of men's
affections, it conduces likewise to the settlement of a Peace and Union: for
whilst the minds and judgments are no more unanimous, the contentions in this
War will hardly cease.

The choice of Taking and Refusing should likewise be of a judicious and sober
inquiry, as who does enjoin, and to what purpose it is enjoined, not that
therefore we should so refuse because we have suddenly and rashly resolved so
to do, a fault incident to young wits, hot and fiery spirits, or because we see
learned and eminent men in other kinds of knowledge, able indeed to lead weak
and unstable spirits Captive unto theirs, do refuse, but on good deliberation
and well weighing wherefore the State has required it.

They in their enjoining the Engagement insist not, nor is there cause they
should, so much on the value and efficacy of polite Learning and knowledge,
take it either in Languages Arts or Academick faculties, or ^n the judgment and
discretion of such Men as have read a multiplicity of Authors, or are as M^ses
was, skillful in all the Learning of the Egyptians, as on a sober studied and
well grounded Prudence ballasted with Observation and Experience (all which the
Learned may likewise have) governing and guiding the safest way to a
selfe-preservation and welfare of a Commonwealth.

Besides the Novity, the Unexpectedness of the Engagement now enjoined, other
discontents and heart-burnings are whispered and cherished by the common Enemy
insinuating and seditiously giving out, That the Nobility are unthankefully and
indignely dealt withal as being detruded from their Rights and Privileges of
sitting in the House of Parliament as Peers, to join with the Commons in the
debate and handling the affairs of the Commonwealth, withal that those Lords
who have been active and assistant both in their Estates and Countenance to
promote the good of it during these distractions may think themselves neglected
and ill rewarded if now debard from their ancient and Native Liberty of Voting
in the House: The reason of the Parliaments enjoining of the Peoples
subscribing to this Engagement, rests upon the issue of these Questions,
Whether from Ireland so erroneously misled and malev^lently affected toward
England by a twofold Antipathy both of Nation and Religion and so impetuously
set on by three several parties the Royal Popish and Prelaticall, there be
not an evident approach of peril to England in case the English be not some
way cemented and unt^ed, (as the Engagement now in question aymeth at) and with
a joint vigor to subdue them, and to keep them under when subdued? Whether
through and by reason of these distractions England be not in danger of losing
their ancient Rights and Claims their credit and privilege of Commerce and
Traffic which heretofore they have had with other Nations? Whether Scotland
not remaining in the same condition of Amity and Brotherhood, as in their
League and Covenant with England they at first United in, but rather revolting
from it, it be not necessary to make up that breach by a closer union amongst
our selves and against them, when as it appears, without recounting the
particular actions falling out betwixt the Parliament and Army betwixt diverse
and private Members and Officers of Both, as what this or that particular
person by himself or by the instigation of some few has done contrary and
against the directions or command of his superiors, That the Scots have in the
maine broke with us? For instance sake, in the Article of the large Page 16.
Demand 4.
Treaty betwixt us and them granted and confirmed by the late King; and wherein
(amongst the rest) they having covenanted and Declared against Popery and
Prelacy which the King and his party has countenanced and favored and now
endeavoring to hel^ his Son into his Fathers power that then he may make
good his favor toward Papists and Prelates would excuse themselves and
Quarrel to assign the breach of Covenant to us, but how justly let the Reader
judge: Their insisting on a pretended Loyalty clears them not in the judgment
of any who since the beginning of these troubles have observed their Motions
their Demands and Treaties, neither does their literal leaning on the words in
that Article of the Covenant [ to defend the Kings Person and Authority] excuse
their guilt, the Kings Person and Authority being but one and an half part of
that Article, the sense and drift of it makes it up, which the English
according to the End and Meaning do pursue in the preservation of the true
Protestant Religion, the Liberties and Peace of the three Kingdom etc. Now
that they give out and threaten to come in an hostile manner into England under
their Apologeticall and specious pretense of fighting against the Sectaries
thereof, of repressing Schisms and Heresies when as they have nothing to do
with our Doctrine and Discipline Ecclesiastical or Civil, when as our own
Divines can do better service by their Tongues and Pens for the suppressing
Schisms and Heresies then can be expected from the Scots their Swords and
Arms, which if we may speak by experience are by the continuing this War more
like to increase them both in number and power, then to suppress or lessen
them in either, and for the English Laity none or a very few and inconsiderable
number of them do tolerate Heresies and Sects, as is elsewhere set forth in
this discourse: Moreover when the English have shown their Averseness from a
War with Them, At the defeat given them by Montrosse at Kilsyth eve^ to the
ruining the State of Scotland when the Lord Fairfax the English General and
other Commanders in chief wrote to the Earl of Leven the Scottish General
that they accounted the calamities of Scotland to be their own, and would
willingly adventure their own blood for the Scots as for the English till the
Enemies of the three Kingdoms were fully vanqu^shed. See the Breviary of the
History of the Parliament of England.
their tender and compassionate thoughts toward them when they were at the
lowest ebb, and they expecting the like measure of friendship and Brotherhood
from the Scots according to their motto and profession [ to deal as they would
be dealt with] have assisted them before, and even at the beginning of these
troubles when they suffered most, when by their applying themselves to the King
for redress they could have none, the English was their only aid and best
support. The last Question then falls out, Whether whilst these matters be in
dispute we may rest secure from an Hostile invasion from them or other
Forraigners? whether by these unnecessary disputes and dissentions here at home
the Commonwealth be not in danger to lose that in a short time which has cost
so much Treasure Industry and Blood? For the powers that be, once shaken and
becoming weak will soon fall, most men being apt to lay hold on the Noli in
caducum parietem inclinare* Lipsius Politic.
Politicians advice [ Not to lean on a weak and to^tering Wall] The judgment
and knowledge of deciding these Questions rests in the Prudence and Experience
of the State, who after a long time casting and consulting what was fittest to
be done, what the safest course to be taken for the strengthening and support of
a firm and present Government have resolved upon an universal Engagement in
such manner and form as to their wisdoms seems most expedient, and they have
accordingly Declared and Ordained, that they knowing the justness of their
Cause, ought in relation to the present security and maintenance of their
power, to the preservation of a firm and lasting Peace, to use all Expedient
and Lawful means against the violence and restless opposition of their
Enemies; none they judge so safe as by an Engagement and Subscription
thereunto, which if thoroughly weighed crosses no former Vow either of
Protestation Covenant Oath of Allegiance or Supremacy, the subscriber only
promising to be true and faithful to the Commonwealth as it is now Established
without King or House of Lords; not the Oath of Allegiance or Supremacy as is
before observed if you look into the Reason and End of enjoining the said
Oa^kes; Nor the Pro^estation taken 1641. for the maintenance of the Kings
Honor Person and Estate; Nor the Covenant taken 1643 for the preserving his
just Power and Greatness, where his Honor and Power are transitory and
personal capacities during life, dying with his Person without further respect
had unto his successors: So the taking the Engagement commencing since the time
of the King his death, is no breach either of Covenant or Protestation taken
for him in the time of his life, nor by the words [ Now Established without a
King or House of Lords] are the Nobility excluded for ever from their
Privileges as to succeeding Parliaments if the Wisdom of the State shall so
admit and these continued Divisions beget not an universal ruin taking away
the succession of Parliaments, all Order and Government to be hereafter had,
nor from an Envy or Neglect had by the House of Commons to degrade the Lords or
lay their Honors in the dust as has been of late seditiously given out; for
so the Gentry of which the Parliament themselves consists, being in the next
rank to the Nobility may fear their turn is next to be thrown from their
station also, and al become Levelled, Such suggestions questionless are
infused by the Enemy's Factours into the Gentry's ears to draw away the
affections of them also as well as of the Nobility, to set on those ancient
ranks of men against the Parliament and their proceedings, endeavoring indeed
to turn the hands and hearts of all men against them, but that the Persons and
Estates of such of the Lords as have assisted the Court of Parliament in the
time of their extremities may hence be preserved from ruin, which in case the
Enemy should get the upper hand they must be subject to, and cannot therefore
in their serious and prudent thoughts but confess that Safety and Preservation
are as valuable as Order or Honor is.

Did the Engagement cross the abovenamed Oaths, the Refuser might plead the
tenderness of his Conscience, that having taken those Oaths which to his present
judgment does deter him from subscribing to the Engagement, he cannot without
dispencing with his Conscience so subscribe. The Subscriber from the
tenderness of his observes and builds on the Apostles precepts, Let every
Soul be subject to the higher Powers, again, submit unto every Ordinance of
Man for the Lords sake: he holds withal Gratitude to be a moral act of
Conscience, and therefore thinks he may, nay, that he is bound to promise
fidelity to the Power from whence be receives protection and enjoyes his
safety: so it seems strange that amongst men of the same uprightnes and
integrity many of either party being conscientious and honest men, one Party
should Take, another should Refuse, and that the same guide of Conscience
conversing about the self same object should tend and lead to contrary Ends
and Actions: Conscience is a certain and uniform habit of the mind of man, and
therefore cannot err in a contrary Diameter; as at the first entrance into
this War the Kings Party did pursue their Cause as the Parliament did theirs,
each of them imploring Gods blessing according to the Justness and
Righteousness thereof, which could not be Just on either part when their
undertakings were contrary and cross each to other: It seems as strange that
diverse of either party acknowledging Gods Goodness trusting on his help should
from contrariety of judgments and Courses each to other hope to succeed in that
they expect from him, a blessing upon their endeavourings; he is the same,
knows no change, nor fails them who trust in him: none so wicked but will
confess that he is good and gracious, but for any to expect that through his
blessing through his goodness which they take not the proper course for in
Prudence Sobriety and obedience, or fail in that which he has ordained for
conveying unto us what we look for at his hands, it is rather a tempting then a
trusting on him: Conscience else may be defined a persuasion of the mind that
such or such a thing is sin, that therefore we are unwilling and afraid to
commit the same for fear of displeasing a great and all-seeing Majesty: sin
is a transgression of the moral Law, subscribing is no breach of it, the act
of Subscribing or not subscribing may proceed from a disposition or
indisposition to do or refuse what our will does prompt us unto: Neither is it
so much Conscience in the Taker and Refuser both, in respect of some it is to be
feared a Passion or self wilful humor governed and directed by a carnal and
selfeseeking policy, neither is it a matter of small difficulty to distinguish
between the Natural and Spiritual inclinations of a man: It is not between
Taking and not Taking the Engagement amongst us as between Eating and not
Eating meats amongst the Christian Romans, where as to the Eating and not
Eating the Aposte judges it a matter of indifferency as to them that were so
divided concerning meats and thereupon orders Let not him that eats
despise him that eats not, which he does to take away the occasion of
secondary differences which might grow betwixt them, to preserve the common
Peace, to take away all scandal and division; there was nothing there enjoined
as to the Eating or Abstaining from Eating; It is not so between Submitting and
not Submitting unto Authority as to the Laws and Policies of a Commonwealth,
for whereas submission to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake is required
and here the Powers that be enjoyne the same, Obedience being a conscientious
Duty better then Sacrifice the indifferency seems to cease and is become a
duty; and there the Conscience swayes the balance rather unto that side which
obeyes, then unto that which resists Authority: so the continuation of the
quarrel rests in subjection on the one hand to, in resisting on the other hand
the higher Powers, and the process of this War lies on their score and theirs
alone who when they have erred and are convinced shall not acknowledge and
retract their error, which can be no injury or disrepute to the sober and
lowly minded. The wisest of In sapientem non potest cadere Injuria. Seneca.
Philosophers maintains that no injury can befall a wise man, his stout and
resolved heart keeps off the sto^ms of Calumny when weaker ones do fear and
shrink under every gust of reproach and censure, so that if the convicted
Party shall redeem their error by confessing it, the vanquishing forbear to
glory as some have overhastily boasted in their extraordinary success of a
finite uncertain and vanishing condition See the exhortation for and touching
the taking the Covenant annexed to the Covenant Printed. 9 February, 1643
rather then in the Equity and Justice of their Cause of a more durable and
lasting station, Commonly discoursed in the Diurnalls and Occurrences Printed
in April and May 1651.
Or in the flattering and pleasing our selves with the divisions falling out
amidst our enemies abroad concerning their Counsels and Commands, rather in
studying to compose and reconcile our own at home, the War might soon be
ended, and the God of Peace own us as of the Number of those unto whom he has
promised Psalm. 19.
the Blessing of Peace.
