TERMINO HILLARII, Vicesimo primo Iacobi Regis. 1623.
ACcording to your honors direction, having (since the time of your Lordships
pleasure made known unto us) received from your Lordships, diverse Bills, and
Notes of the Fees claimed by several Officers in the right of their Offices,
in his highness Court of Common pleas at Westminster, and thereby, and by Oath
to be administered unto us, concerning your honors pleasures and intendments
to be performed, whether all the Fees and Sums of money set down and claimed
respectively in the said Bills and Notes, have been paid since the thirtieth
year of the late Queen Elizabeth, or which, or how many thereof, or what
other have been advanced, increased, or taken since the said thirtieth year,
in the said Offices, in the said Court of Common Pleas.

Upon perusal of the said Bills and Notes, and consideration of the Fees now
claimed, and taken upon our several knowledges, and upon credible report, we
find some for to be advanced, increased, raised, and taken since the said
thirtieth year. And therefore in all humbleness, We have briefly set down
under the title of every Office, such as we at this present respectively know
to have been so advanced, increased, raised, and taken with some grounds and
reasons of the advancing, increasing, raising, and taking thereof, delivered by
them, to their several Notes of Fees annexed.

In the Office of Custos Brevium.
THere is, and has been taken by the Clarks there, more than heretofore was
taken and claimed by them upon Fines, upon the return of Writs of Covenant
under color of Deputations from the Sheriffs, and now is claimed by them for
keeping the parts of the Fine. xii. d.

Also for filing every Writ after two Terms, for every Term after, xx. d.
Whereas the said Fee of xx. d. was accepted for filing of any Writ at any time
within the year.

Also there is taken by the said Clerks, for filing of (...) Writs of Entry,
Summons, and Seisin upon common Recoveries, xii. d. whereas ^ormerly iiii. d.
was taken as their Master^ Fee for a post diem.

In the Prothonotaries Office.
THere has been taken for the most part of seven years past, upon every
judgment in personal, and mixed Actions, over and above the ii. s. in the Bill
of their Fees mentioned, and more than was formerly paid, xii. d. being for
assessing of Costs for the Judges as is affirmed.

Also there has been taken by the space of four years last past, or
thereabouts, xviii. d. upon every Writ of Entry, Summons, and Seisin upon
common Recoveries, which was not formerly paid.

There has been also taken by the space of twelve or fourteen years last
past, by them iiii. s. upon the reversall of every Outlawrie, not formerly
taken.

They have also received and taken for diverse years last past, the sum of
ix. s. iiii. d. upon every prohibition granted in Court, but whether the same
be a due, and ancient Fee, we do not certainly know: All which Fees so taken
(as we conceive) are upon the reasons expressed in a Note, which we have
annexed to their Bill of Fees.

The Secondaries of the said Prothonotaries.
THere has been taken by the space of ten years last past, or thereabouts,
xii. d. upon every common Recovery drawn at the Bar, more than formerly has
been taken, which the Secondaries affirm to have been taken in respect the
Demaundants in such Recoveries have not appeared at the Bar in person.

Clarke of the Warrants Office.
THere is taken upon every Fine more than formerly iiii. d. for a Warrant of
Attorney, and charged out of the Attournies Fee by order of the Judges made
14. Iac. Reg. certified by this Officer to his Lordship.

There was also taken by the Deputy of this Officer for the space of three or
four years, and until within one year last past, upon every Fine xviii. d.
which was not formerly paid to that Officer, being so taken (as is pretended)
for the return of the Writ of Covenant, and has since been taken by Master
Thomas Iackman, Clarke of the Inrollments of Fines and Recoveries, upon the
reasons annexed to the Bill of Fees of the Clarke of the Warrants.

In the Phillizers.
THere is taken iiii. d. upon every Cap. and viii. d. upon every appearance of
the Defendant, more then was taken before 14. Iac. Reg. which is taken by
virtue of an Order made upon the reasons expressed in the same Order to their
Bill of Fees annexed.

In the Exigenters Office.
THere has been taken ever since 31. Eliz. upon every Exigent more than was
formerly taken 1. d. which was so taken in respect of the length of the
Proclamation.

And there has been also taken by the space of three years past, i. d. more
upon every Exigent, upon such reasons as are offered to your Lordships
considerations, in their Certificate of Fees.

In the Chirographers Office.
THere is taken by the Clerks of the said Office for writing the Chirograph of
every Fine ii. s. vi. d. which since 30. Eliz. was but xvi. d. which sum of
ii. s. vi. d. upon reasons showed to diverse ancient Attournies by the Clerks
of the said Office about seventeene years since, was assented unto by the said
Attournies, be the Fine long, or short.

In the Office of the Kings silver.
THere is increased, and taken by the space of thirteen years last past, or
thereabouts iiii. d. upon every Fine by Order made in 8. Iac. Reg. annexed to
their Bill of Fees.

Also there has been taken and increased iiii. d. lately, within five years
since the time last above mentioned for every several Cap. of a Fine, having
more Cap. than one, which was not formerly taken.

Also for the time of thirteen years last past, there has been taken for
every Fine by special Commission, iiii. d. which is an increased Fee.

Also there has been taken since 8. Iac. Reg vi. d. for every Fine brought
into the Office after the end of every Term, not formerly taken.

Also there has been taken the sum of viii. d. upon every Fine in the
Western Circuits, more than upon Fines in other Counties, which grew to be
taken about 34. Eliz. by color of deputations from the Sheriffs of the
Western Circuits upon the reasons annexed to his Bill of Fees, most of which
said Fees were raised, and increased in the time when Rich. Chambers, Was that
Officer.

In the Office of the Clarke of the Treasury.
THere is of late taken iiii. s. for the search of every Term after ten
years, the old and ancient Fee being but iii. s. iiii. d.

There is claimed iii. s. for turning the key of the Treasury after the Term,
whereas there is but xii. d. due.

Also there is claimed by his said Bill iiii. d. for search of a Record under
ten years until three years, no such Fee being due.

The Cryers of the Court.
THere is taken by them ii. s. the Fee being but xii. d. for calling every Jury
at the Bar, when they fill not.

Also they take xvi. s. for keeping every Jury during the sitting of the Court,
and xxx. s. for keeping them all night, The ancient Fee for the first (as we
understand) being but iiii. s. and the other viii. s. and no more.

Also there is taken by them for swearing an Attorney in Court ii. s. more
than their ancient Fee, (being iiii. s.) as we are credibly informed.

Also they take upon every Bail taken in Court xii. d. there being no Fee due,
that we know, or have heard of.

Also they take iiii. s. upon every Nisi prius before my Lord chief Justice of
the common Pleas at Westminster, there being no such Fee due to our knowledge.

ii. s. due, as we have heard.

In the Office of the Keeper of the Treasury.
THere is claimed in his Bill for a Search after three years, until ten
years iiii. d. there being no such Fee due.

Also for a Roll carried into the Court, vi. d. there being no such Fee to our
knowledge, other than for carrying a Roll of the precedent Term.

xii. d. due.

Also for a copy of a Precipe xviii. d. there being none ever heard of.

Also for the acknowledging of a Fine iiii. d. there being nothing due.

Also for the key xviii. d. xii. d. being due, and no more.

In the Office of Inrolling, and Exemplifying of Fines and Recoveries.
THe Fees challenged by this Officer (as we conceive) do differ from the Fees
limited by the Sta. 23. Eliz. unto which Stat. we refer our selves.

The Chirographer.
A review of our former Certificate, with an addition thereto, and an answer to
the Articles lately delivered unto us by your Lordships.

THere is taken by the Clarke of the said Office, for writing of the Chirograph
of every Fine, ii. s. vi. d. for which since 30. Eliz. was only paid xii. d.
but about Anno 4. Iac. Reg. they did procure the consent of diverse ancient
Attournies in writing under their hands, for the increase thereof, to make the
xii. d. ii. s. vi. d. be the Chirograph long or short, upon promise never to
demand any more, yet since they exact, and take more according to the length.

The Court-keeper.
Whereas this Officer requires ix. s. vi. d. for a Wager of Law, his due
being only xxii. d. the rest is to be divided amongst the Cryers, Wagermen, and
other Officers.

The Cryers.
Whereas it has been formerly certified that ii. s. is due to these Officers
for a Wager of Law, upon better consideration we find iiii. s. is due unto
them out of the ix. s. vi. d.

d. and for a Nisi prius xii. d. his due being but vi. d.

ii. s. anciently due, and ii. s. for making the Record.

He takes also ii. s. iiii. d. for a Nonsuite in a Writ of Error, being not
due, nor paid since 30. Eliz.

An answer to the last Articles.
THE Prothonotaries take by the Sheet, and not by the Roll, all the time of
our remembrance, every sheet containing twelve lines, and every line ten
words, according as they have certified in their note of Fees.

They take for the certifying the first cause vi. s. and for every other cause
ii. s. and so have anciently done.

The chief Justice his Fee for allowance of a Writ of Error was but xvii. s.
vi. d. being upon mean Process and single judgment, and if it exceed to Ex.

given by the Attorney as a gratuity.

We do not know of any Fees taken by Bills of Parcels, and at Etiam, more than
has been formerly taken Anno 30. Eliz.

The Judges take only iiii. s. for signing of a Writ of privilege, which Fee
is, and has been ancient for any thing we know, and the like for signing of a
Procedendo.

but there has been taken for the Judge ix. s. viii. d. and xii. d. to his man,
and being reversed in Court, iiii. s. as is formerly certified.

There is now paid to the Judges horsekeeper for trial of every cause at

Also there has been taken in some Circuits upon trial of every Nisiprius,
wherein a private verdict has been given (as Fees for the same verdict) to
the Judges Marshall for all manner of Fees to all Officers xv. s. viii. d. but
now of late the Judges servants and officers in some Circuits do demand, and
take x. s. more, not anciently taken.

The ancient Fee in a Prohibition, was ix. s. iiii. d. for every witness
produced to prove a suggestion out of Court, and in Court. iiii. s.

It is answered in the former Certificate, the ancient Fee for swearing an
Attorney in Court, was ii. s. to the Box, and now xx. s. is taken.

Every Attorney paies Tear^ely, of ought to pay iiii. d. to the Clarke of the

Exigenters Fees.
EVer since the Stat. of H. 8. which gave the Proclamation upon the Exigent,
the whole estate of the Exigenters Office did consist in the making of three
Writs, videlicet, an Exigent, a Supersid, and a Proclamation, All which Writs
are warranted by one and the same Record.

For all the time of our remembrance and experience in the said Court, which
has been (by the most ancient of us) for about thirty years, or thereabout,
the Fees of the said Writs were as follows, videlicet;

The Supersid. ii. s. xi. d. vi. d.
The Exigent, The Proclamation,
Which Fee of vi. d. was given by the Stat. of 6. H. 8. being now about one
hundred and ten years since.

About eight or nine years since the Supersid. ( quia improvide) being the
least Writ in labor, and more in profit than both the other, was granted by
Letters Patents under the great Seal of England, by the late King of famous
memory, to Master John Murray, then of his Majesty's Bedchamber, and partly to
avoid contestation with his said Majesty's grant, and upon hopes and promises
of some recompense another way, the Exigenters did give way to the said Patent,
and have ever since lost the benefit of the said Supersid. whereupon the Judges
did give increase only of i. d. to be taken upon the Exigent, for reliese of
the Exigenters and their Clerks, and so the Exigent was made xii. d. which
increase of i. d. is all the recompense which hitherto they have received for
that great loss of the Supersid.

We have likewise heard that about forty years since, and before our times by
occasion of an Act of Parliament, made 31. Eliz. whereby the Proclamation of
the Exigent was much enlarged without any addition or increase of ^ee, there
was i. d. added to the Exigent to be given to the poor Clerks for writing the
said Writs over and above the ancient allowance, which i. d. has ever since
been paid to the said poor Clerks accordingly, without any benefit to the
Masters themselves.

Other increase, addition, or alteration of Fees in our Offices we know not of,
nor ever heard of, although the length of the said Exigent, or Proclamation
with their entries, considering the length of the Supersid. (All which we
humbly submit to his Majesty's Commissioners) might perhaps have justly
deserved some further improvement. And it is certainly true, that no other
increase of Fees has been in our Offices since 11. Eliz. nor for ought we ever
heard, or can by any means conjecture for these hundred years at the least.

There has been also taken by their Clerks for about twelve or fourteen

thereof we know not.

In the Clarke of the Warrants Office.
WE can say nothing against the Certificate of the Fees of the Clerks of
this Office, but that they have usually been accustomed to be paid during our
remembrance, saving.

That there is, and has been by the space of eleven years or thereabouts
taken by him more than formerly upon every Fine iiii. d. for a Warrant of
Attorney which we know not to be used before.

In the Phillizers Office.
WE do also certify that the Fees mentioned in the Certificate of the

WE acknowledge that the Fees certified by the Chirographer himself, are the
usual and accustomed Fees which have been paid all the time of our respective
knowledges, but as to the Fees certified under Master Randals hand for the
Clerks Fees of that Office, we know no such Fees due to them for writing the
Chirograph of the said Fine, but we say, there has been used to be given to

Record, not exceeding eight sheets, v. s. and for every sheet more, vi. d.
and for engrossing every Record of Nisi prius upon old issues for every sheet
iiii. d. We do certify that there are no such Fees due unto them, And that
the Fees due for those Exemplifications and Ingrossements are satisfied and
contained in the Fees certified by the Master of the said Office.

The Cryers Fees.

the Proclamator claims and has.

defendants than one in a Writ, there is by them taken for the entry of the
reversall to discharge process thereupon, or upon a Writ of Error for every

all in one Writ of Exigent, that be reversed all one time.

Where there is demanded for search of an Outlarie for every Term within one

for Writs sued out by themselves.

THE Fees mentioned in the certificate under the hand of Master Senkey for the
Fees of the Proclamator, we think to be the usual and accustomed Fees which
have been paid to that Officer: But we certify that the Prothonotaries, and

which Fees are now claimed by the Cryers.

due unto him.

And as for the Fee of iiii. l. ix. s. by him demanded from the Officers of
this Court, toward the numbering and marking of the Rolls every Term, We know
not any such Fees due unto him, and if it be, We think it be not within our
inquiry.

The Court Keeper.
WHereas this Officer requires ix. s. vi. d. for every Wager in Law, his due
being only xxii. d. the rest is to be divided amongst the Cryers, Wagermen,

that there is only xii. d. due, and no more.

For the Fee of vi. s. viii. d. from the Clarke of the Treasury for hanging
the Cloth of the Court, We know no such Fee due to him, and if it be, it is

being but ii. s. due, and ii. s. for making of the Record.

better care to avoid Errors in sewing forth the said Fines and Recoveries.

FEBRVARII XVII. 1628.
ACcording to an order of his Majesty's Commissioners for inquiry after
exacted Fees, and innovated Offices, We whose names are hereunder subscribed,
have met and perused the Judges Certificate of Fees to us delivered by the said
Commissioners, which in our former presentment or certificate we could not so
exactly set down, as we did the Officers Fees, for that we received from the
Commissioners several certificates of the several Officers of the said Court,
concerning all their several Fees, but we then had not any certificate from
the Judges of their Fees by them demanded and certified, but we now having
received a certificate by the said Commissioners from the said Judges, do now
this seventeenth day of February, 1628. upon due consideration thereof had,
certify as follows, viz.

The Lord chief Justice his Fees.
INprimis, Touching the xx. s. mentioned by the Judges certificate for
allowance of a writ of Error, upon an Outlarie before judgment, or upon a writ
of Error upon a judgment, which in our former certificate we mentioned to be
but xvii. s. vi. d. upon either of them, We certify now, that for our
respective knowledges there has been paid in the whole xx. s. for every of the
same, but we conceive ii. s. vi. d. thereof was for the Lord chief Justice his
Clarks, and only xvii. s. vi. d. for the Judges.

Concerning the ii. s. iiii. d. for a Bail taken upon an Outlarie upon mean
process, the debt being xx. l. or above, mentioned in the Judges certificate, we
certify that the same has been usually paid since an Order made by the
Judges concerning the putting in of a Bail into that case.

Touching the xii. s. mentioned in the said Certificate for a Bail taken in
case of debt after judgment, we certify that since the Stat* made for
putting* in of Bail in that case, the same hat(...) been usually paid.

Touching the ii. s. for marking the Roll the writ of Error is allowed (...)
and ^ii. s. for every Supersid We (...)rtifie the same has been usually paid
to the Clarke of the Errors, but whether as due to the Judge, or his Clarke,
we know not, yet some of the ancientes^ men of the (...)y say, that there was
anciently paid for every such Supersid but ii. s. as we formerly certified in
our former Certificate under the title o^ the Fees of the Clarke of the Errors.

As to the Fee of ii. s. ^* d* for the seal of every Record of Nisiprius, the
same has been so anciently paid, saying in case of Prop^.

Touching the Lord chief Justice (...) Fee of i. d. for the scale of every
W(...) sealed in Court, and ii. d. for the seal of every Exemplification, we
certify them to be due, and parcel of the Fee of vii. d. and ii* ^* ii. d.
certified in our former Certificate under the title of Fees of the Seal Office.

Touching the rest of the Fees mentioned in the Judges certificate to be due
to the Lord chief Justice, we have usually paid the same, and therefore do
think them to be due.

The Fees due to such of the Judges as perform the business.
TOuching the Fee of vi. s. viii. d. for the acknowledging of a Fine, or
warrant of Attorney for a common Recovery out of Court, we certify as
formerly, that ix. s. viii. d. has been usually paid for the same in the
whole, but (as we conceive) the Judge has only vi. s. viii. d. and his Clarke
the rest.

Touching the ii. s. certified for an Affidavit taken out of Court upon a
foreign Plea, or Rescous, we certify that the same has been anciently paid,
but how the same has been anciently divided between the Judges and Clarks we
know not.

Touching the viii. d. certified by the Judges of every other Affidavit taken
out of Court, we do certify as in our former Certificate, that we have
usually paid xii. d. for the same, whereof we conceive iiii. d. is allowed to
the Judges Clerks, as appears by the Judges own Certificate of their
Clerks Fees.

Touching the Fee for granting a license to compound upon a penal Law, we
certify as heretofore we have done, that anciently ii. s. vi. d. has been
used to be paid, whereof we conceive ii. s. due to the Judge, and vi. d. to his
Clarke.

Touching the ix. s. viii. d. for every reversall of an Outlarie out of Court,
we certify that usually we have paid so much for one name, and if there have
been more names than one in the writ, then for every other name ii. s.

Touching the ii. s. iiii. d. for Bail taken out of Court upon an Outlarie in
debt upon mean process reversed, if the debt be xx. l. or above, we certify
that ever since the order was made by the Court for putting in Bail in that
case, the same has been usually paid.

Touching the iiii. s. certified for a warrant, for passing a Fine where there
are more than three Cognizors, or three Cognizees parties to the Fine, we
certify that it has been paid ever since the order made in that behalf, as
we have certified in our former Certificate.

Touching the rest of their Fees, we certify that we have usually paid the
same during our respective practices, and therefore think them to be due.

The Divident Fees.
TOuching the Fee of xx. s. mentioned to be paid for the admission of every
Attorney to be an Attorney of the same Court, we do certify that the
ancient Fee was only ii. s. howsoever of late years xx. s. has been paid,
videlicet, for about sixteen years.

Touching the residue of the Fees certified by way of Divident, we do certify
that we have usually paid the same during our respective practices.

The Puisne Judges Fees.
TOuching the xii. d. certified for every Fine drawn at the Bar, and xviii. d.
for every Recovery with a single Voucher drawn at Bar, and vi. d. for every
Voucher more, we certify the same to have been usually paid to the hands of
the said Secondaries.

Touching the xii. d. certified for taxing of costs upon every judgment, we
refer our selves to our former Certificate in that behalf made under the
title of the Prothonotaries.

Touching the xxxiii. s. for every puisne Judge from the Clarke of the
warrants, we say it passes not through our hands* nor lies in our knowledge,
but because the Judges have certified it, we (knowing nothing to the contrary)
think it to be due.

Touching the Fee of x. d. for return of every writ of Covenant brought to
levy a Fine upon, x. d. for the retourn of every writ of Entry to suffer a
common Recovery, every writ of Summons and Seizms thereupon, we certify as
before we have done, under the title of the Clarke of the Inrollments,
(whereunto we refer our selves) and conceive the same to be parcel of the ii.
s. claimed by the Clarke of the Inrollments.

And touching the residue of the Fees certified to be due to the puisne Judges
only, we do certify that we have usually paid the same during our respective
practices, and therefore think them to be due.

Ordinances made by Thomas Lord Coventry, Lord Keeper of the great Seal of
England, with the advice and assistance of the right honorable Sir Julius
Caesar. Knight, Master of the Rolls, in the Term of S. Michael the Archangel,
in the eleventh year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord King Charles, for the
redress of sundry Errors, Defaults and Abuses in the high Court of Chancery,
17. November. 1635.

1. THat Bills, Answers, Replications, and Rejoynders be not stuffed with
repetition of Deeds, or writings in haec verba, but the effect and substance of
so much of them only as is pertinent and material to be set down, and that in
effectual and brief terms, that long and needless traverses of points not
traversable, nor material, causeless recitals, tautologies, and
multiplication of words, and all other impertinencies occasioning needless
prolixity be avoided, and the ancient brevity and succinctnesse in Bills, and
other pleadings restored, and upon any default herein the party and counsel
under whose hand it passes, shall pay the charge of the copy, and be further
punished as the case shall merit.

2. When the Defendants have answered the Plaintiffes, and their counsel are
seriously to advise of the answers, and if they find that upon the answer
alone, without further proof, there be sufficient ground for an order or
decree to proceed upon the answer without further lengthening the cause, or if
it be needful to prove one or a few particular points to reply unto those
points, and not to draw into pleading, or proofs any more than those necessary
points, thereby making long books, and putting both sides to unnecessary
charges, the defaulters herein to be punished by paying the charge of the
copies, or otherwise, as the cause shall require.

3. That interrogatories for examining witnesses be drawn only upon points
material, and not upon matters which are either consessed in the pleadings, or
are impertinent and needless to be proved, That the articles which are usually
thrust into the beginning of every Schedule of interrogatories, as it were of
form or course, touching the witnesses knowledge of parties, plaintiffes or
defendants of the lands, towns, and places in the pleadings, and the like, be
not so needlessly used as they are, but if for cross examining any witness, or
for other special reason, it shall be necessary to minister any such question,
every man is left at liberty to do therein as much as shall be pertinent and
needful in a d^e and sitting place, and if any shall offend against this, the
party and such as drew the interrogatories shall be punished by paying as much
as the other side is by that means overcharged in copies, and further as the
case shall merit.

4. When the parties are at issue, and do proceed to examination of witness^s
either in Court, or by Commission, as the interrogatories are to be pertinent
and material, so the witnesses are to be sorted by those that produce them,
that they may be examined upon such interrogatories as are proper and sit for
them, and not to examine a multitude of witnesses upon a multitude of questions
altogether unknown to them, as it is too frequently done upon pain that where
any gross abuse or default herein shall be made appear to the Court, the
defaulter shall pay as much as the other side is by that means overcharged in
copies, and shall be further punished if the Court see cause.

5. When a Commission is awarded to examine witnesses, if by the default of him
that has the carriage of the Commission or his Commissioners nothing is done,
he shall bear all the charge that the other side was put unto about that
Commission, either for Fees of Court, bringing, or entertaining Commissioners
or witnesses, or otherwise to be ascertained by the oath of the party, or of
him that disbursed the money for him, and shall renew the Commission at his own
charges.

6. When a Commission is awarded to examine witnesses, and the one side
produces and examineth all his witnesses, and the other side does not, but
pray a new Commission, if it be granted, he shall bear as the charge of the
renewed Commission both in Court and in the Country, as well for the charge
and entertainment of his own Commission, as of the Commissioners of the other
side, and the other side shall be permitted to cross examine the witnesses
produced by him that renews the Commission, but if he will examine any other
witnesses of his own, then he shall bear his own part of the charge, the
charges herein mentioned to be ascertained by the oath of the party, or of him
that disbursed the money for him.

7. He at whose instance a Commission to examine witnesses after a former
Commission executed and returned is once renewed, and he by whose default, or
by default of his Commissioners a former Commission was not executed, and
thereupon it is renewed, shall at his peril examine all his witnesses by that
renewed Commission, o^ examine them in Court by the end of the Term wherein
that renewed Commission is retournable, without any more, or further delay.

8. When witnesses are examined in Court upon a Schedule of interrogatories,
there shall be no new interrogatorie put in to examine the same witnesses, but
the witnesses shall be examined only upon such interrogatories as were
exhibited before the witnesses to be examined were sworn, neither shall any
witnesses be examined in Court after the day of publication, though they were
sworn before, so as a copy of the rule of publication be delivered to the
examiner, whereby he may take know ledge of the publication.

9. When witnesses are examined in Court, they shall perfect and subscribe
their depositions unto such interrogatories as they have answered before they
depart from the Examiner, or his deputy, and shall not be permitted to make any
alterations thereof at any time after, without leave of the Court, unless it
be in some circumstance of time, or the like, or for making perfect of a sum
upon view of any deed, book, or writing which the witnesses shall show to the
Examiner, before he admit of such alteration.

10. The six Clerks who are the only Attournies in this Court, ought to
inform themselves continually of the state and proceedings of their Clients
Causes, whereby they may be able to defend their Clients, and to give account
to the Court as the Attournies in all other Courts do, and not to leave the
care and knowledge thereof upon their under Clerks who attend not in Court,
and the Clients and such as follow their Causes are to acquaint their
Attournies for that purpose.

11. Such as desire to have their Causes set down for hearing, must repair to
the six Clark that is Attorney in the Cause, at least six days before the end
of the Term, that the six Clark may inform himself of the state of the cause
of the long or short dependence thereof in Court of the antiquity of
publication of the weight or value of the causes, and all other circumstances
material, to inform the Lord Keeper, or the Master of the Rolls at the time
of setting down of causes, and the six Clark may not refuse to offer the same
to be set down, if he be attended in such due time as aforesaid, nor come
unprepared to inform the Lord Keeper or Master of the Rolls of the nature and
circumstance of the cause aforesaid, and neither he, nor any of his
under-Clarkes, nor any other are to take any Fee, Gratuity, or Reward for the
same.

12. The Registers in drawing up Orders shall use all convenient brevity
according to the manner of ancient times, they shall mention the material
Reports, Affidavits, and former Orders upon which any new Order is grounded to
have been read, but shall not repeat the same, they shall not unless it be by
special direction of the Court, fill any Order with the disputes of Council,
nor with reasons and allegations pro and con, nor mention any reasons but such
on which the Court relied in making the Order, and those with brevity and
clearenesse, and if they deliver a draught or copy of any Order to be perused
by Council, if it be not brought back within 24. hours, they shall enter the
Order without attending any longer for an answer from Council, only they shall
forbear the entries of Decrees and dismissions, until they be signed, that
the Lo: Keeper and the Master of the Rolls may reform them, if there be cause
at the signing.

13. Whereas the excessive and unnecessary length and charge of writs de
executione decreti have been complained of, from henceforth unless the party
that sueth out such Writ shall desire that the whole Decree as it is signed and
enrolled be therein recited, the writ, if it be only for payment of money shall
make no other recital but to this or the like effect, Cum per quoddam Decretum
in ^ur* Cancellar. nostr. die Ann^ ^egni nostri ordinat. and adjudicatum
exist^t quod tu solveres A. B. centum l b. legal. monetae Angl. t^b^ praec
p^mus and firmi^er injungend. mandamus quod praed. centum l^b. praefat. A. B.
debit. mod^ solvas et hoc nullatenus om^ttas periculo incumbente. And if the
money by the Decree be payable at certain days, or places, then the same
days and places to be expressed in the Writ without any further recital, and
if the Decrees be for doing other things to be performed by the party or
parties to whom the said Writ is directed, then no more shall be recited in the
Writ but the very decretall order, unless the decretall order do in such
manner refer to a Report, or Certificate, as without recital of those points
of the Report, or Certificate which are to be performed by the parties to whom
the said Writ is directed, it will not appear what is to be by them
performed, and in that case so much of the Report, or Certificate as is to be
performed by the said parties shall be recited, and the order confirming the
same, and no more unless it be desired by the party suing out the said Writ,
and the Fee thereof to be paid, shall be after the rate prescribed in the
table of Fees, and no more.

14. Every demurrer shall contain the causes of the demurrer, and the Counsel
who set their hands to it, are to beware that those causes be not trivial, and
where a demurrer or plea is grounded upon the substance and the body of the
matter, it shall be determined in open Court without reference, and the
Register at the instance of the party demurring, shall without any Fee put into
the paper of causes after the hearing and assigning a speedy day to every one
in order, as he comes to require it, and if the Defendant who demurred make
no such instance to the Register within eight days after the plea and demurrer
is put in Court, the same without any motion shall be disallowed of course as
put in for delay, and the Defendant shall pay ordinary costs, provided that the
Register do not without special warrant put above two of those demurrers into
the paper upon one day.

15. If the demurrer be grounded only upon some error, slip, or mistaking in
the Bill, no Reference shall be made thereof for a week after it comes in, but
the Plaintiff without any motion shall be admitted of course to amend the said
error, slip, or mistaking, paying to the Defendant, or his Attorney for his
use costs as the six Clerks not toward the cause shall think fit, but if
the Plaintiff in that time do not amend or alter it, then if the Defendant do
nothing therein within a week following, by getting it ruled or referred, it
shall be disallowed of course without any motion as put in for delay, and the
Defendant shall pay ordinary costs: but if the Plaintiff not amending the same
as aforesaid, it be ruled against him upon Reference, or otherwise, he shall
pay the ordinary costs.

16. When a Plaintiff excepteth to a Defendants answer, he shall set down his
exceptions in writing, and deliver it to the Council whose hand is to the
answer, or to the Defendants Attorney in Court, and if the Defendants do
within a week satisfy the Plaintiff of the invalidity of his exceptions, or
amend the answer in the same time, or agree with the Plaintiff, or his
Attorney, or Solicitor to amend it by such a time as shall be agreed on
between them, and do amend it accordingly without putting the Plaintiff to
obtain a Reference, or make any motion therabouts, then the Defendant shall pay
no costs, and if any Plaintiff shall press and procure a Reference within this
time, or before this course taken, the Reference shall be void, as obtained
surreptitiously; But if the Defendant do neither satisfy the Plaintiff, nor
amend his answer in manner aforesaid, then if upon Reference or otherwise his
answer be ruled insufficient, he shall pay costs according to the course of the
Court.

17. The Masters of the Court shall prefixe convenient, but not overlong days
for hearing such matters as are referred to them, and at the times prefixed
shall proceed without admitting any fained or dilatorie excuses, especially
that Council are otherwise employed, or cannot attend, or are not instructed
(there having been notice and time enough allowed, or the like, and after the
days shall speedily send in their Reports for the case of the Clients
attendance, which cannot but draw great charge.

18. If the Case be such as the Master cannot proceed in the absence of either
party, or his Counsel without just cause absenting, the Master is presently to
certify the Court of the default, that the defaulters may be punished by
Commitment, Costs, or otherwise, as the cause shall merit, and if the Master
do use or willingly admit any gross delay, the Reference is to be removed,
and the Master rebuked by the Court.

19. The Masters of the Court are not upon the importunity of Council, or
Clients to make special Certificates of matters wherein the Court expects an
opinion from them, nor are to do it, but where their own judgments in
respect of difficulty leads them to it, it occasioning for the most part a
needless trouble to the Court, and both delay and expense to the party.

20. No Reference shall be to a Master whether an injunction shall be granted
or not, but the same to pass upon the opinion and judgment of the Court, but
if the Court think the matter informed sufficient for an injunction, but is
doubtful of the truth any point of the information: The Court when it cannot
otherwise be fitly done, may be certified thereof by a Master who is then to
certify not only whether the information be in substance true, but if there
appear other matter to confess and avoid, or otherwise balance that
information he must not conceal it, but give the Court a clear and true
information.

21. No References are to be made either to Masters, or others (unless it be
by assent on both sides) to hear and determine the cause upon all the proofs
or otherwise; but when the Court has heard it, and reduced it to particular
points, specially if these points have relation to Accounts, or matter of that
nature, the Court may fitly leave such to be reduced to certainty by a Master.

22. The Register shall within ten days after the end of every Term certify
to the Lord Keeper what References depend in the hand of any Master, and how
long they have depended, that if any of them have depended overlong, the Court
may require an account thereof from the Master, and quicken him to a speedy
dispatch.

23. When a Master certifieth the sufficiency or insufficiency of an Answer,
Plea, or Demurrer, if either party rest not in the Report, but trouble the
Court to determine it, if the Masters Report be confirmed, he that opposes it
shall not pay double costs.

24. Where the Masters of the Court do sometime by way of inducement fill a
leaf or two of the beginning of their Reports, and sometimes more with a long
and particular recital of the several points of the orders of Reference, they
shall forbear such iterations, the same appearing sufficiently in the orders,
and without any other repetition then thus, According to an order, or by
direction of an order of such a date, shall fall directly into the matter of
their Report, setting down the same clearly, but as briefly as they can, for
the ease both of the Court, and the parties.

25. That Counselors be careful what motions they make, and especially that
they move not for any thing which may be had of course without motion, nor for
such thing as cannot be granted, as being a constant rule of the Court or
common Justice, nor yet for such things, as being granted, serve for little or
no purpose, And before they move the Court, they be sure to be well informed
and instructed, lest i^ the orders obtained by them upon misinformation to be
after avoided, their Clients or themselves be deservedly punished with costs,
or otherwise.

26. When orders be made, especially if it be upon hearing of Council on both
sides, or after day to show cause given, and none showed there being a timely
notice, both sides are to rest in it without troubling the Court with new
motions to cross it, unless the Counselor that moves it, be sure that the
matter he has to cross it be weighty and important, and will be well proved
upon the motion, such as shall do the contrary are to be punished with good
costs, and otherwise, as the Court shall find cause.

27. That no Counselor put his hand to a Bill, Answer, or other pleading,
unless it be drawn by himself, or at least perused by himself in the paper
draught before it be engrossed, and that the Counselor that puts his hand to
any such, shall be answerable for all things therein, either against these
orders or any other the orders or rules of the Court, except only such things
as are not to be misliked but for untruth, for which the Client if he informed
it, or such as caused it to be put in without his warrant or information, shall
be answerable.

28. If any Counselors shall presume to move for one in forma pauperis that
is not so admitted, and shall under that pretense move a second motion, the
Register shall enter neither of his orders, but shall within four days
acquaint the Lord Keeper, or Master of the Rolls with the abuse, that he that
did it may be condignely punished.

29. Counselors before they take on them to inform by motion, or otherwise
that any thing is contained in the Bill, Answers, Pleadings, Proofs published,
or in any Deeds or Records, ought to be careful in perusing the same
themselves, and not to rest upon the information of the Client, o^ his
Solicitor, who cannot so well judge of them, and whose part it is to produce
those things unto the Counselors, but it is the Counselors part to direct
how far forth the same are to be pressed or urged to the Count, and they are to
sustain the blame or punishment, if either wittingly or negligently, for want
of reading or perusing, they abuse the Court therein.

30. For avoiding a multitude of idle petitions drawn by persons altogether
ignorant of the orders and course of the Court, or the true state of the
petitioners business that petitions before they be presented to the Lord
Keeper, or the Master of the Rolls be showed to that six Clarke, who is the
petitioners Attorney in Court, or to his, and by him approved and subscribed,
for which no Fee shall be taken, and this is not to be understood of petitions
advised and signed by Council, nor petitions containing any matter of
complaint against the Attorney or his under-Clarke.

31. All the Clerks of this Court, in copying, engrossing, inrolling, or other
writing, shall do the same fairly, orderly, and Clark-like, not doing it
wastfully, nor in less Skins or Rolls of parchment, or leaves of Paper then
ought to be, thereby increasing their own and their Masters profit, or the
Subjects charge, and if the Master of the Office upon complaint to him, do not
do right therein, the Lord Keeper, or the Master of the Rolls shall punish
both the Master and the Clarke, and yield recompense to the complainant upon
complaint made to either of them, within two Terms after the offense done.
