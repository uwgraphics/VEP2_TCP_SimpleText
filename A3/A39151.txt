WHat unexpected damp is this we feel?
A sudden stroke that makes our Sion Reel,
Griefs Sable Livery the Godly wear,
Each Cheek looks pale, each eye big with a Tear;
The City eccho's with a dismal moan
That speaks, our Chariot and our Horsemen gone,
Caryl that powerful Soul-searching Divine
In whom Learning and Grace did jointly shine,
Whose grave discourse could make an Atheist quake
And trembling sinners Hells broad Road forsake;
The Tempest of a troubled spirit calm
And heal a broken heart wi^^ sacred Balm;
He, is snatched from hence beyond the Spears
And left us groveling in a vale of tears,
At such a loss, that unrelenting Eye
Is seven times worse than blind that can be dry;
No more shall we his melting Sermons hear
That pierced at once the Heart, and charmed the Ear;
His Prayers, which did so warm and holy come
The Angels strove which first would bear them home,
Nor shall we more behold his pious Life
Free from Excess, Sloth, Avarice and Strife,
That sweet Carriage, which did by practice teach
And made him every day aloud to Preach,
Now taken from his needful Office here
When Harvest does so great, and free appear;
"Souls have a care, Husband your Mercies well
"Let not Indulgence vainly make you swell
"God shows if you grow wanton, proud and Kick
"H' has other ways, to move your Candlestick,
But though( blessed Soul) we may his Loss deplore
For our own sakes, for his we Triumph more.
After a tedious Pilgrimage was past,
Spent in his Masters service till the last;
Release'd from all Toils, with joy he is gone
Up to receive a never fading Crown;
Up to those Patriarchs that did longer sit
Expecting Christ than the have enjoyed him yet;
Up to those Prophets which now gladly see
Their Prophecies grown to be History;
Up to the Apostles who did bravely Run
All the Suns Course with more light than the Sun;
Up to those Martyrs who did calmly bleed
Oil to the Apostles Lamps, Dew to their seed;
Up to that Throng of Saints to add one more
Whom by his Ministry he sent before;
There now he glitters in that White Robe Dressed
By's Farewell-Sermon so lively expressed;
Nor need we say he is dead, for do but look
Just as an Ancient Clock is piecemeal took,
Not to be lost, but by the makers skill
Repolish't without Error to go still,
So must this trusty Grave again restore
Him far more pure and glorious than before;
As China men after some Ages stay
Do take up Porc'lane where they buried Clay;
Death gets twixt Souls and Bodies such a place
As Sin insinuates twixt Just men and Grace;
Both work a Separation, no Divorce,
His Soul is gone to Usher up his Coarse
That refined Clay which more Celestial
Shall be, than Angels were for they could fall;
Nor is he dead to us, his works survive
Those Monuments shall keep him still alive,
Till time it self shall vanish out of date
And the world sink by its last Feav'rish Fate.
His EPITAPH;
Judicious Caryl here at rest does lie;
A fathful Labourer in Gods Husbandry;
A constant powerful Preacher many years;
Whose most Industrious Penn so fully Clears,
Jobs lofty Mysteries to our weaker sight
Purging our darkened minds with Beams of Light
"Now the Holy Author, and's Expounder meet
"And each other with Hallelujahs greet.
Aliud
Committed to his Tombstones Trust
Lies pious Caryls sleeping Dust,
Till the last Trumpets blast unite
Body and Soul in full delight;
May his Example and's Works be
A Lesson Reader unto thee
That so thy Soul when stripped of Clay
May soar up the same blessed way!
