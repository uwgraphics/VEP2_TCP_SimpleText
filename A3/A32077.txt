A Proclamation prohibiting the payment and receipt of Tonnage and Poundage,
and other impositions upon Merchandises, under color of the late pretended
ORDINANCE of both Houses of Parliament.
WE have made so many Declarations of Our Royal Intentions concerning the
preserving of the Religion and Laws of this Land, That We think it not fit
often to repeat, Though by Gods grace We seriously intend never to decline or
depart from the same. But this seems most strange unto Us, that whilst
(especially at, and about London) Our just and legal Commands are not obeyed,
other Orders and Ordinances, (for which there is no legal foundation) which
not only discountenance, but overthrow the Laws of the Land that settle
Religion, and were the senses of the Subjects property, are submitted unto and
obeyed by many of Our weaker Subjects: And amongst these a blind obedience has
been yielded unto the pretended Ordinance, for settling the Receipt of Tonnage
and Poundage, and other impositions upon Merchandises, without an Act of
Parliament, when an Act this Parliament (received from Us, and so understood by
Us, as one of the greatest graces the Crown ever conferred on the Subject)
declares, no such Paiments are due without an Act; and by that Act it is
provided, that all such Persons as receive the same incurr the forfeiture of a
Praemunire. This We thought would not have found obedience from the Merchant,
who understood what his own benefit was thereby, and could not be ignorant how
penal it was in him to break this Law; especially when he found he was to pay
those duties for support of an unnatural War against his Prince, and to
foment an intestine and Civil dissension which has already, and may in the
future produce so many Evils upon this poor People, contrary to the true
intention of the said Act. But upon the menaces and usage some received that
denied it, We find since a more general Obedience in such as Trade, then We
expected, though We understand by it the Trade of the Kingdom is much lessened.
Nevertheless We thought not fit until this present, by any of Our
Proclamations to prohibit the same, because We hoped before this time, We
having so often and by so many means endeavored the same, some happy
understanding might have been between Us and both Our Houses of Parliament. But
at present finding that the monyes arising from these Duties, are a great part
of the fuel that maintains this fire, and supports this unnatural Rebellion
against Us, and heightens the Spirits of such as have no Spirit to Peace,
unless they may destroy Us, Our Posterity, and the settled Government both of
Church and State; We do hereby Declare and Proclaim to all Our People of what
sort soever, That whosoever hence forward shall, by virtue of the said
pretended Ordinance of Parliament, pay any Monyes under the names of Tonnage
and Poundage, or other impositions upon Merchandise, other then for Customs to
be paid to Our proper Ministers, which are due to Us by the known Laws of the
Kingdom, That We will proceed against him or them in due time, as an
ill-affected person or persons to the Peace of this Kingdom, and as such as
endeavor (as much as in them lies) to hinder a true Intelligence betwixt Us
and Our People. And for such person, or persons as shall continue to require or
receive the same, contrary to the Statute made this Parliament, We shall like
wise proceed against them according to the penalty in the said Act. And because
(though the Law ought to have been every man's prohibition) We did not, until
this time, forbid the same, We do hereby grant Our free Pardon to all such as
formerly having either paid, or received these Customs, shall henceforth
refuse the same, And to no other.

Given under Our Sign Manual at Our Court at Oxford, the sixteenth day of
December, in the Eighteenth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
