APRIL the xxth. 1693. NEW PROPOSALS FOR Printing by Subscription, Cambden's
Britannia, English.
Newly Translated, with Large ADDITIONS.
CAMBDEN's BRITANNIA in English being very Scarce and Dear, the Price of a Fair
one being at present no less then Three Pound, though the Edition be but a very
bad one, and the Translation very ill; diverse Gentlemen have long desired the
Re-printing of it in English, and to the doing thereof great numbers have
already Contributed by Subscriptions: It is thought fit for the general
Advantage, that these Proposals for Printing the said Book by Subscription be
made public.

The Reputation and Worth of the Author and Book is so universally known that
nothing need be said here to Recommend it, except the Account of the Method to
be used in Printing this Edition.

Which shall be Printed in a fair Character, and on very good Paper, according
to this Specimen.

The whole Book new Translated from the Original, which several Gentlemen of
great Learning and Skill in the Antiquities of ENGLAND have undertaken to do.

In the former Translation made by Doctor Philemon Holland, many Additions of
the Translator, were by a very unwarantable Liberty inserted into the Text,
which are here put as Notes only at the end of the Page.

The Additions will be these,
A new Account of Mr. Cambden's Life and Works shall be given at large, with
Additions and Amendments out of his own Papers.

A Map of England as in the times of the Romans will be Printed according to
Antoninus's Itinerary, with the Names and Situation of the Roman Towns,
Colonies, and Ways.

A Corrected Map of England as in the time of the Saxons will be Printed in
like manner.

A general Map of England, Scotland, and Ireland; as also a particular Map of
each County, by Mr. Robert Morden, according to the newest Surveys that have
been made, together with all the Roads exactly marked out, and all the Places
mentioned by Cambden, inserted, though many of them have by time been quite
destroyed, and the Degrees of Longitude and Latitude Marked on the Sides.
Nothing shall be Printed on the Back of the Maps.

All the Discoveries that have been made in several Counties since Mr.
Cambden's Death, in the particular Histories of well nigh half the Counties of
England, and in several Manuscript and Histories, shall be added in short as
Notes, or set forth in the Dissertation following the whole Work; together with
an Account of all those Authors that have Illustrated England in General, or
any one County in Particular.

An Account of the Universities, Colleges, Schools, Coins, Buildings of
England, and the Seats of the present Nobility, shall be added at the end of
the Work.

The Manuscript Notes and Corrections of Mr. John Seldom will be added to the
Work, as likewise several other Corrections of Eminent Persons upon the whole
Work, or on part thereof, will be added in the Margin or at the bottom of the
Page, and not intermixed with the Text.

To which purpose, all Gentlemen that have made any such Corrections or Remarks
are desired to Transmit them to the Undertakers who will faithfully Insert them.

The large Discourse of Mr. Cambden concerning the Government of the Romans and
Saxons in England, concerning the Degrees in England, and the Courts of
Britain, will by large Marginal Notes be much Corrected and Improved, and some
Original Discourses on that Subject will be added by an Eminent Hand.

Diverse large INDEX'S and GLOSSARIES will be added at the end of the Work.

THE Maps mentioned in the former Proposals (though they were Designed
according to the newest Surveys very Correct, and contained all the Towns that
were mentioned in Cambden's yet) were not thought Large and Comprehensive
enough, by some Judicious and Ingenious Gentlemen that assist in the Work, Who
think it Proper and Necessary to have the Maps of every County full as Large as
this Sheet will admit, and to Comprehend every Town, Village, etc. throughout.

The Undertakers therefore to Comply with these and many other Gentlemen's
Desires, have Resolved to have the Maps so done; with all the Roads, and the
Degrees of Longitude and Latitude, and other considerable Additions and
Corrections never done before. Though the Expense will be at least 500 l.
Extraordinary.

Besides which, many Additions will be made to the Book more than were
mentioned; particularly a curious Collection of all the Public Coins of
England, supplying what are wanting in Mr. Cambden's of the Britains and
Romans, and adding those of the Saxons, Danes, etc. which will be done by an
Eminent Hand. And all the Coins fairly Engraved on Copper.

And for these Reasons we are obliged to raise the Price to Thirty Two
Shillings, which cannot be esteemed Dear, considering the great Charge
extraordinary, in Graving the Maps so Large, and the excessive Price of Paper
at this time, the Maps alone being worth the Money.

PROPOSALS.
THE Price of this Book to be but Thirty Two Shillings in Sheets to
Subscribers, whereof twelve Shillings to be paid in Hand, and the rest on
Delivery.

And for the Large Paper Fifty Shillings; Twenty Shillings whereof paid in Hand.

And for Encouragement to Subscribers, any Gentleman that shall Subscribe for
six Books shall have a seventh Gratis, which reduces the Price to Twenty Seven
Shillings and Six Pence per Book. No advantage can be allowed in the Large
Paper.

After the first Day of Trinity Term the Price will be Thirty Five Shillings.

It shall not be Sold to any but Subscribers under Forty Shillings in Sheets.

The Book shall be Finished and be ready to be Delivered at Hillary Term next,
without fail.

BRITAIN.
BRITAIN, by the Latins called Britannia, and Albion, by the Greeks (...), and
(...), the most Famous Island of the whole World, is divided from the Continent
of Europe by the Ocean. It lies over against Germany and France in a Figura
Triquetra. Caes. Com. l. 5.
Triangular Form, having it is Three Promontories shooting out three several
ways, viz. Belerium [the Lands End] toward the West; Cantium [the Foreland in
Kent] toward the East; Tarvisium or Orcas [the Point of Cathness in Scotland]
toward the North. On the West, between it and Ireland, the Vergivian [or Irish]
Sea breaks in; On the North it is beaten upon by the vast and wide Northern
Ocean: On the East, where it faceth Germany, it is washed by the German Ocean;
On the South over against France by the British Channel. Thus divided by a
convenient Distance from these Neighboring Nations, and made fit by its open
Harbors for the Traffic of the whole World, it seems to have advanced it self
on all side into the Sea, as it were for the general Benefit of Mankind. For
between Kent and Calais in France it runs so far out into the Sea, See in Kent.
and the Channel is so straight, that That Britain was ever by an Isthmus
joined Eastward to the Continent of France, seems an Improbable Opinion;
However, you may see (besides Authors cited by Mr. Cambden) White's Hist. Brit.
L. 11. Not. 11. Burton's Comment. on Antonin. p. 18. 19. Twin. de Rebus Albion
and Britan. Sammes, Britan. l. 1. c. 4. Verstegan, l. 1. c. 4. Some Foreigners
also, Dominicus, Marius Niger, Antonius Vols^us; Vivianus, and Da Bartas have
favored this groundless Tradition.
some are of opinion that a Breach was there made, and that the Sea has worked
it self through the Neck of Land, which before joined the two Countries to each
other; and to confirm it they bring Virgil in that Verse,

Et penitus toto divisos Orb Britannos.

And Britans quite from all the World disjoined.

Because as Servius Honoratus observes, that Britain was anciently joined to
the Continent. And Claudian in Imitation of Virgil,

-- Nostro diducta Britannia Mundo.

And Britain severed from our World.

It is not at all unlikely that the outward Face and Fashion of the Earth may
by the Deluge and other Causes have been altered, that some Mountains may have
been raised and heightened, and many High Places may have sunk into Plains and
Valleys; Lakes and Meers may have been dried up, and dry Places may have become
Lakes and Meers, and some Islands may have been torn and broken off from the
Continent. But whether it be true indeed, and whether there were any Islands
before the Flood, I shall not here argue, nor of God's Works inconsiderately
give my Opinion. All know that the Divine Providence has disposed different
things to the same end: And indeed it has always been allowed, as well by
Divines as Philosophers, That Isles scattered in the Sea do no less contribute
to the Beauty of the whole World in general, than Lakes and Lofty Mountains
dispersed about the Continents.

Livy and Fabius Rusticus have made the Form of this [Island] to resemble an
Scutulae Oblongae.
Oblong Platter, or Bipenni. See Sir H. Savile upon this place in Tacitus.
Two edged Ax; and such certainly is its Shape toward the South, (as Tacitus
observes) which yet has been ill applied to the whole Island. For Northward
that vast Tract of Land shooting forward to a Point, grows narrow and sharp
like a Wedge. The Ancients thought it so great, and so very large in
Circumference, that Caesar, The Panegyric spoken to Constantius, falsely
Entitled to Maximian.
who first of all the Romans discovered it, wrote that he had found out another
World, supposing it so great, that it seemed not to be surrounded with the Sea,
but even to contain and encompass the Ocean. And Julius Solinus Polyhistor
asserts, That for its largeness, it almost deserved to be called another World.
Nevertheless, our Age, by many and often Surveys, has now well nigh found the
true Dimensions of the whole Isle. For from Tarvisium [the Point of Cathness]
unto Belerium [the Lands end] reckoning the windings and turnings of the Shores
along the West side, are computed about DCCCXII Miles. From thence along the
Southern Coasts to Cantium [the Kentish Foreland] CCCXX Miles. Hence Coasting
the German Ocean, with crooked Bays and Inlets for DCCIV Miles, it reaches to
Tarvisium [the Point of Cathness]: So that by this Computation the whole Island
is in Circuit MDCCCXXXVI Miles. Which Measure, as it falls much short of
Pliny's, so it is somewhat less then Caesar's: Com. 5. Read Schimnius.
Schitinius Chius is not worth my mentioning, who in Apollonius de Mirabilibus
(having told us strange Stories of Fruits growing in Britain without Kernels,
and Grapes without Stones) makes its Circuit CCCC Stadia [Furlongs] and no
more. But Dionysius Afer in his Description of the World, has given a much
better Account of the British Islands, that is, Britain and Ireland.

(...)
(...)
Vast is the Compass of the British Coasts;
A like Extent no Rival Island boasts.
And with him Aristides and other Greek Writers agree, who by way of Excellency
have truly called Britain (...)the Great Island.

Now they that have more accurately compared the Spaces of the Heavens with the
Tracts of Earth, have placed Britain under the VIIIth. Climate, and include it
within the Later Discoveries have better Defined the Site of Britain, the
Longitude of the Lands End being but XI Degrees from Teneriff, and Cantium or
the Foreland but XVIII and an half. The Latitude of the Lizard L Degrees, and
of Cathness scarce LVIII and an half. Whence the longest Tropical Day is from
XVI Hours X Min. to XVIII Hours II Min. that is from the XVIIIth. to the XXVth.
Parallel.
XVIIIth. and XXVIth. Parallels, computing the longest Day at XVIII Equinoctial
Hours and an half. Belerium [the Lands end] according to the Spherical Figure
of the Earth, they place For XVI, Read XIII.
XVI Degrees and L Scruples from the farthest Point Westward; Cantium [the
Kentish Foreland] in XXI Degrees of Longitude. As for the Latitude they Measure
in the Southern Parts L Degrees X Scruples; at Tarvisium [Cathness] LIX
Degrees, XL Scruples. So that according to (...)
