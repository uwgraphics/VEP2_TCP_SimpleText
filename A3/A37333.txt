An Account of the Arraignment, Trial, Escape, and Condemnation, of the DOG of
Heriot's Hospital in Scotland, that was supposed to have been Hanged, but did
at last slip the Halter.
SIR,
KNowing that you are disirous to hear news from Scotland, I thought fit to
show you that that Act whereby all public Officers are obleadged to take the
Test, is rigorowsly put in executione, and thereby many persons both in Kirk
and State, throughout the hall^ Kingdom, by reasone they are not free to take
the said Test, are Incoutlnently turned out of there places, whilk severitie
gave occasion to a wheen Loun Ladd's belonging to the hospittal of Hariots
Buildings in Edenbrough, to divert themselves with somewhat like the following
Tragi-Commedy.

The Lounes it seems fell intil a debate amongist themselves, whither or no,
ane Mastiffe Tyke, who keept the outmost gate, might not by reasone of his
Office of Trust, come within the compass of the Act, and swa, be obleadged to
take the Test, or be turned out of his place,

(The Tyke thereupon was called, and interrogat, whither he would take the Test,
or run the hazard of forfaulting his Office, whilk was asked again, and again.

The silly Curr boding no ill, answered all their Queries with silence, whill^
had been registrat as a flat refusal, had not on of the Lounes, mair bald then
the rest, taken upon him to be his Advocat, who standing up, pleaded that
silence might as well be interpreted assent, as refusal, and thereupon insisted,
that it might be tendered to him in a way may plausible, and in a poustar
may agreeable to his stomach.

This Debat lasted not long, until all agreed, that ane Printed Copy should be
thrumbled of as little boulke as it could, and thereafter smured over with
Tallow, Butter, or what else might make may temping to his appetit; this
done, he readiely took it, and after he had made a shift, by rowing it up and
down his mouth, to separat what was pleasant to his pallat, and when all seemed
to be over, on a sudden they observed somehat (ilke piece after another) droped
out of his Mouth, qwhilk the Advocats on the other side said it was the Test,
and that all his irksome champing and chowing of it, was only, if possible, to
seperat the concomitant nutriment, and that this was mikel worse then an flat
refusal, and gif it were rightly examined, would upon Trial be sound no less
then Leiseing-making.

To this his Advocat opponed, That his Enemies having the rowing of it up,
might perhaps (through deadly spite) have put some crooked prin intil it, and
that all the su(...)ling and rowing of it up and down his mouth, might be by
reason of the prin, and not through any scu^^ering at the Test it self, and
that there was naught in the hail matter, that looked like Leiseing-making,
except by interpretation, and his Adversaries allowed to be the only
Interpreters. Yea, what was mair offered, that his Client should have a fair
Trial before competent Judges, qwhilk was unanimously granted.

A Court thereupon being convocat, ane assize constitut, the Indictment being
read, there fell out warm pleading upon both sides, amongst the Advocats, those
against him pleaded, that he was (...) to take so mikel upon him, and that the
chaming and cherking of the Test belonged naught to him, nor to none like him,
who served only in inferior Offices, and that his trust and power reached
naught so far, and by what he had done, he had made himself guilty of mair nor
a bare refusal, according as was Libelled. Those for him pleaded, That he could
be guilty of nather, since he had freely taken it in his Mouth, willing to have
swallowed it down, and that there was no fault in him, bot in its self, that it
passed not, since it fell a sqwabeling, one part of it hindering another
fighting in his half, and if would have agreed in its self, to have gone down
all one way, he would blaithly swallowed it, as he had done many untouthsome
morsel before, as is well known to all the Court, ane other pleaded, that he
had officiat very dutifully, and was niver known to balk his Trust: bot that
was answered with this, all his former good Service could not excuse his
present guilt; guilt qwoth an other, if that be guilt, he has many marrows,
and why should he be worse handled then all the rest? bot what ever could be
said in his favors, when the business came to the Jury, they found that he had
so mangled the Test with his explanatory tongue and teeth, and swa misleardly
abused it with his slaver, that it was right soon agreed upon, to be at least
Interpretative-Treason, and consequently brought him in guilty of
Leiseing-making. Whereupon he was ordered to close Prison, till ane other time,
that the Court call him forth to receive his doom, to be hanged like a Dog.

(As the Lounes was removing him from Court to Prison, there chanced a Curat to
be present, who asked, what was the matter, what ailed them at the Dog? one of
the Limmers answered, That he being in public Trust, was reqwired to take the
Test, and had both refused it, and abused it, whereupon he was to be hanged; the
Curat storming, said, They deserve all to be hanged for such presumptuous
mockery; the Lounes laughing aloud, cried out with one consent, That he and his
Brethren deserved better to be hanged, then any of them, or the Tyke eather,
smoe they had swallowed that which the Tyke had refused.

This surpriseing Verdict, you may be sure, created no small grumbling of the
gussorne with the Advocats and others, who spared not to utter there private
sentiments, and blaze abroad the Arguments Pro, and Con, and what further might
have been homolagating, had not the Court haisted to have the Tykes Life, take
a few of them as they come to hand.

Some suspected deadly fewd in the Chanselor of the Jury, alleging that ane
Enemy was not fit to be a Judge, this was answered with, that he was of more
Noble Extract, then to stain his Honor with so base an Act, and that his own
Reputation would make him favored; an other objected, that a Tykes refusing so
good a Test, might be of ill example to Creatures of better reason; to this a
pakie Loun answered, That it could not be good, since Lion Rampant, King of
Tykes, nor none of his Royal Kine, would not so much as lay there Lips to it, far
less to swallow it, and therefore, -- this was interrupted by on, who was a
principal Limmer among them (a contradiction reconciler) who would needs help
him with a Logical distinction, whereby he like ane Aberdeens man, might Cant
and Recant again.

Bot he was soon snibed by another, who said, That the Tyke would nather sup
Kail with the Div'l, nor the Pope, and therefore needed not his long Spoon; well
said ane other, this is mair nor needs, since we are all sure that the Tyke
cold not have kept his Office so long, bot he most needs have swallowed many a
buttered Bur before this time, and it was bot gaping a little wider, and she
hazard was over. Nay, qwoth his Nighbour, the hazard was greater then ye
imagine, for the Test, as it was rowed up, had many plyes and implications in
it, one contrary to another, and swa the Tyke might have been qucikened ere it
had been all over, ilk ply as it were rancountering another wresling and
fighting in his ^ass.

Prait, quoth an other, this ^ast Apology is needless, since the Tyke has (in
my opinion) swallowed the better part, if not the hail Test, though I most
confess, he has vomited it up again, let us therefore try him, if like a Dog he
will lick up his own vomit, bot this project was universally rejected, bait by
the may charitable, as bo^tless, and by the mair severe, as to great a favor.

Favor (qwoth a Chield, who had been sk^eping all the while, and only heard the
word favor) what, show favor to such a Loun as he? na, rather let him who has
the longest Arm, thrust it so far down his Throat, so that an other may pull it
out at his Tail, then be thus ^^sht with him, though he were my own Brother,
and then we may be sure he has taken it, and all the parts of it; bot this
only moved Laughter, for none was found that would undergo so foulsome a hazard.

But to return to the Tyke, for some will be curious, to hear what came of him,
matters being th^^ precipitat, and all hopes of reprieve uncertain. A Wily
Loun advised him to lay by the Sheeps (which had done him so little good) and
put on the Foxes skin, who covertly through fear, hiding his own t^^^ between
his Legs, and griping an others train, passed through all the Gates
undiscovered, and swa is a missing.

This be was forced, when right did fail
To give them the flap with a Foxes Tail.
Now what is become of him sine syne, and what proclaimations was issued out
after him, you may probably hear hereafter.

Mean while, because the contradiction reconciler was so soon (contrary to the
Laws of disputation) interrupted, before he could bring forth his Logical
distinction; and since the curious have sorely tortured there Ingines, searching
which of the Schoal nicitie that might; I shall only trouble you with a few of
there conjectures, and leave it to the Judgment of the Learned to determine,
which had been may suitable.

One fancied that it was this, that the Tyke might take the Test, Secundum
Quid, though not Simpliciter, ane other, in sensu diviso, though not in sensu
composito, a third, that though it was deadly to take it with verbal
interpretatione, yet it might be safe enough, with mental reservatione, a
fourth, be thought him on this, that though his stomoch did stand at it, in
s^nsus^urivoco, yet might easily digest it in sensu and aequivoco; a fifth,
(gerning the while) was for this, that it might take it, though not formaliter,
in at his mouth, by way of Potion or Bolus, yet fundamentaliter in at this
bottom, by way of Glister or Suppository? a sixth, brought forth this blind
whely, that it might he safely taken, In veheculo caecae obedintiae, bot could
not think on the other member of the distinction; and some said it had none,
the times when it was used being so ignorant and unintentive; a seventh, who
thought all the former distinctions too subtle and airie, and that which was
bred in the bone went niver out of the flesh, except by more severe Medecins,
then was yet tried, proponed, an admirable compound to be used, as an excellent
preperative to the Test, alleging, that all those needless scroupolosities
did proceed from these ill humors, which could not be expelled, without the
total evacuation of Christianity; the Receipt, as it was transcribed out of the
Packet of Advice from Rome, take as follows, from the Laboratory of the
Inquisition, June 22.

After many Years pains and study, a niver failing Medicine, called a
Catholic Pill, to purge out Christianity, approved by the most Learned
Fathers in Spain, Italy, and other places; the true Receipt is as follows,

Receipt Take (...) pound weight of ^^^-Ignorance, as many Drhames of Monckish
Devotion as you can get, half a score of planary Indulgences, and a douson of
well conceived Equivocations, Venial Sins, as many as you please, and a pocket
full of Dispensations, boil all these in a Jesuits Brain pan, and add thereto,
of the Doctrine of probable Opinions, and of Seminary Priests Loyalty, quantum
sufficit, after fermentation Clape in Nine Miracles prepared, secun dum artem,
by the Assigns of Father Cressy, to give it a Tincture, sprinkle a small dash
of Penance, and wrap up the whole mass in the Popes Infalibility, and take it
blindfold in a Cup of Absolution, at any time of Life, bot especially at the
hour of Death, and it will do your bussiness. The Operation is downward, or
infernal, carrying all humors that way. It is also Opiat, or stupifying, because
after a sufficient Dose of it, you may swallow any Malignity whatsomever,
without any hazard of griping. Probatum est.

Now Sir, The news of the Tykes escape being blazed abroad, the Court
assembleth to consult, what, was then anent to be done, several overtures was
proponed; one said, that the affronting escape, and other misdemeanors of that
Tyke, was so great, that the highest severity was too little, an other said,
fine he is gone, let him go, what have we more to do, bot put another in his
place; a third said, that his presumptuous and treasonable carriage, would be of
ill example to others, unless due punishment followed thereupon; a fourth said,
had he not been confident of his own Innocence, he would niver have byden a
Trial, and sine he met with such a surprising Verdict, what could he do less,
then flee for his Life? would not the best in the Court, if he had been in his
Circumstances, done the like; a fifth said, if he had been condemned, and
hanged in time, he had not played us this prank, bot seeing we have missed
himself, let us seize well on what he has left behind him. After debating,
they came to a conclusion, and ordered the s^im to be Published; the Tenor
whereof follows,

Whereas ane cut lugged, brounish colored Mastiff Tyke, called Watch, short
leged, and of low stature; who being in Office of Public Trust, was required
to take the Test, and when it was lawfully tendered to him, he so abused it,
and mangled it: whereupon he, after due Trial for his Presumption, was Convict
of Treason, and sincesyn has broken Prison, whereupon the Court adjudges him,
To be hanged like a Dog, whenever he shall be apprehended; and in the mean
time, declares his Office, his hail Estat heiratable and moveable, and all
causualties belonging to him, to be Echeated and forfaulted, and Ordeans the
Colectors of the Court to uplift his Rents and Causualties, and to be countable
to the Court, both for diligence and intermisson, and also discharges all
persons to reset or harbor the Fugitive Trator, and likeways, gives assurance
to all persons, who shall eather apprehend him, or give true information of
him, swa that thereupon he bees apprehended, the person swa doing, shall have
500 l. for his pains, given at our Court, etc.
