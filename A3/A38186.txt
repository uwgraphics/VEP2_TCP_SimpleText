Die Mercurii, November. 9. 1642
WHereas it is found that great inconveniences have insued for want of a strict
and severe discipline to have been observed in the Army now raised by authority
of Parliament, under the command of Robert Earl of Essex, And for that the
Laws and Ordinances by him set forth for the government of the said Army have
not been put in due execution: It is now Ordained and Declared by the Lords and
Commons in Parliament assembled, That from henceforth the Officers and
Soldiers of the said Army may not expect any further forbearance of such
punishment to be inflicted on them for any their Offense, as shall be due unto
them by the said Laws and Ordinances, But that the Lord General may and ought
to punish them by death or otherwise according to their demerits.

ORdered, That this Order be forthwith printed and published.
