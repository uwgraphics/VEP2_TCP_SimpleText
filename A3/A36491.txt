The DOWNFALL OF THE WHIGGS: Or, Their Lamentation for Fear of A Loyal
Parliament.
To the Tune of, Patrick Flemmen he was a Valiant Soldier.
I.
Did ever see the like, dear Brother,
Our Saints they are falling all together?
The Presbyter, 'Pendant, and Quaker,
We Have neither Hopes in the House, nor Speaker!
II.
The Torys Drink to the Confusion
Of our Damned Members for the Exclusion;
And Curses our Assosiation,
Z -- s, let us run quite out of the Nation.
III.
How durst they make L'Estrange a Member!
Our Mortal Foe, and bold Offender?
Whom our late Parli'ment Attempted,
They Would Hanged him if he had not prevented.
IV.
At Westminster under our Noses,
Our numerous VVhiggs over Powers Opposes,
And by two Thousand Votes Out-pol'd Us,
The Devil I am sure, has forsook or sold Us!
V.
Shall the Saints who used to have the Glories,
To Vote and Spew out all the Torys,
The King no Money must have, they agreed on it
Unless he will pawn his Crown and Head on it!
VI.
This Parli'ment will give us Caution
As formerly, to mind every Motion;
But if the Old Cause should be Overruled,
They must expect by the Rout for to be Schooled.
VII.
York and Durham, Oxford, Cambridge,
Gloucester, Winchester, with Advantage;
Nay, every County and Corporation,
And the Devil a Word of Arbitration.
VIII.
Dangerfield in the Name of Monmouth,
Used to Knight Men, now is in the Dungeon:
Him we saved to save Oats our Father,
But now we fear they will Hang both together.
IX.
Now to save our Saints from Disasters,
We Will Snugg in the Bosoms of our Sisters.
If the Parli'ment send for to Gail us,
Their Smocks our Surplis, none shall Unvail us.
FINIS.
