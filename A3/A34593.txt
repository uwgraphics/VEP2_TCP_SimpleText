So prays your Highness most humbly devoted, J. B.

A DISCOVERSE OF The life of the most Illustrious PRINCE HENRY late PRINCE of
Wales.
IN this most Illustrious PRINCE, may most cleerlybee discerned, that Gods
judgments are only known to himself, and his thoughts and determinations
unsearchable: For having so framed and fashioned him, as his most rare parts in
youth gave so many presages of his becoming to his divine Majesty, (from whom
he received them) an honor and glory, to the world a wonder, and to the people
of these Kingdoms an exceeding happiness; yet was he pleased in the spring
of his years, and of the hope had of him, to take him to himself, and to
deprive the world of him, neither could of his short life (so far as the eyes
of man could discern) the reasons grow either out of neglect, or want of
performance of duties to God, or of obedience to his Parents, the observance of
which Commandment, only has the enlarging of time upon this earth annexed
unto it: for in the first, it cannot be denied but he was exceedingly
observant, never failing to sacrifice unto God the first of his actions, to
continue in them with all demonstration of reverence, without any diversion or
distraction; to cherish such as in whom he found ability to teach, and piety to
express in life the fruits of their doctrine, to resolve so far to become
immutable in the Religion he professed, as long before his end with solemn
protestations, he vowed that he would never join in marriage with a wife of a
different faith, and had besides a determination (if longer he had lived) to
have made choice of a Chapleine of his own, a man in years, grave in
Divinity, rarely learned, and of great discretion, experience and wisdom, by
whose advice in all matters, spiritual and tending to the rectifying of his
Soul, he intended to have received a continual direction.

Of the second, to speak not by heresay, but of mine own knowledge (howsoever
some moaths and mice of Court in that time, not enemies to him in particular)
but maligners of true virtue, and only friends to their own ambitions and
desires, to possess the ears and opinions of Princes, had in that particular
traduced him: So true and sincere he was both in profession, and execution of
all duties and obedience, and bare so natural and filial a reverence and
respect to the King his Father, as although sometimes out of his own
inclination, or the incitation and encouragement of others, he repaired to the
Court and moved the King in some things, either concerning the Commonwealth,
his own particular interest, or that of others; yet with the least word,
countenance or sign given him of his Majesty's disallowance, he would
instantly desist from further pursuit of it, and return either with
satisfaction in regard that he understood it to be disagreeing with his
Majesty's pleasures, or with such a resolved patience, as he neither in word
nor work gave so much as any semblance of being displeased or discontented:
Nay, which is more, sotruly was he affected to the pleasing and satisfying of
the King his Father in all things, as some good time before his death, he made
unto my self a solemn protestation, that to the end he might not in any thing
^ee either displeasing or give the least distaste unto his Majesty, he would
from thenceforth utterly remove his thoughts from all affairs whatsoever, that
should not particularly concern himself, his own estate, or the government
of his household.

In this discourse of that memorable Prince, I will for bear to speak of his
infancy or youngest years, (although I have heard by such as did then attend
him) the same did most presage his ensuing virtues. My purpose and desire is to
deliver to hing but verities known to my self, not things received by
tradition from others.

In the first spring of his year of understanding, the King his father
committed unto him the disposing of the Lands and Revenues assigned to him, and
the government of his household; for the administration whereof, his Majesty
appointed unto him certain especial Officers; in the number of whom (my self
being not long before returned out of Spain, where I served the King diverse
years as his Ambassador) was constituted Treasurer of his house.

The place gave me occasion continually to attend him, and the especial favor
that I after found with him, not only means to observe his actions, but to
become particularly acquainted with the most of his thoughts.

My first step into his favor and especial trust, grew out of that which with
some other Princes would have cast me down either into perpetual disgrace,
or at least into a temporary distaste and dislike, hardly recoverable; I so
much admired his judicious parts in so unripe an age, and discerned in him so
great a will to know, and so Noble and rare a disposition to give ear to
advertisements, as out of the duty of my place, and extraordinary affection to
himself, taking hold of some fit occasion and opportunity, I adventured to
make proof whether he would endure advice or advertisement reprehensive.

Young Princes left to their own wills, and great men that are set upon the
highest stage of worldly greatness, and lulled in the lap of fortune, do
rarely endure a reproving voice, especially from those of a lower form.

I take the occasion from a then general supposall, or at least, suspicion of
a little too much straightness of his hand in rewarding and of some errors in
his actions, but did so tenderly tread upon those grounds, and with so retiring
a foot, as occasioned a discovery from himself of desire to receive and have
a full sight of them, before I pulled off the mask wherewith I had covered
them.

In conclusion, I delivered them in substance plainly, but in words soft and
respective, (as to such a Prince became me) Kings and Princes being to be
treated with, with words of silk not of iron.

To the first, he gave answers satisfactorily.

To the other, excusively.

But what were the fruits succeeding to his ever enduring honor, Truth
enforces me to publish, that I ever after in mine own particular, found my
self exceedingly engreated in his favor, and that those few things that were
erred became reformed.

To this so rare a disposition, which being by a Prince entertained, cannot but
make him both scient of the Offices appertaining to his high estate, and in
time also, as good as great, which in one borne to govern, of all things is
the most desirable, is to be added another virtue in one of Regal power, as
valuble, and not much less necessary: So very close he was and faithful a
keeper of whatsoever secret was disclosed unto him, as it was never known to
any, that ever he discovered any one word in that kind delivered unto him.

Apt he was to hear and desirous to receive advertisements and advises, by any
in whom he descerned knowledge gained by learning, or abilities won out of
time, and experience to give them, neither did he take them in Transitu: As in
the old Testament they celebrated the Passover, nor as a man receives his
cloak to put about him, not within him; but gave both time to the deliverers
to relate them, and leisure to himself to consider and digest them.

Counsels are to be chewed not swallowed, he would therefore unrip every seame
of them by interrogations used by himself, and receive reasons and resolutions
by those that offered them, until by mature debate and consultation, (which
are the true foiles that give cleernesse and assuredness to counsels) he had
both perfected and made them sollid and fit for his use whenever occasion
should be offered.

In the government of his household in years so very young, he gave examples
imitable to all other Princes.

His family was ample, as that which consisted of few less then five hundred,
many of them young Gentlemen, borne to great fortunes, in the prime of their
years when their passions and appetites were most strong, and their powers and
experiences to temper and subject them to reason most weak, his judgment, his
grave and Princely aspect, gave temper to them all, his very eye served for a
commandment, and more and better service have I noted to be done by the very
looks of him, then by sharp reprehensions of some other Princes: If any
questions or quarrels were moved amongst his servants, he would give a stop
and stay to them, at the very beginning by referring them to some such of his
principal Officers, as he thought to be most scient in matters of that
nature, and best did know to give just compensation to the inured, and reproof
to them that should be found to have offered the wrong; so as in so numerous a
family there was not so much as any blows given, or any countenance of quarrel
or debate between any.

Plenty and magnificence were the things that in his house he especially
affected, but not without such a temper as might agree with the rules of
frugality and moderation; he caused to be set down in writing unto him the
several heads of al his annual charges, the ordinary expense of his house and
his stables, the charge of his apparel and wardrobe, his rewards and all such
other things, as yearly were to be issued out of his coffers, and comparing
them with his annual revenue, did so judiciously fashion and proportion them
by shortning what he found superfluous, and increasing what was wanting and too
short in any of them, as he reduced them to a certainty, and such as his
revenues would well defray, besides a yearly spare of some thousands of pounds
which he reserved for a store or treasure to be ready for all events and
occasions accidental.

By giving of which so good and solid foundation and order unto his state, he
delivered himself from all necessity of becoming rigid or strait to his
Tenants, either by any unmeasurable improving their Farms or their Fines, or
seeking or taking advantage of any their forfeitures, and became also
unnecessited to take the benefit that both law and right afforded unto him, of
such as had in time of former Princes purchased lands appertaining to his
Duchy of Cornwall, which could not by Law be alienated from the same, to whom
out of his Princely bounty and gracious compassion, upon resuming of them, he
gave some reasonable satisfaction.

The banquets and feasts that any time he made, his desire was, should be
magnificient and agreeing with his Princely dignity, yet not without an
especial eye and care had that nothing should be spent in disorder, or the
charge made greater through the want of providence, or well managing by his
officers; in those he ever affected the demonstration of a Princely
greatness, and that all things should pass with decency and decorum, and
without all rudeness, noise or disorder.

In any thing either committed or permitted unto him by the King his Father,
concerning the State and defense of the Kingdom, exceeding willing, sedulous
and careful he ever showed himself, to perform all offices and duties
understandingly, and with much circumspection.

His Highness during his abode in that place, lay at Mr. Legates house, then
Clarke of the Chequer.
He was once sent by his Majesty to take view of the Navy at Chatham, whither
my self waited upon him and observed how great his desire was not only to see
with his own eyes every particular Ship, but to enable himself by conference
and consultation with the best experienced of his Majesty's Officers of the
Navy, in the fashion and fabricature of the Ships, to understand their
strengths and the form of their sailing, to take knowledge of such as were
then perfited and fitted for present service, and which defective, and in what
several parts, to the end there might instantly be order given for the
repairing of them; he also very perticularly informed himself of their
several equipages and furnitures, went in person to take an exact view of them
and of his Majesty's store for that purpose, and would not be satisfied
without understanding the special uses of every of those things, and of all
other that tended to make them serviceable and useful, what further in years
more ripe was in Navall affairs, wherein consisted the principal strength,
honor and advantage of this Kingdom, to be expected of him, may easily be
discerned by his will, his diligence, his understanding and Princely courage,
showed upon occasion of discourse, delivered unto him by a servant of his own,
concerning a Navall war with Spain, whenever that King shall give cause of
a public hostility.

To publish particulars agrees not with the rules of State, but two especial
things being propounded, which were the preparation of a Navy, consisting of a
certain number of Ships to be sent into the West Indies, and another to
attend the coasts of Spain to prohibit all entry or issue of Ships either into
or out of the same.

Admirable it was in one of years so young, to hear what interrogations he
used of every particularity of that design, of the feisiblenesse and of the
difficulties of every branch of it, how he insisted upon every doubt, until
by the best experienced and practiced both in Sea services and in Navigation,
with reasons and demonstrations he became fully satisfied, and that done, how
narrowly and nearly he searched into every knot, both of the honor and
utility, and of the danger and charge that an attempt of that nature would draw
with it, and ceased not until he understood every particular of the same, and
especially the yearly charge which that whole expedition would amount unto;
which having found so very reasonable, and the hopes so great, and all doubts
so well resolved, to show the valor of his own heart, he openly protested to
such as were present, that should the King his Father be pleased upon any
future occasion to break with Spain, himself (if so it should agree with his
Majesty's pleasure) would in person become the executor of that Noble attempt
for the West Indies.

In persons private it may suffice to be Religious, honest and just within
themselves.

To Princes and men constituted in high places, it behooves to be also givers
of good example to others.

Inferiors and Subjects cast their eyes more upon what Princes do, then upon
what they command, their examples with them are of more force then any Law of
letters.

This became to this Prince so great a motive, as he thought not fit to lose
any hours of the life that upon this earth were appointed unto him, but so to
bestow them, as they might not only become profitable to himself, but
imitable and exemplary to others

He so distributed the day by dividing his hours into the service of God, to
the apting himself to the office he was borne unto, both in government Civil
and Military, and to necessary exercises and recreations, as no part of it
could be said to be in vain bestowed; to enable his knowledge in government
civil, he read Histories, the knowledge of things passed conducing much to
resolution in things preseat, and to prevention of those to come.

In the military, he added thereunto the Mathematics study of Cosmography,
and had one that instructed him in the matter and form of fortifications.

For practice, he used in a manner daily to ride and manage great horses, with
which he had his stables most excellently furnished, oftimes to run at the
Ring and sometimes at Tilt, both which he so well and dexterously performed,
and with so great a comeliness, as in those his first years, he became second
to no Prince in Christendom, and to many that practiced with him much
superior.

His other exercises were dancing, leaping, and in times of year fit for it
learning to swim, at sometimes walking fast and far, to accustom and
enable himself to make a long march when time should require it; but most of
all at Tennis play, wherein, to speak the truth, which in all things I
especially affect, he neither observed moderation, nor what appertained to his
dignity and person, continuing oftimes his play for the space of three or four
hours, and the same in his shirt, rather becoming an Artisan then a Prince,
who in things of that nature are only to affect comeliness, or rather a kind
of carelessenesse in show, to make their activities seem the more natural,
then a laborious and toiling industry.

Of this and of his diet, wherein he showed too much inclination to excessive
eating of fruits, he was as in all other things content to hear advice, but in
these two particulars not to follow it.

To other play or gaming, he showed himself not much inclined, yet would
sometimes play at Obesse at Biliors and at Cards, but so very Nobly and like
himself, as plainly showed his use of it to be only for recreation, not for
appetite of gain; for whether he won or lost, his countenance was ever the
same, and for the most part, greater appearance of mirth in him when he was in
loss, then when he won, thereby plainly demonstrating both his judgment in
adventuring no more then what he made no regard of if he lost it: and his
Princely magnanimity and temper in suffering no passion or alteration to take
hold of him through any crossenesse of Cards or chance.

In some young Gentlemen whom he affected, he seemed to mislike too much
disposition to play, and did not only disadvise them from it, but gave unto
some of them matter of value to become bound to leave the use of it; for
pleasure he took them all as it were in passage without semblance, either to
desire them, or at least to have a will to dwell in them.

The pleasure of the flesh, especially which is most incident to young years,
and by Princes rarely avoidable, whose fancies and affections, are commonly as
vehement as their persons and powers are great; and therefore most like to fall
themselves, and give occasion of falling to others, although some in those
times, there were that taking measure of him by the yard wand of their own
unbridled appetities, were pleased otherwise to conceive and report of him, yet
my self having been present at great feasts made in his house, whereunto he
invited the most beautiful and specious Ladies of the Court and City, could
neither then discover by his behavior, his eyes or his countenance, any show
of singular or especial fancy to any, or at any other time such looseness
either in words or action, as whereupon in justice or reason to ground any such
opinion of him.

But rather thus with truth and assuredness to determine, that were he not
himself chaste in his inward thoughts, yet did he with so incomparable
judgment and temper cover them, as to just and judicious eyes they gave no
true occasion to suspect him.

It is true, that to take a wife though he showed no vehement desire, yet he
demonstrated a good inclination.

Marriages were propounded and offered for him in Spain, in the time that my
self there served, who had from the King his Father commission to treat it,
but finding that the overture there, grew rather out of a desire to win time
to advance their own designs, then with true intention to perform it, in
regard of the difference of Religion, I for my part gave end to that
negotiation in a manner so soon as I began it.

After my return from thence and entry into his Highness service, like
motions were made both by Florence and Savoy: But those not conforming with
what in alliances with Princes of his greatness, either in increase or
equality of Honor or Utility, or for strength and surety of estate was
especially to be regarded.

That of Spain was upon a new overture, made by the Ambassador of the King
there, again entertained and committed by his Majesty here, to be treated of
by his Ambassador, who in that Court succeeded me.

But after some protractions used there, it was upon the first opening, found
to have come too late, that Princess for whom the Treaty was intended, being
the eldest daughter of that King, and the only who in years was fit for him,
being formerly promised to the French King that now is.

Lastly, there grew a proposition for a daughter of France, wherein his
Highness having as in duty it became him, submitted and reserved himself to
the King his Father, the same was not proceeded in, to any effect.

In this Noble Prince was to be observed a singular integrity and cleernesse of
thoughts; he had a true Kingly disposition, and so far from being induced to
piece up the skin of the Lion, with that of the Fox, as above all things he
hated flattery and dissimulation.

A Noble man in those times, in the highest favor with the King his Father,
wrote unto him by the especial commandment of his Majesty, a letter wherein
he recommended unto him a matter of very great consequence to be instantly
answered unto, and in his subscription used these words, Yours before all the
world.

This answer his Highness committed unto me, who having written it, did also
set down some words of favor to the Noble man to precede his Highness
Signature; the letter it self he read, and having considered it, allowed it
wholly without alteration.

Only in regard of the words of subscription, notwithstanding the great haste
that he made of the dispatch, he commanded me, it should be new written and
those left out, and notwithstanding all the reasons that I used to the
contrary, would by no means be persuaded to suffer it so to pass, saying,
that he to whom he wrote had untruly and unfaithfully dealt with him, and that
his hand should never affirm that his heart thought not.

This Prince as he was no coverer of his thoughts where he had just cause of
dislike, so would he also to those he trusted, he acknowne of his love to such
as he affected.

Of the titular Nobility of this Kingdom upon occasion offered, he would
express himself best to love and esteem such as were most anciently
descended, and most nobly and honestly disposed, when sometimes also he would
not forbear by name to particulate.

His Highness brother our now Sovereign then Duke of York, and his sister
since that time Queen of Bohemia he entirely loved; yet must I confess at
sometimes by a kind of rough play and dalliance with the one, and a semblance
of contradicting the other, in what he descerned her to desire, he took a
pleasure in giving both to the one and the other, some cause in those their so
tender years to make proof of their patiences.

To say the truth, such were both those excellent Princes, their own rare
parts and most sweet dispositions, as had there been none other attractive of
blood or nature would to them have enforced his love and best affection.

He gave also in the administration and government of his own particular
estate, much presage of what he would have become if he had lived to possess
the Diadem.

At such times as he attended the King his father to houses of remove, or in
progress, he would not endure that carriages or provisions, should be taken
for him without full contentment given to the parties.

In removes to his own houses in like manner.

Nay so careful he was that none by him, or any of his train should be
either prejudiced or annoyed; as whenever he went a hawking, before harvest
ended, he would take care that none should pass through the corn, and to give
them example, would himself ride rather a furlong about, truly and judiciously
conceiving that to Princes there is no surer fortress then that of hearts, and
that those once had and settled, the rest of what they possess is at their
commandment.

Of his disposition to justice, he gave also upon all occasions much proof
and demonstration.

He would never either condemn or censure any man unheard or undefended,
retaining in his memory that notable example given to Princes by God himself,
whose divine knowledge both of works and thoughts, needing no informers; yet
after Adams fall, would neither censure him nor his Eve without hearing what
either of them could say in their own defense.

This I could demonstrate by diverse particulars, as also of his being
misericordious after offense acknowledged, should not a long discourse seem
unproportionable to so short a life.

It is true, that he was of an high mind, and knew well how to keep his
distance, which indeed he did to all, neither admitting a near or full
approach either to his power or his secrets.

He oftimes protested that neither fantasy nor flattery should move him to
confer upon any a superlative place in his favor, but would to the uttermost
of his understanding, measure unto all according to the merit of their
services, as holding it not just to yield unto affections, or rather second
respects, that which is only due to virtue and deservings.

That remunerative he was of services, and considerative of those that
deserved and and needed.

A most memorable and imitable example he gave before his death, having to
diverse of his servants, who longest had served, and in whom he noted want,
given by several Patents sent unto them, Pensions during life, to the value of
eleven or twelve hundred pounds by year, and that without all mediation and
entreaty by others, and at a time when themselves did least expect it.

To conclude of this Prince, did he not all things well? The fault is rather
to be imputed to those that in years so unripe, by their advice should have
assisted him and lined out his ways, then to any want of will or Religious and
Princely disposition in himself.

He was of a comely personage, of indifferent stature, well and straight
limmed, and strongly proportioned, his countenance and aspect inclining in
those his young years to gravity and show of Majesty.

His judgment so far beyond what his age could promise, as it was truly
admirable.

His speech slow and somewhat impedimented, rather as I conceive, by custom
and a long imitation of some that did first instruct him, then by any defect in
nature, as appeared by much amendment of the same.

After that he had been advised to a more often exercise of it, by using at
home amongst his own servants, first short discourses, and after longer as he
should find himself enabled.

Yet would he oftimes say of himself that he had the most unserviceable tongue
of any man living.

Toward the latter part of his time, so well became foreign Princes by their
Ambassadors informed of his rare parts, as the adverse to this Kingdom
began to fear and redoubt him, and the well affected and confederated to
love and entertain great hopes of him.

But God seeing it good to bestow another Crown upon him, excelling all that
on earth was to be had or hoped.

After some five days sickness endured with patience, and as often
recognition of his faith, his hopes and his appeals to Gods mercy, as his
infirmity which afflicted him altogether in his head would possibly permit.

He yielded up the Ghost at Saint James next Westminster, and was interred at
Westminster, where his body now rests.

I wish it were in my power to raise such a monument unto his fame, as might
eternise it unto all posterities.

FINIS.
