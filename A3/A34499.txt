The Copy of a Paper Presented to the KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY BY THE
Spanish AMBASSADOR, The third of May, 1661.
SIR,
THe 28th. of March the Spanish Ambassador delivered unto Your Majesty a
writing, representing the dangerous consequence of the Po^tug^es Marriage
proposed to Your Majesty, as also the solid Advantages which Your Majesty might
obtain from Spain in this present conjuncture with Peace, Tranquillity and
Commerce, abandoning the Chimerical Propositions made by the Portugu^s, who
offers noth^ng but doubtful things, not having any lawful possession of them,
and cannot serve but to occasion a War between England and Spain, he not being
able to assist Your Majesty to maintain it, neither can he ever of himself make
any W^r against England, though Your M^j^s;ty should abandon him, and embrace
the Interest of Spai^, whereby you shall receive an infallible benefit, instead
of those vain Offers made by the other, not having reallity in them: And in
regard the Ambassador has not yet received any answer, notwithwithstanding
Your Majesty has often assured him he should receive it, he finds himself
obliged to put your Majesty in remembrance thereof, and to demonstrare to Your
Majesty according to the last Order that he has received from the King his
Master, That over and above the Offers which he has already made for the
Princess of Denmark, and for the Princess of Saxony, or any other Princess that
may seem pleasing to Your Majesty. He does now propose the Princess of O^a^ge,
whom his Catholic Majesty will adopt and endowre with the same Advantages
which have been proposed with the Princess of Denmark and Saxony, in case that
she be more pleasing to your Majesty, and with those very same Advantages and
Conditions which Your Majesty desired with the Princess of Parma, when Your
Majesty thought that, that Marriage would be convenient for You; being he
believes that that with the Princess of Orange will be of great satisfaction to
Your Majesty's Kingdoms for several Reasons of great consideration; and in
particular, for the nearness and neighborhood of that Princess; especially,
all Your good Subjects desiring nothing more, then to see Your Majesty speedily
married, and which cannot be elsewhere but with many delays, and those
exposing the Conclusion to many Chances and Accidents, which may render it
ineffectual. Moreover it is represented, that your Majesty's marriage with the
Portugues, does not stand with the continuance of the Peace and Commerce
between Spain and England, the which is even supposed in that Pamphlet written
in favor of Portugal, where the Author concluding a breach with Spa^n,
endeavors to persuade, that the Commerce with that Nation is no way profitable
to England, but his Reasons are as weak and as false as those which are
alleged in another Pamphlet set out to authorize and make good the Duke of
Braganza's Usurpation of the Crown of Portugal; and as the Reasons in the
latter Pamphlet be evidently false; so if it please your Majesty to command the
Commit of Commerce, or any other person understanding that Commerce, to
consider the Reasons alleged in the former, where he insists to make it
appear, That the Commerce with Spain is not absolutely necessary to England,
his Discourse will be found weak, groundless, false, and proceeding from ill
intentions unto both Kingdoms.

And for what belongs to the Dowry, which some of your Majesty's Ministers have
looked on, whether it be sufficient or proportionable to Your Majesty, the
Ambassador says, That it is the same which has been demanded, and with which
other great Kings have been contented. But if Your Majesty instead of the
ordinary Dowry, does desire at present other things more proportionable to Your
convenience, Your Majesty may please to declare them, being it is certain that
Your Majesty ought not to doubt of obtaining from the good Will and Power of
the Carholick King, much greater Advantages (and those real ones, and to be
enjoyed in peace and quietness) then those that Portugal does offer, and from
which no benefit will ensue, but rather engaging Your Majesty in a War, which
ought to be avoided for the good of Your Kingdoms, being that which the
Catholic King proposes, is without hazard, and with all the Advantages that
Your Majesty can desire for the good of the Subjects of both Crowns,
