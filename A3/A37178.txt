A DISCOURSE UPON GONDIBERT.

An Heroic POEM Written by Sr. WILLIAM D'AVENANT

With an Answer to it by Mr. HOBBS.

A PARIS, Chez MATTHIEV GVILLEMOT, rue Saint Jaques au coin de la rue de la
Parcheminerie, a l'Enseigne de la Bibliotheque, M.DC.L.

To Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT, upon his two first Books of GONDIBERT, finished
before his Voyage to America.
THus the wise Nightingale that leave^ her home,
Her native wood, when storms and winter come,
Pursuing constantly the cheerful Spring
To foreign Groves does her eid Music bring:
The drooping Hebrews banished Harps unstrung
At Babylon, upon the willows hung;
Yours sounds aloud, and tell's us you excel
No less in courage then in singing well:
Whilst unconcerned you let your Country know,
They have impoverished themselves, not you:
Who with the Muses help can mock those fates
Which t^reaten Kingdoms, and disorder States.
So Ovid, when from Cesar's rage he fled,
The Roman Muse to Pontus with him led:
Where he so sung, that we through Pity's glass
See Nero milder then Augustus was.
Hereafter such in thy behalf shall be
The indulgent censure of Posterity.
To banish those who with such art can sing,
Is a rude crime which its own curse does bring
Ages to come shall never know how they fought
Nor how to love their present youth be taught.
This to thy Self. Now to thy matchless Book,
Wherein those few that can with judgment
look
May find old Love in pure fresh language told,
Like new stamped coin made out of Angel gold.
Such truth in Love as th'antick world did know
In such a style as Courts may boast of now.
Which no bold tales of Gods or Monsters swell
But humane passions, such as with us dwell.
Man is thy theme, his Virtue or his Rage
Drawn to the life in each elaborate Page.
Mars nor B^llona are not named here;
But such a Gondibert as both might fear.
Venus had here and Hebe been out-shin'd
By thy bright B^r^h^, and thy Rhodalind.
Such is thy happy skill, and such thy ods
Betwixt thy Worthies and the Grecian Gods.
Whose Deities in vain had here come down,
Where mortal beauty wears the sovereign Crown:
Such as of flesh composed, by flesh and blood
(Though not resisted) may be understood,
ED. WALLER.
To Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT, upon his two first Books of GONDIBERT, finished
before his Voyage to America.
MEthinks Heroic Poesy, till now
Like some fantastic Fairy land did show;
Gods, Devils, Nymphs, Witches, and Giants race,
And all but man, in man's best work had place.
Thou like some worthy Knight, with sacred Arms
Do drive the Monsters thence, and end the Charms:
Instead of those do Men and manners plant,
The things which that rich soil did chiefly want.
But even thy Mortals do their Gods excel,
Taught by thy Muse to Fight and Love so well.
By fatal hands whilst present Empires fall,
Thine from the grave past Monarchies recall.
So much more thanks from humane kind does merit
The Poets Fury, then the Zelots Spirit.
And from the grave thou make this Empire rise
Not like some dreadful ghost t'affright our eyes;
But with more beauty and triumphant state
Then when it crowned at proud Verona sat.
So will our God rebuild Man's perished frame,
And raise him up much better, yet the same:
So God-like Poets do past things rehearse
Not change, but heighthen Nature with their Verse.
With shame methinks great Italy must s^e
Her Conquerours called to life again by thee:
Called by such powerful Arts that ancient Rome
May blush no less to see her Wit overcome.
Some men their Fancies like their Faiths derive,
And count all ill but that which Rome does give:
The marks of Old, and Catholic would find;
To the same Chair would Truth and Fiction bind.
Thou in these beaten paths disdain'st to tread,
And scorn'st to Live by robbing of the Dead.
Since Time does all things change, thou think not fit
This latter age should see all new, but Wit.
Thy Fancy, like a Flame, her way does make,
And leaves bright tracks for following Pens to take.
Sure it was this noble boldness of the Muse
Did thy desire to seek new Worlds infuse:
And he're did heaven so much a Voyage bless
If thou can plant but there with like success
AB. COWLEY.
The Author's Preface to his much honored friend Mr. HOBBS.
SIR,
SInce you have done me the honor to allow this Poem a daily examination as it
was writing, I will presume, now it has attained more length, to give you a
longer trouble; that you may yield me as great advantages by censuring the
Method, as by judging the Numbers in the matter. And because you shall pass
through this new Building with more ease to your disquisition, I will acquaint
you, what care I took of my materials ere I began to work.

But first give me leave (remembering with what difficulty the world can show
any Heroic Poem, that in a perfect glass of Nature gives us a familiar and
easy view (...) our selves) to take notice of those quarrels, which the Living
have with the Dead: and I will (according as all times have applied their
reverence) begin with Homer, who though he seems to me standing upon the Poets
famous hill, like the eminent Sea-mark, by which they have in former ages
steered; and thought he ought not to be removed from that eminence, lest
Posterity should presumptuously mistake their course; yet some (sharply
observing how his Successors have proceeded no farther than a perfection of
imitating him) say, that as Sea-marks are chiefly useful to Coasters, and
serve not those who have the ambition of Discoverers, that love to sail in
untried Seas; so he has rather proved a Guide for those, whose satisfied wit
will not venture beyond the track of others, then to them, who affect a new and
remote way of thinking; who esteem it a deficiency and meannesse of mind, to
stay and depend upon the authority of example.

Some there are, that object that even in the likelyhoods of Story (and Story,
where ever it seems most likely, grows most pleasant) he does too frequently
intermixe such Fables, as are objects lifted above the Eyes of Nature; and as
he often interrogates his Muse, not as his ^ationall Spirit but as a Familiar,
separated from his body, so her replies bring him where he spends time in
immortal conversation; whilst supernaturally he does often advance his men to
the quality of Gods, and depose his Gods to the condition of men.

His Successor to fame, (and consequently to censure) is Virgil; whose Toils
nor Virtue cannon free him from the Pievishnesse (or rather curiosity) of
diverse Readers. He is upbraided by some (who perhaps are affected Antiquaries,
and make prioritie of time the measure of excellence) for gaining his renown by
imitation of Homer: Whilst others (no less bold with that ancient Guide) say,
he has so often led him into Heaven, and Hell, till by conversation with Gods
and Ghosts, he sometimes deprives us of those natural probabilities in Story,
which are instructive to humane life: And others a^firm (if it be not
irreverence to record their opinion) that even in wit, he seems deficient by
many omissions; as if he had designed a penance of gravity to himself and to
posterity: And by their observing that continued gravity, me thinks they look
upon him, as on a Musician composing of Anthemes; whose excellence consists
more in the solemness, then in the fancy; and upon the body of his Work as on
the body of a Giant, whose force has more of strength, then quickness; and of
patience, then activity.

But these bold Censurers are in danger of so many Enemies, as I shall wisely
shrink from them; and only observe, that if any Disciples of unimitable Virgil
can prove so formal, as to esteem wit (as if it were levity) an imputation to
the Heroic Muse (by which malevolent word, Wit, they would disgrace her
extraordinary heighths) yet if those grave Judges will be held wise, they must
endure the sat of Wisemen; who always have but few of their Society; for
many more then consist of their number (perhaps not having the sullenness to
be of it) are taken with those bold flights, and think it is with the Muse
(whose noble Quarry is men) as with the Eagle, who when he soars high stoopes
more prosperously, and is most certain of his prey. And surely Poets (whose
business should represent the Worlds true image often to our view) are not
less prudent then Painters, who when they draw Landschaps, entertein not the
Eye wholly with even Prospect, and a continued Flat; but (for variety)
terminate the sight with lofty Hills, whose obscure heads are sometimes in the
Clouds.

Lucan who chose to write the greatest actions that ever were allowed to be
true (which, for fear of contemporary witnesses, obliged him to a very close
attendance upon Fame) did not observe that such an enterprise rather beseemed
an Historian then a Poet: for wise Poets think it more worthy to seek out truth
in the passions, then to record the truth of actions; and practice to describe
Mankind just as we are persuaded or guided by instinct, not particular persons,
as they are lifted, or levelled by the force of Fate, it being nobler to
contemplate the general History of Nature, then a selected Diary of Fortune:
And Painters are no more then Historians, when they draw eminent persons
(though they term that drawing to the life) but when, by assembling diverse
figures in a larger volume, they draw passions (though they term it but Story)
then they increase in dignity and become Poets.

I have been thus hardy to call him to account for the choice of his Argument,
not merely as it was Story, but because the actions he recorded were so
eminent, and so near his time, that he could not assist Truth, with such
ornaments as Poets, for useful pleasure, have allowed her; lest the feigned
complexion might render the true, suspected. And now I will leave to others the
presumption of measuring his Hyperboles, by whose space and height they
maliciously take the dimension of wit; and so mistake him in his boiling Youth
(which had mervellous forces) as we disrellish excellent Wine when fuming in
the Lee.

Statius (with whom we may conclude the old Heroicks) is as accomptable to some
for his obligations to Virgil, as Virgil is to others for what he owes to
Homer; and more closely then Virgil wa^ts on Homer, does Statius attend Virgil,
and follows him there also where Nature never comes, even into Heaven, and
Hell: and therefore he cannot escape such as approve the wisdom of the best
Dramaticks; who in representation of examples, believe they prevail most on our
manners when they lay the Scene at home in their own Country, so much they
avoid those remote regions of Heaven and Hell: as if the People (whom they make
civil by an easy communication with reason (and familiar reason is that which
is called the civility of the Stage) were become more discreet then to have
their eyes persuaded by the descending of Gods in gay Clouds, and more manly
then to be frighted with the rising of Ghosts in Smoke.

Tasso (who revived the Heroic flame after it was many ages quenched) is held
both in time and merit, the first of the Moderns; an honor by which he gains
not much; because the number he excells must needs be few, which affords but
one fit to succeed him; for I will yield to their opinion, who permit not
Ariosto, no nor Du Bartas, in this eminent rank of the Heroicks; rather then
to make way by their admission for Dante, Marino and others. Tasso's honor too
is chiefly allowed him, where he most endeavors to make Virgil his Pattern:
And again, when we consider from whom Virgil's spirit is derived, we may
observe how rarely humane excellence is found; for Heroic Poesy (which, if
exact in it self, yields not to any other Humane Work) flowed but in few, and
even those Streams descended but from one Grecian Spring: And it is with
Original Poems as with the Original Pieces of Painters, whose Coppies abate
the excessive price of the first Hand.

But Tasso though he came late into the world must have his share in that
Critical War which never ceases amongst the Learned; and he seems most
unfortunate, because his errors which are derived from the Ancients, when
examined, grow in a great degree excusable in them, and by being his, admit no
pardon. Such as are his Council assembled in Heaven* his Witches Expeditions
through the Air, and enchanted Woods inhabited with Ghosts. For though the
elder Poets (which were then the sacred Priests) fed the World with
supernatural Tales, and so compounded the Religion, of Pleasure and Mystery
(two Ingredients which never failed to wo^k upon the People) whilst for the
eternity of their Chiefs (more refined by education) they surely intended no
such vain provision) Yet a Christian Poet (whose Religion little needs the aids
of invention) has less occasion to imitate such Fables, as meanly illustrate
a probable Heaven, by the fashion, and dignity of Courts; and make a
resemblance of Hell, out of the Dreams of frighted Women; by which they
continue and increase the Melancholy mistakes of the People.

Spencer may stand here as the last of this short File of Heroic Poets; Men,
whose intellectuals were of so great a making, (though some have thought them
liable to those few censures we have mentioned) as perhaps they will in worthy
memory out-last even Makers of Laws, and Founders of Empire, and all but such
as must therefore live equally with them, because they have recorded their
Names; and consequently with their own hands led them to the Temple of Fame.
And since we have dared to remember those exceptions which the Curious have
against them; it will not be expected I should forget what is objected against
Spencer; whose obsolete language we are constrained to mention, though it be
grown the most vulgar accusation that is laid to his charge.

Language (which is the only Creature of Man's Creation) has, like a Plant,
seasons of flourishing, and decay; like Plants, is removed from one Soil to
another, and by being so transplanted, does often gather vigor and increase.
But as it is false Husbandry to graft old Branch^s upon young Stocks: so we may
wonder that our Language (not long before his time created out of a confusion
of others, and then beginning to flourish like a new Plant) should (as helps to
its increase) receive from his hand new Grafts of old withered Words. But this
vulgar exception shall only have the vulgar excuse; which is, that the unlucky
choice of his Stanza has by repetition of Rhyme brought him to the necessity of
many exploded words.

If we proceed from his Language to his Argument, we must observe with others,
that his noble and most artfull hands deserved to be employed upon matter of a
more natural, and therefore of a more useful kind. His Allegorical Story (by
many held defective in the Connection) resembling (me thinks) a continuance of
extraordinary Dreams; such as excellent Poets, and Painters, by being
overstudious, may have in the beginning of Fevers: And those moral visions
are just of so much use to Humane application, as painted History, when with
the cousenage of lights it is represented in Scenes, by which we are much less
informed then by actions on the Stage.

Thus, Sir, I have (perhaps) taken pains to make you think me malicious, in
observing how far the Curious have looked into the Errors of others:
Errors, which the natural humor of imitation has made so like in all (even
from Homer to Spencer) as the accusations against the first, appear but little
more then repetition in every process against the rest: and comparing the
resemblance of error in persons of one generation to that which is in those of
another age, we may find it exceeds not any where, notoriously, the ordinary
proportion. Such limits to the progress of every thing (even of worthiness as
well as defect) does Imitation give: for whilst we imitate others, we can no
more excel them, then he that sails by others Maps can make a new discovery:
and to Imitation, Nature (which is the only visible power and operation of
God) perhaps does needfully incline us to keep us from excesses. For, though
every man be capable of worthiness and unworthiness (as they are defined by
Opinion) yet no man is built strong enough to bear the extremities of either,
without unloading himself upon others shoulders, even to the weariness of
many. If courage be worthiness, yet where it is overgrown into extremes, it
becomes as wild and hurtful as Ambition; and so what was reverenced for
Protection grows to be abhorred for Oppression. If Learning (which is not
Knowledge, but a continued Sailing by fantastic and uncertain winds toward
it) be Worthiness, yet it has bounds in all Philosophers; and Nature that
measured those bounds, seems not so partial, as to allow it in any one a much
larger extent then in another; as if in our fleshy building, she considered the
furniture and the room, alike, and together: for as the compass of Diadems
commonly fits the whole succession of those Kings that wear them; so throughout
the whole World, a very few inches may distinguish the circumference of the
head^ of their Subjects: Nor need we repine that Nature has not some
Favorites, to whom she does dispense this Treasure, Knowledge, with a
prodigious Liberality. For as there is n^ one that can be said vastly to exce^^
all mankind; so diverse that have i^ learning transcended all in some one
Province, have corrupted many wit^ that great quantity of false gold; and the
authority of their stronger Science has often served to distract or perver^
their weaker disciples.

And as the qualities which are termed good, are bounded, so are the bad; and
likewise limited, as well as gotten by imitation; for amongst those that are
extraordinary, either by Birth or Brain (for with the usual pride of Poets, I
pass by common crowds, as negligently as Princes move from throngs that are
not their own Subjects) we cannot find any one so egregious (admitting cruelty
and avarice for the chiefest evils; and errors in government or doctrine, to
be the greatest errors) but that diverse of former or succeeding times may
enter the scales with them, and make the balance even; though the passion of
Historians would impose the contrary on our belief; who in dispraise of evil
Princes are often as unjust and excessive as the common People: for there was
never any Monarch so cruel, but he had living subjects; nor so avaricious, but
that his subjects were richer then himself; nor ever any disease in government
so extremely infectious, as to make an universal Anarchy; or any error in
Doctrine so strong by the maintainer, but that Truth (though it wrestled with
her often and in many places) has at some season, and on some ground, made her
advantages and success apparent: Therefore we may conclude, that Nature, for
the safety of mankind, has as well (by dulling and stopping our progress with
the constant humor of imitation) given limits to courage and learning, to
wickedness and to error, as it has ordained the shelves before the shore, to
restrain the rage and excesses of the Sea.

But I feel (Sir) that I am falling into the dangerous Fit of a hot Writer;
for, instead of performing the promise which begins this Preface, and does
oblige me (after I had given you the judgment of some upon others) to present
my self to your censure; I am wandering after new thoughts: but I shall ask your
pardon, and return to my undertaking.

My Argument I resolved should consist of Christian persons; for since Religion
does generally beget and govern manners, I thought the example of their actions
would prevail most upon our own, by being derived from the same Doctrine and
Authority; as the particular Sects educated by Philosophers were diligent and
pliant to the dictates and fashions of such as derived themselves from the same
Master; but lazy and froward to those who conversed in other Schools. Yet all
these Sects pretended to the same beauty, Virtue; though each did court her
more fondly, when she was dressed at their own homes by the hands of their
acquaintance: And so Subjects bred under the laws of a Prince (though Laws
differ not much in Morality or Privilege throughout the civil World, being
every where made for direction of Life, more then for sentences of Death) will
rather die near that Prince, defending those they have been taught, then live
by taking new from another.

These were partly the reasons why I chose a Story of such Persons as professed
Christian Religion; but I ought to have been most inclined to it, because the
Principles of our Religion conduce more to explicable Virtue, to plain
demonstrative Justice, and even to Honor (if Virtue the Mother of Honor be
voluntary and active in the dark, so as she need not laws to compel her, nor
look for witnesses to proclaim her) then any other Religion that ever assembled
men to Divine Worship. For that of the Jews does still consist in a sullen
separation of themselves from the rest of humane flesh, which is a fantastical
pride of their own cleanness, and an uncivil disdain of the imagined
contagiousnesse of others; and at this day, their cantonizing in Tribes, and
shynesse of alliance with neighbors, deserve not the term of mutual love,
but rather seems a bestiall melancholy of hearding into their own Walks. That
of the Ethnicks, like this of Mahomet, consisted in the vain pride of Empire,
and never enjoined a Jewish separation, but drew all Nations together; yet not
as their companions of the same species, but as slaves to a yoke: Their
sanctity was Honor, and their Honor only an impudent courage, or dexterity
in destroying. But Christian Religion has the innocence of Village
neighborhood, and did anciently in its politics rather promote the interest
of Mankind then of States; and rather of all States then of One; for particular
endeavors, only in behalf of our own homes, are signs of a narrow moral
education, not of the vast kindness of Christian Religion, which likewise
ordained as well an universal communion of bosoms, as a community of wealth.
Such is Christian Religion in the precepts, and was once so in the practice.
But I resolved my Poem should represent those of a former age, perceiving it is
with the servants of Christ, as with other servants under temporal power, who
with all cleanness, and even with officious diligence perform their duty in
their Masters sight; but still as he grows longer absent, become more
slothful, unclean, and false. And this, who ever compares the present with the
Primitive times* may too palpably and with horror discern.

When I considered the actions which I meant to describe, (those inferring the
persons) I was again persuaded rather to choose those of a former age then the
present: and in a Century so far removed, as might preserve me from their
improper examinations who know not the requisites of a Poem, nor how much
pleasure they lose (and even the pleasures of Heroic Poesy are not
unprofitable) who take away the liberty of a Poet, and fetter his feet in the
shackles of an Historian: For why should a Poet doubt in Story to mend the
intrigues of Fortune by more delightful conveyences of probable Fiction,
because austere Historians have entered into bond to truth? an obligation which
were in Poets, as foolish and unnecessary as is the bondage of false Martyrs,
who lie in chains for a mistaken opinion: But by this I would imply, that Truth
narrative, and past, is the Idol of Historians, (who worship a dead thing) and
truth operative, and by e^fects continually alive, is the Mistress of Poets,
who has not her existence in matter but in reason.

I was likewise more willing to derive my theme from elder times, as thinking
it no little mark of skilfulnesse to comply with the common Infirmity; for men
(even of the best education) discover their eyes to be weak, when they look
upon the glory of Virtue (which is great actions) and rather endure it at
distance then near; being more apt to believe, and love the renown of
Predecessors, then of Contemporaries, whose deeds excelling theirs in their
own sight, (...) to upbraid them, and are not reverenced as examples of Virtue,
but envyed as the favors of Fortune: But to make great actions credible is the
principal Art of Poets; who, though they avouch the utility of Fictions,
should not (by altering and subliming Story) make use of their Privilege to
the detriment of the Reader: whose incredulity (when things are not represented
in proportion) does much allay the relish of his pity, hope, joy, and other
Passions: For we may descend to compare the deceptions in Poesy to those of
them that profess* dextery of Hand, which resembles Conjuring, and to such we
come not with the intention of Lawyers to examine the evidence of facts, but
are content (if we like the carriage of their feigned motion) to pay for being
well deceived.

As in the choice of time, so of place, I have complied with the weakness of
the generality of men; who think the best objects of their own country so
little to the size of those abroad, as if they were showed them by the wrong
end of a Prospective: for Man (continuing the appetites of his first Childhood,
till he arrive at his second which is more froward) must be quieted with
something that he thinks excellent, which he may call his own; but when he sees
the like in other places (not staying to compare them) wrangles at all he has.
This leads us to observe the craftiness of the Comicks, who are only willing
when they describe humor (and humor is the Drunkenness of a Nation which no
sleep can cure) to lay the Scene in their own country; as knowing we are (like
the Son of Noah) so little distasted to behold each others shame, that we
delight to see even that of a Father: yet when they would set forth greatness
and excellent virtue (which is the Theme of Tragedy) publicly to the people;
they wisely (to avoid the quarrels of neighbourly envy) remove the Scene from
home. And by their example I travaild too; and Italy (which was once the Stage
of the World) I have made the Theater, where I show in either Sex, some
patterns of humane life, that are (perhaps) fit to be followed.

Having told you why I took the actions that should be my Argument, from men of
our own Religion, and given you reasons for the choice of the time and place
designed for those actions; I must next acquaint you with the Schools where
they were bred; not meaning the Schools where they took their Religion, but
Morality; for I know Religion is universally rather inherited then taught: and
the most effectual Schools of Morality, are Courts and Camps: Yet toward the
first, the people are unquiet through envy; and toward the other, through
fear; and always jealous of both for Injustice, which is the natural Scandal
cast upon Authority, and great force. They look upon the outward Glory or Blaze
of Courts, as Wilde-beasts in dark nights stare on their Hunters Torches; but
though the expenses of Courts (whereby they shine) is that consuming glory in
which the people think their liberty is wasted (for wealth is their Liberty and
loved by them even to jealousy (being themselves a courser sort of Princes,
apter to take then to pay) yet Courts (I mean all abstracts of the Multitude;
either by King, or Assemblies) are not the Schools where men are bred to
oppression, but the Temples where some times Oppressors take Sanctuary; a
safety which our reason must allow them. For the ancient laws of Sanctuary
(derived from God) provided chiefly for Actions that proceed^d from necessity;
and who can imagine less then a necessity of oppressing the people, since they
are never willing either to buy their Peace or to pay for War?

Nor are Camps the Schools of wicked Destroyers, more then the Inns of Court
(being the Nursery of Judges) are the Schools of Murderers; for as Judges are
Avengers of private men against private Robbers, so are Armies the Avengers of
the Public against Public Invaders (either Civil or Foreign) and Invaders
are Robbers, though more in Countenance then those of the Highway, because of
their number. Nor is there other difference between Armies, when they move
toward Sieges, or Battle, and Judges moving in their Circuit (during the
danger of extraordinary Malefactors) with the Guards of the County; but that
the latter is a less Army, and of less discipline. If any man can yet doubt
of the necessary use of Armies, let him study that which was anciently called a
Monster, the Multitude (for Wolves are commonly harmless when they are met
alone, but very uncivil in Herds) and he will not find that all his kindred
by Adam are so tame, and gentle, as those Lovers that were bred in Arcadia: or
to reform his opinion, let him ask why (during the utmost age of History)
Cities have been at the charge of defensive Walls; and why Fortification has
been practiced so long, till it is grown an Art?

I may now believe I have usefully taken from Courts and Camps the patterns of
such as will be fit to be imitated by the most necessary Men; and the most
necessary m^n are those who become principal by prerogative of blood (which is
seldom unassisted with education) or by greatness of mind, which, in exact
definition is Virtue. The common Crowd (of whom we are hopeless) we desert;
being rather to be corrected by laws (where Precept is accompanied with
Punishment) then to be taught by Poesy; for few have arrived at the skill of
Orpheus, or at his good fortune, whom we may suppose to have met with
extraordinary Grecian beasts, when so successfully he reclaimed them with his
Harp. Nor is it needful that Heroic Poesy should be levelled to the reach of
Common men; for if the examples it presents prevail upon their Chiefs, the
delight of Imitation (which we hope we have proved to be as effectual to good
as to evil) will rectify by the rules, which those Chiefs establish of their
own lives, the lives of all that behold them; for the example of life, does as
much surpass the force of precept, as Life does exceed Death.

In the choice of these Objects (which are as Sea-marks to direct the dangerous
Voyage of Life) I thought fit to follow the Rule of Coasting Mapps, where the
Shelv's and Rocks are described as well the safe Channel; the care being
equal how to avoid, as to proceed: and the Characters of men (whose passions
are to be eschu'd) I have derived from the Distempers of Love, or Ambition: for
Love and Ambition are too often the raging Fevers of great minds. Yet Ambition
(if the vulgar acception of the word were corrected) would signify no more
then an extraordinary lifting of the feet in the rough ways of Honor, over
the impediments of Fortune; and has a warmt'h (till it be chafed into a
Fever) which is necessary for every virtuous breast: for good men are guilty
of too little appetite to greatness, and it either proceeds from that they
call contentedness (but contentedness when examined does mean something of
Lazynesse as well as moderation) or from some melancholy precept left of the
Cloister; where they would make life (for which the world was only made) more
unpleasant then Death; as if Nature, the Vicegerent of God (who in providing
delightful varieties which virtuous greatness can best possess, or assure
peaceably to others, implicitly commanded the use of them) should in the
necessaries of life (life being her chief business) though in her whole reign
she never committed one error, need the council of Friars; whose solitude
makes them no more fit for such direction, then Prisoners long fette^'d are for
a race.

In saying this, I only awaken such retired men, as evaporate their strength
of mind by close and long thinking; and would every where separate the Soul
from the Body, ere we are Dead, by persuading us (though they were both created
and have been long Companions together) that the preferment of the one must
merely consist in deserting the other; teaching us to court the Grave, as if
during the whole lease of life we were like Moles to live under ground; or as
if long and well Dying were the certain means to Live in Heaven: Yet Reason
(which, though the most profitable Talent God has given us, some Divines would
have Philosophers to bury in the Napkin, and not put it to use) persuades us,
that the painful activenesse of Virtue (for Faith on which some wholly depend
seems but a contemplative boast till the effects of it grow exemplary by
action) will more probably acquire everlasting dignities. And surely if these
severe Masters (who though obscure in Cells, take it ill if their very opinions
rule not all, abroad) did give good men leave to be industrious in getting a
Share of Governing the World, the Multitudes (which are but Tenants to a few
Monarchs) would endure that subjection which God has decreed them, with better
order, and more ease; for the world is only ill governed because the wicked
take more pains to get authority* then the virtuous; for the virtuous are often
preached into retirement; which is to the public as unprofitable as their
sleep; and the erroneousnesse of such lazy rest let Philosophers judge; since
Nature (of whose body man thinks himself the chiefest member) has not any
where, at any time, been respited from action (in her, called motion) by which
she universally preserves and makes Life. Thus much of Ambition which should
have succeeded something I was saying of Love.

Love in the Interpretation of the Envious, is Softness; in the Wicked, good
men suspect it for Lust; and in the Good, some Spiritual men have given it the
name of Charity: And these are but terms to this which seems a more considered
Definition; that indefinite Love is Lust; and Lust when it is determined to
one, is Love; This Definition too but intrudes it self on what I was about to
say, which is, (and spoken with soberness though like a Layman) that Love is
the most acceptable imposition of Nature, the cause and preservation of Life,
and the very healthfulnesse, of the mind, as well as of the body; but Lust (our
raging Fever) is more dangerous in Cities, then the Calenture in Ships.

Now (Sir) I again ask you pardon, for I have again digress'd; my immediate
business being to tell you that the distempers of Love and Ambition are the
only characters I designed to expose as objects of terror: and my purpose was
also to assure you, that I never meant to prostitute Wickedness in the Images
of low and contemptible people, as if I expected the meanest of the multitude
for my Readers (since only the Rabble is seen at common executions) nor
intended to raise iniquity to that height of horror, till it might seem the
fury of something worse then a beast. In order to the first, I believe the
Spartans (who to dete^^^ their children from Drunkenness accustomed their
Slaves to vomit before them) did by such fulsome examples rather teach them to
disdain the Slaves, then to loathe Wine; for men seldom take notice of the
Vice in abject persons, especially where necessity constrains it. And in
observation of the second, I have thought, that those horrid spectacles (when
the latter race of Gladiatours made up the excesses of Roman feasts) did more
induce the Guests to de^est the cruelty of mankind, then increase their courage
by beholding such an impudent scorn of Life.

I have now given you the accomp^ of such provisions as I made for this new
Building; and you may next please (having examined the substance) to take a
view of the form; and observe if I have methodically and with discretion
disposed of the materialls^ which with some curiosity I had collected. I cannot
discern by any help from reading, or learned men, (who have been to me the best
and briefest Indexes of Books) that any Nation has in representment of great
actions (either by Heroicks or Dramaticks) digested Story into so pleasant and
instructive a method as the English by their Drama: and by that regular species
(though narratively and not in Dialogue) I have drawn the body of an Heroic
Poem: In which I did not only observe the Symmetry (proportioning five Books
to five Acts, and Canto's to Scenes, (the Scenes having their number ever
governed by occasion) but all the shadowings, happy strokes, secret graces, and
even the drapery (which together make the second beauty) I have (I hope)
exactly followed: and those compositions of second beauty, I observe in the
Drama to be the under-walks, interwea^ing, or correspondence of lesser-design
in Scenes, not the great motion of the main plot, and coherence of the Acts.

The first Act is the general preparative, by rendering the chiefest characters
of persons, and ending with something that looks like an obscure promise of
design. The second begins with an introducement of new persons, so finishes all
the characters, and ends with some little performance of that design which was
promised at the parting of the first Act. The third makes a visible
correspondence in the Under-walks (or lesser intrigues of persons; and ends
with an ample turn of the main design, and expectation of a new. The fourth
(ever having occasion to be the longest) gives a notorious turn to all the
Underwalks, and a countre-turn to that main design which changed in the Third.
The fifth begins with an entire diversion of the main, and dependent Plots;
then makes the general correspondence of the persons more discernable, and
ends with an easy untying of those particular knots, which made a contexture
of the whole; leaving such satisfaction of probabilities with the Spectatour,
as may persuade him that neither Fortune in the fate of the Persons, nor the
Writer in the Representment, have been unnatural or exorbitant. To these
Meander's of the English Stage I have cut out the walks of my Poem; which in
this description may seem intricate and tedious; but will I hope (when men take
pains to visit what they have h^ard described) appear to them as pleasant as a
summer passage on a crooked River, where going about, and turning back, is as
delightful as the delays of parting Lovers.

In placing the Argument (as a Proem) before every Canto, I have not wholly
followed the example of the Moderns; but averted it from that purpose to which
I found it frequently used: for it has been intended by others, as the
contents of the Chapter, or as a Bill of Fare at a Venetian Feast; which is not
brought before the meat to raise an expectation, but to satisfy the longing
curiosity of the Guests. And that which I have called my Argument, is only
meant as an assistance to the Readers memory, by containing brief hints, such,
as if all the Arguments were successively read, would make him easily remember
the mutual dependencies of the general design; yet each rather mentions every
person acting, then their actions: But he is very unskilful that by Narratives
before an Historical Poem prevents expectation; for so he comes to have little
success over the Reader (whom the Writer should surprise, and as it were keep
prisoner for a time) as he has on his Enemies, who commanding a party out to
take them (and commonly Readers are justly Enemies to Writers) imparts openly
the design ere he begins the action: Or he may be said to be as unluckily
officious, as he that leads a wooing to a Mistress, one that already has
newly enjoyed her.

I shall say a little, why I have chosen my interwoven Stanza of ^our, though I
am not obliged to excuse the choice; for numbers in Verse must, like distinct
kinds of Music, be exposed to the uncertain and different taste of several
Ears. Yet I may declare that I believed it would be more pleasant to the
Reader, in a Work of Length, to give this respite or pause, between every
Stanza (having endeavored that each should contain a period) then to run him
out of breath with continued Couplets. Nor does alternate Rhyme by any
lowliness of cadence make the sound less Heroic, but rather adapt it to a
plain and stately composing of Music; and the brevity of the Stanza renders it
less subtle to the Composer, and more easy to the Singer; which in stylo
recitativo, when the Story is long, is chiefly requisite. And this was indeed
(if I shall not betray vanity in my Confession) the reason that prevailed most
toward my choice of this Stanza, and my division of the main work into
Canto's, every Canto including a sufficient accomplishment of some worthy
design or action; for I had so much heat (which you, Sir, may call pride, since
pride may be allowed in Pegasus, if it be a praise to other Horses) as to
presume they might (like the Works of Homer ere they were joined together and
made a Volume by the Athenian King) be sung at Village-feasts; though not to
Monarchs after Victory, nor to Armies before Battle. For so (as an inspiration
of glory into the one, and of valor into the other) did Homer's spirit, long
after his body's rest, wander in Music about Greece.

Thus you have the Model of what I have already built, or shall hereafter join
to the same frame. If I be accused of Innovation, or to have transgressed
against the method of the Ancients; I shall think my self secure in believing,
that a Poet who has wrought with his own Instruments at a new design, is no
more answerable for disobedience to Predecessors, then Lawmakers are liable
to those old Laws which themselves have repealed.

Having described the outward frame, the large rooms within, the lesser
conveyances, and now the furniture; it were orderly to let you examine the
matter of which that furniture is made: But though every owner who has the
Vanity to show his ornaments or hangings, must endure the curiosity, and
censure of him that beholds them; yet I shall not give you the trouble of
inquiring what is, but tell you of what I designed their substance, which is
Wit: And Wit is the laborious, and the lucky resultances of thought, having
toward its excellence (as we say of the strokes of Painting) as well a
happiness, as care. It is a Web consisting of the sub^ilest threads, and like
that of the Spider^ is considerately woven out of our selves; for a Spider may
be said to consider, not only respecting his solemness and taci^e posture
(like a grave scout in ambush for his Enemy) but because all things done, are
either from consideration o^ chance; and the works of chance ar^
accomplishments of an instant, having commonly a dissimilitude; but he^ are the
works of time, and have their contextures alike.

Wit is not only the luck and labor, but also the dexterity of the thought;
rounding the world like the Sun with unimaginable motion; an^ bringing swiftly
home to the memo^ universal surveyes. It is the Soul Powder, which when
suppressed (as for ^idden from flying upward) blows (...) the restraint; and
loses all force in farther ascension toward Heaven (the region of God) and
yet by nature is much less able to make any inquisition downward toward Hell,
the Cell of the Devil; but breaks through all about it (as far as the utmost
it can reach) removes, uncovers, makes way for Light, where darkness was
enclosed, till great bodies are more examinable by being scattered into
parcels; and till all that find its strength (but most of mankind are strangers
to Wit, as Indians are to Powder) worship it for the effects, as derived from
the Deity. It is in Divines Humility, Exemplarinesse, and Moderation: In
Statesmen, Gravity, Vigilance, Benign Complacency, Secrecy, Patience, and
Dispatch. In Leaders of Armies, Valor, Painfulnesse, Temperance, Bounty,
Dexterity in Punishing and Rewarding, and a sacred Certitude of Promise: It is
in Poets a full comprehension of all recited in all these; and an ability to
bring those comprehensions into action, when they shall so far forget the
true measure of what is of greatest consequence to humanity^ (which are things
righteous, pleasant^ and useful) as to think the delights o^ greatness equal
to that of Poesy; or the Chiefs of any Profession mo^^ necessary to the World
then excelle^^ Poets. Lastly, though Wit be not the envy of ignorant Men, it is
often o^ evil Statesmen, and of all such imperfect great spirits, as have it in
a less^ degree then Poets: for though no man envies the excellence of that
which^^ no proportion he ever tasted (as m^^ cannot be said to envy the
condition (...) Angels) yet we may say the devil envi^ the Supremacy of God,
because he w^^ in some degree partaker of his Glory.

That which is not, yet is accounte^ Wit, I will but slightly remember which
seems very incident to impe^^fect youth and sickly age; Young me (as if they
were not quite delivere from Childhood whose first exerci^^ is Language)
imagine it consists (...) the Music of words, and believe they are made wise
by refining their speech above the vulgar Dialect: which is a mistake almost as
great as that of the people, who think Orators (which is a title that crowns
at riper years those that have practiced the dexterity of tongue) the ablest
men; who are indeed so much more unapt for governing, as they are more fit for
Sedition: and it may be said of them as of the Witches of Norway, who can sell
a Storm for a Doller, which for ten thousand they cannot allay. From the esteem
of speaking they proceed to the admiration of what are commonly called
Conceits, things that sound like the knacks or toys of ordinary
Epigrammatists: and from thence, after more conversation and variety of
objects, grow up to some force of Fancy; Yet even then like young Hawks they
stray and fly far off; using their liberty as if they would never return to
the Lure; and often go at check ere they can make a steady view, and know their
game.

Old men, that have forgot their first Childhood, and are returning to their
second, think it lies in Agnominations, and in a kind of an alike tinkling of
words; or else in a grave telling of wonderful things, or in comparing of
times without a discovered partiality; which they perform so ill by favoring
the past, that, as it is observed, if the bodies of men should grow less,
though but an unmeasurable proportion in seven years; Yet reckoning from the
Flood, they would not remain in the stature of Frogs: so if States and
particular persons had impaired in Government, and increased in wickedness,
proportionably to what* old Men affirm they have done, from their own infancy
to their age; all public Policy had been long since Con^usion, and the
congregated world would not su^fice now to people a village.

The last thing they suppose to be Wit, is their bitter Morals, when they
almost declare themselves Enemies to Youth and Beauty; by which Severity they
seem cruel as Herod when he surprised the sleeping Children of Bethleem: For
Youth is so far from wanting Enemies, that it is mortally its own; so
unpracticed, that it is every where cozened more then a Stranger among Jews;
and has an infirmity of sight more hurtful then Blindness to Blind men; for
though it cannot choose the way, it scorns to be led. And Beauty, though many
call themselves her Friends, has few but such as are false to her: Though the
World sets her in a Throne, yet all about her (even her gravest Councillors)
are Traitors, though not in conspiracy, yet in their distinct designs; and to
make her certain not only of distress but ruin, she is ever pursued by her
most cruel enemy, the great Destroyer, Time. But I will proceed no farther upon
Old men, nor in recording mistakes; lest finding so many more, then there be
Verities, we might believe we walk in as great obscurity as the Egyptians when
Darkness was their Plague. Nor will I presume to call the matter of which the
Ornaments or Substantial parts of this Poem are composed, Wit; but only tell
you my endeavor was, in bringing Truth (too often absent) home to men's
bosoms, to lead her through unfrequented and new ways, and from the most
remote Shades; by representing Nature though not in an affected, yet in an
unusual dress.

It Is now fit, after I have given you so long a survey of the Building, to
render you some account of the Builder; that you may know by what time, pains,
and assistance I have already proceeded, or may hereafter finish my work: and
in this I shall take occasion to accuse, and condemn, as Papers unworthy of
light, all those hasty digestions of thought which were published in my Youth;
a sentence not pronounced out of melancholy rigor, but from a cheerful
obedience to the just authority of experience: For that grave mistress of the
World, Experience (in whose profitable School those before the Flood stayed
long, but we like wanton Children come thither late, yet too soon are called
out of it, and fetched home by Death) has taught me, that the engendrings of
unripe age become abortive, and deformed; and that after obteining more years,
those must needs prophecy with ill success, who make use of their Visions in
Wine; That when the ancient Poets were valued as Prophets, they were long and
painful in watching the correspondence of Causes, ere they presumed to
foretell Effects: and that it is a high presumption to entertein a Nation (who
are a Poets standing Guests, and require Monarchical respect) with hasty
provisions; as if a Poet might imitate the familiar dispatch of Faulconers,
mount his Pegasus, unhood his Muse, and with a few flights, boast he has
provided a feast for a Prince. Such posting upon Pegasus I have long since
forborne; and during my journey in this Work have moved with a flow place; that
I might make my surveyes as one that traveled not to bring home the names, but
the proportion and nature of things: and in this I am made wise by two great
examples; for the friends of Virgil acknowledge he was many years in doing
honor to AEneas (still contracting at night into a closer force the abundance
of his morning strengths) and Statius rather seems to boast then blush, when he
confesses he was twice Seven years in renowning the War between Argos and
Thebes.

Next to the usefulness of Time (which here implies ripe Age) I believed pains
most requisite to this undertaking: for though painfulnesse in Poets (according
to the usual negligence of our Nation in examining, and their diligence to
censure) seems always to discover a want of natural force, and is traduced,
as if Poesy concerned the world no more then Dancing; whose only grace is the
quickness and facility of motion; and whose perfection is not of such public
consequence, that any man can merit much by attaining it with long labor: yet
let them consider, and they will find (nor can I stay long ere I convince them
in the important use of Poesy) the natural force of a Poet more apparent, by
but confessing that great forces ask great labor in managing, then by an
arrogrant braving the world, when he enters the field with his undisciplined
first thoughts: For a wise Poet, like a wise General, will not show his
strengths till they are in exact government and order; which are not the
postures of chance, but proceed from Vigilance and Labor.

Yet to such painful Poets some upbraid the want of extemporary fury, or
rather Inspiration; a dangerous word, which many have of late successfully
used; and Inspiration is a spiritual Fit, derived from the ancient Ethnic
Poets, who then, as they were Priests, were Statesmen too, and probably loved
Dominion; and as their well dissembling of inspiration begot them reverence
then, equal to that which was paid to Laws; so these who now profess the
same fury, may perhaps by such authentic example pretend authority over the
people; It being not unreasonable to imagine, they rather imitate the Greek
Poets then the Hebrew Prophets, since the later were inspired for the use of
others; and these, like the former, prophecy for themselves. But though the
ancient Poets are excused, as knowing the weak constitution of those Deities
from whom they took their Priesthood; and the frequent necessity of dissembling
for the ease of government; yet these (who also from the chief to the meanest
are Statesmen and Priests, but have not the luck to be Poets) should not
assume such saucy familiarity with a true God.

From the time and labor required to my Poem, let me proceed to my Assistants;
by which I shall not so much attest my own weakness, as discover the
difficulties and greatness of such a work. For when Solomon made use of his
Neighbors toward his building, he lost no reputation, nor by demanding those
aids was thought a lesser Prince; but rather published his Wisdom, in rightly
understanding the vast extent of his enterprise: who likewise with as much
glory made use of Fellers of wood, and Hewers of Stone, as of learned
Architects: Nor have I refrained to be obliged to men of any science, as well
mechanical as liberal: Nor when Memory (from that various and plentiful
stock, with which all observers are furnished that have had diversity of life)
presented me by chance with any figure, did I lay it a side as useless,
because at that instant I was not skillful to manage it artfully; but I have
staid and recorded such objects, till by consulting with right Masters I have
disposed of them without mistake; It being no more ^hame to get Learning at
that very time, and from the same Text; when, and by which, we instruct others;
then for a forward Scout, discovering the Enemy, to save his own life at a
Pass, where he then teacheas his Party to escape.

In remembering mine own helps, I have cons^dered those which others in the same
necessity have taken; and find that Writers (contrary to my inclination) are
apter to be beholding to Books then to men; not only as the first are more in
their possession (being more con^tant Companions then dearest friends) but
because they commonly make such use of treasure found in Books, as of other
treasure belonging to the Dead and hidden under ground; for they dispose of
both with great secrecy, defacing the shape or images of the one, as much as of
the other; through fear of having the Original of their stealth, or abundance
discovered. And the next cause why Writers are more in Libraries then in
Company, is, that Books are easily opened, and learned men are usually shut up
by a froward or envious humor of retention; or else unfold themselves, so as
we may read more of their weakness and vanity then Wisdom; imitating the
Holiday custom in great cities, where the shops of Chaundry and slight wares
are familiarly open, but those of solid and staple merchandise are proudly
locked up.

Nor indeed can it be expected that all great Doctors are of so benign a
nature, as to take pains in gaining treasure (of which Knowledge is the
greatest) with intent to enrich others so easily, as if they stood every where
with their Pockets spread, and ready to be picked: Nor can we read of any
Father, who so far and secretly adopted his Son to a Book of his own
writing, as that his Son might be thought Author of that written Wit, as much
as his Father was Author of him: Nor of any Husband that to his darling Wife
would so far surrender his Wisdom, as that in public, he could endure to let
her use his Dictates, as if she would have others think her wiser then himself.
By this remembrance of that usual parcimony in owners of Wit, toward such as
would make use of their plenty; I lament the fortune of others, and may wish
the Reader to congratulate mine; For I have found Friends as ready as Books, to
regulate my conceptions, or make them more correct, easy, and apparent. But
though I am become so wise, by knowing my self, as to believe the thoughts of
diverse transcend the best which I have written; yet I have admitted from no man
any change of my Design, nor very seldom of my Sense; For I resolved to have
this Poem subsist, and continue throughout, with the same Complexion and
Spirit; though it appear but like a plain family, of a neighbourly alliance,
who marry into the same moderate quality and garb, and are fearful of
introducing strangers of greater rank, lest the shining presence of such,
might seem to upbraid, and put all about them out of countenance.

And now, Sir, that the Reader may (whom Writers are fain to court, draw in,
and keep with artifice, so shy men grow of Books) believe me worthy of him, I
cannot forbear to thank you in public, for examining, correcting, and allowing
this Poem in parcels ere it arrived at the contexture: by which you have
performed the just degrees of proceeding with Poets; who, during the gayetie
and wantonness of the Muse, are but as children to Philosophers (though of
some Giant race) whose first thoughts (wild, and roaming far off) must be
brought home, watched, and interrogated, and after they are made more regular,
be encouraged and praised for doing well, that they may delight in aiming at
perfection. By such a Method the Muse is taught to become Master of her own and
others strength: and who is he so learned (how proud soever with being
cherished in the bosom of Fame) that can hope, (when through the several
ways of Science, he seeks Nature in her hidden walks) to make his Journey
short, unless he call you to be his Guide? and who so guided can suspect his
safety, even when he travels through the Enemy's country? For such is the vast
field of Learning, where the learned (though not numerous enough to be an Army)
lie as small parties, maliciously in Ambush, to destroy all new Men that look
into their Quarters. And from such, you, and those you lead, are secure;
because you move not by common Maps but have painfully made your own Prospect;
and travel now like the Sun, not to inform your self, but enlighten the World.

And likewise, when by the strict survey and Government that has been had over
this Po^m, I shall think to govern the Reader (who, though he be noble, may
perhaps judge of supreme Power like a very Commoner, and rather approve
Authority, when it is in many, then in one) I must acquaint him, that you had
not alone the trouble of establishing and destroying; but enjoyed your
intervalls and ease by two Colleagues; two that are worthy to follow you into
the Closets of Princes; if the knowledge of Men past, (of whom Books are the
remaining minds) or of the present (of whom Conversation is the useful and
lawful Spy) may make up such greatness, as is fit for great Courts: or if the
rays that proceed from the Poetic Planet be not a little too strong for the
sight of modern Monarchs who now are too seldom taught in their youth, like
Eaglets to fortify their eyes by often soaring near the Sun. And though this
be here but my testimony, it is too late for any of you to disclaim it; for
since you have made it valid by giving yours of GONDIBERT under your hands, you
must be content to be used by me, as Princes are by their preferred Subjects,
who in the very act of taking Honor, return it to the giver; as benefits
received by the Creature manifest the power, and redound to the glory of the
Creator.

I am now, Sir, (to your great comfort, that have been thus ill and long
diverted) arrived at my last consideration, which is, to satisfy those who may
inquire why I have taken so much pains to become an Author? or why any man
stays so long sweating at the fire of Invention, to dress the food of the
Mind, when Readers have so imperfect stomachs, as they either devour Books with
over hasty Digestion, or grow to loathe them from a Surfeit? And why I more
especially made my task an Heroic Poem? I shall involve the two first
Questions in one; as submitting to be concerned amongst the generality of
Writers; whose Enemies being many, and now mine, we must join forces to oppose
them.

Men are chiefly provoked to the toil of compiling Books, by love of Fame, and
often by officiousness of Conscience, but seldom with expectation of Riches:
for those that spend time in writing to instruct others, may find leisure to
inform themselves, how mean the provisions are which busy and studious minds
can make for their own sedentary bodies: And Learned men (to whom the rest of
the world are but Infants) have the same foolish affection in nourishing others
minds, as Pelicans in feeding their young; which is, at the expense of the very
subsistence of Life. It Is then apparent they proceed by the instigation of Fame
or Conscience; and I believe many are persuaded by the first (of which I am
One) and some are commanded by the second. Nor is the desire of Fame so vain as
diverse have rigidly imagined; Fame being (when belonging to the Living) that
which is more gravely called, a steady and necessary reputation; and without
it, hereditary Power, or acquired greatness can never quietly govern the
World. It Is of the Dead a musical glory, in which God, the author of
excellent goodness, vouchsafes to take a continual share; For the remembered
virtues of great men are chiefly such of his works (mentioned by King David) as
perpetually praise him: and the good fame of the Dead prevails by example much
more then the reputation of the Living, because the later is always suspected
by our Envy, but the other is cheerfully allowed and religiously admired: for
Admiration (whose Eyes are ever weak) stands still, and at gaze upon great
things acted far off; but when they are near, walks slightly away as from
familiar objects. Fame is to our Sons a solid Inheritance, and not unusefull
to remote Posterity; and to our Reason, it is the first, though but a little
taste, of Eternity.

Those that write by the command of Conscience (thinking themselves able to
instruct others, and consequently obliged to it) grow commonly the most
voluminous; because the pressures of Conscience are so incessant, that she is
never satisfied with doing enough: for such as be newly made the captives of
God (many appearing so to themselves, when they first begin to wear the fetters
of Conscience) are like common Slaves, when newly taken; who, terrified with a
fancy of the severity of absolute Masters, abuse their diligence out of fear,
and do ill, rather then appear idle. And this may be the cause why Libraries
are more then double-lin'd with Spiritual Books or Tracts of Morality; the
later being the Spiritual Counsels of Laymen; and the newest of such great
volumes (being usually but transcriptions or translations) differ so much from
the Ancients, as later days from those of old, which difference is no more
then an alteration of names, by removing the Ethnicks to make way for the
Sa^nts. These are the effects of their labors, who are provoked to become
Authors, merely out of Conscience; and Conscience we may again aver to be
often so unskilful and timorous, that it seldom gives a wise and steady
account of God; but grows jealous of him, as of an Adversary, and is after
melancholy visions like a fearful Scout, after he has ill surveyed the Enemy,
who then makes incong^uous, long, and terrible Tales.

Having confessed that the desire of Fame made me a Writer; I must declare, why
in my riper age I chose to gain it more especially by an Heroical Poem; and
the Heroic being by most allowed to be the most beautiful of Poems, I shall
not need to decide the quarrels of Poets about the Degrees of Excellence in
Poesy: but it is not amiss ere I avow the usefulness of the science in
general (which was the cause of my undertaking) to remember the value it had
from the greatest and most worthy spirits in all Ages: For I will not abstain
(though it may give me the reputation but of common reading) to mention, that
Pisistratus, (though a Tyrant) lived with the Praise and died with the Blessing
of all Greece, for gathering the scattered limbs of Homer's Works into a Body;
and that Great Alexander, by publicly conversing with it, attained the
universal opinion of wit; the fame of such inward forces conducing as much to
his Conquests, as his Armies abroad: That the Athenian prisoners were thought
worthy of life and liberty for singing the Tragedies of Euripides: That Thebes
was saved from destruction by the Victors reverence to the memory of Pindar:
That the elder Scipio (who governed all the Civil world) lay continually in the
bosom of E^nius: That the great Numanti^ and Laelius (no less renowned) were
openly proud when the Romans believed they assisted Terence in his Comedies:
That Augustus (to whom the mysteries of universal Empire were more familiar
then domestic Dominion to Modern Kings) made Virgil the partner of his joys,
and would have divided his business with Horace: and that Lucan was the fear
and envy of Nero. If we approach nearer our own times, we may add the
triumphall Entry which the Papacy gave to Petrarch; and how much Tasso is still
the glory and delight of Italy.

But as in this hasty Muster of Poet^ and listing their confederates, I shall
by omitting many, deprive them of that pay which is due from Fame; so I may now
by the opinion of some Divines (whom notwithstanding I will reverence in all
their distinct habits and fashions of the mind) ^e held partial and too bold,
by adding to the first number (though I range them upon holy ground and aside)
Moses, David, and Solomon, for their Songs, Psalms, and Anthemes: the second
being the acknowledged Favorite of God, whom he had gained by excellent
Praises in sacred Poesy. And I fear (since Poesy is the clearest light by
which they find the soul who seek it) that Poets have in their fluent kindness
diverted from the right use, and spent too much of that spiritual talent in
the honor of mortal Princes: for divine Praise (when in the high perfection,
as in Poets, and only in them) is so much the uttermost and whole of Religious
worship, that all other parts of Devotion serve but to make it up. Gondibert
lib. 2. Canto. 6. 89.
Praise, is Devotion fit for mighty Minds;
The differing World's agreeing Sacrifice;
Where Heaven divided Faiths united finds:
But Prayer in various discord upward flies.
90.
For Prayer the Ocean is, where diversely
Men steer their course, each to a several Coast;
Where all our Interests so discordant be,
That half beg winds by which the rest are lost.
91.
By Penitence when We our selves for sake,
It Is but in wise design on pileous Heaven;
In Praise We nobly give what God may take,
And are without a Beggars blus^ forgiven.
92.
Its utmost force, like Powder's, is unknown;
And though weak Kings excess of Praise may fear,
Yet when it is here, like Powder dangerous grown,
Heaven's Vault receives what would The Palace tear.


After this contemplation, how acceptable the voice of Poesy has been to God,
we may (by descending from Heaven to Earth) consider how useful it is to Men;
and among Men, Divines are the chief, because ordained to temper the rage of
humane power by spiritual menaces, as by sudden and strange threatenings,
madness is frighted into reason; and they are ^ent hither as Liegers from God,
to conserve in steadfast motion the slippery joints of Government; and to
persuade an amity in divided Nations: therefore to Divines I first address my
self; and presume to ask them, why, ever since their Dominion was first
allowed, at the great change of Religions, (though ours, more then any,
inculcates obedience, as an easy Medicine to cool the impatient and raging
World into a quiet rest) mankind has been more unruly then before? it being
visible that Empire decreased with the increase of Christianity; and that one
weak Prince did anciently su^fice to govern many strong Nations: but now one
little Province is too hard for their own wise King: and a small Republic has
seventy years maintein'd their revolt to the disquiet of many Monarchs. Or if
Divines reply, we cannot expect the good effects of their o^fice, because their
spiritual Dominion is not allowed as absolute; then it may be asked them more
severely, why it is not allowed? for wherever there has been great degrees of
power (which has been often, and long in the Church) it discovers (though
worldly vicissitude be objected as an excuse) that the Mannagers of such power,
since they endeavored not to enlarge it, believed the increase unrighteous; or
were in acting, or contriving that endeavor, either negligent or weak: For
Power like the hasty Vine, climbs up apace to the Supporter; but if not
skilfully attended and dr^ss'd, instead of spreading, and bearing fruit, grows
high, and naked; and then (like empty title) being soon useless to others,
becomes neglected, and unable to support it self.

But if Divines have failed in governing Princes (that is, of being entirely
believed by them) yet they might obliquely have ruled them, in ruling the
People; by whom of late, Princes have been governed; and they might probably
rule the People, because the Heads of the Church (where ever Christianity is
preached) are Te^ra^chs of Time; of which they command the fourth Division; for
to no less the Sabbaths, and Days of Saints amount; and during those days of
spiritual triumph, Pulpits are Thrones; and the people obliged to open their
Ears, and let in the ordinances and commands of Preachers; who likewise are not
without some little Regency throughout the rest of the Year; for then they may
converse with the Laity, from whom they have commonly such respect (and respect
soon opens the door to persuasion) as shows their Congregations not deaf in
those holy seasons, when Speaking predominates.

But notwithstanding these advantages, the Pulpit has little prevailed; for
the World is in all Regions reversed, or shaken by disobedience; an Engine with
which the great Angels (for such were the Devils, and had faculties much more
sublimed then Men) believed they could disorder Heaven. And it is not want of
capacity in the lower Auditory that makes Doctrine so unsuccessfull; for the
People are not simple, since the Gentry (even of strongest Education) lack
sufficient defense against them, and are hourly surprised in (their common
Ambushes) their Shops: For on sacred Days they walk gravely and sadly from
Temples, as if they had newly buried their sinful Fathers; at night sleep as
if they never needed forgiveness; and rise with the next Sun, to lie in wait
for the Noble, and the Studious. And though these quiet Cousners are amongst
the People, esteemed their steady Men; yet they honor the Courage, and more
active parts of such disobedient Spirits, as disdaining thus tamely to deceive,
attempt bravely to rob the State; and the State they believe (though the Helm
were held by Apostles) would always consist of such Arch-robbers, as who ever
strips them, but waves the tedious satisfaction which the Lazy expect from
Laws, and comes a shorter way to his own.

Thus unapt for obedience (in the condition of Beasts whose appetite is
Liberty, and their Liberty a license of Lust) the People have often been, since
a long and notorious power has continued with Divines; whom though with
reverence we accuse for mistaken Lenity; yet are we not so cruel to expect
they should behave themselves to sinners like fierce Phineas, or preach with
their Swords drawn, to kill all they cannot persuade: But our meaning is, to
show how much their Christian meekness has deceived them in taming this wild
Monster, the People; and a little to rebuke them for neglecting the assistance
of Poets; and for upbraiding the Ethnicks, because the Poets managed their
Religion; as if Religion could walk more prosperously abroad then when Morality
(respectfully, and bare-headed as her Usher) prepares the way: it being no less
true that during the Dominion of Poesy, a willing and peaceful obedience to
Superiors becalmed the World; then that obedience like the Marriage yoke, is a
restraint more needful and advantageous then liberty; and has the same reward
of pleasant quietness, which is anciently had, when Adam, till his
disobedience, enjoyed Paradise. Such are the effects of sacred Poesy which
charm's the People with harmonious precepts; and whose aid Divines should not
disdain, since their Lord (the Savior of the World) vouchsafed to deliver his
Doctrine in Parabolicall Fictions.

Those that be of next importance are Leaders of Armies; and such I measure not
by the suffrages of the People, who give them respect as Indians worship the
evil Spirit, rather for fear of harm, then for affection; but esteem them as
the painful Protectours, and enlargers of Empire by whom it actively moves;
and such active motion of Empire is as necessary as the motion of the Sea where
all things would putrify, and infect one an other, if the Element were quiet;
so is it with men's minds on shore, when that Element of greatness and honor,
Empire, stands still; of which the largeness is likewise as needful, as the
vastness of the Sea; For God ordained not huge Empire as proportionable to the
Bodies, but to the Minds of Men; and the Minds of Men are most monstrous, and
require more space for agitation and the hunting of others, then the Bodies of
Whales: But he that believes men such moderate Sheep as that many are
peacefully contained in a narrow Fold, may be better informed in America; where
little Kings never enjoy a harml^sse neighborhood, unless protected
defensively amongst themselves, by an Emperor that has wide possessions, and
prioritie over them (as in some few places) but when restrained in narrow
dominion, where no body commands and hinders their nature, they quarrel like
Cocks in a Pit; and the Sun in a days travel there, ^ees more battles (but
not of consequence, because their Kings though many, are little) then in Europe
in a Year.

To Leaders of Armies, as to very necessary Men (whose o^fice requires the
uttermost aids of art, and Nature, and rescues the sword of Justice, when it is
wrested from supreme Power by Commotion) I am now addressed; and must put them
in mind (though not upbraidingly) how much their Mighty Predecessors were
anciently obliged to Poets; whose Songs (recording the praises of Conduct and
Valor) were esteemed the chiefest rewards of Victory; And since Nature has
made us prone to Imitation (by which we equal the best or the worst) how much
those Images of Action prevail upon our minds, which are delightfully drawn by
Poets: For the greatest of the Grecian Captains have confessed, that their
Counsels have been made wise, and their Courages warm, by Homer: and since
Praise is a Pleasure which God has invited, and with which he often vouchsafed
to be pleased when it was sent him by his own Poet; why is it not lawful for
virtuous men to be cherished, and magnified with hearing their vigilance,
Valor, and good fortune (the latter being more the immediate gift of Heaven,
because the effect of an unknown cause) commended, and made eternal in Poesy?
But perhaps the art of praising Armies into great, and instant action, by
singing their former deeds (an Art with which the Ancients made Empire so
large) is too subtle for Modern Leaders; who as they cannot reach the heighths
of Poesy, must be content with a narrow space of Dominion: and narrow Dominion
breeds evil, peevish, and vexatious minds, and a national self-opinion, like
simple Jewish arrogance; and the Jews were extraordinary proud in a very little
Country: For men in contracted governments are but a kind of Prisoners; and
Prisoners by long restraint grow wicked, malicious to all abroad, and foolish
esteemers of themselves; as if they had wrong in not enjoying every thing which
they can only see out of Windows.

Our last application is to Statesmen; and Makers of Laws; who may be
reasonably reduced to one; since the second differ no more from the first, then
Judges (the Copies of Lawmakers) differ from their Originals: for Judges, like
all bold Interpteters, by often altering the Text, make it quite new; and
Statesmen (who differ not from Lawmakers in the act, but in the manner of
doing) make new Laws presumptuously without the consent of the People; but
Legislators more civilly seem to whistle to the Beast, and stroke him into the
Yoke: and in the Yoke of State, the People (with too much pampering) grow soon
unruly and draw awry; Yet Statesmen and Judges (whose business is governing,
and the thing to be governed is the People) have amongst us (we being more
proud and mistaken then any other famous Nation) looked gravely upon Poetry,
and with a negligence that betrayed a Northerly Ignorance; as if they believed
they could perform their work without it. But Poets (who with wise diligence
study the People, and have in all ages, by an insensible influence governed
their manners) may justly smile when they perceive that Divines, Leaders of
Armies, Statesmen and Judges, think Religion, the Sword, or (which is
unwritten Law, and a secret confederacy of Chiefs) Policy, or Law (which is
written, but seldom rightly read) can give, without the help of the Muses, a
long and quiet satisfaction in government: For Religion is to the wicked and
faithless (who are many) a jurisdiction against which they readily rebel:
because it rules severely, yet promises no worldly recompense for obedience;
obedience being by every humane power invited with assurances of vi^ible
advantage. The Good (who are but few) need not the power of Religion to make
them better, the power of Religion proceeding from her threatenings, which
though mean Weapons, are fitly used, since she has none but base Enemies. We
may observe too, that all Virtuous men are so taken up with the rewards of
Heaven, that they live as if out of the World; and no government receives
assistance from any man merely as he is good; but as that goodness is active
in temporal things.

The Sword is in the hand of Justice no guard to Government, but then when
Justice has an Army for her own defense; and Armies, if they were not
pervertible by Faction, yet are to Commonwealths like Kings Physicians to poor
Patients; who buy the cure of their disordered bodies at so high a rate, that
they may be said to change their Sickness for Famine. Policy (I mean of the
Living, not of the Dead; the one being the last rules or designs governing the
Instant; the other, those Laws that began Empire) is as mortal as Statesmen
themselves; whose incessant labor make that Hectic Fever of the mind, which
insensibly dispatches the body: and when we trace Statesmen through all the
Histories of Courts, we find their Inventions so unnecessary to those that
succed at the Helm, or so much envied as they scarce last in authority till the
Inventours are buried: and change of Designs in Statesmen (their designs being
the Weapons by which States are defended) grows as destructive to Government,
as a continual change of various Weapons is to Armies; which must receive with
ruin any sudden assault, when want of practice makes unactivenesse. We cannot
urge that the ambition of Statesmen (who are obnoxious to the People) does
much disorder Government; because the peoples anger, by a perpetual coming in
of new Oppressors is so diverted in considering those whom their Eyes but
lately left, as they have not time enough to rise for the Public: and evil
successors to Power are in the troubled Stream of State like succeding Tides
in Rivers, where the mud of the former is hidden by the filth of the last.

Laws, if very ancient, grow as doubtful and difficult as Letters on buried
Marble, which only Antiquaries read; but if not Old, they want that reverence
which is therefore paid to the virtues of Ancestors, because their crimes come
not to our remembrance; and yet great Men must be long dead whose ills are
forgotten. If Laws be New, they must be made either by very Angels, or by Men
that have some vices; and those being seen, make their Virtues suspected; for
the People no more esteem able men, whose defects they know, (though but
errors incident to Humanity) then an Enemy values a strong Army having
experience of their Errors. And new Laws are held but the projects of
necessitous Power, new Nets spread to entangle us; the Old being accounted too
many, since most are believed to be made for Forfeitures: and such letting of
blood (though intended by Lawmakers for our health) is to the people always
out of Season: for those that love life with too much Passion (and Money is the
life-bloud of the People) ever fear a Consumption. But, be Lawmakers as able
as Nature or Experience (which is the best Art) can make them; yet, though I
will not yield the Wicked to be wiser then the Virtuous, I may say, offenses
are too hard for the Laws, as some Beasts are too wily for their Hunters; and
that Vice overgrows Virtue, as much as Weeds grow faster then medicinable
Herbs: or rather that Sin, like the fruitful slime of Nilus, does increase
into so many various shapes of Serpents (whose walks and retreats are winding
and unknown) that even Justice (the painful pursuer of Mischief) is become
weary and amazed.

After these Meditations, me thinks Government resembles a Ship, where though
Divines, Leaders of Armies, Statesmen, and Judges are the trusted Pilots; yet
it moves by the means of Winds, as uncertain as the breath of Opinion; and is
laden wIth the People; a Freight much looser and more dangerous then any other
living stowage; being as troublosome in fair weather, as Horses in a Storm. And
how can these Pilots steddily maintain their Course to the Land of Peace and
Plenty, since they are often divided at the Helm? For Divines (when they
consider great Chiefs) suppose Armies to be sent from God for a temporary
Plague, not for continual Jurisdiction; and that Gods extreme punishments (of
which, Armies be the most violent) are ordained to have no more lastingnesse
then the extremes in Nature. They think (when they consider Statesmen) Policy
has nothing of the Dove, and being all Serpent, is more dangerous, then the
dangers it pretends to prevent: and that out-witting (by falsehood and
corruption) adverse States, or the People (though the people be often the
greater enemy and more perilsome being nearest) is but giving reputation to
Sin, and that to maintain the Public by Politic evils, is a base
prostitution of Religion, and the prostitution of Religion is that unpardonable
whoredom which so much angered the Prophets. They think Law nothing but the
Bible forcibly usurped by covetous Lawyers, and disguised in a Paraphrase more
obscure then the Text; and that it is only want of just reverence to Religion
which does expose us to the charges and vexations of Law.

The Leaders of Armies, accuse Divines for unwisely raising the War of the
World by opposite Doctrine, and for being more indiscreet in thinking to
appease it by persuasion; forgetting that the dispatchfull ending of War is
blows; and that the natural region for Disputes, when Nations are engaged
(though by Religion) is the Field of Battle, not Schools and Academies; which
they believe by their restless controversies less civil then Camps; as
intestine Quarrel is held more barbarous then foreign War. They think
Statesmen to them (unless dignified with Military office) but mean Spies that
like African foxes (who attend on Lions, ranging before and about, for their
valiant prey) shrink back till the danger be subdued, and then with insatiate
hunger come in for a share: Yet sometimes with the Eye of Envy (which inlarges
objects like a multiplying-glasse) they behold these Statesmen, and think them
immense as Whales; the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful calm
trouble the Ocean till it boil; after a little hasty wonder, they consider them
again with disdain of their low constraints at Court; where they must patiently
endure the little follics of such small favorites as wait even near the wisest
Thrones; so fantastically weak seem Monarchs in the sickness of Care (a fever
in the head) when for the humorous pleasure of Diversity, they descend from
Purple beds, and seek their ease upon the ground. These great Leaders say also
that Law moves slowly, as with fettered feet, and is too tedious in redress of
wrongs; whilst in Armies, Justice seems to ride post, and overtakes Offenders
ere the contagion of crimes can infect others: and though in Courts and Cities
great men fence often with her, and with a forcive slight put by her sword; yet
when she retires to Camps, she is in a posture not only to punish the offenses
of particular greatness, but of injurious Nations.

Statesmen look on Divines as men whose long solitude and Meditations on
Heaven has made them Strangers upon Earth: and it is acquaintance with the
World, and knowledge of Man that makes abilities of Ruling: for though it may
be said that a sufficient belief of Doctrine would bege^ obedience (which is
the uttermost design of governing) yet since diversity of Doctrine does
distract all Auditors, and makes them doubtfully dispose their obedience (even
toward spiritual powers, on which many would have the temporal depend)
therefore Statesmen think themselves more fit to manage Empire then Divines;
whose usefulness consists in persuasion; and persuasion is the last medicine
(being the most desperate) which Statesmen apply to the distemper of the
people: for their distemper is madness, and Madness is best cured with
terror and force. They think that Leaders of Armies are to great Empire, as
great Rivers to the Continent; which make an easy access of such benefits as
the Metropolis (the seat of Power) would else at vast distances with difficulty
reach: yet often like proud Rivers when they swell, they destroy more by once
overflowing their borders at home, then they have in long time acquired from
abroad: They are to little Empire like the Sea to low Islands; by nature a
defense from Foreigners, but by accident, when they rage, a deluge to their
own shore. And at all seasons Statesmen believe them more dangerous to
government then themselves: for the popularity of Statesmen is not so frequent
as that of Generals; or if by rare sufficiency of Art it be gained, yet the
force of Crowds in Cities, compared to the validity of men of Arms and
Discipline, would appear like the great number of Sheep to a few Wolves, rather
a cause of Comfort then of Terror. They think that chief Ministers of Law by
unskilful integrity, or love of popularity (which shows the Mind as meanly
born as bred) so earnestly pursue the protection of the Peoples right, that
they neglect the public Interest; and though the Peoples right and public
Interest be the same, yet usually by the People, the Ministers of Law mean
Private-men, and by the other, the State; and so the State and the People are
divided, as we may say a man is divided within himself, when reason and passion
(and Passion is folloy) dispute about consequent actions; and if we were called
to assist at such intestine war, we must side with Reason, according to our
duty by the Law of Nature; and Natures Law, though not written in Stone (as was
the Law of Religion) has taken deep impression in the Heart of Man, which is
harder then marble of Mount Sinai.

Chief Ministers of Law think, Divines in Government, should like the Penal
Statutes, be choicely and but seldom used; for as those Statutes are
rigorously inquisitive after venial faults (punishing our very manners and
weak constitution, as well as insolent appetite; so Divines (that are made
vehement with contemplating the dignity of the Offended (which is God) more
then the frailty of the Offender) govern as if men could be made Angels ere
they come to Heaven.

Great Ministers of Law think likewise that Leaders of Armies are like ill
Physicians, only fit for desperate cures, whose blindness calls in the
assistance of Fortune, during the fears and troubles of Art: Yet the health
they give to a distempered State is not more accidental then the preservation
of it is uncertain; because they often grow vain with success, and encourage a
restored State to such hazards, as show like irregularity of life in other
recovered bodies; such as the cautions and ancient gravity of Law disswades:
For Law (whose temperate design is safety) rather prevents by constancy of
Medicine (like a continued Diet) diseases in the Body-politick, then depends
after a permitted Sickness upon the chance of recovery. They think Statesmen
strive to be as much Judges of Law as themselves, being chief Ministers of Law,
are Judges of the People; and that even good Statesmen pervert the Law more
then evil Judges: For Law was anciently meant a Defensive Armor, and the
people took it as from the Magazin of Justice, to keep them safe from each
others violence: but Statesmen use it as offensive Arms, with which, in
forraging to get relief for Supreme Power, they often wound the Public.

Thus we have first observed the Four chief aids of Government, (Religion,
Arms, Policy, and Law) defectively applied, and then we have found them weak by
an emulous war amongst themselves: it follows next, we should introduce to
strengthen those principal aids (still making the People our direct object)
some collateral help; which I will safely presume to consist in Poesy.

We have observed that the People since the latter time of Christian religion,
are more unquiet then in former Ages: so disobedient and fierce, as if they
would shake off the ancient imputation of being Beasts, by showing their
Masters they know their own strength: and we shall not err by supposing that
this conjunction of Fourfould Power has faild in the effects of authority, by
a misapplication; for it has rather endeavored to prevail upon their bodies,
then their minds; forgetting that the martial art of constraining is the best;
which assaults the weaker part; and the weakest part of the people is their
minds; for want of that which is the Minds only Strength, Education; but
their Bodies are strong by continual labor; for Labor is the Education of
the body. Yet when I mention the misapplication of force, I should have said,
they have not only faild by that, but by a main error; Because the subject on
which they should work is the Mind; and the Mind can never be constraind,
though it may be gained by Persuasion: And since persuasion is the principal
Instrument which one can bring to fashion the brittle and misshapen metal of
the Mind; none are so fit aids to this important works, as Poets: whose art is
more then any enabled with a voluntary, and cheerful assistance of Nature; and
whose operations are as resistlesse secret, easy, and subtle, as is the
influence of Planets.

I must not forget (left I be prevented by the Vigilance of the Reader) that I
have profe^s'd not to represent the beauty of virtue in my Poem, with hope to
persuade common men; and I have said that Divines have failed in discharging
their share of Government, by depending upon the effects of Persuasion; and
that Statesmen in managing the people rely not upon the persuasion of Divines,
but upon force. In my despair of reducing the minds of Common men, I have not
confessed any weakness of Poesy in the general Science; but rather inferred the
particular strength of the Heroic; which has a force that over-matches the
infancy of such minds as are not enabled by degrees of Education; but there are
lesser forces in other kinds of Poesy, by which they may train, and prepare
their understandings; and Princes, and Nobles being reformed and made
Angelical by the Heroic, will be predominant lights, which the People cannot
chose but use for direction; as Gloworms take in, and keep the Sun's ^eams till
they shine, and make day to themselves.

In saying that Divines have vainly hoped to continue the peace of Government
by persuasion, I have implied such persuasions as are accompanied with
threatenings, and seconded by force; which are the persuasions of Pulpits; where
is presented to the Obstinate, Hell after Death; and the civil Magistrate
during Life constrains such obedience as the Church does ordain. But the
persuasions of Poesy in stead of menaces, are Harmonious and delightful
in^inuations, and never any constraint; unless the ravishment of Reason may be
called Force. And such Force, (contrary to that which Divines, Commanders,
Statesmen, and Lawyer's use) begets such obedience as is never weary or
grieved.

In declaring that Statesmen think not the State wholly secure by such manners
as are bred from the persuasions of Divines, but more willingly make Government
rely upon military force; I have neither concluded that Poets are unprofi^able,
nor that Statesmen think so; for the wisdom of Poets, would first make the
Images of Virtue so amiable that her beholders should not be able to look off
(rather gently, and delightfully infusing then inculcating Precepts) and then
when the mind is conquered, like a willing Bride, Force should so behave it
self, as noble Husbands use their power: that is, by letting their Wives see
the Dignity and prerogative of our Sex (which is the Husbands harmless
conquest of Peace) continually maintained to hinder Disobedience, rather then
rigourously impose Duty: But to such an easy government, neither the People
(which are subjects to Kings and States) nor Wives (which are subject to
Husbands) can peacefully yield, unless they are first conquered by Virtue; and
the Conquests of Virtue be never easy, but where her sorces are commanded by
Poets.

It may be objected that the education of the Peoples minds (from whence
Virtuous manners are derived) by the several kinds of Poesy (of which the
Dramatick has been in all Ages very successful) is opposite to the received
opinion, that the People ought to be continued in ignorance; a Maxim sounding
like the little subtletie of one that is a Statesman only by Birth or Beard,
and merits not his place by much thinking; For Ignorance is rude, censorious,
jealous, obstinate, and proud; these being exactly the ingredients of which
Disobedience is made; and Obedience proceeds from ample consideration, of which
knowledge consists; and knowledge will soon put into one Scale the weight of
oppression, and in the other, the heavy burden which Disobedience lays on us
in the effects of civil War: and then even Tyranny will seem much lighter,
when the hand of Supreme Power binds up our Load, and lays it artfully on us,
then Disobedience (the Parent of Con^usion) when we all load one another; in
which every one irregularly increases his fellows burden, to lessen his own.

Others may object that Poesy on our Stago, or the Heroic in Music (for so
the latter was anciently used) is prejudicial to a State; as begetting Levity,
and giving the People too great a diversion by pleasure and mirth. To these (if
they be worthy of Satisfaction) I reply; That whoever in Government endeavors
to make the People serious and grave, (which are attributes that may become the
Peoples Representatives, but not the People) does practice a new way to enlarge
the State, by making every Subject a Statesman: and he that means to govern so
mournfully (as it were, without any Music in his Dominion) must lay but light
burdens on his Subjects; or else he wants the ordinary wisdom of those, who to
their Beasts that are much laden whistle all the day to encourage their
Travail. For that supreme power which expects a firm obedience in those, who
are not used to rejoicing, but live sadly, as if they were still preparing for
the ^unerall of peace, has little skill in contriving the lastingnesse of
Government, which is the principal work of Art; And less has that Power
considered Nature; as if such new austerity did seem to tax, even her, for want
of gravity in bringing in the Spring so merrily with a musical variety of
Birds; And such sullen power does forget that Battles (the most solemn and
serious business of Death) are begun with Trumpets and Fifes; and anciently
were continued with more diversity of Music. And that the Grecian Laws (Laws
being the gravest endeavor of humane Councels, for the ease of Life) were long
before the Days of Ly^urgus (to make them more pleasant to memory) published
in Verse: And that the wise Athenians (dividing into Three parts the public
Revenew) expended one in plays and Shows, to divert the people from meeting
to consult of their Rulers merit, and the defects of Government: And that the
Romans had not so long continued their Empire, but for the same diver^ions, at
a vaster charge.

Again, it may be objected, that the precepts of Christian Religion are
sufficient toward our regulation, by appointment of manners; and toward the
ease of Life, by imposing obedience; so that the moral assistance of Poesy,
is but vainly intruded. To this I may answer, that as no man should suspect the
sufficiency of Religion by its unsuccessfulnesse, so if the unsuccessfulnesse
be confessed, we shall as little disparage Religion, by bringing in more aids
when it is in action, as a General dishonours himself by endeavoring with more
of his own Forces to make sure an attempt that has a while miscarri'd: For
Poesy, which (like contracted Essences seems the utmost strength and activity
of Nature) is as all good Arts, ^ubservient to Religion; all marching under the
same Banner, though of less discipline and esteem. And as Poesy is the best
Expositour of Nature (Nature being mysterious to such as use not to consider)
so Nature is the best Interpreter of God; and more cannot be said of Religion.
And when the Judges of Religion (which are the Chiefs of the Church) neglect
the help of Moralists in reforming the People (and Poets are of all Moralists
the most useful) they give a sentence against the Law of Nature: For Nature
performs all things by correspondent aids and harmony. And it is injurious not
to think Poets the most useful Moralists; for as Poesy is adorned and
sublimed by Music, which makes it more pleasant and acceptable; so morality is
sweetened and made more amiable by Poesy. And the Austerity of some Divines may
be the cause why Religion has not more prevaild upon the manners of Men: for
great Doctors should rather comply with things that please (as the wise
Apostle did with Ceremonies) then lose a Proselyte. And even Honor (taught by
moral Philosophers, but more delightfully infused by Poets) will appear
(notwithstanding the sad severity of some later Divines) no unsafe Guide
toward Piety; for it is as wary and nice as Conscience, though more cheerful
and courageous. And however Honor be more pleasing to flesh and blood, because
in this World it find's applause; yet it is not so mercinary as Piety: for Piety
(being of all her expectations inwardly assured) expects a reward in Heaven; to
which all earthly payments compared, are but Shadows, and Sand.

And it appears that Poesy has for its natural prevailings over the
Understandings of Men (sometimes making her conquests with easy plainness,
like native country beauty) been very successful in the most grave, and
important occasions that the necessities of States or Mankind have produced.
For it may be said that Demosthenes saved the Athenians by the Fable or Parable
of the Dogs and Wolves, in answer to King Philips proposition; And that
Menenius Agrippa saved the Senate, if not Rome, by that of the Belly and the
Hands: and that even our Savior was pleased (as the most prevalent way of
Doctrine) wholly to use such kind of Parables in his converting, or saving of
Souls; it being written, Without a Parable spoke he not to them. And had not
the learned Apostle thought the wisdom of Poets worthy his remembrance, and
instructive, not only to Heathens, but to Christians; he had not cited
Epimenides to the Cretans, as well as Aratus to the Athenians.

I cannot also be ignorant, that diverse (whose conscientious Melancholy amazes
and discourages others Devotion) will accuse Poets as the Admirers of Beauty,
and Inventours, or Provokers of that which by way of aspersion they call Love.
But such, in their first accusation seem to look carelessly and unthankfully
upon the wonderful works of God; or else through low education, or age, become
incompetent Judges of what is the chief of his Works upon Earth. And Poets,
when they praise Beauty, are at least as lawfully thankful to God, as when
they praise Seas, Woods, Rivers, or any other parts that make up a prospect of
the World. Nor can it be imagined but that Poets in praising them, praise
wholly the Maker; and so in praising Beauty: For that woman who believes she is
praised when her Beauty is commended, may as well suppose that Poets think she
created her self: And he that praises the inward Beauty of Women, which is
their Virtue, does more perform his duty then before: for our envious silence
in not approving, and so encouraging what is good, is the cause that Vice is
more in fashion and countenance then Virtue. But when Poets praise that which
is not Beauty, or the Mind which is not virtuous, they err through their
mistake or by flattery; and flattery is a crime so much more prosperous in
others who are Companions to Greatness, that it may be held in Poets rather
Kindness then Design.

They who accuse Poets as Provokers of Love, are Enemies to Nature; and all
affronts to Nature are offenses to God, as insolences to all subordinate
Officers of the Crown are rudenesses to the King. Love (in the most obnoxious
interpretation) is Nature's Preparative to her greatest Work, which is the
making of Life. And since the severest Divines of these later times have not
been ashamed publicly to command and define the most secret duties, and
entertainments of Love in the Married; why should not Poets civilly endeavor
to make a friendship between the Guests before they meet, by teaching them to
dignifie each other with the utmost of estimation? And Marriage in Mankind were
as rude and unprepared as the hasty elections of other Creatures, but for
acquaintance and conversation before it: and that must be an acquaintance of
Minds, not of Bodies; and of the Mind, Poesy is the most natural and
delightful Interpreter.

When neither Religion (which is our Art toward God) nor Nature (which is Gods
first Law to Man, though by Man least studied) nor when Reason (which is
Nature, and made Art by Experience) can by the Enemies of Poesy be
sufficiently urged against it; then some (whose frowardness will not let them
quit an evil cause) plead written Authority. And though such authority be a
Weapon, that even in the War of Religion, distressed Disputers take up, as
their last shift; yet here we would protest against it, but that we find it
makes a false defense, and leaves the Enemy more open. This authority (which is
but single too) is from Plato; and him some have maliciously quoted; as if in
his feigned Commonwealth he had banished all Poets. But Plato says nothing
against Poets in general; and in his particular quarrel (which is to Homer and
Hesiod) only condemns such errors as we mentioned in the beginning of this
Preface, when we looked upon the Ancients. And those errors consist in their
abasing Religion, by representing the Gods in evil proportion, and their
Heroes with as unequal Characters; and so brought Vices into fashion, by
intermixing them with the Virtues of great Persons. Yet even during this divine
anger of Plato, he concludes not against Poesy, but the Poems then most in
request: for these be the words of his Law. If any Man (having ability to
imitate what he pleases) imitate in his Poems both good and evil, let him be
reverenced, as a sacred admirable, and pleasant Person; but be it likewise
known, he must have no place in our Commonwealth. And yet before his
banishment, he allows him, the honor of a Diadem, and sweet Odours to anoint
his Head: and afterward says, Let us make use of more profitable, though more
severe, and less pleasant Poets, who can imitate that which is for the honor
and benefit of the Commonwealth. But those who make use of this just
indignation of Plato to the unjust scandal of Poesy, have the common craft of
false Witnesses, enlarging every circumstance, when it may hurt, and concealing
all things that may defend him they oppose. For they will not remember how much
the Scholar of Plato (who like an absolute Monarch over Arts, has almost
silenced his Master throughout the Schools of Europe) labors to make Poesy
universally current, by giving Laws to the Science: Nor will they take notice
in what dignity it continued whilst the Greeks kept their Dominion or Language;
and how much the Romans cherished even the public repetition of Verses Nor
will they vouchsafe to observe (though Iuvenal take care to record it) how
gladly all Rome (during that exercise) ran to the voice of Statius.

Thus having taken measure (though hastily) of the extent of those great
Professions that in Government contribute to the necessities, ease, and lawful
pleasures of Men; and finding Poesy as useful now, as the Ancients found it
toward perfection and happiness; I will, Sir, (unless with these two Books
you return me a discouragement) cheerfully proceed: and though a little time
would perfect the Third, and make it fit for the Press; I am resolved rarather
to hazard the inconvenience which expectation breeds (for diverse with no ill
satisfaction have had a taste of GONDIBERT) then endure that violent envy which
assaults all Writers whilst they live; though their Papers be but filled with
very negligent and ordinary thoughts: and therefore I delay the publication of
any part of the Poem, till I can send it you from America, whither I now
speedily prepare; having the folly to hope, that when I am in another World
(though not in the common sense of dying) I shall find my Readers even the
Poets of the present Age as temperate and benign as we are all to the Dead,
whose remote excellence cannot hinder our reputation. And now, Sir, to end with
the Allegory which I have so long continued, I shall (after all my busy vanity
in showing and describing my new Building) with great quietness (being almost
as weary as your self) b^ing you to the Backdore, that you may make no review,
but in my absence; and steal hastily from you, as one who is ashamed of all the
trouble you have received from,

SIR, Your most humble, and most affectionate Servant, WILL. D'AVENANT.
From the Louure in Paris, January 2. 1650.
THE ANSWER OF Mr. HOBBS TO Sr. WILLIAM D'AVENANT'S PREFACE before GONDIBERT.
SIR,
IF to commend your Poem, I should only say (in general terms) that in the
choice of your Argument, the disposition of the parts, the maintenance of the
Characters of your Persons, the Dignity and Vigor of your Expression you have
performed all the parts of various experience, ready memory, clear judgment,
swift and well governed fancy, though it were enough for the truth, it were too
little for the weight and credit of my testimony. For I lie open to two
Exceptions, one of an incompetent, the other of a corrupted Witness.
Incompetent, because I am not a Poet; and corrupted with the Honor done me by
your PREFACE. The former obliges me to say something (by the way) of the Nature
and differences of Poesy.

As Philosophers have divided the Universe (their subject) into three Regions,
Celestial, AEriall, and Terrestrial; so the Poets (whose work it is by
imitating humane life, in delightful and measured lines, to avert men from
vice, and incline them to virtuous and honorable actions) have lodged
themselves in the three Regions of Mankind, Court, City, and Country
correspondent in some proportion, to those three Regions of the World. For
there is in Princes and men of conspicuous power (anciently called Heroes) a
luster and influence upon the rest of men, resembling that of the Heavens; and
an insincerenesse, inconstancy, and troublesome humor of those that dwell in
populous Cities, like the mobility, blustering, and impurity of the Air; and a
plainness, and (though dull) yet a nutritive faculty in rural people, that
endures a comparison with the Earth they labor.

From hence have proceeded three sorts of Poesy; Heroic, Scommatick, and
Pastoral. Every one of these is distinguished again in the manner of
Representation, which sometimes is Narrative, wherein the Poet himself
relates, and sometimes Dramatick, as when the persons are every one adorned
and brought upon the Theater, to speak and act their own parts. There is
therefore neither more nor less then six sorts of Poesy. For the Heroic Poem
narrative (such as is yours) is called an Epick Poem; The Heroic Poem
Drammatick, is Tragedy. The Scommatick Narrative, is Satyr; Drammatick is
Comedy. The Pastoral narrative, is called simply Pastoral (anciently
Bucolick) the same Dramatick, Pastoral Comedy. The Figure therefore of an
Epick Poem, and of a Tragedy, ought to be the same, for they differ no more but
in that they are pronounced by one, or many persons. Which I insert to justify
the figure of yours, consisting of five books divided into Songs or Cantoes, as
five Acts divided into Scenes has ever been the approved figure of a Tragedy.

They that take for Poesy whatsoever is writ in Verse, will think this
division imperfect, and call in Sonnets, Epigrammes, Eclogues, and the like
pieces (which are but Essays, and parts of an entire Poem) and reckon
Empedocles, and Lucretius (natural Philosophers) for Poets, and the moral
precepts of Phocylides, Theognis, and the Quatrains of Pybrach, and the History
of Lucan, and others of that kind amongst Poems; bestowing on such Writers for
honor the name of Poets, rather then of Historians or Philosophers. But the
subject of a Poem is the manners of men, not natural causes; manners
presented, not dictated; and manners feigned (as the name of Poesy imports)
not found in men. They that give entrance to Fictions writ in prose, err not
so much, but they err. For Poesy requires delightfulness, not only of
fiction, but of style; in which if prose contend with Verse, it is with
disadvantage (as it were) on foot, against the strength and wings of Pegasus.

For Verse amongst the Greeks was appropriated anciently to the service of
their Gods and was the Holy style; the style of the Oracles; the style of the
Laws; and the style of men that publicly recommended to their Gods, the vows
and thanks of the people; which was done in their holy Songs called Hymns; and
the Composers of them were called Prophets and Priests before the name of Poet
was known. When afterward the majesty of that style was observed, the Poets
chose it as best becoming their high invention. And for the Antiquity of Verse
it is greater then the Antiquity of Letters. For it is certain Cadmus was the
first that (from Phoenicia, a country that neighboureth Judea) brought the use
of Letters into Greece. But the service of the Gods, and the laws (which by
measured Sounds were easily committed to the memory) had been long time in use,
before the arrival of Cadmus there.

There is besides the grace of style, another cause why the ancient Poets chose
to write in measured language, which is this. Their Poems were made at first
with intention to have them sung, as well Epique, as Dramatique (which custom
has been long time laid aside, but began to be revived in part, of late years
in Italy) and could not be made commensurable to the Voice or instruments, in
Prose; the ways and motions whereof are so uncertain and undistinguished,
(like the way and motion of a Ship in the Sea) as not only to discompose the
best Composers, but also to disappoint sometimes the most attentive Reader, and
put him to hunt counter for the sense. It was therefore necessary for Poets in
those times, to write in Verse.

The verse which the Greeks, and Latins (considering the nature of their own
languages) found by experience most grave, and for an Epique Poem most decent,
was their Hexameter; a Verse limited, not only in the length of the line, but
also in the quantity of the syllables. In stead of which we use the line of ten
syllables, recompensing the neglect of their quantity, with the diligence of
Rhyme. And this measure is so proper for an Heroic Poem, as without some loss
of gravity and dignity, it was never changed. A longer is not far from ill
prose, and a shorter, is a kind of whisking (you know) like the unlacing,
rather then the singing of a Muse. In an Epigramme or a Sonnet, a man may vary
his measures, and seek glory from a needless difficulty, as he that contrived
verses into the forms of an Organ, a Hatchet, an Egg, an Altar, and a pair of
Wings; but in so great and noble a work as is an Epick Poem, for a man to
obstruct his own way with unprofitable difficulties, is great imprudence. So
likewise to choose a needless and difficult correspondence of Rhyme, is but a
difficult toy, and forces a man sometimes for the stopping of a chink to say
somewhat he did never think; I cannot therefore but very much approve your
Stanza, wherein the syllables in every verse are ten, and the Rhyme, Alternate.

For the choice of your subject you have sufficiently justified your self in
your Preface. But because I have observed in Virgil, that the Honor done to
AEneas and his companions, has so bright a reflection upon Augustus Caesar, and
other great Romans of that time, as a man may suspect him not constantly
possessed with the noble spirit of those his Heroes, and believe you are not
acquainted with any great man of the Race of Gondibert. I add to your
Justification the purity of your purpose, in having no other motive of your
labor, but to adorn virtue, and procure her Lovers; then which there cannot be
a worthier design and more becoming noble Poesy.

In that you make so small account of the example of almost all the approved
Poets, ancient and modern, who thought fit in the beginning, and sometimes
also in the progress of their Poemes, to invoke a Muse, or some other Deity,
that should dictate to them, or assist them in their writings, they that take
not the laws of Art, from any reason of their own, but from the fashion of
precedent times, will perhaps accuse your singularity. For my part, I neither
subscribe to their accusation, nor yet condem^e that Heathen custom, otherwise
then as necessary to their false Religion. For their Poets were their Divines;
had the name of Prophets; Exercised amongst the people a kind of Spiritual
Authority; would be thought to speak by a Divine spirit; have their works which
they writ in Verse (the Divine style) pass for the word of God, and not of
man; and to be harkened to with reverence. Do not our Divines (excepting the
style) do the same, and by us that are of the same Religion cannot justly be
reprehended for it? Besides, in the use of the spiritual calling of Divines,
there is danger sometimes to be feared, from want of skill, such as is reported
of unskilful Conjurers, that mistaking the rites and ceremonious points of
their art, call up such spirits, as they cannot at their pleasure allay again;
by whom storms are raised, that overthrow buildings, and are the cause of
miserable wracks at Sea. Unskilful Divines do oftentimes the like, For when
they call unseasonably for Zeal, there appears a spirit of Cruelty; and by the
like error instead of Truth they raise Discord; instead of Wisdom, Fraud;
instead of Reformation, Tumult; and Controversy instead of Religion. Whereas
in the Heathen Poets, at least in those whose works have lasted to the time we
are in, there are none of those indiscretions to be found, that tended to
subversion or disturbance of the Commonwealths wherein they lived. But why a
Christian should think it an ornament to his Poem, either to profane the true
God, or invoke a false one, I can imagine no cause, but a reasonlesse imitation
of custom; of a foolish custom; by which a man, enabled to speak wisely from
the principles of nature, and his own meditation, loves rather to be thought to
speak by inspiration, like a Bag-pipe.

Time and education beget experience; Experience begets Memory; Memory begets
Judgment and Fancy; Judgment begets the strength and structure, and Fancy
begets the ornaments of a Poem. The Ancients therefore fabled not absurdly, in
making memory the mother of the Muses. For memory is the World (though not
really, yet so as in a looking-glass) in which the Judgment (the severer
Sister) busieth her self in a grave and rigid examination of all the parts of
Nature, and in registring by Letters, their order, causes, uses, differences
and resemblances; Whereby the Fancy, when any work of Art is to be performed,
finds her materials at hand and prepared for use, and needs no more then a
swift motion over them, that what she wants, and is there to be had, may not
lie too long unespied. So that when she seems to fly from one Indies to the
other, and from Heaven to Earth, and to penetrate into the hardest matter, and
obscurest places, into the future, and into her self, and all this in a point
of time; the voyage is not very great, her self being all she seeks; and her
wonderful celerity, consists not so much in motion, as in copious Imagery
discreetly ordered, and perfectly registered in the memory; which most men under
the name of Philosophy have a glimpse of, and is pretended to by many that
grossly mistaking her embrace contention in her place. But so far forth as
the Fancy of man has traced the ways of true Philosophy, so far it has
produced very mavelous effects to the benefit of mankind. All that is
beautiful or defensible in building; or mervellous in Engines and Instruments
of motion; Whatsoever commodity men receive from the observation of the
Heavens, from the description of the Earth, from the account of Time, from
walking on the Seas; and whatsoever distinguishes the civility of Europe, from
the Barbarity of the American salvages, is the workmanship of Fancy, but guided
by the Preceps of true Philosophy. But where these precepts fail, as they have
hitherto failed in the doctrine of Moral virtue, there the Architect ( Fancy)
must take the Philosophers part upon her self. He therefore that undertakes an
Heroic Poem (which is to exhibit a venerable and amiable Image of Heroic
virtue) must not only be the Poet, to place and connex, but also the
Philosopher, to furnish and square his matter, that is, to make both body and
soul, color and shadow of his Poem out of his own store: which how well you
have performed I am now considering.

Observing how few the persons be you introduce in the beginning, and how in
the course of the actions of these (the number increasing) after several
confluences, they run all at last into the two principal streams of your Poem,
Gondibert and Oswald, me thinks the Fable is not much unlike the Theater. For
so, from several and far distant Sources, do the lesser Brooks of Lombardy,
flowing into one another, fall all at last into the two main Rivers, the Po,
and the Adice. It has the same resemblance also with a man's veins, which
proceeding from different parts, after the like concourse, insert themselves at
last into the two principal veins of the Body. But when I considered that also
the actions of men, which singly are inconsiderable, after many conjunctures,
grow at last either into one great protecting power, or into two destroying
Factions; I could not but approve the structure of your Poem, which ought to be
no other then such as an imitation of humane life requires.

In the streams themselves I find nothing but settled Valor, clean Honor, calm
Counsel, learned Diversion, and pure Love; save only a torrent or two of
Ambition, which (though a fault) has somewhat Heroic in it, and therefore
must have place in an Heroic Poem. To show the Reader in what place he shall
find every excellent picture of Virtue you have drawn, is too long. And to show
him one, is to prejudice the rest; yet I cannot forbear to point him to the
Description of Love in the person of Birtha, in the seventh Canto of the second
Book. There has nothing been said of that subject neither by the Ancient nor
modern Poets comparable to it. Poets are Painters: I would fain see another
Painter draw so true, perfect, and natural a Love to the Life, and make use of
nothing but pure lines, without the help of any the least uncomely shadow, as
you have done. But let it be read as a piece by it self, for in the almost
equal height of the whole, the eminence of parts is Lost.

There are some that are not pleased with fiction, unless it be bold not only
to exceed the work, but also the possibility of nature: they would have
impenetrable Armours, Enchanted Castles, invulnerable bodies, Iron men, flying
Horses, and a thousand other such things which are easily feigned by them that
dare. Against such I defend you (without assenting to those that condemn
either Homer or Virgil) by dissenting only from those that think the Beauty of
a Poem consists in the exorbitancy of the fiction. For as truth is the bound
of Historical, so the Resemblance of truth is the utmost limit of Poetical
Liberty. In old time amongst the Heathens, such strange Fictions and
Metamorphoses, were not so remote from the Articles of their Faith, as they are
now from ours, and therefore we are not so unpleasant. Beyond the actual works
of Nature a Poet may now go; but beyond the conceived possibility of Nature,
never. I can allow a Geographer to make in the Sea, a fish or a ship, which by
the scale of his Map would be two or three hundred miles long, and think it
done for ornament, because it is done without the precincts of his undertaking;
but when he paints an Elephant so, I presently apprehend it as ignorance, and a
plain confession of Terra incognita.

As the description of great Men, and great Actions is the constant design of a
Poet; so the Descriptions of worthy circumstances are necessary accessions to a
Poem, and being well performed, are the Jewels and most precious ornaments of
Poesy. Such in Virgil, are the Funeral games of Anchises. The Duel of AEneas
and Turnus, etc. And such in yours, are The Hunting. The Battle. The City
Mourning. The Funeral* the House of Astragon. The Library. And the Temples.
Equal to his, or those of Homer whom he imitated.

There remains now no more to be considered but the Expression, in which
consists the countenance and color of a beautiful Muse; and is given her by
the Poet out of his own provision, or is borrowed from others. That which he
has of his own, is nothing but experience and knowledge of Nature, and
specially humane Nature; and is the true and natural Color. But that which is
taken out of Books (the ordinary boxes of counterfeit Complexion) shows well or
ill, as it has more or less resemblance with the Natural* and are not to be
used (without examination) unadvisedly. For in him that professes the imitation
of Nature, (as all Poets do) what greater fault can there be, then to bewray an
ignorance of nature in his Poem; especially having a liberty allowed him, if he
meet with any thing he cannot master, to leave it out?

That which gives a Poem the true and natural Color, consists in two
things, which are, To know well; that is, to have images of nature in the
memory distinct and clear; and To know much. A sign of the first is
perspicuity, property, and decency; which delight all sorts of men, either by
instructing the ignorant, or soothing the learned in their knowledge: A sign of
the later is novelty of expression, and pleases by excitation of the mind; for
novelty causes a dmiration; and admiration, curiosity; which is a delightful
appetite of knowledge.

There be so many words in use at this day in the English tongue, that, though
of magnifick sound, yet (like the windy blisters of a troubled water) have no
sense at all; and so many others that lose their meaning by being ill coupled,
that it is a hard matter to avoid them; for having been obtruded upon Youth in
the Schools (by such as make it, I think, their business there, as it is
expressed by the best Poet) With terms to charm the weak and pose the wise.
Gondib. 1 r. Cant. 5. they grow up with them, and gaining reputation with the
ignorant, are not easily shaken off.

To this palpable darkness, I may also add the ambitious obscurity of
expressing more then is perfectly conceived; or perfect conception in fewer
words then it requires. Which Expressions, though they have had the honor to
be called strong lines, are indeed no better then Riddles, and not only to the
Reader, but also (after a little time) to the Writer himself, dark and
troublesome.

To the property of Expression, I refer that clearness of memory, by which a
Poet when he has once introduced any person whatsoever, speaking in his Poem,
maintains in him, to the end, the same Character he gave to him in the
beginning. The variation whereof, is a change of pace that argues the Poet
tired.

Of the Indecencies of an Heroic Poem, the most remarkable are those that show
disproportion either between the persons and their actions, or between the
manners of the Poet and the Poem. Of the first kind, is the uncomelinesse of
representing in great persons the inhumane vice of Cruelty, or the sordid vices
of Lust and Drunkenness. To such parts as those, the Ancient approved Poets
thought it fit to suborn, not the persons of men, but of monsters and beastly
Giants, such as Polyphemus, Cacus, and the Centaurs. For it is supposed, a
Muse, when she is invoked to sing a song of that nature, should maidenly advise
the Poet to set such persons to sing their own vices upon the stage; for it is
not so unseemly in a Tragedy. Of the same kind it is to represent scurrility,
or any action or language that moves much laughter. The delight of an Epique
Poem consists not in mirth but in admiration. Mirth and laughter is proper to
Comedy and Satyr. Great persons that have their minds employed on great
designs have not leisure enough to laugh, and are pleased with the
contemplation of their own power and virtues, so as they need not the
infirmities and vices of other men to recommend themselves to their own favor
by comparison, as all men do when they laugh. Of the second kind, where the
disproportion is between the Poet, and the persons of his Poem, one is in the
Dialect of the Inferior sort of People which is always different from the
language of the Court. Another is to derive the Illustration of any thing, from
such metaphors or comparisons as cannot come into men's thoughts, but by mean
conversation, and experience of humble or evil Arts, which the persons of an
Epick Poem cannot be thought acquainted with.

From Knowing much, proceeds the admirable variety and novelty of metaphors
and similitudes, which are not possibly to be lighted on in the compass of a
narrow knowledge. And the want whereof compels a Writer to Expressions that
are either defaced by time, or sullied with vulgar or long use. For the phrases
of Poesy, as the airs of Music, with often hearing become insipide; the
Reader having no more sense of their force, then our Flesh is sensible of the
bones that sustain it. As the sense we have of bodies, consists in change and
variety of impression, so also does the sense of language in the variety and
changeable use of words. I mean not in the affectation of words newly brought
home from travel, but in new (and withal, significant) translation to our
purposes, of those that be already received, and in far fetched (but withal,
apt, instructive, and comely) sumilitudes.

Having thus (I hope) avoided the first Exception, against the Incompetency of
my Judgment: I am but little moved with the second; which is, of being bribed
by the honor you have done me, by attributing in your Preface somewhat to my
Judgment. For I have used your Judgment no loss in many things of mine,
which coming to light will thereby appear the better. And so you have your
bribe again.

Having thus made way for the admission of my Testimony, I give it briefly
thus; I never yet saw Poem that had so much shape of Art, health of Morality,
and vigor and beauty of Expression, as this of yours. And but for the clamor
of the multitude that hide their Envy of the present, under a Reverence of
Antiquity, I should say further, that it would last as long as either the
AEneid or Iliad, but for one Disadvantage. And the Disadvantage is this: The
languages of the Greeks and Romans (by their Colonies and Conquest) have put
off flesh and blood, and are become immutable, which none of the Modern Tongues
are like to be. I honor Antiquity; but, that which is commonly called old
time, is young time. The glory of Antiquity is due, not to the Dead, but to the
Aged.

And now, whilst I think on it, give me leave with a short discord to sweeten
the Harmony of the approaching close. I have nothing to object against your
Poem; but, dissent only from something in your Preface, sounding to the
prejudice of Age. It Is commonly said, that old Age is a return to Childhood.
Which me thinks you insist on so long, as if you desired it should be believed.
That Is the Note I mean to shake a little. That saying, meant only of the
weakness of body, was wrested to the weakness of mind, by froward children,
weary of the controlment of their parents, masters, and other admonitours.
Secondly, the dotage and childishness they ascribe to Age, is never the effect
of Time, but sometimes of the excesses of Youth, and not a returning to, but a
continual stay with Childhood. For they that wanting the curiosity of
furnishing their memories with the rarities of nature in their Youth, and pass
their time in making provision only for their ease and sensual delight, are
Children still, at what years soever; as they that coming into a populous city,
never go out of their own Inn, are strangers still, how long soever they have
been there. Thirdly, there is no reason for any man to think himself wiser to
day then yesterday, which does not equally convince he shall be wiser to morrow
then to day.

Fourthly, you will be forced to change your opinion hereafter when you are
old; and in the mean time you discredit all I have said before in your
commendation, because I am old already. But no more of this.

I believe (Sir) you have seen a curious kind of perspective, where, he that
looks through a short hollow pipe, upon a picture containing diverse figures,
sees none of those that are there painted, but some one person made up of their
parts, conveyed to the eye by the artificial cutting of a glass. I find in
my imagination an effect not unlike it from your Poem. The virtues you
distribute there amongst so many noble Persons represent (in the reading) the
image but of one man's virtue to my fancy, which is your own; and that so deeply
imprinted, as to stay for ever there, and govern all the rest of my thoughts
and affections in the way of honoring and serving you, to the utmost of my
power, that am

SIR, Your most humble, and obedient Servant, THOMAS HOBBS.
