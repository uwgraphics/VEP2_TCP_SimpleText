LONDON, Printed for the Author, 1696.

A POEM on the Birth, Life, Death, and Resurrection of our most blessed Lord
and Savior JESUS CHRIST.
CHAP. I.
The ARGUMENT.
Theophilus the Lover of God, begins in making mention of the unsearchable
Attributes and Perfections of Jehovah, and how he is encompassed on his
glorious Throne by the Holy Hierarchy and Order of Angels, Seraphims,
Cherubims, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Archangels, who are
Eternally casting their Crowns at the Feet of the Incomprehensible Trinity,
with Hallelujahs.

JEHOVAH right, is Infinite,
And in eternal Bliss:
The most Supreme therefore does reign,
O Kings give him a Kiss. Ps. 2.12.

Who is Immense, and full of Sense,
An independent Good;
Yea, only Wise: do not despise
The Everliving God.
In all his Will immutable,
For Changes he knows none:
How can that be, when perfect's he,
Three Persons yet but One?
Pure Angels fall, and honor all
The Glorious Trinity,
With Crowns down cast, their Praises last
Unto Eternity.
The Seraphims, and Cherubims,
Thrones, Principalities;
Dominions too, Archangels true,
Their God for ever praise.
CHAP. II.
The ARGUMENT.
Here interposeth an holy Evangelist, who give an Account of the horrible
Revolt of some of the Angels from Jehovah their suprea^ Lord: And that one of
them, now call Beelzebub, headed Thousands, with Design to overthrow God's
Monarchy.

BUT one through Pride, became a Head
To thousands, who resolved
God's Monarchy for to destroy,
Rather than be controlled.
They War maintain, in Heaven's Plain,
So they might equal be,
In Honor, Praise, and length of Days,
Unto the Trinity.
God pleads his Rights, and them despites,
So hurls them into Hell,
To the Abyss, Pit bottomless,
Where they shall ever yell.
Then Satan proud, he spoke aloud,
What tho the Field be lost?
All is not gone, my Heart's not won,
To love Jehovah most.
This I can boast, all is not lost,
My Will's unconq'rable;
Resolved I be still to be free,
Tho I remain a Devil.
'Twere shame for me to bow the Knee,
And God adore and love:
A Prince in Hell, does far excel
Subjection, tho above. Mr. Milton.

A Chaos great, and Abyss deep,
God casts those Rebels in;
A burning Lake is their sad Fate,
And Flames all surrounding.
CHAP. III.
The ARGUMENT.
Jehovah himself gives a Relation of h^^ framing the Heavens and Earth; an^ how
he created another Creature calle^ Man, to serve him better than the fallen
Angels; and having very glorious Qualifications, is made Lord of the New World.

THE Earth and Man, I God did frame,
And made him Lord of all,
In Righteousness and Holiness,
With an immortal Soul.
This Man most wise, in Paradise,
I fixed with great delight;
Whose Will was free, at liberty,
To be unjust or right.
That Man alone might not lie down,
A Help-meet him I gave;
And from his Bone, and Flesh alone,
The Woman came most brave.
And for a time, how did they shine,
In this delightful Place;
In this new Land, how Hand in Hand,
They walked with God in Grace.
CHAP. IV.
The ARGUMENT.
an having discovered the New World, and Man reigning as King in it, the Devil
envies his Paradisical State; and in order to make him miserable like himself,
he tempts him to throw off the Government of his Lord and Maker: All which the
good Angel which guarded Paradise, could not be ignorant of.

SATAN did tell the Peers of Hell,
An Ancient Prophecy
In Heaven was, A World should rise
From nothing very high.
In which New Land, I understand,
A Creature beautiful;
Not much below our selves, I know,
Will reign as I in Hell.
Come noble Peers, some Course let us steer,
This Land for to discover;
And then allure this Creature pure,
To act as our own Brother.
God on his Throne, with his blessed Son,
Saw Satan swiftly fly,
Unto the Man in this new Land,
To bring to misery.
The Angels good, they understood,
While guarding this new Creature;
The fallen One discovered Man,
With a most blessed Feature.
An evil one, they saw fly down,
To Adam in disguise.
So walked their Rounds, the Garden-Bounds,
If him they might surprise.
In Paradise, he tempts with Lies,
That Man his Bliss might lose;
As he lost God, all Hope and Good,
Which made him thus confused.
Satan did fix the weakest Sex,
With Eve did thus begin;
To eat's, no Death, the Serpent says,
It Is natural, no Sin.
The Serpent speaks so fine and neat,
Which made the Woman say,
How came you thus, to speak to us,
By tasting yonder Tree?
Come eat good Food, and know as God,
Don't live in Ignorance;
In Envy he forbids thee
This Tree; come eat but once.
And so at last, through sinful Lust,
They both were overcome;
Their Fruit dear cost, God's Image lost,
And so the World's undone.
For Man his Maker, his Creator,
In Paradise enjoyed:
Till he did sin against his King,
Nothing the Man annoyed.
Till he did break, and violate
The Law of his Supreme;
His Happiness was perfect Bliss,
He as a King did reign:
But on the Fall he came in thrall,
And was cast from his height;
The flaming Sword it brandished,
To keep the Tree of Life.
When Adam's Eyes apologiz'd,
No Boon was to be had;
No Penance then could help the Man,
To make him once more glad.
And must I go, from Eden so,
As not to return more,
From this sweet Place, and God of Grace?
O this is very sore.
O might I stay, I would ^bey,
And never more offend:
Who Will intercede, and for me beg,
Eden my Days may end?
Those fragrant Smells, which far excel
The Scents of Lebanon;
And Odours free, on every Tree,
I Will offer God alone. Mr. Norris.

I Will take my Rounds, in Eden's Bounds,
Before I do depart:
Now farewell all, my Joys do fail,
By a deceived Heart.
A public Head, so Adam stood,
As Christ is of his Spouse;
And what he did, as our chief Head,
We did it gain or lose.
None would refuse, but Adam choose
Them for to represent:
O none so fit, nor none so meet,
Whatever the Event.
Therefore let none on God lay blame,
That we in Adam fell:
Had any his Choice, it had been thus,
Pure Reason does us tell.
CHAP. V.
The ARGUMENT.
Adam apologizing for himself, lays the Cause of his Apostasy on his Sovereign
Lord and the Woman, the Woman on the Serpent; a Curse descends on them all. Now
Man being undone by the abuse of his Free Will, has no hopes of any
Restoration, unless the uncreated Being show Man more favor than the fallen
Angels.

THIS Woman see, thou gave me,
Tempted, and I did eat.
O, blame not God, Free Will abused,
Was it thy Soul did cheat.
The Woman vain, she lays the blame,
Upon the Serpent's Guile.
Who to her said, Like unto God
You shall be in a while.
From sinful Lust, Judgment does haste,
On Man and Woman too.
It Is they must die, that loved a Lie
Above a God most true.
The Ground once blessed, with Thorns is cursed,
The Woman bears in sorrow.
And Man must sweat, if Bread he will eat:
The Serpent trails the Furrow.
Thus happy Man, he is undone,
Himself he cannot restore.
O Man's sad Fate, the Devil's State
He Is in for evermore,
Unless some State, that is uncreate,
More pity show to Man,
Than Angels have, whom God will not save,
That from their Maker ran.
CHAP. VI.
The ARGUMENT.
Jehovah seeing his Creature Man undone in the New World, begins to be
concerned how he may be restored, and not for ever lost as the revolted Angels.
He makes a Proposition to the heavenly Hosts to this End; but all stood mute,
until the Son of God broke silence, with the offer of himself to be Man's
Redeemer: Upon which the heavenly Host gave a Shout, with Hallelujah's.

SHALL Man be lost, by Devil's Lust,
And never recovered more?
Shall Devils boast of their Conquest,
And triumph in their Power?
Come heavenly Host, can none suggest
Where such Love can be found?
You Spirits all, who will be mortal,
That Justice may not wound
The Man to Death, I made of Earth;
But may for ever live?
Who Will pity take on his sad State,
For Man himself will give?
Now all stood mute, and silent to it,
A Pause in Heaven's made;
Till one did break the Silence great,
And there it was replied
By God's own Son; What! is there none
That will Compassion show?
I looked when some Seraphim
Would pity Man below.
I God's dear Son, will Man become,
A Man of Sorrow's Death:
This glorious Throne I Will leave anon,
And descend to the Earth,
For to restore this Man so poor,
Unto a better State;
And make him wise, a Paradise
He shall not lose as of late.
Then Heaven rang, the Angels sang,
That splendid Host above;
Who saw such Grace, in God's Son's Face,
And showed Man such Love.
And God did see, his own Decree
From Love to Man he made,
Even from high Eternity,
Which runs not retrograde.
He gave his Son for sinful Man,
That in his stead might die;
And set his Face in our Law-Place,
Us to indempnify.
The Angels shape he does not take,
Nor them redeem to live:
Yet let none speak, thus God is weak,
Or Grace diminutive.
I thee do tell, unsearchable
Is his Beneficence.
Yet know also, he will save but who
His Sovereign Will presents.
CHAP. VII.
The ARGUMENT.
An Apostle extraordinary relates how that Jehovah had a Son, who was to be
born of a Virgin. The great End and Scope of it, was the Redemption of a lost
World.

IF some would know, how Man from Woe
Is brought, and set in Bliss.
A Wonder's wrought, come see God's Thought
In this Analysis.
The Spirit above, sell in much Love,
Upon a Virgin sweet:
To comprehend, or understand
This I do not predict.
But yet that King, and holy Thing,
Which was in Mary's Womb,
Was God indeed, of Abr'am's Seed,
True God, and yet true Man.
Who understands, how God and Man,
Should in one Person dwell?
One Person true, yet Natures two,
But one Immanuel.
His Godhead Rays had dulled our Eyes,
But veiled with humane Flesh.
His Glory's hid, for there is much need
With Man he should converse.
And nothing less, for Man's Trespass,
An angry God can please.
But Righteousness, in humane Dress,
Can his great Wrath appease.
No Diadem, or Hecatomb,
Such large Dimensions has
Of blessed Good, Christ won by Blood,
For those that tread his Path.
CHAP. VIII.
The ARGUMENT.
A Man of God with an ancient Record, signifies the Time and Coming of the
Messiah, and the long Journey he makes to visit a sinful World: And tho he sat
as the Second Person with the Eternal Trine Council in the Court of Celestial
Glory, upon making and redeeming the World, yet is graciously pleased to suffer
hard Things for those who rebelled against his Royal Crown and Dignity.

THE time draws on, the Lord must come,
And Daniel's Weeks shall end.
It Is then some will Messiah kill,
The Sanctuary rend.
And when the Tax, from Cesar's Acts,
Begins for to commence,
Mary goes then to Bethlehem,
From Nazareth went thence.
And in a Stable, it is no Fable,
The Virgin did bring forth
The greatest King ever did reign,
Or will be on the Earth.
This blessed King lies in an Inn,
No Princes Court has he;
But in a Manger, lies in danger,
Exposed to misery.
O blessed Morn, a King is born,
A Virgin-Maid the Mother:
But his Grandsire is God, admire
This Mystery altogether.
But pray from whence did come this Prince?
From Heaven's Council Board,
Where he did sit, in Council great,
Before the World was made. Mr. Milton.

Counsels of Love, in Heaven above,
With Father, Son, and Spirit.
Counsels of Peace, how to release,
Man from his sad Demerit.
In this Compact, Eternal Act,
It was concluded on,
That Man should be the Subject free
Of God's Redemption.
In this Contract, and noble Act,
The Price was fixed upon.
Justice demands no Gold or Lands,
But Godlike Blood for Man.
A Covenant of Suretiship
Christ entered into,
That unto Death would give his Life,
And unto God his due.
So he might reign, and be a King
Over redeemed Man,
His Captain Head for him will bleed,
And in his room will stand.
In this Decree they did agree,
That what the Surety did,
God would impute, from Grace's Root,
As if the Debtor paid.
This Infant God deserves thy Ode,
Come join the Angels Quire;
And from the Altar of thy Heart,
Ascend an hallowed Fire.
To him who left his Royal Court,
And chose a darksome House:
This Majesty lays Glory by,
For to espouse a Curse.
And tho this Man from David sprang,
He Is pure without, within:
And tho is made of Abraham's Seed,
Has no Orig'nal Sin.
Power Infinite can separate
Between the Virgin's Sin,
And Virgin's Seed, for there is need
Christ be a holy Thing.
The Virgin blessed, lays Christ to rest;
Then round the Courtly Stable
Bright harnessed Angels guard the Lord,
While in a Cribbee Cradle.
CHAP. IX.
The ARGUMENT.
A Celestial Messenger, called an Angel, is dispatched from the Throne, to
inform the Shepherds in the Field of the Nativity of the Messiah. The heavenly
Host do unite in their singing Hallelujah's to the most High for sending his
Son to redeem Man. Satan sends a Summons to his Peers to enter into a deep
Council, how he may procure Man's second Revolt, knowing, if he can persuade
Man to rebel against the second Adam, there remains no more Sacrifice for his
Sin.

THE Angels great, much speed do make
To Shepherds keeping Sheep,
And say, Fear not, a Savior great
Is born, O do not weep.
Rejoice, be glad, come joy in God;
In David's City strong
This Day is born, for Man forlorn,
A Savior God and Man.
The heavenly Host do join their Force,
And give Encomiums high,
To God above, who in much Love,
Has sent his Son to die.
Glory to God, the highest Good,
Who sends Peace to the Earth.
Man has that Bliss, the Devils miss,
An Object for his Faith.
Those damned Ones, none them bemoans,
Who lie in deep despair
Of any Good from that just God,
They all revolted are.
From hence in rage, they all engage,
To envy God and Man,
Glory to God; from Man all Good
They Will hinder what they can.
Adam the First Paradise lost,
Where once he sweetly sang:
But was regained by Man's good Friend,
Christ the triumphant King.
He Satan fought, and gained the Fort,
Yea won the Field and Day.
The Woman's Seed did break the Head,
Of Man's grand Enemy.
Satan in spite, he rallies up
His broken Troops dispersed.
A Council calls of black Peers all,
That Man may be distressed.
With our grand Shield, we will gain the Field
The second Adam took.
Come lose no Ground, come be profound,
That Man from God may look.
It Is our Intent, to circumvent
Both Head and Body too:
If we can part Christ and Man's Heart,
That Is all we aim to do.
But he forgot, what was Job's Lot,
And how he failed therein:
Yet is so mad, to set on God,
Who made him of Nothing.
CHAP. X.
The ARGUMENT.
Some Country Shepherds are giving an Account to the Nation of the Jews, what
an Angel had informed them; and of their Journey to Bethlehem, where they found
Joseph and Mary with the Babe, the Infant-God, lying in a Manger.

TO Bethlehem those Shepherds come,
The Wonderful to see: Isa. 9.6.

And found the Lamb, the holy One,
Designed for Calvary.
They told the Jews the Angels News,
Immanuel was come.
Now Admiration fills the Nation,
For this most glorious One.
They found the Babe, the Infant-God,
But in a low Degree:
His God-like Face was full of Grace
To Man in Misery.
CHAP. XI.
The ARGUMENT.
A Man of God gives the Church Information of the Circumcision, and
presentation of Christ, with his Mother Mary 's Purification in the Temple.
Also how a good old Man named Simeon, and a gracious Matron called Anna,
believed that Child to be him of whom the Prophets spoke, should descend from
Abraham and David 's Loins; when probably many great Persons who walked in the
Temple, looked upon this Infant-God only as the Son of a poor Carpenter.

AFTER eight Days they Circumcise
Christ, which presaged much Good,
That came to pass upon the Cross,
Where he shed all his Blood.
The purest Maid, Mother of God,
Above all Women blessed,
Was presented, and purified,
In God's Temple of Rest.
Then Simeon old, being foretold
Of this great Potentate,
With a sweet look of Faith, him took,
And blessed the Lord of State.
And at his Breast, Jesus did rest,
Here Is Love in highest Passion.
He dies in peace, and goes to rest,
On sight of God's Salvation.
Tho rich and great the Temple walked,
When Christ was Circumcised,
To be a King none did know him,
But Ann and Simeon wise.
None did him greet, who was so great,
But on him meanly looked;
Some poor Offspring, far from a King,
A Carpenter's Relic.
But holy Ann, when she came in,
And saw the Babe of Grace;
She did proclaim to every one,
He came of David's Race.
O Israel, you looked well,
In your Jerusalem:
This pretty Babe, in your Arms laid,
Works your Redemption.
It Is Shilo sure, who will allure
All Men by his free Grace.
This is the Root, from David shot,
He has a God-like Face.
The Sage and Wise then heard the Noise,
A Jewish King was born.
They brought sweet Scent from Orient,
Gold, Frankincense, and Balm.
Herod the Great, now full of Heat,
The blessed Messiah's Foe:
He calls the Scribes, of several Tribes,
This Monarch down to throw.
The Wise and Sage, he them did charge,
If they did find the King,
To signify it by and by,
That he might worship him.
But his vile Mind had then designed
A Fact most Tragical.
O Hypocrite, God will thee smite,
Thou Son of Belial.
But those wise Men, they worship him,
And Herod's Laws despise:
For by a Dream, and Star they came
Unto the only Wise.
In Bethlehem, the Babes all then,
From two Years old and up,
Were Martyred all, that Christ might fall;
This was a bitter Cup.
Now Lamentation fills the Nation,
For this inhumame Act:
All Parents cry, and like to die,
Because their Babes are not.
The Governor began to fear,
That Cesar's Time was short;
And Mary's Son would shortly reign,
Their Government subvert.
CHAP. XII.
The ARGUMENT.
A Church is dispatched from the Celestial Canaan, to inform Joseph and Mary in
a Dream of their going to Egypt to avoid the Malice of Herod, who sought the
Death of the young Child; and upon Herod 's Death, signifies, God would have
them return again to their own Land.

NOW on a Time an Angel came,
Who Mary and Joseph tell,
Their Feet must stand on Egypt Land,
Until that Herod fell,
Who quickly dies: so the Angel flies
With all celerity
To Egypt Land, and gives Command
That Joseph go his way:
^or they are dead, all gone and fled,
Which sought the young Child's Life;
and by a Dream informed them,
From the true God of Light.
CHAP. XIII.
The ARGUMENT.
A Messenger of the King of Kings, gives Information how this young King of
Nazareth disputed with, and confuted the Doctors of the Law at 12 Years old. Of
his entering upon his Prophetical Office. He sends John Baptist as his
Harbinger, authorizeth him to Baptize; and about thirty Years of Age was
baptized by him himself, to ful^^^ all Righteousness; the Ordinance confirmed
by the whole Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

WHEN Mary's Son twelve Years had run
The Doctors of the Law
He did dispute, and them confute,
And made them stand in awe.
And now, in fine, sweet Jesus time
Of working does commence;
A Harbinger for to prepare
His way he sends thence.
His Mission is for to baptize,
John Baptist it is I mean;
He them immerst who Sins confessed,
And true Repentance gain.
For to fulfill the Royal Will,
Christ came to Prophet John
To be baptized in any wise,
When thirty Years had run.
Then John him took to Jordan Brook,
And there did him immerse;
He did him dip, because most meet
To fulfill Righteousness.
This was not done to wash off Sin,
Because Messiah's pure:
To Man he is sent a Precedent,
Let it all Men allure.
The glorious Trine did all combine
To witness to this thing.
The Father, Son, and Spirit, as one,
Did honor his Baptism.
CHAP. XIV.
The ARGUMENT.
One of Christ's Learned Disciples informs the Church, that after Jesus was
baptized, he is led into the Wilderness, where the Devil appeared unto him,
probably like some Ancient Man in poor Habit. The Messiah discovered he knew
him, tho under a disguise, to be the Head of the Apostate Angels. Christ not
answering his End in making Bread of Stones, is hurried by Satan out of the
Wilderness through the Air, who sets him upon a Pinnacle of the Temple in
Jerusalem, and from thence carries him to a very high Mountain, where he tempts
his Lord to worship him.

THE Spirit of Bliss in the Wilderness
And Desert Christ does lead,
Among wild Beasts, where are no Feasts;
Full forty Days no Bread.
To God's Son dear there did appear,
In this vast Wilderness,
A gray old Man, with Clothing mean,
As if some Lamb did miss.
To Christ he spoke, Sir, What sad Fate
Has brought you to this Place?
All that come here, do die for Fear
Or Want in a short space.
I speak the more upon this score,
Thou seem to be the Man;
That Man most wise, who was baptized
By new baptizing John.
And that good Man, baptizing John,
Called thee the Son of God:
Which if thou be, come let me see,
And make of Stones some Bread.
Then spoke the King unto the Swain,
Do think I know thee not?
Thou art that Head did thousands lead,
When first thou did revolt.
Then the arch Fiend, who cannot mend,
Confessed he was that Spirit,
Under sad Fate, unfortunate,
Eternal Wrath t'inherit.
Then on a trice he hurries Christ
Out of the Wilderness,
All through the Air, God's Hemisphere,
To put him in distress. Mr. Milton.

A Pinnacle of the Temple
He sat his Judge upon,
The Temple in Jerusalem,
And said, Come cast thee down.
Thou shall not fall, the Angels all
Procession forth will make,
From Heaven high, the Air and Sky,
Death to anticipate.
Thus Beelzebub, Prince of the Club,
King of the damned Crew,
Does tempt God's Son to worship him,
As if it were his due.
Proud Lucifer, he did allure
His God to worship him;
These Kingdoms fine shall all be thine,
Bow now before my Throne.
This was his Scope, and his great hope,
Man's Savior to destroy;
For if the King he made to sin,
No Savior could he be.
Satan be gone, Apollyon,
Worship the Lord thy God,
And do not tempt him God has sent
To bruise thy subtle Head.
The Lord of Bliss was tempted thus,
That simpathize might he,
And succor those against their Foes,
Who are in misery.
Full forty Days he fasts, in praise
Of Power Infinite,
That from our Head we might have Bread
Of Life, of Strength, of Might.
If he God's Son thus set upon,
To bow and worship him,
Then wonder not at Satan's Plot,
That tempts Man to the same.
He tempted Man for to liken
His God to Creatures vile;
Made very fine in glorious Shine;
And thus did him defile.
A Creature cold they 'dorn with Gold,
Who pompous Worship love.
Religion gay, tempts Men to pray
To Devils as God above.
Full well they are known to Heathen Men,
By various Names they gave,
Moloc, Chemos, and Ashtaroth,
Adonis, Thammus brave.
He sets his Seat by God's most great,
Satan's Altar by Jah's;
That Men may moan at his black Throne,
And then at them he laughs.
CHAP. XV.
The ARGUMENT.
An Elder and Witness of Christ, informs the Church of the Messiah entering upon
his Prophetical Office, but is opposed by Men of the same Spirit which opposed
St. Paul; such as Barjesus, and Elimas the Sorcerer, who irrationally asserted
that he wrought Miracles by the Power of the Prince of Devils, Lucifer: but by
his Divine Reply he put them all to silence.

CHRIST rich in Grace began to preach,
And Man illuminate;
In Napthalim and Zebulun,
Commands them to repent:
He makes new Hearts, and Men translates,
From Darkness into Light:
So that his Fame, and fragrant Name,
Were spread both Day and Night.
But Envy rose, among the Jews,
Against the Prince of Light;
They flout and jeer, they domineer
Over his Sovereign Right.
And many said, he friendship had
With Beelzebub the Great;
And in much spite called Nazarite,
The Carpenter's Relic.
That Power cast out the Legions stout,
They say it is Satan's all;
And thus in spite, they 'ppose the Light
Of Spirit, Word, and Soul.
A Kingdom, said our Lord and Head,
Divided cannot stand.
Can Satan cast out Satan? judge:
Come answer my Demand.
From sinful Lust, the Holy Ghost
Against it now they sin;
Which to remit here is not meet,
Nor in the World to come.
If that Men sin against the Son,
And Father of all Light,
He may forgive; but not who live
The Spirit to despite.
Who understand the Lord's good Mind,
And yet in Malice call
The Holy Ghost, and Blood of Christ,
The most unjust of all:
These are the Men, who greatly sin
Against the last Relief.
They cannot repent, whose Hearts are bent,
To Envy and Mischief.
CHAP. XVI.
The ARGUMENT.
A Man of God enters with an Ancient Record, called the Gospel, which gives a
Relation of Christ's sudden departure from Earth to Heaven. Also of his bloody
Sweat in Gethsemain; and of his drinking a horrible Cup of Death, in Obedience
to his Father, and for the Good of Man. Moreover, how one of his own Family
betrayed him into their hands, who belonged to the black Prince of the damned
Crew, and came with Swords and Staves to apprehend Christ, whom they bound with
Cords, and carry him to the Judge as some grand Malefactor.

THE time draws on, Christ must be gone
From Earth to Heaven high.
A Lamb's prepared, we might regard
That it did typify.
Pure Shilo's Fate did intimate,
That Lamb for us must die;
Who had no Spot, yet takes his Lot
To bleed at Calvary.
The Paschal Lamb's Supper being done,
He blessed Bread did break;
Lest we forget Love Infinite,
He gave Command to eat.
And after supt, he took the Cup,
Which also signified,
Blood must be shed, for there is need
Man's Soul be purified.
And gave Command, that Act should stand
Until he come again,
For every Church to practice much,
To show his Death and Pain.
Then after Supper he did utter
A Sign of humble Love,
In washing Feet: Come it is most meet
We follow him above.
They sweetly sing a blessed Hymn,
Before he went to die;
With Heart and Tongue they sweetly sung
The Praise of God most high.
The Lord goes out to Olive Mount,
And Gethsemain also;
Says he, my Soul is sorrowful,
My Griefs no Man does know.
My People wait, I Will invocate
My Father Lord of all,
If I this Cup of Death must sup,
Or pass this Draught of Gall.
But, Lord, thy Will, not mine fulfill,
I came no less to do:
My bloody Sweat, and Sorrow great,
Gives Peace to Greek and Jew.
When he came back, all were asleep;
What cannot you watch one Hour?
Then said the Lord, with one accord,
Watch, pray with all your Power:
Yea every one, no Temptat'on
For you may be too high.
The Flesh is weak, Satan's a Cheat,
Your Trial's very nigh.
Then ushers in the most Obscene
Upon the Lord of Bliss;
Judas that Cheat, betrays in heat
His Master with a Kiss.
With Staves and Sword they take the Lord,
As if a Barrabas:
A Guard most strong they set upon
The Innocent, alas!
Jesus did call, Whom seek you all?
The Man of Nazareth?
It Is I am he, let these go free,
Put none of them to death.
By Power Divine some were struck down,
When they him apprehend:
'Twas Mercy all they did not fall,
And into Hell descend.
Some Sages think, they did not shrink
His Skin to penetrate;
When with a Cord they tie the Lord,
His potent Arms about.
Peter by Sword, as well as Word,
For Christ apologiz'd:
When Malchus Ear he cuts, then fear
Did all his Guard surprise.
Then Christ the Word, would have the Sword
Put up; and Malchus nigh,
To heal his Wound, most safe and sound,
Tho his grand Enemy.
Now to Annas they make him pass,
And hurry him away;
And out of hate interrogate
The Lord about his way.
The Lord said then, my Doctrin's known,
It Is not obscure and hid;
The Temple nigh, where I did pray,
And preach, it open stood.
An Enemy, a stander-by,
Said, Durst thou answer so?
For thy false ways apologize,
The Judge do thou not know?
This King of Grace they smote his Face,
With sordid Heart and Hand:
But this good Man was like a Lamb,
Tho all against him stand.
CHAP. XVII.
The ARGUMENT.
One of the King of Kings Messengers gives an impartial Relation of the
Carriage of the Messiah before his Judges. How he was adjur'd to confess he was
a King. Several false Witnesses swear point blank against him; and he is
sentenced to Death as guilty of Blasphemy, and one that sought the Destruction
of the Government, and dethroning Caesar; and that by a new Doctrine their old
Religion was undermined. But before they led him to Execution, they whipped him
till his sacred Blood ran down his Body.

FROM Annas Christ to Caiaphas Priest,
And Council they him lead;
An Officer calls one to swear,
Tho then there was need:
Yet up starts one against the King,
And swears that he should say,
He could pull down this Temple fine,
And perfect the third Day.
This Lying was for to dispraise
The Lord of Dignity;
Who did not mean the Temple-Stone,
But his own dead Body.
His infinite Power could smite
Down all the Gates of Hell,
If they had been Adamantine,
His Strength does so excel.
Jesus stood mute, did not dispute,
When they did him accuse;
The Brats of Hell in that Council,
Did greatly him abuse.
We thee abjure, if thou be pure,
Make no Equivocation.
Art thou a King, and without Sin?
Come, make a Declaration.
I do not lie, no verily,
You prophesied right;
I am your King, and without Sin,
And have Eternal Might.
When you shall see my Majesty,
Sit at the Lord's right Hand,
You Will mourn full sore, and me implore,
When I reign in the Land.
Upon the same a Voice forth came,
Says Blasphemy he spoke,
Him crucify, for he does lie,
Lead him without the Gate.
Those Vipers spit upon his Lip,
As Men with Mischief rife:
They scoff and jeer, and without fear,
Do strike the Lord of Life.
Come prophesy, thou Prophet high,
Who smote thee on the Cheek:
Can thou descry Physiognomy,
Thou wicked Heretic?
To this we will add, he was made sad,
By Peter's flat denial;
Who then and there did curse and swear,
When Christ was near his Trial.
But one sweet Look from Christ so took,
That Peter's Heart did break,
And bitterly then he did cry,
To see his Faith so weak.
They with him trudg to Pilate Judge,
No Accusations want;
They with their Lies and Calumnies,
Over the Lord do vaunt.
Thou Blasphemer and Conjurer,
Thou wicked Heretic;
Caesar cannot rule, thou call'st him Fool,
Our King do contradict.
Then Pilate says, Who takes an Oath,
Rebellion he did make?
Who now can tell he is culpable
Of ought against the State?
I cannot see Enormity
In this Man does appear;
Preposterous it is for us
To sentence one that is clear.
If you will release one at the Feast,
The Feast of Paschal Lamb;
Determine ye who it shall be,
The Christ, or sinful Man.
It Is Barrabbas we will release,
The other crucify;
Let all his Blood be on our Head,
And on our Children lie.
Some did proclaim, they must arraign
The Lord at Herod's Bar:
The President was glad, and sent
The Galilean there.
Now tho of late Herod the Great,
And Pilate were at strife:
Yet when the Heir comes to their Bar,
They 'gree to take his Life.
Herod the Great said, Operate
Some Wonders in my sight:
My Humor please, or else chastis'd
Thou shall be e're it is Night.
But this sage King, the most Serene,
True God, and only Wise,
Humors him not, in this his Plot,
Tho Rage against him rise.
They him transfer to Pilate's Bar,
Dressed in an Idiot's Coat;
They him degrade, as Fools are made,
And at the Lord do flout.
Then Pilate says, Who takes an Oath?
Let Evidence appear,
Why he must die at Calvary,
As if some Praemunire.
We Will him chastise before your Eyes,
And so let him depart.
No, they reply, him crucify,
We beg with all our Heart.
We Will no King have, but Caesar brave,
He is Legitimate:
Down with this thing, this little King,
Cesar's the Potentate.
Then they him scourge, which made a purge,
Our Souls to clarify:
His sacred Back no stripes did lack,
Before he went to die.
Some think with Rods, others with Cords
Or Wier, he was whipped,
And tied fast unto a Post,
When he was naked stripped.
In Rancor great his Body's beat,
O Adamantine Heart!
They made his Blood run like a Flood,
From Head and every part.
Behold the Man, said Pilate then,
In him no Fault I find:
Away with him, said the Obscene,
To Death he is designed.
The President for Water sent,
To purify his Hands;
See I am clear from his Blood pure,
Upon him lay no Bands.
Pilate may think, that Christ will wink
At this prodigious Sin.
O no, he sat as Magistrate,
And Sentence gave on him.
Who wonder can, that Pilate's Hand
At last himself should hang,
When Is Conscience was so faithful as
To tell him Christ was King?
CHAP. XVIII.
The ARGUMENT.
One of Messiah 's Learned Disciples interposeth with an astonishing Narrative
about his Lord's being led to execution: bound with Cords, and the heavy Cross
fixed on his Back, on which he was crucified, and a strong Guard surrounded him
all the way to Golgotha: And while the Cross was fixing in the Earth, they
unmantle and strip him to his naked Body, which they lift up and nailed to the
Cross, one Foot on the top of the other, with Arms stretched out, being placed
between two Thieves, a Crown of Thorns on his Head, and an Inscription of
Hebrew, Greek and Latin, as the Custom of the Romans was to all they accounted
Malefactors.

THE most high Lord they bound with Cord,
And lead to Calvary;
Fixed on a Cross most ponderous,
On which he was to die.
Upon his Back, like Isaac,
The blessed Type of Christ,
This Cross did lie most heavily,
Tho he was meek and Just.
This Innocent, it is like did faint,
And Humane Nature sail,
Being so sore, with Stripes before,
And had no time to heal.
Another Man, a Syrenian,
At that time coming by,
Must bear the Cross, most ponderous,
On which Christ was to die.
What Wit of Man can now define,
His Sorrow, Grief, and Shame?
Who can dilate, and explicate,
His Misery and Pain?
At the same time the female Kind
Compassion to him show;
To see him thrust, by Men unjust,
A base and fordid Crew.
Jerusalem, the Lord said then,
Weep not for me from hence;
Peccavi cry, your Sins are high,
Your Pride and Ignorance;
Condole, be sad, you were so mad,
As for to imprecate
Innocent Blood upon your Head,
Will make you desolate.
He Calv'ry saw, and Golgotha,
The Crosses situation;
Then Solltude he understood
But for a sinful Nation.
Now being come, Christ stands bound,
Until the Cross be fixed;
With a strong Guard about the Lord,
A bitter Cup they mixed.
Now all the Crew, Roman and Jew,
This blessed One do strip;
Unmantle bare, and plucked the Hair
From off his tender Lip.
He Is naked stripped, as well as whipped,
And all his Body bare,
That ours may be covered most free,
With Righteousness most fair.
Now all in haste they nail him fast,
And hang between two Thieves,
The Scripture's Will for to fulfill,
So Man from Hell he saves.
The Nails were great, in Hands and Feet,
That fixed him to the Tree.
O who can tell what Christ did feel,
And there sustained for thee?
His Hands and Feet they penetrate,
And out the Blood did gush;
For they did tear him with a Spear,
And crowned with thorny Bush.
That Christ was King, the Inscription,
In Hebrew, Latin, Greek;
Did signify to all stood by,
For Pilate thought it meet.
Over his Head this Paper stood,
That all might read the same:
He was the King of Jewish Men,
Tho they did him defame.
Before he dies, he opes the Eyes
Of a most wretched Sinner;
Who owned him King, believed in him,
As the God-Man Redeemer.
Remember, Lord, to me be good,
When in thy Kingdom-State.
By my free Grace to Paradise,
This day I Will thee translate.
They him exhaust, and now do boast,
Our Grief he bore it all;
The weight of Sin was laid on him,
To save a precious Soul.
When he would ease his tortured Feet,
By hanging on his Hands;
They must be in prodigious pain,
This Reason understands.
And when he eased his tortured Hands,
By resting on his Feet,
His Body's weight, where e're it met,
Must make the Patient sick.
God's holy Son, tho God and Man,
Of Sorrow must be full:
On him did lie much Misery,
God's Wrath did fill his Soul.
The Lord at last cries out, I thirst,
The Prophets to fulfill;
A Vin'gar sponge they gave his Lungs,
So he had not his Will.
Water was scant, he must it want,
We might have plenitude
Of living Streams, come from his Reins:
O Love not understood!
Could Mary then of Magdalen,
Have had her own desire,
Her Tears should quench her Savior's Thirst,
Whose Heart was on a fire.
A Flame of Love to him above,
To all Men did appear;
Where she did weep, and wash his Feet,
And wiped them with her Hair.
Now at this time the Soldiers game
For Jesus seamless Coat;
For to fulfill the sacred Will,
That Will to consummate.
The direful Curse was ponderous,
The Malediction high;
Which made him cry, Ely, Ely,
Lama sabachthany.
I am content for to be empt
Of all my Sacred Blood;
So I my Flock inoculate
By Faith into their Head.
The Guilt of Man I Will fasten on
This cursed Cross and Tree:
Justice Divine shall have a Fine,
To set the Guilty free.
I Will bury all their Guilt and Thrall,
Both in the Grave, and deep:
Yea, all the high Iniquity
Of my free chosen Sheep.
Then some obscene said to the King,
Physician save thy self:
If that thou be God's Son most free,
Recover now thy Health.
The Mother stood nigh by the Wood,
I mean the wooden Cross,
On which did hang her precious Son,
Till all his Blood was lost.
What Tears of Blood could she have shed,
His Sorrow to prevent:
To see those Hands, healed many Wounds,
So pierced, torn and rent?
His glorious Head ran purple Blood,
His Feet and Side the same.
But his Free Grace that him debased,
Is his immortal Fame.
Those bloody Eyes they cannot suffice,
Those Sluices are too small,
His Sorrow to give vent unto,
Hence from his Pores Blood falls.
He saw a Scrowl, a dismal one,
Of Sins present and past,
And Sins to come, he must atone,
For all from first to last. Mr. Norris.

His Love most sweet and bloody Sweat,
Did wipe off all the Score.
Some moments Pain makes him to reign,
Eternal Ages sure.
And as he hung before the Sun,
His Virgin Mother saw
His Gore-blood Eyes, and heard his Cries
To God, Abba, Abba.
Into thy Hand my Spirit ascend,
My Work is finnished:
All Debts are paid, Books cancelled,
Justice is satisfied.
Now Christ is dead, they brake no Leg,
The Scripture may fulfill;
Yet by their Hate hangs dislocate,
Unjoint from Head to Heel.
Upon the same great Darkness came
All over the Hemisphere.
The Rocks did rent, the Graves were empt;
Thus Wonders did appear.
The Temple-Vail was rent in twain,
Then soon they understood
He was God's Son, tho also Man,
From thence infer was God.
The Heathens all that Day condole,
And eloquently said,
Surely the God of Nature's dead,
Or final End has made.
O this great World to Dust he will hurl,
For hanging on the Cross
The Quintessence of all Goodness;
O Act preposterous.
CHAP. XIX.
The ARGUMENT.
A Friend of the Messiah 's signifies what happened after the Lord's Death. A
Counselor at Law begs his Body, and inters it with sweet Spices. The great
Council gives order for a strict Watch, a Seal and Stone to be set on the
Sepulcher. Now Beelzebub triumphs to see Christ dead, and in some hopes
conquered for ever. But the third Day he arose from the Grave, to the Confusion
of all the Devils: And after forty Days upon the Earth, ascends to Heaven from
Mount Olivet, in the view of his Apostles; but first gave them his Benediction,
and on the Day of Pentecost sent down the Holy Ghost; and from the Power of
this Spirit his Disciples go on in the World conquering, by preaching Jesus of
Nazareth to be the Son of God.

OF Pilate Head, Joseph did beg
The Body of the Just;
And did inter the Lord with Myrrh,
As says the Holy Ghost.
As Man at first did prove unjust,
In Eden Paradise;
The blessed King in a Garden,
Acquits the Man on wise.
The Watch was strong, they sat upon
The Grave where Christ did lie,
For to prevent the Lord's Intent
Of rising the third Day.
The Sepulcher they made most sure,
With Watch, a Stone, and Seal,
For to prevent the Lord's Intent,
But they in all do fail.
When Christ was dead, then Beelzebub
Did triumph, and thus speak,
I conquered have unto the Grave,
God's Christ of mighty State.
It Is I am King, and triumphing.
Who will my Subjects be?
And Christ deny, whom I defy,
He Is overcome you see.
Who would serve him, a conquered one?
Obey me, it is no sin:
Cast off his Name, it is horrid shame
To own one dead your King.
What Revel-rout in Hell throughout,
When they thought all was won,
And Christ laid low, see how they crow
In hopes that all is their own.
Now Lucifer ascends his Chair,
And mounts his gloomy Throne:
The hellish Guard flock round their Lord,
And vaunt, he is King alone.
Now the black King began to sing,
Although in Flames arrayed;
And thus began the hellish Song,
When to his Peers he said;
Dominions, Thrones, Powers unknown,
I claim all as my Right: Mr. Wesley.

I Have gained the Field, Jesus did yield,
And he is conquered quite.
I do not fear him called the Heir,
Immortal some him thought:
But now he is dead, he is gone and fled,
And never to life be brought.
The Devils in pomp, and great triumph,
Appear now Christ is dead:
The Oracle's Head come fill with speed,
The World may be misled.
The Hebrew Child no Sword can weild,
He Will conquer you no more:
Let Us march from Hell, in Heaven we will tell
Of our all-conqu'ring Power.
And conquer there as well as here,
Who can before us stand?
Now God is dead I will be Head,
In Heaven, Sea and Land.
While Satan spoke with lofty state,
In came the Glorious One,
With all the Marks, victorious Acts
Of a triumphing King.
While Beelzebub with his black Club,
Did vaunt, yea, scoff and boast;
Came starting in the powerful King,
And Guards from God of Hosts.
This glorious Guard surround the Lord,
Like warlike Angels stand,
To smite to Hell great Belial,
And all against him band.
Who is this here does domineer,
And boast of Victory
Over God's Son, the holy One,
Who lives although did die?
I have the Keys of Hell and Death,
Who am the First and Last:
All Potentates, and powerful States,
To me shall yield or taste
Unmixed Wrath, as my Word says,
Which they can never bear,
Nor dwell in ever-burning Lakes,
Or the devouring Fire.
O how confused, and how amazed
The Devils all do stand:
Satan flies down his Iron Throne,
To flee from Jesus Hand.
The Devils fled from Christ their Head,
And from his terrible Wrath:
But Christ pursues his scoffing Foes,
Through their black horrid Path.
The Devils knew, that Christ the true,
Had broke their Gates and Walls;
And conquered Death, and all the Earth,
So into Hell he falls.
And now the Word of God's made good,
The Serpent's Head is bruised;
Christ he has trod upon his Head,
Which makes him thus confused.
Then Satan spoke with horrid hate,
What tho I conquered am?
Be just if sent, and don't torment
Your Foes before the time.
And now in Chains he them confines
Unto the Judgment-Day.
All Powers must bow before his Brow
Who does the Scepter sway.
Christ he Death's Bands broke with his Hands,
And in triumphing manner
He did arise, tho Enemies
Stood round with Guard and Banner.
Yea, that strong Guard upon the Lord,
Did tremble like dead Men:
The Earth did quake, their Hearts did shake
To see him rise again.
And at the Grave, an Angel brave,
That shined as the Sun,
Did roll away the Stone that Day
The Lord did rise upon.
And that day's Morn good Women mourn,
About the Sepulcher;
Jesus you seek, pray do not weep,
The Angel said, Don't fear:
Rather rejoice, lift up your Voice,
Christ from the Grave is gone;
In Galilee you may him see,
The Living he is among.
The Lord did show himself most true,
After he did arise;
The Signs were all infallible,
He was in no disguise.
And for to put all out of doubt,
No Spirit did appear;
Come touch, said he, and handle me,
My Flesh and Bones most pure.
After he rose, and vanquished Foes,
An Apparition's made
To Magdalen in a Garden,
By Jesus Christ the Lord.
The Gardener then she thought upon,
Till that Christ Mary said,
O Rabboni! she did reply,
My King, my Lord, my Head.
Mary touch not thy Lord as yet,
Till I to God ascend:
Then me embrace by Faith, which Grace
Will all the Saints commend.
But poor Thomas, his Faith's amiss,
He will not believe it is he,
Unless the print, where the Nails went
Into his Body, he see.
A just Reproof of, s Unbelief,
The Lord gave when he said,
Most blessed is him, who has not seen,
And yet believed his God.
The Scripture says, if we have not Faith
In the rising again
Of Christ our Head, we all are dead,
And damned every one.
Then Preaching's vain, and Faith's no Gain,
If Christ be in the Grave;
God's Justice Good not satisfied,
So Pardon none can have.
The Church did meet, and God did seek
Upon the Week's first Day;
Where Christ among them often came,
To cheer them in his Way:
And gave Commands, into the Hands
Of his Apostles dear,
How they should act in every part,
Till he again appear.
E're Christ ascends, he gave Commands,
That at Jerusalem,
At Wisdom's Gate they may expect,
The Spirit promised them.
Now Christ ascends before his Friends,
From Earth to Heaven high;
From whence he will come, e're it be long,
To fetch his Bride away.
Christ clears the Air, and Hemisphere,
Where damned Spirits dwell;
He clears the Path for Saints on Earth,
To Joy Celestial.
Disperse you Orbs, you glittering Clouds,
At distance roll away:
His glorious Guard the Way prepared,
On Christ's Ascension-Day.
The Angels high above the Sky,
Spoke unto them below;
What happy King is this you bring?
In triumph he does go.
Who is this King, this glorious One?
And what may be his Name?
The Lord of Hosts, he is known by most,
His Victory gives him Fame.
Lift up ye Gates, ye Doors of State,
And entertain your King:
Come stand wide open in Heaven's Court,
Ye Gates everlasting.
He comes who has conquered the Grave,
And drags the King of Pride,
Fastened unto his Chariot new,
In which the Lord does ride
Triumphantly, to Bliss on high;
His Chariot moved fast
To Heaven's Gate, where many wait,
And thousands cry, Haste, haste.
This Prince of State, when Heaven's Gate
He had arrived unto;
O what a Shout is given out
By Angels as his due!
And with his Crown went in, sat down
Close by his Father's Side;
And will prepare a Palace there
To entertain his Bride.
He Is now gone home to wear his Crown,
For all his Work is done.
God's satisfied, Enemies subdued,
And now ascends his Throne.
Now Christ is gone, the Spirit does come
On the Rebellious.
The Sinner's Head is captive led,
And Gifts are given us.
On Pentecost the Spirit did rest,
In cloven Tongues, upon
The Messengers of Jesus Christ,
Because he was gone home.
He does inspire, baptize with Fire,
Prophets, Apostles too:
He Will Pastors give, the Church may live
A holy Life and true.
Poor Fishermen go conquering on
The World in Jesus Name.
The Blind do see, the Dead raised be
To Christ's eternal Fame.
If Christ did show his Godhead true,
When in a swaddling Clout, Mr. Milton.

Controlled the Crew of damned Hue,
In all the World about;
He will much more his Power declare,
Ascended now on high;
Captivity he captive led
In his triumphant Day.
This Hebrew Child, tho meek and mild,
Made Devils loudly roar,
On Mountains steep, in Valleys deep,
On all the Seas and Shore.
All Oracles dumb, no hideous Hum,
No mighty Trance or Spell:
Apollo's Shrines no more Divine's,
Nor no Prophetic Cell.
The Flamins quaint at Altars faint,
In consecrated Grove;
Because no Sound does there rebound
From their-sweet Object Jove.
All Temples dumb, Peor, Baalim,
And mooned Ashtaroth:
No Tapers shine, none can divine;
Hence Beelzebub is wroth.
Now Moloc's fled, that Idol's dead,
Isis and Osiris,
From Judah's Land, the Infant's hand
Laid low the Heathen Priests.
Each fettered Ghost slips to his Post,
To the Infernal Jail;
Who go in Troops, their Malice shoots
Back to the God of all;
Who comes, who comes, in glor'ous Blooms,
From Edom and Bozrath;
In whose Brow high is Majesty,
And treads untrodden Paths.
Glory surrounds his Body's Bounds,
There Is Terror in his Face: Mr. Norris.

The Evening Sky, the Scarlet Dye,
His Robes cannot debase;
They are so red with God-like Blood,
And Blood of Enemies;
They are much stained with Conquest gained,
And blessed Victories.
I mighty One, it is I do come,
That treads the Press alone
Of Wrath Divine, such Power is mine,
I will have help from none.
It Is I can speak my Foes to death,
And that in Righteousness:
Almighty I can save most high,
From Hell to Heaven's Bliss.
It Is I alone go conquering on,
By my great Power and Strength;
And Blood runs over my Garments pure,
My People might have Health.
It Is I outvie the Scarlet Dye,
And make my Garments red,
Like those Men that do tread the Fat
And Wine Press for the Blood.
I wear those Clothes, red like the Rose,
To save some, some destroy:
By shedding Blood, I bruise one's Head,
And God do satisfy.
The Day is come, that signal One,
And Death shall have its Doom;
The Kingdoms dark I will subvert,
And conquer every One.
No Sea of Blood but Christ's most good,
The Enemy could spoil:
And we are glad, Christ's bloody Flag
Does flourish over all.
The Cher'bims Guard of the High Lord,
Stood by while Christ did fight;
His Father true forsook him too,
Yet he the Field did get.
My Fury strong supports me long,
And with my single Arm,
The Conquest's won, Salvation's come
To mine that none can harm.
CHAP. XX.
The ARGUMENT.
This Chapter contains an Account of a triumphant Song to the Lamb, by the
Saints of the Old and New Testament, for Christ's most glorious Conquest over
his and the Church's Enemies, in his Resurrection and Ascension.

WITH Deborah we will sing to Jah,
Who has avenged me,
And trod down Strength; his Arm has length
To spoil his Enemy.
When he marched on, the Enemy strong
Did tremble in the Earth;
And in the Field he made them yield,
As Holy Scripture says.
Wake Deborah, awake with Mirth,
A Song of. Triumph sing:
Our Barak Head Captivity led
A Captive, tho a King.
Proud Sisera must stand in awe,
The Stars in Heaven fight;
The great Jael has conquered Hell,
And put his Foes to flight.
Come to our King, with- Israel sing,
The Lord's a Man of War:
He gloriously triumphs on high,
And leads his Enemies far.
Pharaoh of Hell that proud Rebel,
His Chariots overthrew;
His great Captains, and chosen Ones,
Their Strength could not renew.
They proudly said, Pursue the Head,
Fight not with Small or Great,
But Israel's King, strike most at him,
Then we shall them defeat.
Come draw your Sword, upon my Word,
My Lust I will fulfill;
I will divide the Spoil, his Pride
Shall not go conquering still.
The Sea arose upon his Foes,
And in it they did sink;
A Sea of Wrath, wherein no Path
Can find from it to shrink.
Who can compare with this most Fair,
Glorious in Holiness,
And fearful in the praise of Men?
His Wonders cannot cease:
Now Hannah sung, we will prolong,
Our Honor he exalts;
Against our Foes his Power flows,
They may not proudly talk,
The mighty One is broken down,
And weak Ones girded are;
The Prince brought down from a high Throne,
The Poor exalted there.
Come, Esa's Song we will prolong,
To our beloved King,
That us has made his sweet Vineyard,
Who were but Lumps of Sin;
And fixed it in a fruitful Hill,
Where Showers fall Divine;
A Tower great he made in it,
And on it Christ does shine.
He does it watch, his Vineyard rich,
It Is done both Night and Day:
A fiery Wall is round them all,
Against the Beasts of Prey.
May Zion say, in a good Day,
Tho thou wast angry, Lord,
With me for Sin, through Christ our King,
Thy Favor is restored.
Behold, my God does Help afford,
He is Salvation;
Who shall I fear? Jehovah's near,
My Trust, my Strength, my Song.
Therefore in Faith let us draw with Mirth,
From God's Salvation-Wells,
Those living Streams, Christ's bloody Veins
Did purchase for Rebels.
In this good Day, we all will say,
Praise, praise the Lord alone;
Exalt his Name, and spread his Fame,
For great's the holy One.
In Zion's Land, his mighty Hand
Is stretched out to save
His Israel, where he does dwell,
Whom to his Son he gave.
Well is it said, in God's sure Word,
Excellent Things does he:
It Is showed forth in all the Earth,
God for his Church will be.
Sing and cry out, come give a Shout
Of Hallelujah's high
To Jehovah, begun on Earth,
But lasts Eternity.
The Prophet old, when he foretold
Death should be swallowed up
In Victory, by one on high,
Then he this Song did put
Unto the Church, to triumph much
On that triumphant Day:
Eternal Gates, stand open in state,
That Saints then enter may.
This City strong they enter in,
Salvation is their Wall,
And Bullwarks too; none can subdue
And make this City fall.
As Mary's Song, when Gabriel came,
The Angel her did tell,
And her salute, and kindly greet,
With News that did excel;
That she should bear the glorious Heir
Of Heaven, and of Earth;
In her pure Womb should lie God's Son,
As holy Scripture says.
Then she brake out with holy Shout
Of Praise, to magnify
The Lord above, who in much Love
Had filled her Soul with Joy.
What Wonders here, that I should bear
A Savior unto Man!
That I so poor, God great in Power,
Should set his Love upon!
And me exalt, with all my Faults,
Above all Women high;
No Queen he took this King to suck,
Or bear in her Body:
But me poor Maid he did regard,
To his eternal Praise,
I bore the King who had no Sin,
One of eternal Days.
With Zachary, the Lord on high,
Let us ever extol,
For visiting and redeeming
His People from all thrall.
A Horn of Power, and a strong Tower
Of great Salvation,
For us has raised; eternal Praise
The Lord shall wait alone.
Now are made good the Prophet's words,
Spoke since the World began:
God's Covenant stood, his Mercy's good,
He sent to us his Son,
To save us from the Proud and Strong,
Yea all our Enemies,
In Righteousness and Holiness,
To serve him all our Days.
That good Dayspring does Knowledge bring
Of Sins remission free,
And blessed Light, and Peace in sight,
To those in Darkness lay.
With Simeon old, let us be so bold,
To take the Lord of Glory;
In Arms of Love, tho high above
Heaven's Superior Story.
And praise him too, for it is his due,
And tell him we can die
Peace and Rest, because the best
Of Objects now we see.
Our Eyes have seen the blessed One,
Hid from great Potentates.
The Gentiles Light, he is most bright,
And Israel's Glory great.
Now triumph Saint, the Lord he went
Unto Mount Calvary;
Suffered the Cross, and bore the Curse
For Man's Felicity.
^or surely by his Poverty
The Poor are very rich;
And by his Shame they have great Fame,
No earthly Monarch such.
We were set free, for bound was he
Unto the Post and Cross;
Great Grief he had, we might be glad
Our Crown cannot be lost.
from Heaven's room the Son came down,
We all might there ascend:
God Man became, he might regain
That Love which has no End:
No House had he, tho of Heaven free,
We may have one above,
Not made with Hands, or Men's Commands,
But by God's Power and Love.
God in the dark seemed to forsake
His own eternal Son;
We might have Light, splendid and bright,
And ever with him dwell.
A Wonder's here, God's Son most dear,
Had less ground to expect
The Shines of God, when that he di'd,
Than Saints of either Sex.
He Is in the Dark to purchase Light,
From hence forsaken too:
Saints may expect (tho Christ did not)
God's Shines their Dying-day.
Lord, we a Song will sing, as long
As an Eternity.
O King of Days, it is endless Praise
Is still thy Childrens cry.
What tho we stand in a strange Land,
A Babel Wilderness,
Our Harps will tune to the Renown
Of him who is Lord of Hosts.
As traveling on to Mount Sion,
Our House, our Place, our Home;
As going on, we'll sing our Song
To him upon the Throne.
Who can but sing, the Lord will come?
Methinks he is at the Door;
Faith sees him stand, now just at hand,
My Soul be sad no more.
With David sing, and Offerings bring;
Let all the Saints of God
Rejoice in him, that makes them
Most glorious by his Blood.
Upon your Bed, sing to your Head,
Declare his noble Acts;
For this will be-eternally
The Work of Tongue and Hearts.
O let us sing the Lamb's sweet Song,
Cry, Great and marvel us
Are all thy Works, Lord God of Hosts,
Almighty, true and just!
And with Saint John, we will praise the Lamb,
The Prince and King of Earth,
Who loved us, and washed us
With his own Blood through Faith.
To God most wise give all due Praise,
Glory and Majesty;
Dominion great, a Prince's Seat
He has above the Sky.
Let Us give henceforth Hallelujah,
Salvation, Honor too;
With that Voice came out from the Throne,
Praise God his Servants do.
O King of Saints, all Nations faint
At thy just Judgment, Lord;
Who shall not fear, and thee revere,
And spread thy Fame abroad?
Thou worthy art to have the Heart,
Because all Things thou have made,
For thine own Will, and Glory still;
Hence it is we give thee Laud.
Let Heaven and Earth their Praise set forth,
And Hallelujahs sing,
For our high God, and mighty Lord,
Remains a conquering King.
CHAP. XXI.
The ARGUMENT.
An Evangelist shows whence it was that so much Shame and Pain fell on an
innocent Person, by striking the Name of the Debtors out of the black and
bloody Bond of the Law, and inserting his own. What a long Journey he came to
redeem and marry poor Leprous Beggars. And what bloody Battles he fought to
gain this poor contemptible Worm, and how he invested her with an Eternal
Kingdom of Glory, from his last Will and Testament.

WHO Inquest-makes, Interrogates,
The Scribe which here indites?
If he can show, why all this Woe
Fell on the Lord of Light?
I Will take from thee Prolixity,
In a Compendium show,
That thee and I made him to die,
Who was Messiah true:
His Cheeks we smote by our proud Heart,
And Hair eradicate;
His Hands and Feet Nails penetrate,
He might us happy make.
I say again, thy Sin and mine
Procured all this Woe;
The thorny Crown makes Blood run down,
From Head to Feet below.
We him did strip, and also whip,
The Spear ran in his Side;
The Travail of his Soul did make
An Enemy his Bride.
Come Malefactor, evil Actor,
Make one believing look:
What all pass by, none cast an Eye
On me who am forsook
Of my dear God, my precious Lord?
And purely for your sake
I left my Weal inscrutable;
I might you happy make.
My Hand I struck, with God who took
My Covenant and Bail,
That I might see the Debtor free
From the Infernal Jail.
Men ought repent, they ever went
To take a Surety's Place;
But I did long the Day were come,
Tho suffered much Disgrace.
Your Names struck out the legal Book,
That Book and bloody Bond,
My Name I insert with all my Heart,
So I stand only bound.
I who am just, God did arrest
Your Substitute for all;
And God accounts the Sinner just,
And Christ the Criminal.
I paid Man's Debt by bloody Sweat,
In Prison also lay;
But afterward had a Discharge
On the Resurrection Day.
O Men admire free Grace the higher,
For Love distinguishing,
That you might live, an Object have
For Faith, tho Devils none.
No Gospel Light before their sight,
Men no Commission have
To preach in Hell the pure Gospel,
He only Men will save.
Surely Success we should not miss,
That are Ambassadors.
If we could preach, and Devils teach,
Their Pardon Christ procures.
But now we preach, our Hands we stretch
In vain the whole long day,
And call upon the Sons of Men
To haste and come away
To Jesus Christ the Chief and Best;
But Sinners will not hear:
So Unbelief makes them the Chief
Of Sinners, will appear;
Yea greater than the Devil's Sin,
Or Man's in Paradise,
For neither of them did rebel
Against redeeming Grace.
CHAP. XXII.
The ARGUMENT.
The Spouse of Christ interposeth with the admiration of his Love, the
Quantity, and immense Treasures thereof, having no Bank nor Bottom. The Nature
of it is free. All Sinners may fill their Vessels from this Pipe; which is more
comfortable than the most fragrant Wine, and so powerful, that it draws the
Heart to Christ, as a Loadstone the Mass of Steel.

WHAT mavelous rich Love is this,
That such a cursed Race
As we came from, should sit among
The Children of his Grace!
Our Fathers sure, the Hittites were,
Our Mothers Amorites:
A cursed Race, yet by free Grace
In those the Lord delights.
None us beheld when in the Field,
All wallowing in our Blood;
None pitied us under this Curse,
But the Samar'tan good.
He casts an Eye, when passed by,
And said, Live Infant, live;
When in our Blood, he was so good,
His saving Grace to give;
And threw his Skirt on our foul Heart,
To hide our Nakedness:
This is the Time of Love, the Time
He gave us Righteousness.
A Covenant wherein's no Want,
With Sinners made when poor,
To be his own he gave his Son,
The Covenant to ensure.
We washed are with Water pure,
And with the best of Blood,
Blood's washed away with Blood that Day
Death seized the Son of God.
God did appoint them to anoint
With his most precious Oil:
They decked are with Silk and Hair,
All clean, no longer foul.
A Chain of Gold, the Worth's untold,
Is put about her Neck;
The Linen white, and broidred Work
Does her most lovely deck.
Upon her Hands the Bracelet stands;
Her Head with Jewels set,
And on the same a glorious Crown:
With Earrings she is bedect.
And she did eat the finest Wheat,
And sweetest Honey too;
She Is beautiful, and does excel
The most Self-righteous Jew.
Now her Renown, and glorious Fame,
Goes through the Heathen Land:
She prospers in a blessed Kingdom,
Which never will have End.
Her Comeliness is Righteousness,
But this the Lord puts on;
And Comely through his Comeliness,
Glory to Grace alone.
This Spouse excels in glorious smells
Myrrh, Alloes, Cashia;
Her Garments fine a sweet Perfume
Do cast forth every way.
Within, within the Glory's seen,
In the King's Daughter true;
Wrought Gold's her Garb, most richly laid,
The Bridegroom wears it too:
At whose right Hand the Queen does stand,
In Gold of Ophir fine:
Her Beauty great makes Christ to speak,
Thy Beauty is Divine.
The Father just his Son did trust,
Before his Incarnation,
In saving those, to Heaven goes,
In every Land and Nation.
The Son most just the Father trusts,
That he Salvation give
All the Elect, who have their Debt
Paid long before they live.
Their Debt did pay and satisfy,
Some hundred Years before
They Being had, by Christ his Blood,
Or e're they ran in score.
What Is requisite, and what is most meet
In any Advocate,
Is found in Christ, the Meek and Just,
The only Potentate:
Who does delight to see the Spite
And Disagreement end,
Between the King and Men for Sin,
Therefore his Blood did spend.
He Is just and meek, yea very sweet,
Most powerful and true;
And brings God down to love the Man,
And Man to God does go.
The Levites pass, the Priests make haste
From us, sweltring in Blood:
But the good Man, Samaritan,
Stood still to do us good;
And in the Soul did pour in Oil,
So healed the Wounds of Sin;
And rather than his Soul should pine,
His Blood he poured in.
He covers all, our Shame and Fall,
With Robes of Righteousness:
And gives to Man a glorious Ring,
To seal them up to Bliss.
The fatted Beast is killed, to feast
Those starving Souls of ours:
O Lamb of God, thy Blood was shed
In an accepted Hour.
We Syrians poor, and Strangers were,
In a most forlorn Plight,
Lay at thy Door of Grace full sore,
In Darkness without Light:
Yet said thou, Live, my Grace I give
To thee, besmeared with Blood:
Live, Infant live, my Son I give,
To be thy Prince and Head;
An Head of Sense and Influence,
Is to his Body dear:
As from the Root the Branches shoot,
So Christ the Church does bear.
His Lambs he will feed, a tender Head,
One Member if but ill,
A Balsam made of his own Blood,
Does from the Heart distill,
As Branches dry, and also die,
Which from the Vine are cut;
So every Saint would quickly faint,
And die, if from the Root.
As many Branches make one Vine,
And many Grains one Loaf;
So many Men one Body frame,
Unite to Christ by Faith:
Who gave himself for our Souls Health,
That Is more than Heaven high
Ten thousand times; ten thousand Tens,
Come let us for him die.
A Journey long, through Storms a throng,
Christ came to visit thee;
His Head with Drops, and Dew his Locks
Did wet, he might thee see.
Tho Mankind had some Lovers bad,
When he the Question put;
He gave his Dove excelling Love,
By which their Hearts he took:
But waited long, with Patience strong,
For Floods cannot quench his Love;
Repulses strong, often and long,
Could not make him remove.
This Bridegroom wrought, great Battles fought,
To him none equal be:
Few Husbands win their Bride and Kin
By Blood, as he did thee. Mr. Delaun.

Earrings of Gold, Riches untold,
He clothes his Bride withal;
His Spouse does dress with Righteousness,
To beautify the Soul.
And from all Debts they are acquit,
By Marriage of the King;
Who will invest his with the Best,
A Kingdom without Sin.
What Monarchs known to leave his Throne,
For Leprous and Diseased?
And tho forlorn, and filled with Scorn,
Yet he with those is pleased.
Some Bridegrooms change, new Lovers gain;
And cast the old away:
But he loves first, unto the last,
Yea to Eternity.
The Mother dear, her Son most near
She sooner can forget,
Than a Convert, with changed Heart,
Out of his Love can slip.
The Mountains fast, they all shall haste
From their most fixed Place,
Before that he will thee deny,
Who art in Cov'nant-Grace.
If any can the Heavens span,
And measure Sea and Land;
Then Flesh and Sin, and Satan's Gin,
May pluck them from his Hand.
If Moon so bright, and Stars oth' Night,
Their Course can change and slip;
Then may his Love decline his Dove,
Whom he keeps while they sleep.
If he can drown the World again,
Against his fixed Decree:
Then may his Love from thee remove,
Which none shall ever see.
So we from Justice were discharged
Upon his dying Day.
He like a Lamb most patiently,
Unto the Slaughter's led,
And drunk the bitter Cup of Death,
Without a murmuring Word.
Before the Judgment Seat he stood,
A Prisoner at the Bar:
And by his Judgment we are freed,
Who wretched Prisoners were.
His Generation is so Great,
Noble, Eternal too!
None can declare the Number of
His Sons and Daughters true.
In shedding of his precious Blood,
A numerous Offspring has,
Which none can number nor declare,
For they fill Heaven and Earth.
And tho no Violence did act,
Yet he must make his Grave
With wicked and ungodly Men,
For such he came to save.
It pleased God his Son to bruise,
An Offering he might give,
To have a glorious Church on Earth,
And with him ever live.
As Eve came out of Adam's Side,
So did the Church from Christ;
She is the Travail of his Soul,
For whom he groaned much.
But Satisfaction great has he,
After his trav'lling Soul;
For his Seed he will justify,
By knowing Christ their All.
A Portion with the Great he will have,
And with the Strong divide
The Glory of his conquering Strength,
In spite of Hellish Pride:
Because he poured forth his Soul
To Death, both frank and free,
And took it up in three Days time,
So got the Victory.
And now triumphantly is gone,
Into the Heavens high,
Having Captivity captive led,
It Is like his Majesty.
And there does Intercession make
For all whose Sins he bare;
And will not cease his glorious Work,
Until they with him are.
Our Ark of Love, which saves thy Dove,
Thou art, O Lord, most strong,
When deluged all the World beside,
Th^^ ^^^'dst thy Church (...)
Our Jacob's Ladder, by which God
Does friendly visit us,
And we ascend upon the same,
Immanuel, God with us.
Our Isaac art, who bore the Cross,
And felt the sharpened Sword,
In whom the Nations all are blessed,
According to thy Word.
Our blessed Joseph, who was sent
From Canaan heavenly,
Unto the Egypt of this World
For Food, we might not die.
Our fiery cloudy Pillar art,
In this dark Wilderness:
Our Joshua does us conduct
Unto the Land of Rest.
Our Rock of Ages, Lord, thou art,
Smote both by God and Man:
The Emanation of thy Blood
And Streams were seen by John.
Our feasting Passover also,
The spotless Lamb was slain;
The sprinkling of the Soul by Blood,
Prevents a sinful Reign.
Our brazen Serpent we behold,
Whenever stung with Sin;
From that Disease delivered are,
Which else would end in Hell.
Our Jubilee, accepted Year,
Was the Year of thy Death;
We heard the Gospel-Trumpet sound
True Joy, and free from Wrath.
Our Mercy-Seat, and Throne of Grace,
The great Propitiatory;
From which the Father kindly speaks,
Poor Sinners here is Glory.
The Mercy-Seat above the Ark,
And Tables of the Law,
Did figure Mercy triumphing,
Over Justice which we saw.
The Altar, Priest, and Sacrifice:
As Priest, both Man and God;
As Altar, God, who sanctifies;
As Man, the Offering's good.
The rich and holy Vail thou art,
Thy Body's Vail was rent:
So we into the holy Place
May have a free ascent.
The Manna in the Wilderness,
Tho called Angels Food,
Is far unlike that feeds the Soul,
The Gospel-Feast is Blood,
Which here below we feed upon,
In this sad Wilderness;
But when once got to Canaan's Land,
We feed no more as thus.
Yet as the Jew could not forget
The Manna Miracle;
No more can Saints forget in Bliss,
God's Wonders there to tell.
Our Shiloh, and safe Maker art,
And Jacob's Star also;
The Laver where poor Lepers wash,
And blessed Fountain too,
That Is opened for Jerusalem,
And Judah's Guilt to wash;
And all the Gentiles that repair
To him for Righteousness.
The Shewbread Table did hold forth,
In God's House is no want:
The Lord is always with his Flock,
His Table is not scant.
Our Altar of Perfume, O Lord,
And golden Censor art;
The Cloud of spiced Incense sweet
Perfumes the Mercy-seat.
O Lord, our Sin, and Peace-off'ring,
Jonah cast in the Sea,
To still the Storm of Wrath Divine,
Man in it may not lie.
Our Temple, Tabernacle true,
Which God did pitch, not Man;
The Godhead dwelt in humane Flesh,
Is the Temple I mean.
Our Joshua and dear Savior,
Who wore our Rags of Sin,
And we his Robes of Righteousness,
So brought unto the King.
And now the filthy Garment's gone,
And changed with Raiment new,
The long and spotless Robe of Christ:
Now what can Satan do?
Thou art our great Zerubbabel,
A spiritual Temple makes;
The Temple of the living God
In Men, Christ undertakes,
To build, tho greatly opposed
By Mountain Enemies:
He that laid the Foundation-stone,
The Top-stone he will raise;
And finish Grace where it is begun,
In spite of all our Foes:
That you may all ever ascribe
To him, Grace, Glory, Praise.
Our Sampson art, who slew by Death,
More than when living was:
The strangest way of conquering,
Is dying on a Cross.
Who took from Satan's Kingdom great,
The Gates thereof away;
And led Captivity captive,
In his triumphing Day.
Our spotless Lamb, both God and Man,
Was foreordain'd to die,
To take off Sin, and Death's great Sting,
Bring Immortality.
The slain and living Goat thou art:
As slain, the Mercy-seat
Is still with Blood besprinkled;
As living do entreat,
And interceed continually:
This is the Incense sweet,
That like a Cloud in sweet Perfume,
Is round the Mercy-seat.
The Goat on which our Sins are laid,
Iniquities confess,
And carried out of Memory,
Lost in the Wilderness:
And far removed, as East from West,
Drowned in his bloody Sea;
Behind his Back they all are cast,
And blots them out most free.
He is the great Melchisedeck,
Without Beginning, End;
As Man no Sire, no Mother as God,
The Type he did transcend.
A King of Peace, and Priest most high,
Who offered once for all;
Not for his own, but others Sins,
Himself, not Beasts did fall.
The Peoples Covenant thou art,
In Substance, Person, Name;
And hence art called Immanuel,
Two Natures, Person one.
The Substance of the Covenant
Of Grace, it is in short;
Thy God I am, thou shall be mine,
And we will never part.
Now God and Man together dwell
In Christ, for evermore:
This is the great Foundation of
Man's Happiness in store.
That tho by Sin Man's separate
From God, the chiefest Good,
Yet now in Christ united are,
Man shall live still with God.
And if the Union cannot cease,
Called Hypostatical;
No more can that 'tween God and his,
Because it is Eternal.
Tho God and all our Adam lost,
Yet Christ has it regained:
And now the Saints have God in all,
The want of which them pained.
But Unbelievers have not God,
In what they do enjoy;
Since Sin did break the golden Link,
All things do them annoy.
But those are Christ's, all things are theirs,
And work still for their Good;
But the Profane, what e're they have,
It Is separate from God;
From God in way of Covenant,
So that all these may say,
Riches and Honor I have much,
But God in all leaves me.
And when Man lost a sight of God,
A Vision beautiful;
He by his Blood has it regained,
When all things else did fail.
CHAP. XXIV.
The ARGUMENT.
The undefiled Virgins of the Lamb, beg her Beloved to make haste over those
Mountains of Bether and Separation, and put an end to the Winter Storms, and
hasten the break of the Eternal Summer and Day of Glory, where back-part Sights
and Lattice-Looks will be turned into the Beatifical Vision, and all the Saints
shall have their white Robes, Palms in their Hands, and Crowns on their Heads,
and sit with Christ upon his Throne, to judge Men and Devils; then they shall
behold the Glorious Deity shining through the Blessed Glass of the Humane
Nature. The Virgins conclude with an Exhortation to the Noble Host of Martyrs,
the Glorious Apostles and Prophets, Elders, Seraphims, Cherubims, and every
Creature in Heaven and Earth, to cast their Crowns before the Lamb.

WHAT back-part Views, and Lattice Lights,
To those beyond the Grave;
There Is Banquets sweet, here is none such
For any Saint to have.
Lord, make no stay, come look'd-for Day;
What ails the Morning-Light?
All Shadows flee away, be gone,
And Day of Glory break.
Lord, Bether Mount, remove it quite,
And leap over them all;
No longer Separation make
Between thee and my Soul.
O be thou like the Roe and Heart,
With winged speed make haste;
Come over those separating Hills,
And take us to thy Rest.
The Winter Blasts are almost gone,
Farewell the Rain and Flood:
We cry aloud, come fetch us home,
Why have thy Chariots stood?
Come, Lord, with thy sweet Jubilee,
Hark how the Creatures groan
With Saints, for full Redemption;
Hear how they make their moan.
Come, blessed Lord, do thou create
New Heavens, and new Earth:
A sinless Kingdom we long for,
Which gives true Joy and Mirth.
With speed make haste, Vengeance to show,
For thy blessed Temple's sake:
All Antichrists both East and West
Do thou make desolate.
And then the chief rejected Stone,
Tho little, it will grow
Into a Mount, and fill the Seat
Of Monarchs here below. Mr. Raseson.

That Stone which from the Mountain was
Cut out, without a Hand,
Into a Mountain, let it grow,
And all the World command.
A burdensome Foundation-stone,
In Zion there shall lie:
All that do spurn against that Stone,
Shall by it fall and die.
Then all Christ's marked Ones, they shall
With him ascend the Throne;
Then all the World to him will bow,
When he shall reign alone.
Lord Jesus haste unto thy Throne,
We no more Captives be;
And fly upon the Wings of Love,
For thee we long to see.
This blessed Day no Night will have,
The Moon will be a Sun;
A sevenfold Light the Sun will be:
O were this Day begun.
Come haste that blessed break of Light,
Let Shadows flee away;
When Ordinances all shall cease,
Come on Eternal Day.
Then through a Glass shall look no more,
Unless the Glass Divine;
We shall through humane Nature see,
The blessed Godhead shine.
The Glass of Ordinances cease,
Now look through them no more,
Nor Creatures Word or Promises,
When we see God most pure:
Then we shall in each Bosom's rest,
As in a Bed Divine;
And fullness of pure Joy shall have,
When God does on us shine.
Now Righteous Ones they entrance have,
Into this Palace Royal,
There where no Curse shall ever be,
Or any time of Trial.
That City of Jerusalem,
In Vision John did see,
Descending out of Heaven above,
With glorious Majesty.
This City which does entertain
The People of the Lord;
It is set forth by Metaphors,
So is not understood.
The Walls of Stone most precious are,
And the Foundation too;
Twelve thousand Furlongs is the Breadth,
The Length and Height also.
Twelve Gates, twelve Angels at the Gates,
That keep both Watch and Ward:
No evil thing can enter there,
Tho they stand all abroad.
And on those Gates the Names are writ,
Of the twelve blessed Tribes
Of the Children of Israel,
In whom the Truth abides.
And twelve Foundations has the Wall
Of this most Royal City;
In which Foundation there is writ
Their Names, the Lamb did pity.
The twelve Apostles of the Lamb
Were written fair thereon;
There is no City like to this,
Free, Holy, without Sin.
Pure Jasper was the Wall built of,
The City of pure Gold:
Gold is the Streets of this rich Place,
Its Worth cannot be told.
Twelve glorious Pearls the Gates thereof,
One Pearl every Gate;
And the Foundation richly decked
With precious Stones of State.
And from this City glorious Streams
Of living Water comes,
Out of the Throne of God the Lamb,
Are most refreshing Streams.
And in the middle of the Street,
And either side the River,
Twelve sorts of Fruits the Tree of Life
Did bear, to heal us ever.
And here the Throne of God shall be,
Also the Lamb's high Throne;
And there his Servants shall be free,
To serve the Holy One:
And they shall see his blessed Face,
And bear his glorious Name;
Which on their Foreheads shall have place,
His Image to proclaim.
And then and there shall be no Night,
For God the Lord most High,
Will be their Temple, and their Light,
To all Eternity. Mr. Barton.

Now blessed Jesus his will lead,
To living Water-Springs,
Where Tears shall all be washed away,
A City full of Kings.
Law-Righteousness could not procure
Such Thrones and Kingdoms great,
Such Palms and Robes as Saints shall have
When they in Heaven meet.
Strike up you blessed Spirits in Bliss,
Your Songs most lofty high;
You separated Souls in Bliss
Praise him, as well you may. Mr. Reeves.

Unto the Lamb, whose Seat is set
In midst of the great Throne;
He there was seen who had been slain;
By Saints and Angels known.
'Twas thou wast slain, and have redeemed
All Nations by thy Blood;
Therefore worthy to open the Book,
The Mysteries of God.
The Book seen in Jehovah's Hand,
Written without, within,
Which do contain God's Counsels great
Unto the final End.
O holy Jesus, blessed Lamb,
John's Sorrows did prevent.
Thou David's Root, and Judah's Lion,
Wast fit to open the Book.
A Person very fit to Rule
Both this World, and the Church:
Therefore all Power is given him,
Because there is none such.
Let Us praise this King for ever-more,
With Angels, Elders, Beasts;
Church-Militant, and Triumphant,
Adore the Lord of Hosts.
Ye noble Host of Martyrs all,
The glorious Prophets too;
Angels, Apostles, Archangels,
Praise him the Lord most true.
Who can declare the sweet Jub'lee
In Heaven solemnized,
By Seraphims, and Cherubims,
And Principalities?
Powers and all, Dominions too,
To him do cast their Crowns;
Then thousand times ten thousand Tens
In holy Thanks abound,
Crying, O holy, holy Lord,
The Lamb in glorious State.
O Holy Ghost, Holy and True,
Who did the Creatures make,
Redeemed Men, for ever sing
Of Surety-Righteousness;
They Will have it there for ever-more,
In everlasting Bliss.
Come let us join the Creatures all,
In Heaven, Earth, and Sea;
All Creatures with loud Voices cry,
Worthy, O Lamb, worthy.
All Wisdom, Riches, to receive
Strength, Blessing, Glory too,
From all in Heaven, in Earth and Sea,
Is thine Eternal due.
