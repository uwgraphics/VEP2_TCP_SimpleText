CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, being necessitated, for the just Defense and
Vindication of His own and Subjects Rights, to Declare War against the States
of the United Provinces; And having His Forces now in readiness upon a present
Expedition, Has Resolved and does hereby Command a General and Public Fast to
be kept throughout His whole Kingdom: That so both Prince and People may send
up there Prayers and Supplications to Almighty God, for imploring His Blessing
on His Majesty's Naval Forces: And for the more decent and Uniform performance
thereof, His Majesty does hereby Publish and Declare to all His loving
Subjects, and does straightly Charge and Command that Wednesday next being the
27th day of this instant March, This Fast be Religiously and Solemnly kept and
observed, within the Cities of London and Westminster and the Borough of
Southwark and other Places adjacent within the Bills of Mortality: And that
upon Wednesday the 17th of April next, the like Fast be kept and duly observed
through the rest of this whole Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town
of Berwick upon Tweed.

And for the more orderly Solemnizing thereof, His Majesty has directed that
the Form of Prayers Composed and Published in the late War, upon the like
occasion, be used in all Churches and Chapels, and has given Charge to the
Bishops for the dispersing thereof through their several Diocesses in the whole
Kingdom.

And His Majesty does expressly Charge and Command, that the said Fasting and
Prayers be Soberly, Reverently, and Decently Performed by all His Loving
Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon pain of such
Punishments as His Majesty can justly inflict upon all such, as Contemn or
Neglect so Religious a Work.

Given at the Court at Whitehall this 22d day of March 1671/2 In the 24th year
of His Majesty's Reign.
