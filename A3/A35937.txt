A SALUTATION OF LOVE TO THE SEED of GOD Every where.
DEar Friends, You who are born of the Incorruptible Word of Life, and have
been quickened by the Immortal Power of Christ, and received Gifts to Serve
him, and one another, and all the Creation of God: All keep low in the pure
Fear of the Lord, waiting to feel the Motion of his Divine Spirit, to guide you
in your several Gifts and Services, that thereby as living Members of the
Complete Body, you may be all preserved in your places, where the Body will
Edify it self in Love, and all will be Comforted in the Lord Jesus Christ your
Heavenly Head, and dwell under his Peaceable Government, where his pure Love
and Life will abound amongst you, and in it your Hearts will be kept open to
God, and one to another; and in his Divine Light you will all come to see your
services and places in the Churches of Christ, and every one will be concerned
to keep in the Heavenly Discipline and Order of the Gospel, to keep their*
Ranks in Righteousness where his holy Banner of Love will be over you, and it
will be your Delight to keep under it, where the Rays of his Glory has many
times Covered you, and you have seen his Beauty, and have often been Ravished
there with, and prevailed upon thereby to serve the Lord and one another; that
nothing has been too near and dear to part with, to answer his pure
Requirings; because of the sweet Recompense of Reward, you have received from
his Bountiful Hand, and the Glory that has been set before you, which has
wrought a willingness in you to take up the Cross, and despise the Shame;
following your blessed Lord and Heavenly Example, through the many
Tribulations, and have washed your Garments in the Blood of the Lamb, that they
have been made white and clean. I say unto you all, Keep Low and Humble in the
pure Fear, with your Eyes single to the Honor of the Giver, where you will
feel his Power with you, and to assist you every Day in your Services; and then
the Life will Speak through you, and here you will be Instrumental in the
Lord's Hand for the Building up one another in the most holy Faith, which
works in the Heart by Love, where the Unity of the Spirit will be kept, and
the Bond of Peace will be Witnessed, which will keep you all near the Lord, and
near one another, where all will be tender of Gods Glory, and tender one over
another, Traveling and Breathing to the Lord one for another's Growth and
Preservation in your Several Gifts and Services, that as fixed Stars in the
Firmament of Gods Power, you may be all showing forth the Power of him which
makes the Stars to differ as pleases him, and gives Light unto them, some
more and some less, Yet all show forth his great Power and Divine Wisdom: As
they keep their places, and are Governed by his Heavenly Power, and kept by him
from the reach of the Dragons Tail, which draws down all to the Earth, whose
care is not to keep to the Power of the Immortal Word by which they have been
Quickened and Divinely opened, and have had Gifts given unto them: Those that
do not keep low in the pure Fear and Humility, and are thereby kept tender of
Gods Glory, and also tender over the Blessed Unity of the Church of Christ;
those the Dragon has prevailed and will prevail over, and draw down to the
Earth again, and their Habitation will be there where the Woe will be their
Portion: Therefore let all be careful and keep upon their Watch, that they may
see the many Snares of the Old Crooked Serpent, and escape them, by keeping to
the Power of Christ, which will keep all Humble and Low, in the true dread
before the Lord; whatever their Gifts or Services be, let none look at the
Gift more then the Giver: But let all be careful to Honor the Giver in their
Gift, so will the Lord take Delight in you, and make you worthy of double
Honor, as he has done many Worthies whom he has upheld Faithful unto him in
their Gifts, discharging their duty to him and to the whole Creation, whose
Memory lives, and shall live for ever; for their names are written in Heaven,
and is very sweet and pleasant to all who are kept Faithful to the Lord, and
who are Engaged in the same warfare they were concerned in: For Dear Friends,
Great is the Lords Work which he has begun, and he will carry it on by his own
Arm of Power, which is Manifested to many, and those that he makes use of, must
be subject to his Meek Lowly Spirit, and wait to be thus guided by it, in all
their Services, where self is had in no reputation; but that is daily denied in
all its appearances whatsoever, and had great need to be Careful to watch in
the Light, that none be betrayed from the Simplicity of the Gospel, and so be
puffed up above the pure Fear of God, and let up a wrong Mind, to look out at
their Gifts, or Seize, or Services they have passed through, and thereby
beget a slight esteem of their fellow Servants, and to set up themselves, and
not to have a true regard to the Honor of God, nor the Peace and Prosperity of
his Church and People: Where such a Mind is given way to, it hurts the
Particular, and brings Trouble and Exercise on the General. But Oh my Friends,
God has Called you to Peace, and to Walk together in his Peaceable Spirit, in
which ye have all Life, and Peace, and Salvation, by which ye are Supported and
born up in your several Services, and all show forth the great Power of him
that has called you to serve him and one another. And in all your Men's and
Women's Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, let a Care be upon all, that this
Peaceable Spirit be kept in, and your Spirits be kept in Subjection under it;
so will you be all kept in the Love which Edifies and Builds up in the holy
Faith, and settles and confirms in that holy Gospel Discipline, the Lord has
brought you into, in which he has owned you, and stood by you, through many
Exercises, and will never leave you, nor forsake you; except you forsake him,
and trust in your own Strength. My Soul is under a deep Travail that you may be
kept, by his great Power, faithful unto him, and in sweet Fellowship one with
another, where your Joy may be full in the Lord, and his Communion pleasant in
his holy Covenant of Light, in which my Soul Dearly Salutes you all, and
Remains your Friend and Brother.
