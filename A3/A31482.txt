OXFORD, Printed by LEON LICHFIELD, Anno Dom. 1641.

The causes of the continuance of these Contentions concerning
Church Government.
COntention arises, either through error in men's judgments, or else disorder
in their affections.

When contention does grow by error in judgment;

The Moscovian Emperor, being weary of the infinite strifes and contentions
amongst Preachers, and by their occasion amongst others, forbad preaching
utterly throughout all his Dominions; and in stead there of commanded certain
Sermons of the Greek and Latin Fathers to be translated, and them to be read
in public assemblies, without adding a word of their own thereunto upon
pain of death. He thought by this politic devise to bring them to agreement
or at least to cover their disagreement. But so bad a policy was on fit salve
for so great a soar.

We may think perhaps, that punishment would have been more effectual to that
purpose. For neither did Solomon speak without book in saying, that when folly,
Prove. 22.15.
is bound up in the heart of a child, the rod of correction must drive it out;
and experience does show, that when error has once disquieted the minds of
men and made them restless, if they do not fear they will terrify. Neither
has it repented the Church at any time to have used the rod in moderate
severity for the speedier reclaiming of men from error, and the reuniting such
as by schism have sundred themselves. But we find by trial, that as being
taught and not terrified, they shut their ears against the word of truth and
sooth themselves in that wherewith custom or sinister persuasion has inured
them: so contrariwise, if they be terrifyed and not taught, their punishment
does not commonly work their amendment.

As Moses therefore, so likewise Aaron; as Zerubabel, so Iehoshua; as the
Prince which has labored by the Scepter of righteousness and sword of
justice to end strife, so the Prophets which with the book and doctrine of
salvation have soundly and wisely endeavored to instruct the ignorant in those
litigious points wherewith the Church is now troubled: whether by preaching, as
Apolloes among the Jews; or by disputing, as Paul at Athens; or by writing, as
the learned in their several times and ages heretofore; or by conferring in
Synods and Counsels, as Peter, James, and others at Jerusalem, or by any the
like allowable and laudable means; 2. Cor. 8.18.
their praise is worthily in the Gospel, and their portion in that promise
which God has made by his Prophets, Dan. 12.3.
They that turn many unto righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever
and ever. I say, whosoever have soundly and wisely endeavored by those means
to reclaim the ignorant from their error, and to make peace.

Want of sound proceeding in Church controversies has made many more stiff in
error now then before.

Want of wise and discreet dealing, has much hindered the peace of the Church.
It may be thought, and is, that Arius had never raised those tempestuous
storms which we read he did; if Alexander, the first that withstood the
Arrians heresy, had born himself with greater moderation, and been less eager
in so good a cause. Sulpitius Severus does note as much in the dealings of
Idacius against the favorers of Priscillian, when that heresy was but green
and new sprung up. For by overmuch vehemence against Iactantius and his mates,
a spark was made a flame: insomuch that thereby the seditious waxed rather
more fierce then less troublesome. In matters of so great moment, whereupon
the peace or disturbance of the Church is known to depend, if there were in us
that reverend care which should be; it is not possible we should either speak
at any time without fear, or ever write but with a trembling hand. Do they
consider whereabout they go, or what it is they have in hand; who taking upon
them the causes of God, deal only or chiefly against the persons of men?

We cannot altogether excuse our selves in this respect, whose home
controversies and debates at this day, although I trust they be as the strife
of Paul with Barnabas and not with Elymas; yet because there is a truth, which
on the one side being unknown has caused contention, I do wish it had pleased
Almighty God, that in sifting it out, those offenses had not grown, which I had
rather bewail with secret tears then public speech.

Nevertheless as some sort of people is reported to have bred a detestation of
drunkenness in their children by presenting the deformity thereof in servants:
so it may come to pass (I wish it might) that we beholding more foul
deformity in the face and countenance of a common adversary, shall be induced
to correct some smaller blemishes in our own. Ye are not ignorant of the
Demands, Motives, Censures, Apologies, Defenses, and other writings which our
great enemies have published under color of seeking peace; promising to bring
nothing but reason and evident remonstrance of truth. But who sees not how
full gorged they are with virulent, slanderous and immodest speeches, tending
much to the disgrace, to the disproofe nothing of that cause which they
endeavor to overthrow? Job. 13.7.
Will you speak wickedly for Gods defense? says Job. Will you dipp your
tongues in gall and your pens in blood, when ye write and speak in his
cause? Is the truth confirmed, are men convicted of their error when they are
upbrayded with the miseries of their condition and estate? When their
understanding, wit and knowledge is depressed? When suspicions and rumors,
without respect how true or how false, are objected to diminish their credit
and estimation in the world? Is it likely that Invectives, Epigrammes,
Dialogues, Epistles, Libells, laden with contumelies and criminations, should
be the means to procure peace? Surely they which do take this course, Rom
3.17.
the way of peace they have not known. If they did but once enter into a
stayed consideration with themselves what they do; no doubt they would give
over and resolve with Job. Behold I am vile, what shall I answer? Job. 40.4, 5.
I will lay my hand upon my mouth. If I have spoken once amiss, I will speak
no more; or if twice, I will proceed no further.

But how sober and how sound soever our proceedings be in these causes;
Jerusalem; and your prayer shall cause the hills to bring forth peace: Psalm.
72.3, 6.
peace shall distill and come down like the rain upon the mowen grass, and
as the showers that water the earth. We have used all other means, and behold
we are frustrate, we have labored in vain. In disputations; whether it be
because men are ashamed to acknowledge their errors before many witnesses, or
because extemporality does exclude mature and ripe advise without which the
truth cannot soundly and thoroughly be demonstrated, or because the fervor of
contention does so disturb men's understanding, that they cannot sincerely and
effectually judge: in Books and Sermons; whether it be because we do speak and
write with too little advise, or because you do hear and read with too much
prejudice: in all humane means which have hitherto been used to procure peace;
whether it be because our dealings have been too feeble, or the minds of men
with whom we have dealt too too implacable, or whatsoever the cause or causes
have been: for as much as we see that as yet we fail in our desires, yea the
ways which we take to be most likely to make peace, do but move strife; O
that we would now hold our tongues, leave contending with men, and have our
talk and treaty of peace with God. We have spoken and written enough of peace:
Psalm. 122.6.
there is no way left but this one; Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.

THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT: And first, under MOSES.
THE Commonwealth of ISRAEL was considered, either as Personal, containing
all the whole people, not a man left: or Representative; in the Estate, Tribes,
Cities; whose daughters the Towns adjacent are called.
I. The Estate had ever one Governor, 1. Moses. 2. Joshua. 3. Judges. 4. Kings.
5. Tirshathaes, [or, Vice-royes, Ezra. 2.63.] with whom were joined the LXX.
Elders.
II. The Tribes had every one their Prince, (...) Phylarcha. (Number. 2.) with
whom were joined the chief of the families, (...) Patriarchae. (Number. 1.4.)
III. The Cities had each likewise their Ruler. (Iud. 9.30. 1. King. 22.26. 2.
King. 23.8.) with whom were joined the Elders or Ancients. (Ruth. 4.2. Ezr.
10.14.) These last, not before they came into Canaan, [and were settled in their
Cities.] It appears, that Moses sometime consulted only with (...) (the heads
of the Tribes;) and then one Trumpet only sounded: (Number. 10.4.) in some other
causes with the (...) (the Congregation;) and then both Trumpets called. (Number.
10.3.) The highest BENCH or Judgment, for causes of greatest difficulty, was
that of the LXX. who at the first, were the Fathers of each family that came
down to Egypt. (Genesis 46.) which number did after that remain; (Exodus 24.1, 9.)
and was at last by God himself so appointed. (Number. 11.16.) See 2. Chron. 19.8.
The inferior BENCHES, for matters of less importance, were erected by
Iethroes advice of Rulers of Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties, Tithings
Exodus 18.21, 26.and after established by Gods approbation. (Deuteronomy. 16.18.)


In every City (as Antiquit. l. 4. c. 8.
Josephus says) were seven Judges; and for each Judge, two Levites: which made
together the Bench of each City.

The form of the Ecclesiastical government under MOSES.
THe Priesthood was settled in the Tribe of Levi by God.

Levi had three sons: Cohath, Gershon, and Merari.

Of these, the line of Cohath was preferred before the rest.

From him descended four Families: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Vzziel.

Of these the stock of Amram was made chief.

He had two sons: Aaron and Moses.

Aaron was by God appointed High Priest.

So that there came to be four distinctions of Levitst 1. Aaron, as chief. 2.
Cohath. 3. Gershon. 4. Merari.


The Commonwealth of Israel was at the beginning in the desert a Camp. In the
midst whereof the Arc and Tabernacle were pitched: and according to the four
Coasts whereof, they guartered themselves; on every side three Tribes.

On the East side: Judah. Issachar. Zabulon. Number. 2. v. 3. On the South side:
Reuben. Simeon. Gad. Number. 2. v. 10. On the West side: Ephraim. Manasses.
Benjamin. Number. 2. v. 18. On the North side: Dan. Aser. Napthali. Number. 2. v. 25.
These four Quarters were committed to those four Divisions of Levits: The
East quarter, to Aaron, and his family. Number. 3. verse. 38. The South quarter, to
The Cohathites. Number. 3. verse. 29. The West quarter, to The Gershonits. Number. 3.
verse. 23. The North quarter, to The Merarits. Number. 3. verse. 35.


Who lodged among them, and took charge of them, as of their several Wards.

But there was not a parity in these four: for 1. Aarons family, which bare
the Ark it self, was chief. 2. Cohaths, which bare the Tabernacle and
vessels, next. 3. Gershons, which bare the veil and hangings of the Court,
third. 4. Meraries, which bare the Pillars and Posts, last.


Neither were all the Levits of each of these several houses equal; but God
ordained a superiority among them: Over the Priests, Eleazar. Number. 3. v.
30.24.35. Over the Cohathits, Elizaphan. Number. 3. v. 30.24.35. Over the
Gershenits, Eliasaph. Number. 3. v. 30.24.35. Over the Merarits, Zuriel. Number. 3.
v. 30.24.35.


Whom he terms Nesiim, that is, Prelates or Superiors.

No more did he permit these four to be equals among themselves: but appointed
Ithamar (Exodus 38.21.) to command over Eliasaph, with his Gershonits. (Number.
4.28.) Zuriel, with his Merarits. (Number. 4.33.)
Eleazar (Number. 4.16.) to have jurisdictio over His own Family. Elizaphan, with
his Cohathites.



Yea he makes not Eleazar and Ithamar to be absolute equals: but gives
Eleazar preeminence over Ithamar; and therefore terms him Nasi Nesiim,
Princeps Principum or Praelatus Praelatorum. (Number. 3.32.)

And all these under Aaron the High Priest.

So that, 1. Aaron was the High Priest. 2. Under him Eleazar: who, as he had
his peculiar charge to look unto, so was he generally to rule both Ithamars
jurisdiction and his own. 3. Under him Ithamar, over two families. 4. Under
him the three Prelates. 5. Under each of them, their several chief Fathers
((...)as they are termed Exodus 6.25.) under Elizaphan four, under Eliasaph
two, under Zuriel two. ( Number. 3.18, etc.) 6. Under these, the several persons
of their kindreds.


This is here worth the noting, that albeit it be granted that Aaron was the
type of Christ, and so we forbear to take any argument from him: yet Eleazar
(who was no type, nor ever so deemed by any writer) will serve sufficiently to
show such superiority as is pleaded for; that is, a personal jurisdiction in
one man restant over the heads or rulers of diverse charges.

The form of government under JOSHUA.
THe Commonwealth being changed from the ambulatory form into a settled estate
in the Cities of Canaan: as before, the Levits were divided according to the
several Quarters of the Camp; so now were they sorted into the several
territories of the Tribes. So God commanded; Number. 35.2, 8.

The lot fell so, that the four partitions of the XII. Tribes were not the
same, as when they camped before together; but after another sort. For the
Tribes of 1. Judah, Simeon and Benjamin made the first Quarter. 2. Ephraim, Dan,
and half of Manasses the second. 3. Issachar, Asher, Napthali, and the other
half of Manasses the third. 4. Zebulun, Reuben, and Gad the fourth.


Now in these four; 1. The charge or oversight of the first was committed to
Aaron and his family: and they had therein assigned to them XIII. Cities. in
Judah and Simeon, IX. and in Benjamin, IV. ( Ios. 21.9, 10, etc.) 2. Of the
second, the care was committed to the family of the Cohathits: and they had
assigned to them X. Cities. in Ephraim, IV. in Dan, IV. and in the half of
Manasses, II. (Ios. 21.20.) 3. The third was committed to the family of
Gershon: and they had therein assigned to them XIII. Cities. in Issachar, IV.
in Asher, IV. in Naphtali, III. in the other half of Manasses, II. (Ios.
21.27.) 4. The oversight of the fourth partition was committed to the Merarits:
and they had therein assigned to them XII. Cities. in Zebulun, IV. in Reuben,
IV. in Gad, IV. (Ios. 21.34.)


These were in all, XLVIII. Cities: whereof the chief (as may appear) were
Cities set on Hills; and all so situate, in such proportion and distance, as
that they most equally parted their Tribe among them, to perform unto them
their duties of attendance and instruction.

Further, there were in Ioshuahs time added, by the decree of the Princes, the
Nethinims of the people of Gibeon; for the lowest ministeries, and for the
service of the Levits. (Ios. 9.27.)

So that now the order was thus: 1. Eleazar. 2. Phineas. 3. Abisua. 4. The
three Nesiims. 5. The Raze Aboth, [or, Heads of the Families.] 6. The Levits.
7. The Nethinims.


If this power and superiority was necessary, when all the People and Priests
were within one Trench, even within the view of Aarons eye: much more in
Canaan, when they were scattered abroad in diverse Cities far distant, was the
retaining of it more then necessary.

The form of Government under DAVID.
ALbeit in Saul's government small regard was had to the Church: yet David found
at his coming a superiority amongst them.

For besides the Priests, he found six Princes or Rulers over six families of
the Levits. (1. Chron. 15.5, 6, etc.)

Vriel over Cohath. Asajah over Merari. Joel over Gershon. Shemajah over
Elizaphan. Eliel over Hebron. Amminadab over Vzziel.
Likewise between the two Priests an inequality: one Abiathar, attending the
Ark at Jerusalem, the higher function; the other, Zadok, the Tabernacle at
Gibeon. (2. Sam. 20.25. 1. Chron. 16.37, 39.)

But after the Ark was brought back; he set a most exquisite order among the
Levits: and that by Samuels direction; 1. Chron. 9.22. So that he is there
reckoned as a new Founder.

Of them he made six orders: 1. Chron. 23.

1. Priests, (...) 24000. verse. 4. 2. Ministers of Priests 24000. verse. 4. 3.
Judges, (...) 6000. verse. 4. 4. Officers, (...) 6000. verse. 4. 5. Singers,
(...) 4000. verse. 5. 6. Porters, (...) 4000. verse. 5.
I. Of Priests, Zadok was the chief of the family of Eleazar; and Ahimelech
the second, of the family of Ithamar. (1. Chron. 24.3.)

Under these were XXIIII. other Courses. Of the posterity of Eleazar, XVI. 1.
Chr. 24.4. Of the posterity of Ithamar, VIII. 1. Chr. 24.4. Which XXIIII. are
called (in the 5. verse) Rulers of the Sanctuary and Rulers of the House of
God: and to whom the learned Interpreters think the XXIIII. Elders, Apocal.
4.4. have relation.
II. Of Levits that ministered to the Priests in their function, likewise
XXIIII. Courses; out of the IX.
VIII. families, the Heads of whom are set down in 1. Chron. 23.6. and 24.20.

Over all which, Jehdeiah was chief.

III. Of Judges, that sat for causes as well of God as the King, there were
appointed: 1. On this side Jordan, upwards toward the River; Ashhabiah the
Hebronite. (1. Chr. 26.30.) 2. On this side Jordan, downwards toward the Sea;
Chenaniah the Isharite. (1. Chr. 26.29.) 3. Beyond Jordan, over the two Tribes
and the half; Ierijah the chief of the Hebronites. (1. Chron. 26.31.)


IIII. Of Officers. Scribes. Shemaiah. (1. Chron. 24.6.) Scribes. Seraiah. (2.
Sam. 8.17.) Scribes. Shevah. (2. Sam. 20.25.) Scribes of the Levits. (1. Chron.
24.6.) Scribes of the Temple. (2. King. 22.3. Ier. 36.10) Scribes of the
People. (Mat. 2.4.) Scribes of the King. (2. King. 12.10.)


V. Of the Singers likewise he set XXIV courses: over which he placed three
chief, out of the three families. (1. Chron. 15.17. and 25.2, 3, 4.)

Out of Cohath; Heman Samuels nephew. (1. Chr. 6.33) Out of Gershon; Asaph. (1.
Chron. 6.39.) Out of Merari; Ethan or Ieduthun. 1. Chron. 6.44.
Of these, Heman was the Chief. (1. Chapter 25.5)

Under these were diverse others. (1. Chr. 15.18.

VI. Of Porters, who were divided into the Keepers of the watch of the Temple:
(Mat. 27.65. Psalm. 134.1.) who were placed on each quarter of the Tabernacle.
(1. Chr. 26.13, 14, etc.) On the East side VI. over whom was Shelemiah. South
IIII. (for the Tabernaele II. and II. for Asuppim) over who^ was Obed. West
IIII. over whom was Hosa. North IIII. over whom was Zechariah.
Over all these it seems Benajah, the son of Iehoiada the Priest, was the
chief. (1. Chron, 27.5.) Treasurers: for the Revenues of the house of God (1.
Chapter 26.20.) for Cohath; Shebuel of Moses offspring. Gershon; Iehiel. Merare;
Ahiah.
Things dedicated by vow; Shelomith. 1. Chron. 26.26.
Over all the Porters was Chenaniah. (1. Chr. 26.29. and 15.22, 27.)


It is to be remembered that, beside Zadok the High Priest and Ahimelech (the
second) we find mention of Hashabiah the son of Kemuel chief of the whole
Tribe of Levi. (1. Chron. 27.17.) So that there was One over the Ark; Zadok.
The second over the Tabernacle; Ahimelech. The third over the Tribe; Hashabiah.


As over the Levits Ministers; Iehdeiah. Judges; Chasabiah. Officers; Shemaiah.
Singers; Heman. Porters; Chenaniah, or Benaiah.


Agreeable to this form we read that under Josias there were three: that is,
Hilkiah, Zachariah, and Iehiel: (2. Chron. 35.8.) and that the Levits had six
over them. (2. Chron. 35.9.)

Again under Zedekiah; that there were carried into Captivity Seraiah. [the
chief Priest] and Zephaniah [the second Priest.] 2. King. 25.18.

Likewise under Ezekiah, at the provision for the Levits portions, there were
ten of the Levits; over whom was Cononiah and Shimei: and so Kore over the
voluntary offerings; and six Levits under him. (2. Chron. 31.12, 13. etc.)

The form of government under NEHEMIAH.
OF whom and Esdras it is recorded, that they did all according to Moses
institution. (Ezr. 6.18. Nehem. 10.34, 36.)

There was then Eliashib. Nehem. 3.1. Seraiah. 11.11. Zabdiel. 11.14.


The Courses were then but XXII. (Neh. 12.12.)

There was then Vzzi. (Neh. 11.22.) Iezrahiah. (Neh. 12.42.) Shallum. (1.
Chron. 9.17.)


Under Zabdiel, at his hand Adaiah. Nehem. 11. ver. 12, 13. Amasai. Nehem. 11.
ver. 12, 13.


Under Vzzi Shemaiah. Neh. 11.15, 16. Shabbethai. Heh. 11.15, 16. Iozabad. Neh.
11.15, 16.


Under Iezrahiah Mattaniah. Neh. 11.17. Bakbukiah. Neh. 11.17. Abda. Neh. 11.17.


Under Shallum Akkub. 1. Chron. 9.17. Talmon. Nehem. 11.19.


So that there was 1. The High Priest. 2. The second and third, Overseers of
the Priests. 3. The Princes of the Priests. 4. The Priests. 5. The Overseer of
the Levits. 6. The Princes of the Levits. 7. The Levits. 8. The Heads of the
Nethinims. 9. The Nethinims: of the Gibeonits. Salomons servants.



[A brief Recapitulation of the degrees observed under the government of the
Old Testament: with an accommodation thereof unto the New.]
Out of these we gather this Form to have been.

I. Moses: [in whom was] the supreme jurisdiction, to visit Aaron. (Number. 3.10.)
II. Aaron: the High Priest. (Levit. 21.20. Number. 35.28. Nehem. 3.1.) Head. (2.
Chron. 19.11.) Prince of the house of God. (1. Chron. 9.11)
III. Eleazar: the second. (2. King. 25.18.) Prelate of Prelates. (Number. 3.22.)
Chief Overseer, or Bishop (Ier. 20.1.) At his hand, It hamar.
IV. Prince of the Tribe. (1. Chron. 27.17.) V. Elizaphan. Eliasaph. Zuriel.
Prelates. (Number. 3.24, etc.) Overseers or Bishops. (Neh. 11.14, 22.)
VI. [In] the XXIV. Courses set by David; The Princes of the Priests. (Ezr.
8.29.) of God. 1. Chr. 24.5. of the Sanctuary. 1. Chr. 24.5. Elders of the
Priests. (Ierem. 19.1. King. 19.1.) Heads of the Families. (...) (Nehem.
12.12.) Chief Priests. (Act. 19.14.)

VII. The Priests themselves: Whether at Jerusalem; or in the Country towns.
(2. Chron. 31.19.)
VIII. The Overseer of the Levits. (Nehem. 11.22.) IX. The Princes of the
Levits. (1. Chron. 15.5. 2. Chron. 35.9. Nehem. 12.22.) X. The Head of the
Levits Officers. The Scribe. The Singers. (1. Chro. 16.5. Neh. 12.42.) The
Porters. (1. Chron. 9.17. and 15.22.) The Treasurers. (1. Chron. 26.24, 2. Chr.
31.12.)
[XI. The Levits themselves.] XII. The Chief of the Nethinims. (Nehem. 11.21.)
XIII. The Nethinims: of the Gibeonits. (Ios. 9.21.) Salomons servants. (1.
King. 9.21. Nehem. 7.60.)

It is not only requisite that things be done, and that they be diligently done
(against sloth;) but that they be done continually, and constantly.

To this end it is, that God appoints Overseers: 1. To urge others, if they be
slack. (2. Chron. 24.5. and 34 13.) 2 To keep them in course, if they be well.
(2. Chr. 29.5. and 31.12. and 34.12.13.) 3. To punish, if any be defective.
(Ierem. 29.26.)


For which, A power of Commanding was in the High Priest. (1. Chron. 23.8, 18.
and 24.6. and 31.13.) A power Judicial, if they transgressed: (Deuteronomy: 17.9.
Zach: 3.7. Ezech: 44.24. Under pain of death. (Deuteronomy: 17.12.) Punishment in
Prison, and in the Stocks: (Ier: 29.26.) in the Gate of Benjamin. (Ier: 20.2.)
Officers to Cite and Arrest: (Ioh. 7.32. Act: 5.18.) This Corporal. To
suspend from the Function: (Ezr: 2.62.) To excommunicate. (Ezr: 10.8. Ioh.
9.22. and 12.) 42. and 16.2.) [This Spiritual.]



Why may not the like be, [for the government of the Church:]
There is alleged one only stop. That the High Priest was a figure of Christ:
who being now come in the flesh, the figure cease, and no argument thence to
be drawn.

[For Answer whereunto, we are to consider; that]

I. This is the Anabaptists only shift. That we are to have no Wars: for the
wars of the Jews were but figures of our spiritual Battle. No Magistrate:
for their Magistrates were but figures of our Ministers, Pastors, and Doctors.
and, all by Christ's coming abolished.

II. Christ, being as well King as Priest, was as well fore resembled by the
Kings then, as by the High Priest. So that if his coming take away the one
Type, it must also the other. If it be said, there was in the King somewhat
else beside the representation: the like is and may be truly said of the High
Priest. And that some such thing there was, it is plain by S. Paul, who
yielded his obedience to the High Priest; appearing before him, and
acknowledging him a Governor of the People (Act. 23.5.) and that, after the
Type was expired. Which had been merely unlawful; if there had not remained
in him somewhat besides the Figure.

III. There is no necessity we should press Aaron. For Eleazar being Princeps
Principum, that is, having a saperiour authority over the Superiors of the
Levits [in Aarons life time] was never by any [in this point] reputed a Type of
Christ. So that though Aaron be accounted such; yet Eleazar will serve our
purpose. As also, 2. Chron. 35.8. we read of three at once: one only of which
was the High Priest, and a Type of Christ; the rest were not. Let them answer
then to the other twain, who were Rulers or Chief over the House of God.

Why it may be.
I. Out of Dic Ecclesiae, [the New Reformers] tell us, we are to fetch our
pattern from the Jews: and therefore it seems they are of opinion, that one
form may serve both us and them.

II. Except there should be such a fashion of Government, consisting of
inequality: I see not in the New Testament, how any could perish in that
contradiction of Gore, which S. Jude affirms. For his plea was for equality;
and against the preferring of Aaron above the rest.

III. The Ancient Fathers seem to be of mind, that the same Form should serve
both.

So thinks S. Cyprian, l. 3. ep. 9. ad Rogatianum. So S. Hierom, ep. 85. ad
Evagrium. Traditiones Apostolicae sumptae sunt de Veteri Testamento. and ad
Nepotianum, de vita Clericorum. So St Leo. Ita veteris Testamenti sacramenta
distinxit; ut quaedam ex iis, sicut erant condita, Evangelicae eruditioni
profutura decerperet: ut quae dudum fuerant consuetudines Iudaicae, fierent
observantiae Christianae. So Rabanus, de Institutione Clericorum, l. 1. c. 6.
They ground this their opinion upon that they see,

1. That the Synagogue is called a Type or shadow, and the Church the very
image of the thing. (Heb. 10.1.)

2. That God himself says of the Christian Church under the Gentiles; that he
will take of the Gentiles, and make them Priests and Levits to himself. (Esai.
66.21.) there calling our Presbyters and Deacons by those Legal names.

3. That there is an agreement, in the Numbers: XII. Number. 1.16. and Luke 9.1.
LXX. Number. 11.16. and Luk: 10.1.
Names: Angel. Malach. 2.7. and Revel. 1.10.


And their often enterchange and indifferent using of Priest or Presbyter,
Levite or Deacon, shows they presumed a correspence and agreement between
them.

[Thus then]

Aaron [should be answerable unto] Christ. Eleazar [should be answerable unto]
Archbishop. Princes of Priests [should be answerable unto] Bishops. Priests
[should be answerable unto] Presbyters. Princes of Levits [should be answerable
unto] Archdeacons. Levits [should be answerable unto] Deacons. Nethinims
[should be answerable unto] Clerks and Sextons.
THE FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT in the New Testament: and first in the days of
our Savior CHRIST.
I. THe whole ministry of the New Testament was at the first invested in
Christ alone.

He is termed our Apostle. (Hebr. 3.1.) Prophet. (Deuteronomy. 18.15. Act. 3.22.)
Evangelist. (Esai. 41.27.) Bishop. (1. Pet. 2.25.) Doctor. (Mat. 23.10.)
Diaconus. (Romans 15.8.)


II. When the Harvest was great, ( Matthew. 9.38.) that his personal presence
could not attend all; he took unto him XII. Apostles: as the XII. Patriarchs,
or XII. Exodus 15.27. Number. 33.9.
Fountains (as S. Ierom) or the XII. Princes of the Tribes. ( Number. 1.)
Gathering his Disciples, ( Matthew. 10.1.) Choosing out of them ( Luke 6.13.)
Whom he would; ( Mark. 3.13.) Called them to him, ( Luke 6.13.) Made them, (
Mark. 3.13.) Named them Apostles. (Luke 6.13.)


These he began to send: ( Mark. 6.7.) Gave them in charge, ( Mat. 10.1. and
11.1.) To preach the Gospel. ( Luke 9.2.) To Heal. ( Matthew. 10.1. Luke 9.2.)
To cast out Devils. ( Matthew. 10.1.)
Gave them power, ( Mat. 10.1. Luke 9.2.) To take maintenance, ( Matthew. 10.10.)
To shake of the dust for a witness. ( Matthew. 10.14.)



So he sent them. ( Matthew. 10.5. Luke 9.1.) They went and preached. ( Luke
9.6.) They returned, and made relation what they had done. Mark. 6.30. taught.
Mark. 6.30.



III. After this, when the Harvest grew Iogreat as that the XII. sufficed not
all; ( Luke 10.1, 2.) he took unto him other LXX. (as the 70. Palme-trees,
Number. 33.9. the Fathers of Families, Genesis 46. the Elders. Number. 11)

These he Declared: ( Luke 10.1.) Sent by two and two into every City and
place, whither he himself would come. Ib. Gave them power, as to the Apost
les, to Take maintenance. ( Luke 10.7.) Shake off the dust. ( Luke 10.11.)
Heal the sick. Luke 10.9. Preach. Luke 10.9. Tread upon Serpents and
Scorpions, and over all the power of the Enemy. ( Luke 10.19)



These two Orders (as me thinks) S. Paul, Ephesians. 3.5. does comprehend under
the name of Apostles and Prophets; by the LXX. understanding Prophets: as
usually next to the Apostles he places Prophets ever. (1. Cor. 12.28. Ephesians.
4.11.)

None of the Fathers ever doubted, that these two were two several Orders or
Sorts: nor that the Apostles were superior to the LXX.

It appears also, that [the Apostles] had in them power to forbid to preach:
( Luke 9.49.) and that Matthias was exalted from the other Order to the
Apostleship.

This was then the Order, while Christ was upon the Earth.
I. Christ himself. II. The XII. (whose successors were Bishops.) III. The
LXX. (whose successors were Priests.) IV. The faithful people or Disciples:
of whom 500. and more are mentioned, in 1. Corinthians. 15.6. and CXX. in Act.
1.15.
[The form of go vernment, used in the time of the APOSTLES.]
Albeit Christ says, the people were as Sheep without a Shepherd: (Matthew.
9.38.) yet he terms his Apostles Harvest. men, not Shepherds. For while he
was in person on Earth; himself only was the Shepherd, and they but Arietes
gregis. But at his departure he makes them Shepherds: (John 21.15.) as they
likewise at theirs. (1. Pet. 5.2. Act. 20.28)

Of the APOSTLES themselves: and first, of their Name.
Shelicha, which is the Syrian name, was the title of certain Legates or
Commissioners sent from the High Priest, to visit the Jews and their
Synagogues which were dispersed in other Countries; with authority to redrese
things amiss.

(...), among the Greeks, were Officers of great credit: as by Herodotus and
Demosthenes appears.

Secondly, of their Form, what it is.
Not to have been with Christ all his time, ( Acts 1.21.) So were others more.
Not to be sent immediately of Christ. ( Gal. 1.1.) So were the LXX. ( Luke 10.)
Not to be limited to no one place. ( Matthew. 28.19.) So were others. ( Luke
24.33, 50.) And S. James went no whither. Not to be inspired of God; so that
they did not err. So were Mark and Luke. Not to plant Churches. So did Philip
the Evangelist. ( Act. 8. 5.) Not to work signs and miracles. So did Stephen
(Acts 6.8.) and Philip. (Acts 8.6.)
But over and above these, and with these, that eminent Authority or
Jurisdiction which they had over all; not only jointly together, but every one
by himself: I. Of imposing hands in Ordination. ( Acts 6.6.) Confirmation. (
Act 8.17, 18.)
II. Of Commanding. (the word of the Bench. Acts 4.18. and 5.28.) 1 Thessalonians.
4.11.2. These. 3.6, 12. Philem. 8. Coloss. 4.10. 1. Cor. 14.37. 2. Peter 3.2.
Titus 1.5.1. Cor. 7.6, 17. and 11.34. and 16.1. III. Of Countermanding. ( Luke
9.49. Acts 15.24. 1. Tim. 2.12.) IV. Of Censuring. (1. Cor. 4.21.2. Cor. 13.10.
Gal. 5.12. 1. Tim. 1.20. 1. Cor. 5.5, 11. 2 Thessalonians. 3.14. Matthew. 16.19. with
18.18. and John 20.23.)


In this power it is, that the Bishops. succeed the Apostles. Irenaelig;. lib.
3. tap. 3. Tertull. de Praelig;script. Cyprian. ad Florent. 3.9. Epiphan.
Haeres. 27. ( Romaefuerunt fuerunt primi Petrus and Paulus, Apostoli ijdem ac

Petro and Iacobo. Ambros: in 1. Corinthians: 11. (de Angelis:) and in Ephesians. 4.
(Apostolis Angeli sunt.)

OF DEACONS.
AT the beginning, the whole weight of the Churches affairs lay upon the
Apostles.

The distribution as well of the Sacrament. (Act. 2.42.) as of the Oblations.
(Act. 4.35.) The Ordination. ( Acts 6.6.) The Government. ( Acts 5.3.)
[But] upon occasion of the Greeks complaint, whose widows were not duly
regarded in the daily ministration (which was as well of the Sacrament, as of
the Oblations: otherwise the Apostles would not have left out [the mention of]
the Sacrament, in Acts 6.4.) they transferred that part upon the VII.
[Deacons.] whom they had ordained for distribution [of the Sacrament,] not for
Consecration. Act. 6. 1. Tim. 3.12, 13.

Justin. Apolog. 2. Ignatius ad Heronem. Tertull: de Baptismo. Cyprian de
lapsis: and lib. 3. epist. 9. Chrysostom. hom. 83. in Matthew. Hieron. ep: 48. ad
Sabinianum: and contra Lucifer. Ambros. Offic. lib. 1. cap. 41. Gregor. 4.88.
Council. Nicaen. 1. can. 14.

OF EVANGELISTS.
THey grew upon occasion of the scattering of the Disciples by means of the
persecution after the death of S. Stephen. ( Acts 11.19.) Of which number S.
Philip is reckoned: ( Acts 21.8.) and diverse others. ( Acts 11.19.) of whom
Eusebius makes mention, lib. 3. cap. 37. and lib. 5. cap. 10.

Upon these was transferred that part of the Apostles function, which consisted
in preaching from place to place.

OF PRIESTS.
When the Churches were in some sort planted by the preaching of the Apostles;
Prophets, and Evangelists: that they might be continually watered, and have a
standing attendance; the Apostles ordained Priests by imposition of hands in
every Church. ( Acts 14.23. and 11.30. and 21.18.)

And they made choice of the word (...), rather then of the word (...) (more in
use with the Greeks:) because it includes an Embassy, and that chiefly of
Reconciliation. which is the (...), expressed by S. Paul, in 2. Corinthians. 5.20.
(with Luke 14.32.)

OF BISHOPS.
LAst of all, that the Churches thus planted and watered, might so continue,
the Apostles ordained Overseers, to have a general care over the Churches, in
stead of themselves who first had the same, which is called (...), Acts 15.36.
and contains in it, as a strengthening or establishing that which is already
well; ( Acts 14.22. and 15.41. Revel: 3.2.) so a rectifying or redressing, if
ought be defective or amiss. ( Tit: 1.5.)

These are called, Acts 20.28. (...) in the Syrian, that is, Episcopi. by S.
John, Revel. 1.20. the Angels of the Churches.

[These were set over others, both to rule and teach.] 1. Tim: 5.17. 1. Pet:
5.2.

Upon these was transferred, the chief part of the Apostolic function:

The Oversight of the Church, Power of Commanding, Correcting, Ordaining.


The occasion which caused the Apostles to appoint Bishops, [besides the
pattern in the time of the Law,] seems to have been schisms. Such as were
in the Churches of Rome. Romans 16.17. Corinth. 1. Cor. 1.11. [and 3.3, 4.]
Galatia. Gal. 5.12. Ephesus. Ephesians. 4.2, 3. Philippi. Phil. 4.2. Colossi.
Coloss. 3.13. Thessalonica. 2 Thessalonians. 3.11. The Hebrews. Hebr. 13.9. Iam. 3.1.


For which S. Cyprian, S. Hierome and all the Fathers, take the respect to one
Governor to be an especial remedy. [for which also see] Calvin. Instit. lib.
4. cap. 4.. 2.

This power even in the Apostles time was necessary. Act. 5.5,
15.13.11.2.11.10.46.14.11.8.13.5.11, 13.
For God charge not his Church with superfluous burdens. Yet had they such
graces (as power of healing, doing signs, sundry languages, etc.) that they of
all other might seem best able to want it. For by these graces they purchased
both admiration and terror sufficient for crediting their bare word in the
whole Church.

If necessary then in their times, that were so furnished: much more in the
ages ensuing, when all those graces ceased, and no means but it to keep things
in order. So that, were it not apparent to have been in the Apostles: yet the
necessity of the times following, destitute of these helps, might enforce it.

Seeing then God has no less care for the propagation and continuance of his
Church, then for the first settling or planting of it: ( Ephesians. 4.13.) it must
needs follow, that this power was not personal in the Apostles, as tied to
them only, but a power given to the Church; and in them for their times
resident (but not ending with them, as temporary) but common to the ages after
and continuing (to whom it was more needful then to them) to repress schism
and to remedy other abuses.

So that the very same power at this day remains in the Church; and shall to
the Worlds end.

Of the PERSONS, [that executed these Offices.]
I. ALbeit the Commission were general over all Nations; which was given to
the XII. yet was that generality only by permission, not express mandatory.
Else should they have sinned that went not through all Nations.

Therefore howsoever the Commission was to all Nations: yet was it left to
their discretion, how and in what sort they would dispose themselves, as the
Holy Ghost should direct them.

So that the partition, Gal. 2.9. betwixt S. Peter and S. Paul, was lawful and
good, and no ways derogatory to Ite, praedicate. [Goe, teach all nations.]

Further, the Ecclesiastical History does testify, that they parted the Coasts
and Countries of the world among them by common advise: and so severed
themselves;

Peter, to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia. John, to Asia, Parthia. Andrew, to
Scythia, [Tontus] Euxinus and Byzantium. Philip, to upper Asia, and to
Hierapolis. Thomas, to India, Persia and the Magi. Bartholmew, to Armenia,
Lycaonia, Jndia citerior. Matthew, to Aethiopia. Simeon, to Mesopotamia,
Persia, Egypt, Afrique, Britany. Thaddaeus, to Arabia, Idumaea, Mesopotamia.
Matthias, to Aethiopia:
II. Again, albeit their preaching was for the most ambulatory: yet do the
same Histories witness, that having settled Religion, and brought the Church to
some stay; toward their end they betook themselves to residence in some one
place, diverse of them. as, S. James at Jerusalem. (Eusebius. lib. 2. cap. 1.
Epiphan. haer. 66. Hierome.) S. John at Ephesus. (Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 26.
Terturlian. lib. 4. contra Marcion. Hierome.) S. Peter, first at Antioch; and
after at Rome.


Which places were more especially accounted their Sees: and the Churches
themselves, after a more especial manner, were called Apostolic.

Seeds Apostolorum. Augustine epist. 42. Ecclesiae Apostolicae. Tertullian.
III. Thirdly, it is also plain, that the Apostles chose unto them as Helpers
((...)) diverse, who were companions with them in their journies, ministered unto
them, and supplied their absence in diverse Churches, when they themselves were
occasioned to depart.

Such were: Apollos. (Act. 19.1. 1. Cor. 3.6. Aquila. (Romans 16.3.) Archippus.
(Philem. 2. Colos. 4.17.) Aristarchus. (Act. 20.4.) Clemens. (Phil. 4.3.)
Crescens. (2. Tim. 4.10.) Demetrius. (3. John. 12.) Epaphras. (Colos. 4.12. and
1.7. and Philem. 24.) Epaphroditus. (Ph. 2.23.) Epaenetus. (Romans 16.5.)
Erastus. (Act. 19.22.) Gaius. (Act. 20.4.) Jesus Iustus. (Col. 4.11.) John
Mark. (Act. 13.5. and 15.37. and Philem. 24.) Lucas. (Philem. 24. Col. 4.14.)
Secundus. (Act. 20.4.) Silvanus. (1. Pet. 5.12. 1 Thessalonians. 1.1. 2 Thessalonians. 1.1.)
Sopater. (Act. 20.4.) Sosthenes. (1. Cor. 1.1.) Stephanas. (1. Cor. 16.15.)
Timotheus. (Act. 19.22. and 20.4.) Titus. (2. Cor. 8.23.) Trophimus. (Act.
20.4.) Tychicus. (Act. 20.4.) Vrbanus. (Romans 16.9.)


Of whom, Eusebius, lib. 3. Hist. cap. 4. Euthymius, in tertium Iohannis;
Isidorus, de Patrib. and Dorothei Synopsis.

To two of these, Timothy and Titus, the one at Ephesus the other at Crete,
(Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 4.) the Apostles imparted their own Commission, while
they yet lived, even the chief authority they had.

To appoint Priests. (Tit. 1.5. and Hieron. in eum locu^. To ordain them by
imposition of hands. (1. Tim. 5.22. 2. Tim. 2.2.) To keep safe and preserve the
Depositum. (1. Tim. 6.14, 20.2. Tim. 1.14.) To command not to teach other
things. (1. Tim. 1.3. Tit. 3.9. 2. Tim. 2.16.) To receive Accusations. (1. Tim.
5.19, 21.) To redress or correct things amiss. (Tit. 1.5.) To reject young
Widows. (1. Tim. 5.11.) [To censure Heretics and disordered persons. Tit.
1.11. and] 3.10. 1. Tim: 6.5. 2. Tim. 3.5.
And these, after the Apostles deceased, succeeded them in their charge of
Government, which was ordinary, successive and perpetual: their extraordinary
gifts of miracles and tongues ceasing with them. [So] Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap.
3. Quos and successores relinquebant; suum ipsorum locum Magisterii tradentes.

[Of the promiscuous use of their NAMES.]
These were they whom posterity called Bishops. But in the beginning, regard
was not had to distinction of Names. The authority and power was ever distinct:
the name not restrained, either in This, or Other.

The Apostles were called Priests or Seniors. (1. Pet. 5.1.) Deacons or
Ministers. (1. Cor. 3.5.) Teachers or Doctors. (1. Tim. 2.7.) Bishops or
Overseers. (Acts 1.20.) Prophets. (Acts 13.1. Revel. 22.9.) Evangelists. (1.
Cor. 9.16.)


The name of Apostle was enlarged, and made common to more then the XII.

To Barnabas. (Act. 14.4, 14.) Andronicus. (Romans 16.7.) Epaphroditus. (Phil.
2.25.) Titus and others. (2. Cor. 8.23.) Timothy (Hieron. in Cant. Chr. Eusebius.)
The Priests were called Prophets. (1. Cor. 14.32.) Bishops. (Philip. 1.1. Tit.
1.7.)
So Chrysostom, in Philip. 1. [Quid hoc? an unius civitatis multi erant
episcopi? Nequaquam: sed Presbyteros isto nomine appellavit. Tunc enim nomina
adhuc erant communia.] Hierome: Hic episcopos Presbyteros intelligimus; non
enim in una urbe plures Episcopi esse potuissent. Theodoret: Non fieri quidem
poterat, ut multi Episcopi essent unius civitat is pastores; quo sit, ut essent
soli Presbyteri, quos vocavit Episcopos. and in 1. Tim. 3. Eosdem olim vocabant
Episcopos and Presbyteros: eos autem qui nunc vocantur Episcopi, nominabant
Apostolos. Oecumenius: Non quod in una civitate multi essent Episcopi, etc. For
in the Apostles absence in Churches new planted, the oversight was in them;
till the Apostles ordained and sent them a Bishop, either by reason of some
schism or for other causes. The Bishops (as the Ecclesiastical History
recounteth them) were called Apostles. (Philip. 2.25.) Evangelists. (2. Tim.
4.5.) Diaconi. (1. Tim. 4.6.) Priests. (1. Tim. 5.17.)

[For it is plain by the epistle of Irenaeus to Victor, in] Eusebius, lib. 5.
cap. 26. that they at the beginning were called Priests, that in very truth and
propriety of speech were Bishops. And by Theodoret [in 1. Tim. 3.] that they
which were Bishops, were at the first called Apostles.

The name (...), says Suidas, was given [by the Athenians to them which were
sent to oversee the Cities that were under their jurisdiction. (...).]

The name Episcopus was given among the Romans to him, qui praeerat pani and
vaenalibus ad victum quotidianum. ff. de munerib. and honorib.

Cicere, ad Atticum lib. 7. epist. 10. Vult me Pompeius esse, quem tota haec
Campania and maritima ora habeat Episcopum.

The name in Hebrew (...) Genesis 41.34. seems to have relation to the second
use. for they were such as had charge of the grain laying up, and selling
under Joseph.

[The necessary use of the BISHOPS office, and the charge committed to him.]
The party, who in the New Testament is called Episcopus, is in the Old called
(...) (Psalm. 109.8. with Act. 1.20.)

In a house or family, it is first affirmed of Joseph, Genesis 39.4. who had the
oversight and government of the rest of the servants.

In a house there may be many servants, which have places of charge: but there
is one that has the charge of all; that is, Oeconomus, the Steward.

So do the Apostles term themselves. (1. Cor. 4.1.) and their office. (1.
Cor. 9.17.) and their successors the Bishops. (Tit. 1.7.) Vid. Hilar. in
Matthew. 24.45. In a flock, Vid. Hierenym. epist. 4. ad Ruslicum (cap. 6.) and
epist. 85. ad Evagrium.
the Pastor. (Ioh. 21.15. Act. 20.28. Mat. 25.32. 1. Pet. 5.2. Ephesians. 4.11.)
In a Camp, the Captain. (Matthew. 2.6. Hebr. 13.7, 17, 24.) In a ship, the
Governor: (1. Cor. 12.28.) under whom others. (Act. 13.5.) In the
Commonwealth, they be such as are set over Officers, to hasten them forward,
and see they do their duties. as in 2. Chron. 34.12. and 31.13. Nehem. 11.22.
and 12.42. So that, what a Steward is in a house, a Pastor in a flock, a
Captain in a Camp, a Master in a ship, a Surveiour in an office:
That is a Bishop in the Ministry.
Upon him lies, [to take care of the Churches under him.] 2. Cor. 11.28.
Philip. 2.20. 1. Pet. 5.2. Council. Antiochen. can. 9. [and for that end to
visit them.] Act. 9.32. and 15.36. [and to be observant]

Of that which is Well and orderly; [to confirm it.] Act. 15.41. Revel. 3.2.
Otherwise; [to redress it.] Tit. 1.5.
To him was committed;

I. Authority of ordeyning: (Tit. 1.5.) and so of begetting Fathers. (Epiph.
haeres. 75.) See Ambrose, Theodoret and Oecumenius, in 1. Timoth. 3. Damasus,
epist. 3. Hierome, epist. 85. ad Evagr. Leo, epist. 88. Council. Ancyran. can.
12. al. 13.

For though S. Paul should mention a Company with him at the ordeyning of
Timothy: (1. Tim. 4.14.) yet it follows not, but that he only was the
Ordeyner. No more, then that Christ is the only Judge: although the XII. shall
sit with him on Thrones. (Luc. 22.30.)

II. Authority of enjoining or forbidding. (1. Tim. 1.3. Ignat. ad Magnesian.
Cyprian. epist. 39.)

III. Authority of holding Courts, and receiving accusations. (1. Tim. 5.19. 1.
Cor. 5.12. Revel. 2.2. Augustine. de opere monachor. cap. 29.)

IV. Authority of correcting. (1. Tim. 1.3. Tit. 1.5. Hieron. contra Lucifer.
cap. 4. and epist. 53. ad Riparium. Cyprian. ep. 38. ad Rogatianum.)

V. Authority of appointing Fasts. (Tertullian advers. Psychicos.)

OXFORD, Printed by LEON. LICHFIELD, Anno Dom. 1641.

THE JUDGMENT OF M. BUCER, touching the Original of BISHOPS And METROPOLITANS.
BY the perpetual observation of the Churches, M. Bucer, de Regno Christi (ad
R. Edvardum VI.) lib. 2. cap. 12. (inter scripta ejusdem Anglicana, page 67.)
even from the Apostles themselves, we do see, that it seemed good to the holy
Ghost, that among the Presbyters, to whom the ordering of the Churches was
chiefly committed, some one should be appointed to have a singular charge of
the Churches and the whole sacred Ministry: who by that care and solicitude
had a presidency over all the rest. For which cause, the name of of Bishop was
peculiarly attributed unto these chief governors of Churches: although they
ought to decree nothing without the counsel of the rest of the Presbyters; who
themselves also, by reason of this common administration of the Churches, have
the name of Bishops in the Scriptures given unto them.

So we may see, Idem, de Animarum cura officioque Pastor. Eccles. (ibid. page
280.)
Act. 20.28. that by the ordinance of the holy Ghost, the care of souls and
the pastoral office ought to be imposed upon all the Presbyters of the Church
in common. And from hence S. Hierome did rightly collect, that the Presbyters
and Bishops office and charge was one and the same. Hierome indeed writes this
withal: that in the beginning of the Church those Presbyters took care of the
Church and governed it by common counsel; and that then at length one of the
Presbyters was set over the rest, and peculiarly called a Bishop, when sects
and heresies began to arise in the Church, and every one labored to advance
his own sect. But it is not credible, that this was so observed long, nor in
all Churches neither. For (as we have clear testimonies out of the Fathers
that were more ancient then Hierome) in all the chief Churches from the
Apostles times thus it was observed, that the Episcopal office indeed was
imposed upon all the Presbyters: yet so notwithstanding that always, even in
the times of the Apostles themselves, one of the Presbyters was chosen and
ordained to be a guide of this office and as it were a Prelate; who went before
all the rest, and had the care of souls and administered the Episcopal office
chiefly and in the highest degree.

Hence also our Lord, Idem, de vi and usu S. ministerii; explicat.
Cantabrigiae, ann. 1550. ( ibid. page 581. 582.)
when he would have his to be conjoined and cohere one with another, as members
do in the body, he subjecteth every one of his unto others; by whom, as by
members of a more ample and large power and efficacy, he might be preserved,
moved and directed. The same does the holy Ghost command, Ephesians. 5.21. Submit
your selves one to another in the fear of God. The holy Fathers therefore of
old considering these things, appointed such an order in the Clergy, that all
the rest of that rank should be kept and governed by the singular care of the
Presbytery: and that among the Presbyters, the Bishop (as the Consul among the
Senators of the Commonwealth) should take upon him the chief care and
custody, as of the whole Church, so specially of the whole order of the Clergy.

Such Bishops did they ordain in all more populous Churches: and to each of
those Churches they commended those others that were more near unto them in
the smaller towns or villages. And to that purpose would have each of the
Presbyters and overseers of those Churches, whom they called Chorepiscopi, to
be obedient to the Bishop and Presbytery that was next unto them: whom those
other prime Bishops did upon all occasions call together with the rest of their
Clergy, and informed them in the skill and diligence which was to be used in
the discharge of their function.

Now seeing it was Gods will, that all his servants should mutually embrace and
take care each of other, as far and wide as their ability could reach unto
(all Christians being but one body:) the holy Fathers did ordain, that the
Bishops of every Province (for all the nations subject to the Romans were now
distributed into Provinces) should meet together with the Presbyters and
Deacons, as often as the need of the Churches did so require, but constantly
twice in the year: that they might enquire touching Christ's doctrine and
discipline, how it was administered and maintained in every Church; and where
they did find any thing faulty they might correct it, but such things as they
did find were right they might confirm and further.

And that these Synods might be administered rightly and in due order, they
would have the Metropolitans take the charge both of congregating and
moderating them; to wit the Bishops of every Metropolis: for so was the chief
city of every Province called, wherein was the Court of the supreme President.
And to this end they imposed upon these Metropolitan Bishops a kind of charge
and care of all the Churches within their Province: that if they did understand
any thing were not rightly ordained or done, either by the ministers of the
Churches or by the people, they might admonish them thereof in time, and if by
their admonitions they could not amend it, they might call together a Synod of
the Bishops to correct it.

The Judgment of DOCTOR RAINOLDES, touching the same.
When Act. 14.23.
Elders were ordained by the Apostles in every Church, Tit. 1.5.
through every City, D. Rainold. Conference with Heart; in the end of the 3. and
beginning of the 5. division.
Act. 20.28.
to (...), that is, to do the duty of a Pastor to it.
feed the flock of Christ, whereof the holy Ghost had made them Overseers:
they, to the intent they might the better do it by common counsel and
consent, did use to assemble themselves and meet together. In the which
meetings, for the more orderly handling and concluding of things pertaining to
their charge; they chose one amongst them to be the President of their company,
and Moderatour of their actions. As in the Church of Ephesus, though it had
Acts 20.17
sundry Elders and Pastors to guide it; yet amongst those sundry, was there one
chief, whom our Savior calls Rev. 2, 1.
the Angel of the Church, and writes that to him which by him the rest should
know.

And this is he whom afterward in the Primitive Church the Fathers called
Bishop. For as the name of Ministers, 1. Cor. 4.1.
common to all them who serve Christ in Luke 12.42.
the stewardship of the mysteries of God, that is, in preaching of the Gospel,
is now by the custom of our English speech restrained to Elders who are under
a Bishop: 1. Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.7. Act. 20.28.
so the name of Bishop common to all Elders and Pastors of the Church, was then
by the usual language of the Fathers appropriated to him who had the
Presidentship over Elders.

Thus are certain Elders reproved by Epist. 12.
Cyprian, for receiving to the Communion them who had fallen (in time of
persecution) before the Bishop had advised of it with them and others. And
Euseh. hist. Eccles. lib. 6. cap. 42.
Cornelius writes that the Catholic Church committed to his charge had six
and forty Elders, and ought to have but one Bishop. And both of them being
Bishops, the one of Rome, the other of Carthage, Cornelius Cypriano. Ep. 46.
Cyprianus Presbyteris and Deaconis. Ep. 6.
do witness of themselves that they dealt in matters of their Churches
government by the consent or counsel of the company of Elders or the
Eldership, as they both (after S. Paul) do call it.

In this sort then the Elders (as I said) ordained by the Apostles in every
Church, Cornelius Ep. 46. apud Cyprianum.
through every city, chose one amongst themselves, whom they called Bishop, 1.
Tim. 4.14.
to be the President of their company; for the better handling and ordering of
things in their assemblies and meetings, wherein they provided by common
counsel and consent for the guiding of the flock of Christ committed to them.
Which point of care and wisdom, the Bishops following also (knowing that Prove.
11.14.
where counsels want, the people falls; but in the amplenesse of
counselors there is health) had their meetings likewise for conference
together, when things of greater weight required more advise: and they chose to
their President therein the Bishop of the chiefest city in the Province, whom
they called the Metropolitan.

with us, do hear at certain times the causes of the whole shire: so the
ruler of the Province with them did minister justice, and made his abode there
ordinarily. Whereupon, by reason that men for their business made great
concourse thither: the Church was wont to furnish it (of godly policy) with the
worthiest Bishop, endued with gifts above his brethren. And they reposed in
him such affiance, that they did not only commit the Council. Antioch. can. 20.

The Original of BISHOPS and Metropolitans, set down By JAMES Archbishop of
ARMAGH.
THe ground of Episcopacy is fetched partly from the pattern prescribed by God
in the Old Testament: and partly from the imitation thereof brought in by the
Apostles and confirmed by Christ himself in the time of the New. The
government of the Church of the Old Testament was committed to the Priests and
Levits: unto whom the ministers of the New do now succeed; in like sort as our
Lords day has done unto their Sabbath. that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the Prophet, touching the vocation of the Gentiles. Esai. 66.21.
I will take of them for Priests, and for Levits, says the Lord.

That the Priests were superior to the Levites, no man doubts: and that
there was not a parity, either betwixt the Priests or betwixt the Levits
themselves, is manifest by the word of God; wherein mention is made of the
Heads and Rulers both of the one and of the other. 1. Chron. XXIV. 6, 31. and
Ezr. VIII. 29.

The Levits were distributed into the three families of the Gershonites,
Cohathites, and Merarites: and over each of them God appointed one (...) (...)
or Ruler. Number. III. 24, 30, 35. The Priests were divided by David into four
and twenty courses; 1. Chr. XXIV. who likewise had their Heads: who in the

19.14. etc.
(...), or chief of the Priests; and clearly distinguished from that singular
one, who was the type of our Hebr. 4.14.
great High Priest, that is passed into the Heavens, Jesus the son of God. Yea
in the XI. of Nehemy, we find two named Bishops; the one of the Priests, the
other of the Levits that dwelt in Jerusalem. The former so expressly termed
by the Greek in the 14th. the latter both by the Greek and Latin Interpreter in
the (...). LXX Episccopus Levitarum. Hieron.
22. verse: and not without approbation of the Scripture it self, which renders
the (...) Psalm. 109.8.
Hebrew word of the same original in the old, by the Act. 1.20.
Greek (...) in the new Testament.

Of Levi it was said by Moses the man of God: Deuteronomy. 33.10.
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put
incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine Altar. Because this
latter part of their office has ceased with them, and the Leviticall Altar
(the truth prefigured thereby being now exhibited) is quite taken away: may not
we therefore conclude out of the former part (which has no such typical
relation in it) that our Bishops and Presbyters should be (as the Apostle would
have them to be) 1. Tim. 3.2.
(...) apt to teach; Tit. 1.9.
able by sound doctrine both to exhort, and to convince the gainsayers? Nay
and out of the latter part it self; where God had appointed, that Deuteronomy. 28.1.
the Priests the Levits and all the Tribe of Levi should eat the offerings of
the Lord made by fire: does not the Apostle by just analogy infer from
thence, that forasmuch as 1. Cor. 9.13, 14.
they which waited at the altar, were partaker with the altar; even so had the
Lord ordained, that they which preached the Gospel, should live of the Gospel?

With what show of reason then can any man imagine, that what was instituted by
God in the Law, for mere matter of government and preservation of good order
(without all respect of type or ceremony:) should now be rejected in the
Gospel, as a device of Antichrist? that what was by the Lord once Iorem. 2.21.
planted a noble vine, wholly a right seed, should now be so turned into the
degenerate plant of a strange vine; that no purging or pruning of it will serve
the turn, but it must be cut down root and branch, as Matthew. 15.13.
a plant which our heavenly Father had never planted? But nothing being so
familiar now a days, as to father upon Antichrist, whatsoever in Church
matters we do not find to suite with our own humors: the safest way will be,
to consult with Christ himself herein, and hear what he delivers in the
cause.

These things says he, that has the seven stars. Revel. III. 1. He owneth
then, we see, these stars; whatsoever they be. and, the mystery of them he
thus further opens unto his beloved Disciple. The seven stars, which thou
saw in my right hand, are the Angels of the seven Churches. Revel. I. 20.
From which words a learned man, very much devoted to the now so highly admired
Discipline, deduceth this conclusion. Quanta igitur dignitas verorum Pastorum,
qui tum stellae sunt, non in alio firmamento quam in dextra Chrisli fixae, tum
Angeli? Tho. Brightman. in Apocalypse. 1.20.
How great therefore is the dignity of true Pastors, who are both STARS,
fixed in no other firmament then in the right hand of Christ, and ANGELS?

He had considered well, that in the Church of Ephesus (one of the seven here
pointed at) there were many Act. 20.17, 28.
PRESBYTERS, whom the holy, Ghost had made BISHOPS, or Overseers, over all that
flock; to feed the Church of God, which he had purchased with his own blood.
And withal he saw, that by admitting one Angel there above the rest (all, as
well Judge. 2.1. Hagg. 1.13. Matthew. 11.18.
extraordinary Prophets, as Malach. 2.7.
ordinary Pastors, being in their own several stations accounted Angels or
Messengers of the Lord of Hosts) he should be forced also to acknowledge the
eminency of one Bishop above the other Bishops (that name being in those days
Philip. 1.1. 1. Tim. 1.2. Tit. 1.5, 7.
common unto all the Presbyters) and to yield withal, that such a one was to
be esteemed as a star fixed in no other firmament then in the right hand of
Christ.

To salve this therefore; all the stars in every Church must be presupposed
to be of one magnitude, and though those stars which typified these Angels
are said to be but seven, yet the Angels themselves must be maintained to be
far more in number: and in fine, where our Savior says, Revel. z. 1.
unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write; it must by no means be
admitted, that Nec uni alicut Angelo mittuntur, sed toti (ut ita dicam)
Collegio Pastorum; quiomnes hac communi voce comprchenduntur. Non enim un us
erat Angelus Ephesi, sed plures: nec inter istos aliquls Princeos. Brigheman.
in Apolyps. 2 1.
any one Angel should be meant hereby, but the whole College of Pastors
rather. And all upon pretense of a poor show of some shallow reasons; that
there was not one Angel of Ephesus but many, and among them not any Principal.

Which wreasting of the plain words of our Savior is so extreme violent;
that M. Beza (though every way as zealously affected to the advancement of the
new Discipline as was the other) could by no means digest it: but ingenuously
acknowledges the meaning of our Lords direction to have been this. (...). id
est, (...). Quem nimirun opertuit inprimis de his rebus admoneri, ac per cum
caereros Collegas, toranque ade^ Ecclesiam. Bez. in Apocalypse. 2.1.
To the Angel, that is, to the President: as whom it behooved specially to be
admonished touching those matters; and by him, both the rest of his colleagues,
and the whole Church likewise. And that there was then a standing President
over the rest of the Pastors of Ephesus, and he the very same (as learned
Conference with Heart, c. 8 divis. 3.
Doctor Rainoldes adds) with him whom afterward the Fathers called Bishop;
may further be made manifest, not only by the succession of the first Bishops
of that Church, but also by the clear testimony of Ignatius; who (within no
greater compass of time then twelve years afterward) distinguishes the
singular and constant President thereof, from the rest of the number of the
Presbyters, by appropriating the name of Bishop unto him.

As for the former: we find it openly declared in the general Council of
Chalvedon, by Leontius Bishop of Magnesia; that (...). Council. Chalcedon. Act.
11.
from Timothy (and so from the days of the Apostles) there had been a
continued succession of seven and twenty Bishops; all of them ordained in
Ephesau. Of which number the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, mentioned in the
Revelation, must needs be one: whether it were Timothy himself, as Vid.
Perer. in Apocalypse. cap. 2. disp. 2. Alcasar. Prooem, in cap. 2. and 3.
Apocal. notar. 1. and Petr. Halloix. Notat in vit. Polycarp. c. 7.
some conceive, or one of his next Successors, as others rather do imagine.

in the subscription of the second Epistle to Timothy, and the Ecclesiastical
History of Eusebius. Hist. lib. 3. (...).

Church of Ephesus, but borne also within six or seven and thirty years after
S. John wrote the forenamed Epistle unto the Angel of that Church: as it
appears by the years he was of, when he wrote that Epistle unto Victor
Bishop of Rome, wherein he makes mention of (...). Polycrat. Epist. ad

Eusebius and Hierom specify it. From thence there are but twelve years
reckoned unto the tenth of Trajan: wherein Ignatius, in that last journey which
he made for the consummation of his glorious Martyrdom at Rome, wrote another
Epistle unto the selfsame Church of Ephesus. In which he makes mention of
their then Bishop Onesimus: as it appears both by Eusebius. l. 3. hist. (...).

Revelation. wherein he also (...) [(...)] (...). Id. in epist. ad Smyrn.

no man ought either to administer the Sacraments, or do any thing

Polycarpus was then Bishop, when S. John wrote unto the Angel of the Church in

worthy men, (...). Iren. advers. haeres. lib. 3. cap. 3.

Eusebius lib. 5. (...).) and ad Victorem. (ibid. (...).)
was present, when he himself did discourse of his conversation with S. John,
and of those things which he heard from those who had seen our Lord Jesus.

Polycarpus, (...). Iren. lib. 3. cap. 3. Vid. and Eusebius. lib. 3. hist. (...).
says he, was not only taught by the Apostles and conversed with many of those
that had seen Christ, but also was by the Apostles constituted in Asia Bishop
of the Church which is in Smyrna: whom we our selves also did see in our
younger age. for he continued long and being very aged, he most gloriously and
nobly suffering Martyrdom departed this life.

Now being ordained Bishop of Smyrna by the Apostles; who had finished their
course, and departed out of this life before S. John (the last surviver of
them) did write his Revelation: who but he could there be meant by the Angel
of the Church in Smyrna? in which that he still held his Episcopal office unto
the time of his Martyrdom (which fell out LXXIV. years afterward) may
sufficiently appear by this testimony, which the brethren of the Church of
Smyrna, who were present at his suffering, gave unto him. (...). Smyrnens.
Eccles. epist. de martyrio Polycarpi. Eusebius. lib. 4. bist. (...).
He was the most admirable man in our times, an Apostolical and Prophetical
Doctor, and Bishop of the Catholic Church which is in Smyrna. Whereunto we may
add the like of Polycrates Bishop of Ephesus, who lived also in his time and in
his neighborhood, affirming (...). Polycrat. epist. ad Victorem: apud Eusebius.
lib. 5. hist. (...).
Polycarpus to have been both Bishop and Martyr in Smyrna. So says he in his
Synodicall Epistle, directed unto Victor Bishop of Rome, about 27 years after
the Martyrdom of Polycarpus; he himself being at that time 65 years of age.

About the very same time wherein Polycrates wrote this Epistle unto Victor,
did Tertullian publish his book of Prescriptions against Heretics: wherein he
avoucheth against them, that Sicut Smyrnaeorum Ecclesia Polycarpum ab Iohanne
conlocatum resert; sicut Romanorum Clementem a Petro ordinatum edit: proinde
(or, perinde) utique and caeterae exhibent quos, ab Apostolis in Episcopa tum
constitutos, Apostolici seminis traduces habent. Tertul. de Praescript. cap.
32. Vid. and ejusd. lib 4. contra Marcion. cap. 5.
as the Church of Smyrna had Polycarpus placed there by John, and the Church of
Rome Clement ordained by Peter; so the rest of the Churches also did show, what
Bishops they had received by the appointment of the Apostles, to traduce the
Apostolical seed unto them. And so before him did Irenaeus urge against them
Successiones Episcoporum, quibus Apostolicam quae in unoqueque loco est
Ecclesiam tradiderunt. Iren. lib. 4. advers. haeres. cap. 63.
the successions of Bishops, unto whom the Apostles committed the charge of the
Church in every place. Omnes enim ii valde posteriores sunt quam Episcopi,
quibus Apostoli tradiderunt Ecclesias. Id. lib. 5. cap. 20.
For all the Heretics (faith he) are much later then those Bishops, unto whom
the Apostles committed the Churches. And, Habemus annumerare eos qui ab
Apostolis instituti sunt Episcope in Ecclestis, and sucaessores eorum usque ad
nos; qui nihil tale docuerunt neque cognoverunt quale ab his deliratur. Id.
lib. 3. cap. 3.
we are able to number those who by the Apostles were ordained Bishops in the
Churches, and their Successors unto our days; who neither taught nor knew any
such thing as these men dream of.

For proof whereof, he brings in the succession of the Bishops of Rome, from
(...). Id. ibid.
Linus (unto whom the blessed Apostles committed that Episcopacy) and Anacletus
(by others called Cletus) and Clement (who did both see the Apostles, and
conferred with them) unto (...). Ibid.
Eleutherius; who when Irenaeus wrote, had the charge of that Bishopric in the
twelfth place after the Apostles. Concerning whom, and the integrity which then
continued in each other succession from the Apostles days, Hegesippus, who at
the same time published his History of the Church, says thus. (...). Hegesip.
apud Eusebius. lib. 4. hist: (...).
Soter succeeded Anicetus, and after him was Eleutherius. Now, in every
succession, and in every City, all things so stand, as the Law and the
Prophets, and our Lord do preach.

When this Cum Elcutherius vir sanctus Pontificatui Romanae Ecclesiae
praeesset, misit ad eum Lucius Britanncrum Rex epistolam: obsecrans ut per ejus
mandatum Christianus efficeretur. Et mox essectum piae poslulationis consecutus

Eleutherius (as our Bid relates) was Bishop of the Church of Rome, Lucius
King of the Britains sent an Epistle to him; desiring that by his means he
might be made Christian. Who presently obtained the effect of his pious
request: and the Britains kept the faith then received sound and undefiled in
quiet peace, until the times of Dioclesian the Emperor. By whose bloody
persecution the faith and discipline of our British Churches was not yet so
quite extinguished; but that within ten years after (and eleven before the
first general Council of Nice) three of our Bishops were present and
subscribed unto the Council of Arles: Tom. 1. Concilior. Gall i.e., a Sirmondo
edit page 9.
Eborius of York, Restitutus of London, and Adelsius of Colchester, called

beyond Elentherius, and as high as S. Peter himself: if it be true, that he
(...). Metaphrast. Commentar. de Petro and Paulo; ad diem 29. lunii.
constituted Churches here, and ordained Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in
them; as Symeon Metaphrastes relates out of some part of (...). Ibid.
Eusebius (as it seems) that is not come unto our hands.

But, to return unto the Angels of the seven Churches, mentioned in the
Revelation of S. John: by what has been said, it is apparent, that seven
singular Bishops, who were the constant Presidents over those Churches, are
pointed at under that name. For other sure they could not be; if all of them
were cast into one mould, and were of the same quality with Polycarpus, the
then Angel of the Church in Smyrna: who without all question was such, if any
credit may be given herein unto those that saw him and were well acquainted
with him.

And as Tertullian in express terms affirms him to have been placed there
by S. John himself (in the testimony before alleged out of his Tertull.
Praescript. c. 32. Similiter and Hieronymus in Catal. script. Ecclesiast. cap.
17. in Polycarpo; and Nicepherus, lib. 3. Hist. Ecclesiast. cap. 2.
Prescriptions:) so does he elsewhere, from the order of the succeeding
Bishops, not obscurely intimate, that the rest of that number were to be
referred unto the same descent. Habemus and Ioannis alumnas Ecclesias. Nam etsi
Apocalypsim ejus Marcion respuit: ordo tamen Episcoporum ad originem recensus,
in Ioannem stabit auctorem. Sic and caeterarum generositas recognoscitur.
Tertulsian. a lvers. Marcion. lib. 4. c. 5.
We have, says he, the Churches that were bred by John. For although Marcion
do reject his Revelation; yet the order of the Bishops reckoned up unto their
original, will stand for John to be their Founder.

Neither does the ancient Writer of the Martyrdom of Timothy (mentioned by
Photius) mean any other by those seven Bishops, whose assistance he says S.
John did use, after his return from Patmos, in the government of the
Metropolis of the Ephesians. For (...). Phot. Bibliothec. number. 254.
being revoked from his exile, says he, by the sentence of Nerva, he betook
himself to the Metropolis of Ephesus; and being assisted with the presence of
SEVEN Bishops, he took upon him the government of the Metropolis of the
Ephesians: and continued, preaching the word of piety, until the Empire of
Trajan.

That he remained with the Ephesians and the rest of the brethren of Asia,
until the days of Trajan, and that during the time of his abode with them, he
published his Gospel; is sufficiently witnessed by Irenae. advers heraes. lib
2 cap. 39. item, lib. 3. c. 1. and 3.
Irenaeus. That upon his return from the Island, after the death of Domitian,
he applied himself to the government of the Churches of Asia, is confirmed
likewise both by Eusebius. lib. 3. hist. (...). Hieronym. in Catal. scrip.
Ecclesiast. cap. 9.
Eusebius, and by t Hierom: who further adds, that Id. ibid. and Praefar. in
Evangel. Matthaei.
at the earnest entreaty of the Bishops of Asia he wrote there his Gospel.

And that he himself also, being free from his banishment, did ordain Bishops
in diverse Churches, is clearly testified by Clement of Alexandria; who lived
in the next age after, and delivers it as a certain truth, which he had
received from those who went before him and could not be far from the time
wherein the thing it self was acted. (...). Clem. Alexandrin, in lib. de

And thus have we deduced Episcopacy from the Apostolical times: and declared
withal, that the Angels of the seven Churches were no other, but such as in the
next age after the Apostles were by the Fathers termed Bishops. It follows
now that we enquire, why these Churches are confined within the number of
seven, in the superscription of that Apostolical Epistle prefixed before the
book of the Revelation. Revel. 1.4.
John to the seven Churches in Asia: Grace be unto you and peace. where S. John
directing his setters unto them thus indefinitly, without any mention of their
particular names; he cannot by common intendment be conceived to have
understood any other thereby, but such as by some degree of eminency were
distinguishable from all the rest of the Churches that were in Asia, and in
some sort also did comprehend all the rest under them.

For taking Asia here in the most strict sense, for the Lydian or (as the Co.
l. Theodos. lib. 16. tit. 1. de fide Cathol. leg. 3.
Imperial Constitutions call it) the Proconsular Asia: it is not to be
imagined, that after so long pains taken by the Apostles and their disciples
in the husbanding of that part of the Lords vineyard, there should be found no
more but seven Churches therein. especially since S. Paul that 1. Cor. 3.10.
wise master builder professes, that he had here 1. Cor. 16.8, 9.
a great door and effectual opened unto him: and S. Luke testifyeth
accordingly, that Act. 19.10, 20.
all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks; so mightily grew the word of God and prevayled. Which extraordinary
blessing of God upon his labors, moved the Apostle to make his residence Act.

in those parts for the space of three years: wherein he ceased not to warn
every one night and day with tears.

And in particular; among the Epistles of Ignatius (written but twelve years,
as has been showed, after the mention of these seven Churches made in the
Apocalypse) there is one directed to the Church in Trallis (which by (...).

Ptolemy likewise, Thyatira is expressly named a Metropolis: as Philadelphia
also is, in the Council. Constantino. sub Menna, Act. 5.
Greek Acts of the Council of Constantinople held under Menna. Which gives us
good ground to conceive, that the seven Cities, in which these seven Churches
had their seat, were all of them Metropoliticall, and so had relation unto the
rest of the towns and cities of Asia, as unto daughters rising under them.

The Lydian Asia was separated from Caria by the river Maeander: upon the banks
whereof were seated both Trallis and Magnesia; which in the Hieroclis Notit.

which had presidency in the place of the Region of the Romans; and in the body

as he intimates himself to have been not only the Bishop of Antioch, but also
of the rest of the province Syria, which was under that Metropolis: so does he
likewise not obscurely signify that the Bishop of Rome had at that time a
presidency over the Churches that were in the Ex Vrblca. ria Regione. Cod.

Vrbicarian Region, as the Imperial Constitutions, or the Ex Provincia Romana,

Roman Province, as the Acts of the first Council of Arles call it.

What that Vrbicarian Region was, I will not now stand to discuss: whether
Tuscia only, wherein Rome it self was situated (which in the days of Ignatius
was one entire region, but afterward divided into Tuscia Suburbicaria and
Annonaria) or the territory wherein the Praefectus Vrbis did exercise his
jurisdiction (which was confined within the compass of a hundred miles about
the City) or, with that, those other provinces also whereunto the authority of
the Vicarius Vrbis did extend; or lastly the circuit within which those 69
Bishoprics were contained that Insuper praeter septem collaterales Episcopos
erant alii Episcopt, qui dicuntur suffraganci Romani Pontificis, nulli alii
Primati vel Archiepiscopo subjectis qui frequenter ad Synodos vocarentur. MS.
Vatican. apud Baron, ann. 1057.. 23.
were immediately subject to the Bishop of Rome and frequently called to his
Synods; the names whereof are found registered in the Records of that Church.
The antiquity of which number as it may in some sort receive confirmation from
the Roman Synod of seventy Bishops held under Gelasius: so for the distinction
of the Bishops which belonged to the city of Rome, from those that appertayned
to Italy, we have a far more ancient testimony from the Edict of the Emperor
Aurelian; who in the controversy that arose betwixt Paulus Samosatenus and
Domnus for the house which belonged unto the Church of Antioch, commanded that
it should be delivered to them, (...): says Niceophorus Callist. lib. 6. hist.

At hanasius, may likewise be observed: the name of Italy being in a more
strict sense applied therein to the seven provinces, which were under the
civil jurisdiction of the Vicarius or Lieutenant of Italy, and the
Ecclesiastical of the Bishop of Millaine.

And it is well worth the observing, that the Fathers of the great Council of
Nice afterward confirming this kind of primacy, not only in the Bishops of
Rome and Antioch, (...). Council. Nicaen. 1. Can. 6.
but also in the Metropolitans of other Provinces; do make their entrance into
that Canon, with (...). Let the ANCIENT customs continue. Which opens unto
us the meaning of that complaint which, some threescore and ten years before
this, S. Cyprian made against Novatianus, for the confusion which by his
schism he brought upon the Churches of God: that Cum jampridem per omnes
provincias, and per urbes singulas, ordinati sint Episcopi in aetate antiqui,
in fide integri, in pressura probati, in persecutione proscripti; ille super
eos creare alios pseudoepiscopos audeat. Cyprian. epist. 52.
whereas long since in all Provinces, and in all Cities, Bishops had been
ordained, in age ancient, sound in faith, tried in affliction, proscribed in
persecution; yet took he the boldness, to create other false Bishops over
their heads. namely, subordinate Bishops in every City, and Metropolitans in
every Province.

In Africa at that time, although there were many civil Provinces, yet was
there but one Ecclesiastical: whereof Cyprian himself was (...). Council.

Archbishop; as the Fathers of the Trullan Synod call him. It pleased, says
he in one of his Epistles, Vniversis Episcopis, vel in nostra provincia vel

all the Bishops constituted either in our province or beyond the sea:
intimating thereby, that all the Bishops which were on his side the sea did
belong unto one province. Quoniam latius fusa est nostra provincia; habet etiam
Numidiam and Mauritanias duas sibi cohaerentes. Id. epist, 45.
For our province, says he in another place, is spread more largely; having
Numidia also, and both the Mauritaniaes, annexed unto it. Whence that great
Council assembled by him for determining the question touching the baptizing
of those that had been baptized by Heretics, is said to be gathered Ex

out of the province of Africa, Numidia and Mauritania. For howsoever in the
civil government, the Proconsular Africa (wherein Carthage was seated) Numidia
and both the Mauritanies ( Sitifensis and Caesareensis) were accounted three
distinct provinces: yet in the Ecclesiastical administration they were joined
together and made but one province, immediately subject to the Metropoliticall
jurisdiction of the prime see of Carthage.

Some threescore years before this African Council was held by Cyprian, those
other Provincial Synods were assembled by the Metropolitans of sundry nations,
for the composing of the Paschall controversy, then hotly pursued: and among
the rest, that in our neighbor country, out of (...). Eusebius. histor. lib. 5.

there, Eusebius (the ancientest Ecclesiastical historian now extant) deriveth

he was by Paul ordained Bishop of that great country, and had commission to

For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou should set in order the
things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every city, as I had appointed
thee. Out of which M. Calvin collecteth this doctrine unto us for the general.
Discimus ex hoc loco, non eam fuisse tunc aequalitatem inter Ecclesiae
ministros, quin unus aliquis autoritate and consilio praeesset. Calvin. in Tit.
1.5.
We learn out of this place, that there was not then such an equality betwixt
the ministers of the Church, but that there was some one who was president over
the rest both in authority and in counsel. and S. Chrysostom, for the
particular of Titus. (...). Chrysostom. in Tit. 1. homil. 1.
Had he not been an approved man, he would not have committed that whole Island
unto him: he would not have commanded him to supply the things that were
defective; he would not have committed unto him the judgment of so many
Bishops, if he had not had very great confidence in the man. and B. Jewel upon
him again. Having the government of many Bishops; what may we call him but an
Archbishop?

Which is not so much to be wondered at, when we see that the Bishops of another
Island stick not (and that without any control) to deduce the ordination of
their Metropolitan from the Apostolic times, in the face of the whole general
Council of Ephesus. For whereas the Patriarch of Antioch did claym an interest
in the ordaining of the Metropolitan of Cyprus: the Bishops of that Island
prescribed to the contrary, that A sanctis Apostolis nunquam possunt ostendere,
quod adfuerit Antiochenus and ordinaverit, vel communicaverit unquam insulae
ordinationis gratiam, neque alius quisquam. Council. Ephcsin. Act. 7.
from the time of the holy Apostles it could never be showed, that the Bishop
of Antioch was ever present at any such ordination, or did ever communicate the
grace of ordination to that Island; and that the former Bishops of Constantia
(the Metropolis of Cyprus) Troilus, Sabinus, Epiphanius, Et nunc memorati
Episcopi, and qui ante illos sanctissimi Episcopi, and qui a sanctis Aposlolis
erant omnes ortho loxi, ab his qui in Cypro conslituti sunt. Ibid.
and all the holy and orthodoxe Bishops which were before them, ever since the
holy Apostles, were constituted by those which were in Cyprus. and therefore
desired, that Sicut initio a temporibus Apostolorum, and constitutionibus. and
canonibus sanctissime and magnae Synodi Nicaenae, illaesa and superior insidiis
and potentia permansit nostra Cypriorum synodus. Ibid.
as in the beginning from the times of the Apostles, and by the constitutions
and canons of the most holy and great Synod of Nice, the Synod of the Cyprian
Bishops remained untouched and superior to privy underminings and open power;
so they might still be continued in the possession of their ancient right.
Whereupon the Council, condemning the attempt of the Bishop of Antioch, as
(...). Ibid.
an innovation brought in against the Ecclesiastical laws and the canons of
the holy Fathers; did not only order, that (...)Ibid.
the governors of the Churches which were in Cyprus should keep their own
right entire and inviolable, according to the Canons of the holy Fathers and
their ancient custom: but also (...)and pauIo post. (...). Ibid.
for all other dioceses and provinces wheresoever; that no Bishop should
intrude himself into any other province, which had not formerly and from the
beginning been under him or his predecessors.

The beginning of which kind of subordination of many Bishops unto one chief,
if it were not to be derived from Apostolical right: yet it is by Beza
fetched Neque vero magis existimandum est, hunc externum ordinem fuisse initio
humani generis. Pagi enim ex familiis, and ex pagis urbes, and ex urbibus
civitates ipsae, suadente natura and necessitate flagitante, senfim coierunt;

from the same light of Nature and enforcement of Necessity, whereby men were
at first induced to enter into consociations, subjected one unto another; and

the body of Christ; and by all men must be confessed to be conformable to the
pattern delivered by God unto Moses. For having set apart the three families

(...), the President of the Presidents of the Levites; none, that without
prejudice did take the matter into consideration, would much stick to afford
unto him the name of an Archbishop. at least he would be taught hereby, to
retain that reverend opinion of the primitive Bishops of the Christian Church
(who so willingly submitted themselves, not only to the Archiepiscopall, but
also to a Patriarchicall government) which Calvin professed he did: that in
all this, they were far from having a thought, Reperiemus veteres Episcopos
non aliam regendae Ecclesiae formam voluisse fingere ab ea^ quam Deus verbo suo
praescripsit. Calvin. Institut. lib. 4. cap. 4.. 4.
to devise another form of Church Government, then that which God had
prescribed in his Word.

A GEOGRAPHICALL AND Historical disquifition, touching the Lydian or
Proconsular Asia; and the seven Metropoliticall Churches contained therein.
AS the lesser Asia (now called Natolia or Anatolia) was a part of the great,
and Asia properly so called a part of that lesser; so the Lydian or Proconsular
Asia was a parcel of that Asia which was properly so called. For the fuller
understanding whereof, we are to call to mind, that the Romans having
possessed themselves of the countries which had formerly belonged unto the
Pergamen Kings, reduced them into the form of a province; which they called,
(...). Strabo, Geograph. lib. 13. page 624. (edit. Graecolatin. ann. 1620.)
by the name of the great continent, Asia.

This is by Cicero Namque, ut opinor, Asia vestra constat ex Phrygia, Mysia,
Caria, Lydia. Cicer. orat. pro L. Flacco.
distinguished into four regions: Phrygia, Mysia, Caria, Lydia. although the
southern part of the greater Phrygia was in his time a member of the province
of Cilicia: namely that, which in after ages was known by the name of Phrygia
Pacatiana; as the northern part thereof, by the name of Phrygia Salutaris.

The inland Mysia bordered on the north upon the mountain Olympus, from whence
Herodot. lib. 7. 74. Strab. lib. 12. page 571. 574. 576.
Mysia Olympena took the name; which by the interposition of the river
Rhyndacus was separated from the province that in the division of the Empire
made by Constantine the great was called C. l. 1. de offic. com. sacr. patrim.

Hellespontus Consularis.

The northern part of this Hellespont, named Epictetus, was heretofore called
the lesser or the Hellespontian Phrygia, Strab. lib. 2. page 29. and lib. 12.
page 563. 571.
as Strabo informs us: the southern, called Troas, is by Galen. de sunitat.

Galen named the Hell. spontian Mysia. although Ptolem. Geograph. lib. 5. cap.

Ptolemy does give unto Troas the title of the lesser Phrygia; and to the other
the name of the lesser Mysia. So hard it is to distinguish the bounds of the
Mysians and the Phrygians: as by Strab. lib. 12. page 571. 572.
Strabo also is here observed.

Caria was parted from Lydia by the winding currents of Maeander: from the
receiving of the river Lycus into it, unto the emptying of it self into the
Myrtoan sea. For howsoever Ptolemy takes all that lies betwixt this and the
river Cayster from Lydia, and adds it unto Caria: yet (...). Strab. lib. 12

which did disterminate it from Troas. For here we do not with Ptolemy take
AEolis in the stricter sense for the maritime coast only, which lies by south
of the river Caicus; but also for the land situated northward thereof, unto
which Herodet. lib. 6. 28. and lib. 7 42.
Herodotus gives the name of Mysia, and is by Strabo described to be that
Mysia which is (...). Strab. lib. 12. page 571. Ipsam quoque urbem Pergamenam

Galen indeed writes, that (...). Galen de sanit. tuend. lib. 5.
the Hellespontian Mysia was conterminous to Pergamus. by which Mysia as we
must conceive Troas to have been meant, which lay upon the Hellespont: so upon
the like ground, we may not take Pergamus for the bare city it self, so far
distant from thence, but for the whole Pergamen territory or Mysia Pergamena,
reaching up from Caicus unto Troas. And that all this also was reckoned for a
parcel appendant unto Lydia, may easily be gathered out of Xenophon: (...).
Xenoph. de exped. Cyri, lib. 7.
who counts that a part of the Lydian sea, which runs by Antandrus and
Adramyttium; from whencence he says, he and his company took their journey,

Yea and in Adramyttium it self, (...). Strab. lib. 13 page 613.
Strabe does testify that in his time the name of the Lydian gates was still
preserved, as a memorial of the building of that city by the Lydians. Neither
is there any reason to be given, why Cicero in the catalogue of the countries
of Asia properly so called, should wholly pretermit the mention of AEolis and
Ionia; but that he comprehended the one under the name of AEolis proxima est,
quondam Mysia appellata, and quae Hellesponto adjacet Troas. Plin. lib. 5. cap.
30.
Mysia and the other of Lydia: in both which we see Adramyttium and all the
other cities downward unto Ephesus to be placed by Scylax in his Periplus.

as the Lydians themselves would have it, to the whole land of Asia: alleging
further, that from this Asias, the son of Cotys, the son of Maneus, they
had a tribe in their head-city Sardis, which they called (...),as is recorded
by Herodotus.

Whether (...).Stephan. de Vrbib. in (...).
from this Asias the continent of Asia did take his denomination, or from the
forementioned city of Lydia, or from Asia the wife of Prometheus, or from some
other original; Stephanus Byzantinus leaves us to enquire. But beside that
the first vowell in Homers Asia is long, and in the greater Asia (which
(...).Id. ibid.
Stephanus acknowledges him to have been ignorant of) is of a short quantity:
no man can doubt, but the derivation of the name of Asia from a Lydian city, or
from a Lydian King and Heroes, is far more properly applyable to Lydia it
self, then to the whole continent either of the greater or the lesser Asia.
For that Lydia, comprised within the bounds before described, had in a peculiar
acception the name of Asia ascribed unto it; may further be made clear, both
out of the New Testament, and the distinction made by the Roman Emperors
betwixt the Proconsular Asia (which we will show was the same with this) and
the rest of the Asian Diocese.

In the 16. chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the journey of S. Paul and his
company is by S. Luke thus described. When they had gone throughout Phrygia and
the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the holy Ghost to preach the word
in ASIA; After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but
the Spirit suffered them not. And they passing by Mysia, came down to Troas.
Where it may be observed, that the greater Phrygia, (through which they passed
into Galatia) and Mysia Olympena (which was next adjoining unto Bithynia) and
Hellespont, wherein Troas was situated, being all of them parcells of that Asia
which at first was by the Romans properly so called, and afterward of the
Asian Diocese also; are yet expressly distinguished from Asia, in a more
strict sense so denominated. as Caria likewise, wherein Miletus stood, seems
to be by what we read in Acts 20.16, 17.

And as these are thus exempted by S. Luke, so the rest that remain of the
proper Asia, together with the seven Churches of Asia mentioned in the
Revelation of S. John, are all of them comprehended within the limits of that
Lydian Asia, whereof we have spoken. For, that Pergamus was accounted a city of
Lydia, we have heard before confirmed out of Xenophon: to whom Aristotle also
may be added, in his book (...),where he speaks of a war sometime raised
(...) Sardis, Philadelphia and Thyatira are by Ptolemy, Smyrna and Epheus by
Scylax Caryandensis, and (...).Steph. de Vrbib. in (...).
Laodicea by Stephanus Byzantinus, placed therein.

Yet is Laodicea by Ptolemy referred unto Caria, and by others unto Phrygia.
The reason of which difference we may learn from Strabo: (...).Strab. lib. 13.
page 628.
who shows that the confines of Phrygia, Lydia and Caria were so coincident,
that they were hardly to be discerned the one from the other. which is the
cause, that though he himself Id. lib. 12. page 576. and lib. 14. page 663.
does reckon Laodicea among the cities of Phrygia; yet Hierapolis, which was
(...) Id. lib. 13. page 629.
opposite to it (toward the East) is by Stephanus (...) Stephan. de Vrbib.
said to be seated betwixt Phrygia and Lydia: it by that means being placed
in, and Laodicea without the borders of Phrygia.

This also does Strabo assign for another reason, (...).Strab. lib. 13. page
629.
why the bounds of the Provinces hereabout were confounded: because that the
Romans did not divide these places by the nations; but ordered them after
another manner, according to the circuits wherein they kept their Courts and
exercised judicature. Five of these tribunals were seated in the cities of Plin
lib. 5. cap. 29. and 30.
Laodicea, Sardis, Smyrna, Ephesus, and Pergamus: Philadelphia was subject to
the Sardian, and Thyatira to the Pergamen jurisdiction. Thus was it, when Pliny
wrote, toward the beginning of the empire of Vespasian: although afterward
(...).Ptolem lib. 5. c. 2.
Thyatira was a Metropolis of it self, as Ptolemy declares in his Geography;
and in all likelihood Philadelphia also, the only city remaining of those seven
famous ones singled out, as the seats of the most eminent Churches of all Asia,
in the book of the Revelation.

For that Philadelphia was herein no whit inferior unto Thyatira; may easily
be gathered by the respect which it still retained, after that Lydia (as we
shall hear) was separated from the Proconsular Asia, and each Province
ordinarily permitted to have but one Metropolis. For Sardis being then the
prime city of Lydia; the next in account after it was Philadelphia, another
also being placed betwixt it and Thyatira: as appears by the order of them
constantly observed as well in the Hieroclis Notit, Orientalis Imperii; in
Append. Geograph. sacr. edit. Paris. an. 1641. page 29.

The addition of these two mother-cities seems to have been then made, when
Vespasian added those many new Provinces to the old government, which Sueton.
in Vespasian. cap. 8.
Suetonius speaks off: at what time (as it is most probable) he separated
this Proconsular Asia, from the rest of that Asia which (together with this)
was Strabo, in sin. lib. 17. page 840.
by Augustus Caesar formerly made one entire Consular Province. For the
Proconsul of Asia having but two Provinces under his jurisdiction (before that
of Hellespont was cast upon him by Theodosius the elder) the one in the
continent which he governed by himself, the other in the Islands which he
ruled by a President; it is known, Sub Vespasiano principe Insularum provincia
facta est. Sexr. Rufus, in Breviario.
that the Rhodes and the rest of those Islands were first made a Province by
Vespasian; and from his time downward, long before the distribution of the
Empire made by Constantine, there remains a continued memory of the
Proconsuls of Asia.

For in his sons days, we find Plin. lib. 4. epist. 3. and 5. Vid. Iul.

a Rescript of the Emperor Antoninus; whereby a necessity was imposed upon the
Proconsul, to pass into Asiaby sea, and among the other Metropoles (whereof we
heard there were many) to arrive first at Ephesus.

But after the days of Constantine, the distinction of the offices of the
Vicarius Dioecesis Asianae and the Proconsul Asiae, does more evidently
occur: especially in Eunapius, where he tells, how in his time, Valens
being then Emperor of the East, Clearchus was preferred unto them both. For
first he declares, that he was made (...).Eunap. in vita Maximi.
governor of all that Asia, the jurisdiction whereof did extend from
Hellespont, through Lydia and Pisidia, unto Pamphylia. where, in stead of
Lydia, which at that time (as we will show) did belong unto the Proconsular
Asia, we are to put Phrygia; which appertained to this, and as well in the Act.
2.9, 10. and 16.6.
Acts of the Apostles, as in the Epistle of the Church of Vienna and Lions
(recited by Eusebius) is expressly excluded from that other Asia. (...).Eusebius.
lib. 5. (...).
Then touching the advancement of Clearchus to the other government, Eunapius
writes thus. (...). Id. ibid.
Things prosperously succeeding, Valens was wonderfully well pleased with
Clearchus, and was so far from depriving him of his former charge, that he
advanced him unto a greater government; appointing him to be Proconsul of Asia
now properly so called. This from Pergamus downward taking the seacoast into
it, toward the adjacent continent reaches unto Caria; the mountain Tmolus
circumscribing that of it which belongs unto Lydia. Of the governments it is
the most honorable; and is not subject to the Praefectus Praetorio. saving
that now, by reason of these late commotions, all things are again confounded
and disturbed.

In which words, touching this Proconsular Asia we may observe; first, the name
which he gives unto it, of Asia NOW properly so called. then, the limits
wherewith he circumscribeth it, as it yet stood in the days of the Emperor
Valens. and lastly, the changes which afterward did happen therein. In the
first of which we are to consider, that the Asia now properly so called was but
a parcel of that which in former times the Romans called their proper Asia:
and that as the title of Asia then properly so called was used by them as a
term to distinguish it from Asia minor; so now it had a like relation unto
the Asian diocese, from which (as a member from the whole) by this
specification of the name it was discriminared.

Secondly, touching the limits thereof, it may be noted; that as Galen (in the
place before alleged) makes the Hellespontian Mysia (which in the old
distribution of the Empire was within the precinct of the jurisdiction of the
Vicarius dioecesis Asianae) to be conterminous unto Pergamus, where he himself
was borne: so Eunapius from the same Pergamus, or the Pergamen Mysia rather,
begins the bounds of the Proconsular Asia; extending the length thereof from
thence downward unto Caria, and the breadth from the Sea unto Tmolus,
(...).Strabo, lib. 13. page 629.
a mountain placed in the Eastern border of Lydia. which is by Euripides, in
his Bacchae, called (...) the fortress of Lydia; and on the side whereof
Sardis (a chief city of that province, and Eunapius his own country) is not
only by him, (...).Euripid. in Bacchis.
but also by Herodot. lib. 1. 84. and lib. 5.. 101.

Strabo and Lydia celebratur maxim Sardibus, in latere Tmoli montis, qui ante
Timolus appellabatur. Plin. lib. 5. c. 29.
Pliny (howsoever Ptolemy misplaceth it) sufficiently proved to have been
situated. By which description it appears, that the Proconsular Asia was the
same with the old Lydian Asia; within the compass whereof all those seven
Churches were comprehended, which are mentioned in the book of the Revelation.

Thirdly, for the changes which followed afterward; we find that by Theodosius
the elder (who succeeded Valens in the Eastern Empire) the L. Offic.
Hestesponti. C. de offic. commit. sacri potrimon. (vel pouus, proconsalis and
leg.)
Consular Hellespont (wherein that Hellespontian Mysia was contained, which
bordered upon Pergamena) was taken from the jurisdiction of the Vicarius of the
Asian diocese, and put under the power of the Proconsul of Asia: and either by
him or his son Arcadius, the inland province of Lydia on the other side taken
from the Proconsul of Asia, and subjected to the Vicarius of the Asian
diocese. Which is the cause, why Palladius, Palladius, in Vita Chrysostomi:
and ex eo Georgius Alexandrinus, tomo 8. edit. Graec. oper. Chrysostom. page 202.
(...).
speaking of the Asian Synod of seventy Bishops held by Chrysostom in the four
hundredth year of our Lord, does expressly distinguish the Bishops of Lydia
from the Bishops of Asia. for as for the subscriptions of the first Council of
Nice, which are to be found in some Latin copies: they are of latter times, and
deserve little or no regard.

Yet in this distraction of Lydia from the Proconsular Asia, it is to be
observed, that the Southern part thereof, lying betwixt the rivers of Maeander
and Cayster, which we noted to have been attributed by Ptolemy unto Caria, and
wherein were the cities of Priene, Magnesia, Trallis and Nysa, was still
reserved unto Asia; together with all that lay upon the seacoast from Ephesus
up unto Assos (mentioned in Acts 20.13.) as does appear as well Append.

to the state of his own time, when speaking of the care which Chrysostom had

of the whole diocese of Asia, he says that it was governed by eleven
Presidents. counting the three Provinces which were under the Proconsul of
Asia, with the other eighth that were under the Vicarius of the Asian diocese;
which otherwise, if Lycia and Lycaonia had been conjoined, would have been but
seven Provinces.

in the general enumeration of the Provinces of the Eastern Empire, which we
meet withal toward the beginning of the foresaid Theodosian Breviary, there
are but ten Provinces numbered of the whole Asian diocese: the first and
principal of them all, to wit Asia it self, by some error (wherewith Onuph
Panuin. Reipubl. Roman. lib. 3. (page 424. edit. Francofurt. ann. 1597.)
Onuphrius also was misledd) being omitted. Which was nothing amended by
Isidorus Mercator, but increased rather; when he reckons up Asiae Provinciae

twelve Provinces in this Asia: the first where of is Asia it self (says he)
in which is Ilium, or Troy; the second Lydia, the third Galatia. Whereas Ilium
was situated not in this, but in the province of Hellespont: and Galatia
appertained to the Pontican, and not to the Asian Diocese. Whence, by the way,
we may correct an error that has crept into the Greek edition of the
subscriptions of the 6. Action of the Council of Chalcedon: wherein, though
Theosebius Bishop of Ilium had put to his name, yet Stephen the Metropolitan of
the Ephesians, among those absent Bishops that were under his jurisdiction,
does nominate Rufinus Bishop, not Timi (as the Latin books have it) but Ilij.

And here it is further to be observed, that howsoever in former times the
Proconsular Asia had diverse metropoliticall cities in it (as, by that which
has been already said, and specially by the Rescript of the Emperor
Antoninus, vouched by Vlpian, is manifestly proved:) yet in the disposition of
the Empire made by Constantine it was ordered, that as well there, as in all
other provinces respectively, there should be but one chief city held for the
Metropolis; wherein the Roman Deputy was to make his principal residence, and
to which the provincialls might have recourse for the administration of public
justice.

Now Ephesus, being held to be (...).Aristid. orat. de concordia, ad civitates
Asiaticas.
the common treasury of Asia (as Aristides calls it) was appointed to be the
Metropolis thereof: as may appear by the testimonies, as well of

Theodosius, in the letters whereby he summoneth Dioscorus and other Bishops to

Lord CCCCXLIX. And he that wrote the book of the places mentioned in the Acts
of the Apostles (falsely fathered upon S. Hierom) saying, that Specialiter ubi
Ephesus civit as est, Asia vocatur. Lib. de locis Act. Apostol. inter Hieronymi
and Bedae opera.
where the city of Ephesus is, there is the Asia specially so called; could
mean no other thing thereby, but that the province which has Ephesus for it is
Metropolis, is that which has the name of Asia in a singular manner
appropriated unto it. if therein he looked any further then to the bare words
of the text; wherein it is said, that Paul Act. 19.10.
continuing at Ephesus by the space of two years, all they which dwelt in Asia
heard the word of the Lord. and that afterward Act. 20.16, 18.
he determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in
Asia: and thereupon sending for the Elders of the Church of Ephesus, he said
unto them; Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner
I have been with you at all seasons. Out of all which it was no hard matter for
him to gather at large, as Erasm Annot. in Act. 16 and Romans 16.
Erasmus did after him; that Asia in the New Testament denotes that part of
Asia minor in which Ephesus stands.

It is here also further to be noted, that as in the state of the civil
government, the jurisdiction of the annual Presidents (by Aristides styled
(...).Aristid. in orat. citat. quum antea dixisset. (...).
Bishops) was extended unto all the cities that were contained within the
limits of their several provinces so, in the Eastern empire especially, the
Ecclesiastical regiment was herein conformed unto the civil; there being but
one Metropolitan Bishop settled in every Province, unto whom the Bishops of all
the rest of the cities were subordinated. By which means it came to pass,
that of the seven Churches in Asia, spoken of in the book of the Revelation,
Ephesus alone in the days of Constantine had the Metropoliticall dignity lest
unto it. Then after the days of Valens the Emperor, Lydia being separated
from Asia, the Bishop of Sardis (which had been the (...).Strabo, lib. 13. page
625.
ancient seat of the Lydian Kings) became the Metropolitan of that province:

Pacatiana: whereas it was without all controverfy the Metropolis of Phrygia
Salutaris. See the subscript. of the V. general Council, Collat. 8.
Thyatira being made subject to him; as Smyrna and Pergamus were to the Bishop
of Ephesus.

There remained then of the seven, only Laedicea: which got the honor of being
the Metropolis of Phrygia Pacatiana; as we read in the Greek subscription of
the first epistle unto Timothy: the latenesse whereof is thence rightly
collected by the learned Vnde satis liquere potest, de subscriptione primae
epistolae ad Timotheum, recentiorem eam esse. Cujac. in exposit. Novell. 145.
Cujacius. For as the distinction of Phrygia Pacatiana and Salutaris is no
where to be found before the distribution of the provinces made by Constantine:
so at that time also, when but one Metropolis was allotted unto every Province;
it is a question, whether of those two Laodicea and Hierapolis as they: were
near one another (and so conjoined by the Apostle, in Coloss. 4.13.) so have
they the first place also assigned unto them among the cities of Phrygia
Pacariana, by Hierocles in the civil list of the Provinces; Append. Geogr.

controversy was acknowledged to belong unto Phrygia, was not rather chosen to

appertain unto Phrygia, Garia and Lydia.

in the lists of the Bishoprics of the East made in the succeeding times,
there are still distinct suffragans reckoned under these two Metropolitans of
Laodicea and Hierapolis; and that diverse other private Bishops were not hereby
restrained from aspiring unto a Metropoliticall dignity. among whom (to speak
only of those who are within our compass) was the Bishop of Smyrna; who found
the means to be made first Notir. Graec. in Append. Geograph, sacr. page 8. and

Bishop of Sardis, and made Metropolitan of all Lydia. So as of the Bishops of
the seven Churches mentioned in the book of the Revelation, he of Thyatira only
excepted, all at the last became Metropolitans, as they were at the first.

But among all these, the Sea of Ephesus had evermore the preeminence. And as
it was the mother city of the Proconsular Asia: so was that Asia likewise the
prime Province of all the Asian Diocese; and had in such esteem, that the
Proconsul thereof was exempted from the jurisdiction of the Praefectus
Praetorio Orientis, (as before we have heard out of Eunapius) unto which the
Vicarius or Lieutenant of the rest of the Asian diocese was subject.
Gonformably whereunto in the Ecclesiastical government, the Bishop of Ephesus
was not only held to be the Metropolitan of the Proconsular Asia, but also the
Primate of all the provinces that were contained within the compass of the
whole Asian Diocese. Upon which ground it was, that among those Bishops which
Palladius (in the life of Chrysostom) mentions to have been ordained by
Antoninus Bishop of Ephesus; (...).Sozomen. hist. lib. 8. cap. 6.
some were of Lycia and Phrygia, as well as others of Asia: the ordination of
these latter being challenged by virtue of his Metropoliticall, of the others
by his Patriarchicall jurisdiction. Which Patriarchicall right of ordination
being taken afterward from that See by the Council of Chalcedon, was by
(...),Euagr. Instor. lib. 3. cap. 6.
Timothy of Alexandria (the deadly enemy of that Council) restored again.

also (whereof it was a member) thus much may suffice.

THE PATRIARCHICALL Government of the ancient Church; declared by way of
Answer unto four Questions, proposed unto EDWARD BREREWOOD.
The first Question. Whether every Church or Bishop, at the time of the Nicene
Council, were subject to one of the three Patriarchs, of Rome, of Alexandria,
and of Antiochia, mentioned in the 6. Canon of that Council?
Answer.
NO. They were not. the Canon it self puts it out of question. For when as the
former part of that Canon had reserved to those three, the accustomed
prerogative and power over their neighbor Regions; there is immediately added,
that the dignities or privileges, belonging to the Churches of other
Provinces, should in like sort be maintained. And the second Canon also of the
first General Council of Constantinople will enforce as much. But for the
better declaring of this point, two things would be considered. First; what the
Extent or Bounds of those three Patriarchs jurisdiction was? Secondly; to whose
jurisdiction the rest of the Provinces belonged, without those precincts?

Touching the first. Council. Nicen. can. 6.

Epiphanius adds Thebais, Maraeotica, and Ammoniaca, and yet he adds
nothing: for Thebais and Maraeotica were provinces of Egypt, and Ammoniaca was
part of Lybia. The utmost cities of which Patriarchs jurisdiction were, toward
the East Rhinocorura not far from Anthedon and Gaza) where he confined with
the jurisdiction of Antiochia: and toward the West Berenice, near the greater
Syrtis. that was (I say) the utmost city of his jurisdiction that way: but the
utmost bound of it was at the town of Phileni, in the bottom of the greater
Syrtis; where the jurisdiction of Egypt confined with that of Afrique. Within
which large bounds, at the time of the Nicene Council, were Notitia Provinciar.
six Provinces of the Roman division: but afterward in the time of the Action.

Council of Chalcedon, it seems there were ten (the greater Provinces being
then divided into less) for so many Metropolitan Bishops do the Emperors
Theodosius and Valentinian call to that Council out of the Diocese of Egypt.

To the Patriarch of Antiochia belonged all Council. Constantinop. 1. can. 2.

(not for the Eastern Empire, whereof Constantinople was the Metropolis, but)
for the East Diocese of the Empire, whereof Antiochia was, contains all the
Provinces of the Roman Empire lying at the East end of the Mediterrane Sea, as
far as their Empire extended Eastward; together with Cilicia and Isauria;
confining with the former, but yet being on the North side of the midland Sea:
all together being in number Notitia Provinc. prope princip.
15. Provinces.

Now lastly touching the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Rome: although I will
not take on me resolutely to determine the precincts of it, yet I will tell
you my opinion. Which is, that it contained all those Provinces of the Diocese
of Italy, which the old Lawyers and others term Suburbicarias. There were ten
of them: whereof three were the three Islands, Sicilie; Corsica, and Sardinia;
and the other seven were in the firm land of Italy, and took up in a manner
all the narrow part of it. for all Italy East ward belonged to it: but on the
West the river Magra (which was and still is the limit of Tuscany) toward the
Tyrrhene Sea, and the River Esino ( Asius it was called) not far to the West
of the city Ancona toward the Adriatique Sea, were the bounds of it. for at
that River Esino, if I be not mistaken, the Province of Picenum Suburbicarium
confined with that, which was termed Picenum Annonariu^: whereof the former
belonged to the Praefecture of Rome, whereof the city of Rome was Metropolis;
and the later, together with all the other provinces in the broader part of
Italy, (there were seven of them in all) pertained to the Diocese of Italy,
properly so termed, whereof the Metropolis was the city of Milan.

And that this, and no other, was the ancient jurisdiction of the Roman
Patriarch; I am not without reason to persuade me. for first, Ruffin. hist.
Eccles. lib. 1. cap. 6.
Ruffinus in his Ecclesiastical history registring the Canon of the Nicene
Council above alleged; sets it down thus. Apud Alexandriam, ut in Vrbe
Roma, vetusta consuetudo servetur: ut ille Aegypti, and hic Suburbicariarum
Ecclesiarum solicitudinem gerat. whose translation (if he meant but to
translate the Canon out of the Greek) as I will not approve; so his
declaration, if he meant that, I cannot reprove: because living so shortly, as
he did, after the Nicene Council, and being of Italy, as he was; he might
well know the bounds of that Patriarch's jurisdiction, as it was then practiced.

Secondly, so many Provinces, and no more, belonged to the Prefecture of the
city of Rome, that was, to the civil Jurisdiction of him that was Vicarius
Vrbis; Notitia Provinciar. Imper. Occidental.
as in the book of Provinces is manifest. And of all the other Ecclesiastical
jurisdictions, whether of Patriarchs or Primates, it is certain that they
extended no farther, then the Temporal Regiment of the Lievtenants did; that
is, to the bounds of those Dioceses whereof the cities of their Residence were
the Metropoles: Council. Constantinop. 1. can, 2.
which also the second Canon of the second general Council before mentioned
does clearly import.

But I shall not thus satisfy you perhaps, except the second point also be
declared: namely, to whose Government, the Churches of all other Provinces did
belong. Touching which I will tell you briefly, what, searching the best I
could into the ancient Ordination and government, both Civil and
Ecclesiastical, of the Empire of Rome, I have observed. The whole Empire of
Rome was divided into XIII. Dioceses: whereof VII. belonged to the East Empire
and VI. (beside the Prefecture of the city of Rome, before mentioned) to the
West. Those XIII. Dioceses (together with that Prefecture) contained among them
CXX. Provinces, or thereabout: so that to eevery Diocese belonged the
administration of sundry Provinces. Lastly every Province contained many
Cities, within their territories.

The Cities had for their Rulers, those inferior Judges which in the Law are
termed Defensores civitatum: and their seats were the cities themselves; to
which all the Towns and Villages in their several territories were to resort
for justice. The Provinces had for theirs either Proconsules or Consulares, or
Praesides or Correctores; four sundry appellations, but almost all of equal
authority: and their seats were the chiefest cities or Metropoles of the
Provinces; of which in every Province there was one, to which all the inferior
cities, for judgment in matters of importance, did resort. Lastly the Dioceses
had for theirs, the Lievtenants, called Vicarij: and their seats, were the
Metropoles or principal cities of the Diocese, whence the edicts of the
Emperor or other Laws were published and sent abroad into all the Provinces
of the Diocese; and where the Praetorium and chief Tribunal for judgment was
placed, to determine the Appeals, and minister justice (as might be occasion)
to all the Provinces belonging to that jurisdiction. And this was the
disposition of the Roman Governors: for to speak of the several properties
of these subordinate Rulers government, were tedious and for our purpose
needless.

And truly it is wonderful, how nearly and exactly the Church in her
Government did imitate this civil Ordination of the Roman Magistrates. For
first, in every city, as there was a Defensor civitatis, for secular
government, so was there placed a Bishop for spiritual regiment (in every city
of the East and in every city of the West almost, a several Bishop) whose
jurisdiction extended but to the city, and the places within the Territory of
it. for which cause, the jurisdiction of a Bishop was anciently known by no
other name but (...),signifying not (as many ignorant Novelists think) a
parish, as now the word is taken, that is the places or habitations near a
Church, but the Towns and Villages near a city; all which, together with the
City, the Bishop had in charge. Secondly, in every Province, as there was a
President, so was there an Archbishop: and because his Seat was the principal
City of the Province, he was commonly known by the name of Metropolitan.
Lastly, in every Diocese, as there was a Lievetenant-Generall, so was there a
Primate, seated also in the principal city of the Diocese, as the Lieutenant
was: to whom the last determining of Appeals from all the Provinces in
differences of the Clergy, and the sovereign care of all the Diocese, for
sundry points of spiritual government did belong.

So that by this discourse it appears, that 1. a Bishop, in the ancient
acception, was the chief spiritual governor of a City. 2. A Metropolitan,
chief of a Province. 3. a Primate chief of a whole Diocese. which was
anciently a far greater matter then a Province, as containing the joint
administration of many Provinces: although now it import a far less
jurisdiction, even that Precinct which anciently (...) did. Now of what Cities
these Primates of the Dioceses were Bishops, and what Provinces belonged to the
jurisdiction of every one, I could set down: but I should be long, which I am
loath to be; loving a great deal better sparingnesse then prolixity of
discourse, and specially at this present when I have no leisure to spare. But
by this that I have already said, of the number of the Dioceses, you may see;
that there were XI. Primates besides the III. Patriarchs. for of the XIII.
Dioceses (besides the Praefecture of the city of Rome; which as before I said,
was administered by the Patriarch of Rome) that of Egypt, was governed by the
Patriarch of Alexandria, and that of the Orient by the Patriarch of Antiochia,
and all the rest by the Primates. Yet I must confess that in Africa (as it is
to be seen in sundry of the African Counsels) the name of Primates and
Metropolitans was promiscuously used for the superintendents of single
Provinces; although the just power and dignity of Primate belonged but to one
among them all.

Now touching the power and jurisdiction of these Primates, although it was no
less then that of the Patriarchs, the office being the same (as you may see in
Anacletus his epistles, Anaclet. epistol. ad Episcop. Ital. Gratian. Did. 99.
and in Gratian) and the name also of Patriarchs of the Dioceses being commonly
given unto them by Justinian: yet the honor was somewhat less. the Patriarchs
ever having precedence and priority of place in Counsels, and that in a
certain order; first Rome, then Alexandria, and then Antiochia. But if you
should ask me the reason, why all these sovereign Bishops being equal in
power, only three of them (till the ambition of the Bishops of Constantinople
and Jerusalem had obtained that title) had the name of Patriarchs: Gelas. in
Council. 1. Romano. Gregor. lib. 6. Ep. 37. ad Eulog.
I can yield no better (although I know some Bishops of Rome have pretended
other) then either because from these three cities above all others, the
Christian Religion was dispersed abroad among many nations; in acknowledgement
whereof, Christians reverenced them as mother-Churches above all the rest: or
else for the great dignity of the cities themselves, exceeding all other of the
Roman Empire. For first, of Rome (the Lady of the world) there is no question,
Dio Chrysostom. in orat. 32. ad Alexandrinos. Aristid. in orat. de Romae laudib.
but she surpassed all the rest: and of Alexandria, Dion Chrysostomus and
Aristides have recorded it to be the second; as Josephus also has registered
Antiochia for the third city of all the Empire.

And as for the Unity of the Church; the preservation whereof you suppose might
be the final cause of reducing all Christian countries under the Regiment of
those three Patriarchs: it was otherwise singularly provided for. partly by the
excellent subordination before touched, of inferior Clerks to Bishops in every
City, of Bishops to Metropolitans in every Province, and of Metropolitans to
Patriarchs or Primates in every Diocese: and partly, if the wounds and rents of
the Church by heresy or schism were grown more wide and dangerous, by the
congregation of Councels; either Provincial by the Metropolitan, or
Patriarchall by the Patriarch or Primate, or General, by the Emperor,
according to the several necessities of the Church.

The second Question. To what Patriarch was the Church and Bishop of Carthage
subject? To Alexandria, or Rome?
Answer.
TO neither of both. But he himself was Primate, and consequently had
Patriarchicall jurisdiction in all the provinces (there were VI. of them) of
the Diocese of Afrique. for of the XIII. Dioceses of the Empire before
mentioned, that of Afrique was one. So that all the Region of Afrique,
excepting the most Aesterly part of it, called Mauritania Tingitana (for that
Province belonged to the jurisdiction or Diocese of Spain; as it is in Notitia
Provinciarum) and the Easterly part, beyond the greater Syrtis (for that
belonged to the jurisdiction of Egypt) all the rest of Afrique (I say) was
subject to Carthage, as their chief Primate. Chief Primate I must term him,
speaking now of Afrique; because (as before I observed) the Africans usually
called all their Metropolitans, Primates; contrary to the custom of the rest
of Christendom. But yet, as I said, the principal power of Primate in
Afrique, belonged to the Archbishop of Carthage alone. Novell. 131. cap. 1.
For Justinian does plainly give him the same jurisdiction and prerogative in
the Diocese of Afrique, that he did to the Bishop of Iustiniana prima, in the
Diocese of Dacia; that is to say (as you shall understand by mine answer to
your last Question) of an absolute Primate. Which assignement or donation of
Justinians notwithstanding, you must not conceive to be the first erecting of
it to that dignity, but the restoring of it, when as by the service of
Belisarius he had recovered it with Afrique out of the Vandales hands (who had
held the dominion and possession of it many years) to the state of Primacy,
wherein it had been before they surprised it. Stephan. de Vrbib. in (...).Leo.
9. Epist. 4. Salvian. lib. 7. de gubernatione Dei.
Stephanus Byzantius also, I remember, calls it the Metropolis of Afrique;
and Leo the IX. a Pope, acknowledges it to have been the Metropolis of all
Afrique: and that which Salvianus writes of it in the 7. book, imports no
less. But above all, the erecting of it by Justinian into a Praetorian
Praefecture, does most evidently assure it; assigning it not a Lieutenant,
Vicarium (as it had before it came into the Vandales hands; when it was under
the jurisdiction of the Praefectus Praetorij Italiae) but (as I said) a
Praefectus Praetorio, Cod. lib. 1. tit. 27. de offic. Prefect. Praetor.
Africx, leg. 1.
as it is in the Code; and annexing to his jurisdiction two Provinces more then
anciently pertained to it. For even the principal Cities of Dioceses wherein
the Vicarij kept residence, were cities of Primacies: much rather therefore
those that were the seats of the Praefecti Praetorio; whose places the Vicarij
did but supply.

Now for your first doubt of Lybia in the Nicene Canon attributed to the
Patriarch of Alexandia; you must understand, that it is there taken properly
for that region of Afrique which retained peculiarly the name of Lybia: of
which you may read in S. Hierome, in his Questions on Genesis, where he
entreats of the progeny of Noah's sons. The situation of it, Prosem. lib. 4.
Geograph. in initio; and in tab. 3 Africae. Procop lib. 6 Aedificior.
you may find in Ptolemy; to be that region of Afrique that lies next to
Egypt: and for the amplitude, Procopius may direct you, that it anciently
contained all that was betwixt Egypt and Cyrenaica. Yet true it is, that the
name of Lybia in a general acception contained all the regions of Afrique: and
the very like was the fortune of the name Africa it self; which properly
signifying the region about Carthage, yet became common to all the Countries
from Spain to Egypt. And may we not observe the same in the names of the other
grand Regions of the Continent, Asia and Europe? for Europa properly was but
one of the Provinces of Thrace, whereof Heraclea was the Metropolis: and Asia
properly taken but one of the Provinces of Anatolia, whereof the Metropolis was
Ephesus. And that the name of Lybia in the Nicene Canon is to be taken in this
peculiar sense; the Canon it self will enforce: not only because it is ordered
in the Canon in such sort, as indeed the Countries lie, betwixt Egypt and
Pentapolis (Pentapolis is the same that is otherwise termed Cyrenaica:) but
much more effectually (for the former reason perhaps is but light) because it
had been vain to have added Pentapolis after Lybia, if they had meant by Lybia
all the great Region of Afrique; whereof Pentapolis was but a small part.

As for the point of Appeals: Diocese were regularly to be made to the
Patriarch of that Diocese, and that from the sentence of the Patriarch was no
appeal; as it is evident by the Constitutions of Justinian, Novell. 123. cap.
22. Cod. lib. 1. Tit. 4. leg. 29.
both in the Novells and in the Code, in the title de Episcopali Audientia, L.
Sancimus. But you must understand, that those whom Justinian calls the
Patriarchs of the Diocese; were not only the five Patriarchs (for in
Justinians time there were so many) commonly termed by that Name, but (as I
before noted) the Primates of the Dioceses, who had Patriarchichall
jurisdiction. For Justinian, in the place of the Code now alleged,
acknowledges the order of appealing there set down, from the Bishop to the
Metropolitan, and from him to the Patriarch of the Diocese, to have been an
old decree. And that very decree we find in the Council of Chalcedon: Council.
Chalced. Act. 15. can. 9. Bellar. l. 2. de Pontif. Romans cap. 22.
but not under the name of Patriarch of the Diocese, but of Primate ((...)) of
the Diocese. for as for Bellarmin's interpreting the Bishop of Rome to be the
Exarch of the Diocese in that Canon mentioned; although he follow Nicol, I. in
epist. ad Michael. Imp.
a Pope therein, it is (by his leave) but an unskilful shift, and bewrays in
him some ignorance of the ancient Ordination and government of the Church.

And with these Constitutions of the Empire, and of the Church, those decrees
of the Councels of Melevis, and of Afrique, which you allege, Council. M
levit. can. 22. Council. African. cap. 105.
do perfectly agree. for by them are forbidden (if you mark them well) not
only Trans-marine Appeals, meaning those to Rome (although in the Milevitan
Canon there be a special clause to exclude them, because the Bishop of Rome
had specially claimed that privilege) but all foreign Appeals, any whether
out of Afrique: so that by these Canons, the Bishop of Alexandria was no less
excluded, then the Bishop of Rome. For that by Afrique, in those Counsels, is
understood the jurisdiction or Diocese of Afrique, containing the six
Provinces, Tripolitana, Byzacena, Zeugitana or Proconsularis (which was that,
where Carthage stood) Numidia, Mauritania Caesareensis and Mauritania
Sitiphensis, I make no question: and that of these Provinces the Councels of
Afrique did consist, may in the book of Counsels be easily observed. Or if
that were not clear enough but yet the second Canon of the first general
Council of Constantinople would put all out of question: where it is precisely
decreed, that the Bishop of Alexandria should intermeddle only with the
affairs of the Diocese of Egypt; which was altogether another Diocese from
that of Afrique, confining only with it (as I before noted) at the bottom of
the greater Syrtis.

So may also the other reasons, Rome in respect of Afrique, be well satisfied.
For first to the proposition of Augustine (in Epist. 162.) that Caecilianus
might have reserved his cause to the Transmarine Bishops, it is (I take it) to
be understood, that he might so do, not by way of ordinary Appeal, but of
extraordinary complaint; and that not to any one Bishop alone (as him of Rome)
but to the Counsels of Bishops. for Augustine says plainly in the same
Epistle, that there were thousands of those Colleagues, where the differences
might have been determined. So that Augustines meaning is not, that any of
those Trans. marine Bishops could directly by way of injunction, as superior,
command the ordering of the controversy betwixt Caecilianus and Donatus a Casis
nigris, but only by way of Communion with the one allow of him, and by
Excommunicating the other (if he would not yield to the judgment and
determination of the Church) condemn him, whereby the Churches of Afrique
might have known whom to accept and whom to reject. In this sort I say might
Caecilianus have reserved his cause to the Trans-marine Bishops: neither could
be justly restrained from seeking such remedy, both because himself, that was
in question, was the chief Primate of Afrique (for he was Bishop of Carthage)
and specially because the Canons of Milevis and Africa, which should have
restrained him, were not then in force; nor yet the Councels, wherein they were
decreed, called within an hundred years after.

And as for the other place, Augustine says not absolutely, that the partakers
of Donatus should have convicted Caecilianus before his Trans-marine
Colleagues, but respectively, that they should so have done before they had
complained to the Emperor: namely because that proceeding had been more
charitable, and orderly (that Bishops of the Church should determine the
controversies of the Church) and less scandalous. And yet further, if he had
said absolutely that they should have convicted him before the Trans-marine
Bishops: I should understand it spoken, not in respect of any due jurisdiction
over Afrique, belonging to any Bishop beyond the Seas, but in respect of the
present case and necessity of the Church of Afrique; because the Bishops of
Africa being in a horrible schism about that controversy, it was impossible in
any good sort to be determined among them.

Now for Leo his decree touching Lupicinus: Africans excommunicating of him,
notwithstanding his appeal to Rome, seems likewise to prove that they
acknowledged it not. But this matter of Appeals, was but an extraordinary
prerogative: for which Leo might have either a just title, or at least a fair
pretense; because the receiving and determining of Appeals was in the great
Council of Sardica (Can. 3.) granted to the Bishop of Rome. But for his
practicing of ordinary jurisdiction in Afrique (and uncalled) which as
appears by the alleged Epistle Leo then began to do: (whereas his
predecessors had received the repulse about the challenge of Appeals in
Afrique, within the remembrance of them which were then no very old men:) for
that, I say, I see no reason why Leo should do it; but yet, seeing he would
do it, I see some reason why he should do it then. For the year before Leo
came to the Papacy, Carthage was taken, and Africa conquered by Gensericus King
of the Vandales, and all the Catholic Bishops either banished out of Afrique,
or living (if they staid) under heavy persecution; and by reason of the strait
edict of Gensericus not any new Bishops suffered in place of the former to be
ordained: although, contrary to the edict, some were ordained secretly. This
was a fit time, I say, for Leo not only to renew the old claim about Appeals,
but to practice a new jurisdiction: when Africa was utterly distressed and the
Bishops almost all destroyed by persecution; and the minds of those that were
anew ordained (simple ones it seems they were by that Epistle of Leo) humbled
with adversity. A fit time it was (I say) for his purpose; and a good occasion
and advantage he took to raise himself amidst these miserable ruins of the
Church of Afrique.

The third Question. To what Patriarch Britain belonged? to Rome, or what
other?
Answer.
BRITAIN was subject neither to the Patriarch of Rome (which your Reasons
touching the observing of Easter and rejecting of Augustine sent by Gregory
might well prove) nor to any other foreign jurisdiction of the Church: but
being of it self (as it was) Notitia Provinc Occident.
one of the VI. Diocesses of the West Empire, had a Primate of its own; which
(as I take) was the Archbishop of York. For three Metropolitans there were in
Britain (as there were then but three Provinces) in the time of Constantine
the great and of the Nicene Council. One of Maxima Caesariensis, the Bishop of
York; another of Britannia prima, the Bishop of London; the third of Britannia
secunda, Antiq. Britan. page 11.
the Bishop of (Isca) Caeruske in Monmouth-shire: which till King Arthurs time
continued there, and was then translated to S. David's, where it remained also
in the form of an Archbishopric (having the Bishops of Wales for his
suffragans) till King Henry the first his time; by whom it was brought under
the obedience of Canterbury.

And although Britain were after divided into five Provinces, Notitia
Provinciar. Occident. fol. 117.
Valentia and Flavia Caesariensis being added to the former; yet these being
erected and taken out of the others after the time of the Nicene Council, the
ancient Metropolitan Churches by the decree of that Council retained their
ancient prerogatives: which they should have lost, Canon 6.
if any of their Suffragans had become Metropolitans, and so had been
withdrawn from their jurisdiction.

The Archbishop of York, I say, was Primate of Britain, while the Romans
held the government, and after while the Britains held the possession of
England. For although London was anciently a city of great trade (as Tacitus
records of it) yet wanted it the prerogatives that York then had. Tacitus l.
14. Annal.
For first, York was the principal Colony of the Romans in Britain.
Secondly, the Emperors Palace was there. there died Septimius Severus: and
thence his sons, Bassianus and Geta, departed as Emperors, there died
Constantius Chlorus the Emperor: and there was his son Constantine the Great
first proclaimed Emperor, there was also the Praetorium of the Diocese of
Britain; and the Lieutenant there kept residence: therefore it was the
Metropolis of the whole Diocese of Britain (and not only of one Province, as
London was) and consequently it was the Primats seat. For so it was usual in
all other Diocesses of the Empire: namely, that where the Praetorium was, and
the Lieutenant (Vicarius) held his residence for administration of justice to
the Provinces, there the Primate of the Diocese was seated also. And therefore
Spartianus in the life of Severus, calls it the City (...). Veniens (says
he) in Civitatem (speaking of York) primum ad Bellonae Templum (that Temple
stood where now St Peter's Church does) ductus est. And therefore it was not
without cause, Gregor. l. 12. Epist. 15. ad Augustinum.
that Gregory, at the first conversion of the English, was so careful to erect
an Archbishopric as well at York as at London (although it never came to
London, but was established at Canterbury) and that with such equal terms of
honor; that the Archbishops should have precedence each before other,
according to the antiquity of their Ordination.

The fourth Question. In what Patriarchate Justiniana prima was?
Answer.
IN none: but had it self the Primacie of the Diocese of Dacia. For that
Diocese being erected long after all the rest by Justinian, (as the place
wherein himself was borne) and by him named Iustiniana prima (Acridus it was
before called, Procop. lib. 4. Aedific. Just.
as Nicephorus says; being in Dardania, as Procopius has registered) was made
the head thereof: and both a Praefectus Praetorii there established for civil
government, and an Episcopal Primacy for Ecclesiastical. And for
jurisdiction, Dacia Mediterranea, Dacia Ripensis, Mysiasecunda, Dardania,
Praevalitana, and part both of Macedonia secunda, and Pannonia secunda; that
is, all the Diocese of Dacia was assigned to it. Which yet, by the way, (least
the mention of Dacia breed some error) must not be understood of the ancient
Dacia, on the north side of Danubius (which contained Transsylvania, Wallachia
and Moldavia, as now they are called) but of the new Dacia on the south side of
Danubius, and betwixt the said river and the mountain Haemus. For the Emperor
Aurelianus translating the Inhabitants of the old Dacia (being sore afflicted
and overcharged by the wars of the barbarous nations) to the other side of
Danubius, placed them betwixt the two provinces of Moesia, Europ. lib. 9.
Suidas in (...).
taking up part of either, and some part of Dardania; and, of the inhabitants,
gave it the name of Dacia: as Vopiscus, Eutropius, Suidas, and others, have
left recorded.

Of this Dacia, I say, and other provinces of the same Dioces, was the Arch
bishop of Iustiniana made Primate by Justinian: and that with the highest
prerogatives and honors that could be given. For he was to be ordained by his
own Metropolitans, and they, and the other Bishops of those provinces were not
to acknowledge, or appeal to any other; but he was To be not only Metropolitan
but Archbishop. Where by the way you may note, that in these ancient times the
name of Archbishop was given only to Patriarchs and Primates: which in after
times Metropolitans also took on them. But of late many invaded the title, that
were not so much us Metropolitans; and had (...) one suffragan Bishop under
their jurisdiction.
to have Omnem censuram Ecclesiasticam, summum Sacerdotium, summum fastigium,
primam dignitatem. If you read the Constitution (Novel. XI.) it will satisfy
you. And to that in another Law (Novel. CXXXI. c. 3.) is added, that he was in
all those Provinces to have the place (Locum he says, not Vicem; least there
should be any ambiguity) of the Apostolical Sea. In so much that Nicephorus,
speaking of the erection of that City and Church by Justinian, says of it,
that Justinian made it Ecclesiam liberam, and quae sibi Caput esset, cum plena
potestate, etc. And this same height of prerogative and honor that Justinian
gave to the Bishop of Iustiniana prima, he gives also to the Bishop of
Carthage: as is manifest in the fourth Chapter of the last mentioned (CXXXI.)
Novell. And therefore in very truth, neither of them both (if the Emperor
might endow them with these privileges) was subject to the jurisdiction of the
Patriarch of Rome.

Wherefore (to confess freely my ignorance) I see no reason, why the Bishop of
Thebes should appeal from the Bishop of Iustiniana prima to the Bishop of
Rome. First, because of the prerogative of that seat, exempted from all
foreign jurisdiction. Secondly, because the Bishop of Iustiniana sentenced not
the matter by virtue of ordinary jurisdiction (for so he belonged to the
Archbishop of Thessalonica Primate of all Greece, wherein Thebes stood) but by
special Gregor. l. 2. Epistol. Indict. 11. Epist. 6.
delegation from the Emperor. Thirdly, because if notwithstanding all this he
might appeal; he should, both by Ecclesiastical Canon and Imperial
Constitution, have made it to the Patriarch of Gonstantinople. For in the Canon
before mentioned of the Chalcedon Council, Council. Chalced. Can. 9.
all manner of Clerks are directly enjoined to make their last Appeals either
to the Primate of the Diocese where the controversy should hap to fall, or
else to the Bishop of Constantinople. And besides,the Emperors Honorius and
Thendosius made a special Law (as it is in the Code, in the Title de
Sacrosanctis Ecclesiis. L. Cod. lib 1. Tit. 2. leg. 6.
Omni.) that all the controversies and Appeals of the provinces of Illyricum
(of which the Diocese of Dacia long after erected was at that time a part: as
appears in the old Index of the Provinces, Index Provinciar. edit. a
Schonhovio. Fest. Ruf.
and by the Breviary of Rufus) should be reserved to the judgment of the
Bishop of Constantinople. So that, although the Bishop of Rome had not been
excluded from these Appeals by Justinians. Constitution, endowing Iustiniana
prima with the prerogatives aforementioned: yet were he barred nevertheless by
that other law of the ancient Emperors, by whom those Appeals were restrained
to Constantinople.

And as I know no reason why the Bishop of Thebes should make his appeal to
Rome from the Bishop of Iustiniana (except perhaps one would say, that he was
not of the ordinary jurisdiction of the Bishop of Iustiniana, and that it was
about a matter done not in Illyricum, but in Greece, which was not under the
jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople:) so know I no good reason, why
Gregory on the other side should give that appeal any entertainment,
considering the allegations before mentioned; except he should pretend the old
Canon of Sardica for liberty of Appeals to the Roman Bishops (no Provinces
being by the Canon excepted:) or think that the Bishop of Iustiniana prima was
subject to him, because at the first erection of that primacy by Justinian, he
was perhaps consecrated by Vigilius Bishop of Rome. But as this act was
performed by the appointment of the Emperor: so that Canon of Sardica, so much
stood on, seems by the later and greater Council of Chalcedon again to be
revoked, and the order of Appealing otherwise restrained; as you may read in
the ninth Canon of that Council.

And thus, confessing my ignorance of the reasons of other men's irregular
actions, I end: having wearied my self and dulled my pen, perhaps to trouble
you more then to satisfy you. Yet this latter was my purpose, and to take the
trouble my self for your satisfaction. Howsoever it fall out: I doubt not but
you will accept what is well written, for my good wills sake to pleasure you
(who am not wont to write discourses of this kind to many men) and pardon the
imperfections and errors which may perhaps escape me, because it was my
intention to write the truth (whereof I have no where wittingly failed) and
because my little leisure and little learning would not allow me on the
sudden to do better.

FINIS.
THE VALIDITY OF THE ORDINATION Of the MINISERS of the REFORMED CHVRCHES BEYOND
THE SEAS, MAINtained against the Romanists, BY FRANCIS MASON. With A brief
Declaration premised thereunto, of the several Forms of Government received
in those CHURCHES. By JOHN DUREE.

OXFORD, Printed by LEONARD LICHFIELD. Anno Dom. 1641.

The several forms of Government, received in the Reformed Churches beyond
the Seas.
IN the Church of Sweden, the Government is committed to one Archbishop and
seven Bishops: whom formerly the King, and now the Regents of the kingdom do
appoint. Yet some kind and form of Election used by the Clergy, does go along
with that appointment.

The Bishops, as Bishops, have voice in Parliament: and with them so many of
the inferior Clergy, as are from every Socken (that is the name of a certain
number of Parishes) deputed to appear in Parliament, together with such
husbandmen as are usually sent thither in the name of a Socken.

The Bishops authority over the rest of the Clergy, is to direct and order
as well in as out of public meetings all Ecclesiastical assayres, according to
the received constitutions of the Church. And as they use not without counsel
and knowledge of their Consistorialls to do any thing of moment: so, if they
think it expedient, they may call a Synod of their Diocese, and therein make
such particular Constitutions as they shall think fit for their own
edification.

Their means and maintenance is answerable in some proportion to the place
wherein they are set above others, and so are by all respected and honored as
Fathers of the Church.

In Denmarck their authority is not so great: yet they keep the name and place
of Bishops; and have maintenance somewhat answerable to their place.

They are appointed by the King, for the ordering of Ecclesiastical affairs,
with the consent of their Brethren: in Confistory, as Directours of Meetings;
and out of Meetings, as peculiar Inspectors over the Church, to receive
complaints and provide that scandals may be taken out of the way.

In other Lutherane Churches, as in Holstein, Pomeren, Mekelenburgh, Brunswick,
Luneburgh, Bremen, Oldenburg, East Friesland, Hessen, Saxony, and all the upper
part of Germany, where Lutheranes bear rule, as also in most of the great
Imperial Cities, the Government of the Church belongs to Superintendents:
who are called and put in place by the Princes in their own Dominions, and by
the Magistrates in the great Cities. They have a Priority over the rest of the
Ministry: and commonly in the Dominions of Princes, there is an
Ecclesiastical Consistory made up of Clergy men and Counselors of the state,
to oversee and direct the Superintendents in things which may be expedient. To
which Consistory also the Decision of hard matters incident, when strife
arises, does belong.

In the Diocese of Bremen the Archbishop his Chancellor and Court does direct
and order all things in the name of his Highness. But in Brunswick and
Luneburgh, besides the General Consistory and the particular Superintendents,
which are ordinarily amongst all the rest of the Lutheranes, there be others
who are named Generales and Generalissimi Superintendentes: whereof the former
is subordinate unto the latter, and both unto the Supreme Ecclesiastical
Consistory; whereof the Generalissimus Superintendens, and such others as the
Prince does appoint, are members.

All these Superintendents are in place during life; and are allowed
maintenance in some proportion answerable to their priority of place above
others.

In the Reformed Churches heretofore in the Palatinate, the Government was
administered by those whom they called Inspectores and Praepositi: whose power
was the same with that of the particular Superintendents amongst the Lutherans.
And above these Inspectores was the Ecclesiastical Consistory; made up of
three Clergy men and three Counselors of state, with their President. These
the Prince named; and to them in his name the ordering of all matters did
belong.

In like manner, in the Wetteraw, in Hessen and in Anhalt, they have still
their Praepositos, and Superintendentes: with the same power and form of
Government, which is already mentioned.

Now in Holland, although their Presbyteriall or, as they call it, their
Classical Meetings are very frequent, videlicet every month, and their
Classical Synodes every year: yet they have of late found a necessity of
erecting some officers, to whom a more universal charge is committed, then
others have. These they call Deputatos Synodi: and are only temporary, for some
few years, with a limited power.

These Deputies of the Synod have their peculiar Meetings by themselves, upon
several incident occasions; but chiefly at the time of every Provincial
Synod; wherein they consult before hand, how matters ought to be laid and
proposed unto the Assemblies: and then in the Meeting they have a peculiar
place by themselves where they sit, and concerning every thing which is to be
determined the Praeses of the Synod does require of them first, that they
should open the matter unto the Assembly and declare their judgments of it,
before it be put to the Votes of the Multitude.

In Geneva and Helvetia, the Eldest Ministers have the place before others: and
for the most part that authority and respect, which in other Churches the
Superintendents receive by special order and constitution, these have by
custom and tacit consent of their Brethren; although at particular occasions
of Meetings they choose several Presidents of the action.

The like is also in France: where the Ministry of Paris (party by reason of
the Eminency of the place, partly by reason of the gifts and endowments of the
men ordinarily appointed to that place) does bear a great sway before all
others.

But in Transylvania, Polonia and Bohemia, the authority which is deferred unto
those whom they call, choose, and ordain (by particular imposition of hands of
other more ancient Seniors) to be their Seniors, is the very same which the
Bishops in ancient time had over other Ministers: as may appear to the full by
a Description thereof, and of all the ordinances of that Church; which are put
forth in a Book printed Anno 1633. with this title, Ratio Disciplinae
Ordinisque Ecclesiastici, in Vnitate Fratrum Bohemorum. Whereunto I desire to
remitte those who would know particulars.

THE ADDITION OF FRANCIS MASON unto his Defense of the Ministry of the Church
of England: wherein the Ordination of the Ministers of the Reformed Churches
beyond the Seas is maintained by him against the ROMANISTS.
PHILODOX. THough somewhat may be said for the Ministers of England, yet for
Luther and Calvin, and their Disciples, you can bring no show nor shadow of
probability.


ORTHODOX. That point is without the circle of our present subject, which
concerns only the Ministry of England.


PHILOD. I perceive you are afraid, and would feign fly the field: indeed I
cannot blame you, it is a dangerous point. Latet anguis in herba.


ORTHOD. The handling of a question of this nature requires the particular
knowledge of the estate of those Churches, with the occurrences and occasions,
out of which their proceedings and actions did grow; and that according to the
several circumstances of time, persons, and places, appearing by Records. In
which respect I would willingly refer this point to the learned men living in
the same Churches; which are best acquainted with the particulars of their own
estate. Notwithstanding least you should insult and triumph over our Brethren;
I am content to skirmish a little with you: using for my chiefest target your
own testimonies; as Judas Macchabeus protected Israel with the sword of
Apollonius. 1. Maccab. 3.12.


But the trumpets have already sounded to the encounter: behold we enter the
field; expecting your fiery darts, against the host of Israel.


PHIL. Until Protestants show the lawful vocation of their first head and
spring Martin Luther; they all, being derived of him, Acephali, those ancient
Heretics: even as the branch of an honorable house being stained, the whole
posterity after remains spotted.


ORTHOD. Are all the Pretestants derived from Martin Luther? you know the
contrary; in the Churches of England, Scotland, Helvetia, France, and Flanders.
Neither can any of the Protestants be counted Acephali. For those blaspheinous
Heretics, opposing themselves against the Council of Chalcedon, maintained
this damnable Heresy; Niceph. lib. 18. cap. 45.
that there is but one nature in Christ: whereas all we do most steadfastly
believe, and steadfastly profess; that Christ is God truly and Man perfectly,
one person inseparably, and yet two natures distinctly. God truly, against the
Arrians, condemned in the first general Council: Man perfectly, against the
Apolinarians, condemned in the second general Council. One person
inseparably, against the Nestorians, condemned in the third general Council.
Two natures distinctly, against the Eutychians, condemned in the fourth
general Council. From which Heresies, and all other, the Protestants may be
justified to be clear; and much clearer then your selves.


PHILOD. THe Acephali were so called, Isid. Origin. lib. 8. cap. 5.
Isidor, because there could be found no head nor author from whence they did
spring. Such are the Protestants: therefore they may be all called Acephali.


ORTHOD. You said even now, that our first head and spring was Martin Luther.
If you have found our head: how can you call us Acephali?


PHILOD. But who was Luthers head? or whence did he spring? he was a body
without a head, and a river without a spring.


ORTHOD. Did you not resemble him to a branch of an honorable house? therefore
if we may believe you, this branch has a root, this body a head, and this
river a spring.


PHILOD. Indeed he did spring from the Church of Rome, as he was a Priest: but
he was never Bishop; and yet he took upon him to ordain Ministers, as though
he had been a Bishop. Wherefore if you will grant that all ministerial power
must of necessity be derived from a Bishop as from a head; then seeing Luther
was no Bishop, he was no head, and so all his offspring are Acephali. But if you
deny this pre-eminence of Bishops: then flying Scylla, you fall into Charybdis;
and shunning the name of Acephali, you become Aerians.


ORTHOD. Or rather; if ministerial power may be derived from a Presbyter in
case of necessity, then are they not Acephali: if they acknowledge the
pre-eminence of Bishops, then are they not Aerians.


PHIL. What was the heresy of the Aerians? Ad Quodvult Deum. Haeres. 53.
S. Austen declares, how Ae^rius being prevented of a Bishopric, for grief
thereof falling from the Church, became an Arrian, and broached new opinions.
One whereof was, that there ought to be no difference, between a Bishop and a
Priest. And do not almost all the Lut herans and Calvinists teach the same?
For wherein does a Bishop excel a Presbyter so much, as in his Order? and what
is so proper to the excellent order, as the power of Ordination? Wherefore
seeing they communicate this to a Presbyter; they take away in effect all
difference; and so concur with the Aerians.


ORTHOD. For the dispelling of this cloud; let us first consider this Heresy,
and then examine this odious imputation. This heresy consisted not in this,
that a Bishop and a Presbyter are of one order; nor in this, that a Presbyter
in some causes may ordain: which points sundry of your selves do maintain
(as hereafter shall be declared) following herein (as they were verily
persuaded) Saint Jerome and others of the ancient Fathers, who are very far
from being Aerians. But what it was, and wherein it consists; we may learn
of Epiphanius and Austen. Epiph. haeres. 75.. 3.
Epiphanius describes it in this manner What is (said Aerius) a Bishop to a
Priest? the one differs nothing from the other. For there is one order, one
honor, and one dignity. The Bishop imposes hands; so does also the Priest.
The Bishop baptizeth; so does likewise the Priest. The Bishop is a disposer of
divine worship; and the Priest is likewise. The Bishop sits in the throne,
the Priest sits also. By Aug. ad Quod vult Deum haer. 53.
Austen thus: Dicebant Presbyterum ab Episcopo nulla differentia debere
discerni. i. The Aerians said, that a Bishop ought to be distinguished from a
Priest by no difference.

What meant Aerius when he said, there ought to be no difference? He could not
mean that there ought to be none, by the laws of the Church: for it is
evident, that they put a difference. Therefore his meaning was; that by the
word of God, there ought to be no difference. So he controuled the pre-eminence
of Bishops, as contrary to the Scripture.

Wherein his own position was false, and contrary to the Scriptures: which
plentifully proves the pre-eminence of Bishops. For though there were many
Presbyters in Ephesus and Crete, yet 1 Timothy 1.3. lb. 5.19. Tit. 1.5.
Saint Paul left Timothy at Ephesus, and Titus at Crete, to ordain
Presbyters, to command them not to teach any other doctrine, or if they did, to
put them to silence; as also to examine witnesses, and receive accusations. And
forasmuch as the end and use of their office was perpetual; therefore the
function and office it self must likewise be perpetual. Which proves that it
was given to them as they were Bishops, not as they were Evangelists.

Moreover the calling of Bishops is approved by the mouth of Christ himself,
when he adorned the seven Prelates of the seven Churches, with the honorable
title of Stars and Angels. If they be Angels; then are they Messengers of
the Lord of Hosts. If they be his Messengers; then are they sent from him, and
their vocation by him authorized. But what is their charge? Revel. 2.9.14, 15,
20.
to try false Apostles, and not to suffer the doctrine of Balaam, nor the
doctrine of the Nicolaitans; nor to permit the woman Iesabell to teach and
seduce the people, or to make them commit fornication, and eat meat sacrificed
to Idols. That is, both to oversee the doctrine, and discipline of the Church.

If this be their charge: then in this God has given them authority, to amend
what is amiss. which authority is not given to many, but to one Angel, in
every one Church of the seven Churches. Why should that one be charged above
the rest; if he had not pastoral power besides the rest? And he is called the
Angel of the Church: not of the people, nor of the Presbyters, but of the
whole Church. If he be the Angel of the whole Church: then he has pastoral
authority over the whole Church; and is armed with spiritual power, to govern
the same, and to reform abuses, both in the Ministers and in the people.
Wherefore the opinion of Aerius concerning these Angels, as contrary to the
word of God, is it self contrary unto it; and in this sense justly censured
for an Heresy. Now let us see whether it can be imputed to Luther and Calvin.

It is confessed by Tom. 4. Disp. 9. q. 1. p. 2. sect. 9.
Gregory de Valentia, Anabaptists, all the sectaries (so it pleases him to
style the Protestants) admit three degrees of Ministers; to wit, Bishops (whom
they call Superintendents) Presbyters, and Deacons. Therefore by the testimony
of your own Jesuit they cannot be Aerians. And surely it is famously known to
the world to be so, in the reformed Churches of Denmark, Suevia, and high
Germany: as also in Saxony, even at Wittenberge, where Luther flourished.
Concerning which, thus writes Iacobus Heerbrandus, sometimes Divinity Reader
at Tubinge. Heerbrand, Loc. Com. de ministerio Ecclesiae. page 699.
Truly there ought to be degrees amongst the Ministers: as with us in the
Dutchey of Wittenberge, there are Subdeacons, Deacons, Pastors, special
Superintendents, and over them general Superintendents. How can they disallow
the pre-eminence of Bishops; seeing their Superintendents are nothing else but
Bishops? For when the name Bishop was grown odious, by reason of abuses in the
Popish Prelates; they retaining the dignity it self, changed the word Bishop
into Superintendent, which is equivalent in signification.


PHILOD. If they allow the state of Bishops; why then did they banish their
Catholic Bishops?


ORTHOD. They banished the Popish Bishops: not because they were Bishops, but
because they were Popish. For first, such as sought reformation entreated them
to redress abuses: which they utterly refused. Then the Magistrates were told,
that it was their duty to reform the Church, by the example of the godly Kings
of Judah: which sundry of them did; yet so, that the Bishops might have kept
their places if they would have favored the Gospel of Christ. as may appear
by the authors of the Augustane Confession.

De Eccles. Potestat.
The Bishops (say they) might easily retain the obedience due unto them, if
they urged us not to keep those traditions, which we cannot keep with a good
conscience. And again: Apolog. Confessionis Augustanae. ad artic. 14. de
ordine Ecclesiastico.
We have often protested, that we do heartily approve the Ecclesiastical
policy and degrees in the Church, and so much as lies in us, do desire to
preserve them. We do not mislike the authority of Bishops, so they would not
compel us to do against Gods commandments. And again. Ibid.
Furthermore we do protest, and we would have it recorded, that we would
willingly preserve the Ecclesiastical and Canonical policy; if the Bishops
would cease to tyrannize over our Churches. This our mind or desire shall
excuse us with all posterity, both before God, and all Nations: that it may not
be imputed unto us, that the authority of Bishops is overthrown by us.

To the same effect speaks George Prince Anhalt. Princeps Anhalt. in Co^cion.
super Matthew. 7. de falsis prophetis: and in Praefatione, tit. de Ordinations.
Would to God that as they carry the name and titles of Bishops; so they would
show themselves to be Bishops of the Church. would to God, that as the book of
Gospells is delivered them, and laid upon their shoulders in their Ordination;
so they would teach doctrine according thereunto, and would faithfully govern
their Churches thereby. O how willingly, and with what joy of heart, would we
receive them for our Bishops; and reverence them, obey them, and yield unto
them their due jurisdiction, and ordination.

I pass by other Colloquies, at Colloquium Wormaciense: tit. de personis
Ecclesiasticis; and tit. de abusibus Ecclesiarum emendandis.
Worms, and Acta Colloq. Ratisbon. a Buceto edita. tit. de Ecclesiae
hierarchico ordine. paragr. 7.
Ratisbone; wherein the degrees of Bishops, Archbishops, and Patriarchs, are
commended as profitable to preserve the unity of the Church. Concerning which,
Melancthon writes thus to Camerarius. Melancth. ep. ad Camerarium. an. 1530.
By what right or Law may we dissolve the Ecclesiastical policy, if the
Bishops will grant us that which in reason they ought to grant? and though it
were lawful for us so to do, yet surely it were not expedient. Luther was
ever of this opinion. And that they mean unfainedly as they speak, may
appear by their dealing with Michael Sidonius. Historia Confess. Augustanae
per Chytraeum.
Whom they thrust out of his Bishopric, because of his Popery; yet afterward,
when he embraced the Gospel, advanced him again to that Ecclesiastical
office. So far were those whom you call Lutherans from being Aerians.


PHILOD. Geneva, and those Cities that embrace the Genevian Discipline?


ORTHOD. Their opinions are apparent by Calvine and Beza. The judgment of
Calvine is the same with the Augustane Confession, to which he subscribed; and
is likewise declared Calvin. ad Sadolet. and de Necessitate Reformandae
Ecclesiae; sub. sin.
in his Epistle to Cardinal Sadolet: where he protests, that if the Bishops
would so rule, as to submit themselves to Christ; then if their shall be any,
that shall not submit themselves to that Hierarchy, reverently, and with the
greatest obedience that may be, there is no kind of Anathema whereof they are
not worthy. Likewise in his Institutions. Id. Instltut. lib. 4. cap. 4.. 4.
Quod autem singulae Provinciae etc. That every Province had one Archbishop,
amongst their Bishops; and moreover that Patriarchs were appointed in the
Nicene Council, which were superior to Archbishops in order and dignity:
that belongs to the preservation of Discipline. And in his Epistles to
Archbishop Cranmer, and the Bishop of London, he gives them most reverent and
honorable titles.


PHILOD. Does not Beza in many places speak bitterly against Bishops?


ORTHOD. But he expounds himself that he meant the Popish Bishops only. For
having spoken against their tyranny; he makes this exception. Bez. de diverse.
gradib. minist. contr. Sarav. cap. 21.. 2.
Neque tamen etc. Yet we do not therefore accuse all Bishops and Archbishops.
for what arrogance were that? Nay so as they do imitate the examples of the
old Bishops, and endeavor as much as they can to reform the house of God so
miserably deformed, according to the rule of Gods word: why may we not
acknowledge all of them, (now so called Archbishops and Bishops) obey them,
and honor them with all reverence? So far are we from that which some object
against us most falsely and impudently; as though we took upon us to prescribe
to any Church, in any place our examples to be followed: like unto those unwise
men, who account well of nothing but of that which they do themselves. And
concerning the Bishops of England, he says thus. Id. ibid. cap. 18.. 3.
Quod si nunc etc. But if now the reformed Churches of England do stand under
propped with the authority of Bishops and Archbishops (as it happened to that
Church in our memory, that it had more of that sort, not only famous Martyrs of
God, but also most excellent Pastors and Doctors) fruatur saneista singulari
Dei beneficentia, quae utinam illi sit perpetua, let her truly enjoy this
singular blessing of God; which I wish may be perpetual unto her.

By this you may see, how far these learned Divines did differ from Aerians.
For Aerius condemned the state of Bishops, as contrary to the Scriptures: these
men commend it, and pray that it may be perpetual.


PHIL. Aerians: you cannot maintain their Ordination. For what power is in a
Presbyter to ordain? When Coluthus a Presbyter of Alexandria presumed to
ordain Presbyters, and among the rest one Ischyras: all his Ordinations were
revised, and made void by the Epist. Synod. Alexandr. in Apol. 2. Athanas.
Council of Alexandria, as witnesses Athanasius. Likewise when a certain
Bishop of Spain, imposing hands upon two to make them Deacons, and upon a
third to make him a Presbyter; and being not able to read by reason of his sore
eyes, caused a Presbyter standing by to give the blessing, that is, to
pronounce the words of Ordination: though the Ordainer by reason of death
escaped the censure; yet the parties so ordained were deposed by the Council.
Hispalens. II. cap. 5. Distinct. 23. c. 14. Quorund. Clericor.
second Council of Hispalis. If Luther were weighed in this balance: the
ordained should be deposed, the ordainer censured, and the ordinations voyded.


ORTHOD. It is one thing to be void according to the strictness of the Canon,
and another to be simply void in the nature of the thing. If a Bishop ordain
another man's Cleark: it was pronounced void by the famous Conc. Nicaen. Can. 16.
Council of Nice. Ordinations without Title were decreed to be void by the
great Conc. Chalced. can. 6.
Council of Chalcedon. The ordination of a Bishop without the consent of a
Metropolitan was made void by the Council. Braccar. 2. c. 3. Did. 65. c. 2.
Non debet. etc. 3. Episcopus non est.
Council of Braccar. Yet in all those, according to your own doctrine, the
Power is given, the Character imprinted; and consequently there is no nullity
in the nature of the thing. How then are they void? in respect of Execution,
for Disciplines sake; until it please the Church otherwise to dispose.


PHILOD. Then the ordinations of Luther are void; if not in the nature of the
thing, yet at least in respect of Execution. So that his offspring, either have
no orders, or they must surcease as though they had none. For there is the same
reason of him and Coluthus.


ORTHOD. Not so. For it was well said of one of your Popes: Iohann. VIII.
epist. ad Anselm. Lemovic. 30. q. 1. Ad limina.
Inculpabile judicandum, quod intulit necessitas. That which necessity
occasioned, is not to be blamed. Whereby you may learn, that extraordinary
causes of necessity are not to be measured by ordinary rules. Neither is
Luther to be paralleld with Coluthus, or the Spanish Priest; whose violations
of the Canon were merely voluntary. Pope Felix. IV. epist 1. Vid. Gratian. 2.
qu. 7. cap. Mutationes. and, Scias. item de Consecrat. did. 1. cap. Sicut.
Felix may inform you; Aliter tractandam necessitatis rationem, aliter
voluntatis.


PHILOD. Was it not a case of necessity, when the Bishop was blind, and could
not read the words?


ORTHOD. No. for if he had them not in his memory, he might have pronounced
them after another; or, (as now the Council of Trent has provided in the like
cases) he might have procured them to be ordained by some other Bishops. But
Luthers case was indeed a case of necessity: as hereafter shall be proved.


PHILOD. If a Presbyter, as he is a Presbyter, were endued with intrinsecall
power and ability to ordain, and were restrained from the execution of it only
by the Church for Disciplines sake; then peradventure his Ordinations might be
tolerable in case of invincible necessity. But neither has a Presbyter such
power; neither was this a case of necessity.


ORTHOD. resolution in this question, to wit; By what power a Bishop is
intrinsecally enabled to give orders?


PHILOD. All the power of a Bishop, is either of Jurisdiction or of Order. Now
we hold, that though the Pope take from him his Jurisdiction, he may
notwithstanding give orders, if he will. And albeit he sin in giving them, yet
they are true orders: which proves invincibly, that the collation of orders is
not from Jurisdiction. But from what order? not from the order of Priesthood
alone: for then every Presbyter should have power to give orders; (which
position is condemned by the Sess. 23. Can. 7.
Council of Trent) not from the Episcopal considered alone and apart from the
Priesthood. for the Bishopric without the Priesthood (says Bellarm. de
Sacram. Ordinis, cap. 5.. 16.
Bellarmine) is so far from being a superior order, that in very deed it is
nothing, but a mere figment in the mind. Wherefore I will anwere your
question, with these words in Gregory de Valentia: Gregor. de Valentia. to. 4.
d. 9. q. 1. p. 4. resp. ad arg. 1.
Episcopum non per solam potestatem quam in Episcopali ordine accepit, sed per
illam, and simul per Sacerdotalem potestatem, ordinare Sacerdotem. A Bishop
ordains Priests, not by the power only which he received when he was
ordained Bishop; but by his Episcopal and Presbyteriall power joined together.
which is agreeable to Bellarmine, saying. Bellarm. de Sacram. ord. cap. 5.. 13.
The entire Episcopal ordination arises from a double ordination: and the
entire and perfect Episcopal character (which is an absolute, perfect and
independent power of conferring the sacraments of Confirmation and Order) is
not one simple quality, but a thing composed of a double Character.


ORTHOD. Sacrament and Character of order. wherefore if it can be proved out
of your own writers, that every Presbyter has as much as a Bishop of the
Sacrament and Character of order; you must confess that every Presbyter has
intrinsecall power to give orders. But this shall be proved by a world of
witnesses: all affirming in effect, that which is added in Episcopal
Consecration, whereby a Bishop is distinguished from a Presbyter, is neither
Sacrament of order, nor imprinteth a Character.

To begin with the Schoolmen.

The Master of the Sentences says: 4. Sent. did. 24.
Cumque omnes spirituales sint etc. Whereas all the seven orders are spiritual
and sacred; yet the Canons think that two only are called sacred orders by an
excellency, to wit, the order of Deaconship and Priesthood: because the
Primitive Church, so far as we can read, had only these two; and of these
only we have the Apostles precept. For the Apostles ordained Bishops and
Presbyters in every City; we read also that Levits (he means Deacons) were
ordained by the Apostles. Thus he affirms that the Primitive Church in the
Apostles time had Bishops, Priests, and Deacons: yet acknowledges but two
sacred orders; the Deaconship and the Priesthood. And whereas he says: Ordo
Episcoporum est quadripartitus, the order of Bishops is branched into four
parts; it is certain he takes the word Order largely, and improperly, which
may appear, because a little before he excludes the Episcopal function from
being an Order, in these plain and express terms. Sunt and alia quaedam, non
ordinum; sed dignitatum vel officiorum nomina: dignitatis simul and officii
nomen est Episcopus. There be also other names, not of Orders but of Dignities
and offices: yea a Bishop is a name both of Dignity and Office.

Bonaventure: 4. Sent. did. 24. q. 3. a. 2.
Episcopatus desicit ab ordine, etc. The Episcopal function comes short of
an order: because order is a seal that is a Character. because a seal does
signify a Character: and this Character is not imprinted in the Episcopal
function (a sign whereof is this, that a Bishop cannot be consecrated, unless
he be a Priest) and so of it self it does not imprint a Character, Moreover,
it fails from being an Order, because there is not given any new power; but
only the power of binding and loosing is enlarged. And; Episcopatus includit
necessario ordinem perfectissimum, scilicet Sacerdotium, and illi super addit
eminentiam. The Episcopal function includes necessarily the most perfect
order, to wit the Priesthood, and adds unto it eminency.

Thomas Aquinas says. Supplement. 3 part. q. 40. art. 5.
Ordo potest accipi dupliciter. etc. Order may be taken two ways: one way, as
it is a Sacrament; and so (as it is said before) every order is ordered to the
Sacrament of the Eucharist: whereupon seeing a Bishop has no more superior
power then a Priest in this respect the Bishoply function shall not be an
order, Order may be considered another way, in that it is a certain office, in
respect of certain sacred actions: and so seeing a Bishop has power in
Hierarchichall actions above a Priest, in respect of the body Mystical; the
Bishoply function shall be an Order.

Durandus. In 4. sent. did. 24. q. 6.
Dicendum est, quod Episcopatus, seu ordinatio Episcopalis est Ordo and
Sacramentum, non quidem praecise distinctum a sacerdotio simplici, sed ut est
unum sacramentum cum ipso; sicut perfectum and imperfectum. i. e. It is to be
said, that the Bishoply function, or the Episcopal ordination, is an order and
a sacrament, not truly and precisely distinct from the simple Priesthood, but
as it is one sacrament with the Priesthood; even as perfect and imperfect.

Dominicus Soto. De Iustit. and Iure l. 10. q. 1. art. 2. and. 4. sent. did.
24. q. 2. art. 3.
Episcopatus non est sacramentum Ordinis: est tamen Ordo, hoc est, Dignitas and
gradus altior sacerdotio, cui eminentiora officia sunt annexa. i. e. The
Bishopship is not a sacrament of Order: and yet it is an order, that is, a
higher dignity and degree them Priesthood, to which certain eminent offices
are annexed.

Richardus. In 4. sent. did. 24. art. 5. q. 2.
Ordo dupliciter potest accipi: uno modo, pro gradu potestatis ordinatae,
mediate vel immediate, ad consecrationem corporis vel sanguinis Christi; alio
modo, pro quolibet gradu potestatis respectu quarumlibet actionum sacrarum.
Primo modo, Ordo est sacramentum: and sic Episcopatus non est ordo. etc. i.e.
Order may be taken two ways: one way, for the degree of an ordinate power,
mediatly or immediately, to the consecration of the body or blood of Christ;
another way, for any degree of power in respect of certain sacred actions. In
the first sense, Order is a sacrament: and so Episcopatus is not an order. and
before. Non sunt nisi septem ordines in Ecclesia: quod non esset verum, si
Episcopatus esset ordo. i. e. There are but seven orders in the Church: which
would not be true, if Episcopatus were an Order.

Aureolus does argue, In 4. d. 24. q. 1. art. 2.
by proving that the Episcopal function is not another order distinct from the
Priesthood; because then this order should be either superior then a Priest,
or inferior. But it is neither so, nor so. Therefore it is no way an order.
The Minor is proved. Because it is apparent that it cannot be an inferior
order; because that which is inferior is first taken, and is presupposed to
the superior order. But Episcopal consecration is not presupposed to the
Priestly ordination, but rather the contrary. And that it is not a superior
order is plain: because it has no superior act, as it is distinguished
against Priesthood. which is apparent: because the act of a Bishop, as he
differs from Priesthood, is to ordain; and the act of a Priest, as he
differs from a Bishop, is to make the body of Christ: which is a better, and
more worthy act, then to ordain. Peradventure it will be said, that the
Episcopal degree is worthier; because it includes the Priestly order, and
besides this, adds somewhat else, which is proper to it self, and both these
together are more worthy then the one by it self. But it is otherwise, because
the Bishoply function is not here compared to the Priesthood, in respect of
that which they both include; but precisely, in respect of that whereby one
differs from another. Therefore though the Episcopal function may be called
an Order, yet not distinct from the Priesthood: because it is not referred to
any act superior to the act of Priesthood, nor inferior, nor equal. Hitherto
Aureolus.

I need produce no more Shcoolemen upon the Master of the Sentences: because
Navar. in Manuali. c. 22. number. 18.
Navarrus says, there are only seven Orders, according to the common opinion
of Divines; affirming that the first tonsure, and the Bishoply function are not
Orders, but Offices. Neither is this only a common, but the more common
opinion: as witnesses In scrutinio Sacerdotali. Tract. 2. de Ordine.
Fabius Incarnatus. Communior opinio est, quod prima tonsura and Ordo
Episcopalis non sunt ordines. i.e. It is the more common opinion, that the
first tonsure and Episcopal order, are not Orders. Where note by the way, that
phrase of speech. The Episcopal Order is not an Order (an Order, and not an
Order:) signifying, that though men speaking vulgarly, do improperly call it
an Order; yet in his judgment, to speak exactly, it is not an Order.


PHILOD. Surely the Canonists do hold it an Order.


ORTHOD. First not all the Canonists. for whereas Did. 93. cap. Legimus.
Gratian brought in Saint Ierom, word for word, affirming that a Bishop and a
Priest are the same: the author of the Gloss has these words. Some say that
in the first primitive Church, the office of Bishops and Presbyters was common,
and the names were common; but in the second primitive Church both names and
offices began to be distinguished. And again. A third sort say, this advancing
was made in respect of name, and in respect of administration, and in respect
of certain ministeries which belong only to the Episcopal office. And the
same author himself is of this opinion; saying. Before this advancing, these
names Bishops and Presbyters, were altogether of the same signification, and
the administration was common: because Churches were governed by the common
advise of Presbyters. And again. This advancing was made for a remedy against
schism: as it is here said by Saint Ierom. That one should have the
pre-eminence in regard of the name, the administration, and certain
sacraments, which now are appropriated unto Bishops.


We must understand, that when they distinguish the primitive Church into first
and second; they begin the first at the Ascension of Christ; extending it to
the time when the Apostles began to single out one Presbyter in every city, and
gave him pre-eminence above the rest. In which time the office of Bishops and
Presbyters is said to be common; because those offices, which are now
appropriated unto Bishops, were then in their judgment performed by
Presbyters. And those which hold, that the office and administration were
altogether common, must needs hold them to be one order: for an absolute
identity of offices, does argue an absolute identity of order.

Secondly, those Canonists which make nine orders, do not differ from the
Schoolmen: as witnesses Bellarmine. Bellar. l. de Clericis. cap. 11. sect.
ult.
In re non est dissensio. There is no difference in the thing it self. For the
Divines do only consider orders in relation to sacrifice; in which respect a
Bishop and a Presbyter are not distinguished: but the Canonists consider them
as they make an Hierarchy; and therefore they rightly distinguish a Bishop from
a Presbyter. Wherefore howsoever they call it an order, in respect of regiment;
yet they neither think it to be a Sacrament of Order, nor to imprint a
Character.

TO these we may add a cloud of witnesses.

Apud Binium, Council. Tom. 4.
Henry Kalteisen, in his answer to the second article of the Bohemians in the
Council of Basil says. It is apparent, that from the beginning of the legal
Priesthood until now, there was always a distinction of a Bishop from a
Priest; although they were after reckoned by the same name for their affinity
which they have in authority: because a Bishop excels a Priest only in
jurisdiction, or in the dignity of jurisdiction. If only in the dignity of
jurisdiction, then not in order, according to the judgment of Kalteisen; who
was a Dominican Friar, and Professor of Divinity in the University of Collen,
and one of the Inquisitors against Heretics: whose Oration was lately set out
by Henricus Canisius Professor of the sacred Canons at Ingolstad, and inserted
into the body of the Counsels by Binius.

Tostatus. Tostat. in Exodus 29. q. 18. p. 144.
Sic est in consecrationibus, etc. So is it in the consecration of Bishops or
of the Pope: in which there is not imprinted a character; seeing they are not
orders, but dignities or degrees of Ecclesiastical preeminence. And again.
Non dicitur potestas Episcopalis character: neque vocamus proprie Episcopatum
Ordinem, neque etiam sacramentum. The Episcopal power is not called a
character: neither do we call the Episcopal function properly an Order, nor a
Sacrament. Armachanus. Armachan. Sum. ad quaestion. Armenorum, l. 11. cap. 2.3
4, 5, 6.
Episcopus in hujusmodi etc. A Bishop in such things has no more in respect of
his order then every simple Priest: although the Church has appointed that
such things should be executed only by those men whom we call Bishops. And
again. Est etiam alia ratio etc. There is also an other manifest reason:
because from the time of distinction of Churches and Parishes, no (...) man can
law fully execute such things, but only in those places in which he has power
of government; which because simple Priests have not, they cannot exercise the
acts of it lawfully, nor other sacramental acts, unless this be specially
committed unto them by them which have authority in those places. Which
restraint of Priestly power was not in the Primitive Church. This seems to me
to be according to the holy Scripture.

Gerson. Gers. de septem Sacramentis.
Supra Sacerdotium non est ordo superior; imo nec Episcopatus, nec
Archie-piscopatus. i. Above Priesthood there is no superior order; no not the
function of a Bishop or Arch. bishop.

Alphons. in verbo, Episcopus.
Alphonsus de Castro, speaking of the Aerians, says thus: Lectorem admonere
decrevi, etc. I have determined to admonish the Reader, that he do not suppose
that I so contradict the Heretics in this behalf, that I think the
Episcopal function to be an other order from the Priesthood. Which I have
therefore given you warning of; because there are some which are of opinion,
that the Episcopal function does differ from the Priesthood, as the Priesthood
does differ from the Deaconship, towit so, that there should be an other
character imprinted in the ordination of a Bishop, then was in the ordination
of a Priest.

Fab. Incarnat. in scrutinio Sacerdotali.
Fabius Incarnatus. Dicitur improprie Ordo, ratione jurisdictionis; sed tamen
non est Sacramentum, sed est quoddam sacramentale: idcirco dignitas Episcopalis
non est ordo, imo praesupponit ordinem Sacerdotalem; sed est ordinis Eminentia,
vel dignitas. It is called an order improperly, in respect of jurisdiction; but
notwithstanding it is not a Sacrament, but as a certain Sacrament all thing.
Therefore the Episcopal dignity is not an order, but rather it presupposes
the Sacerdotall Order: but it is an eminence of order, or dignity. And again.
How many holy orders are there? I answer; that there are the Orders of
Subdeacon, Deacon, and Priest.

Canis. Catechism. de sacrament. Ordinis.. 4.
Petrus Canisius, a Spanish Jesuit asks this question: How many degrees does
the Sacrament of Order comprehend? and answers, that it does comprehend
generally the lesser orders, and the greater: to wit, four lesser, of the
Doore-keepers, Exorcists, Readers, and Acolytes; and three greater, of
Subdeacons, Deacons and Priests. Which last he divides into greater and
lesser, but accounts them both one Order: as may appear by these words. Et
quanquam quod ad Ordinis Sacramentum, and ad sacrificandi authoritatem attinet,
discrimen inter Episcopos and Sacerdotes non sit: tamen sunt illi Sacerdotibus
multo excellentiores. etc. Although there be no difference between Bishops and
Priests, in regard of the sacrament of order, and the authority of sacrificing:
yet Bishops are much more excellent. This authority is the greater; In Epistola
dedicatoria.
because the book is set forth by the edict of the Emperor, and commanded by
the King of Spain to be taught in the Low Countries, both in Churches and in
Schools.

All this while have I said nothing of Michael Medina, de sacrorum hominum
origin ac continentia; lib. 1. cap. 5.
Medina, who was a principal Bishop of the Council of Trent, and affirms
that Jerome, Ambrose, Austine, Sedulius, Primasius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and
Theophylact, are of the same opinion. Omnes colligunt ideo aut Episcopos
Presbyteros, aut Presbyteros vocari Episcopos; quod una eademque res esset
Episcopus and Presbyter, quantu^ ad Ordinis potestatem attinet. All collect
that therefore Bishops were called Priests, or Priests Bishops; because a
Bishop and a Priest were one and the self same thing, in respect of the power
of Order. Which places of the Fathers. I do not particularly produce; because
my purpose is only at this time, to justify the Reformed Churches by the
testimonies of your own Popish writers.

HItherto you have heard the judgment of particular persons: Rome. For the
Catechism. Roman. pars. 2.. 12. and 26.
Roman or Tridentine Catechism (set out by the decree of the Council of
Trent, and by the commandment of Pius Quintus; and therefore to be
acknowledged as the doctrine of the whole Roman Church) says. Docendum igitur
erit, hosce omnes ordines septenario numero contineri, semperque it a a
Catholica Ecclesia traditum esse: quorum nomina haec sunt. Ostiarius, Lector,
Exorcista, Acolythus, Subdiaconus, Diaconus, Sacerdos. i. Therefore it shall be
fit to be taught, that all those orders are comprehended within the number of
seven, and that it was always so delivered by the Catholic Church: the names
whereof are these. The Doore-keeper, Lecturer, Exorcist, Acolyte, Subdeacon,
Deacon, and Priest. Here is no mention of the Bishop: and yet all orders are
here comprehended. Wherefore the Pope and Council do teach as the general
doctrine of the Catholic Church; that the Episcopal office is no order
distinct from the order of Priesthood.

PHILOD. Bellarmin. de Sacrament. Ordinis, lib. 1. cap. 5.
THey are one order in genere, in specie: for so they are distinct orders.


ORTHOD. This is contrary to the stream of your own Writers before alleged:
who hold seven Orders, the last whereof is Priesthood; and do not make the
order of Priesthood to contain a special order, but plainly exclude the
Episcopal office from being an Order. Some of whose Arguments I will produce:
whereunto let us see what you can answer.

You teach generally, that the diversity of holy orders, properly so called,
arises from distinct relations to the Eucharist. But a Bishop, in that he
differs from a Presbyter, has not any distinct relation to the Eucharist.
Therefore a Bishop, in that he differs from a Priest, has not a diverse
order.


PHILOD. Bellarm. ibid.
Though the Bishop and the Presbyter have the same power in consecrating of the
Eucharist; yet they participate it in diverse manners. Wherefore it comes to
pass, that they are two species Sacerdotum. For the Presbyter in consecrating
the Eucharist, at least in respect of the use, depends upon the Bishop: who
may forbid him to consecrate, and suspend or command him to do it, in such a
place, in such a time, in such a manner.


ORTHOD. This argues jurisdiction over his Person, not any more power or
authority in consecrating, nor any distinct relation to the Eucharist.


PHILOD. A Bishop has this power so, that he may communicate it to others by
imposition of hands: which a Presbyter cannot do.


ORTHOD. This is to beg the point in question. Therefore if your Jesuits have
no better objections; the former Argument will stand impregnable.

An other of the Schoolemens Arguments may thus be framed.

If the Episcopal function be a distinct species of Order; then this order is
either inferior to the order of Priesthood, or superior, or equal. But it is
not inferior: because then one should be made Bishop before he were a Priest;
which is absurd. Neither is it a superior order: for then it should be a more
noble order then Priesthood, and consequently perform a more noble act. Which
is contrary to the common judgment of your own men. Bonav. in 4. Sent. did.
24. part. 2. art. 2. q. 3. sect. 3.
Bonaventure calls Priesthood, ordinem perfectissimum, the most perfect
order. Aureolus says: Aureolus in 4. Sent. d. 24. q. 1. art. 2.
Nobilior actus est, consicere Corpus Christi, quam ordinare. To make the Body
of Christ, is a more noble act, then to ordain. Durandus: Durand. in 4. d. 24.
q. 6. sect. 9.
Actus nobilior est consecrare corpus Christi, quod pertinet ad Sacerdotem,
quam ordinatio Ministri, quod pertinet ad Episcopum: nam secundus est propter
primum. It is a more noble act, to consecrate the body of Christ, which
pertains to a Priest, then to ordain a Minister, which pertains to a
Bishop: for the second is for the first. Gerson: Gerson. in Compendio Theolog.
de Ordine.
Consecrare corpus Christi, est excellentissimum humanorum officiorum. to
consecrate the body of Christ, is the most excellent of humane offices. and
Bellarmine himself: Bellarm. de Sacramento Ordinis, cap. 5
Summa potestas est, posse consecrare Eucharistiam. the highest power is, to be
able to consecrate the Eucharist.


PHILOD. If one compare the Character, or power which a Bishop has from his
last Consecration, with the character which he has from his Presbyteriall
Ordination: then his latter is greater in respect of intention, because the
highest power is to consecrate the Eucharist; the former is greater in respect
of Extention, because it extends it self unto more things.


ORTHOD. The excellency of an Order depends not upon the variety of Objects,
but upon the excellency of the proper Act. Wherefore, seeing that you grant the
proper Act of Priesthood more excellent; you must likewise grant, that
Priesthood is the most excellent Order. Therefore the Episcopal function
cannot be an order either superior or equal unto it. And it was proved before,
that it cannot be an order inferior. So the conclusion follows; that it is
not properly any sacred Order at all.


PHILOD. The whole and entire Episcopal character is composed of a double
character: the first whereof is received when he is made Priest; the other,
when he is made Bishop. Now this whole and entire Episcopal character is more
excellent, then the Presbyteriall only; because it includes it, and adds
another unto it.


ORTHOD. This does not answer the point. For the Argument framed according to
the Question, speaks distinctly of that wherein the Bishop differs from a
Priest; and compares it with a Priesthood. Your Answer is of a totum
aggregatum, which comprehends both. Therefore it is not ad idem. So the
Conclusion remains firm, as before; that it is not an Order.

Which, me thinks, Bellarmine your great Bellwether, who first held, that they
were the same Order, and afterward maintained the contrary, is now in his old
age returned to his former opinion. What his judgment was in his former years,
may be seen in his book de Clericis, where he says, that Bellarm. de Clericis;
cap. 11.. 4.
Ecclesiastical Orders are taken two ways; properly and commonly. Orders
properly taken he calls such as are conferred by a Bishop, with a certain
sacred and solemn rite, and are referred to the performance of some certain
ministry about the Divine sacrifice. Orders commonly taken he calls such, as
are any way dedicated to Divine offices, though it be without relation to
sacrifice: which he exemplifieth in Monks and Nuns. The proper Orders he
affirms to be seven in number: the chief whereof is Priesthood. Concerning
the difference of a Priest and a Bishop, these are his words. Et si Episcopus
and Presbyter distinguantur; tamen quantum ad sacrificium idem omnino
ministerium exhibent: proinde unum Ordinem, non duos faciunt. i. Although a
Bishop and a Presbyter be distinguished; yet in respect of the sacrifice, they
perform altogether the same ministry. Therefore they make one order, not two.

Yet in his book of the Sacrament of Order, he affirms that Id. de sacramento
Ord. cap. 5. sect. 11. and 13.
Episcopal Ordination is a Sacrament; that a Bishop has a new Character; that
Episcopatus is one Order with Priesthood in general not in special; that the
Episcopal character is compounded of a double character, and that two
Sacraments are required to make a Bishop. So here he holds it to be truly and
properly a new Order, a new Character, a new Sacrament.

Notwithstanding now at length, having put his last hand to his former works
of Controversies; considering be like, that this is contrary to the common
tenent of your Church: he retracteth and disclaimeth it, in these words. Id. in
Recognit. page 89.
Vbi dixi, Episcopatum and Presbyteratum esse unum Ordinem, sed genere non
specie; and paulo infra, Presbyteros and Episcopos esse duas species
Sacerdotum: rectius dixissem, esse unum Ordinem, sed gradus diversos. That is.
Whereas I said, that Episcopatus and Presbyteratus are the same Order in
general not in special; and a little after, that Presbyters and Bishops are
two species of Priests: I might have said more rightly, that they are one
Order, but diverse degrees. This is the final judgment of your chiefest
Champion.


PHILOD. YOur own Book of Orders calls it an Order, Preface; saying. It is
evident unto all men diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors;
that from the Apostles time, there have been these Orders of Ministers in
Christ's Church, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.


ORTHOD. The Canonists affirm it to be an Order: the Schoolmen deny it. Yet
Id. in lib. de Clericis, cap. 11. sect. ult.
Bellarmine and Sculting. Bibliothecae catholicae tom. 4. contra lib. 4.
Calvini. c. 9.. 22.
Scultingius avouch there is no difference between them. Because the Canonists
call it an Order in respect of Regiment: the Schoolmen deny it, as Order is a
Sacrament. In like manner, because a Bishop is sanctified and set a part with
Imposition of hands to public employment in Ecclesiastical Government; the
Church of England, with your Canonists, call it an Order: and yet many deny,
with your Schoolmen, that it is properly an Order, as Deaconship and
Priesthood. To which you may the rather be induced: because the Authors of the
Book having spoken first of the Ordering of Deacons, and then of Ordering of
Priests; when they come to the Form of making Bishops, they never call it
Ordering, but always Consecrating.


PHILOD. Surely the Fathers and Counsels do commonly call it Ordering: shall
there be Ordination, and not an Order?


ORTHOD. They call it so largely and improperly: as witnesses Bonaventure.
Bonavent. in Sentent. lib. 4. d. 24. part. 2. art. 2. q. 3. resp. ad object.
Non ita proprie dicitur aliquis ordinari, cum promovetur in Episcopum, ut cum
promovetur in sacerdotem; sed magis proprie dicitur consecrari. i. One is not
so properly said to be Ordained, when he is promoted to be Bishop, as when he
is promoted to be Priest; but is more properly said to be consecrated. Neither
is this the opinion of Bonaventure alone; but it is the common and current
Judgment of your Church. For those which deny this function to be an Order,
cannot with reason grant the ceremony whereby it is conferred to be properly
Ordering.


PHILOD. IF we should grant them to be one Order;


ORTHOD. You said before, that the intrinsecall power of Ordaining proceeded
not from Jurisdiction, but only from Order. Therefore if you grant, that a
Presbyter has the same Order that a Bishop; I will conclude, that a Presbyter
has intrinsecall power to give Orders.


PHILOD. That will not follow. for howsoever they be one and the same Order,
yet they differ in degree. Because there is a further extension of the
character in Episcopal consecration: which Extension produces two effects.
First, it makes it a sacrament: for that ceremony, which has this spiritual
and supernatural effect, really to extend a Character, without doubt shall be
a sacrament. And though Bellarmine recalled his opinion that they were two
distinct orders; yet he still maintains, that they are two distinct
sacraments. Secondly, in inableth a Bishop to confer the sacraments of
Confirmation and Order: which a Presbyter, though he had the self same Order
and Character, cannot confer; because he wants this extension, and in this
respect is unperfect.


ORTHOD. I answer two things. First, that this opinion is contrary to your
own Church. Secondly, that it is contrary to it self. Concerning the first:
you lay this down, as an undoubted Principle; that the Ceremony, wherein there
is a real extension of the Character, is a sacrament. But it is the common
opinion of your own Church, that the Ceremony of Episcopal consecration is
not a sacrament: as has been proved. Therefore according to the common opinion
of your own Church, in it there is no real extension of the Character.

Concerning the second, your Position is this: that a Bishop and a Priest have
but one Order and Character, yet differ in Degrees; because this Character is
so extended in Episcopal consecration, that it makes a new, proper, and
distinct Consecration. which position is contrary to it self. For if
Episcopal consecration be a distinct sacrament; what sacrament shall it be?
You must needs say, the sacrament of Order. But if it be a sacrament of Order
distinct from Priesthood; then it is a distinct Order. So the latter part of
your position is contrary to the first, wherein they are said to be but one
Order. Again, if it be a new and distinct sacrament of Order, then according
to your own doctrine, it must imprint a new and distinct character: which is
contrary to the first part of your Position; where you say, a Bishop and a
Priest have but one character. Moreover, if a Bishop be extended to a higher
degree; it should produce in him a more noble act, then in a Presbyter. But it
was plentifully proved, that the act of a Bishop is not more noble then the act
of a Presbyter. Therefore a Bishop has it not in a higher degree. Thus for all
your striving and struggling, you must be forced to confess; that it is neither
a distinct Order, nor a distinct Sacrament, nor imprinteth a new character, nor
intends nor extends the old; but is absolutely the same both in Nature and
in Degree.


PHILOD. What then does a Bishop receive in his Consecration?


ORTHOD. Your own Authors already cited may teach you; that he receives a
sacred office, an Eminency, a Jurisdiction, a Dignity, a Degree of
Ecclesiastical pre-eminence.


PHILOD. A degree? Did you not deny that a Bishop has any more excellency in
degree then a Presbyter; and will you now affirm it?


ORTHOD. He has no higher degree in respect of intention or extension of the
Character: but he has a higher degree, that is, a more excellent place in
respect of Authority and Jurisdiction in spiritual Regiment. Wherefore seeing
a Presbyter is equal to a Bishop in the power of Order; he has equally
intrinsecall power to give Orders: which is confessed by sundry of your Divines.


RIchardus Armachanus. Armachan. Sum. ad quaestion. Armen. lib. 11. c. 7.
Episcopus in ejusmodi etc. A Bishop in such things has no more power in
respect of his order, then every simple Priest: although the Church has
appointed, that such things should be executed only by those men whom we call
Bishops.

Hugo de Sancto Victore. Hugo de Sacram. lib. 2. p. 3. c. 12.
Summis ergo sacerdotibus etc. The foresaid things (among which was Ordination)
are reserved for the Highpriests or Bishops, in a singular manner: least the
very same authority of power should be challenged of all, and should make the
inferior proud against their superiors; and so should breed a scandal, by
dissolving the bond of Obedience.

Aureolus. Aureol. l. 4. d. 24. art. 2.
Omnis forma, ex quo est in actu, etc. Every form in as much as it is in act,
has power to communicate it self in the same kind: therefore every Priest
has power to celebrate orders. Why then do they not celebrate them? because
their power is hindered by the decree of the Church. Whereupon when a Bishop is
made, there is not given unto him any new power, but the former power being
hindered is set at liherty: as a man, when the act of reason is hindered, and
the impediment is remeved, there is not given unto him any new soul.

Antonius de Rosellis. Anton. Rosell. de potestate Imperatoris and Papae, part.
4. c. 18.
Quilibet Presbyter and Presbyteri ordinabant indiscrete and schismata
oriebantur. Every Presbyter and Presbyters did ordain indifferently; and there
arose schisms. Peter, with other Apostles, restrained the power of the
Character. so that Presbyters might not indifferently confer all Sacraments:
but they reserved some to those whom they created in Cities and Provinces; whom
they called Bishops. The Presbyteriall power was restrained, and the office of
the Character: so that certain things were reserved only to Bishops; as
Confirmation and Collation of Orders. Whereupon when a Bishop is consocrated,
that restraint of Priestly Character is set at liberty: the Sacraments which
were forbidden the Priestly order, and yet formerly belonging to the Priestly
Order, are enlarged. Wherefore by the consecration of a Bishop, there is not
made the impression of a new Character, but only the perfection of the Priestly
character.

PHILOD. THough all this were granted; yet you were never the nearer. for when
the Apostles advanced Bishops; the power of Presbyters was extinguished.


ORTHOD. It was restrained, not utterly extinguished: as the faculty of the
flying of a bird, when his wings are tied.


PHILOD. Was the advancing of Bishops the restraint of Presbyters? Then they
were restrained jure divino: because the pre-eminence of Bishops is jure divino.


ORTHOD. First, if you mean by Iure divino, that which is according to the
Scripture; then the pre-eminence of Bishops is jure divino: for it has been
already proved to be according to the Scripture. Secondly, if by Iure divino
you mean the ordinance of God: in this sense also it may be said to be Iure
divino. For it is an ordinance of the Apostles, whereunto they were directed by
Gods spirit, even by the spirit of Prophecy; and consequently the ordinance of
God. But if by Iure divino you understand a Law and commandment of God,
binding all Christian Churches universally, perpetually, unchangeably, and with
such absolute necessity, that no other form of regiment may in any case be
admitted: in this sense, neither may we grant it, nor yet can you prove it, to
be Iure divino.


PHILOD. Whence comes it then to be so generally received through the
Christian World?


ORTHOD. The Apostles in their life time ordained many Bishops; and left a
fair pattern to posterity. The Church following the commodiousnesse thereof,
embraced it in all ages through the Christian World.


PHILOD. If the wings of Presbyters were tied by the Church, following therein
the pattern of the Apostles, who were directed by the spirit of God: what
authority had Luther to untie them?


ORTHOD. It was not voluntary in him, but a case of necessity.


PHILOD. Neither was there any necessity; neither can necessity authorize a man
in a matter of this nature.


ORTHOD. I will prove both: and in the first place consider the force of
Necessity.

The Scripture declares, when the Priests were too few, and not able to slay
all the burnt offerings; their brethren the Devites did help them, till they
had ended the work, and until other Priests were sanctified. (2. Chron. 29.34,
35.) By which it appears, that the Levites did help the Priests in case of
necessity, if not to offer, yet at least to pull off the skins; which
pertained to the Priests office: as witnesses Nicolaus de Lyra, saying. Lyran.
in 2. Chron. c. 29. and in c. 35. consimiliter Abulensis in 2. Chron. cap. 4.
q. 13.
Although the pulling off of skins belonged to the office of the Priests; yet
the Levites might in this help the Priests in necessity. for many things were
lawful by reason of necessity, which otherwise were not lawful. If of
necessity: then by proportion a Deacon may so far intermeddle with the
Presbyters office. In which case of necessity, a Presbyter comes nearer to a
Bishop, then a Deacon to a Presbyter; which are of diverse Orders.


ANd is not this your own doctrine? Confirmation of the baptized is proper to
a Bishop; proceeding from the Episcopal Character as well as Ordination? and
yet may be communicated to a Presbyter in case of necessity?

Concerning the first, the Council of Trent has thus decreed. Council.
Trident. Sess. 23. Can. 7.
If any man shall say that Bishops are not superior to Priests; that they have
not power to confirm and ordain, or that the power which they have is common
to them with the Priests: let him be accursed. And Bellarmine says, that
Bellarm. de sacram. confirmat. c. 12.. 16. ad argum. 4.
the Episcopal Character, whether it be another from the Presbyteriall or the
same more extended, is an absolute, perfect and independent power, to confer
the Sacraments of Confirmation and Order.

Concerning the second, Bellarmine in his book of the Sacrament of
Confirmation, proves at large that Id. de sacram. confirm. cap. 12. sect. 3.
Extraordinaria potestate possunt. sect. 15. extruordinaria concessione possunt.
and lib. de Clericis. c. 15.. 29. Confirmare baptisatos possunt Presbyteri ex
dispensatione.
Presbyters may confirm by the Popes dispensation. And whereas in his book of
the Sacrament of Order, he had let a word fall, which might seem to sound to
the contrary; he explaineth himself in his Recognitions in this manner. Id. in
Recognit. page 89.
Whereas I said that only Bishops may confirm and ordain, and if inferiors
attempt to do those things they could effect nothing by ordinary powen: my
meaning was not to deny that, which elsewhere I had affirmed; that a Presbyter
might confirm by Apostolical dispensation.

PHILOD. Very true: for this he has proved by many testimonies, and among the
rest by the Council of Trent: which therefore calls a Bishop an ordinary
Minister of Confirmation; to insinuate, that it may be performed by a Presbyter
by extraordinary power.


ORTHOD. Then by Bellarmines own reason, when Pope Eugenius in his decree for
the Council of Flerence affirmed, that the ordinary minister of Ordination was
a Bishop; thereby insinuated, that extraordinarily it might be done by a
Presbyter.


PHILOD. To confirm is an act of Order; and this order is also in a Presbyter,
at least inchoate and imperfect. Wherefore unless it be perfected by
dispensation, a Presbyter effects nothing by confirming: but if it be
perfected; jam ex ipso suo charactere confirmabit, he shall confirm by virtue
of his own Character.


ORTHOD. If the Character thus perfected enable him to perform the act of
Confirmation; why not of Ordination? For the doctrine of your Church is, that
they both are proper to a Bishop; both derived from the same Character, both
received at the same instant, from the same persons, in the same manner, and by
the same words: and that the effect of both is, to imprint a character, and to
give the holy Ghost. Wherefore seeing you grant the power of Confirming is
communicable to Presbyters; you have no reason to deny them the like power of
Ordaining.


YOur own learned men hold, Presbyter, but also a Layman may confirm by the
Popes delegation. Vid. Praepositum in Decret. cap. Per. venit, did. 95.
The author of the Gloss says: Dicunt quidam etc. Some say that the Pope may
delegate this even to a Layman: because he has the fullness of power.
Videtur, says Rosellus de potestate Imperatoris and Papae. part 4 c. 16.
Rosellus, quod confirmatus etc. It seems that a man confirmed, though he be
a Layman, and not in orders, seeing he has received a Character by his
Confirmation, may give Character to another by the Popes mandate; because a Lay
man may handle even spiritual things by the Popes mandate: especially because
it was not specially appointed by Christ that only Bishops should confirm. And
that the most reverend Cardinal of Saba, seems to hold this opinion.
Moreover Compostella and Sylvester are of mind, that the Pope may commit these
things even to a Lay man. Hitherto Rosellus. But if you hold this to be a
private opinion: yet by Bellarmine and sundry others of your own side, it is
yielded that a Presbyter is capable of this commission.

So the Author of the Gloss. Vid. Gloss. ad ca. Manus, de Consecrat. did. 5.
verbo Irritum. and Panormitan. ad ca. Quanto. extra de Consuetud. number. 8.
Dico quod Papa potest hoc delegare simplici Sacerdoti, and non Laico (sicut
credo) and sic ex tali delegatione and adminiculo habiti sacramenti, potest
confer quicquid habet: imo quilibet Clericus hoc facere potest; qui vero non
habet, non potest confer. I say that the Pope may delegate this to a simple
Priest, and not to a Layman (as I suppose) and by the Popes delegation, and
help of the Sacrament which he has, he may confer whatsoever he has (and
therefore holy orders) yea every Clerk can do this thing: but he that has it
not, cannot confer.

And Rosellus. Volunt Doctores, Rosell. ut supra.
quod Papa potest committere cuilibet Clerico, ut conferat quae habet ipse: ut
si est Presbyter, possit ordinare Presbyterum, and diaconus diaconum, ex
mandato Papae. i. The Doctors are of opinion, that the Pope may commit to any
Clerk that he may confer these things which he himself has: as if he be a
presbyter, he may ordain a Presbyter, if he be a Deacon, he may make a Deacon,
at the Popes commandment. And again: Ego teneo, quod Papa possit demandare
Presbytero, quod conferat omnes sacros ordines: and in hoc sto cum sententia
Canonistarum. i. I hold, that the Pope may give commission to Presbyters to
confer all sacred orders: and in this I stand with the opinion of the
Canonists.

MOreover you hold the presence of three Bishops, See the first book, cap. 3.
as a substantial point in Episcopal Consecration; and thereupon urge a
Nullitie against the reformed Churches: accounting it an institution of the
Apostles, which they made, the Lord so appointing. Ibid. cap. 7.
Yet you allow of Pope Pelagius the first; who was consecrated only by two
Bishops and one Presbyter. Yea it is an usual thing in your Church, for one
Bishop with two Abbats to consecrate a Bishop, by the Popes dispensation. If
these things may be done by the dispensation of a Pope; much rather by the
overruling command of invincible Necessity.

For put case, all Bishops in the World were dead: should Ordination cease for
ever? Or if it should continue: by whom should it be performed?

PHILOD. If this should happen: then I would say with Armachanus. Armachan.
Sum. contra Armen. lib. 11. cap. 7. ut supra,. 11. (ubi cap. 7. reponend. pro
2.3.4.5.6.)
Videtur quod si omnes Episcopi essent defuncti; sacerdotes minores possent
Episcopos ordinare. i. It seems, that if all Bishops were dead, the lesser
Priests might ordain Bishops.


ORTHOD. But what if all the Bishops in the World were infected with Heresy,
and would ordain none, but those which would approve their Heresics: were it
not the like case?


PHILOD. These are curious Questions, and impossibilities. for the Church of
God, shall always be splendent and glorious; having Pastors conspicuous, as
the stars and lights of the World.


ORTHOD. The Sun and Moon are glorious and great lights, and yet they may be
not only clouded, but eclipsed. Where was this splendour in the days of Elias?
at the passion of Christ? or when the world did wonder to see it self become
Arrian? But if these cases seem impossibilities; I will propound one which is
very possible. Suppose a Spanish Armado, transporting men and women, and among
them one Priest, for the further plantation of the West Indies, being long
tossed with tempestuous winds, should at length suffer shipwreck upon a strange
Coast of an unknown Island; yet so, that most of the People by the providence
of God escape and come safely to the land. Now they are in another World, their
ship is sunk, their tackling gone, they are void of all means and hope of
return. The Priest he instructs them, baptiseth their Children, and perform
th other Priestly offices; still expecting if any ship should arrive or
approach to that Coast. Thus many years passing, their hopes fail, their
hearts faint, their aged Priest is even at deaths door: now tell me, what
shall he do? must he leave his congregation without a guide? the sheep of
Christ without a sheapheard? Alas, this were the plain pathway to Paganism.
Or shall he not rather make choice of some most eminent among them for
knowledge and virtue; and by fasting, prayer, and imposition of hands set them
a part for the Priests office?


PHILOD. I am loath to answer Vtopian cases: yet of this I am well assured,
that holy Church teaches according to the Council of Florence, that it is
lawful for a Layman or Woman, Infidel or Pagan, to baptize in case of
necessity; least the people should perish.


ORTHOD. Was not the right of Baptizing given by Christ's own Commission to the
Apostles and their Successors, that is, according to your own interpretation,
only to such as are in holy Orders? yet you allow it to Laymen, which have not
the character of Order, and to women which are not capable thereof. Now
consider advisedly with your self, if a Presbyter come not nearer to a Bishop
(seeing they are both one order) then a Pagan to a Presbyter. And with what
face can you affirm, that a Pagan may give that character which he has not;
and deny that a Presbyter may give that which he has? If you say that Baptism
is simply necessary by the ordinance of God, as a means of salvation: I may
not digress to handle that point. only this I say, that as your Church makes
Baptism necessary in respect of every particular man: so it makes Orders
simply necessary, in respect of the whole Church; teaching that without the
sacrament of Order there can be no Church, and without a Church no Salvation.
Wherefore, as you avouch that a Layman may baptize, least the people should
perish: so by the same reason you must avouch, that the Spanish Priest might
ordain, least the Church should perish.


PHILOD. IF it should be admitted in this imaginary case of the Spanish Priest:
Luther? Why should he presume to do it, when there was such store of Bishops?
Or why should any man be so new fangled, as to receive it other ways then in
former ages?


ORTHOD. We must consider the difference of times. For during the sway of
Popery, men being blinded with the darkness thereof, did ignorantly undertake
a corrupt calling: which, notwithstanding the corruption, did give them
authority to preach the truth; though as yet it was not revealed unto them. But
when the light had begun to shine and to discover, amongst other Popish
impurities, the abomination of your sacrificing Priesthood: they whose eyes
were opened to see the same, could not with a good Conscience receive
imposition of hands from your Bishops, because they would ordain none, but in
a Popish manner to a Popish Priesthood, and that with an oath to maintain the
Pope and his abuses. For otherwise neither Luther would have ordained, nor
learned men received ordination from him, or from any others but only from
Bishops. Which thing, (says Georg. Princeps Anhaltin. Concion, super Matthew. 7.
Prince Anhalt, we always, and M. Luther (of most godly memory) both in words
and in writings, yea and in public sermons in the Cathedral Church of
Maerspurge very often professed and promised. And again this inconvenience
(that Presbyters should ordain) might be prevented, if the parties to be
ordained were not compelled to promise the upholding of evident abuses. for
unless that were required at their hands, they would willingly receave
ordination from Bishops: which now they are constrained, by a certain
necessity, both to seek and receave from other Ministers.

And as they could not obtain ordination from your Popish Churches; so
neither, by the same reason, from the Greek Church. For Bellarm. lib. de notis
Ecclesiae, cap. 8.. 22.
Bellarmine denies it to be a Church: because they were lawfully convicted in
three full Counsels (at Lateran, Lions, and Florence) of heresy, and
especially of the heresy about the proceeding of the Holy Ghost; which to be a
manifest heresy (says he) both the Lutherans and the Calvinists do confess.
Wherefore seeing no Church will give orders, but only to such persons as
approve and embrace their doctrine; therefore they could not with a safe
conscience seek to the Greek Church; whose doctrine they justly misliked.

Being thus excluded from the Greek and the Latin, from the East and the West;
what should be done? It was the duty of Magistrates whose hearts the Lord had
touched, not to suffer false Prophets, but to drive them away like wolves, and
to plant godly Preachers in their places. But whence should they have them? The
Popish Priests converted were like a few clusters in a great vintage, or a few
mariners in a great ship. wherefore, either there must be a new supply, or the
ship of Christ must be endangered. And there was but one way for this supply;
to wit, by Ordination. Now the Bishops were so far from yielding it in any
tolerable manner; that they persecuted such as sought the reformation, and
branded them with schism and heresy. Wherefore it must either be devolved unto
Presbyters, or the Church of God must suffer most lamentable ruin and
desolation. And was not this a case of necessity? I will conclude this point,
with a memorable saying of Waldensis, worthy to be written in letters of gold.
Vbi ista duo concurrunt in communitate Ecclesia, scilicet extrema and non
ulterius differendo necessitas, and ordinarii pastoris aut praesidis ad
succurrendum desperata facultas; quaerendus est extraordinarius pater,
priusquam Christi Domini fabrica dissolvatur. Thom. Waldens. Doctrinal. fidei,
tom. 1. lib. 2. cap. 80.. 2.
When these two things do meet in the state of the Church; to wit, extreme
necessity admitting no delay, and the hopeless want of ability to yield
relief, in the ordinary Pastor or guide: we must seek an extraordinary
Father, before the fabric of the Lord Jesus be dissolved.


PHILOD. SVppose that ordination might be devolved to Presbyters in case of
necessity: necessity ceasing, such extraordinary courses should likewise cease.
Why then do they continue their former practice? why do they not now seek to
receave their orders from Protestant Bishops?


ORTHOD. The Churches of Germany need not to seek to foreign Bishops; because
they have Superintendents or Bishops among themselves. And as for other places,
which embrace the discipline of Geneva; they also have Bishops in effect. for
two things of all other are most proper to Bishops. 1. Singularity in
succeeding. because though there be many Presbyters in a Church, yet above the
rest there is one Star, one Angel; of whose unity depends the unity of the
Church: and therefore when he dies, another must succeed in the like
singularity. 2. Superiority in ordaining. because ever since the Apostles times
these Stars and Angels have been invested with the power of ordination;
which they might perform without Presbyters, but Presbyters might not
regularly perform without them. Now in these reformed Churches, the President
of each Presbytery is their Star or Angel, endued with both properties.

Concerning the first, Beza says. Bez. de diverse. gradib. mmistr. contr.
Sarav. cap. 23.. 25.
Essentiale fuit in eo de quo hic agimus, quod ex Dei ordinatione perpetua
necesse fuit, est, and erit; ut in Presbyterio quispiam and loco and dignitate
primus actioni gubernandae praesit, cum eo, quod ipsi divinitus attributum est,
jure. This was essential in the matter we have in hand; that by Gods
perpetual ordinance, it has been, is, and shall be needful, that some one
in the Presbytery, which is first both in place and dignity should have the
pre-eminence in ruling of every action, with that right which is given him from
God.

Therefore concerning the second. whereas the Presbytery consists partly of
Ministers, partly of Laymen; their Lay-presbyters are wholly excluded from
Ordination. for Non liquido constat, an quum aliquis consecrandas erat
minister, omnes soliti fuerunt manum imponere ejas capiti, an unus duntaxat,
loco and nomine omnium. Imo huc magis inclinat conjectura, unum tantum fuisse,
qui manut imponeret. Calvin. in 2. Tim. 1.6. Hoe postremo habendum est, non
universam multitudinem manus imposuisse suis ministris, sed solos Pastores. Id.
in Institut. l. b. 4. cap. 3.. 16.
Calvin teaches, that in the Apostolic times, only Pastors imposed hands:
neither is it lawful for every Pastor in the Presbytery to execute this
office; but it is reserved to him who is first both in place and dignity,
having pre-eminence in every action, and consequently in Ordination. Wherefore,
though that he do it not by his sole authority, but with common consent;
neither has the name of a Bishop, or such ample titles annexed, as godly
Princes have thought fit, for the honor of the place (because these things are
not suitable with popular estates, delighting in equality) yet he has the
substance of the office it self: which he exercises not in one only
particular parish, but in the City, Suburbs and the territories thereof,
containing sundry Parishes; as for example at Geneva, XXIIII, or there about.

Wherefore seeing a Bishop and a Presbyter do not differ in order, but only in
pre-eminence and jurisdiction, as your selves acknowledge; and seeing Calvin
and Beza had the order of Priesthood, which is the highest order in the Church
of God, and were lawfully chosen the one after the other to a place of
eminency, and endued with jurisdiction, derived unto them from the whole Church
wherein they lived: you cannot with reason deny them the substance of the
Episcopal office. And wherein soever their Discipline is defective, we wish
them, even in the bowels of Christ Jesus, by all possible means to redress
and reform it; and to conform themselves to the ancient custom of the Church
of Christ, which has continued from the Apostles time: that so they may remove
all opinion of singularity, and stop the mouth of malice it self.

Thus much concerning the Ministers of other reformed Churches: wherein if you
will not believe us, disputing for the lawfulness of their calling; yet you
must give us leave to believe God himself from heaven approving their
ministry, by pouring down a blessing upon their labors.

Bless them still, O Lord, and bless us: and make all our Ministry
faithful, fruitful, and effectual to the comfort of our own Consciences, the
advancing of thy Kingdom, the joy of thy little flock, and to the recalling of
those lost sheep, which as yet wander in the wilderness of the Church of
Rome, or elsewhere: that so it may be powerful by thy Spirit to the salvation
of many thousand souls.

AMEN.


FINIS.
