Englands Object: Or, Good and true News to all True-hearted Subjects, for the
taking and apprehending of that horrid deluding Sower of Sedition Hugh Peter's,
by the name of Thomson, in Southwarke, Saturday September the first: With his
Examination and Entertainment by the rest of the Rebellious crew now in the
Tower of London.
The tune is, Come hither my own sweet Duck.


COme let us triumph and be folly
brave Cavaleers every one,
For I have more News to tell ye
then any Diurnall can:
Hugh Peter's he is taken,
of a truth I tell to you,
The Rump is not forsaken,
to them he will preach anew.
Then hey ho, Hugh Peter's
cannot you find a Text.
To please your fellow Brethren,
they are so highly vexed.
This is the man was wanting
above this three months space,
And all the Rump lamenting
they could not see his face,
For he was deeply learned,
all which they very well knew,
But since he is returned
now Gallows claim thy due.
Then hey ho Hugh Peter's
cannot you quote a Text,
To please your holy Sisters
they are so highly vexed.
Now having so much leisure,
to tell what came to pass,
Concerning of his ceasure
and how he taken was.
In Southwarke side he lodged.
sometimes in Kentish Town:
From place to place he doged,
till publicly he was known.
Then hey ho Hugh Peter's
how like you now the Text
Methinks the Tower Quarters
have made you soundly vexed.
He strangely turned his name,
and Thomson he was called,
Or like a Countryman
in debts had bin inthral'd
He kept himself so close,
by crafty cunning charms,
Till apprehended was
by a Sergeant high at Arms.
Then hey ho Hugh Peter's
your wits did you deceive
To change your Surry quarters
and come with us to live.
Come Peter's I must tell you
your crafts beguild you now,
Sad fortune have befell you,
and all your joviall crew.
The Rump has got a sliding,
Hugh Peter's got a fall,
And Haslerig is chiding,
like the Devil amongst them all.
Then hey ho Hugh Peter's,
cannot you quote out a Text
To learn Sir Arthur patience
that is so highly vexed.


WHen to the Tower he came
as brethren used to do:
There met him Henry Vain,
both Scot and Mildmay to^:
Then he to preach a Sermon,
the Spirit did him call,
Drew forth an old Diurnal
and preached before them all:
Then hey ho Hugh Peter's
they liked your Doctrine well,
Which gave them such direction
how they should go to hell.
The next that came was a Rumper,
and cal^d great Haselrig,
I Will warrant ye he was a thumper
to dance a Parliament jigg:
He joyed to see his Chaplain,
and did congratulate
But never was such tatling,
concerning Church and State
As was between these creatures
I must tell to you
Sis Arthur and Hugh Peter's,
the Gallows claim his due.
Luke Robinson came after
the Parson for so view,
And asked if Sir Arthur
had heard his Sermon new,
Who said that he had quoted
a noble Rumping Text,
For which he should be Uoted
at Tyburn to preach next.
Then hey ho Hugh Peter's
my heart shall never rue
In such a worthy pention
Esquire Dun shall pay thy due
The Tower is strongly made
and Peter's he is within
I Am sure he had a hand
in martering of our King.
Now all will be disclosed
and brought to public view.
All that he be opposed
then Gallows claim thy due.
With hey ho Hugh Peter's
you are fast within our locks,
Therefore declare the persons
disguised in white Frocks.
These that had on long Uizards
did on the Scaffold stand
Like base presumptuous Wizards
placed by the Devils hand.
So expert and so even
was one it is thought 'twas you
The blow was fatal given
come Peter's tell me true.
Examine all your fellows
prove it perfectly
Or else on Tyburn Gallows
your neck shall hanged be.
Finis.
