CHOICE and RARE EXPERIMENTS IN PHYSIC AND SURGERY.
The Head, the remedies for its distempers. Headache.
Here follows the brief description of inward and outward diseases of the
body, with the most wholesome and expert Remedies for the Cure thereof. And first
of the sickness of the Head.

ANd it is to be noted, that the cure or remedy must be appropriated according
to the nature and cause of the grief, which if it be not rightly considered, it
would be but vain to apply any Medicine: and therefore the right judgment of
an expert Physician is very requisite and needful in such cases as you may
plainly conceive; for the multipli^ity or diversity of causes in some diseases,
makes the cure of more difficulty: as also the methodical way of applying the
same, in observation of the circumstances of the Patients age, constitution,
strength, sex and the like, which must of necessity be observed in the
administering or prescribing of all medicines, that should take effect perfectly
to cure, etc. And now Headache chances oftentimes of diverse and sundry causes,
as of blood, choler, phlegm or melancholy, or of ventosity, and sometime of heat
of the Sun, or of too great cold of the air.

If it come of blood; the Cephalic vain o^ the right arm is to be cut or
opened; if the pai^ continue, on the vain of the forehead on tha^ side the pain
is, then lay upon the place ^yl o^ Roses, Vinegar and Rose Water, or a bag
wit^ Roses, sprinkled with Rose Water.

And it is to be noted as well in this cause a^ all other, that if his belly be
hard and bound first ye must give him an easy Clyster, or else o^ Cassi^ newly
drawn out of the Cane, or some other easy Laxative to provoke the duty of the
Womb, else all applications of medicines will be nothing worth at all.

If the Headache proceed of Choler, there (...) sharp pain and heat, chiefly on
the right side o^ the Head.

Ye must give him morning and evening, (...) drink S^rup of Violets, with a
mean draught (...) Endive Water in a glass, or of Cummin wa^^^ s^dden and
cooled again: And instead of the Syrups you may drink water of Endive, Succ^ry,
Pu^slain and Nenup^ar mixed together, (...) one of them by himself, two or
three days at even and morn: Then give a dram of Pilulae sine quibus at night
to bedward, or about midnight, and the day following keep you i^ your chamber.
Instead of these Pills* it is good every morn to take an hour before Sun a
medicine to drink, that shall be made of half an ounce of Succo Rosarum, mixed
with two ounces of Endive water. Instead of the said Succo Rosarum ye may take
half an ounce of Dia prunis Laxative, and ye must take heed in giving such
purgations, that the patient be strong, for if he be weak, ye may give him but
half of the said pills or of the other Laxatives. And if in diminishing the
quantity of the said medicines it works not with the patient, as it should,
it is convenient to give him a common Clyster.

Another remedy for the same pain.
Ye must lay thereon a linen clothe moisted in Rose Water, Plantaine-water,
Morrel-water and Vinegar, or else take the juice of Lettice and Roses and a
little Vinegar, and warm it together, and dip therein a linen cloth, and lay
it to the pain.

For an extreme Heada^h.
Pound Euphorbium with Vinegar, and if the grief be on the right side of the
head, then ^ay it on the left, or on the right when the pain ^s on the left
side, for it mitigates all pain very excellently, but we must suffer the same
to continue thereon no longer then the space of saying a Pater Noster, and then
wash it off.

Another.
Take nine or ten pieces of Zeduaria being small, cut it in parcels, or else
pound it somewha^ grossly; infuse thereon clear water, and the^ put it into a
glass, and madesie clouts therei^ of the breadth of two fingers, and apply them
on the forhead and temples of the same, and the same being dried moisten them
again.

For burning Headache.
Take a handful of Houslick, beat it with woman's milk, and with a little
Rose Water, ti'^ it be like unto a poultis or pap, and therewit^ anoint your
head.

For shooting in the Head.
Pound Poppy-seed with yelks of eggs till (...) be like paste, and lay it on
the grief.

Against continual Headache, and singing of the Ears.
Beat Elder leaves and Rose-leaves, with o^ of Ivy-leaves one amongst the
other, and depress the juice thereout; tie these leaves o^ the head, and with
the juice thereof anoint the head.

For headache in the forepart.
Take Eldre leaves made hot between tw^ stones, and applied to the temples. And
for the better understanding of the sickness, chancing in the head, ye shall
know, that sometime it chances because of other diseased members, as of the
stomach, or of the mother, of the rheums of the Liver, or of the Spleen, and
not of any cause of the head it self; therefore ye ought to cure such sickness
by helping of the same members as shall be showed here following. And ye may
know that the headache c^m^th of diseases; of the stomach, when the patient has
great pain in the stomach; of the Mother, when the woman feels great pain in
her belly; of the reins, when there is a great pain in the back; of the Spleen
when he feels pain and heaviness under the left side; of the Liver when the
pain is on the right side, about the Liver which is beneath the ribs.

Remedies appropriate to the head of what cause soever the pain is.
Take a handful of Betony, an handful of Camomil, and an handful of Vervine
leaves picked, stamp them and seethe them in black wort, or in Ale for lack of
it, and in the latter end of the seething put to it a little Cummin braid, the
powder of a Harts-horne and the yelks of two eggs, and Saffron a little, stir
them well about, and lay a plaster hot over all his forehead and temples. This
is an excellent remedy also for the Megrim, it shall pi^rce the better if ye
add a little Vinegar.

Another.
Make a plaster of Bean flower, Lineseed, and oil of Camomile, or in lack of
it Goos^ grease or Ducks gre^se, and rub the place with Aqua vitae, and after
lay the plaster hot upon it.

Another.
Take Wormwood brayed well and boiled in water, and bind it to his temple upon
the grief: It will mitigate the pain and cause him to have a pleasant sleep.

Another.
Take a sp^onful of M^stardseed, and another of Bay berries make them in
powder, and stamp them with a handful of earth worm^ split and scraped from
their earth, and a little oil of Roses or of Camomile, or Capc^s grease, and
lay it to the grief.

Also it is good to take the juice of Ivy-leaves mixed with oil and Vinegar, and
so rub therewith your temples and your nostrils.

Pills for a^l pain of the head although inveterate.
Take Aloes epat. washed three ounce. Bryon* M^stic. elect ana. one ounce.
Diagrv^. h^ee drams.

Let it ^e consected with juice of Coleworts. The dose from two Scruples, even
unto four. It takes away all pain of the head, and rejoy^^th and comfort
the memory.

To remedy all manner of Headache and Megrim.
Camomile, Betony, Vervine leaves of each an handful, stamp them, seethe them
in white Wine or Ale, adding thereto pounded Cumminseed a little, three spoonful
of Vinegar, the yelkes of two Eggs and a little Saffron, fiat Emplastrum and
appona^ur fronti, etc. and sanabis.

A remedy teaching that one shall never feel Headache.
Take Pills of Aloes succotrine made in powder, and mixed with the juice of
Colewort^, the bigness of a Bean at a time.

For the Headache.
Take Wormwood and Camomile of each like much, one handful, and as much of
Maiden-wort, and a half penny w^rth of Cummin, and make it into powder and cast
it t^gether, and put it into a cloth of the breadth of a span, and warm it
against the fire, and then lay it to his head, etc.

For the Headache or Megrim.
Take Rosemary, Lavender flowers, winter Savory, Camomile, Bays and Lavender,
with both new and old Mintes and Fennil, seethe all these together in running
water, and put thereto a good handful of Bay Salt, then take some of the same
liquor, herbs and all, and wash your seet twice therewith every morn and even,
for the s^ace of four days; and in so doing it will take away any pain of the
head, although it be never so extreme or grievous. This has been proved.

Another.
Take Majerom-water, and hold your nose over it, and then draw your wind hard
unto ^ou, until such time as the wind has entered into your ^ose diverse
times, and your head will cease aching speedily.

For Dizziness in the head.
Take Pilulae Cochiae one ounce^, temper it with twenty drops of oil of
Anniseeds, and make seven pills of it, and swallow them and keep warm in your
Chamber till it have done working, then eat any warm broth, made of Veal,
Mutton, or Chicken, and comfortable Herbs. After this purge so used, this
Electua^y following.

Take Betony-flowers, and Rosemary-flowers, three ounces, powder of Carduus
benedictu^ leaves, powder of Marigold leaves one ounce, boil them with one
pound of beaten Sugar, and half a pint of Bugles-water, and Marjerom-water, and
Betony-water, and Balm-water of each two ounce, boil together over a gentle
fire to the thickness of honey, and use thereof as much as a Nut morning and
evening till it be spent* Probat. Chew every morning Cloves fasting, or whole
Mace, and use Coriander Comsits or the seeds prepared, and use after meat
Marmalade of Quinces to cl^se the stomach, and repress the vapors that fume up
thence to the brain.

For the Headache and ^o stop the rheum.
Dry Wheat-bran, and beaten Henbane seed, and put them in a bag, and lay them
warm to the nape of the neck.

To dry up and draw rheum out of the head.
A quilt made with Bay Salt, dry Sage and Cummin is good for the rheum to draw
it out and waste the humors, and in like case is the leaves and flowers of
Mustard Seed, bruised and so laid to the crown of the head.

To purge the head and preserve the sight.
Drink Beer every morning a good draught fasting, wherein the roots of Dog
fennel or Motherwort is steeped, the roots somewhat bruised, and it will
presently work in your eyes and head.

To expel a cold stomach or head, and to expel a Consumption or either of them.
Take a pint of white wine Vinegar, and half a pound of the best fine hard
Sugar, mix them and a head of Garlic trimmed clean, and bruised to mash, then
put them altogether into a pipkin and boil them softly till half be wasted, and
take thereof morning and evening a small quantity. It will help the cold, and
expel a consumption.

An oil to cure the cold Palsy and shaking Palsy.
Take a young cub Fox, case him and gut him, and chop him in pieces and boil
him in three gallons of water with a great handful of Her be-grace bruised, and
ever as the first scum arises scum it of, and cast it away, and all the rest
of the scum and fat which rises, scum into a fair glass as long as you can get
any, and cover the glass close and anoint the place with the said ointment
where the Palsy begins* and you shall be cured And to anoint the sha^ing
Palsy cures it in a short time.

For quaking hands.
Take Fennel, Rue, and Wheat-bran, seethe them in water and wash the hands
therewith, also to wash thy hands in Claret wine is excellent for the same,
being often proved.

For them which a^e speechles^ with the Palsy.
Take sharp Mustard and give it to drink in Ale or Beer warm; also Primrose
roots cut in slices, and a slice l^id under the tongue, will help in the like
case.

A precious water against many sicknesses.
Take Nutmeg, Cloves, Cresses-seed, Cubeb^ Maces: Grains, Ginger and Cinnamon,
of each alike much, and beat them to powder, and put them in white wine a
Limbeck, and distill them with a soft fire. This water drunk fasting helps
all cold sicknesses, puts away all diseases in the eyes and redness and
watering: It helps the Spleen, the Liver, the Fistu^a in the body, the
Palsy, the cold Gou^, the Palsy, with many other diseases, and much
comfort the stomach.

For the falling Sickness^
Take a good handful of single Piony, stamp them in a pottle of white wine,
having in it some Saffron within a cloth; then give three spoonful of this
three days before the change of the Moon and three days after the change, the
day of the change being not reckoned for one. Take three spoonfuls of this
three mor^ings, and three nights, press well the juice ou^ of the roots. Hang a
Piony root as near the heart as you can.

Another.
Take the weight of half a crown in silver, or half an ounce of red Fox Gloves,
and the like weight of Southernwood, let them lie twelve hours a steep in a
pint of Ale, then strain it, and give it blood warm first and last, do so for
three da^es together about the time of the Moon your fit com^th. If it be for a
chi^de, ^ pint may be given at four d^aughts, it makes the party sick but it
cures.

For the Falling sickness or disease near unto it.
Take one once of Piony root dried and finely beaten, and put it in a pint of
Ale ^r Beer or both, boil it and drink it morn and evening, an^ it will help
you. It is proved.

For the Falling sickness.
Take three nails made in the Vigil of Saint John Baptist, commonly called
Midsummer eve, drive them in the ground so deep, that they be not seen in the
place where the sick party fell, naming the parties name whiles it is in doing.
It will drive away the disease which Misaldus credibly reported.

A powder against the Falling sickness.
Take of Crystal prepared one dram. Of red Coral prepared two scruple^. Of
Pearl prepared one scruple. Of O^iental Smaragd prepared half a dram.

The half part of which is one dose in the water of our Ladies thistle.

Cae^ar accounted this for a great secre^, and with which men that were
somewhat aged, as also those which have been long subject to this disease after
purgation, were cured.

Zacutus Lufitanus wi^nesseth and reports, de Prax. Med. adm lib. observat.
20. that he has seen many, and also of great age, having this disease of the
Falling sickness, having tried many remedies, as well of an hidden as manifest
quality, which nothing profited or availed them, only with the syrup made of
the green leaves of Tobacco and honey, to have been cured, taking of the same
three ounces three hours after supper for forty days; if gree^ Tobacc^ (...)
wanting, dry of good note, or the best, may be used instead thereof.

Another excellent Remedy for the salling evil.
Take a good handfu^ of Piony roots, and a handful of Misselto that grows
upon a black^horn, and a handful of Polypodium, otherwise called in English
Oakefearn, and two good ^andful of Selendine, if it be possible it may ^e had,
and stamp them very well, and then ^et them to steep either in Ale or Beer for
the ^pace of two hours or more, and then put it in^o your earthen pot, where it
maybe kept close from any air, and let the party grieved drink a ^ood draught
thereof every morning fasting, and last in the evening, and let him use it for
^he space of fourteen or fifteen days, and by Gods help it will cure him in
short space.

Against the Epilepsie of Children.
Take Coriander prepared, M^stard-seed, Nutmegs of each half a dram, Piony-seed
seven ^rams, Diptamni two drams, make thereof a ^owder, and let it be given in
the morn with ^ot wine.

Another expert against the Epi^epsie.
Take red Co^al, the forepart of the skull of a man, of grains of Piony, of
each one ^ram, mix it and make a powder thereof, of which powder must be given
at three times, at morn, noon, and night with some broth or ^ome water
appropriated, and if it help not at once, then renew it in the same manner and
^ose as before.

It is found that many things have a natural virtue against the fa^li^g evi^,
not of any quality elemental, but by a si^gular property, or rather an
influence from heaven, which almighty God has given unto things here on earth,
as by these and other

Saphi^es, Smargdes, red Co^al, Piony, Misseltoe of the Oak taken in the Month
o^ March and the Moon d^cr^asing* Time, Savin, Dill and the stone found in the
belly of ^ young Swallow and others; these or one o^ them hang^d about the neck
of the child, saves and pr^serveth it from the said sickness.

Take ^he root of Piony, and make it in^o powder, and ^ive it the child to lick
in a little pap and Sugar.

They that are of age may eat of it a good quantity at once, and likewise of
the black seeds of the same Piony.

Item the purple Violets that creeps o^ the ground in gardens with a long
stalk, and i^ called in English Hear^s^ase, drunk in water o^ in water and
honey, helps this dis^ase in ^ young child: moreover the muskle of the Oak
rased and given in milk, and water and honey is good.

Also ye may still a water of the flowers of Linde, it is a tree call in Latin
Tilia, take the same flowers, and distill a water, and let the patient drink
thereof now and then a spoonful, it is a good remedy.

Item, the root of the Sea-thistle called Erigum in Latin, eaten in broth or
drunken, (...) exceeding good.

Some w^ite that Cichory is a singular remed^ for the same disease, it is meant
by wild Cichory growing in corns.

The flowers of Rose^ary ^ade a Conserve has the same effect in curing this
dis^ase.

I could declare many other r^m^dies commended of Authors, but these are
sufficient.

For the Falling sickness.
Take the skul of a dead man, which is cleanly taken out of the grave
pulverizate very s^all, add also hereunto five or six Piony kernels well
pounded, take hereof in the morn one d^am with wine, and it is for this disease
one of the best remedies.

An excellent Medicine sor the Apop^exia and Falling sickness.
Take Aqua vitae perfectly rectified without phlegm, one pint, oil of Vitriol

them as they grow cold, is excellent in th^s case.

let the party drink the ^owder in some posset ale, or such like drink.

For the stone.
Take white Saxifrage roots, Parsley, Pierstone, the Kernels of Ashen keys, of
each an handful, of Ringus roots two handful^, bruise them well in a Mortar,
and then boil them with si^ gallons of Ale or beerwort so long as wort is
usually boiled, then put all into a v^ssel, and when it shall be stale enough
drink every morning next your heart half an ale pint. This being very often or
every day taken, you shall never be troubled with the stone, though you had
been much troubled with it before.

A receipt for the stone used by Sir Trever Williams.
Take the quantity of a Walnut of the best Leaven and half so much of bay salt,
put them together in a pint of milk and stir them with a spoon until they
dissolve; Then let them stand covered all night, then strain it, and drink it
in the morning, fast one hour after and for that space keep your self walking.

To prevent the stone.
Take a penny pot worth of white wine, and put into it the quantity of a small
nut of the finest castle soap scraped very small, and then warm it a little by
the fire, and then drink it, and walk after it one hour, take this two days in
a week, or in a month as you find your self by your water.

To make a water for the stone.
In the Month of May, or in the beginning of June, when oxen go to grass, you
shall take of their dung not too fr^sh, nor too dry, which you shall distill
fair and softly, that it may not smell of the smoke, into some vessel* of
glass. Then take two or three Radish roots cut into small pieces, and put the
radishes so cut into a vial and fill it with greek or good white wine, or good
strong Malmesey, letting it stand in the sun close stopped all one day, and one
might; And then take one part of that wine, and two parts of the water of ox
dung, half a pint of Strawberry water, three or four drops of Lymons juice or
Citrous juice, and let there be of all half a glassful or somewhat more, into
the which you shall put a piece of Sugar to taste it withal, which Medicine
must be given in the morning and the patient must walk after it, you must also
incorporate inh^s water this powder following, or else this Medicine is of
small effect.

The powder for the stone:
Take the seeds of blew violets or march violets, and the seeds of common Burrs
with their ^ittle seed and all, or ripe burrs, put them to dry in a oven, for
else it will be hard to stamp them ^o powder, then stamp them with their seed.
^his done take a quick hare and strangle her that no drop of blood be lost,
with a strong lord, put him so whole or in pieces into an ^^arthen pot close
stopped, the feet, head, guts, skin and all, and so let the pot in a (...) that
the Hare may be burned to powder, and then stamp your Hare with your other two
powders of Burre and violets, and dry oaken leaves well beaten to powder four
ounces, of dry Saxifrage or of Sampier one pound beaten to powder, bay berries
five ounces Let all these things be well beaten to powder, sisted and well
mingled together. Give unto the patient so much as will lie upon a groat,
making him to drink it to his breakfast in the morning fasting, in white wine.
And let him do this o^t-times, Its the most exquis^test thing in the world: And
although both new as ^ell as old Physicians have very well traveled for this
disease of the stone and Strangury, yet this is the best and soveraignest thing
that can be given to a Christian man. Both the water going before, and this
powder must be applied as one medicine, so it seems that this powder may be
taken either in white wine, or in the aforesaid water, or in white wine mingled
with the said water, or in the said water without any white wine, which is
thought to be the best, the said water being accounted so precious for this
purpose, and of purpose distilled for this use as appears in the end of the
receipt of the said water.

Note Mr. Louth says, that the very blood (...) the Hare dried to powder and
drunk with white wine is excellent for the stone, and in red wine for women's
diseases for the superflui^^ of the flowers, Probat.

For the stone in the back, bladder, Kidneys and stomach.
Take the roots of Philipendula, that's to say the round knots thereof, gather
them after Lamma^ and grate them and take it in Ale, or white wine.

The cold diuretics are the best for the stone, when diuretics are to be used
for it or f^r any other obstructions of the Kidneys which are the four cold
seeds, the greater, Semen Alkakengi, radix graminis and acetosae. And therefore
is cited Valeseus who says that nothing is more excellent for the stone then
Vinum Alkakengi or the distilled water thereof, and to use the wine in winter,
and the water in summer, the branches and fruit of Alkakengi being in equal
portions mixed and then bruised and then put into the wine, which must be used
when the effect comes from a cold cause, And the reason is that the hot
diuretics, which are wont to be used against the stone do increase the hot
distemperature engendring the stone; And therefore what good the said hot
diuretics do one day, they do hurt another. And the cold diuretics are not
only good for the present evil but do also resist the efficient cause and do
stay the generation of the said stone.

Thus much out of Valeseus as aforesaid,

Whereby I gather that in a hot cause the water of the said Alkakengi is best
and fittest and to use the wine and ale, for he prescribes the win^ when the
effect proceeds from ^ cold cause, and also the wine in winter, and the water
in summer, which observe, whether the stone may proceed of a cold cause,
obstructions of slyme may, therefore for the stone the water is likely to do
best, the wine in winter may be good as he says, and for s^ime the wine may be
good or better, if cold slime without biting heat, but it seems the coldness
which he Commend^th i^ the coldness of the diuerticks; and if the ^ffect do
pr^ce^d from a cold, then the wine may do well ^r b^st wi^h it.

Als^ Mr. ^ogan in his chap^e^ of the p^eservati^^ (...) cu^^ of the stone in
the kidneys, and bladder, ^^th that the water of glamen or C^uchgras^ with a
little pure thin wine is a si^gula. M^dicine for that purpose, also he says
that win^ of Alkakengi, is a good preservative, or the fruit condited with
sugar. Thus much for the stone.

The Gout.
Remedies for the Gout.
THe pain in the joints of a man's body as in the hands and feet is generally
calle^ Arthritis or gout, which proceeds sometime of debili^y of the sinews
being las^t and unable to consume the humors that continually Flow unto them.

And for the most part they are derive^ from the member Mandant, that is to say
the brain, for he is very gross and engendret^ every humor in himself, by
reason whereo^ much of the said humors are derived into the Nuke and muscles
of the back, and from thence they descend into the feet or to the Hucklebone or
else into the hands.

Remedy.
And since all the said kinds come or are caused of one beginning, and for the
better expedition in that, we will be brief, ye shall first take away the
superfluous moisture of the brain, which is the root and fountain of all the
said diseases, and that ye may do four manner of ways. The first observance is
of diet inclining to dryness and to avoid all fullness of meat and drink, and
not to sleep in any wise after meat. And ye must beware that ye eat no vaporous
meats nor thin Wine, nor d^ink much after supper; And if perchance the pain be
very sharp it shall be wholesome to abstain from all kinds of wine, and ^o use
himself to small drink which thing if he cannot do, let him drink Claret wine
mixed with a good quantity of water.

The second is to purge the brain once a month with the one half of Pills of
Cochia and another half of Pills of Assajareth and in ^ime of harvest and of
summer with Pills (...) quibus and Pil. imperial. Whereof ye shall give one
dram the night before the full Moon, and the day following ye may give him to
eat little broth of Cicers, with a little quantity of raisins of the sun. The
third is to repress ^he sumes that ascend into the brain after ^eat, which
thing may be done by eating a ^^ttle dredge made of Aniseed and Coriander.

The fourth is to perfume the brain with cer^ain things comfortative as for
example thus. Take fine f^ankincense, Sandrach and Mastick, ^f every one an
ounce, of Lignum Aloes a d^^m, make them all in gross powder and perfum^
therewith stupes made of Flax or o^ Cotton and lay upon the head; And when ye^
have by this means well and duly comforted the brain and defended the original
cause o^ the said disease, ye shall proceed to take away the matter conjoynt
that is descended into the sinevves and ye shall begin thus.

First ye must preserve the body from in ^ gendring of humors, in taking every
morning next your heart a conserve made of Alcherine^ and of Flowers of
Rosemary mingled with ^ little Nutmeg and Mastick, and if ye be (...) power,
ye may drink a good draught o^ Ipocras or other spiced drink after meat^, (...)
dinner and at supper. Secondly ye shall understand that whosoever does intend
to be helped of the Gout, he must every year (...) purged two times, prepa^ing
first the matte^ to digestion with Syrup of Staecados and duobus radicibus with
the one half of waters of Sage primeroses and Marjerom in manner of spiced
^ulep with Cinnamon, taken five continua^ mornings, two hours after ye eat any
other meat, And after that ye must receive a dra^^ of pills called Arth^eticae
or Hormodactyl, or o^ both together equal portions, or take half (...) ounce,
of Diacarthami two hours after night and of Diaturbith, of every two drams
vvit^ a little Syrup of Hyssop.

The rest of the said curation, shall be accomplished with the applying of
diverse loca^ remedies, whereof there be sundry sorts her^ declared, ye ought to
rub the place that is sor^ with oil of roses and a little vinegar, and after
sprinkle upon the same, fine powder o^ Myrtles. Another plaster also as
hereafter follows,

A plaster for the gout.
Take the Emplaster called Melilot, two ounces, of Populeon, an ounce and an
half, red roses, myrtles and Flowers of Camomile, of every one a dram, make a
plaster and lay upon the gouty joint.

Another.
Take oil of roses, crumbs of bread, yelks of Eggs, and cowes milk with a little
Saffron, seethe them a little together, afterward spread them upon clouts, and
lay upon the sore.

Another.
Make Lie of the Ashes of Rosemary or of oak or of bean-stalks, and boil it in
sage, mol^in, prime rose, Camomile and Melilor, and receive the fume upon the
sore place, or wet clouts in the said decoction, and lay them upon the pain.

All the said Remedies are very good, to assuage the pain of the gout, after
the which done, it is good to go about the comforting of the joints and
sinews, and to that intent apply oil of Camomile, and of Althea or Holihock,
oil of a Fox, oil of earth worms, oil of primerose, turpentine, wherewithal or
with one or two of them, ye may anoint the sore place, and comfort both the
joints and sinews marvellously: also this ointment that follows, is singular
good for the same purpose.

T^ke five or six handfuls of Walwort, and seethe them well in wine, then strayn
them and with a little wax, oil of spick, and Aqua vit^ make an ointment,
wherewith ye must anoint the place morning and evening every day.

Medicines for the gout appropriate in all cases.
Take Cowes dung and seethe it in sweet milk, and lay a plaster to the gout
hot, also the yelks of eggs, woman's milk, lins^ed and Saffron, altogether in a
plaster swageth the diseases of the gout

And if ye be disposed to break the skin, and so let the humors issue, as by
such many one is eas^d ye shall make a plaster of b^ack soap and Aqua vitae,
which will blister it without any great pain. Also very old hard cheese cut and
sodden in the broth, of a gamon of bacon, and afterward stamped with a little
of the br^th and made in manner of a plaster, is a singular remedy for diseases
of the gout, and was first practiced by Galen the prince of all Physicians.

A Medicine to ease the gout and to bring down any swelling in feet, leg, ^r
arm.
Take a quart of milk from the Cow and crum into it a penny white Loaf and put
into (...) as much Dears suet as a pullets egg, and boil ^t to the thickness of
a pultis, and spread it w^ll and thick on a cloth, so broad as will cover the
g^ie and renew it once in twenty four hours, and if your pa^n cease not use it
so as long again, and it will cure the grief and draw out streaks o^ blood.
This medicine cured one in such extremity and pain of the gout, when he
continually crved, and could neither go nor ride; and never grieved since so
perfectly was he cured.

For l^gs swollen of any manner of disease.
Take pell^^ory and seethe it well in white Wine and wash the leg^ in the
water, and lay the Herbs about the L^gs plasterw^s^ and it will assuage within
five hours. P^obatum est.

To cure and ease the gout.
Apply to the gouty place, a pultiss made of barley and brooklemp hot in the
time of extremity and let it lie twenty four hours.

A pultis of barley to assuage swelling in the legs to mo^lifie the hardness,
Boil in a gallon of water, one quart of hulled barley very tender, and put
therein a good Allume stone, and being tender, drain the water from it, and to

daye^ togethe^ Probat.

Take Caro Costinum an ounce and dissolve (...) in white wine, and drink it
about half a pint and use the party as after a purge, and the effect is
wrought by purging, approved by many Gent.

A medicine for the Sciatica.
For a man take the urine of a man child^ and let it stand in some vessel for
nine daye^ and then separate the clear urine from the thick, and put it into a
vessel, and put to the clear urine a good quantity of the juice (...)
Cullerage, male Culrage, which has spotte^ leaves of a black color, and boil
it togethe^ till half be consumed, and it will be an ointment, with which
anoint the patient by the fire, and he shall be cured, which has been often
tried.

And for a woman take the urine of a femal^ child, and of the ^uice of Culrage
without spots and do as for the man.

An experienced medicine for the Sciatica.
Take Jvy, Mugwort, Wallwort and the Inner rind of an Elder tree, and seethe
them in fair water with a good quantity of salt, and bath the sore place well
therewith three or four times a day for the space of nine days together, and
doubtless this will cure it*

An excellent oil for an ache only to be made in the month of May, oil of
Rosemary Flowers.
Take a thin glass of a pottle, and fill the glass ^ull of Rosemary Flowers
very finely and purely picked, put no liquor at all thereto but the pure
Flowers only, and stop the glass very close that no air get therein, then set
the said glas^ in the sun against a wall out of the wind, and there let it

of Sallet oil, black soap of the bigness of a Wallnut, stir all together, take
it from the fire, put in your Linen first made fi^ for the place grieved, then
hang them on a string till it be cold. It will take away the pain and disease,
use it to any part of the body where the pain is, whether in the joints,
swellings, Sciatica, often proved upon my self* I will not leave the use of it
f^r gold.

For the apostume of the brain and swelling.
IN which cases the child cannot rest and is ever loath to have his head

child, in a cold apostume with the broth hot as may be suffered, but in a hot

plaster thus.

Take Fenugreek, Camomil, wormwood, of every one a handful, seethe them in a
close vessel till the third part be consumed, then stamp them in a mortar and
stir them, to the which ye shall put of the same broth again enough to make a
plaster wi^h a little bean flower, yelks of Eggs and Saffron, adding to them
fresh butter or ducks grease, sufficient, and apply it; in a cold matter let it
lie a day but in a hot cause ye must remove it every six hours.
