To the Honorable George Lord Hastings, Son to the Right Honorable
Theophilus, Earl of Huntingdon.
My Lord,
THat which amongst the many composures of this nature, can with the greatest
advantage, recommend this unto your Lordship, is that being little, it contains
much in that little, is both short and full, methodical in its connection, and
perspicuous in its brevity. And that your Lordship may perceive, how easy it
is upon these accounts both to be learned and remembered: let but a few of the
questions herein be asked, the answers thereto given, and a few more added upon
every repetition, and the profit thereof will be found sweetly mixed with a
speedy, pleasant, and happy progress. I need not tell the world of your
Lordships greatness, the Nobility of your birth, and early hopes, have done
that so much already; that all that is now necessary, is only to propound a
way for its confirmation. And s^rely there is no better foundation for the
support of Greatness than that of Religion, nor can that be better laid, than
by an early instruction in the true principles thereof: this being the training
up a child in the way that he should go. Prove. 22.6.
That your Lordship therefore may by such training, become an experienced, and
truly valiant Soldier of Jesus Christ, the great Captain of your Salvation,
and be both as great an Example of goodness your self, and as great an
Encourager of it in others, as any of your Noble Predecessors have been: is, as
the desire and design of your great Parent, so in an humble compliance with
them, the hearty Prayers, and as far as this may be assistant to you therein,
the earnest endeavor, of

Your Lordship's Most Humble Servant, J. D.
