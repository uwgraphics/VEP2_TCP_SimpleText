HIS EXCELLENCIES Letter of the 30 of January, 1643. TO THE EARL OF FORTH,
Upon that Letter sent to him from the Prince, Duke of York, and diverse Lords
and Gentlemen at Oxford.
My LORD,
I Received this day a Letter of the 29th of this instant from your Lordship,
and a Parchment subscribed by the Prince, Duke of York, diverse Lords and
Gentlemen. But it neither having address to the two Houses of Parliament, nor
therein there being any acknowledgement of them, I could not communicate it to
them.

My Lord, the maintenance of the Parliament of England, and of the privileges
thereof, is that for which we are all resolved to spend our blood, as being the
Foundation whereon all our laws and liberties are built.

I send your Lordship herewith a Nationall-covenant, solemnly entered into by
both the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and a Declaration passed by them
both together, with another Declaration of the Kingdom of Sco^tland. I rest,

Your Lordships humble servant, ESSEX.
Essex-house, Januar. 30. 1643.
Febru. 8. 1643.
IT is his Excellencies pleasure this Letter be forthwith printed.

Io. Baldwin, Secretary to his Excellency.

Printed at London for Laurence Baiklocke, at Temple Bar. Febr. 10. 1643:
