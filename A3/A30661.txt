ARTS In one BOOK of Jehovah Aelohim, COPIED out, and COMMENTED upon IN Created
Beings, Comprehended and discovered In the FULLNESS and PERFECTION OF
SCR^PTURE-KNOWLEDGES. The FIRST PART

By Francis Bampfield, A lover and admirer of Christ, and of His Word, and
Works.

Colossians 2. 3, 4, 8. In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge. And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, and after the
traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

Printed in the Year 1677.

THE SUMMARY CONTENTS OF THE First Part OF THIS TREATISE.
THe Design of this Treatise, Page 1 to page 18 Where the Emptiness,
Insufficiency, and vain affectation of Humane Wisdom, and Philosophic Science
is discovered, 1 to 8 And the shining Emanations of the Fullness and Perfections
of Scripture-knowledges are held forth, 8 to 18 The LORD Jesus Christ has
hiddenly laid up, all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, in his Word,
Wherein are many choice Mysteries above the reach, and besides the Rules of
Philosophy, 19 to 23 Here is shown, how a complete Minister of Christ should be
somewhat of an universal Artist, 19, 20 And how that, there are many truths in
the Word, necessary to be believed, which are contrary to the Principles of
Philosophy, 20, 21, 22 There is in the Word of Christ a full comprehensiveness,
at of all other useful Learning, and so particularly of the knowledge of
Natural things, of which it does treat and speak purposely and professedly,
Page 23 to page 45 Wherein is declared, that there are not only general, but
also the particular Rules in the Scripture, for the musical Science, 24 to 37
And for the Fabril. Art 37 to 41 As two instances out of many, called forth to
be a specimen of this Truth. With some further directions also, about Geograp^y
and Geographers; Grammarians, 42, 43, 44 There is much of spiritual use to be
made of the improved knowledge of Natural Things; For the discerning and
enjoying of fellowship with the Creator and Redeemer, 45 to 49 Here is shown,
how some of the most learned Philosop^ers have learned many Arts and Sciences
of irrational Creatures, 46, 47 And how many errors in Philosop^y, have
corrupted much of Theology, and of Christianity, 47, 48 The holy Scriptures in
speaking of the Works of the Creation, and of Natural Things, do speak of them
as they really are, and not as they seemingly only appear; according to
exactness of Truth* as the Nature and Essence of them are; and not according to
the wrong conceits, and ignorant mistakes of vulgar minds, and common
opinionists, Page 49 to p. 52 Where also this is cleared, that Scripture-words
are best expressive of created Works, 49 to 52 The vain affectation of Humane
Wisdom, which does thrust upon the credulity of so many a Doctrine of
Probabilities (concerning the Works of Creation and Natural Things:) from
Antichristian and unscriptural Philosphy, but is not according to Christ, and
to his Word, is such a deceitful way of false reasoning, as makes a prey of
Souls, and is carefully to be avoided. Philosophical Science is but falsely so
named, 52 to 57 The Vain-affectation of Creature knowledge, in the
Apostate^Angels, and of flumane Wisd^m in fallen man, has all along been
endeavoring to corrupt, and to pervert, both the pure Word of Aelohim, and his
Created Works; whereby they are misrepresented to the Rational Intellect in
wrong shapes, 57 to 62 Those Books which are commonly called Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, or the Books of Moses, and his Writings there,
have the approving testimony of those true, faithful Prophets that did follow
after him, as also of the LORD Jesus Christ himself, and of his Apostles. And
the History of the Creation, and of the Works thereof, in the beginning of the
Bible, is true in the literal sense, and was intended and recorded, so to be
understood. And all those Philosophical, Allegorical and Mystical senses, which
any do give thereof, that are contrary unto this, are to be avoided and
rejected, 62 to 66 An Inquiry about the Creator of the Works of Creation, on
the several^Days of the first Week of the World, 66 Q. Whether was the LORD
Jesus Christ Jehovah, as his Father is Jehovah, and as the Spirit of his
Holiness is Jehovah? Whether he were appointed by his Father, and anointed by
his Spirit to be one Mediator, the only LORD and Lawgiver? And whether he were
the Creator of all things, as the Father is Creator, and as the holy Spirit is
Creator, they the Creators? And whether is not this included in the first Words
of the holy Scriptures, Bereashith, baraa Aelohim? and in that word Jehovah,
who presently in the very next verse, after the short History of the Creation,
is said to be the Creator and Maker, Page 66 Here is held forth, the use of the
name Jehovah, 67, 68, 69 That the Father of Christ is Jehovah, 69 That the
Spirit of Christ's Holiness is Jehovah, 69, 70 That the LORD Jesus Christ is
Jehovah, 70 That this Jehovah is one Jehovah, 70, 71 That Christ is the
Mediator, 71, 72, 73 That Christ is the One Mediator, 73, 74 That Christ is the
LORD, 74, 75 That Christ is the Only LORD, 75 That Christ is the Lawgiver, 75,
76, 77 That Christ is the Only Lawgiver, 77 That Christ was appointed by his
Father and Anointed by his Spirit to these Offices, 77, 78, 79 That Jehovah
Aelohim was the Creator, 79 That the Father was the Creator, 79 That the holy
Spirit was the Creator, 80 That the LORD Jesus Christ was* Creator, 80, 81 That
the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, were the Creators, these three the Creating
One, 81 That much of these Mysteries concerning Christ are included in the
first words of the holy Scriptures, Bereashith, barraa Aelohim, and in that
word Jehovah, mentioned a little after the short History of the Creation, as
the Creator and Maker, 81, 82, 83 That there is an excellency in
Scripture-knowledge, which is proved by opening of some passages in the nine
first Chapters of the Proverbs of Solomon, relating unto this, 83 to 87
Of the one; (which when another Day was Created, was the First) Day of the
Created World, Page 87
Q. Whether this Earth at its first Creation were without form, and void? So
that Tohu and Bohu he truly and rightly praedicated of Aeretz? Or whether Tohu
and Bohu be not distinct Creatures from the Earth, locally distant, or two
created Places, the one setting out the gulphy, empty space, and the other, the
doleful place of Hell? Page 87 Here is shown, that this Earth was not Created a
formless, empty, mis^sh^^pen Lump, 87, 88 That Tohu and Bohu, or the gulphy,
empty Space, and the doleful place of Hell, are distinct Creatures from the
Earth, created places, locally distinct from it, 88, 89 That the North is the
highest part of the created World, 89 That this Earth is above the Water. And
that the middle part of this Earth, is not the common Center, to which all
heavy bodies do naturally descend, 89* 90, 91 Q. Whether that darkness, which
does distinguish and separate between the Night and the Day, in a large Day, be
but the want or privation of Light; and so mere nothing? And which was first,
the Darkness or the Light? 91 to 103 The discoveries here are, that Darkness
has a Created Being, and does truly subsist, 91, 92 That Created Light is a
mere accident, without; but that it has an essentiated substance, and has a
good perfect subsistence of its own, distinct from the Sun, 92, 134 That
Darkness and Light do make a natural large Day; which does begin at the
Evening. Wherein are diverse other useful things opened, about Evening,
Darkness, Night and Morning, Light, Day* Weeks, Months, Winter, Summer and
Years, Time, Minutes and Hours, 92 to 103
Concerning the Created Work of the Second Day.
Q. Whether all those upper Waters: (Such as Rain, Dew, Hail, Snow, and the
like:) between which and the lower Waters (comprehended under the name of Seas,
such as Springs, Fountains, Rivers, Lakes, and the like:) the out-spread, or
expanded does separately divide, do come down from above this Expanse? Or are
they caused in the Air, by some influencing operativeness of the Heavenly
Luminaries, upon the moistness and watriness here below, drawing up such
vapors from hence as do condeuse in the cold, middle Region of the Air, and
are there turned into those distilling drops, which come down here below?
Whether the Air be the proper place where the upper Waters are generated? 103
to 106 Here it is evidenced from the Word, that the Rain, (and such other upper
Waters:) is not generated by the Heavenly Luminaries: But that it does come
down from above this blew visible Expanse, 103, 104, 105
Concerning the Created Work of the Third Day.
Q. Whether the exactest, fullest Herbal of Herbs, Gras^, Trees and Plants, be
not treasured up in the Scriptures of Truth, opening this great secret of
Created Nature, best setting out the Doctrine and use of them, both for
Feeding, and for Healing? 106 The answer to this, does open much of the Nature,
Virtues, Uses, Kinds, Places, Cherishers, Hurters of Herbs, with much more of
their usefulness for man, both for Food and for Medicine. It does stir up
Physicians and Cooks to study the Herbal-Art more in a Scripture-way, in order
to the promoting of bodily health, 106 to 113
Of the Fourth Days Work.
Q. Whether the Celestial Phenomenon Of the glorious Luminaries, can ever be
reduced to any certain satisfactory Art, or improved into an advanced resta^red
Science, by vain Philosophy? Or must this be attained only by
Scripture-discovery, in its pursued Light and followed Directions? 113 It is
here made manifest, that vain Philosophy can never teach this; it is only
learned in the Scriptural-School, 113, 114, 115 That the Scriptures do condemn
Judiciary Astrology, as it is commonly understood and practiced to be
Groundless, Scriptureless, Natureless, Superstitious, Vain and Sinful, 115 to
124 That the Sun is not the Center of the World, 124, 125 That the Moon is
really in its Created Being a great Light, 125 That Eclipses of the Sun and
Moon have not the proper true causes of them, assigned by Philosophers, 125,
126 That Earth and Seas are not in the Moon, Page 126
Of the Fifth Days Work.
Q. Whether that part of Natural History, which does concern Fowls, Fishes,
Beasts and Worms, can ever be completed into a Natural Art, in the way of
Ethnic Philosophy? Or must we search after it, only in the Word of Truth;
where only it can be advanced and perfected by a due and diligent comparing of
their Created Beings in their proper Natures, 127 Here is demonstrated, that
this natural Art, is not found in the way of Ethnic Philosophy; and that the
Word of Truth alone can advance and perfect this Natural History, 127 to 135
That Art rightly discovered, is but Nature truly opened, 127 That the
Mother-tongued-Hebrew, should not be sent to Daughter-Languages, to learn to
speak, 128 That there was not a first prae-existent Matter, out of which all
other Creatures were made, 128, 129, 130, 131 That Matter and Motion are not
the Essences of things 130 That all and every of the Creatures, were immediate
distinct Works of Aelohim's Power, 128 to 131 That the Creator has assigned
his Creatures, to their proper Localities, 131 That the World was not from
Eternity, but had a beginning, 131, 132 That Time, Place and Number, are not of
the Nature of different things, particularly as applied to worship, 131, 132
That the LORD in Scripture and Nature has determined the circumstances of
worship, 132, 133 That some Scripture History is also Prophetical and
Promissory, 134, 135 That it is worthy of further inquiry, whether Vau be
conversive of the Praeterit into the Future, or of the Future into the
Praeterit? 134, 135 That Jehovah Aelohim is still putting forth continued acts
of preferring, and of blessing his Creatures, 134, 135 That the first Created
Light is a Substance, truly subsisting in it self, and in its Created Nature,
134, see also 92 That Beasts and Worms do belong to the Creatien work of the
Sixth day: And that the gathering in of the lower Waters into the Seas was a
part of the Creators Work on the Second Day, 134, 135
Concerning the Created Work of the Sixth Day.
Q. Whether Anthropology, or the Doctrine of Created Adam, or the knowledge of
Man, or the Science of the Humane Nature, be sufficiently taught in the Schools
and Lectures of Ethnic Philosophers? Or is it only contained in, and
augmentable and re^staurable by, the Word of Truth, and the holy Spirits
teaching of serious inquiries, this Art, according to those holy Scriptures?
136 The discovery here is, that Anthropology, or the Doctrine of Created Adam,
or the knowledge of Man, or the Science of the Humane Nature is not
sufficiently taught by Ethnic Philosophy* and the Readers or Writers of it:
but by the Scriptures of Truth, and the holy Spirits instructing in and hy the
Scriptures, 136 to 158 That man's make is admirable, 136, 137 That no mere
Creature made man; but he had his Being distinct from other Creatures
immediately, by and from Aelohim 136, 137 That Man was Created with the Image
and Likeness of Aelohim upon him, 136, 137 That the Female was Created distinct
from the Male; and but one Female was appointed for one Male in Marriage; at
the Beginning, where is also discovered the sinfulness of Polygamy, and of
Divorce, 138 to 148 That it deserves a further inquiry, whether, wherever
this Word, Adam, is found in the Original, it should not be rendered Adam, when
translated into other Languages? 148, 149 Also, whether the fruitful
propagating of Mankind by conjugal Generation, be not still a Fruit and effect
of Aelohim's first Blessing upon Adam and Eve? 149 Also, whether Faith in the
Creating Mashiach, have not foundation in Created Nature? 149, 150 And whether
clean Beasts and Cattle were not appointed and prepared as food for Adam, at
the beginning, as well as Herbs and Fruits? Page 150, 151 That Prayer should
^egin, and praise should end, our Meals, 151 That Adam, Male and Female, were
the proper peculiar work of the Sixth Day, 151 That Man should be much in
self-examination, 151, 152 That it does call for further and deeper inquiry
yet, what the distinct special Essences, operations, offices, products, and
specifical differences of the Body, Soul and Spirit in Man are; with much more
about this Subject Matter, 152 to 158 That the knowledge of our selves, as to
our Humane Nature in our Natural, Spirial, and Eternal Estate, is useful and
necessary, 152 to 158 That Man Science is a very spreading and fruitful, and
profitable Science, 152 to 155 That the Medicional Art, sought after in Ethnic
Philosophy, is but conjectural, and very deficient, 155 to 158 That the
Medicinal Art cannot be promoted and perfected but only in Scripture way; of
which there are diverse demonstrative evidence, both as to diseases of the Body,
of the Soul, of the Spirit; and as to the conservation of Health, and
prolongation of Life, 155 to 158 That there is an Emphatick Note of
Demonstration prefixed to the Sixth Day, to point out the
immediately-next-succeding Day, the Seventh, which is the last Day of the Week,
as their weekly Sabbath Day, 158, 159 Inquiries for the promoting and improving
of experimental Christianity are propounded unto the Ingeniosi and Virtuosi in
Religion, 160 to 171
The Ingenuous Reader is earnestly desired to correct the Errors in printing,
especially those, that do much disturb the sense, and quite alter the meaning.
Errors in the Margin are thus to be corrected.

seek and search after, that they may understand and find it, and it may enter
into their heart, and be pleasant unto their soul. The Scriptures of Truth are
a perfect Library of all saving Knowledge, and profitable Science, copied out
and commented upon in created Nature, else the Title of this Treatise would be
too high and great a design for so low and mean an undertaker: but Isai. 42. 3.

, which is the vain affectation of humane wisdom, (under which description and
notion I do declare against it throughout this Tractat, this) is falling, and
shall fall low, and utterly fail, and quite vanish before him, and before that
Word of his; growing Believers will have such Spiritual discerning, as no
longer to be despoiled, or to be carried away as captives for a prey by it, the
seducing Artifices of it shall be discovered and avoided; for they are not
according to Christ 1 Cor. 2. 1, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15. (...).
, the seeming wisdom of its swelling words, is but the excrescent part of a
swelling ulcer, though it carry a garnished show of excellency of Speech, it is
but humane wisdom, the enticing wisdom of men, the wisdom of the corrupt age,
though much admired by the great ones of the times; what is this, to the Wisdom
of God, to that Wisdom which the Holy Spirit teaches?

The restoration of Arts, and the advancement of Sciences has been the
studious research, and the unwearied endeavor of some, both Ancient and Modern
Writers, men of name for Learning; but, whilst they dig for it in some grounds
of their own, and under notions from within themselves, and so would proceed
Masters of Arts, and commence Doctors of Sciences, by the natural Abilities and

probabilities, a color and shadow of conjectural reasoning, such as would
perswadingly mislead souls by deceitful disputings, and falacious concludings,
and subdolous circumventings, imposing of mistakes upon the ignorant and
undiscerning, thrusting of errors upon them by captious arguings, and
shiftingly evading the evident force of the most convincing demonstrations, by
misapplyed distinctions, which do endlesly engage contentious Wits in a
scholastic warring, and vain jangling: the Press still keeps fighting by
sending forth one Book of controverted matter against another, yet are there no
Trophies of any considerable proficiency and progress all this while, either by
victoriousness over Error, or by triumphingness of Truth; whereas, there would
soon be a more amicable league, a more pacifick confederacy amongst the sound
and sober of men of depth of Learning, and of inquiringness of Spirit, if all
their Books were either apt significant Commentaries upon the holy Scriptures,
or due right interpretations of created Beings according to those Scriptures.
That Light, which the unscriptural, antiscriptural writings of Philosophizing
men have afforded us, has been to manifest this unto us, what erring, wandering
by-ways we would turn aside from, not what even, straight paths we should walk
in: much of that knowledge, which such have themselves attained unto, and which
they would have others to be wrong led into by following of them, is this, that
there is no certainty of knowledge, nor satisfactoriness of understanding
thoroughly compassable by any or all mere humane disquisitions and discoveries,
so that many of the most eminent of them are self-condemned, and have
pronounced the sentence against their own inventions, and against themselves,
for those merely humane excogitates, in the Judicatory Courts of their own
Intellect and Conscience, and have thereby openly renounced and quitted their
former usurped Authority, by which they too long, and too much imposed upon the
over-credulity of blinded minds. But what, shall such a traditionary receiving
of corrupt notions never have an end put unto it? shall the opinionative
conceits, and the conjectural ratiocinations of deceived deceiving men be still
handed down from one to another? Such Methods of Arts, and Systems of Sciences,
and forms of Learning, and Schemes of Knowledges, as are besides and against
the word of Aelobim, are either not according to Truth, and so they teach that
falsehood which would be unlearned, or do not direct to usefulness, and so they
cause loss by misspent time, which is not so soon redeemed. Their Science is

erring in Theory, failing in practice, fruitless in experience, after much

vain foolish man would be setting up a new imaginary world of Artals, and of
Scientificks, which are his own formed Ideas, and speculated conceits, and
modelled opinionativeness, and then would not only make an Idol of self to fall
down before its own misshapen Image, and to fail in love with its own empty
shadow, but would also set it up before others, that they may worship it too,
which has been for so many ages of the world, the grand design, and the too far
prevailing attempt of Enthusiastic Phantasms, of Humane Magistralities, of
self-weaved Ratiocinations, of forced Extractions, of indulged Sensations, and
of unsetling Scepticisms, which six have laid some of the most claim to the
highest advance of Humane Learning, though their Arts and Sciences have been
hitherto so far from being really in their nature, or use liberal, that they
have been some of the most tyrannous enslavers of men's judgments, and
imprisoning fetters of their understanding. How many thousands have by their
wandering after such misguiders left and lost their way in the dark, where their
Souls have been filled with troublesome doubts, and with tormenting fears,
exposing them to violent temptations of Atheism and Unbelief? and what wonder,
that it is thus with the Scholar, when some of the learnedest of the Masters
themselves have resolved upon this, as the conclusion of all their knowledge,
that, All things are matter of doubtful questionings, and are intricated with
knotty difficulties, and do pass into amazing uncertainties, and resolve into
cosmical suspicions? And this, not only is the deliberate Judgment of
particular Virtuoso's in our day, but has been the public determination of an
whole University, if there be truth in those Historical Records, that do report
them to us; even with those has it thus been so, who made proficiencie in Arts,
and progress in Sciences, to be the subject of their profession, the matter of
their inquiry, and the design of their studiousness. How manifold the
inconveniences? how mischievous the effects of this have been, if the Readers
Spirit would not be exasperated thereby, might be soon enlarged upon; for the
Writer would not provoke or inrage men's passions, but would come in words of
truth, and of soundness to hold forth a Scripture Light before such as are of a
temperate and sober understanding, and of a serious considering spirit: The
hurt that has been done to my own soul, and the scars that are visibly upon me,
by my ill-chosen-studies, and misemployed hours heretofore, though in a way of
some diligence, do stir up some compassions in me toward others, to endeavor
the preventing or curing of the like spreading distemper in their
understandings, the infectiousness of which disease in men's intellects, has
been hitherto little suspected, and its dangerousness less felt: And therefore,
if in faithful plainness, I do oppose paganish or Ethnic Philosophy; let it be
once more remembered, that wherever this expression is found, or such other
words relating to the same matter in this Treatise, I mean thereby, that vainly
affected humane wisdom, which was invented by Pagans, by Heathens, (or by
Satan, who taught it unto such) by such as had not the sound saving knowledge
of Jehovah Aelohim, or of His word; but did write besides it, and
contradictorily to it, and so far as this kind of Philosophy is still retained
and defended by any Christians; For, this is that which has so anticipated men's
minds, with such corrupt principles as are complying with profane practices,
with such misshapen notions as are suited to carnal reason, with such wrong
opinions as do plead for depraved Customs, with such flattering persuasions as
are humouring to sensual affections; it does so infect and sicken their
intellect, so weaken and make it Consumptive, that, who can cure it, if the
LORD Christ himself be not actually the one and the only All-skilful Physician,
and if Scripture-Learning be not seasonably well applied, as the one and the
only universal remedy of this of the mind? whilst some do write and others do
read so many expositions upon paganish Philosophy, and do so little study the
Scriptures of Truth; the Press may bring forth many curiously arted Books, but
there will be in the intellectual World a famme of Progressive Literature: The
frequent Divertisements by such unfruitful Studies are so many, and so tedious
(for, they make art to be long, and Life to be short; whereas Word-Study and
Scripture-Learning would make Art short and Life long) that those who do waste
their precious time in these worthless labors, do find the prime of their day,
and the vigorousness of their age even decaying and dying away, before they
know aright what to know, and how to live: Some who have had that University
honor put upon them to be called Masters of Arts, yet have afterward
experienced, that they had little else but the name, and have looked upon those
years (as the corrupted education then was) to have been the void space of
their life, which would have been the choice season of their time, if Tutors
had put them in a right way of Scriptural Learning. One of the skilfullest
advancers of Humane Learning, in one of the most labored and best wrought
Treatises upon that Subject, has in the close of his Book given a short
prospect of a new world of Sciences, or the deficients of them, fifty in
number; and he that shall make use of his Directory to attain these, yet would,
though he lived to old age, bring in an ignoramus for the Verdict when he comes
to die: Whereas, all those and more, so far as they are necessary and useful,
might have a clearer discovery, and a fuller supplement in Scripture, and in
Nature according to Scripture, were it thoroughly searched into for that end. If
Heathenish Philosophy did not strangely bewitch and awe young Scholars, with a
respect of the Authority, and a greatning of the names of its Authors, and an
esteem of the multitude of its Books, which do so fill the Shops and Libraries,
and with the difficulty of making many of its notions and distinctions, and
obscure terms reconciled to some degree of intelligent sense, after so much
dispending of Time and of Coin, its price would fall in the Printers Market,
and its trade go down in the Booksellers Shop. How little can there be of
certitude in that way, where all must resolve into fallibleness of Authority,
and falaciousness of Testimony, or into pretended evidence of forced
experiments, which may be variously effected, whilst the intrinsic Natures and
genuine causalities of created Beings, and of their products are altogether
hidden from such great adorers of Humane Wisdom as count themselves, and would
be so esteemed by others, to be, if not the only, yet the mostly learned men in
the world; and who would have their dictates to be received as inerring, and
their traditions as incontrolable; whereas their assertions do end in
doubtfulnesses, and their stating of questions is not definitively
demonstrating, but still the judgment of the pondering Reader must suspend it
self, and look further for satisfaction. How many Essences and verities are
there which Ethnic Philosophy cannot reach; the clear understanding whereof it
can never attain unto of its self, neither are they any other way fully
discovered unto us but by the Scripture revelation? What meer^ Philosopher by
all his art and industry can with certitude inform my understanding, what the
System of the created World is? how it was made and set up? what the positure
of the whole Creation is? in what place and order every thing is? which is the
uppermost, and what the lowermost part of it? what there is above this blew
visible expanse, or extended Heaven, or firm out-spread? what kind of
existencies the Heavenly Luminaries are? what all the constitutive parts of men
are, particularly what the spirit of man is, what his soul is, and how these
are distinct, and whether separable, so as that yet both may live apart from
each other at the same time? what the proper seats of the intellect faculties

open before the all-seeing Jehovah, yet are they far out of sight, and off
from the knowledge of men on Earth, by any mere humane disquisition or
discovery: Who of these Philosophers can by their own natural ability thoroughly
convince me, of the true Doctrine, and of the real nature of invisibles, which
yet, now they are revealed, are not incredibles? Can any of them return a
satisfactory answer to those questions which the LORD propounded unto Joh 38.

Job? Do not they themselves judge diverse things to be undiscoverable by any
mere man, as the essential forms, and the true differences of things,
especially that of man? What are all and every of the proper and real causes,
which are so productive of so many wonderful effects in the World? How
defectively imperfect? how unsetledly conjectural, are their inquiries
concerning the Celestial Bodies, about their Spheres, their Orbs, their diverse
Poles, their first Moveable, their contrary motion of Renitencie, their
Circles, Eccentricks and Epicycles, Interstellare Substances, Progressions,
Stations, Retrogradations, Elevations, Declinations, Apogees, Perigees, Diurnal
Motions, which some do fancy of the whole Heavens, and others do dream of the
whole Earth, with a multitude of such like Astronomical Suppositions, which
they would ground upon some Phenomenon, cunningly devising how to defend their
own invented Hypotheses against Objections, and setting up such feigned
Fabrics as may not be exposed to so many exceptions and contradictions, as the
fictitious conceits of others before them are liable unto? So that, they have
been forward to triumph over others, if their own excogitated opinions have not
been confutable by the common received principles, whilst themselves do not
believe their own suppositions to be the true nature of the things themselves?
how then can they persuade others, that their discoveries are real and
profitable? and that they might hold the World yet further on in ignorance, and
in darkness, they daringly affirm the Scriptures not to afford light in these
matters: Whereas, these alone can set men's understandings right about the
verity of beings, which cannot by all a man's diligence any other way be solidly
known. Wise men amongst themselves do now begin to wonder, that they suffered
themselves to be so abused by those Dictators in Sciences; they complain, that
there are secrets in Nature, hiddennesses in Truths, implications in Causes;
that there is much darkness upon their Mind, blindness upon their Intellect,
weakness in their Understanding; that their Knowledge is but Folly, their
Powers are impotent, their abilities insufficient, and their researches
shallow; thus they fall into suspicion, and grow into dislike of themselves,
concluding an utter impossibility in Humane Arts; seeing there are so many
unknown subtilties in Nature, which do escape their senses, and so many
mistakings by senses, which do not come under their cognizance: They
acknowledge at last, that to consummate the Arts, and to perfect the Sciences
inquired after, is above their strength, and beyond their hopes, and they
professingly declared, that they will affirm nothing; subtilty is their
Science, and fallacy is their Faculty: How many questions might be asked of the
most Learned of them, concerning the most plain and familiar things, such as
are most obvious and exposed to the outer senses, about Seeing, Hearing,
Smelling, Tasting, Feeling, which would puzzle them, and amaze their
Understanding? were all the witty Ingenioso's, and generous Virtuoso's of the
World colledged, and incoporated into one Philosophic Society; all their
extra-Scriptural disquisitions would never reach or hit what they say they aim
at, because they use not, improve not the adapted mediums to come at it: It
would have been more wisdom in such bold undertakers to be Instancers of
Learning, if they had either laid aside their attempt, or pointed to a directer
course, and to a righter way; for by an ill unadvised managing of the inquiry,
the inner Rooms of Learning are still locked up, and her Treasures are not
disclosed. If the Reader marvel why one of so little Philosophical Learning,
and of so much worldly despisedness, will adventure in such a day to be so open
a redarguer of the whole Philosophic World; let him know, that the
Scripture-cause will conqueringly plead it self, and its advocate has
sufficient security, that the Glory will be his, who is the Author of so full a
word: Let the Writer and his Treatise decrease into a nothing, as to this; and
let Jehovah and his word increase into an All; whilst the Traditionary Learning
of these men, which is but the credulous receiving of a false report, and their
sensitive learning, which is often the wrong information of equivocating
witnesses, and their experimental Learning, which is usually the hasty
observation of indagators, and of casual inventers; these shall blush and
vanish, be gone, and ashamed to show their faces, which so long have been set
out to sale under the gaudy Titles of Natural History, restored Sciences, and
instaured Philosophy; but leaving the buyer sick of his bargain, and crying
out, That he has all this while been overreached and defrauded, imposed upon,
and insulted over, by those who themselves at length do judge this to be a case
plainly desperate, as not knowing how to extract the real truth of things, or
which way so to separate all mistakes, that they may at last be brought to
somewhat, which is wholly free from error; and so, natural Beings may open
themselves, and disclose their inside, in their primordial Virtues, and
concealed excellencies. The whole of the doctrine of the unseen World, is
altogether undiscoverable by any lawful means, but only the word Revelation;
and therefore it is, that Coloss. 2. 8, 18. (...).
Paul does condemn that Philosophy, as a vain deception, which would obtrude
upon its Disciples, a belief of those things it has not seen, making its own
excogitates to be Oracles, when its own fantastic opinions are built upon no
other foundation, than the feigned Placents of humane imagination. It would
take away the Prize that belongs to the profiting Disciples in Christ's School,
and give it unto those, that run in the by-race of paganish Studies: thus
arrogating unto its self an usurped power of judging and of defining, who are
the most learned and skilful; it does thrust it self into a pretended knowledge
of such secret hidden things, whereof it is altogether ignorant, as if it were
its own proper possession: my task is to direct the Spiritual man, unto that
perfect Word, where he may get deep into the profoundest Mysteries of Religion,
and of Reason, of Grace and of Nature; where a clear-eyed-Faith may satisfy it
self with self-evidencing verities. I am no investigator of new fictitious
humane knowledges, but would engage others to be educers of old sound
Scripture-Learning, which has been so long veiled with Philosophical darkness,
and neglected by Sophistical prejudice. Shall we any longer walk on in the
circular tract of feigned Arts, and of corrupted Sciences by Humane Authors,
who write one after, and of another according to the-bad Copy set before them,
saying over and over the same falsified things, putting only a new name to an
old Stuff, whilst they make little or no progress, because they do not follow
on in a straight line of edifying knowledge? How far are they from having
already said, all that can be said, though one of them has grossly flattered
himself by applying of that expression to his own Writings? Truth and Goodness
have mutual influence upon, and friendly fellowship with each other; and how
then can Humane Arts, and Philosophical Sciences approve themselves good unto
the Will, till they prove themselves true to the Understanding of rational
Creatures? let no man 1 Cor. 3. 18, 19, 20, 21. (...).
seduce himself! we are, at least we should be, so far true and kind unto our
selves, as not to deceive our selves: What? shall we deal with our selves as a
false Thief does deal with a silly Traveller, offering himself readily to be a
guide to direct him a better and righter way to his journies end, till he
mislead him into some dark and dismal place, that there he may rob and spoil
him of his Treasure? such are wrong guides in the way of our Study: It any man
thinks, that he is wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
wise; for, the wisdom of this World is foolishness with God; the LORD knows
the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain; therefore let no man glory in
men. No Tutor is like unto that Spirit, who is the LORD, informing humble
Disciples of the Book of his Word, and of his Works: Useful Arts, and
profitable Sciences have their legitimation in his Word, and their
naturalization in his Works: Here the mind of man is at once both enlightened
and sanctified, informed and satisfied; whereas Academick Scepticisms do make
their apprehensions to be but appearances, and their propositions to be but
probabilities, till he that is of an inquiring spirit, sees he has fed but upon
empty notions, and so is discouraged into a desponding fullenness, and does
yield to overcoming difficulties. Whilst our own unsteddy, unskilful hands
will be drawing out Lines of Arts without a Scripture-rule, and our Circles of
Sciences without a word Compass; there will be much crookedness and unequal
distance therein, and the discovery which we make unto others, will be that of
our own weakness and indiscretion. How provoking and daring is this pride in
fallen follyful man, which would still keep alive so vain an imagination, as if
by Humane Invention it could equalize infinite Wisdom, put forth in Scriptures
Science, and in Natures Art? Many of the Philosophers postulata, which they
would have us unquestioningly to suppose, and to take for granted to be evident
Truths of undoubted certitude, are manifestly false, though they would exempt
their principles from contrary arguing, as if all were well agreed here, and
this Philosophic Faith must not be disputed; and yet these blind guides would
have the leading of us by the hand, till we pass into their darkness, and fall
into their ditch. What do the most of Philosophical Disputations rush into, but
a mere smokie skirmish of hard words, which do both cloud the Understanding,
and ensnare the Judgment? Men's minds are already but too much crookedly set by
the corruptions of their own depraved hearts; but, when they are further
wrested by wrying terms of Humane Arts, they are with much the more difficulty,
if ever, set right. Thus have men sought Sciences in their own brain, and would
find out Arts in their own imaginations, till they have made a new Scheme, and
a Systematical World of invented Knowledges, which they do people in their own
and in others fancies: their words of Art have hid Truths from our plain
serious Christians, who are of humble inquiringness, that so Philosophers might
keep up their Silver-shrining-trade, by affirming it to be an impediment of
Sciences, for the Scholar to require, or for the Teacher to render, a clear
proof of things propounded; from whence it comes, that the powers of the mind
are continually shaken with hesitancies, diverted with impertinencies, abused
with unprofitingness, and misled into erringness. This has been the mischievous
design of the grand Enemy of the rational World, to obscure Learning, and
intricate Knowledges thereby to keep off Souls from that Scripture Light, by
which they might discern the secrets of Wisdom; and his negotiating Factors
would have all the World to buy up his false Ware, and to trade with him till
they have almost wasted their all, and their stock of Learning does consume,
and they be quite bankrupted, as to any soundness of knowledge: How imperiously
domineering has this Philosophic Tyranny proved, which would have us to
receive its stamp, and to bear its image, as if it were that alone which must
be current, and to admit of its superscription, to conform to its platform, and
to shape our Letters after this Conquerors hand writing, as if all mankind
should subject and inslave themselves to its intellectual usurpation, which
has too long, and too far invaded all Arts, and possessed all Sciences! If
once professing Christians were more spiritual discerners, and more obsequious
observers of Scripture-discoveries in these matters, the plain discourses of
experienced Believers, and of growing Saints, would relishingly favor more of
saving sound knowledge, and of wholesome useful Truth, than the learnedest
Treatises of the wisest Philosophers, from whose Writings we have no good
reason to expect any transforming efficacy; For the converting of straying
Souls, or for the rectifying of erring Minds. Arts and Sciences, Philosophic
ones have heretofore mis-called it their honor, to be their Mother Egypt's
Daughters, because there they had both rise and growth; yet even there was the
grand seat of gross Idolatry; when Pagan Astronomers exalted themselves as high
above others in their knowledge of heavingly things, they set up in their
Imaginations and Books, many Monsters in the Heavens, which have been long
worshipped as Gods. Corrupt Hearts and corrupt Books will soon mingle, and
corrupt Principles will quickly pass into corrupt practices; and thus does the
Candle of many men's lives waste away about empty vanities, or groundless
conjectures, or superstitious conceits, or overcurious nicities, or
unprofitable subtilties, or intangling perplexities, and they dye away without
the insighted perception of the most mysterious secrets, and choice
excellencies, and precious treasures.

It is Scripture-knowledge that is the sublimest Reason, and the best Learning;
the shining emanations of Holy Writ are clearly visible to spiritual Eyes in
this age of Light: This is that, which I would hold forth before others, and
commend unto them. Were we more one in bringing all our Controversies and
Disputings to this only Rule of judging, we should the sooner agree in other
things, the Scripture-league would hold us closer together in a brotherly
confederacy. This design is not an humor of innovating in the Commonwealth of
Learning, but an endeavor to revive the true, good old way of written
Revelation, and to bring back to that word of certainty, according to which the
proficiency in Arts, and the progression in Sciences is best and only found:
Sound Knowledges will be upon ruining, till there be an apt reduction of them
to their primitive pure principles in Scripture-verities, where both their
complete summary is contained, and their due bounds are set. Intellect and
Reason must be measured by a Scripture-line, and Senses and Experiments must be
brought to word-axioms; these must conquer all Opinions, as having the
Universal Monarchy over all the learned Territories of the Intellectual World:
An exact discovery of the true Causes of things, with their efficacious
production of answerable effects, must be searched after here: No other Writing
in the World does carry along with it Truths, superior dominion over the
Conscience, and its magistral Authority over the Will; its illustration to the
Understanding, and its evidence to the Judgment, but only this; if I pay this
reverence unto Christ, and unto his Word, it is a duty which I owe him, and
under him to it as the sum of Arts, and the treasury of Sciences, the complete
Bibliotheke of all useful Learning: the due respect which I bear it, has
enboldned me to make this printed Report of it. The Principle of Essence is in
Jehovah Himself, who is the Principal Efficient Cause of all Beings, who put a
Being into all created Natures; who is the great Instructor in useful Arts, who
does propound the best and greatest ends of those Arts, and does direct to the
truest aptest means, which do lead thereunto: But the Principle of Science is
revealed in the written Word, which does give forth the right knowledge of the
Doctrinal part of those Arts, and which does make wise the Student, and the
Practicioner, by the help of senses to collect some clear understanding, in
particular subject matters of those several Arts, by Observation and History to
gather and place in the Mind, what is taken in from those Senses, by insighting
experiences, to apply to a certain use those many collected Observations, by
induction inferringly, and improvingly to use, to apply, and to accommodate
those many collected Experiences to constitute and establish an universal
conclusion; by these steps and degrees may we ascend into sound knowledge, and
with more speed, ease and satisfaction, learn the best part of profitable Arts
and Sciences. This does set out the true real Nature of created Beings, as they
are in the things themselves; whereas mere humane attemps this way have no
certainty of demonstration, nor infallibity of evidence, no further
convincingness than as they agree with this: there is answeringness in this to
the Nature of Existences, which are printed in this Word, and sealed in the
Creation: here the laws of words are one with the laws of things; here the
conducture of the word does lead the way, and the architecture of the Creation
does follow after: whatsoever does contradict the grounds of God-inspired
Scripture, and the reasons of created Nature, must be rejected by us: here
Scripture reveals Nature, and Nature declares Scripture; the LORD's Mouth in
his Word does not gainsay his hand in his Works; there are such inner secrets
in created Beings, as are separate from outward Senses, and exempt from
experimental discovery, and withdrawn from mere humane inquisition, which works
of Nature are best contemplated in the word of Grace, so sweetly does this
insinuate into, and incorporate with those. How is the Intellect of man likely
to be receptive of useful Truths, till it be first purified by
Scripture-knowledge? all the impresses of Wisdom, of Truth, and of Goodness,
that are in created things, they are but the transcribed Characters of the
Word, and the visible representations of those shining perfections, that are in
the All-glorious Author of this Word, who does direct their Nature, and govern
their operations, to bring about his own holy just ends for the good and
benefit of particular Beings, and of the whole Universe. Scripture descriptions
are most significative of created Natures, and best expressive of their real
Virtues; let therefore these Philosophical Imperialists no longer exercise
Lordship over the Faith of Christians, however they have thus far usurped
dominion over the Reason of Pagans; let not our Understandings be commanded by
their Laws of Arts, nor ruled by their Decrees of Sciences, who would have all
Intellects to bow before them, whilst they sit in the Throne, and King it over
men's Souls. It is the Scripture Revelation that does best preserve the due
order of Christ's Supreme Sovereignty, and of its own pre-eminent authority,
and of our regular subjection under both him and it, by its winning
commendations of Truths, and of Realities, in the demonstrativeness of their
evidence, and in the choiceness of their excellencies, operations of Nature,
and efficiencies of Arts cooperating with Nature, and drawing forth its
working powers, are as so many instances and interpretations of such Scripture
as do speak of them. Wisdom is Mat. 11. 19,
justified of her Sons, though the common cry of the mis-judging World be
against her. Knowledges in this Word have their universal conprehensiveness,
and if men's Studies in them were fitted to their particular inclinations, and
framed to their constitution-desires, more able instruments better furnished
for public employments, both in State and in Church, both for Peace and for
War, would then be found; the skilfullest Scripturians would prove the wisest
Artists, and the prudentest Counselors. Were Lecturers in all Countries
encouraged, and appointed in fit places to read in the Mother Tongue, on such
Scripture-subjects, it would make popular Judgments, and common Auditors great
proficients in Arts, and progressors in Sciences; which spreadingness of
knowledge of Christians should not make it contemptible: whereas, now the
Philosophers would keep Learning in a few hands amongst Scholars in the
Universities, and Readers of Colleges, and Professors in the Schools, who would
be monopolizing of Original Languages, and of Scientifick Skills, and be
driving on of their rich Trade of overreaching sophistry: I judge it to be an
Affirmation according to Truth, and an undertaking according to Reality, that a
plain Believer, of discerning capacity, may be righter taught many useful
things, about the History of the Creation, in natural Beings, in their proper
Causations, productive Workings, and genuine Effects in one year, than several
years, and yet more times seven in the common way of Philosophical Studies will
or can attain unto: In this Scripture path Believers may expect the teachings
of the Holy Spirit, and inlightnings from the Father of illuminations: much of
the written Word would then receive more evident and full interpretations, when
Christ's Works are made a paraphrase upon his Words: Here particular Sciences
are true, fruitful and complete, not as in Philosophical VVritings in false,
barren and empty. If little Children were commonly taught the Original
Language, and if there were in the Mother-Tongues of the several Nations such
an exact Scripture Lexicon composed, as might show the true meaning of all the
Original Words, Roots and Branches, and of all the Original Phrases, relating
to the several Arts and Sciences; and if the whole of these Words and Phrases
were orderly and distinctly with their cited Scriptures put into a common place
of these special knowledges in various professions; and if the most
accomplished, the best gifted, the most excellingly graced, the most diligently
and faithfully industrious, and the most practically and skilfully experienced,
for every particular Art and Science, did make it much of the work of their
day, and business of their life, to study the Scriptures for that peculiar end
and special purpose, putting not only general Rules, but particular Directions
all methodically together, it would be a complete Summary, and an exact
Directory in that Art and Science. Shall my growing waiting hopes be only of
the next Generation, that they may listen to this counsel? who will give, that
I may reap some good fruit of my labors in the present age! if the LORD, by
his secret inworking with wonderful efficacy, will renew and irradiate men's
minds, if he will bend and bow their wills, change and awe their hearts, then
self-conceit, pride and prejudice, will quickly vanish away, and a teachable
Frame will so embrace and improve this advice, as that the ingenuous and
studious will not be so injurious to themselves, or unkind toward Christ, as
to kick Him and His Word out of their Schools; for it will be made manifest in
a little time, that created Beings in their natural efficiencies, have such an
hidden way of secret operation, as is beyond Job 38. 2.
the most significant expressions of any Philosophical VVorders; and therefore
only the words of God can fully so accommodate them to enlightened
Understandings, as withal to make them properly declarative of real workings:
All true, both definitions and descriptions of things by words, must be
rectified by Scripture Language. Whatever be the issue, I have, through Mercy
and Grace obtained from the LORD, done this part of my Generation work, and in
this I do rejoice and give glory to Him. Where does the whole Scripture, that
speaks of this matter, send us to any other way of getting sound knowledge?
This design, that I am now promoting, does not interdict School education, nor
forbid Scientifick Exercises, but it does set both Teacher and Learner in a
right way. VVhither can we go to fetch a perfect Supplement for deficiencie in
Arts, but from the Word? no where else is there an unerring rectification of
the crooked variations of Sciences but here. Were Students once well
persuaded, that this Scripture-method and way of attaining knowledges were
Prove. 8. 11. 12.
passable and plain, and the walk there experienced to be safe and easy, how
could it then be any other than pleasant traveling, which does so directly
lead to so great a profit, where all is best suited, not only to the future
eternal happiness of Believers, but also to the present wising of the World,
gratifying at once both the speculative Inquirer, and the mechanic Artificer,
where both an augmentation of many useful particularities, and a melioration of
the whole of gainful Learning would be met with? Expected occasions are flying
away from me now, as many of them have already taken wing and are gone, and
therefore ere a stop be put to my breathing here below, I would by a
Scripture-hand conduct a little, that the more wise and skilful may come on and
lead others further forward: I should gladly have sat down as a teachable
Disciple, at the feet of some well-grown Instructor, and would delightfully do
so still, if others better furnished, and more accomplished, and who have more
opportunities and advantages, would more thoroughly inform both themselves and
others, in the true state of this scientifical project. Here may be at once
both the true increase of useful Learning, and the real promoting of an Holy
Life. This sound Scripture-knowledge is the only cure of arted Phantasms, and
the proper means of being awakened out of scientifick Dreams: Here the
regenerate intellect of the New Creature gets quick acquaintance with the true
reasons of things, and his enlightened mind is familiar in its converse with
real existencies; here are set before his view clear Aspects from invisible
Objects, and his inner man can commune with unseen talkers, which do give him
ready access into the better Country of the other World. The Scriptures are
composed, not only for contemplative felicity, but also for practical business,
being exactly suited to all weightiness of affairs, and to all the powers of an
operative life. The orderly working, and the real usefulness of created Beings,
is to be directed unto her; all the Philosophers in the world, with all their
Books have no^ that profitable Learning in them, which the four and thirty
first Verses of the Bible have treasured up in them: Here the meditating
inquirer may get the knowledge of those distinct works of the Creator in their
six proper days foregoing, which works are the visible Signets, and the lively
Impressions of the comely Excellencies of the glorious Maker, till the
believing Soul comes and passes into its rest, and to sweet satisfaction
sensibly enjoys its holy Sabbath, in Him on the seventh, which is the last,
the closing day of the week; this being much of my present purport and design,
drift and scope in this Treatise, from the several days of the first week of
the Created World, and the established unchangeable Laws thereof, to propound
some profitable inquiries from each days productions, such as may have a direct
tendency to the real advancement of useful Learning, and then opening somewhat
of my own apprehensions from the collating of other Scriptures, concerning the
matters queried, such of them as are profitably handled, for several others
will be little, if any thing more than barely propounded, and so left to
further disquisition. In this undertaking there is no just cause for any to be,
either an humorous Envyer, or a quarrelsome Contender, or a troublesome
Backbiter, or a treacherous Enemy, or a false Friend; let him but love Christ,
and believe the Word, and approve the Enterprise, and promote the Design, and
better the Plot, I have much of my desire so far; where any will meliorate it,
he shall have my Prayers and Testimony for him. In this age of such diffused
rovings of mind, and of such wandering expatiations of imaginations, my walking
Soul has then the more quiet resting place, when it gets and keeps within
Scripture-doors, and there freely converseth with Christ. In this word each
Artist may find out his Mystery, and get skill with a little cost by plainly
reading the imprinted Characters of the useful nature of his lawful Profession:
Here real Learning wears the Honor of its Crown, and true wisdom is beautified
with the dignity of its advancement, in the several Sciences; here the King may
be skilled in the Art of Empire, and the Magistrate may be wised in the Science
of Government; here the Counselor may know how to advise, and the Warrior may
be taught how to fight; here the Astronomer may best understand the Heavens,
and the Luminaries there; here the Geometrician may learn how to measure, and
the Arithmetician how to number, the Physician how to cure, the Surgeon how to
heal, the Anatomist how to dissect, the Apothecary how to compound, the Seaman
how to sail, the Architect how to build, the Musician how to modulate, the
Logician how to argue, the Geographer how to situate, the Chronologer how to
compute, the Rhetorician how to persuade, the Historian how to Record, the
Carpenter how to rule, the Joyner how to frame, the Advocate how to plead, the
Minister how to preach, the Cosmographer how to systeme, Esai. 28. 23 -- 29:
Eccles. 10. 8, 9, 10.
the Husbandman how to manure: These and other Artists in other honest Trades
would find their God instructing and teaching them, concerning the rightest
way, and the fittest manner, to manage, and to carry on their several
Functions, with success through his blessing upon their labors; all their
affairs would then be ordered with more discretion and prudence; even the
Hedger, the Mason, and the Carpenter, would experience Scripture-wisdom to have
an excellency of rectification in it, to direct them how to do their work
aright. What shall I say more? consider well what those Arts and Sciences are
which are lawful, useful and necessary, and then let inquiry be made, whether
their Conduct and Augment may not be found in the Word incomparably beyond what
any, or all Philosophic Books of mere Humane Wisdom can skill in? here is the
Spring and Fountain of all true good Learning: Scripture-knowledge has the
clearest light, and gives the most certain information, affording the most pure
and satisfying delights: This does hold the refined Intellect, and the
discerning Mind close unto it, and does fill it with high holy heavenly
pleasures, still feeding a spiritual appetite as it is taken in, and yet
exciting it with new desires of injoyiug more, there being yet a further
discovery Dan. 12. 4. Es^^. 11. 9. Habak. ^. 14. Jer. 3^. 34. Heb. 8. 11.
of abounding knowledge in these later days. Here is a separation of Truth from
Error; here the true real causes of Error are assigned and manifested: It is
not said, that men do therefore err, because they know not the Traditions of
Elders, and the Customs of Forefathers, or because they are not skilled in the
Doctrines of the Rabbis, and in the Writings and Sayings of the Fathers, or
because they do not submit to the Authorities of Magistral Guides, and of
Humane Imposers, or because they do not receive unwritten verities, and seek
for extra-Scriptural Supplements, or because they do not subscribe the Councils
of Synods, the Articles and Canons of Churches, or because they do not conform
to rational establishments, and comply with the commandments of men, or because
they do not read over the Books of the Ancients, and turn the leaves of Modern
Treatises upon particular subjects, or because they are not of the same
judgment with the Learned, and of the like practice with the godly men, so
reputed of these times, or because they are not well versed in Church History,
and deeply seen in the Monuments of Antiquity, or because they have not been
bred up to be Masters of Arts, and Doctors of Sciences, in Philosophical
Studies, and in University Schools; but, Mat. 22. 29. Mar. 12. 24 -- 27.
because they know neither the Scriptures which do reveal the Truth, nor the
Power of God which does exert the Truth in created Natures, through which his
Wisdom, and other of his Excellencies and Perfections are so visible, whose
Word is engraven on his Works, and whose Works are written in his Word;
therefore it is, that they do err, greatly err: diverse of these may be more
largely demonstrated in some afterparts of this Treatise. Dan. 10. 21.
Ink these Scriptures of Truth, Arts have an uniformness and harmony, and
Sciences have a consent and concord: all is here delivered in apt expressions,
suited to the nature of things, adapting them to their proper ends, and good
purposes: here is a lively representation of verities, and of realities, the
right knowledge of which does carry into the very beingness of created
Essences, drawing forth their hidden Virtues into active operativeness. What
through the artificial cunning of sophistical deceivers, and the ignorant
simplicity of the credulous vulgar, the best Learning is much undervalued, and
its fastest Friends are almost wholly forgotten: he, that makes man his Idol,
and is easy of belief when man speaks, will so long, be neither master of
Reason, nor an exerciser of Faith, neither will he be well settled in
judgment, nor quieted in spirit, whilst he thus goes away from experimental
Truth in God's Word, to such doubtful matters in men's writings. The wholly
Scriptures are a growing Treasury of fruitful knowledge, and would still be
bringing forth somewhat more; whereas he, that takes all upon trust from humane
Authors, and Philosophical Tractates, will captive his own judgment, and
fetter his own understanding, and leave his own soul unfruitful and unprofited,
who might have found the Scriptures to have disclosed before him, the
properties and powers of created Beings, in order to some great usefulness in
the life of man. In a Scripture-way, the serious researcher may safely and
surely walk, and unerringly (if he follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
according to this straight rule) travel into the Mysteries of Grace, and the
Secrets of Nature; if we follow any others in another path, they are
superficial, not profound, either in their inquiries or discoveries. Practical
Christianity, and experimental Religion is the highest Science, and the noblest
Art, and the most honorable Profession, which gives light to all inferior
knowledges, and would admit into the Royalest Society, and draw nearest in
resemblance and conformity, to the glorified Fellowship in the Heavenly College
above, where their knowledge is perfected in visional intuitive light. Here is
the prime Truth, the original Verity, as to the manifestativeness of it in
legible visible ingravings, which would carry progressively into other Learning
contained therein: all here is reducible to practice and use, to life and
conversation; here existences and realilties are contemplated and proved, not
mere Ideas and conceits speculated as elsewhere. The ultimate and best end of
Learning, is to furnish a renewed Understanding, and to advance sanctified
Reason, and to raise discerning Grace, for the promoting of the Honor of the
LORD, and the holiness and happiness of Souls: This is its last and highest
pitch, the perfection of its discovery, which its nature can reach to heat on
Earth: no way but that which is Scriptural can direct aright unto the speediest
attainment of sound and well accomplished Learning, although those who are the
self-conceited Gnostics of the times are under a great temptation of being
some of the subtillest Opponents of this Christian Position. Come hither
therefore thou Inquisitor of Truth! thou may find it in the Word; thou
need not turn over the many voluminous Books, and historical Records of men,
to desire what the Knowledges and the Arts are, or who were the first Authors
and Inventers of them: It Is not all their Writings that can make thee wise to
Salvation, as 3 Tim. 3. 15.
the Scriptures can. How filled with doubtful uncertainties are the Ancient
Records of Humane Writers, how many corrupt mixtures are there in them, how
stuffed with gross flatteries, or with personal reflections, are modern
reports; how corresponding to private interests, how wrested and wryed to
passion and to party? What a superfoetation is there of new Treatises yearly
coming forth, either to censure the errors, or to fill up the defect of other
Authors, or to pretend to some rare discovery, or new invention, or to boast of
an exacter method? though still at best, imperfection is their nature, and
there is an yet further, and a more onward. It is no imbasing or distaining
unto the holy Scriptures, to fetch and to derive all useful Learning from these
sacred Fountains; rather does this make much the more for their honor and
commendation, that there is such a fullness of Arts and perfection of Sciences
in this one Book. The bringing and wresting of Scripture to men's Arts and
Rules, to wrie and to force it into a compliance with them, and not examining
of all Arts and Rules by the Scripture, to measure and to judge of them by
this, has introduced much error, and shut out much Truth, to the sullying of
Religion, the corrupting of Reason, the poisoning of the Mind, and the
polluting of the Life. Here in this word Studies would be carried on in Faith,
and in obedience, which would greaten the expectation of assistance, and of
acceptance of income, and a blessing, in all indagations after the mind of
Christ: when Scriptural illuminations do shiningly cast their beams on a
spiritual discerner, they do secretly, but withal strongly, influence and
operate, by a transforming efficacy unto a more glorious resemblance of the
Heavenly Image of an holy Christ, and of his holy Word: This way the
understanding of a Believer does pass into more spiritualizedness, and does
more freely converse with its inner Teacher, under these intellectual rays.
Students in Scripturalism would get further into the choicer Mysteries of
experimental Christianity, even whilst they here see Liberal Arts in their
proper axioms made usefully Mechanical in their elicited operations: If every
one be to be credited in his own Art, they must then learn this Art in the
Scriptures, and then also should Christ be believed in his Word, who is the
Jude 25. John 3. 3.
only Wise One, a Teacher by Office from the Fathers Donation, and by the Holy
Spirits Unction. This gives a great advantage to plain Believers; for, although
they know not well how to evade Philosophical Juglings, or to confute
Sophistical Fallacies, and cunning cheats, of overreaching Argumentation, and
insnaring syllogizing, yet through this help, and its secret suggestings, they
have so much perception, as to discern things to be otherwise than colors and
shows of carnal reasonings do make them seem to be; so that, when they have not
their answers ready, yet they will not suffer their Judgments to be
misinformed by such impudent bafflings; and if these vain affecters of Humane
Wisdom be once taken off from their froward way of wrangling disputations, to
reason the case familiarly by Questions and Answers, such as are proper and
pertinent to the matter under debate, and by a collating of the whole
Scripture, that does speak of such a particular subject inquired about, that
sort of men would bewray themselves to be some of the most ignorant and
sottish, especially in the choicest Science of experienced Religion, and in the
best art of practical Christianity. This way of arguing is the way of the Word,
which any diligent Reader of it, particularly in that part of it by the four
Evangelists, may often observe; hence disputing is set out by a word that does
signify (...), Mar. 8. 11, 12, and 9. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and 12.

, mutual inquiring by way of questioning, in a friendly conference to search
out the Truth by interrogations and responses, examining of things by a
disquiring reasoning about, them in a familiar Colloquie, and in an amicable
manner, where it is managed according to Rule; hereby the understanding is
weakened to attend, and the mind is quickened to consider of the Arguments in
disputation concerning that which is queried about; hene also in Scripture we
sometimes do find an Mat. 12. 28. etc. and 22. 46. Mar. 11. 29, etc. Luke 1.

answer at the beginning of a Speech of Debate, which is as if somewhat were
returned of satisfactory resolution to a secret question, that did tacitly go
before. It would contribute much toward the increase of Learing, if those
practical Rules, that are in the Word, were well understood, observed, and
improved, for the right managing of an Holy Dispute, and of a Spiritual
reasoning about weighty Controversies in a Scripture way, so as might tend to
edification; whereas, in the Philosophic Modes, argumentative exercitations
are usually ^ Tim. 6. 5. (...).

generous, and would breed up a better and more noble race of arguers. Let this
be admitted, and then put the most souly acute learned unregenerate
Philosopher, into the same room together with a serious believing discerning
humble Saint; and if the question be, How may a Believer have access to the
Father through Christ in one Spirit? Or, how may we have fellowship with
Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in a distinct way, as the Father, as the Son, and
as the holy Spirit? Or, how should Grace be acted? or what is the proper Grace
to be acted in a particular case? Or, how does one Grace operate upon another?
Or, how should a duty be well filled up? Or, what is the true way of walking
with God? Or, by what means and methods should such or such a corruption be
mortified? Or, what is the Holy Skill of repelling and resisting a temptation,
and of overcoming of the World? Or, what is a Believers orderly applying of
Christ to be Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption? Or, what
kind of frames should a Believer be always in? Or, how should Religion run into
the whole of our Life, in our particular, as well as in our general Calling?
with many more such like as might be propounded; and let some well-grown
Fathers in Knowledge, and in Grace, over-hear and moderate between these two

what profane and vain babbling would they conclude the Philosophers discourse
to be, and himself to be an ignorant unexperienced trifling pratler, whilst the
spiritual holy man has a name of honor proclaimed in their inner Court of
spiritual Judicature, they acknowledge him to be a knowing, a discerning, a
skilful John 6. 45. Esai. 54. 13. 1 Cor. 2. 15.
, a God-taught one, and they admire the gift, and the graces of the Spirit in
him: the Believer, so far as his attainment and acquaintances are, has clear,
smooth, equal representations of Truths, and of things, as they are in
themselves, directly reflected from the Word upon his enlightened Understanding,
and faithfully, and sincerely taken in by him, as his filling measures are;
whereas, the Philosophizing contradicter has diverse superstitious Conceits,
wrong Notions, misshapen Opinions, erroneous Apprehensions, and deceitful
Impostures, about these matters. In Scripture there is a perfect Analogy
between Words and Truths, and between Truths and Things, so that, as the
Scripture is the written Revealer of Natural Beings and Powers, so are Natural
Beings and Powers the wrought Interpreters of Scripture. The end of words is
rightly to express the sense of the Mind, and meaning of the Speaker: matters
and business, to which our Religion is suited and fitted, do require a
significance in sayings. Though man lost the Tree of Life Genesis 2. 9 -- 16, 17.
and 3. 5, 6, 7 -- ^1 -- 22, 23, 24.
, by an inordinate lusting after the prohibited Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,
of good and of evil; yet one good means to be Prove. 3. 13 -- 18.
restored to the Tree of Life again, is by returning to taste the nourishing
Fruit of the commanded Tree of Scripture-Knowledge, and to grow thereby.
Scripture-Truths carrying their own evidence along with them, do prove
themselves as soon as a Spiritual discerner receives them, because word
Sciences are consonant to Primitive Light in Man, and to concreated Nature in
particular Beings: Holy Scriptures unto renewed Natures do make suitable
impressions of saving knowledges; these discoveries unto serious inquiries, and
to considering spirits, will in Jebovah's time upon a due pondering, more
manifest themselves to be solemn and grand matters, and will yet more approve
themselves in the pursuit and issue to be efficacious for operation, and
fruitful for use, and will best season the minds of young Students, whilst
their spirits are tender. 1 Pet. 2. 2. (...). Romans 12. 1. (...). 1 Pet. 3. 15.

Truly-logical-Art is, that which is really word-Art, not a Disputative
Knowledge, or Syllogistical form of men's inventing generous Spirits, those that
are indeed such, will conform their Reason to Faith, and their Faith to
Spirit-inspired Revelation: This word-Declaration, and written-discovery is
perfect in its self, and perfective in those who grow in it: here the noble
excellencies of rational Souls may be advanced to somewhat of their highest
dignity in their utmost capacities: here are the full Originals, and the
overflowing Springs of useful Knowledge: here the believing Trader with his
spiritual Talents may increase his stock of sanctified Learning, somewhat near
in its approaching step to one of the Royal Privileges of the Heavenly Glory,
which is unmixed clearness, and perfect coo^mmateness of all profitable
Sciences. Philosophical Notions are idle stories and when they pass into vain
janglings, they are frothy talk, and un^d^^ying chat, they fill the fancy with
dreaming speculations, and make the mind 1 Timothy 6, 3, 4, 5.
sick and weak; whereas, the Scriptures do afford such a kind of Learning, as
is 2 Timothy 1. 13. (...).
sound and healthful in its own innate constitution, and in its causal
efficiencies: here the intentive Reader is still held in a continued dependency
on a spiritual Teacher of those necessary Lessons which are never well learned
Phil. 4. 11, 12, 13. Mat. 11. 23 -- 27 -- 29.
but in Christ's School, and where he may get great skill with little cost in a
short while: This would make skilful Practitioners in ordinary Affairs, and in
the common Matters and Actions of Life, which Philosophers do miscount to be
beneath souly rationalists. Students in Christianity, when thoroughly seasoned
with the in-working-knowledge of Holy Precepts, and of practical Truths, are
more awed into an observance of what is taught in Scriptures Pew; they are
instructed in Duties, and informed in Manners, whilst they inquire into Arts,
and pursue Sciences. Where the savingness of knowledge is sucked in betimes,
all growing discoveries, if they work kindly, are improved toward the firm
securing of a never-ending-felicity: Faith, and Fear, and Love, and other
Graces, as they widen the Understanding, and compose the Mind, and fix the
Heart, still to be taking of more, so they also refine the Spirit, and reform
the Life. The Eyes of the wisest men in the World can never see themselves
truly represented; so, as that, the direct beams may have a right incidence,
but in the Glass of God's Word, and he is not as yet in a preparedness to take
in other Learning, who has not hitherto attained to the true knowledge of
himself.

A growing Artfulness in Scripture-Science will commend it self where it is in
any, though the commender of this unto such court not their applause, but seek
their profit: though I be forgotten who write this, yet Christ and his Word
will still have a living name in such for all Treasures of Learning, there
being here full instruction for all necessary Employments, and complete
Subsidaries for all practical Conversation. Let not the judicious ingenuous
Reader expect from me a System of Sciences, or Platform of Arts, with their
proper Rules and Methods: To handle these thoroughly in an exact tractate, is
too great and long a task for my little parts and short day; it were an
undertaking worthy of some Christian King to employ the learnedest and holiest
of mankind about, that either love or promotion could procure, or kindness, or
reward engage, or helps and materials encourage; though in some few instances I
may a little lead others the way, with a Scripture Light in my hand. I owed a
great duty to the intellectual World of precious Souls, and I had no other way
to make such a public payment of it: the good of Communion must out balance
any private concern of my own: he that would consult his own reputation and
quiet amongst men in this age, would have concealed his apprehensions in such a
day, when many are so self-seeking, and so angrily confident by strengthened
preconceptions, and fortified prejudices, and radicated resolves, against any
discoveries that might convince and shake them: What is done is subjected to
Scripture-examination by spiritual discerners. When received Opinions have got
the Peoples Applause, and Leaders Authority, and Men's interest in this World,
he had need bring some clearness of demonstration, who would have others to
leave their former ways, to which they have been so used, that they may come
into a Scripture-path. It would be next to incredible in a man's self, to
persuade belief in others, who are so far gone in prejudice and prepossession,
were there not a Prophecy and Promise, that in the later days Esai. 29. 18 --
24.
, they, who err in spirit, shall know understanding, and the murmurers shall
learn instruction; for, the deaf shall hear the words of this Book (of the
Scriptures of Truth) and the Eyes of the Blind shall see, passing out of the
obscurity and darkness, when they will blush to consider how Truth had scarce
any door to enter in at, what by innate ignorances, and attracted wilfulnesses,
and indulgent weaknesses. I arrogate nothing to my self of being a first
Inventer of Arts, but do refer wholly unto that word, which would illustrate
and brighten, adorn and amplify Sciences. The LORD may therefore have laid me
low, and left me despicable in the eyes of the reputed Learned, that Christ and
his Word (...) be set the higher. Careless neglects have given countenance to
such (...) errors, as now by long prescription would pass into a common
unc^^^ollable Law of Arts and of Sciences, like the idle tales, and fabulous
stories, and fictitious narrations, which 1 Timothy 1. 4. and 4. 7. 2 Timothy 4. 4.
Tit. 1. 14. 2 Pet. 1. 16.
old wives filled our heads withal, when we were little Chrildren, and a
traditionary credulity would still keep alive the memory of them till old age,
and so would transmit the frame of them to posterity. Had I not Jehovah and his
Word on my side, there were little expectation of any considerable success in
engaging this Scholastic War, where so many opposers are all up in arms
against me, and are so confident of Victory: were it not for this, the
controversy would stare me in the face with so many frighting difficulties,
that my time about this (that little of it, which I can be master of, to redeem
it from the unavoidable intercurrences of other necessary work) would scam to
be misspent, and my industry mis-employed, and the powers and strength of my
mind wasted; I had else soon been dis-spirited, whilst the chief scope of so
many men's aims, studies and endeavors, is either to defend or execute other
men's mistakes, or to justify and commend their own: however, if hereby the
reputation of the Scriptures may revive after my death, and if the just esteem,
and the good opinion of God's Word may be built up, though on the ruins of my
credit for the present; I bless that Jehovah, who has used me to trust him with
hereafters, wherein one of the greatest trials of our spirit and frame is: and
if this only means of improving so fertile a ground of knowledges be disliked,
and rejected by this Generation, the springing Race in aftertimes will rejoice
when they shall reap and gather in, use and enjoy the good fruit of these
honest labors. Wordly advancement, and a flattered name, is the consulted
project, and the fore-casted contrivement of a low debased mind, unbecoming
that princely spirit in a Believer, which has nobler designs, and higher aims.
If this tractate be not exact, yet the subject matter is excelling: the
Scripture-cause of word-learning is such, that he who objecteth against it,
does quarrel with the Author of it, who will have a time to Jerem. 44. 28.
make such to know whose word shall stand, whether this of him, or that of
them? when it will be manifest in the hearts of such, that this design is not
the product of a discontented mind, or of humoursome censoriosness, or of a
grave affection, or of a splenetick windiness. Vulgar Prizers are no just
valuers; for, Scripture-Truth, though all be sold for it, is never Prove. 23.
23. Matt. 13. 44, 45, 46 -- 52.
bought too dear, and though all the World could be had for it, yet would be
sold too cheap; it is well worth thy dealing for, whatever it cost thee.
Scripture-Learning has an operative influence to correct and rectify, to
change and renew, to reform and refine, hearts and lives, to affect the Soul
with a due sense of its own noble excellencies, and widened capacities, that it
may be holy and happy, wise and prudent for ever, to make the conscience feel
the weight of present Duty, and of future felicity, with the kindliest ties and
strongest obligations. O how excellent are the Virtues, how efficacious the
Powers, that do flow from hence! The Patrons of this Book are Christ and his
Word, Truth and Good, Reason and Religion, Scripture and Nature. Spreading
untruths have gotten a name of Antiquity and Reputation, and popular Opinion
has kept up their credit, and still it does them reverence: but they are all
falling before the Scriptures of Truth; for, rather than fail, the Christian
verities, and the rare knowledges contained in them, shall be yet further
confirmed by such Miracles, as are beyond the Powers of Nature, and the Arts of
Man. The seeming impossibility of all profitable Learning in one Book, will in
time be removed out of the way, and off from the thoughts by a sound belief of
the infinite wisdom of the Author of it. The true uniform voice of holy
Scripture, and of created Nature, is with me and for me, though the common
votes of the mistaking world cry me down; although such ill habits have been
acquired through the power and energie, and effascination of Philosophy, as no
ability or skill of man can remove, yet Almightiness and All-wisdom can work
Students off from it. If I publish my own imperfections, and proclaim my own
ignorances, and bewray my own follies; yet let not the Reader forget, that I am
a pleader for the most righteous cause in the judgment of the best Law, the
evidence is clear for it, and the sentence of approbation is already
pronounced, that the holy Scriptures of Truth are the best, the perfect
Platform of all useful Scientificks: Christ is the Head-Captain of created
Hosts, and he will triumphingly Conquer, his Truth is strong, and it shall
prevailingly overcome. Scripture-knowledge, especially in the savingness of its
Science, and in the Sanctifyingness of its Art, does speak enough for it self
within the breast of every spiritual discerner, as having an incomparable 1
Cor. 2. 1, ^. 4. 6. Philip. 3. 8.
excellency in it, above and beyond all other Skills and Wisdoms in the World:
I need not urge many arguments to convince those Readers of this great useful
Truth, who have felt the living power of it upon their renewed hearts, for,
when it came there, it brought in its own self evidence, and left a sensible
demonstration, and wrote a sealed Testimonial under its own hand, there. I have
(though this also much in my aim to praise it more unto such, and to press them
to make some higher advance in this best Learning, as being a nearer approach
unto intuitive perfection in visional Glory, and that which raises the
spiritual Reason, and the enlightened Faith of the Saints here below in this
Intellectual World, into a resemblance of Angelical Wisdom, yet, I say I have)
somewhat further in my present design, which is to win upon those who are under
impetuous temptations, and violent assaults, to be Atheists and Infidels, both
speculative and practical, by a prevailing insinuating of this astertion, if
the LORD will say so too, that word-Science, and Scripture-Art, is the Science
of Sciences, and the Art of Arts, every way most and best corresponding to the
capacities, suited to the cases, fitted to the necessities, and promoting the
felicities, of rational Beings; so that, this discovery has its great
usefulness to all, even the most knowing, and the most holy: as for others, who
may be far gone in this spiritual distemper of scorning of, and of scoffing at,
the asserted sufficiency and fullness of the Scriptures, that which they so
much slight, and so storm against, must be the means of their cure, unless they
be such, as will neither hear their disease, nor endure a remedy, but are
obstinate to all healing prescriptions. I take the causes of Atheism amongst
many others to be, as an afraidness of the convincingness, and of the
condemningness, of the holy Precepts and righteous Judgments declared in the
Scriptures, and an unbelief of its glorious rewards, so also this in
particular, ignorance of the excellency of Scripture-knowledge: and although
those, who do fall below Religion, will also sink beneath Reason too, yet I am
not altogether without hope, but that, when Jehovah Aelohim shall make his
Word-light to shine forth more in its beauteous glory, it will allure the eyes,
and draw the heart, inform the judgments, and incline the wills of men of
intellect, to see and to acknowledge, to adore and to admire, that only wise
God, who has put so much into so little, and has given us a Pocketbook of such
absolute fullness. The Antichristian party by their paper plots would blow up
all belief of the sufficiency and perfection of the Scriptures; as hoping, that
if they can once prevail, with a people to be of no Religion, they will then be
of their Religion, and the Anti-scripturarians have but too many followers in
this day, who if they be so bold as to assert this imperfection of the Word, in
the necessary matters of Salvation, no marvel if they deny its
conprehensiveness, as to the other knowable things. Arise Jehovah, plead thou
thine own plea, and magnify thou above All thy Name, thy Word! all the Kings
of the Earth shall confess Thee Jehovah, when they hear the words of thy mouth;
and they shall sing in the ways of Jehovah, for great is the Glory of Jehovah:
In Thee Aelohim thy Saints will praise thy Word, and a second, and a third
time, they will praise thy Word, this they know, that thou and thy word for
them.

Thus have I given thee, Reader, some account of the design of this Treatise,
which in short is, to hold forth all Sciences and profitable Arts in one Book
of Jehovah Aelohim, and to demonstrate the Scripture-way to be the true, the
right, the excelling, the only way of perfecting the knowledge of lawful Arts
and Sciences, and of the Restoration, and advancement of real Learning, so
opposed to vain, false and deceitful Philosophy, to such affected humane wisdom
as would make prey of precious Souls, and as being contrary to
Scripture-verity, to word-Theologie, to revealed Christianity, and to created
Nature, and so not after Christ. If thou be one of a plain understanding, and
if thy knowledge be only of the English complexion, so that thou can skill
only in thy own Mother Tongue, let my beseeching of thee be prevalent with
thee, not to be offended at it, that so many words of other Tongues are used in
this Treatise, especially in the former part of it: I am not my self fond of it
as to be so greatly pleased with it, but where I am some way even necessitated
to it, to express my self in some Scholastic Terms, Phrases and Language,
chiefly when I open them according to the Original significancy of Scriptural
expressions, for the conviction, and confutation of Philosophical Errors, and
for the confirmation and commendation of Scripture-Truths. I have put the
Scriptures referred unto, mostly in the Margin, not without some reasons which
have been privately satisfactory to me; yet withal I desire the serious
considerate lookerover of these lines, to examine the Words of Christ as he
goes along, lest otherwise he rashly censure, and over hastily condemn some
passages, which he will mistake to be only my own, when it may be upon a more
through examination, they will be found to be Scripture-sense, and
significancy: and so I put thee over unto 1 Cor. 2. 13. Esai. 59. 21.

wisdom of the Father, the Declarer and Interpreter of his Fathers Will; all

to stop the mouths of Philosophical gainsayers? sometimes deceptory
affectation of Humane Wisdom does bewray it self in opponents, by being carried
beyond due limits, when it would be judging of such cases, and things according
to the ordinary course of Nature, and the power of a finite Agent, which are to
be determined and resolved by such Principles of Theology, and of
Christianity, as are far above and beyond those: as if the question be, Whether
this World were from Eternity, or Whether created in time? Empty and fallacious
Philosophy will affirm, That this World was not created in time, but that it
was from Eternity, deceiving and being deceived by this color, and show of
carnal Reason, that out of nothing can nothing be made: thus it does mis-judge,
because the contrary affirmation is besides the common Agency, and the usual
efficacy of Natural Causes; but the holy Scriptures do otherwise declare,
rightly informing us, that all these things were spoken and made into a Being,
which had no existence before, by the Omnipotency of Jehovah, the Being of
beings, that All-glorious Self-being, only by his own powerful Word, So Heb.

without some stuff and materials, they must have their tools and other
instruments to further what they are about to do, and to form; but the Almighty
One does not need any such foregoing matter, or assisting help: it is not
impossible, that, that should be, which before was not, though the Heb. 1^. 3.
Believer only can rightly understand this; here Humane Reason must stoop, and
Carnal Imagination must submit to Word wisdom, and to Scripture-learning, which
has this mysterious secret treasured up in it; the meanest proficient in
Christ's School has more discerning in this, than the learnedest Teachers, and
wisest Professors in such corrupt Philosophy. If the question be, Whether three
Persons can be one in Essence, who yet are each of them distinct Subsistences
in themselves! and, Whether one in being, can be three distinct several
persons? humane wisdom, and the vain affecters of it will return this answer,
That a person is a living-understanding-nature subsisting by it self, a prime
or singular individual subsistence, which is neither said of any subject,
neither is in any subject; and therefore some of these Philosophets have
affirmed, that there are multitudes of Gods. Whereas, the Scriptures of Truth
will inform us concerning this great Mystery, that there is but one God; for,
there can be but one only Being infinite eternal unchangeable, perfection it
self, one only to exist of himself and by himself, who gives existence unto all
other things; these undoubted Oracles of holy Scriptures will tell us, that
Jehovah, the adored Almightiness of his people, in Father, Son and holy Spirit,
is Deaut. 6. 4.

one; for, albeit, there be that are called Gods both in Heaven and upon Earth,
as there be (in the vain wrong conceits of men, who do seign such Idol gods,
and as some Creatures in some cases have somewhat of this honorary Title
ascribed to them, so far as by their Office and Call, they do or shall
represent the true God) There is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
things, and we for him; and one LORD Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and
we by him; but in all, in every one, this knowledge is not; it is specially
revealed in the Word, to and in such Believers, and it is one of the greatest
mysterious Truths of the Christian Doctrine: There is one LORD, one Faith,
Ephesians. 4. 5, 6.
one God and Father of all: He that sets up many Gods, does withal set up many
Faiths; for every God would be calling for peculiar Faith to be given to him,
and every one would be severally believing in his several God. In this most
simple Essence, and single Being, there are three truly subsisting, whereof
every one is John 5. ^0 -- ^2 -- 36, 37. and 8. 16 -- 18. (...).

the Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit, and these three are one. If it be
queried, Whether one and the same person can be two distinct Natures of
different kinds? and Whether two such Natures can be in one Person? Empty
cheating Philosophy will wrongfully state this question, and mis-resolve it
thus, That those things which are of disparate kinds, cannot be predicated of
one another, nor united in the same suppositum: whereas true, pure Religion in
the written Word does give us to know, that two distinct Natures, as the Deity
or Godhead, and the Humanity or Mankind, may be both of them united into one
Christ: In this wonderful one were both these inseparably knit together, and
yet they each one remain distinct from the other, having several Natures,
Properties and Operations, both making up one LORD Jesus Christ. John 1. 14. 1 Timothy 3. 16.
This word was made flesh, this God has been manifested in the flesh; to the
Godhead Christ Heb. 2. 16. compare with this the first Chapter, where Christ's
being God is fully proved, and clearly demonstrated, Romans 1. 3, 4.

his Humane Nature: In him, that is, in this Christ, who is opposed to vain
affecters of humane wisdom, and humane traditionists, Coloss. 2. ^, ^.
dwells all the fullness of the Godhead Bodily; the one dwells in the other,
which do show them to be distinguished, yet joined by a personal Union of both
Natures in one Christ; there is no need of any additaments here to supply any
defect or imperfection, to adjoyn them unto Christ, and unto his Word-Doctrine:
the perfect Deity with all its glorious Attributes of Wisdom, Power and other
Excellencies inhabits in this Teacher, what need therefore is there to seek
other documentals or helps? can Philosophy instruct us, as Wisdom it self can
inform us? here the Plenitude of Deity resides as in a fixed and proper seat,
not a portion of the Godhead, as the gentile idolaters were falsely persuaded of
their false Gods, nor only some eximious gifts and graces of the Spirit, as in
Angels, Prophets, and their holy ones, but the true and perfect God with his
infinite unmatchableness: He himself indwells in this Humane Nature after a
peculiar way and manner, and barely by his Universal Presence and assistencie,
as he is in and with all things and places, to conserve and to sustain them;
neither only by a special efficacy of the Spirit, as he is in the Saints,
Sanctifying of Believers, and enriching them with distinguishing charisms, with
gracious endowments; but by a new mode of existing, though the nature of him,
who thus exists, remain the same, it is by subsistential Union personally, so
as that the inhabiting or assuming God becomes one with the inhabited, or
assumed Humane Nature; Romans 9. 5.

all, God blessed for ever: Esai. 7. 14. and 8. 10. Mat. 1. 23.

Jehovah too. If it be asked, Whether the raising up of the dead Body of a man
to life, and to the sameness of subsistency again be an incredible thing? Pagan
Philosophers have determined this contrary to the Truth, by asserting, that
from a privation to an habit there is no returning, no regress is to be granted
in such a case; whereas, the holy Scriptures do better teach us, that, the
resurrection of the dead is a facible thing, Acts 26. 8, 23. 1 Cor. 15.
a believeable matter, and that it is unreasonable to judge it incredible;
cannot an Almighty God do this? cannot he restore being, who gave being? Cannot
that Head, Christ, who raised himself from the dead, raise up his Members also?
Ethnic Logic is no fit judge of many Scriptural predictions, its Rules of
ratiocination cannot measure these Mysteries, such as, God is Man, The word was
made flesh, God with his blood redeemed the Church; these and such like high
Truths and Things, which are necessary for us to believe for our Eternal
Salvation, were hid from the Wise Ones of that age; for those Disparates here
do come and agree together affirmatively, God Eternal, the Creator of all
things, and he who existed before all time, was born in time: He who is
impassible, did suffer: The immortal one did die: A man sits at the right hand
of God: God who is All-fulness is emptied: The Omnipotent needs the help of a
Nursing-mother: The All-knowledge, All-wise one increased in Knowlede, and in
Wisdom: The Every-where-present one was included in his Mothers Womb: He, that
filled Heaven and Earth had not where to lay his head; He, that is transcending
the most general of all kinds, and of genus's, is made a corporal individual,
the lowest of all substances: He, who made others rich, was himself poor: The
Righteous one did justly bear both the fault and punishment of the unjust: Here
the LORD is made a servant, and the servant is a LORD: here the Mother is the
Daughter of her own Son, and the Son is Father of his own Father: Here is the
All-sufficient supplyer is himself ready: Here, contrary to the Ethnic
Physical Science, what was finite is made capable of what is infinite, and what
was infinite is circumscribed within narrow limits: Here a Virgin conceives
without Man: Here the body is born in one place, and is taken to him who is in
many places, in all places at once: Here the Common Arithmetic must seek out
new Rules; for, two are one, and one is two, in Christ; three are one, and one
is three, in Father, Son, and holy Spirit, being the Almighty Jehovah. What a
loss is Pagan Philosophy at in all these Mysteries, and in a multitude of more
that might be added? Men do never come on so far, as to the Job 28. 28. Psalm.

Who is as this wise man? he was one of the wisest men, even Solomon, that did
ask the question: It is a question expressive of the Truth, there is none that
compared to him does weigh equally in the Sanctuary-balance with him: would
thou know, who is he? it is he, and no other but he, that knows the
interpretation of a word; who can so give sorth the true sense of the word, in
its original significancy, as thereby to set out the right Nature of Things in
their proper beings.

There is in the Word of Christ full comprehensiveness, as of all other useful
Learning, so particularly, of the knowledge of Natural Things, of which it does
treat and speak purposely, and professedly.
HOw great a part of the holy Scriptures must be transcribed, who would write
out all that is in them, which does treat of this subject matter! Here is the
Genesis 1. throughout, and 2. 1, 2. 3.
History of the Creation originally and fully discovered, which is not so made
known in any, or in all the Books of Humane Authors, who, though speaking to
this particular point, yet are no further sound than as they speak and write
according unto this, and wherein they are sound, they have borrowed and fetched
from this; here they lighted their Candle, and from hence they have dug
their treasure. It is the special design, and the main purpose of some
particular passages in the holy Scriptures, expressly and plainly to open the
true state of Natural Things, as, the Book of Job, in a great part of it, many
of the Psalms, most of Ecclesiastes, besides much of this nature, which is
frequently scattered through this Book of books. How filled is this with
Jehovah Aelohim's essential Operations in all created Beings? whose
demonstrations are either, from the Creator, to the knowledge of the Creatures,
or from the Creatures to the knowledge of the Creator. Solomon was one of the 1

wisest of men, the LORD gave it to him so to be; and he spoke and wrote much
about Natural Things, concerning the Works of the several Days, particularly
Scripture-Physicks; he was excelling in the knowledge of Grass, of Herbs, of
Trees, of Beasts, of Fowls, of Fishes, of Creeping Things, of contemplating of
the Natural Body, of the Heavens, of the Earth, of the Seas, and of the Abyss;
out of his Writings much might be discovered of the nature of these, in his
Books of the Proverbs, of Ecclesiastes, and of his Song of Songs, incomparably
beyond what can be found in all the large Libraries of Ethnic Philosophers, or
any other Naturalists amongst such of the Christians, as have received their
appr^hensions about these things, out of those Pagan Rationalists, who yet are
great st^^ngers unto that which is the right Reason, and the true Nature of
these ^^ings; and so will they also be, who follow them without a
Scripture-guide. He, that will ask, what lawful necessary useful Art and
Science can be named, of which there is not that to be found in the Scriptures
of Truth, which, if thr^^^^ly understood and collected, and then applied and
improved in fitting in to (...) very Essence, and Operations of created Beings,
would bring a very considerable addition to sound profitable knowledge? and
whoever would undertake to return somewhat to satisfaction, by way of answer in
a multitude of particular instances Theoretick and Practick, such as Grammar,
Logic, Rhetoric, Mnemonick, Physics, Metaphysics, Mathematics,
Arithmetic, Geometry, Cosmography, Optics, Music, Astronomy, Geography,
Geodeticks, Staticks, Nauticks, Architecture, Schematicks, Ethics, Economicks,
Politics, History, Poesy, Ecclesiastics, Scholasticks, Chronology,
Chirography, Law, Theology, Christianity, Medicine in all the Botanick,
Anatomick, Pharmaceutick and Chirurgick parts of it, together with all the
Mechanics, which are more than I can reckon up, may easily and quickly
foresee, even by such an enumeration, as this is, that such an universal
comprehensive of all Liberal Sciences, afterward distinctly parcelled out into
the several knowledges professed and practiced, would both take up too much of
his time, and over-bulk any one Treatise, and is much beyond the skill and the
strength of any one mere man: One of our own has lately asserted a deficiency
in the Scriptures, as to these matters, and does send us elsewhere, for a
Supplement, mentioning several Arts and Sciences, as no where to be found in
Scripture: I shall single out two of them, which are of his own choosing and
naming, and then try them according to the Word, whether much of their Art be
not to be found out in the Scripture with a little search, which, when compared
with, and experimented by, the natural efficiency of their innate and educed
Existencies and Workings, would bring in an augment to their Science, thought
it be not my intendment, or undertaking to draw up Systems and Schemes of the
several particular knowledges, but to quicken up the studious and ingenious to
promote these Scientificks more by putting that together, which the Scriptures
do afford, relating to each of them, and then to work upon their discovery, by
practical improvement, and experimental observation: This Learned man declared
his judgment to be, that the Scripture is no perfect Rule for a Musician, a
Carpenter, a Physician, a Mathematician, an Astronomer, a Geographer, an
Arithmetician, a Grammarian, a Logician, a Natural Philosopher, etc. to do
their Work, Because, says he, it is not a particular Rule for them in Arts and
Sciences, the things whereof are not to be found in the Scripture at all:
neither does he assert the Scriptures an imperfect Rule, only for these and
such like as these, but also for Divines, and for Worshippers; as if the
Scripture did not tell the Divine sufficiently, and particularly diverse things
relating to his office, and the discharge of it; and as if the worshipper were
not to expect there particular Laws or Rules, for all the circumstances of
worship: Thus, and to this purpose he.

If it be not a perfect particular Rule for these two last mentioned, the
Divine, and the Worshipper; for what Artists and Scientiaries is it a perfect
particular Rule? For, these affirmations do charge the Scripture with being an
imperfect Rule (as to particular Laws and Rules) not only as to Natural Things,
but also as to Spiritual; it should be considered by such, who are of this
persuasion, whether they do not hereby lift up Church History, and Humane
Authority, in the matters of Faith, to the debasing and denying of
Scriputre-perfection, and also corrupt modes and forms of Worship, such as are
of Humane Invention, Institution and Imposition, exclusive of other ways of
Worship, where these are not asserted and consented to, both which the whole
Scripture does condemn? At this present, it being suited to the subject I have
in hand, about the advancement of useful Arts and Sciences, by making a more
through disquisition after them in the Word of Truth, I shall cull out two of
these Artists, who my self am of neither of their Arts, nor do I pretend to
have Scientificies in them; which may so far prove and praise this design the
more, that one, whose Calling and Function, whose Office and Profession is not
to be either Musician or Carpenter, yet in the supply of the holy Spirit, by a
little short study of the Scriptures, in the midst of a multitude of other
employments, can discover so much in Christ's Word about Music and Carpentry:
wherem I am to show, that these are found in the Scripture, both as to name and
thing; and that there is a Rule in the Scripture for these things; and that God
has made the Scripture to be a Rule for them; and that, in the Scripture there
are not only general Rules, but also particular Rules of those Arts and
Sciences; which done, I shall propound some inquiries about Geography and
Grammar. Some of the other Arts that are mentioned, I may have occasion to
treat somewhat of upon the particular Works of the particular Days, of the
first Week of the created World.

As for Music, the skilful therein will bear with me, if I do not in some of
my expressions so fully harmonize with their Terms of Art, as they have learned
and received them; I expect they should approve and forward the design, which
would raise their Ear-taking, and their Heart-affecting-knowledge in this to
more Sweetness and Savouriness, more Exactness and Spiritualness, more
Naturalness and Scripturalness, as relating to instituted Psalms and Hymns, and
Spiritual Songs, which are heavenly parts of Spiritual Worship, more especially
with respect to the voice: not at all to countenance the common abuse of this
Art, when it is suited to carnal, lustful hearts, in amorous wanton ditties, or
to other profane corrupt ends whatsoever, which has been in woeful, sinful
experience, a ruining enchantment to many a precious Soul, and a prodigal
wasting of that time, which should be redeemed: but, somewhat to revive the
Scriptureway of hymnifying, now in these times, of the approach of the
later-day glory, and to raise Spiritual Singing to its due Purity, whereby that
Ordinance may be restored and made edifying, which has been for several years,
either too coldly, and formally, and carnally performed, or else too much
omitted and neglected, what through mistakes in some men's judgments, and
through fears in other men's hearts, who have laid aside this duty, in times of
persecution, lest their own vocal Psalming should bewray their assembling to
the listning-enemy. Let my design and aim in what I express about this be well
remembered, that none may prevert to any ill use, what I am about to write (for,
it is too commonly a corrupt practice by two sorts of Extremists, where
cautionary bounds are set to any Science or Art, that, both of them do
causelessly take offense, and do occasion their own sin and trouble; one by a
superstitious conceit, thinks the cautionary bounds too large, and so will not
go so far as to come unto what is lawful, and a duty; the other by a profane
licenciousness condemns them as too narrow, and so steps too far by passing
over into what is unlawful, and a sin; the one will not allow the grant of the
Commissioned Science, the other will not observe the terms of it: However, I
have given due warning, at the Readers peril be it, if he transgress) though I
shall withal from out of the Scriptures open much of other parts of Music,
besides that of the voice under the Old Testament-dispensations. If the sound
of my words do not bring so sweet a modulamen to some critical Ears, yet the
generous-spirited will soon join in with me, in this melodious part, that I am
a friend to, an admirer of, I mean the sacred Bibliotheke, the
Scripture-Library; and it has been admitted, as one Rule in Musical Airs, that
then is the Air the more to be commended, when there is a pleasant passing by a
sudden fall, from a Discord upon a Concord: I have the well-consonanted voice,
both of Scripture and Nature which do cry this up, though the harsh-throated
opposers would noise it down.

There is no kind of voices in the World, which does not 1 Cor. 14. 7, 8, 9, 10
-- 15 -- 26.
signify somewhat by its sound; and that, with some distinctness, and separate
difference in tones: sounds are signs of certain things, as the sound of an
Ordinance-gun, of a drawn Saw, of bellowing Beasts, of howling Dogs, of a drawn
Chariot, of chirping Birds, of Musical Instruments, especially the sound of the
voice of man singing Scripture-Psalms, whose tongue in this harmonick, Heavenly
Ordinance should utter and send forth a well-signifying word, an intelligible
sound, that it be not speaking into the Air, but may be Coloss. 3. 16.
edifying. There is a Natural Music, which the Song 2. 12, 14.
little Birds, and the Turtle-Doves, have a skilfulness in with a grateful
sweetness, and a pleasant acceptableness, when they warble their tuneable Notes
in the Spring-Season: how melodious then will the Spiritual Airs of Spiritual
Singers be in the Spiritual Spring, when the Churches and People of Christ
shall bud and blossom, grow and bring forth Fruit in those glorious times of
the last days, as it is written by Esai. 24. 14, 36.
Esaias the Prophet, saying, They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing
for the Majesty of the LORD, from the utmost part of the earth have we heard
songs, glory to the righteous. Genesis 4. 21. Job 21. 12. and 32. 31.
The skilful Practitioners of Music have an honorable mention in the Holy
Records of Scripture-memorials, their praise is entered very early in the
word-register, even before the Flood. Instruments of Music were very ancient

some with breath which are blown, as Trumpes, Pipe and Organ; others there are
which do give forth a sound with touch and striking, as Harp, Lute and Viol:
there is somewhat in Nature, which does teach and instruct in the manner of
this; the Beating, the Palpitation, and the Pulsation of the heart in man, does
direct to the manner, measure and spaces; so also does the souls way of
breathing in and out, which does sometimes rise or fall, or is midly-even
according to Musical Art: they were of use in Job's time, and we hear of their
sweet sound then. (...) Nagan, Psalm. 33. 2, 3. (...) Neginah.
There is an Hebrew word, which does signify, to beat, or to play upon a
Musical Instrument, and from thence is derived another word, which does
signify a song, conceit, modulation, harmony, a verse, consonancy; it is the
exciting of a symphonious sound; in one conjugation, the verb does set out the
moving of a sound with artificial ingeniousness: In the passive voice it
denotes, skilfully to beat the Strings, or to strike the Chords; in the active
it is taken of the voice of man, striking the Organs of Speech, the Throat, the
Palate, the Tongue, the Teeth, the Lips, which are this Natural Instruments of
Music; (and so also the voice of (...) Organum Musicum, quasi amabile dictum.

another Hebrew word, which does signify more properly Wind-Instruments,
managed by the wind or breath, Wind-Instruments which do make a noise like a
Torrent, or like the humming bomb of Bees, so that this also has something in
Nature. 1. Cor. 14. 10. (...).
There is somewhat of Articulateness in every voice and sound; in man's created
Nature, there are such Instruments of pronunciation, as that thereby Languages
also have somewhat in them that is natural, which Languages are therefore
called Tongues, because the Tongue is a principal Member in forming the sound,
and in harmonizing the tones; for it is an Instrument with Strings, and many
Muscles, and by acuteness and gravity it has several degrees of rising and
falling from one tone or note to another: So that melodious man is a kind of
Organ, having his Lungs as Bellows to supply him with Breath, and his aspera
arteria as a Channel to collect, and to conveigh that Breath, the Larynx gives
passage to the breath through the Rimula, and makes a Vibration of those
Cartilaginous bodies, whereby the breath is formed into vocal sound, which by
the Arch of the Palate, or Roof of the Mouth, as the Shell of a Lute, is
sweetened, augmented and modulated, and accented into a tuneableness, either
raising the voice, or passing it into a graceful cadence, or keeping it in a
middle tune: even brute Animals have a significant Artificialness in their way
of making of diverse sounds with their voice, whereby they understand one
another, when they call, or when they give warning, when they cherish, when
they are displeased, when they threaten, and such like; but I am now to speak
of created Nature in man, passing into the Musical Art by a
Scripture-Directory. Exodus 15. 20.
God's Israel of old did use Musical Instruments, when he brought them out of
Egypt, and gave them that wonderful deliverence at the red Sea; how pleasantly
did these sound when Moses's Song was sung! The Exodus 19. 13, 16. 19. and 20.

Sinai, Numb. 10. 2, 8, 9, 10.
the Priests were by prescribed order to blow with these Trumpets over the
burnt Offerings and Sacrifices: Holy David afterward, as he was directed by
the Spirit of Aelohim, made Hymns and Songs, and caused Cymbals, Harps and
Psalteries, to be fitted, that the Levites in their courses might sing and play
continually in the Sanctuary: O how much was this the heavenly delight of that

thought of Tzijon, when they hung up their Harps upon the Willows, and instead
of singing they howled, and instead of playing on Instruments, they did beat
their Breasts, when they would not gratify a scoffing Enemy that deridingly
called for one of the Songs, or Hymns, or Psalms of the Temple. When the second
Temple was built at Jerusalem, their cheerful hearts quickly find their Voices
and Instruments, their mouths and hands soon recover their skill, and Ezra. 3.

of such kinds of Instruments! Some were (...) Shelishim. 1 Samuel 18. 6, 7.

six-stringed, and there was a Psalm to the Tune of sixes, a new Song of high
praises put into the mouths of spiritual Virgins, an heavenly Hymn setting
forth Christ in his Glory, and the Church his Spouse in her Beauty: this is a
Lilly-tune (a Flower of six leafs) yielding a fair modulation, a pleasant sound
to the Ear, as that Flower is lovely to the Eye; and of all such kinds of Arts,
the advancers of Humane Learning, for Arts of pleasure do count, that those do
best and truest deserve the name of Liberal Arts, which do most gratify these
two senses, the Eye and the Ear; for the Eye, they commend stately Buildings,
flourishing Gardens, comely Beauty, well-fashioned Garments, rich Gemms,
sparkling Diamonds, and such like; for the Ear, they are much in the praises of
Music, as very delightful to that sense, when set out with the affecting
variety of Voices, Airs and Instruments, well prepared, and harmoniously
suited: the Arts here are more choice and skilful, and do so the better agree
with those two senses, which are more chaste, and less sensual: In the Title of

another Psalm, this six-stringed Instrument has a word joined to it, which
does signify Exodus 40. 5. 20.

the two Tables of the Law, called the Testimony. In singing there should be a

another word, which is fatness, oil for its fatness; it is a full, a fatning
tune, it sweetly nourishes, it makes cheerful, it satiateth, it satisfies,
the serious spiritual Singer; there is a sweetened affluence in it, a favoury
ointment. An eight is the full complete number for Tunes, as ten is for Laws,
and seven for days; although the original ground for Eights being the full
complete number for Tunes, is not so properly from eight, but from seven; for
when seven Notes are over, the eighth does begin another sevenny. The word does
further acquaint us with an Psalm. 33. 2. and 92. 3. and 144. 9. (...)

cut-song, and was first played on the Musical Instrument, then sung with a
cut-voice. It would fill up a large Treatise, to write particularly of all and
every of the several Instruments in the Musical Art, which are spoken of in
Scripture; and this does give me to discern so much, that if all the Hebrew
words were examined, together with all Roots and Branches, in their full
significancy, and if also all the Hebrews Phrases were skilfully understood,
and wisely applied by some experienced holy Musician, that this discovery would
bring a considerable augment to this Science, and be a great improvement of
this knowledge: I have not done with this as yet, though it may be the Reader
here was under some apprehension, that I was now closing up of this discourse
on this subject; it is a practical-Rhetorick-trope in the Music Art, to slide
softly, and to fall gently from the close or cadence (to speak in their own
Phrase and Dialect) when it seemed even to touch it; it is such a sweet
beguiling of the hearers expectation, that it renews a raised affection, and
revives a listning-ear, to what may be further sung or said, played or struck;
this little quavering upon a stop, may give some delight to the Musical Reader.
For the promoting of this melodious acoustick-Art, let me therefore refer to
some Scriptures about Musicians and Musical Singers, about the pleasant Voice,
and singing Notes, and concerning Psalms, and Songs, and Hymns, for matter and
for verse, as relating to instituted Worship, both under the Old and the New
Testament ministrations of Grace. There were Nehem. 12. 27, 20.
Musicians in Nehemiah's time, when he became a Reformer, and brought this, as
many other things to institution, according to that dispensation; for we read
of sons of the Musicians, or sons of the Singers, such as were trained up both
to vocal and to instrumental Music, who by exercise were to grow up to be
skilful in this Art, by such external expressiveness, to give resounding
Testimonies of their inward thankfulness, and their hearty rejoicing. 2. Sam.
19. 35. 2 Chronicles. 35. 25. Exodus 15. 1, 20. 21. 1 Samuel 18. 6, 7.
These were Men-singers and Women-singers, these joining in Symphony do make
the Voice the sweeter, the Airs the pleasanter, and the sound the more
melodious: Some do apply a passage in Solomon's Eccles. 2. 8. Shiddah and
Shiddoth. (...) Symphonia. Instrumentum Musicum, quod suavitate conceptus
permulcer ac perme at totum huminem. (...) in Ara^. thiore voce cecinit carmen.
Ecclesiastes to this, as choice delights of the sons of men, Music of all
sorts, vocal of men and of women, and instrumental, which is signified by the
gemination of the word, Music simple, and in consort; those, who would
interpret it for captived beautiful woman taken in War, should consider, that
Solomon was a man of peace, and not of war: as for delighting himself with
Music, 1 King. 10. 12. 2 Chronicles 9. 11.
other Scriptures do speak of this, and it was such, as none such was seen
before in the Land of Judah; there are that do interpret that place; Symphony
and Symphonies, Voices equal and unequal, alike and alike, similar and
contrary, so breaking one another with such a grateful mixture, and sweet
temperament, that does sound forth a wellcomposed Melody, and such a discordant
concord, as yet does well agree in tune. The Voices of skilful women-singers,
being naturally clearer and sweeter than those of men, do add a graceful
melodiousness, when in Airy fellowship with them: we may in some Scriptures
hear them pleasantly joined together; thus, Exodus 15. 1, 20, 21.

forth the Glory of their Savior, the Honor of their Redeemer. 1 Chronicles. 25. 6,

These holy Singers, and heavenly Musicians were distributed into certain
orders, concerning which there were diverse Rules and Laws from Christ in his
Word, according as the manner of dispensing was in that day, which, if rightly
understood, and well applied, would much inlighten and increase this Art, and
also direct and instruct us, who are now under a more spiritual, glorious and
heavenly Administration, in many raised duties, frames and actings; for by not
searching more after the inward mystical signified sense and meaning of those
and of other institutions under the former Dispensation, there are many
Doctrines, Laws and Privileges, Graces, Duties and Enjoyments, which the most
Professors of Christianity do much hide from themselves, and from others, at
the least these are not so clear unto them. These holy Singers are denoted, by
their being such 1 Chronicles. 6. 31. and 25. 1, 6. Neh. 12. 24. 2 Chronicles. 34. 12.

as were constituted to the Musical Ministry, in the House of Jehovah Aelohim,
by such as prophesied with Harps, with Psalteries, and with Cymbals, which kind
of Music was then incumbent upon them to use; by such as were appointed to
praise, and to celebrate by the command of David, that man of God; for such
Singers were instituted to celebrate Jehovah with Musical Instruments. There

Prefect of Singers, a Praecentor, one who went before, and was above in the
Music, to whom Psalms were given, that they might be publicly sung, directed
to him that was to excel others in this skill, who had anthority over other
Musicians, and whose office it was to sing victorious overcomings, and exulting
triumphings, he was chief in the Song to form the Tunes and Notes to urge, to
incite, and to direct others to continue the singing work till it was carried
on unto the end: These Psalms and Songs were to the Master of Symphonie, who
was set over the rest, and did overcome in Music by his Voice, and they were
sung to the praise of Messiah, that Commander in chief, the great Conqueror,
the lovely One, the beloved of the Father: this Chanter was to be eminent in
the singing Ability, and musical Art, he was the principal Song-master, who was
to stir up, and to lead on those that were under his teaching, inspection and
government, pressing to that sweet-sounding work, till it was completed: Nehem.

There were Primary and Secondary of their holy Singers; some were Tuners of
the Psalms and Hymns, who first began the Song, Heads of the Singers, and of
the Song of Praise, and of thanksgiving unto Aelohim, over seers of the rest: 1 Chronicles. 25. 7. 8. 2 Chronicles. 34. 12.
Those who were more skilful and expert in the Musical Art, are called Doctors
or Teachers of it: Revel. 14. 2, 3, 4.

Singing is properly with the Voice; there is a vocal Music, with Voice lift
up, that the Voice might be heard, and others might be quickened; this is
foretold to be in the later days, they shall then lift up their voice; this is,
to sing with a raised breaking of the Voice. Gnalamoth (...) Psalm. 46. 1. 1 Chronicles. 15. 20. Musica acutae vocis, virgine^e, ut est musicorum superior and

Ascending, they were Songs raised to a degree of height, sung with an high
voice, as is said of some Levites, that they praised Aelohim with a great voice
to on high: these were Psalms of Degrees, because they were sung with various
and distinct tones, with an high voice, and with an acute sound, a pleasant
kind of melody: They have their Title to be Songs of Ascension, or of Goings,
or of Heights, sung with high and gradual Notes of Music in a raised tone.
There was a princely Leader in this Exaltation or Elevation: these Songs had
some Excellency of Dignity, to raise believers up into an Heavenly
harmoniousness. The LORD has by the constitution, the forming, the framing of
those parts given such Ears unto some men, as are more 2 Samuel 19. 34. 35.

Musicians in Hebrew* have a Name, which do set out their quavering and singing
division, exercising diverse kinds of Song, with broken tones and short verse;
it has the signification of parting, breaking, or falling off, as when
particular Grapes are broken, and do fall off from the cluster in the Vintages
(For Git tith. Psalm. ^. Psalm. 81. Psl. 84. the Titles. 2 Samuel 6. 6, 10, etc.
there was an Instrument or Tune to sing Jehovah's praises at the Vintages,
when Grapes were gathered and pressed; there was a lively vocal tuning and
singing at that time of the year, occasioned it may be from the carrying of the
Ark of Jehovah from the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite, the son of Jedutbun,
who was a Levite, and a singer in Israel) From hence it is applied unto such,
as do sing and chant, and do accommodate all the words of the Song apart,
minutately, and in the several particularities of it, to some Musical
Instrument with concise Voices, and with a vibrant and frequentate sound, which
Musicians from the Chord do call the the Fifth; for, there is a Musical
harmoniack proportion, where the number of syllables and of tones is one less
than another, the numbers therein having the same proportions one to another,
which are found to be in Musical Consorts; as Six, Four and Three; for, the
proportion which Six has to Four is containing one and an half, called of the
Musicians; of Five, or a Fifth, and the proportion which Four has to Three, is
that which does contain as much as another, and a third part more, called of
the Musicians, of Four, or a Fourth, a Musical measure, consisting of two
tones, and a lesser half tone; and the proportion which Six has to Three, is
double twice so much, called an Eight, or a Concord in Music of All; Selah

anciently and more purely they reckoning their tones and notes by Numbers, so
that a skilful Musician should be an Artist in Arithmetic, and in Geometry
too: there is a word in Hebrew often used in the Book of Psalms, which is taken
by many for a Note of Music, importing such a Song or Tune, as is going first
deeply down to the lowest Note, then rising up to the highest Note, as may be
seen in the Marginal Notes of eight Descensions with their A Cipher is, a *
Note, either above one, or below eight, which in many tunes has a great
gracefulness in the sound.
Ciphers, and eight Ascensions with their Ciphers, which is the old plain way
of singing, and which any tunable voice may with ease by practice get a
considerable knowledge of, and skill in, and may quickly compose very
harmonious Tunes, and melodious Airs for spiritual Songs, either by himself, or
with others: These Modulants did vary the sound in Song many ways, using diverse
distinctions of Tones, Modules, and Numbers; this does set out the sweet Airs,
and the pleasant Measures in the harmonious variableness of Tunes; they did

exhilerate themselves, please, delight themselves upon, or over the mouth, or
concent, or harmony of the Psaltery, that Musical Instrument; for the Root in
the Original significancy, is, he exhilerated specially, he made glad or
joyful, he delighted peculiarly; hence a Noun signifying a Grape from its
exhilerating Virtue, chearing the Heart and Mind, it has an emphatical note
before it, in the Scripture referred unto. The word Selah, either from (...)
prostravit, quasi vocis Sternandae and remittendae Symbolum, notans communem
Pausam, in qua omnes aequibili and temperato concentu quasi sternebantur and
pausabant, non tam moderarae interspirationis, quam gravis cujusdam suavitatis
causa. Or from (...) extulit, exaltavit. Elevationem significat, quod ibi
cantores vocem elevarunt. The word is used about seventy times in the Book of
Psalms, and thrice in the prophecy by Habakkuk.
Selah, formentioned in the Margin, does set out, both the manner of singing,
and also the frame of the heart, how it should be inwardly affected, whilst it
outwardly puts forth the voice, in this sweet sounding Ordinance: it may be
taken, either from a word, which does signify he threw down, or did lay low
and level, and equal with the ground; and so it will import the falling of the
Note, and the deep Humiliation of the heart of self-abasement, the casting down
of Spirit and Mind, or the laying of the Soul low, even as low as the dust,
before Jehovah Aelohim, a self-emptying humiliation, joined with a lowly,
humble and submissive Meditation, and serious consideration of the matter sung:
or it may spring from another Root, which does signify, he lifted up, or he
exalted; thus it imports exaltation or elevation; and so taken, it is a Note
of lifting up the voice, and of the heart and mind, the soul and spirit,
together with the voice in the prasing and extolling Jah, to exalt him highly:
These two Notes and Psalms do well agree, for we never exalt Jehovah Aelohim
more highly, than when we lay our selves most low; and the voice in singing
hereby also becomes the fairer, the sweeter, and the pleasanter: how grateful
are such elevations of the voice to an harmonious strain; and of the mind to an
heavenly pondering? There is Higgaion. (...) Psalm. 9. 16. and 92. 3.
another word sometimes joined with this, which does signify a silent, serious
Meditation within the Heart, underneath the tuneable Voice. Singers together
should be conciliated, and united among themselves by Symphony, and a Concent
of Voices with consent: this is the opening of the Song by its minute parts, to
divide it with the warbling Voice cut in Notes and Tunes, with a brandishing
sound, in repeated syllables and words, peasantly rising and falling in the
harmonious modulation, to which the moved pulsed strings of the Nebel. (...)

by answering repetes; and this was the manner of singing of some Psalms, when
the same words which do close a foregoing part of a Spiritual Hymn, are
answeringly repeated at the end of every due pause of that Song; this is the
staff or cadency, containing a matter seriously and frequently to be meditated
and whetted; it makes the Tune melodious, and was used at some seasons upon
special occasions, Jam. 5. 13. Psalm. 106. 12. compare Numb. 21. 17. with Isai.

their belief in him, and their thanfulness toward him, setting out the holy
spiritual gladsomeness that the faithful have, and do enjoy in Christ: This was
by answering in the Song; when one did sing: Thus they sung at the Red Sea, the
women after the men; and thus are they called upon, Answer, ye (in singing) to
Jehovah with Confession. There is an use, which the Hebrew-accents are put unto
in singing; for, they do in part design the Music, and they have respect unto
the Song; it is an help and direction to the well-sounding of words: Buxtorf.

Semi-quaver.
These Accents do serve for the right pronunciation of every word, and for the
rising or falling of the sound of the Syllables: The Jews, in their usual
reading of the Hebrew Text, have a way of singing it out. The Accents do
distinguish a Sentence into certain Members, and proper Parts, and Clauses of
it, showing the Pauses, and the manner of taking breath between them, how many,
or how few Pulses there should be. Were there more skill in Tonick, Euphonick,
Music, Accents, Hebrew words would have much more of a sweet and a pleasant
sound, of a clear and satisfying sense: Hence the Accents in the Hebrew have
got Tagnammim.

There is Scripture Song, by the significancy of its name, that is, a Song of

enjoyed their God in them, and themselves in him, when they thus seemed or err,

Spiritual Singing is expressive of great Joy; this singing will be to ever, to
hidden age. I judge it to be one cause of the great sadness that is upon the
spirits and hearts of many professing the right Worship of God in the present
day, that they exercise themselves no more in this heavenly Ordinance by Hymns
suited to their respective Cases, the holy Scriptures affording them such
pleasant veriety of proper matter, which by an ordinary gift of the Spirit, the
LORD, may soon be done into apt Song; here are noble arguments and princely
subjects, about which the highest Learning, and the choicest Eloquence may try
their skill, and prove their Art: those, who will exercise their Wits and Pens
in Poetry, may here find that, which would make them to excel; here is enough
for such to utter their Poems in their Musical Studies, for the publishing of
the glorious perfections that are shining forth with splendid Beauty in Jehovah
Aelohim himself, and in his Word and Works; thus may they shoutingly sing with

As for the right performance of singing, according to the Word in experience,
it should be a singing in Aelohim, in the shadow of his wings with
exhilerating: For, the Song of Aelohim is put for joy, and should be used with
greatness of joy upon special occasions and seasons; as one part of sanctifying
a Festival day; as, when an holy Marriage is solemnized; and after a Victory is
obtained; the Daughters of Tzijon are sometimes expressly mentioned to bear
their part in triumphant Song: Therefore is the Song sometimes put for joy, and
for gladness; the tongue of Saints should be filled with such Song: To sing to
Jehovah Aelohim, is to praise him with joy. There is, in the particular cases,
that Believers are exercised withal, somewhat that is more especial of and in
Jeh^vah, which should be more the matter of their Song, as, his bounteous
kindnesses, his Strength, his Justice, his Praise-worthiness, his Word, his
Greatness, his Holiness, in the midst of his Israel, the Works of his Hands,
his Name, his Ways, his Gloriousness, his LORD-ship: Hence it is, that Jehovah
Aelohim is said, to be the Song or Verse of the singing Saint; his Song is with
such; it is he, who does give them argument-matter of Songs; he puts a new Song
in their Mouth, this is the voice of singing; such praisers of him are called
Singers; they are Preachers, Publishers of his Praises, setting out the
narrations of some notable remarkable thing, some matter of great and of
weighty moment, that which is worthy and fit to be in the mouths of all: To
sing is sometimes, to profess, to testify, to promise. Prove. 25. 22. 1 Samuel

hence the Kings had their Men-singers, and their Women-singers to delight
themselves with; thus it was in God's Israel with David and with Solomon, and
thus also with other Princes. Seeing the holy Scriptures are so full of this,

neglected of late years? Ephesians. 5. 19. Coloss. 3. 16. 1 Cor. 14. 15. Psalm. 57.

To Psalm or to Psalm, is, to sing holy Songs to the Honor of the adored
Almighty, especially in Church Assemblies for mutual edification: thus to Psalm,
or to sing, is joyfully to praise, and to celebrate Jehovah, and to give him
thanks for benefits received: to sing to Aelohim, does signify the same thing;
or, to sing to the Name of Aelohim; or, to sing the Glory of the Name of
Jehovah Aelohim, A Psalm more properly is taken for an holy Song: Thus, the
holy Spirit did gift some with the ability of composing spiritual Cantions,
fitted for ^ Church-assembles and Meetings; David was one of the most pleasant
excelling Psalmists. That Book which is called in the New Testament, by way of
eminency and excellency, the Book of Psalms does mostly contain David's holy
Songs: this part of Scripture has the name of the Book of Psalms: one of the
Psalms, which is throughout a celebration of the praise of Jehovah Aelohim, was
this Title, Hymns or praises to or of David, or the beloved: The inscription of
many other Psalms is properly a Psalm or Song, cut with Art in Musical Notes or
Tunes; this Book is also denoted by, The Psalms; for, the LORD Jesus Christ
does in one place divide the Scriptures of the Old Testament into, the Law of
Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms, because this Book of Psalms is much the
Flower of all the Prophetical Books, named therefore apart from the Books of
the Prophets, although that expression, if extended larger, do comprehend all
the musical metrical Books, of Job, of the Book of Psalms, of the Proverbs, of
Ecclesiastes, of the Song of Songs, and what other Songs in the Old Testament.
The great Inspirer, and Inditer of these Psalms, is Jehovah Aelohim, more
particularly, and especially, as to this, The holy Spirit, who used Moses,
David, Solomon, Isaiah, and others, to be the Writers and Penmen of Psalms.
The subject matter of the Book of Psalms, is various upon several occasions,
suited to practical Cases in experimental Religion: Those of them which are of
more special note, Luke 24. 44.
are Prophesies concerning Christ, this Book being often cited in the New
Testament to this purpose (which are enclosed in a Parenthesis in the Margin a
little before) as also Prophecies relating to the later-days-glory: this Book
of Psalms is of very profitable use, not only in respect of reading, but also
as to singing: Ezra. 3. 10. 2 Chronicles. 7. 6. and 29. 30.
these holy Songs were much in the mouths of the believing Jews. The words of
David and of Asaph were Psalms written by David and Asaph, to be sung by the
Levites to the honor of Jehovah Aelohim: Ephesians. 5. 19. Coloss. 3. 16. Psalm.
119. 172. (...) respondebit, cantabit, cantando laudabit.
they are also useful matter for Christians to sing under the New Testament
dispensation of Grace; though Psalms in those Scriptures last cited in the
Margin do further note other holy Scriptural Cantions; 1 Cor. 14, 15, 16, 19.
holy Singing being still a Duty in our public Church Assemblies, Psalmodie in
a Congregation of Believers must be in a known tongue; Psalm. 81. 2. and 98. 5.
Isai. 51. 3.
Psalmodie is sometimes put for Musical Instruments, with which Jehovah Aelohim
was praised; or, for the Psalm and Song which was sung to his praise joined to
the Musical Instrument: it is therefore called the Voice of a Psalm, because
these two in that day went together: sometime a Psalmodie voice is put for
great joy and gladness. There are some Songs, which are Esai. 24. 8. 9. Jer. 7.
34. Ezekiel. 26. 13.
proper and peculiar to a people; the Jews had such, so the Tyrians, and the
Tarfenses: there is a Eccles. 7. 5. Amos 6. 4, 5, 6. 1 Chronicles. 28. 12, 13, 19,
21. 2 Chronicles. 20. 25. 1 Chronicles. 16. 4. and 25. 6.
Song of Fools; of these kind of Singers, at their merry-mad-meetings, and
there profane revelling-banquetings there are but too many, minuting and
mincing, breaking and quavering their Voice, with their Drillo's on the Mouth
of the Lute or Psaltery, and devising to themselves Instruments of Music, like
David, abusing that to their carnal disport, and luxurious pastime, which he
invented and instituted at the Word of Jehovah, according to the pattern of all
that which was was with him by the Spirit, which he made him to understand in
writing by his hand upon him. Psalm. 137. 3. Amos 8. 3, 10. 1 Chronicles. 25. 7.
There are Songs of Tzijon, called Songs of the Temple, and Songs of Aelohim:
and there are Songs at Amos 5. 23. and 8. 3, 10.
corrupt idolatrous worship; even the superstitious will do somewhat of the
external part of this natural Duty: 2 Samuel 1. 19. 2 Chronicles. 35. 25. 2 Samuel 23.
1, 2, etc.
There is a Funeral Song; when the day of David's own death drew near, he
sweetly sang himself into visions and enjoyments of the Heavenly Glory: The
Song of Solomon. 1 King. 4. 32.
There is one Book, which is named, The Song of Songs, a chief, a choice, an
excelling Song, setting out the Beauties of Christ, and of his Spouse, and
sounding forth the Mutual, Spiritual Espousals, and Communion between him and
his Church, of all his one thousand and five Songs one of the most singular:
Exodus 15. 1. 2, 3, etc. compare with Rev. 15. 3. Deuteronomy. 31. 19. and 32 chapter Numb.
21. 17. Deuteronomy. 26. 3, etc. Judge. 5. 1, 2, etc. 1 Samuel 2. 1, etc. 2 Samuel 22. 1,
etc. Psalm. 18. 1, etc. Song of Sol. Psalm. 45. Esal. 5. ^1, etc. and 26. 1, etc.
and 27. 1, etc. and 12. 1, etc. and 38. 20. Habak. 3. 1, 2. etc. Luke 1. 46,
47, 48, 68, etc. Luke 2. 28, etc. Mat. 26. 30. Psalm. 22. 22. Pleb. 2. 12. Esai.
6. 3. 13, 14. Revel. 4. 8. and 5. 9. and 7. 9, 10. and 15. 3. and 19. 1 -- 7.
There is an holy Song, the Scripture-Records have a many of these sacred
Hymns. The LORD Christ himself sung an Hymn, in the midst of the Church,
Convention, Convocation, Assembly, or Congregation did he sing praise of and to
his Father from-with-him; and the blessed Angels are holy heavenly Singers; how
delightful is this Duty, and how pleasant is this melody, when the
harmonious-heart, and warbling tongue, do frame and tune aright in this
privilege! how healthful are these sweet Aromatic heavenly Airs for the New
Creature to breath in! the tongue is then much a believing Glory, when, with
other Organs of Speech, it does its part in articulate, vocal singing. Is this
so much the language of that better, that heavenly Country? and should not
Believers be well skilled in this, whilst they are here below in a strange
Land, that when they pass into the upper world of glorified ones, they may
forthwith join in so melodious an harmony? what? a Saint, and go on from day to
day in an untunable distemper? There is a Psalm. 33. 3. and 40. 3. and 96. 1.
and 98. 1. and 144. 9. and 249. 1. Isai. 42. 10. Rev. 5. 8, 9. and 14.
New Song, which the new created ones in the last days will more experimentally
and skilfully sing; and there are spiritual Songs suited to the present
Administration of Grace, which is a glorious Ministration of the Spirit. An
Ephesians. 5. 19. Coloss. 3. 16. 2 Chronicles. 7. 6. Mat. 26. 30. Mar. 14. 26. Acts 1^.
25.
Hymn is, holy Verse, sung to the praise of Aelohim: containing his
excellingly-commendable perfections in himself, and his special loving
kindnesses to his people: Paul and Silas sung an Hymn in a prison, and it is
one of Christ's requirements of Believers now, that they should sing Hymns and
Psalms: their Songs must be Spiritual, the Holy Spirit exciting and directing
this Ordinance, which is to sound forth spiritual matters, respecting God's
Glory, Ephesians. 5. 19. Closs. 3. 16.
and mankind's Salvation, Word-songs fetched from thence; not the scurrilous
Ballads of the profane, not the drolling songs of the Drunkards, nor the
Poematick Ditties of Pagans, nor the rounds and catches of cracking Fools over
their pots and cups, nor the wanton Verses of lustful Amoroso's, nor the false
stories, and idle tales of wandering fancies; but songs sung in Grace with the
affection of gratitude, and a thankful mind, carried on with a graceful
dexterity, so as that at once they may both please and profit, delight and
edify, the hearers of and joyners in it; and they must be Psalm. 57. 8, 9. Luke
1. 46, 47.
in the heart, from intimous affect there, going along with the harmonious
Voice, that the outward voice may profess the inward exultation; and all this
must be unto the Lord, not as Ethnicks, who would decorate their false and
dunghill idol-gods, by singing Hymns unto them, nor as common Fiddlers and
Bag-pipers, who make a sharking trade to themselves, by serving the lustful and
the idle humor of vain men; but celebrating the due praises of a God in
Christ, of Jehovah in Father, Son and holy Spirit. Away then with all nugatory
versifyings, and pure cantilenes, with rebounding bellowings, and unedifying
noises; and let this holy Institution be reduced to its regular use, in an
artificious suavity, Psalm. 104. 35. and 105. 45. and 106. 1, 48. and 111. 1.
and 112. 1. and 113. 1, 9. and 116. 19. and 135. 1, 21. and 146. 1, 10. and
147. 20. and 148, 1, 14. and 149. 1, 9. and 150. 1, 6. Rev. 19. 1, 3, 4, 6.
Halelu-jah is an Hebrew compounded word, signifying, Praise-ye-Jah, Him who is
Being its self, truly and indeed subsisting, the Being of beings, a glorious
self-Existence, having his Rev. 1. 4. Amos 2. 4. Jer. 10. 15. Acts 14. 14. 1
Cor. 8. 4.
Being of himself, and giving a being to all other things, to all his
Creatures, putting an existence into every Word of his by his Works, making
every promised Mercy, and threatened Judgment to be the very same thing in
experience, which the Scriptures of Truth do speak it to be in the Revelation,
in opposition to all imaginary idol gods, that they are lies, vanities, and
nothings: Jah is one of the great Names of God, and Halelu-jah is the song of
triumphing Saints: in the Old Testament it is often used, and that much in a
prophetical way with respect to the last days, when it will well become the
thankful mouths of those honored Saints, in whom so much of Christ's delight
is: if it be so sweet now in the Prophecy; O then, how satisfying will it
hereafter be in the fulfilling! for, the New Testament is no stranger to it.
Where this voice is either Initial or Final, put either at the beginning or at
the end of a Psalm, there it is rather to be retained, as it is in the Hebrew,
than to be rendered in other Languages, in its compounded significancy, and
should be understandingly used as an Acclamation or Exhortation, for, so it
does note. Psalm. 119. and 95. 2.
Psalms are sometimes taken for most graceful and sweet things, which do give
unto a spiritual singer ample matter of holy Joy, and of heavenly delight; at
times also they are put for matter or argument, stirring up to sound forth, and
to preach abroad the praises of Aelohim. Col. 3. 16. Isai. 27. 2, 3,
The holy Scriptures are plentifully stored, with choice matter for holy
versifying, with precious subjects for spiritual songs; where the LORD has
bestowed the gift of Tongues, of Art, and of Eloquence, the Musical
Scientiaries may try and improve their skill herein; the Metrical Versifiers,
and the Tonick Artists, may here find enough about which to exercise their
hymnifying Meditations: The Psalmist made his Pen to take many a pleasant walk
this way, expatiating in the praises of the most High, which he has published
in holy Writ: O what savoury commendations of Jah, and of the Word, and Works,
and People of Jah were there that came from him. Isai. 12. 2.
Jehovah is the Strength and the Salvation of his people, and he is their Song
with Voice cut in Notes and Tunes; they shall yet Revel. 15. 3. Exodus 15. 1.
etc. Numb. 21. 17. Deuteronomy. 31. 19, 21, 22, 30, etc. chapter 32.
sing (so as to celebrate with Verse) the Song of Moses, the servant of God,
and of the Lamb. This instituted Ordinance will recover its life and beauty in
the later days, and it shall yet again appear in its luster, and sound in its
melodiousness. 1 Chronicles. chapter 25. and chapter 26. and 23. 30. 2 Chronicles. 5. 12, 13. and

This quickening Institution was of old a part of Evening, and of
Morning-worship, such delight did the LORD and his Saints take therein; these
Birds of Paradise had their chirping seasons every day, when they tuned up
their pleasant Notes, though at other times upon special occasions their sweet
voice was heard, but these were stated and constant: when will tunable souls
recover, use and improve their right to this privilege, and set it up as
Church and Family Worship? The over-sticking unto old Translations, which have
not some ways been such exact versions, and to former ill tendrings in many
places in their Rhythmical composures, and the not-making of a discreet choice
of apt matter to suit the Psalm to the present subject, season and providence,
and the flat, formal, dull, dead performance of this Duty, has been a
temptation unto some to lay it wholly aside, though this were their error:
when Rhythms are so affected, as to obsure the sense, and the making of the
last syllables in sound, has made the several sentences joined together, not so
well to agree in significancy, and in sense, it has hurt this Ordinance, by
running it into a number Poetical, besides the Rule Scriptural. There is a
natural, spiritual measure of words in respect of the metrical style, and the
versifying form of them, which would afford a very useful Musical Art, were it
more according to the Word, wherein the refined discerning of the Acoustick
sense, or Hearing faculty, would raise this Science to higher Honor, and more
profitable practicalness, and be able to pass a better judgment upon it, than
the unscriptural Precepts of this Art, as managed by the most, can ever
experimentally teach: not only the measures of words in Verses, but the several
kinds of Verses should be so exactly suited, as best to fit, and most sweetly
to answer the subject matter in hand: As variety, both of kinds of Verses, and
of changes of Tunes, does sweetly affect, so also does the aptness, both of the
kinds, and of the Tunes; for, some of both these do more properly become
confessions of praise in Laudatories, others confessions of sin in humble
acknowledgement, some others are more for lamentation, other some are more for
admiring, exalting, and adoring, some are more to draw forth Acts of Grace, to
encourage Faith, Hope, Love, Humility, Joy, Patience, and such like, others are
more for Petition and Prayer; with much more, which a serious researcher into
Scripture might find out: If some other men have perverted the true Nature of
this Musical Art, we should, in this age of attempts to advance Learning, be
perfecting of it (as of other useful Arts, and profitable Sciences) according
to the Word. 1 Cor. 14. 15, 26.
There is a gift of the Spirit in composing of Scripture-Hymns and Psalms, and
spiritual Songs in the purer Churches of the later days, which shall be
restored to its right use: Those Ephesians 5. 17, 18, 20. and Col. 3. 16, 17.
spiritual Songs, which are so commanded and commended to us, in the New
Testament, are such Songs as are suited 2 Cor. 3. 6. 11. and 1 Cor. 14. 15.
Philip. 3. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 5. 1 Cor. 9. 11. Romans 8. 5, 15, 26, 27. 1 Cor. 2. 12,
13, 14, 15. Romans 1. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 1. and 14. 1, 15. Col. 1. 9. and 3. 16. Heb.
8. 5. and 9. 23.
to the heavenly-glorious New Testament, Ministration of the Spirit: as every
other Ordinance under this dispensation of Grace, is raised to more
spirituality, so should this of singing also be; the songs should be songs of
the Spirit, such as do favor of a larger effusion of the Holy Spirit: these
holy Songs should be such, as are breathed out by Spiritual Singers filled with
the Spirit, such as in one Spirit are more directed to the Father in the name
of Christ; they should be mutually teaching and admonishing of one another: for
which end, Col. 3. 16. Psalm. 119. 172.
the word of Christ should indwell in us richly in all Wisdom; the more
scriptual the words are, and the more pertinent, still the better. How heavenly
is the Hymnifying-way of singing! Mat. 26. 30. Mar. 14. 26. Acts 16. 25.
this was practiced by the LORD Christ, and his good Disciples, even after that
he had instituted, and observed the New Testament-Ordinance of his Supper: Rev.
5. 9 -- 14. and 7. 1 -- 12. and 14. 1, 2, 3. and 15. 3, 4. and 19. 1 -- 7.
The word of Prophecy in the New Testament has upon written Record the new
Songs of later days; and there are Old Testament Psalm. ^96. 1. and 98. 1. and
144. 9. Esai. 42. 10. and 26. 1, 2, etc. and 27. 2, etc. Psalm. 149. 1. and 40.

Prophecies also of this: The Melody of these new Songs, will yet be more
spiritualized, and made more cordial; of old, it was more by Musical
Instruments, played upon with the hand; but it shall be more Col. 3. 16. Ephesians.
5. 19,
a making Melody in the heart (as well as with the voice) unto the LORD, when
the Musical Instruments shall be, Psalm. 33. 2, 3. neginoth ruach.
the Instruments of the Spirit, when the heart strings of Believers shall be
more touched, struck, pulsed, affected, played on. Esai. 42. 10. and 4^. 19.
Jer. 31. 22. Psalm. 32. 7.
A new Song is sometime foretold, and yet the new Song it self is not
particularly expresly-set down in that place: Revel. 5. 9. and 14. 3. and 15.
^3. So (...) is used cum Aceusative notante materiam novam quae canitur: when
(...) does set out a new manner or end, then jungitur cum Dativo person.
Ephesians. 5. 18, 19, 20. Col. 3. 16, 17.
Skilful Hymnifiers shall be instructed how to compose it, suited to new
Matters, to new Mercies, to new providencial occasions; and the Prophecy does
speak of this, as if it were still now actually fulfilling, the Holy Singers do
actually sing, in the present sense a new Song, and as new; new for the matter,
by putting of several suitable Scriptures together; and new for the manner and
end, at least as to the raised degree of spirituality, and of heavenliness, for
the Principle and Rule, for the frames and actings also: the Scriptures were
fulfilled Psalm. 22. 22, 25, compared with Heb. 2. 11, 12. Psalm. 40. 3, 9, 10.
The 22 Psalm was spoken by Christ to his Father; this is clear by comparing
Psalm. 22. 2. with Heb. 5. 7. Psalm. 22. 8. with Mat. 27. 43. Psalm. 22. 18. with
Mat. 27. 35. and John 19. 23, 24. Psalm, 22. 1. with Mat. 27. 46. Mar. 15. 34.
concerning the LORD Jesus Christ as to this (as well as in all other things
spoken concerning him) and it shall also be with respect to the followers of
this Lamb: He had a new Song given in his mouth, praising Jehovah Aelohim the
Father with an Hymn and Song of the Spirit in the midst of the Church, in the
great Church-assembly, and Congregation of Worshippers, in the Convocated
Meetings, at Instituted Seasons; it was there where he Evangelized, or preached
the gladsome tidings of Justice, or of Righteousness.

When the Judicious Reader has put all this together (to which his own industry
and observation might add more collections from the Scriptures) and has
consideringly well digested this matter, let him then ponderingly bethink
himself, whether a Musician, if he will speak according to the Truth, can
justly say, that the holy Scriptures do afford him no particular Rules and
Directions in the Musical Art? Or, whether the things of this Art be not to be
found in the Scripture at all? There is a Scripture-harmony, wherein the Rules
of Philosophic Musicians do fail; for, in this word, here Maxims are made
Minims, and Minims are made Maxims; here the short is long, and the long is
made short: here a Song is heard, the Text whereof is given, but no Musical Art
can fully express its Melody, neither can it be represented by Musical Notes:
Luke 1. 9 -- 14.
So it was, when the Savior of his people from their sins was born of a
Virgin, and a multitude of the heavenly Host, with the Angel of the LORD did
sweetly sing the Hymn in harmonious Concord, when professing believing
Christians will be better at leisure to study the Scripture more thoroughly, and
when they shall more experience their hearts to be kindly affected therewith,
they will find more reason to admire its fullness, and to plead its Cause.

I Have held the Eye and the Ear of the Reader long enough to the Musical Art
of Scripture-melody: I am now to pass, if he will go along with me from the
Musical, Metrical Measure of Words, into the Geometrical Measure of Timber in
the Fabril-Art; for, the Carpenter-Rules are also to be found in the Word of
Truth: the holy Scriptures do not pass by in silence these manual Artificers,
but do take cognizance of them; neither do they make mention of them only in
some general terms and expressions, but they also do give many particular
Directions about their Art. To let go some other things relating unto this,
such as Zechar. 1. 20, 21. Esai. 28, 17.
the Metaphorical expressions about it, which yet do open somewhat of the skill
of it, the Scriptures have several names, by which they are described in the
Word: sometimes they are simply called 2 King. 22. 6. and 24. 14, 16. 2 Chronicles.
24. 12. and 34. 11. Ezra. 3. 7. ^er. 24. 1. and 29 2. Mat. 13. 55. Mar. 6. 3. 1 Chronicles. 22. 15. Exodus 31. 5. and 35. 33. 2 Chronicles. 2. 14. ^sai. 44. 13. Job. 38.

Carpenters; elsewhere they are described to be Artificers in Wood, to be
Workers in Wood, or about Wood or Timber: the Idolaters did sinfully abuse and
pervert this Art unto an ill use, and a bad end, who were curious in their
sinful way to frame their abominable vanities and lies. Nebuchadnezzer carried
the Carpenters out of the Land of Judah into Babylon to use them there. The
LORD himself gave skilfulness in this Fabril-Art unto Betzaleel and Aholiab
about fitting the Tabernacle and the Ark, which was a great honor put upon
these Artificers. Hiram, King of Tire, sent such to David to build him an
house: Solomon, a wise King, used their skill, and a remark is sometimes set
upon such, as excelled herein: When the first Temple was instaured under Joas,
as also under Jasiah, these Princes saw the usefulness of such Workmen; who
also were employed by the Religious Governors, when the Temple was set up.
Joseph, the Putative Father of Christ, was of the Trade, and the Nazaren's gave
this name of Carpenter to the LORD Jesus Christ himself, who is supposed to
have handled somewhat of the Fabril-Art in Joseph's Family, before he exercised
his public Ministerial Office.

As for the 1 Cor. 3. 10.
Architectonical part of the Fabril Science, which is the particular instance
given by that learned opponent, who has argued, that there are no particular
Rules given to Carpenters in the Scriptures, for the exstructing of an house;
let any diligent Inquirer into the Word about this, but put together the exact
measures of the Ark in Noah's time, of the Tabernacle and Ark in Moses's days,
of the first Temple in Solomon's Reign, of the second Temple under Nehemiah's
Government, of the Prophetical (...) willing, if he understand the Auther, may
read! Villampan^lus, about the measurements of this Temple, and of the
uniformness, and exactness of it* in the whole, and in all the parts of it,
where much of the Manual Mystery of the Fabril-Art is opened and discovered,
and made practical.
Temple in Ezekiels Visions, of the new four-squared City in the Revelation
(not now to mention many other stately edifices recorded in the Scriptures) and
then say, whether there be so little or nothing of particular Rules in the
Word, as a Directory for uniform building? especially, if to all this there
were added besides, for the perfecting of this Art, all the original Words and
Phrases, relating to this Manual Science in their proper, apt, full
significancy. This discovery alone about those Structures, and these Words and
Phrases, though no more were added, if pursued by men of judgment and of
skill, of faithfulness and of industry; would quickly bring in matter enough
for a large Treatise on this subject, which I have neither call nor leisure to
do.

Here in this Book of God you may meet with the Carpenters

with the fittedness, and usefulness of them: here we read of their Measures
and Dimensions, such as Latitude, Longitude, Profundity, and Sublimity; wherein
the Scriptures go beyond Pagan Physics, and Mathematics, these constituting
only three Dimensions, Length, Breadth and Height (such strangers were they to
the Deep Mysteries, both of Grace and of Nature) whereas, those do give us an
account of four, and they have much to say concerning each of them distinctly,
severally and apart, as also conjoynedly when put together in a
well-proportioned Timber-building, which is another hint of large spreadingness
in this Art, for those to consider who will employ their thoughts in this
study. Gal. 6. 16. Phil. 3. 16. 2 Cor. 10. 16. Esai. 44. 13, 14. Job 38. 5.
The Carpenters Rule and Line, is here taken particular notice of; by this he
is to measure, and to try his work, whether it be right and exact, or not?
Whether all the parts do coh^re and answer in a just proportion, and in a due
symmetry? The creating Aelohim himself is said, when he created this Earth, to
extend a Rule upon it; he squared it in its Rev. 7. 1. and 20. 8. Deuteronomy. 32. 26.

four Corners according to the truest Art; whereby he does direct such Workmen
in their Timber-Structures; and the Word of Christ has dignified this
Instrument by applying of it to it self in being the Canon, the Rule of Faith,
of Worship, and of Life, of the whole of our Religion; the Canonical Scripture
is that, by which all Doctrines must be examined, Whether they be right, and do
answer according to this or not; the Supreme Judge has established and
promulgated his Word, as the Law of judging, that it might be the perfect and
adequate measure of what is Isai. 42. 16.
right, to distinguish it from what is crooked; the unerring Norm of all
spiritual judging is this God-inspired Doctrine, which the Head-Governour of
his Church has proclaimed unto men, whence they may understand what that
sentence is, which he does pass upon cases, and may conform to it all their
judgments and actions in all matters to be believed and practiced:
Wood-Carpenters do thus extend their Rule straightly to examine rectitudes, to
prove what is straight, and what is inflex: and therefore when the LORD
intended the restoration and restitution of the Church, and Commonwealth of
his People, of the reparation of the City, and of the re-edification of the
Temple, he sets it out in a vision to his Prophet Zechar. 1. 16. and 2. 1, 2, 4.
Zechariah: A Master Builder passes along, ready furnished with fit
implements, laying out, and measuring the plot of the City, whether there were
length and wideness, and room enough to be fully capacious for the receiving
and containing of so many inhabitants, as were to repeople it, drawing the
Ichnographick, delineating and describing the building in the whole platform
thereof, that it might be exactly carrid on according to the Rules of his Art,
by the Instruments of Architecture; some of those Instruments were mensory,
used for measuring of the several Edifices; such was the Jer. 3^. 19. Ezekiel. 47.

Line, which takes the Latitude of a thing, or its compass about according to
the Figure of it, and is sometimes colored with red Lead, or with Chalk or
Oker, or such like, for the drawing of a right Line, whose duct the Carpenter
does follow in exequating and complaining of his Timber or Boards; hence are
those ^sai. 34. 11, 17. and 44. 13. Ezekiel. 47. 3. Jer. 31. 38. Psalm. 19. 5. 2

phrases in the Scripture, to mete out the parts with the Line in the hand, to
extend, or to stretch out the Line: thus does the Wright, the Workman of Trees
or Wood, upon a piece of Timber, where and how far to cut it off, or otherways
to work it; thus also, for the Line to go forth, or to be extended, or to be
put unto somewhat: This Mensory-line the Prophet saw in the hand of Christ
himself, and of his under Officers, as that Architectonick Instrument, by which
the parts of the Temple-Structure were equated. The Carpenters Zechar. 4. 10.

Perpendicular is here spoken off, as taken in hand, and used by him for the
measuring of Altitudes, and of Uprightness, and of Levels, when he, who is well
instructed in building, will put forth his skill, there being great need of
using the Plummet, or Plumb line in this Science, when reduced to practice, the
weight whereof was either of Stone, or of Tin, or of Lead, by which a Carpenter
does prove, and try the rectitude of his Structure; as the Timberwork goes
forward, or is toward finishing, the Architect busily imploys himself with his
Plummet, Plumb-line, or Level, to see if every part and the whole do lie
square, level, and perpendicular: Masons also did the like: Ezekiel 40. 3, 5, 6,
7. and 41. 8. and 42. 16. and 48. 8. Rev. 11. 1. and 21. 15, 16.
a Mensory Reed or Rod has heretofore been used to the like purpose; the LORD
Jesus Christ himself, thus appears in prophetical Scripture, as one who
measures his new house in the later days, with his golden Reed: Here you may

Planes great and less, the greater to fetch off the rougher, and the more
rugged part of the Timber, the lesser and finer to smooth it afterward, and to

signify to scrape or to pare away: the skilful also may here find the use of
engraving Tools, of Carving Instruments; the fittedness of Hatchets, and of 1

Axes, great and small, for their peculiar purposes, and proper uses; the
Carpenter is here directed, of what matter to have these made, of Iron, and of
what sort of Iron, the Northern Iron or Steel, or a mixture of both, this
Northern sort being the firmest, and strongest, and hardiest, not so easily
broken, and they are the best and fittest for use, those Regions affording the
best sort of that Metal, and the Artificers about this, being in those parts
skilful in Iron-works, and in tempering of them; the use of these is to cut
withal, and the manner must be by laying them on with strength, that the Timber
thereby may be fitted for Building, ^hen it is hewed, and fashioned by these
Instruments: Spiritual Discerners should in this great providential day see the

Hammer, which has its sigular usefulness in its kind, to break, to drive in,
to fasten, and the like; some of the potent cruel Enemies of the Church and
People of God are Metaphorically set out by such Hammers, as would oppress and
break them: 1 Chronicles. 22. 3. Isai. 22. 25, 24, 25, 2 Chronicles. 3. 9. Psalm. 22. 17.

It makes mention of the Nails, and of the Pins, that the Hammer does drive; it
tells you of what matter these are made, some of Iron, or Brass, others of
Wood; it does declare their use, which is both to fasten things in their place,
and to hang Vessels and other Instruments and things upon: the words of the
wise are aptly compared unto these, when well set on by the Teachers in
Assemblies, who are to endeavor to fix their good Counsels in the memory of
the Hearers, and to hold the people close to their office and duty; a wise,
faithful Magistrate fitted for the due administration of Justice in a Kingdom
or Commonwealth, is compared unto such a well-fixed Nail, in its right place,
confirmed in his seat of Dignity, the peace and other happiness of a Nation
much depending upon his good Government, and the Subjects being held and born
up in their Duty by his Authority: The Reader may here observe, how the LORD
does in his Word spiritualize these earthly things and employments, whereby he
would teach them to be holy and heavenly in their particular Functions, that
they may abide in their Callings with God, and may know in experience how to
have the Christian Religion to run into the whole of their day and work, and
may see it evidently reconcilable, and reducible to practice for a man to be
diligent, industrious and laborious with his hand, whilst all the while he is
believing, serious and pondering in his heart, having sweet Meditations, and
being glad in Jehovah, turning his ordinary work into special Worship, and
having fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus, in the supplies of
the holy Spirit, even whilst he is conversant about the things of this world in
his lawful employment: O for more of such handy-crafts-men! whatever they do,
it shall prosper. As for Timber-pins, it instructs the Carpenter to make them
of strong firm word, not of that which is weak and yielding, as the wood of a
Vine is; a discreet Carpenter will not take of the wood thereof to make a piece
of work with it, he will not take a pin of it to hang any Vessel thereon, a
wooden-nail, or peg of it is not fitted for the use of hanging up
household stuff, or working-tools, or any heavy matter upon it; by which
comparison and similitude the LORD gives hypocritical Israel and Judah to know,
that of all the people in the world, carnal, earthly, hollow-hearted,
professors of Religion, are some of the most unprofitable and useless. The
Carpenter may learn from this word, what kind of Timber to choose and to use,
even that, Isai. 44. 13, 14, 20. and 5. 24. and 40. 20.
which is of Trees that will not rot, Cedars, Oaks, Ashes, Elms, Firt-trees,
are especially commended amongst others, wise workmen will discern between what
is sound, and what is rotten. I expect that skilful Carpenters will be in this
on my side; For 1 King. 5. 18. 1 Chronicles. 22. 4. Ezra. 3. 7. 2 Samuel 5. 11. 1
King. 5. 1, 6. 1 Chronicles. 14. 1.
the Scriptures do much commend those who were very skilful in this Mechanic
Art: such were the Sydonians, the Tyrians, and some others, who had practical
excellency of curious knowledge in this Artificious Affabrous Science. Aelohim
himself does set himself out Amos. 7. 7, 8. Heb. 3. 3, 4. 1 Cor. 3. 10, 11.
as an Architect: Thus is Christ the Builder of his Church, and Paul was under
Christ a wise Architect. The Esai. 10. 15. 1 King. 6. 7. and 7. 9. 1 Chronicles. 20.

Saw is here spoken of, the use of which Instrument with Capenters is to cut
Timber and Boards asunder: to make men thus to pass under the Saw, and to cut
them asunder, is one of the most grievous kinds of tormenting punishments,
which some enraged Conquerors have exercised their subdued Captives with: it is
an Instrument merely passive, which does act no further than it is acted,
having all its force, and receiving all its efficacy from that Agent, or from
these Agents, that do move it to and fro, up and down, backward and forward, in
cutting; and therefore the Saw cannot magnify it self against the Agitator,
the Mover of it; it was then a wicked thing in that proud King of Assyria to
exalt himself, when the LORD used him as a Saw in his hand for the humbling and
subduing, the correcting and chastising, of a sinful hypocritical people; he
ascribed his great Victories which he obtained, not unto Jehovah as the Author
of them, but unto himself, to his own Wisdom and Valor; he carried on an
ambitious plot of his own to enlarge his Territories, and to spread his own
Dominions, but, thought not upon, intended not, that which was the LORD's wise,
just design, and holy good end: Thus you see, how God in his Word does furnish
even Sawers with profitable matter of holy Meditation. How large is the
Scripture about the right structure of an House, in the whole, and in the
several parts of it! Prove. 24. 27. Mat 7. 24^ 27. Luke 6, 48, 49. Eccles. 3. 3.

grounded, set with Art on their Sockets, that they may be staid up and fastened;
Pillars in Hebrew have their name from standing firm, immoved, upright,
standing under, and sustaining of the House; the Sockets were as Feet or
Grounds to sustain what Timber, or Boards, or Planks were laid upon them, or
were put into them, having hollow Mortaises for the Tenons of the Boards to be
fastened in, that there might be an equal perfect joining, a work to be
performed with skill and care; here the Exodus 31. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and 35. 33.

Beams and Rafters, what Timber to make them of, how to lay them, how to fasten
them in the Walls; they have one of their names in Hebrew from running to meet,
because in the manner of their fitting and laying on in an extructed edifice,
they should be so exactly fitted, as that, they, and what they are put upon and
into, may, as it were, run to meet, and to receive one another by mutual
coaptation and contignation; there is one part of them, which is Ligament or
Band to receive the junctures of the Building; and another of their names they
have from their density or thickness: 2 Chronicles. 34. 11.
the Commissures, or Coupling, or Couples, are here spoken of, as the

Platforms, with more that might be added upon this subject matter, if it were
worth mine and the Readers while to heap up together all the proper materials
relating unto this manual Art? which those, who would be curious therein, and
are more at leisure to search deeper and further into this inquiry in a
Scripture-way, may with study and diligence more furnish themselves withal, in
order to the Artificial Symmetrical joining of Timber-pieces together into an
exact Frame: so that, a raised heavenly mind would admire to see so much of
this Fabril-Art, so scattered up and down in the Word; for, it does much
commend the excellingness of Scripture-knowledge, that in so great a part of
it, it does teach diverse things, and several Truths at once. O that I could
prevail so far with the generous Minds, and with the ingenuous Spirits of this
age, as that, they would first of all (after the prayer of Faith, put up unto
the LORD for being taught of him) study the Scriptures upon the particular
subject-matters, which their inquiries are exercised about in any lawful Arts
and Sciences, and let Scripture-knowledge lead them as far as it will go: if it
were so, that all were not there, yet do not reject what is there, and then
improve it by drawing forth from thence what Jehovah has put of it into Nature,

Seeing we are upon the advancement of useful Learning, and somewhat is now to
be written about the Augment and Restoration of the Geographick Chorographick
and Topographick Science and Art, I have these few Queries to propound to the
Studious in this kind of Learning.
Queries. WHether it would not much promote Scripture-knowledge, which is the
best knowledge, to have such Maps drawn of the Earth, of Countries, of Places,
of Distances, and such like, as do exactly agree with the Scriptures, with
those particular Scriptures that do relate thereunto? and to have those Maps
more common amongst the people to give them further insight, and truer
information in such passages of the World? somewhat of this has been done
already, but we encourage perfecting work.

Q. Whether all the Books of Ethnic, Philosophic, Geography, should not be
corrected and reformed by Scripture-Geography in its description of the Earth,
of Countries, of Cities, and of other places, which does give us, as the most
ancient, so also Genesis 10. and 11. chapters, collated with other Scriptures
relating to this subject matter.
the only infallible and perfect Narration, how the several parts of the Earth
were inhabited, and properly by the Sons of Noah and their Posterity?

Q. Whether the true Origination of the right Names of the several inhabited
Nations were not derived from the proper Names of those of Noah's Posterity,
who were the first Possessors and Founders of Cities in those places, and gave
Names to those Countries? and whether the Hebrew signification of those proper
Names, both of Persons and of Places, would not bring more light to the true
description of those Countries, and of their situation, than as yet any humane
Geographies have discerned by?

Q. Whether the Original Names, by which the several parts and Countries of the
inhabited Earth are called in the Scriptures, should not be revived, and
restored, and used in the several Mother-Tongues? and this, not only in the
Translation of the holy Scriptures into other Languages, but also in all other
Treatises, that shall speak of those Countries.

Q. Whether, seeing Noah's Ark did rest upon the Mountains of Ararat, in the
Eastern part of the dry Land, where he and his Family did settle themselves for
a while, and from whence afterward they and their Generations did spread
themselves? Whether Shem, who removed Genesis 1. 30.
Eastward, being said to go East East, did not possess and people America,
where diverse Names of places are still retained much according to the
Scripture-Hebrew? and, if so, whether then, the late Globes and Maps be drawn
according to the Original Truth, which do place America in such a quarter and
coast of the Earth, that yet received her first inhabitants from the
East-borders of Asia (as they now call it) and which do leave such a vast Ocean
of so many Leagues between Sinear and Anjan, between the North-East parts of
Asia, and the North-West side of America, as they commonly describe them? and,
whether these be not continent, at most but dis-joyned by some great River or
narrow Channel of the Ocean?

As for Grammar-Learning, relating to the Original Language in the Scriptures,
I have at present these considerations to propound unto the Ingenious, and
Ingenuous, the Studious, and the learned Linguists by way of further inquiry.
Queries. WHether the design of this Treatise being the perfecting of the
knowledge of all useful Arts and Sciences, and the Restoration, and
advancement of Learning in a Scripture-way, as the true, the right, the
excelling, the only way thereof, whether, therefore it were not a necessary and
profitable work, to compose a Grammar of the Original Language or Languages,
wholly according to Scripture, and the Rules found there, and no longer to make
Scripture speak according to Philosophic Grammars, and their Rules invented by
men, which Rules are often contradicted by particular Scripture-instances,
seeing that these Arts and Sciences are to be fetched out of the Original
Language, and not from Humane Authorities, that so, in these later days, we may
have a proper remedy against the confusion of Tongues?

Q. Whether in such a Scripture-Grammar, great wisdom and diligence should not
be used, that the Orthoepick, and Orthographick part of it be so accommodated
to the Original Languages, as that, the Scripture-Tongues may be more purely
spoken, more correctedly written, more speedily learned, more exactly measured,
more sweetly sounded, more rightly accented, and more profitably improved?

Q. Whether the Etymological part of such a Grammar should not be so fitted to
the real origination, and the natural significancy of Scripture-words, as that,
there may be a well-agreeing Analogy of all those words, from the Root to the
Branches throughout, in one and the same common notion of meaning, and with
each other all the Scriptures through, and with the persons or things which
they do represent, that words may be but the notes of true Essences, and the
interpretations of created Natures? and, that a complete Lexicon be framed to
this purpose, setting out the significant meaning, and the proper intendment of
the original Words themselves, to be derived and deduced from created
Existences, having an innate Reason thereof in them? and, whether all other
Languages are not Hebrew Dialects, having cognation with this Original Tongue?

Q. Whether the Syntactical constructive part in the regimen of Original words,
when put together in Sentences, should not be kept close unto in the very same
order of the Words and Phrases in all Translations into Mother-Tongues, without
any the least trajection, or transposition of Words, or of Points, Variation,
Addition, or Supplement, or Substraction, leaving the propriety of their
meaning and Government to the Interpreter and Expounder of them, the
Commentator and Dilater upon them, the Paraphraser and Applyer of them, as the
holy Spirit from the Father, in the Name of the Son shall give him skill and
utterance, by a due regard had to the Context, and by a faithful collating of
other suitable Scriptures in an Harmonious Concent?

Q. Whether there be any thing in the Original Text, either from the difference
of the Style, or from the significancy of the Accents, or from any other
Grammacal consideration, which does, either naturally in its self, or by
institution of the Holy Inspirator, give us a more just account, and genuine
distinction of the several parts of Scripture, than that, which at this day is
in common use amongst us, by the Titles and order of the Books, by Chapters,
and by Verses, and what it is?

Q. Whether all humanely invented Enallages, all changes whatsoever of one part
of Speech into another, of Persons, of Genders, of Numbers, of Cases of
Letters, of Words, of Names, of Vowels, of Accents, of Syntax, of Moods, or of
what else that does belong unto the Original Languages, as also
wrong-fancied-Anomalies, should not be altogether laid aside in such a Grammar,
especially when passing into a Translation?

Q. Whether all humanely pretended Paragoges, Redundancies, Expletives,
Pleonasms, Insignificancies, Deficiencies, of any Letters, Syllables or Words,
should not be quite rejected by discerning Grammarians in such a Grammar, as
obscurings and wrongings of the Original Languages?

Q. What is the true Orginal Emphaticalness of the Original Punctations and
Accentations? And how do these or any other part of the Original Languages
direct in the right sound, the just pronunciation of words, and in the orderly
distinction of a Sentence, into its certain Members and Clauses by its due
pointings?

Where the LORD has furnished any others in their greater store, with more
discoveries of this useful Nature, could I live to see this way of
Scripture-knowledges more countenanced and promoted by them, it would give joy
in my heart: however it be, whatever the issue and the success of these
intimations be, I exalt His Name, who is the All glorious Jehovah, Sam 2. 3.
the Ael of Sciences, that he has in this so graciously helped me so far to
serve my Generation according to his will before I fell on sleep. If the Reader
be under such apprehensions, that this Book of mine might well have been
spared, because it is my principle to bring all unto Christ's one Book of
Scripture; I expect so much ingenuity from him, as to acknowledge, that there
must be some way and medium found out, and held forth for the communicating and
commending of the excellency of Christ's Book, which is a Book One and All,
were it thoroughly understood, rightly applied, and well improved; and I knew no
other means of like spreadingness with this, that is before thee, which I was
in any present capacity of making known unto the World, Eceles. 12. 8^ ^4.
Wise Solomon condemns the folly, and the fruitlessness, the vanity, and the
vexation of Ethnic Books, and of Philosophic Studies, where Supernatural
Directions were not to be had, though men professing the true Religion, did
much betake themselves thereunto, and did in many particular subjects write out
of, and according unto them: What a multitude of Books are there that Humane
Authors do make? though their writings do not give that full satisfaction which
the most do wrong look for there: how often do new Treatises flutter abroad?
the last usually undertaking, either to confute other men's arguings, or to
correct their mistakes, or to reprove their miscarriages, or to instruct them,
or to add to them, or further to confirm them, or with some such like design;
and then quickly after out comes another passing his judgment upon that, which
went but a little before: and what do men by this but publish the imperfection
of all their own Writings: and the same sentence will be passed upon this Book
of mine, though my Treatise has this advantage beyond others, that its design
and drift is, to plead for, and to praise, that Eminent Book of God, which is
the only perfect Book. If the more spiritually discerning among the perusers of
this Treatise do discover corrupt Mixtures, humane Frailties, ignorant
Mistakes, and unadvised Errors therein, they are to remember, and to consider,
that the Author is also a man, of like affections and weaknesses as they, there
is no difference, but what rich Grace, and free Love does make; which therefore
does call for their compassionating pities, earnest prayers, and friendly
helpings, laying aside all proud insultings, revengful tramplings, and personal
reflectings. Courteous Reader, let the Scriptures be more studied, where is a
complete declaration of the mind and will of the All wise Aelohim, and which
can fully satisfy thee in thy weighty inquiries: It is an endless labor, and
a wearisome task, both to make and to read other Books: The end of the whole
Word of God, and of all hearing of it, is, that we might fear Aelohim, and keep
all his Commandments; for this is all Adam; about this Book should we lay out
the strength of our thoughts, the redeemings of our time, and the bent of our
Studies; these holy Scriptures are not so large a Volumn, but that it may be
read over in some few Weeks or Months, and the oftener it is read over by a
spiritual discerner, diligent observer, wise improver, and believing practiser,
still the more does it open of its Treasure of Knowledge; here is a Library
made up of one Book, so entire in it self as that it is able to make thee wise
unto Salvation: O bestow thy pains principally here! here chiefly employ thy
Studies! be not weary in turning these frequently over! saving Knowledge and
true Happiness, is no were else fully revealed: To move thee hereunto, remember
and consider, that thy actions, all of them, open and secret, good or ill, must
stand or fall according to this Book, as they are conformable to it or not, and
all this as our eternal State, either of bliss, or of misery, thine who read
this, and mine who write this.

There is much of Spiritual use to be made by Believers of the improved
knowledge of Natural things, for the discerning and enjoying of fellowship with
the Creator and Redeemer.
IT is neither beneath the grave Majesty, and Royal Anthority of the Word of
the LORD, nor besiders its real intent, and designed purport, to converse with
Believers about created Beings, those great works which do so much speak the
glorious Excellencies of their admired Maker. The orderly recording of the
Works of Creation, in the beginning of the Book of God, severally and
distinctly on each of the foregoing six days of the first week of the created
World, and of the Sabbath-rest upon the seventh, the last day of the week,
unalterably confirmed by an unchangeable Law, this does put holy Meditation
upon the working, and the resting of the Creator and Redeemer into a
methodical, profitable Spiritual way; it would furnish an experienced Saint
with proper matter every day for the feeding of his thoughts, to the nourishing
of his Soul, the satisfaction of his Spirit, the strengthing of his Heart, and
the inlightning of his Mind. That Humane Invention of transferring the weekly
Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, has wholly inverted this
established order. The Psalmists frame was then usually most raised, and most
refined, most humble, and most heavenly, most serious, and most savoury, Psalm.

the better and more continued preparedness to meet the LORD in his
Sanctuary-goings in other solemn instituted Ordinances; he will make but little
of the Word of God, who makes nothing of the Works of God: one great end of the
Creators giving a being to Creatures, was to supply a man with continued matter
of admiring, and of adoring the wonderful Former of all this. O how much, and
with what kindliness, think ye, was Ge^. ^. 19. 20.
Adam's heart affected with the sight and contemplation of this goodly
beauteous Structure, whilst he stood in uprightness! with how great delight was
his Tongue, his Glory in trumpeting of that perfection, that shined forth in
all, and in every of the works of the Creator! much of Adam's wisdom appeared
in his giving of apt and fit names to all the Beasts of the Field, and to all
the Fowls of the Air, according as the Natures, and the Powers of their created
condition were. In Authority, many who have gotten a name, as if they had been
the first inventers of some profitable knowledges, yet themselves went to
School to some lower Creatures, to learn skill of them; which was one of the
first abused occasions of the heathens making and setting up of the Forms of
some Bruits, of Beasts, of Fowls, of Fishes, of Serpents, of Herbs, as their
Idols, which they worshipped. The great Admirers, Illustrators and Promoters of
Humane Learning have acknowledged the Originals of the discoveries of many
witty Inventions to proceed first from the observations, which Learned men have
made from those experiments, that meaner beings than themselves have
providentially set before them: (thus do they speak, as to men; for the true
reasons, and the proper causes, and the real originals, of the Virtues and
Powers of created Existences, have their first foundation and discovery in the
Word, and in Nature) These Philosophic men give us some particular instances
of rational knowledges directed to by natural perception, and instinct in
irrational beings, owning these for being some of the prime Masters of Arts,
and Doctors of Sciences. Who instructed the Surgeon how to cure wounds, but the
wild Goat by applying some Sanative Grasses, and Herbs, and Flowers, which led
him to the use of some things in Surgery? Hence also have some been taught
the cure of Impostumes, such as are between the skin and the flesh; for, when
there is a putrified matter which impostumiseth, before it ripen of it self,
and come to break, the wild Goat oppressed with the noxious pungency of the
itching humor, rubs himself against Stones and Shrubs, until his Imposthume
break, and the whole filth from the bag do pour out it self, and so the beast
eases himself: Whence learned the Chyrurgeon, the profirable use of the Herb
Dittany, for the extracting of Arrows or Splinters, or whatsoever it is that
gives a wound, and leaves some poison behind, if the hurt be not mortal; but
when Hearts, who, when they were struck with a Dart, or were otherways shot with
an invenomed Arrow, presently resorted to this Herb, which has a specific
Virtue latent in it, whereby this Plant, when eaten by them, both ejects the
Weapon, and expels the Poison? The cure of wounds with Dragon, Briony, and
Comfrey, some have learned from the Serpent; as also the curing of Eyes, when
evil affected, with Fennel; Cats have found Valerian to comfort the sight; and
Swallows use Celendine, as an Herb friendly to the sight, with which they heal
the eyes of the young. Phlebotomy, the cutting of a Vein to let out blood, and
the stopping of it again, some were informed in by the Seahorse, which is
skilful at Scarification, and at cutting of a Vein; for, when he feels himself
under a great and dangerous distemper, by overmuch eating, he rubs himself
against Reeds, or somewhat else that is hard, until a Vein breaking, he let out
a sufficient quantity of his blood, and then he hastneth to stop the aperture,
and to heal and close it up by applying of mud and of dirt to the orifice of
the wound. The Art of Building was somewhat taught by the industry and skill of
Swallows, and of Bees: some Physicians were instructed in forming of Pills from
Scarabes, that do gather things round on an heap, and then make Balls: The Art
of Spinning some have learned from Silkworms, of Weaving from Spiders, of
Vomiting from Dogs, of Clysters from the Bird Ibis, purging himself by putting
up part of his crooked Bill into that part, by which the Excrement is
discharged; also the Hern, who with his Bill does infuse Seawater instead of a
Clyster, thus practicing of it upon himself by his own beak. Whence came the
knowledge of Powder-Artillery for the Warrior, but by a Potlids occasional
flying open? From these and such like have Philosophic Professors fetched
their principles of knowledge; which does show, that the God of Nature has put
much into the Nature of created Beings, which if improved by Scripturalized
reason in a word-way, would raise Arts to a wonderful height. The LORD himself
in his Word does send his own people to be better informed in their Duties and
Privileges by other Creatures; so blockish and stupid is fallen man, who,
since he acted below Religion, is fallen beneath Reason: He preached unto them
the Doctrine of observing Seasons of Grace, and of improving of opportunities
of Salvation, from the wisdom of Jer. 8. 7. Job 3^. 2^. (...). ^. 3.

Lessons at once. O how much do the Wisdom and the Goodness, and other glorious
Excellencies of Jehovah Aelohim shine forth in his Works ^ He garnished the
Heavens, and replenished the Earth, and stored the Seas with all manner of
variety and good things, fit for the use of Man, and then he created Man,
bringing him into a well-furnished habitation, where man found all ready
prepared to his hand, whatsoever was requisite both for necessity and for
delight; that, by all this the LORD might draw up the heart of man to himself,
and keep it fixed in Communion there, whither every creature called it up,
whilst Adam and Eve stood firm in integrity. The Christian Religion should pass
into our particular Callings, so that even in these 1 Cor. 7. 20, 24.
we should abide with God, when we are employed about common matters and
earthly things. How often has the LORD confirmed his Covenant of Grace to his
people, by such Compare Genesis 9. 8 -- 17. with Isai. 54. 9, 10. and Jer. 31. 31

and truth thereof (for the confutation of Atheism, and of Infidelity) from the
Heavens above, and from the Earth beneath, and from all the Host of both, from
Sun, from Moon, from Stars, from the successive courses of Night and Day, from
Winter and from Summer, from Heat, and from Cold, from the Height above, and
from the Deep below, from things present, and from things to come, that which
way soever man cast his eye on either of those two Books of Scripture and of
Nature, of word and of works in this great School, the Disciples of Christ
might still be learning of somewhat profitable. What was that method, and
means, and way, which Jehovah Aelohim did take for the convincing and humbling
of Job 38, 39, 40, 41, Chapters, and the beginning of the 42 Chapt.

Theology, and of Christianity; and by these visible Witnesses will the
righteous Judge of all leave the condemned world without excuse, at that last
great day. Errors in Philosophical Learning are greatly dangerous unto
Professors of Christian Religion; the corruptions in that have caused so many
Heresies, and continued so many Controversies; so that, if we could search
after the Foundations and Principles, from whence most mistakes about Religion
have their Spring and Origin, we may find them laid in Humane wisdom, by its
vain Affecters; such as, the pretended power of Nature, and freedom of will, in
fallen man, as to Spirituals and Eternal; the asserted Dictates and Placits of
the Understanding, as the ultimate undeniable resolvers in all Cases, with a
great number of such like: Some whole Societies of corrupt Professors are but
Philosophic Sects received and called by another name; as, those that make the
instincts of their own Souls, the impulses of their own Spirits, and the
motions and imaginations of their own hearts, to be their only Rule, by which
they measure their judgment concerning good and evil; and the fixed constancy
of their belief, or the wavering doubtfulness of their persuasions, to be the
measure of duty, or of sin: whence sprang this but from that sort of
Philosophers, who placed their happiness in silencing of all disputes of the
mind, and in smothering of all scruples of Conscience, affirming Good not to
have any inherent chuseable Being in it self, and Evil not to have any such
constant fixed Malignity in its own Nature; but all their actions they thought
to be condemnable, when they did somewhat, which they had any inward
relunctancy against, and aversness from; and to be commendable when they were
clearly resolved* and fully determined in their minds and wills, to do this or
that: But no more at present of this. It is Scripture-Learning only, which
through the teachings of the holy Spirit can instruct us in the right use, and
holy improvement of the knowledge of Natural Things, so that, the growing
Believer is Holy and Spiritual, even in his trading with those Talents; and
whilst he is exercised about these, his Scripture-wisdom does commend it self
in its own excellency, and in its preferableness above and beyond all mere
Humane Understanding for the many good and choice fruits and effects thereof,
being Jam. 3. 13, 17, 18.
first pure (in it self, and in its efficaciousness, or chaste) then pacifick
(or peaceable) modest, obsequent (or well swasible) full of Mercy, and of good
Fruits, not contentious (or void of wrangling disception) and not hypocritical
(or void of simulation). Whereas, some have made the observation, that these,
who are so deeply conversant in the secrets of Nature, do generally degenerate
into Atheists, not acknowledging an Aelohim, as the first Causer, but ascribing
all beings and productions to natural causalities: this, where it is found to
be so, is to be understood only of the Ethnic Philosophy, which does take
those who are Students in it off, and does carry them away, from Christ and
from his Word; not of that Scripture-wisdom, which does so directly lead
Disciples to Christ, and to his Word: for, this saving sound knowledge does
produce a quite contrary effect, even to make them most Saints, and most
Believers, passing them wholly out of self, and off from Creatures, to resolve
all into, and to refer all unto, the Being of beings, the Cause of causes, the
Eternal first Essence, the chiefest, choicest Good, the truest, best Happiness,
the main ultimate End, Jehovah Aelohim blessed for ever. When men of Faith, and
of Experience, do wisely observe the whole frame of this created World, and all
the parts thereof to run their course with continued cheerfulness, and without
wearisome tiredness, to discharge those Offices which their Creators Will has
assigned and enjoined them unto: This consideration does stir up in them high
and honorable thoughts of the Maker and Disposer of all these things; and the
serious Meditation, that the Creation shall be renewed and refined, and
restored to its integrity, and perfection of Estate, and appear yet once again
in its pure cleanness, and in its purged ^xcellency, is a Call unto the Saints
2 Pet. 3. 8, 11, 13.
to shine forth the more in growing measures of glorious Holiness. O what a day
will that be, when the New Heavens, and the New Earth, wherein dwells
Righteousness, shall be created, for Christ's followers to see, and to enjoy
him in? when the chosen among mankind shall be fully perfect in Vision and in
Knowledge, in Grace, and in Glory, in Holiness, and in Happiness. By this
discovery I would remove that occasion of stumbling, which some do lay as a
stone of offense before them, to stop and to hinder themselves in this further
grand inquiry about the proficiency of Learning, as if this would degenerate
Christians into Pagans, and Believers into Naturalists, and send them from
Christ to Creatures, to the debasing of the true, pure Religion; whereas, it
would call off men from ignorant Paganism, to a knowing Christianity, and
advance all profitable Learning into a spiritualized usefulness, and work up
the Scholars in Christ's School to a more refined heavenly raisedness, both in
Principle and in practice.

The Holy Scriptures in speaking of the Works of Creation, and of Natural
Things, do speak of them, as they really are, and not as they seemingly only
appear; according to exactness of Truth, as the Nature and Essence of them are,
and not according to the wrong conceits, and ignorant mistakes of vulgar Minds,
and common Opinionists.
Jehovah Aelohim has put the Essence, and the real Nature of created Beings,

names to the Beasts of the Field, and to all the Fowls of the Air, according
to their quality and condition, which was an evident discovery of his great
Wisdom: and what is a Word, but such a Note, whereby every thing is distinctly
known, both in it self, and also wherein it does differ from other things? The
Holy Scriptures do often from the Works of Creation, and from Natural Things,
Genesis 8. 22. and 9. 12 -- 17. and 15. 5. Jer. 31. 31 -- 37. and 33. 20 -- 25.

prove what they do affirm unto the outward senses, confirming the Faith, and
encouraging the hope of Saints, in Christ, and in his Word, and in his Covenant
of Grace in this Word, by these senses, and confuting their incredulity and
distrust from hence: now, what confirmation of the one, or confutation of the
other, could this be, if those means of probation were not real and sensible,
and self-evidencing in those Brings themselves, which every man that has the
right Exercise of his Reason, and the due use of his Senses, must acknowledge
to be so as is said? the Faith of the LORD's Covenant people grows confident
concerning revealed Truths in what they do not see, by those things which they
do see and discern with their Senses. Many a choice discovery about several of
the Works of Creation, have been revealed to some Spiritual Discerners in their
private Studies, under an imprisoned state, by the holy Spirit from Christ's
true Word, before they ever made search after them, by the use of their outer
Senses, into the nature of those Created Beings, before they had any ocular
Demonstration of them, or made any visible Observations upon them; which
afterward by comparing of these Creatures with those Scriptures, they have
found in experience exactly to agree; so as no mere Humane Author, no Pagan
Philosopher, either has discovered, or can discern. Of what Nature soever those
things are, which God has revealed in his Word unto reasonable Creatures, the
same are they bound to believe them to be, as he has there made them known unto
such: For, they are thereby become a part of the complete Object of Faith: so
that, we are not only to believe the Declarations of the Doctrines of the
Christian Religion, in those great Mysteries of Three in One, of God manifested
in the Flesh, with such like, and also the Prophesies to come in after-ages,
with a great deal more concerning Duties, Graces, Privileges, etc. but also,
that grand History of matters of Fact past and gone, such as the written
Journal of Created Beings, in the beginning of the Bible, and all the
after-discourses of Natural Things, as they are contained in the Scriptures of
Truth. Created Nature is the copyed Transcript of Holy Scriptures. What a bold
daring attempt then is it for vain man to be such an Interpreter of the words
of his Creator, concerning the great Works which he has done, and the Beings
which he has formed, as not to admit of the plain sense of those
Scripture-words and expressions, the original Letter, and the proper
significancy whereof he will not deny or contradict? For, there is great verity
in, and real answerableness between these words and those things. The literal
sense of the Word of Christ, where it speaks positively of the Works of
Creation, of Natural things, is not to be gone off from: if an Allegorical or
Mysterial sense be any where, as to this pleaded for, it must be proved, that
there is an evident necessity thereof in the same place, either by the words
and meaning of themselves, or by the Context, or else by comparing of it with
other Scriptures: where it can be evidenced by such expressions,
significations, contexts, or collations, that any passages in, or relating to,
the History of the Creation are symbolical, signifying some other Mystery, yet
even there, if that were admitted, first of all must the sense of the Letter
simply, and the truth of the History in the plain meaning of the
Narrative-Record be firmly established. Translators should keep close to the
proper meaning of the Original words; otherwise they do expound the sense (as
they apprehend) in Syntax, and are not regular Etymologists to explain the
significancy, and to maintain the property of every word: Scripture-words are
to be turned into other Languages, not as men suppose they mean in trope, but
as they naturally signify in Truth: The usefulness of a literal version in
order to the advancement of Learning is very well worthy to be treated of in
its place. The Scriptures are not accomdated to vulgar received Errors, or
mere imaginary conceits, or vain false appearances, but they speak of things,
as the things themselves really are, Is not the LORD Christ John 14. 6. 1 John
5. 10. Romans 3. 4.

mistake in his expressions? would he, who is so abundant in Goodness, and in
Truth, tell his people otherwise, than the real History is? Christ's Words do
all along speak of these matters, affirmingly, assertingly; they speak of his
Works, not as they seem unto common capacaties, upon mistaken grounds from
erroneous principles, but as the verity of their existence is. Nomenclature
does show, how that Things and Beings are put into the Names of those Things
and Beings, and this by institution of Original significancy, as the
expressions do declare: John 17. 17. Psalm. 119. 151. Psalm. 19. 4.

their being deceived, to have them read and think that for true and certain,

wreathed or perverse in them; they are words of Truth, and there is certainty
in them, being fitted to resolve questions to the satisfaction of inquiring
Spirits. The LORD's wording of the History of the Creation, is his first
revealed Idea of all things, manifest to rational Creatures. The real Natures
of Created Beings do directly answer to Scripture-speakings concerning them:
the things Heb. 11. 3. Romans 1. 19, 20, 21. Rev. 4. 11. and 14. 7.
seen were things made, and the Maker of them would have his own real
perfections to be read in them. How unavoidable would the many dangerous ill
consequences be, that will necessarily follow upon the contrary opinion? how
would all Foundations of credibility, and of veracity be shaken and
over-turned? There is a clear and a constant evidence and demonstration of the
senses well exercised, and rightly judging amongst all reasonable Creatures,
all the inhabited Earth over in all the Ages of the World, who have brought in
one and the same Testimony concerning the reality of things, as this word does
express them to be, which is a full proof. It is a Theological Truth of
resolving the probation, by senses into Scripture-expressions, and of
rectifying all deceits and mistakes of the Senses by the word-Rule. It was, and
is the Scripture-way, to prove things by Senses, and to call upon Senses to
bring in their Verdict according to Scripture. Thus were all the proceedings in
Jehovah's judicial Laws in all Cases, wherein any matter of fact is to be
witnessed, and accordingly any matter of right to be determined, as Justice,
Truth and Equity required. Heb. 5. 14. 1 Cor. 12. 16, 17. Job 12. 11. 1 John 1.
1, 2. 3. Luke 14* 39. John 20. 25, 27. Lev. 5. 1.
Inward and outward senses regulated by the Word, are great resolvers of
weighty questions; these Senses being every one of them differenced, both in
Nature and in Grace, by their distinct, proper, and singular operation:
Scripture-words do not set out Created Beings, as directly opposite to
right-judging rational Senses. Should we resort to humane reasonings, and to
carnal imaginations in these inquiries, we could acquiesce here; for, these in
several men at the same time, and sometimes in one and the same man, take him
at several times, are varying one from another, and contrary to each other; and
often they are but shows and colors, not the real things themselves; whereas,
the Creator will have his Creatures to be a sensible Testimony to the Truth of
His Word: Those, that do tremble at God's Word, and who do stand in awe of its
Authority, do find sensible Demonstrations within them, and evident arguments
in the things themselves, against such bold assertions, as do call those
expressions to be absurdities, which are literal affirmations, and downright
positions, in this word, and that do mis-name it to be servile superstitious
fear to oppose the meaning of Scripture-phrases. Remember, that I write not now
about Types, Shadows and Figures, contained in the word, where the signs are
sometimes put for the things signified thereby (though here also there be some
outward and visible thing truly represented to our senses) neither about
communication of properties, whereby that is sometimes attributed to a^ whole
Person or Subsistence, which agrees to him but in respect of one of his
Natures, as when God is said to purchase this Church by his Blood, which Blood
properly does appertain to Christ's Manhood, and not to his Godhead; but, of
Created Beings, in their real Existences, which are the same in Nature, that
the Scriptures do call them in name: Scripture and Nature are uniformly
concordant one with another, and all the whole Scripture, as well as all the
whole Nature, does well agree with it self, and therefore let it be further
considered, whether it were a sound and sober, a solid and savoury answer in
him, who being urged with the plain express significant Letter of the fourth
word or command for the Seventh-day Sabbath, does lay down this for one of his
premised propositions, that, though the Letter of the Text ought always to be
carefully heeded, yet always to stick to it; and never compare Scripture with
Scripture, for the better understanding of the sense thereof, may prove a
dangerous snare; (which he applies in part unto a sticking to the Letter of the
fourth Commandment) without minding the scope, sense, and meaning of it;
bethinking, that thereby a man shall cast a mist before his eyes, which will
exceedingly hinder him from the right understanding of the Mind of God therein:
If I should do so, says he of himself, I shall find it so to be: Thus he. That
Word of Christ unto one, who inquired by what doing he should inherit eternal
Life is here now with me, What Luke 10., 25 -- 28.
is written in the Law? How read thou? that answer must we receive in and
from this Law, which is written in this Law, and which we do read so written in
it; for, this is still a right answer: To compare Scripture with Scripture for
the right understanding of that fourth Word, has been already done, and will be
further performed, when I come to treat professedly on that subject matter,
when it will be made evident from the Word, that the whole Scripture does speak
in its true, proper, literal significancy for the Seventh-day Sabbath, the
scope, sense and meaning of the fourth Command, being altogether expressly for
it. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. and 10. 4. Exodus 34. 28. Deuteronomy. 5. 22. and 27. 1 -- 8 Josh 8.
32 -- 35. Prove. 8. 5 -- 9. Romans 3. 19. (2 Cor. 1. 13.) Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19.
If the Law of the Ten Words, particularly of the Fourth, be not literally
expressive of their true, right meaning, I know not what of the Scripture is,
where every discerner at the first reading and hearing may presently know its
meaning, as will be further shown. Here, as it is written, so we read, neither
is it to be otherwise understood, nor in any other sense to be taken, than in
that which does first present it self to the intelligent Reader or hearer: So
far as we are under the Commandingness of this Law, we are under all whatsoever
it speaks this way; and it speaks of the Seventh-day, in express Letters and
Words, as the Sabbath, exclusive of all the other six foregoing days of the
same week, which it names and calls to be days for working in our particular
Functions; every Iota and Tittle thereof being ratified by Christ, and
therefore its Letter does bind: It appears to me to be a vain, daring boldness,
for a worm-man to assert, that the Seventh-day is not the Sabbath of Jehovah
thy God, and thou may do work therein, when this great Lawgiving King of
kings, and LORD of Lords does so expressly affirm and command, the Seventh-day
is the Sabbath of Jehovah thy God, thou shall not do any work: When men will
use more faithfulness and diligence to be better skilled in the literal
significancy of the Original Language, they will see cause to admire the Wisdom
of Aelohim, who has so self-evidencingly put things into words, especially in
these two parts of Scripture, the History of the Creation, and the Law of the
ten words:

The vain affectation of Humane Wisdom, which does thrust upon the credulity of
so many a Doctrine of probabilities (concerning the works of Creation and
Natural Things) from Antichristian and unscriptural Philosophy, but is not
according to Christ, and to his Word, is such a deceitful way of false
reasoning, as makes a prey of Souls, and is carefully to be avoided, and is but
falsely named Science.

Scriptures to be their Rule and their way, may upon due search discover Colos.

this. The smooth-tongued Orators, the deceitful Sophisters, the vain
Philosophers of this World, they, their Sayings and Writings are not a firm
ground for a believing Disciple of Christ to bottom his Faith upon, for as much
as they are but slightly superficial, and scarce likely's; the groundwork of
their Learning being but Humane Fiction, and self-conceited imagination, such a
Doctrine of Probabilities, as we are cautioned against. That Philosophy and
Wisdom, which is derived from the Invention and Tradition of fallible men, and
is according to the Elements of this World, and not according to Christ, is a
spurious wisdom not to be owned by the followers of Christ: what a many of the
Questions and Disputations in Ethnic Philosophy is there about Elements, which
the Scripture does speak expressly at and against? That Wisdom, which is a
worldly humanely-invented wisdom is judged by the Scriptures of Truth, Jam. 3.

to be a terrene wisdom suited to the earthly designs of covetous worldlings;
to be animal fitted to the voluptuous Arts of sensual Souls; and to be
devilish, framed to the proud Models of ambitious Climbers: This corrupt wisdom
is mischievous in the bad Fruits, and the evil effects thereof, how prone to
quarrelsome litigiousness? how contradictingly opposing of the Truth? how
impudently immodest? how headstrongly inswasible? how devoid of good Fruit? how
full of emulating disputes, of fallacious brables, of overreaching
controvertings? observe in experience, and see and say, whether it does not
puff men up, making them 1 Timothy 5. 3, 4, 5.
sick about Questions, about strifes of words, about verbal distinctions, when
every word almost in a debate is wrested and wryed to a multiplicity of
meanings, and a variety of senses, about which they would endlesly cavil, and
craftily equivocate, from whence have started up so many Sects in Philosophy,
and thereby in Theology too, teaching another Doctrine; and they, who teach
this, do not come up to the wholesome words of our LORD Jesus Christ, and to
the Doctrine which is according to right Worship; from such are Christ's
Disciples to withdraw: their unscripturally-curious concertations, and their
empty unprofitable disputations do show a corrupt mind, and do bewray a
devoidness of Truth. Heathenish Philosophy would turn men aside from Christ,
who is the true full essential Wisdom, and from his instituted Worship, unto
carnal reasonings, and a corrupt service. Paul's manner of arguing in these
Cases, was from the true sound knowledge of Created Beings, and of Natural
Things: Act. 17. 18. etc.
Thus he convinced the Athenian Philosophers, who generally counted
Word-learning to be but verbal-babling, and a proclaiming of new Demons or
Devils; and he expressly declares against 1 Cor. 1. 22.
Greekish-Ethnick-Philosophers. The Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers were some
of the most violent opposers of, and subtle adversaries against the Christian
Doctrine: and what? shall rising Graduates in Christian Academies, as they grow
new and further proficients in Learning, be still sworn unto the words of these
Pagan Magistralists? What can we expect from mere Animal or Physical men, but a
worldly Wisdom and humane Learning, that which is 1 Cor. 1. 20. 25. and 2. 12,
14. and 3. 19.
foolishness, whilst themselves are foolish? the foolishness (as these men do
miscount it) of God is wiser; it is their animality, and want of spirituality,
that does put them upon mis-judging of this to be foolishness. The Grecanical
wise men are much in searching after that wisdom, which does chiefly consist in
speculation or contemplation; the wisdom of the incredulous Jews is more
conversant about visible signs, and ocular demonstrations; for, without such
sensible confirmations as these, they will not believe, though multitudes of
them in the days of Christ, and of his Apostles did still continue infidels in
the very face of miraculous attests: Both these Wisdoms are distinguished, and
divided from that Wisdom which is of God, whose Foundations is Jesus Christ and
his Word: the Disciples of Christ, especially those of them, who are in the
office of the Ministry, are to keep the 1 Timothy 6. 20. 2 Timothy 1. 14. (...).
depositum of sound Scripture-doctrine; they are actually to be averse from
profane clamours about empty vanities, which do affix unto words such a sense,
as is wholly alien from their true proper significancy, and which by
sophistical School-distinctions do keep wrangling about Phrases to pervert
their plain right meaning, and do wrest some Scriptures they understand not,
wrongfully accommodating them to maintain some Error, or to defend some Vice.
There have been such as have boasted much of their profound knowledge this way,
who have both themselves erred from the scope concerning the Faith, and have
misled others also. It is a false assertion to affirm, this or that is true in
Philosophy, though in Scripture it be found otherwise: For, if Scripture-truth
do contradict it, then, that, which is so contradicted, is not a truth, but an
error, (however, Philosophy miscal it true) introduced by the Father of lies.
Where any Philosopher did assert any thing about the Creation according to the
Truth, there they had it, either from the Word, or by their outward
Observation, and experience from Senses agreeable to the Word: some of them
either had the knowledge of God's Word, and did read the first Books of
Scripture, or at least had some traditionary Records of them, and did read
them. If that be indeed so, which some, whom I have met with, have affirmed,
that those Acts. 19. 19, 20.
Books, at least some of them, which those Believers and Converts did burn in
that part of the History of the Arts of the Apostles, were the Books of Ethnic
Philosophy, such Higgaioun, in Chaldee does so signify, and amongst the
Rabbines.
as the Heathens Logic, Dialectick, Grammar, Rhetoric, etc. so that, the like
execution were to be done still against the same Treatises, that to this day do
persist in their Treasons against the Crown of Christ, and the Dignity of his
Word, the Libraries and Shops in Philosophic Universities would leave much of
their Shelves empty, though he who writes this is like to be judged and
condemned for an Heretic in the Commonwealth of Learning, and to have his Name
and Reputation killed whilst he himself is alive, and buried before he himself
be dead: But these must be let go for the sake, and in the cause of Christ, and
of his Word, who will have a day of Resurrection of Names, as there will be at
the last of bodies. One of the most learned, and most experienced of natural
Philosophers in the present age, who has been at great cost and pains to make
the most watchful Observations, after all his curiosity in seeking and
searching has consented to the publishing of a Treatise, to let the World of
Vain Affecters of Humane Wisdom, and of Philosophic Learning to know, that,
after all his inquiries, and researches into hidden secrets of mysterious
Nature, he can come at no certainty (especially about the Heavenly Bodies, and
what does belong to them, and generally about what is at a great distance from
our eye, or quite out of our sight) Cosmical suspicions are found in the Title,
and in the Pages; so that, his Philosophy, as to the most of the eminent Works
of the Creation, particularly as to the Celestial Phenomenon, and subterraneous
hiddenesses, is, if not come to plain nothing, yet quite passed into doubt,
suspicion, and skepticism, so that, his acknowledgements are much the same in
this with mine. It would be the Wisdom and Honor of such generous spirited
Virtuoso's now at length to come wholly over to the Scripture-way, for the
proficiency of Arts, and for the augment of Sciences, where and where only such
men of deep understanding can sit down sweetly satisfied. Scripture-Learning is
gone forth conquering, and Word-knowledges will ere long be triumphing. All
other Science is but 1 Timothy 6. 20, 21. (...).
falsely so called, both about the Works of Creation, and the Doctrines of
Faith; however, the deluded world have given it the name, yet it is devoid of
the Essence; it does start a many thorny and argute Questions, and it ingageth
in a multitude of frivolous concertations of Sophisters, and of
Philosophasters, such as School Divinity, or Scholastick-Theology does abound
in, and is almost quite through all over run with Dialectick Nicities, and
Metaphorical Formalities, to raise dust, and to make a mist, that men's eyes can
see but little of their way, as if all knowledge were placed in this, whereas,
it neither does deserve, nor can make good such a name. That is worth the name
of Wisdom, that is Wisdom to 2 Timothy 3. 14, 15.
Salvation, that is the commendable Learning, that is sanctified Learning; and
that is the praiseworthy experience, that is holy experience. It is
Scripture-Science, that is the great, the only 2 Timothy 1. 13, 14.
deposited Treasury of all Writings, that is to be kept for the confutation of
all Opponents, who object against the Truth. The rest are but profane Clamors
about empty Vanities, such as are of a different kind and nature from the
Analogy of Faith; frivolous concertations of Sophists, Logical impertinencies,
Metaphysical puzlings, that do not deserve the Name, because they have not the
Reality of useful Knowledge; where they have any thing of profitable Learning,
as a few grains of good Corn in a great heap of Chaff, there they Originally
received it from the Word, and from the LORD's people, who held forth their
knowledge according to the Word before others. Thus the Chaldeans, from the
Hebrews, so also the Egyptians, the Phenicians, the Grecians, though they all
mingle it with their several Errors, Superstitions and Idolatries. Never yet
could the Disciples of any Unscriptural, Antiscriptural, of any Unchristian,
Antichristian, Philosopher meet with such a complete Model of the Created
World, from any of their Masters, as might give them any through satisfaction
thereabout, though according to their several Sects they have been great
Admirers of themselves: There are of them, who have pretended to more skill
than those, who went before them in the Philosophic Way, and have undertaken
to be Correctors of other men's Opinions and Writings, about a System of the
World, and yet they have not believed themselves, that their own Hypotheses
were true and sound; as particularly, the vertiginous Asserters of the Diurnal
Motion of the Earth. One great cause of his E^^ring, who was the famous
misleader of others into this gross mistake, was his slighting and rejecting of
the Scriptures about these matters; as if it were a subject altogether alien
from Word revelation. The several Earnest Contenders, both for the old and new
Philosophy of later years, after all their new Worlds, which they have set up
and trumpeted before, as if all must bow before their Systematical Calf, and
worship their modular Moloc; yet, what have they done after all their studies
and endeavors, but proclaim openly in Print, that they are both of them out of
the right way, the one and the other wandering out of the path of Truth, and
that they have taken up with such fallacious shows, as are discovered by
Scripture Light to be apparent falsehoods? And therefore the adaptest, shortest,
and every-way best, Method will be to lay aside all the rest, and to take up
things purely from the Word of Christ. All besides this, are but the fanciful
framings, and imaginary Worlds of self-pleasing Dreamers; though they applaud
their own cunning in excepting against the Scriptures, as no fit Judges in
these Cases, yet I cannot commend their Conscience in such a wrongful
dishonorable charge, as they hereby bring in against Christ, and against his
Word. There are some parts of the Created World, which right Reason, and
enlightened Nature cannot but acknowledge, that they must be: As a place of
reward for the Good, and of punishment for the Bad: And yet because they are
not, to those who are on this Earth, exposed to their senses, they cannot be
understood what and where they are, but only by VVord-revelation. The great
mistakes of some, both Translators of, and Commentators upon, the Word History
of the Creation, have been occasioned mostly from hence, that they have
followed Philosophers and their VVritings more than Christ and his Scriptures:
which is the great error, and the blemishing spot in those expositions upon
Job, which many otherwise singular Annotators have completed and published. For
almost throughout that whole Book, much thereof does treat of Created Beings,
as the Heavens, the Luminaries there, the Rain, the Dew, the Snow, the Hail,
the Wind, the Earth, the Water, the Abyss, the Gulf, Hell, Light, Darkness,
the four Quarters of the World, with many others, and with many particulars
about each of these, they do much Philosophize, which I now write, not to
revile the Name, or bespatter the Memory of the departed Authors; nor to
undervalue the many choice Observations, and profitable Collatings of Scripture
every where almost to be found in several of those Treatises; but to warn the
Reader, that when he comes to such passages about this kind of Learning, which
I am now upon, he would not suffer himself to be imposed upon, by the Authority
of those skilful men, in practical Religion, and experimental Christianity, and
Scripture knowledge. All Authorities, Arguments, Experiments, Resolutions, that
we would have to be cogent and convincing, must be soundly Scriptural. That
which the several Philosophers with their several followers have vainly sought
for in their several Principles, is to be found in Truth and Purity only in the
Scriptures. Art thou for Magistral Dictates? Who can so give forth these, as to
command a belief of them, but that Jehovah Aelohim in the Messiah, who alone is
supreme and infallible? Art thou for Abstruse Speculations? who was such
Treasures of Knowledge, and of Understanding, so fully hidden with him, and so
freely imparted by him, as the LORD Jesus Christ, who has all hidden things,
and wonderful Secrets, and rare Mysteries Dan. 8. 13. Man. 11. 19. John. 1. 18.
numbered before him, or ready told, as at his fingers ends, the which, as
occasion and opportunity does serve, he does utter to his Church and People?
Art thou for self-exalted Ratiocinations? What are these compared with him,
who 1 Timothy 1. 17. Prove. 8. throughout Luke 11. 49. 1 Cor. 1. 18 -- 31. 2 Cor.
10. 5.
is only Wise, Wisdom it self, the Wisdom of God, whose Foolishness is wiser
than men; into the Obedience of whom all Humane Reasoning must be captived? Art
thou for outward sensations? Are they any where so clear and certain, so sure
and satisfying, as in Christ's Written Word? where every thing is realized and
proved, either to spiritual or to bodily senses; according as the Objects are,
that are suited either to the one or the other? For, to confute the infidelity,
or to soften the hardness of men's hearts, Jehovah Aelohim, for the confirmation
of his gracious promises has fetched sensible proofs. Genesis 15. 5. Psalm. 89. 2.
Jer. 31. 35, 36, 37. Isai. 66. 22. and in other places.
From the Heavens above, and the Luminaries there, from the Host of them, from
the Earth, from the Waters, from the Abyss, from the successive courses of
Night and Day, from things present and to come. Art thou for skeptical
Inquiries? Whither can thy doubting questioning Soul go for satisfactory
resolution, Song 1. 7, 8. John 6. 68.
but to Christ, and to his Word? So that every one of these severally, and all
of them jointly must at the last come hither, if ever they would be set right.
The late New Philosophers, though they make this to be their Motto, which they
superscribe in their Coat of Arms, Nullius in verba.
Into no ones words (are they sworn) whereby they reject all humane Magistery,
wherein they are so far right: yet if any of them would have it to be also
understood with this great Exception and Exclusion of Christ's Word, as to an
acknowledgement of his infinite Wisdom, and to a submission to his infallible
Authority revealed therein; so that, such either do deny, the profound
Principles of all profitable Learning to be here, and here only, or else do not
search (neither would have others to search) for them, to draw out useful Arts
and Sciences from this full Treasury; it is then in such of them, but the proud
exalting of carnal self, and of corrupted Reason, which the jealous God will
pour contempt upon. But, if withal they will study their Natural History, and
their experimental Art, in the Scripture-Library, acknowledging the fullness,
and the perfection of this God-inspired Book, for all useful Knowledge, as the
Author of it has copied it out, and commented upon it in Created Nature, in
the true Essences of formed Beings, in the proper causalities, and genuine
productions according to their Primitive make; if they will measure the Laws of
Nature by the Laws of the Word, the Rules of Motion by the Rules of the Word,
the Light of Experience by the Light of the Word, that Hypotheses of Physical
Principles, and the Axioms of Mechanical Models, by the Doctrines and
Interpretations, the Positions and Explications of the Word, so far as it has
a reference unto them, they might then be men of Name, and transmit the
profitableness of their Science to Posterity; when the Light of Scripture, and
the Essence of Nature, and the Works of Art do uniformly frame, and operate
together, they do wonders. The Reader here is to take notice, that this
Treatise does commend the Scripture for its containing of Arts and Sciences, of
Learning and of Knowledges, so far as they are lawful and useful, needful and
necessary: And therefore if any Objector would be showing of his wittiness in
asking of a great many Questions of Philosophical Nicities, and of unrevealed
Matters, if I discern them to be impertinent to this subject, and unprofitable
in themselves, they are alien from this inquiry, and do not belong to what I am
searching after, who am persuading of others to be more in the serious deep
study of what is Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
revealed in the Holy Scriptures, and to put together all that which is found
in the Word, relating to any particular Science and Art, and so to improve
that, Coloss. 2. 18.
not intruding into those things, which they have not seen, vainly puffed up by
their fleshly mind. Could I prevail so far, that a due through Collection were
made by the judicious and industrious, of what is already in the Word, about
these wonders in Nature, it might then be afterward further considered,
whether we may not well be without the rest of that knowledge, which any
over-prying Questionist would ask about, wherewith to perplex others, and to
puzzle himself? It is not every Romans 1. 21. and 11. 25. and 12. 16. and 16. 19.
1 Cor. 3. 18.
professing of ones self to be wise, that makes him to bring forth real, useful
Wisdom. It would be folly in us to be wise in our own conceits: That is true
Wisdom, which is Wisdom unto that which is good. What will it be to seem wise,
and not to be wise? The only Wise God who guided the Holy Penmen of Scriptures
in their writing about Natural, as well as Spiritual Things, and about the Arts
and Knowledges of those things, did teach them to understand what they did
write about, and they have left more of this Learning behind them in the Word,
than is yet found out. There is an honorable Virtuosus, who has traveled far
in Natures way, and has made some of the deepest inquiries into Experimental,
Corpuscular, or Mechanical Philosophy, that in the requisites of a good
Hypothesis amongst others of them, does make this to be one of its conditions,
that it fairly comport not only with all other truths, but with all other
Phenomenon of Nature, as well as those it is framed to explicate, and that, not
only none of the Phenomenon of Nature, which are already taken notice of do
contradict it at the present, but that, no Phenomenon that may be hereafter
discovered, shall do it for the future. Let it therefore from hence be
considered, whether seeing, that History of Nature, which is but of human
indagation and compiling, is so incomplete and uncertain, and many things may
be discovered in aftertimes by industry, or in some other way by providential
dispensing, which are not now so much as dreamed of, and which may yet
overthrow Doctrines speciously enough accommodated to the Observations, that
have been hitherto made (as is by himself foreseen and acknowledged) whether
now, the only prevention and remedy in this case (which is otherwise so full of
just fears, of real doubts, of endless dissatisfaction, and of perplexing
difficulties) be not, to bring all sorts of necessary knowledges to the
Pan-sophie, the Alness of Wisdom, in the Scriptures of Truth, where none of the
forementioned Scriptures have any ground to set their foot on, in regard that
Word-Revelations about Natures Secrets, are the unerring products of infinite
Wisdom, and of universal fore seeingness, which are always uniform and the
same, in their well-established order, and stated ordinary course without any
variation, by an unchangeable Law of the All-knowing Truthful Creator, and
Governor, and Redeemer. Eccles. 7. 23, 24, 25. Job 11. 6 -- 10. Psalm. 139. 6
-- 12. Prove. 2. 3, 4.
Wise Solomon himself was much in the dark, and altogether at a loss, whilst he
studied the Nature of many things only in the way of Pagan Philosophy; he
experimented it to be a vain attempt of his foolish imagination to get in that
way the perfect knowledge of the Essence of Creatures, and of Causes, and of
Effects, the Created Works of the Six Days in their first Origin and continued
Being: it was far from him, he evidently discovered, when he had made some
proof of that kind of study and scrutiny: Many Creatures were a^^a far distance
from him, some above him, as the North-heavens, and their Lights, which mere
Humane Astronomies could not sufficiently inform him in; others were below him,
deep, deep, such were the hid Treasures of the Earth, the Abyss, the Gulf, and
Hell; he went round these subject matters in his thoughts, but could not get
through them, into the exact knowledge of them, by all his industry and search;
no private studying, nor open converse could fully inform his understanding,
what the proper Existence, the true Reason, and the solid Art, of the Mysteries
of Nature, as well as of Grace were, till he was entered a Disciple in Christ's
School, where he was better taught by the Spirit of the LORD, in those two
great Books of Scripture and of Nature.

The vain Affectation of Creature-Knowlede in the Apostate Angels, and of
Humane Wisdom in fallen Man, has all along been endeavoring to corrupt and to
pervert, both the pure Word of Aelohim, and his Created Works, whereby they are
misrepresented to the Rational-intellect in wrong shapes.
WE may pass some judgment upon one of the first great Sins of Apostate
Angels, by that Method of Temptation, which the old Serpent did use in
assaulting Eve, and Adam by Eve, which was a vain Affectation of Creature
Knowledge, and of self-invented Wisdom. They would find out a new Philosophy
suited to their own proud concepts of things, 1 Timothy 3. 6. Genesis 3. 1 -- 6.
Eccles. 7. 29.
setting up of self, and of Creatures, as the great Idol, seeking out some
other way of Science and of Worship, than what was formed in them by Created
Principles, and was put into Natural Existences, and both these discovered in
some Word. They sought out many Inventions to see if they could find a chief
Good in the Creature: they would make and try Experiments what might come out
of them. The Tempter had high conceits of his own abilities, and he would have
Man to excogitate other Reasons and Causes of things, than were in Created
Nature, and in Word-Revelation. Hence it is, that this caution is given us,
Coloss. 2. 8, 18, 19.
Let no one deceive you with sublime discourse touching the worship of Angels.
pressing into that he knows not. It is the design of those evil Spirits to
raise up in the mind of man such high opinions of them, as to extol them to be
for knowledge far above the degree of a mere Creature, and to raise a man's
knowledge much farther than he has any good warrant for; and for the
prosecuting this hellish design, they would engage man in converse with them,
to draw man into a discipleship under them, that man might go to School to
these revolted Spirits; as if these could and would teach man higher and better
than the LORD, or his Word and Works have done: By these stratagems and
illusions to beguile man into a Veneration of them for their Scientifick
Excellencies. And thus did these degenerate Angels, and impure Spirits prevail
over Mankind at the first. And this is the cause of all the prohibited black
Arts of Judiciary Astrology, Diabolick Magic, Hellish VVitchcraft, and such
like forbidden Sciences, and Satanical depths, under the gaudy Title of
profound Mysteries, whereby many do lose the prize, that is ready and prepared
at the Goal, while they yield themselves to be drawn aside with such Sophistick
Seductions. These hellish imposters under a specious show of colorable
Religion, would bring in dangerous and damnable Errors and Heresies against the
pure simplicity of the Evangelical Doctrine; and they employed under them such
seducers, as did much corrupt and deceive many of the ignorant and credulous,
fetching their Doctrines not from Scripture Revelation, but from Humane Reason
adulterated, holding forth some curious speculations, taught in the
Philosophic Schools, namely the worshipping of Angels, as middle intercessors
between God and men, arrogating unto themselves, without any just right, a
power of judging and assigning the reward of Eternal Life unto none but such
only, as would subscribe unto their new and false doctrines, defining and
determining the causes of Faith and of Religion, at their own will and
pleasures, and not according to Christ in his Word, and all this under a
pretext of Humility, and of demission of mind, which is the Romish usurpation,
and Antichristian Tyranny at this day. And this is a sort of Wisdom, which is
therefore called Demoniacal, because it has the Devil for its Author. Rev. 2.
24. Jam. 3. 15.
By which Satan would be reputed the learned Master of Arts, and the Reverend
Doctor of Sciences. And would have men to enter themselves as Pupils under his
Tutorship in his College: And therefore in that forementioned place, to the
Colossians cited in the Margin, Paul warned them not to suffer any one, not the
Devil himself to lord it over them, to abuse his power and subtilty upon them,
by pretending that he will give a great Prize of Honor and of Reputation to
them, if they would deliver themselves over to his will in instructing them;
For thus he fallaciously argues in his Philosophy, that men should so walk in
humility, as not to go directly unto God, or unto Christ, but should first
resort unto Angels for their Instruction; and should make Angels, such glorious
Creatures, to be as Mediators between God and them, for the negotiating of all
their Affairs, (which is a piece of Platonic Anti-Theology, and
Anti-Christianism, still maintained and practiced in Ethnic and Papistick
Philosophy) Satan would have them to climb up, and to thrust themselves into
sublime points of hidden Wisdom, as if they were profound Mysteries of refined
Speculation, above the vulgar capacity: which yet are but fantastic devices,
and groundless imaginatious; in the disquisition where of he would have them to
pride and to please themselves, as if they had learn ^ some rare knowledge,
some witty Invention, some singular Art, some extraordinary thing; which yet
was but a fleshly understanding, a carnal wit, a corrupt reasoning, a fly
seduction: taking them off from holding the Head Christ, and from keeping close
to his word, to draw them aside to that vain, false and deceitful Philosophy,
to such affected Creature-knowledge and Humane Wisdom, as would make a prey of
their Souls. Reader, let me take thee by the hand, and lead thee through some
parts of the Scripture Paths, to show thee in this walk, how Philosophy has
been corrupting and perverting the Word and the Works of Aelohim: He that shall
read the Ethnic stories about the Origin of the Universe, may see, how the
Aristotelian pride rejected all Scriptural Revelation of Faith, about this
Worlds beginning, affirming the Eternity of the World by his corrupt Reasoning,
and vain Philosophizing. Thus also the Stoical conceitedness asserted an
Eternal first Matter. The Pagan Astronomers have fancied and argued, that there
are Nine Spheres in the Heavens. The Pagan Poets made all created Productions
to be out of a first Matter, as a common stock and subject of all generated
Beings; out of which every thing was found. This is the Ethnic Physiology of
many others of them. So confused were their Notions, so fabulous their
Narrations. Some Pagan Naturalists do make a Primogenious Fire to be the first
Light, out of which they say the Celestial Lights were composed. Others do make
the Firmament or Heaven to be the fluid watery, or aerial part of a formless
Chaos: Some would make the ancient Nature of men to be commixt of Male and
Female Sex, in one and the same man. And others have made many feigned stories
of his Golden Age. How many corrupt mixtures in Ethnic Poets about the Flood,
about Gods and Goddesses, and their Generations, which many young men are so
defiled and tainted withal in the common Schools of Learning, that it is long,
if ever, before they get rid of them. The Idolatries and Superstitions of
Pagans, which were defended by their Philosophizers, what were they but
corruptings of the Mosaic Platform, of which they had received somewhat by
Tradition? Such a temptation was it even upon the Israel of God of old to learn
the Modes, the Forms, the Ways, the Philosophick-Learning of the Heathen. Deuteronomy.

What an Enemy to the Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Christ was the Grecian
Philosophy? What a disfigured face has it put upon Religion by its
mythologizing vanity? How many of the Original Words and Phrases, by which both
persons and things are aptly named and called in the Scriptures, has it
altered and abused, by expressing them in a different equivocal manner? What a
misshapen Monster are its Religion and Laws, whilst it would so apishly
imitate the Scripture Tradition, as to adulterate it, if it could, into a
resemblance of its own ugliness and deformity? The Corinthian Sophie and
Sophistry, received from and by the Spirit of this World, would be
contradicting the Wisdom of God in a Mystery. The Logicks, that Humane Wisdom
taught, were an Enemy to this; that Physical Animal Man was the Physical
Philosopher, who did not comprehend those things which are of the Spirit of
God, for, they are foolishness unto him, and he cannot understand them, 1. Cor.
2. 4 -- 12. and 1. 18 -- 28.
because they are spiritually distinguished or judged. Thus has the greatest
part of the Sons and Daughters of Adam all the inhabited Earth over, for many
Generations been greatly imposed upon; and still it is so, even unto this day:
And what is yet further matter of more Lamentation, those, who have the name of
the Scholastic Learned amongst Christians, do still pertinaciously adhere unto
many of the Philosophic Errors, and fabulous Tenets. He, that heretofore would
go into the Philosophy Schools here in England, and hear the Lectures of the
most, might sit out a whole hour at a time, and scarce hear one savoury sound
word of Christ, and of the Word of Christ. And there is a design set on foot of
late, to make the virtues of Pagans to be fully equal to, and specifically
identical with the Graces of Christians; as if to turn Christians into Pagans,
were an adapted means to turn Pagans into Christians. I have long stood by, and
been a secret, silent bewailer of this evil, but the LORD has now drawn forth
my spirit to be an open declarer against it, that this way I might be finishing
of my Testimony. There is such a Venerating Esteem in some of the Judgment of
the Ancient, and in others, of the Learning of the Modern Philosophy, that its
likely I shall be thought not so prudently to have consulted, either my own
credit, or my own quiet, in undertaking to be such an Universal Controler of
many Men, Books, Studies, Arts and Sciences, in such an Age, wherein
preconceived Opinions are heightened into such a settled confidence, and grown
into such a gigantick strength: But I have long since committed my All to him,
who has taken the care of me, and has accepted of my acts of commitment; and
there my Soul injoyeth its sweet repose. Neither am I altogether without
expectation, that the adored Almighti^s will use this Treatise to prevail with
some serious Spirits, to entertain a greater commerce with the Scriptures of
Truth, than hitherto they have: And that, the right apprehensions of men's minds
will yet better transform into the true Nature of things. Whilst Philosophic
Arts are so over-prized, there will be but little further inquiry; and whilst
Scripture knowledges are so undervalued, progressions in useful Sciences will
not be promoted. If Rational Intellects may be better rectified, and more
informed according to the Laws of the written Word, and the operation of
Created Beings, I shall rejoice in the profit of any, whilst I am exercised
with contradictings from many with their perverse Brawlings, or disputing
Exercitations, as the Scriptures do call such strifes of words. It is not
unknown to some what slye Artifices Satan has used in the several Ages to
corrupt the Word, especially in the more ignorant Ages under Antichristian
darkness, by Marginal addings, and various readings, unequal dividing, altered
printings, and such other invented devices, whereby to make Truths hidden or
obscure, and errors passable and plaufible, a too deep digging into which, and
an over particular opening of which I judge at present to be no work of mine,
though some late reputed Critics in Original Languages, and in Scripture
knowledges, have been too prone upon any little occasion to set these before
the eyes of such as too often have rather been shaken than settled upon them.
The sayings of Jehovah are Psalm. 12. 6. and 19. 8. and 119. 140. Prove. 30. 5,

pure sayings, Silver refined in an Earthen-melting-Furnace, Cruse, or Oven;
purified seven times. Whatever dross or impurity the Devil, or any of his
Instruments have immix'd with them, they shall have a Fire to be thoroughly
cleansed, and perfectly cleared from it. All and every saying of Aelohim shall
be purified; therefore it is that his servant loves his Word. He is a Shield to
them that trust in him, when those who have either added to, or taken from his
words shall be reproved, and be found to have been lying ones: And I do hope
there will be a pure every way incorrupt Autograph, or Apograph of the
Scriptures of Truth: Neither am I without some Words of the LORD, upon which to
bottom Faith, Expectation and Prayer, concerning this matter; a great and a
glorious Work, highly and fully worth the most serious and diligent search
after, by Christian Princes, by Learned Men, and by Eminent Believers.
Spiritual Discerners should know how to take and to improve this hint; which I
had rather they themselves would industriously pursue, than at present put me
upon any further opening of my thoughts with the grounds of those my
apprehensions, in such an Age of quarrelsome jangling, of endless
contentiousness, Prove. 10. 8, 10. 1 Timothy 6. 3, 4.
and of lips of folly: In the mean time, till there be this glorious appearing
of Christ, and of his Book, according to Prophetical Revelations, I bless his
Name, for himself, and for his Word, and for any gracious Work of his Word upon
my heart; having felt a day of his Power there, whereby he has made me willing
to stand in some holy awe of him, and of his Word, and to dispense it in some
growing measures as I have received it, in uprightness, as of God, in the
presence of God, so speaking it in Christ. If any will so sell this Word of
God, as to fal^^e it by corrupting it any ways, by dealing deceitfully with it,
2 Cor. 2. 17.
by playing the Hucksters with it, adulterating and sophisticating of it, by
mingling of Philosophic Errors, and Humane Inventions, and Unwritten
Traditions with it: Thus to make the market of their own private gain upon some
ignorant deluded soul, by their crafty handling, and covetous dispensing of it
by false glosses, and counterfeit garnishes; giving forth wrong senses, and
making undue applications of it, raising false Doctrines, and inferring ill
uses from thence; let such consider in the fear of Jehovah, how they will
answer it at that last Great Day, when they shall be judged to their Eternal
Estate by that Word, which they have so much wrested and wronged. O how great
cause have they to enlarge in Jehovah's praises, Act. 7. 22. Dan. 1. 4, 17. and

who, having in their younger years taken in much of the Philosophic taint,
were afterward by his Spirit and Grace cured of its gross mistakes and
dangerous errors! that a Moses escaped from out of Egyptian Astrology, Sorcery,
and such other superstitious diabolical Arts! That a Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
and Azariah, got so well off from Chaldaick Books, so full of vain Arts, and of
Idolatrous Sciences! that Aelohim gave them Knowledge and Understanding to
discern Truth from Falsehood; whereby to convince, and to confute Ethnic
Errors, and Paganish Tenets, and that they, were so, kept from prohibitell
Magic, and such black Arts! That the new converted Christians were preserved
and antidored by the Principles and Laws of their true, pure Religion from and
against the poisonous disputes of Epicureans, Stoics, Libertines, Gnostics,
and such other Philosophers! That a Paul, so (...) up in several corrupt (...),
was afterward so savingly enlightened, so sound in Scripture Learning, so
skilful, so useful, so successful a Preacher! O what special matter of great
thankfulness was there here! Vain man would be wise above, and besides, and
against what is written, although Woe be threatried against those, who are wise
in then own eyes, The wisdom of such shall perish. There is a knowledge that is
vain, which a wise a man should not utter. The worldly wise ones of
Philosophers do irride the Christian Religion, and of Politicians do hate it. O
the blessedness, the happy goings on with a straight foot, of them who are made
Wise to Salvation! It has been in all Ages of the Church the device and the
attempts of Saran, and of his Disciples to abuse men by Coloss. l. 4, ^, 18, 19.
paralogisms, by such false reasonings, as by a show and color of Truth do
circumvent the unskilful, and unexperienced in the Word of Righteousness: And
their assaults have been mainly made against the Churches and People of God,
under specious shows of Reason, and of Religion, to introduce somewhat that is
quite contrary to the Nature, Purity and Simplicity, of the Christian undefiled
Doctrine. Hence have they endeavored to thrust in the worshipping of Angels and
of Saints departed, by invocating of them, by dedicating of Temples and of
Altars to them, by making vows to them, with many other uninstituted
Observations of humanely-invented Ceremonies, and diverse Philosophical trifles,
which are no authorized warranty, nor legitimate argumentation from the Word of
God, nor from sound Reason judiciously informed thereby. Oh how daring bold is
humane curiosity, that will adventure to be wise beyond due bounds of sober
knowledge, Romans 12. 3. 1 Timothy 1. 7.
when men will presume to be Doctors, not understanding what they speak, nor of
what they affirm: The Schoolmen, with the Papists and others who have trod in
the steps of those Scholastic Doctors, have generally greatly erred herein, by
obtruding upon others many Forgeries and falsehoods for Articles of Christian
Faith, which were taught themselves only by the dark discoursings of their own
blind minds, such as are their Scientia media, their free will, their inherent
Righteousness, their meritorious Works, their creature-idolizings, with such
like dogmatical decrees, and received opinions of proud men, which they fetched
out of the Metaphysics of Philosophers, and out of the Ethics of Pagans, from
whose corrupt Principles, they would deduce the great Truths, and the saving
Mystesteries of the Christian Religion, bottoming their unsound conclusions
upon their own sandy opinions, thus subjecting Theology to Philosophy, and
Christianity to Sophistry.

Those Books which are commonly called Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy, or the Book of Moses, and of his Writings there, have the
approving Testimony of those true faithful Prophets that did follow after him,
as also of the LORD Jesus Christ himself, and of his Apostles: and the History
of the Creation, and of the Works thereof in the Genesis 1. throughout, and chapter 3.
verse. 1, 2, 3.
Beginning of the Bible, is true in the literal sense, and was intended and
recorded so to be understood, and all those Philosophical Allegorical and
Mystical Senses, which any do give thereof, that are contrary unto this, are to
be avoided and rejected.
THis is the first revealed and written Word, the most Ancient Book, by which
all Humane Treatises, where they err, must be corrected. I exclude not any
other part of Holy Scriptures, but do own all through, as a perfect Summary of
all useful Learning, and do bring them in for the confirmation of Truths, only
the Reader is to remember and consider, that one great part of my present
Design, is to propound some such particular inquiries concerning the Works of
Creation in the several Days of the first Week of the World, and to give such a
Scripture Judgment upon some special Cases, as may restaur and advance true
profitable Knowledges and Arts. Christ in his Word has put his honorable
Title upon the Writings of Moses, that he calls it Mat. 12. 26. 2 King. 14.
6. Luke 2. 22. 2 Chronicles. 34. 14.
The Book of Moses, The Book of the Law of Moses, The Book of the Law of
Jehovah in the hand of Moses. The Neh. 8. 1, 2, 3. Dan. 9. 11. 13. Mal. 4. 4.
Luke 24. 27, 44. Act. 15. 21. Rev. 15. 3. Psalm. 103. 7.
Churches of Aelohim, in the several Ages thereof have given Moses their large
Testimonial, as under their Hands and Seals. It is worth the noting here, that
that rich tormented fool recorded in that History by Luke 16. 22 -- 31.
Luke, had not in all his life time right apprehensions of the invisible World,
by all the helps that the Learned Philosophers, and Natural Historians could
afford him, and that he thought Mankind were by such as those so commonly and
generally corrupted, and misled into errors and mistakes about the different
places and entertainments in that other World, for separated Spirits and
departed Souls, according as their States, Frames and Actings, their
Principles, Rules and Ends were whilst on Earth, that scarce a mere man alive
upon the whole Earth, particularly where his Brethren lived, and with whom they
conversed, could or would set their Judgments right in this weighty Concern,
about the locality of Heaven and of Paradise, of the Gulf, and of Hell; for
which Reason he desired of Abraham, that he would send some to his Fathers
House, one or other, who had been in those places, which men on earth do not so
see; he himself as to himself, having before received an answer, that Lazarus
could not come from on high, to dip his finger in the water as he would have
had him, on in his way, to have cooled the tongue of that damned wretch, in
regard there was such a Gulf between then; so that, there was no ordinary
passage from the one to the other. The reply that was made to him was this,
They (thy Brethren) have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them, if they
hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one
rose from the dead. There was enough in the Writings of these about Heaven and
Paradise, about the Waters and Abyss, about Sheol and the Gulf, about Hell and
that place of Torment, to inform them, and do declare unto them the dreadful
posture of the lower part of the Created World. This Moses, the man and servant
of Jehovah, had, when he was born, the Beauty of Aelohim shining upon him; and
although he were Act. 7. 20 -- 38. Exodus 2. and chapters. Heb. 11. 23 -- 27.

learned in all the Wisdom of the Egyptians, yet has he left upon Record only
that Scripture-Wisdom, which he was taught by the Holy Spirit, being with all
fidelity in the Church in the Wilderness, with the Angel (of the Covenant,
Jehovah Christ sent by the Father) who spoke to him in Mount Sinai, where he
received the Oracles to give unto the LORD's people, whom he commanded a Law,
which is the inheritance of the Church of Jacob. To this Moses, Christ
manifested and made known himself, eye to eye, face to face, mouth to mouth,
Exodus 33. and 34. chapters.
so proclaiming his Name, and making all his Goodness to pass before him, as
that, by a secondary Glory reflected from the LORD upon him, the skin of his
face (...) shine with such an overcoming brightness, as was dazzling to the eyes
of the Israelites, and they were afraid to come nigh him. Of all the Prophets
arose in Israel, there was none like unto Moses, whom Jehovah so knew. This
Moses was a faithful Historian, and those things, which he wrote were not his
own; but 2 Chronicles. 34. 14.
the Truth and Laws of Jehovah, by his handing them out; even John 9. 28, 29.
Enemies themselves being Judges. Christ does Luke 24. 25, 27, 44. Mar. 7. 9,
10. Mat. 17. 3.
approve of Moses, and of all that he spoke and wrote from him. What Moses said
was the Commandment of Aelohim, Mar. 12. 26. Mat. 22. 31. compared. Mat. 22.
24. and Mar. 12. 19. compared.
what he spoke unto Moses, the same is spoken unto us. The LORD Christ has
raised up some or other in the several ages, to plead the Cause of the literal
sense? of the Works of Creation, in the Histoy thereof, in the beginning of the
Book of God, and Wise men especially in this last Age have professed their
expectation of the sound knowledge of Natural Things, and of their real Essence
and true Properties, in this first Weeks Journal of the Created World, by their
several attempts to interpret it this way. The literal sense of Moses's Hebrew
(who was an 1 Chronicles. 6. 1, 2, 3. and 2. 1. and 1. 34.
Hebrew, which Hebrew is the Tongue and Language wherein the he wrote Jehovah's
Laws) is the Mat. 19. 3 -- 9.
ground of all Interpretations; for this Language has apert significancies and
plain properties of speech, which must in the first place be received when
opened, that the natural meaning of the Scripture may be evidently known. Much
of sound Scripture-knowledge, does confist in a right explaining of the Words
and Speeches in those five Books beforementioned, Genesis, etc. by conferring
them with themselves in those Writings of the Prophets and Apostles, which are
Commentaries upon those five Books, by a true and sound explication, as the
Letter is, and giving forth thence the genuine meaning of those Words and
Phrases, which therefore Christ Mat. 5. 18.
has confirmed to every Jod and Chirek. There is Originally, a certain,
proper, distinct, and only one, signification of the Hebrew Words, which is
true and genuine, and which, under Christ, and his Father, and Spirit, is the
best Interpreter of the Holy Scriptures upon the discerning heart of an
experienced Believer: which would be abundantly confirmed by an accurate
Collation of other Scriptures. The first words therefore of Scripture,
particularly and especially is this History of the Creation, must be held forth
in their Primitive meaning, where they are first used in their proper, literal
sense, which does give forth light to the right understanding of them in those
other Scriptures, where the same Words and Phrases are afterward, used. So
that it is generally the common Error and usual Defect in most of our Hebrew
Lexicographers, that they give so many differing, and sometimes contradicting
significancies of one and the same Hebrew word: whereas they should set down
the only one proper, distinct meaning of every Hebrew Root, and carry the juice
of that Sense into all the Branches that do spring from the Root, such a
meaning of it as may well agree with that word, wherever it be met with,
throughout the whole Scriptures. Which one Direction followed and improved with
holy skill, and studious industry by men fitted for such a work, would bring in
a great augment to useful Learning. The Holy Scriptures are written, as they
are to be read, and must be so acknowledged, especially these matters,
Historical and Narrative of the Creation, without doubtfulness or doubleness of
meaning. They use such a manner of speaking, as is not otherwise to be
understood, not to be taken in any other sense, than in that which at the first
reading does plainly offer it self to a man of spiritual understanding. And of
all Scriptures I take Genesis 1. throughout and chapter 2. 1, 2, 3.
this of the History of the Creation, and Exodus 20. 1 -- 17. Deuteronomy. 27. 1 -- 8.
Nehem. 8. 1 -- 8. Prove. 8. 9.
the Law of the Ten Words more expressly to call for this. In which two are the
complete summaries and comprehensive Modules of the Truths and Duties of the
Christian Religion, and of the Nature and Uses of Created Beings. I charge not
darkness and obscurity, doubtfulness or doubleness upon other Scriptures: But
these two parts I have now more particularly in my eye, and all the rest of the
whole Word of God is more or less one way or other a Commentary and
Annotations, an Interpretation and Explication, of these which have a common
and familiar understanding, such as those, who have the due exercise of their
right Reason, and of spiritual Senses, may, as soon as they hear, conceive what
it means. The Scripture-History of Created Beings has its Intrinsecal-self
truthfulness in it self, and its Extrins^^^l-self evidence unto others, which
is best manifest by the holy Spirits clear shining upon the naked simplicity of
the Original Text in a savingly inlightned-heart. The Wisdom of Adam was, and
the Wisdom of Adam's sons would be, (that which made his, would still make
their faces to Eccles. 8. 1. Peshar. Dan. 5 7, 8, 15, 16. and 7. 16.
shine) to know well the interpretation of a Word, the Exposition, the Phrase
of a Word, the Solution, the Declaration, the Explication of it. The Original
Text of Holy Writ in its literal significancy, must, under the Holy Spirit, who
indicted it, and under Christ and his Father, he speaking it from the Father, be
the judging Rule of approving, or condemning of men's Explications of it, and
Paraphrases upon it, and Illustrations concerning it, and of their several
Systems and Models of the Created World, answerable to those Explications,
Paraphrases and Illustrations, as they are found either agreeing with, or
disagreeing from that. Created Beings must be so conceived, expressed and
modelled, as to be an exact counterpart, in all things measured exactly to this
Scripture-History of them. Scriptural Words and Names, by which the several
Created Beings, are rightly called in Jehovah's Word, are the most perfect and
proper Definitions of any particular thing in its most specifical difference
from any other Creature. The only true Essence and specifical Being, and
particular entity of any Creature, is the only true specifical and particular
difference of that Creature, and does give a perfect Definition, and (when the
Word is opened) a proper description of it. Though it were the speaking of the
same thing, as the same thing identically. Thus if it be asked, what is the
Earth? The answer were pertinent and full, to say it is Genesis 1. 2.
Aeretz, in its real Being, in the same sense that the Scripture does call it
so, and for which it has given it that Name. The like may be affirmed of other
Creatures; for, every Created Being had a distinct make, and a different
Existence. When we would describe a Creature by some its properties, as to say,
The Earth is dry, Genesis 1. 9, 10.
Jabeshah, this relates to another Matter, the best Definitions, and the most
significant of Essences are those peculiar Words and proper Names, which are
given to particular Created Beings, in the Scriptures of Truth. Till we are
more brought off, from Philosophical darknings and obscurings of things, into
Scripture Light, and into its way of knowing the true Nature of Created Beings,
there will still be captiousness and contentio^sness about such puzling Terms
of Humane Inventing, as would hold men's understandings in continued ignorance.
Every converted Being is best convertible into it self, and is rightest known
by its own Identicalness. Where Creatures do differ, their Names do differ
also. It would much forward the sound knowledge of the real Truths in those
Matters, if extra-Scriptural Philosophical Terms were altogether laid aside,
and the Expressions were such as we find in the Word of Christ. For, the words
of men's coining are mistaken Terms of Humane Art, and do mislead into Error,
and will still keep up endless contendings: Whereas, the Words and Names, by
which Scriptures do call things, do make us to apprehend Created Beings rightly
in our Minds, according as the things themselves are in their own Nature. This
Journal, this Diary, of the first Week of the Created World, is a plain
Narrative, containing a clear History of the matter of Fact, which things done
are identically declared and described by the most apt significant expressions.
It is a most faithful punctual Record: So that it is no other, no less than to
give Aelohim, the adored Almighties the lie to his faces, to deny either the
plain Truth of the Fact, or the proper significancies of the expressions. The
God of Infallible Veracity does not in any part of this Narration, intend any
thing by any expression, either of falsity concerning things, or of deception
to persons. Private Opinionists can never evade or elude the unerring Authority
of the Exact Expressiveness of the Original Language in this Scripture. He that
would be satisfied concerning the foundation of credibility about the Creation,
must resort to the plain and simple sense of this Text, according to teh
Subject Matter thereof, and the Context of this, and the Collation of other
Scriptures. They very explication of Scriture Terms, does present the Truth of
Created Beings in their own naked simplicity, carrying by the Aspect and
Eradiation thereof, a clear evidence of the Nature of the things themselves.
This History is the Scripture Naturals, and the Christian Physics. Even young
Children that are of quick apprehensions, are capable of taking in of this kind
of Learning with great delight, so far at least as it is demonstrate to their
senses, and as for the rest, their senses may be directed toward the several
places of the invisible World. As to point out to them the several Works of the
Creation on the several distinct days: and with the finger to show them which
is the Expanse, What are the Heavenly Luminaries, the Fowls of the Air, the
Earth, the Waters, the Seas, the Light, the Darkness, the Beasts, the Fishes,
the Worms, Man, and so of the rest: And what is the positure of the Creation?
Those Hebrews therefore are under a great mistake, and do hinder much of the
knowledge of Jehovah Aelohim in this Word and Works, in forbidding any to read
four parts of Scripture till they are thirty years of age, (the age of the
Sacerdotal Ministry,) The beginning of Genesis is one of those places, where
the Creation of the World is described. Whereas, the eye of young ones would
tell them, the Creators Works are a visible, legible Commentary upon his Word.
The second place is the Song of Songs; Whereas, this also does set out
spiritual things, by sensible similitudes, and does describe much of Created
Beings in an affectionate way between the dearest Lovers, Christ and his
Churches, Christ and the Believers, Fellow-believers, and Sister Churches, with
each other: And this Scripture is therefore adapted to the understanding of
young ones, who may the better be taught what to believe, by what they see, and
their own eyes, and other senses may instruct their Souls, and their
Understandings and Affections may be mutua! Helps and Guides to each other. The
third place is the beginning of Ezekiels Prophecy, where the Majesty of the
LORD is described, the beauty of Cherubins, and of the living Creatures, of the
Angels, in their subserviency. The fourth is, the later part of Ezekiel's Book,
from the fortieth Chapter to the end, where the New City is described. Though
these two later places also, being Visions, may the more evidently, as to the
external part of them, be plainly shown to growing young ones; who might in
fewer Months be skilled in Geometry, the Doctrine of Measures, and some other
Arts, as the Truth, Reality and Usefulness in those Knowledges is, than others
will attain unto in so many years, by Philosophical Studies. And what a shame
is it to the Learned Artists of the Times, that Women and Children would
quickly be made more profiting Graduates than themselves. If any Traders in
Humane Wisdom are angry at this discovery for a while, yet let them observe
the workings of convictions by this Scripture Light upon their minds; and they
will, when more considerate, bring in a Testimony for Christ, and for his
Word, if they will be so ingenuous as freely to communicate their Experiences.
For, my hopes do promise to my self, that I shall have most men's Consciences
with me in this Cause, though my fears do threaten, that most men's corruptions
will be against me for this Cause.

Having led the Reader thus far along in his Way, I suppose that now his
Expectations are raised to meet with somewhat of weighty Inquiry about the
Works of Creation on the several Days, the clear distinct knowledge whereof may
have a direct tendency, and an apparent profitableness for the Restoration and
Instauration of Arts, and the Advancement and Augment of Sciences, such of both
these as are useful, and so far as they are thus useful, and all in a clean way
of Pure Religion.
The first Great Inquiry at my Entrance shall be this:

Q. Whether was the LORD Jesus Christ Jehovah, as his Father is Jehovah, and as
the Spirit of his Holiness is Jehovah, they one Jehovah? Whether he were
appointed by his Father, and Anointed by his Spirit to be One Mediator, the
only LORD and Lawgiver? And whether he were the Creator of all things, as the
Father is Creator, and as the Holy Spirit is Creator, they the Creators? And
whether is not this included Genesis 1. 1. and 2. 4.
in the first words of the Holy Scriptures Bereashith baraa Aelohim, and in
that word Jehovah, who presently in the very next Verse after, the short
History of the Creation, is said to be the Creator and Maker?

THe renewing of the wonderful Works of Creation in the rare secrets thereof,
will be found in holy experience to be no derogation to the admirable Works of
Redemption in the great Mysteries thereof, when once it shall be made to
appear, that he who was the 1 Pet. 4. 19. Isai. 50. 2, 3. and 43. 1, 10, 11,
15. and 44. 2, 21, 22, 23, 24. and 45. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 85, 17, 18. and
40. 9 -- 26. Rev. 14. 6, 7.
Creator, is the Redeemer too, and that one great Cause why the Redeemer is no
more believed and adored is, for that this Creator is no more credited and
exalted: It is mainly with a design of Honor to that Christ, whom my Soul
loves, that I am engaged in this Printing-war against such an Host, and so many
Armies of Philosophic Giants, and of Hellish Forces; In his Name and Authority
with the Ephesians. 6. 16, 17.
Sword of his Spirit, which is the Word of God, shielded by Faith, I am called
to go forth against them all. I therefore begin with this, because Jehovah
Christ himself is the Josh. 5. 13, 14, 15.

That the passage here may be the more cleared, I shall publish somewhat about
the lawfulness of mentioning that great and glorious Name, Deuteronomy. 28. 58.
Jehovah; and not only so, but further also, about the profitable use of it;
and further yet, that it is a duty, at fit seasons in its place, actually to
give it a vocal expression, especially now in these later days; though, not
only the superstitious Jews, but many Philosophic Christians, do declaim
against the use and naming of this Word.

There are in the Hebrew Tongue several Names, by which the great LORD over all
does call himself: (...) Psalm. 83. 18. and 68. 4. Exodus 3. 14.
Some are Names of Essence: Others are Names of (...)

and were not only made by him, but have also their continued conversation by

Jehovah joined with Aelohim in the close of that History: he that made the
Heavens and the Earth was Jehovah Aelohim. q Some parts of this Word, are often
put, either in the beginning, or in the end of proper names. 1 Chronicles. 16. 2.
By naming of Jehovah is noted the mode of his Essentiality and Agenty; Psalm.
14, 4. and 83. 18.
It is their sin, who do not call upon this Name, for it is expressly to be
named. It is therefore an Error in the vulgar versions of Greek, Latin and
English, when they render this proper Name appellatively, which has no plural
Number, no demonstrative Note prefixed, is not read in the constructed State,
so as to change its last Letter, neither does it admit of any affixes at the
end: This particular Name of his shall be glorious. This Word has been put into

name of a place, and of an Altar. So that such a place, and such an Altar
could not be rightly named without using that form and manner of pronunciation,
as its Consonants and Vowels are. Exodus 5. ^. and 10, ^0.
Though proud Pharaoh for a while would not know, not acknowledge, this Name,
Jehovah, yet Aelohim by his Plagues upon Pharaoh did at last make his mouth
pronounce it. Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron, concerning them and the
Israelites, Jehovah shall be with you. This is that Hebrew Word which is made
up of all the Vowels, also of Accents, and i^ does confist only of such Vowels
and Acconts: There are in it A, E, J, O, V, it has H to begin a syllable, and H
to and a syllable. It is evident, that the Ethnick's Jove and Jao got its sound
from their hearing of this word Jehovah, to be pronounced by the Hebrews, they
retained some of the Hebraick Origination in the very sound of it. O how
incomprehensibly Glorious is this inf^^ite unchangeable Essence, who was from
all Eternity, is, and will be, to all Eternity, without any mutation! Who
really does declare and exhibit himself to be indeed such a one, as he
manifests and promises himself to be in his Word! Exodus 3. 14.
Jehovah himself was the Author of this Name of his; and it is not attributed

It was foretold, that even the Priests would be despisers of this Name, but

Name: One of Solomon's Names, of his cognames, brought to his Father David by
Nathan from an Oracle, was Jedidjah, beloved of Jah; for Jehovah doved him, and
therefore he sent his Prophet Nathan so to call his Name, because of Jehovah,
that somewhat of Jehovah's Name might pass over into Solomon's Name: for Jah is
the contracted word of Jehovah; which name Jah is annexed to a multitude of
names in the holy Scriptures; whereby the ignorance and unbelief of the
superstitious heart-veiled Jews is justly reproved, who will not acknowledge
this syllable, this word, Jah to be the contracted of Jehovah, lest they should
be made withal to confess, that the Word, the Name Jehovah should by found of
voice be distinctly and expressly in all its Consonants and Vowels pronounced
with due reverence. How much is there of this Word and Name that does (...)
into Scriptures* Sometimes it does set out the glorious excellency of the
Eternal Being; other times the virtue and favor of this Eternal Being; The
acknowledgement, celebrating, and praising of this Being. The profession and
worship of this Being of beings, and much more. This Name is invocated often in
the Word, and is sometimes put for the Command, Will, or Authority of this
Great LORD. How many times is this Expression used, thus says Jehovah, in the
beginning, in the middle, and in the end of a Sentence? The Margin of this Page
cannot contain all the Citations of these in every of the places of Scripture.

as this is, so should his praise be. They who knowing it, will trust of him!
The desire of the Soul of Saints is to it, and to the remembrance of him. They
love it, they call upon it, and do confess to him: They praise it, for it is
high advanced, this Name of his, his alone! This they fear. In this they will
lift up their Palms. In this shall they shout, and be glad all the day. This
they remembered in the night, and have observed his Law, this they see! Good to
confess to Jehovah, and to sing Psalm to thy Name, O most high, specially in
the day of thy Sabbath. Thou will make known this Name of thine to thine
adversaries. How long shall the Enemy blaspheme thy Name, to perpetuity?
Remember this, the Enemy reproacheth Jehovah, and the foolish people blaspheme
thy Name. Thou will lift up the light of thy Faces upon thy gracious Saints, so
that the oppressed shall not return ashamed; the poor afflicted and needy shall
praise thy Name, and blessed be the Name of thy Glory for ever! The Reader is
here advertised, that he has no just cause to be offended at, the expression of
the Faces (in the plural) of Jehovah, or of Aelohim; for so it is in the
Original, and it does set out that great Mystery of Father, Son, and holy
Spirit, and the different manifestations of each of these, according as they
are pleased with, or displeased at such as do make their address to them. The
LORD Jesus Christ is Jehovah, as his Father is Jehovah, and as the Spirit of
his Holiness is Jehovah, they one Jehovah. The Father of Christ is Jehovah.
Thus it is written in the second Psalm, where he is more than once expressly so
called. The LORD Jesus is there said to be the Christ, the Anointed, and the
Son of this Jehovah the Father. And thus it is distinctly applied Psalm. 2. 2,
6, 7, 11, 12. Act. 4. 24 -- 31. Act. 13. 33. Heb. 1. 5. and 5. 5.
by Peter in his Prayer to the Father, by Paul in his Preaching, and by the
Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who recites that Text once and again. It
was Jehovah Psalm. 110. 1, 2, 4.
the Father who assuringly said unto Christ, the LORD of David, Sit thou at my
right hand, till I put thine enemies the footstool of thy feet: For the
Scriptures do often speak of Christ, sitting at the Right hand of his Father.
And Matthew. 22. 41 -- 46. Act. 2. 34, 35.
the LORD Jesus himself does apply this passage in the one hundred and tenth
Psalm, of David's calling him LORD, unto himself. So does Peter, and so also
does the Author of the Epistle to the Heb. 1. 13.
Hebrews. The House of him who is named Jehovah in the Psalm. 69. 6, 9. John 2.

John does write of him, Isai. 54. 13. John 6. 44, 45.
those who are called the taught of Jehovah in the Book of Isaiah, are such as
Christ does interpret in the Writings of John, to be hearers and learners of
the Father: Psalm. 2. 7, 8, 9. Rev. 2. 27. and 19. 15.
That Power, which the LORD Christ had, to bruise the Heathen as Potters Vessels
with an Iron staff, he acknowledges to have received from his Father, in the
Revelation. Which words are taken out of the second Psalm, where he, who gave
Christ this Power, is Jehovah. The Spirit of Christ's Holiness is also Jehovah.
He, who by David Psalm. 95. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11. Heb. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
in the ninty fifth Psalm, did exhort the people to hear the voice of their
God, and is here said to be Jehovah, the great Potentate, is by the Author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews, called the Holy Spirit. And Numb. 21. 5, 6, 7.
Psalm. 95, 6, 7, 8, 9. Heb. 3. 8, 9, 10. Isai. 53. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Neh. 9.
20.
this self same, who in this Psalm is said to have been tempted by the
Israelites in the Wilderness, who also brought that people out of Egypt, and
did lead them in the Wilderness, is, as has been observed, named Jehovah
there, as he is also in the Book of Moses. And this was the Holy Spirit, the
Spirit of Jehovah, as says Isaiah. Psalm. 78. 21, 40, 41. Isai. 43. 10 -- 14.
That people in the seventy eight Psalm have it spoken concerning them, that
they did bitterly provoke him in the Wilderness, and grieve him in the Desert,
which is Jehovah. Which same thing being Recorded in the Book of Isaiah, they
are said to Rebel, and to grieve the Holy Spirit: Levit. 16. 3, 11, 12. 2 Cor.
6. 16. 1 Cor. 3. 17. and 6. 19.
That which Jehovah did say and promise in the Book of Moses, that he would set
his Tabernacle in the midst of his people, that he would walk in the midst of
them, that he would be to them a God, and they should be to him a people, they
walking in his Statutes, and keeping his Commandments and doing them: This is
renewed and fulfilled in the New Testament, as Paul does declare in his
Epistles to the Corinihians, who speaking of Believers and Saints, he says,
They are the Temple of the Holy Spirit, of that living God, as God had before
said in the Old Testament, I will dwell in them, and walk round about in them,
and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people. Luke 2. 67, 68, 70.
2 Samuel 23. 2. 3. 2 Pet. 1. 21. 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18.
He, who by Zacharias in his Song, is said to speak by the mouth of the holy
Prophets, and is called by him, The LORD, the God of Israel, and in Samuel's
second Book is named the Spirit of Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spoke in the
Prophet David, the God of Israel is expressly named in the second Epistle of
Peter, the holy Spirit, who spoke the Prophesies in and by holy Men. This
Spirit is the LORD, as Paul writes in one of his Epistles, the Spirit Jehovah,
the LORD Jesus Christ also, he is Jehovah. The holy Spirit does witness this to
us, in what he says, if their be a due diligent comparing of the Old Testament
with the New, it will thereby evidently appear, that the same, who is Christ in
the one, is Jehovah in the other; in many places of the Scriptures of Truth.
Isa. 40. 3. Mat. 3. 3. Mar. 1. ^3. Luke 3. 4. John 1. 2^.
What the Prophet Isaiah spoke, Prepare the way of Jehovah, is applied by John
the Baptist, to the way of the LORD Christ. Isai. 6. 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10. John
12. 38, 39, 40, 41. Isai. 53. 1 John 12. 34. Psalm. 110. 3.
What by the same Prophet is said to be the Glory of Jehovah, is said by John
in his Writings, to be spoken of Christ, at which time that word of Esaias was
then fulfilled that he spoke, Jehovah who has believed our hearing, and to
whom is the Arm of Jehovah revealed? Which Jehovah, John does interpret of the
LORD Christ; and that multitude, in whose hearing this was spoken, did
acknowledge that they had heard out of the Law, that Christ abides for ever:
Now the Scriptures that do speak of this, which that saying of their does
relate to, do say of Jehovah; Isai. 43. 23. Deuteronomy. 10. 20. Phil. 2. 10, 11.
what is spoken by the same Prophet of Jehovah the true God, that to him every
knee shall bow, and all tongues shall swear, which swearing must be in his
Name, thereby to confess him, when there is a lawful Call thereunto; this does
Paul ascribe unto the LORD Christ. Numb. 21. 5, 6, 7. Exodus 17. 2. 1 Cor. 10.
4, 9.
That which Moses did charge against the unbelieving, disobedient,
unperswadable Israelities in the Wilderness, they tempted Jehovah, by speaking
against Jehovah, the same does Paul in his former Epistle to the Corinthians
affirm to be a tempting of Christ. Paul says, Christ was that Spiritual Rock,
who went together with that people in the Wilderness, Exodus 13. 21, 22. Numb.
14. 14. Deuteronomy. 1. 33. Psalm. 78. 14. 1 Cor. 10. 1, 4. Neh. 9. 19. Exodus 23. 29.
23. Isai. 63. 9.
it was Christ who was figured, shadowed and typified by the Cloud, the Mannah,
the Rock, it was he, who led them in and out, to and fro, there; He was that
Angel of the Father's faces, a Messenger by Office, sent forth to be the
Savior and the Guider of that people, who is expressly by Moses called Jehovah.
He was Jehovah, who went before them, together with them, Psa. 102. 25. Heb. 1.
10.
The Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews does testify that what is spoken of
the Almighty Jehovah in the one hundred and second Psalm, that he aforetime had
founded the Earth, and that the Heavens were the Work of his hands, this same
is applied unto Christ, as done by him, Psalm. 95. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Heb. 3.
7. 8, 9, 10, 11.
The same Author of that Epistle does apply unto Christ, as his voice which
should be obeyed, the which in the ninety fifth Psalm is the voice of Jehovah,
the God of his people. Isai. 41. 4. and 44. 6. and 48. 12. Rev. 1. 11, 17. and
2. 8. and 22. 13.
That which in the Relation, made known to John, the LORD Christ does say is
meant of himself, that he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last,
the same does Jehovah speak of himself, in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah. Jer.
23. 6. and 33. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 21.
It is one of Christ's Names in the Book of Jeremiahe, Jehovah our
Righteousness; according unto which does Paul speak in his former Epistle to
the Corinthians, that Christ is of God made Righteousness, unto those who are
his; and in his later Epistle to him, he says that they are made the
Righteousness of God in Christ. This Jehovah is one Jehovah. So says Moses,
Hear, O Israel, Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Mark 12. 29, 32, 34.
Jehovah our God, Jehovah one. The same said Christ in his Gospel, Hear, O
Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one; which the Scribe, unto whom the LORD
Jesus Christ spoke that, did acknowledge, Master, thou have well said in Truth,
that there is one only God, and there is none other but he; the which is said
by Christ to be an understanding answer. Thus speak Jehovah Christ the
Almighty, the Rock of his people in the Book of Moses, Deuteronomy. 32. 39. Psalm. 18.
31. 1 Cor. 10. 4.
See now, that I, I he, and no God with me: For, who Aelohim besides Jehovah?
and who a Rock except one God? Thus David in the eighteenth Psalm, which Rock
was Christ, as Paul expounds. The same speaks the Prophet Isaiah; Thus says
Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer (which is also a further proof of
the Jehovahship of Christ, this Being in the Prophets applied to the Redeemer;
the which Genesis 48. 15, 16. Job. 19. 25* Psalm. 19. 1. Isa. 41, 14. and 43. 14.
and 44. 6, 24. and 47. 4. and 49. 7. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Ephesians. 1. 7. Heb. 9. 12, 15.
Rev. 5. 9. and 14. 3, 4. Deuteronomy. 15. 15. and 21. 8. and 24. 18.
Redeemer is one of Christ's Names, both in the Old and in the New Testament,
thus says) Jehovah of Hosts, I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me
there is not God. And again in the same Prophet, I Jehovah, and none more,
besides Isai. 44. 6, 8. and 45. 5, ^4, 21. 1 Cor. 8, 4, 5, 6, 7. Ephesians. 4. 5, 6.
me no God. To this well agrees the Testimony of Paul; we know, that there is
none other God but one. To us there is but one God, the Father of whom are all
things, and we for him, and one LORD Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and
we by him: which in another place, the same Apostle does again witness, there
is one LORD, one God. A clear revealing, and a distinct opening of this great
Mystery, does 1. John. 5. 7.
John set before us in his first Epistle, there are three that bear Record in
Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three One are.
There is none Holy like Jehovah, for there is none besides him. And there is no
Rock like our God, 1 Samuel 2. 2.
so Hanna confessed in her Prayer. Thus David, when a word was brought to him
from Jehovah by Nathan the Prophet, about the building of an House to Jehovah
by Solomon, 2 Samuel 7. 22. and 22. 32.
Thou art great Jehovah God, for there is none like thee: and there is no God
than thou alone. And again in that Song of his Deliverances, Who is God besides
Jehovah, and who is a rock except our God? Agreeingly with this was that
passage in 1 King. 8. 60.
Solomon's Prayer at the Dedication of Jehovah's House, Jehovah the God, none
else. This was 2 King. 5. 15.
Naaman's confession, when he was cleansed of his Leprosy, and spoke of
Jehovah Isreal's God, I know there is no other God in all the earth. Isai. 37.
16, 20.
Thus Hizkiah in his Prayer to the Faces of Jehovah, O Jehovah, thou thy self,
thou alone the God, thou Jehovah God alone! Neh. 9. 5, 6.
Nehemiah has the like breathing in his Prayer, Thou that Jehovah alone. God is
one, says Paul in his Epistles to the Gal. 3. 20.
Galatians. Isaiah brings in Jehovah himself thus speaking, Isai. 43. 10, 11.
and 44. 8.
I he, he Jehovah, before me was no God formed, neither shall be after me. And
again, Is there a God besides me? I know none. And again, thus says Jehovah
thy Redeemer, I Jehovah alone. Again, Isai. 45. 14, 21, 22.
Am not I he the Jehovah? and there is no God more besides me, and a just God
and a Savior there is none but I. The like in Hos. 13. 4.
Hoseah, I Jehovah thy God from out of Egypt, therefore should thou know no
God but me alone, for there is no Savior besides me. Zach. 14. 9.
How good is that true Word which Zeehariah has foretold, Jehovah shall be
King over the whole Earth; in that day Jehovah shall be one and his Name one.
Who will give us to see, that we know and acknowledge this, and may cause it to
return into our heart, that Jehovah he God, in the heavens above, and the earth
beueath, and none else. O give we to Jehovah the Glory of his Name! O that our
our hearts were united to fear this Name! Jehovah has said that he will exalt
him, that does acknowledge his Name. My Soul, bless thou Jehovah, and all my
inward parts this Name of his Holiness! The Name of Jehovah is a Tower of
Strength, the Righteous shall run into it and be set in an high place of
safety. Great is Jehovah, and he will do Great Things for his Great Name sake.
This Jehovah Christ was appointed by his Father and Anointed by his Spirit to
be the one Mediator, the only LORD and Lawgiver. This now comes next to be
considered, he is the Mediator, he is 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb. 8. 6. and 9. 15. and
12. 24.
the One Mediator, he is the LORD, he is the Jude, verse. 4.
only LORD, he is the Lawgiver, he is the Jam. 4. 12. Isai. 33. 22.
only Lawgiver. To all and to every of this he was appointed by his Father, and
Anointed by his Spirit: He is the Mediator. A Mediator, as Paul does describe
him in his Epistle to the Gal. 3. 19, 20.
Galatians, is a middle one between others, one that puts himself bet^^een, to
come between two parties; for a Mediator is not of one, but he has (...) unto
two persons or parties, that do by the means or Ministry of this middle one,
treat about somewhat wherein they are both concerned, either by way of mutual
Messages to know one another minds, or to be kept in Union and in Love, or to
be reconciled, where the parties are at variance, and should be set at one. The
two parties here, under present consideration are God^ and Man, as Paul writes
in his first Epistle to 1 Timothy 2. 5. and 3. 16.
Timothy, where he does affirm this Mediator to be the Man Christ Jesus. The
Man, who was God Man, God manifested in the Flesh, as he says in the same
Epistle: That Man, who was Isai. 7. 14. and 8. 10. Mat. 1. 23. Act. 20. 28.
Gnimmaun^ el^; God with us, the Almighty, or the Potentate, or powerful one
with us, as speaks the Prophet Isaiah. He was God, who purchased his Church by
his own Blood, as Paul declared to the Elders of the Church of Ephesus. For,
such a Mediator became us, as had the Natures of both those parties in one
whole Christ, between whom he came in, to mediate, especially since the
disobedience of Man has set God and Man at variance. When Paul had once
understood and found the benefit, having felt the necessity, and enjoyed the
Good and Blessing of this Mediation, and had the Word and the Ministry of
Reconciliation committed to him, he took much holy delight in opening of this
great Mystery in his Epistles to the Churches, discovering, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19,
20, 21.
how God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing their
sins unto them. Paul and such others as were called into that Office, were
Ambassadors for Christ, as if God did beseech sinners by them, and they prayed
in Christ's Name, that such would be reconciled to God: For him who knew no
sin, has he made sin for his people, that they might become the Righteousness
of God in him. Coloss. 1. 19, 20, 21.
It pleased God to reconcile through Christ all things unto himself, both the
Things upon the Earth, and the Things in Heaven. This was much the end of
Christ's coming upon the Fathers sending of him, Ephesians. 1. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
to preach Peace unto us: He is our Peace, and his Gospel is the Gospel of
Peace. Christ was Man, that as Man had offended, so Christ by becoming Flesh,
by taking the Manhood to his Godhead, might pacify God in Man, in the Nature
of Man, and that Christ might be such a One as did suffer together with us, in
our infirmities, and was tempted in all things like unto us, yet without sin:
As the Author of the Epistle to the Heb. 2. 16, 17, 18. and 4. 14, 15, 16.
Hebrews does declare. And Christ was God; Coloss. 2. 9.
in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, as Paul speaks, that
there might be virtue and merit enough in him fully, both to satisfy and
please his Father; and that he might be a fit Interceder for his people to his
Father, and that now Believers might in Christ see and enjoy the Father,
Coloss. 1. 15. Heb. 1. 3.
Christ being the Image of the Invisible God, the brightness and resplendence
of Glory, and the Engraven Form or Impression of his Person, or subsistence; so
that he, who sees the Son, sees the Father also; 2 Cor. 4. 4, 6.
This shines in the face of Jesus Christ, who as Mediator, was also known to,
acknowledged by, Believers under the Old Testament Dispensation, whose
Jehovahship has been already proved from thence, whereby his Godhead is
evidenced, and as for his Humanity it was revealed to them, That Genesis 3. 15.
the seed of the woman should break the head of the serpent, and that, of the
fruit of David's body should Christ be raised up concerning the flesh, Psalm.
132. 11. Act. 2. 30.
as Peter in his Sermon has expounded that prophecy in the one hundred thirty
and second Psalm; and Christ did several times appear under the Old Testament
Administration, as a man; whereby he did visibly foreshew that Great Mystery of
his being God manifested in the Flesh, in time. Thus particularly does the Word
speak, that when Jacob was left alone, Genesis 32. 24, 28, (...). Hos. 12. 3, 4, 5.
a man wrestled with him till the morning, whom Jacob did call the Mighty God,
whence Jacob named that place, where this wrestling was, Peniel; that is to
say, the place where he saw the Faces of the Almighty One, even of him who is
Jehovah. For thus the Prophet Hosea does speak, that Jehovah says, At Bethel
God found him, meaning this Jacob whom he met, and to whom he appeared, and
there he spoke with us, he, who has Jehovah for his Name of remembrance, which
also is another proof of Christ's being Jehovah. It was made known unto them,
that Christ was both God and Man in one. Hence in Isai. 7. 14. and 8. 10. and
9. 6, 7. Mat. 1. 23.
Isaiah Christ has the name of Gnimmanu-el, God with us, which (...) more
eminently and evidently fulfilled, when he was born of the Virgin (...) as is
declared in the Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the LORD by that Prophet, saying, Behold the
Virgin shall he with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and thou shall call
his name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted, God with us. And Zehar. 13. 7.
the Prophet Zeehariah does call Christ such a Man as was withal a
Fellow-companion with the Father. There were several Types of this of old: Such
a one was Moses, when he stood between Jehosnuah and his people, to show unto
them the Word of Jehovah. Such was Aaron and his Sons the high Priests, who
were anointed to this Office to appear before the LORD for his people, to offer
Sacrifice for them, to pray unto Jehovah for them, and to bless them from
Jehovah. Thus did the people humbly supplicate to the Judge of all by a
Mediator for Grace. They, of them, that were believing, appealed unto the
Father for right, presenting themselves, and referring their Cause to his
Righteous Judgment in a way of (...) 1 King. 8. 28. Psalm. 72. 20.
interpellation, entreating his favor, and praying against condemnation, in
regard, that all his just demands were fully answered in the Virtue and Merit
of his Son, in whom his Soul was well pleased, who was represented by the Exodus
28. 29, 30, 38.
High Priest, that did bear the Names of the people upon his Heart, when he
went in into the holy place for a Memorial before Jehovah continually, and who
did bear the iniquity of their holy Things, for favorable acceptance of them
to the Faces of Jehovah, which was a significant Figure of the Mediation of
Christ, who by the Author of the Epistle of the Hebrews is called, Heb. 3. 1.
and 9. 11. and 2. 17. and 4. 14, 15, and 10. 21. and 8. 6. and 9. 15.
The high Priest of our profession, and the high Priest of good things to come,
in which respect he is the Mediator of a better Testament, as he is commended
in that Epistle: The Figures and Types which did shadow out his Mediatorship
under the Old Testament dispensation, having received under the New their full
accomplishment and perfection in him. It was Christ's Person, and Office, and
Place that Zechar. 3. 1 -- 8.
Jehovah. the high Priest in the Prophecy of Zechariah did represent, when he
stood before Jehovah. It was Christ whom Mal. 3. 1.
Malachi does call the Angel, or the deputed commissioned Messenger of the
Covenant, he, in whom all the promises of God, even to Believers under the Old
Testament were yea and Amen. Genesis 12. 3. and 18. 8. and 22. 18. Act. 3. 25.
Gal. 3. 8, 16.
What was promised unto Abraham, that in him, in his seed, all Families of the
Earth should be blessed; the same does Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians
apply to Christ, as accomplished in him, who was that promised Seed. Hence
Christ is called Heb. 7. 22.
the Surety of this better Testament or Covenant, he, who by giving the hand,
did promise to the Father on the behalf of those, whom the Father gave unto
him, for whom he did undertake, and who did work their peace by making of a
Covenant between God and them; for who else could have set his hand to go
through with so great a Work? Who is he that can promise in his heart to draw
near unto me, says Jehovah in the Prophet Jer. 30. 21.
Jeremiah? None else was thoroughly fitted, and fully furnished for this, but
only Jehovah Christ. Christ is the 1 Timothy 2. 5.
One Mediator. Of this the Apostle Paul speaks in express words: There is one
Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. And thus it was in the
Figure and Type of Christ's Mediatory Office, Lev. 16. throughout, Heb. 9. 23,
24, 25, and 9. 11 -- 15. and 7. 26, 27, 28. and 8. 1.
the true lawful high Priest was ever but only one in a course of succession,
who went into the Holy of Holies once a year, not without blood which he
offered for himself, and for the misdeeds or ignorances of the people, to make
Atonement for them, to cleanse them from all their sins before Jehovah; whereby
was signified, that Christ, that Faithful Great chief. High Priest, being once
entered into Heaven by his own Blood, has found a Ransoming, or obtained an
Eternal Redemption: For such an high Priest became us, Holy, Innocent,
Undefiled, separate from sinners, and becoming higher than the Heavens, to whom
it was not needful every day, as to the High Priest, to offer up Sacrifices,
first for his own sins, afterward (for the fins) of the people* For that he
did once, when he offered up himself. We have such an High Priest, who is set
at the Right Hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the Heavens. He that is Heb.
5. 10. and 6, 20. and 7. 1, 2, 10. 11, 15, 17, 21, 24.
Malchitzedech, the King of Righteousness, is this Priest; the Eternity of his
Priesthood is established for ever by his Father by an Oath, which Priesthood
cannot pass over from one to another, either by succession, or by descent, as
that of the High Priests did of Old, but it does, and will abide everlastingly
in himself. This Jesus Christ, that Righteous^ One is the 1 John 2. 1, 2. Heb.
9. 24. and 7. 25. Dan. 9. 17.
Advocate of his people, or their Spokesman, who appears on their behalf before
the Face of God', and to make intercession for them. O^ the blessedness of
those who have this Mediator to be a Redeemer of them, an Interceder for them!
He gave himself for them, a Ransom for them, that he might redeem them! He
reconciles them in the Body of his Flesh through his Death, making peace by the
Blood of his Cross! He, by the everlasting Spirit offered himself unblameable
unto God! His Blood purges their conscience from dead works to serve the
Living God^. For, by one Oblation he has Consecrated for ever those that are
sanctified; The chastisement of their Peace did lie upon him. He is the Price
of their Redemption, He is their Surety* He was faithful in all the House of
God, He sits at the Right Hand of the Majesty in the Ephesians. 1. 20, 21.
heavenly highest place, far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and
Dominion, and every name that is named, not in this world only, but also in
that which is to come, all things being made subject under his feet. Who shall
condemn them? Christ is able perfectly, even unto the full end to save them! by
him only they come unto God! he always lives to intercede for them! He prays,
not for the World, but for those whom the Father has given him, and who
believe on him, that they all may be One, as the Father in Christ, and Christ
in the Father, that they also may be one with the Father and with the Son, that
the World might believe that the Father sent Christ! How earnest was Christ in
his Prayer to his Father, that he would Sanctify these by his Truth, that he
would keep them in his Name from the Evil one; that they might have his joy
fulfilled in them! It is Christ's desire, that where he is, there they also may
be, that they may behold his Glory, which the Father has given him; and that
the Love, wherewith the Father has loved Christ, may be upon them. Christ does
know, that the Father hears him always. How ready are such, as have
Fellowship with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, praysingly to say as that
multitude of the heavenly Host, in their Song; Glory to God in the highest
heavens, on earth peace, good will toward men! This Christ is the LORD. Unto
Mat. 28. 18.
all Authoritative Power is given in Heaven, and in Earth. And O how much is
there that does depend on this! That LORDship which is here intended and meant,
is, Christ's Kingly Dominion, his Royal Government, into the Office whereof he
is called, it being one of his Glorious Names, Rev. 17. 14. and 19. 16. Psalm.
146. ^.
King of kings, and LORD of Lords. For so it is written in the Revelation, that
was made known unto John. 1 Cor. 12. ^.
No man can say the LORD Jesus, if not in the holy Spirit. It is a gift in the
holy Spirit even to acknowledge this, believingly to apply it, and obeyingly in
all things to be subject to it. Thus we read in the Esai. 9. 6, 7.
Prophet Isaiah, A child shall be born unto us, and a Son given to us, upon
whose shoulder the dominion shall lie, and his name shall be called, Wonderful,
Counselor, The mighty strong God, The Father of hidden ages, The prince of
peace: Of the increase of his dominion, and peace shall be no end, upon the
throne, and in his kingdom to stablish it, and to strengthen it with judgment,
and with justice, from henceforth for ever: The zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall
do this. This is applied to him, who is God-Man, and can belong to no other.
Ezekiel. 1. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
Ezekiel saw this in that glorious Vision, wherein was presented before him a
Throne of Royal Majesty, upon which was a likeness, as the form of Man, and
this was the form of the likeness of the Glory of Jehovah. This was the
representation of him who is Jehovah-Man, of Jesus Christ, the ever Blessed
LORD of Glory, whose the ruling of the whole World is. All the Creatures must
stoop of him: He is she Head-Captain of all the Hosts of Heaven, and of Earth;
for so did the Scriptures bring him in. To this does that Revelation answer,
which was made known to Rev. 1. 8 -- 18.
John, Who saw one like unto the Son of man; He that calls himself the first
and the last, and did appear as an absolute complete Governor, wise for
Counsel, and strong for Power. Like unto this was that which Dan. 7. 9 -- 14.
Daniel saw in the night-visions; For, behold there came one like the Son of
man in the clouds of heaven, after that he came to the ancient of days, and
they caused him to come near before, and to him was given dominion, and honor,
and the kingdom, that all people, nations and tongues should honor him: his
dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not perish, or be taken away,
and his kingdom shall not be destroyed. This was the shining forth of Christ's
Princely Honor, of his Kingly Administration who was God-Man. And by this was
manifested the great Mystery of the Work of Redemption, which does further
demonstrate the Mediatorship of Christ: Who came from his Father in Heaven to
Men on Earth; and having finished his message here, he ascended from men on
Earth to his Father in Heaven, there to present himself before him, on the
behalf of those* whom the Father gave unto him. This is he of whom the Prophet
Jet. 23. 5, 6.
Jeremiah spoke, that he, shall reign and prosper, one of the stock of David as
Man, and yet withal he, who should be called Jehovah-zidkenu, Jehovah our
Righteousness. So that, he is Jehovah-Man. The same of whom Mica. 5. 2. Mat. 2.
4, 5, 6.
Micab foretold, that he should come out of Judah for to be a Ruler, and whose
goings forth are of old from the days of Eternity, which in the Book of the
Generation of Jesus Christ is spoken of this G^immanu el, God with us. Zach. 6.
12, 13.
Thus the Prophet Zachariah describes him, at the least in the Type, He shall
sit and bear sway upon his Throne, and he shall be Priest upon his Throne. Luke
1. 31 -- 33.
This was the voice of the Angel to Mary concerning Christ, The LORD God shall
give unto him the throne, he shall be King for ever, and of his Kingdom there
shall be no end. Act. 2. 36. and 5. 31.
This is to be known for certain, that God has made him for a LORD, him has
God by his Right Hand exalted for a Prince and Savior: Thus did Peter openly
confess him before men.

This Psalm. 97 1. and 99. 1. and 10. 16. and 93. 1, 2. Mat. 28. 18. and 9. 1,
6. John 17,
Jehovah Christ has reigned, he is reigning, and will reign. How high is that
Majesty, with which he is clothed! He has girded himself with strength. Stable
is his Throne from then, from the Time that he has been, from before any
created Time, as we now measure it, he from Eternity. He, by the Authority of
his Mediatoral Office has Royal Prerogatives, to pass Acts of Grace, to grant
Pardons to particular returning sinners, to speak the Peace of this into the
conscience, to give the joy and comfort of this into the heart. Christ had a
Glory with his Father before this World was, and a love from his Father before
the Foundation of this World; as the LORD Christ himself does acknowledge in
his holy heavenly Prayer to his Father, as John has recorded it. He is high
above all the people; let the earth be glad, let the many isles rejoice. Come
let us shout joyfully to this Jehovah, let us shout triumphantly to the rock of
our Salvation! For Jehovah a great God, and a great King above all gods: He is
the King of Righteousness, and the Prince of Peace. All kings shall bow down
unto him, and all nations shall serve him. Christ is the Deuteronomy. 6. 13. and 10.
20. Mat. 4. 10. 1 Samuel 12. 24.
only LORD, him only must we serve. So does Christ interpret Moses, and so did
the Prophet Samuel teach. Let us hear the LORD Jesus himself speaking thus in
the Book of his Generation, Mat. 23. 8, 9, 10.
One is your leader even Christ, One is your Father which is in heaven, One is
your Master, even Christ. Paul does write in the Epistle to the same purpose,
we have 1 Cor. 8. 6. Ephesians. 4. 5. 1 Timothy 6. 15. Ephesians. 1. 20 -- 23. and 5. 23.
Coloss. 1. 18. and 2. 19.
One LORD Jesus Christ. And again, There is one LORD. And in another place, He
is the blessed and only mighty LORD, the King of kings, and LORD of lords. He
is the Head of the Church. His Office is so appropriate unto him, as that his
Priesthood Heb. 7. 24.
cannot pass unto any other, but remains in himself for ever. There is no
other Name given us under Heaven, whereby we may be saved. Thus Jude 4.
calls him, The only LORD God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, speaking of that
peculiar propriety, that the called ones who are sanctified have in him. He
trod the Press alone, and there was none of the Nations with him. Thus did
Isai. 63. 3. and 33. 22.
Isaiah hold forth Christ's Kingly Power, and his Princely Government, in
redeeming and saving of his Elect, and in subduing and destroying of his
Enemies, as says the same Prophet in another passage of his Book. Psalm. 2. 7,
8, and 72. 8. and 45. 6, 7. and 96. 13. and 98. 9. and 103. 19. and 145. 13.
Isai. 40. 10. Psalm. 110. 1, 2.
The Father has given him the Nations for his Inheritance, and the ends of the
Earth for his Possession. His Dominion shall be from Sea to Sea! His Scepter is
a Righteous Scepter, he has loved Righteousness, and hated iniquity. He shall
judge the people with Righteousness, and the poor meek ones with judgment and
equity. He is the Rulling One by his Power from ever. Jehovah has firmly
prepared his Throne in the Heavens, and his Kingdom rules over all. His
Kingdom is a Kingdom of all Eternities, and his Dominion in every Generation
and Generation. Behold the Arm of this LORD Jehovah shall Rule: His Enemies
shall be made his Footstool; and in the mean time he shall Rule, though in the
midst of them. How great and wonderful are thy Works, LORD, thou Almighty God.
Just and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who should not fear thee LORD,
and Glorify thy Name? For, thou art alone Holy! For all Nations shall come,
and worship before thee, for thy Judgments are made manifest: All Nations
shall can thee blessed. Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who do
mavelous things thy self alone! And blessed be the Name of thy Glory for
ever! And let all the Earth be filled with thy Glory! Amen, and Amen! This
Christ is the Lawgiver. Thus was it spoken by Isaias the Prophet, a Jehovah is
our Judge, Jehovah is our Lawgiver, or Statute-maker. Thus was it prophesied
by Jacob, concerning Christ, at the least in Type, that the Scepter should not
depart from Judah, and the Lawgiver from between his Feet, until Shiloh come,
The Savior, the Safe-maker, the Author of Prosperity, of Tranquillity, and
unto him the obedience or the gathering of peoples. Christ was to spring from
Judah, as an after birth, which, as is employed, should be of the Flesh of a
Woman, according to which Prophecy and promise Jehudah is said to be the
Lawgiver, in the sixtieth, and in one hundred and eighth Psalms: He it was,
who formed Decrees, and who made Laws. He was at the least figured by that
Lawgiver, who was with the Princes and Nobles of the People, when with their
Staves they dug and delved the Well at Beer; and of the same did Moses speak
concerning the Tribe of Gad, when he declared the Blessing and the Portion, the
Provision and the Protection, to be from this Lawgiver, Christ himself calls
the Law his Law, in the seventy eight Psalm, wherein he himself speaks unto
his people; for so the holy Spirit does expound it in the Book of Christ's
Generation, when he opened the parable of the Sower and of the Seed. One of the
Laws of loving one another, in bearing one another burdens, is in express
words said to be the Law of Christ, by Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians. It
was Jehovah Christ, who spoke and gave the Law of the Ten Words at Mount Sinai,
when God's Chariot the twice ten thousand thousands of Angels were there; Psalm.
68. 7, 8, 17, 18. Ephesians. 4. 8, 9, 10.
This Lord was with them. He it was, the same, who ascended on high, who led
captive a Captivity, who had taken gifts in Adam, among or unto men: For, of
this LORD Jesus Christ does Paul teach us to understand this place in his
Epistle of the Ephesians, where speaking of this One LORD, he says, when he
ascended into the height, he took Captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
Now this, he ascended, what is it, but that he also first descended into the
lower parts of the Earth; he that descended is the same also that ascended far
above all the Heavens, that he might fill all things: Exodus 3. 2 -- 6 Acts 7.
30 -- 39.
This was that Angel of the LORD, who appeared to Moses in the Wilderness of
the Mount Sinai in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a Bramble-bush, which
Angel of Jehovah was Jehovah, God, the same who spoke the living Words at
Sinai, which he writ by the Finger of God, and delivered them unto Moses to
give unto the people, as Stephen does apply it in that defense, which he made
for himself against the Council. Isai. 63. 9. Exodus 13. 21, 22. and 14. 19.
Neh. 9. 12, 13, 14.
The same Angel of Jehovah's Presence spoken of in Isaiah, which Angel was
Christ sent to be a Mediator between God and Man, of whom John 5. 46.
Moses wrote long before, who was Jehovah, who led the Israelites by day in a
cloudy Pillar, and in the night by a fiery Pillar, to light them in the way
wherein they should walk, who came down upon Mount Sinai, and spoke with them
from Heaven, and gave them Righteous Judgments, and Laws of Truth, good
Statutes and Commandments, and who made known unto them his holy Sabbath, and
he commanded them Precepts and Statutes, and a Law by the hand of his Servant
Moses, as Nehemiah had declared. This also is held forth by the Author of the
Epistle to the Heb. 12. 18. 26. Joh. 3. 13. and 6. 38. Dan. 8. 13. Hag. 2. 4 --
7.
Hebrews, who shows, that it was the Voice of Christ which moved the Earth,
when he gave the Law at Sinai, he who came down from Heaven, as Christ himself
speaks of himself, in what John writes of him relating to some passages in the
Wilderness. He, who is the LORD from Heaven; He, who is the Hammedabber in
Daniel, the speaking one: which Speaker the Hebrews were exhorted to take heed
they did not reject. That, which the Author of that Epistle does refer unto in
the Prophet Haggai; about moving not only the Earth, but also Heaven, is
further note-worthy in what goes immediately before, and does bring it in, yet
now be strong thou Zerubbabel, says Jehovah, (thus does the Father encourage
to the building again of the Temple,) and be strong thou Jehoshuah, Son of
Josadak high Priest, and be strong all the people in the Land, says Jehovah,
and work, for I am with you, says Jehovah of Hosts, with my Word (this is one
of Christ names) in whom I made a Covenant with you, when you came out of
Egypt, and my Spirit that abides among you; For thus says Jehovah of Hosts,
once again a little it shall be, and I shall cause the Heavens and the Earth,
and the Sea and dry Land to shake. The Father made a Covenant with that people
in Christ the Angel of the Covenant, Christ was there when they covenanted with
him in the Wilderness; and his holy Spirit was there. It was Compare 2 Samuel 7.
21. with 1 Chronicles. 17. 19. Dan. 9. 17.
for his words sake, for his Christ's sake, that this favor was shown him, as
also other Scriptures compared do manifest. Moses John. 5. 4 6. Romans 3. 21, 22.
wrote of Christ, who had Testimony from the Law; Moses and the Law did bear
witness of Christ, and brought in Articles of charge, which accused those Jews
that did refuse the Mat. 17, 3, 4. Mar. 9. 4, 5. Luke 9. 30, 31, 32, 33.
Messiah; when Christ was transfigured, Moses appeared together with Christ in
Glory.

CHrist is the only Lawgiver, Jam. 4. 12. and v. 8. Hos. 8. 12.
the Apostle James does manifest this fully, saying. There is one Lawgiver,
who is able to save and to destroy, he is the only One. To speak according to
the Scripture, his Law is a Kingly Law: This is one of the chief blessings, and
one of the chief privileges of his Covenant people. This Jehovah is their
Statute-maker, Isai. 33. 22. Heb. 5. 9.
as says the Prophet Isaiah. This Jehovah is their King; he their Savior; he
will deliver and preserve them. He is made unto all those who obey him, the
efficient cause of eternal Salvation. It is he who prescribes Laws, and who
constitutes the Rule of Life. The Greatest and the Highest of earthly Princes
is a Subject to this King of kings, and LORD of Lords. Deuteronomy. 5. 22. and 33. 2,
3, 4, 5.
When this Supreme Governor had proclaimed his ten Words or Commandments, he
gave them unto Moses, who was King in Joshurun, that he might bring them to the
people, and might see the Judicial Laws duly executed, when any were fount to
be transgressors of the ten Words. The Magistrate is to take care that both the
Tables of this Law be well kept. Deuteronomy. 17. 14. -- 20.
The King, who was set over the people of Jehovah Christ, was the write for
himself the Copy of this Law in a Book: and it was to be with him, and he was
to read therein all the days of his life, that he might learn to fear Jehovah
his God, to keep all the Words of this Law, and these Statutes to do them; that
his heart be not lifted above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the
Commandment to the right hand or to the left, to the end he may prolong his
days in his Kingdom, he and his Sons. This was the charge which Jehovah Aelohim
gave to Jos. 1. 1, 7, 8, 9.
Joshuah, the Commander and Leader of his people: The Book of this Law shall
not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate therein day and night,
that thou may observe to do all that is written in it; for then shall thou
make thy way prosperous, and then shall thou deal understandingly. Have not I
commanded it thee? be strong and courageous. Exodus 25. 40. Act. 7. 44. Heb. 8.
5. Exodus 40. 16, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 32, 33. Heb. 3. 2, 5.
Moses, as holy as he was, as highly favored as he was, and as wise a
Governor as he was, yet had nothing left to his prudential determining, but,
as he was told and shown in the Mountain, so must he declare, what those Laws
and Judgments were, which to observe: He must keep exactly to the prescribed
Pattern. And it is recorded to his commendation, that he did so, causing all
things to be done as Jehovah commanded him. 1 Chronicles. 28. 11, 12, 20. 2 Chapter 29.
25.
Thus King David received Commandments by the Spirit, by the hand of Jehovah in
a written Word; and to this Rule must King Solomon keep: And so should the
Superior Powers to all Generations. We are not to attend, to advert, or to
give our minds to such commandments of men as do turn away Truth, or as do turn
away from the Truth. Tit. 1. 14.
Thus wrote Paul to Titus: O what Laws, Statutes and Judgments are so holy,
just and good, as those which Jehovah Christ has given! would it not be the
wisdom and the understanding of Nations to walk according to these? How daring
is the attempt for any man or men to think to change these Laws? why do the
Heathens tumultuously rage, and the peoples meditate vanity? The Kings of the
Earth set themselves and the Princes do plot together against Jehovah, and
against his Christ, Let us break the bands of the Father, and of the Son, and
cast their cords from us! This is the rebellious Language, of such a would cast
off all sign of subjection. O who will give, that Kings were prudent, that the
Judges of the Earth were nurtured? To serve this Jehovah with fear, and to be
glad with trembling? To kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and they perish in the
way, when his anger shall burn suddenly, O the happy straight progress of all
that hope for safety in him! To all, and to every of this, that has been
forementioned, Christ was appointed, by his Father, and anointed by his Spirit.
The Father himself has declared this in the second Psalm; That Psalm. 2. 6, 7,
8, 9.
he has anointed his King upon Zion, the Mountain of his Holiness, does and
will tell the Decree, Jehovah said to me, Thou my Son, I this day begat thee.
Ask of me, I will give the heathens thine inheritance, and the ends of the
earth thy firm hereditary possession. Thou shall rule them with a rod of iron,
as the vessel of a potter thou shall scatter them in pieces. Of this Jesus does
Peter understand this Psalm, and from hence does the Author of the Epistle to
the Hebrews prove Christ's Call to his Office of Priesthood. Act. 4. 24 -- 28.

This Christ was the first anointed with the Spirit, and with the Oil of
Gladness above his Fellows, Psalm. 45. 7.

Christans, both in the Old and New Testament. He charged other men not to
touch his Christians, his Christ's, his Anointed Ones, in the one hundred and
fifth Psalm, those who were thus consecrated to him, and set apart to high and
honorable Offices and Employments under him, by the Anointing of his Spirit,
which they had from him that is holy, as writes John in his first Epistle:
Which Name was revived and received at Antioch, Act. 11. 26.
where the Name was renewed in the Apostles times, and they were again called
Christians: For there are the Fellows of Christ, being taken into Consortship
and Partnership with him in the Anointing, whereby they are also made Kings and
Priests, as John speaks in the Revelation. There oily pourings out of the
Spirits were in a Psalm. 45. 2, 7. John. 3. 34.
fullness upon Christ, not in lesser measures. Jehovah possessed me, says
Christ in the Book of Proverbs, in the beginning of his way, before his Works,
before them, before the World was, Prove. 8. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.
I Anointed, before the beginning, before the first things of the Earth, when
yet there was no deeps was I brought forth, when there was non Fountains heavy
with Water, when yet Mountains were not fastened, before the Hills was I brought
forth, yet he had not made the Earth nor Streets, no not the beginning, nor
dust of the inhabited World. When he fitted the Heavens there was I, when he
appointed the Circuit upon the Faces of the deep, when he fortified the Clouds
above, when he strengthened the Fountains of the deep, when he laid his Decree
upon the Sea, that the Waters should not pass the commandment of his mouth,
when he appointed the Foundation of the Earth. Thus speaks the Father by the
Prophet Isaiah, concerning his Son, Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect
my Soul delights, I have given my Spirit upon him, he shall bring forth
Judgment upon the Nations. The LORD Christ Isai. 42. 1 John 6. 27. Isai. 61.

was warrantably, lawfully called to this Office, God the father sealed him
thereunto. As Christ speaks of himself in what John does write of him, and
elsewhere in his Prophet Isaiah, The Spirit of the LORD Jehovah is upon me,
therefore Jehovah has Anointed me to preach. No man takes this Honor to
himself but he, that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also Christ did not
take this Honor to himself to become an high Priest, but he, that spoke unto
him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee, gave it him. As also in
another place he says, Thou art a Priest for ever, upon my word, O
Malchi-tzedek. Hence it is that Christ is called, by the Author of the Epistle
to the Hebrews, the Apostle and high Priest of our profession, and by Malachi,
The Angel of the Covenant: So that Christ had a Testimony from his Father, for
his being appointed unto this Office, not often after he had taken Flesh of the
Virgin Mary, when a Voice came from Heaven, saying, This is my well beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased, and when the holy Spirit descended as a Dove
out of Heaven, and abode remaining on him, but long before under the Old
Testament Dispensation: And before that also, Prove. 8. 22, 23.
even before the World was, he the anointed. This LORD Jesus Christ was
Administrator under both Testament Dispensations of Grace. He chief in Office,
and all others, that were lawfully called and rightfully sent forth, were such
as did minister and serve under and for him. He was the LORD God of the holy
Prophets, as John calls him in the Revelation, and as the Father sent him, so
did this Christ send his Apostles. It was this Christ who so often appeared to
Moses, as has been shown. Christ was Faithful to his Father who constituted him
in Office, and who was Heir of his own House. In which House he employed Moses
to be his Servant, who was also faithful to and under Christ. It was the Spirit
of Christ, who did witness in the Prophets of Old, as Peter mentioned in his
first Epistle. He was the chief one in Sion, as Isaiah calls him, who did
declare the things that were to come to pass; and this is the same Son of God
in whom the Father has spoken to us in the last days. Him has God made LORD
and Christ, and to him was given Dominion, Glory and a Kingdom, that all
People, Nations and Tongues should serve him. The Father has given unto him
dignity to execute Judgment; he has given all Judgment to the Son. All must
obey and stoop at the command of this ever Blessed LORD of Glory, who has
proclaimed this of himself, that all Authoritative Power is given him in
Heaven, and upon the Earth. God has committed all into his hands. He shall
reign, till he has put all Enemies under his feet. This is he that is
appointed of God, the Judge both of the Living, and of the Dead. In this was
the Love of God manifested toward those whom he chose in Christ, and gave to
Christ, that he has sent his only begotten Son into the World, that they
should live by him; so loved he the World, that he thus gave Christ, that
whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting Life. O how
much has he commended his Love to such! He was first in the Love, him has God
set up for a Prepitiatory-covering, an expiatory reconciliation. Thou LORD art
worthy to receive the Glory, and the Honor, and the Power, for thou have
created all things, and through thy will they are and were created. This
Jehovah Christ was the Creator of all things, as the Father is Creator, and as
the holy Spirit is Creator. They the Creators. Jehovah was the Creator of all
things. This Genesis 1. 1. and 2. 4.
Aelohim was he, who gave his Creatures their Being, as Moses has delivered to
us the History thereof. To this do others bear witness in the Scriptures.
Praised be Johovah Aelohim, that made the heavens and the earth, 2 Chronicles. 2. 12.
said Huram. Thou Jehovah alone, Neh. 9. 6.
said Nehemiah, thou have made the Heavens, the Heaven of Heavens, the Earth,
and all that is therein, the Seas, and all that is therein, and thou make
them all alive; and the Host of the Heavens worshippeth thee; Jehovah God of
Hosts, who like thee, mighty Jah! thine the Heavens, thine also the Earth, the
World and the plenty thereof: Thou have founded them. And again, Confess ye to
Jehovah, to him that made the Heavens with prudencie, to him that spread out
the Earth above the Waters. Thus says Jer. 10. 10, 11, 12.
Jehovah himself, who taught his people by his Prophet Jeremiah, what to say,
The gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth shall perish from the
Earth, and from under this Heaven. Who but Jehovah God has made the Earth by
his Power? Who but he has prepared the World by his Wisdom? and has stretched
the Heavens out by his Understanding? Thus Zach. 12. 1.
Zachariah brings in Jehovah speaking, He who spreads forth the Heavens, and
foundeth the Earth, and forms the Spirit of Man in the inmost of him. Mar.
13. 1^.
Thus in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, God is said to create the Creature. Thus
did Act. 14. 15. and 17. 24.
Paul reason with the men at Lystra, The living God has made the Heaven, and
the Earth, and the Sea, and all that which is in the same. The like did he at
Athens, God who made the World, and all that therein is, he is LORD of Heaven
and Earth. And elsewhere, Of God and by him, and to him are all things, to him
Glory for ever, Amen. The Father was the Creator of all things. So Isai. 42. 5,
6.
Isaiah brings him in, speaking, Thus says God Jehovah, he that created the
Heavens, and spread them abroad, he that stretched forth the Earth, and that
which issues out of it; he that gives breath unto the people upon it, and
spirit to them that walk upon it, I the LORD have called thee in Righteousness,
speaking of his Son Christ. This did Peter acknowledge in his prayer, Act. 4.
14 -- 27.
LORD, thou art the God, who have made the Heaven, and the Earth, and the Sea,
and all things which are in the same, Who by the Mo^th of thy servant David
have said, Why do the Heathen rage, and the people have thought vain things?
The Kings of the Earth are risen up, and the Rulers are gathered together
against the LORD, and against his Christ, for in truth they were gathered
together against thy holy Child Jesus. This does Paul witness to in his former
Epistle to the Corinthians, We have but one God, 1 Cor. 8. 6.
the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him. The holy Spirit also is
Creator. How many are thy Works, O Jehovah! So sings the Psalmist, all of them
have thou done in Wisdom, the Earth is full of thy Riches. Thou will send forth
Psalm. 104. 24, 30. and 33. 6. Genesis 1. 2. Job 26. 13. and 33. 4.
thy Spirit, they shall be created. And thou will renew the Faces of the Earth.
And in another Psalm, By the Word of Jehovah, the Heavens were made, and all
the Host of Heaven by the Spirit of his mouth. The Spirit of Aelohim was the
Maker and Cherisher of them. Thus does Job set it out, he through his Spirit
adorned the Heavens. And Elibu elsewhere applys it in his own case, The Spirit
of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has quickened me.

THe LORD Jesus Christ, he also was Creator of all things: It was in and by
this Head Captain, that the Heavens and the Earth were accomplished, and all
their Host. Isal. 37. 15, 16.
This did Hezekiah acknowledge, when he prayed to him that sat between the
Cherubins, Thou thy self, thou alone art the God, of all the Kingdoms of the
Earth, thou have made Heaven and Earth. He that is the first, and he also who
is the last: Which the LORD Christ does apply unto himself in the Revelation.
He speaks of himself in the Isai. 45. 5, 12. and 44. 6, 8, 24, and 66. 1. 2.
Rev. 1. 8, 11, 17.
Prophet Isaia, Mine hand has founded the Earth, and my right hand has
measured the Heavens with the Palm. And again. The Heaven is my Throne, and the
Earth is the Footstool of my feet, mine hand has made all these things. It is
the Voice of the Redeemer in the same Prophet, I Jehovah do all things,
spreading out the Heaven, I alone, and who stretching out the Earth by it self.
Heb. 1. 1, 2, 10. Psalm. 102. 25.
God by his Son made the Angels. Thou LORD in the beginning have founded the
Earth and the Heavens are the Works of thy hand. To this Christ the Son, in the
Epistle to the Hebrews is that passage in the one hundred and second Psalm
rightly applied, John 1. 1, 2, 3, 10. Psalm. 33. 6.
it was by the Word of God that the World was prepared. In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God: all things were made
by the same: and without the same, no not one thing was made that was made: The
World was made by him. Thus does John bring in his Testimony for him. Whereunto
that Ephesians. 3. 9. 1 Cor. 8. 7. Coloss. 1. 15 -- 18.
of Paul does well agree, God created all things by Jesus Christ, and elsewhere
he says, We have one LORD Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
That to the Colossians is full to this purpose, where the Apostle having
described the Redeemer, the LORD Jesus Christ, by his inward relation to his
Father, he being the Image of the invisible God; he then sets him out by his
outward Relation to the Creature; he is the first born of every Creature,
begotten before all Creation, or before any thing was created.

This he does convincingly prove, and clearly illustrate by evident
demonstration; the Reason is strong, which he draws from Christ's being the
efficient cause of the Creatures being, the continued preserver of them, and
his Glory being the great end of their Being. For in him, by or through him,
were all things Created, which are in Heaven, and which are upon Earth, which
are visible, and which are invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or
Governments, or Powers, all things were created by him and to him, and he is
before all things, and all things do consist together by him: He is Rev. 1. 8.
and 22. 13. Isai. 41. 4. and 44. 6. John 8. 58. and 17. 5. Genesis 2. 1, 2, 3.

the Aleph and the Thou, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, who
was, and who is, and who is to come. Before Abraham was made, I am, said Christ
of himself. It was his Prayer, Glorify me, O Father, with the Glory which I
had before the world was, with thee. It was this Christ who Created the first
seven days, and established their order to continue in their successive courses
to the Worlds end. It was he, who when he had perfected his Work, that he had
made in the six foregoing days of the first Created Week, rested in the seventh
day. It was he, who blessed the Seventh day. It was he who sanctified the
Seventhday, because in it he had rested from all his Work: Thus it was from the
beginning, unchangeably so to remain, and go on to the end. This he expressly
revives in his after proclaiming of this Law of the Sabbath, that it might be
remembered, Six days Jehovah made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all
that is in them, and rested the seventh day, and hallowed it. Thus injoyning
both by his own Example and Command, the perpetual Observation of that
particular Seventh-day, in order of Time in its successive course in every
weekly revolution, as the appointed day for holy Rest. That day, and that only,
and no other day of the Week. Thou LORD art worthy to receive the Glory, and
the Honor, and the Power: For thou have created all things, and through thy
Will they are and were created. O that those who dwell on the Earth, and every
Nation, and Kindred, and Language, and People would fear him and give Glory to
him, for the hour of his Judgment is coming! And that they would worship him,
that made the Heaven and the Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of Waters.

And the holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Aelohim, and the Spirit Jehovah,

of Jehovah, as Paul elsewhere, is also called, The Aelohim of Israel. It is
Aelohim, who dwells in his people as in a Temple. So says Moses, which Paul
applies to the holy Spirit: These three are the Creating one: Eccles. 12. 1.

Eliphaz in the same Book. Should a man be more righteous than Aelohim? Should a
man be purer than his Makers? Hence is Tzijon encouraged in the later days not
to fear; For says Jehovah by his Prophet Isaiah, to her, Thy Makers is thy
Husbands. Thus does the Psalmist call for an Hallelu-jab, or praise ye Jab,
Sing ye to Jehovah a new Song, his praise in the Church of gracious Saints, let
Israel rejoice in his Makers, in those who making him; Let the Sons of Tzijon

head in it, in its true first meaning, to which the Scriptures do agree: and
diverse Scriptures do speak of Troops, of Bands, of Hosts of Companies, of
Soldiers, under an Head-Captain: to this Honor and Office was Christ assigned
and appointed by his Father; which also this word does remarkably set out. If
it be a composition of Roash an Head, or Captain, or Head-Captain, and Shith,
to put or to place in martial order, or in Battle-array: For, thus we may find
the word used; The LORD Christ does put his Hosts or Armies into Rank and File

Hebrew, wherein that Tongue does delight, though it does not so easily admit of
composition in appellatives. The Compare Genesis 1. 1. with chapter 2. 1. Ps. 24. 8,

sorts of Learning, yet it was a case determinedly judged aright by him, that
all their knowledge was as no knowledge at all, without this, and in
competition with this, this being the groundwork of all. I shall to this end
cull some useful passages out of the nine first Chapters of the Proverbs of
Solomon relating to this matter. In which one Book; so small a part of the
Scriptures, there is more of sound learning in profitable Arts and Sciences

tumble in thither, step forth to their recovery out of these snares, by turning
them from the Error of their way to the Truth. He who has willingness, skill
and opportunity, to carry this meditation through this Book of Proverbs, may
gather up and put together a great deal more of this profitable matter. I must
hasten now to some further Inquiries, for the progressive advance of useful
Learning.

Of the One (which when another Day was Created, was the First) Day of the
Created World, and of some of its Works.
Q. Whether this Earth at its First Creation were without Form and void? So
that Genesis 1. 2.
Thou and Bohu be truly and rightly predicated of Aeretz? Or whether Tohu and
Bohu be not dictinct Creatures from the Earth, locally distant, or two Created
Places, the one setting out the Gulphy-empty-space, the doleful place of Hell?

THe clearing up of this, A.
that the Gulf and Hell are certain distinct places of a Created Nature, does
contribute much for the discovery of the Positure of the World, which is the
higher, and which the lower part of the Universe in its System orderly
disposed, as also for the conviction of Infidelity, and the confutation of
Atheism; It being a great and gross Error in the scoffing Anti-Scripturists,
who daringly affirm, that the Gulf and Hell have no certain Existence in the
Nature of Beings, nor definiteness of locality in the Creation of Places, but
that they are mere Bug bears to terrify Fools, and Scare-crows to fright
Children withal, my work therefore here will be to examine, whether the Earth
at its first Creation were formless and vord, so that Tohu and Bohu, as
commonly interpreted be truly and rightly predicated of Aeretz or not? Whether
Tohu and Bohu be or be not distinct Creatures from the Earth locally distinct,
or two created places, the one setting out the Gulphy-empty-space, the other
the doleful place of Hell? Then to assert, and prove from Scripture and Nature,
that there are really such places, And in what parts of the created World those
places are, whereby the positures of the Creation will be manifested, in what
order they are placed one above or below another, which is one of the secrets
of Nature, hidden from vain Philosophers, but revealed in holy Scriptures.
Toward the bringing in of somewhat of a very useful discovery, that this Earth
was not created deformed, not an empty, un^^apen, or misshapen lump, confused
or without fashion, not such an amazing and shameful thing, as one, who has a
name amongst the Learnedest of Critics, and who does undertake to correct
others in their rendering of these words, does amiss call it, not such a
formless Chaos, as it is Heatheneshly standered to be, let it be well
considered, whether they do not great wrong to this Work of Aetohim, who do
express the significancy of these words to be that, which is contrary to fight
Order, to good-Digestion, to method^^ Framing, and to com^y Modesty, as
somewhat to be ashamed of, and then do (...) this to the Earth? Seeing that

collation of other Scriptures it will appear, that, this Verb Genesis 1. 2.
Hajitha.
Was, may properly and distinctly belong to Tohu, and to Bohu (as also to
Vechoshe^.) As for the significancy of the words in the Original let all the
Scriptures be considered that do make mention of them, whether, Tohu be not the
empty (gulphy, astonishing, desolate,) space, and Bohu the doleful place, (the
serious meditating whereon makes to sigh and to groan;) These words are
Substantives and not Adjectives or Participles, and do properly stand by
themselves. So that to praedicate these abstracts of the Earth, as if it were
amazingness, shamefulness, deformedness, formlesness, emptyness (or
shapelesness) and voidness, (wastness or vanity) seems to reproach Creating
Aelohim, who did all in wonderful Wisdom, and having approved of every Work of
his, he rejoiced therein. As for the Structure of Speech, Hajitha. This is one
property of Hebrew Speech, that often a word, which is before expressed, is in
the latter branches omitted for brevity and for other reasons.
the Verb belongs in common to Tohu, to Bohu, (and to Vechosh^^) appertaining
to all the members of this speech; being put to one, it is to be accommodated
to all, as if it were expressly added to every one, Aeretz was created, Tohu
was, Bohu was, each of them was in being truly subsisting; though the verb be
but once written, yet being once spoken it has The skilful in the Language
know this to be common in the original words and phrases.
a convenience with the, other members by a common right. There is great
evidence and natural comeliness that is in this kind of Scripture-speaking. It
cannot be rightfully affirmed of this Earth in the abstract; as many do, that
the Earth was emptiness, or an empty thing, at its first creation. For this
appears to be expressly denied by Jehovah Aelohim in Isa. 45. 18.
another Scripture, because, thus he said, when he shows himself forth as the
Creator of those Heavens, and the Former of this Earth, that having made the
Earth, he firmly prepared or established her, and that he did create her Not-
Tohu or Not-emptiness, he created her to be dwelt in, or sat^in, or to be
inhabited, or to Sabbatize in. Thus does he expressly deny what men do affirm.
Tohu only is the Gulphy empty uninhabited place of the created World. It being
only the Luke 16. 26.
Gulphy passage to Hell; Several parts of the creation being distinctly spoken
unto in that Prophecy by Isaiah, as the Text and Context will evidence. All
other spaces and places are filled up and inhabited, but only this Tohu which
is empty. In the higher Heavens there are the glorious Inhabitants of that
better Country. There are the upper Waters, and many other Treasures: In the
Expanse are Sun, Moon, and Stars, those bright shining Luminaries. In the Air
are Fowls, on the Earth are Men and Women. Beasts, Cattle, Worms, in the Waters
are Fishes, in Hell are Devils and Damned; only Tohu is void, So that there is
a Vi^^um in Nature, contrary to Paganish Philosophy Compare Isa. 34. 11. with
Jer. 4. 23. Hence the ancient Hebrews call Tohu Line^ nihil signans, and Bohu,
Perpendiculum rude ad quod non p^test (...).
as Tohu does properly note, That, which is contrary to such a Line as is drawn
to distinguish, to put in order, in building upon some Foundation, which Tohu
does want. So Bohu is that, which is contrary to a Foundation and Building or
Extruction, contrary to a perpendicular, by which the Building is directed.
There is no Foundation or Extruction in Hell, for it is bottomless, at least so
far, as that, the damned know no bottom of it.

Tohu not being praedicated of Aeretz, neither is Bohu, which is a word that
follows after Tohu, which Tohu has Bohu always joined with it, as in nature
of created places, so also in Genesis 1. 2. Isa. 34. 11. Jer. 4. 25.
Scriptures. This Tohu and Bohu therefore also are not matter and form. The
Jews and Christians have learned this wrong conceit in the Schools of Paganish
Philosophers, and then afterward they affayed, whether they could defend it by
their wrying^: or this Scripture, to work it into their error, As for the
Situation and Place of these, they are the lowest parts of the created World.
Jehovah Ae^ohim has Job 26. 7.

which is that part in the Positure of the Creation that is directly
diametrically opposite unto the North-point: So that the North part is the
uppermost part. There are some Heavens Ephesians. 4. 8, 9, 10. Heb. 7. 26.

useful ways, might this be improved in experimental Christianity! I have given
the Hint, which should quicken up others to pass further into this re^search;
more may be collected out of the Scriptures about the exaltation of the North,
and If need were, to use such arguments unto men, their mouths who oppose this
might soon be stopped by the express concessions and affirmations of humane
Authors. As the Earth is founded Ps. 24. 1, 2. Exo. 20. 4. Ps. 78. 69. Job 38.

under the Waters, in a lower place: It is opposed to the highest Heavens, as
the lowest place. Here are the shadowed profundities below the Sea, the lower
Abyss and Vorago. All the controversies about Sheol, about the local descent
into the craving place, concerning which so many Treatises have so hotly
contended, must by this Word-discovery receive a clear full determination; For,
in no one Scripture which I am as yet thoroughly convinced by, must Sheol
necessarily, or does Some Scriptures I know are commonly brought a^ if it did
set out the Grave, but after much seeking to God and searching into his word
about this deep secret, I judge that the Translaters have not rightly rendered
Sheol the Grave, nor the commentators done well in so interpreting of it.
However I leave it to the further consideration of the enquiring in elligent
Reader.
Sheol properly, signify the Grave, but some lower place than that. Diverse
sheets of Paper might be filled with this Subject from what is gatherable out
of the Word, which also is another very profitable discovery if pursued with
diligence and received with meekness, and would overturn the whole of Ethnic
Philosophy about the System of the World and the positure of the Creation. The
middle of this Earth is not that common center of the Universal World, toward
which all heavy bodies would naturally descend there to sit down and enjoy
their Rest: The Stone, or Brass, or Lead, at the end of the Line in the
perpendicular would move downward under all the Earth, beneath the Waters, if
it met with no obstacle. According to Geometricians own principles, If right
Lines do stand upon right Lines, making the Angles on either side equal, then
either of those Angles is a right Angle, and the right Lines that stand erected
are perpendicular Lines to those upon which they stand. Such perpendicular
Lines can never meet in one and the same center and point, or interfect one
another, for there is no enclining of the Lines any more to one side then
another, There is no reclining or obtuseness in any of the Angles; aequidistant
perpendiculars prolonged and moved never so far on both parts, will never meet
either on the one side or on the other. All right Angles are equal to one
another. Such perpendiculars are always equal distant the one from the other.
Could such perpendicular Lines meet at a point, if they were prolonged, they
will necessarily intersect, and the Angles on both sides would not be equal.
These perpendicular Lines are Rectangled parallels; they are equal
perpendiculars constituted between the same parallels; they are Equi^ngled,
were there Parallelogram-lines drawn: all the quadrilateral (Figures would have
opposite Parallels; from one and the same point can be drawn but one
perpendicular Line to divide a terminated right-lined Diameter (equally
dividing the Circle) into two equal parts, if that perpendicular Line be drawn
from the Circumference to the Center: and from one and the same Point and
Center there can be but one perpendicular Line drawn to that part of the
Circumference, where a right Line does touch the Circle, and where that
Perpendicular does cut that right Line into two equal right Angles at the point
of touching: All other Lines drawn from the same point, have not correspondent,
proportional, parallel, equidistant parts, neither will they make right equal
Angles in that point where they do touch or inters^ct that right Line. The
opposite sides are not parallel, neither can they pass into a
right-angled-equilateral quadrilateral Figure, into such a Square which has
the four sides equal, and the Angles right-lined. Of all the right Lines drawn
from one and the same Point on a right Line, that Line which is Perpendicular
is the least, constituted on one and the same Base, so that there is but one
Perpendicular from or to this one and the same Point, standing erect upon a
right Line. According to Statick Law there can be no Angular point of two
several Lines concurring in it, without an unequal divergence or divaricating
of the two lines from it proportionably, as it is nearer or further distant
from the point. Improve we this to overturn humane Philosophy. Let there be an
Erect Wall square of a right-angled equilateral, quadrilateral Figure; and let
plumb-lines be let fall from the two sides of it, they will naturally move
downward to, and if way were made into the Earth perpendicularly, and these
perpendiculars would be equidistant, and would be always, if prolonged,
equidistant and never meet at a Center and Point, which is quite contrary to
the Tenet of such Philosophers, seeing there cannot be a Motion of two heavy
Bodies from the circumference in two parallel lines toward one Center and
Point: For still the nearer they come to this supposed Center, the nearer they
must be to one another, which affirmation is quite contrary to Sense, Reason
and Scripture, as may be seen with the eye in the forementioned parallel Motion
of the two Plumb-lines, Thus the Seamen have their Perpendiculars which do move
right down, and do make perpendicular lines equidistant from each other, every
where in the Waters that are Psalm. 107. 23. and ^26* 6. Pet. 3. 5. Psalm. 104.
5, 6. and. 135. 6.
under this one Earth, if it be well examined by the same natural Motion of
Plumb lines equidistantly downwards, it will be found, that all Plants do
naturally grow out of the Earth perpendicularly, and so the Earth does nourish
them; and thus all grounds do bear only according to the plain or level
thereof, and not according to any unequal or concave Superficies. A Garden,
though the Ground be rising and indented, yet may be paled round with as few
equilateral Pales, as if it were plain and level, because all the Pales do
stand perpendicularly, one of the most quick-sighted into, and of the most
experienced about Natural History has declared, that as for the moving of Dense
Bodies to a point or place, (which was the opinion of the Ancients) it is a
mere vanity. I have not found, though I have searched withcare and industry in
this Inquiry any one word or phrase in the Old and New Testament, which does
properly signify a common Center of this visible World; whereas, there is
express mention made of a Isai. 34. 11. Zach. 4. 10. 2 King. 21. 13. Isai. 28.

Mishkoloth, Mishkeleth, Bedil. Consider Job ^8. 5. which speaks of a ruling
Line that was stretched over this Earth, that inclined downward: a measuring
thread or rule, a straight perpendicular plumb-line, to which Maso^^s and
C^^penters have an eye; a Square-rule.
Perpendicular, of a Plumb-line: That one place of the Sea, into which the
Waters were gathered at the first Creation, is a distinct different place from
this pretended Center in the middle of the Earth, which the vain affecters of
Humane Wisdom, would have the congenial parts of the Chaos immediately to apply
themselves unto, gathering round in about it, as if this frame consisted by an
equilibration of parts to the Center of Gravity. There is not such an
Elementary and Subcortical Earth, as is below any the lowest Fundus of the
Waters, as if this were the Foundation, and Basis of the World, and the
centrical Orb of it; for the deep Waters, the Gulphy space, Sheol, and the
doleful place are below the Earth; they are subterraneous, as being under the
whole body of the Earth, and not only under the upper Superficies of the Earth,
and therefore these are called the out places. O, who will give, that the
Atheist and the Infidel would lay this more to Heart! The holy Scriptures do
set out these lower places with terror to fright the Sons and Daughter of Adam
from those bypath of sin, that would lead thither. There are the Prove. 9. 18.

there. Should I paraphrase upon the several scores of Scriptures that do
express this, how many pages would it take up? This is the place of deadly
shadow, of weeping, of gnashing of teeth, of chaining, of gnawing worms, of
burning wrath, the wicked are thrust down, and driven in there, What? will
those who forget God never believe this, till they feel it? O how rich is that
Grace, how free is that Love, which does deliver a chosen number from this
wrath to come! which does take them up into the Ephesians. 1. 3, 20. and 2. 6. and

Holy Place!
Heavenly places, the better Country, the Holy Place, the Holy of Holies, the
Eternal Tabernacles, whither Christ is Ascended to prepare Mansions for his
Disciples, that he and they may be together, ever together. There is the place
of the manifested Residence of Aelohim's Glory.

Q. Whether Genesis 1. 2, 4, 5.
that Darkness which does distinguish and separate between the Night and the
Day in a large Day, be but the want or privation of Light, and so mere nothing?
And which was first, the Darkness or the Light? And what is the
Scripture-Doctrine, according to Created Nature and Order, concerning Days,
Weeks, Months, Winter, Summer, and Years?

THe affecters of Humane Wisdom do thus wrongfully determine, A.
as if it were only the absence of Light, or the shadow of the Earth coming
between us and the Sun; when the opacous or thick body of the Earth does
interpose between us and the Sun, darkness follows. Whereas the Scriptures of
Truth will inform us, that Genesis 1. 1, 2. Isai 45. 7.
darkness is a Creature, darkness was, it has been, Hajitha.
that is, it truly has subsisted, it does and will subsist. For so is the
Nature of that Word; to Be, is to Exist, to have Essence. 2 Cor. 4. 6. (...).
A creating Word was used with respect to darkness. The Creaton made Light,
spoke it out of Darkness: It is called to the Night, Genesis 1. 5.
which is a real name, and is a real thing. It sets out Ephesians. 5. 8. Isai. 45.

real things: It has Genesis 1. 2. Gna^.
a place, a local seat: The Darkness was over the Faces of the troublesome
deep; for this proposition does note a term or place of Motion or Rest, in the
most opposite place to ^ight. Tim. 6. 16. 1 John 1. 5. 6, 7.
Light is in Heaven, as in its proper place, in which God does dwell; whereas
Psalm. 88. ^. Psalm. 213. 3. and 69. 2, 14,
these darknesses are in the lowest places, in the Abyss, in that nethermost
Pit in the Gulphs. Darkness was three Days before there was a Sun in the
Expanse, to go in, go down, or set, the Sun being created on the fourth Day,
and therefore it was not caused by the Suns absence. Exodus 10. 21, 23.
Darkness was one of Egypts plagues, which had not been so much, had it only
been a want and no infliction, it was Darkness felt, which was a sensible
thing. The Air was thick of it; the hand had sense of it. It was palpable:

It is a thing sent and made. It is a thing sometimes turned into its contrary.
It has an efficient Cause. Jehovah Aelohim gave it a Being: He puts it, he
makes it: he puts a Term or Bound unto it. He brings it into the Air as often
as he will. It has its Properties, as sudden arising, or diffusion, or
spreading abroad, it has obscurity; it does produce real effect. It is divided
into several kinds, thick, black. It is that, which is unfit for Communion with
its opposite Light. It is a thing destroyable. It is one of the miseries in
Hell. The Creator did divide between the Darkness and the Light, as the Expanse
did divide between the Waters and Waters. The Heavenly Lights were made thus to
divide between the Light and the Darkness. The Original Words which do set out
Darkness, do manifest its Being a created Thing. How glorious a Creature is the
Light, which is opposed to Darkness! Genesis 1. 3, 4, 5, 14, 15. Psalm. 104. 2. 1 Timothy 6. 16. Job 38. 19, 20, 24. Isai. 45. 7. 2 Cor. 4. 6. Genesis 1. 3. Job 38.
12, 24. and 36. 30, 32. Psalm. 74. 26. Rev. 21. 11, 23.
Light was one of the first Ornaments of the Created World, with which Aelohim
decked them as with a Garment. The Creator dwells in Light, and there the
Light dwells, though mortal man be little acquainted with the way of it.
Jehovah formed it. It is called his Light. It is he who prepares it. O how
admired and adored will Christ be, when he shall be visibly seen to be the
Light of the Heavenly City ^ The created Light is not a mere Accident, or
Quality without Substance, as Ethnic Philosophy has wronged it. It is an
Essentiated Substance; It has a distinct good perfect Subsistence: It has a
place of its own; It has Motion from one place to another, and this Motion is
in Time. It comes and it goes at its Seasons. It has not only a Local Motion,
but also its Rays and Beams, and Species do produce real Effects. The Sun is
not the cause of this Light; for, this Light was created three Days before the
Sun. They were distinct and different Creatures. The Light did actually Exist,
or had a reality of Being without and separate from the Sun, which Sun did not
then actually Exist, and therefore the Light must necessarily differ really
from the Sun. Otherwise the same created Being, the Sun, should actually both
Exist, and not Exist, or be and not be at one and the same time: Which includes
a contradiction, and implys an impossibility. There is such a thing in created
Nature, as pure Darkness, and pure Light. The one Essentiated as well as the
other, and they were, and are divided Locally as well as differenced Naturally;
these being distinct, divided separate Creatures. Isai. 5. 20. 2 Cor. 6. 14.
There is an Woe threatened against those who put the one to the other. Darkness
and Light do naturally in their successive courses succeed each other. There is
a Real as well as a Verbal distinction between them, and the Genesis 1. 2 -- 5. 2
Cor. 4. 6.
Darkness goes before the Light. They were not created, confused and permix'd.
They orderly differ in the Nature of the Things themselves, which had each of
them their proper Names, Time, Bounds, Places, and Courses, and their several
uses in the Creation. The Evening, the Darkness and the Night were called upon
to go together to make up Night, as the Morning, the Light and the Day were to
make up Day. But the Night was Genesis 1. 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31. and 8. 22. Jer.
21, 56. and 23. 20. 25.
an^^^ed out before the Light. For, so is the Computation of all and every of
the six foregoing Days of the first Week of the Creation expressly by an
established Law, and (...) Order, which shall never be altered or changed,
whilst this World does last. Thus the Darkness and the Light do make a proper
Daynatural. The Time when the Evening does begin, it that Time when the
Darkness does first begin. After the Sun was created, Mar. 1. 32. 1 King. 22.
35. pampared with 2 Chronicles. 18. 34.
it is set out by that Time, when the Sun goes in. From Evening unto Morning
is Exodus 27. 21. and 18. 13. Judge. 21. 2. 1 Samuel 30. 17.
the whole Night part, as opposed to the Day, as from Morning to Evening is the
whole Day part as opposed to the Night. The Psalm. 30. 5. Deuteronomy. 28. 67.

did end, when the next Evening did begin, which Evening was the beginning of
another distinct large Day, Evening and Morning 1. Chron. 23. 30.
are well fitted times for Meditation, for Prayer, for Praise, and for Singing.
The Creating Aelohim did lay the Foundation of the Evening, and of Morning
Worship on every Day of the Week. He takes special express notice of these two
Seasons, therefore there is a special Being granted unto these parts of Time;
Genesis 1. 5, 8, 13, 39, 23, 31.
And it shall exist the Evening, and it shall exist the Morning; so runs the
Creating Word. Psalm. 104. 22, 23, 24. 31.
AElohim looked on these Seasons with joy and with delight, with approbation
and with commendation, and so should we. The Evening has a true Being, a real
Existence, a natural Subsistence, it is a created Essence. The Evening does not
begin at the end of the ninth hour of the Day, or three hours before the going
in of the Sun: For, there was no part of a former Day before this one Evening
of the created World, when the evening and the morning made up the one Genesis 1.
5.
day. This Day here is so distinguished according to number, One, and not
according to order First, as yet; because hitherto there was no other Day. One
is the beginning of Number definitly, AEchad one, is that proper Name, which
the Creating Aelohim gave unto this Day, and it is peculiar to this Day, and
belongs only to this Day, in the measuring of the Days of a Week: It is a
wrong done to its Name, when it is taken from it, and given to any other Day of
the Week. Every one of their Names should be used, that they may be called
aright, and so may expressly answer to their names when they are called. How can
those Exodus 20. 8. 11. Deuteronomy. 5. 12 -- 15. Mat. 19. 8.
who miscal the one Day of the Week, the Seventh-day in the fourth Word or
Command answer this, seeing from the beginning it was not so? The Day on which
this World began to be Created, was properly one Day, no Number can in Time and
Nature go before an Unity, which therefore of necessity must be before any
other ordinal Number: There was not at that time any other Day that had actual
Existence. Those Days of this one Created Week, which did follow in the same
Week, were ordinal, and successive, and numerable, so that, there must be one
Day, which was the beginning of Days. Mat. 28. 1. Mar. 16. 2. Luke 24. 1. John
20. 1, 19. Act. 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 2.
It is injurious unto many Scriptures, when they translate one Numeral, the
first Ordinal, thereby to thrust and to force in if they could, the one Day of
the Week, into the room of the Seventh-day, as if the one Day were now the
Weekly-sabbath-day in the place of the Seventh, which mistake has Scripture
Reason and Nature against it, as may be shown in its proper place, in an
inquiry upon the Seventh-day. There was one Day which was the beginning of
Days, and therefore this World was in Time, not from Eternity; For, to speak
with propriety of Language, Eternity has no precedent duration. And this and
other distinct Days in this Week of the Creation, are properly a distinct
Enumeration of distinct Days, setting out their daily natural measures. And
therefore the express mentioning of them severally does show, that all things
were not Created in an instant at once, or in one day only, all of them
together. The Evening and the Morning of every Day were a distinct Day, and
were distinct parts of every Day. The one Day was before the second, and the
third Day was after the second, the fourth followed the third, and the fifth
was after the fourth, the sixth succeeded the fifth, and the seventh which is
the last Day of the Week, was the Holy Close of that Week. There is but one
Seventh-day in the Week. No other Day in this, or in any following Week, is
properly the Seventh-day of the Week, in the weekly revolution. These Days have
a priority, and a posterioty in time in their successive parts: and so were the
Creatures distinct Works, or distinct Days. They had a separate Creation on
separate Days, that we might with the more staidness and distinctness of
spirit, consider of, and meditate upon them in their created Order. If all had
been in one and the same moment of time, then how could it be affirmed of Adam,
that he was 1 Timothy 2. 13.
first formed, then Eve, which yet is expressly affirmed in the Words? The
created Number, and Order, and Names of Days must therefore be well observed,
D^^. 814, 26. Guerebboker, 2 Cor. 11. 25, (...), 1 King. 7. 9. Luke 22. 34.
upon which there are so many weighty Truths and great things that do depend.
An Evening-Morning, a Night-day is a large natural Day, according to the Law of
the first Creation, in which the Evening and the Morning were constituted one
Day. Act. 17 27, 33. (...) Exodus 12. 41, 42. with Numb. 33. 3. and and Deu^ 16.
6.
The Evening being the foregoing part of the Day, to which the after-Morning
does belong, both together making up a complete Day. So is the true account
through the whole Scriptures, where this is spoken of. The Evening of the Day,
Genesis 1. 5, 8, 13.
in the three first Days of the created World, began at the first coming of the
Darkness; afterward, when the Sun was created on the fourth Day, it was
further pointed out by the Genesis 1, 14 -- 19. Deuteronomy. 6.6. Mar. 1. 32. Prove. 7. 9.
going in of the Sun. The Morning of the Day in the three first Days of the
created World began when the Darkness went off, and Genesis 1, 5, 8, 13.
the Light came on, which afterward was fully completed Genesis 1. 14 -- 19.
Psalm. 104. 23. Mat. 16 2, 3. Exodus 18. 13, 14. and 27. 21. Act. 28. 23. Job 4.
20. Deu. 28. 67.
when the Sun did go forth. What has man to do thus daringly to change the
LORD's Time and Laws, and to pervert his well his wisely-established Decrees
and Appointments, which are some of his Jer. 31, 35, and 33. 20, 25.
Statutes and Ordinances, which he will have to remain unalterable, and by the
unchangeable constancy whereof he has confirmed the Covenant of Grace? There is
the time of a Day in a Day. There Exodus 5. 13. Lev. 23. 37. 1 Kin. 8. 59.
is a word of a Day in his Day. Judge. 19. 14, 15. Psalm. 104. 20, 22. 23.
The Night-part of a Natural large day, so far as concerns the present matter
in hand, is measured from the coming to the going of Darkness; from the going
in of the Sun, unto the going forth of the Sun. There are parts of the Night,

a third part of it: There is a beginning of the Night: There is the mid of the
Night: The LORD forsaw how bold rebellious man would be in prescribing times of
his own inventing and distributing unto himself to impose them upon others
also, and therefore he does often in the Scriptures set the just Limits and the
due bounds to set Times and Seasons; that man might receive a determination
from the Word. Psalm. 119. 148. and 130. 6. Lev. 3. 35. Psalm. 134. 1. Mat. 24.
43. Luke 28. Psalm. 90. 4. and 63. 6.
There were certain Watches of the Night, those Watches did point out a certain
space of Nightime, into which the Night was distributed. There was a Watch of
the Night which is called, the Job. 4. 13. Lam. 2. 19.

Night: and of that self same Night, of a Night of Observations. There is a
Morning Light before the Sun does go forth, so as visibly to be seen by our
eye. The Day part of a natural large Day, as to the present case, is measured

coming to the going away of the Light, or from the going forth of the Sun unto
the going in of the Sun. This Day is divided into John. 12. 19.
twelve hours, so also is the Night, into twelve equal parts; so that at
midnight, the sixth hour of the Night is ended, and seventh hour of the Night
does immediately after begin: And at Noon, or at Midday, the sixth hour of the
Day is fully ended, and the beginning of the next minute after this is the
beginning of the seventh hour of the Day, as opposed to the Night: and
according to this Division were Dials, and other Measures of Nights and Days
drawn and made, that were according to the Word. So that all the Winter the
hours of the Night were larger than those of the Day, and all the Summer the
hours of the Day were longer than the hours of the Night; and when it was
Equinoctial, then the hours of the Night and Day were equal; but at all other
times of the year different. Mag. 20, (...) Mar. 15. 25. Act. 2. 35. Mat. 20.

a minute or minute-time, or moment, we meet with in the Word, one minute, a
moment in a day one: a moment, a minute quickly gone, into a moment: like as a

little, or a final minute; moments, minutes of time: An indivisible point of
time; a minute or moment, is a very short space of time, a moment one: every
moment. That word which signifies a moment is derived from a root, which is, to
cut off on to break asunder, because, it is one of the least particles and
minute parts of time, broken off, as it were, the most minute-fragment of time.
These minutes and moments do fill up an hour, such a number of them. And this
kind of knowledge an ingenious enquirer does know now to make some good

seven days, as the Creator made them. There were seven distinct days severally
created, in order of time, and no more, which being ended, another week begins.
An whole full complete week, does consist of seven days; not of six or fewer
days, not of eight or more days, because Aelohim made all in these several
distinct days. He made no less, and he added no more. Dan. 10. 2. Ezekiel. 45. 25.

the Winter, it takes in that part of the year in which is plowing and sowing

season. To dwell, or sit, or inhabit an house of that Winter, to smite the
house of the Winter over or upon the house of the Summer: to be in the Harvest,

an hundred of Summer, or of Summer-fruits: There is a falling of the joyful
shout, or the rebounding Echo, upon the Summer and Harvest of the people of
God; There is a Summering of the flying Fowl, and of all Beast of this Earth
upon a people: so also a wintering upon them. To gather in Summer; to eat the
Summer or Summer Fruits: The collections or gatherings of Summer; to be in the
Summer and the Winter; to prepare the Summer Food, or Bread, or eatable: The
Summer was formed, and shall be formed by Aelohim: A Basket of Summer, or of
Summer-Fruit, it is come to the end (a pleasant allusion referring to that end
of the Year) The Waster does sometimes fall on our Summer: Snow in Summer is
not in season. The Fig Trees do bud forth their leaves, a little before Summer
(which does prove, that the Summer does include also, that which commonly is
called the Spring, and does then begin:) A wise Son will carry together in
Summer: There are Summer Flowers, when the Harvest is gathered in, and when the
Reapings are before the ingatherings. One design of this is to demonstrate from
the Word, that a Week in its successive returns, has a natural Existence, a
created Being, which does unchangeably establish the six foregoing Days of
every Week to be working Days, and the seventh, the last, the closing Day of
every Week to be the weekly Sabbath Day, or Day of Rest. As also, to discover,
that those who would undertake the Emendation of times, should order all
Chronology according to Scripture account. This Doctrine of Days and of Weeks,
does somewhat confirm the Seventh-day Sabbath, as the Seventh, to be of Natural
Obligation. Even the Adversaries themselves are so far convinced hereby; that
they confess diverse of them, that all the World are under a Divine Obligation
to spend one Day every Week in the Exercise of Religion; that the Hebdomadal
Revolution of Time is generally admitted, that it is Catholic, that all
Nations in all Ages have from time immemorial made the Revolution of seven
Days, to the first stated period of Time; that the measure of Time by a Night
and a Day is directed unto sense by the Diurnal Course of the Sun; that Lunar
Months of solar Years are of an unavoidable Observation unto all rational
Creatures: Whence therefore all men have reckoned Time by Days, Months and
Years, is obvious unto all, but whence the Hebdomadal Revolution, or weekly
period of Time should make its entrance, and obtain a Catholic admittance, no
man can give an account, but with respect to some impressions on the minds of
men, from the Constitution and Law of our Natures, with the Tradition of a
Sabbatical Rest instituted from the Foundation of the World. A Week is spoken
of as a known account of Days in Time. Thus they acknowledge: As also, that
those of the Philosophers, who resolved their Observations into things Natural
or Physical, do esteem the Septenary Number Sacred: A Septenary Revolution of
Days: unto which they found a respect in all their Notions and Speculations
about the Pleiades and Triones in Heaven, Lunar changes, sounds of Instruments,
variations in the age of Man, critical Days in bodily Distempers, and
transactions of Affairs private and public. I so far make use of this as to
show, that if such Authors would but improve their own convictions and
concessions, they might be spirited and sublimated into an asserting of
something of Honor, inseparable from the Natural Being of the Seventhday. The
order of which Day is not to be disturbed. Another of them acknowledges, that
there have been some difference and variation in the account of Years and
Months with people, yet never was the Week counted to be more or less than
seven Days with any people. In all Ages, among all Nations, the Seventh-day has
been venerable and sacred. I might put more of such Testimonies together, were
there need. But it is the Authority of holy Scripture, and of created Nature
that sways with me. It is observable in prophetical Scripture by Dan. 9. 24. 27.
Daniel, that the Weeks are there said to be cut off, as the words do properly
signify. The Verb of the singular Number, being put to a word of the plural
Number, does evidently show, that every one of the Weeks, from the first to the
last shall be precisely and absolutely complete: It was a precise cutting off,
The first Week of the created World was the fittest time for the giving forth
of the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, because the ground of the Institution of
this weekly Sabbath, was Aelohims manifesting by his Words and Works, that in
that same Week he perfected both the working Days, and the resting Day, he
rested upon the self same Seventh-day, when the memory of his great and
glorious Works was so new and fresh. So agreeable is this to created Nature in
the Exercise of right Reason, especially when enlightened by
Scripture-Revelation, within the compass of one and the ^ same Week, reckoning
still forward according to Created Order, it is impossible to find out any
proper Seventh-day, but only the last Day of the Week. This boundary of the
Week being unremoveable, and commanded to be kept Holy. And this Doctrine of
the Weeks is every where preserved in the several In Hebrew (...) Shebuang. i.
e. Hebdomada quod septem diebus Constant, a (...) i. e. septem; In English, a
sevennight is called a Week. In Belgic, or Low Dutch, it is Week. In
Teutonick or High Dutch, or the German Tongue, it is Woch, ab Weke. In the
Saxon Tongue, it is Ucan. In Spanish and Portuguez it is Semanc: In French, it
is Semaine, ou Sepmaine. In Iraliam, it is Settimana. In Latin, it is
Septimana, ae, a septem and mane, Hebdomada, seu Hebdomas, from the Greek in
which it is (...), septem quasi (...). In British or Welsh, it is Wythnos.
Languages, which have words for a Week.

Because it is that discovery which is of use, and is not every where to be met
withal by a common Reader, and it having some tendency toward the clearing up
of some subject matters in this Treatise, and toward the perfection of a
Reformation, which is also much of my design, let not the ingenuous Reader
think it too long a diversion, if I here detect somewhat of the idolatry and
superstition, which is still to this day continued in this Nation, and in other
Countries, by public and private retaining and using of the Heathenish names
of Days, as Sanday, Monday, etc. as also of Months, such as January, February,
etc. so that, he that shall speak in the present Age, according to Scripture,
though in his own and their Mother Tongue, yet is scarcely understood by the
most, and what is shameful and lamentable, by multitudes of a professing
Ministry and people. Whereas, has not Jehovah Aelohim strictly charged his
people, that Exodus 23. 12, 13. Hos. 2. 17. Zach. 13. 2. Numb. 32. 38. Josh. 23.
7. Psalm. 16. 4.
in all that, which he has said unto them, they shall be wary, and the name of
other gods they shall not mention; it shall not be heard out of their Mouth? O
take we heed unto our selves, that we do not transgress in this matter! Has he
not foretold, that he will take away the Names of Baalim out of the mouths of
his Servants? that he will cut off the names of the Idols out of the Land? Did
not God's Israel of Old, when and whilst their hearts were right with him,
practice accordingly, changing of the old idolatrous places, and putting new
names upon them? Did not zealous Joshuah take order about his? our LORD Jesus
Christ, after whom his Disciples must walk, would not take up the names of
after-Idol gods upon his lips.

Examine we now somewhat of the Original and occasion of the Pagan names of
Days and of Months. As for Days, the beginning Day of the Week, they call
Sunday. See Mirsheus guide into T^agues, and the word Day, and Scaliger de
Emend. temp. p. 46, 47. of his Psoleg.
The Germans, when they were Pagans, Verstegan says, consecrated the first Day
of the Week to the Sun, as Prince of Planets, whose Image they placed on a
Pillar in the Temple, fashioned like a man half naked, his face, as it were,
bright red with gleams of Fire; and holding with his Arms, bowing Archwise, a
burning wheel before his breast; the Wheel being to signify the course which
he runs round about the World, and the fiery gleams and brightness, the
light and heat wherewith he warmeth and comfort the things that live and
grow. The Sun was the chief God of the Persians. That Adoration, and religious
Worship, Deuteronomy. 4. 19. and 17. 3. Jer. 43. 13. Job 31. 26, 27. Ezekiel. 8. 16. 2
Ki^. 23. 5, 11. Jer. 7. 18. and 44. 17, 18, 19, 25.
which some gave to the Sun, is forbidden in the Scripture; condemned in the
Egyptians, in other Nations, and in the Jews themselves, the LORDs people, who
herein imitated the Heathen, worshipping with their faces turned toward the
East. The Heathens worshipped the Planets as Gods, and some will tell us, how
the Seven Planets do give denomination to the seven Days of the Week, and what
Planet reigns every hour in every Day; unto each of the seven Planets they
dedicated a Day, and called it by the name of that Planet, which had the first
hour of that Day, the Appellation from the Planets seems much ancienter than
that invention from the hours, which I shall after a few lines write of, so
that these names of the Days of the Week were not by the Pagans first imposed
from the Planetary hours, but rather the superstition of this appellation of
the Days was derived into the Hours. The names of the seven Planets, are these,
Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna, Jupiter, Mars^ which seven Planets these men would
have to govern twenty four hours in a Natural Day; the first Planet has the
first Hour, the second has the second, and so unto the seventh. Again, the
first Planet has the eighth Hour, the second the ninth, so unto the
fourteenth; afterward the first Planet has the fifteenth Hour, the second the
sixteenth, and so forth to one and twentieth; then yet again the first Planet
has the two and twentieth Hour, the second the twenty third, the third Planet
the twenty fourth Hour; and so the whole Natural Day of twenty four Hours is
finished and ended; the fourth Planet that follows shall have the first Hour
of the following Day, and so that Day shall take his name of that Planet: As
for Example, suppose this day were their Sunday:

Sol Venus. Mercury. Luna. Saturn. Jupiter. Mars S. V. M. L. Sat. 1. 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. J. M. S. V. M. L. S. J. M. S. V. M. 13. 14. 15. 16.
17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24.

Luna therefore follows, whence they call the second Day of the Week, Monday,
Monday, or rather Moon-day, as if it were Moons day; from this ancient Ethnic
Custom of ascribing all the Days of the Week to some Idol God, or Planet. See
Mirsheus guide into Tongues, and Vresteg. Page 10. and 69.
When the most Ancient Germans were Pagans, they appropriated the next Day unto
Sunday, to the special adoration of the Moon, who was the next Idol according
to the course of the Days of the Week, before mentioned. Hence in Teutonick,
High Dutch, or the German Tongue, it is called Der Montag, from Mon, the Moon,
and Tag, a Day; and in Belgic, or Low Dutch, Maendach, often Maendagh, from
Dagh, a Day, and Maene, the Moon: In French, Lundy, Lundi, jour Lunaire: In
Italian, Lunedi: In Spanish, El lunes: In Latin, Dies lunae; and in English
Monday.

The third Day is the Day of Mars, as it is named in diverse Languages, as in
Latin, in Spanish, in Italian, in French, in British or Welsh, and in Greek;
they make this Planet Mars, to be the God of battle and of strife, contention,
debate, controversy, whence the High Dutch and German Tongue now calls it,
Dinstag, and the Belgic or Low Dutch, Dijnsdagh, Diissen dagh, Drings dagh,
from Dring, contention or strife, and Dagh, a Day, because they dedicate this
Day of the Week to contention and strife. In English it is commonly called
Tuesday, of Tuisco, who, as they affirm was chief Leader and Ruler of the
German Nation, from the Tower of Babel, who in honor of him, after his death,
called this Day, Tuistag, that is Tuisco, his Day. And likewise after his name
they do in their own Tongue call themselves, Tuytcsh, and their Contry of
Germany, Tuyteshland; as also the Netherlands, using herein the D for the T, do
make it, Duytesh and Duytesh-landt: Hence in Latin, they are called Tuiscones,
and Teutones, and their Tongue, Lingua Teutonica, and all of Tuisco or Tuisto,
as Tacitus calls him: In English, it is commonly named Tuesday, having
retained the meaning of the German denomination.

The Fourth Day, they call the Day of Mercury, in Latin, in British or Welsh,
in Greek, and in other Languages, in English they name it Wedensday, or
Wensday: in Belgic or Low Dutch, Woensdagh, or Wodensdagh, or Godes-dagh; for
so they called Mercuries Day, as if it were Gods Day, Wodans or Godans Day, or
as Verstegan wills, that Woden was among the Ancient Germans and Saxous, a
most valiant and victorious Prince and Captain, and his Idol or Image was after
her death honored, praised and sacrificed unto, that by his aid and
furtherance, they might also obtain Victory over his Enemies, which when they
had obtained, they sacrificed such prisoners, as in that battle they had taken:
and from his Name this word, Woden, in their Tongue signifies, fierce,
furious: As in English, when one is in a rage, we sometims say he is Wood, or
he takes on as if he were Wood; so of this name Woden, whom after his death
they honored as a God, came this name Wednesday instead of Wodensday.

The fifth Day, they name the Day of Jupiter, or of Jove, in Latin, in British
or Welsh, in Greek and some other Languages, which Day they consecrated to
their God Jupiter or Jove, as that Planet which they supposed had dominion over
this day. See Mirshe^ on the words Day, and Verstegan in his Restit. of decayed
Inteligence in Antiquities, cap. ^
In English, it is commonly, bur corruptly called Thursday, of Thor, a name of
an Idol, which the ancient Germans did worship, and Day, a Day by them
dedicated to this Idol. In Belgic or Low Dutch, Donder-dagh, the Day of the
Thunderer, from Donder, Thunder, and Dagh, a Day, to which agrees the
Teutonick High Dutch, or German Tongue does agree, Donners tag, that is, the
Day of the Thunderer; for the Latins do call Jove the Thundering one. This Idol
Thor, wore on his head a Crown of Gold, and round about were set or fixed
twelve bright burnished golden Stars; for, they were persuaded, that being
displeased, he did cause Lightning and Thunder.

The sixth Day of the Week they called the Day of Venus, in French, Italian and
Spanish, from the Latin: In English, Friday, so in the Saxon Tongue, the High
and the Low Dutch, from Friga, an Idol of the Germans. This Idol represented
both Sexes, as well men as woman, and as an Hermaphrodite, but more of the
Female: She was reputed the giver of peace, and of plenty, as also the causer
and maker of Love and Amity, out of which it appears, that Friga was the
Goddess, which the Romans and other called Venus.

The Seventh day, is named by the Ethnicks, the Day of Saturn, so in Latin,
because they supposed, that the Planet Saturn did challenge to himself the
Dominion of this Day: So in English, Saturday, or Saturday, as if Saturns Day,
in Low Dutch, Sater dagh, from Seater, an Idol of the Germans, lean of Visage,
having long Hair, and a long Beard, and was bare headed and barefooted: In his
left hand he had a Wheel, and in his right he carried a Pail of Water, wherein
were Flowers and Fruits. In Low Dutch, this Seventh-day is called, Rust-dagh;
from Rust, Rest, and Dag, a Day, the Day of Rest. In English, French, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguez, Latin, Greek and Hebrew, it has its right Name, Sabbath,
the Day of holy Rest: and it would be one good means of reviving, and of
restoring the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, if it had its true name still given
it. And it is observable, that Exodus 23. 12, 13.
in one place of Scripture, where the LORD has expressly forbidden the
mentioning of the names of other Gods, there immediately before he does direct
and lead us to the proper name of this Day, the Seventh-day, and a Day of Rest,
a Sabbath Day: and so should the other foregoing six Days of the Week be called
by their own Scripture names. When a Reformation is throughed according to the
Word, amongst other Idolatries and superstitions, those of Ethnic Names of
Days, and of Months amongst others must and shall dawn.

This Heathenish Antichristian defilement, has also brought in polluted Names
amongst the Months.

The Romans appointed the beginning of the year to be the Calends of January,
Vide Martinii Lex Philolog. on the word Calendae.
because on the first Day of this Month, their Consuls were first created, when
that Government was set up amongst them; and from thence, from that time, it
was a solemn day for the New Years gifts, etc. then also they did sacrifice for
luck or for fortunes sake (as they Paganishly do phrase it) what they were to
do the whole year: and they were wont to send some sweets, as dry Figs, and the
like, as a good omen to one another: This Month is called from Janus, in Welsh,
High Dutch, French, Porteguez, Spanish, Italian, Latin, so also in English,
January; Prince Janus, they say had two Faces, which saw things past and to
come, or because superstitious Antiquity did consecrate to him the beginnings
of things.

February, the rest Month is named in English, in French, in Italian, in
Spanish, in Portuguez, in Latin; either from Frebruum, Februa, which were
Sacrifices or Ceremonies for purging of Souls, for in this Month they
sacrificed to Spirits, or to departed Souls, and they did celebrate the
Anniversaries or yearly Rites in remembrance of the Dead, which Sacrifices and
Ceremonies were done to infernal gods for them, which be dead, such as the
Dirges amongst the Papists; the Soul Masses, or Masses for the Dead: Or from
purged Juno, whose holy Day, as they called them, had solemn Sacrifices and
Plays dedicated to Pan their god, who kept, as they thought, the Wolves from
devouring the Sheep; on which day also women were purged by the Priests of Pan,
who on the Seventh day of their Sacrifices ran up and down the City naked, and
struck the Hands and Bellies of Women that were with child with a goats Skin,
hereby to signify both fruitfulness and easy delivery, or of Februus, the god
of purging by sacrifice, to whom Numa dedicated this month; or See Martinus
Lex. in ^ebraarius.
this Februus was Pluto the God of Hell and of Riches, to whom they sacrificed
in this month; which Month the Romans consecrated to the Infernal gods.

The month of March is so called, in British or Welsh, in high and low Dutch,
in French, Spanish, Portugueze, Italian, Latin, and English, from Mars, to whom
this month was dedicated, it being believed, that, he was the Father of
Romulus, the Author of the Roman Nation. The Planet Mars was held to be the God
of battle.

The month April, has its name in British or Welsh, in high and low Dutch, in
French, Spanish, Portugueze, Italian, Latin and English, from (...) Spum^^ and
(...), Venus, ex qua spuma maris orta creditnr Ve^us.
a Greek word which does set out Venus the Goddess of Love, as sprung from the
foam and froth of the Sea: This month was dedicated to her.

The month of May borrows it is denomination, in low Dutch, in high Dutch, in
Welsh, in Italian, in Spanish, in Portugueze, in French, in Latin, in English,
from Maia, the Mother of Mercury, in this Month they sacrificed to Maia and to
Mercury, those did so who were Merchants.

The month of June is so called, in French, Portugueze, Italian, Spanish,
Latin, and English, from Juno, an Heathenish goddess, the daughter of Saturn
and Ops, the Sister and Wife of Jupiter, or of Junius Brutus the Author of
Romes liberty, and made Consul in this month.

The month of Julia has its name in French, in Italian, in Portugueze, in
Spanish, in Latin, in English, from Julius Caesar, because he was born in that
month.

The month of August has its denomination, in British, in French, in Spanish,
in Portugueze, in Italian, in Latin, in English, from Augustus Caesar, and for
his Honor.

The Rest of the Months are reckoned by their Number from March inclusively,
September the Seventh Month from March, October the eighth Month, November the
ninth Month, December the tenth Month.

Having thus given the Reader some account of the Ethnic names of Days, and of
Months; How can I but bewail that carnal compliance which the most of
Christians are guilty of with Heathenish corruptions, in this as in many
things! Why is there such a backwardness, especially in those who call
themselves of the Reformed Religion, to bring names and things to Scripture
Language and expressions? O how much would it make, both for the Peace and
Purity of Churches, and people of Christ, to bring all in this as well as in
other Cases and Matters, to that Word-will of our God, by which we must be all
judged in that last great Day!

The true proper names of the Genesis 1. 5, 8. 13, 19, 23, 31. and 2, 2, 3.
Days of the Week according to Scripture are One (or the First when another Day
of the same Week is in being) the Second, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the
Sixth, the Seventh.

The several Chron. 27. 1 -- 15.
Moons or Months in the Year, according to Scripture are thus named:

Exodus 12. 2. 1 Chronicles. 27. 2. Genesis 8. 13. Esther ^. 12. Ezekiel. 40. 1. Exodus 13.

1 Chronicles. 27. 14.
The Eleventh.

1 Chronicles. 27. 15. Esther 3. 13. and 8. 12. 1 Jer. 52.

Some of those Months have also some other names in some Scriptures, but these
are they which are of constant use, O who will give, that the Time were to
come, when Christ and his Saints shall be there together, where there will be a
pure River of the Water of Life, clear as Crystal, proceeding out of the Throne
of God, and of the Lamb; in the midst of the Street whereof, and of either side
of which River, the Tree of Life will be, which will have twelve manner of
Fruits, and yield her Fruit Rev. 22. 1. 2, Ezekiel. 47. 12.
every Month, the Leaves of which Tree will be for the healing of the Nations!

Pass we now unto an enquiry concerning the created Work of Genesis 1. 6 -- 10.
the Second Day.
Q. Whether all those upper Waters (such as Rain, Dew, Hail, Snow, and the
like,) between which and the lower Waters (comprehended under the name of Seas,
such as Springs, Fountains, Rivers, Lakes, and the like,) the firm Out-spread
or Expanded does separatingly divide, do come down from above this Expanse, Or
are they caused in the Air by some influencing operativeness of the Heavenly
Luminaries upon the moistness and wateriness here below, drawing up such
vapors from hence as do condense in the cold middle Region of the Air, and are
there turned into those distilling Drops which come down here below? Whether
the Air be the proper place where the upper Waters are generated?

HUmane Sophists will resolve this Question, thus: Rain is the moisture of the
Earth and of the Seas, of Watery places, drawn up by the heat of the Sun into
the middle Region of the Air, which being thus condensed into Clouds, is
afterward at the will of God dissolved and dropped down again in showers for his
glory in making the Earth fruitful, for good to the good, for the instruction
of all men, and for relief to other creatures. As to that part which is the
generating cause, Natural Philosophers do call the Sun the Father of the Rain,
and a late Christian Philosopher does own it, as not improperly so called in
his Exposition on Joh. The Water of the Sea, and the moisture of the Earth, say
they, being attenuated by the heat of the beams of the Sun, do become vapors,
which being so rarefied and resolved into an aerie substance are by the same
heat of the Sun drawn up into a cold middle loft of the Air, where being again
thickened into Water they melt down into Rain. Thus they describe the manner of
the Formation and Generation of Rain. And it is a common heathenish expression
amongst many who name the name of Christ, we shall have Rain when the Moon
changes, or when the Wind turns. Thus do these therefore greatly err Mat.
22. 29. Mar 12. 24. 27.
because, they know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

A. There is no ground in Scripture, nor in Nature, to affirm three Regions of
the Air, lower, middle and higher, as vain Philosophers do in their Physics:
as if then, immediately above that, were the Region of Fire, next under the Orb
of the Moon. Such a partition of the Air into three several Regions I find not,
either in the original Text, or in created beings: As also neither is there
such an enumeration in the word or works of Christ, as ten celestial Spheres
or Heavens, The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Starry Heaven, the Christalin
Heaven, the first Mover. It is an humane Figment this. The Scriptures do inform
us of 1 Cor. 12. 2.
a third, which is the highest Heaven, and in this discovery must we acquiesce.

Jehovah Aelohim has builded Amos 9. 6. Ps. 104. 3.
his stories, and has planted his lofts in the Waters. But those Waters are
such as are above all these visible Heavens, above this blew Expanse over our
Heads, which our eyes do sometimes behold: and the place of these upper Waters
is Jer. 47. 2. Pro. 25. 23.
over the North part of the Heavens. This visible expanded is Genesis 1. 6, 7.
Diacritical or Distinctive between the upper and lower Waters. This extent or
well compacted firm out-spread was made much for this end dividingly to
separate between these two Waters, so as that they might not be joined together
in one. It was, and is an intermediate orderly disposed distinction between
them, between somewhat that was above, and somewhat that was below, which
therefore also is not the very highest and utmost boundary of the created
World, as diverse of the Ethnic Sophists asserted, who would have it their
Super-AEther, or Coelum Daemoniacum, where they did place the chiefest of their
Idols which were the Planets and Stars thereof, because they seemed to them to
be the highest and greatest, and most glorious of all visible created beings;
Whereas it is but a middle partition. From James 5. 18. Ps. 148. 4. Acts 14.
17. Deuteronomy. 28. 24. Hos. 2. 21. Lev. 26. 19. Deuteronomy. 28. 23. 1 Kings 8. 35. 2 Chr.

12. Job 38. 22. Genesis 28. 17. Job 38. 37. and 26. 8, 9. and 36. 26. and in many
other places which I have elsewhere put together.
above this does the Rain come; The higher Heaven does give it down, it does
descend from hence. A Call must be given to the Heaven above to give down Rain,
to Aelohim there; He sometimes makes the higher Heaven as Iron and Brass: He
shu^s the Heaven when he does hold back the Rain: It is he that does open or
shut the Cataracts of Heaven: There are Aelohim's upper Chambers. There are the
inner retiring Rooms: His lofts are planchered in those upper Waters: There are
the Waters bound. There is Aelohim's Tabernacle extended. These Waters are some
of his Treasures, which he opens when he gives down rain. There are the
Treasures of Snow and of Hail; Man on earth cannot reach them with his eye.
There is a Gate of the Heavens; there are bottles of Heaven; above this
expanded is the Throne of Aelohim. Hence is the Water distilled; It is from the
ordination and command of Aelohim, that, this is. So that all the watery clouds
and bottles do come down first from above the Azure Expanse. So that, Rain is
water distilled from the Waters above the extended. What I have here written
about Rain, Job ^. 30. Psalm. 147. 18. and 148. 4, 5, 8. Ps. 105. 32. Job 38.
22, 28. and 37. 10, 11. Rev. 6. 21. Genesis 27. 28, 39. Judge. 6. 38. Isa. 45. 8.
is also applicable to Snow, Hail, Dew, and such like, under the general
comprehensive name of Waters. It is Jehovah Aelohim who is Amo^ 4. 7, 8. Jer.
14. 22. Job 38. 25. Jer. 5. 24.
the causer of the Rain: None can cause it but himself; not the vanities of the
Heathens, none of the Ethnic Idols, not Sun, or Moon, or Stars, neither can the
Heavens of themselves give showers. Who, but he can cause it? It is an
immediate gift from him. Why has not Deuteronomy. 11. 8, 10, 11, 12. Zach. 14. 17, 18.
Egypt rain ordinarily, if there were such natural causes of it, as men
pretend? Rain comes down from the Heaven, Isa. 55. 9, 10, 11.
but, it does not return thither; It is spoken of the higher, not of the lower
Heaven. If the Sun did draw it up again, then it would return thither again
Which Jehovah himself does expressly deny: It so comes, as the word comes
originally out of his mouth Heb. 12. 25, 26.
who speaks from out of Heaven. It is the Rain Ps. 68. 8, 9.
of Heaven; The Heavens drop it down, when it does water the earth, Ps. 65. 9,
10.
It is a visit from Jehovah Aelohim: and how sweet would that meditation be,
were it spiritually improved! Did we so receive it as a token of his special
love, when it is sent in mercy to us, and not in a way of Judgment! The new
creature might be much aedified by the old creation. Rainwater is not
River-water, neither is it Seawater; It has differing properties, different
causalities, and different effects. It comes not originally from these here
below, but from the River of God above. It comes Joel 2. 23, 28. Ezekiel. 47. 1 --
12.
from his Throne; and what a raised contemplation is that to an experienced
Believer, that has free converse with Christ in the Spirit! It comes in his
errand, with a message from him; It is he that Mat. 5. 45.
sends it. Jehovah Christ will come down Ps. 72. 6. Hos. 6. 3.
as Rain, that is, from out of Heaven. Ps. 104. 3.
The Chambers of these Waters are above, whence showers cannot be given down,
Jer. 14. 21.
till the LORD open the Heavens. Genesis 7. 11. and 8. 2
The Floodgates of Heaven are opened when Rain comes down, though sometimes
these are opened more, as they were in Noah's days: and as they are when they
are longer and greater Ezekiel. 13. 13. Zech. 10. 1.
showrings in a vindictive or chastising way. Although ordinarily it do distill
in drops (which is a wise careful good providence to quench the thirst of every
herb and grass) yet some Seamen who do take long Voyages, do speak, that there
are seasons, when they meet with spouts of water which do much endanger great
Ships. Job 37. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
The small and the great Rain, are both of them Jehovah's strength: He puts
forth his Almighty power in this creature: His own arm is here made bare. This
is one of those mavelous things he does, which we cannot so fully comprehend:
If any carping Reader be secretly framing an exception or objection against
this discovery from one or two mis-understood Scriptures in our English
Translation; he should consider, that there is a sweet harmony, and good
agreement in the whole Scripture; thou must so interpret one Scripture, as
that, it may not clash with the rest: what does seem obscure in one or two
places, must receive light from the many others which are clear: upon a deep
research into this matter, I find a pleasant concord. And therefore this
question has been propounded not to minister occasion to any quarelsome
objector, or angry contender, or wrangling opposer, (For, men of such Spirits,
and Frames are not promoters of useful Sciences, nor advancers of profitable
learning): but to put such as are of humble inquiring Spirits upon further

above the Heavens, by those Heavens and Waters are not meant the Air and the
Clouds; For there is Air above these Clouds. Did we more and better consider
the place whence the Rain does come and the efficient cause of it, who it is
that does make it and send it, we should find the matter profitable, for our
serious thoughts to be working upon: The coming down of Rain from above this
visible Expanse to us would be a call, an help and means to fetch us up
thither, Deuteronomy. 28. 24. Ps 72. 6. Isa. 55. 10 Ezekiel. 34. 26. Mat 7. 25, 27. Genesis

whence this did descend hither and fall down toward us. So that, it is not by
the position of Luminaries, that this Rain is drawn up: They are the LORD's
hidden Deuteronomy. 28. 12. Job 38. 22.
Treasuries which have this blessing issuing forth from them when they are sent
in a gracious Covenant way, then are they a blessing. Those Treasuries are
above this Expanse in some inner place and hidden Repository; Such as cannot be

all is open between us and the Expanse, and the eye can reach as far as the
extended Firmament. Ps. 68. 9. Job 37. 6. and 38. 25, 26, 28. Job. 28. 25.
It is the Almighty, who shakes out a Rain of liberalities; He sheds and
sprinkles it abroad, as with the waving of the hand: He divides the spouts for
it: He does appoint it its bounds, that it shall not cover the Earth; He has
these Waters in his hand, they obey him. He, that is delighted with this kind
of study, may quickly be directed how to fill up a large Tractat upon this
Subject Matter of the upper Waters out of the Scriptures, concerning Rain; the
Rainbow, Dew, Hail, Snow, and what else that is watery, which comes down from
above: and how much is there of hidden secrets in these created beings, in
their natural essences, causalities, and productions, which are practically
useful.

One distinct work of the Genesis 1. 11, 12, 13.
third Day, with its peculiar blessing was that of Herbs. The Inquiry,
therefore here shall be this,
Q. Whether the exact est fullest Herbal, of Herbs, Grass, Trees and Plants, be
not treasured up in the Scriptures of Truth, opening this great Secret of
Created Nature, best setting out the doctrine and use of them, both for Feeding
and for Healing?

Answ. It is.

FRom the Herbal fruitfulness of this Earth Psalm. 104. 14, 15, 16.
may be drawn many a sweet Argument of Jehovahs praise. Aelohim is the prime
efficient Cause, producing of Herbs. Genesis 1. 11, 12.
They were not until he spoke them into a Being, he made them by his Word, by
his own immediate Power without second and ordinary Causes. The Sun, Moon, and
Stars were not created till the next Day after, and therefore no influence of
the Heavenly Luminaries could be the parent of their first Production. As those
who make Saturnum in Latio, Triptolemum in Greciae, Cererem in Attica, Isidem
in Sicilia, autorem Se^et^s.
To assert created Authors of Herbs, is an Heathenish Fable. The green Herbs
had their Virtues in perfection at their first Creation, and were not According
to Astrostrolgers: Plantae sunt Saturnin^. quercus, Platanus, etc. Joviales,
laurus, crocus, etc. Martiales, piper, Zinzibe; Solares, Olivae, cerasi,
rosmarini, palmae; Mercuriales, petroselinum, avellanae: Lunares, cucurbitae,
cucumeres.
Astrologically distributed according to that pretended Dominion, which some do
over credulously fancy, that the Heavenly Luminaries do exercise over them,
whereby much of the Ethnic Idolatry and superstition has slily crept in, and
is still infinuating of it self into the minds of many. After the first
Creation-Herbs, the LORD did put a Virtue into Deuteronomy. 11. 15. Psalm. 104. 24. and

second and ordinary Causes under him to forward those choice Virtues which he
put into Herbs, which Herbs do still retain: This Earth from the blessing of
God is said to bring forth Herb accommodate to them, by whom it is dressed. The

Sun by its light and heat does communicate some vital warmth, in the Virtue
whereof the Seed of Herbs is cherished and prepared for Generation, till the
Herb be thence brought forth. The Moon also has its usefulness this way, by its
cooling moistening to protrude, thrust forth, or eject them. The Waters, Rainy
and dewy have also some refreshing, nourishing efficacy this way. These fellow
Creatures are pleasant and healthful unto Herbs; Mic. 5. 7. Hag. 1. 10. 1 King.

so that sometimes the Dew is put for the Herb, which with the Dew from Heaven
is moistened and cherished, and made to vegetate and grow. The want whereof
does leave the Earth to be barren. But Deuteronomy. 29. 2^. Genesis 1. 11, 12. 2 Samuel 23.
4. Psalm. 104. 14. Hag. 1. 11. Heb. 6. 7.
the Earth, when thus well watered, is friendly to the Herb by its native heat,
cherishing the Seed, until the Herb be born and brought forth, and when it is
brought forth, the Earth by its moisture does nourish and nurse, cheer and
conserve it. Genesis 2. 5.
The labor of man by Culture and and dressing has also a special
serviceableness for this end. Genesis 1. 29. Exodus 10. 12, 15: Job 5 25. Psalm. 72.

The place in which the Herbs do come forth and grow is the superfice of this
Earth, and of the Field; and hence it is, that an Herb is called an Herb of the
Earth, the Herb of the Field, of the Fieids, the Herb of the Mountains. Were
all the Scriptures in the Margin, with diverse others that might help to bring
in an answer to this inquiry, well studied in the large significancy of the
Original Words and Phrases, relating to the knowledge of Herbs; O how much
light would it bring in for the advance and augment of the Alimental and
Medicinal Arts! Herbs are the Fruit and the Revenue of the Earth. It is called
our Revenue or Fruit, speaking of those who are in Covenant with Jehovah
Aelohim. But how little of this is as yet enjoyed in a Scripture way, because
this wonderful secret in created Nature is so little dug after in the
Word-Mine, which alone does fully discover it? Whilst it makes for the gainful
purpose of some to hold vulgar capacities in ignorance, that themselves might
be admired and resorted to; whereas were we well skilled in that Scriptural
Herbal, which the LORD Christ has given us, the poorest only for a little
pains in gathering by a discrete choice and meet application, might have that
wholesome food and that recovering Medicine, which the richer sort with all
their large fees, and discharged long Bills are never likely to attain unto.
Those Scriptures would teach us much of the Natural Virtue and efficacy of
Herbs; Job 8. 11. Isai. 15.
some whereof are of a Marshy kind, such as do grow in miry wet and softened
places. The Herbage does spring up and sprout that is near the Waters; a well
moystened soy^ does make it green and flourishing. He that has made all other
things for himself, had also glorious ends in his eye, in his third Days Work:
For the LORD did create and bring forth the Herb for his own Honor, and Psalm.

for the service, use and good of man. It is serviceable to man for many
purposes, Mat. 6. 30.

It is helpful for men's eyesight by the greenness of it, which is refreshing
and strengthening to the Eye, and cheering to his Spirit by its virid
freshness. How useful is the green Grass to other Creatures, whereby they also
are serviceable to man! 1 Cor. 8. 12. Prove. 27. 25.
When it is dried it becomes Hay, this also is Food to Beasts and Cattle. Genesis
1. 29, 30. and 3. 18.
Herbs were given unto men to feed upon, the green Herbs which was bestowed for
this end, both before and after the Fall of Adam. Man had the Herbs of Paradise
before, and the Herbs of the Field. Genesis 9. 3. Dan. 4. 25, 32. and 5. 21.
Thus it was also after the Flood. Nebuchadnezzar was sent a grasing for a
remedy; and it might not be altogether unworthy of a learned Physicians
inquiry, whether if there were a discrete choice of Specifick-Herbs for the
cure of that Distemper it would not prove one of the most proper Medicinal
Foods for such as are overgrown with bestial Melancholy, or deprived of Humane
Rationality, as to the use and exercise of it for the present? The
Wise-Kitchen-Herbalist is one of the most successful Doctors and Practisers of
Physic. Exodus 9. 25, 26. and 10. 5, 12, 15. Psalm. 105. 35. Jer. 12. 4. Isai.

It is a sore Judgment when the LORD for sins does send either such Hail as
spoileth the Herb, or the Locusts, Palmer worm, or other hurtful Creatures to
consume the Herb. Or when the Herb does wither, or does fail, (this is a sign
of the barrenness of such an Earth.) As in a time of great drought it uses to
do. Thus also when the Earth does not bring forth tender Herb, when the Mildew
(which has the name in Hebrew of paleness) is a plague upon the Corn, and
other tender Plants and Herbs through too much moistness, (as blasting is with
dryness.) whereby the natural greenness is gone before it be ripe, and the
color is faded, when that which was given to be food for Man, Beast and
Cattle, is corrupted. Prove. 27. 2^. Joel 2. 22. Psalm. 23. 2. Heb. 6, 7. Deuteronomy.
11. 15. Zach. 10. 1.
It is a great benefit from Jehovah, when there are Herbs in the Mountains,
when the Pasture fields, and the Habitacles of the Desert are stored with
Herbs, this is a singular favor of God toward his people; it is a blessing
when there is a budding Grass in the Fields, pleasant Pastures and Leas, where
green and tender Herbs do spring: When this Earth does bring forth Herb
commodious for the Tiller of the Field: and so when God does give the Herb.
Ezekiel. 47. 12. Rev. 22, 2.
The Leaves of some Trees are for healing, or for stamping or beating, as we
use to stamp or beat Leaves or Herbs small to use them in Medicinal Drinks or
Plasters. Genesis 1. 30. and 9. 3. Job 40. 1^. Job ^ 5. Psalm. 106. 20. Dan. 4.

Herbs are also given unto the bruit Beasts for Aliment and Food, for Physic
and Medicine, before the Fall, and also useet the Fall. The Herb is the Aliment
of the Elephant, and of Beasts, and of Cattle, of the Ass, of the Ox, of the
Heifer, or Cow. Green Bows of Trees have their use also for this. And hereby
these living Creatures do become the more serviceable to man. Mat. 6. 28. Luke

The Herb quickly withers and soon dries, especially the Herb that is struck
or smitten with the scorching of the Sun; then its Flower Falls, and its beauty
perishes. The Moorish Fenny Herb, the Reed or Sea-grass, grows not without
Water, and is soon withered in dry places. God takes Mat. 6. 30. Luke 12. 28.
care of the Herb, though to day it be, and to morrow it be cast into the Oven.
There are different divided sorts of Herbs; Cen. 1. 11, 12. 29.
both in respect of the efficient cause: For some are swon and come from
Culture, and others are unsown, voluntary and growing without the use of such
Art, naturally spinging up without any skill of man laid out about them: The
sown Herbs are expressed by such as are seeding of Seed, the other is the
Fruit-tree yielding Fruit, whose seed is in it, both are budding grass: And
also in respect of their Native place: For there are Herbs of the Field, Herbs
of the Mountains, Herbs of the Moors or Fens: Also in respect of growth and of
age: Deuteronomy 32. 2.
Some Herbs are younger and tenderer; others are more grown and ripe: Job 38.
26, 27. Isai. 55. 10. 11.
the distilling shower does make them fruitful: also in respect of their
quality; for Exodus 12. 8. Numb. 9. 11. Job. 30. 4.
some Herbs are bitter, (with which the Paschal Lamb was to be eaten.) Others
are satish Herbs. There are Pot Herbs; all kinds of such. 2 King. 4. 39. Luke
13. 19. Genesis 2. 16, 17. and 3 2, 3. Jer. 29. 5. 28. Amos 9. 14.

who are weak. Dan. 1. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
Daniel chose this kind of Diet, and preferred it before lushious dainties of

It was Solomon's Wisdom that he excelled in this Science. He treated of Plants
from the Cedar to the Hysop, or Rosemary rather: and most men's concluding upon
the loss of that Book, does feed a gross mistake, as if now this Art were not
to be searched after in the Word of Truth: Whereas, there is more of this in
Solomon's Writings came to our hands, than passes under through exact
Observation; but in taking in the rest of the Scriptures concerning this, there
might be found an admirable fullness on this subject matter. Yob 14. 9.

The use of Hay is to be Aliment to bruit Animals, to Horses, to Oxen, which
feed sometimes on the Herb, sometimes on Straw, and for want of these they

Hay is a small light thing: It is that which does quickly wither, and is soon
cut down. Amos 7. 1.
There is a season for its Mowing: There is a second growth after the first
cutting down. There is a time for the gathering of Herbs, and a way of drying
them for use. I was entering upon the Doctrine of Trees, and of their Fruit as
described in the Word: But, it is so large, that a distinct Treatise might
profitably be published to the World from the Scripture about it. I point out
the Word-way for others to travel further on in, whose profession does lead
them more on in this path. Only let me add somewhat more about Herbs. The
Scriptures do mention Prove. 27. 25.
, a time of gathering Herbs, especially the Herbs of the Mountains, when the
Herb is revealed, and the Grass-plant appears, they are fittest food for man,
(those of them that were appointed for food.) When they first spring forth, and
are well and full sprung up, to be fit for that end. And it should be inquired,
whether then also they are not in their prime for medicinal use, when the Herbs
thrust forth in their verdure, strength, fullness and choiceness of Juice. I
pretend not to any deep insight into this part of the Medicinal Art, but do put
upon the inquisition, whether that part of the Spring time, when Sheep use to
be shorn, (which is mentioned in the Prove. 27. 26, 27.
Verse immediately following, that which you have in the Margin-above.) Then
when men use to sell off their Goats, when Bread is put into Goats Milk, and is
eaten; the young Kids of the Goats being weaned, when there are blastings by
Lightnings, or by Genesis 41. 23. Hos. 13. 15.

Many Herbs are not eaten, but whilst they are green and moist, then are they
proper and good for Food. When Herbs wax pal^, wan and withered, much of their
Virtue is lost, as to some purposes, their greenness and moistness being gone.

There is a word in Chaldet, from the same (...) which doth-signifie paleness,
arising from sudden fear or terror, as does make the face pale and livid, the
blood going off from that part, and leaving a yellow color behind. Thus herbs
are sometimes yellow, either through overmuch moisture, and so losing their
verdure do degenerate into paleness, and cannot so ripen, or when they are
struck with over drought or with rust. From the same Root there is Jarken.
a word in Arabic, and it is used by some Hebrew Rabbis, which does signify
the yellow Jaundies, and the Dropsy, when the Gall does diffuse it self into

the curing of these Distempers, I leave Physicians further to enquire. Prove.

but discern a large Field, and a choice Garden of Scripture-Herbal, of which I

Trees, such as Rosemary, Juniper, Willow, the Lentisk, or Mastick Tree, the
Fig Tree and its fruit, the Mulberry-Tree, the Palm Tree and its Dates, the
Ebb^-Tree, the Turpentine-Tree, with what flows from it, the Olive Tree and its
Oil, The Vine, and its clusters, Grapes and Wine, The Tamarisk, with its leaves

Camplise, with their Clusters and fruits, that Tree whose bark, is Aromatical
Cinnamon, with all such Trees of sweet Spices, the Trees of Frankincense, the
Aloe-Tree (as well as the Aloe-herb,) the Almond-Tree with its Almonds, the
Oak, the Elm, and other great Trees, the Cedar, the Plane-Tree: and what shall
I more say? my expectations are growing and cherished, that, those, who by
their Medicinal profession, are more concerned herein. And are someways more
conversant about the lives of Men, in their prescriptions both for Physic and
Food, will in time have their Spirits better reconciled to Scripture Arts and
Sciences, to make this Book of Books more their study, and the foundation of
their practice.

It is mavelous kindness which the Almighty Creator has manifested in the
variety of colors, sweetness of odor, greatness of efficacy, that is found in
Plants. The most learned Doctors and most experienced practitioners in the
Medicinal Art, may go to School unto meaner creatures to be better skilled in
the usefulness of Herbs and Plants. Some natural Historiaus do treat much of
this; Hoc in Confesso est, Sagirtas quibus confixi sunt, dictamno Cervos
extrahere; Hirundines vex^tis pullorum oculis Chelidonia mederi, lapide tamen
an herba dubitant. Testudinem cunila vires contra serpentem restaurare:
Mustelam adversus mures rut^ muniri, ut and contra serpents. Origanum
ciconiae, apris hedera, marathrum anguium oculis medetur; succo lactucae
Sylvestris nauseam vernam draco restinguit: Elephas post devoratum chameleonem
ex ^lcastro sibi medicinam parat; venenis herba cinera cervos resistit;
palumbus, graculus, merula, perdices, lauri folio se purgant; columbae,
turtures ^elxine; anates and anseres siderite, grues junco palustri: maculas
faciei illae potissimum herbae ^bsterg^nt, quae maculis and ips^e sunt
resperse, ut Arum. Persicaria, and Ranunculus; Squamas vero dejiciunt morsus
diaboli, alias succisa, scabio^a, and Chamaeleon, utpote squamosae; vulnera
sanant omnia perforatae, ut hypericon, and Cruciata; quae consolidant, ut
viscus, consolidae omnes and aquifolium: quartanae febri suc^^rrunt quadrati,
tertiane vero trilateri caules; ealeulos frangunt lapidea femina, lithosperma
and la^hryma Jobea; To^sillas and Haemorrhoidas tuberculosae capitulis
papillosis, ut arum minus and Sch^ophularia mulcent.
Thus there is a Figuring likeness in many Herbs and Plants to the Inner and
Outer parts of Man: Their Alwise Former has put this resembling Character upon
several of them for the good of Man, This is a great Arcan of Nature.

This Herbal-Art and Plant-Science is not unbecoming a Minister and Messenger
of Christ to be well versed in: and if Physicians, Chyrurgeons, Apothecaries,
Anatomists, would thus exercise their gifts, they might expect both assistance
and acceptance, from and with the LORD, when what they do in order to the
health of their Patients, they do all in obedience and in Faith, in a
Scripture-method and way, his blessing would be more upon their labors, Ps.
107. 20.
when he sends his word and heals the sick. Natural causes producing natural
effects are Deuteronomy. 32. 1, 2.
natural Preachers. Grass and Herbs are green growing flourishing Witnesses for
the Creator, Preserver, and Redeemer, against the Atheistical unbelieving
unthankful World, declaring his bounty and goodness, his wisdom and love, his
mercy and pity, which shines forth in the cheerful looks of Herbs and Grass,
after that he has given sweet showers of Rain; Job 38. 27.
even the desolate wilderness and the wast grounds will then bud and blossom
and bring forth fruit. Tongueless Creatures yet have a way of teaching and
speaking many profitable Instructions and useful Lessons; Job 8. 12.
Natural Herbs are shadows of spiritual Truths, and things; the leaves of
Herbs, of Plants, and Grass, in the book of Nature have many precious Doctrines
and uses contained in them, and expressed by them to those that can read and
understand their Language in their impressed green Letters of their created
Being. If you ask the question, what a sincere Believer is? Ps. 1. 3.
Go to the Tree planted by the Rivers of Waters, that brings forth his fruit
in his season, and that will give thee an Answer. Want thou a resolution in
this case, what is an Hypocrite? Job 8. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
Go to the Rush and Flagg, and that will inform thee. Genesis 1.
God's Words and his Works in the first Creation went together, he spoke and
did his mind at once. Eccles. 1. 1. 1 King. 4. 29 -- 34. and 3. 5 -- 12.
wise Solomon, an able Preacher as well as a skilful Herbalist, is thought to
apply his three thousand parables, Proverbs or Similitudes, unto those Trees or
Plants about which he did discourse, drawing some Theological Doctrine and use
from every Plant, whose created Nature his renewing grace did improve. The
health of man's body and mind would be much promoted by the improvement of
Scripture-Religion, of experimental Christianity, were this more lived over in
a way of natural as well as spiritual causality. Sin which is the contrary is
denounced against Genesis 2. 17. Exo. 10. 17. Romans 5. 12.
there, as the cause of Diseases, Sicknesses, Disobedience is threatened with
death: Romans 6. 23. Rev. 2. 7. Genesis 2. 16, 17. and 3. 2^ Deuteronomy. 28. (...).
Whereas the promise of Life is made to the believing and obedient. The Tree of
Life's was a sign of this. Scripture-Religion does teach a moderate, tempera^^
use of the good creatures of God, which tends much to health: And it does take
off from gratifying of an inordinate appetite, which would prevent many
distempers. It does teach Tim. 4. 3, 4, 5, 8.
a sanctified used of good Creatures: It sets the partaker of them right in his
Principles, Rules and Ends, which puts a comfortableness into the use of
Creatures. This would cheer the spirits, and help digestion: Exodus 23. 25.
It would engage the Power and the Truth of Jehovah, to put forth his
strengthening, healing, blessing in Meals. This would wise and direct a
Believer in the choice, that he should make in the kinds of Meats, in the
quanty and proportions of Meats, in the qualities of Meats, in the daily
numbers and seasons of Meals, to the time and use of fasting; all these suited
to his particular constitution. This would make him observe in experience, what
food is hurtful, and what is healthful for him. Tit. 1. 13. and 2. 1. 1 Timothy 6.
3. 2 Timothy 1. 7. 2 Cor. 5. 13.
This does put an healthful soundness in saving Faith, in wholesome Doctrine,
in a renewed mind. Psalm. 51. 8. compare Isai. 6. 10. Mar. 4. 12.
The pardon of Sin is set out by its having an healing Virtue in it upon the
pardoned. The LORD Jesus Christ has born the Isai. 53, 4, 5. Mat. 8. 17.
diseases of his people, and Mat. 9. 20. 21, 22 Mar. 5. 25 -- 34.
there is a spiritual skill in laying of these upon him, so as to draw healing
Virtue from his humane glorified Body, when quickened by the Spirit, by a touch
of Faith. Ungoverned passions are 1 Thessalonians. 4 5.

How many are those precious promises, in which the LORD has engaged himself
unto his dutiful Children, that walk orderly in his Family, and are always
found doing of that which is well-pleasing unto him, all which are to be
pleaded with him by a Spirit of Faith, with the Prayer of Faith, in the Word of
Faith, as the Case does call for, and as the Matter does require? as otherwise,
sicknesses and diseases are threatened against the unperswadable? Isai. 38. 10,
etc. Mat. 9. 2, 29. Mar. 2. 5. Luke 5. 20. Jam. 5. 15. Psalm. 103. 3, 4, 5. Genesis

How often in the Scriptures does the cure of Diseases follow upon the
remission of sins, with which it is joined? Many Examples it does afford us of
this. Converting Grace does dispossess Satan, who through the sufferance of God
has inflicted, does and still can inflict Diseases: Hence infirmity or
sickness has somewhat of his Luke 13. 11, etc.
Name, as a spirit of infirmity; Intemperance, Gluttony and Drunkenness, do
cause multitudes of Distempers, which would not be, did Grace exercised keep
within due bounds of Moderate Sobriety. Lev. 26. 16.
The Spirit, Soul and Body in man have a mutual influence upon each other, and
it is often well or ill with the one, as it is well or ill with the other. 2 Chronicles. 16. 12. Mar 5. 26. Luke 8. 43. Job 13. 4.
Physicians many times cannot heal, because Jehovah is not sought unto.
Patients, now and then do suffer much from them, and do waste their substance
to little or no good effect; so that they are Physisicians of no value. Job 13
4. Jer. 8 22. Luke 4. 23. Job 5. 18.
A wise Comforter is called a Physician in the Word of God, there is an healing
Virtue going along with his savoury, seasonable, suitable counsel: A deliverer
has the same name; when Jehovah does save, his hands are said to heal; his
saved Ones do know and enjoy the meaning of this; John 5. 14. 2 King. 5. 14, 17
and 20. 5. Isai. 38. 9 -- 21. Mat. 8. 14, 15. Luke 5. 24, 25. and 8. 47. and
13. 13. and 7. 15. and 18. 43. Acts 3. 7, 8, 9. Dan. 8. 27.
healed ones are counseled in order to the continuance, and further enjoyment
of their health, to avoid sin for time to come. A thankful frame is
preservative of health, when all the glory of a cure is given unto Jehovah; and
when the end of a Cure is attained by a return with thankfulness and diligence
to the function of our Office, in our Place, and in our Calling; an eye of
Faith toward Christ Numb* 21. 8, 9.
has been found to be actually healing: Psalm. 42. 5, 11. and 43. 5. and 6. 3.
Thus also sweet sensible satisfying Communion with God is of a nourishing
Virtue, and of an healing efficacy. Psalm. 63. 1, 15. and 34 8. 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3.
Song. 1. 2. Acts. 17. 27. Job 6. 30. Heb. 5. 14.
Spiritual Senses have Spiritual Objects suited, and Heart Senses have Heart
Objects fitted, and outward Senses, have outward Objects prepared. The New
Creature hence has its way of inward reviving and restoring. The Spirit and
Soul sees, hears, smells, tastes, and the sensitive part has its congruous
refreshments, and all these have a tendency to Health. This was Job's Food and
Physic. And O how sweet were these to the Psalmists pallat. John 15. 2, 3.
Act. 15. 9.
This Word of God has a purging, curing efficacy, so also has the Grace of God.

How healing are his comfortings to an wounded spirit, and to a broken heart. 2 Samuel 24. 16. John 5. 1 -- 15.
The Ministry of good Angels is sometimes used both in inflicting of Diseases,
and of Death, as also in curing of Distempers. King. 1. 2, 3, 6, 16.
It is a great sin in case of sickness to consult Dunghil-idols, and not the
God of Israel for cure and for health. Deuteronomy. 28. 22, 27, 28, 35, 59, 60, 61.
National sins do give Names to natural Diseases, As the Botch of Egypt. Deuteronomy.
28. 35. 2 Chronicles. 16. 12. Jude 7.
There is a Talio sometimes in some Diseases, carrying along with them the
resemblance of the provoking deserving cause of them; the whole body sinning
may be struck all over, or some one particular member may be more smitten and
pained, when it is more in trespass. Deuteronomy. 28. 17, 35. 2 Chronicles. 21. 18. Mar. 4.
26. Luke 8. 43. 2 Kin. 20. 1, 5. 2 Chronicles. 32. 24. Isai. 38. 1, etc. Phil. 2.
27. John 11. 4, etc.
Some Diseases are ineurable by any Medicinal Art until there be repenting and
returning. No Disease is so deadly, but that Aelohim can cure it, if he will
prove his Skill, and put forth his Power. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Jam. 5. 14, 15, 16.
Mar. 6. 1^. Mar. 16. 18. Act. 28. 8, 9.
Healing would be a gift in the Churches of Christ, were Churches more rightly
constituted, more regularly gathered, and more orderly walking. The
perturbations and passions of the Heart are Morbifickcauses, hurtful to the
Body as well as to the Soul by operating causality. When joy does exceed, the
Heart forgets its Limits, and leaps beyond its bounds, and so loosneth it self,
that the spirits too frolickly fly out, whereupon weakening, fainting, swooning
and sickning do ensue. Whereas joy moderated does revive the heart, cheer the
spirit, quicken the body, and comfort the whole man. Over-sadness and
undisciplined fear does oppress the Heart, and streighten the Spirit, and
imprison the Soul, and weaken the whole Man; so cooling natural heat, and so
freezing the radical moisture, that the Limbs will tremble, and the Heart
palpitate, the Appetite does flat, the Digestion is disturbed, the the
Distribution impeded, kindly Motion is hindered, distant Members are chilled,
and the whole man is distempered: The flesh is dried, the strength is broken;
the Senses are weakened, the Mind is darkened, the Imagination is clouded and
frighted, the Blood is congealed, and the Spirits are stupefied; It has many
sickning affects upon the whole man. Saving and sanctifying Graces, and holy
heavenly frames, have a Specific Remedy against distempered Passions. Psalm.
38. Psalm. 6. Psalm. 73.
I often find the sick Psalmist thus fetching in a timely cure. A large
Treatise might profitably be published upon this Subject. It would be an Honor
put upon the Learned in the Medicinal Knowledge, if their Profession and
Practice might no longer be only a conjectural Art, a probable Doctrine of vain
Philosophy, but now at length an ascertaining Science of Scripture Verity.

For a further Advance and Augment of useful Science, let it be inquired, from
the Genesis 1. 14 -- 1^^:
fourth Days Work.
Q. Whether the Celestial Phenomenon of the glorious Luminaries, can ever be
reduced to any certain satisfactory Art, or improved into an advanced restaured
Science, by vain Philosophy? Or must this be attained only by
Scripture-Discovery in its pursued Light, and followed Directions.

A. VAin Philosophy can never teach it, it is only learned in the Scripture
School. Precious time will be prodigally wasted in fruitless Disquisitions,
whilst vain affecters of Humane Wisdom are our Teachers, who would Dogmatize
over us, and impose their peremptory assertions upon the easy credulity of
their hood-winck'd Disciples, who have no wings to fore high enough for a
confutation of their New Worlds in the Moon, and in other Luminaries by a close
ocular Demonstration to the contrary. And thus they are hardened into a
confidence of their Art, because they conclude none can convince them from the
received Astronomical suppositions, that it is otherwise than they affirm, and
as they would fairly to the eye represent it in their Artificial Systems and
fancied Schemes, which are but witty devices of Humane Inventions, not the real
Natures of Created Being. Should I ask for such a Scripture Proof, as might
directly answer to the truth of these Celestial Bodies in their proper Nature,
of their Hypotheses, whereby they would salve their cunningly framed,
Schematical Figures and Appearances; It may be I must take a Jear for my
information, and a Jest for my satisfaction. The Extrinsick Faces of those
Heavenly Bodies a vulgar eye may behold; but what their Created Substance is,
what their orderly Motion, what their peculiar Situation, what their operative
Influx, what their periodical Revolutions, and much more of this Nature, in the
true causes, and real effects of them, the most skilful of Ethnic Astronomers,
are but mere conjecturers about them, and can never give us any certainty of
knowledge in these matters; so that the reputation of their skill is only
maintained and upheld by the ignorance and unsearchingness of common
understandings of vulgar Judgments, who have neither leisure nor studiousness
enough to discern the deceitful fictitiousness of such Philosophical Fabrics,
which have no evincing evidence in them. That knowledge which these self
flatterers do boast they have attained, comes in mostly by the sense of seeing,
which how fallible must it be, if the distance were so great between them, and
those Celestial Lights, as they boldly assert? It appears by Chapter 9. chapter 26.
chapter 28.
Job's reasoning about those matters, that he had great knowledge of Natural
Things, and could speak much about the System of the Universe, and the Positure
of the World: But when Jehovah came to argue with him about those Heavenly
Creatures, he now humbly acknowledges that Job 42. 3, 4. and 40. 3, 4, 5.
he was without the knowledge of them, by any mere humane disquisition, which
could never thoroughly find them out in their proper Existences, and Operations,
no other way could the exact knowledge of this be gotten but by the LORD, the
Spirit and the Word: he rehearsed that which he did not understand, wonders
above him which he knew not; above him, not only in place by great distance,
but also beyond hls natural powers of rational Intellect to understand
clearly, or to comprehend fully; he is now made willing to be instructed by
Jehovah and his Word. How quickly does his Philosophical Astronomy vanish,
which he himself readily exploded, when Job 38. 31, 32, 33.
the LORD asked him some few Questions, Can thou bind the pleasantnesses of
Cinah, or loosen the strings of Cesit? Can thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his
time, and lead Gnaish over her sons? Do thou know the Ordinances of Heaven?
or can thou appoint his Government upon the Earth? He points out and names
some of the Celestial Luminaries, and Starry Lights to Job, and quickly
silenceth him; who now lays his hand upon his mouth, and will not answer; such
uncertainty and mistaking was there in his Optic Art, where so vast a space
intervened between his own eye, and those Heavenly Objects; whose Matter,
Motion and Influx, he was so much now at a loss about, though Jehovah Aelohim
has made use of this confutation of Job, to instruct, and to wise us in those
Mysterious Secrets of Created Nature, in the Celestial Bodies Ptolemy and
Copernicus had quite different Schemes, and accordingly they frame quite
different Theories and Suppositions, and yet both of them have undertaken from
the ordinary view and open face of the Heavenly bodies to satisfy their
Scholars concerning the same Phenomenon and the same calculations upon quite
different Astronomical principles: and the Disciples of both these may find out
enough whereby to confute the errors, and to demonstrate the falsness of their
several Hypotheses, but can never convince others or persuade themselves upon
any solid grounds, that they are in the right. Let the seigned Schemes and
imaginary positures of vain Philosophers therefore be laid aside, which are but
their own fancied placits, finely framed to their pleasing models, and let us
for the raising and advancing of this useful Science search after true
subsistencies of concreated Nature in Scripture verity. Psalm. 104. 4, 19. and
148. 2 -- 5. Heb. 1. 7. Coloss. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 4. 9. 2 Cor. 11. 14. Job 38. 7. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7, 8. Rev. 10. and 18. 1. and 19. 17. and 22. 16. Rev. 4. 5. Dan. 10.
6. Mat. 28. 2, ^. Rev. 1. 10.
Which of these Philosophers can fatisfactorily inform us, what kind of bodies
the celestial Luminaries are, whether they be created Angels or not, voluntary
movers, fice Agents or not? Let the virtuous and generous and ingenious,
inquire. As also, whether the Angels were created, on the fourth day? Which of
them can tell me, whether the primitive light do differ from the shining of
those Luminaries or not? But instead of propounding more such questions to
them, I shall treat of some great particulars about these Heavenly bodies:
According to the Scriptures; Contrary to vain, deceitful, foolish Philosophy.
The substance of the celestial Luminaries or Lightners were not made on the
first day of the created World, as if the first scattered light were gathered
together into these lightsome bodies on the Fourth day: But the Sun, Moon, and
Stars are different creatures of several Formation on a distinct day, As Genesis
1. 3, 4, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
the History does expressly mention in the letter of it. These Luminaries are in
their created Nature separating dividers between the Light and the Darkness,
and so are distinct beings from the Light as well as from the Darkness: neither
are they of an Elementarily-aethereal Classis, but have a separate distinct
existence from the Heavens, from the expanded. They are not like studs fixed in
solid Spheres, externally moved by Intelligences or Angels. Colos. 2. 18.
They are not Deities, as the Heathenish Worshippers by their gross Idolatry
would make them. They are not fluid Orbs circularly perpetually moving, but
Psalm. 19. 1 -- 6. Mal. 1. 11. Isa. 59. 19.
they sometimes come out and at other times they go in, according to their
Creator's appointment for designed ends. They do not move round about an
Earthly Center, nor about an Axis of the World. I have shown before, that the
middle of this Earth is not the common center of this visible World.

They are not of Magnetical Verticity, which must be only Polar; and if this
were, would reduce them to their Polar rest, which then also would contradict a
pretended perpetual motion. They are not carried about by the imaginary Rapture
of a first mover, as if they had a second moveable of Renitency, contrary to
the Rapture of the supposed first moveable. Magicians, Judiciary Astrologers,
and Genethliacks, who do undertake by inspection of Stars to foretell future
things, the Fate of men, imposing a necessity upon Men's Wills, and declaring
events, and telling fortunes, as they Ethnickly call it, have no firm footing
in holy Scripture or created Nature. It is a great wrong done unto these
creatures and unto their Creator, when such conjecturers pretend to prophecy
by the Stars, and especially by Comets, the Fates and Fortunes (in their
Paganish Language,) of men: even their very imaginations, affections, and
inclinations, and which is yet more, the counsels and intentions of the LORD
himself with respect to particular persons and contingencies: as if by their
influences these Luminaries did so govern the bodily humors as by them to
govern the mind and spirits of rational voluntary creatures: their
prognostications of future contingent things at so great a distance, are
generally false and always groundless. Jer. 10. 2. Isa 47. 12, 13. Deuteronomy. 18.
10, 11, 12, 14. Mic. 5. 12. Jet. 27. 9.
We are expressly forewarned against this heathen artifice. Such Planetarians or
Contemplators of the planets, were not to be tolerated amongst the people of
Aelohim: Yet were the Israelites themselves given to this, contrary to his
Interdict, herein imitating the Ethnicks, who had their Planetarians, and did
hearken to them, seeking to them, believing of them, trusting to them, and
obeying of them, as their great pretended infallible Oracle. Such were the
Canaanites. How unsound is their Doctrine of Genethliacal positures of the
Heavens and the celestial Luminaries to precise points and to minute
differences of place and of time? As also of the distributions of the Houses
and Horoscopes? How Scriptureless, and Natureless are these? As if men's
Fatalities were influenced thus by the hour of their Nativity or Birth, or else
of their conception? And as if the hour of what shall befall men were determined
by the hour when the question was asked of them? Where does the Word warrant
any such Science of Nativities, Elections, and Questions, and fatal
necessities? Where does it speak of such predictions, by any natural causality
or created efficiency from the Locations of Planets and Stars, their
Conjunctions, Oppositions, and other Constellations, and commixtures of Rays?
Where does it counsel us to take a benevolent Situation or Aspect of Stars in
a Seal or Signet-Ring (of Metals or Gem capable of such impressions) to arrest
the felicity of that hour which otherwise for that punctuality of time would
swiftly pass away, and soon fix it, notwithstanding its volatilousness? Whence
have these Men their power to call Time back again that was flown away? To
revive an hour that was dead and gone? Where does the Word teach us how to set
these Astrological Figures? O what Superstition and Imposture is there here?
Isa. 41. 13.
does it not belong to Jehovah Aelohim only, to know and reveal these Future
things? Was it not one of the presages of the Jews Captivity, Isa. 2. 6.
when they were replenished with the South-saying-Art like the Philistines? In
Nabonassar's Reign above two thousand four hundred years ago, or soon after,
they write, that they divided the Heavens into twelve spaces, called Signs,
unto which the Judiciary Astrologers did ascribe certain virtues or powers over
the several parts of Man's body, and over the several Countries and Nations of
the World, especially by reason of the qualities they supposed to be in the
fixed Stars, which then did take up those spaces. Their Rules are still
observed, though the Stars are removed into the succeeding spaces. The fixed
Stars they say do pass through an whole Sign, in two thousand one hundred and
eighteen years: from the Creation then in about five thousand six hundred years
they have changed their places and spaces, twice and one half at least, which
therefore must quite alter their Rules. Astrologers do scarce look beyond the
Zodiac for their Aspects: Whereas the Stars, which they miscal fixed, may have
as operative configurations with the Planets, as the Planets one with another.
Astrologers do differ much about the dividing of these Houses: Those Stars,
Which, according to Ptolemy (who wrote as they reckon, above one thousand five
hundred years ago,) are in one house, and are said to signify thus, after
Regiomontanus (who is now most followed) are in another house for the same time
and place, and so do signify otherwise. As for the Geuethliacal part, what
sound reason can there be assigned why the Influences of the Stars should make
more impression upon the child in the moment of his Nativity, than they did at
any time before in the Womb? At the first conception matter is fluid, and apter
to receive impression, then when the child is shaped and the temper more
confirmed. There was an old Astrologer who framed a Table to discover to a
minute of Time when the conception first began: But what man can certainly know
that? There have been thousands of people of both Sexes of all Ages born in
sundry places, and under sundry configurations of the Stars who have perished
and dyed in the same hour and moment, by the same common calamity, as
shipwreck, War, Pestilence, Earthquake, fall of Buildings. Some who seem most
successful in setting of Figures for the discovery of things that are lost, or
for prognosticating of Life or Death, are such as scarce know any Planet but
the Sun and the Moon. The practitioners in this Black-Art do usually call for
Men's Faith to be given up to them, which is a devilish Artifice, and a secret
acknowledging of and compacting with Satan, calling and taking off such as seek
unto them from Christ, and from his Word. Astrologers in Scripture are called
Isa. 47. 13.
Consociators, Conjoyners of the Heavens; Either such as are in association and
fellowship with evil spirits in these Contemplations, and Speculations of the
Stars, or else making of Constellations a pretended combination of Stars,
undertaking to discern and judge of future events, to be Prophets of the Stars,
foreseeing after contingencies, foretelling by the Moons and Kalends, monthly
prognosticators, Almanack-presenters; I have compared some of them, who in the
same year and month do differ in the time of their Full and New Moons, neither
can they themselves satisfactorily answer, whether the same Planet have one
effect when in one house of a Figure, and another specific effect when in
another house? And so of the fixed Stars and Signs in the Zodiac: Whether in
the same house or Figure, the Sun by himself has one effect, the Moon another,
Saturn another? And so of the fixed Stars and Signs of the Zodiac, whether the
same point of Heaven, if it be the place of the Sun, in any Genesis retain a
solar force and influence in respect of that Nature as long as he lives? So
Saturn's place a Saturnine virtue, etc. Whether the same point of Heaven which
to one Native is the place of the Sun, to another may be the place of Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon? Whether no Planet have the same
effect in diverse signs of the Zodiac, at least not both Elementally and
Influentially? Whether the hour of the Nativity do not oftentimes, through many
natural occurrencies eithes accelerate or defer? and how then, if so, can that
govern the fate and fortune as they call it of the whole life? And how the hour
of the Question should be co-fatal with the thing it self which is sought? What
demonstrative evidences can any man give me from the Word and Works of God, to
resolve and to quiet the mind of a Believer about these Inquiries? And many
more that might be propounded? How can these Men with all their Humane Wisdom
by their un-scriptural Art inform me where the proper seat of Knowledge and of
Understanding is in Man, whether in the Head or in the Heart? They generally
affirm it to be in the Head, and they constitute Mercury to be the Influential
Governor, having determining Dominion over the Head and Brain, and so over
Knowledge and Understanding.

Whereas, if it can be proved, to be in the Heart, as by scores of Scriptures,
I can argue it so to be, What then do become of all their mistaken
apprehensions and misplaced Judgments in this particular case? O that Jehovah
Christ would once remove South-saying and Witchcraft out of the Land! How much
is it to be lamented, that Numb. 23. 2^.
the God of Nature who is Sovereign LORD over all, and who does in those
Heavens, and in this Earth whatsoever pleases him, is thus dishonored! When
Christ was born, such an Infant was born whose Geniture or Generation is
unutterable, on whom the Influences of the Stars have no power or force; Who
himself does govern by his power the virtue and efficacy of all the Heavenly
Luminaries. Then such a Star appeared, as was destitute of all Elementary
influences out of and off from all the pretended supposed Sphenes.

Because, this Judiciary Astrology has such a malign bewitching influence, on
many in the present day, and its Artists and professors, and practicers have
taken up this plea for it, that the name of Astrologers and of Astrology is not
found any where in the holy Scriptures, and that, therefore its Science and Art
is not condemned by them: let me further examine, whether the thing at least
set out by that Name, be not found condemned there; (although it be no such
commendation for them, in that, they say, their Name is not found in Scripture.)

Gnonenim and Megnonenim, say they, do not signify Planetaries. Whereas if the
root be, Gnun, which both in the Scriptures and with the Rabbis does denote,
opportunity, or stated time, then Megnonen is such a one, as does profess
himself by Art to foreknow, and to be able to foretell to those who do consult
him, what those constituted seasons and definite times are, of good or of evil,
of joyful or of sorrowful; of prosperous, or of calamitous, event in every
affair and business that is undertaken, in ordering a man's life, in taking of
a Journey, in contracting of a Marriage, in sending of an Embassy, in waging of
a War, and in the rest of so many and such various cases, both public and
private (which are wont to befall miserable mortals:) Now seeing the Astrologer
does boast (For, to this purpose they openly hang up their Tables at doors in
London, and privately put their Printed papers into the hands of some as they
walk in the streats) that he can foreknow all these things by the motion and
positure of all the celestial bodies, especially of the Planets, from which he
does also contend, that they are chiefly effected; how can any ingenious Lover
of truth deny with fairness and justness, but that Megnonen does aptly set out
an Astrologer, and a Planetary; seeing he does so Gal. 4. 10.
observe hours, days, months, years, and times, fit and opportune for the doing
of business? The Deuteronomy. 18. 10, 12. 14. Mic. 5. 12. Jer. 27. 9. 2 Kin. 23. 5.
Israelites were not to tolerate such; Hence it was, that the idolatrous
worshipping of the Planets came in. If the Root be Gnajin, an eye, then
Megnonen is such a juggling cozener as deceives and deludeth, inchanteth and
bewitcheth the eyes of others with his eye: If it spring from Gnanan, a Cloud,
then, he is such a one as is a Soothsayer, as does divine, foretell, and guess
conjecturally from the Clouds: the Astrologers eyes are intent to these; the
Augurer and the Astrologer, are very near of kin, for the conjecturer
foretells future events by the contemplation of the Heaven and of the Clouds,
and by their color and motion, Nabulo he properly is, and so let him pass 2
Kings 21. 16. Deuteronomy. 18 14. Lev. 19. 26. Isa. ^. (...) ^er. 27. 9.
under Scripture-condemnation.

Jidegnoni say these Men, is a Divine, a Gnostick, a wife knowing Man.

It is properly in the Scripture-sense and meaning, a Diviner, a Wizard, a
Sooth sayer, or Prognostic, or Fore-teller of future things: These amongst us
are called Wizards, Cunning men, such as pretend to be wise, where they have no
Word for their warrant: This Prognostic Art is ^ev. 20. 6, 27. and 19. 31.
one kind of Divination which is expressly prohibited. The usual companion of
this Wizard, is Ob, in Hebrew, that is such a one as does prophecy and foretell
things to come, by a devilish spirit that is in him, promising Divination by
colloquies with ghosts, with walking spirits of the dead, with the spirits and
souls of Hell, and from Stars, and from Planets. 1 Samuel 28. 13.
This is the Necromantick and Astromantick, Magic Art, one part whereof does
consult with evil spirits below, the other with those in the Air. As this
Prognosticator has a devilish spirit going before him, so in some Scriptures,
he has Teraphim following close 2 Kings 23. 24, 25.
after him, which were certain Images, according to whose inspection, the
Gentiles did either do their work, or leave it undone. Some Astrologers are
wont to make these kind of Figures and Images under certain constellations,
thinking that those Figures and Images are capable of heavenly influxes. Genesis
31. 19, 30, 34.
Laban had such Teraphim, who was a Chaldean by Birth, Kindred and Nation, and
the Chaldeans were some of the most given to Astrological vanities; they
accommodate their Images to constellations, to foretell future events, and to
cure Diseases. 1 Timothy 4. 1.
Daimon, in Greek, that Mantick-spirit, or divining foretelling spirit, does
agree with this Hebrew word: Deu. 18. 10, 11.
this also is forbidden.

They further contend that, Dan. 2. 2, 10. and 4. 7. and 5. 7, 11.
Casedim, does not denote Astrologers.

The Chaldeans had a sect that did spend their time and labor in Astrological
predictions of future contingencies through the whole of Man, and to this they
referred all their study and consideration of the Astronomical Science; and
these were they, who are reported to have been the inventers of judicial
Astrology, or rather Satan himself; For, there are who give this to be the true
meaning of Casedim, from, Caph, as like, as, and Shed the Devil, so that, they
are as Devils, pretending to skill in starry influence, in constellation,
influx, knowing future things in their Art by the contemplation of the
geniture, Genethliack divinators, showing from the hour and day of a Man's
Nativity, what shall befall him in his after life.

They deny also those periphrastical Names in Isa. 47. 13.
Isaiah to signify Astrologers.

Babylon there spoken of, was the most ancient Metropolis of judiciary
Astrologers: and who, or what are they but so many kinds of Astrologers, who
are set out by, Chobere, Hashemajim, and Hachozin baccocabim, and Modignim
echodashim, observers of the Heavens, gazers on the Stars, Prognosticators to
the Moons, making Men believe, that by looking on the Stars, they can foretell
good or evil things to come to Persons, Families, Cities, and Kingdoms? This
and Deu. 18. 10 -- 14. Lev. 19. 31. and 20. 6, 27. 2 King. 21. 6. 2 Chr. 33. 6.
Esai. 8. 19, 20. and 19. 3.
other Scriptures by several names declaring against the several parts of this
Black-art, that none might escape. The seventy two Greek Interpreters do render
Chober Hashshamajim, an Astrologer, and so Kimchi shows the Arabic Idiom does
hold forth, one who assumes a kind of art unto himself of deciding, discerning
and judging from the contemplation of the Heavens and of the Stars, what shall
befall every Man, and what is this but judiciary Astrology, professing
divination by Stars, here then asked counsel, etc. and does not the Astrologer
vauntingly brag, and proudly boast, as if he were (...) Heavenly Arbiter, and
Judge given of nature, unto whom the many and various distinct cases of this
lower World, are deferred or referred, that by his Apotelesmatical Science and
sentence (or by his declaration of the signification of Stars, and of the power
of Planets at one's Nativity, or by the calculation of Men's Nativity) these
cases might be decided, by every Man's decretory and critical Star, and by the
constitution, and conformation of the Heaven? Chober is properly, one who
associating like things together, such as are of the same kind and condition,
as Star to Star, Planet to Planet, such is the present case. Deuteronomy. 18. 11. Ps.
58. 5. Isa. 47. 9.
These kind of Conjoyners, or as we commonly call them, Conjurers, are
condemned in the Word; they are in association and consederacy with devils, by
their incantations, conjuring many animals or living creatures, as serpents,
toads, poisonous reptils, or other creatures to be together at once, making
them tame and familiar that they hurt not, or else binding, or tying bands
about the body to heal or hurt by sorcery. Here the Astrologers do wrangle and
say, that it is not Chober, but Hober, with (...) not with (...): if this were
admitted, yet all our Lexicographers do generaly render it, an Astrologer or
Sooth-sayer, or cutter or divider of the Heavens, from Habar, he parted, he
cut, in Arabic, because he does decide and define by the indication of the
Heaven, or because he does divide the Heaven into several parts when he does
divine or foretell things. These Augures did at the first use a crooked staff in
pointing and designating the quarters of the Heaven in their divination, and
they gave names to these several spaces in the Firmament, the first was called
the fore part toward the East, the hinder part was toward the West, the Right
part toward the South, the Left part toward the North, and so according to
these spaces did they use divination: Afterward they divided the Heavens into
Houses, placing the celestial Luminaries in twelve parted habitations. Aben
Ezra does interpret Hober, an Astrologer, one pretending skill in the
celestial Signs, by which to judge of future events and contingencies, from
Habar he observed, he contemplated, one who diligently beholds the Face of
the Heaven, and considerately views it round about, such a Practitioner in the
Astrological Science, as does labor and endeavor to fetch and draw future
things out of the motions of the Stars. This word in Isa. 45. 1.
Isaiah, according to the points is read Hoberei, and according to the Letters,
Habbaru, those who have looked round about the Heavens on every side. Schindler
does render it Astrologers, Prognosticators, such as do foretell future things
by the Stars. In Chaldee, Habac, is, he was obscured, he was clothed with black
garments, it is a dark Science and a Black-art. Fuller in hi^ miscell. p. 113.
A very learned Critic, does call such a one, an inchanter or charmer of the
Heavens: as an inchanter or charmer by some fictitous, or counterfeited words,
does imagine that he, can change the natures of terrestial things, thinking
that thereby he can put new virtues into them, for the bringing forth of some
stupendous effects, apprehending that by certain Characters and Images
excogitated by himself and formed into this or that shape or Figure, some
wonderful energy, some notable power will follow thereupon; thus also the
Astrologer, from a vain tradition of curious Men and by new-devised, invented
and sained rules, such as have no proper causality, at all that way, he being
deceived with the error of an opinion thinks and supposes, that the heavenly
bodies are endued with new and unusual properties, and not so congruous to
their own nature; he attributes to the celestial Images, chiefly to the twelve
Signs of the Zodiac Orb (all which are the sigments of Men's own brain) a
wonderful efficacy for the distinct producing and prenunciating or foretelling
of particular events So that, both the Augures and the Astrologers are
conversant and employed about the Heavens, those in the acrial Heaven, these in
the Ethereal Heaven: and as those by Fowls, so these by Stars, abase those
creatures to bring about their own predictions: also both of them do divide the
Heavens into certain parts or segments, by the aid and help whereof they
foresee future things, hither tends, refers, and belongs, that singular
artifice of Astrologers, of making or setting in order a celestial figure, of
setting or erecting a Scheme, which figure they would have to contain the state
of Heaven and the Planets at that certain time, an Horoscope, the consideration
of the time of one's Nativity, or birth under this or that Planet. Thus by
these segments of the Heavens, which they divide, some into four quarters,
others into twelve houses, some others into sixteen parts, they curlously seek
and confidently say they find, hidden significations of future things. This
Prophet Isai^h, exegetically or by way of exposition, does add, Inspectors, or
contemplaters of the Stars, Star gazers pretending hereby to a fore-knowing of
future contingencies, to a feeling of them before they come: they have one word
of that name, by which a true Prophet is called, Chozeh, in Scripture, yet not
absolutely as he, but there is added for distinction sake, Cocabim, they are
contemplators of Stars, who though they pretend as a true Prophet to foresee
future particular contingencies, yet they differ in the means used and had, For
a true Prophet is God-inspired, knowing future things only by divine
Revelation, whereas these Astrologers do it by their black Art, and by the aid
of Creatures, by which Art the Heavenly Bodies are feigned to be endued with
certain rare properties, such as these men do counterfeit, who have not
therefore their knowledge of God, they may be called Star-Prophets.

Another Epithet, or addition to an Astrologers name in this true Prophet
Isaiah, is such a one as is making known his predictions to the Month, or to
all and every of the Calends, for Isai. 47. 13. 2 King, 4. 23.
so does Chodesh here, and in other Scriptures properly signify. This is the
ancient Praxis of Astrologers, by which they are wont to divulge and publish
their elaborate presentions of future things, digested into certain spaces of
times, chiefly monthly: they think they have attained to a prognostic skill in
the power of the Stars to prenunciate futurities, such as the scarceness and
dearness, or plenty and cheapness of Corn, Wars and Peace, the death of
Princes, and of other great Men, Universal Health, or Epidemical Diseases, and
such like various cases, both private and public, that does befall the life of
man with great uncertainty of contingency, as to us: From these Monthly
Pronosticators do proceed so many popular Ephemerides, Calendaries, and
Almanacks, in which they undertake to be Interpreters of the Heavens, and of
the Luminaries there; and most of the buyers of these Books of imposture, do
look upon the foretelling part, as the most desirable part of their Almanac:
Some attempts have been made by some to correct, and to rectify these abuses
about computations of times, and predictions of futurities, to bring all to
Scriptural Accounts and Prophesies, upon which so many other Truths and Duties
do depend, but the honor of perfecting of this, as well as of other such good
work is like to be reserved for another generation, the more grown in the
present age being generally either cold and careless about it, or averse from
it, or opposing of it. All our Hebrew Lexicographers do generally agree in
condemning both the Art and the Praxis of Astrology, which would impose upon
men a Star-word of Humane Invention without a written word of Divine
Inspiration.

O how much is it to be lamented, that as of old, even in Israel, so now even
in England, those Soothsayers and Wizards, these Diviners of future things are
so consulted with, 1 Samuel 28. 7, etc. 1 Chronicles. 10. 13. Isal. 8. 19. Zech. 10.
2. Lev. 19. 31. and 20. 6. Deuteronomy. 18. 10, 11, 12. 1 Samuel 28. 3, 9. 2 King. 23.
24. and 21. 6. 2 Chronicles. 33. 6.
even by the LORD's professing people; which is directly contrary to Aelobim's
express interdict and prohibition! These kind of men were not to be tolerated
in a truly Religious Commonwealth, but by Jehovah's Law were to be put to
death, and to be exterminated: It is charged upon Manasseb, a King, as his sin,
that he tolerated and used such. (...) is a Prognosticator, according to the
Hebrew Idiotism, having the force of a compound: These were they, whom Deuteronomy.
18. 11, 12. 1 Samuel 6. 2. Isal. 19. 3. and 47. 12, 13. Genesis 41. 8. Ezekiel. 21. 16,
21. Dan. 2. 2. and 4. 6, 7. and 5. 7. and 2. 10.
the Heathenish Pagans so much resorted unto, as if they had consulted with an
infallible Oracler.

There is a sort of divining conjecturers, who would be foretelling of omens,
or the good or bad luck or fortune, as they Heathenishly phrase it, by
foretokens of things to come from Serpents: Deuteronomy. 18. 10, 12. 2 King. 17. 17.
and 21. 6. 2 Chronicles. 33. 6. Lev. 19. 26.
Such a one is called (...) from (...), they did abjure a Serpent, and use him
in their Sooth-sayings; they were observers of conjectures, and so they passed
a foretelling judgment; which is condemned by the LORD in his Word.

Reader, art thou willing that I should pursue and apprehend more of these?
there is one of them called, 1 Samuel 6. 2. Josh. 14. 22. Ezekiel. 21. 18, 19, 21,
22, 23. Deuteronomy. 18. 10 -- 14. 1 Samuel 28. 7, 8, etc. Jer. 29. 8. Zech. 10. 2. Lev.
19. 31. and 20. 6, 27. Esal. ^. 19. and 19. 3. Hos. 4. 12. and in either places.
Kosem, who also exercised himself to know future things, foretelling them;
which word when it is taken in all ill sense, is also much condemned; for such
did exercise their divelish art by juggling, legerdemain, crafty slight, and
wily delusions, and abominable witchcrafts: These Diviners by clean Knifes, by
consulting of Idols, by inspection of the liver, and of the bowels, inwards and
intrals of Sacrifices would prenunciate future things: sometimes they did use a
staff or rod in their divinations, otherwhile they would peep and mutter, with
much Dan. 2. 27. and 4. 7. and 5. 7, 11.
more; but none shall escape a Scriptural arrest. Gazerin, in Chaldee, were
some of this sort, which word Schindler does render Astrologers; these also
undertake to foretell future things by inspection of the intrals of those
Sacrifices which they did diffect; it was one of the curious Arts of the
Chaldeans.

Psalm. 58. 5. Jer. 8. 17. Esai. 8. 19. Deuteronomy. 18. 11, 12. Numb. 23. 23. and 24.
1. 2 King. 17. 17. Esai. 47. 9 -- 15. Exodus 7. and 8. chapters.
Choberei Shamajin, somewhat spoken of before, were Planet-housers, or
Star-housers, or Constellators, Consociators of the Heavens; such as had
fellowship and compact with the Devil in their wicked Art, Mutterers,
Inchanters by mussitation; some of them sometimes would utter their verses to
inchant Serpents, that they might not bite nor hurt.

Psalm. 58. 5.
Melachasim also were one sort of such Mutterers with a submiss voice, with a
low hollow sound, which is usual with Inchanters and Exorcists, Conjurers,
secretly sibilating, or hissing like Serpents or Snakes, with their conceived
words. Exodus 7. 22. and 8. 7, 18.
(...) are Clandestine conjurings. Exodus 7. 11.
Lehatim, are submiss, low, admurmurings or hissings, waggings of the fingers,
and quick gesticulations, or gesturings, or movings of the hand, like the
shining vibrations of a brandished Sword, holding and deceiving of the eye with
juggling delusions, and crafty sleights. Dan. 1. 20. and 2. 2. Genesis 41. 8, 14.
Exodus 8. 7, 18, 19. and 9. 11. and 7 11, 12, 22. 2 sim. 3-8. Dan. 4. 7, 19. and
5. 11. and 2 10, 17. Acts 8. 9, 11. and 13. 8, 10.
Chartummim were one sort of these, such cozeners and juglers, as did deceive
and delude the sight with legerdemain, dazeling and misting, blinding, and
binding the eyes of by standers with their Inchantings, Bewitchings, and
Sorceries, and Magic devices, that their deceits might not be discerned and
discovered: The word seems to be compounded of Cheret, an Instrument to write
in Tables, and Atam, he shut up or stopped, because these juglers, were wont to
draw circles and many Characters with such a Pen or Pencil, whereby to
demonstrate, or to make men mad with their witchcrafts, circumventing of others
with circulating figures and discourses.

Doresh ael. hammatim, is another kind of them, Deuteronomy. 18. ^1, 12. Esai. 8. 19.
and 65. 4. Psalm. 106. 28. Numb. 25. 3. 1 Samuel 28. 7, 8.
a Necromancer, a consulter of the Dead: This sort of Magic Art the Scripture
also does condemn. These Necromancers are wont to sit by Sepulchers, by Graves
in places of Burial to call and to fetch out departed Souls, and to consult
with them, and they use to spend Nights in desert places: the sacrifices of the

men, which yet they asked counsel of, as if they had been gods.

sets out, that sort of Fortune Tellers, as they call them, who pretend to an
Art of Palmestry, and of Physiognomy; as if fates were inscribed on the hands,
and they could know by the lines there, what should befall man, and give answers
to secret Questions about future contingencies by Chiromantick divination; as
if a Ship be at Sea, whether it be safe or no? If one be absent, whether dead
or a live? if alive, when he shall return? Whether life shall be long or short,
happy or unhappy? In what part of the World, Country or City, is best to live
in? Whether one shall be rich or poor? if rich, when and by what means attain
it? A Journey, if good to go or no, and when it may be the time to set forth
in? If good to buy Houses, Lands or Leases? when and in what place most
profitable? Reports concerning Husbands, Wives, Children, Friends, Ships at
Sea, or other things, if true or false? Whether a Woman be with child or no? if
with child, whether a Male or Female? Whether a man shall fall into the danger
he fears or no? or how he may escape it? What kind of person one shall marry,
and when they shall see them? if marry the person desired, and the time when?
whether the Portion be small or great? or may be attainable? If good to remove,
and which way? Money owing, if recoverable, and when? Suits at at Law, who
shall overcome, and in what time? A voyage to Sea, if good or no? If one may
profit by his Trade or no? If one may attain the Dignity, Office or Preferment
he desires, and when? A Friend whether real or no? Whether one sick may live or
die? what their Disease is, and when recover? Oh what bold daring attempts are
these, thus to intrude into the hidden Secrets of the Sovereign LORD?

such as under the name of Natural Science did exercise diabolical Arts,
Exorcists, Witches, devilish Artizers. They are expressly condemned.

spirit in him, giving forth answers, whom some did worship as their God, when
the Devil out of a swollen big Belly gave forth answers to those who asked him
concerning some past, present or future things: These Magicians or Witches
being possessed by an evil, unclean spirit, spoke his Oracles with an hollow
voice, as out of a Bottle, sometimes in Statues, othertimes in Caverns, Dens,
or hollow places of the Earth, and in the swollen bellies of men, or in the
joints, or armholes, or armpits, making the Devil to come up out of the
Sepulchers of the dead, or some underground place. This is condemned in
Scripture, the Hebrew, Pethen, is Python, Asp, a kind of a very venomous
Serpent, which cannot be persuaded by Enchantment.

Those Isai. 47. 13.
Monthly Prognosticators, spoken somewhat of and against before, do very much
impose upon the credulity of the ignorant and superstitious: such are the
foretelling Almanakers. See Minsheus, Guide into Tongues on Almanac.
The word Almanac in Low Dutch, is said, as it were, Al-maen-acks, that is a
consideration or observation of all the Moons of an whole year; or according to
the opinion nf some others, is said to signify in the Arabic, Chaldean, and
Hebrew Tongues, Vide Schindl. in suo pentag. (...) nempe cum Puncto supra (...).
a Number or Numeration. Joseph Scaliger affirms, that the Arabians called a
Calendar so, adding their Article, Al; for some are persuaded, that it is not a
mere Arabian word, but only received into custom with the Arabians, Calendries;

Nicholas Fuller does apprehend it to be more ancient from the Egyptians, who
were famous for Astrology: The Roman Senators and Nobles were so bewitched by
these Astrological devices, that they would scarce do a common action, without
scrupulously consulting their Ephemeris, about the Signs, Planets and Stars;
and the Christian Emperors ran into the same guilt, who would not attempt any
change without first asking counsel of the Stars, in their public and private
affairs, resorting to the luminary Tables of Astrologers.

The Judiciary Astrology, or Divination by Stars has so far extended its
prognosticating black Art, as that it undertakes to determine, not only
probably, but also certainly, every man's Lot, Portion, Fortune (as they
Paganishly speak) issues, events and ends; whereas, there are no true necessary
causes of these to be found in the Stars; so that, implicitly at least the
practitioners therein do oblige themselves to the Devil, and daringly fight
against plain prohibions in Scripture. How can they answer that expostulation
of Jehovah with Job 38. 33.
Job? know thou the Ordinances of Heaven? Can thou dispose the Dominion
thereof in the Earth? These Artists do not know the certain moment of a man's
Nativity at so great a distance of years, when they were not present at it: the
arising of the Signs has a Latitude, and a small difference in time they
themselves do acknowledge does make a great difference, and some Astronomers do
affirm, that the same Aspect of Stars has scarce returned from the beginning
of this World: Astrologers are yet at an uncertainty among themselves, how the
Houses are to be divided, how far their influencing forces do reach, and what
Signs they should use: How great a variety is there amongst them about the
diffance of Planets between themselves? with much more, that might be added;
though Gaffarellus has feigned an Hebrew Alphabet in the Celestial Figures,
and that the putting of Letters together, gives a certain meaning: Thus the
Devil abuses them, to whom as to a Doctor and Interpreter, Judiciary
Astrologers do apply themselves. This consulting with such Diviners is very
pernicious, both in respect of its Original, which is wicked, as also of the
event, which does often torment and vex men before the time; for, if evil be
foretold shall befall a man, the fears of it do sadden the spirit, and make him
miserable before the evil actually come; and if it be some good that is
promised, the frustrating, vain, disappointing, expectation thereof, does so
bind up their deceived imagination, that it leaves them in a sluggish
distemper, and they do not make out after better things; and however, what is
so foretold, does sometimes come to pass; yet it should be remembered, that
often times they miss: Diverse by the perspicacity of their Nature, and by long
experience may conjecture many things, which they would have their disciples to
ascribe to Stars, Planets and Signs: and the force of imagination is such, that
those who ask counsel of Astrologers, do sometimes fall into the evil they
fear, and sometimes attain the good they pursue: Sometimes the LORD in just
judgment does suffer Satan to inflict such evils, as he foretold should come
to pass: Sometimes it is merely providential as to God, and wholly conjectural
as to men: Thus some young men feigned themselves to be Mathematicians, and
they conjectured and foretold what was true and came to pass ^ and if they
sometimes so fall out to be, as is divined, such consultings therefore are the
more to be avoided; for, where there is neither institution in Scripture, nor
causality in Nature, there is the greater suspicion of some latent diabolical
fraud. The Pythoniss in the Acts 16. 16^ 19.
Acts was a true Witness in that particular, yet was she possessed with a
spirit of divination: Society and compacts with Devils, both explicit and
implicit, are very formidable, and altogether to be abhorred: Consulting with
such evil spirits, is full of dangerous curiosity, of tormenting solicitude,
and of deadly slavery* 2 King. 1. 3. 1 Samuel 15. 23. Lev. 20 6. Esai. 8, 19, 20.
Acts 16. 16 -- 19. Esai. 29. 4.
To consult the Devils Oracles in doubtful cases, is Apostasy from, and denying
of, the true God; and to resort for divining unto one that has a Familiar, is
a seeking to, and a worshipping of the Devil: So is Sorcery and Necromancy, 1 Samuel 28, 11, etc.
where the Devil is sought unto in the form of some dead man; the Devil
appeared in the likeness of Samuel; it was not the true Samuel, but mere
illusion of Satan; for God had refused to answer Saul by Prophets, such as
Samuel was: Saul is said to have died for his 1 Chronicles. 10. 13, 14.
Transgression, principally in that he sought and asked counsel of a familiar
spirit. Sooth-saying by the flying and noise of Birds is also condemned;
usually the care of persons in this case is to avoid the seeing or the hearing
of such kind of ominous signs, which would signify nothing as to good or evil
in themselves in this matter, were it not for the consent of the observer: they
have no force, efficacy, or operativeness at all this way, were it not for the
superstitious conceits of the mind, when it is diligently bended, and
intentively turned to them, whereby diverse things do befall diverse men,
according to the diversity of their thoughts and imaginations. Of the like
Nature is divination by Ezekiel. 21. 21.
looking into the entrails of Beasts; so did the King of Babel, who consulted
with Idols, and looked into the Liver; so is star-gazing, charms, mumbling of
words, for such an end, casting of Figures for this purpose, and the like.
There should not be any found among us, Deuteronomy. 18. 10, 11. Lev. 20. 6.
that uses witchcraft, or is a regarder of times, or a marker of the flying of
Fowls, or a Sorcerer, or a Charmer, or that consulteth with Spirits, or a
Sooth-sayer, or that asks counsel of the dead. To a seeking unto these, the
holy Spirit does oppose Deuteronomy. 18. 10 -- 15. Isai. 8. 19, 20. and 19. 3, 12. and
44. 25, 26. Jer. 27. 9. 29. 8.
a Prophet, as the only lawful Minister of God, to know his Will by: To ascribe
such a special foreknowledge or foretellingness indicated by the positure of
Stars, which might rule over the consciences and wills of voluntary Agents is
contrary to that Sovereign Authority, which the LORD does exercise over the
wills of men, bowing and bending, moving and directing them, which way he
pleases; and therefore such a power is not to be arrogated by any mere
Creatures. Angels themselves, whether good or bad, have not such an innate
Light in them, as of themselves to know future particular contingents before
hand; neither can the intellect of man so foreknow: Astrologers therefore, not
having their pretended prescience, and prognosticating skill, either by Divine
Revelation, or by Natural Causalities, they have it by diabolical suggestion.
That knowledge of determinate future things, which any really have by Divine
Revelation, is Prophecy, and not Divination. Such prying curiosity as has
neither Scripture or Nature to bottom upon, is experienced and bewrayed to be
the common disease of the vain itching mind of fallen unquiet man; from hence
has sprung this troublesome question about Judiciary Astrologers, who would
bind men to fatal Stars, as if the body of man were composed and fashioned
according to the twelve Signs of Heaven, as if the Moon had dominion in man's
body, under the twelve Zodiacal Constellations, placing Aries in the Head and
Face, Taurus in the Neck and Throat, Gemini in the Arms and Shoulders, and from
thence running through the other Signs, into the other parts of the body, even
to the very soles of the Feet, which they ascribe to Pisces. Did the Authority
of Christ, and of his Word, take more sensible hold of men's hearts, they would
tremble more, and not dare to adventure upon those prohibited evils, which the
LORD has so dreadfully threatened with such Lev. 19. 26, 31. and 20* 27.
sore judgments, that the soul, which turns it self unto Diviners and
Prognosticators shall be cut off from the midst of his people. Man or Woman,
when there is in them a familiar Spirit, or that is a Wizard, they shall be
surely put to death, they shall stone them with stones, their bloods shall be
upon them, their death shall be upon their own head, their own sin is the just
cause of it: and the Sea Daltons Justice of peace, chap. 107. the fifth Edition.
Statute Law of England does make many of those practices to be Felony, which
yet are commonly used in this Nation. In the day, when the LORD will honor
himself by reviving of his Judicial Laws, and by raising up of such as Josiah
was, a Nonesuch for reformation in this kind, 2 King. 23. 24 ^^26. Mic. 5. 12.
to put those Laws in due execution, when these evils are espied out, one such
Example, in such an age of speculative and practical Atheism and Infidelity,
may be a more forcible argument with some, than ten Scriptural reasons now are.
The certain knowledge of future particular contingents, is that Isai. 41. 21,
22, 23. (...) very (...) dognoscendi ab idolis. Isai. 47. 12, 13. and 44. 25,
26. Dan. 2. 27. 28.
by which the true God is differenced, and distinguished from Idols. The LORD
does nippingly touch and sharply check the vanity of this Art, and the
cheatingness of its Arrists, and the ignorance and credulity of those, who do
yield themselves to be deluded thereby: He does sttaitly charge, and sorely
threaten, such confident boasters of their Astrological skill. In the Apostles
time, when the Doctrine of the Gospel did more obtain and prevail, these black
Arts, were condemned, and the Books that treated of them were burnt: Those kind
of evil practitioners are described by a Act. 19. 19. (...) Acts 8. 9. See
Schindlers pentaglot, on Charash. and Hottingers E^ymol. Orient. on the same
word, and Dr. Castles Heptaglot.
Syriack word, and so is the word in Chaldee and Samaritan too, which does
designate and denote, not only such Magicians as are plainly and evidently
given to diabolical arts, but also to such arts of Enchantment, of Juggling,
deceiving by slight conveyance, deluding the eyesight with Legerdemain, such
curious illusory Arts, which though to the ignorant and vulgar may seem to be
otherwise, yet really are wicked Artifices, such are the feigned devices of
Planetaries, and Casters of Nativities: and the Constitutions of some of the
Christian Emperors have ordered, that such Books of such Astrologers should be
burned. A large Volume might be quickly written on this subject matter: but if
the Word of the LORD be not submitted unto, Who am I, that I should think to
silence these Adversaries by the force of my reasoning with them? I therefore
leave it with the LORD to plead his own cause, in his own way, in his own time.
If I have Instanced in some evil Arts, which the Reader may apprehend do not so
properly belong to Judiciary Astrology, let him consider, that this black Art
does spread it self wide and far, and besides, when I was upon this, I was
willing to bring in my Testimony against all that evil which sought for some
protection from Judiciary Astrology, and had some ways a Relation to it.

I now proceed to the Scripture discovery; The Darkness, Evening and Night were
divided more generally before, as to Time, Place, and Nature, from the Light,
Morning and Day, in their created Beings, and successive courses, and now they
were further specially distinguished and pointed out by the Heavenly
Luminaries. Time was not first measured by the Sun, for, there was Time before
the Luminaries were created, which were to stated pre^^ite certain seasons, and
those Heavenly Lights do now point out all Instituted times which have
foundation in Scripture and in Nature: particularly the Evening and Morning of
every day, and the Seventh-day Sabbath, every Week, Mar, 2. 27.
For ^d^m, for mankind generally, and was so appointed in this one week at the
first, and is still to be kept and observed by virtue of that first command.
The Sun and the Planets, and the Stars are not the centers and foundations of
all the Vortices and motions of matter and corpuscles about them. For the
center is supposed to be the lowest, whereas these Luminaries are above and do
shine over this Earth: Isa. 55* 9.
The Heavens are high above the Earth. The Sun and the Genesis 1. 16. Ps. 136. 7.
Moon are the two great Luminaries, so called in respect of the lesser lights,
which are not so great, either in visible appearance, (and whether in real
quantity or not, does deserve a more through disquisition?) or in diffused
light, or in Influential operation and efficacious Virtue. And so are of more 1
Cor. 15. 41.
glorious excellency than the rest. The Moon is a great light, really,
positively, so, the standing still of the Sun and Moon Josh. 20. 12, 13, 14.
in Joshua's time was a great wonder. If the Sun had naturally as the common
center, stood still, and the Moon and the Earth had moved, how had it been
proper and true to say Sun and Moon stood still? Or if it had been spoken
popularly and falsely, as some boldly and untruly affirm, must it not then have
been said only, Sun stand thou still? What absurdities would these Philosophers
conceive the Scriptures or the God of Truth in the Scriptures, to speak both
properly and improperly, really and popularly, truly and falsely at the same
time and in the same words? Ps. 19. 4, 5, 6. Mal. 1. 12.
The Sun is a strong one running his Race, he goes in, in the Evening, and he
goes forth in the Morning. The Sun does not make or constitute the day, Genesis 1.
16. Psalm. 236. 8.
but he has dominion over the day, having his being and use assigned on the
fourth day, and therefore also was not created on the first day, when the
Primeve light was made. The Moon has an Innate light of her own, Genesis 2. 14.
18. Ps. 136. 7, 9.
having both the Name and the Nature of a Luminary, and was so created at the
first. A lesser Luminary does not deny but affirm the lesser to be createdly,
existingly, actually, really, a Luminary, or Lightner, or Lighter, as well as
the greater, though not altogether as great, synony mously and univocally such;
she is a Luminar not a Specular, having seasons of walking in her own Job 31.
26, Ezekiel. 32. 7, 8. 1 Corinthians. 15. 41. Isa. 60. 19, 20. In almost all Longuages
and Tongues the Moon has its names from Lucidness splendour and light. In Hebrew
Lebanah, from its whiteness and fairness. So in Arabic. (...) in Greek Luna in
(...) quasi Lucina. Urania is often used for the Moon from Aour light. Mark 13.
24. It is one of the (...) Genesis 1. 14, 16.
glorious brightness which our eyes do see. Even when Eclipsed she is visible
to us in her whole disk, which Astronomers do suppose not to be illustrated by
the Sun. Have any of these Philosophers satisfactorily proved as yet, that the
Eclipse of the Moon is indeed caused by the supposed shadow of the Earth, cast
upon some part of the Moon, and stepping between the Sun and the Moon? For,
besides that, such a shadow at such a great distance, according to their common
placits and traditioned suppositions, could not darken so great a part of the
Moon, yea the whole of the Moon, were the Moon of so great a bigness as they
also affirm; Darkness and shadow they say are no real things, but only absence
of Light, and how can that obscure a lightsome body, if darkness have no
positivity or existence of it is own? All the darkness in the night cannot
hinder a Rush-candle from shining. Further, if such a shadow were the cause,
then why is not the whole opposite Hemisphere illuminated by the direct Rays of
the Sun in the Night at such times, when the Moon does not so shine? the Moon
has not all her Light from the Sun according as that part of the Moon in its
increases and decreases which is nearest the Sun is illustrated according to
it is more or less opposite position. This they assign to be the cause, but if
it were so, then that Diameter of the Moon, which does cut the enlightened part
of the Moon into two equal parts must also in a right line pass into the
Diameter of the Sun. Which is not so: As any discerning eye may observingly
conclude by ocular demonstration. If the Moon as they suppose, do move about
fifty miles in a minute, how then can some Eclipses of the Moon last so long as
they do, if it were caused only by the shadow of the Earth? And how small a
proportion is that part of the Hemisphere which the body of the Moon does take
up when it is Eclipsed at its first arising, if you compare it with the
Compass, that it goes from her going forth to her going in? The Eclipse also of
the Sun, they assert may be total to some in some parts of the Earth by the
Moon's being in conjunction and stepping in between the Sun and the Earth: But
how can this be, if as they say, the Sun be one hundred sixty and six times
bigge^ than the Earth, and the Moon be forty and six times less then the Earth.

Astronomers therefore must enquire after some other cause of Eclipses, let it
be searched after, Rev. 9. 1, etc. and chapter 8. 9, 10, 11. If Philosophers
assigned the true causes of Eclipses how can Sun and Moon be Eclipsed at once.
Whether Satan who by his Fall having lost his Luminariness, and being become
darkness, and the Prince of darkness, be not at least one cause? It is further
a Philosophical error, to affirm the Moon to be an Earth. Genesis 1. 2, 5, 14, 19.
For, the Earth was made, and perfected before that the Heavenly Luminaries had
any created being. These had their existence three days after that. Neither is
there dry fruit-bearing Land in the Moon, Genesis 1. 12.
for the Earth and not the Moon does by the Creator's Ordination bring forth
Grass, Herbs, and^ Trees. Neither are there Seas in the Moon, Genesis 1. 8, 9, 10,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
For the Seas were created and put into their proper places here below before
the Moon had a being. Neither is the Moon Genesis 1. 2, 14, 15. 16, 17, 18.
Opacous, nor the Earth Luminous. The Histories of the Creation are evident
confutations of these and many other human inventions. Genesis 1. 16. Ps. 136. 9.
The Moon does not make or constitute night, but has Dominion over it: Ps. 89.
37.
She is a faithful witness in Heaven. The Stars are Ps. 148. 3.
burning shining bodies, having their own inherent burning flame, as well as
the Sun, and Emanant without his Collustration. If Stars were of such a
magnitude as Ethnic Philosophers do assert, how could Mat. 2. 2, 7, 9, 10.
that Star in Christ's time point out to the Wise men, that particular House in
Bethlehem, when Christ was new born? and Rev. 6. 13. and 9. 1.
how could the Stars of Heaven fall down upon the Earth, like as the Fig Tree
casts her green Figgs, when she is shaken of a mighty Wind? Esa. 40, 12. Jer.
31. 37. and 33. 22.
It is too great boldness in Earthly man to assign the magnitude, altitude,
distance, of the Heavenly Luminaries: can a dusty Worm measure the Heavens
above, or number the Host of Heaven? art thou able to mete out the Heavens with
a span: No mere Man can exactly tell the number of the Stars. Though
Astronomers have been over confident this way, as if they could give a
particular punctual account of all and of every one of them. One of them
reckons one thousand two hundred forty and one, visible to us. Another of late,
has added one hundred thirty six Stars more, which make up one thousand three
hundred seventy and seven. A third has observed some few more. Johovah Aelohim
Adonai has the peculiar honor of Ps. 147. 4.
numbering and of naming the Stars, which to Man is impossible. Abraham was
esteemed no mean Astronomer, Genesis 15. 5.
yet he could not number them. There is not one day of the week for the Sun, a
second for the Moon, a third for Mercury, a fourth for Mars, a fifth for
Jupiter, a sixth for Venus, a seventh for Saturn, as the Ethnic Philosophers
do un-scripturally, anti-scripturally name them and assign them their several
days in the week. For Sun, Moon, and Stars were all created on the Fourth day
of the one Week of the created World. There was not a several distinct Planet
made on each several day of the Week. Neither is the fourth day of the week
unlucky or unfortunate, as they call it; It is not a curse, M^^rah.
as if Infants were more taken with the squincy on that day than on any other
day of the week, whence the superstitious custom of fasting upon that day. And
now, O my Soul, what was Adam, and what is the Son of Adam, that Jehovah
Aelohim has created such a spangled Isa. 40. 22.
Tent for Man to have it so spread over his Head! If the out side pavement that
leads the way to the new City, and to the Holy of Holies be so shining, O then,
how glorious is Christ's Father's House, within, and the many Mansions there!
If the purer Churches in the latter-day Glory, will be Song 6. 10.
fair as the Moon, and clear as the Sun, how beauteous then will the Church of
the firstborn be in Heaven! If Pastors shall shine as Dan. 12. 3. Rev. 1. 16,
20. and 2. 1. and 3. 1.
Stars, and the new created people luster forth as the Firmament, if what is
yet more, all and every of the Righteous shall shine forth as Mat. 13. 43.
the Sun in the Kingdom of Christ's Father, O what a perfect day will it be,
when all these Suns shall shine together? and what is yet more than all this,
when the Lamb shall be Rev. 21. 23.
the Light of the new City, and all those other lights almost dis-appear at the
presence of the out-shining overcoming brightness of the LORD Jesus Christ
himself there! O, blessed be Jehovah, who gives unto any Psalm. 36. 9. ^ John

in this Light to see, to walk in, and to enjoy, any of this Light whilst they
are here! O, for that day, when ^ Pet. 1. 19. Rev. ^. 28.

arising of Mal. 4. ^.
the Sun of Righteousness with healing in his wings!

The Genesis 1. 20 -- 25.
Fifth Days Work does afford us this Inquiry.
Q. Whether that part of Natural History, which does concern Fowls, Fishes,
Beasts, and Worms, can ever be completed into a Natural Art in the way of
Ethnic Philosophy? or must we search after it only in the Word of Truth, where
alone it can be advanced and perfected by a due and diligent comparing of their
Created beings in their proper Natures.

Answ.

THis Natural History, and Natural Art above these living Creatures can never
attain to any considerable growing Augment, much less to a through full
discovery, in the way of Ethnic Philosophy; The restoring and finishing of
this is no where else to be found but only in the Holy Scriptures, by a due and
diligent comparing of their created beings, in their proper Natures. An art
when it is discovered aright is but Nature opened. This art must be natural,
made up of Existencies and of Realities according to the truth of things, in
the Being of these Creatures. That which is proper Art, is not a Supplementary
addition of somewhat to Nature, which was not Nature before by the Law of the
first Creation; For, that were to make a created man to be a creating Artificer
of what was never made before, which we all explode. But it is a revealing, and
a drawing forth of that secret which did lie hid in Nature. The art of man may
call out the wonderful productions of many great effects, but still these are
wrought in the orderly course by Natural Causalities, and by Created
Efficiencies. The rarest Artist can but cooperate with Natures Powers, which
does their own work, only man puts them together, or severs them asunder,
according as he would have some products by Motions to be. However yet, the
mysteries and wonders of Art must first be sought where they may be found, in
the mysteries and wonders of Scripture, declaring those mysteries and wonders
to be in Nature. Practice of Arts is a disclosing of secrets of Nature in
creation of Causes. Art does sometimes give a provocation to Nature, whereby
she does bewray her self ere she is aware, and does expose her self to view in
the light in some of her agen^ies which kept close in the dark before; and
therefore Nature and Art in Scripture Language do set this out. Melaacah.

That word which does signify Art, exercising it self industriously about any
thing or substance, comes from a word which does import a delegated Officer,
one employed in such a Function, as is put upon him by creating Aelohim; and
that Function must always be sought for in the Word, as revealed there: and
another word which does denote one excelling in Art, nourishing of it, and
being nourished by it, does spring from a word which does include Faith and
Truth. And where can those firmly bottom but upon the Word of Truth, and the
Word of Faith? And the same Word which does signify Essence, Existence,
created Being (by which I understand Nature in this Discourse) does also import
Virtue, Law, Doctrine. They are the only true Vertuosi in Learning, who receive
Doctrine about all Entities from Jehovah Aelohim's Law in his Word. This does
teach substantial knowledge, and does give essential Science, and does skill in
the Art of Realities. There are several Writers who have undertaken to give us
an accouut of these Creatures, in their Elaborate Histories of them; one of the
largest and learnedest upon Animals has this great error running through much
of his Book, that though he refers much of this discovery to the Scripture, yet
he would have Original Hebrew, which is the Mother Tongue, to go to School, and
to learn to speak of Daughter-Languages, such as the Samaritan, the Syriack,
and the other Oriental Tongues: As if the proper significancy of her words
could not be rightly understood, but by their Sense, and Etymologies, and
Phrasiologies, whereby he carries the Reader off from the Word of God (which
yet he does undertake to translate, interpret and apply) unto the Authorities
and Histories of Philosophizing men, and the Opinions and Customs of Nations;
that from these, and not so much from that, we might fetch our knowledge of
these Creatures. A cognation of other Languages to, and a collating of them
with the Original Hebrew, has its great use, and may be put to a more growing
and profitable improvement; only special heed must be taken, that they be all
drawn to side with the Hebrew, but not to put the Hebrew violently by force to
be of their party against its own natural meaning. In whatsoever Author you
meet this disconsonancy to the Scriptures, that would bring an alien sense to
the Scriptures, and does not receive a genuine meaning from the Scriptures,
look upon it as one great cause of error; these appositions and additaments
from men are detractions and substractions from the Word. Let the Learned, in
all their studious artificial Expatiations, and liberal scientifick walks in
these Fields of Nature, gather and bring in as much of choice created
Excellencies as they can, whereby to contribute to the augment, of this Art,
and the perfecting of this Science; only let this be learned by reading in
Scriptures Book, and in Natures School. For the rectifying of some common
Philosophical mistakes, let us by an inquiring Spirit, make a deeper research
into the Scriptures about this question. Genesis 1. 20.
The creeping living Creatures were not formed out of the Waters, as their
Pre-existent matter; for they were, and are distinct Creatures from the Waters,
of a different make and kind. This does but set out the manner of after
productions in the watery places. They have been some of the generally received
mistakes, that ^here was a common pre-existent Matter of the whole Creation:
That Matter and Motion are the Essences of things: That the four Elements are
the Original causes of things, which have a mixtion of Elements in them: That
beaten axiom of Ethnic Philosophy, that of nothing it is impossible any thing
should come, as if therefore there were a necessity of fore-existent matter to
work upon, because the ordinary course of Nature is now so, does discover in
the assertors thereof their ignorance of the Scriptures. For although out of
absolute Nothing, Nothing can be extracted, converted, or made to be, yet that
does not necessarily infer that therefore there must be a first Matter, and a
Potency thereof to be the common Principle of all material things; for Almighty
Power can create that unto a Being, which had no Being before. That Ethnic
Rationalist who maintained and defended this corrupt Tenet, did reject all
matters of Faith, not only Humane, but Divine also, and examined all things
only by his own Reason, whose Writings therefore can afford no true, good
Commentary upon Genesis 1. 1. Psalm. 33. 9. Romans 4. 17. Heb. 11. 3.
Scripture, which does not at all speak of any such pre-existent Matter. The
Scriptures of Truth do not assert any such prime confused Chaos, out of which
afterward all Created Beings should come forth distinct, neither can any man's
Reason evince this to him who does stand in awe under the Authority of God's
Word; was it not altogether as easy to Omnipotency, and more glorious to all
Wisdom, at the first to create the several kinds of all Created Beings,
distinct and perfect, than to frame and to form them afterward of matter made
before hand? is it not against the dictates of Natural Reason and Light, that
such a pretended first Matter should subsist separate by it self, and there
rest a while under some common and general Form, yet so as withal to have in it
such a multitude of specifical Forms of Natural Beings, and after-created
Essences, of all future Bodies, not distinct, but in a confused lump, and
mingled heap, all jumbled together one with another? God is not the author of
confusion: and how can a rational Intellect understand that any one common Form
could make specifically distinct Forms out of such a fancied first matter of
corporal things? The internal Forms of created Beings is that primitive force
and original Nature, which Aelohim did speak into, and fasten in the several
kinds of created Beings on the several days of the first Weak, according to the
particular Essence and specific Being, and different condition of every thing,
whereby they are some ways disposed and fitted, strengthened and enabled, to put
forth their proper virtues, and their special operations, by the exercise of
which natural powers, they were orderly to move toward the right end in
subserviency under and conformity, to the will of their Maker, which was their
goodness and their perfection. The Creatures could not cause themselves to be
from Not-being; neither was natural Generation the first Original of these
Creatures, but Creation, or creating Causality, or primitive and proper
Creation: Neither were their created Potentialities latent in a first Chaos,
produced into their Actualities on the six days, but all and every of the
Creatures were immediate distinct Works of Aelohim's Power. He created in every
one of the six days. Any created Original or primary Womb, out of which other
Creatures were extracted; or the material stuff whereof all things were framed,
which one Ethnic Philosopher calls the first Matter, as the Potential
Principle of all: Another names it Hyle, a darkness somewhat invisible and
without Form: A third intitles it, a fearful Shadow; A fourth makes it a
symbolical Unity; A fifth does style it a deformed Chaos, or universal troubled
Mass, without form or shape: These and such like fancied Images of Humane
Invention have no firm footing in Scripture. All and every of the Works of the
foregoing six days of the Week are proper Creatures, each of them were new
Creatures of distinct Essence or Entities: There were no former Phenomenon, or
appearance of them. Had there been any such one universal Body of Matter, or
Corpse of the World, and an universal created spirit, as the soul of the World;
then all had been perfected in one day, both the whole Body, and the whole
Spirit of the Universal World of Creatures; and all this had been one
Individuum, Physically, Really, Naturally. Not only was the first Creation in
one day by the supernatural Power of Aelohim, as if the after productions were
by the Power of instituted Nature, or application of Art: But also, all the
Created Beings on the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth days; which were
then Essences, when they were Existences, and not Essences in Potentiality on
the one day, and Existences in Actuality on the other days, as if only
productions out of a former Essence. (If the Reader do observe any Phrases or
Lines in this Treatise, word for word in other Authors, let him know, that
these Collections were made some years go, when the Author made use of some
Books, as he could then be suffered to come at them; which Books he had not
then by him, when he first framed this Treatise; neither does he readily know
whither to go for the finding out of those citations or transcribings, now that
he has most of these Books by him. Sometimes he uses their own words, where
he apprehends the writers mind and expressions to be according to the Word,
and in several places he confutes their mistakes by the Original Text. Let the
grand design be promoted of advancing of useful Knowledges, and personal
reflections be laid aside.) The Creatures were of several kinds, and being
Heterogeneous one from another; they must consequently all of them be also
Heterogeneous from the pretended pure primary Matter: For this Matter being
supposed by the Asserters of it to be one Homogeneous Substance in it self, can
never produce so many Heterogeneous Substances. If the very Matter of Creatures
were one and the same substantial principle in all Creatures, and not
different, how could it produce contrary Entities, and Activities, and exercise
contrary Operations? Heb. 11. 3.
The Word of Truth does expressly confirm, that the things which we see were not
made of such things as do appear: And we have need and use of special Faith to
believe, and to improve this aright: Genesis 1. throughout.
As that the Heavens and the Earth, were not this first general confused
matter, out of which after Creatures were made, the Expanse was not made of the
more refined part of this; the Herbs, Plants and Trees were not made out of the
Earthy Matter; the Luminaries were not made of the former Light; Fishes, Fowls,
Beasts, Worms, were not made of the Waters or Earth; the first Adams Male and
Female were not made of former Earth: These Genesis 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, (...).
were after Generations and Productions in the ordinary way, yet of the same
kind, and it is a new Prooem beginning a new Narration. Isai. 40. 13. 1 Cor. 8.
5, 6.
Aelohim did not need as men do, Stuff or matter to work upon, not Tools or
other Instruments, neither used he the aid or help of any assistant. It is by
Faith that we come to have right apprehensions of this; it is not wrought and
attained by the strength of our natural reason, but it does shine in upon the
mind from that credibility which is in, and from that credence, which is given
to the Word of God, and from the holy Spirits persuading of the heart that this
word is the Truth: Thus were all manner of Creatures fully and perfectly
finished without any want, defect, or imperfection in them, so far as concerned
that state and condition the Creator made them in: The Author or Efficient was
Jehovah Aelohim; the means of creating them was by the word of his Power,
whereby he manifested his Mind and Will: Though all these were created and
made, yet not out of any thing that did or could appear; there was no
pre-existent matter whereof they were made. The Essences and formalities of all
Vegetative and Sensitive Natures, are not only matter and motion: Aelohim gave
primitive Natures, and different Beings to his several Creatures. Universal
Nature is both an empty name, and an atheistical conceit. If only matter were
created in the first instance of Time, as is pretended and pleaded, how could
this Matter diversifie it self in the Beginning into Heaven and Earth? For
local Motion, being from one place to another, which are several distant Terms,
must necessarily be in several instants of Time; if several Local Motions were
the Formalities, or formal beginnings of all Spirits and spiritual Qualities,
then they should not be before, nor after, nor any longer than that Local
Motion does continue. For the Formality of any thing is the very Specific
Being thereof, and nothing can be without the Specifical Being of its self,
otherwise it should not be what it is, or be what it is not. It was Genesis 1. 2.
Psalm. 33. 6. Job 26. 13.
the Spirit of Aelohim, and not the first Matter, that moved more especially
upon the waters. Created Beings may and actually do exist without any actual
Local Motion; and therefore they must necessarily, really be different from it.
The Beginning of all things was not Water; as one Ethnic Philosopher mis
judged: neither was infinite Air the first cause or original of every
existence, as another affirmed: neither was this pretended Catholic Air, God,
as a third esteemed: neither did all things take their beginning from Fire and
Light, as a fourth would have it, nor as another says, that there is one
Universal Fire in and over all things in this World: neither is the beginning
of all things the substance of the Fire by the Air converted into Water, as was
the opinion of one: neither are there such Radical Principles of all things,
whereof two are Agents, and two Patients, as he asserts the Elements, which was
the imagination of another. Creating AElohim was before any created Beings;
Act. 17. 24. Genesis 2. 1, 4. Heb. 21. 3. Romans 1. 20. 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6.
He alone was the Creator: All things were made essentially, solely,
immediately by him, there was no help of secondary causes. They had their
Original and Being from him; and they have still their dependence upon him: and
therefore is Genesis 1. throughout, and Chapter 2. 1, 2, 3.
AElohim in this short, yet complete History of the Creation expressly named
above thirty times in the seven days of this one Week. No mere Creature has
Power of Creating. It is Nehem. 9. 6. Isai. 44. 24. Eccles. 12. 1. Romans 1. 24.
1 Pet. 4. 19. Jer. 10. 10, 11, 12.
the sole Prerogative of Jehovah AEtohim. If created Beings, and their
substantial Spirits, and all their spiritual Activities and Operations were
only various Motions of the Matter, or only Matter moving variously, then Local
Motion, one way or other, or any way whatsoever should be not only an
instrumental causality or effect of these Bodies, and their Qualities; but also
the very Essence and Formality, as has been said, or formal cause of them.
Whereas, all created Beings are formal every one of them, such as they were
severally created in their different kinds, and as they are naturally
distinguished from other Creatures in themselves in their own proper Being. The
Creatures may, and several of them do exist, and they are such as they are
created, without any actual Motion, being more for rest. Genesis 1. 2, 6, 7, 8.
As the blew expanse, and the Earth; T^hu and Bohu Genesis 1. 2.
were not Matter and Form. The Jews and the Christians have learned this wrong
conceit in the Schools of Ethnic Philosophers, and then afterward labored to
defend it by this place of Scripture. I have on the work of the one day shown
the meaning of those words and things. The four Elements, as some name them,
called the simple Bodies; were not fetched, one contrary out of another, as out
of former Matter, as neither Light out of Darkness, nor the Firmament out of
Emptiness, nor dry Earth out of Waters. Neither were the compound Bodies out of
the same Elements, nor for the most part of all, four unequally mingled
together. Not every one principally out of the same Element, which they garnish
or inhabit: As not Herbs and Trees out of the Earth: Not the Sun, Moon and
Stars, wholly or specially out of the Expanse: Not Fishes out of the Waters,
not Birds out of the Air, not Beasts out of the Earth; all and every of the
created Beings are of distinct Natures, and of several kinds. We must put a
difference between the first Creation, and the after propagation. Those four
great Bodies, Ether, Air, Earth and Water, are still locally and essentially
separate one from another, and do exist Pure: They each of them have their
proper Bodies of Matter, their peculiar subsistences, pure and unmixed in the
beginning of the Creation. The several Creatures were created an Whole and
Entire several Substance and Quality, Matter and Form, as they call them, all
and every of them on the several days of their being created; at least this is
very well worthy of a more through inquiry and deeper disquisition than
hitherto has been made: I return now to the particular created Beings on the
fifth day. Genesis 1. 20. Nephesh, In Hebrew has its significancy of soul, from
breathing, and it is applied not only to mankind, but to all Creatures that do
live and breath, there is a Power and force in thi^s breathing soul which makes
the Creature to live, Rev. 8. 9. Creatures in the Sea, there (...), which
having breathing soul.
Fishes do breath in and out, though Ethnic Philosophy do contradict. For,
Fishes are some of the Reptils, which have a living Soul, a vital Spirit,
breathing to and fro. The swimming of Fishes is one kind of creeping and
sliding. So an Eel swims in the Water, as a Snake does creep on the Land. And
though other Fishes in swimming do shoot forth more directly, and do not
altogether make such crooked in and out lines, yet they only slide in a
streighter manner, having bodies of a direct and oblong Figure fitted for that
purpose, being born up, and partly carried by an Equidans fulciment of
transpassable Waters, through which they move by a Breathing Vital Potenty.
Genesis 1. 20, 21.
The flying Fowl was not made of the pre-existent Matter of Waters, as some
learned Christians, some whom they call the Fathers, and others did
misapprehend, but were a distinct Creature both from Waters and Reptils, from
Fishes, from what else does live in the Waters. This is a new production in a
certain and different place. The precedent Atha^h.
Hebrew Accent did absolve the former Paragraph, from which this is
distinguished both grammatically in sense and distinction; and also physically
in being and in place. Gnuph.
The one word is as proper to Birds, as Sheret^.
the other is to Reptils. They were neither of the same make with Fishes,
neither were Fishes created of Water, nor Fowls of Earth; but immediately of
the adored Almighties, severally put into their proper natural places; the
Fishes into swimming in the Sea, the Fowls into the Air over the Earth, flying
there. Some flying Fowls do more delight in watery places; others of them are
more for Earth, as the place of their choice; some others are Terraqueous,
being well pleased both with Earth and Water, as a place either of them proper,
and fit enough for them: So that, this does but set out their places, not the
first Matter of their being, and how it would be in their after production,
distinguished into Land-fowls, Sea-fowls, and Sea land-fowls, Amphibious Ones,
such as do live and generate in both. The Creator does assign his Creatures
their proper localities and places of abode, as before he had put the
Luminaries in the Heavens and Expanse; so here the Fishes to the Waters, the
Fowls to the Air, and so afterward other Creatures to the Earth. The appointed
places of Habitation, of Motion, and of Working, are proper and natural, and
the Bodies of created Beings have a suitable conformity fitting them for their
several abode. The Creator first finished the Theater or Habitacle of the
World, and then Creates the Inhabitants thereof, and puts them into their
several dwellings and mansions. Time and Place were some of the first things
created: they are therefore to be accounted great things, being the foundation
of many after-institutions. Mar. 13. 19. 2 Pet. 3*4. Heb. 1. 10. out of Psalm.
102. 25. Mar. 19. 4. Mar. 10. 6.
The Creature had a beginning when it was created, Time then began. This World
was not from all Eternity; for it had a beginning in Time. One part of the
Created World was after another part of it, by temporary succession of nights,
and of days in a most direct line by established Order, and immutable Law. The
first beginning of Time, was not the moment or measure of the first Heavenly
Motion. They are mistakes, the supposal of the first moveable Heaven, or
compassing Sphere that does wheel about all the other pretended Spheres; and
that this first Mover was first created; which have no foundation in Scripture,
but are the feigned inventions of men high in their own eyes, and fond of their
own conceits. The first moment of the first created Evening, was the beginning
of Time, as to the created World, when the Darkness was first made to begin.
Time is not the measure of duration, according to a pretended Motion of the
Heavenly Luminous Bodies, for three several days were past before the Creation
of these. Time, Place and Number, are of the Nature of indifferent things that
may be, or may not be, but are necessarily things in their several
circumstances. These were concreated, and did actually exist with other created
beings in the beginning, and without which no created Entity whatsoever can
actually exist. There was in the one day of the World successive Duration,
every Creature that was made on that day was durable temporary, made and
existed in time: There was consistent extension, one part beyond another, there
where another part was not. All the created Beings of that day exist in some
places. They were where they were made, and no where else at that same time,
and several Creatures were in several places, then and afterward: There was
then discrete numbering; for every created Being, whatsoever it be, must always
be numerable. The several distinct days also, in which the Creatures were made,
are distinct in Numeration. Thus for Family or Churchworship, once every day is
not enough, but twice a day is necessary, Aelohim having instituted the Evening
and Morning Seasons, and not lest this to our liberty or appointment. There is
an aptitude in Nature for these; fitting the time to the Work. Thus for more
public Church Assemblies, once in a Month, or Quarter, or Year, is not enough,
it must be weekly on the seventhday-Sabbath; for so is the Doctrine of Weeks in
the first Creation. Those who are engaged in the Controversy about
Nonconformity unto Matthew. 15. 9, 13. Mar. 7. 1 -- 13. Tit. 1. 14.
national Plantations or establishments in the matters of public Worship, such
as is of Humane Invention, Institution and Imposition, especially when
exclusive of all other Worship that is according to the Word-Warrant, and
Scripture-Institution, have greatly wronged and hurt their own cause, by their
concessions and assertions, that the Civil Magistrate has the Power in the
Nation to appoint humanely-invented Modes of Worship, what forms to use. The
number in Worship, how often it shall be, what holy days as they call them, and
how many of them in an year; the time of worship, when his will and pleasure
is; and the place of worship, where he will assign. As if these were
Adiaphorous matters, left wholly to our Governors prudential consideration and
determination, which all subjects must comply with, and conform to, that there
may be, as they say, Order, Unity and Peace in the Church, by a national
uniformity in these things: For, under a color of this, all the Christian
Religion almost is degenerated into indifferents, and those who are most and
best Christians, most spiritual and heavenly in worship, according to the Laws
and Institutions of Christ's house, and who have their conversation most
adorning and becoming the Gospel, are most hated and opposed; this being the
ground of persecution in all ages, but more toward the latter days, as the
servants of, and witnesses for Christ, do bring in and finish their Testimony
against all Revel. 42. last.
Antichristian, and Anti-Scriptural Usurpations, not in any tumultuous way of
rebellious insurrection, but by a patient suffering, and quiet bearing. All
things whatsoever in the matters of Worship are determined by the LORD, and
men's prudence does consist in this, not in prescribing to their fellow
Creatures, Time, Place and Number, but in finding out, and in observing, what
of every one of these the Sovereign only Lawgiver has decided and stated.
Those who have a delegated Authority, under Christ over others, should use and
exercise their power to enforce Christ's Laws and Orders, and to make
constitutions of their own against or beside the Word. Every action of rational
Creatures, especially in the matters of Worship, take it in all its
circumstances, is, when done, Eccles. 12. last ^ Cor. 5. 10.
either well or ill done, it is either sin or duty; these two do decide all. O
who will give* that Superiors would revive the Law of the ten Words, as the
one and only rule of Faith, Worship and Life, as to all duties to be performed,
and as to all sins to be forborne! Upon which Law the rest of the Scriptures is
the one and the only Lawgivers own Commentary, judging of all cases according
to this, whereby either to approve, acquit, and justify what is an holy
conformity to it, or to reprove and condemn whatsoever is a transgression of
it! and that the Judicial Laws, which are perfectly exact, holy, just and good,
might be the Rule of procedure in all Courts of Justice, for the distributing
of due rewards to the obedient, and for the executing of just sentences upon
offenders! 1 Cor. 1 4. last.
Natural Decency, and Scripture Order, have determined, do and will determine,
all Cases of Worship, for Time, Place and Number. To open somewhat more yet
about the Works of the fifth day, contrary to vain deceitful Philosophy. The
Tunies, the Dragons, or Whales, were not made of fore-being Waters, but were

created into their own Existences without previous matter, out of which to
make and form them. There was not force nor power in the Waters to bring these
Creatures forth, which also does prove, that the rest of the like kind had
their Existence, and being by the immediate creating Word of Aelohim: Unto all
Shoretzim.
the creeping living Creatures ought this Word, Baraa.
created to be referred: which word is absolutely used in this place, and is
not so restrained to the particular matter of some one of these kinds only. The
end of applying it here being, to set out Aelohim's mighty Power in Creating
Jo^ 40. 15 -- 24. and 41. throughout Jo^. 1. last and chapter 2. verse. 1, 10.
some of the greatest and wonderfullest living Creatures, with his bare Word.
That fruitfulness Genesis 1. 22, 28.
which Fishes, Fowls, Beasts, Creeping things (which are Heterogeneous in their
kinds, severally differing one from another) in propagating of their kinds, in
that way in which Aelohim has appointed, as also to any other Creatures, whose
kinds are preserved and multiplied by Generation and Increase, by Propagation
and F^tification, Fecundity and abundance, it is a Blessing, his Blessing to
his Creatures. It should be well and distinctly observed, that the Blessing
here particularly promised to these Creatures, Be ye fruitful, etc. is a word
drawn from the Fruit of Trees, mentioned before in the third days Work, in this
History of the Creation, which does evidence, that the fruitfulness of Trees,
is Aelohim's blessing upon the Trees. It is his Benediction that does give unto
his Creatures a Physical or Natural Power of Procreating to it self its like,
which yet it cannot exert, or put forth, or cause to attain its end, without
his Power, and Blessing, and Faithfulness, to whom and to which those
especially who are Christians, and Believers should ascribe and give all the
Honor and Glory, not to mere Nature or Natural Causality, as some of those
have done, who would be counted high Rationalists in Ethnic Philosophy. It is
further Genesis 1. ^1.
observable here, that a Prophecy of what shall be hereafter, does sometimes
speak in the past time, to denote the certainty of fulfilling. As these Waters
where the crawling tredders with lift-up-creeping feet are placed, are said to
have movingly brought forth in great abundance to their shaped conditions of
distinguished kinds; Aelohim's Decree and Purpose in his own Mind and Will, and
his Promise and Blessing in his Word, resolved and covenanted, that so it
should be. Scripture History has this besides many other Prerogatives over
Humane Stories, that the Record and Narrative may be before, as well as after
the matter of Fact: From whence I would commend it to the consideration of the
learned in the Hebrew, and of the skilful in the Scriptures, whether Vau.
that copulative particle, which does signify, and should not every where, in
the word of Jehovah Aelohim, be rendered with its adjoined future, futurely, and
with its appointed Praeterit, preteritly, in the Translation, leaving the
Interpreter, Opener, and Applyer of the Word, to give forth to others what he
judges to be the true proper genuine meaning of those words in themselves, and
in construction with other words in the Text and Context, and other collated
Scriptures? There are many exceeding great and precious Promises quite lost to
our vulgar Readers and Hearers, who as yet do not understand the force and
significancy of the Hebrew Language. Look we a little into this History of the
Creation: Genesis 1 3. Jeh^. Va^^^i.
when the adored Almighties did create the Light, it runs thus: He will
actually say (by declared foretelling, and express appointing) it shall be
truly subsisting the Light; Aelohim's saying is doing, his word is a work, his
speaking is his acting: It does denote his efficacious Decree concerning his
Creatures, and the execution of that Decree expressed by speaking of suitable
words. Thus the appellation of the Gen.* 5, 8, 10.
Names put upon the Creatures by their Creator, do note this Decree and
Constitution, that so they should be called by men. Thus also his Benediction
of his Creatures is a real Procreation, Multiplication of them in their proper
kinds. It makes it also further conspicuous, that Psalm. 107. 20. and 147 15,
18. Heb. 1. 3. Joh. 5. 17.
his Word of Power, and of Promise, is that which does still conserve his
Creatures, as it did create them. This is one great Reason why, Joh. 1. 1, 2,
3, 10, 14. 18.
the Word, is one of Christ's Names, because the manifestation of his Fathers
decreeing and speaking about Creation and Redemption is made out significantly,
and held forth expressly by Christ. When David says in 2 Samuel 7. 21. Compared
with 1 Chronicles. 17 9.
one place, For thy words sake, another records his speech, For thy servants
sake, which does evidently prove that David's meaning was, for thy Christ's
sake; for Christ is Rev. 19. 13. and Matthew. 12. 18 -- 21. out of Isai. 42. ^,
etc.
both the Word, and the servant of Aelohim. Now this Scripture does, as many
others, run in a way of Prophesying; foretelling, that there should be light in
its after-seasons. The whole Scripture is therefore called the whole 2 Pet. 1.
20, 21.
Prophecy of Scripture. Jehovah sets himself out, as he who Isai. 45. 7.
forming the Lights. It denotes a continuedness of the Act in the successive
courses of the Light, and this is a way of his fulfilling of that first Promise
of his; and believers should enjoy it as a Covenant Mercy; when ever our eyes
do behold the Light, we may see there are more substances, and fewer accidents
(as they name them) than Ethnic Philosophers do own: What was the first
created Light according to their own descriptions? Was it not an Entity of
Nature? Did it not truly subsist? Does not the Genesis 1. 3.
Scripture affirm this? Did it not subsist in it self? What substance did this
Light naturally flow from, or originally subsist in? Did it spring from Heaven,
or from Earth, or from Waters? Or from the gulphy space, or doleful place? The
Expanse was not created till the Seventh-day: As for the Air, neither was that
extended, expanded, or made so diaphanous, or created on the one day: And as
for the Heavenly Luminaries they had not a Being till the fourth day: If you
imagine it to be inherent in the highest Heavens, and transmitted thence; why
then is not the Light always sent forth, to make it continual day? What
substance was the Light adventitious to, in its first being created? Was not
the specificial Essence thereof in it self? What other substance did the Light
affect or perfect? Was not the Light an actual Entity, specifically differing
from all other created Beings, in the Time and Nature of it? This Light is a
stated, solid, substantial Entity, always actual since its first Creation,
without continual sensible variations: The Light has corporeal quantity of
extension, and corporeal Motion in coming and in going. What was that pretended
lucid Body, in which this Light is supposed to be inherent, to which to adhere,
and in which as in a Subject to be? It is an essential and substantial
Creature, in its own Nature and Being, which Aelohim gave unto it. The Light
was not gathered into the Sun, not placed in the body of the Sun, not affixed
unto the Sun, not sent into, and inserted in it after its Being diffused and
shed abroad, not bound to any certain body. the Light does cast no shadow,
because it does surround Bodies, whereas the Sun does cast shadows, because its
shining is in direct Beams. It is a real thing, and not only a notion: all and
every of the created Beings are truly subsisting Entities. This created Light
was not Christ: though in another sense Christ is called Light. For somewhat
was created before the Light, as the Heavens, the Earth, the Waters, the empty
space, the doleful place and darkness; whereas Christ is the Rev. 3. 14. Prove.
8. 22, 31. Coloss. 1. 15, 16.
beginning of the Works of Aelohim, he was before all created Beings. For a
close of this fifth days Work, I apprehend the creating of the Beasts and
Worms to appertain to the fifth day for several weighty Reasons agreeing with
the Word. All those Creature are here put together. Such as have a sensitive
Soul and Life: So nobly formed a Creatures as Man, who was to have the Royal
Genesis 1. 24. 25 -- 2^.
Dominion over these sensitive Creatures, and was endued with a Religious
Rational Soul and Life, he had the honor of a distinct day, the sixth day, for
his Creation, apart from other Creatures. The cause why it is said twice, that
Aelohim will foreseeingly look on because good, what he created on the fifth
day, may be this: there does appear some need of such a subdivision, because
there were two such diverse kinds of Creatures made on that day: Some in the
place of the Waters, the other in the place of the red Earth, the goodness of
both, and of each of which, does the more clearly shine forth, and is the
better understood by this Spiritual Narration of doubling the Testimony. There
is a special Blessing given to Religious, Rational Adam, distinct from Bruit
Animals. Observe well also this further Reason, here is a distinct Creature
from tame Animals, and wild Beasts particularly mentioned, the creeping one,
Remes, Genesis 1* 24, 35.
the Reptil; a word which was mentioned before in the Genesis 1. 21. Haromeseth.
Participle concerning the Fishes, and therefore this kind of Creature must be
created on the same day of the week, on which the Fishes its Fellow-creepers,
were; and so also the other mentioned here, as the tame Animal, and the wild
Beast: Thus also I judge, that the gathering together of the lower Waters from
other places, with expecting desire into the Seas, as its appointed place, did
belong to the Creation-work of the second day: because to every one of the six
days of this one week of the Creation this is expressly ascribed, that Aelohim
will foreseeingly look on, because good; whereas, if this be carried on to the
third day, then the second day will be left without this approving Testimony
from its Creator. Further they are much a part of the same subject matter,
spoken of in the second days Work, which was, that these Waters below might
have a distinct place, from those Waters above by an out-spread partition
between them. They were both of them Waters. This Work about the severing of
the Waters was begun upon the second day, and there finished on the second day.
For, as a wise good Worker, Aelohim reserves the approbation till he had
perfected that Work, and put it in its proper place, so discharged, as it were,
his hands of it, as to what concerned the Creation of it, though as to its
continued preservation, it be still in his manutenancy. How large and complete
an History of the Fishes, of Fowls, of Beasts, and of Worms, might there be
composed and compiled for the perfecting of this Art, and the polishing of the
Science of Sensitive Souliness, if all those Words and Phrases were orderly
put together, that do treat of this subject matter in the Scriptures of Truth!

The Genesis 1. 26* 31.
Sixth Day, toward the true Advance of useful Learning, does give us the hint
of this profitable Inquiry.
Q. Whether Anthropology, or the Doctrine of Created Adam, or knowledge of Man,
or the Science of the Humane Nature, be sufficiently taught in the Schools and
Lectures of Ethnic Philosophers? Or, is it only contained in, and augmentable,
and restaurable by, the Word of Truth, and the holy Spirits teaching of serious
Inquirers this Art according to these Holy Scriptures?

Answ.

IT is not by Ethnic Philosophy, and the Readers or VVriters of it, but by the
Scriptures of Truth, and the holy Spirits instructing in and by these. Man!
what is this man, that the Creator has so crowned him with so signal an Honor!
Man, how noble is his make! Man is the Articulate Trumpeter of the Creators
Praises, the lingual Glory of the World, sounding forth the shining
excellencies of Jehovah Aelohim in his glorious self, in his good Word, and in
his great Works! How useful a Knowledge is this, the true Knowledge of our
selves! What profit would it be to me, and to the Reader, though we understood
all other Mysteries, and all other Knowledges, if thou and I were ignorant of
our selves! How Royal Prerogatives has the LORD dignified Man withal! Unto how
high a pitch has he raised the ultim summities of the Humane Nature in all its
created Perfections of Spirit, of Soul, and of Body! How full of admirable
Wonders is this! How rare its accomplishments! How virtuous its Powers, both
in the inner and outer Man! How mysterious are the Communications of the
several parts in Man to each other! How secret their Operations upon each
other! How fearfully, how marvellously was this Man made! Genesis 1. 26.
Aelohim did attribute the special making of Man immediately, and expressly to
himself, to set out the dignity and excellency of Man, and to assert the Truth,
Reality and Certainty, of the History of Adam, against those who dreamingly
fancy other Origins of the World. Man was not from Eternity, but was made in
Time. Man was not compounded at his first Creation of the four pre-existent
Elements of Water, Earth, Air and Fire, as some affirm, nor of Salt, Sulphur
and Mercury, as others assert; but is a distinct Creature of a quite different
kind, from other of his fellow Creatures, particularly from Beasts: So that, we
may not with some credulous admirers of Bruits to the disparagement of our
selves, and the reproach of all Humane Nature, adopt Bruits into the Family of
Mankind, and as one does express it, claim kindred of Apes, Baboons, Marmosets,
Drils, Bestial Fauns and Satyrs, as if they were but one degree removed from
our selves. Aelohim did not consult with other Creatures about the Make of Man;
neither were Angels co-workers with him in this. That, he created Adam a Man,
and not a Beast, was merely the Grace and Beneficence of the Creator: It was
not the Work of Nature, nor the influencing Operation of the Stars. Man's
Industry and Art contributed nothing toward the creating of the World; For,
Man had his being one of the last of all the Creatures. How exactly was this
man made at the first? Genesis 1. 26. 27.
according to the Primitive Pattern, Exemplar, Type and Model, coming very near
unto it! In Adam man may acknowledge, that self same Archetype, unto whose
Effigies, or Shape, or Figure, or Likeness, or Fashion, he was made. This does
more denote the quality of resemblance, which did follow upon the former
portraicture, resemblance, formed shape, or expressed representation. How
glorious, how comely, how uniform, was that appearance of Majesty, which did
shine forth in Adams inner and outer Man, wherein he differs from the lower
Creatures, and is made like unto his Maker, Phil 2. ^ -- 8. Heb. 1. 2, 3. Col.
1. 15. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Ephesians. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10.
resembling Aelohim, as he manifested himself to be seen in those Visions which
are recorded in the Scriptures: very much like unto the LORD Jesus Christ
himself, chiefly in Holiness and in Righteousness! Man is called the Image of
Aelohim, because he is like to Aelohim: and he is like Aelohim, because he was
efformed in creation to Aelohim's likeness, as to his Nature, Rectitude and
State; the Image of Aelohim does carry with it the very likeness to him.
Tzelem, and Demouth, Genesis 1. 26, 27.
There are two words, which as to their grammatical distinction do spring from
two distinct Roots: Otherwise they well agree, to set out man's excellent
resemblance of his Maker, as the Etymology of both the words does show. Genesis 1.
26, 27. and 5. 1. and 9. 6. 1 Corin. 15. 49. Ephesians. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10. Jam. 3.
9, Romans 12 1, 2, 3.
Image is sometimes referred to Grace, no less than likeness: As likeness is
also to Nature. To reconcile all differences about this, I judge, that these
two words do set out the exact proportionable resemblance of created Adam unto
Creating Aelohim in Christ, both in the inward make, and outward shape, in the
whole Man, as Christ did often appear of old in the Old Testament, as a Man to
aspire and confirm his peoples Faith, that in the appointed time he would take
to his Godhead the Nature of Man by a wonderful Incarnation, born of a Virgin,
and be God manifest in the Flesh. It is one of the most alike Images that is,
coming the nearest of any to the Prototype. So that here is no Pleonasm or
Tautology, but a comprehensive significancy, and a full sense, expressed in two
words. Man in his Spirit, Soul and Body, in his whole suppositum, the entire
Man is every way like his Maker, so far as Man's created Capacities were. For
there is somewhat in Jehovah Aelohim, which is incommunicable to mere Man, as
particularly infiniteness, and self existency, unchangeableness of holy Nature:
which last, I desire may pass under further disquisition, whether
unchangeableness of holy Nature be not one part of Holiness comprehended in the
perfect Law of the ten Words, which Adam in his Uprightness, and the blessed
Angels in their Purity, being but mere Creatures, were not capable of? If so,
then whether this would not discover the need and use, that even the Elect
Angels themselves have of Christ (though they do not so need him, as now
fallen, sinning, sinful man does need him)? in regard, that although they have
an unchangeableness of State, yet not of Nature: For, some of their fellows do
fall by transgression: and the standing, and the safety of those of them, who
remain in the Primitive Integrity and Happiness, is not their perfection in
Grace, but their relation unto Christ their Head. And the same will hold true
also with respect to the glorified Saints in Heaven, Elect Men and Women; their
continued felicity will not be solely in themselves, even when they pass into
an unsinning State, a State of complete Purity and Bliss; but, as they are
living Members of the Mystical Body of Christ. There is somewhat peculiar in
this Image, wherein man is like unto his creating Mediator, so as other
Creatures are not. Though man were created in the Image, according to the
likeness of Aelohim in Christ, yet is not mere man to be adored, or to be
worshipped; Aelohim himself alone has Deuteronomy. 6. 13. and 10. 20. Matthew. 4. 10.
Luke 4. 8. comparod.
adorability properly belonging to him. The Woman as well as the Man did share
in this holy happy Image and likeness. The Name, Genesis 1. 27. Mar. 16, 15. Col.
1. 23.
Creature, is more especially given to Adam, as one of the most excelling of
Creatures, because of this resemblance: Ha. Genesis 1. 27. and 2. 11.
The notificative Particle is sometimes put before a proper name. As here in
this part of the History of the Creation, and elsewhere, contrary to the common
Grammar Rule composed by men: Grammar should be fitted to Scripture, and not
Scripture suited to Grammar. The different Sexes, Male and Female, Man and
Woman were created at the first in the Humane Nature by Aelohim. Genesis 2. 21, 22.
That after History of the Woman's being taken from the side of Man, and given
unto him in Marriage by Christ, should also be further inquired into, whether
it were not distinct and different, both in Nature and in Time, from the first
Creation of the Man, and of the Woman? The Woman was of distinct Creation by
Aelohim as well as the Man; and when the 1 Timothy 2. 13.
Man was created, for this is not by Anticipation; both of them were made, not
out of any pre-existent matter, though in Christ Jesus Gal. 3. 28.
there be not Male and Female: but they are esteemed both one in him, in the
matters of Justification, Sanctification, Acceptance and Redemption, the one
sharing in these benefits as well as the other. The Man and the Woman were
created several distinct persons. We have read, that he who made them from the
beginning made them, (that is, the first married Couple) Adam (who was Romans 5.
12 -- 19. 1 Cor. 15. 21.
the Adam, the common Head, and Representative of all Mankind, which proper
name to make him more known, has Ha. Genesis 1. 27. and 4. 1. vehaadam, the same
who was married and united to Chavvah.
a demonstrative notificative Particle before it, I say he made them Adam) and
Eve, one Male and one Female. 1 Cor. 7. 2. See Hutterus's Hebrew on that place.
Every Adam or Aish, is to have his proper Wife, and every Aishah is to have
her proper Husband: In all the New Testament through, Wise in the singular
number is mentioned about fourscore and four times, and always referred to one
Husband in the singular number. A fair occasion being here ministered unto me, I
shall plead the cause of holy Marriage, which is the lawful conjunction of man
and woman into one flesh, against the practisers and defenders of Polygamy, and
of Divorces: Digamy is the having of two Wives, or of two Husbands, at one and
the same time, Polygamy is the having of more Wives, or of more Husbands than
one at once: that, both these are unlawful, I shall prove from the Scripture,
out of the Book of Moses, out of the Book of the Prophets, out of Christ's
recorded sayings, and out of the writings of the Apostles.

The Scripture Record has Genesis 2. 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
very early given us an account of the first Institution of holy Marriage,
which does by diverse weighty Arguments closely condemn Polygamy: For Jehovah
Aelohim did bring and join together but one Adam and one Eve into, and in this
honorable Estate of Marriage; so the LORD Christ himself does interpret Matthew.
19. 4, 5, 6.
this, he who made them from the beginning, made them (one) Male and (one)
Female: What was of old said, they, that is, this Adam, and this Eve, shall be
in one flesh, has an explication added unto it by Christ, they two shall be
into one flesh; they are no more two but one flesh; that expression in Genesis,
they both, or they two, were naked, Christ does refer to the foregoing
sentence, and they two into one flesh; and that it might have the greater
emphasis, or express signification of his earnest intention, whereby a tacit
significancy is couched, and more is signified than one bare word seems to hold
forth, he has added an (...), Illi duo, so the 72 interp^on Genesis 2. (...).
Hieron. uterque so Genesis 3. 7. (...), Hieron. Amborum.
Article, those two, and then does infer, therefore they are no more two but
one flesh: That then which does follow, what God has joined together, do refer
to this, the what, is those two, one man and one woman; but more of that in its
place. One great end in Aelohim's instituting of this Matrimonial Ordinance
was, that man might have (...)
such an united help, as might be a subsidiary aid ready at hand, like as
before him; a singular help of the singular number, such an help as might
coalesce into one with him, such a one as might be always upon all necessary
useful-occasions before him, present, ready at hand, a compeer, a second self,
even and like, every way fitted to all good conjugal purposes; for the
Procreation of Seed, of Issue, of Offspring, one is from one, from those who
are loving partners and companions in one flesh: For the Education of Children
man needs such an help, and who is so fit as the one Wife (who is the Mother)
one with the Husband (who is the Father) in conjugal union, which has going
along with it many powerful Arguments of Love; and for the lessning of sorrows,
and for the doubling of joys, and for the communication of counsels: no
conjunction of Mankind in Nature primigenious can so adaptedly and successfully
promote this, as that which is Matrimonial between two, for here is the closest
and nearest union and conjunction, the sweetest and dearest communion and
fellowship: This Eve was such an help Camohu Rege^do.
as was like Adam himself, and before him; the Hebrew sometimes have such
compositions, where the conjunction is understood; for ^.
the relative of the third person put in the last place, is referrable to both
the words in the composition, belonging to the one and to the other also: Eve
was such an united help as was exactly conformed to Adam's Nature, one who by
her constant love, care, and diligence, by her familiarity, by her bed and
board^ conversation, might be always serviceable, such a well suited Auxiliary,
as that Prove. 31. 11, 12. 2 Cor. 6. 14.
Adam's heart might sweetly acquiesce and safely confide in such an equal
yoke fellow, one that would do him good and not evil all the days of her life;
a yoke is but for two, and those equal ones, especially when they two are in
one: if Eve do prove a draw back, an hinderer, a tempter, she breaks the
primitive Law, of Matrimonial order; Adam should have bewared of forbidden
fruit, when presented to him by the hand of beauteous Eve. By this Matrimonial
conjunction, the Woman was a companion, and assistant, as was not to be divided
from the Man, they were as one flesh (...)
glewed together, infixedly cleaving, it does denote a glutinous juncture;
between two, and two only, must this be, of the same nature and kind, of the
same heart and mind, the same will and affections, differing only in Sex; not
two Eves to one Adam, nor two Adams to one Eve, only one Woman was adjoined to
one Man, and only one Man glewed to one Wife, Beishto, in uxore ejus. The
Hebrew Grammarians call it (...) Adhaesionis, five accessionis. There should be
cohabitation* an Housing together; though they do depart from their Parents yet
they may not thus depart from each other. Genesis 2. 22, 23, 24. and 24. 58, 59.
Ps. 45. 10, 11. Mark 10. 7. 1 Cor. 7. 10, 11, 12. 1 Pet. 3. 17.
in one flesh, by an, In, of adhesion and of accession: the whole speech here
is of two, and of two only, not of more, Adam was to adhere to his Wife, not
his Wives; neither in propriety of word and of phrase, can two Women be fitly
and lawfully adjoined in the same Matrimonial yoke at the same time, to one and
the same Man: how can one Man and more Wives than one, be one flesh? For, the
flesh of one Woman, is not the flesh of another Woman at the same time, how
then can the Man be divided between several Wives? This straitest union cannot
be between more than two, the Husband cannot give and exhibit himself equally,
alike, entirely to all, if at once he have more Wives than one; before the
Matrimonial Covenant, and declared Espousals, the Man and the Woman were two,
and not one, but now that they are lawfully Husband and Wife, they are in the
sense and interpretation of Scripture-Law counted and called one's own Flesh;
Genesis 22. 2, 23, 24.
thus has Aelohim himself conjoined them in marriage, one true Eve, and no
more Women to one Adam. Prove. 18. 22. and 19. 14.
A Wife in the singular number, not Wives in the plural, is a special favor of
and from Jehovah, it is the nearest conjunction: Genesis 2. 24. 1 Cor. 7. 10, 11.
Man and Wife may not depart one from another, by marriage the Woman does
become his Wife, his, and no other Man's, and he is her Husband, hers and no
other Woman's: All other Women whatsoever are in this respect called Prove. 5. 3,
18, 20.
Strangers to him, and so should they all be treated withal, by him as
strangers, no other but only his own and only Wife, must have his conjugal
familiarity and fellowship, Deu. 6. 13. Hi^ shall thou serve. Mat. 4. 10. Luke
4. 8. Him only. So Mark 2. 26. But for the Priests Mat. 12. 4. But for the
Priests, only Romans 5. 1. Justified by Faith. Gal. 2. 16. By Faith exclusively
as to other pretended ways. The singular number is sometimes restrained unto
one only.
such restraints are employed in the old Testament, expressed in the New by the
discretively exclusive particle, only. One Man must adhere to one Wife, being
conjoined with her, without taking any more compeers into his Marriage bed: How
raving and unmortified would Men's lusts be, if they were left to make the
largest Romans 13. 13, 14
provision for their flesh by multiplying of Wives? such an indulging of wanton
sensuality would degenerate rational Animals into bruit Beasts. Voluptuous Arts
have sought to gain some reputation and countenance in this defiling defiled
Age, and they have obtained too far, so that Men's lusts are grown unruly in
licentious courses, modesty and shamefacedness are become a jeer; that, which
sin has made shameful, many now do glory in, a moderate temperance, a seemly
sobriety, a chaste use of the Marriage Bed is now scoffed at, Men will satisfy
the cravings of their itching flesh; and though God in his Word do require them
1 These. 4. 4.
to possess their vessel in Holiness and Honor, yet they will take false an
unbounded, loose, and uncurbed liberty.

This primitive Law in created Nature, was Lev. 18. 18.
afterward revived by the LORD in the hand of Moses in the book of the Law of
Jehovah; where he does expressly prohibit this, with which he does close the
interdicted unlawful marriages; of which when he had given an enumeration of
particulars in several instances, he shuts them up with this, And a Woman, or
Wife, unto her Sister, thou shall not take, to vex, to uncover her nakedness
upon her, in her Life. The Conjunction Copulative, And does prove, that this is
a part of this one entire Law of unlawful incestuous forbidden marriages. A
Woman, or Wife, or a Woman-Wife, For, of such does this Scripture here speak,
such a one, a Man is prohibited to take, who is already the Husband of another
Woman, and this other is still alive; such a Woman unto this Sister he may not
take in marriage, not any other Woman whatsoever, who in a large sense is some
ways a Sister, but especially if in a more strict narrow natural proper sense,
she be a Sister by con^anguinity or by affinity: That, this is much of the
genuine meaning of this place, forbidding the taking and the having of more
Wives, than one at once, the reason here annexed and expressed, which is
assigned as that which does enforce and confirm the prohibition, does show;
seeing, evidently from the Nature of it in it self in its causaulity of
production, it will be found in experience to be Gen 30. 8. 15. 1 Samuel 1. 4, 5,
6, 7. Genesis 16. 4, 5, 6. and 21. 10. Deuteronomy. 21. 15, 16, 17.
a vexing; a vexing to the Wives, when one thinks, that she has too little, and
the other too much of the Husband; a vexing to them, if the one be fruitful and
the other barren, the fruitful Woman will be prone to despise the barren; the
barren is under temptation to envy the fruitful, if they be both fruitful, a
vexing will follow about their children; one of their Wives will imagine, that
the Children of the other Wife are better cared and provided for than hers are;
the stewarding of Family-affairs will pass into vexing, when one of them will
be more Mistress than the other, a vexing unto the Children and Servants, when
they are under cross commands, and when they are more desirous to please and to
serve one Mother or Mistress than the other, which also will be vexing unto the
two Wives: a vexing to the Husband, when he sees such disorders in his Family,
a vexing to him, when he discerns, that his kindness to one of his Wives does
beget jealousy in the other Wife, a vexing to him when they both urge him to
gratify them in that, which he cannot: a vexing to him because of the
troubles, discontents, and differences that hereby are occasioned to his
Relations, and to the several Relations of both his Wives: a vexing also to
those Relations of his and of theirs, upon the account of contrary interests,
who on each side will be leaning more in their judgment and affections to
their own nearer kindred and alliance: who can express the whole of the vexing,
that follows hereupon? and still, the more Wives be taken, the more vexing
will follow thereupon. The first Wife will be provoked to jealousy, judging
that she is deprived of that which is her peculiar right and proper due, and
that, her Husband's superinducing of a second Wife is Treachery and falseness
against the first. The Law of Jehovah* Aelohim must be our Rule in this as in
all other cases: If the contrary practice of some holy Men in Scripture be
objected, their example is no further in any thing to be followed by us, than
as they themselves walked by the Rule of the Word. These Hebrew Interpreters,
and Commentators, who were called Karoei, Scripturarians, such as kept close to
the Scriptures, as opposed to the Talmudists, or Traditionaries, such as set up
Men, and the inventions and Canons of Men in the room of the LORD and of his
Word rule, they have so given forth this to be the sense and meaning of this
forbidding, that the taking of a Woman, or Wife, unto Genesis 26. 31. Exodus 26 3.
Ezekiel. 1. 9, 23. and 3. 13. and 16. 45, 48, 49. Joel 2. 8. Exo. 16. 15. and 32.
27, 29. Esai. 3. 5. and 19. 2. The words Brother and Sister, are in several
Scriptures any other Man, or any other Woman. The name of Sister is sometimes
applied to things which in propriety of speech come not near such a natural
title or consanguineous denomination, so ^ings of a beast in the Hebrew Phrase
are said to touch, ^ Woman to her Sister.
a Sister, is the taking of any other Woman to Wife, the Husband's former
Woman-Wife being still alive; which Interpretation by several other Scriptures
warranted, where the name and word, Sister, is any other Woman (as the name and
word, Brother, is any other Man) and to interprer it otherwise, would offer
violent force to the particular special reason which is here expressed, as one
great cause of this prohibition: For, it would no less afflict, grieve, and vex
the first Wife, if her Husband did marry any other Woman, as if he married his
former Wives natural Sister, and took her to him to be a second Wife: if
Polygamy, or the having of more Wives than one at once, were lawful and there
were no injury done thereby, to the first Wife, by which, vexing might be
caused and contention kindled, then the propinquity, the nearness of the
relation of two Wives to one another, and to one and the same Husband, should
rather beget, increase and confirm love, than beget jealousy and enmity: for
all such hatred and vexing would be causless, were this taking of a second Wife
whilst the former living, lawful: This being provoked to jealousy, and being
put into a vexation, does fall out not only between Genesis 30. 1. 14, 15.
natural Sisters, as Leah and Rachel, but also between those, 1 Samuel 1. 6.
who are not near of kin, as Hannah and Peninnah: As for two natural Sisters,
for them to be married unto one and the same Man, more especially both of the
Sisters living at once, this was forbidden before in those Laws of prohibited
marriage in that place of Levit. 18. 16.
Leviticus: the marriage of the natural Brother's Wife is expressly forbidden;
by an Analogical rule therefore a Woman may not marry her natural Sisters
Husband; so that two Sisters were already forbidden to be married unto one Man,
and therefore Levit. 18. 18.
in this place, it must be a new case which has this new prohibition. In these
prohibitions of such incestuous marriages as were, and are, and will be ever
unlawful to contract, there is no difference between the Masculine and Feminine
Sex; because Levit. 18 7. 8.
in the first special prohibition Marriage of the Daughter with the Father is
expressly forbidden, as much as of the Son with the Mother, whereby the LORD
does declare, that, though in the following prohibitions mention be made what
Males ought not contract with what Females, yet by necessary consequence of
that first prohibition, and by the same Analogy and proportion, the prohibition
is also given to the Female; As it is forbidden to the Man to marry the Sister
of his Father or Mother, Levit. 18. 12, 13, 14.
by the same reason it is forbidden to the Female to marry the Brother of her
Father or Mother, because it is in the same equal degree: which is also further
here confirmed, because the Sister of the Father is equally prohibited as the
Sister of the Mother: thus Lev. 18. 10, 11.
the Daughter of his Son is equally prohibited as the Father, as the Daughter
of his Daughter; there is no difference in this as to the Sex: As the Sister is
prohibited to the Brother: Lev. 18. 9.
by the same rule and reason, the Brother is prohibited to the Sister, of the
whole or the half blood, and whether born in lawful Wedlock, or otherwise: for,
there is equal propinquity; and therefore, Lev. 18. 12, 13.
as the Sister of the Father is prohibited, so the Brother of the Father is
understood to be forbidden. Lev. 18. 18.
Upon the same ground, it is unlawful for one Woman to be married unto two Men
at once, seeing it is unlawful for one Man to be married unto two Wives at
once: and I would know by what new name, these two Wives can call themselves in
this new Relation: for all marriages do bring on new names of new Relations: if
they do call one another Sisters, then it is either only more large as all
Women whatever in that sense are Sisters: thus they were before their Marriage
to one Man, and what new Relation is there contracted by this marriage? if they
call one another Sisters, in a restrained proper sense it is either by
consanguinity or by affinity: by consanguinity it cannot be, for they are not
of the same blood either by the Fathers or by Mothers side, neither is it by
affinity: For neither of them can call the Husband Brother rightly; and yet, if
it were so Lev. 18. 16.
it were unlawful for a Man to marry a Sister by affinity: Two Sisters may not
marry the same, though successively, one of the Sisters being dead, much less
may they marry one and the same Man, whilst both the Sisters are alive.

Does the Scripture give any such new special name of new special Relation unto
such? Whereas unto all lawful marriages it does. In this place of Leviticus,
when the LORD had shown what was not an holy marriage, nor a lawful
conjunction, because, and when it was within the degree of consanguinity, or
affinity, prohibited to contract, for otherwise those who did so, were guilty
of Incest: He then closes these forbodes with one special instance, where
there was not such a Relation of either consanguinity or affinity, and that
was, when a Man having a former Wife living, becomes a Digamist in marrying of
a second Wife, or a Polygamist in marrying of more Wives, which unlawful
marriages are more expressly prohibited to Magistrates, and to Ministers:
Plurality of Wives would render a Magistrate effeminate, a King would be less
apt for the government Deuteronomy. 17. 17. 17. 1 Timothy 3. 2. 12. Tit. 1. 6. 1 Timothy 5.

of public affairs, it would much un-man him, 1 Kings 11. 4. Prove. 31. 1, 3.
Nehem. 13. 26.
it would incline him to luxury, sensuality and Idolatry; Solomon, as wise as
he was, was a sad instance of this brutish folly: When he multiplied Wives
they turned away his heart from Jehovah after other gods, and his heart was not
perfect with the LORD his God. Did not Solomon King of Israel sin by these
things, yet among many Nations was there no King like him, who was beloved of
his God, and God made him King over all Israel: Nevertheless, even him did
outlandish Women cause to sin, though his Mother had better instructed him,
Give not thy strength unto Women, nor thy ways unto that which destroys Kings.

So bad an example would have a malign influence upon the people, to run them
into the same irregular practice, the Subjects would hereby be oppressed by
being over charged to maintain so many Wives and Children united to and
sprouting from the Royal stock. Adam was the first, and greatest King, yet had
he but one Wise at one time, so Noah after Adam, though Heir of the World, yet
had he but one Wife; in both which instances much more could have been
colourably pleaded for the propagation of mankind had the practice been lawful.
And as for a Minister, a Bishop, an Overseer, a Presbyter or Elder, and Deacon,
how much it would unfit him for the wise, faithful, discharge of his function
and office, how much it would blot his Doctrine, how much blemish his Life, how
much disorder his Family, how much corrupt the people, with many other evil
consequences and poysnous effects, he who hears them but named may soon discern
them, whether or no he be forbidden to have any other after that Wife is dead,
let them further consider in Scripture, whose case is more concerned herein,
and who would advance this sort of word Learning. A Diaconess was to be a
Widow, not under threescore years of age, who has been the Wife of one man.
These Laws of prohibited Marriages in Levitiens, and the Rules about them, were
not only for the Israelites under that dispensation of Grace, but were always,
now are, and ever will be, universal and perpetual to all people: Lev. 18. 24,
25, 26, 29, 30.
They are confirmed by the Law of Nature; tran^gressions of them are in the
very Nature and being of them defiling: these breach of these Laws and Rules
are reckoned among the Lev. 18. 27, 28.
abominations of the Heathenish Pagans; Lev. 18. 27, 28, 29.
for these abominations, the Land of Canaan did vomit out her inhabitants; and
all other whosoever that are guilty of such abominations, their souls are under
a threatened judgment to be cut off from among their people; Lev. 18. 5. Adam.
Ezekiel. 20. 11. Luke 10. 28. Gal. 3. 12. Romans 10. 5. Ezekiel. 22. ^0. Amos 2. 7.
Mark 6. 13. Lev. 18. 16. 1 Cor. 5. 1. Lev. 18. 7, 8.
Adam had a promife, and all his Posterity in him, to live in these Laws and
Judgments, if he and they kept and did them: The Prophets in their Doctrine do
reckon these Laws to belong to the ten words; John the Baptist reproved Herod
from these Laws; to have the Brothers Wife was unlawful, one of the prohibited
degrees; so also Paul condemned the having of a Step^mother, as that which was
scarce so much as named among the Gentiles. Natural Right and Reason, its Law
and Light, does dictate the equity of these Laws, which the Imperial Laws, the
Civil Laws, and the Rescripts of Counselors at Law, have established in their
Commonwealths, they being Principles of Truth in the Minds and Hearts of those
who are sound, the very Lev 20. 11 -- 24. Deuteronomy. 27* 20.
Gentiles abstained with abhorrence from such abominations and defilements.
Were it requisite, I could heap up many such Authorities out of their
Historical Records, among the Pagans, Germans, Athenians, Romans, Egyptians,
and Christians in their Councils. By these Laws of Jehovah must we judge and
walk: not by any contrary examples to those Laws; we must inquire for our
pattern and rule, not what either this or that Saint has done, but what the
LORD has revealed and enjoined in this word, and has either commanded or
forbidden; Mat. 19 3 -- -9.
Christ calls us to the first Institution in Paradise, not to what the
Patriarchs did, who by being conversant with the Pagans were in diverse matters
corrupted with their errors and vices, whereby they also corrupted this holy
Ordinance of lawful marriage in particular by their illegal copulations in
several instances: besides what there might be further in that of
extraordinary, either Typical or other Called therefore Chesed. Lev. 20. 17,
which properly does signify Grace or Mercy, which they render an haino^s
crime, a very oppr^bious wicked thing.
dispensation under the administration of Grace, neither does Christ refer the
determination of this case to the toleration granted in Moses's time, because
of the hardness of the heart of the Israelites.

Malachi being one of the last Prophets under the Old Testament administration,
let it now be considered, what Testimony Man. 2. 14 -- -17.
he does bring in toward the true stating of this case, as to the matter of
right? He does put together several Arguments, all which do witness against
Polygamy, or Divorce. Jehovah Aelohim in the first Institution of holy marriage
did make one, he brought and joined together but one Adam and one Eve into and
in this honorable state of conjugal conjunction, when yet all other spirits
were his also, when there was an abundance of the spirit in him; the Prophet
does refer to the Primitive Creation of man and woman, and to the Original
Ordaining of lawful Matrimony between two, one man and one woman, when yet
there was no want of Spirit in the Creator, which he could have breathed into
many, but he afformed but one Eve into a Wife for Adam: Hence comes the
excelling Seed, a Seed of Aelohim; other Seed, is not issue, generation, or
offspring worthy of so glorious a Maker, when it is begotten, and brought
forth of promiscuous, and of wandering lust by nefarious copulation; so that by
instinct of Nature, such so born of Polygamy, or of divorce, have a mark of
contempt put upon them; the LORD seeks an holy Seed, a Seed of Aelohim, a Seed
of Acceptance with him, a Seed whom he will bless, which in those other ways
would not, neither could be so expected; for this cause therefore made he one,
not ten, or twenty, or an hundred or a thousand, for one man at once; no more
but one Adam, and one Eve were to be Matrimonized into one flesh: thus was the
primitive Law of lawful coupling; had Jehovah's will been such, he could have
brought more women to one Adam; yet one Eve must be the Mother of all living,
of all mankind descending from her Loins; he could have inspired more women,
Power was not wanting, but his holy righteous Will and Pleasure was not to have
many Wives joined at one and the same time to one and the same man. Further,
Jehovah is a witness of the Matrimonial Promise made in his presence, with
invocation of his Name: Lawful Matrimony rightfully contracted, is Prove. 2. 17.
the Covenant of Aelohim; he is Surety on both sides, undertaker for both,
recording the contract, and Mal. 3. 5. compared with chapter 2. 14 -- 17.
testifying against the violation of it, ranking Ploygamists amongst the
Adulterers; he is ready to bring in evidence against, and to execute judgments
upon Marriage-breakers, Covenant-violaters of the conjugal Promise; such are
treacherous and unfaithful, who do divorce and put away one and take another,
or who take one to another, and do multiply Wives; Jehovah's Name was
interposed in the first Marriage, the very companionship and confederateship of
the first Wife does confirm this Truth. The weightiness of the forementioned
Reason, the Holiness of the intent, the greatness of the end, why but one woman
for one man, does enforce this, even that, Zerang. Aelohim, est metonymia
materiae, and genitivus efficientis.
he might seek a Seed of Aelohim, such a Seed would he find, an holy Posterity
born in lawful Wedlock, in chaste conjunction, according to his Ordination and
Institution; all other Seed is illegitimate Seed, perverting of the Order and
Ordinance of holy Marriage, and therefore Deuteronomy. 23. 2.
he does brand such Seed with disgrace. Observe further, what a solemn strict
charge the LORD here does give unto his people, bidding them to Mal. 2. 15.

take good heed unto their Spirit in this Matter once and a second time, to
look well to it, as they would answer it at that last day of Judgment: It is
as much as your Souls and your Salvation is worth, now that you are brought
under the conviction of your guilt; though the word be in the Passive Voice, be
thou kept, yet the force and use of it: has somewhat in it reciprocal and
reflex. It will be a vanity here in any Deuteronomy. 24. 1 -- 4. Mar. 5. 31, 32. and
19. 3 -- 91. and Mar. 10. 5, 6.
to pretend a law for Divorce, for the putting away of a lawful Wife; For
AElohim does hate such putting away, the very word and phrase of it relating to
the present matter is odious to him; and the words of that permission by Moses,
which are a consequent disgrace following upon a foregoing Transgression, do
imply and intimate it, and Christ does plead against it: It is violence and
injuriousness done to the Wife, and to the Marriage-covenant, and unto
Jehovah's Law; do not think to cloak and to cover it with such palliation, by
Moses's sufferance of it in your hard hearted Forefathers, it is an heinous
crime; the place does speak of the matter of Fact what was done, not of the
matter of Right what ought to be done; For Pollution is said to follow upon it.
Jehovah does Mal. 2. 13. compared with v. 14, 15, 16, 17.
threaten, not to accept of the persons or services of such Polygamists and
Divorcers. The Bond of Mattimony is perpetual and indissolvable till death,
sancited and established by the infallible authority of the unchangeable
Jehovah. The Wife is the one half part of the man, and he cannot lawfully have
any more half parts at one and the same time; it is against both Scripture and
Nature. The Prophet Malachi does prosecute his argumentation from the nearness
of Christ's coming in the flesh in that day; though Aelohim have hitherto Act.

tolerated your evil manners, yet now Mal. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.
the nearer you are come to the New Testament glorious ministration of Grace it
behooves you to conform the more to the commands of the LORD Jesus Christ: and
so it does under the present providence much concern the people of this age to
abstain from the like provocations, now that Christ is about to appear the
second time, without sin unto Salvation: Otherwise Mal. 2. 17.
the LORD will avenge himself on those who do abuse his long-suffering: God
does not therefore approve, though he did a while forbear the execution of
vengeance upon every Polygamist and Divorcer, their murmuring, contradicting
words did even tire and weary Jehovah.

Let the Reader now collate and compare the Mat. 19. 3 -- 9. Mar. 10. 2 -- 12.
New Testament, and observe the well concordant harmony, and agreeing oneness
of this with the old. Those right words of Christ are very forcible, Whosoever
puts away his wife, except it be for fornication (in which case it was to be
Genesis 26. 11. and 38. 24. Jer. 29. 22, 23. Lev. 20. 10. Deuteronomy. 22. 21, 22, 23,
24, 25. Ezekiel 16. 40. and 23. 47.
death) and marries another (the former being alive) commits adultery, and
he who marries her so put way, commits adultery; so that, it seems evident,
that for a man to marry another, the former being alive, is adultery; and how
could putting away of one be pretended, if marrying of many were warranted? The
conjunction of a Man with his Wife, is the highest and chiefest conjunction; it
is above and beyond, and does exceed and excel the conjunction of Parents and
of Children with each other, which yet has a very close tie by the bond of
Nature, yet must this yield to the former; so that conjugal conjunction is by
much the nearer and greater; and this is the Reason of the highest (...),
significat. arcti^^mane coniunctionem, and (...) Hebrza, (...).
and closest conjunction, that it be individuous, such as may not be divided,
or cut in pieces whilst both remain alive; it is a being glewed together into
one: it is not said simply, the man and the woman shall cleave, or be glewed,
but in composition and conjunction, they shall cleave unto, or adheringly be
glewed together unto each other, which is one great end of their Marriage,
Union and Conjunction, and their conjugal communion and fellowship; which words
seeing they do not go before, but do follow that which Christ had said, from
the beginning of the Creation, God made them Male and Female, for this cause
shall a man leave his Father and Mother, and shall cleave to his Wife, it must
therefore of necessity obtain that force which the Reason of the sequel does
express and require; that therefore which went before, that God made but one
woman to be a Wife, at one and the same time to one man, the consequent reason
does require, that the conjunction of two only, of one man, and of one woman be
understood; for thus is it brought in illatively, or by way of causal, rational
inference. It is against Nature to abscind, or to cut off one part from
another, where the two parts make one; for this is the Nature of two parts,
that from the union of them both together, the health and safety of the whole
does depend; it is not a promiscuous conjunction of many, but of two only
between themselves; so that Christ's reasoning is strongly and clearly
convincing, inferring the perpetual unlawfulness of putting away from the
nearness of Union between the two married persons, only one man and one woman
together. Christ did not make or prescribe any new Law in this case, but he
does revive those material causes which the Jews had wrested and wryed,
perverted, crookned quite off, from, and contrary to the primeve Rule, and he
does reduce, and he does call back those Marriage cases to the first
Institution, From the beginning of the Creation, says he, it was not so, as
you have corrupted it; and from that first ordination, he skilfully proves and
shows, that holy Marriage is the lawful conjunction of but two only, one man
and one woman; between two such he appointed the conjugal Union; he did not say
the man shall glewedly cleave to his Wives, in the plural, but to his Wife in
the singular number, that particular Eve whom he himself had built, and formed,
and brought, and joined to the man Adam; that which to them was thus only said,
and they shall be in one flesh, is by way of additional explication declared in
the New Testament by Christ, to have this meaning, and they two shall be unto
one flesh; Christ does refer that expression in Genesis, they two or both of
them, were naked unto the foregoing sentence, and they two shall be unto one
flesh, and for the greater emphasis sake, he does add the (...).
Article, they two, or these same two, and does repeat it, therefore they are
no more two but one flesh; that therefore which does follow upon this, (...).
what God has joined, the word what does touch or concern these two, one man
and one woman. If the Jews do object, that the practice was anciently otherwise
among the Fathers, which Moses himself did afterward tolerate: Christ does
answer to this, from the beginning of the creation it was not so; contrary
examples of men ought not to prescribe to the primitive Institution by the
adored Almighties: However the God of patience did bear with some things for a
time, which were dissentaneous from the first Institution, yet now Christ has
restored them to their primitive order; however somewhat was indulged to the
peoples perverse froward manners a while, yet Christ does bring men back to the
first declared, determined leading commanding Will of God, unto that which
first, and in it self, in its own nature was pleasing and acceptable to him,
and unto this all his Marriage-Offices and Cases must be referred, that an end
may be put unto all strifes of disputation about them: It is emphatical, and
very significant, which Christ does here say, from the beginning, that is to
say, then at the first Creation, when Jehovah Aelohim did accommodate his
Institutes, these Matrimonial appointments, not to the depraved judgments, and
corrupt affections of lustful men, but according to the very true Nature of
what is just, equal and right, then God made this conjugal Union and
Conjunction, to be only between two, one man and one woman; which is also
judged to be the meaning of those words, and Mat. 19 5.
he said, referring them to the Creator of Adam and of Eve, and to the
Instituter of Marriage, the Lawgiver himself saying so, not Adam; for although
Adam may seem to fix and to establish the Law, because what he did was by the
afflation, inspiring, and instinct of the Spirit of God, yet God himself was he
to whom the Authority and Right did belong, and he was the Author of this
Institution and Law, and the Speaker of these words; it was Jehovah's Law by
the Ministry of Adam. There were but two yoke-fellows conjoined at the first,
not more Eves to one Adam, nor more Adams to one Eve; and the same reason still
holds for all their Posterity, the whole race of Mankind: God Mat. 19. 6.
(...). inde con^uges dicti, and conjugium, Elegans metaphora desumpta a
jumentis and iugo, 2 Cor. 6. 14. Phil. 4. 3.
yoked one man and one woman together; they are but two that can fitly and well
yoke together; they are to draw heavenward together, that they may be Heirs
together of the Grace of Life, and their prayers may not be hindered; thus it
was appointed by Christ, the Head-Captain of all the Hosts of his Creation, he
conjugated one man and one woman by inviolable Ordination, by the way of
Creation: (...). Mat. 19. 5.
For this cause, or for the sake of this, here is the force of Christ's
argument, therefore these two have the Reason of Parts; to put them or divorce
them asunder one from another is very wicked, an heinous crime, and besides
Nature, for this is the reason, the consideration, the cause, the state, the
order, the frame, the nature of two parts, that the whole does depend upon
their mutual Union: He at the first created Male and Female, and gave but one
Eve to one Adam, therefore from the beginning he appointed Monogamy between two
married ones, by an Union undissolveable, but by death or Adultery, and
therefore also prohibited Digamy and Polygamy; there is express mention made of
two only, and of no more in this Marriage-conjunction: one man, and two or more
Wives cannot be one flesh, for the flesh of one is not the flesh of another,
and the flesh of man is divided between two or more Wives, neither can this
closest Union be between more than two; the man cannot give himself alike unto
more than unto one in this case, those two who before the Matrimonial Covenant
were naturally two, are now in the sense of God's Law morally one, conjugally
one: no man therefore may separate them, or unjoyn, or unyoke, or disunite
them: (...) Mat. 19. 6.
Man is without an Article, neither the Husband, nor the Wife; neither their
civil Judge, nor pleading Counselor, not Moses himself, not Aaron, by right:
in case of death the man is free; and in case of Adultery, the guilty person,
when known and convicted, and legally sentenced for this crime, ought to be put
to death: Antichristian infusions, and popish mixtures have much corrupted the
Laws in this case, in the English Government, for if the woman become an
adulteress, and be proved so to be, all and the only, and the utmost remedy,
the wronged Husband can come at, is to sue out freely a Divorce in the
Spiritual Court, as is suited to a corrupt heart, a Divorce from Bed and from
Board, allowing a lustful liberty to marry another: whereas Mat. 19. 9.
this word of our LORD is express, that, Whosoever shall put away his wife,
except for fornication (in which case her life ought to go for it by the holy
just good Law of Christ) and shall marry another (the former still alive
through the sinful indulgence of Humane Laws) commits adultery: and who so
marries her which is put away (her former Husband still living) does commit
adultery: it is adultery both in the one and in the other, if whilst they are
both alive, they take another, the man another woman, or the woman another man:
to which other Scriptures do accord, Romans 7. 2, 3. 1 Cor. 7. 39.
The woman which has an husband, is bound by the law to her husband, so long
as he lives: but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her
husband. So then, if while her husband lives, she be married to another man,
she shall be called an adulteress (that is her proper right name in this case)
but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so that she is no
adulteress, though she be married to another man, she may marry to whom she
will, only in the LORD. The Matrimonial Bond brought her under the Husband, to
which living Husband she is bound by the Law, and she is not made empty of this
obligation, not set loose and free from this conjugal tie, till his death; for,
if before his death, during his life time, she yoke her self to another, Romans
7. 3, (...).
there is a Divine Oracle, a direct answer given forth from the LORD himself,
which should be so received as from him, and accordingly should Civil and
Ecclesiastical Judges pronounce a sentence, when such a one upon sufficient
witness is accused to them, and found guilty by them; but whatever men do judge
of it, that Oracle or Answer, which Christ does return from the propitiatory
covering or Mercy Seat (for Christ's Judicial Laws and Sentences, and
Judgments according to those Laws have mercy in their design toward his
Covenant People) it is this, her true right Name is, she is an Adulteress, and
should be proceeded against as such: The same is applicable unto the Husband,
if he on his part do marry another woman, whilst his former Wife is still
alive; for, the Husband is bound by the Law of Marriage as long as his Wife
lives, but if his Wife be dead, he is at liberty to be married to whom he
will, only in the LORD. They are Christ's own sayings, Mar. 10. 11, 12. Mat. 5.
32.
Whosoever (there is no man excepted, neither King, nor Minister, nor People)
shall foresakingly put away his Wife, thereby seeking to unloose, or to
dissolve the Marriage Knot, the Matrimonial Bond, and marry another, commits
adultery against her, he does adulterate, or act adulterously in and upon her,
to whom he is new married, and against her whom he first married, whom he has
forsaken: and if a woman (let her be what she will, Queen, or any meaner woman
subject) shall put away her Husband, hereby endeavoring to give her self a
loose from the conjugal tie, and be married to another, she commits
Adultery: the same guilt on the man's part, as on the woman's, and on the woman's
part, as on the man's; and they cause one another to commit Adultery by this
unjust Divorce; and he that does marry such a divorced woman is thereby an
adulterer; and she who does marry such a divorced man, is thereby an
adulteress: So that, if Polygamists and Divorcers will stand to this
Scripture-judgement, it is unlawful for the man to marry another woman, his
former Wife being alive; and also for the woman to marry another man, her
former Husband being alive; as also for either of them to divorce the other, an
Mat. 19. 6. (...).
Article were altogether required to be put to man, if any certain individual
were noted; Man for the Humane kind, let him be what man soever he will, Moses,
or any man, not any one of all mankind, has rightful Authority to dissolve,
that Matrimonial Bond between Husband and Wife, of which Bond God himself is
the Author, even the head Captain of Creation, when at the beginning he
conjoined but one Male and one Female; the man is to continue as inseparably
with his Wife, Mat. 19. 4, 5. Ephesians. 5. 28, 29. Mar. 10, 6, 7, 8.
as with another part of the same flesh, of his own flesh; God united two into
one, this must not be altered, it ought still to continue, as it was
established at the first; it is utterly unlawful to do otherwise; the prime Law
at the Creation must obtain, the Marriage Union may not be violated, Husband
and Wife are to cherish and sustain, to assist and comfort one another, as if
they were members of one and the same flesh and body; no man that is in his
right wits and sober senses ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes it: he
will not rend and tear his own flesh from himself. ^ Cor. 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Let Paul's judgment upon the case be now weighed in the Scripture-balance: he
was written unto about it, and he does expressly declare concerning married
ones, that every man is to have his own proper Wife, and every woman her own
proper Husband; and how could this be, if Polygamy were allowable and
warrantable? for if every man must have her, that is properly his own, and no
other man's, and as exclusive of all other women, who are not so properly his
own; and if every woman must have him, who is properly her own, and no other
woman, as shutting out all other men, who are not so properly her own; then
Marriage must be between one man and one woman, and between two such only. If
one man had ten, or twenty, an hundred or a thousand Wives (for, where will you
set the bounds of restraint, if once you allow more than one at once?) there
could not be an equal distribution; neither would there be enough to suffice
for every man, who cannot contain to have one, and so the remedy by Marriage
would not reach to all men, which yet does belong to all, as the disease of of
proneness to Fornication is general to all: and the like inconvenience and
mischief would unavoidably follow, if one woman might have ten, twenty, an
hundred, or a thousand Husbands: Whereas, the LORD in the way of his providence
does bring forth, and breed up near about an equal number of men and of women,
of Males and of Females in all Nations, of the inhabited Earth. Where there is
but one Wife allowed by the LORD to one man, yet Lev. 15. 19 -- 25, 29, 30. and
18. 19 and 20. 18. Ezekiel. 18. 6. and 22. 10. and 36. 17.
even in that case there are seasons, when he would have the man forbear to
know his Wise by Seed of Copulation, as when her monthly sickness is upon her,
or when the Wife is known to be with Child, thereby to evidence, and to
manifest purity of mind, and chastity of body, and mortification of inordinate
lusts: or when for a time they consentingly so agree for higher and holier
ends, that they may be the better at leisure for fasting and prayer. How can
this be, where so many Wives call upon the Husband at once, and so all the year
long? wandering lusts in their unbounded desire are belluine and brutish,
impetuous and unsatisfied; how could burning be cured, and how could this
afford a sufficient help against temptation to uncleanness. 1 Cor. 7. 2.
unusque habeat (...), propriam and legitimam, non (...), non (...).
It is only one Wife at once, that is the proper, the legitimate Wife, no other
woman at that time is so; and it is only one man at once, that is the proper,
the legitimate Husband, no other man at that time is so: The man has not the
authority or right of his own body, but the Wife; and how can this interest and
propriety be preserved, where many women do at one and the same time challenge
such a pretended Right? for, but one can have it at once: 1 Cor. 7. 3.
when the man does give his body to another Wife, or to more Wives, the first,
who is the only lawful Wife, has that benevolence, which is a due debt owing
only to her, given and derived to another, or to more; and so 1 Cor. 7. 5.
she is wronged, and suffers loss; she is injuriously defrauded of her Right,
which her Husband does detain, or take way from her, and does dispose of it to
one or more besides, who have no lawful claim to it. When men are so much
believers, and so far Christians, as to tremble at the word of Jehovah Aelohim,
and to feel their hearts to stand in awe of it, and to find their judgments
and wills thoroughly to submit to his Authority who gave it, they will then
acknowledge a forceabless in these Scripture-argumentations, against those two
heinous crimes, and scandalous sins of Polygamy, and of Divorce: where God has
coupled an Husband and a Wife, they must so remain joined, till the same God do
dis^joyn them by death. That Doctrine which our LORD Jesus Christ did preach,
is expressly Mat. 5. 3 1, 32. and 19. 3 -- 9. Mar. 10. 9, 10, 11, 12.
against Divorces; however, a contrary practice had much and long obtained,
which did put the Disciples upon asking of Christ of the same matter, it was so
great and so weighty a cause. Whatever Moses said, by way of permission about
giving a Writing of Divorcement, and so to put away a Wife, yet this, was no
original Saying or Precept from our LORD; Christ spoke otherwise: (As in
another instance in this Nation, about 37 Hen. 8. 9
Usury, the same Laws of men, that do tolerate the vice of Usury, suffering a
certain sum of gain yearly for the loan of a hundred pound, yet does withal
condemn it as a thing unlawful. 1 Cor. 11. 3, 8. and 7. 10. 11.
The woman is of the man, and must still be subject unto him as her head; what
man can dispense rightfully with the subordination, and subjection of the body
to the head, and under it, or sever the head from the body, to make them depart
from one another, till death do part them? When therefore, Reader, thou meerest
any where with any Laws in the Scriptures, that do relate to divorces and
puttings away of a Wife, look upon them, Mat. 19. 8. Deu^. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.
as Permissions by Moses, not as Precepts from Jehovah; understand me, not from
Jehovah, as they are Divorces, but only a Law by consequenr upon a supposition:
If they were resolved to put away a Wife, then this or that was to follow upon
it; if the case of the blind-minded, and hard-hearted Husbands were such, that
they would be and were divorced from their Wives, when such a fould matter came
to pass, then the LORD appointed, that if another man had married the divorced
woman, or if that later man were dead, that then she was not to return to her
former Husband; because she had defiled her self by and with another man; the
first great cause whereof was from her first Husband, who thrust her out upon
this temptation: the first Divorce was unjust, and the second Marriage was
unlawful, the first Husband being still alive, and sin was thereby brought upon
the Land, which was punishable for this guilt; for, not only were the guilty
persons themselves, the man and the women, liable and obnoxious to judgment
for this crime, but all the inhabitants also, who knew it and suffered it, if
they did not in their places appear against it. This shameful consequent was on
purpose to deter them from the other sinful Antecedent: And therefore that
expression in Deuteronomy, before cited in the Margin, should not be rendered
imperatively, let him write her a Bill of Divorcement, and give it in her hand,
and send her out of his house; as if Jehovah Aelohim gave his Direction and
Command, that this man was in Duty, or by any lawful rightful allowance, to
deal thus with her in this case: But it expresses, Deuteronomy. 24. 1, 3. (...)
what the man had done, and would do, the three first verses of that twenty
fourth Chapter, do declare the hard hearted man's purpose and practice; it is
the fourth Verse that does open the mind of our LORD, that if the man was
resolvedly set upon such a sinful course, that then it was not lawful for him
to take her again, which does plainly show Jehovah's utter dislike of that
illegal Divorcement, they were irregular miscarriages, the LORD gave no
countenance to such licentious practices. We do not read of any express law and
direct command of Aelohim, for the jealously-suspitious, unhumane Husband so to
deal with his Wife. Aelohim, in this case, Mal. 2, 14, 26.
does hate that word, put her away; the man cannot lawfully break that
Covenant, which the LORD was called in to witness that he made with the woman,
when he took her first in Marriage, nothing can justly loose the Matrimonial
Bond but death, or a case of adultery, which was a Lev. 20. 10. Deuteronomy. 22. 22.
Job 31, 9, 11. John 8. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
capital crime, and to be punished with death by the Judges. One such example
of Justice in this Island were more likely to terrify the inhabitants thereof,
and to prevent any further guilt in principle, or in practice about this foul
sin, than ten other arguments in such an age of monstrous bodily uncleanness;
of speculative unbelief, and of practical Atheism. Whatever success upon the
hearts of Readers, this paper Testimony has or shall have, is with him, in
whose hands the hearts of men are: In this I rejoice, that the LORD has not
left me to be ashamed of Christ, nor of his Words in this Mar. 8. 38.
Adulterous and sinful Generation. They are the Scripture-Rules and Precepts of
our LORD Christ, which we must walk by, and whom we must obey, Heb. 5. 9.
if we would have him to be the Author of eternal Salvation, Heb. 13. 4.
and who will judge Whoremongers and Adulterers, all whosoever they be, who are
profane corrupters of Holy Marriage.

Whether thorowout the Scriptures, where ever Adam is found in the Original it
should not be so rendered in the Translation into other Languages leaving it to
the expounder, in the help and supplies of the holy Spirit, to show, when it is
meant properly of the The- Adam, and when collectively of more? This I judge
greatly useful, to be far inquired into, and seriously to be considered of. It
is scarce imaginable till proof be made of this, what variety of choice
discoveries would shine forth from hence. That all the Old Testament through we
can find Adam but twenty times, or about that small number, in our English
Translation; Whereas, it is expressed in the Original many scores of times, let
the vulgar Reader think and consider, whether much of this useful Learning
about Man's Nature and State have not been hereby hidden from him; And let the
Judicious and experienced in the Hebrew words and phrases say, whether many
controversies in Religion about Adam and his fall, and his conveying of guilt
and corruption to his Posterity, with much more of profitable practical
Doctrines and Duties, Graces and Privileges, would not be evidently
demonstrated hereby? Adam was not created at the first Androg ynous, with two
distinct several Faces, and with a double body, afterward to be divided and
pulled asunder one from another to become two: Aelohim created Genesis 1. 26, 27.
Eccles. 7. 29.
them, in the plural, Male and Female, severed ones, sundred Personages. Genesis
5. 1, 2.
The Male and the Female- Adam were both Genesis 1. 28. and 5. 2.
blessed together, and therefore at that time they had both of them a created
distinct being. Aelohim's benediction which he gave to Adam, the Male and the
Female, is more large and ample in expressions and in things, than those words
of blessing, which before he uttered to other Creatures, they had propagation
as other living creatures made on the fifth day, though not so numerous as the
most of them; and further they were endowed and enriched with many a good
perfect gift, of Spirit, Soul, and Body, beyond them. We must learn and know,
mind and consider, That the Creation in the whole and in every part thereof;
together with all the Honor and Glory of that Power and Wisdom, and other
glorious Excellencies which did so manifest themselves therein, is wholly and
only to be ascribed, and attributed to Aelohim, whose name is Above 30 times in
Genesis 1. and 2. 1, 2, 3.
so often, as has been observed, used in this History. Adam was bound actually
to believe in Aelohim, and in his Word, as soon as he was created: For he had
Genesis 1. 26 -- 31. and 2. 1, 2. 3. 1 Timothy 4. 3, 4, 5.
a Word and a Promise from Christ in this History of the Creation. Adam was to
believe Aelohim's sanctifying of appointed Meats created for his Food, to be
received of them who being believing ones, and acknowledging ones of the Truth:
(to mention no more particulars now) So that Faith in the creating Messiah has
a Foundation in created Nature: Adam had a power in created Nature, to believe
in Christ, and his Holiness, and his Righteousness were a perfection suitable
and con-natural to him. Thus the sum of the Decalogue was imprinted in Adam's
heart: Faith in Jehovan Aelohim is the substance of the first word, or command,
which was enjoined to all the World of Mankind in Adam, and so Faith in Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit; It was always a Truth from the very first creating and
forming of Man, and was actually a Law and command upon Man and Mankind, that,
without Faith it is impossible to please God, whom to please as well as to
believe in was a plain duty (accordingly Abraham believed in God, who accounted
it to him for righteousness; and all the Children of Abraham must be of the
same Faith and Practice) For he that comes to God, must believe, that he is,
and that, he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. The eleventh
Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in several instances does relate, that
the Saints and people of God under the Old Testament-administration, did
actually rely upon Christ by Faith, for which Faith they are there commended.

This original concreated Holiness and Righteousness in Adam, being such a Law
of Nature, as whereof the ten Words are a perfect Transcript and an exact
Summary, it were a matter well worth a further re-search and a deeper Inquiry,
whether the Doctrinal-part as well as the Duty-part of true pure Religion be
not to be found in the Decalogue. Ps. 1. 2. and 19. 7. and in a multitude of
other places (...) 2 Samuel 7. 19. (...) The Law of that Adam, Eccl. 12. 13
Thorah, is one of the Names of this Law, often used in the Old Testament; The
Native signification of which word is, Doctrine; It is a Doctrinal Law cast
before the Disciples of the LORD, teaching and instructing us concerning his
will toward us, and about our Office toward him and our Neighbor, in what we
are to believe, as to the credends, and to do, as to the Agends, of Religion,
informing us in the Truth of the premises as well as directing us in the
practice of the conclusions. Faith and obedience in their large comprehensive
notation do take in the whole of Religion, they are Eccles. 2. 13. 1 John 3.
22. 23, 24. Genesis 25. 6. Gal. 3. 5 -- 9. Heb. 11. 6. Romans 3. 19 -- 31. and ch 4.
all Adam, as to this: For Adam was under a Law, under this Law. The Articles
of our Belief, are within the bounds of the Laws of the Decalogue: He, that
would be regular in his obedience, must also be found in the Faith. These are
the Essential constitutive parts of an entire perfect Holiness and
Righteousness. The LORD Jesus Christ confirmed the Truth of his Doctrine from
the Authority of his own Law, and in asserting the Doctrine of the Resurrection
(which is one great particular instance) he fetches the force of his Argument
from the first Word, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob: God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. To assent
unto revealed Truth is as necessary a part of our Duty as to perform commanded
service: And if it be narrowly looked into and duly pondered, it will be
manifest that all the Acts of our obedience do as naturally result from some
Act of Faith, as all the Acts of Faith do naturally resolve into some Act of
obedience: as a general subjection of our whole Man to the will of this
Sovereign LORD does bottom upon a general belief of his Truthfulness; So also
are particular Acts of this Subjection (where they are distinct and clear,)
built upon some particular Belief of that Truthfulness, as this veracity and
goodness of Word Revelations do include and teach, direct and hold forth; The
more we recover and are restored to those endowments which were concreated
principles in Adam, the more shall we discern and acknowledge the exactest
obedience to be the highest equity, and the best dutifulness to be the rightest
reason. Whether Adam's Faith whilst he continued and stood in his uprightness
had or could have any eye to a Messiah, for the rendering of his obediential
Acts acceptable to Aelohim is one of those deep things, which it may be even
the most learned among Believers, are not yet gone to the bottom of. However
this be, the discovery here does evidence the vanity, insufficiency and
unprofitableness of Ethnic Philosophy, which does run so many of its empty
notions into unpractical Theories: Whereas, Word-Revelations in the most
mysterious of its credibles is influential upon obedience and does pass into
Active doingness; Which the Philosophic Schemes of Ethnic Systems, have been
are, and will be, defective in. There is another (...) Prove. 4. 2. Deuteronomy. 22. 2.
(Eccles 12. 13.) Deuteronomy. 33. 2. 3, 4.
Hebrew Word, describing the Law of Jehovah, taken from a root which does
signify, he took, or he did receive, and its proper meaning is Doctrine,
Perception, Reception, Discipline, or a Law received, which the Disciples of
the Messiah sitting at his Feet do receive from him, teaching them their duty
in his own words. Let this be further improved by the diligent and discerning.
The fruitful propagating of Mankind by Genesis 1. 28. Heb. 11. 11. Lev. 1^. 2. 1
Cor. 7. 2, 3. etc.
conjugal generation is still a fruit and effect of this first blessing from
Aelohim upon Adam: Holy Marriage, (being the lawful conjunction of one Man and
of one Woman into one Flesh, that there may be a seed of Aelohim.) was Genesis 2.
18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
instituted by Christ himself. This World was created much Genesis 1. 28. and 2.
16, 19. Ps. 8. 6. Heb. 2. 7, 8. 1 Timothy 4. 3. 1 Cor. 3. 21, 22. Romans 8. 28. 32.
Hos 2. 18. 21, 22. Job. 5. 23.
for the good and for the use of Man, the lower Earth and Seas whereof are more
subjected to him, especially for the good of the chosen and believing. That
Royal Dominion by large free grant from Aelohim, which Adam had by gracious
Donation, was Ps. 115. 16. and 8. 4 -- -8.
over the whole Earth, Jehovah has given this Earth unto Adam and unto Adam's
Sons. Adam as an invited called guest, found suitable provision prepared for
him. Amongst the rest he had Genesis 1. 28, 29, 30. Ps. 104. 14. 15. Genesis 9. 3. 4.
Herbs, seeding seed, and Fruit Trees, which did direct him, and it does still
direct us in our choice of this kind of Food. For Deshe. Genesis 1. 11, 12.
there was a third sort of somewhat different kind created on the third day, a
sort of green buddings (not so growing by sowing their seed or by Planting)
which is more properly the Food of other Animals. This should be well
considered, that Man may well understand his Grant, and may discern what is fit
food for him of the Creatures made on the third day, as well as those made on
the fifth day: For, even Genesis 1 28. 29, 30. 1 Timothy 4. 3, 4, 5. Genesis 9. 3. 4.
living creatures mentioned before, whether, they were appointed not also to be
Meat for Man (many of them, so they were need in a Scriptural orderly way,
their lives and bloods being first regularly taken from them, and so prepared
for meet Aliment) as well as Herbs and fruit, so that, both these are to be
taken into this grant of Food, some Animals being naturally in their created
essence clean wholesome Food, as others are naturally in their created being
unclean, unwholsom food, though otherwise useful for the good of Man, yet not
proper nutriment for him? This also does call for further search after it in
the Scriptures. As Aelohim would (...) have Mankind propagated so also he would
have individuals of that kind to be conserved; For which end he appointed unto
Adam suitable sustenance, and well-agreeing nourishment: Which singular
Providence and special goodness of his, is thankfully to be acknowledged, and
duly to be considered; Seeing that they are not these creatures only that Man
lives by; Deuteronomy. 8. 3. Mat. 4. 4. Luke. 4. 4.
but, by every word proceeding out of Aelohim's mouth: His Word of power giving
forth a command to such creatures to be nourishing unto the Religious Rational
creature, and his Word of promise speaking this Covenant blessing over the
hearts of the believing ones. And 1 Timothy 4. 3, 4, 5. Luke 22. 17. 19. 1 Cor.
10. 30, 31. John 6. 11. 23. Mat. 14. 19. Mark 6. 41. Luke 9. 16. Acts 27. 35.
Isai. 62. 9. Act^ 2. 42, 46. Romans 14. 6.
therefore before our Meals we should seek him in the Word and Prayer, to bless
and sanctify his good creatures to our use. And 1 Timothy 4. 4. 1 Cor. 10. 30,
31. Joel 2. 26. John 6. 11, 23. Mat. 26. 26, 27, Mark 14. 23. Romans 14. 6. Ephesians.
5. 20. Col. 3. 17. Psalm. 14. 4. 1 These. 5. 18. Isa. 62. 9. Mat. 15. 36. Mark 8.
1, 7. Luke 24. 30. Deuteronomy. 8. 10. 1 Samuel 9. 13.
after our Meals we should close with Thanksgiving unto this God of Bounty, to
the Father who has freely given us their use, to the Son who has dearly
purchased this, and to the Holy Spirit who sealingly applies this. When
Aelohim took a view of Genesis 1. 31.
all that which he had made on this sixth day, made adornedly really to exist
as preparedly perfected, he beheld it as good, greatly, abundantly, vehemently,
validly good. The Universal particle, All, seems here to be put for the number,
not of multitude of kinds, so as to comprehend all, and every of the several
sorts of Creatures, but of Unity, relating to that one special eminent kind of
Creature, Adam: all which, in the singular Number, as appears by the Adjective
of the Singular Number, good: This being in the Singular Number not Plural
Number. There was much said and done on this sixth day, yet all this Universal
is restrained to Adam that excelling one of Creatures. Who of us knows the all
of that which was created in, and con-created with Adam? There is a great
deficiency amongst us in this Science about Man: So little do we understand of
our selves: Neither are we likely to grow any thing considerably in this
knowledge of our selves as to our make, either our first created-make, or a new
created-make, as long as there is a reforting to vain Philosophy and its
Ethnic Schoolmasters to be taught the knowledge thereof. Although the Doctrine
of Adam, of Man, as Man, have but one piece and part of the created Works of
Aelohim for its subject matter, Man being the product of the sixth day only,
and so, as to days, but one part and work of six, a small portion of whole
created Nature: Yet this Man Science, this Anthropological Art, or the
knowledge of a Man's self, is one of the great designs of all other useful
knowledge, they do much aim at this, and they have a tendency toward the
promoting of this, and without this, how can other Sciences receive an advance
by Man! How is he in an hopeful way of improving of other sort of Learning, who
has not as yet attained to any considerable growth in the knowledge of himself?
The more we know of our selves the more shall we know of Jehovah Aelohim, and
of his Word and Works: and then will these have reflexive Influence upon that,
for the more that we know of these, the more shall we know of our selves. And
therefore let not the Reader misjudge this to be a subject too low for a
Minister of Christ to treat of: 2 Cor. 13. 5. Gal. 6. 3, 4. Lam. 3. 40. 1 Cor.
11. 28.
For, we are commanded and required to examine our own selves, to prove our own
selves, that, we may know our own selves, whether Jesus Christ be in us, unless
we be unexperienced, unapproved ones. Man has such created faculties and
Abilities, whereby he can turn inwardly upon himself; he can reflect upon
himself. The last of the Hebrew conjugations is self-reflexive, which should
have been more and better observed by Translators in their rendering of the
Original significancy into other Languages. Man can Ps. 4. 4.
commune with himself, as he walks with himself, so he can talk also with
himself, he can treat with himself, and entertain himself. You may find Man in
some Scriptures bespeaking himself, evpostulating and reasoning the case with
himself, conferring with his constitutive parts particularly and distinctly,
Ps. 42. 5. 11. and 43. 5. and 116. 7. Isa. 26. 9. Ps. 103. 1, 2, 22. Job 32. 8,
18. and 21. 4. Ps. 31. 5. and 77. 3. 6. Luke 1. 47. Acts 7. 59. Ps. 35. 3, 9,
10.
often with his own Soul, and about his own heart, both in colloquies with
himself, and in his speech to God. Which is one ground and reason both in
Scripture and in Nature of the warrantableness of using the plural number, of
you, and ye, when we speak to a singular person, or individual subsistence,
only to one, there being more constitutive intelligent parts in Man, than only
one, as his Spirit and his Soul particularly, and therefore are not so justly
reproveable, if we do not always Thou it, and Thee it, to a single Man: For,
sometimes others do speak distinctly to some particular constitutive part of
us, as to the Ps^^. 11. 1. and 3. 2.
Soul in special. Reader, if thou be serious and considerable, do thou not
see cause, why thy Face should be all in a blush, and thy Spirit be covered
with shame, who have lived so long with thy self, who have gone up and down,
and have sat and lodged, so often with thy self and yet all this while have so
little acquaintance with thy self? For the promoting of Jo^. 42. 5, 6. Ezekiel.
36. 31.
Soul-humbling, and of self-emptying in thee, (which is a singular Art.) O know
thy self aright, study thy self much, observe thy self narrowly, try thy self
diligently, examine thy self impartially, judge thy self righteously; report
the whole state of thy self to thy self, truly and faithfully, make thy appeal
to an Heart-searching God, sincerely according to what thou do ^ind, brought
in by way of evidence, and of sentence upon the whole of the Matter, whether it
be for or against thy self. There is great reason and need why thou should
know thy self, examine and prove thy self in order unto the discovering and
evidencing of this, whether Jesus Christ be in thee or not? For, without this,
either Christ is in thee or not? If he be not in thee, and yet thou think thy
Spiritual State safe, then thou will deceive thy self, and put a fallacy upon
thy self; thou will be in danger of living and dying under Soul-undoing
mistakes; thou will then some ways be the further off from getting Christ to be
in thee; thou will be most to seek of a Christ, when thou shall have most use
and need of him: Thou art like to be little owned and employed by Christ: And
thy disappointment will be the more overwhelming at the last, when it may be
too late to remedy it: and it will be too late, if thou pass from hence into
the other World in a Christless condition: and for the present whilst thou art
such as not to have Christ in thee, then reigning sin is in thee, then ruling,
domineering Satan is in thee; then thou art not as yet in Christ, then as yet
thou art without Spiritual^saving-good, exposed to all kind of evil, dreadful
wrath is over thee: and then whilst severed from him thou can not do any one
thing spiritually, acceptable. If Christ be in thee, yet without this
self-knowing, self-examining, self-proving, thou will not have so clear an
evidence of this, thou will not have so sweet a comfort, and so sound an
enjoyment of it: Thou will not make so growing an improvement of it, in Duties,
under Crosses, by Privileges; Thou art not so likely in a dying day to
discern, whither thou will be going; whether to be with Christ, or to be driven
from Christ: Whereas with this self^knowledge; if hitherto thou have not Christ
savingly in thee, (yet thou will be in the hopefuller way to make out after
him, and to get him into thee: and if he be found in thee, thou will then the
more to thy fulfilling satisfaction enjoy both him in thee, and thy self in
him. Then will Christ more manifest himself to be by thee, with thee, and for
thee: All suitable good will be thine, a full Christ, and a full Covenant of
Grace, will be thy Portion: The hope of Glory will then be in thee: Christ and
thou shall be ever together. O the happy Progresses of that Believer between
whom and Christ, there is actual, Mutual in-being, in-dwelling, in-abiding!

This Adam* Art, or Man Science, is very spreading and fruitful, very useful
and profitable, and it is to be considered, either as man is made a sociable
Creature, and so fitted for congregated Fellwoship, or as man was created, a
several Individunm, and so is of a distinct segregating; and accordingly the
various knowledges of Adam, of Man, do widen, and distribute, and distinguish
themselves: Into so many sorts is this partition of Sciences, that a long life
might to advantages dwell upon them, and make such Collections from out of the
Word about them, which if oderly disposed, and freely communicated, would be
one rich Treasure in the Commonwealth of Learning. If Adam or Man be
considered as in society, related unto other men in a way of Humane Fellowship,
so here might pass under disquisition and examination diverse Arts and Sciences:
For, if we look upon Adam, as he that was in times after his first Creation, an
Husband, a Patient, a Master, a Converser, a Negotiator, a King, a Prophet, a
Priest, a Church Officer and Member; so here might be brought in the
Marriage-Art, to know how to discharge the Duties, and enjoy the Privileges of
a conjugal relation; the paternal Art, what the carriage of Parents, and of
Children should be toward each other; the Magistral Art, what the Offices of
Masters and of Servants are toward one another; the whole oeconomick Art* the
conversation Art, to have practical understanding, and prudential skill in
treating, and in conversing with others; the Art of trading in the World with
and amongst men, so as to negotiate all our Affairs with Humane discretion: The
Art of Government, or the Science of Empire; to discern how to Rule over
inferiors according to the Word: The Art of teaching, or the Prophets Science,
to be able in Office, for the instructing of others: The Administrators Art, to
be well versed in the carrying on of all the parts of Instituted Worship, after
a spiritual manner, so as to find acceptance of the LORD: The Art of right
constituting of a Church, according to the Scripture-pattern, in all the holy
Laws, and comely Orders thereof: Of having all necessary Church Officers gifted,
graced, called, according to the Word-rule, of wise, faithful discharging of
all Church-Relation, of all the Duties of Gospel-Fellowship, of orderly
admission of Church Members, of regular exercise of Church Discipline. And now,
if we further consider Adam or Man, as to his own singular individual person,
how many advantageous Arts and Sciences might here pass under further inquiry?
The whole Adam and entire compositum of Man, as to spirituals, does in its
comprehension call for much skill in several Mysterious Sciences; as of the
excelling Prerogative of man's Primitive created Holy, Happy, Healthful State:
Of man's miserable condition under his fallen sinful state: Of man's restaured
Felicity, in the New Created Converted State: Of man's unexpressible summity of
Happiness in his glorified Estate: And as for Adam, for Man, in his Naturals;
the body of Man takes in, the Art of Cookery for nourishment; the Art of
Medicine for Curing; the Art of Surgery for Healing; the Art of Anatomy for
Dissection; the Art Cosmetick, for Clothing, for comeliness, for cleanness, for
due-bounded Decoration: The Art of Activity for all bodily, lawful Exercises:
The Art of patient suffering: And if I would crumble this into a multitude of
particulars, respecting the inward and out parts of the body, how many under
Arts do these contain, Ear-art, Eye^art, Tongue^art, Heart-art; besides many
that I could mention about the Humors, the Blood, the proper Offices and
Functions of every part, with a multitude of more: Get we into the soul, or
into the spirit of Adam, or of Man: Very profitable disquisitions might here be
made; what the specific Natures and Differences of these are: what their
several Offices, Functions, Facuities, Motions, and such like: What the several
Objects of them are: And how that these would take in many Arts and Sciences:
the Intellect of Man does lead to the Art of Scripture-Logick: His will and
affections to the Art of Scripture Ethics: His invention and Judgment, when
it steps into Elocution, to the Art of Scripture^Rhetorick: What shall I more
say? If the particular Arts and Sciences do so muitiply, and there be so much
in the holy Scriptures about every one of these, as I could, had I time and a
call thereunto, evidently demonstrate to any Spiritual Discerner and Judicious
Inquirer; is it not then clear, that he who has a Purse, and a mind
proportionable to so great an undertaking, might employ scores of the most
Learned men in the World, about much of the most useful work in the World? And
now I could pity the great princely, noble, wealthy ones of this World, who
have so much, and yet do so little; who are entrusted with many Talents, and
yet do Trade so little with them, for the promoting of so choice good in the
Commonwealth of Learning. How many thousands and Millions of pounds are there
sinfully wasted and vainly expended about sensual Arts and voluptuary Sciences
to the corrupting and undoings of hundreds of Souls! One whereof is of more
true, solid-worth than an whole World: Which, if it were laid out, and improved
for the advancement of Scripture-Learning, would pass both comfortably upon
account at the last Judgement-day, and in the mean time forward and spread some
of the rarest Excellencies and choicest Fellcities that rational Creatures; and
Humine Intellects are capable of on this side of the heavenly glory: But though
I should even break my loins with sighing, and blind my eyes with Writing, yet
when once will it be otherwise, till the LORD himself do open the Eyes, and
irradiate the minds, and change the hearts, and incline the wills, and engage
the Spirits, of some of the great ones of the Earth to appear more in so
righteous a Cause? At the present, because it is a prosecuting of that subject
matter which I am upon, let me present somewhat to the view of men conversant
in the Art and Practice of Medicine with respect to man; which may, if the LORD
will bless it to that end, engage them to be more in the studious research into
the Scriptures for the promoting and advancing of the Medicinal-Science, which
Ethnic Philosophy can never perfect.

In the general, let it be pondered upon, whether those who have a name to be
great advancers of Learning, particularly of this part of Learning, the
Medicinal Art, ^have ever laid this Science upon a sound bottom, who affirm,
that Medicine not grounded upon Philosophy is a weak thing: and that the
knowledge of Medicine has this wanting, a true and active Natural Philosophy,
upon which the Medicine should be built? That there is a defectiveness in this
Art, as commonly studied, professed and practiced, is confessed by the
Discerning and Ingenious: So that some further Maturation and perfecting of it,
is much desired: But that ever either old Ethnic Philosophy in Principles, or
new Experimental Philosophy in practice, by Christians can attain this
completing augment, without fetching of it out of the Scriptures of Truth,
that I deny. For these being Philosophizings, or vain affected Humane
Reasonings, according to outward senses, (which are very fallible, in two great
cases especially, when either Objects are at too great a distance, or when
Objects are very secret and hidden, at least in their inward Springs, and
Causes, and Combinations, showing themselves outwardly only by some darker
symptoms and deceitful signs) These, I say, cannot give so right a judgment in
many cases. There are diverse diseases of the Soul, and of the Spirit in man,
which do also influence to the diseasing of the body, which mere natural
Philosophy cannot discover or remedy, without the Word: And there are several
Diseases of the body, which for the new kinds, the unseen causes, the
complex^combinations of them, the undiscerned Seat and Root of them in some of
the inward bodily parts (with more that might be added) are neither knowable
nor curable by mere Humane Wisdom. It is only a Scriptural-thread, that can
lead into the cause and cure of these, by a quick and piercing judgment given
by the holy Spirit. Jer. 15. 18. and ^0. 12, 13, 15, 17. Mar. 5. 25 -- 34. and
6. 13. and 16. 18. Jam. 5. 14, 15, 16. Deuteronomy. 28. 27, 35. 2 Chronicles. 21. 18. Job.
34. 6. Mic. 1. 9. Hos. 5. 13* Mat. 17. 16. Jer. 46. 11.
Are there not some Diseases which the most learned Philosophers, in the
Medicinal Art, do count and call incurable, which yet may find a remedy in the
Word? Here is an Al-Heal, where the Patient has Faith in Christ, and in his
Word. Let this also be considered, whether those Philosophizers can or will
ever restaur, and consummate the Medicinal Art who make the body of man to be
the subject of Medicine? Whereas, there is a multiplicity of Maladies in the
Soul of Man, and deep wounds in the Spirit of Man, both which by natural
causality do distemper the body; and how can Ethnic Philosophers, or other
vain affecters of Humane Wisdom, reach these, or understand the right Methods
of apt Remedies, when without the Word they neither know what the Soul of Man
is, nor what his Spirit is, nor what the specific difference is between the
Soul and the Spirit in man, nor by what Medium of contract, the Spirit and Soul
in man do operate upon each other, and both upon the body, nor which way, by
what applications to come at them; or what specific Remedies are adapted to
them?

Give me liberty to be a little more particular and distinct yet, with respect
to the Body, the Soul, and the Spirit, which are the 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. Luk 1. 46,
47, 48.
three essential constitutive parts of Man. How can the Medicinal Art in the
Old or New Philosophical way be so satisfactory to any deep, piercing, serious
Inquirer, whilst in that way it is a mere conjectural deceiveable Art? How many
of their Recipes are there, which when taken inwardly they understand not how
they work upon the inward parts, by what kind of causality and efficiency? How
it does take hold of one part, and not of another; How it does seize upon this
humor and not upon that; How any of the inwards parts do cooperate with the
Medicine; What the Faculties and Functions of the several inward parts are, to
promote the efficacy of the Recipe? How many various commixt, concurring,
unobserved accident, as they call them, may quite change and alter the
operation and the effects of the Ingredients? With much more that might be
instanced in. How great variety is there in a little space of time in ^he
humors and temperament of one and the same body, occastoned o^ a sudden by
some distempered passions or ungoverned affections, or mis-s^apen
apprehensions, or transporting phrensies, or deep imaginations, which the most
skilful and observing Physician can neither prevent nor remedy! And although
some of the more wise and faithful of them do in their Methods and Rules about
this Art treat of the effects of the inner Man, of the unexpected changes
suddenly befalling the mind, as having an alterative affectiveness upon the
outer Man, either to speed on, or to hold back the cure. Yet how can their
Counsel and Prescriptions be proper and pertinent here for the governing of the
passions and for the ordering of the affections of their Patients, without
resorting to Scripture directions in particular Scriptures to enforce
obedience, to call forth Faith, and to encourage prayers? which the common
exhortations from mere Philosophical Ethnicks cannot so do. How many inward
cases of Spiritual maladies are there, which none of the common Medicinal
Prescriptions can remove and remedy? This kind of Patients the practicers of
Physic do, either send to the Minister for spiritual Cordials, and healing
Counsels, or else sometimes they dismis^ them to the Bedlam, when it is
outrageous Frenzy, or wol^ish Melancholy, or diabolical possession: and for a
veil of their ignorance, and a cover of their shame, they conclude many
Diseases to be obstinate against all remedies: Whereas if the Scriptures were
searched into about this, much more would there be discovered of a Directory;
And if all else should fail, the LORD would often effect cures even to
wonderment, were Faith acted aright upon a suitable Word. There was a sick Maid
given over by a Learned Practitioner in the Medicinal Art, as gasping and
dying, and when a Pastor being present, had drawn the Physician aside into the
next Room, the Physician told him that she had two or three mortal Diseases so
far gone upon her, that either of them would be her Death. And yet when the
Minister had cleared the Chamber of other bystanders, himself and some few
others in Church Fellowship with him, acted according to that prescription and
promise in Jam. 5. 14. 15, 16.
James, and the LORD immediately raised her up: and a short time after she was
seen walking in the streets healthful and well: All the praise belongs to
Jehovah Aelohim. There is a Scriptural Art of Cure, when the Shops of
Apothecaries do afford no help.

There are many latent operations of Nature, which mere Ethnic Philosophy
cannot find out; Acts ^2. 23. 2 Samuel 24. 16. Mat. 17. 28. Mark 9. 25. Luke 4.
35, 39. Mark 9. 17. Mark*. 23 -- 26.
and there are diverse unseen Inflicters of Diseases, (sometimes by good Angels,
other times by evil Spirits,) which must receive a Word cure, if ever they be
rightly cured. The Holy Scriptures do expressly mention several particular
Diseases, as running Sores, flowing Issues, Boyls, Fevers, Consumptions,
Inflammations, extreme Burnings, Botch, Emerods, Scab, Itch, Leprosy, the
falling of the Thigh or Womb, and diverse others; And they speak of Diseases in
particular members of the Body, as in the Feet, in the Legs, in the Knees, in
the Bowels, in the Kidneys or Reins, in the Loins, in the Sinews, in the Bones,
in the Liver, in the Gall: From the sole of the Foot unto the Head no
soundness, Wounds, Bruises, putrefying Sores: And when the judicious and
industrious of the Medicinal Art will make Scripture collections about this,
they might find out many particular Rules there, which do direct unto proper
specific remedies. If I should cull out this one particular inward part of
Man's body, the heart, how many diseases and distempers is it subject unto, the
which no Philosophic Art can cure, such as the Passion or the Palpitation of
the Heart, the Wounding of the Heart, the Breaking of the Heart, the Piercing
of it, the Faintings, the Desolatings, the Wastings and Minishings, the
Throbbings and Beatings about of the Heart, so that it is even forsaking of a
Person, leaping awry and leaving its place and going out; the Languidness of
the Heart, the Frettingness of the Heart, the Troubles, the Terrors, the
Tremblings, the Despondings of the Heart; Its Dissolvings and Flowings away as
water, its sinking and falling: Its being moved as the Trees of the Wood are
moved with the Wind: Its melting as Wax, and softning through fear, its making
a noise like Pipes, its dyingness or perishing, its Astonishment or Stupor, its
Smiting or Striking of him or of her in whom it is: Its Madness, its sorrowful
Overwhelmings, its Leavenings, and Imbitterings, and Swellings: Its Groanings
with a rumbling roaring Noise, its excessive Heats as an Oven, and as a burning
Fire within it: Its being covered over with Grief: Its being blasted as
withered Grass: Its Wandering: Its staggering, its fluttering too and fro: Its
pains in its Walls, its being beset, straightened, and besieged: its unquietness
as the raging restless Sea: its boiling and working as Waters, that become
thick and miry when they are much stirred and troubled; Its heaviness; its
stooping as under an oppressing burden: Its astonishments and amazements, its
being struck as with an Hammer: Its being changed like as the heart of a Beast;
Its overgrownness, and oppressedness with Fat; Its Anguish; Its Despair; Its
Outcries, Its Plagues, Its Stonyness. Lam. 3. 65. (...)
Let me give one particular instance of an Heart-malady, which is one of the
most lamentable cases in all the book of the Lamentations: It is such a complex
distemper of heart, as has these dreadful things in it: grief and sorrow; such
grief and sorrow as does cover the heart all over; A cincture and compre^^ion
of Heart with deadly trouble and pain: such a covering grief and sorrow of
Heart, as is totally overwhelming and quite discouraging: It makes them even
quite to give over all hope. It is such an overwhelming grief; and discouraging
sorrow of Heart as has Obduration and obstinacy going along with it: It further
sets out the Hearts giving over of it self to its own overwhelming grief and
discouraging sorrow, with terrible fear of God's giving over of such to the
obduration and obstinacy of their heart, and of their being shut up under all
this, when such an Heart like a Buckler or Shield does keep off any blow or
stroke from the LORD's Word or hand, shutting it self up as within a Fence, so
that no counsels or comforts from Men can come at it. Whither can the diseased
send to any so skilful in the Medicinal Art as to open the Nature, Causes, and
Remedies of this one disease of the Heart? What shall I more say, if I can fill
up so many Lines with such a long Induction and large enumeration of particular
Heart maladies, which are so common in experience, and which no counsels and
prescriptions, but what are Scriptural, wisely applied, and duly received, and
well improved and followed, can either prevent or remedy: Is is not high time
for such as are serious in the Art Medicinal and are tender of the health and
lives of their Patients, and would lift up their Faces before a righteous Judge
at the last, when they must stand or fall for their Eternal Estate according as
they have walked by the Rule of the Word or not, I say, is it not high time for
them to study their Art and to practice it, in a Word-way? The Heart sick ones
might be referred to apt, pertinent, proper, Scriptures speaking directly to a
multitude of such cases. Shall I open a little of the maladies of the Soul in
Man? The Scriptures can inform us of the discouragement of the Soul: the grief
of the Soul; its bitterness; its outcryes; through wounding; its pouring out;
its Anguish, its sore vexings; its drawing nigh to the Gulphy empty space; its
afflictedness; its weariness; its being torn; its Consumptiveness; its being
spoiled; its need of healing; its being cast down; its making a tumultuous
stir, within a Man, its sinking; its being bowed down; its having of
overwhelming Waters to come into it; its refusing to be comforted; its being
filled with troubles: its being cast off; its breaking; its cleaving to the
Dust; its melting for heaviness: its faintings; its Imprisonments; Its being
bereft of good, its being removed far off from peace; its exceeding
sorrowfulness, its troubledness and drying away, its bowing down, its being
destroyed, its being pierced through, its being utterly cut off, its being
dispossessed or turned out of possession, its being devoured, its being
perverted, with such like evil effects of the Soul, this breathing part in Man.
And what can Philosophic Recipes do in these cases? Whither can we go for a
proper cure but to Christ in the Scriptures of Truth? Shall we consider the
spirit of Man a little, That Candle or Lamp of Jehovah in Man searching all the
Inner Chambers of the Belly? Oh how many are its distempers! In the Word we may
read of the trouble or shortnedness of the Spirit: the hardening of the Spirit,
its sadness, its being drunk up by poison, its unsteadfastness, its hastiness:
its having a breach in it (...) or its brokenness: its haughtiness, its
unrulyness, its sleepy distemper, its grievedness, its failing, or fainting,
its deep sighingness, its pressures, its being bound, its weaknesses, its
restless disquieting raging, its jealousies, its anguish, its overwhelmedness,
its perverseness, its Pride, its erringness, its vexing, and more such: Whither
now, to what Apothecaries Shop, to what Philosophical Doctor, will you send for
a cure of these? you must come to the word, and to him in and through the Word,
one of whose Names is, Exodus 15. 26. Deuteronomy. 28* 29, 35, 59, 60, 61. Ps* 147. 3.
and 107. 20.
the Healing^one of his people. In his Word there are not only spiritual
directions given about these inner distempers of Heart, of Soul, and of Spirit,
holy prescriptions and Heavenly counsels, but also diverse apt remedies are
pointed to from the con-created virtues which the LORD has put into several of
his creatures, when those who are reputed to be very learned in this Art, are
so far honored and used by the LORD, as to be made humble enough to be willing
to be better taught, and believers enough to judge God to be wiser then Man,
and Word-wisdom, and Truth to excel Philosophic Follies and falsities: the
Medicinal Art will then advance and flourish. There are many original words and
phrases, which do in a more general way direct unto health and to the recovery
of it out of sicknesss besides a distinct particular enumeration of several
diseases with their causes and curses, and several proper useful directions
about the choice of Meats and of Drinks, relating to the Regiment of health.
That distinction and division of Animals, of Fowls, of Beasts, of Fishes, into
clean and unclean, although it had a further Lev. 20. 25. 26. Acts 10. 12, 13,
15, 28. and 11. 6, 7. etc.
Typical shadowy figuring meaning under the Old Testament administration of
grace, leading them into an holy separation from unclean peoples, from
Communion with such they were many ways to abstain; yet withal a skilful Artist
in the History of Animals may find out natural natural reasons and causes for
such a discrimination: When spiritual reason does wisely exercise it self about
this discovery by Scripture, Nature, and Experience, it may discern clean
Animals to have a proper nutritive virtue, more wholesome and continuing and
increasing of health^ness, whereas, the unclean do more breed diseases, at
least they are not so healthful, whereby the All-wise Physician, the faithful
Creator has instructed his rational Creatures, and graciously at once provided
both for the health of Men's bodies, and for the salvation of their Souls: for
Meats do dispositively operate upon the mind, who may not see that has any
thing of a piercing eye, that some Animals are more ravenous and rapacious,
others are more luxurious and wanton, or more cruel and bloody, or more
gluttonous, or more fearful, or more filthy, or more muddy, or more choleric
and adust, or more excessively moist, with much more that might be added? and
do not these malignly influence upon those who make them their usual food? How
few are there of mankind, who do study their own complexions, constitutions,
temperaments, or what that is which is suitable food for them? Insomuch, as
that the most are even going into the other World before they know how to make
one good meal? but every thing is counted good with some that will fill their
belly, and any thing with others that will gratify their distempered
ungoverned appetite: whereas, he who has not due regard to his diet, for kind,
measure and season, will in time overturn his strength, overthrow his health,
and disease himself; and then the sick do feel the Mat. 9. 12.
need of a Physician or Surgeon; in which cases the Scriptures are not silent,
but would make them Medicinal Artists, and teach them practical skill. I have
not abilities and accomplishments for it, neither is it my profession to
undertake to set before the Reader an exact Treatise of the Medicinal Art,
though I question not but that it may be found out in the Holy Scriptures, and
in created Works according to those Scriptures. Let the principle be admitted
and pursued; and then much more would be discovered. As for the conservation of
health, the Learned in the Medicinal Art should search the Scriptures about the
use of some, and about the forbearing of other creatures, for Food, about the
kinds of bodily exercises, about the choice of Aromaticks, of Spices, of Olys,
of Wines, and many more, about the Regiment of passions and of affections, with
more directions that might be given; Such as the actings of suitable graces,
the enjoying of proper comforts, the improving of Holy Fellowship with Jehovah,
in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and more might be added, if advice from so
mean a one be received in the College of Physicians. There is a further part
of the Medicinal Art, which does respect the prolongation of days and the
lengthning along of Life, of which there is much in the Scriptures, both by way
of direction and of promise. He, that will industriously seek out where and how
often in the Word that expression of (...)
length of days, or prolongation of days, or long of days, and such like
phrases, that do set out this, is used, and will wisely observe, to whom and in
what way this is covenanted, may find much to this purpose and end: Then how
should we be under Christ, beholden unto such wise and faithful Physicians, as
would direct their patients for a cure to word prescriptions, where we might
pursue and follow their counsels in obedience and says, expecting Jehovah
Aelohim's blessing thereunto* and therefore for the augment and advancement of
this kind of Learning, let it be yet farther inquired, by men skilful in the
Original, and acquainted with the Giver of his Word, how that knowledge may be
perfected by a Scripture-discovery, which does respect the body of Man? For,
hereby many other useful Arts would receive a great increase, as the Art of
Medicine for the prolong^ng of the days of man, and for continuing on of his
life, in the conserving of his health, and in the preventing or curing of
Diseases; the Art of Surgery, the Art of the Apothecary and Compounder, the
Art of Optics and Perspectives, the Art of Sounds, the Art of Gust, the art of
Odors, the art of Tangibles; to mention no more: which a discerning eye may
look somewhat deep into at the very naming of them. Let a more narrow research
also be made into the Soul of man; Its Essence and Nature; Its Substance and
Operations; Its Offices and Products: How great its specific difference from
the Soul of Beasts. Let the Spirit of Man be more studied in the Word of Truth:
What its proper Existence is; what its specific Difference; what its
Faculties; what the Objects of those Faculties, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23.
wherein differenced from the Soul, whether separable from the Soul for some
time, yet so as the Body still lives, what its work is; what are the peculiat
seats in Man, for all the Faculties of the Soul and Spirit. How many those
Faculties are, what their Original, what their connaturalness; what all the
inward parts of Man are; what their league of amity and friendly commerce is,
one with another, and all together with the whole compositum? and a multitude
of other rare parts of this great Knowledge. I wait, if the LORD give me to
live to see, this glorious design to be received, promoted, and improved by
others: If so, I expect, that he will give men an heart willing to contribute,
what this way may be judged useful by such abler undertakers, who would
severally labor in a distinct handling of some particular Art and Science. O
how rare is the skill, how choice the Privilege, so to improve this part of
Experimental Christianity, as even here to pass more into growing beginnings of
that blessed State of the heavenly Glory, by a more holy and healthful
transforming likeness to the Humane Nature of Christ, in Spirit, in Soul, and
in Body! In every one of these to feel a suitable conformity in Holiness unto
Christ, as our great Exempar! John 6. 53, 54, 63, 64. Phil. 3. 20, 21.
It is a great thing to believe aright, that the Humane Nature of Christ is
then, and not till then actually profiting when quickened by the Spirit, making
Christ's Words to be Spirit and Life. Heb. 2. 16, 17, 18. and 4. 14, 15, 16.
Gal. 4. 19. 2 Cor. 3. 18. 1 Cor. 1. 30.
How great an Honor h^th he put upon Man, and how highly has he advanced the
Nature of Man, who has laid hold on the Seed of Abraham, and taken that to his
Godhead! He is one in Nature (as to his Humanity) with Believers; he has had
experience of all the Cases of Believers (sin only excepted): There is that in
him, that is suited to all the parts of Believers, in his Spirit, in his Soul,
in his Body, in his Nature, in his Life, for their Regeneration, Wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption, Acceptance, Strength, Joy, Comfort,
and every other Good: and his Humane Nature is a fitted Instrument of
conveyance of this spiritual suitable good to Believers, when so quickened by
the Spirit. There was a proper, a peculiar Testimony given by the Creator to
the Work of the sixth day: a special owning and commendation of that excelling
Masterpiece, Adam: Therefore Genesis 1. 31. Me^od.
there is a significant word added to Good, here, whereby is set out the
singular Good of this Part of the Creation: If this particular approbation were
given to all the Works of the Creation, in common to all the six days put
together, then the formation of Man will want its distinguishing Honor, and
its signal Remark: This special note of singular observation here does affirm,
and confirm it, as spoken of that which is well known, and evidently manifest:
As in all the Creatures, both singly and apart, collected and put together,
there was an excellency of Perfection in them, according to the capacity of
their Natures, and for the usefulness of their ends; so more particularly and
especially in man. Genesis 1. 31. (...).
There is an emphatick Note of Demonstration prefixed to this Sixth day,
pointing out the Work of that Sixth day to be somewhat more remarkable, and
that the adored Almighties had perfected all his Works, which he propounded and
purposed to create in the foregoing six days of this one Week of the created
World: It does show a thing known, and signally illustrious and commendable,
and that, that day only was the sixth day in the weekly Revolution, and no
other day of the Week: And that the weekly Sabbath must be reckoned, in order
of created Time, the immediately next succeeding day, after that sixth, which
weekly Sabbath day was when created, the seventh, the last day of the week,
that and no other day of the same week; Exodus 16. 11, 27, 29, 30.
which note of demonstration is remarkable in other Scriptures, to point out
the certian weekly Sabbathday in all the following Weeks of the World, in the
successive courses of Weeks, even the seventh, which is the last; for there is
but only one seventh day in one Week, progressively going on in the due order,
and according to the established Law of the Creation. All the Creatures were
not made at once, and in a moment; but there were distinct several days of
their being created, which Order should not be confounded, but well observed;
as one good help to profitable Meditation on Aelohim's Works. Particularly the
sixth day must not be forgoten, as the day of Man's creation; and as
preparatory to his Exodus 20. ^ (...).
remembering, and sanctifying of the seventh day, as the weekly Sabbath Day.
There was a separate Creation of things on several days, that man might, with
more stayedness of Spirit, and prosperingness of Soul, consider of them
distinctly. And now Jehovah Aelohim declares, Genesis 2. 1, 2, 3.
that, this* shall be the absolute perfecting, in the whole and in every part
of them, of those Heavens, and of this. Earth, and of all the congregated
Military Host of them, in their Order, Place and Function. Thus do all the
Creatures, both in the Heavens and in the Earth, stand as an Army in Order, or
an Host in Battle Isai. 45. 12. Psalm. 119. 91. Isai. 6. 3. Genesis 14. 19. Deuteronomy.

array; ready to serve their Makers, their Creators, who is their Commander in
chief, he is the LORD of Hosts, and the Empire over them is his: They go forth
or come in at the word of their Head-Captain, Jehovah Christ, as he will arm
and commission them, for his Friends, or against his Enemies.

In the order of my pursuit after the refining and raising of useful Arts, and
profitable Knowledges, I am now led to that day, the seventh, which is the last
Day in the first created Week, which first Week is, the just standing measure
of all after Weeks, in their successive courses, by the established Law of the
Creation; on which seventh Day Aelohim the Creator himself did Sabbatize: on
this Day he rested to contemplate his own Works: For, having now framed and
disposed the glorious Fabric, and the goodly Structure of the whole Universe,
and having put it into its beauteous economy, and regular Government, he
closes the whole of his Work with a Day Blessed above all the other foregoing
Days of the Week.

The Great Design of this Treatise, being the Advancement and Augment of useful
Arts, and of profitable Sciences in a Scripture-way, I shall propound some
serious Inquiries to ingenious, studious Believers, to ingenuous, diligent
Saints: Especially to such faithful, humble Ones, as have through Mercy and
Grace attained to larger growing measures of holy Skill in the Original
Languages, and of excelling eminence in Inner Religion, about the improvement
of Experimental Christianity.
Inquiries concerning Jehovah Aelohim, in Father, Son, and Holy Spirt.
Q. WHat is the true proper significancy of this great and glorious Name
Jehovah? And whether ought it not to be used? And what is there in those
Prophesies and Promises that do speak of the freer acknowledgement of this Name
in the later days? And how may a discerning Believer improve this Name, as for
many other holy uses and ends, so particularly to make his presence more real
and sensible, for continuedness to the Believer?

Q. What is the true import of all the other Names of God in the Scriptures,
particularly of Aelohim? And how may those be particularly improved.

Q. What are some of the most clear Testimonies, and convincing proofs of the
Doctrine of Father, Son and holy Spirit, and the Old Testament, which is so
fully and frequently taught in the New?

Q. What are the visional appearances and manifestations of Jehovah Aelohim, in
Father, Son and holy Spirit, in Heaven? And how may these be improved by a
Believer?

Q. Whether may the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit be distinctly prayed
unto? And if so, how should a Believer suitably make his application to each of
them distinctly; and to all of them jointly?

Q. What are the several Offices of the Father, as Father; of the Son, as Son;
of the holy Spirit, as holy Spirit, with relation to the Vovenant People of
Jehovah Aelohim? and whether is a Believers Union and Communion to and with the
Father, and the holy Spirit, as well as to and with the Son? and how is this?
and which way may it be better improved?

Q. What is the holy Spirits indwelling in a Believer? and what are the
Believers Dwelling in God? and how are these more improveable?

Concerning the LORD Jesus Christ Jehovah-man, the Mediator.
Q. WHen was it that Christ did first pass into his Mediatoral Office? and
after what manner was it? and of what good use is it to find out and improve
this?

Q. How may a Believer so enjoy Christ's Jehovah-presence here on Earth, as
withal at the same time to enjoy his Man-presence above in Heaven?

Q. Whether may a Believer actually resort in his spirit unto Christ's humane
glorified Nature, in any certain definite, circumscribed local Place, in the
highest Heavens?

Q. How is the humane glorified Nature of Christ a fitted Instrument, when
quickened by the Power and Life of the Eternal Spirit, for the actual conveyance
of all suitable good to Believers, according as their cases and capacities are?
And how may Believers apply what is in Christ's Spirit, Soul and Body, to their
own spirit, soul and body for proper supplies?

Q. How may a Believer so walk with God in Christ here, as if Christ were
visibly corporally present on Earth with the Believer? and how may a Believer
clear up, and improve a mutual in-being, in-living, in-dwelling, and in-abiding
between Christ and him?

Q. How is a Believers Life hid with Christ in God? and how may the Believer
enjoy and improve this, for his natural, spiritual and eternal Life?

Q. What are all Christ's Names, as Mediator in the Old Testament, as well as
in the New? And how may this be improved?

Q. How was Christ the first born of every Creature, or of the whole Creation,
and the beginning of the Creation of God?

Q. What is there improveable by a Believer in the order and connection of those
four things, when Christ is of God made to a Believer, Wisdom and
Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption?

Q. Whether this be not one great truth of the present Age, that Jesus Christ
is the one and the only LORD and Lawgiver over and to the Spirits, Souls and
Bodies of his people?

Q. Whether are not these amongst others some of Christ's Royal Prerogatives,
by his Mediatoral Authority, to grant and to pass acts of Grace, to seal and to
deliver particular Pardons, to speak Peace, and to give Comfort? and how may
this be practically improved.

Concerning the Word of God, the Word of Christ.
Q. Where is the true Authograph, or the Divine own first Writings of the
Original Scriptures? and where is the exact Apographs, or transcribed Copies of
this? And what Scriptures are there that do foretell and promise the restoring
of this wholly uncorrupted? And whether were not this a noble Work well
becoming the greatest, holiest Prince, to search out this, that he may write
him out a complete Copy of its Law?

Q. In what Language was the New Testament originally spoken and written?

Q. How may the Original Scripture Language be made the Universal Character,
all the inhabited Earth over?

Q. Whether would not an exact literal version of the holy Scripture, word for
word, as they are in their order, into the several Mother-tongues, without any
the least adding to, or substracting from it, open much of many useful Truths,
and necessary Duties, and of experimental Christianity, as well as many other
ways be very profitable for the promoting of peace and purity in the Churches
of Christ?

Q. Whether is it not a Duty for the people, especially such of them as have
more opportunities and advantages for this, to be able to read and to
understand the Word in its Original-tongue? And whether it would not be of
singular use to have the young capable Children in all places to be taught this?

Q. How may such an Hebrew Lexicon be so composed, for words and for phrases,
as to make Scripture knowledge to be much more easier and familiar to out
common people? in which they may find out all sorts of little Bibles well
fitted to all particular cases? where they may quickly see over, what the whole
scripture does speak to any subject matter, carrying Truth through all the Word?

Q. In what order of time, in exact Chronology, are the several Books of
Scripture, and the several passages in every such Book; And how may such
Geographical Tables of all the places of the inhabited Earth, mentioned in the
Scriptures, be so suited, as that time, and place, and inhabitants, may be made
obvious to every plain understanding?

Q. What is the New Testament, spiritual signified part of all and every of the
shadowy Figures, Ceremonial signs, and Typical patterns, through the Old
Testament?

Q. What is the Urim and Thummim? And whether is there any Prophecy or Promise
of either restoring of that, or of setting up any thing else in the room of
that? How may we have such an Oracle revived, as to have a certain, visible,
audibles; sensible, answer from the LORD, in weighty cases?

Q. Whether it be not one evidence of the fullness and perfection of the Word of
Truth, that even there where its speeches seem to be somewhat broken and
abrupt, it carries with it a secret supplement in experience, directed to all
practical cases concerned therein, which nothing else of man's word can fill
up? And whether would it not be very profitable and acceptable to put together
some of the more eminent remarkable Scriptures for the better evidencing of the
Truth and usefulness of this discovery?

Q. How may a Believer get and keep life, and power in the Word continued upon
his heart.

Q. What Scripture grounds are here, upon which to bottom Faith and Prayer,
that if there were a spirit of believing, the LORD would still give miraculous
access from Heaven, whereby to give sensible demonstrations of the Truth and
Goodness of his Word? And how may the Doctrine and Practice of Miracles be
revived?

Q. What is the method whereby to evidence the oneness and sameness, the well
agreeing consentingness, and uniform harmoniousness of the Christian Religion
throughout the whole Scripture, for Truth, for Laws, and for Privileges; For
Doctrines, for Duties, and for Graces?

Q. How may the plainest Scripture-Truths be raised to a greater height of
spiritual advancement?

Q. Whether now that Scripture-knowledge is so abounding, any one be so
competently well gifted for, and called to the Ministerial Office, who does not
understand the Scriptures in their Original Language? And how may hopeful
growing young men be so bred up in the Scripture Arts and Sciences as thereby
to be fitted for the Ministerial Office? And what Scripture grounds are there
to expect a more able, faithful, successful Ministry, than is yet at this day?

Q. Whether it be not one great Truth of this age, that the holy Scriptures
are the one and the only Rule to judge by in all cases? And whether there be
any other boundary to be set to men's pretended liberty of conscience.

Q. What is there of the Doctrine-part, as well as of the Duty-part, contained
in the Law of the ten Words?

Q. In what Method and Order may the Holy Scriptures be best read to most
spiritual profit?

Concerning present Providence, and Works of Jehovah Aelohim.
Q. WHat may the Reasons and Ends be, why the LORD in the present day, does
seem so much to with hold his Spirit, and the gifts and graces of that Spirit,
now that the longings and petitionings of his Churches and people are so much
heightened, and drawn out with expectations, of his larger pourings out of his
Spirit and Blessing upon his new Covenant people?

Q. What is more especially that Work which the LORD has been, and is still
carrying on upon the Wheels of his providence in this Age?

Q. What is there of Prophetical Scripture fulfilled in the present day, which
does make way for the further accomplishment of what Propheties are yet behind?
And what are those after Prophesies? And in what order of Time are all these
Prophesies?

Q. Whether though there have been some partial fulfillings of the Revelation,
in all Ages of the Church since John's time, yet will not the whole of that
Book of the Revelation be gone over in the latter days, visibly and sensibly
fulfilled, what John had in Vision, and by Voice? And whether are there any
beginnings of this in our Day and Time? At least whether Christ's Calls and
Counsels from his Father by his Spirit in that Word of the three first Chapters
of that Book, be not more especially and particularly to those gathered
separate Churches, who have someways withdrawn from the corruptions of the
Romish Way, more thoroughly to Reform and to Refine, and to be at perfecting
Work; As that which must lead the way to the bringing about of all the rest,
which does follow after?

Q. What and how does the LORD Christ in the way of his present Providential
Acting, reveal of the pattern and platform of his new spiritual House of the
latter day-glory, and of the Laws and Orders of that House? And, how is he now
with his golden measuring reed and rod and line in his hand, to try whether
particular Churches, and Disciples of his, do square well and exactly to his
Word-rule? And how would he have such societies to be rightly constituted,
gathered, admitted, disciplined, and orderly walking in all things, that such
Churches may be able to evidence to all the World, that they are the true,
owned, and approved Churches of Christ?

Q. How is Christ at work under this Providence, to bring every Institution and
Ordinance of his unto its Scripture purity and perfection, that they may be
felt and enjoyed more in the lively efficacy and saving power of them?

Q. How is Christ at work in this day, to frame his Churches and people to be
more of one heart and mind, and lip and way, in the Truths and things of God,
and to set them righter in the way of Sisterly association, of such purer
Churches? And how may a Believer see full home to this, through so much as is
quite contrary unto it, namely, the Heresies, Errors, Schisms, Divisions,
Apostasies, scandals, of the present Age?

Q. Whether is not Christ manifestly at refining perfecting Work under this
Providence? in regard that he does engage some of his servants in the same
Work, according to the Word, as their Generation work, to be purging out
whatsoever is corrupt, and to be bringing in whatsoever is pure, that is yet
defective, in principles or practice, among the Churches, more particularly, to
be perfecting those six principles spoken of in the two first Verses of the
sixth Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews? And whether this work have not
been too much hindered by some of Note, and of Name, in their expressing and
interpreting of perfecting, perfect, perfection, by sincere and sincerity,
whereas sincerity is but one Work of one of the ten Words?

Q. How would Christ under this Providence, have Nations, Cities, Parishes,
Villages, Families, and Persons, to be modelled as to the Rule of governing?

and promoting of the ends of every duty?

Q. How should a duty be well filled up?

Q. How should Bills or Papers of Cases be wisely and edifyingly managed that
are brought into our Congregations? And what is there in the Old Testament of
bringing suitable sacrifices to the Priest, according to particular cases,
which may give light to this matter? that it may be spiritually managed, under
this new dispensation of Grace?

Q. Whether may and must a Believer, pray, rejoice, and give thanks, not only
in all Cases, in all Places, amongst all Persons, but also at all Times, and
not only this, in state and in frame, but in acting also? And if so, how is
this attainable, practicable, and improveable? So to meditate upon Jehovah's
Word all the day? How is this, with such like expressions concerning other
duties, reconcilable with the finite Spirit of Man, who seems unto many to be
able to do but one Work at one time? Or, has Man a capacity of doing several
things at once? And if so, how may this be proved, and improved? Whilst the
Spirit may enquire, the Soul may desire, the Body may act and work, at the same
instant?

Q. How is the Truth in Jesus? and how should a Believer so learn the Truth as
it is in Jesus?

Q. What are the gradual differences in the matters of duties and of

Concerning other practical experimental Christanity?
Q. HOw may a Believer know distinctly, when it is, that it is his Spirit, or
his Soul, or his Body, which does long after Jeho^ah Aelohim? And of what use

to his Spirit, to his Soul, to his Body? And which way is this improveable?

Q. How may Convictions be kept alive, and improved?

Q. How may Christ in his Life, Suffering, Death, Resurrection and Ascension,
and in all his Offices, as also his Word, in the whole of it, and in all its
parts, commanding, prohibiting, prophesying, promising, threatening, and the
rest of it; how may these he used and improved,

For the more through mortification of corruptions, in all their secret,
deceitful, ^lie motions?

For the more triumphing, overcoming of Temptations in all their Methods, and
Devices, and Assaults?

Q. How may a Believer carry pure Religion and practical Christianity through
the whole of the conversation in the particular, as well as the general

other crosses, to be born, and improved, that when we suffer for Christ, it may
be a suffering with Christ, and as Christ suffered? And how may we in all other
things so walk as Christ walked, and so be in this World, as he was in this
World?

Q. How may we both give full time to our worldly employments, and necessary
business, and yet spiritualize it too?

Q. How may we get cut of deep-plunging distresses of spirit?

Q. How are we to treat our selves, and to converse with our selves, night and
day? And whether a translating of Hebrew Verbs of the self reflexive
conjugation, would not promote these self re^lecting meditations and acts?

Q. What are the Rules and Laws of Writing, especially in matter of
controversy?

Q. What may be the cause or causes of so much darkness and deadness, doubting
and distress, and of the holy Spirits withholding and withdrawing, in
Professors of Religion, generally in this day, that when they are discovered,
they may be removed?

Heaven? And when a receipt of Mercy is in answer to Prayer?

improved?

outward objects are to outward senses? And how should these spiritual senses be
exercised? And how should spiritual truths and things be made real, and future
ones present?

be led into it, and abide there?

Q. What is the right method of mutual Espousing and Covenanting, between
Christ and the Believer?

Q. What is the holy Art, and the Skill of Believers through submission to, and
contentful acquiescence in, the Sovereign Will of our LORD, when the Believer
is much oppressed by a body of Death, and by indwelling sin, and is held
somewhat short, under greatly enlarged desires, and very importunate endeavors
after abounding measures of excelling Graces, and after eminent serviceableness
and after the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God?

Q. Whether that Wisdom, Righteousness and Sanctification, which the LORD Jesus
Christ is made of God unto Believers, be not specially specific, and of a
distinct kind, from that which was concreated with and in the first Adam, and
from what is but the common work of the Spirit of Grace now? And how may this
be improved?

Concerning saving-Grace, and the sound evidences thereof.
Q. HOw may it be yet further cleared and proved, that saving and sanctifying
Grace in believing Christians, does specifically differ from the common virtues
of the civilized Heathen? And how is this to be improved?

Q. What is the spiritual Science of putting of saving Graces upon contributing
of mutual help to each other? And how does this call for all diligence, to be
brought over unto it? And what is the distinct Office, and the proper Work, of
every such grace in a Believer? What is the manner of their Influence upon each
other? What their Order, Government and Discipline?

Q. How should Graces wisely and suitably act toward Christ? and toward the
Word of Christ?

Q. Whether is it not enough for the clear sound evidencing of an holy State,
of saving and of sanctifying Grace, that we love nothing in preference, in
predominancy before Christ, or in equality with Christ, unless also we love not
any Creature at all inordinately, though inferiourly, as to any the least
competition with Christ? So that there must be a loving of the LORD with our
whole Mind, our whole Soul, our whole Heart, our whole Strength, and so too,
that he may not only have all our Love, our Loves, but we must also hate
whatsoever else it be, that would take off or hinder our through Discipleship
to Christ?

Q. Whether to choose God alone for our God above all; and to choose Christ for
our only LORD and Savior, which are very great, and largely comprehensive
Truths, Duties and Acts, have all other evidences of Grace, resolved only into
them, seeing that they both are properly but a part of one, even the first of
the ten Words?

Q. Whether is there any other general comprehensive sound, satisfying evidence
of Grace, but only an universal holy growing conformity in Knowledge and
Obedience in all things, for more continuedness, to an whole Christ, and to the
whole Word of Christ?

Q. When is Grace in its exaltation and triumph? And how should a Believer get
it up to this high pitch, and there keep it, use it, and advance it?

Q. How may and ought a Believer still, to grow up into Grace here, as the
glorified Saints are above; who are perfected into Grace? And will there be
every Grace in Heaven someways acted and exercised? And what is that obedience;

glorious inhabitants there, as if he were actually there?

Q. How may a Believer be in a continued readiness, and preparedness for Death,

the glorious Church in Heaven does?

somewhat proportionably answering to it out of the Old? And must not all and
every of the Types, under the old, pass into the Anti-types in the New?

Q. Whether perfecting work be to be asserted, promoted and practiced,
especially as to those six Principles, Heb. 6. 1, 2? and particularly, as to
the perfecting of Baptism in grown Believers?

Q. Whether the purer Churches of the later days should conform to the
Prophetical Pattern shown to Ezekiel, and to Christ's Directory, in his Epistles
sent to the seven Churches of Asia, revealed to John, as that which will make
way for the fulfilling of other Prophesies and Promises?

Q. Whether Christ always had, now have, and still will have a Church and
People somewhere or other in this World on Earth?

Q. Whether there be not different ages, degrees, forms, sizes, in the same
state of saving Knowledge, sanctifying Grace, and holy Experience? And whether
therefore those, who are in this holy State, must not be received, though they
be not as yet come up to the height of others?

Q. Whether it be enough, barely to be a true Church? Or should we not work up
to be such a Church, as Prophetical Scriptures relating to the purer Times of
the late days do call for?

Q. Whether Church-cases (as to Officers, and such like) in a time of
necessity, when better provision could not be made nor had, should still be
pleaded for, and born with, when there is no such necessity?

against, mortified and disciplined, which are the make^bates amongst Churches?
And what are those holy Frames and Duties, which would make much for the peace
of Churches?

Q. How may we so look upon all the late, and the present Church-divisions in
the glass of Scripture, as to discern spiritually how through the LORD's wise
gracious overruling, they shall issue into the Churches growing Purity and
Peace?

Q. Whether the Epistles to the Churches in the New Testament, do not contain
in them peculiar matter, wherein they are more especially concerned as

in the several passages of Paul's Epistles, where that subject matter is
treated of?

Q. Whether there be not some passages in Paul's Epistles, wherein he takes
upon him the person of an objector? And if so, what are those particular
passages? And when and where is it in the context of those places, that he
speaks as an answerer and asserter?

Q. Whether an exact literal version of the holy Scriptures, from their
Original Language into the several Mother-tongues, word for word without any
additions or substractions of men, would not through the LORD's blessing of it,
carry an healing uniting virtue, and efficacy along with it?

with, and whom, and what should they not bear with, according to the Rules,
Laws, Orders and Discipline of Christ's new spiritual House?

Q. In what a large sense is Christ the Head of every man? And in what a
special the Head of the Church?

Q. Whether are not spaces of duration to be warily and wisely distinguished
and divided? And how so? as what Jehovah's foreknowledge and Prede^erminations
were in and with himself, relating to his Creatures? When the Fathers
transactions were with his Son concerning his Sons great undertakings in the
Mediatoral Office? When and where, and in what order these great Mysteries were
revealed in the Word to Angels and Men? How all this is brought forth in time,
impressed on Hearts, and manifested by other Works of Aleohim?

Q. Whether if the same action be done, though upon different Principles, yet
should not the Peace of a Church or Churches be so far preserved? Or whether in
order to Church peace, is it not necessary to endeavor a nearer agreement in
Principles by those who coalesce in associated Church-societies? And whether
should not Principles be regulated by Scriptures, and not Scriptures
interpreted by Principles?

Q. Whether should there not be some peaceable meetings by agreement of
messengers, from the several divided Churches to debate how far they can walk
together in a brotherly association, and help one another by their mutual
advice and counsel in particular cases, without usurping of jurisdiction one
over another?

Q. Whether should not the Churches of Christ more especially keep close unto
Scripture Names of persons, and of things?

Q. Whether should not that due order of superiority, and of subjection, which
the LORD has established in his word, be more and better observed?

Q. Whether should not the proper place of the several links in the Golden
Chain of Love to God, to our selves, and to our neighbor, be duly and
diligently eyed for the stating and determining of practical Cases.
