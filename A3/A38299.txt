24. April. 1643.
WHereas the Lords and Commons in Parliament have made an Ordinance for the
more strict and solemn keeping of the days of public Fast, which are not by
all persons duly observed, even in these times of public calamity, to the
great dishonor of God, and the contempt of the Authority of both Houses of
Parliament. Now that more particular notice may be given unto all such as shall
offend herein, before any exemplary punishment be inflicted upon them; It is
ordered by the Commons now assembled in Parliament, That all Constables (or
their Deputies) shall the day before every public Fast, repair to every House
within their several and respective liberties, and charge all persons, That
they strictly observe the Fast, according to the directions in the said
Ordinance.

And they shall upon the said days of the public Fast, walk through their
said liberties, diligently searching for, and taking notice of all persons, who
either by following their work of their calling, or sitting in Taverns,
Victualling or Alehouses, or any other ways shall not duly observe the same;
And they are hereby required to return the Names of all such persons as they
shall find so offending, as also such Informations as they shall receive
against any other persons within their liberties, guilty of the like offense
unto the Committee for Examinations, that so they may be proceeded against for
the contempt of the said Ordinance; And all Constables are to observe these
directions from time to time, so long as the said public Fast shall be kept,
without expecting any further Order.
