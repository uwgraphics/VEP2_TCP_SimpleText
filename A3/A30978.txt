TO THE Reader.
Courteous Reader,
_^His is not a new, but an old approved Book (by the Authority and Advice of
some pious and learned persons) newly reprinted. So that there is no need of
any commendatory Preface, to court thee into a good opinion of it, or any
Apology for my self and this Edition; its own worth will justify the work. It
is no lying Legend, no vain Romance, no spurious or unlicenc'd-seditious
Pamphlet, but an Authentic History, of an impious and prodigious
Roman-Catholique See the Acts of Parliament, 3 Iacobi, cap. 4, 5. where this
Plot is truly called, (in the Body of the Act) An HELLISH Conspiracy of the
JESUITS and Seminary PRIESTS.
Conspiracy, of a Popish Powder Plot; containing the Examination, Trial, and
evidently-just Conviction and Condemnation of Popish Powder-Traytors; a Villainy
so black and horrid, (I do not say, unchristian only, but) so inhumane and
barbarous, as has no Parallel in any Age or Nation, (Jewish, Pagan, or Turkish)
nor indeed could have, before the Invention of Gunpowder, and the Unhappy
Institution Approbata and confirmata Societas Jesus, a Paulo Papa 3. Anno
Christi 1540. vide Bullam Pauli 3. data Romae Call: Oct. 1540. In Mag. Bullario
Romano. Lugd. 1655. Tom. 1. page 738.
of the Jesuitical Society, by (a See the Life of Ignatius Loyala, by Father
Ribadeneira, one of his own Society.
Fanatical Lame Soldier) Ignatius Loyola. For before that time, the World had
no Instrument or Means so pernicious as Gunpowder, and congruous for effecting
such a Mischief; nor any Order of Men so Impious, as to Approve, Design, and
Endeavor to execute a Villainy, so manifestly repugnant to the Law of Nature and
Scripture, to the undoubted Principles of Human Reason, and Divine Revelation.
I well know, that in these six last Centuries, the Pope and his Party, have
Murdered many thousand better Christians than themselves, (whom they are
pleased to miscall Heretics) by Vid. Council. Lateranum 4. sub Innocentio. 3.
Anno 1215. Can. 3. de Haereticis.
Armies raised, and highly encouraged to execute such Bloody and Unchristian
Purposes; by their Inquisitions and Premeditated Assassinations; as by their
own Authors may, and evidently does appear. One of them (and he an Historian of
good Antiquity and Credit) tells us, of Peremptus Haereticorum NUMERUS
INFINITUS. Math. Paris, in Hen. 3. ad Annum 1234. page 395.
An INFINITE NUMBER of Heretics, (the Innocent Waldenses he means) thus
Murdered. And a Learned and Pious Person says, (and Iac. Usserius Armach. de
Stat. and Success. Eccles. cap. 10.
proves it out of their own Writers) that in the space of 36 years, (and in
France only) 104747 of the same Waldenses, were inhumanly Slain, upon the same
Account. And in 60 Years, (as the Account is Dr. Crakanthorp, contra
Spalatensem. cap. 18. Sect. 19. etc.
made, and by the Testimonies of their own Authors proved) no less than 142990
of the same poor Innocent Christians (and in the same Country) were (by the
Pope and his Party) barbarously Murdered. And of later Times, (to omit all
others) a prudent and sober Roman Catholic tells us, Father Paul of Venice,
History of the Council of Trent. page 119, 120.
First of 4000 Waldenses, and then of 50000 Protestants cruelly slain, in the
same Country, by the Authority and Approbation Idem ibid. page 423. vid.

Gallia.
of the Pope and his Party, Drunk with the Blood of the Saints.

I confess, That those were impious and prodigious Popish Cruelties; yet such
as were not absolutely and immediately Pernicious, and destructive of the poor
Persecuted Christians. For,

I. When Armies were raised to ruin them, they had some time to Consult their
Security, to Fight, (if they were able) if not, to Fly, and so preserve their
Lives.

II. When they were caught, and called into the Inquisition, (and so to a
seeming Legal Trial) they had some time to make their Defense, at least to
Pray, and make their Peace with Heaven.

III. And the Execution of those Cruelties, was upon particular Persons, in
some Village, City, or Province.

But the Hellish Gunpowder Treason and Conspiracy (we are now speaking of)
contrived by the impious Subtilty of the Jesuits, (and their Associates) and to
be executed by the pernicious violence of Gunpowder, would have been (had it
taken the designed effect) a far more Secret and Sudden, a more Universal and
Compendious Villainy: All the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, all the Commons and
(horresco referens) the King Himself Blown up, and so Murdered in a moment:
That is, Not some particular Persons only, but the whole Kingdom Assassinated;
not in Effigy (as in some Countries, they hang Malefactors they cannot catch)
but in its Real Representatives, the whole Parliament of England. A Conspiracy
so Inhuman and Barbarous, of such Diffusive and Universal Mischief, as (before
that time) never was, nor would nor could have been Approved, Continued, and
Executed, without Gunpowder and Jesuits. But for a more full Discovery of this
Treason, I refer the Reader to the Book it self, and our public See the Acts
above cited. 3 Iacobi. cap. 4. and 5.
Acts of Parliament concerning it.

Yet to give him some further Satisfaction and Reason, for the second Edition
of this Book, let him be pleased to know:

I. That since the Happy Discovery of the late Damnable and Hellish Conspiracy,
(as the Two Houses of Parliament truly At a Conference of both Houses, Nov. 1.
1678.
call it) many Pious and Learned Persons, desirous to look back and consider
the particulars of the Gunpowder Plot (both Conspiracies being hatched and
hammered in the same Popish Forge, by the Jesuits and their Adherents) did
diligently seek after this Book, I now publish; but (above 70 years being
passed since the first Impression) they found it not; and therefore to satisfy
their Desires, and supply that Defect, it was thought convenient, and (as the
condition of the Kingdom now Stands, or Staggers) necessary to Re-print it.

II. Though the Gunpowder Conspiracy was hatched in Hell, and carried on with
all the Sworn Secrecy, and Impious Policy imaginable; yet (there being no
Policy against Providence, nor any Mischief so mysterious, as to be hid from
that All-seeing Eye of him with whom we have to do) the most gracious and good
God of Heaven and Earth, opportunely discovered that Traitorous Conspiracy, and
(in great Mercy) prevented the Mischief, intended to his People. This was a
Miraculous Mercy, never to be forgotten, but (with all gratitude) kept in
perpetual Memomory, by our whole Nation. God has so done his Mavelous Works,
Psalm. 111. 4. Vid. Esther 9. 28.
THAT THEY OUGHT to be had in REMEMBRANCE. When God delivered his People out of
Egypt, he Instituted the Passover, as a Memorial, that they and their Children
might for ever Exodus 12. 24, 26, 27.
Remember it. And when our Blessed Savior Redeemed us from (more than Egyptian
Bondage) the Slavery of Sin and Satan; he also Instituted a Sacrament, to help
our Infirmity, and be a Memorial of his unspeakable Mercy -- 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25.
DO THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME. All our Gracious God requires, or expects from
us, is a Grateful Memory and Acknowledgement of his Mercies; which is
impossible to be done, if we forget them. Seeing then, that this Book contains
an Authentic History of the great Misery and Mischiefs intended, and by
Popish Policy and Cruelty prepared for this Nation, and the unspeakable Mercy
of our most Gracious God preventing it. It was thought fit to Reprint it, as a
Memorial that Men might Read and Remember these Mercies, and Renew and Continue
their Gratitude for ever for them.

III. Another Reason why this Book was a second time Printed and Published,
was, That all, (who had a Mind and Time to read it, without Partiality and
Prejudice) might have Authentic Evidence to convince our Adversaries: who not
only in remote Countries beyond the Seas, but here in England, since His
Majesty's Happy Return, (and in Print) do endeavor (with a strange Confidence,
to give it no worse name) to persuade Men to believe, That the Gunpowder
Conspiracy was no Popish Plot, but Cecil's Contrivance. One of their late
Scriblers says indeed, That it was A HORRID PLOT; but adds, Calendarium
Catholicum: Or, An Universal Almanac, 1662. That Is the Title. But by that word
Catholicum, he means, a Roman-Catholique or Popish Almanac; for it is
calculated only for the Meridian of Rome, and is not Catholic in any other
sense. The words I cite, are in the 2d page, ad Annum 57.
That it was suspected, to BE POLITICKLY CONTRIVED BY CECIL. And then
afterward, toward the end of that Popish Calender or Almanac, he more
confidently says, That the Gunpowder Treason, was Idem ibid. in explication of
Holy Days set apart by Act of Parliament; near the end of that Calendarium
Catholicum, (or Popish Almanac) on the 5th of November.
MORE THEN SUSPECTED, TO BE THE CONTRIVANCE OF CECIL, the great Politician, to
RENDER CATHOLICS ODIOUS. He confesses (in both places cited, as well he
might) That SOME ROMAN-CATHOLIQUES were in that Plot. But there were but FEW
DETECTED, and they that were Detected, were DESPERADO'S. So that he would have
us believe, that it was not any Popish, but Cecils, (a Protestants)
Contrivance, and those Popish Desperado's (as he calls them) who were detected
in it, were by Cecil the Politician, drawn into that Conspiracy, to make
Catholics odious. It is almost impossible, that any Man who is not resolved
to believe, (or make others believe) a Lie, should profess and publish such
evident Untruths, in matter of Fact, against the Sense of a whole Nation, and
the public Acts and Declarations of King, Lords, and Commons in a full
Parliament. But (to me) it is no wonder, that they, who (for their mis-called
Catholic Cause) have confidence enough, impiously to Design, and (as far as
they are able) Execute such Prodigious Conspiracies, against their King and
Country, should have equal Impudence to deny them, when (for want of success)
they and their Unchristian Cause, are concerned in such Denial. And here when
this Popish Writer, (who otherwise was a Man of some Parts and Quality) says,
That there were only A FEW Papists DETECTED in that Popish Powder Plot. I shall
desire the Courteous and Impartial Reader to consider:

1. That they were not so Few, as he pretends; as may evidently appear, by the
following Book, which contains the Discovery, Conviction, and Condemnation, of
those Popish Traitors.

2. And considering, That this impious Conspiracy was Contrived and Carried on,
with so great and sworn Secrecy, taking Solemn Oaths, and the Sacrament upon
them (never intended for such impious Purposes) to conceal that horrid Design,
and their Practices in the prosecution of it: the wonder is not, that no more,
but that so many were detected.

3. But admit that a Few only, were Detected here in England, so as to
apprehend, and (as they well deserved) execute them for their Treason: yet it is
certain, that the damnable Powder Conspiracy was well known beyond Seas, to the
Popish Party, (especially the Jesuits) long before the happy discovery of it:
as out of Deltio, and some others of their own Writers has, and (when there is
an opportunity) may be made Manifest.

4. When that Popish Calendar (before cited) tells us, In the former place
quoted out of that Calendarium Catholicum.
That the Papists in the Powder Treason and Conspiracy, were DESPERADO'S, of a
Religion which DETESTS such Treasons. And afterward, In the second place above
cited out of that Calender.
That all SOBER CATHOLICS utterly DETEST that, and ALL SUCH ABOMINABLE
CONSPIRACIES. To this false Flourish, I shall only say,

First, That I confess, and easily believe, that those Gunpowder Traitors, were
indeed (what he calls them) DESPERADO'S, desperate Villains, else they would
never have undertaken, or acted in a Design so black, and (as he truly calls
it) Abominable Conspiracy, against their King and Native Country. And,
Secondly, If the Gunpowder Plot, was an Abominable Conspiracy, and they who
acted in it Desperado's, and not Sober Catholics, (as that Author pretends,
to excuse and free his Church from the Approbation and Guilt of that Horrid and
Damnable Conspiracy) then certainly those Great and Learned Popish Writers are
very much to blame, who in their Public (and by their Party generally
Approved) Writings, so highly commend those Gunpowder Traitors (and others of
their Faction, justly Condemned and Executed for High Treason) and tell us,
That they lived like SAINTS, and (although Condemned Traitors) DYED MARTYRS.
Father Parsons (a Man of a high esteem at Rome, and with his whole Society)
speaking of Garnet (Provincial of his Order, and a principal Gunpowder Traitor)
says, Parsons in his Book against the Oath of Allegiance, called, A Discussion
of the Answer of Dr. Barlow, etc. page 22, 23.
He was AN INNOCENT MAN, who SUFFERED INIUSTLY; That he lived A SAINTS LIFE,
and accomplished the same, with AN HAPPY DEATH, dying IN DEFENSE OF JUSTICE:
And yet it is evident, that he died for, and in Defense of that horrid and
damnable Gunpowder Conspiracy. So that (with them) Treason and Innocence,
Traitor, and Martyr, seem to signify the same thing. Nor is Father Parsons
only of this Opinion; for Petrus Petrus Ribadeneira, Catalogo Scriptorum
Societatis Jesus, Antverp. 1613. page 377. In Indice Martyrum.
Ribadeneira (in a Book published with Approbation and Authority) has reckoned
Garnet, Southwell, Oldcorne, etc. (Gunpowder Traitors) amongst the MARTYRS of
the Iesuitical Society. Nor do we envy them that Honor, but rather wish, that
all such Traitors were made such Martyrs. The same Author (in the same Book and
Index) reckons Campian (who was Justly executed for Camden's Elizabeth, in the
24th of her Reign, lib. 3. page 239, 240.
High Treason) amongst the MOST Edmundus Campianus MARTYR CHRISTI INCLYTUS, and
sui Seculi CLARISSIMUS.
RENOWNED and FAMOUS MARTYRS of Christ. And that I may neither trouble the
Reader, nor my Self, with more Testimonies, to prove a Truth notoriously known
to all, who know and impartially read their approved Authors; I shall only add,
what Bzovius tells us: who endeavoring (de industria, and data Opera) to Prove
the Popes extravagant Power to Depose Kings, and Absolve their Subjects from
their Oaths of Allegiance and Fidelity; he gives us, a Catalogue Abraham
Bzovius, de Pontifice Romano. cap. 46. page 611.
of about Thirty Kings and Princes deposed, or (by solemn Anathema's) Cursed
and Damned by the Popes; and Bzovius ib. page 619, 620.
cites about an 100 of their Learned and Eminent Authors, to prove and justify
it. Having done this, (speaking of Campian, the Gunpowder Traitors, and the
rest of their Popish Party, justly Executed here in England, for their
execrable Treasons and Conspiracies against their Prince and Country) he
further tells us, INNUMERABILES Anglicani MARTYRS, DUCEM Edmundum Campianum
Secuti, IDEM DOCUERUNT. Abraham Bzovius* ibid. cap. (...). page 62^. col. 1.
That an INNUMERABLE Company of English MARTYRS, following their CAPTAIN
Edmund Campian, taught THE SAME THING. That is, they taught the Popes Vast
Supremacy, and his pretended Power, (for there is no Shadow of Ground or Good
Reason for it) to Damn and Depose Kings, and Absolve their Subjects from their
Fidelity and and Sworn Allegiance; for to that end they are (by him) produced.
The Premises considered, I appeal to any Sober and Unprejudiced Reader, whether
such desperate, and (amongst them) approved and received Principles, will not
be a great and prevailing Encouragement to the Jesuits, and such other Popish
Fanatiques, to design and execute any Plot or Conspiracy, to Kill an
Excommunicate King; whom they believe to be an Heretic, divested of Majesty,
and all Royal Authority, and an Enemy to their Roman-Catholique Cause and
Church. So that if they should miscarry in any such impious Design and Popish
Conspiracy (as hitherto they have, and (by the Blessing of God) I hope they
ever will) yet they know they shall be highly honored by all their Party, and
be so far from having the Brand of Traitors (though the World well knows they
deserve it) that they will pass for SAINTS, stand in red Letters in their Roman
Calendar, and be Magnified for Martyrs. This encouragement they have to any
Plot or Conspiracy, (how impious soever) if it be against Heretics, and for
their Catholic Cause) from their received Principles, from their belief of
the Popes vast Supremacy and Infallibility, and their obligation to promote the
Catholic Cause. And (on the other side) they have no less encouragement, to
design and execute any Conspiracies against Protestants; whom they look upon as
the worst of Heretics, Enemies to God and their Church, to be So it is
declared in that great General (and with them) Iufallible Council, under Pope
Innocent 3. Council. Lateran. Anno 1215. Can. 3. de Haereticis.
persecuted (more Romano) with Fire and Sword, and not worthy to live in the
World. For certainly such an opinion (true or false) may, and will encourage
those who believe it, to endeavor the extirpation and utter ruin of all those;
who (in their judgment) are such impious and prodigious Villains. What opinion
the Popish Party (I blame not all, some I know, and I hope there be more of a
better Temper) generally have of Protestants (Prince and People) here in
England; I shall give you in the Words of a Popish Pamphlet, writ since His
Majesty's Happy Return, to poison the poor deluded People, with an hatred of
all Protestants, and their Religion. In that The Pamphlet has this Title, --
Miracles not ceased, by A. S. London 1663. it contains (as the Title tells us)
The MOST GLORIOUS MIRACLES, wrought by a Roman Catholic Priest, about London
and Westminster 1663. in confirmation of the HOLY ROMAN-CATHOLIQUE FAITH. And
the Priest is there called, A HOLY MAN OF GOD. Page 3. Sent by God to do
miracles, in confirmation of the holy Roman-Catholique Church, and her
doctrine. Page 15, 16.
Pamphlet, the Author is pleased to say,

1. That the Protestant Religion is a Cheat, Heresy, and HEATHENISME, page 3.

2. That the Protestant Bible, is no more the World of God, than the TURKISH
ALCORAN, page 4.

3. That the Protestant Bishops, Ministers, etc. are Cheaters, False Prophets,
and PRIESTS of BAAL, ib.

4. That they are ANTICHRISTIAN, Pseudo-Bishops, Sons Pope Pius V. calls them,
Improbos Concionatores, and IMPIETATUMADMINISTROS. In Bulla Damnationis and
Excommunicationis Elizabethae. Ann. 1570. Sect. 2.
of Iniquity, and Fathers of Mischief, ibid. page 16.

5. That our Protestant Religion, is RIDICULOUS and IDOLATROUS, page 17.

6. That all Protestant Bishops and Ministers, are Priests of Baal, MINISTERS
of SATAN, and ENEMIES OF GOD, and our Souls, page 32.

7. And (to make his Roman-Catholique railing complete) he there adds, That the
KING, (whom God preserve) and the PARLIAMENT were SECTARIES and HERETICS,
ibid. page 32.

These are his own words, and the Articles of the Impeachment which that Popish
Author brings against Protestants; and he further tells us, That he has CLEARLY
PROVED several of those Articles in another A little Book, entitled, The
Reconciler of Religion. So he calls it, Page 3.
Book of his own making, which he there cites. This he says, and possibly
believes, though he have little Reason for it; it being impossible, that he
should have any (much less a clear) Reason, to prove such Positions which are
evidently untrue. And here I shall crave leave to say,

I. That I do not wonder, that he (and other Popish Writers generally) should
speak so blasphemously against the Bible, and bitterly against the Protestants,
seeing it is evident, that there is no sort of Christians in the World, whose
Religion is so consonant to that Sacred Book, nor any Book so contradictory,
and (when it is seriously read and believed) so destructive of Popery, as the
Bible. Whence it is, that the reading it in any vulgar Tongue, is prohibited to
the People. The Trent Vid. Regulas de libris prohibitis, per Patres (...)
Trident. Synodo delectos concinnatas, and a Pio Pap. 4. comprobatas. Regul. 4.
in calce Concilii Tridentini per Phil. Labbe. Paris. 1667. page 233.
Fathers impiously and blasphemously saying, that if the People should read the
Word of God in a known Tongue, (which was John 20. 30, 31.
writ by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that Men might read, believe, and
be saved by it) it would PLUS IND^E DETRIMENTI. QUAM UTILITATIS ORIRI. Verba
sunt dictae Regulae 4.
be MORE MISCHIEVOUS than BENEFICIAL to them. Nay, it is manifest that (in their
opinion) the reading of the Gospel of our Blessed Savior Jesus Christ, in a
vulgar Tongue, would be more destructive of their Religion (as indeed it would)
for Divine Truth is more destructive of Error, than one Error is of another)
than the reading of the Turkish Alcoran in the same Tongue: whence it is, that
the Pope lately and publicly damned (d) Vid. Indicem Librorum Prohibitorum
Alexandri 7. jussu editum in quarto. Romae 1664. verbo Alchoranus.
their own Missall in French, and as publicly allowed and approved the reading
of the Alcoran in the same Language.

2. When he rails at, and reviles the King and Parliament, calling them
Heretics and Schismatiques; I desire to know, what Law, or Reason, or
Religion, he has to warant such reviling the Supreme (or any inferior) Power,
or Ruler of the People. His Roman Law and Religion (which allows the Deposing
and Murdering Kings by Poison, Pistol, War, or Powder Plots) may be his
Warrant; but sure I am, that such reviling of Kings and Ruling Powers, is
wholly condemned by the Laws of England, and the Laws of God too. To call his
King an Heretic (by our Law) is High Vid. Statut. 13. Elizabeth. cap. 1.
where it is High Treason to call the Queen Heretic.
Treason, or such a Crime, as brings upon the Criminal an incapacity Statutum
13. Caroli 2. cap. 1. and Croke' s Reports, part 2. page 38.
to have or hold any Place, Office or Promotion Ecclesiastical, Civil, or
Military; and besides, renders him obnoxious to such other punishments, (as by
the Common Law) may be inflicted. And for the Divine Laws, God (by Moses)
commands, Exodus 22. 28.
Thou shall not curse the Ruler of thy People. Eccl. 10. 20.
No not in thy Heart, (says Solomon.) St. Paul cites the same Mosaical Law (as
obligatory, under the Gospel, so that we may be sure, it is a natural and moral
Law) and (in other words) tells us, what is meant by Cursing in that place, to
wit, Blaspheming, or evil Speaking; for so he renders that place in Exodus.
(...). Acts 23. 5.
Thou shall not speak evil of the Ruler of thy People. St. Peter (though his
pretended Vicar does not) reckons them who 2 Pet. 2. 10.
speak evil of Dignities, amongst greater Sinners: So does St. Jude, Verse. 8,
9. and tells us, that Michael the Archangel DURST NOT bring any RAILING
Accusation against THE DEVIL. But now, not only See the Excommunication of
Henry VIII. by Pope Paul the III. and of Elizabeth by Pius V. where Luther's
called, PERDITIONIS alumnus. Our English Clergy, IMPROBOS, IMPIETATUM
MINISTROS. King Henry VIII. Haereticus and INSTIGANTE DIABOLO SACRILEGUS; for
alienating Abbey Lands; and yet Pope Julius III. Queen Mary, her Popish
Parliament and Convocation confirmed that Sacrilege. Vid. Statutum 1. and 2.
Mariae. cap. 8. If the Alienation of those Lands was Sacrilege in the King,
what was the confirmation of it for ever, by the Pope and a Popish Parliament.
Urbanus VIII. calls Luther, Monstrum teterrimum, and detestabilis pestis. Bulla
Canonizationis Ignatii Loyalae. Data Romae 8. Idus Augusti 1623. Sect. 1.
the Pope, but every little Popish Priest and Scribler, dare, and do that to
Christian Kings, and Protestant Divines, which the Archangel durst not do to
the Devil.

I do not think that any (who have not strong delusion, to believe a Lie) can
possibly believe, that the Protestant Religion is (what they call it) HERESY,
HEATHENISME, RIDICULOUS and IDOLATROUS. Or that the Protestant Bishops and
Clergy are ANTICHRISTIAN, MINISTERS of SATAN, ENEMIES of GOD, and PRIESTS of
BAAL. Yet I do think, that those who (against the greatest Evidence of Sense
and Reason in the World) can believe Transubstantiation and Manifest
Contradictions; may also (by a strong Roman-Catholique Faith) believe all the
aforesaid Untruths: and by that (though most erroneous) belief, be encouraged
to murder and utterly destroy all such, who (in their opinion) are Ministers of
Satan, Heretics, Enemies of God, and PRIESTS of BAAL; as also to believe,
that Action to be Just and Innocent, and (upon their own Belief and Principles)
have a concluding Argument to prove it thus; The Jews, by the approbation and
encouragement of Elijah, justly slew all Baal's Priests in the Old 1 Kings 18.

encouragement of the Pope, and a General Council. Lateranum 4. sub Innocentio 3.

Council, may destroy Baal's Priests, (for so they call all the Protestant
Clergy) in the New. As the Authority of Elijah (he being a Prophet, and
divinely Inspired) did both encourage and warrant the Jews; so the authority of
the Pope and Council (being, as they pretend, Synodo quemadmodum Spiritus
sanctus suggessit, decrevit. Council. Trident. Sess. 15. Principio. Sancta
Synodus, a Spiritu sancto edocta, declarat. Ibid. Sess. 21 cap. 1. etc.

assisted by the Holy Ghost and Infallible) may, and will encourage,
Roman-Catholiques (who believe the Pope and Council to be so assisted) and be
(to them) a sufficient Warrant to kill and destroy Heretics, (and all those
they call Enemies of God, and Priests of Baal. For what greater or surer
Warrant can they have, of the lawfulness and justice of such Designs and
Actions, than the Synodical Decree of the Pope and Council, whose Authority
they believe Supreme, and their Judgment infallible? Sure I am, that they are

taught to give an absolute obedience to all such Commands and Decrees of their
Church, without debating or doubting of their Justice or Legality: they are not
to dispute, but readily execute them; and if they be repugnant (as many times
they are) to their private Judgment and Senses too, yet they must renounce and
reject their Reason, and the evidence of their Senses too, captivate both to
the obedience of their Church, and without all scruple or doubting) do what She
decrees. Amongst the Directions and Rules given them, that they may believe as
the Church believes, these are Regula prima. Sublato O MNI IUDICIO proprio,
tenendus est SEMPER paratus animus ad obediendum verae Ecclesiae. (The Church
of Rome they mean) page 138. Regula 13. page 141. Sic habet -- Deteque ut ipsi

I. They are to remove and reject ALL THEIR PROPER JUDGMENT, and ALLWAYS have a
prepared and ready mind to OBEY the CHURCH.

II. And that we may be ALTOGETHER unanimous and conformable with the
Catholic Church; if She define any thing TO BE BLACK, which OUR EYES SEES
WHITE, we are in like manner BOUND to acknowledge that it is Black.

These Rules (together with Omnia ac singula in eis contenta. Bulla Pauli Papae
3. dat. Romae. 31 Jul. 1548. exercit. spiritual. Ignatii praefixa.
every thing contained in the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius) are not only
Approved and Received by the Jesuits; but being referred by the Pope to the
Cardinal of St. Clements (a Roman Inquisitor) to the Popes Vicar General, and
the Master of the Sacred Palace, these three greatMen highly approve and
commend them; (as the Pope Pietate and sanctitate PLENA, and ad A dificationem

EDIFICATION, and SPIRITUAL PROFICIENCY VERY PROFITABLE.

This is much, but not all. The Pope himself, their Supreme, and (if the
Jesuits and Canonists may be credited) infallible Judge, does OMNIA and
SINGULA in eis contenta, ex certa scientia nostra approbamus, collaudamus ac
communimus: Hortantes PLURIMUM OMNES and singulos, utriusque sexus Christi
sideles, ubilibet constitutos, ut tam Piis documentis uti, and illis instru^
devote velint. Verba sunt Bullae dictae, ib. page 5.
approve, commend, and confirm this doctrine, and that of his own certain
knowledge; and earnestly exhorts all Catholics, of all Sexes, and in all
Countries, that they would use these Documents, and be instructed by them.

Now this erroneous and impious (yet Roman Catholic) Doctrine, (so highly
approved and commended at Rome, even by the Pope himself) being granted; it is
no wonder, if the Jesuits and the Popish Party securely design and endeavor
the extirpation and utter ruin of Protestants, (Kings or Subjects) and all
those they call Heretics, with Fire or Sword, Poison or Pistols, Gunpowder
Plots, and any Conspiracies. For, although such actions (to all sober men, even
honest Pagans) are, and ever have been justly accounted prodigious Impieties;
yet to the Jesuits and Popish Party they are not so. For 1. They are so far
from believing such actions sinful, that when they are done out of zeal for
their Catholic Cause, and with the approbation of their Superiors, (which they
never want) they are (in their esteem) virtuous, and (which is more)
meritorious, as will appear hereafter. 2. But if such actions should (to their
own private judgments) appear to be (what indeed they are) impious; yet they
have been taught and learned this Lesson, That they must Regula 13. paulo ante
citata.
reject all their own reason (and sense too) and acquiesce in the judgment of
their Superiors; who (when they say, White is Black, and enjoin Villainies for
Virtues) must be submitted to, and (with Ut obedientia sit perfecta, quicquid
nobis injunctum fuerit, obeundo, OMNIA IUSTA ESSE, nobis persuadendo, OMNEM
sententiam ac IUDICIUM NOSTRUM contrarium, CAECA quadam OBEDIENTIA, abnegando.

is to be given to their Superior, as to Christ himself -- Qui obedit,

EGREDERETUR, ut OMNINO DIVINAE Majestati placere possit. Ibid. In Exam.
General. cum Declarat. cap. 4. page 37.
a BLIND OBEDIENCE) obeyed, and persuade themselves, that ALL THINGS ARE JUST
and LAWFUL which are commanded by their Superiors.

I know that the Jesuits, to hide and palliate the error and impiety of that
absolute and impious obedience, which (by their Rules and Constitutions) is
required of their Inferiors: and to make us believe, that they expect obedience
(and their Inferiors bound to give it) only in things just and lawful: They do
sometimes seem to give a sober Exposition and qualification of that universal
obedience they require of their Inferiors, thus: Inferiors must obey their
Superiors IN ALL THINGS; that is, In all things in which there is Obediendum in
OMNIBUS, in quibus NULLUM est MANIFESTUM PECCATUM. Constit. Societatis Jesu cum
Declarat. Antverp. 1635. part. 6. cap. 1. page 233. E^ ubi definiri non possit
aliquod peccati genus, intercedere. Ibid. page 234.
NO MANIFEST SIN.

But these are only Jesuitical frauds, and miserable shifts and Fig Leaves,
which may for some time, and from some, conceal their sin and shame, but
neither are, nor can be any just Apology to vindicate their Doctrine of
Obedience, and justify and free it from that impiety wherewith it stands
charged. For,

1. The Inferiors, according to their Vid. Regulas Servandas ut cum Ecclesia
vere sentiamus (superius citatus) 1. and 13.
Rules and received Constitutions) that his obedience may be perfect, must
renounce and reject all his own reason and sense, so far, that if he see and
know such a thing to be black and impious, yet if his Superior say, It is white
and virtuous, he (in contradiction to his own sense and reason) must both say
Obedientia sancta and perfecta, quod ad executionem attinet, tunc praestatur,
cum res jussa completur: quoad voluntatem, cum ille qui obedit, ID IPSUM VULT,
QUOD QUI IUBET: quoad intellectum, cum ID IPSUM SENTIT, quod ILLE QUI IUBET.
Constit. dictae cum Declarat. page 233.
and think so too. This is that Valde necessarium est, ut OMNES perfectae
obedientiae se dedant, Superiorem (QUICUNQUE ille sit) LOCO CHRISTI agnos^ntes,
and quae injungit, INTEGRE, PROMPTE, etc. S^ne excusationibus and

perfect obedience, which they commend to, and require of all Inferiors, to be
paid to any, to every Superior; and it must be entirely, perfectly, and readily
performed, without any excuse or murmuring. So that if the thing commanded by
the Superior do appear sinful to the Inferior, yet he must not believe what he
knows, but do what he is commanded by his Superior.

2. Those under command (by the Constitutions of that Society) must look upon
their Superiors, as persons in the Ibid. dicta page 123. and page 152. and part

Fratres Lusitanos. sect. 4.
CHRISTI VICARIOS, and Ibid. sect. 3. and sect. 11.

observe, that by this Jesuitical Divinity, or Polity, (call it what you will,
you cannot mis-call it, unless you call it just and true) every Superior in the
whole series of that Society, is the Vicegerent and VICAR OF CHRIST, and to be
obeyed by his Inferiors, as well as the Pope himself. How the Pope will like
this, I neither know nor care; but sure I am, that a learned Spaniard, and
Alphonsus de Vargas Toletanus is the man I mean; and the Title of his Book is
this, Relatio ad Reges and Principes Christianos, de Stratagematis and
Sophismatis Politicis Societatis Jesus, ad MONARCHIAM ORBIS terrarum SIBI

zealous Papist, has both said, and (by evident instances) proved, that (to
gain the Monarchy of the World to themselves) the Jesuits are both Innovators
in matters of Faith and Religion, rebellious and perfidious to the Pope as well
as Secolar Kings and Princes.

3. And having declared their Superiors to be Gods Vicegerents and Vicars of
Christ, they further say, that their Superiors are Superior, cui nos, ut Dei
vicem gerenti, and DIVINAE VOLUNTATIS INTERPRETI, moderandos tradidimus.

Superiors is to be Summarium Constit. Societat. Jesu. sect. 31. page 17.
Antverp. 1635.
THE RULE of theirs, and to be in all things obeyed. And this absolute, blind,
and impious obedience to their Superiors, Ignatius, the Founder of that
Society, highly approves and commends to them, telling them, That whether their
Superiori non ideo obtemperandum, quod divinis donis ornatus si^, sed ob id
solum, quod vices gerat Dei. Si prudentia MINUS valeat, non ideo QUIDQUAM DE
OBEDIENTIA REMITTENDUM, quia illius person^m resert, cujus sapientia falli non
potest; SUPPLEBIT enim IPSE QUICQUID MINISTRO DEFUERIT; sive PROBITATE,
aliisque ORNAMENTIS CAREAT. Ignatius Epist. 1. De virtute Obedientiae ad
Lusitanos. sect. 3. page 13.
Superiors be wise or foolish, honest or impious, yet they are equally to be
obeyed, as they are GOD'S VICEGERENTS, who is infallibly wise, and will supply
their want of understanding AND HONESTY too. So that (by thi^ Divinity) let
their Superiors be never so simple, sinful, and impious, yet their Inferiors
may securely obey, and do WHATSOEVER they bid them. And this he thinks (which
no wise man would) he has clearly proved out of express Scripture, Matthew. 23.
2, 3. Our Savior (says he) when he had said, The Scribes and Pharisees sit in
Moses chair; he adds, WHATSOEVER therefore they say unto you, that observe and
do. If the Jesuits say, they succeed those Jews (the Scribes and Pharisees) in
Moses Chair, then they might (though without all sense and consequence) argue
for themselves, as they usually do for the Pope, jure successionis, thus: The
Pope sits in Peter's Chair, therefore he is as infallible as he; and whatsoever
he says must be observed. (Thus Pope Agatho argues, and it is by Sic OMNES
Apostolicae sedis SANCTIONES accipiendae sunt, tanquam ipsius DIVINI PETRI ORE
firmatae sint. Can. Sic omnes. 2. Did. 19.
Gratian registered, and Bulla Romae data 1 Jul. 1580. Juri Canonico praefixa.
by Pope Gregory the 13th. confirmed for Law.) So they argue for the Pope; and
so with equal reason (yet ridiculously) the Society might argue, (as Ignatius
does, a bold Soldier, but a very bad Disputer) for themselves, thus -- We
succeed the Scribes and Pharisees, and sit in Moses Chair: Therefore whatsoever
we say must be observed. But I suppose they will not say, that they succeed the
Scribes and Pharisees, (whose corrupt Doctrine, and impious Manners, our
Blessed Savior so often, and so justly Matthew. 16. 6. 12. and Matthew. 23. 16.
17, 18.
condemns, and against whom he Matthew. 23. 13, 14, 15, 16. 23. 25, 27, 29.
pronounces many sad and deserved woes.) And if they deny (as sure enough they
will) that they succeed those impious and heretical Scribes and Pharisees; then
their Founder's reason is worse, and (if that be possible) more ridiculous,
being only this -- WHATEVER those Jews (Scribes and Pharisees) said, sitting
in Moses They sat in Moses Chair (as Interpreters of his Law) and therefore
whatever they taught the people, which was consonant to the Law and mind of
Moses, was to be observed, otherwise not. And therefore our blessed Savior
bids his Disciples beware of their Doctrine, (as well as of their Manners.)
Matthew. 16. 12.
Chair, was to be observed: Ergo, WHATEVER those Christians (the Superiors of
the Jesuits) say, who do not sit in Moses Chair, must be observed; Sed apage
nugas, Apinasque tricas. Such stuff as this, is neither worthy to be proposed,
nor seriously confuted: nor had I troubled the Reader (or my self) with any
Answer to it, had not (in their esteem) so great a Saint and Soldier as
Ignatius, so confidently urged it; and lest they might think or say, (as
sometimes they do) That such Arguments, because they were not, could not be
answered.

Well; but though Ignatius his Reasons are weak, yet his Faith is strong, and
(without any good reason, or concluding premises) he firmly believes his
Position, (That his Society must give blind and absolute obedience to all the
commands of their Superiors.) and earnestly Especially in his Epistle Ad
Fratres Lusitan^s, De Virtute obedientiae. Dat. Romae 7. Call. Aprilis, Anno
1553.
presses all his Society to believe and practice it. And since his decease,
(whether induced thereunto by his Authority, or their own Interest, for they
neither have, nor can have any true Reason for a false Position, I know not) I
say, since his decease, his Society have approved, They have approved and
received Ignatius his Epistles, his Exercitia Spiritualia, etc. in their
Instituta Societatis Jesus. Ant. 1635.
received, and industriously vindicated his Doctrine of Obedience. For (to give
you a short sum of what they say.)

1. He and they agree, that Inferiors (to the end they may have that perfect
obedience which they require) must renounce and utterly reject all their own
Regula. 1. and 13. Superiuscitata. Necesse est, ut omnes perfectae obedientiae
se dedant, Superiori obediant, licet difficilia, and secundum sensualitatem (i.
e. sensum) repugnantia jubeat: veram abnegationem propriae voluntatis and
judicii habeant. Summarium Constitutionum, sect. 31. page 17.
WILLS, JUDGMENT, and SENSES; so far, that, if their Superiors say, Snow is
black, they must believe, and say it is so too, though their Senses see it is
white.

2. Nay, they must not only renounce, but (as their Founder Ignatius says)
mortify, kill, and slay their own Wills and Judgments, by their obedience.
Ignatius Epist. 2. De Perfect. Religiosa: Romae, 4. Non. Mart. 1547.
Per obedientiam voluntates vestras ac judicia MACTATE, etc. So that Inferiors
Sibi quisque PERSUADEAT, se FERRI ac REGI DIVINA PROVIDENTIA per Superiores;
and sinere debet, ac si CADAVER esset, quod QUOCUNQUE versus ferri, QUACUNQUE
RATIONE, Tractari se sinit: vel ut senis BACULUS, qui UBICUNQUE, and QUACUNQUE
in re velit eo uti, qui eum manu tenet, ei inservit. Constitut. cum Declarat:
part. 6. sect. 1. cap. 1, page 234.
must PERSUADE themselves, that it is DIVINE PROVIDENCE which moves and rules
them by their SUPERIORS. And therefore they must be like DEAD CARCASES, or a^
SLAVES in the hand of their Superiors, which suffer themselves to be MOVED,
HANDLED, and CARRIED WHITHER, and WHAT WAY THEY PLEASE. The Inferior is not
permitted to consider, examine, or try, whether the commands be just, and
(according to the Will of God) lawful; but they Quae Superior injungit,
INTEGRE, PROMPTE, and SINE EXCUSATIONIBUS OBEDIANT. In Summario Constitut: quae
AB OMNIBUS observandae sunt, sect. 31. page 17. and Constitut. part. 3. cap. 1.
sect. 23.
must execute and obey them, and that ENTIRELY, READILY, and BOLDLY.

3. And the commands of their Superiors is to be Proposita voluntate and
judicio Superioris, PRO REGULA suae voluntatis and judicii. Dicta, sect. 31.
page 17.
THE RULE both of their WILLS and JUDGMENTS; and they are bound to believe,
that (whatever the thing enjoined be) HE COMMANDS Quod jubetur, BEEN IUBERI
EXISTIMET. Constitut. cum Declarat. part. 6. cap. 1. page 234.
WELL, and that all the things enjoined are QUICQUID nobis injunctum fuerit,
obeundo, OMNIA JUSTA esse, NOBIS PERSUADENDO. Ibid. page 233.
JUST and GOOD; and so good, that NOTHING BETTER could be done; nor God better
pleased with any thing his own Sic enim obediens rem QUAMCUNQUE, cui eum
Superior velit impendere, Debet exequi; PRO CERTO HABENS, quod ea ratione
potius, quam re alia QUAVIS, quam PRAESTARE POSSIT, propriam voluntatem and
judicium diversum sectando, DIVINAE VOLUNTATI respondebit. Ibid. page 234.
Will or Judgment could suggest, different from the command of his Superior.

4. And lastly, it is all the reason in the world, that they should give such
absolute obedience to their Superiors, were their Principles true, (which are
indeed evidently erroneous and impious) for they say, (as is before observed
and proved) that every Superior is a VICEGERENT, and VICAR OF CHRIST; that his
Inferiors are to look upon him as such, and obey his commands, as the commands
Ad Superioris VOCEM PERINDE, AC SI A CHRISTO DOMINO EGREDERETUR, quam
promptissimi simus, requavis relicta. Dicto Summario Constitut. sect. 34. page
18.
of JESUS CHRIST.

The premises considered, I think we have very much (too much) reason to
believe, that while there are Jesuits in England, Superiors (such as the Pope,
their General, Provincial, etc.) to command, and Inferiors to obey, it is
impossible our Gracious King, or his Protestant Subjects should be safe, unless
they repent, and renounce their impious Principles, and bloody Practices,
(which is impossible, whilst they believe those true, and these just) or the
good God of Heaven and Earth do (as hitherto in great mercy he has) by a
powerful Providence discover and defeat their Conspiracies. For as it is
notoriously known to this, and other Nations; that during the times of Queen
Elizabeth, King James, Charles the Martyr, and our Gracious Sovereign now
happily restored, they have impiously designed and endeavored, by open War, by
Poison and Pistol, Gunpowder Plots, and horrid Conspiracies, to destroy our
Princes and our Religion; So we have little reason to doubt, but while there
are such Persons, possessed with a belief of such principles, they will
continue to Design, and (when they have ability and opportunity) execute such
damnable, and (to Protestant Princes and People) destructive Conspiracies. I
would not wrong the meanest Jesuit (were it in danger) to save my life; nor
will I conceal their principles (dangerous to our Country and Religion) though
(what I do not fear) I lose it. For this were basely to betray my Religion and
my Country too; things which are, and (to all good men) ever should (and will)
be more valuable than a thousand Lives. Give me leave therefore (courteous
Reader) to add, not what I, but what the Jesuits say of themselves and Society.
And here,

1. Father Campian (who though hanged at Tyburn for High Treason, yet at Rome
is reputed a famous Martyr) tells us, -- Iesuitas OMNES in universo terrarum
orb, FOEDUS, ad REGES Haereticos QUOVIS MODO TOLLENDOS, jam pridem iniisse.
Quod (inquit) ad Societatem nostram attinet, velim scias, OMNES NOS, qui sumus
de Societate Jesus, per totum terrarum orbem long lateque diffusi, SANCTUM
FOEDUS iniisse, vestras machinas facile superaturos, neque unquam desperaturos,
quamdiu vel UNUS QUISPIAM e nobis supererit. Ita Campianus Jesuita, in Epist.
ad Consiliarios Reginae Angliae, Treveris Excusa Ann. 1583. page 22. And
Hospinian, who cites it, in his Historia Iesuitica, page 264. (it should be
246.) adds what Creswel the Jesuit says in his Philopater, (I take it upon his
word, for I have not my Books about me) Ita informandos QUOSCUNQUE CATHOLICOS,
ut oblata CAEDIS OCCASION, NULLO IMPEDIMENTO se dimoveri patiantur. They must
kill Kings (if Heretics) when they have opportunity.
That ALL THE JESUITS in the world have long since entered into Covenant, ANY
WAY TO DESTROY all Heretical KINGS; nor do they despair of doing it
effectually, so long as any one Jesuit remains in the world.

And Father Creswel (if Hospinian cite him right, for in this place and time I
have not the Book about me) in his Philopater, tells us, That ALL CATHOLICS
are to be so instructed, that when they have an opportunity to kill Heretics,
they should not suffer any impediment to hinder them. So that if you say, In
facinus jurasse putes; That the Jesuits are entered into a Covenant to kill and
destroy all Heretical Kings, you wrong them not, for you say no more than they
themselves in print and publicly confess.

2. And this we may the rather believe, because (according to their belief and
principles) if they do this, if they murder a thousand Heretics, (Kings or
Subjects) it is no mortal sin in them. For they Vulgo certe hoc Jesuitae
faciunt, ut cum in Societatem pueros alliciunt, in hoc meliorem Societatis
suae, quam aliorum Ordinum conditionem esse praedicent, quod Ignatius a Deo
precibus obtinuerit, ut per 100 Annos inde ab eo die, quo Regulam ejus seeds
Apostolica probavit, NEMO SOCIORUM IN LETHALE PECCATUM INCIDERE QUEAT. Cujus
privilegii prorogationem, Xaverium in alios 200 Annos a Deo Societati
impetrasse, ab hinc triennium JESUITAE IN ALSATIA PLENIS BUCCIS GLORIABANTUR.
Alphons. de Vargas Toletanus in Relat. de Stratag. Jesuitarum. cap. 14. page
39. Edit. 1636. and page 110, 111. Edit. 1642.
say, (and by that motive seduce many young Novices into their Society) that
they cannot commit any mortal sin: For Ignatius their Founder, by his Prayers
obtained that privilege for them, that for an 100 years (beginning from the
confirmation of his Order) none of his Society should commit any mortal sin;
and their great Saint Xaverius procured the continuance of that privilege for
200 years longer. So that (by this account) since the year of our Lord 1540.
(when the Jesuits The Bull of Pope Paul 3. which confirmed that Society, is
dated 1 Call. Oct. 1540. In magno Bullario Romano, Lugduni. 1655. Tom. 1. page
740.
Order was confirmed) to the year 1840. the Jesuits neither have, nor can
commit any mortal sin, if it be true that they have such a privilege, which
they publicly affirm, not only to the common people, but to Cardinal
Francisco Quo minus autem apud pueros and adolescentes rerum imperitos, eos
talia quis jactare admiretur, I PSO FRIDERICO BORROMAEO Cardinali non
dubitarunt TALI SE PRIVILEGIO VENDITARE, etc. Alphon. de Vergas. ibid. cap. 14.
It Is true, the Cardinal did not believe them, (as certainly no wise man will.)
Borromaeo non persuaserunt, verum etiam ita eum sibi alienarunt, ut in posterum
nec visos, nec auditos vellet, quemadmodum Amicis non semel fassus est, etc.
Idem ibidem.
Borromoeo, as a Learned Author tells me, and he no Hugonot or Lutheran, but a
zealous Spanish and Romish Catholic. How great encouragement this may give
them to kill all Heretics, (it being so much for the Catholic cause, and
their temporal interest, and no morta^ sin) it will highly concern all
Protestant Princes, and their good Subjects, seriously and timely to consider.

3. But as for this privilege from all mortal sin, which Cardinal Borromoeus
did not, nor is it possible any (who has not strong delusion to believe a lie)
should believe; yet to the Jesuits, who do believe it, and teach their
Inferiors (who are bound to obey them) to do so too; it must of necessity be a
great encouragement of them to commit any crime, how great soever, seeing that
by that privilege (let them do or say what they will) they are secured from
any Mortal sin; and for their Venial sins, (if there were any such) they may
put them into Purgatory, but (if their own approved Principles be true) they
cannot hinder them from Heaven and Eternal Happiness. But let this be as it
will, there is another thing, which may give all Protestants just cause to
fear, that the Jesuits will be very ready to design, and (when and where they
are able) execute any villainy, by Poison, Pistol, Gunpowder Plot, or any
traitorous and black Conspiracy, for the destroying and extirpation of all
Heretics, (especially Protestants) and that thing is, the exceeding corruption
of their Manners, and Personal impieties. For the worst of men will be most
willing (without fear or reluctance) to commit the greatest wickedness. Now as
for the Personal wickedness and impieties of the Jesuits; I neither do, nor can
say any thing upon my own knowledge, (being not at all acquainted with their
conversation) but I shall produce such Witnesses, as are without exception, and
may challenge and deserve credit; I mean, all the Universities of Spain,
(Venerable Corporations and Bodies of Men, and they not Heretics, but learned
and zealous Roman Catholics) who in a Book (or Remonstrance against the
Jesuits) printed and given to the King of Spain, give this Character of the
Jesuits -- Academiae Hispaniarum libello ad R^gem misso, typisque descripto,
Iesuitas sic describunt, ut homines pal^m avaros, insatiabiles, Aeruscatores,
Regiorum vectigalium fures, arrogantes, ambitiosos, Principum assentatores,
Aulicos, and negotiis secularibus ubique se implicantes, fraudulentos,
mendaces, veritatis interversores, inf^matores virtutis, vitae Religios^
host^s, deliciarum amatores, Impostores pi^tatis velo opert^s, lupos
investimentis ovium, Novitatum Amicos, Sanctorum Doctorum contemptores, Lutheri
and Calvini partiarios, ac de Haeresi suspectos, pacis publicae perturbatores,
Diabolicae industriae homines, Serpents, ipsosque Cacodaemones, ac ab omnibus
cav^ndos ac fugiendos. Alphon. de Vargas Toletanus de Stratagematis Jesuitarum,
page 37, 38. Edit. 1642. and page 15. Edit. 1636.
That they are men notoriously covetous, insatiable, COZENERS, Thieves, and
stealers of the Kings Revenue, arrogant, ambitious, flatterers of Princes,
Courtiers, every where intangling themselves in secular businesses, fraudulent,
liars, corrupters of truth, defamers of virtue, enemies of a Religious life,
lovers of pleasure, impostors under a veil of piety, Woolves in Sheeps
clothing, lovers of novelties, contemners of the holy Doctors, partners with
Calvin and Luther, and suspected of Heresy, troublers of the public peace,
men of Diabolical industry, Serpents, and very Cacodoemons or evil Spirits, of
whom all should be aware and fly from them.

This Character of the Jesuits is none of mine, it is a Spanish History, not my
calumny of them. I do, and shall pray for them, that if they be guilty of all,
or some of this, (as I fear they are) God Almighty would be graciously pleased
to give them true penitence and pardon too. What Answer they have given (or can
give) to this accusation (which has been public, and in print above 40 years)
I know not, I have not yet heard of any. In the mean time, I shall desire the
Reader to consider the quality of the Witnesses, who charge them with so many
and enormous crimes. 1. They are no Protestants, (or any they do or dare call
Heretics) but Papists. 2. Nor they simple Persons, but Corporations, and
Bodies of men. 3. Nor they Townsmen, and mere Laics, so that it might be
thought, they did it out of hatred or envy; according to the Gloss in their
Canon Law, Laici sunt Clericis oppido infesti; but they are great and learned
Bodies of men, Universities. 4. Nor some few of them, but many; All the
Universities of a great Kingdom. 5. And that a most Catholic Kingdom, very
zealous for the Pope and Popery, to wit, Spain. 6. Nor is it any private
Testimony, given in some particular Court, but public, exhibited to their King
in print, and so to the World. 7. Lastly, they witness against persons they had
great reason and opportunities to know, living amongst them, and having
continual conversation with them, and so must needs be Testes idonei, most
competent Witnesses against them. And therefore Protestants have very great
reason and evidence to believe, that the Jesuits are such persons, as their own
Party, by such Authentic Testimonies, prove them to be.

The premises considered, that is, the Principles, the Persons, and
Encouragements the Jesuits have to seek the ruin and destruction of all
Protestants, (Princes and People) the advice of the Universities of Spain will
(to all prudent men) seem very reasonable, That persons of such Principles (Ab
omnibus sunt cavendi, and fugiendi, (I may add) fugandique) should be with all
care and caution avoided, and banished out of all Protestant Countries; it
being morally impossible (as sad experience shows) they should enjoy peace and
safety long, where such restless Spirits (encouraged and resolved to endeavor
their ruin) do remain.

But besides these (peculiar to the Jesuits) there are more and greater
encouragements (common to them and all the Popish Party) to design and
endeavor the extirpation of all Heretics (especially Protestants, who, in
their account, (and truth) are most dangerous to their erroneous and
superstitious Novelties) and the ruin of the Protestant Religion. For Pope
Innocent the Third, (and his General Council) promised those Soldiers (Cruce
signati, or Crusado's, as they called them) who having assumed the Character of
the Cross, were armed for the extirpation and destruction of Heretics, with
fire and sword, the same Catholici qui crucis assumpto charactere, ad
Haereticorum EX^ERMINIUM se acci^xerint, illa gaudean^ Indulgentia, illoque
Privilegio sint muni^, quod accedentibus ad terrae sanctae subsidium

privileges they had, who went to fight against the Turks and Sarazens, to
recover the Holy Land. Now the Privileges granted to those Soldiers sent
against the Turks, (to omit several Temporal advantages granted them for that
service) were especially and principally two.

greater degree and measure of it hereafter.

And here I shall desire the Courteous Reader to consider, 1. The excellency of
the Reward, Grace here, and Glory hereafter. 2. Who it is that promises all
this; the Pope, and a great, and (by them) approved General Council. 3. The
assurance and certainty they may have of enjoying what is promised, arising from
the Authority and Infallibility of the Pope and Council, who make the Promise;
whose Authority and Judgment is, and to all Papists, (unless they will deny
their received Principles) Supreme and Infallible. 4. And seeing so glorious a
reward is (by such Authority) promised for murdering Heretics, they may be
assured, that the doing it is (at least) innocent and lawful; unless they will
confess (which would overthrow the foundation of their Religion) that the Pope
and General Council may be guilty of so great an error and impiety, as to
promise Heaven for impious and unlawful actions, which neither do nor can
deserve any thing but Hell and Damnation. 5. Many things may be, and are
lawful, which are not necessary, nor (in some times and circumstances)
expedient. But this destroying Heretics with Fire and Sword, (according to the
Popish Principles) is not only lawful, but a necessary duty, (which upon pain
of Excommunication and a Curse) they are bound to do. For (by the Decree of
Pope Innocent and his General Council) all Secular Supreme COMPELLANTUR
Potestates seculares cujuscunque officii, ut praestent PUBLIC juramentum, quod
de terris suae jurisdictioni subjectis UNIVERSOS Haereticos ab Ecclesia
denotatos, exterminare studeant: ita ut amodo quandocunque quis fuerit in
potestatem spiritualem seu temporalem assumptus, hoc tenetur capitulum
affirmare. Council. Lateran. 4. dicto. Can. 3.
Powers are to be COMPELLED to take an Oath PUBLICLY to extirpate all
Heretics; and not only Supreme Powers, but all Inferior Powers and
Governors, Ecclesiastical and Civil, are to take such Oath. So that (being
bound both by the Decree of the Council, and a Sacred Oath to do it) it must of
necessity be a Duty, which they are bound to do; that is, to destroy all
Heretics: and that so necessary a duty, that if Kings were but Si dominus
temporalis requisitus ab Ecclesia, terram suam purgare NEGLEXERIT ab Haeretica
pravitate, excommunicationis Vinculo innodetur; and si satisfacere neglexerit
infra Annum, significetur summo Pontifici, ut ex tunc ipse vassallos suos ab
ejus fidelitate denuntiet absolutos, and terram exponat Catholicis occupandam.
Dictum Council. dicto Can. 3.
NEGLIGENT, and did not presently do it, they were to be Excommunicated; and if
they did not give satisfaction within a year, it was to be signified to the
Pope, that he might presently depose them, and absolve their Subjects from
their Oaths of Allegiance, and give away their Kingdoms to Catholics, who
would be bloody, obey the Pope, and destroy Heretics.

By the premises it does (to me, and will, I believe, to many more) seem
evident, that the murdering Heretical, Protestant (for at Rome they are
believed and declared Heretics) Excommunicated Kings and Subjects, is not
only, 1. A lawful Action; but 2. in the judgment of the Church of Rome, a
necessary duty, (at least in sometimes and cases) though to all other sober
Christians a damnable sin: And 3. such a meritorious duty, as shall have
remission of sins here, and a higher degree of Glory hereafter: 4. And the
doers of it shall (in their Popish Calendars and Martyrologies) be rendered to
posterity, not for (what indeed they are) impious Murderers, but glorious
Martyrs. Now how great encouragement such impious Principles and Promises may
give those, who have faith enough to believe them, to contrive and attempt any
villainy, for the Catholic Cause, and utter extirpation of all Protestants,
(whether Princes or People) times past are, and (unless the gracious and
powerful Providence of Heaven prevent it) future times may be sad witnesses.
Certainly, traitorous and horrid Gunpowder Conspiracies, murdering innocent
Christians, (even Kings and Princes) causa indicta and inaudita, neither is,
nor can be a just means to obtain Indulgences, Remission of sins, and the Crown
of Martyrdom. Traitors may be Murderers, but surely no Martyrs: such villainies
(however approved, and highly rewarded by the Pope and his Party) may be a
Roman, but no Christian way to Heaven. However, all those unhappily deluded
Souls, who believe (as all the through-pac'd Papists do and must) the Pope and
Councils Infallibility, and power to make good their promises, will (as
hitherto they have) be willing to design and endeavor the destruction of all
Heretics, (all Protestants to be sure, whether Kings or Subjects) either by
raising Armies, open War and Rebellion, (when they have ability) or by
Assassinations, by Pistol or Poison, or Gunpowder Conspiracies, when they have
it not, (as I pray, and hope, they never will) I trust, that the infinitely
wise and powerful Providence of God, which (for the time past) has graciously
preserved our Princes and Religion, and discovered and defeated all the black
and impious Conspiracies of their Popish Enemies, will (for the future, if our
ingratitude and impenitence do not hinder it) continue that preservation, to
the comfort of his Church, and confusion of her Enemies: Former favors
thankfully received from God, being sure pledges and assurances of future.

To conclude; When the impious designs of Rome (which had been working ever
since the Reformation) did not prosper; when they could not (though cunningly
and constantly endeavored) either by Poison, Pistol, or open War, take away
Queen Elizabeth, to bring in Mary Queen of Scotland; when they saw King James
in quiet possession of the Imperial Crown of England, and saw his Learning and
Love to the truly Catholic and Apostolic Faith of the Church of England, to
be such, that they despaired (as well they might) ever to be able to seduce him
into a belief of their new Trent Creed, and Popish Superstitions: they had no
more patience, (loesa patientia fit furor) but resolved (by a new and unheard
of Villainy, a Gunpowder Conspiracy) to take away and murder him, that seeing
he would not be for their Religion, he should not be able to be against it. But
that which increased the despair of the Jesuits, and the Popish party, and
their rage and fury against that good King, (their lawful Sovereign) was a
solemn and pious Protestation, made by the He made that Protestation 12 Feb.
Anno Iacobi 2. Anno Christi 1604.
King, before the Lords of his Court, and by them publicly declard to all the
Judges, the Lord Chancellor of England, the Bishops and Great Officers of
State, in the Star Chamber. By which they plainly perceived, that as their
Religion was never like to have the King's personal approbation, so he would
never grant any TOLERATION of it to any others. That Protestation of that
learned and wise King, because it is worthy of perpetual memory, (though now
almost forgot) and the knowledge of this present Age, and all Posterity, I
shall here faithfully set down, as I find it in our Authentic Records. The
occasion of that Protestation was this, Some of the discontented Puritan party
had set a foot a scandalous report of the King, THAT HE MEANT TO GRANT A
TOLERATION TO POPERY. This highly offended his Majesty, and, in contradiction
to it, and confutation of it, he publicly made this solemn Protestation, See
Judge Croke's Reports, London, 1659. Part 2. Anno Iac. 2. page 37. And before
that Sir Fran. Moor's Reports, page 755. where (in Law-French) we are told,
That the King's Protestation was made to the Lords at Court Feb. 12. and (by
them) to all the Judges and Lords in the Star Chamber on the 13. of February,
Iacobi 2.
THAT HE NEVER INTENDED TO GIVE ANY TOLERATION TO POPERY; AND THAT HE WOULD
SPEND THE LAST DROP OF BLOOD IN HIS BODY, BEFORE HE WOULD DO IT, etc. That God
Almighty would be graciously pleased to preserve and bless His Sacred Majesty,
and the whole Royal Family; and discover, and (by his powerful Providence)
defeat all the impious Conspiracies of their Enemies, that they may enjoy
health and peace here, and Heaven hereafter; This is, and, (as in Duty and
Loyalty I stand bound) while I live, ever shall be, the constant prayer of,

A SPEECH Made by King JAMES to both Houses of Parliament, upon occasion of the
discovery of the Gunpowder PLOT; designed to be executed on the 5 Nov. 1605.
MY Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and you the Knights and Burgesses of this
Parliament; It was far from my thoughts, till very lately, before my coming to
this place, that this Subject should have been ministered unto me, whereupon I
am now to speak. But now it so falls out, That whereas in the preceding
Session of this Parliament, the principal occasion of my Speech was, to thank
and congratulate all you of this House, and in you, all the whole Commonwealth
(as being the representative Body of the State) for your so willing, and loving
receiving, and embracing of me in that place, which God and Nature by descent
of Blood, had in his own time provided for me: So now my subject is, to speak
of a far greater Thanksgiving than before I gave to you, being to a far greater
person, which is to GOD, for the great and miraculous Delivery he has at this
time granted to me, and to you all, and consequently to the whole Body of this
Estate,

I must therefore begin with this old and most approved Sentence of Divinity,
Misericordia Dei supra omnia opera ejus. For Almighty GOD did not furnish so
great matter to his Glory, by the Creation of this great World, as he did by
the Redemption of the same. Neither did his Generation of the little World, in
our old and first ADAM, so much set forth the praises of GOD in his Justice and
Mercy, as did our Regeneration in the last and second ADAM.

And now I must crave a little pardon of you, That since Kings are in the word
of GOD it self called Gods, as being his Lieutenants and Vicegerents on earth,
and so adorned and furnished with some sparkles of the Divinity; to compare
some of the Works of GOD the Great King, toward the whole and general World,
to some of his Works toward Me, and this little world of my Dominions,
compassed and severed by the Sea from the rest of the Earth. For as GOD for the
just punishment of the first great Sinner in the original world, when the Sons
of GOD went in to the Daughters of Men, and the cup of their iniquities of all
sorts was filled, and heaped up to the full, did by a general deluge and
overflowing of waters, baptize the World to a general destruction, and not to
general purgation (only excepted Noah and his family, who did repent and
believe the threatenings of God's judgment:) So now, when the World shall wax
old as a Garment, and that all the impieties and sins that can be devised
against both the first and second Table, have, and shall be committed to the
full measure; GOD is to punish the World the second time by Fire, to the
general destruction and not purgation thereof. Although as it was done in the
former to Noah and his Family by the waters; So shall all we that believe be
likewise purged, and not destroyed by the Fire. In the like sort, I say, I may
justly compare these two great and fearful Dooms-days, wherewith GOD threatened
to destroy me, and all you of this little World that have interest in me. For
although I confess, as all mankind, so chiefly Kings,, as being in the higher
places like the high Trees, or stayest Mountains, and steepest Rocks, are most
subject to the daily tempests of innumerable dangers; and I amongst all other
Kings, have ever been subject unto them, not only ever since my birth, but even
as I may justly say, before my birth, and while I was yet in my Mothers belly:
yet have I been exposed to two more special and greater dangers than all the
rest.

The first of them, in the Kingdom where I was born, and passed the first part
of my life: And the last of them here, which is the greatest. In the former, I
should have been baptized in blood, and in my destruction, not only the
Kingdom, wherein I then was, but ye also by your future interest, should have
tasted of my ruin. Yet it pleased GOD to deliver me, as it were, from the very
brink of death, from the point of the dagger, and so to purge me by my thankful
acknowledgement of so great a benefit. But in this which did so lately fall
out, and which was a destruction prepared not for me alone, but for you all
that are here present, and wherein no rank, age, or sex should have been
spared; This was not a crying sin of blood as the former, but it may well be
called a roaring, nay, a thundering sin of Fire and Brimstone, from the which,
God has so miraculously delivered us all. What I can speak of this, I know
not: Nay rather, what can I not speak of it? And therefore I must for horror
say with the Poet. Vox faucibus haeret.

In this great and horrible attempt, whereof Three miraculous events be to be
observed in the Attempt
the like was never either heard or read, I observe three wonderful, or rather
miraculous events.

First, in the cruelty of the Plot it self, wherein cannot be enough admired
the horrible and fearful cruelty of their Device, 1 The cruelty of the Plot.
which was not only for the destruction of my Person, nor of my Wife and
Posterity only, but of the whole Body of the State in general; wherein should
neither have been spared, or distinction made of young nor of old, of great nor
of small, of man nor of woman: The whole Nobility, the whole Reverend Clergy,
Bishops, and most part of the good Preachers, the most part of the Knights and
Gentry; yea, and if that any in this Society were favorers of their
Profession, they should all have gone one way: The whole Judges of the Land,
with the most of the Lawyers and the whole Clerks: And as the wretch himself
that is in the Tower, does confess, it was purposely devised by them, and
concluded to be done in this house; That where the cruel Laws (as they say)
were made against their Religion, both place and persons should all be
destroyed and blown up at once. And then Three ways how mankind may come to
death.
consider therewithal the cruel form of that practice: for by three different
sorts in general may mankind be put to death.

The First, by other men, and reasonable creatures, which is least cruel: for
then both 1. By Man.
defense of men against men may be expected, and likewise who knows what pity
GOD may stir up in the hearts of the Actors at the very instant? besides the
many ways and means, whereby men may escape in such a present fury.

And the Second way more cruel than that, is by Animal and unreasonable
creatures: for 2. By unreasonable creatures.
as they have less pity then men, so is it a greater horror, and more unnatural
for men to deal with them: But yet with them both resistance may avail, and
also some pity may be had, as was in the Lions, in whose Den Daxiel was thrown;
or that thankful Lion, that had the Roman slave in his mercy.

But the Third, which is most cruel and unmerciful of all, is the destruction
by insensible 3. By insensible things.
and inanimate things; and amongst them all, the most cruel are the two
Elements of Water and Fire; and of those two the Fire most raging and merciless.

Secondly, How wonderful it is when you shall think upon the small, or rather
no 2. The small ground the Conspirators had to move them.
ground, whereupon the Practisers were enticed to invent this Tragedy. For if
these Conspirators had only been bankrupt persons, or discontented upon
occasion of any disgraces done unto them; this might have seemed to have been
but a work of revenge. But for my own part, as I scarcely ever knew any of
them, So cannot they allege so much as a pretended cause of grief: And the
wretch himself in hands does confess, That there was no cause moving him or
them, but merely, and only Religion. And specially, that Christian men, at
least so called, Englishmen, born within the Country, and one of the specials
of them, my sworn Servant, in an Honorable place, should Practice the
destruction of their King, his Posterity, their Country and all: wherein their
following obstinacy is so joined to their former malice, as the fellow himself
that is in hand, cannot be moved to discover any signs or notes of repentance,
except only, that he does not yet stand to avow, that he repents for not being
able to perform his intent.

Thirdly, The discovery hereof is not a little 3. Miracu lous event, the
discovery.
wonderful, which would be thought the more miraculous by you all, if you were
as well acquainted with my natural disposition, as those are who be near about
me. For as I ever did hold suspicion to be the sickness of a Tyrant, so was I
so far upon the other extremity, as I rather contemned all advertisements, or
apprehensions of practices. And yet now at this time was I so far contrary to
my self, as when the Letter was showed to me by my Secretary, wherein a general
obscure adverisement was given of some dangerous blow at this time, I did upon
the instant interpret and apprehend some dark phrases therein, contrary to the
ordinary Grammar construction of them, (and in another sort then I am sure any
Divine, or Lawyer in any University would have taken them) to be meant by this
horrible form of blowing us up all by Powder; and thereupon ordered, that
search to be made, whereby the matter was discovered, and the man apprehended:
whereas if I had apprehended or interpreted it to any other sort of danger, no
worldly provision or prevention could have made us escape our utter destruction

And in that also, was there a wonderful providence of God, that when the party
himself was taken, he was but new come out of his house from working, having
his Firework for kindling ready in his pocket, wherewith as he confesses, if
he had been taken but immediately before, when he was in the House, he was
resolved to have blown up himself with his Takers.

One thing for my own part have I cause to thank GOD in, That if GOD for our
sins had suffered their wicked intents to have prevailed, it should never have
been spoken nor written in ages succeeding, that I had died ingloriously in an
Alehouse, a Stews, or such vile place, but mine end should have been with the
most Honorable and best company, and in that most Honorable and fittest place
for a King to be in, for doing the turns most proper to his Office; And the
more have We all cause to thank and magnify GOD for this his merciful
Delivery. And specially I for my part, that he has given me yet once leave,
whatsoever should come of me hereafter, to assemble you in this Honorable
place; And here in this place, where our general destruction should have been,
to magnify and praise him for Our general delivery; That I may justly now say
of mine enemies and yours, as David does often say in the Psalm, Inciderunt in
foveam, quam fecerunt. And since Scipio an Ethnic, led only by the light of
Nature, That day when he was accused by the Tribunes of the people of Rome, for
mispending and wasting in his Punick wars the Cities Treasure, even upon the
sudden brake out with that diversion of them from that matter, calling them to
remembrance how that day, was the day of the year, wherein GOD has given them
so great a victory against Hannibal, and therefore it was fitter for them all,
leaving other matters, to run to the Temple to praise GOD for that so great
delivery, which the people did all follow with one applause: How much more
cause have we that are Christians to bestow this time in this place for
Thansgiving to GOD for his great Mercy, tho we had had no other errand of
assembling here at this time; wherein if I have spoken more like a Divine, than
would seem to belong to this place, the matter it self must plead for mine
excuse: for being here come to thank God for a Divine work of his Mercy, how
can I speak of this deliverance of us from so hellish a practice, so well, as
in language of Divinity, which is the direct opposite to so damnable an
intention? And therefore may I justly end this purpose, as I did begin it with
this Sentence, The mercy of God is above all his works.

It rests now, that I should shortly inform you what is to be done hereafter
upon the occasion of this horrible and strange accident. As for your part that
are my faithful and loving Subjects of all degrees, I know that your hearts are
so burnt up with zeal in this errand, and your tongues so ready to utter your
dutiful affections, and your hands and feet so bent to concur in the execution
thereof, (for which as I need not to spurr you, so can I not but praise you for
the same:) As it may very well be possible, that the zeal of your hearts shall
make some of you in your speeches, rashly to blame such as may be innocent of
this attempt; But upon the other part I wish you to consider, That I would be
sorry that any being innocent of this practice, either domestical or foreign,
should receive blame or harm, for the same. For although it cannot be denied,
That it was the only blind superstition of their errors in Religion, that led
them to this desperate device; yet does it not follow, That all professing that
Romish Religion were guilty of the same. For as it is true, That no other sect
of Heretics, not excepting Turk Jew, nor Pagan, no not even those of Calicute
who adore the Devil, did ever maintain by the grounds of their Religion, That
it was lawful, or rather meritorious (as the Romish Catholics call it) to
murder Princes or people for quarrel of Religion. And although particular men
of all professions of Religion have been some Thieves, some Murderers, some
Traitors, yet ever when they came to their end and just punishment, they
confessed their fault to be in their nature, and not in their profession,
(These Romish Catholics only excepted:) Yet it is true on the other side, That
many honest men blinded peradventure with some opinions of Popery, as if they
be not found in the questions of the Real presence, or in the number of the
Sacraments, or some such School-question: yet do they either not know, or at
least, not believe all the true grounds of Popery, which is indeed, The mystery
of iniquity. And therefore do we justly confess, that many Papists, especially
our forefathers, laying their only trust upon Christ and his Merits at their
last breath, may be, and oftentimes are saved; detesting in that point, and
thinking the cruelty of Puritans worthy of Fire, that will admit no salvation
to any Papist. I therefore thus do conclude this point, That as upon the one
part many honest men, seduced with some errors of Popery, may yet remain good
and faithful Subjects: So upon the other part, none of those that truly know
and ^elieve the whole grounds, and School-conclusions of their Doctrine, can
ever prove either good Christians, or faithful Subjects. And for the part of
foreign Princes and States, I may so much the more acquit them, and their
Ministers, of their knowledge and consent to any such villainy, as I may justly
say, that in that point I better know all Christian Kings by my self, that no
King nor Prince of Honor will ever abase himself so much, as to think a good
thought of so base and dishonorable a Treachery: wishing you therefore, that
as GOD has given me an happy peace and amity, with all other Christian Princes
my neighbors (as was even now very gravely told you by my L. Chancellor) that
so you will reverently judge and speak of them in this case. And for my part I
would wish with those ancient Philosophers, that there were a Crystal window
in my breast, wherein all my people might see the secretest thoughts of my
heart, for then might you all see no alteration in my mind for this accident,
further than in those two points. The first, caution and wariness in
government: to discover and search out the mysteries of this wickedness as far
as may be: The other, after due trial, Severity of punishment upon those that
shall be found guilty of so detestable and unheard of villainy. And now in this
matter, if I have troubled your ears with an abrupt Speech, undisgested in any
good method or order; you have to consider that an abrupt, and unadvised Speech
does best become in the rela^on of so abrupt and unorderly an accident.

And although I have ordained the Proroguing of this Parliament until after
Christmas upon two necessary respects: whereof the first is, that neither I
nor my Council can have leisure at this time both to take order for the
apprehension and trial of these Conspirators, and also to wait upon the daily
affairs of the Parliament, as the Council must do. And the other reason is, the
necessity at this time of diverse of your presences in your Shires that have
Charges and Commandments there. For as these wretches thought to have blown up
in a manner the whole world of this Island, every man being now come up here,
either for public causes of Parliament, or else for their own private causes
in Law, or otherwise: So these Rebels that now wander through the Country,
could never have gotten so fit a time of safety in their passage, or whatsoever
unlawful Actions, as now when the country by the foresaid occasions is in a
manner left desolate, and waste unto them. Besides that, It may be that I shall
desire you at your next Session, to take upon you the Judgment of this Crime:
for as so extraordinary a Fact deserves extraordinary Judgment, So can there
not I think (following even their own Rule) be a fitter Judgment for them,
then that they should be measured with the same measure wherewith they thought
to measure us: and that the same place and persons, whom they thought to
destroy, should be the just avengers of their so unnatural a Parricide: Yet not
knowing that I will have occasion to meet with you my self in this place at the
beginning of the next Session of this Parliament (because if it had not been
for delivering of the Articles agreed upon by the Commissioners of the Union,
which was thought most convenient to be done in my presence, where both Head
and Members of the Parliament were met together, my presence had not otherwise
been requisite here at this time:) I have therefore thought good for conclusion
of this Meeting, to discourse to you somewhat anent the true nature and
definition of a Parliament, which I will remit to your memories, till your next
sitting down; that you may then make use of it as occasion shall be ministered.

For albeit it be true, that at the first Session of my first Parliament, which
was not long after mine Entry into this Kingdom, It could not become me to
inform you of any thing belonging to Law or State here: (for all knowledge
must either be infufed, or acquired, and seeing the former sort thereof is now
with Prophecy, ceased in the World, it could not be possible for me, at my
first Entry here, before Experience had taught it me, to be able to understand
the particular Mysteries of this State:) yet now that I have reigned almost
three years amongst you, and have been careful to observe those things that
belong to the Office of a King, albeit that Time be but a short time for
experience in others, yet in a King may it be thought a reasonable long time,
especially in me, who, although I be but in a manner a new King here, yet have
been long acquainted with the office of a King in such another Kingdom, as does
nearest of all others agree with the Laws and Customs of this State.
Remitting to your consideration to judge of that which has been concluded by
the Commissioners of the Union, wherein I am at this time to signify unto you,
That as I can bear witness to the foresaid Commissioners, that they have not
agreed nor concluded therein any thing, wherein they have not foreseen as well
the Weal and Commodity of the one Country, as of the other; So can they all
bear me record, that I was so far from pressing them to agree to any thing,
which might bring with it any prejudice to this People; as by the contrary I
did ever admonish them, never to conclude upon any such Union, as might carry
hurt or grudge with it to either of the said Nations: for the leaving of any
such thing, could not but be the greatest hinderance that might be to such an
Action, which GOD by the Laws of ture had provided to be in his own time, and
has now in effect perfected in my Person; to which purpose my Lord Chancellor
has better spoken, then I am able to relate.

And as to the nature of this high Court of Parliament, It is nothing else but
the Kings great Council, which the King does assemble, either upon occasion of
interpreting, or abrogating old Laws, or making of new, according as ill
manners shall deserve, or for the public punishment of notorious evil doers,
or the praise and reward of the virtuous and well deservers; wherein these four
things are to be considered.

First, Whereof this Court is composed. 1.


Secondly, What Matters are proper for it. 2.


Thirdly, To what end it is ordained. 3.


And Fourthly, What are the means and ways whereby this end should be 4.
brought to pass.

As for the thing it self, It is composed of a Head and a Body: The Head is the
King, the Body are the members of the Parliament. This Body again is subdivided
into two parts; The Upper and Lower House: The Upper compounded partly of
Nobility, Temporal men, who are heritable Counselors to to the high Court of
Parliament by the honor of their Creation and Lands: And partly of Bishops,
Spiritual men, who are likewise by the virtue of their place and dignity
Counselors, Life-Renters, or Ad vitam of this Court. The other House is
composed of Knights for the Shire; and Gentry, and Burgesses for the Towns. But
because the number would be infinite for all the Gentlemen and Burgesses to be
present at every Parliament, Therefore a certain number is selected and chosen
out of that great Body, serving only for that Parliament, where their persons
are the representation of that Body.

Now the Matters whereof they are to treat ought therefore to be general, and
rather of such matters as cannot well be performed without the assembling of
that general Body, and no more of these generals neither, then necessity shall
require: for as in Corruptissima Republica sunt plurimae leges: So does the
life and strength of the Law consist not in heaping up infinite and confused
numbers of Laws, but in the right interpretation and good execution of good
and wholesome Laws. If this be so then, neither is this a place on the one side
for every rash and harebrain fellow to propone new Laws of his own invention:
nay rather I could wish these busy heads to remember that Law of the
Lacedaemonians, That whosoever came to propone a new Law to the People, behoved
publicly to present himself with a Rope about his neck, that in case the Law
were not allowed, he should be hanged therewith. So wary should men be of
proponing Novelties, but most of all, not to propone any bitter or seditious
Laws, which can produce nothing but grudges and coffeehouse between the
Prince and his people: nor yet is it on the other side a convenient place for
private men under the color of general Laws, to propone nothing but their own
particular gain, either to the hurt of their private neighbors, or to the hurt
of the whole State in general, which many times under fair and pleasing Titles,
are smoothly passed over, and so by stealth procure without consideration, that
the private meaning of them tends to nothing but either to the wreck of a
particular party, or else under color of public benefit to pill the poor
people, and serve as it were for a general Impost upon them for filling the
purses of some private persons.

And as to the end for which the Parliament is ordained, being only for the
advancement of Gods glory, and the establishment and wealth of the King and his
people: It is no place then for particular men to utter there their private
conceits, nor for satisfaction of their curiosities, and least of all to make
show of their eloquence, by tyning the time with long studied and eloquent
Orations. No, the reverence of GOD, their King, and their Country being well
settled in their hearts, will make them ashamed of such toys, and remember that
they are there as sworn Counselors to their King, to give their best advice
for the furtherance of his Service, and the flourishing Weal of his Estate.

And lastly, if you will rightly consider the means and ways how to bring all
your labors to a good end, you must remember, That you are here assembled by
your lawful King to give him your best advices, in the matters proposed by bim
unto you, being of that nature, which I have already told, wherein you are
gravely to deliberate, and upon your consciences plainly to determine how far
those things propounded do agree with the Weal, both of your King, and of your
Country, whose weals cannot be separated. And as for my self, the world shall
ever bear me witness, That I never shall propone any thing unto you, which
shall not as well tend to the Weal public, as to any benefit for me: So shall
I never oppone my self to that, which may tend to the good of the
Commonwealth, for the which I am ordained, as I have often said. And as you
are to give your advice in such things, as shall by your King be proposed: So
is it on your part your duties to propone any thing that you can, after mature
deliberation judge to be needful, either for these ends already spoken of, or
otherwise for the discovery of any latent evil in the Kingdom, which
peradventure may not have come to the Kings ear. If this then ought to be your
grave manner of proceeding in this place, Men should be ashamed to make snew of
the quickness of their wits here, either in taunting, scoffing, or detracting
the Prince or State in any point, or yet in breaking jests upon their fellows,
for which the Ordinaries or Alehouses are fitter places, than this Honorable
and high Court of Parliament.

In conclusion then, since you are to break up, for the Reasons I have already
told you, I wish such of you as have any charges in your Countries, to hasten
you home for the repressing of the insolences of these Rebels, and
apprehension of their persons, wherein, as I heartily pray to the Almighty for
your prosperous success: So do I not doubt, but we shall shortly hear the good
news of the same; And that you shall have an happy return, and meeting here to
all our comforts. Here the Lord Chancellor spoke touching the Proroguing of the
Parliament. And having done, his Majesty rose again, and said.



Since it pleased GOD to grant me two such notable Deliveries upon one day of
the week, which was Tuesday, and likewise one day of the Month, which was the
fifth; thereby to teach me, That as it was the same Devil that still persecuted
me: So it was one and the same GOD that still mightily delivered me; I thought
it therefore not amiss, that the one and twentieth day of January, which fell
to be upon Tuesday, should be the day of meeting of this next Session of
Parliament, hoping and assuring my Self, that the same GOD who has now granted
me and you all so notable and gracious a Delivery, shall prosper all our
affairs at that next Session, and bring them to a happy conclusion. And now I
consider God has well provided it that the ending of this Parliament has been
so long continued; For as for mine own part, I never had any other intention,
but only to seek so far my weal, and prosperity, as might conjunctly stand
with the flourishing State of the whole Commonwealth, as I have often told
you: So on the other part I confess, if I had been in your places at the
beginning of this Parliament (which was so soon after mine entry into this
Kingdom, wherein ye could not possibly have so perfect a knowledge of mine
inclination, as experience since has taught you) I could not but have
suspected, and mis-interpreted diverse things, In the trying whereof, now I
hope, by your experience of my behavior and form of government, you are well
enough cleared, and resolved.

A DISCOURSE Of the Manner of the Discovery of the Gunpowder-Plot, together
with the Examinations and Confessions of some of the most notorious
Conspirators concerned in it.
THere is a time when no man ought to keep silence. For it has ever been held
as a general rule, and undoubted Maxim, in all well governed Commonwealths,
(whether Christian, and so guided by the Divine Light of GOD'S Word; or
Ethnic, and so led by the glimmering twilight of Nature) yet howsoever their
profession was, upon this ground have they all agreed, That when either their
Religion, their King, or their Country was in any extreme hazard; no good
Countreyman ought then to withhold either his tongue or his hand, according to
his calling and faculty, from aiding to repel the Injury, repress the Violence,
and avenge the Guilt upon the Authors thereof. But if ever any people had such
an occasion ministered unto them, It is surely this People now, nay this whole
Isle, and all the rest belonging to this great and glorious Monarchy. For if in
any Heathenish Republic, no private man could think his life more happily and
gloriously bestowed, then in the defense of any one of these three, That is,
either pro Aris, pro Focis, or pro Patre patrioe; And that the endangering of
any one of these, would at once stir the whole body of the Commonwealth, not
any more as divided members, but as a solid and individual lump: How much more
ought we, the truly Christian People, that inhabit this United, and truly
happy Isle, under the wings of our gracious and religious Monarch? Nay, how
infinitely greater cause have we to feel, and resent our selves of the Insula
fortunata.
smart of that wound, not only intended and execrated (not consecrated) for
the utter extinguishing of our true Christian profession, nor jointly therewith
only for the cutting off of our Head and Father Politic, Sed ut nefas istud
and sacrilegiosum parricidium omnibus modis absolutum reddi possit? And that
nothing might be wanting for making this sacrilegious Parricide a pattern of
mischief, and a crime (nay, a Mother or Storehouse of all crimes) without
example, they should have joined the destruction of the body to the head, so as
Grex cum Rege, Arae cum focis, Lares cum Penatibus, should all at one
thunderclap have been sent to Heaven together: The King our Head, the Queen our
fertile Mother, and those young and hopeful Olive plants, not theirs but ours:
Our reverend Clergy, our honorable Nobility, the faithful Counselors, the
grave Judges, the greatest part of the worthy Knights and Gentry, as well as of
the wisest Burgesses; The whole Clerks of the Crown, Council, Signet, Seals, or
of any other principal Judgment seat. All the learned Lawyers, together with
an infinite number of the Common people: Nay, their furious rage should not
only have lighted upon reasonable and sensible creatures without distinction,
either of degree, sex, or age; But even the insensible stocks and stones
should not have been free of their fury. The Hall of Justice; The House of
Parliament; the Church used for the Coronation of our Kings; The Monuments of
our former Princes; The Crown, and other marks of Royalty; all the Records, as
well of Parliament, as of every particular man's right, with a great number of
Charters and such like, should all have been comprehended under that fearful
Chaos. And so the earth as it were opened, should have sent forth of the bottom
of the Stygian Lake such sulphured smoke, furious flames, and fearful thunder,
as should have, by their diabolical Domesday destroyed and defaced, in the
twinkling of an eye, not only our present living Princes, and People, but
even our insensible Monuments reserved for future ages. So as not only our
selves that are mortal, but the immortal Monuments of our ancient Princes and
Nobility, that have been so preciously preserved from age to age, as the
remaining Trophies of their eternal glory, and have so long triumphed over
envious time, should now have been all consumed together; And so not only we,
but the memory of us and ours, should have been thus extinguished in an
instant. The true horror therefore of this detestable devise, has stirred me
up to bethink my self, wherein I may best discharge my conscience in a cause so
general and common, if it were to bring but one stone to the building, or
rather with the Widow, one mite to the common Box. But since to so hateful and
unheard of invention, there can be no greater enemy then the self, the simple
truth thereof being once publicly known and divulged; and that there needs no
stronger argument to bring such a Plot in universal detestation, then the
certainty that so monstrous a thing could once be devised, nay concluded upon,
wrought in, in full readiness, and within twelve hours of the execution: My
threefold zeal to those blessings, whereof they would have so violently made us
all Widows, has made me resolve to set down here the true Narration of that
monstrous and unnatural intended Tragedy, having better occasion by the means
of my service, and continual attendance in Court, to know the truth thereof,
than others that peradventure have it only by relation at the third or fourth
hand. So that whereas those worse than Catalines, thought to have extirped us,
and our memories; their infamous memory shall by these means remain to the end
of the world, upon the one part; and upon the other, Gods great and merciful
deliverance of his Anointed, and us all, shall remain in never-dying Records.
And GOD grant that it may be in Marble Tables of Thankfulness engraven in our
hearts.

WHile this Land and whole Monarchy flourished in a most happy and plentiful
Peace, as well at home as abroad, sustained and conducted by those two main
pillars of all good Government, Piety and Justice, no foreign grudge, nor
inward whispering of coffeehouse any way appearing; The King being upon his
return from his Hunting exercise at Royston, upon occasion of the drawing near
of the Parliament time, which had been twice Prorogued already, partly in
regard of the season of the year, and partly of the Term; As the winds are ever
stillest immediately before a storm; and as the Sun blenks often hottest to
foretell a following shower: So at that time of greatest calm, did this
secretly hatched thunder begin to cast forth the first flashes, and flaming
lightnings of the approaching tempest. For the Saturday of the week,
immediately preceding the King's return, which was upon a Thursday (being but
ten days before the Parliament) The Lord Mountegle, Son and Heir to the Lord A
Letter delivered to the Lord Mountegle.
Morley, being in his own Lodging, ready to go to supper, at seven of the
clock at night, one of his Footmen (whom he had sent of an errand over the
street) was met by an unknown man, of a reasonable tall personage, who
delivered him a Letter, charging him to put it in my Lord his Masters hands:
which my Lord no sooner received, but that having broken it up, and perceiving
the same to be of an unknown, and somewhat unlegible hand, and without either
Date or Subscription; did call one of his men unto him for helping him to read
it. But no sooner did he conceive the strange contents thereof, although he was
somewhat perplexed what construction to make of it (as whether of a matter of
consequence, as indeed it was, or whether some foolish devised Pasquil, by some
of his enemies to scare him from his attendance at the Parliament) yet did he,
as a most dutiful and loyal Subject, conclude not to conceal it, whatever might
come of it. Whereupon, notwithstanding the lateness and darkness of the night
in that season of the year, he presently repaired to His Majesty's Palace at
Whitehal, and there delivered the same to the Earl of Salisbury, His Majesty's
Principal Revealed to the Earl of Salisbury.
Secretary. Whereupon the said Earl of Salisbury having read the Letter, and
heard the manner of the coming of it to his hands, did greatly encourage, and
commend my Lord for his discretion, telling him plainly, that whatsoever the
purpose of the Letter might prove hereafter, yet did this accident put him in
mind of diverse advertisements he had received from beyond the Seas, wherewith
he had acquainted, as well the King himself, as diverse of His Privy
Counselors, concerning some business the Papists were in, both at home and
abroad, making preparations for some combination amongst them against this
Parliament time, for enabling them to deliver at that time to the King, some
Purpose of the Papists for delivering a Petition to His Majesty, to crave
toleration of Religion.
petition for toleration of Religion: which should be delivered in some such
order and so well backed, as the King should be loath to refuse their requests;
like the sturdy beggars craving alms with one open hand, but carrying a stone
in the other, in case of refusal. And therefore did the Earl of Salisbury
conclude with the Lord Mountegle, that he would, in regard of the Kings
absence, impart the same Letter to some more of His Majesty's Council; whereof
my L. Mountegle liked well: only adding this request by way of protestation,
That whatsoever the event hereof might prove, it should not be imputed to him,
as proceeding from too light, and too sudden an apprehension, that he
delivered this Letter, being only moved thereunto for demonstration of his
ready devotion, and care for preservation of His Majesty and the State. And
thus did the Earl of Salisbury presently acquaint the L. Chamberlain with the
said The Lord Chamberlain made privy to the Letter by the Earl of Salisbury.
Letter. Whereupon they two, in presence of the Lord Mountegle; calling to mind
the former intelligence already mentioned, which seemed to have some relation
with this Letter: The tender care which they ever carried to the preservation
of His Majesty's Person, made them apprehend, that some perilous attempt did
thereby appear to be intended against the same, which did the more nearly
concern the said Lord Chamberlain to have a care of, in regard that it does
belong to the charge of his Office to oversee as well all places of Assembly
where His Majesty is to repair, as his Highness own private Houses. And
therefore did the said two Counselors conclude, That they should join unto
themselves Three more of the Counsel, to wit, the Lord Admiral, the Earls of
Worcester and Northampton, to be also particularly acquainted with this
accident, who having all of them concurred together to the re-examination of
the Con tents of the said Letter, they did conclude That how slight a matter it
might at the first appear to be, yet was it not absolutely to be contemned, in
respect of the care which it behoved them to have of the preservation of His
Majesty's Person: But yet resolved for Thought meet by the Counselors to
acquaint the King with the Letter.
two reasons, First, To acquaint the King himself with the same, before they
proceeded to any further Inquisition in the matter, as well for the expectation
and experience they had of His Majesty's fortunate Judgment in clearing and
solving of obscure Riddles and doubtful Mysteries; as also, because the more
time would in the mean while be given for the Practice to ripen, if any was,
whereby the Discovery might be the more clear and evident, and the ground of
proceeding thereupon more safe, just, and easy. And so according to their
determination, did the said Earl of Salisbury, repair to the King in His
Gallery upon Friday, being Alhallow day, in the afternoon, Upon Alhallow-day,
the Earl of Salisbury showed the Letter to the King.
which was the day after His Majesty's arrival, and none but himself being
present with His Highness at that time, where without any other Speech or
Judgment giving of the Letter, but only relating simply the form of the
delivery thereof, he presented it to His Majesty. The Contents whereof follow.

MY Lord, out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I have a care of your
preservation. Therefore I would advise you, as you tender your life, to devise
some excuse to shift off your attendance at this Parliament. For God and Man
have concurred to punish the wickedness of this Time. And think not slightly of
this Advertisement, but retire your self into your Country, where you may
expect the event in safety. For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet
I say, they shall receive a terrible Blow this Parliament, and yet they shall
not see who hurts them. This Counsel is not to be contemned, because it may do
you good, and can do you no harm; for the danger is past, so soon as you have
burnt the Letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of
it: To whose Holy protection I commend you.


The King no sooner read the Letter, but after a little pause, and then reading
it over again, he delivered his judgment of it in such sort, as he thought it
was not to be contemned, His Majesty's judgment of the Leter.
for that the Style of it seemed to be more quick and pithy, than is usual to
be in any Pasquil or Libel (the superfluities of idle brains:) But the Earl of
Salisbury perceiving the King to apprehend it deeplier than he looked for,
knowing his Nature, told him that he thougt by one sentence in it, that it was
like to be written by some fool or mad man, reading to him this Sentence in it.
For the danger is past, as soon as you have burnt the Letter; which he said,
was likely to be the saying of a fool: for if the danger was past so soon as
the Letter was burnt, then the warning behoved to be of a little avail, when
the burning of the Letter might make the danger to be eschewed. But the King by
the contrary, considering the former sentence In the Letter. That they should
receive a terrible Blow at this Parliament, and yet should not see who hurt
them, joining it to the sentence immediately following, already alleged, did
thereupon conjecture, That the danger mentioned should be some sudden danger
by blowing up of Powder, For no other Insurrection, Rebellion, or whatsoever
other private and desperate Attempt could be committed or attempted in time of
Parliament, and the Authors thereof unseen, except only if it were by a blowing
up of Powder, which might be performed by one base knave in a dark corner;
whereupon he was moved to interpret, and construe the latter Sentence in the
Letter (alleged by the Earl of Salisbury) against all ordinary sense and
construction in Grammar, as if by these words, For the danger is past, as soon
as you have burned the Letter, should be closely understood the suddainty and
quickness of the danger, which should be as quickly performed, and at an end,
as that paper should be of blazing up in the His Majesty's opinion for
searching of the underrooms in the Parliament House.
fire; turning that word of as soon, to the sense of, as quickly. And therefore
wished, that before His going to the Parliament, the under rooms of the
Parliament House, (might be well and narrowly searched. But the Earl of
Salisbury wondering at this His Majesty's Commentary, which he knew to be so far
contrary to His ordinary and natural disposition, who did rather ever sin upon
the other side, in not apprehending nor trusting due Advertisements of
Practices and Perils when he was truly informed of them, whereby he had many
times drawn himself into many desperate dangers: and interpreting rightly, this
extraordinary Caution at this time, to proceed from the vigilant care he had of
the whole State, more than of His own Person, which could not but have all
perished together, if this designment had succeeded: He thought good to
dissemble still unto the King, that there had been any just cause of such
apprehensions. And ending the purpose with some merry jest upon this subject,
as his custom is, took his leave for that time. But though he seemed so to
neglect it to His Majesty; yet his customable and watchful care of the King,
and the State still boiling within him. And having with the Blessed Virgin Mary
laid up in his heart, the Kings so strange judgment and construction of it; He
could not be at rest till he acquainted the foresaid Lords what had passed
between the King and him in private. Whereupon they were all so earnest to
renew again the memory of the same purpose to His Majesty, as it was agreed
that he should the next day, being Saturday, repair to His Highness: which he
did in the same Privy Gallery, and renewed the memory thereof, the L.
Chamberlain then being present with the King. At what time it was determined;
that the said Lord Chamberlain should, according to his The determination to
search the Parliament House, and the rooms under it.
custom and Office, view all the Parliament Houses, both above and below, and
consider what likelihood or appearance of any such danger might possibly be
gathered by the sight of them: but yet, as well for staying of idle rumors, as
for being the more able to discern any mystery, the nearer that things were in
readiness, his journey thither was ordained to be deferred till the afternoon,
before the sitting down of the Parliament, which was upon the Monday following.
At what time he (according to this conclusion) went to the Parliament house,
accompanied with my Lord Mountegle, being in zeal to the Kings service, earnest
and curious to see the event of that accident, whereof he had the fortune to be
the first discoverer: where having viewed all the lower rooms, he found in the
Vault, under the Upper House, great store and Provisions of Billets, Faggots
and Wood and Coal found by the L. Chamberlain in the Vault.
Coals: And enquiring of Whyneard, Keeper of the Wardrobe, to what use he had
put those lower Rooms and Cellars: he told him,, That Thomas Percy had hired
both the House, and part of the Cellar or Vault under the same, and that the
Wood and Coal therein was the said Gentleman's own provision. Whereupon the Lord
Chamberlain, casting his eye aside, perceived a fellow standing in a corner
there, calling himself the said Percy's man, and keeper of that house for him,
but indeed was Guido Fawkes, the owner of that Guido Fawkes bearing the name of
Percy's man.
hand, which should have acted that monstrous Tragedy.

The Lord Chamberlain looking upon all things with a heedful indeed, yet in
outward appearance with but a careless and rackless eye (as became so wise and
diligent a minister) he presently addressed himself to the King in the said
Privy Gallery, where in the presence of the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Admiral,
the Earls of Worcester, Northampton, The L. Chamberlain's report and judgment
of what he had observed in the search.
and Salisbury, he made his report, what he had seen and observed there:
noting, that Mountegle had told him; That he no sooner heard Thomas Percy named
to be the possessor of that house, but considering both his backwardness in
Religion, and the old dearness in friendship, between himself, and the said
Percy, he did greatly suspect the matter, and that the Letter should come from
him. The said Lord Chamberlain also told, That he did not wonder a little at
the extraordinary great provision of Wood and Coal in that house, where Thomas
Percy had so seldom occasion to remain: As likewise it gave him in his mind,
that his man looked like a very tall and desperate fellow.

This could not but increase the Kings former apprehension and jealousy:
whereupon he insisted (as before) that the House was narrowly to be searched,
and that those Billets and Coals should be searched to the bottom, it being
most suspicious that they were laid there only for covering of the Powder. Of
the same mind also, were all the Counselors then present. But upon the fashion
of making of the search, was it long Disputations about the manner of the
further search.
debated: for upon the one side they were all so jealous of the Kings safety,
that they all agreed, that there could not be too much caution used for
preventing his danger. And yet upon the other part, they were all extreme loath
and dainty, that in case this Letter should prove to be nothing but the
evapouration of an idle brain; then a curious search being made, and nothing
found, should not only turn to the general scandal of the King and the State,
as being so suspicious of every light and frivilous toy, but likewise lay an
ill savoured imputation upon the Earl of Northumberland, one of His Majesty's
greatest Subjects and Counselors; this Thomas Percy being his kinsman, and most
confident familiar. And the rather were they curious upon this point, knowing
how far the King detested to be thought suspicious or jealous of any of His
good Subjects, though of the meanest degree. And therefore, though they all
agreed upon the main ground, which was to provide for the security of the Kings
Person, yet did they much differ in the circumstances, by which this action
might be best carried with least dinne and occasion of slander. But the King
himself still persisting that there were diverse shrewd appearances, and that a
narrow search of those places could pre-judge no man that was innocent, he at
last plainly resolved them, That either must all the parts of those rooms be
narrowly searched, and no possibility of danger left unexamined, or else he and
they all must resolve not to meddle in it at all, but plainly to go the next
day to the Parliament, and leave the success to Fortune, which he believed they
would be loath to take upon their consciences: for in such a case as this, an
half doing was worse than no doing at all. Whereupon it was at last concluded,
That nothing Agreed that that the search should be under col^r of seeking for
Wardrob^stuffe, missed by Whyneyard.
should be left unsearched in those Houses: And yet for the better color and
stay of rumor, in case nothing were found, it was thought meet, that upon a
pretense of Whyneards missing some of the Kings stuff or Hangings which he had
in keeping, all those rooms should be narrowly ripped for them. And to this
purpose was Sir Thomas Knevet, (a Gentleman of His Majesty's Privy Chamber)
employed, being a Justice of Peace in Westminster, and one, of whose ancient
fidelity, both the late Queen, and our now Sovereign have had large proof: who
according to the trust committed unto him, went about the midnight next after
to the Parliament house, accompanied with such a small number, as was fit for
that errand. But before his entry into the house, finding Thomas Percy's
alleged man standing without the doors, his Clothes and Boots on, at so dead a
^es ^d at ^night without the ^ouse.
time of the night, he resolved to apprehend him, as he did, and thereafter
went forward to the searching of the house, where after he had caused to be
overturned some of the Billets and Coals, he first found one of the small
Barrels of Powder, and after all the rest, to the number of thirty six Barrels,
great and small: And thereafter searching the fellow, whom he had taken, found
three Matches, and all other instruments fit for blowing up the Powder, ready
upon him, which made him instantly confess his own guiltiness, declaring also
unto him, That if he had happened to be within the house when he took him, as
he was immediately before (at the ending of his work) he would not have failed
to have blown him up, house and all.

Thus after Sir Thomas had caused the wretch to be surely bound, and well
guarded, by the company he had brought with him, he himself returned back to
the Kings Palace, and gave warning of his succese to the Lord Chamberlain, and
Earl of Salisbury, who immediately warning the rest of the Upon Sir Tho.
Kneven's return the Council warned.
Council that lay in the house, as soon as they could get themselves ready,
came, with their fellow-Counselors, to the Kings Bedchamber, being at that
time near four of the clock in the morning. And at the first entry of the Kings
Chamber door, the Lord Chamberlain; being not any longer able to conceal his
joy, for the preventing of so great a danger, told the King in a confused
haste, that all was found and discovered, and the Traitor in hands, and fast
bound.

Then, Order being first taken for sending for the rest of the Counsel, that
lay in the Town, The prisoner himself was brought into the House, where in
respect of the strangeness of the accident, no man was stayed from the ^ight,
or speaking with him. And within a while after, the Council did examine him;
Who seeming to put on a Roman resolution, did both to the Council, and to every
other person that spoke with him that day, appear so constant and settled upon
his grounds, as we all thought we had found some new Mutius Scaevola, born in
England. For notwithstanding the horror of the Fact, the guilt of his
conscience, his sudden surprising, the terror which should have been stricken
in him, by coming into the presence of so grave a Council, and the restless,
and confused questions that every man all that day did vex him with, yet was
his countenance so far from being dejected, at he often smiled in scornful
manner, not only avowing the Fact, but repenting only, with the said Scaevola,
his failing in the execution thereof, whereof (he said) the Devil and not GOD
was the Discoverer: answering quickly to every man's objection, scoffing at any
idle questions, which were propounded unto him, and jesting with such as he
thought had no authority to examine him- All that day could the Counsel get
nothing out of him touching his Accomplices, refusing to answer to any such
questions which he thought might discover the Plot, and laying all the blame
upon himself; Whereunto he said, he was moved only for Religion and conscience
sake, denying the King to be his lawful Sovereign, or the Anointed of GOD in
respect he was an Heretic, and giving himself no other name than John Johnson,
servant to Thomas Percy. But the next morning being carried to the Tower he did
not there remain above two or three days, being twice or thrice in that space
re-examined, and the Rack only offered and showed unto him, when the masque of
his Roman fortitude did visibly begin to wear and slide off his face; And then
did he begin to confess part of the truth, and thereafter to open the whole
matter, as does appear by his depositions immediately following.

A TRUE COPY Of the Declaration of Guido Fawkes, taken in the presence of the
Counselors, whose Names are underwritten.
I Confess, that a practice in general was first broken unto me, against His
Majesty for relief of the Catholic Cause, and not invented or propounded by
my self. And this was first propounded unto me about Easter last was Twelve
month, beyond the Seas, in the Low Countries of the Archdukes obeisance, by
Thomas Winter, who came thereupon with me into England, and there we imparted
our purpose to three other Gentlemen more, namely, Robert Catesby, Thomas
Percy, and John Wright, who all five consulting together of the means how to
execute the same, and taking a vow among our selves for secrecy; Catesby
propounded to have it performed by Gunpowder, and by making a Mine under the
upper House of Parliament: which place we made choice of the rather, because
Religion having been unjustly suppressed there, it was fittest that Justice and
Punishment should be executed there.

This being resolved amongst us, Thomas Percy hired an house at Westminster for
that purpose, near adjoining to the Parliament House, and there we begun to
make our Mine about the 11 of December 1604.

The five that first entered into the work, were Thomas Percy, Robert Catesby,
Thomas Winter, John Wright, and my self: and soon after we took another unto
us, Christopher Wright, having sworn him also, and taken the Sacrament for
Secrecy.

When we came to the very foundation of the Wall of the House, which was about
three yards thick, and found it a matter of great difficulty, we took unto us
another Gentleman, Robert Winter, in like manner with Oath and Sacrament as
aforesaid.

It was about Christmas when we brought our Mine unto the Wall, and about
Candlemas we had wrought the Wall half through: And whilst they were in
working, I stood as Sentinel, to descrie any Man that came near, whereof I gave
them warning, and so they ceased until I gave notice again to proceed.

All we seven lay in the House, and had Shot and Powder, being resolved to die
in that place, before we should yield or be taken.

As they were working upon the Wall, they heard a rushing in a Cellar of
removing of Coals, whereupon we feared we had been discovered: and they sent
me to go to the Cellar, who finding that the Coals were a selling, and that
the Cellar was to be let, viewing the commodity thereof for our purpose, Percy
went and hired the same for yearly rent.

We had before this provided and brought into the House Twenty Barrels of
Powder, which we removed into the Cellar, and covered the same with Billets and
Faggots, which were provided for that purpose.

About Easter, the Parliament being Prorogued till October next, we dispersed
our selves, and I retired into the Low Countries, by advise and direction of
the rest, as well to acquaint Owen with the particulars of the Plot, as also
least by my longer stay I might have grown suspicious, and so have come in
question.

In the mean time Percy having the key of the Cellar, laid in more Powder and
Wood into it. I returned about the beginning of September next, and then
receiving the key again of Perey, we brought in more Powder and Billets to
cover the same again, and so I went for a time into the Country till the 30 of
October.

It was further resolved amongst us, that the same day that this Act should
have been performed, some other of our Confederates should have surprised the
person of the Lady ELIZABETH, the Kings eldest Daughter, who was kept in
Warwickshire at the Lord Haringtons House, and presently have proclaimed her
Queen, having a Project of a Proclamation ready for that purpose; wherein we
made no mention of altering of Religion, nor would have avowed the deed to be
ours, until we should have had power enough to make our Party good, and then we
would have avowed both.

Concerning Duke CHARLES the Kings second Son, we had sundry Consultations how
to seize on his Person. But because we found no means how to compass it (the
Duke being kept near London, where we had not Forces enough) we resolved to
serve our turn with the Lady ELIZABETH.

ANd in regard that before this discourse could be ready to go to the Press,
Thomas Winter being apprehended, and brought to the Tower, made a Confession in
substance agreeing with this former of Fawkes, only larger in some
circumstances: I have thought good to insert the same likewise in this place,
for the further clearing of the matter, and greater benefit of the Reader.

Thomas Winters Confession, taken the xxiii. of November 1605. in the presence
of the Counselors, whose Names are underwritten.
My most Honorable Lords,
NOt out of hope to Obtain Pardon: for, speaking of my temporal part, I may
say, The Fault is Greater than can be forgiven; nor affecting hereby the Title
of a good Subject: for I must redeem my Country from as great a danger, as I
have hazarded the bringing of Her into, before I can purchase any such opinion;
Only at your Honors command I will briefly set down mine own Accusation, and
how far I have proceeded in this business; which I shall the faithfuller do,
since I see such courses are not pleasing to Almighty God, and that all, or the
most material parts have been already confessed.

I remained with my brother in the Country from Alhallontide until the
beginning of Lent, in the year of our Lord 1603. the first year of the Kings
Reign: about which time Master Catesby sent thither, entreating me to come to
London, where he and other my friends would be glad to see me. I desired him to
excuse me: for I found my self not very well disposed; and (which had happened
never to me before) returned the Messenger without my company. Shortly I
received another Letter, in any wise to come. At the second summons I presently
came up, and found him with Master John Wright at Lambeth, where he brake with
me, how necessary it was not to forsake our Country (for he knew I had then a
resolution to go over) but to deliver her from the servitude in which she
remained, or at least to assist her with our uttermost endeavors. I answered,
That I had often hazarded my life upon far lighter terms, and now would not
refuse any good occasion, wherein I might do service to the Catholic Cause;
but for my self I knew no mean probable to succeed. He said that he had
bethought him of a way at one instant to deliver us from all our Bonds, and
without any foreign help to replant again the Catholic Religion; and withal
told me in a word, It was to blow up the Parliament House with Gunpowder; for,
said he, in that place have they done us all the mischief, and perchance GOD
has designed that place for their punishment. I wondered at the strangeness of
the conceit, and told him, That true it was, this struck at the Root, and
would breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations; But if it should not take
effect (as most of this nature miscarried) the Scandal would be so great which
Catholic Religion might hereby sustain, as not only our Enemies, but our
Friends also would with good reason condemn us. He told me, The nature of the
disease required so sharp a remedy, and asked me if I would give my consent. I
told him, yes, in this or what else soever, if he resolved upon it, I would
venture my life. But I proposed many difficulties, As want of an House, and of
one to carry the Mine, noise in the working, and such like. His answer was, Let
us give an attempt, and where it fails pass no farther. But first, quoth he,
Because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untryed, you shall go over,
and inform the Constable of the state of the Catholics here in England,
entreating him to solicit His Majesty at his coming hither, that the Penal
Laws may be recalled, and we admitted into the rank of his other Subjects:
withal, you may bring over some confident Gentleman, such as you shall
understand best able for this business, and named unto me Mr. Fawkes. Shortly
after, I passed the Sea, and found the Constable at Bergen near Dunkirke,
where, by help of Mr. Owen I delivered my message, Whose answer was, That he
had strict command from his Master, to do all good Offices for the Catholics,
and for his own part, he thought himself bound in Conscience so to do, and that
no good occasion should be omitted, but spoke to him nothing of this matter.

Returning to Dunkirck with Mr. Owen, we had speech whether he thought the
Constable would faithfully help us, or no. He said he believed nothing less,
and that they sought only their own ends, holding small account of Catholics.
I told him, that there were many Gentlemen in England, who would not forsake
their Country, until they had tried the uttermost, and rather venture their
lives, than forsake her in this misery. And, to add one more to our number, as
a sit man both for counsel and execution of whatsoever we should resolve,
wished for M Fawkes, whom I had heard good commendations of: he told me the
Gentleman deserved no less, but was at Brussels, and that if he came not, as
happily he might, before my departure, he would send him shortly after into
England. I went soon after to Ostend, where Sir William Stanley as then was
not, but came two days after. I remained with him three or four days, in
which time I asked him, if the Catholics in England should do any thing to
help themselves, whether he thought the Archduke would second them? He
answered, No, for all those parts were so desirous of peace with England, as
they would endure no speech of other enterprise: neither were it fit, said he,
to set any project afoot now the Peace is upon concluding. I told him there was
no such resolution, and so fell to discourse of other matters, until I came to
speak of M. Fawkes, whose company I wished over into England. I asked of his
sufficiency in the Wars, and told him we should need such as he if occasion
required; he gave very good commendations of him. And as we were thus
discoursing, and I ready to depart for Newport, and taking my leave of Sir
William, Master Fawkes came into our company, newly returned, and saluted us.
This is the Gentleman, said Sir William, that you wished for, and so we
embraced again. I told him, Some good friends of his wished his company in
England, and that if he pleased to come to Dunkirck, we would have further
conference, whither I was then going: so taking my leave of them both, I
departed. About two days after came Mr. Fawkes to Dunkirck, where I told him,
That we were upon a resolution to do something in England, if the Peace with
Spain helped us not, but had as yet resolved upon nothing; such, or the like
talk we passed at Graveling, where I lay for a wind, and when it served came
both in one Passage to Greenwich, near which place we took a pair of Oars, and
so came up to London, and came to Mr. Catesby, whom we found in his lodging; he
welcomed us into England, and asked me what news from the Constable. I told
him, good words, but I feared the deeds would not answer. This was the
beginning of Easter Term, and about the midst of the same Term, (whether sent
for by Master Catesby, or upon some business of his own) up came Mr. Thomas
Percy. The first word he spoke (after he came into our company) was, Shall we
always (Gentlemen) talk, and never do any thing? Mr. Catesby took him aside,
and had speech about somewhat to be done, so as first we might all take an oath
of secrecy, which we resolved within two or three days to do: so as there we
met behind St. Clements, Mr. Catesby, Mr. Percy, Mr. Wright, Mr. Guy Fawkes,
and my self; and having upon a Primer given each other the Oath of secrecy, in
a chamber where no other body was, we went after into the next Room and heard
Mass, and received the blessed Sacrament upon the same. Then did Mr. Catesby
disclose to Mr. Percy, and I together with Jack Wright, tell to Mr. Fawkes the
business for which we took this Oath, which they both approved. And then was
Mr. Percy sent to take the House, which Mr. Catesby in mine absence had learned
did belong to one Ferris, which with some difficulty in the end he obtained,
and became as Ferris before was, Tenant to Whynniard. Mr. Fawkes underwent the
name of Mr. Percies Man, calling himself Johnson, because his face was the most
unknown, and received the keys of the house, until we heard that the
Parliament was Adjourned to the seventh of February. At which time we all
departed several ways into the Country, to meet again at the beginning of
Michaelmas-Terme. Before this time also it was thought convenient to have a
house that might answer to Mr. Percies, where we might make provision of Powder
and Wood for the Mine, which being there made ready, should in a night be
conveyed by boat to the House by the Parliament, because we were loath to foil
that with often going in and out. There was none that we could devise so fit as
Lambeth, where Mr. Catesby often lay, and to be keeper thereof (by Mr.
Catesbies choice) we received into the number, Keys, as a trusty honest Man:
this was about a Month before Michaelmas.

Some fortnight after, toward the beginning of the Term, Mr. Fawkes and I
came to Mr. Catesby at Morecrofts, where we agreed, That now was time to begin
and set things in order for the Mine. So as Mr. Fawkes went to London, and the
next day sent for me to come over to him: when I came, the cause was, for that
the Scottish Lords were appointed to sit in conference of the Union in Mr.
Percies house. This hindered our beginning until a fortnight before Christmas,
by which time both Mr. Percy and Mr. Wright were come to London, and we against
their coming had provided a good part of the Powder: so as we all five entered
with tools fit to begin our work, having provided our selves of Baked-meates,
the less to need sending abroad. We entered late in the night, and were never
seen, save only Mr. Percy's Man, until Christmas-Eve. In which time we wrought
under a little Entry to the Wall of the Parliament House, and underpropped it
as we went with Wood.

Whilst we were together, we began to fashion our business, and discoursed
what we should do after this deed was done. The first question was, How we
might surprise the next heir, the Prince happily would be at the Parliament with
the King his Father, how should we then be able to seize on the Duke? This
burden Mr. Percy undertook, that by his acquaintance, he, with another
Gentleman would enter the Chamber without suspicion, and having some dozen
others at several doors to expect his coming, and two or three on horseback at
the Court-Gate to receive him, he would undertake (the Blow being given, until
which he would attend in the Dukes Chamber) to carry him safe away: for he
supposed most of the Court would be absent, and such as were there not
suspecting, or unprovided for any such matter. For the Lady ELIZABETH, it were
easy to surprise her in the Country, by drawing Friends together at an
hunting near the Lord Haringtons, and Ashby, Mr. Catesbyes house, being not far
off was a fit place for preparation.

The next was for Money and Horses, which if we could provide in any reasonable
measure (having the Heir apparent) and the first knowledge by four or five
days, was odds sufficient.

Then what Lords we should save from the Parliament, which was first agreed in
general as many as we could that were Catholics, or so disposed: but after we
descended to speak of particulars.

Next what Foreign Princes we should acquaint with this before, or join with
after. For this point we agreed, that first we could not enjoin Princes to that
secrecy, nor oblige them by Oath, so to be secure of their promise: besides,
we knew not, whether they will approve the Project, or dislike it. And if they
do allow thereof, to prepare before might beget suspicion; and not to provide
until the business were acted, the same Letter that carried news of the thing
done, might as well entreat their help and furtherance. Spain is too slow in
his preparations, to hope any good from in the first extremities, and France
too near and too dangerous, who with the shipping of Holland we feared of all
the world might make away with us.

But while we were in the middle of these discourses, we heard that the
Parliament should be anew Adjourned until after Michaelmas, upon which tidings
we broke off both discourse and working until after Christmas. About Candlemas
we brought ^ver in a boat the Powder, which we had provided at Lambeth, and
laid it in Mr. Percies house, because we were willing to have all our danger in
one place.

We wrought also another fortnight in the Mine against the stone Wall, which
was very hard to beat thorough; at which time we called in Kit Wright, and
near to Easter, as we wrought the third time, opportunity was given to hire the
Cellar, in which we resolved to lay the Powder, and leave the Mine.

Now, by reason that the charge of maintaining us all so long together, besides
the number of several Houses, which for several uses had been hired, and buying
of Powder, etc. had layn heavy on Mr. Catesby alone to support; it was
necessary for him to call in some others to ease his charge, and to that end
desired leave, that he, with Mr. Percy, and a third, whom they should call,
might acquaint whom they thought fit and willing to the business: for many,
said he, may be content that I should know, who would not therefore that all
the company should be acquainted with their names: to this we all agreed.

After this Master Fawkes laid into the Cellar (which he had newly taken) a
thousand of Billets, and Five hundred of Faggots, and with that covered the
Powder, because we might have the House free, to suffer any one to enter that
would. Mr. Catesby wished us to consider, whether it were not now necessary to
send Mr. Fawkes over, both to absent himself for a time, as also to acquaint
Sir Will. Stanly and Mr. Owen with this matter. We agreed, that he should
(provided that he gave it them with the same oath that we had taken it fore)
videlicet, to keep it secret from all the world. The reason why we desired Sir
William Stanley should be acquainted herewith, was, to have him with us so soon
as he could: And for Mr Owen, he might hold good correspondency after with
foreign Princes.

So Mr. Fawkes departed about Easter for Flanders, and returned the latter end
of August. He told me, that when he arrived at Brussels, Sir William Stanley
was not returned from Spain, so as he uttered the matter only to Owen, who
seemed well pleased with the business, but told him, that surely Sir William
would not be acquainted with any Plot, as having business now afoot in the
Court of England: but he himself would be always ready to tell it him, and send
him away so soon as it were done.

About this time did Mr. Percy, and Mr. Catesby meet at the Bath, where they
agreed that the company being yet but few, Mr. Catesby should have the others
authority to call in whom he thought best; By which authority he called in
after, Sir Everard Digby, though at what time I know not, and last of all Mr.
Francis Tresham. The first promised, as I heard Master Catesby say, Fifteen
hundred pounds; The second Two thousand pounds; Mr. Percy himself promised all
that he could g^t (...) the Earl of Northumberland's Rents, which was about
four thousand pounds, and to provide many galloping Horses, to the number of
ten.

Mean while Mr. Fawkes and my self alone bought some new Powder, as suspecting
the first to be damk, and conveyed it into the Cellar, and set it in order, as
we resolved it should stand. Then was the Parliament anew prorogued until the
Fifth of November, so as we all went down, until some ten days before, when Mr.
Catesby came up with Mr. Fawkes, to an house by Enfield-Chace, called
White-Webbs, whither I came to them, and Mr. Catesby willed me to enquire,
whither the young Prince came to the Parliament: I told him, that I heard that
his Grace thought not to be there. Then must we have our Horses, said Mr.
Catesby, beyond the water, and provision of more company to surprise the
Prince, and leave the Duke alone.

Two days after, being Sunday at night, in came one to my chamber, and told me
that a Letter had been given to my Lord Mountegle to this effect, That he
wished his Lordships absence from the Parliament, because a Blow would there be
given; which Letter he presently carried to my Lord of Salisbury.

On the morrow I went to White-webbes, and told it to Mr. Catesby, assuring him
withal, that the matter was disclosed: and wishing him in any case to forsake
his Country. He told me, he would see further as yet, and resolved to send Mr.
Fawkes to try the uttermost, protesting, if the part belonged to himself, he
would try the same adventure.

On Wednesday Mr. Fawkes went, and returned at night, of which we were very
glad.

Thursday I came to London, and Friday Mr. Catesby, Mr. Tresham and I met at
Barnet, where we questioned how this Letter should be sent to my Lord
Mountegle, but could not conceive, for Mr. Tresham forsware it, whom we only
suspected.

On Saturday night I met Mr. Tresham again in Lincoln's Inn Walks. Wherein he
told such speeches, that my Lord of Salisbury should use to the King, that I
gave it lost the second time, and repeated the same to Mr. Catesby, who
hereupon was resolved to be gone, but staid to have Mr. Percy come up, whose
consent herein we wanted. On Sunday Mr. Percy being dealt with to that end,
would needs abide the uttermost trial.

This suspicion of all hands, put us into such confusion, as Mr. Catesby
resolved to go down into the Country, the Monday that Mr. Percy went to Sion,
and Mr. Percy resolved to follow the same night, or early the next morning.
About five of the clock being Tuesday, came the younger Wright to my Chamber,
and told me, that a Nobleman, called the Lord Mountegle, saying, Arise, and
come along to Essex-house, for I am going to call up my Lord of Northumberland,
saying withal, The matter is discovered. Go back Mr. Wright (quoth I) and learn
what you can about Essex Gate. Shortly he returned and said, surely all is
lost: for Lepton is got on horseback at Essex door, and as he parted, he asked
if their Lordships would have any more with him: and being answered No, is rode
fast up Fleetstreet as he can ride. Go you then (quoth I) to Mr. Percy, for
sure it is for him they seek, and bid him be gone, I will stay and see the
uttermost. Then I went to the Court-Gates, and found them straightly guarded,
so as no body could enter. From thence I went down toward the
Parliament House, and in the middle of King Street found the Guard standing,
that would not let me pass, And as I returned, I heard one say, There is a
Treason discovered, in which the King and the Lords should have been blown up.
So then I was fully satisfied that all was known, and went to the Stable where
my Gelding stood, and rode into the Country. Mr. Catesby had appointed our
meeting at Dunchurch, but I could not overtake them, until I came to my
brothers, which was Wednesday night. On Thursday we took the Armor at my Lord
Windsors, and went that night to one Stephen Littleton's house, where the next
day (being Friday) as I was early abroad to discover, my man came to me, and
said, That an heavy mischance had severed all the company, for that Mr.
Catesby, Mr. Rookwood, and Mr. Grant, were burned with Gunpowder, upon which
sight, the rest dispersed. Mr. Littleton wished me to fly, and so would he. I
told him, I would first see the Body of my friend, and bury him, whatsoever
befell me. When I came, I found Mr. Catesby reasonable well, Mr. Percy, both the
Wrights, Mr. Rookwood, and Mr. Grant. I asked them what they resolved to do:
they answered, we mean here to die. I said again, I would take such part as
they did. About eleven of the clock came the company to beset the house, and as
I walked into the Court, I was shot into the shoulder, which lost me the use of
mine arm: with the next shot was the elder Wright stricken dead, after him the
younger Mr. Wright, and fourthly Ambrose Rookwood. Then said Mr. Catesby to me
(standing before the door they were to enter) Stand by me Tom, and we will die
together. Sir (quoth I) I have lost the use of my right arm, and I fear that
will cause me to be taken. So as we stood cIose together, Mr. Catesby, Mr.
Percy, and my self, they two were shot (as far as I could guess with one
Bullet) and then the company entered upon me, hurt me in the belly with a Pike,
and gave me other wounds, until one came behind, and caught hold of both mine
arms.

And so I remain yours, etc.

BUt here let us leave Fawks in a Lodging fit for such a Guest, and taking time
to advise upon his conscience; and turn our selves to that part of History,
which concerns the fortune of the rest of his partakers in that abominable
Trerson. The news was no sooner spread abroad that morning, which was upon a
Tuesday, the Fifth of November, and the First day designed for that Session of
Parliament; The news (I say) of this so strange and unlooked for accident, was
no sooner divulged, but some of those Conspirators, namely, Winter, and the two
Brothers of Wrights thought it high time for them to hasten out of the Town
(for Catesby was gone the night before, and Percy at four of the clock in the
morning the same day of the Discovery) and all of them held their course, with
more haste than good speed, to Warwickshire, toward Coventry, where the next
day morning, being Wednesday, and about the same hour that Fawkes was taken in
Westminster, one Grant, a Gentleman having associated unto him some others of
his opinion, all violent Papists, and strong Recusants, came to a Stable of one
Benock, a Rider of Great Horses, and having violently broken up the same,
carried The taking of the horses out of the Stable at Warwick by Grant and
others.
along with them all the great Horses that were therein, to the number of seven
or eight, belonging to diverse Noblemen and Gentlemen of that Country, who had
put them into the Riders hands to be made fit for their service. And so both
that company of them which fled out of London, as also Grant and his accomplices
met all together at Dunchurch at Sir Everard Digby his lodging the Wednesday at
night after the discovery of this treacherous Attempt: The which Digby had

part appointed a match of hunting to have been hunted the next day, which was
Wednesday, though his mind was Nimrod-like, upon a far other manner of
hunting, more bent upon the blood of reasonable men, than brute beasts.

This company, and hellish society thus convened, finding their purpose
discovered, and their treachery prevented, did resolve to Their going into Arms

run a desperate course, and since they could not prevail by so private a Blow,
to practice by a public Rebellion, either to attain to their Intents, or at
least to save themselves in the throng of others. And therefore gathering all
the company they could unto them and pretending the quarrel of Religion, having
intercepted such provision of Armor, Horses, and Powder, as the time could
permit, thought by running up and down the Country both to augment piece and
piece their number (dreaming to themselves that they had the virtue of a
Snow-ball, which being little at the first, and tumbling down from a great hill
grows to a great quantity, by increasing it self with the Snow that it
meets by the way) and also that they beginning first this brave show in one
part of the Country, should by their Sympathy and example stir up and
encourage the rest of their Religion in other parts of England to rise, as they
had done there. But when they had gathered their Force to the greatest, they
came not to the number of Fourscore, and yet were they troubled all the hours
of the day to keep and contain their own servants Their number never above Four
score.
from stealing from them; who (notwithstanding of all their care) daily left
them, being far inferior to Gedeons Host in number, but far more in faith, or
justness of Quarrel.

And so after that this Gatholique Troop had wandered a while through
Warwickshire to Worcestershire, and from thence to the edge and borders of
Staffordshire, this gallantly armed Band had not the honor at the last, to be
beaten with a Kings Lieutenant, or extraordinary Commissioner sent down for the
purpose, but only by the ordinary Sheriff of Worcestershire, were they all
beaten, killed, taken and dispersed. Wherein ye Their flight
have to note this following circumstance so admirable, and so vively
displaying the greatness of Gods justice, as it could not be concealed without
betraying in a manner the glory due to the Almighty for the same.

Although diverse of the Kings Proclamations were posted down after these
Traitors, with all the speed possible, declaring the odiousness of that bloody
attempt, the necessity to have Percy preserved alive, if it had been possible,
and the assembly together of that rightly damned crew, now no more darned
Conspirators, but open and avowed Rebels: yet the far distance of the way
(which was above an hundred miles) together with the extreme deepness thereof,
joined also with the shortness of the day, was the cause that the hearty and
loving affections of the Kings good Subjects in those parts prevented the speed
of His Proclamations. For upon the third day after the flying down of these
Rebels, which was upon the Friday next after the discovery of their Plot, they
were most Overtaken at Holbeach in Staffordshire, at Stephen Littleton's house.
of them all surprised by the Sheriff of Worcestershire at Holbeach, about the
noon of the day, and that in manner following.

Grant, of whom I have made mention before for taking the great Horses, who
had not all the preceding time stirred from his own house till the next morning
after the attempt should have been put in execution, he then laying his account
without his Host (as the proverb is) that their Plot had, without failing,
received the day before, their hoped for success; took, or rather stole out
those horses (as I said before) for enabling him, and so many of that soulless
society that had still remained in the Country near about him, to make a
sudden surprise upon the Kings elder Daughter, the Lady ELIZABETH, having her
residence near by that place, whom Grants attempt to surprise the Lady
Elizabeth.
they thought to have used for the color of their treacherous design (His
Majesty her Father, her Mother, and male Children being all destroyed above)
And to this purpose also ^ad that Nimrod Digby, provided his hunt^ng match
against that same time, that numbers of people being flocked together upon the
pretense thereof, they might the easilier have brought to pass the sudden
surprise of her Person.

Now the violent taking away of those horses long before day, did seem to be so
great a riot in the eyes of the Common people, that knew of no greater Mystery:
And the bold attempting thereof, did engender such a suspicion of some
following Rebellion in the hearts of the wiser sort, as both great and small
began to stir and arm themselves, upon this unlooked for accident. Among whom,
Sir Fulke Grevil the elder, Knight, as became one both so ancient in years, and
good reputation, and by his Office being Deputy-Lieutenant of Warwickshire tho
unable in his Body, yet by the zeal and true fervency of his mind, did first
apprehend this foresaid Riot, to be nothing but the sparkles and sure indices
of a following Rebellion; whereupon both stoutly and honestly he took order to
get into his own hands, the Munition and Armor of all such Gentlemen about him,
as were either absent from their own houses, or in doubtful guard; And also
sent such direction to the Towns about him, as thereupon did follow the
striking of Winter by a poor Smith, who had likewise been taken by those vulgar
people, but that he was rescued by the rest of his company, who perceiving that
the Country before them, had notice of them, hastened away with the loss in
their own sight, Sixteen of their followers being taken by the Townsmen, and
sent presently to the Sheriff at Warwick, and from thence to London.

But before Twelve or Sixteen hours past, Catesby, Percy the Winters, Wrights,
Rookwood, and the rest, bringing then the assurance, that their main Plot was
failed and bewrayed, whereupon they had builded the golden Mountains of their
glorious hopes: They then took their last desperate resolution to flock
together in a Troop and wander, as they did, for the reasons aforetold. But as
upon the one part, the zealous duty to their God and their Sovereigne was so
deeply imprinted in the hearts of all the meanest and poorest sort of the
people (although then knowing of no further mystery than such public
misbehaviours, as their own eyes taught them) as notwithstanding of their fair
shows and pretense of their Catholic cause, no creature, Man or Woman through
all the Country, would once so much as give them willingly a cup of drink, or
any sort of comfort or support, but with execrations detested them: So on the
other part, the Sheriffs of the Shires, where through they wandered, convening
their people with all speed possible, hunted as hotly after them, as the
evilness of the way, and the unprovidedness of their people upon that sudden
could permit them. And so at last after Sir Richard Verney, Sheriff of

Warwickshire, had carefully and straightly been in chase of them to the
confines of his County, part of the meaner sort being also apprehended by him:
Sir Richard W^lsh Sheriff of Worcestershire did likewis^ dutifully and hotly
pursue them through his Shire; and having gotten sure trial of their taking
harbor at the house above named, he did send Trumpeters and Messengers to them,
commanding them in the Kings name to render unto him, His Majesty's Minister;
and knowing no more at that time of their guilt, than was publicly visible,
did promise, upon their dutiful and obedient rendering unto him to intercede at
the Kings hands, for the sparing of their lives: Who received only from them
this scornful answer (they being better witnesses to themselves of their inward
evil consciences) That he had need of better assistance, than of those few
numbers that were with him, before he could be able to command or control them.

But here fell the wondrous work of Gods The prepa^tion to assault the house.
Justice, That while this message passed between the Sheriff and them, The
Sheriff's and his people's zeal being justly kindled and augmented by their
arrogant answer, and so they preparing themselves to give a furious assault;
and the other party making themselves ready within the house to perform their
promise by a defense as resolute; It pleased GOD, that in the mending of the
fire in their chamber, one small sparkle should fly out, and light among less
than two pound weight of Powder, which was drying a little from the chimney;
which being thereby blown up, so maimed the faces of some of the principal
Rebels, and the hands and sides of others of them (blowing up with it also a
great bag full of Powder, which notwithstanding never took fire) as they were
not only disabled, and discouraged hereby from any further resistance, in
respect Catesby himself, Rookwood, Grant, and diverse others of greatest

manner of working the same by Powder, in special, himself now first maimed with

account, among them were thereby made unable for defense: but also wonderfully
stricken with amazement in their guilty consciences, calling to memory, how GOD
had justly punished them with that same Instrument, which they should have used
for the effectuating of so great a sin, according to the old Latin saying, In
quo peccamus, in eodem plectimur, as they presently (see the wonderful power of
Gods justice upon guilty consciences) did all fall down upon their knees,
praying GOD to pardon them for their bloody enterprise; And thereafter giving
over any further debate, opened the Gate, suffered the Sheriffs people to rush
in furiously among them, and desperately sought their own present destruction;
The three specials of them joining backs together, Catesby, Percy, and Winter,
whereof two with one shot, Catesby, and Percy were slain, and the third,
Winter, taken and saved alive.

And thus these resolute and high aspiring Catholics, who dreamed of no less
than the destruction of Kings and Kingdoms, and promised to themselves no
lower estate than the Government of great and ancient Monarchies; were
miserably defeated, and quite overthrown in an instant, falling in the pit
which they had prepared for others; and so fulfilling that sentence which his
Majesty did in a manner prophecy of them, In his Oration to the Parliament:
some presently slain, others deadly wounded, stripped of their Clothes, left
lying miserably naked, and so dying rather of cold, then of the danger of their
wounds; and the rest that either were whole, or but lightly hurt, taken and led
prisoners by the Sheriff, the ordinary Minister of Justice, to the Jail, the
ordinary place even of the basest Malefactors, where they remained till their
sending up to London, being met with a huge confluence of people of all sorts,
desirous to see them, as the rarest sort of Monsters; fools to laugh at them,
women and children to wonder, all the common people to gaze, the wiser sort to
satisfy their curiosity, in seeing the outward cases of so unheard of a
villainy: and generally all sorts of people, to satiate and fill their eyes with
the sight of them, whom in their hearts they so far admired and detested:
Serving so for a fearful and public spectacle of Gods fierce wrath and just
indignation.

What hereafter will be done with them, is to be left to the Justice of His
Majesty and the State. Which as no good Subject needs to doubt will be
performed in the own due time by a public and an exemplary punishment: So have
we all that are faithful and humble subjects, great cause to pray earnestly to
the Almighty, that it will please him who has the hearts of all Princes in his
hands, to put it in his Majesty's heart to make such a conclusion of this
Tragedy to the Traitors, but Tragicomedy to the King and all his true Subjects;
as thereby the glory of God and his true Religion may be advanced, the future
security of the King and his estate procured and provided for, all hollow and
unhonest hearts discovered and prevented, and this horrible attempt (lacking
due Epithites) to be so justly avenged, That where they thought by one
Catholic indeed, and Universal blow, to accomplish the wish of that As Aeneas
Sylvius does notably Write concerning the Murder of King James the First of
Scotland, and the following punishment of the Traitors, whereof himself was an
Eyewitness. Hist. de Europa, cap (...)
Roman Tyrant, who wished all the bodies in Rome to have but one neck, and so
by the violent force of Powder to break up as with a Pettard our triple locked
peaceful Gates of Ianus, which (God be thanked) they could not compass by any
other means; they may justly be so recompensed for their truly viperous
intended Parricide, as the shame and infamy that otherwise would light upon
this whole Nation, for having unfortunately hatched such Cockatrice eggs, may
be repaired by the execution of famous and honorable Justice upon the
Offenders, and so the Kingdom purged of them, may hereafter perpetually
flourish in peace and prosperity, by the happy conjunction of the hearts of all
honest and true Subjects, with their just and Religious Sovereign.

And thus, whereas they thought to have effaced our memories, the memory of
them shall remain (but to their Perpetual Infamy) and we (as I said in the
beginning) shall, with all thankfulness, eternally preserve the memory of so
great a benefit. To which let every good Subject say,

AMEN.
The Brief of the Matters whereupon Robert Winter, Esquire. Thomas Winter, Gent.
Guy Fawkes, Gent. John Grant, Esquire. Ambrose Rookwood, Esquire. Robert Keys, Gent.
Thomas Bates, were Indicted, and whereupon they were Arraigned.
THat whereas our Sovereign Lord the King had, by the The effect of the
Indictment after the Legal form of the Common Law of England.
advise and assent of his Council, for diverse weighty and urgent occasions,
concerning his Majesty, the State, and defense of the Church and Kingdom of
England, appointed a Parliament to be holden at his City of Westminister: That
Henry Garnet, Superior of the Jesuits within the Realm of England, (called also
by the several names of Wally, Darcy, Roberts, Farmer, and Henry Philips)
Oswald Tesmond Jesuit, otherwise called Oswald Greenwel; John Gerrard Jesuit,
(called also by the several names of Lee and Brook) Robert Winter, Thomas
Winter, Gentlemen, Guy Fawkes, Gent. otherwise called Guy Johnson; Robert Keys
Gent. and Thomas Bates Yeoman, late Servant to Robert Catesby Esquire. together
with the said Robert Catesby and Thomas Piercy, Esquires; John Wright and
Christopher Wright, Gent. in open Rebellion and Insurrection against his
Majesty, lately slain, and Francis Tresham Esquire. lately dead, as false Traitors
against our said Sovereign Lord the King, did Traitorously meet and assemble
themselves together; and being so met, the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond,
John Gerrard, and other Jesuits, did maliciously, falsely, and traitorously move
and persuade as well the said Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, and
Thomas Bates; as the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright,
Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham; That our said Sovereign Lord the King,
the Nobility, Clergy, and the whole Commonalty of the Reof England (Papists
excepted) were Heretics, and that all Heretics were accursed and
Excommunicate; and that no Heretic could be a King, but that it was lawful and
meritorious to kill our said Sovereign Lord the King, and all other Heretics
within this Realm of England, for the advancing and enlargement of the
pretended and usurped Authority and Jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, and for
the restoring of the Superstitious Romish Religion within this Realm of
England. To which Traitorous persuasions, the said Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes,
Robert Keys, Thomas Bates, Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright,
Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham, traitorously did yield their assents:
And that thereupon the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, and
diverse other Jesuits; Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, and Thomas Bates;
as also the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher Wright,
and Francis Tresham, traitorously among themselves did conclude and agree, with
Gunpowder, as it were with one blast, suddenly, traitorously, and barbarously
to blow up and tear in pieces our said Sovereign Lord the King, the Excellent,
Virtuous, and Gracious Queen Anne his dearest Wife, the most Noble Prince Henry
their Eldest Son, the future Hope and Joy of England, and the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal; the Reverend Judges of the Realm, the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of Parliament, and diverse other faithful Subjects and Servants of the
King in the said Parliament, for the causes aforesaid, to be assembled in the
House of Parliament; and all of them, without any respect of Majesty, Dignity,
Degree, Sex, Age, or Place, most barbarously, and more than beastly,
traitorously and suddenly, to destroy and swallow up. And further did most
traitorously conspire and conclude among themselves, That not only the whole
Royal Issue Male of our said Sovereign Lord the King should be destroyed and
rooted out, but that the Persons aforesaid, together with diverse other false
Traitors, traitorously with them to be assembled, should surprise (...) Persons
of the Noble Ladies, Elizabeth and Mary, Daughters of our said Sovereign Lord
the King, and falsely and traitorously should Proclaim said Lady Elizabeth to be
the Queen of this Realm of England; and thereupon should publish a certain
traitorous Proclamation in the Name of the said Lady Elizabeth, wherein it was
especially agreed, by and between the said Conspirators, That no mention should
be made at the first of the alteration of Religion established within this
Realm of England; neither would the said false Traitors therein acknowledge
themselves to be Authors, or Actors, or Devisors of the foresaid most wicked
and horrible Treasons, until they had got sufficient power and strength for the
assured execution and accomplishment of their said Conspiracy and Treason, and
that then they would avow and justify the said most wicked and horrible
Treasons, as Actions that were in the number of those, Quae non laudantur nisi
peracta, which be not to be commended before they be done. But by the said
feigned and traitorous Proclamation they would publish, That all and singular
abuses and grievances within this Realm of England, should, for satisfying of
the People, be reformed. And that as well for the better concealing, as for the
more effectual accomplishing of the said horrible Treasons, as well the said
Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, and Thomas Bates; as the said Robert
Catesby, Thomas Piercy, John Wright, Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham,
by the traitorous advice and procurement of the said H^ry Garnet, Oswald
Tesmond, John Gerrard, and other Jesuits, traitorously did further conclude and
agree, That as well the said Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, and
Thomas Bates, as the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Piercy, John Wright,
Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham, thereupon severally and traitorously
should receive several corporal Oaths upon the holy Evangelists, and the
Sacrament of the Eucharist, That they the Treasons aforesaid would traitorously
conceal and keep secret, and would not reveal them directly nor indirectly, by
words nor circumstances; nor ever would desist from the execution and final
accomplishment of the said Treasons, without the consent of some three of the
foresaid false Traitors first in that behalf Traitorously had. And that
thereupon, as well the said Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, and Thomas
Bates, as the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Piercy, John Wright, Christopher
Wright, and Francis Tresham, did traitorously take the said several corporal
Oaths severally, and did receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist aforesaid by
the hands of the said Henry Garnet, John Gerrard, Oswald Tesmond, and other
Jesuits. And further, that the said Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys,
and Thomas Bates; together with the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Piercy, John
Wright, Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham, by the like traitorous advise
and counsel of the said Henry Garnet, John Gerrard, Oswald Tesmond, and other
Jesuits, for the more effectual compassing and final execution of the said
Treasons, did traitorously amongst them selves conclude and agree, to dig a
certain Mine under the said House of Parliament, and there secretly under the
said House to bestow and place a great quantity of Gunpowder; and that
according to the said traitorous conclusion, the said Thomas Winter, Guy
Fawkes, Robert Keys, and Thomas Bates; together with the said Robert Catesby,
Thomas Piercy, John Wright, and Christopher Wright, afterward secretly, not
without great labor and difficulty, did dig and make the said Mine unto the
midst of the foundation of the wall of the said house of Parliament, the said
foundation being of the thickness of three yards, with a traitorous intent to
bestow and place a great quantity of Gunpowder in the Mine aforesaid, so as
aforesaid traitorously to be made for the traitorous accomplishing of their
traitorous purposes aforesaid, and that the said Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes,
Robert Keys, and Thomas Bates, together with the said Robert Catesby, Thomas
Percy, John Wright, and Christopher Wright, finding and perceiving the said
work to be of great difficulty by reason of the hardness and thickness of the
said wall, and understanding a certain Cellar under the said house of
Paliament, and adjoining to a certain house of the said Thomas Percy then to be
letten to farm for a yearly Rent, the said Thomas Percy, by the traitorous
procurement as well of the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John John Gerrard
and other Jesuits, Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, and Thomas Bates,
as of the said Robert Catesby, John Wright and Christopher Wright, traitorously
did hirethe Cellar aforesaid for a certain yearly Rent and term; and then those
Traitors did remove twenty barrels full of gunpowder out of the said house of
the said Thomas Percy, and secretly and traitorously did bestow and place them
in the Cellar aforesaid under the said House of Parliament, for the traitorous
effecting of the Treason, and traitorous purposes aforesaid. And that
afterward the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, and other
Jesuits, Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys and Thomas Bates, together
with the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright and Christopher Wright,
traitorously did meet with Robert Winter, John Grant, and Ambrose Rookwood and
Francis Tresham Esquires, and traitorously did impart to the said Robert
Winter, John Grant, and Ambrose Rookwood and Francis Tresham, the Treasons,
traitorous intentions and purposes aforesaid, and did require the said Robert
Winter, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood and Francis Tresham, to join themselves as
well with the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, Thomas Winter,
Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys and Thomas Bates, as with the said Robert Catesby,
Thomas Percy, John Wright and Christopher Wright, and in the Treasons,
traitorous intentions, and purposes aforesaid, and traitorously to provide
horse, armor, and other necessaries, for the better accomplishment and
effecting of the said Treasons; To which traitorous motion and request, the
said Robert Winter, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood and Francis Tresham, did
traitorously yield their Assents, and as well with the said Henry Garnet,
Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, Robert Winter, Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert
Keys, and Thomas Bates, as with the said Rob. Catesby, Thomas Percy, John
Wright, Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham, in the said Treasons,
traitorous intentions and purposes aforesaid, traitorously did adhere and unite
themselves; And thereupon several corporal Oaths in form abovesaid
Traitorously did take, and the Sacrament of the Eucharist by the hand of the
said Jesuits did receive, to such intent and purpose as is aforesaid; And
horses, armor, and other necessaries, for the better effecting of the said
Treasons, according to their traitorous assents aforesaid traitorously did
provide; And that afterward all the said false Traitors did traitorously
provide and bring into the Cellar aforesaid, ten other barrels full of
Gunpowder newly bought, fearing least the former Gunpowder so as aforesaid
bestowed and placed there, was become Dankish, and the said several quantities
of Gunpowder aforesaid, with Billets and Fagots, least they should be spied,
secretly and traiterosly did cover; And that afterward the said Traitors
traitorously provided and brought into the Cellar aforesaid, four Hogsheads
full of Gunpowder, and laid diverse great Iron Bars, and stones upon the said
four Hogsheads, and the (...) other quanties of Gunpowder; And the said
quanties of Gunpowder, Bars and stones, with Billets and Fagots, lest they
should be espied, secretly and traitorously did likewise cover; And that the
said Guy Fawkes afterward for afull and final accomplishment of ^he said
Treasons, traitorous intentions and purposes aforesaid, by the traitorous
procurement as well of the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, and
other Jesuits, Robert Winter, Thomas Winter, Robert Keys, Thomas Bates, John
Grant, and Ambrose Rookwood, as of the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John
Wright, Christopher Wright, and Francis Tresham, traitorously had prepared, and
had upon his person Touchwood and Match, therewith traitorously to give fire to
the several Barrels, Hogsheads and quantities of Gunpowder aforesaid, at the
time appointed for the execution of the said horrible Treasons; And further,
that after the said horrible Treasons were by the great favor and mercy of God
in a wonderful manner discovered, not many hours before it should have been
executed, as well the said Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerard, Robert
Winter, Thomas Winter, Robert Keys, Thomas Bates, John Grant, and Ambrose
Rookwood, as the said Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, and
Christopher Wright, Traitorously did fly and withdraw themselves, to the
intent Traitorously to stir up, and procure such Popish persons as they could,
to join with them in actual, public and open Rebellion, against our said
Sovereign Lord the King, and to that end did publish diverse fained and false
rumors, that the Papists throats should have been cut: And that thereupon
diverse Papists were in Arms, and in open public and Actual Rebellion against
our said Sovereign Lord the King, in diverse parts of this Realm of England.

To this Indictment, they all pleaded, Not Guilty; and put themselves upon God
and the Country.

Then did Sir Edward Philips Knight, his Majesty's Sergeant at Law, open the
Indictment to this effect as follows.
THe matter that is now to be offered to you, my Lords the Commissioners, and
to the Trial of you the Knights and Gentlemen of the Jury, is matter of
Treason; but of such horror, and monstrous nature, that before now,

The Tongue of Man never delivered, The Ear of Man never heard, The Heart of
Man never conceited,
Nor the Malice of Hellish or Earthly Devil ever practiced.

For, if it be abominable to murder the least;

If to touch Gods Anointed, be to oppose themselves against God;

If (by blood) to subvert Princes, States, and Kingdoms, be hateful to God and
Man, as all true Christians must acknowledge;

Then, how much more than too too monstrous shall all Christian hearts judge
the horror of this Treason, to murder and subvert,

Such a King, Such a Queen, Such a Prince, Such a Progeny, Such a State, Such a
Government,
So complete and absolute;

That God approves:

The World admires:

All true English Hearts honor and reverence:

The Pope and his Disciples only envies and maligns.

The Proceeding wherein is properly to be divided into three general Heads.
1. First, Matter of Declaration. 2. Secondly, Matter of Aggravation. 3.
Thirdly, Matter of Probation.
My self am limited to deal only with the matter of Declaration, and that is
contained within the compass of the Indictment only.

For the other two, I am to leave to him to whose place it belongs.

The Substance of which Declaration consists in four parts.
1. First, in the Persons and Qualities of the Conspirators. 2. Secondly, in
the Matter conspired. 3. Thirdly, in the mean and manner of the proceeding and
execution of the Conspiracy. 4. And Fourthly, of the end and purpose why it was
so conspired.
As concerning the first, being the Persons.
They were Garnet, Jesuits not then taken. Gerrard, Tesmond,

Thomas Winter, At the Bar. Guy Fawkes, Robert Keys, Thomas Bates, Everard
Digby, Ambrose Rookewood, John Grant, Robert Winter.

Robert Catesby, Slain in Rebellion. Thomas Piercy, John Wright, Christopher
Wright.

Francis Tresham, Lately dead.

All grounded Romanists, and corrupted Scholars of so Irreligious and
Traitorous a School.

As concerning the second, which is the Matter Conspired, it was,
1. First, to deprive the King of his Crown. 2. Secondly, to murder the King,
the Queen, and the Prince. 3. Thirdly, to stir Rebellion and Sedition in the
Kingdom. 4. Fourthly, to bring a miserable destruction among the Subjects. 5.
Fifthly, to change, alter, and subvert the Religion here established. 6.
Sixthly, to ruinate the state of the Commonwealth, and to bring in Strangers to
invade it.
As concerning the third, which is the mean and manner how to compass and
execute the same.
They did all conclude,
1. First, that the King and his People (the Papists excepted) were Heretics.
2. Secondly, that they were all cursed, and Excommunicate by the Pope. 3.
Thirdly, that no Heretic could be King. 4. Fourthly, that it was lawful and
meritorious to kill and destroy the King, and all the said Heretics.
The mean to effect it, they concluded to be, That
1. The King, the Queen, the Prince, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Knights and Burgesses of the Parliament, should be blown up with Powder.

2. That the whole Royal Issue Male should be destroyed.

3. That they would take into their custody Elizabeth and Mary, the Kings
Daughters, and proclaim the Lady Elizabeth Queen.

4. That they should feign a Proclamation in the Name of Elizabeth, in which no
mention should be made of alteration of Religion, nor that they were parties to
the Treason, until they had raised power to perform the same, and then to
proclaim, All grievances in the Kingdom should be reformed.

That they also took several Oaths, and received the Sacrament; first, for
secrecy: secondly, for prosecution, except they were discharged thereof by
three of them.

That after the destruction of the King, the Queen, the Prince, the Royal Issue
Male, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Knights and Burgesses; they should
notify the same to Foreign States; and thereupon Sir Edmund Baynam, an
attainted person of Treason, and stiling himself prime of the damned Crew,
should be sent, and make the same known to the Pope, and crave his aid: An
Ambassador fit, both for the Message and Persons, to be sent betwixt the Pope
and the Devil.

That the Parliament being Prorogued till the 7th. of February, they in
December made a Mine under the House of Parliament, purposing to place their
Powder there: but the Parliament being then further Adjourned till the 3d. of
October, they in Lent following hired the Vault, and placed therein twenty
barrels of powder.

That they took to them Robert Winter, Grant, and Rookwood, giving them the
Oaths and Sacrament as aforesaid, as to provide Munition.

20 Iulii they laid in more ten Barrels of Powder, laying upon them diverse
great Bars of Iron, and pieces of Timber, and great massy Stones, and covered
the same with Fagots, etc.

20 September. they laid in more four Hogsheads of Powder, with other Stones and
Bars of Iron thereupon.

4 November. (the Parliament being Prorogued to the 5th.) at eleven a clock at
night, Fawkes had prepared (by the procurement of the rest) Touch-wood and
Match, to give fire to the Powder the next day.

That the Treason being miraculously discovered, they put themselves, and
procured others to enter into open Rebellion; and gave out most untruly, It
was, for that the Papists throats were to be cut.

The Effect of that which Sir Edward Coke, Knight, his Majesty's Attorney
General, said at the former Arraignment, so near to his own words as it could
be taken.
IT appears to your Lordships, and the rest of this most Honorable and Grave
Assembly, even by that which Mr. Sergeant has already opened, that these are
the greatest Treasons that ever were plotted in England, and concern the
greatest King that ever was of England. But when this Assembly shall further
hear, and see discovered the Roots and Branches of the same, not hitherto
published, they will say indeed: Quis haec posteris sic narrare poterit, ut
facta non ficta esse videantur? That when these things shall be related to
Posterity, they will be reputed matters feigned, not done. And therefore in
this so great a cause, upon the carriage and event whereof the eye of all
Christendom is at this day bent, I shall desire that I may with your patience
be somewhat more copious, and not so succinct as my usual manner has been, and
yet will I be no longer than the very matter it self shall necessarily require.
But before I enter into the particular Narration of this cause, I hold it fit
to give satisfaction to some, and those well-affected amongst us, who have not
only marvelled, but grieved, that no speedier expedition has been used in
these proceedings, considering the monstrousness and continual horror of this
so desperate a cause.

1. It is Ordo Naturae, agreeable to the order of Nature, that things of great
weight and magnitude should slowly proceed, according to that of the Poet,
Tarda solet magnis rebus adesse fides. And surely of these things we may truly
say, Nunquam ante dies nostros talia acciderunt, Neither has the eye of man
seen, nor the ear of man heard the like things to these.

2. Veritas Temporis filia, Truth is the daughter of Time, especially in this
case; wherein by timely and often Examinations, First, matters of greatest
moment have been lately found out. Secondly, some known Offenders, and those
capital, but lately apprehended. Thirdly, sundry of the principal and
Arch-traytors before unknown, now manifested, as the Jesuits. Fourthly,
Heretical, Treasonable, and damnable Books lately found out, one of
Equivocation, and another De officio Principis Christiani, of Francis Tresham's.

3. There have been already twenty and three several days spent in Examinations.

4. We should otherwise have hanged a man unattainted, for Guy Fawkes passed
for a time under the name of John Johnson: So that if by that name greater
expedition had been made, and he hanged, though we had not missed of the man,
yet the proceeding would not have been so orderly or justifiable.

5. The King out of his wisdom and great moderation, was pleased to appoint
this Trial in time of Assembly in Parliament, for that it concerned especially
those of the Parliament.

Now touching the offenses themselves, they are so exorbitant and transcendent,
and aggregated of so many bloody and fearful crimes, as they cannot be
aggravated by any inference, argument or circumstance whatsoever, and that in
three respects: First, because this offense is Primae impressionis, and
therefore sine Nomine, without any name which might be adaequatum, sufficient
to express it, given by any Legist, that ever made or writ of any Laws. For the
highest Treason that all they could imagine, they called it only Crimen laesae
Majestatis, the violating of the Majesty of the Prince. But this Treason does
want an apt name, as tending not only to the hurt, but to the death of the
King; and not the death of the King only, but of his whole Kingdom, Non Regis,
sed Regni, that is, to the destruction and dissolution of the frame and Fabric
of this Ancient, Famous, and ever-flourishing Monarchy, even the deletion of
our whole Name and Nation: And therefore hold Psalm. 83. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence, refrain not thy self, O God:
for lo thine enemies make a murmuring, and they that hate thee have lift up
their heads; They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no
more a people, and that the Name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Secondly, it is Sine exemplo, beyond all examples, whether in fact or fiction,
even of the Tragic Poets, who did beat their wits to represent the most
fearful and horrible murders. Thirdly, it is Sine modo, without all measure or
stint of iniquity, like a Mathematical line, which is Divisibilis in semper
divisibilia, infinitely divisible: It is Treason to imagine or intend the the
death of the King, Queen, or Prince.

For Treason is like a Tree, whose root is full of poison, and lies secret and
hid within the earth, resembling the imagination of the heart of man, which is
so secret as God only knows it. Now the wisdom of the Law provideth for the
blasting and nipping both of the leaves, blossoms and buds which proceed from
this root of Treason, either by words which are like to leaves, or by some
overt Act, which may be resembled to buds or blossoms, before it comes to such
fruit and ripeness as would bring utter destruction and desolation upon the
whole State.

It is likewise Treason to kill the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or any
Justice of the one Bench or other, Justices of Assise, or any other Judge
mentioned in the Statute of 25 Edw. 3. sitting in their Judicial places, and
exercising their Offices. And the reason is, for that every Judge so sitting by
the King's Authority, represents the Majesty and Person of the King, and
therefore it is Crimen laesae Majestatis, to kill him, the King being always in
Judgment of Law present in Court. But in the High Court of Parliament, every
man by virtue of the King's Authority by Writ under the Great Seal, has a
Judicial place, and so consequently the killing of every of them had been a
several Treason, and Crimen laesae Majestatis. Besides, that to their Treasons
were added open Rebellion, Burglary, Robbery, Horse-stealing, etc. So that this
offense is such as no man can express it, no example pattern it, no measure
contain it.

Concerning Foreign Princes, there was here a protestation made for the
clearing of them from all imputation or aspersion whatsoever. First, for that
whilst Kingdoms stood in hostility, hostile Actions are holden honorable and
just. Secondly, it is not the King's Sergeant, Attorney, or Solicitor, that in
any sort touch or mention them: for we know that great Princes and Personages
are reverently and respectively to be spoken of, and that there is Lex in
Sermon tenenda. But it is Faux, Winter, and the rest of the Offenders, that
have confessed so much as has been said; and therefore the Kings Council
learned does but repeat the Offenders Confession, and charge or touch no other
person. They have also slandered unjustly our great Master King James, which we
only repeat, to show the wickedness and malice of the Offenders. Thirdly, so
much as is said concerning Foreign Princes, is so woven into the matter of the
charge of these Offenders, as it cannot be severed or singled from the rest of
the matter. So as it is inevitable, and cannot be pretermitted.

Now as this Powder Treason is in it self prodigious and unnatural, so is it in
the Conception and Birth most monstrous, as arising out of the dead ashes of
former Treasons. For it had three Roots, all planted and watered by Jesuits,
and English Romish Catholics: The first Root in England, in December and
March; the second in Flanders, in June; the third in Spain, in July. In England
it had two Branches; One in December was twelve months, before the death of
the late Queen of blessed memory: Another in March, wherein she died.

First, in December, Anno Dom. 1601. do Henry Garnet, Superior of the Jesuits
in England; Robert Tesmond, Jesuit; Robert Catesby, who was (homo subacto and
versuto ingenio, and profunda perfidia) together with Francis Tresham, and
others; in the names, and for the behalf of all the English Romish Catholics,
employ Thomas Winter into Spain, as for the general good of the Romish
Catholic cause: And by him does Garnet write his Letters to Father Creswel,
Jesuit, residing in Spain, in that behalf. With Thomas Winter does Tesmond,
alias Greeneway the Jesuit go, as an Associate and Confederate in that
Conspiracy. The Message (which was principally committed unto the said Winter)
was, that he should make a proposition and request to the King of Spain, in the
behalf and names of the English Catholics, that the King would send an Army
hither into England, and that the Forces of the Catholics in England should be
prepared to join with him, and do him service. And further, that he should move
the King of Spain to bestow some Pensions here in England, upon sundry Persons
Catholics, and devoted to his service: And moreover to give advertisement,
that the said King of Spain, making use of the general coffeehouse that
young Gentlemen and Soldiers were in, might, no doubt, by relieving their
necessities, have them all at his devotion. And because that in all attempts
upon England, the greatest difficulty was ever found to be the transportation
of Horses; the Catholics in England would assure the King of Spain, to have
always in readiness for his use and service 1500 or 2000 Horses, against any
occasion or enterprise. Now Thomas Winter undertaking this Negotiation, and
with Tesmond the Jesuit coming into Spain, by means of Father Creswel the
Legier Jesuit there, as has been said, had readily speech with Don Pedro
Francesa, second Secretary of State, to whom he imparted his Message, as also
to the Duke of Lerma; who assured him, that it would be an office very grateful
to his Master, and that it should not want his best furtherance.

Concerning the place for landing of the King of Spain's Army, which from the
English Romish Catholics he desired might be sent to invade the Land, it was
resolved, That if the Army were great, that Essex and Kent were judged fittest.
(Where note by the way, who was then Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports) If the
Army were small, and trusted upon succor in England, then Milford-Haven was
thought more convenient.

Now there being at that time Hostility betwixt both Kingdoms, the King of
Spain willingly embraced the motion, saying, That he took the message from the
Catholics very kindly, and that in all things he would respect them with as
great care as his proper Castilians. But for his further Answer, and full
dispatch, Thomas Winter was appointed to attend the Progress. In the end
whereof, being in Summertime, Count Miranda gave him this Answer in the behalf
of his Master, That the King would bestow a hundred thousand Crowns to that
use, half to be paid that year, and the rest the next Spring following. And
withal required, that we should be as good as our promise; for the next Spring
he meant to be with us, and set foot in England. And lastly, he desired on the
Kings behalf of Winter, that he might have certain advertisement and
intelligence, if so it should in the mean time happen that the Queen did die.
Thomas Winter, laden with these hopes, returns into England about a month
before Christmas, and delivered answer of all that had passed to Henry Garnet,
Robert Catesby, and Francis Tresham. But soon after Set that Glorious Light,
her Majesty died. Mira cano: Soloccubuit, Nox nulla secuta est.

Presently after whose death was Christopher Wright, another Messenger, sent
over into Spain by Garnet, (who likewise did write by him to Creswel for the
furtherance of the Negotiation) Catesby and Tresham, in the name and behalf of
all the Romish Catholics in England, as well to carry news of her Majesty's
death, as also to continue the aforesaid Negotiation for an Invasion and
Pensions, which, by Thomas Winter, had before been dealt in. And in the Spanish
Court, about two months after his arrival there, does Christopher Wright meet
with Guy Fawkes, who upon the two and twentieth of June was employed out of
Flanders from Bruxels, by Sir W^lliam Stanley, Hugb Owen, (whose finger had
been in every Treason which has been of late years detected) and Baldwyn the
Ledger Jesuit in Flanders; from whom likewise the said Fawkes carried Letters to
Creswel in Spain, for the countenancing and furtherance of his ^ffairs.

Now the end of Fawkes his employment (...) to give advertisement to the King
of (...), how the King of England was like to ^ceed rigorously with the
Catholics, and to run the same course which the late Queen did; and withal to
entreat that it would please him to send an Army into England to Milford Haven
where the Romish Catholics would be ready to assist him, and then the Forces
that should be transported in Spinola's Galleys, should be landed where they
could most conveniently. And these their several messages did Christopher
Wright and Guy Fawkes in the end intimate and propound to the King of Spain.
But the King as then very honorably answered them both, that he would not in
any wise further listen to any such motion, as having before dispatched an
Embassage into England to Treat concerning peace; Therefore this course by
foreign forces failing, they fell to the Powder plot, Catesby and Tresham
being in at all, in the Treason of the Earl of Essex, in the Treason of Watson
and Clarke, Seminary Priests, and also in this of the Jesuits, Such a greedy
appetite had they to practice against the State.

The rest of that which Master Attorney then spoke continuedly, was by himself
divided into three general parts. The first containing certain considerations
concerning this Treason. The second observations about the same. The third a
comparison of this Treason of the Jesuits, with that of the Seminary Priests,
and that other of Rawley and others. For the considerations concerning the
Powder Treason, they were in number eight: That is to say, 1 The persons by
whom, 2 The persons against whom, 3 The time when, 4 The place where, 5 The
means, 6 The end, 7 The secret contriving, And lastly, The admirable discovery
thereof.

1 For the persons offending, or by whom, they are of two sorts: either of the
Clergy, or Laity, and for each of them there is a several objection made.
Touching those of the Laity, it is by some given out, that they are such men as
admit just exception, either desperate in estate, or ba^e, or not settled in
their wits, such as are Sine Religione, Sine Sede, Sine Fide, Sine Re, and Sine
Spe, without Religion, without habitation, without credit, without means,
without hope; But (that no man, though never so wicked, may be wronged) true it
is they were Gentlemen of good houses, of excellent parts, howsoever most
perniciously seduced, abused, corrupted, and Jesuited, of very competent
fortunes and States; Besides that Percy was of the house of Northumberland, Sir
William Stanley, who principally employed Fawkes into Spain, and John Talbot of
Grafton, who at the least is in case of misprision of High Treason, both of
great and honorable families. Concerning those of the spiritualty, it is
likewise falsely said, that there is never a Religious man in this action. For I
never yet knew a Treason without a Romish Priest: but in this there are very
many Jesuits, who are known to have dealt, and passed through the whole action:
Three of them are Legiers and States men, as Henry Garnet, alias Walley, the
Superior of the Jesuits, Legier here in England, Father Creswell Legier Jesuit
in Spain, Father Baldwin Legier in Flaunders, as Parsons at Rome, besides their
Cursory men, as Gerrard, Oswald Tesmonda alias Greenway, Hamond, Hall, and
other Jesuits: So that the principal offenders are the seducing Jesuits, men
that use the reverence of Religion, yea even the most Sacred and Blessed name
of JESUS as a mantle to cover their impiety, blasphemy, treason, and rebellion,
and all manner of wickedness, as by the help of Christ shall be made most
apparent to the glory of God, and the honor of our Religion. Concerning this
Sect, their Studies and practices principally consist in two Degrees, to wit,
in Deposing of Kings, and Disposing of Kingdoms: their profession and doctrine
is a Religion of distinctions, the greatest part of them being without the
text, and therefore in very deed, idle and vain conceits of their own brains,
not having Membra dividentia, that is all the parts of the division warranted
by the word of God, and Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus.
And albeit that Princes hold their Crowns immediately of and from God, by right
of lawful Succession and inheritance inherent by Royal Blood, yet think these
Jesuits with a Goose quill, within four distinctions to remove the Crown from
the head of any King christened, and to deal with them as the old Romans are
said to have done with their Viceroys, or petty Kings, who in effect were but
Lieutenants unto them, to crown and uncrown them at their pleasures. Neither so
only, but they will proscribe and expose them to be butchered by vassals,
which is against their own Canons, for Priests to meddle in cause of blood. And
by this means they would make the condition of a King far worse than that of
the poorest creature that breaths. First says Simanca. Haeretici omnes ipso
Iure De Excom. tit. 27. Sect. 1. fol. 116. b.
sunt excommunicati, and a Communione fidelium diris proscriptionibus separati,
and quotannis in coena Domini excommunicantur a Papa: So then every Heretic
stands and is reputed with them as excommunicated and accursed, if not de
Facto, yet de Iure, in law and right to all their intents and purposes,
therefore may he be deposed, proscribed and murdered. I but suppose he be not a
professed Heretic, but deals reservedly, and keeps his conscience to
himself, how stands he then? Simanca answers, Quaeri autem solet, An De
oceultis tit. 42. Sect. 2. fol. 193.
Haereticus occultus excommunicatus sit ipso Iure, and in alias etiam poenas
incidat contra Haeriticos statutas? Cui quaestioni simpliciter Iurisperiti
respondent, Quod etsi haeresis occulta sit, nihilominus occultus Haeriticus
incidit in illas poenas. Whether he be a known or a secret Heretic all is one,
they thunder out the same Judgment and Curse for both: Whereas Christ says,
Nolite Iudicare, Judge not, which is, says Augustine, Nolite Iudicare de
occultis, of those things which are secret. But suppose that a Prince thus
accursed and deposed, will eftsoons return and conform himself to their Romish
Church, shall he then be restored to his State, and again receive his Kingdom?
Nothing less: For says Simanca, Si Reges aut alij Principes Christiani facti
sint Haeretici, protinus subjecti and vasalli ab eorum dominio liberantur. Nec
Ius hoc recuperabunt, quamvis postea reconcilientur Ecclesiae. O But Sancta
Matter Ecclesia nunquam claudit gremium redeunti, Our holy Mother the Church
never shuts her bosom to any Convert. It is true, say they, but with a
distinction, Quoad Animam: Therefore so he may, and shall be restored, that is,
spiritually, in respect of his souls health. Quoad Animam he shall again be
taken into the Holy Church, but not Quoad Regnum, in respect of his Kingdom or
State temporal he must not be restored. The reason is, Because all hold only
thus far, Modo non sit ad damnum Ecclesiae: So that the Church receive thereby
no detriment. I but suppose that such an unhappy deposed Prince have a Son, or
lawful and right heir, and he also not to be touched or spotted with his
Fathers crime, shall not he at the least succeed and be invested into that
Princely estate? Neither will this down with them: Heresy is a leprosy, an
hereditary disease. Et ex leprosis parentibus leprosi generantur filij. Of
leprous parents come leprous children. So that says Simanca: Propter Haeresim
Regis, non solum Rex Regno privatur, sed et ejus filij a Regni successione
pelluntur, ut noster Lupus, (who is indeed Vir secundum Nomen ejus, a Wolf as
well in nature as name,) luculenter probat. Now if any man doubt whom they here
mean by an Heretic, Creswell in his book called Philopater gives a plain
resolution, Regnandi Ius amittit (says he) qui Religionem Romanam deserit, He
is the Heretic we speak of, even whosoever forsakes the Religion of the Church
of Rome, he is accursed, deprived, proscribed, never to be absolved but by the
Pope himself, never to be restored either in himself or his posterity.

One place amongst many out of Creswells Philopater shall serve to give a taste
of the Jesuitical spirits and doctrine, which is Sect. 2. page 109. Hinc etiam
infert universa Theologorum ac Iurisconsultorum Ecclesiasticorum schola, (and
est certum and de fide) quemcunque Principem Christianum, si a Religione
Catholica manifesto diflexerit, and alios avocare voluerit, excidere statim
omni potestate ac dignitate, ex ipsa vi Iuris tum humani tum divini, hoc que
ante dictam sententiam Supremi Pastoris ac Iudicis contra ipsum prolatam, and
subditos quoscunque liberos esse ab omni Iuramenti obligatione, quod de
obedientia tanquam Principi legittimo praestitissent: posseque and debere, (si
vires habeant) istius modi hominem tanquam Apostatam, hereticum, ac Christi
Domini desertorem, and reipub. suae Inimicum hostemque ex hominum Christianorum
dominatu ejicere, ne alios inficiat, vel suo exemplo aut Imperio a fide
avertat; atque haec certa, definita and indubitata virorum doctissimorum
sententia. That is, this inference also does the whole School both of Divines
and Lawyers make, (and it is a Position certain, and to be undoubtedly
believed) that if any Christian Prince whatsoever, shall manifestly turn from
the Catholic Religion, and desire or seek to reclaim other men from the same,
he presently falls from all Princely Power and Dignity, and that also by
virtue and force of the Law it self, both Divine and Humane, even before any
Sentence pronounced against him by the Supreme Pastor and Judge. And that his
Subjects, of what estate or condition soever, are freed from all Bond of Oath
of Allegiance, which at any time they had made unto him, as to their lawful
Prince. Nay, that they both may and ought (provided they have competent
strength and force) cast out such a man from bearing rule amongst Christians,
as an Apostate, an Heretic, a backslider and revolter from our Lord Christ,
and an enemy to his own State and Commonwealth, lest perhaps he might infect
others, or by his example or command turn them from the Faith. And this is the
certain, resolute, and undoubted Judgment of the best learned men. But Tresham
in his Book De Officio Principis Christiani, goes beyond all the rest; for he
plainly concludes and determines, that if any Prince shall but favor, or
show countenance to an Heretic, he presently loses his Kingdom. In his fifth
Chapter he propounds this Problem, An aliqua possit secundum Conscientiam
Subditis esse Ratio, cur legitimo suo Regi, bellum sine scelere moveant?
Whether there may be any lawful cause, justifiable in Conscience, for Subjects
to take Arms, without sin, against their lawful Prince and Sovereign? The
resolution is, Si Princeps haereticus sit, and obstinate ac pertinaciter
intolerabilis, summi Pastoris divina potestate deponatur, and aliud caput
constituatur, cui Subditi se jungant, and legitimo ordine and authoritate
tyrannidem amoveant. Princeps indulgendo haereticos non solum Deum offendit,
sed perdit and Regnum, and gentem. Their conclusion therefore is; That for
heresy, as above is understood, a Prince is to be deposed, and his Kingdom
bestowed by the Pope at pleasure; and that the people, upon pain of damnation,
are to take part with him whom the Pope shall so Constitute over them. And thus
whilst they imagine with the wings of their light-feathered distinctions to
mount above the Clouds and level of vulgar conceits, they desperately fall into
a Sea of gross absurdities, blasphemy and impiety. And surely the Jesuits were
so far engaged in this Treason, as that some of them stick not to say, that if
it should miscarry, that they were utterly undone, and that it would overthrow
the State of the whole Society of the Jesuits: And I pray God that in this they
may prove true Prophets, that they may become like the Order of Templarii, so
called, for that they kept near the Sepulcher at Jerusalem, who were by a
general and universal Edict in one day throughout Christendom quite
extinguished, as being Ordo impietatis, an Order of impiety. And so, from all
Sedition and privy Conspiracy; from all false Doctrine and Heresy; from
hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and Commandment, Good Lord deliver
us. Their protestations and pretenses, are to win souls to God, their proofs
weak, light, and of no value; their conclusions false, damnable, and damned
heresies: The first mentions God, the second savoureth of weak and frail Man,
the last of the Devil, and their practice easily appears out of the dealing
of their holy Father.

Henry the Third of France, for killing a Cardinal, was Excommunicated, and
after murdered by James Clement a Monk: That Fact does Sixtus Quintus, then
Pope, instead of orderly censuring thereof, not only approve, but commend in a
long Consistory Oration: That a Monk, a Religious man, says he, has slain the
unhappy French King in the midst of his Host; It is rarum, insigne, memorabile
facinus; a rare, a notable, and a memorable Act; yea further, It is Facinus non
sine Dei Optimi Maximi particulari providentia and dispositione, etc. A Fact
done not without the special Providence and appointment of our good God, and
the suggestion and assistance of his holy Spirit; yea, a far greater work than
was the slaying of Holofernes by holy Judith.

Verus Monachus fictum occiderat, A true Monk had killed the false Monk, for
that, as was reported, Henry the Third sometimes would use that habit when he
went in Procession. And for France, even that part thereof which entertaineth
the Popish Religion, yet never could of ancient time brook this usurped
Authority of the Sea of Rome: Namely, that the Pope had power to Excommunicate
Kings, and Absolve Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance. Which Position is so
directly opposite to all the Canons of the Church of France, and to all the
Decrees of the King's Parliament there, as that the very Body of Sorbone, and
the whole University of Paris condemned it as a most schismatical, pestilent,
and pernicious Doctrine of the Jesuits, as may appear in a Treatise made to the
French King, and set out 1602. Entitled Le Franc Discourse. But to return to
the Jesuits, Catesby was resolved by the Jesuits, that the Fact was both lawful
and meritorious, and herewith he persuaded and settled the rest, as any seemed
to make doubt.

Concerning Thomas Bates, who was Catesby's man, as he was wound into this
Treason by his Master, so was he resolved, when he doubted of the lawfulness
thereof, by the Doctrine of the Jesuits. For the manner, it was after this
sort; Catesby noting that his man observed him extraordinarily, as suspecting
somewhat of that which he the said Catesby went about, called him to him at his
Lodging in Puddle-Wharf, and in the presence of Thomas Winter, asked him what
he thought the business was they went about, for that he of late had so
suspiciously and strangely marked them. Bates answered, that he thought they
went about some dangerous matter, whatsoever the particular were: whereupon
they asked him again, what he thought the business might be? and he answered,
that he thought they intended some dangerous matter about the Parliament House,
because he had been sent to get a Lodging near unto that place. Then did they
make the said Bates take an Oath to be secret in the Action, which being taken
by him, they then told him that it was true, that they were to execute a great
matter; namely, to lay Powder under the Parliament House to blow it up. Then
they also told him that he was to receive the Sacrament for the more assurance,
and thereupon he went to Confession to the said Tesmond the Jesuit; and in his
Confession told him, that he was to conceal a very dangerous piece of work,
that his Master Catesby and Thomas Winter had imparted unto him, and said he
much feared the matter to be utterly unlawful, and therefore therein desired
the counsel of the Jesuit, and revealed unto him the whole intent and purpose
of blowing up the Parliament House upon the first day of the Assembly, at what
time the King, the Queen, the Prince, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Judges, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, should all have been there
Convented, and met together. But the Jesuit being a Confederate therein before,
resolved and encouraged him in the Action, and said that he should be secret in
that which his Master had imparted unto him, for that it was for a good cause.
Adding moreover, that it was not dangerous unto him, nor any offense to conceal
it: And thereupon the Jesuit gave him Absolution, and Bates received the
Sacrament of him, in the company of his Master Robert Catesby, and Thomas
Winter. Also when Rookwood, in the presence of sundry of the Traitors, (having
first received the Oath of Secrecy) had, by Catesby, imparted unto him the
Plot of the blowing up of the King and State; the said Rookwood being greatly
amazed thereat, answered, That it was a matter of Conscience to take away so
much blood. But Catesby replied, That he was resolved, and that by good
Authority, (as coming from the Superior of the Jesuits) that in Conscience it
might be done, yea, though it were with the destruction of many Innocents,
rather than the Action should quail. Likewise Father Hammond absolved all the
Traitors at Robert Winters house, upon Thursday after the Discovery of the
Plot, they being then in open Rebellion: And therefore, Hos, O Rex, magne
caveto, and let all Kings take heed how they either favor, or give allowance
or connivance unto them.

2. The second Consideration respects the Persons against whom this Treason
was intended, which are, 1. The King, who is Gods Anointed; nay, it has
pleased God to communicate unto him his own name, Dixi Dii estis, not
Substantially or Essentially so; neither yet on the other side Usurpative, by
unjust Usurpation, as the Devil and the Pope; but Potestative, as having his
Power derived from God within his Territories. 2. Their Natural Liege Lord and
Dread Sovereign, whose just Interest and Title to his Crown may be drawn from
before the Conquest; and if he were not a King by Descent, yet deserved he to
be made one for his rare and excellent Endowments and Ornaments both of Body
and Mind. Look into his true and constant Religion and Piety, his Justice, his
Learning above all Kings Christened, his Acumen, his Judgment, his Memory; and
you will say that he is indeed, Solus praeteritis major, meliorque futuris. But
because I cannot speak what I would, I will forbear to speak what I could. Also
against the Queen, a most gracious and graceful Lady, a most virtuous,
fruitful, and blessed Vine, who has happily brought forth such Olive Branches,
as that in benedictione erit memoria ejus, her memory shall be blessed of all
our posterity. Then against the Royal Issue Male, next under God, and after our
Sovereign, the future hope, comfort, joy, and life of our State. And as for
preserving the good Lady Elizabeth, the Kings Daughter, it should only have
been for a time to have served their purposes, as being thought a fit project
to keep others in appetite for their own further advantage; and then, God
knows what would have become of her. To conclude, against all the most
Honorable and Prudent Counselors, and all the true hearted and worthy Nobles,
all the Reverend and Learned Bishops, all the grave Judges and Sages of the
Law, all the principal Knights, Gentry, Citizens, and Burgesses of Parliament,
the Flower of the whole Realm. Horret Animus, I tremble even to think of it.
Miserable desolation! no King, no Queen, no Prince, no Issue Male, no
Counselors of State, no Nobility, no Bishops, no Judges. O barbarous, and more
than Scythian or Thracian cruelty! No Mantle of Holiness can cover it, no
pretense of Religion can excuse it, no shadow of good intention can extenuate
it; God and Heaven condemn it, Man and Earth detest it, the Offenders
themselves were ashamed of it, wicked people exclaim against it, and the Souls
of all true Christian Subjects abhor it. Miserable, but yet sudden had their
ends been, who should have died in that fiery Tempest and storm of Gunpowder:
but more miserable had they been that had escaped. And what horrible effects
the blowing up of so much Powder and Stuff would have wrought, not only amonst
Men and Beasts, but even upon insensible Creatures, Churches and Houses, and
all places near adjoining, you who have been Martial men best know. For my
self, Vox faucibus haeret: so that the King may say with the Kingly Prophet
David, O Lord, the proud are risen against Psalm. 86. 14.
me, and the congregation, even Synagoga, the synagogue of naughty men have
sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes. And as it is,
Psalm. 140. 5. The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad, yea,
and set traps in my way. But let the ungodly fall into Psalm. 141. 11.
their own nets together, and let me ever escape them. We may say, If the Lord
himself had not Psalm. 124. 1.
been on our side, yea, if the Lord himself had not been on our side when men
rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick, when they were so
wrathfully displeased at us. But praised be the Lord, which has not given us
over for a prey unto their teeth. Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the
snare of the fowler; the snare is broken, and we are delivered. Our help
stands in the name of the Lord, which has made heaven and earth.

3. The third Consideration respects the time when this Treason was conspired:
wherein note, that it was primo Iacobi, even at that time when his Majesty used
so great lenity toward Recusants, in that by the space of a whole year and
four months, he took no Penalty by Statute of them. So far was his Majesty from
severity, that besides the benefit and grace before specified, he also honored
all alike with advancement and favors; and all this was continued until the
Priests Treason by Watson and Clark. But as there is Misericor dia puniens, so
is there likewise Crudelitas parcens; for they were not only by this not
reclaimed, but (as plainly appears) became far worse. Nay, the Romish
Catholics did at that very time certify, that it was very like, the King would
deal rigorously with them; and the same do these Traitors now pretend as the
chiefest motive: whereas indeed they had Treason on foot against the King
before they see his face in England. Neither afterward for all the lenity he
used toward them, would any whit desist or relent from their wicked attempts.
Nay (that which comes next to be remembered in this part of their Arraignment)
they would pick out the time of Parliament for the execution of their hideous
Treasons, wherein the flour of the land being assembled, for the honor of God,
the good of his Church, and this Commonwealth, they might, as it were, with one
blow, not wound, but kill and destroy the whole State. So that with these men,
Impunitas continuum affectum tribuit peccandi, Lenity having once bred a hope
of Impunity, begat not only Insolency, but Impenitency and increase of sin.

4. We are to consider the place, which was the Sacred Senate, the House of
Parliament. And why there? For that, say they, unjust Laws had formerly been
there made against Catholics; therefore that was the fittest place of all
others to revenge it, and to do Justice in. If any ask, who should have
executed this their Justice, it was Justice Fawkes, a man like enough to do
according to his name. If by what Law they meant to proceed? It was Gunpowder
Law, fit for Justices of Hell. But concerning those Laws which they so
calumniate as unjust, it shall in few words plainly appear, that they were of
the greatest, both moderation and equity that ever were any: For from the year
1 Eliz. unto 11. all Papists came to our Church and Service without scruple. I
my self have seen Cornewallis, Beddingfield, and others, at Church. So that
then, for the space of ten years, they made no conscience nor doubt to
Communicate with us in Prayer: But when once the Bull of Pope Pius Quintus was
come and published, wherein the Queen was accursed and deposed, and her
Subjects discharged of their Obedience and Oath, yea, cursed if they did obey
her; then did they all forthwith refrain the Church, then would they have no
more society with us in Prayer. So that Recusancy in them is not for Religion,
but in an acknowledgment of the Popes Power, and a plain manifestation what
their judgment is concerning the right of the Prince in respect of Regal Power
and Place. Two years after, viz. Anno 13 Eliz. was there a Law made against the
bringing in of Bulls, etc. Anno 18. came M^yne a Priest to move sedition. Anno
20. came Campion the first Jesuit, who was sent to make a Party here in
England, for the execution of the former Bull. Then follows Treasonable Books.
Anno 23 Eliz. after so many years sufferance, there were Laws made against
Recusants and seditious Books. The Penalty or Sanction for Recusancy was not
loss of Life, or Limb, or whole Estate; but only a pecuniary Mulct and
Penalty, and that also until they would submit and conform themselves, and
again come to Church, as they had done for ten years before the Bull. And yet
afterward the Jesuits and Romish Priests, both coming daily into, and swarming
within the Realm, and infusing continually this poison into the Subjects
hearts, that by reason of the said Bull of Pius Quintus, her Majesty stood
Excommunicated and deprived of her Kingdom, and that her Subjects were
discharged of all obedience to her, endeavoring by all means to draw them from
their Duty and Allegiance to her Majesty, and to reconcile them to the Church
of Rome. Then 27 Eliz. a Law was made, That it should be Treason for any (not
to be a Priest and an Englishman, born the Queens Natural Subject) but for any
being so born her Subject, and made a Romish Priest, to come into any of her
Dominions, to infect any her Loyal Subjects with their treasonable and
damnaable persuasions and practices: Yet so, that it concerned only such as
were made Priests sithence her Majesty came to the Crown, and not before.

Concerning the execution of these Laws, it is to be observed likewise, that
whereas in the Quinquenny, the five years of Queen Mary, there were cruelly put
to death about 300 persons for Religion; In all her Majesty's time, by the
space of 44 years and upwards, there were for treasonable practices executed in
all not 30 Priests, nor above five receivers and harborers of them; and for
Religion, not any one. And here by the way, I desire those of Parliament to
observe, that it is now questioned and doubted, Whether the Law of Recusants
and reconciled Persons do hold for Ireland also, and the parts beyond the Seas;
that is, Whether such as were there reconciled, be within the compass of the
Statute or not, to the end it may be cleared and provided for.

Now against the Usurped Power of the Sea of Rome, we have of former times
about thirteen several Acts of Parliament: So that the Crown and King of
England is no ways to be drawn under the Government of any Foreign Power
whatsoever; neither owes duty to any, but is immediately under God himself.
Concerning the Popes, for thirty three of them, namely, unto Silvester, they
were famous Martyrs; but, Quicunque desiderat primatum in terris, inveniet
confusionem in coelis: He that desires Primacy upon Earth, shall surely find
confusion in Heaven.

The fifth consideration is of the end, which was, to bring a final and fatal
confusion upon the State. For howsoever they sought to shadow their Impiety
with the Cloak of Religion, yet they intended to breed a confusion fit to get
new Alterations; for they went to join with Romish Catholics, and discontented
persons.

Now the sixth point, which is the means to compass and work these designs,
were damnable, by Mining, by six and thirty Barrels of Powder, having Crows of
Iron, Stones, and Wood, laid upon the Barrels, to have made the Breach the
greater. Lord, what a Wind, what a Fire, what a Motion and Commotion of Earth
and Air would there have been! But, as it is in the Book of Kings, when Elias
was in the Cave in Mount Horeb, and that he was called forth to stand before
the Lord, behold a mighty strong Wind rent the Mountains, and brake the Rocks,
sed non in vento Dominus, but the Lord was not in the Wind. And after the Wind
came a Commotion of the Earth and Air: Et non in Commotione Dominus, the Lord
was not in that Commotion. And after the Commotion came Fire, Et non in igne
Dominus, the Lord was not in the Fire. So neither was God in any part of this
monstrous Action. The Authors whereof were, in this respect, worse than the
very damned Spirit of Dives, who, as it is in the Gospel, desired that others
should not come in locum tormentorum.

7. The next consideration is the secret contriving and carriage of this
Treason, to which purpose there were four means used. First, Catesby was
commended to the Marquis for a Regiment of Horse in the Low Countries, (which
is the same that the Lord Arundel now has) that under that pretense he might
have furnished this Treason with Horses without suspicion. The second means was
an Oath, which they solemnly and severally took, as well for secrecy, as
perseverance and constancy in the execution of their Plot. The form of the Oath
was as follows,

YOu shall swear by the Blessed Trinity, and by the Sacrament you now purpose
to receive, never to disclose directly nor indirectly, by word or circumstance,
the matter that shall be proposed to you to keep secret, nor desist from the
execution thereof, until the rest shall give you leave.

This Oath was by Gerrard the Jesuit given to Catesby, Piercy, Christopher
Wright, and Thomas Winter at once, and by Greenwel the Jesuit to Bates at
another time, and so to the rest.

The third was the Sacrament, which they impiously and devillishly profaned to
this end. But the last was their perfidious and perjurious equivocating,
abetted, allowed, and justified by the Jesuits, not only simply to conceal or
deny an open truth, but Religiously to aver, to protest upon Savation, to swear
that which themselves know to be most false; and all this, by reserving a
secret and private sense inwardly to themselves, whereby they are by their
Ghostly Fathers persuaded, that they may safely and lawfully delude any
question whatsoever. And here was showed a Book written not long before the
Queens death, at what time Thomas Winter was employed into Spain, entitled, A
Treatise of Equivocation; which Book being seen and allowed by Garnet, the
Superior of the Jesuits, and Blackwel the Archpriest of England, in the
beginning thereof, Garnet, with his own hand, put out those words in the Title
of Equivocation, and made it thus, A Treatise against Lying, and Fraudulent
Dissimulation; whereas indeed and truth it makes for both, Speciosaque nomina
Culpae Imponis Garnette tuae. And in the end thereof, Blackwel besprinkles it
with his Blessing, saying, Tractatus iste, valde doctus and vere pius, and
Catholicus est. Certe S. Scripturarum, Patrum, Doctorum, Scholasticorum,
Canonistarum and optimarum Rationum praesidiis plenissime firmat aequitatem
aequivocationis. Ideoque dignissimus est qui Typis propagetur, ad consolationem
afflictorum Catholicorum, and omnium piorum instructionem. That is, This
Treatise is very Learned, Godly, and Catholic, and does most fully confirm the
Equity of Equivocation, by strong proofs out of holy Scriptures, Fathers,
Doctors, Schoolmen, Canonists, and soundest reasons; and therefore worthy to
be published in Print, for the comfort of afflicted Catholics, and instruction
of all the godly.

Now in this Book there is, Propositio mentalis, verbalis, scripta, and mixta,
distinguishing of a mental, a verbal, a written, and a mixed Proposition, a very
labyrinth to lead men into error and falsehood. For example, to give you a
little taste of this Art of cozening.

A man is asked upon Oath this question, Did you see such an one to day? he
may, by this Doctrine, answer No, though he did see him, viz. reserving this
secret meaning, not with purpose to tell my Lord Chief Justice. Or, I see him
not, Visione beatifica, or, not in Venice, etc. Likewise, to answer thus, I was
in the company, reserving and intending secretly, as added, this word Not: As
Strange the Jesuit did to my Lord Chief Justice and my self: Take one or two of
these out of that very Book, as for purpose. A man comes unto Coventry in time
of a suspicion of Plague, and at the Gates the Officers meet him, and upon his
Oath examine him, whether he came from London or no, where they think certainly
the Plague to be: This man knowing for certain the Plague not to be at London,
or at least knowing that the Air is not there infectious, and that he only rid
through some secret place of London, not staying there, may safely swear he
came not from London, answering to their final intention in their demand, that
is, whether he came so from London, that he may endanger their City of the
Plague, although their immediate intention were to know whether he came from
London or no. That man (says the Book) the very light of nature would clear
from Perjury. In like manner, one being Convented in the Bishop's Court,
because he refuses to take such a one to his Wife, as he had Contracted with
per verba de praesenti, having Contracted with another privily before, so that
he cannot be Husband to her that claims him, may answer, that he never
Contracted with her per verba de praesenti, understanding that he did not so
Contract that it was a Marriage, for that is the final intention of the Judge,
to know whether there were a sufficient Marriage between them or no Never did
Father Cranmer, Father Latimer, Father Ridley, those blessed Martyrs know these
shifts, neither would they have used them to have saved their lives. And surely
let every good man take heed of such Jurors or Witnesses, there being no Faith,
no bond of Religion or Civility, no Conscience of Truth in such men, and
therefore the conclusion shall be that of the Prophet David: Domine, libera
Animam meam a labiis iniquis and a lingua dolosa; Deliver me, O Lord, from
lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.

S. P. Q. R. Was sometimes taken for these words, Senatus Populusque Romanus,
the Senate and People of Rome, but now they may truly be expressed thus,
Stultus Populus quaerit Romam: A foolish people that runs to Rome. And here
was very aptly and delightfully inserted and related the Apologue or Tale of
the Cat and the Mice. The Cat having a long time preyed upon the Mice, the poor
creatures at last, for their safety, contained themselves within their holes;
but the Cat finding his prey to cease, as being known to the Mice, that he was
indeed their enemy, and a Cat, devises this course following, viz. changes
his hue, gets on a Religious habit, shaveth his crown, walks gravely by
their holes: And yet perceiving that the Mice kept their holes, and looking
out, suspected the worst, he formally, and Father-like said unto them, Quod
fueram non sum, frater, caput aspice tonsum: Oh Brother, I am not as you take
me for, no more a Cat, see my habit, and shaven crown. Hereupon some of the
more credulous and bold among them, were again by this deceit snatched up; and
therefore when afterward he came as before to entice them forth, they would
come out no more, but answered, Cor tibi restat idem, vix tibi proesto fidem,
Talk what you can, we will never believe you, you have still a Cats heart
within you: you do not watch and pray, but you watch to prey. And so have the
Jesuits, yea, and Priests too; for they are all joined in the tails like
Sampson's Foxes, Ephraim against Manasses, and Manasses against Ephraim, but
both against Judah.

8. The last Consideration is, concerning the admirable discovery of this
Treason, which was by one of themselves, who had taken the Oath and Sacrament,
as has been said, against his own will: The means was, by a dark and doubtful
Letter sent to my Lord Mountegle. And thus much as touching the Considerations;
the Observations follow, to be considered in this Powder Treason, and are
briefly thus.

1. If the Cellar had not been hired, the Mine-work could hardly or not at all
have been discovered; for the Mine was neither found, nor suspected, until the
danger was past, and the Capital Offenders apprehended, and by themselves, upon
Examination, confessed.

2. How the King was Divinely illuminated by Almighty God, the only Ruler of
Princes, like an Angel of God, to direct and point as it were to the very
place, to cause a search to be made there, out of those dark words of the
Letter concerning a terrible Blow.

3. Observe a miraculous accident which befell in Stephen Littleton's house,
called Holbach in Staffordshire, after they had been two days in open
Rebellion, immediately before the apprehension of these Traitors: For some of
them standing by the fireside, and having set 2l. and di. of Powder to dry in
a Platter before the fire, and under-set the said Platter with a great linen
bag, full of other Powder, containing some fifteen or sixteen pounds; it so
fell out, that one coming to put more wood into the fire, and casting it on,
there flew a coal into the Platter, by reason whereof, the Powder taking fire
and blowing up, scorched those who were nearest, as Catesby, Grant, and
Rookewood, blew up the roof of the house, and the linen bag which was set
under the Platter being therewith suddenly carried out through the Breach, fell
down in the Courtyard whole and unfired; which if it had took fire in the
room, would have slain them all there, so that they never should have come to
this Trial. And, Lex justior ulla est, Quam necis artifices art perire sua?

4. Note, That Gunpowder was the invention of a Friar, one of that Romish
Rabble; as Printing was of a Soldier.

5. Observe the sending of Rainham, one of the damned Crew, to the High Priest
of Rome, to give signification of this blow, and to crave his direction and aid.

6. That for all their stirring and rising in open Rebellion, and
notwithstanding the false Rumors given out by them, that the throats of all
Catholics should be cut; such is his Majesty's blessed Government, and the
Loyalty of his Subjects, as they got not any one man to take their parts
besides their own company.

7. Observe, the Sheriff, the ordinary Minister of Justice, according to the
duty of his Office, with such power as he on a sudden by Law collected,
suppressed them.

8. That God suffered their intended mischief to come so near the period, as
not to be discovered but within few hours before it should have been executed.

9. That it was in the entering of the Sun into the Tropic of Capricorn, when
they began their Mine; noting, that by Mineing they should descend, and by
Hanging ascend.

10. That there never was any Protestant Minister in any Treason and Murder, as
yet attempted within this Realm.

I am now come to the last part, which I proposed Comparisons.
in the beginning of this discourse, and that is, touching certain Comparisons
of this Powder Treason of the Jesuits, with that of Raleigh, and the other of
the Priests, Watson and Clark. 1. They had all one end, and that was the Romish
Catholic cause. 2. The same means, by Popish and discontented persons, Priests
and Laymen. 3. They all played at hazard; the Priests were at the By, Raleigh
at the Main, but these in at all, as purposing to destroy all the Kings Royal
Issue, and withal the whole Estate. 4. They were all alike obliged by the same
Oath and Sacrament. 5. The same Proclamations were intended (after the fact) to
be published for reformation of abuses. 6. The like Army provided for invading,
to land at Milford-haven, or in Kent. 7. The same Pensions of Crowns promised.
8. The agreeing of the times of the Treason of Raleigh and these men, which
was, when the Constable of Spain was coming hither, and Raleigh said, there
could be no suspicion of any Invasion, seeing that the Constable of Spain was
then expected for a Treaty of Peace; and the Navy might be brought to the
Groine under pretense of the Service in the Low Countries. And Raleigh further
said, That many more were hanged for words than for deeds. And before Raleigh's
Treason was discovered, it was reported in Spain, That Don Raleigh and Don
Cobham should cut the King of England's throat. I say not that we have any
proofs, that these of the Powder Plot were acquainted with Raleigh, or Raleigh
with them: but as before was spoken of the Jesuits and Priests, so they all
were joined in the ends, like Samson's Foxes in the tails, howsoever severed in
their heads.

The Conclusion shall be, from the admirable Conclusion
clemency and moderation of the King, in that howsoever these Traitors have
exceeded all others their Predecessors in mischief, and so Crescente malitia,
crescere debuit and Poena; yet neither will the King exceed the usual
punishment of Law, nor invent any new torture or torment for them, but is
graciously pleased to afford them as well an ordinary course of Trial, as an
ordinary punishment, much inferior to their offense. And surely worthy of
observation is the punishment by Law provided and appointed for High Treason,
which we call Crimen laesae Majestatis. For first, after a Traitor has had his
just Trial, and is convicted and attainted, he shall have his judgment to be
drawn to the place of Execution from his Prison, as being not worthy any more
to tread upon the face of the earth, whereof he was made. Also for that he has
been retrograde to Nature, therefore is he drawn backwards at a Horse-tail. And
whereas God has made the head of man the highest and most supreme part, as
being his chief grace and ornament: Pronaque cum spectent Animalia caetera
terram, Os homini sublime dedit; he must be drawn with his head declining
downward, and lying so near the ground as may be, being thought unfit to take
benefit of the common Air: For which cause also he shall be Strangled, being
hanged up by the neck between Heaven and Earth, as deemed unworthy of both, or
either; as likewise, that the eyes of men may behold, and their hearts contemn
him. Then is he to be cut down alive, and to have his Privy parts cut off, and
burnt before his face, as being unworthily begotten, and unfit to leave any
generation after him. His bowels and inlayed parts taken out and burnt, who
inwardly had conceived and harbored in his heart such horrible Treason. After,
to have his head cut off, which had imagined the mischief. And lastly, his body
to be quartered, and the quarters set up in some high and eminent place, to the
view and detestation of men, and to become a prey for the Fouls of the Air. And
this is a reward due to Traitors, whose hearts be hardened: for that it is
Physic of State and Government, to let out corrupt blood from the heart. But,
Poenitentia vera nunquam sera, sed paenitentia sera raro vera. True repentance
is indeed never too late, but late repentance is seldom found true; which yet I
pray the merciful Lord to grant unto them, that having a sense of their
offenses, they may make a true and sincere Confession, both for their Souls
health, and for the good and safety of the King and this State. And for the
rest that are not yet apprehended, my prayer to God is, Ut aut convertantur ne
pereant, aut confundantur ne noceant; that either they may be converted, to the
end they perish not, or else confounded that they hurt not.

After this, by the direction of Master Attorney General, were their several
Examinations (subscribed by themselves) showed particularly unto them, and
acknowledged by them to be their own, and true, wherein every one had confessed
the Treason. Then did Master Attorney desire, that albeit that which had been
already done and confessed at the Bar, might be all-sufficient for the
Declaration and Justification of the course of Justice then held, especially
seeing we have Reos confitentes, the Traitors own voluntary Confessions at the
Bar; yet for further satisfaction to so great a Presence and Audience, and
their better memory of the carriage of these Treasons, the voluntary and free
Confessions of all the said several Traitors in writing, subscribed with their
own proper hands, and acknowledged at the Bar by themselves to be true, were
openly and distinctly read. By which, amongst other things, it appeared, that
Bates was resolved for what he undertook concerning the Powder Treason, and
being therein warranted by the Jesuits. Also it appeared, that Hammond the
Jesuit, after that he knew the Powder Treason was discovered, and that these
Traitors had been in actual Rebellion, Confessed them and gave them Absolution;
and this was on Thursday the 7th. of November. Here also was mention made by
Master Attorney, of the Confessions of Watson and Clark, Seminary Priests, upon
their apprehension, who affirmed, That there was some Treason intended by the
Jesuits, and then in hand, as might appear; First, by their continual
negotiating at that time with Spain, which they assured themselves tended to
nothing, but a preparation for a Foreign commotion.

2. By their collecting and gathering together such great sums of money, as
then they had done, therewith to levy an Army when time should serve.

3. For that sundry of the Jesuits had been tampering with Catholics, as well
to dissuade them from acceptance of the King at his first coming, saying, That
they ought rather to die, than to admit of any Heretic (as they continually
termed his Majesty) to the Crown: And that they might not, under pain of
Excommunication, accept of any but a Catholic for their Sovereign; as al^ to
dissuade Catholics from their Loyalty, after the State was settled.

Lastly, in that they had both bought up store of great Horses throughout the
Country, and conveyed Powder, and Shot, and Artillery secretly to their
Friends, wishing them not to stir, but keep themselves quiet until they heard
from them.

After the reading of their several Examinations, Confessions, and voluntary
Declarations, as well of themselves, as of some of their dead Confederates,
they were all, by the Verdict of the Jury, found guilty of the Treasons
contained in their Indictment; and then being severally asked what they could
say, wherefore Judgment of Death should not be pronounced against them, there
was not one of these (except Rookwood) who would make any continued Speech,
either in defense or extenuation of the fact. Thomas Winter only desired, that
he might be Hanged both for his Brother and himself. Guy Fawkes being asked why
he pleaded Not Guilty, having nothing to say for his excuse, answered, That he
had so done in respect of certain conferences mentioned in the Indictment,
which, he said, that he knew not of; which were answered to have been set down
according to course of Law, as necessarily presupposed before the resolution of
such a design. Keys said, That his Estate and Fortunes were desperate, and as
good now as another time, and for this cause rather than for another. Bates
craved mercy. Robert Winter mercy. John Grant was a good while mute, yet after
submissly said, He was guilty of a Conspiracy intended, but never effected. But
Ambrose Rookwood first excused his denial of the Indictment, for that he had
rather lose his life than give it. Then did he acknowledge his offense to be so
heinous, that he justly deserved the indignation of the King, and of the Lords,
and the hatred of the whole Commonwealth; yet could he not despair of Mercy at
the hands of a Prince, so abounding in Grace and Mercy: And the rather, because
his Offense, though it were incapable of any excuse, yet not altogether
incapable of some extenuation, in that he had been neither Author nor Actor,
but only persuaded and drawn in by Catesby, whom he loved above any worldly
man: And that he had concealed it, not for any malice to the Person of the
King, or to the State, or for any ambitious respect of his own, but only drawn
with the tender respect, and the faithful and dear affection he bare to Mr.
Catesby his Friend, whom he esteemed more dear than any thing else in the
world. And this mercy he desired not for any fear of the image of Death, but
for grief that so shameful a Death should leave so perpetual a blemish and blot
unto all Ages upon his Name and Blood. But howsoever that this was his first
Offense, yet he humbly submitted himself to the Mercy of the King, and prayed,
that the King would herein imitate God, who sometimes does punish corporaliter,
non mortaliter; corporally, yet not mortally.

Then was related, how that on Friday immediately before this Arraignment,
Robert Winter having found opportunity to have conference with Fawkes in the
Tower, in regard of the nearness of their Lodgings, should say to Fawkes, as
Robert Winter and Fawkes confessed, That he and Catesby had Sons, and that Boys
would be men, and that he hoped they would revenge the cause: nay, that God
would raise up Children to Abraham out of stones. Also that they were sorry,
that no body did set forth a Defense or Apology of their Action; but yet they
would maintain the cause at their deaths.

Here also was reported Robert Winters Dream, which he had before the blasting
with Powder in Littletons house, and which he himself confessed, and first
notified, viz. That he thought he saw Steeples stand awry, and within those
Churches strange and unknown faces. And after, when the foresaid blast had, the
day following, scorched diverse of the Confederates, and much disfigured the
faces and countenances of Grant, Rookwood, and others: Then did Winter call to
mind his Dream, and to his remembrance thought, that the faces of his
Associates so scorched, resembled those which he had seen in his Dream. And
thus much concerning the former Indictment.

Then was Sir Everard Digby Arraigned, and after his Indictment was read,
wherein he was Sir Everard Digby Indicted Look the Indictment.
charged, not only to have been acquainted with the Powder Treason, and
concealed it, and taken the double Oath of Secrecy and Constancy therein, but
likewise to have been an Actor in this Conspiracy. And lastly, to have exposed,
and openly showed himself in the Rebellion in the Country, amongst the rest of
the Traitors. All which, after he had attentively heard and marked, knowing
that he had freely confessed it, and the strength and evidence of the proofs
against him, and convicted with the testimony of his own Conscience, showed his
disposition to confess the principal part of the said Indictment, and so began
to enter into a Discourse. But being advertised, that he must first plead to
the Indictment directly, either Guilty, or Not Guilty, and that afterward he
should be licensed to speak his pleasure, he forthwith confessed the Treason
contained in the Indictment, and so fell into a Speech, whereof there were two
parts, viz. Motives and Petitions. The first Motive Sir Everard Digby's Speech.
which drew him into this action, was not ambition, nor coffeehouse of his
estate, neither malice to any in Parliament, but the friendship and love he
bare to Catesby, which prevailed so much, and was so powerful with him, as that
for his sake he was ever contented and ready to hazard himself and his Estate.
The next Motive was, the cause of Religion, which alone, seeing (as he said) it
lay at the stake, he entered into resolution to neglect in that behalf, his
Estate, his Life, his Name, his Memory, his Posterity, and all worldly and
earthly felicity whatsoever, though he did utterly extirpate and extinguish all
other hopes, for the restoring of the Catholic Religion in England. His third
Motive was, That promises were broken with the Catholics. And lastly, That
they generally feared harder Laws from this Parliament against Recusants, as,
That Recusants Wives, and Women, should be liable to the Mulct as well as their
Husbands, and Men. And further, that it was supposed, that it should be made a
Praemunire only to be a Catholic.

His Petitions were, That since his offense was confined and contained within
himself, that the punishment also of the same might extend only to himself,
and not be transferred either to his Wife, Children, Sisters, or others: and
therefore for his Wife he humbly craved, that she might enjoy her Jointure, his
Son the benefit of an Entail made long before any thought of this action; his
Sisters, their just and due Portions which were in his hands; his Creditors,
their rightful Debts; which that he might more justly set down under his hand,
he requested, that before his death, his Man (who was better acquainted both
with the men, and the particulars, than himself) might be licensed to come unto
him. Then prayed he pardon of the King and Ll. for his guilt. And lastly, he
entreated to be beheaded, desiring all men to forgive him, and that his death
might satisfy them for his trespass.

To this Speech forthwith answered Sir Edw. Coke, Attorney General, but in
respect of the Mr. Attorney.
time (for it grew now dark) very briefly. 1. For his friendship with Catesby,
that it was mere folly, and wicked Conspiracy. 2. His Religion, Error, and
Heresy. 3. His promises, idle and vain presumptions: As also his fears, false
alarms. Concerning Wives that were Recusants, if they were known so to be
before their Husbands (though they were good Protestants) took them, and yet
for outward and worldly respects whatsoever, any would match with such, great
reason there is, that he or they should pay for it, as knowing the penalty and
burden before; for, Volenti and scienti non fit Injuria, No man receives
injury in that, to which he willingly and knowingly agrees and consents. But
if she were no Recusant at the time of Marriage, and yet afterward he suffer
her to be corrupted and seduced, by admitting Priests and Romanists into his
house, good reason likewise that he, be he Papist or Protestant, should pay for
his negligence and misgovernment.

4. Concerning the Petitions for Wife, for Children, for Sisters, etc. O how he
does now put on the bowels of Nature and Compassion in the peril of his private
and domestical estate! But before, when the public state of his Country, when
the King, the Queen, the tender Princes, the Nobles, the whole Kingdom, were
designed to a perpetual destruction, Where was then this piety, this Religious
affection, this care? All Nature, all Humanity, all respect of Laws both Divine
and Humane, were quite abandoned; then was there no conscience made to
extirpate the whole Nation, and all for a pretended zeal to the Catholic
Religion, and the justification of so detestable and damnable a Fact.

Here did Sir Everard Digby interrupt Mr. Attorney, and said, that he did not
justify the fact, but confessed, that he deserved the vilest death, and most
severe punishment that might be; but he was an humble Petitioner for mercy, and
some moderation of Justice. Whereupon Mr. Attorney replied, that he should not
look by the King to be honored in the manner of his death, having so far
abandoned all Religion and Humanity in his Action; but that he was rather to
admire the great moderation and mercy of the King, in that, for so exorbitant a
crime, no new torture answerable thereunto was devised to be inflicted upon
him. And for his Wife and Children, whereas he said, that for the Catholic
Cause he was content to neglect the ruin of himself, his Wife, his Estate, and
all; he should have his desire as it is in the Psalm, Let his Wife be a widow,
and his Children vagabonds; let his posterity be destroyed, and in the next
generation let his name be quite put out. For the paying of your Creditors, it
is equal and just, but yet fit the King be first satisfied and paid, to whom
you owe so much, as that all you have is too little: yet these things must be
left to the pleasure of his Majesty, and the course of Justice and Law.

My Lord of Northamptons Speech, as it was taken at the Arraignment of Sir
Everard Digby, by T. S.
YOu must not hold it strange, Sir Everard Digby, though at this time, being
pressed in Duty, Conscience and Truth, I do not suffer you to wander in the
Laberinth of your own idle conceits without opposition, to seduce others, as
your Self have been seduced, by false Principles; or to convey your self by
charms of imputation, by clouds of error, and by shifts of lately devised
Equivocation, out of that straight wherein your late secure and happy fortune
has been unluckily entangled; but yet justly surprised, by the rage and
revenge of your own rash humors. If in this crime (more horrible than any man
is able to express) I could lament the estate of any person upon earth, I could
pity you, but thank your Self and your bad Counselors, for leading you into a
Crime of such a kind; as no less benummeth in all faithful, true and honest
men, the tenderness of affection, than it did in you, the sense of all humanity.

That you were once well thought of, and esteemed by the late Queen, I can
witness, having heard her speak of you with that grace which might have
encouraged a true Gentleman to have run a better course: Nay I will add
further, that there was a time, wherein you were as well affected to the King
our Masters expectation, though perhaps upon false rumors and reports, that he
would have yielded satisfaction to your unprobable and vast desires: but the
seed that wanted moisture (as our Savior himself reports) took no deep root:
that zeal which has no other end or object than the pleasing of it Self, is
quickly spent: and Trajan that worthy and wise Emperor, had reason to hold
himself discharged of all debts to those, that had offended more by
prevarication, than they could deserve by industry.

The grace and goodness of his Majesty in giving honor at his first coming
unto many men of your own affection, and (as I think) unto your self; his
facility in admitting all without distinction of Trojan or of Tyrian, to his
Royal presence, upon just occasions of access, his integrity in setting open
the gate of civil Justice unto all his Subjects equally and indifferently, with
many other favors that succeeded by the progression of Peace, are so palpable
and evident to all men, that have either eyes of understanding, or
understanding of capacity, as your Self and many others, have been driven of
late to excuse and countenance your execrable ingratitude, with a false and
scandalous report of some further hope and comfort yielded to the Catholics
for Toleration or connivency, before his coming to the Crown, than since has
been performed, made good or satisfied.

I am not ignorant, that this seditious and false alarm has awaked and incited
many working spirits to the prejudice of the present State, that might
otherwise have slept as before with silence and sufferance: it has served for
a shield of wax against a sword of power: it has been used as an Instrument of
Art to shadow false approches, till the Trojan horse might be brought within
the walls of the Parliament, with a belly stuffed, not as in old time with
armed Greeks, but with hellish Gunpowder. But howsoever God had blinded you and
other in this Action, as he did the King of Egypt and his Instruments, for the
brighter evidence of his own powerful glory; yet every man of understanding
could discern, that a Prince whose Judgment had been fixed by experience of so
many years, upon the Poles of the North and the South, could not shrink upon
the sudden: no nor since with fear of that combustion which Catesby that
Archtraitor, like a second Phaeton, would have caused in an instant in all the
Elements. His Majesty did never value fortunes of the world, in lesser matter
than Religion, with the freedom of his thoughts: he thought it no safe policy,
(professing as he did and ever will) to call up more spirits into the circle
than he could put down again: he knew, that omne Regnum in se divisum
desolabitur. Philosophy does teach, that whatsoever any man may think in secret
thought, that where one does hold of Cephas, another of Apollo, openly
dissension ensues, Quod insitum alieno solo est, in id quo alitu^, natura
vertente, degenerat: and the world will ever apprehend, that Quorum est commune
symbolum, facilimus est transitus.

Touching the point it self of promising a kind of Toleration to Catholics, as
it was divulged by these two limbs of Lucifer, Watson and Percy, to raise a
ground of practice and conspiracy against the State and Person of our Dear
Sovereign: let the Kingdom of Scotland witness for the space of so many years
before his coming hither, whether either flattery or fear, (no not upon that
enterprise of the 17th of November, which would have put the patience of any
Prince in Europe to his proof) could draw from the King the least inclination
to this dispensative indifference, that was only believed because it was
eagerly desired.

Every man does know how great art was used, what strong wits sublimed, and how
many Ministers suborned and corrupted many years, both in Scotland and in
Foreign parts, to set the Kings teeth an edge, with fair promises of future
helps and supplies, to that happy end of attaining his due right in England,
when the Sun should set to rise more gloriously in the same Hemisphere, to the
wonder both of this Island and of the world. But all in vain: for jacta erat
alea, the Kings compass had been set before, and by a more certain rule: and
they were commonly cast off as forlorn hopes in the Kings favor, that ran a
course of ranking themselves in the foremost front of foreign correspondency.

Upon notice given to his Majesty from hence, some years before the death of
the late Queen, that many men were grown suspicious of his Religion, by rumors
spread abroad, that some of those in foreign part^, that seemed to be well
affected to his future expectation, had used his name more audaciously, and
spoken of his favor to the Catholics, more forwardly than the Kings own
Conscience, and unchangeable Decree could acknowledge, or admit, (either with a
purpose to prepare the minds of Foreign Princes, or for a practice to estrange
and alienate affections at home) not only utterly renounced, and condemned
these encrochments of blind zeal, and rash proceedings, by the voices of his
own Ministers, but was careful also for a caution to succeeding hopes, so far
as lay in him, that by the disgrace of the Delinquents in this kind, the minds
of all English Subjects chiefly might be secured, and the world satisfied.

No man can speak in this case more confidently than my self, that received in
the Queens time for the space of many years, directions and warnings to take
heed, that neither any further comfort might be given to Catholics concerning
future favors, than he did intend, which was, to bind all Subjects in one
Kingdom to one Law, concerning the Religion established, howsoever in Civil
Matters he might extend his favor as he found just cause: nor any seeds of
jealousy and diffidence sown in the minds of Protestants by Semeis and
Achitophels, to make them doubtful of his constancy, to whom he would confirm
with his dearest blood that faith which he had sucked from the breast of his
Nurse, apprehended from the Cradle of his Infancy, and maintained with his
uttermost endeavor, affection and strength, since he was more able out of
reading and disputing to give a reason of those Principles which he had now
digested, and turned to Nutriment.

He that wrote the Book of Titles before the late Queens death, declares
abundantly, by seeking to possess some Foreign Prince of the Kings Hereditary
Crowns, when the cause should come to the proof, and may witness in stead of
many, what hope there was of the Kings favor or affection to Catholics in the
case of Toleration or Dispensation with exercise of Conscience. For every man
may ghess that it was no slight or ordinary degree of despair, that made him
and other of his Suit renounce their portion in the Son and Heir of that
renowned and rare Lady, Mary Queen of Scotland, a Member of the Roman Church,
as some did in David, Nulla nobis pars in David, nec haereditas in filio Isai.
For hereof, by Letters intercepted in their passage into Scotland, the Records
and Proofs are evident. His Majesty, so long as he was in expectation of that
which by the work and grace of God he does now possess, did ever seek to settle
his establishment upon the Faith of Protestants in generality, as the most
assured Shoot-Anchor. For though he found a number on the other side, as
faithful and as well affected to his Person, Claim, and Interest, as any men
alive, as well in respect of their dependency upon the Queen his Mother, as for
the taste which they had of the sweetness of himself; yet finding with what
strength of blood many have been over-carried out of a fervency in zeal in
former times, observing to what censures they were subject, both in points of
Faith, and limitation of Loyalty; And last of all, forecasting to what end
their former Protestation would come, when present satisfaction should shrink,
he was ever fearful to embark himself for any further voyage and adventure in
this Straight, than his own Compass might stear him, and his Judgment level him.

If any one green leaf for Catholics could have been visibly discerned by the
eye of Catesby, Winter, Garnet, Faux, etc. they would neither have entered into
practice with Foreign Princes during the Queens time, for prevention of the
Kings Lawful and Hereditary Right, nor have renewed the same both abroad and at
home, by Missions and Combinations, after his Majesty was both applauded and
entered.

It is true, that by Confessions we find that false Priest Watson, and
Arch-Traitor Percy, to have been the first devisers and divulgers of this
scandalous report, as an accursed ground, whereon they might with some
advantage, as it was conceived, build the Castles of their Conspiracy.

Touching the first, no man can speak more soundly to the point than my self;
for being sent into the Prison by the King to charge him with this false Alarm,
only two days before his death, and upon his Soul to press him in the presence
of God, and as he would answer it at another Bar, to confess directly, whether
at either of both these times he had access unto his Majesty at Edinburgh, his
Majesty did give him any promise, hope or comfort of encouragement to
Catholics concerning Toleration; he did there protest upon his Soul, that he
could never win one inch of ground, or draw the smallest comfort from the King
in those degrees, nor further than that he would have them apprehend, that as
he was a Stranger to this State, so till he understood in all points how those
matters stood, he would not promise favor any way, but did protest, that all
the Crowns and Kingdoms in this world should not induce him to change any Jot
of his Profession, which was the Pasture of his Soul, and earnest of his
eternal Inheritance. He did confess, that in very deed, to keep up the hearts
of Catholics in love and duty to their King, he had imparted the Kings words
to many in a better tune, and a higher kind of descant, than his Book of
Plainsong did direct; because he knew that others, like sly Barge-men, looked
that way, when their stroke was bent another way. For this he craved pardon of
the King in humble manner, and for his main Treasons of a higher nature than
these Figures of Hypocrisy; and seemed penitent, as well for the horror of
his crime, as for the falsehood of his whisperings.

It hindered not the satisfaction which may be given to Percy' s shadow (the
most desperate Boutefeu in the pack) that as he died impenitent, for any thing
we know, so likewise he died silent in the particulars: For first, it is not
strange, that such a Traitor should devise so scandalous a slander out of the
malice of his heart, intending to destroy the King by any means, and to advance
all means that might remove obstructions and impediments to the plot of
Gunpowder. The more odious that he could make him to the Party Malcontent,
and the more sharply that he could set the Party Malcontent upon the point
and humor of revenge, the stronger was his hope at the giving of the last
blow, to be glorified and justified. But touching the truth of the matters, it
will be witnessed by many, that this Traitor Percy, after both the first and
second return from the King, brought to the Catholics no spark of comfort, of
encouragement, of hope; whereof no stronger proof of argument does need, than
that Fawkes and others were employed both into Spain and other parts, for the
reviving of a practice suspended and covered, after Percy' s coming back, as in
likelihood they should not have been, in case he had returned with a branch of
Olive in his mouth, or yielded any ground of comfort to resolve upon.

Therefore I thought it thus far needful to proceed for the clearing of those
scandals that were cast abroad by these forlorn Hopes and graceless
Instruments. It only remains, that I pray for your repentance in this world
for the satisfaction of many, and forgiveness in the next world for the saving
of your self; having had by the Kings favor so long a time to cast up your
Account, before your appearance at the seat of the great Auditor.

H. Northampton.

THen spoke the Earl of Salisbury, especially The Eearl of Salisbury.
to that point of his Majesty's breaking of promise with Recusants, which was
used and urged by Sir Everard Digby, as a motive to draw him to participate in
this so hideous a Treason: Wherein his Lordship, after acknowledgment, that Sir
Everard Digby was his Ally; And having made a zealous and Religious
protestation, concerning the sincerity and truth of that which he would
deliver; shortly and clearly defended the honor of the King herein, and freed
his Majesty from all imputation and scandal of Irresolution in Religion, and in
the constant and perpetual maintaining thereof; as also from having at any time
given the least hope, much less promise of Toleration. To which purpose he
declared, how his Majesty, as well before his coming to this Crown, as at that
very time, and always since, was so far from making of promise, or giving hope
of Toleration, that he ever professed he should not endure the very motion
thereof from any.

And here his Lordship showed what was done at Hampton Court at the time of
Watson' s Treason, where some of the greater Recusants were convented; and
being found then not to have their fingers in Treason, were sent away again
with encouragement to persist in their dutiful carriage, and with promise only
of thus much favor, That those mean profits which had occurred since the Kings
time to his Majesty for their Recusancy, should be forgiven to the principal
Gentlemen, who had both at his Entry showed so much Loyalty, and had kept
themselves so free since from all Conspiracies.

Then did his Lordship also (the rather to show how little truth Sir Everard
Digby' s words did carry in any thing which he had spoken) plainly prove, That
all his protestations, wherein he denied so constantly to be privy to the Plot
of Powder, were utterly false, by the testimony of Fawkes (there present at the
Bar) who had confessed, That certain months before that Session, the said
Fawkes being with Digby at his house in the Country, about what time there had
fallen much wet; Digby taking Fawkes aside after Supper, told him, That he was
much afraid that the Powder in the Cellar was grown dank, and that some new
must be provided, lest that should not take fire.

Next, the said Earl did justly and greatly commend the Lord Mounteagle, for
his Loyal and honorable care of his Prince and Country, in the speedy
bringing forth of the Letter sent unto him, wherein he said, That he had showed
both his discretion and fidelity. Which Speech being ended, Digby then
acknowledged, That he spoke not that of the breach of promise out of his own
knowledge, but from their Relation whom he trusted, and namely from Sir Tho.
Tresham.

NOw were the Jury returned, who having returned their Verdict, whereby they
jointly found those seven Prisoners, Arraigned upon the former Indictment,
Guilty, Sergeant Philips craved Judgment against those Seven upon their
Conviction; and against Sir Everard Digby upon his own Conf^sion.

Then the Lord Chief Justice of England, after a grave and prudent Relation and
Defense of the Laws made by Queen Elizabeth against Recusants, Priests, and
Receivers of Priests, together with the several occasions, progresses, and
reasons of the same; and having plainly demonstrated and proved, that they were
all necessary, mild, equal, moderate, and to be justified to all the world,
pronounced Judgment.

Upon the rising of the Court, Sir Everard Digby bowing himself toward the
Lords, said, If I may but hear any of your Lordships say, you forgive me, I
shall go more cheerfully to the Gallows. Whereunto the Lords said, God forgive
you, and we do.

And so according to the Sentence, on Thursday following, execution was done
upon Sir Everard Digby, Robert Winter, John Grant, and Thomas Bates, at the
West end of Paul's Church; and on the Friday following, upon Thomas Winter,
Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keys, and G^y Fawkes, within the old Palace-yard at
Westminst. not far from the Parliament House.

THE ARRAIGNMENT OF HENRY GARNET, Superior of the Jesuits in England, on
Friday the 28th day of March, 1606. at Guild Hall in the City of London, before
the Lords Commissioners there present. Sir Leonard Holiday, Lord Mayor. The
Earl of Nottingham. The Earl of Suffolk. The Earl of Worcester. The Earl of
Northampton. The Earl of Salisbury. The Lord Chief Justice of England. The Lord
Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Sir Christopher Yelverton, Knight, one of His
Majesty's Justices of the Kings Bench.

The Substance and Effect of the Indictment of Henry Garnet Superior of the
Jesuits in England, appears before in the Relation of the former Arraignment,
and therefore unnecessary to be repeated again; which Indictment was summarily
and effectually repeated by Sir John Croke Knight, his Majesty's Serjant at
Law, in this manner.

THis Person and Prisoner here at the Bar, this place, and this present
occasion and Action, do prove that true, which the Author of all Truth has
told us, That, Nihil est occultum quod non manifestabitur, and nihil est
secretum, quod non revelabitur and in in palam veniet, There is nothing hid
that shall not be made manifest, there is nothing secret that shall not be
revealed and come in public; and that God by whom Kings do reign, Consilium
pravorum dissipat, does scatter and bring to naught the counsel of the wicked.

That he spoke with fear and trembling, and with horror and amazedness, against
that rotten root of that hideous and hateful tree of Treason, and of that
detestable, and unheard of wickedness, he did crave pardon for it; affirming
that no flesh could mention without astonishment.

He showed that Henry Garnet of the profession of the Jesuits, otherwise
Walley, otherwise Darcy, otherwise Roberts, otherwise Farmer, otherwise Philips
(for by all those names he called himself) stood indicted of the most barbarous
and damnable Treasons, the like whereof were never heard of, that he was a man
Multorum Nominum, but not boni Nominis, of many names, as appeared by the
Indictment, but of no good Name; adorned by God and nature with many gifts and
graces, if the Grace of God had been joined with them; But that wanting, quanto
ornatior in other gifts, tanto nequior.

That this Garnet (his Majesty summoning his Parliament to be holden at
Westminister, the 19th of March, in the first year of his Reign, and by diverse
Prorogations continuing it till the third of October last,) together with
Catesby, lately slain in open Rebellion, and with Oswald Tesmond a Jesuit,
otherwise Oswald Greenwell, as a false Traitor against the most mighty, and
most renowned King our Sovereign Lord King King James, the 9th of June last,
traitorously did conspire and compass,

To depose the King, and to deprive him of his Government.

To destroy and kill the King, and the noble Prince Henry his eldest Son: Such
a King, and such a Prince, Such a Son of Such a Father, whose virtues are
rather with amazed silence to be wondered at, than able by any speech to be
expressed.

To stir sedition and slaughter throughout the Kingdom.

To subvert the true Religion of God, and whole Government of the Kingdom.

To overthrow the whole State of the Common wealth.

The manner how to perform these horrible treasons, the Sergeant said Horreo
dicere, his lips did tremble to speak it, but his heart praised God for his
mighty deliverance. The practice so inhumane, so barbarous, so damnable, so
detestable, as the like was never read nor heard of, or ever entered into the
heart of the most wicked man to imagine. And here he said, he could not but
mention that religious observation so religiously observed by his Religious
Majesty, wishing it were engraven in letters of gold in the hearts of all his
people, The more hellish the Imagination, the more Divine the Preservation.

This Garnet, together with Catesby and Tesmond, had speech and conference
together of these treasons, and concluded most traitorously, and devilishly.

That Catesby, Winter, Fawkes, with many other Traitors lately attainted of
high treason, would blow up with Gunpowder in the Parliament house, the King,
the Prince, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Judges of the Realm, the
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, and many other subjects and servants of the
King assembled in Parliament, at one Blow traitorously and devilishly to
destroy them all, and piece meal to tear them in sunder, without respect of
Majesty, Dignity, Degree, Age or Place.

And for that purpose great quantity of Gunpowder was traitorously and
secretly placed, and hid by these Conspirators under the Parliament house.

This being the substance and the effect of the Indictment, Garnet did plead
Not guilty to it: and a very discreet and substantial Jury, with allowance of
challenges unto the prisoner, were sworn at the Bar for the trial of him.

To whom the Sergeant showed that they should have evidences to prove him
guilty, that should be Luce clariores, that every man might read them running.

They should have Testimonia Rerum, and Loquentia signa, Witnesses and
Testimonies of the things themselves.

Reum confitentem, or rather, Reos confitentes and accusantes invicem.

That every one may say unto him, Serve nequam, thou wicked subject, thou
wicked servant, Ex ore tuo te judico, Of thine own mouth I judge thee, of thine
own mouth I condemn thee.

And this shall be made so manifest by him that best can do it, as shall stop
the mouth of all contradiction.

The effect of that which Sir Edward Coke, Knight, His Majesty's Attorney
General, said at the Arraignment of Henry Garnet, Superior of the Jesuits in
England, as near to his own words as the same could be taken.
YOur Lordships may perceive by the parts of the Indictment, which have been
succinctly opened, that this is but a latter Act of that heavy and woeful
Tragedy, which is commonly called the Powder Treason, wherein some have already
played their parts, and, according to their demerits, suffered condign
punishment and pains of death. We are now to proceed against this Prisoner for
the same Treason; in which respect, the necessary repetition of some things
before spoken, shall at the least seem tolerable: for that Nunquam nimis
dicitur, quod nunquam satis dicitur, It is never said too often, that can never
be said enough: Nay, it may be thought justifiable to repeat in this case, for
that in respect of the confluence and access of people, at the former
Arraignment, many could not hear at that time. And yet because I fear it would
be tedious, for that most of all my Lords Commissioners, and of this Honorable
and Great Assembly, were present at the Arraignment, and for that I am now to
deal with a man of another quality, I will only touch, and that very little,
of the former Discourse or Evidence, and that little also shall be mingled with
such new matter as shall be worth the hearing, as being indeed of weight and
moment; and all this with very great brevity.

But before I further proceed to the opening of this so great a Cause, I hold
it fit and necessary to give satisfaction to two diverse and adverse sorts of
men, who according to the diverse affections of their hearts, have divined and
conjectured diversely of the cause of the procrastination and delay of
proceeding, especially against this person, the matter wherewith he stands
charged being so transcendant and exorbitant as it is. The first sort of these,
out of their hearty love and loyalty to their Natural Liege Lord and King, and
to their dear Country, and this State, have feared the issue of this delay,
lest that others might be animated by such protraction of Judgment, to
perpetrate the like: For they say, (and it is most true) Quia non profertur
cito contra malos sententia, absque timore Eccles. 8. 11.
ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala: Because speedy Justice is not executed
against wicked men, the people without all fear commit wickedness. And pity it
were that these good men should not be satisfied. The other sort are of those,
who in respect no greater expedition has been used against this Prisoner at
the Bar, fall to excusing of him, as gathering these presumptions and
conjectures: First, that if he, or any of the Jesuits, had indeed been justly
to be touched with this most damnable and damned Treason, surely they should
have been brought forth and tried before this time. Secondly, that there was a
Bill exhibited in Parliament concerning this Treason, and this Traitor, but
that it was deferred, and proceeded not for want of just and sufficient proofs.
Nay, thirdly, there was a particular Apology spread abroad for this man, and
another general for all Jesuits and Priests, together with this imputation,
That King-killing, and Queen-killing was not indeed a Doctrine of theirs, but
only a Fiction and Policy of our State, thereby to make the Popish Religion to
be despised, and in disgrace. Now for these men, pity it were, that the eye of
their understanding should not be enlightened and cleared, that so being by
demonstrative and luculent proofs convinced, they may be to their Prince and
Country truly converted. First therefore concerning the delay, (though it be
true, Quod flagellatur in cord, qui laudatur in ore) yet must I remember the
great pains of my Lords the Commissioners of his Majesty's Privy Council, in
this cause for Garnet, being first examined upon the 13th. of the last month,
has sithence been again examined and interrogated above twenty several times,
which lasted unto the 26th. of March, within two days of this Arraignment.
Touching the Bill in Parliament, it was indeed exhibited before Garnet was
apprehended: but his Majesty's gracious pleasure was, That albeit this Treason
be without all president and example, yet they should quietly and equally be
Indicted, Arraigned, publicly heard, and proceeded withal in a moderate,
ordinary, and just course of Law. Concerning their Apologies, and the Fictions
of State (as they term them) answer shall be made, by Gods grace, in the proper
place, when I come to lay open the plots and practices of the Jesuits, to the
satisfaction of all this Honorable and Great Assembly. But first I have an
humble Petition to present to your Lordships, and the rest of this grave
Auditory, for my self, in respect that I am necessarily to name great Princes;
yet with protestation and caution, that no blot is intended to be laid upon any
of them. I know there is Lex in sermon tenenda, a Law and Rule to be observed
in speaking, especially in this kind; and that Kings and great Princes, and the
mighty Men of this earth, are to be reverently and respectfully dealt withal.
And therefore I humbly recommend unto you these Considerations, concerning this
point of mentioning these Foreign States. First, That the Kingdoms were at those
times in open enmity and hostility, and that might be honorable at one time
which was not so at another; so that hostile actions were then justifiable and
honorable, as being in times of Hostility and War. Secondly, in these things,
it is not the Kings Attorney that speaks, but Garnet the Jesuit: as also, that
it proceeds from an inevitable necessity, for that the Examinations as well
of this, as of the rest of the Traitors, cannot otherwise be opened and urged
against them: so is the mention of great men by the impudency of these wicked
Traitors, woven into their Confessions, as they cannot be severed.

And with this comfort I conclude the Preface, That I hope in God, this days
work, in the judgment of so many as shall be attentive and well disposed, shall
tend to the glory of Almighty God, the honor of our Religion, the safety of
his most Excellent Majesty and his Royal Issue, and the security of the whole
Commonwealth.

For Memory and Method, all that I shall speak may be contracted to two general
Heads: First, I will consider the Offenses, together with certain
Circumstances, Precedent before the offense.
Concurrent with the offense.
Subsequent after the offense.


Secondly, I will lay down some observations concerning the same.

For the proper name of this offense, because I must speak of several Treasons,
for distinction and separation of this from the other, I will name it the
Jesuits Treason, as belonging to them, both ex congruo and condigno, They were
the Proprietaries, Plotters, and Procurers of it; and in such crimes, plus
peccat Author quam Actor, the Author or Procurer offends more, than the Actor
or Executor, as may appear by Gods own judgment given against the first sin in
Paradise, where the Serpent had three punishments inflicted upon him, as the
Original Plotter; the Woman two, being as the immediate Procurer; and Adam but
one, as the Party seduced.

Circumstances precedent and subsequent, so termed here, are indeed in their
proper natures all high Treasons, but yet in respect of the magnitude, nay,
monstrousness of this Treason, may comparatively, without any discountenance to
them in this case, be used as Circumstances. And because I am to deal with the
Superior of the Jesuits, I will only touch such Treasons, as have been plotted
and wrought by the Jesuits, of whom this man was Superior, and those Treasons
also since this Garnet his coming into England, whereof he may truly say, Et
quorum pars magna fui.

The coming of this Garnet into England, (which very act was a Treason) was
about twenty years past, viz. in July, 1586. in the 28th. year of the Reign of
the late Queen of famous and blessed memory; whereas the year before, namely
the 27th. year of Eliz. there was a Statute made, whereby it was Treason for
any, who was made a Romish Priest by any Authority from the Sea of Rome,
since the first year of her Reign, to come into her Dominions. Which Statute
the Romanists calumniate as a bloody, cruel, unjust, and a new upstart Law; and
abuse that place of our Savior, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, etc. to Matthew. 23. 37.
that purpose. But indeed it is both mild, merciful, and just, and grounded
upon the ancient fundamental Laws of England. For (as has already in the
former Arraignments been touched) before the Bull of Impious Pius Quintus, in
the 11th. year of the Queen, wherein her Majesty was Excommunicated and
Deposed, and all they accursed who should yield any obedience unto her, etc.
there were no Recusants in England, all came to Church, (howsoever Popishly
inclined, or persuaded in most points) to the same Divine Service we now use:
but thereupon presently they refused to assemble in our Churches, or join with
us in public Service, not for conscience of any thing there done, against
which they might justly except out of the Word of God, but because the Pope had
Excommunicated and Deposed her Majesty, and cursed those who should obey her:
and so upon this Bull ensued open Rebellion in the North, and many Garb^ils.
But see the event: Now most miserable in respect of this Bull was the state of
Romish Recusants, for either they must be hanged for Treason, in resisting
their lawful Sovereign, or cursed for yielding the due obedience unto her
Majesty. And therefore of this Pope it was said by some of his own favorites,
that he was Homo pius and doctus, sed nimis credulus, A holy and a learned man,
but over credulous; for that he was informed and believed, that the strength of
the Catholics in England was such, as was able to have resisted the Queen. But
when the Bull was found to take such an effect, then was there a Dispensation
given, both by Pius Quintus himself, and Gregory the 13th. That all Catholics
here might show their outward obedience to the Queen, ad redimendam vexationem,
and ad ostendendam externam obedientiam; but with these cautions and
limitations: 1. Rebus sic stantibus, things so standing as they did. 2. Donec
publica Bullae executio fieri posset; that is to say, They might grow into
strength, until they were able to give the Queen a Mate, that the public
execution of the said Bull might take place. And all this was confessed by
Garnet under his own hand, and now again openly confessed at the Bar.

In the 20th. year of Queen Elizabeth, came Campion the Jesuit, and many others
of his Profession with him, purposely to make a Party in England for the
Catholic cause, to the end that the Bull of Pius Quintus might be put in
execution. And though all this while Recusancy being grounded upon such a
disloyal Cause, were a very dangerous and disloyal thing; yet was there no Law
made in that behalf until the 23d. year of her Majesty's Reign. And that also
imposing only a Mulct or Penalty upon it, until conformity were offered and
showed. Anno 26 Eliz. came Parry with a resolution from Cardinal de Como and
others, that it was lawful to kill her Majesty, as being Excommunicated and
Deposed. Whereupon her Majesty entering into consultation how (together with her
safety, and the protection of her Subjects) she might avoid the imminent
dangers, and yet draw no blood from these Priests and Jesuits, found out this
moderate and mild course, as the best means to prohibit their coming at all
into her Land, there never being any King who would endure, or not execute any
such persons within their Dominions, as should deny him to be lawful King, or
go about to withdraw his Subjects from their Allegiance, or incite them to
resist or rebel against him. Nay, the bringing in of a Bull by a Subject of
this Realm against another, in the time of Edward the first, was adjudged
Treason. But by the way, for that Garnet has exclaimed, saying, Show us where
was your Church before Luther, design the place, name the persons, and so
forth; it is answered, by a comparison of a Wedge of pure Gold, which coming
into the hands of Impostors, is, by their sophistications and mixtures, for
gain and worldly respects, increased and augmented into a huge body and mass,
and retaining still an outward fair show andtincture of Gold. Where is now the
pure Gold, says one? show me the place. I answer, In that mass, but for the
extracting thereof, and purifying it from dross, that must be done by the Art
of the Workman, and the Trial of the Touchstone. So the true Religion and
Service of Almighty God, being, for humane respects, and worldly pomp, mixed
and over-laden with a number of superstitious Ceremonies and Inventions of man;
yet ever had God his true Church holding his truth, which has been by skilful
Workmen, with the Touchstone of the Word of God, refined and separate from the
Dross of man's Inventions.

But to proceed. In the 28th. year of Queen Elizabeth, being the year of our
Lord 86. in June, came Garnet into England, breaking through the Wall of
Treason, being in truth, Totus compositus ex proditione. And this was at that
time, when the great Armado of Spain, which the Pope blessed and Christened by
the name of, The Invincible Navy, was, by the instigation of that high Priest
of Rome, preparing and collecting together of many parcels, out of diverse
parts, where they could be bought, or hired, or borrowed, and therefore may be
called, A compounded Navy, having in it 158 great Ships. The Purveyors and
Forerunners of this Navy and Invasion, were the Jesuits, and Garnet among
them, being a Traitor even in his very entrance and footing in the Land. But
the Queen, with her own Ships, and her own Subjects, did beat this Armado, God
himself (whose cause indeed it was) fighting for us against them, by Fire, and
Seas, and Winds, and Rocks, and Tempests, scattering all, and destroying most
of them. For, Offenso Creatore, offenditur omnis creatura, the Creator being
offended, every Creature is readily armed to revenge his quarrel; in which
respect he is called, The Lord of Hosts. So that of 158, scarce 40 of their
Ships returned to the Bar of their own Haven; and it is reported, most of them
also perished. Insomuch that in this respect, we may say of Queen Elizabeth, as
the Poet writes of the Christian Emperor, O nimium dilecta Deo, cui militat
ether,
Et conjuratt veniunt ad classica venti.


Observe here, that about the time of this Invasion, there being in Spain met
in consultation about that business, the Cardinal of Austria, the Duke of
Medina, Count Fuentes, two Irish Bishops, with sundry Military men, and amongst
others, Winslade an Englishman; The Irish Bishops perceiving that they expected
a Party of Catholics in England, resolved, that true it was, that it was not
possible to do any good here in England, unless there were a Party of
Catholics made beforehand. But such, said they, was the policy of England, as
that could never be effected; for if any suspicion or fear arose, the
Catholics should quickly be either shut up, or quite cut off. Oh, says an old
Soldier, there present, Hoc facit pro nobis, that makes for us; for by that
means their Souls shall go to Heaven for their Religion, their Bodies to the
Earth for their Treason, and their Lands and Goods to us as Conquerors: and
this was that indeed they principally aimed at. Note here, that sithence the
Jesuits set foot in this Land, there never passed four years without a most
pestilent and pernicious Treason, tending to the subversion of the whole State.
After that hostile Invasion in 88. the Jesuits fell again to secret and
treasonable practices; for then, in the year 92, came Patrick Cullen, who was
incited by Sir William Stanley, Hugh Owen, Jacques Fraunces, and Holt the
Jesuit, and resolved by the said Holt to kill the Queen; to which purpose he
received Absolution, and then the Sacrament at the hands of the said Jesuit,
together with this ghostly counsel, That it was both lawful and meritorious to
kill her. Nay, said Jacques, that base Landress Son, (who was a continual
practiser both with this Cullen and others, to destroy her Majesty) The State
of England is, and will be so settled, that unless Mistress Elizabeth be suddenly
taken away, all the Devils in Hell will not be able to prevail against it, or
shake it.

Now Cullen's Treason was accompanied with a Book called Philopater, written
for the abetting and warranting of such a devilish act in general by Creswel
the Legier Jesuit in Spain, under the name of Philopater. Anno 94. came
Williams and York to the same end, viz. to kill the Queen, being wrought to
undertake so vile and detestable a fact by Father H^lt the Jesuit, and other
his accomplices; And thereupon the said Willams and York, in the Jesuits College
received the Sacrament together of father Holt, and other Jesuits, to execute
the same. And that Treason likewise was accompanied with a Book written by the
legier Jesuit and Rector at Rome, Parsons, under the name of Doleman,
concerning Titles, or rather tittles: a lewd and a lying book, full of
falsehood, forgery and malediction. Anno 97. came Squire from Spain, to poison
her Majesty, incited, directed, and warranted by Walpole a Jesuit, then
residing there: at whose hands likewise, after absolution, he received the
Sacrament, as well to put the practice in execution, as to keep it secret. All
these Treasons were freely and voluntarily confessed by the parties themselves,
under their own hands, and yet remain extant to be seen.

In the year 1601. when practices failed, then was Force again attempted; For
then (as in the former Arraignment has been declared) was Thomas Winter
employed to the King of Spain, together with Tesmond the Jesuit, by this
Garnet, who wrote his Letters to Arthur alias Joseph Creswell, (the only man
whom I have heard of to change his Christian name) the legier Jesuit in Spain,
for the furtherance of that negotiation, which was, as has been said, To offer
the services of the English Catholics to the King, and to deal further
concerning an Invasion, with promise from the Catholics here, of forces, both
of men and horses, to be in a readiness to join with him. This negotiation by
the means of Creswel, to whom Garnet wrote, ^ook such effect, that the two
kingdoms standing then in hostlity, the proposition of the English Romish
Catholics was accepted and entertained, an army to Invade (as has been
specified in the former Arraignment) promised, and 100000. Crowns to be
distributed amongst Romanists and discontented persons, making of a party in
England, and for the furtherance of the said service granted. In the mean time
the King earnestly desired, That if the Queen of England should happen to die,
he might receive present and certain Advertisemene thereof.

Now this Treason was accompanied with the Clem. 8.
Popes own writing. For now does the Holy Father cause to be sent hither to
Garnet two Briefs or Bulls, one to the Clergy, and another to the Laity: wherein
observe the Title, the Matter, the Time. The Title of the one was, Dilectis
filijs, Principibus, and Nobilibus Catholicis Anglicanis, Salutem and
Apostolicam benedictionem: that is, To our beloved sons the Nobles and
Gentlemen of England, which are Catholics, Greeting, and Apostolical
benediction. The title of the other was, Dilectis filijs Archipresbytero, and
reliquo Clero Anglicano, etc. To our beloved sons, the Archpriest, and the rest
of the Catholic Clergy. The matter was, that after the death of her Majesty,
whether by course of Nature or otherwise, whosoever should lay claim or Title
to the Crown of England, though never so directly and nearly interested
therein, by Descent and Blood Royal, yet unless he were such an one as would
not only tolerate the Catholic (Romish) Religion, but by all his best
endeavors and force promote it, and according to the ancient custom, would by
a solemn and sacred Oath religiously promise and undertake to perform the same,
they should admit or receive none to be King of England* His words are these,
Quantumcunque propinquitate sanguinis niterentur, nisi ejusmodi essent, qui
fidem Catholicam non modo tolerarent, sed omni open ac studio promoverent, and
more Majorum Iurejurando se id praestituros susciperent, etc.

As for King James (at whom the Pope aimed) he has indeed both Propinquitatem,
and Antiquitatem Regalis sanguinis, Propinquity and Antiquity of blood Royal,
for his just Claim and Title to this Crown both before and since the Conquest.
To insist upon the declaration and deduction of this point, and pass along
through the Series and course of so many Ages and Centuries, as it would be
over long for this place, so further I might herein seem as it were to guild
gold: Only in a word, His Majesty is lineally Sancta Margaretta Regina
Scotorum in Calendario Romano. David has the Epit. of Pi^s in Hector Boethius
Major, and Scoticronicon. Maud is styled Bona by the stories of those times.
descended from Margaret the Saint, daughter of Edward son of King Edmund
Grandchild of Great Edgar the Britain Monarch: which Margaret, sole Heir of the
English Saxon King, was married to Malcolme King of Scotland, who by her had
issue David the Holy their King, from whom that Race Royal at this day is
deduced, and Maud the Good, wife of the first and learned Henry King of
England, from whom his Majesty directly and lineally proceeds, and of whom a
Poet of that time wrote. Nec decor effecit fragilem, non sceptra superbam,
Sola potens humilis, sola pudica decens.


And lastly his Majesty comes of Margaret also the eldest daughter of Henry
the 7th. who was descended of that famous Union of those two fair Roses, the
White and the Red, York and Lancaster, the effecting of which union cost the
effusion of much English blood, over and besides four-score or thereabouts of
the Blood Royal. But a more famous Union is, by the goodness of the Almighty,
perfected in his Majesty's person, of diverse Lions, two Famous, Ancient, and
Renowned Kingdoms, not only without blood, or any opposition, but with such an
universal acclamation and applause of all sorts and degrees, (as it were with
one voice) as never was seen or read of. And therefore, most Excellent King,
for to him I will now speak, Cum triplici fulvum conjunge Leone Leonem,
Ut varias Atavus junxerat ante Rosas.
Majus opus varios sine pugna unire Leones,
Sanguine quam varias consociasse Rosas.


These four Noble and Magnanimous Lions, so firmly and undividually united, are
able, without any difficulty or great labor, to subdue and overthrow all the
Letters and Bulls (and their Calves also) that have been, or can be sent into
England.

Now for the time observe, that these Bulls or Briefs came upon the aforesaid
Negotiation of Thomas Winter into Spain, at what time an Army should shortly
after have been sent to invade the Land: and this was to be put in execution,
Quandocunque contingeret miseram illam foeminam ex hac vita excedere.
Whenever it should happen, that that miserable Woman (for so it pleased the
High Priest of Rome to call Great Queen Elizabeth) should depart this life. Was
Queen Elizabeth miserable? It is said, that Misera constat ex duobus contrarus,
scilicet, Copia, and Inopia: Ex copia tribulationis, and inopia consolationis.
Was she, I say, miserable, whom Almighty God so often and so miraculously
protected, both from the arrow that flies by day, their great Armado; and from
the Pestilence that walks in the darkness, their secret and treacherous
Conspiracies? That did beat her most potent Enemy? That set up a King in his
Kingdom? That defended Nations, and harbored and protected distressed People?
That protected her Subjects in peace and plenty, and had the hearts of the most
and the best of her Subjects? That Reigned Religiously and Gloriously, and died
Christianly and in peace? Oh blessed Queen, our late dear Sovereign, Semper
honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt. But Queen Elizabeth of famous memory,
(for memoria ejus semper erit in benedictione) as a bright Morning Star, in the
fullness of time, lost her natural light, when the great and glorious Sun
appeared in our Horizon. And now sithence the coming of great King James, there
have not passed, I will not say four years, but not four, nay, not two months,
without some Treason. First, in March 1603. upon the death of her Majesty, and
before they had seen his Majesty's face, was Christopher Wright employed into
Spain by Garnet, Catesby, and Tresham, to give advertisement of the Queens
death, and to continue the former Negotiation of Thomas Winter. And by him also
does this Garnet write to Creswel the Jesuit in commendation, and for
assistance and furtherance of his business.

As also in the 22d. of June following, was Guy Fawkes sent out of Flanders, by
Baldwin the Jesuit, by Sir William Stanley, and Hugh Owen, about the same
Treason; and by Letters from Baldwin, directed and commended to Creswel the
Legier Jesuit in Spain, for the procuring of his dispatch, as in the former
Arraignment has been declared. In the same June does Garnet the Superior,
together with Gerrard and other Jesuits, and Jesuited Catholics, labor, not
only in providing of Horses, which, by Thomas Winter and Christopher Wright,
upon their several negotiations they, in the names of all the Catholics in
England, had promised the King of Spain to assist and do him service withal,
at such time as the said King should send Forces to invade, either at
Milford-haven, or in Kent, as has before been showed: But also did, by force
of the said two Bulls or Briefs, dissuade the Romish Catholics from yielding
their due obedience to his Majesty, for that he was not of the Roman Religion,
contrary to the practice of the true Church and Churchmen, that undergo Wars,
Ferendo, non feriendo, with patience, not with strokes, their Weapons being
properly Orationes and Lachrymae, Prayers and Tears.

In the same June 9. which was 1603. Primo Iacobi, brake out likewise the
Treason of the Romish Priests, Watson and Clark; as also that other of Sir
Walter Raleigh and others. But the Jesuits seeing that the Peace was now in
great forwardness; and having advertisement also, that the King of Spain did
now distaste their Propositions, so that there was no further hope left for
force, then fell they again to secret practice. As for the Bulls or Briefs
before mentioned, when Catesby had informed Garnet, that King James was
proclaimed, and the State settled; they were by Garnet, as himself has
affirmed, burnt. But to proceed. In March, 1603. Garnet and Catesby (a
pestilent Traitor) confer together, and Catesby in general tells him, (though
most falsely) that the King had broken promise with the Catholics, and
therefore assuredly there would be stirs in England before it were long. In
September following meets Catesby and Thomas Piercy, and after an unjust, but a
grievous complaint made by Catesby of the Kings proceedings, for that contrary
to their expectations, his Majesty both did hold, and was like continually to
run the same course which the Queen before had held; Piercy presently breaks
forth into this devilish speech, That there was no way but to kill the King,
which he the said Piercy would undertake to do. But Catesby, as being Versuto
ingenio and profunda perfidia, a cunning, a wily, and a deep Traitor, intending
to use this so furious and fiery a Spirit to a further purpose, does, as it
were, stroke him for his great forwardness; yet with sage and stayed counsel
tells him, No, Tom, thou shall not adventure thy self to so small purpose; If
thou will be a Traitor, there is a Plot to greater advantage, and such a one as
can never be discovered, viz. the Powder Treason.

In January, in the first year of his Majesty, Garnet took out a General Pardon
under the Great Seal of England, of all Treasons, which Pardon, his Majesty, of
his Grace, granted to all men at his first entrance into his Kingdom, under the
name of Henry Garnet of London, Gent. but therein he never used any of his
alias dictus Walley, Farmer, or any other of his feigned names. But Catesby
fearing lest any of those whom he had or should take into Confederacy, being
touched in Conscience with the horror of so damnable a fact, might give it
over, and endanger the discovery of the Plot, seeks to Garnet (as being the
Sup^riour of the Jesuits, and therefore of high estimation and authority
amongst all those of the Romish Religion) to have his judgment and resolution
in Conscience, concerning the lawfulness of the fact, that thereby he might be
able to give satisfaction to any who should in that behalf make doubt or
scruple to go forward in that Treason. And therefore Catesby coming to Garnet,
propounds unto him the Case, and asks whether for the good and promotion of
the Catholic cause against Heretics (the necessity of time and occasion so
requiring) it be lawful or not, amongst many Nocents, to destroy and take away
some Innocents also. To this question Garnet advisedly and resolvedly answered,
That if the advantage were greater to the Catholic part by taking away some
Innocents together with many Nocents, then doubtless it should be lawful to
kill and destroy them all: And to this purpose he alleged a comparison of a
Town or City which was possessed by an Enemy, If at the time of taking thereof
there happen to be some few friends within the place, they must undergo the
fortune of the Wars in the general and common destruction of the Enemy. And
this resolution of Garnet the Superior of the Jesuits, was the strongest, and
the only bond, whereby Catesby afterward kept and retained all the Traitors
in that so abominable and detestable a Confederacy. For in March following,
Catesby, Thomas Winter, and others, resolve upon the Powder Plot, and Fawkes,
as being a man unknown, and withal a desperate person, and a Soldier, was
resolved upon, as fit for the executing thereof; to which purpose he was, in
April following, by Thomas Winter sought and fetched out of Flanders into
England. In May, in the second year of his Majesty, Catesby, Percy, John
Wright, Thomas Winter, and Fawkes meet, and having upon the holy Evangelists
taken an Oath of secrecy and constancy to this effect;

YOu shall swear by the blessed Trinity, and by the Sacrament you now purpose
to receive, never to disclose, directly or indirectly, by word or circumstance,
the matter that shall be proposed to you to keep secret, nor desist from the
execution thereof, until the rest shall give you leave.

They all were Confessed, had Absolution, and received thereupon the Sacrament,
by the hands of Gerrard the Jesuit then present. In June following Catesby and
Greenwel the Jesuit confer about the Powder Treason. And at Midsummer Catesby
having speech with Garnet of the Powder Treason; they said that it was so
secret, as that it must prevail, before it could be discovered. Then Garnet
seemed to desire that the Popes consent might be obtained; But Catesby
answered, that he took that as granted by the Pope in the two Bulls or Briefs
before; For that said he, if it were lawful not to receive, or to repel him,
as the said Bulls or Briefs did import, then it is lawful also to expel or
cast him out. Upon the 7th. of July 1604, was the Parliament Prorogued until
the 7th. of February; and in November following, Thomas Bates, being (as has
been declared more at large in the former Arraignment) fetched in by Catesby
his master, to participate in the Powder Treason, for better assurance of his
secrecy, and prosecution thereof, is by Greenwel the Jesuit confessed,
encouraged and told, that being for a good cause, he might and ought not only
conceal it, as committed unto him in secret by his master, but further said,
that it was no offense at all, but justifiable and good. About this time was
Robert Keys taken into the Confederacy, and by Catesby resolved of the
lawfulness thereof from the Jesuits.

In the 11th. of December they entered the Mine: and in March following, which
was in 1605, was Guy Fawks sent over to Sir William Stanley with letterts from
Garnet, to Baldwine the Legier Jesuit there, to take order that against the
time of the Blow, the forces might be brought near to the Sea side, to the end
that they might suddenly be transported into England. And there does Fawkes by
consent of the confederates, give Owen the Oath of secrecy and perseverance,
and then acquaints him with the whole Treason: Who having been a most malicious
and inveterate Traitor, greatly applauded it, and gave his consent and counsel
for the furtherance thereof. In May 1605, fell out certain Broils in Wales by
the Romish Catholics, at what time also Rookewood was by Catesby acquainted
with the Powder Treason, and resolved of the lawfulness of the fact by him as
from the Jesuits. Now does Garnet write to the Pope, that commandment might
come from his Holiness, or else from Aquaviva the General of the Jesuits, for
the staying of all commotions of the Catholics here in England, intending
indeed to set their whole rest of the Catholic Romish cause, upon the
Powder Plot, and in the mean time to lull us asleep in security, in respect of
their dissembled quitness and conformity, as also least impediment might be
offered to this main Plot by reason of any suspicion of the stirring of
Papists, or of inquiry after them upon occasion of any petty commotions or
broils. But when he further desired, that it might be so enjoined upon
censures, that latter request was not granted, least it might indeed be an
impediment to the Powder Plot.

In June following does Greenwel the Jesuit consult with Garnet his Superior,
of the whole course of the Powder Treason at large. Wherein observe the
politic and subtle dealing of this Garnet. First he would not (as he says)
confer of it with a lay man (other than Catesby whom he so much trusted) why
so? because that might derogate from the reverence of his Place, That a Jesuit,
and a Superior of them, should openly join with Laymen in cause of so much
blood; And therefore secondly, as he would consult of it with a Priest, and a
Jesuit, one of his own order and his subject; so for his further security, he
would consult thereof with Greenwel the Jesuit, as in a disguised confession.
And being informed, that the discourse would be too long to repeat kneeling, he
answered that he would consult with him of it in confession walking; and so
accordingly in an ambulatory confession, he at large discoursed with him of the
whole Plot of the Powder Treason; And that a Protector (after the Blow given)
should be chosen out of such of the Nobility as should be warned and reserved.

In this Month likewise was there a great conference and consultation betwixt
Garnet; Catesby, and Francis Tresham, concerning the strength of the Catholics
in England, to the end that Garnet might by Letters send direct Advertisement
thereof to the Pope; for that his Holiness would not be brought to show his
inclination concerning any Commotion or rising of the Catholic part, until
such time as he should be certainly informed that they had sufficient and able
Force to prevail.

And in August following, Garnet, in a conference had about acquainting of the
Pope with the Powder Treason, named and appointed Sir Edmund Baynam for to
carry ^at message to the Pope, yet not to him as Pope, but to him (...) a
temporal Prince, and by him does Garnet write Letters in that behalf; as also
for staying of Commotions, under pain of Censures, well knowing that before his
Letters could be answered, the House of Parliament (according to their designs)
should have been blown up, and the whole State overthrown. But this trick he
used like a thief, that going to steal and take Partriches with a setting dog,
does rate his dog for questing or going too near, until he have laid his net
over them, for fear the game should be sprung, and the purpose defeated.

In this Month also does Garnet write to Baldwine the Legier Jesuit in the
Low Countries, in the behalf of Catesby, that Owen should move the Marquess for
a Regiment of horses for him the said Catesby, not with any intent, as it was
agreed, that Catesby should undertake any such charge, but that under color of
it, horses and other necessaries might be provided without suspicion to furnish
the Traitors.

In September following does Parsons the Jesuit write to Garnet, to know the
particulars of the Project in hand, for the journey to Saint Winifrides Well in
this Month. It was but a Jergon, to have better opportunity by color thereof,
to confer and retire themselves to those parts.

In October does Garnet meet the other Traitors at Coughton in Warwickshire,
which was the place of Rendevouz, whither they resorted out of all Countries.

Upon the ^st of November, Garnet openly prays for the good success of the
great Action, concerning the Catholic cause in the beginning of the
Parliament; and prayer is more then consent. For, Nemo orat sed qui sperat and
credit. He in the prayer used two verses of a Hymn, Gentem auferte perfidam
credentium de finibus, ut Christo lauds debitas persolvamus alacriter.

Now was the Letter with the Lord Mountegle, whose memory shall be blessed, on
the fourth of November, by the providence of the Almighty, not many hours
before the Treason should have been executed, was it fully discovered.

On the 5th of November, being the time when the Traitors expected that their
devilish practice should have taken effect, they convented at Dunchurch under
color of a great hunting match, appointed by Sir Everard Dighy, as being a man
of quality and account thereabout, purposing by this means to furnish
themselves with company for their intended Insurrection and Rebellion; for that
men being gathered together, and a tumult suddenly raised, the Traitors
thought, that every or most of them would follow the present fortune, and be
easily persuaded to take part with them, and that they might easily surprise
the person of the Lady Elisabeth, then being in those parts, in the Lord
Harringtons house.

Upon the 6th of November, early in the Morning, Catesby and the said
Confederates dispatched Thomas Bates with a Letter to Garnet the superior of
the Jesuits, who was (as they well knew) then ready at Coulton near unto them,
earnestly entreating his help and assistance, for the raising of Wales, and
putting so many as he could into open Rebellion. At what time Garnet, and
Greenwell (who then of purpose was there with Garnet,) then certainly
perceiving that the Plot was indeed discovered, and knowing themselves to be
the chiefest Authors thereof, prophesied the overthrow of the whole order of
the Jesuits, saying that they feared that the discovery and miscarrying of this
practice, would utterly undo and overthrow the whole Society of the Jesuits.
But Greenwel the Jesuit being carried with a more violent and fiery spirit,
posteth up and down, to incite such as he could to rise up in open Rebellion.
And meeting in Master Abingtons house with Hall another Jesuit, advises him
the said Hall likewise to loose no time, but forthwith to seek to raise and
stir up so many as he could. But Hall seeming to deliberate thereof, whether
seeing no end of so rash an attempt, or fearing by that means to be himself
apprehended, Tesmond told him that he was a Flegmatic^ ^ellow, and said, A man
may herein see the difference betwixt a Phlegmatic man (such as he meant Hall
was) and a Choleric, as he said himself was; and further added, that he was
resolved to do his best endevors for the raising of a Rebellion, under this
false pretext and color, That it was concluded that the throats of all the
Catholics in England should be cut. So persuading himself to incite them to
take Arms for to stand upon their Guard and Defense; and with this device he
posted away into the County of Lancaster: afterward Hall the Jesuit,
othertherwise called Oldcorn, being urged by Humphrey Littleton with the evil
success of their intended Treason, that surely God was displeased and offended
with such bloody and barbarous courses, in stead of an humble acknowledgment of
the Justice of God, and a sense of the wickedness of the Treason, fell rather
Satanically to argue for the justification of the same, and said, Ye must not
judge the cause by the event: for the eleven Tribes of Israel were by God
himself commanded to go and fight against Benjamin, yet were they twice
overthrown. So Jews of France fighting against the Turk, his Army was
scattered, and himself died of the Plague. And lastly, the Christians defending
the Rhodes, were by the Turks overcome. And these he applied to the
Powder Treason, and persuaded Littleton not to judge it ungodly or unlawful by
the event.

Observe here a double consequent of this Powder Treason: 1. Open Rebellion, as
has been showed both immediately before, and more at large in the former
Arraignment: and since that blasphemy in Garnet, the Superior of the Jesuits:
for he having liberty in the Tower to write, and sending a Letter (which Letter
was openly showed in the Court before him) to an acquaintance of his in the
Gatehouse, there was nothing therein to be seen but ordinary matter, and for
certain necessaries: but in the Margent, which he made very great and spacious,
and underneath where there remained clean paper, he wrote cunningly with the
Juice of an Orange, or of a Lemmon, to publish his Innocence, and concerning
his usage, and there denies those things which before he had freely and
voluntarily confessed, and said, that for the Spanish Treason, he was freed by
his Majesty's Pardon, and as for the Powder Treason, he hoped for want of proof
against him, to avoid that well enough: but concludes blasphemously, applying
the words which were spoken of our blessed Savior, to himself in this damnable
Treason, and says, Necesse est ut unus homo moriatur pro populo, It is
necessary that one man die for the people; which words Caiphas spoke of Christ.
Wherein note his Prevarication and Equivocation; for before the Lords
Commissioners, he truly and freely confessed his Treasons, being (as himself
under his own hand confessed) overwhelmed tanta nube testium, and yet ad
faciendum populum, in his Letters which he wrote abroad, he clears himself of
the Powder Treason. And thus much concerning the two Circumstances subsequent,
which were Rebellion and Blasphemy.

The Circumstances concurring, are concerning the Persons offending and
offended. For the principal Person offending here at the Bar, he is, as you
have heard, a man of many names, Garnet, Wallye, Darcy, Roberts, Farmer,
Phillips: and surely I have not commonly known or observed a true man, that
has had so many false Appellations. He is by Country an Englishman, by Birth
a Gentleman, by Education a Scholar, afterward a Corrector of the Common Law
Print, with Mr. Tottle the Printer, and now is to be corrected by the Law. He
has many Gifts and Endowments of Nature, by Art Learned, a good Linguist, and
by Profession a Jesuit, and a Superior, as indeed he is Superior to all his
Predecessors in devilish Treason; a Doctor of Jesuits, that is, a Doctor of
five Dd. as, Dissimulation, Deposing of Princes, Disposing of Kingdoms,
Daunting and deterring of Subjects, and Destruction. Their Dissimulation
appears out of their Doctrine of Equivocation. Concerning which it was
thought fit to touch something of that which was more copiously delivered in
the former Arraignment, in respect of the presence of Garnet there, who was the
Superior of the Jesuits in England, concerning the Treatise of Equivocation,
seen and allowed by Garnet, and by Blackwell the Arch Priest, wherein under the
pretext of the lawfulness of a mixed proposition to express one part of a man's
mind, and retain another, people are indeed taught not only simple lying, but
fearful and damnable Blasphemy. And whereas the Jesuits ask why we convict and
condemn them not for Heresy; it is for that they will Equivocate, and so
cannot that way be tried or judged according to their words.

Now for the antiquity of Equivocation, it is indeed very old, within little
more then 300. years after Christ, used by Arrius the Heretic, Socrat. Hist.
who having in a general Counsel been condemned, and then by the commandment of
Constantine the Emperor sent into Exile, was by the said Emperor upon instant
intercession for him, and promise of his future conformity to the Nicene faith,
recalled again: who returning home, and having before craftily set down in
writing his Heretical belief, and put it into his bosom, when he came into the
presence of the Emperor, and had the Nicene faith propounded unto him, and was
thereupon asked, whether he then did indeed, and so constantly would hold that
faith; he (clapping his hand upon his bosom where his paper lay) answered and
vowed, that he did, and so would constantly profess and hold that Faith (laying
his hand on his bosom where the paper of his Heresy lay) meaning fraudulently
(by the way of Equivocation) that faith of his own, which he had written and
carried in his bosom. For these Iusuits, they indeed make no vow of speaking
truth, and yet even this Equivocating, and lying is a kind of unchastity,
against which they vow and promise: For as it has been said of old, Cor
linguae faederat naturae sanctio, veluti in quodam certo Connubio: Ergo cum
dissonent cor and loquutio, Sermo concipitur in Adulterio, that is, The law and
Sanction of Nature, has (as it were) married the heart and tongue, by joining
and knitting of them together in a certain kind of marriage; and therefore when
there is discord between them two, the speech that proceeds from them, is said
to be conceived in Adultery; and he that breeds such bastard children, offends
against Chastity. But note the heavy and woeful fruit of this Doctrine of
Equivocation. Francis Tresham being near his natural death in the Tower, had of
charity his wife permitted (for his comfort) to come unto him: who
understanding that her husband had before directly and truly accused Garnet of
the Spanish Treason, least belike her husband should depart this life, with a
conscience that he had revealed any thing concerning the Superior of the
Jesuits, a very little before he died, drew him to this, that his own hand
being so feeble as that he could not write himself, yet he caused his servant
then attending on him, to write that which he did dictate, and therein
protested upon his salvation, that he had not seen the said Garnet of 16. years
before, and thereupon prayed that his former confession to the contrary might
in no wise take place. And that this paper of his Retractation which he had
weakly, and dyingly subscribed, might after his death be delivered to the Earl
of Salisbury: Whereas Master Garnet himself has clearly confessed the Spanish
Treason, and now acknowledged the same at the Bar; and he and Mistress Vaux and
others directly confess and say, that Garnet and Tresham had within two years
space been very often together, and also many times before. But Qualis vita,
finis ita. And Garnet himself being at the Bar afterward, urged to say what he
thought of such the departure of Francis Tresham out of this life, answered
only this, I think he meant to Equivocate. Thus were they stained with their
own works, and went a whoring with their own Inventions, as it is in the Psalm.
So that this is indeed Gens perfida, according to the Hymn, a perfidious
people, and therefore Jurat? creed minus, non Jurat? credere noli. Jurat, non
Jurat hostis, ab host cave.

For their Doctrine of Deposing of Princes, Simanca and Philopater are plain
(as has in the former Arraignment been more amply declared, and was now again
at large to Garnets face repeated.) If a Prince be an Heretic, then he is
Excommunicated, Cursed, and Deposed, his children deprived of all their Right
of Succession, himself not to be restored to his Temporal Estate upon
repentance; and by an Heretic they profess that he is intended and meant,
namely, whosoever does not hold the Religion of the Church of Rome. Nay there
is an easier and a more expedite way then all these to fetch off the Crown from
off the head of any King Christened whatsoever, which is this, That Princeps
indulgendo haereticis amittit Regnum, If any Prince shall but tolerate or
favor Heretics, he loses his Kingdom: Nay whereas Garnet in defense of this
usurped power of the high Priest of Rome, alleged, Nos Sanctorum, etc. out of
the Decretals, in the very next Title before that, there is another Decree that
passes all we have recited, wherein it is showed, that Zachary the Pope
deposed Childerick of France, for nothing else there specified, Sed quia
Inutilis, but only for that he was reputed unprofitable to Govern.

Now as concerning their daunting and deterring of Subjects, which is a part of
the Jesuits profession: It were good that they would know and remember, how
that the most Noble and famous Kings of England, never were afraid of Popes
Bulls, no not in the very midnight of Popery, as Edward the Confessor, Hen. 1.
Edw. 1. Ric. 2. Hen. 5. Hen. 4. etc. And in the time of Henry the seventh, and
in all their times, the Popes Legate never passed Callis, but stayed there, and
came not to England, until he had taken a solemn Oath to do nothing to the
detriment of the Crown or State.

For the persons offended, they were these: First the King, of whom I have
spoken often, but never enough: A King of High and most Noble ancient descent,
as has been briefly declared, and in himself full of all Imperial virtues;
Religion, Justice, Clemency, Learning, Wisdom, Memory, Affability, and the
rest. Then the Queen, and she in respect of her happy fruitfulness, is a great
blessing, in so much that of her in that respect, may be said that she is, Ortu
magna, viro major, sed maxima Prole, Great in Birth, Greater in her Marriage,
but to all posterity greatest in the blessed fruit of her Womb, as having
brought forth the greatest Prince that ever England had. 3 The Noble Prince, of
whom we may say with the Poet, Quae te tam laeta tulere secula? qui tanti talem
genuere parents? Never Prince, true heir Apparent to the Imperial Crown, had
such a father, nor ever King had such a son. Then the whole Royal Issue, the
Council, the Nobility, the Clergy, nay our Religion it self, and specially this
City of LONDON, that is famous for her Riches, more famous for her People,
(having above five hundred thousand souls within her and her Liberties) most
famous for her Fidelity, and more then most famous of all the Cities in the
world for her true Religion and service of God. Hold up thy head (Noble City)
and advance thy self, for that never was thy Brow blotted with the least taint
or touch, or suspicion of Disloyalty: Thou may truly say with the Prophet
David, I will take no wicked thing in hand, I hate the sin of unfaithfulness,
there shall no such cleave unto me: Therefore for thy Fidelity thou art
honored with the Title of THE KINGS CHAMBER, as an inward place of his
greatest safety: And for thy comfort and joy this day, has BRITAINS great King
honored thee with the proceeding upon this great and Honorable Commission,
after the heavy and doleful Rumors this other day, when it was certainly
known that King JAMES was in safety, well did the fidelity of this City appear,
(whereof I was an eyewitness) Vna voce conclamaverunt omnes, Salva Londinum,
salva Patria, salva Religio; Iacobus Rex noster salvus: Our City, our Country,
our Religion is safe, for our King JAMES is in safety.

The observations are many, and only in a word to be touched. The first is,
that in the Spanish Treason before mentioned, and this Powder Treason, there
was the same order, cause, and end. The order was, first to deal by secret
practice and Treason, and then by force and invasion. The cause which they
pretend, was the Romish Catholic Religion. The end was the final destruction
of the Royal succession, yea even Occidere regnum, to overthrow and dissolve
the whole Kingdom.

2. Note, that even the Enemy has acknowledged that our State is so settled and
established, as neither strength nor Stratagem can prevail, unless there be a
party made in England.

3. We shall never have Bull more to come from Rome to England, because they
shall never have a party strong enough to encounter with so many Lions.

4. All their Canons, Decrees, and newfound Doctrines tend to one of these two
ends: either worldly pride, or wicked policy, for the amplitude and enlargement
of the Popes authority, and for the safety of the Jesuits, Priests, etc.

5. Observe that Baynam, a Layman, and one of the Damned crew, and so naming
himself, was sent to inform the Pope as a temporal Prince.

6. I conceive their fall to be near at hand, both by Divinity and by
Philosophy. For the first, there are now in England about 400. Priests: so many
were there in Israel in the days of Achab. Who, says God, shall go and deceive
Achab, that he may fall? a lying spirit in the mouths of his 400. Prophets
undertook and effected it; their fall was near, when once a lying Spirit had
possessed the Priests, according to the vision of Micheas, as now it has
possessed the Jesuits. 2. The imitation of good for the most part comes short
of the pattern: but the imitation of evil ever exceeds the example. Now no
imitation can exceed this fact, and therefore their time is at an end.

7. Many condemn it now, that would have commended it, if it had taken effect,
for this, say they, is Enumero eorum quae non laudantur nisi peracta.

8. They and their adherents spread abroad false rumors; as that the King
should have broken promise with them concerning toleration: which mixture of
Gods service rather then he would suffer, he would lose Children, Crown, Life,
and all. Nay, they may see there is no such hope left, for that his Majesty
brings up his Royal Issue in the true Religion and service of the Almighty.

Lastly observe the wonderful providence of God in the admirable discovery of
this Superior Jesuit to be party to this Treason, and that in two respects.

First, in respect of the means of secrecy used by him in conference only with
Catesby of the Laity.

Secondly, They had a strong and a deep Oath given them both for secrecy and
perseverance.

Thirdly, They hereupon received the holy Sacrament.

Fourthly, They were allowed and taught by the Jesuits, to equivocate upon
Oath, salvation or otherwise, and how then should it be discovered?

Fifthly, their secret intelligence was such, as that it was unpossible by the
wit of man to be found out. And therefore the second thing is, how this
Treason, being long sithence plotted, the providence of God did continually
from time to time divert and put off the executing thereof, by unexpected
putting off the times of assembly in Parliament. For the Parliament begun the
19th of March in the first year of his Majesty's Reign, and continued till the
7th of July following, before which time the Conspirators could not be ready;
from thence it was proroged until the 7th of February, against which time,
they could not make the Mine ready, in respect that they could not dig there,
for that the Commissioners of the Union sare near the place, and the wall was
thick, and therefore they could not be provided before the 7th of February; and
on the 7th of February the Parliament was proroged until the 5th of October.
After this they found another Course, and altered the place from the Mine to
the Cellar. O blessed Change of so wicked a work! Oh but these fatal Engineers
are not yet discovered, and yet all things are prepared! Oh prorogue it once
more: and accordingly God put it into his Majesty's heart (having then not the
least suspicion of any such matter) to prorogue the Parliament, and further to
open and inlighten his understanding, out of a mystical and dark Letter, like
an Angel of God to point to the Cellar, and command that to be searched, so
that it was discovered thus miraculously, but even a few hours before the
Design should have been executed.

The Conclusion therefore shall be this, Qui cum Jesus itis, non itis cum
Iesuitis: for they courage themselves in mischief, and commune among themselves
secretly, how they may lay snares, and say, that no man shall see them. But God
shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, that they shall be wounded; In
so much that whosoever sees it, shall say, This has God done; for they shall
perceive that it is his work.

Then were repeated the proofs for every of the particular accusations
aforesaid, by the express and voluntary confessions of Garnet, and of his
Accomplices themselves, and of two credible witnesses sworn at the Bar, and
openly heard viva voce, and acknowledged by Garnet himself to be men without
exception.

THen Mr. Garnet having license of the Court to answer what he could for
himself, spoke, and divided all which had been objected, to his remembrance,
into 4 parts, viz.
Containing matter of 1 Doctrine. 2 Recusants. 3 Jesuits in general. 4 Himself
in particular.

In doctrine he remembered two points.

1. Concerning Equivocation, whereunto he answered, that their Church condemned
all lying, but especially if it be in cause of Religion and faith, that being
the most pernicious lie of all others, and by St. Augustine condemned in the
Priscillianists: Nay, to lie in any cause is held a fin, and evil, Howsoever of
8 degrees which St. Augustine makes, the lowest indeed is to lie for to
procure the good of some without hurting of any: So then our Equivocation is
not to maintain lying, but to defend the use of certain Propositions. For a man
may be asked of one, who has no Authority to interrogate, or examined
concerning something which belongs not to his cognizance who asks, As what
a man thinks, etc. So then no man may Equivocate, when he ought to tell the
truth, Otherwise he may; And so St. Augustine upon John says, That Christ
denied he knew the day of Judgment, viz. with purpose to tell it to his
Disciples; and so St. Thomas and others, who handle this matter. Chiefly under
the Title of Confession. 2. For the second point, which was the Power of the
Pope in deposing of Princes, his Answer was threefold. 1. That therein he
only propounded and followed the general Doctrine of the Church. 2. That this
Doctrine of the Power of the Pope, was by all other Catholic Princes tolerated
without grievance. 3. That yet for his own part, he always made a difference in
the matter of Excommunicating and Deposing of Princes, betwixt the condition
and state of our King, and of others, who having sometimes been Catholics,
did, or shall afterward fall back. As for Simanca and other Writers,
whatsoever they set down of the Deposing of Heretics, it is to be understood
of those Princes, who having sometimes professed the Faith of the Church of
Rome, do afterward make a defection from the same.

2. For Recusant^, 1. I desire them not to impute any offense or crime of mine,
to the prejudice of the cause of Religion. 2. Concerning their not going to
Church, whereas it was urged by Mr. Attorney, that the grounds of their not
going to Church, was the Excommunication and Bull of Pius Quintus, and that now
they may go, for that his Majesty is not denounced Excommunicate; I answer,
That it follows not; for the Arrians and Catholics had the same Service in
their Churches, yet came they not together. And I know diverse my self, who
before that Bull, refused to go to Church all the time of Queen Elizabeth,
though perhaps most Catholics did indeed go to Church, before it was about the
end of the Council of Trent, where this matter was discussed by twelve learned
men, and concluded not lawful. And this was occasioned, for that Calvin himself
held it not lawful for any Protestant to be present, not only at our Mass,
wherein perhaps they may say there is Idolatry, but not at our Even-song, being
the same with theirs.

3. Concerning the Jesuits, he says, That if any were privy to such horrible
Treasons, it was impious, especially in men of their profession: But said, That
he talked with some of them about it, and that they denied it.

4. Touching my self, The Negotiation into Spain was indeed propounded unto me,
and I was also acquainted with the Negotiation for Money, but ever intending it
should be bestowed for the relief of poor Catholics: But when they were there,
they moved for an Army; which when they afterward acquainted me withal, I
misliked it, and said, It would be much disliked at Rome. Only I must needs
confess, I did conceal it, after the example of Christ, who commands us, when
our Brother offends, to reprove him, for if he do amend, we have gained him:
Yet I must needs confess, that the Laws made against such concealing are very
good and just, for it is not fit the safety of a Prince should depend upon any
other man's Conscience. So that I am verily persuaded, if they yielded to me, it
had been good. But what their intent and meaning was in desiring an Army, I
knew not; and I was charged not to meddle therein, no not with the money which
was to be sent for Pensions, though it was to maintain the Title of the King.

The Earl of Salisbury then demanded, To Earl of Salisbury.
maintain whose Title?

Garnet answered, The Title of the King of Garnet.
Spain.

The Earl of Northampton asked him, Why Earl of Northam.
he did not oppose himself against it, and forbid it, as he might have done?
For, Qui cum possit non prohibet, jubet.

Whereupon Garnet answered, That he might Garnet.
not do it; and for sending of Letters, and commending some Persons thereby, he
confessed he did it often, as they were commended to him, without knowing
either their Purposes, or some of their Persons: for he never knew Mr. Wright
for whom he writ.

The Earl of Salisbury then replied to Garnet, Earl of Salisbury.
I must now remember you, how little any of your Answers can make for your
purpose, when you would seek to color your dealing with Baynham, by professing
to write to Rome to procure a countermand of Conspiracies. And yet you know,
when he took his journey toward Rome, the blow must needs have been passed
before the time he could have arrived to the Popes presence, (such being your
zeal and his haste for any such prevention) as it was about the 20th. of our
October when he passed by Florence toward Rome.

To which Garnet made no great answer, but Garnet.
let it pass. And then went on with his defense of sending* Letters in
commendation of many of those with which he had been formerly charged; and so
confessed, that he had written in commend^tion of Fawkes, thinking that he went
to serve as a Soldier, not knowing then of any other purpose he had in hand.
And as for Sir Edmond Baynham, what he or Mr. Catesby intended, he knew not in
particular; only Mr. Catesby asked him in general the question, of the
lawfulness to destroy Innocents with Nocents, as ha^ been before objected
against him; which at first, I thought, said Garnet, had been an idle question*
though afterward I did verily think, he intended something that was not good.
Whereupon having shortly after this received Letters from Rome, to prohibit all
Insurrections intended b^ Catholics, which might perturb this State* Garnet
informed Catesby thereof, and told him That if he proceeded against the Pope's
will, h^ could not prevail. But Catesby refused, an^ said, He would not take
notice of the Pope's pleasure by him. Notwithstanding he showed t^ Catesby the
general Letter which he had received from Rome; but said, he would infor^ the
Pope, and tell Garnet also in particular wha^ attempt he had in hand, if he
would hear it which afterward he offered to do, but Garn^ refused to hear him,
and at two several times re^ quested him to certify the Pope what he intende^
to do.

And when Sir Edmond Baynham (as (...) pretended) was to go over into Flanders
for (...) Soldier, Garnet thought good to send him to the Popes Nuncio, and to
commend him to other friends of his, That they should send him to in^ form the
Pope of the distressed estate of the Ca^ tholicks in England: the rather, that
the Po^ having a Layman there, might be acquainte^ with all their proceedings:
And that Baynha^ might then learn of the Pope, what course (...) would advise
the Catholics in England to take for their own good; but wished Baynham in no
case to use Garnet' s name to the Nuncio in that behalf.

Then were the two Witnesses called for, both of them Persons of good
estimation, that overheard the Interlocution betwixt Garnet and Hall the
Jesuit, viz. Mr. Fauset, a man learned, and a Justice of Peace; and Mr.
Lockerson. But Mr. Fauset being not present, was sent for to appear; and in the
mean time Mr. Lockerson, who being deposed before Garnet, delivered upon his
Oath, that they heard Garnet say to Hall, They will charge me with my Prayer
for the good success of the great Action, in the beginning of the Parliament,
and with the Verses which I added in the end of my Prayer, "Gentem auferte
perfidam
"Credentium de finibus,
"Ut Christo lauds debitas.
"Persolvamus alacriter.


It is true indeed (said Garnet) that I prayed for the good success of that
great Action; but I will tell them, that I meant it in respect of some sharper
Laws, which I feared they would then make against Catholics: And that Answer
shall serve well enough.

Here Garnet replied, That for the two Gentlemen that heard the Interlocution,
he would not charge them with Perjury, because he knew them to be honest men;
yet he thought they did mistake some things, though in the substantial parts he
confessed, he could not deny their relation. And for the main Plot, he
confessed, that he was therewithal acquainted by Greenwell particularly, and
that Greenwell came perplexed unto him to open something, which Mr. Catesby
with diverse others intended: To whom he said, He was contented to hear by him
what it was, so^ as he would not be a^known to Mr. Catesby, or to any other,
that he was mad^ privy to it. Whereupon Father Greenwell told him the whole
Plot, and all the particulars thereof, with which he protested that he was very
much distempered, and could never sleep quietly afterward, but sometimes
prayed to God that it should not take effect.

To that the Earl of Salisbury replied, That Earl of Salisbury.
he should do well to speak clearly of his devotion in that point; for
otherwise he must put him in remembrance, that he had confessed to the Lords,
That he had offered Sacrifice to God for stay of that Plot, unless it were for
the good of the Catholic Cause; and in no other fashion (said his Lordship)
was this State beholding to you for your Masses and Oblations. Adding thus much
further, That he wondered why he would not write to his Superior Aquaviva, as
well of this particular Powder Treason, as to procure prohibition for other
smaller matters.

Garnet faintly answered, He might not disclose it to any, because it was
matter of secret Garnet.
Confession, and would endanger the life of diverse men.

Whereunto the Earl of Northampton replied, That that matter of Confession,
which Earl of Northam.
before he refused to confess, because he would save lives, he confessed it now
to endanger his own life; and therefore his former Answer was idle and
frivolous.

Then Garnet told the Lords, That he commanded Greenwell to dissuade Catesby,
which Garnet
he thought he did; and if Catesby had come to him upon Allhallow-day, he
thought he could so far have ruled him, as he would have been persuaded to
desist.

Then said the Earl of Salisbury, Why did you refuse to hear Catesby tell you
all the particulars, Earl of Salisbury.
when he would have told you, if you had been desirous to prevent it?

Garnet replied, That after Greenwell had told him what it was which Catesby
intended, Garnet.
and that he called to mind what Catesby said to him, at his first breaking
with him in general terms, his Soul was so troubled with mislike of that
particular, as he was loath to hear any more of it.

Well then (said the Earl of Salisbury) you see his heart. And then turning to
the Lords Commissioners, Earl of Salisbury.
he desired leave of them, that he might use some speech concerning the
proceeding of the State in this great cause, from the first beginning until
that hour; and so began to this effect, That although the Evidence had been so
well distributed and opened by Mr. Attorney, as he had never heard such a mass
of matter better contracted, nor made more intelligible to the Jury, to whom it
was not his part to speak, nor his purpose to meddle with Mr. Garnet in
Divinity, or in the Doctrine of Aequivocation, in which latter he saw how he
had played his Master-prise: yet because he had been particularly used in this
service with other of the Lords Commissioners, by whom, nothing was more
desired, next the glory of God, than to demonstrate to the world with that
sincerity and moderation his Majesty's Justice was carried in all points, he
would be bold to say somewhat of the manner of this Arraignment, and of the
place where it was appointed. For the first, he said, That seeing there was
nothing to which this State might more attribute the infinite goodness and
blessings of God, than to the protection of the true Religion, which had
groaned so long under the bitter persecutions of men of his profession; he
confessed, that he held himself greatly honored to be an Assistant amongst so
many great Lords, at the Seat of Justice, where Gods Cause should receive so
much honor, by discrediting the person of Garnet, on whom the common Adversary
had thought to confer the usurpation of such an eminent Jurisdiction: For
otherwise, who did not know, that the quality of poor Henry Garnet might have
undergone a more ordinary form of Trial, and happily in some other place of
less note and observation? And so his Lordship took an occasion to declare,
That the City of London was so dear to the King, and his Majesty so desirous to
give it all honor and comfort, as when this opportunity was put into his
hands, whereby there might be made so visible an Anatomy of Popish Doctrine,
from whence these Treasons have their source and support, he thought he could
not choose a fitter Stage than the City of London, which was not only rightly
termed, The Chamber of his Empire, but was by his Majesty esteemed as his
greatest and safest Treasury, who accounts no Riches comparable to his
Subjects Hearts; and acknowledges, That such a Circuit did never contain so
many faithful Subjects within the Walls: a matter well appearing to his own
eyes amongst others, upon the decease of the late Queen of precious memory,
when he attending most of the Peers and Privy Counselors of this Kingdom, who
were accompanied with no small number of Noble and Faithful Gentlemen, had seen
them all stayed from entry within the Gates of this City, until they had
publicly declared with one voice, That they would live and die with the King
our Sovereign Lord. To you therefore, Mr. Garnet, (said the Earl of Salisbury)
must I address my self, as the man in whom it appears best what horrible
Treasons have been covered under the Mantle of Religion, which heretofore had
been Petty-Treason for a Protestant to have affirmed: such has been the
iniquity of false tongues, who have always sought to prove the Truth a liar: of
which impudent calumnies the State is so tender, as you do best know (Mr.
Garnet) that since your apprehension even till this day, you have been as
Christianly, as courteously, and as carefully used, as ever man could be, of
any quality, or any profession: Yea, it may truly be said, that you have been
as well attended for health or otherwise, as a Nurse-child. Is it true or no,
said the Earl?

It is most true, my Lord (said Garnet) I confess Garnet.
it.

Well then (said the Earl) if your strange Doctrine of Equivocation be
observed, and your Earl of Salisbury.
hardiness of heart to deny all things; let it not be forgotten, that this
Interlocution of yours with Hall, overheard by others, appears to be Digitus
Dei; for thereby had the Lords some light and proof of matter against you,
which must have been discovered otherwise by violence and coertion, a matter
ordinary in other Kingdoms, though now for born here; but it is better as it is
for the Honor of the State, for so were your own words, that you thought it
best to tell the truth at last, when you saw you were confounded Tanta nube
testium. In which I protest, that I do confidently assure my self, that you
would as easily have confessed your self to be Author of all the Action, as the
Concealer, but that his Majesty, and my Lords, were well contented to draw all
from you without Racking, or any such bitter torments. Then speaking to Garnet,
he said, I pray you, Mr. Garnet, what encouraged Catesby that he might proceed,
but your resolving him in the first Proposition? What warranted Fawks, but but
Catesby's Explication of Garnet's Arguments? as appears infallibly by Winter's
Confession, and by Fawkes, that they knew the point had been resolved to Mr.
Catesby, by the best Authority.

Then Garnet answered, That Mr. Catesby was to blame to make such application.
Garnet.


To that the Earl replied, That he must needs be bold with him, to drive him
from the Earl of Salisbury.
trust he had, to satisfy the world by his denials, by putting him in mind,
how after the Interlocution betwixt him and Hall, when he was called before all
the Lords, and was asked, not what he said, but whether Hall and he had
conference together, desiring him not to equivocate; how stiffly he denied it
upon his Soul, reiterating it with so many detestable execrations, as the Earl
said, it wounded their hearts to hear him; and yet as soon as Hall had
confessed it, he grew ashamed, crying the Lords mercy, and said, he had
offended, if Equivocation did not help him.

To this Garnet answered, That when one is Garnet.
asked a question before a Magistrate, he was not bound to answer before some
Witnesses he produced against him, Quia nemo tenetur prodere seipsum. Then
Garnet falling into some professions of his well-wishing to his Majesty, and
being put in mind of the answer he had made concerning the Excommunication of
Kings, wherein he referred himself to the Canon of Nos Sanctorum, he answered,
That his Majesty was not yet Excommunicated.

Then the Earl of Salisbury bad him deal Earl of Salisbury.
plainly, for now was the time, Whether in case the Pope, per sententiam
Orthodoxam, should Excommunicate the Kings Majesty of Great Britain, his
Subjects were bound to continue their obedience?

To this he denied to answer, by which the hearers might see his mind.

From that matter he began to make request, that where he had confessed the
receiving of two Brieves or Bulls from the Pope, in the Queens time, by which
all Catholics were forbidden to adhere to any Successor that was not obedient
to the Church of Rome; his Majesty would be pleased to make a favorable
interpretation, because he had showed them to very few Catholics in England,
in the Queens time; and when he understood that the Pope had changed his mind,
then he burnt the Bulls.

To that it was said, That belike the Pope changed his mind, when the King was
so safely possessed of his Estate, and Garnet with his Accomplices began to
feel their own impiety; and so, as Catesby said to Percy, did resolve roundly
of that Treason, which would speed all at once.

Then Garnet began to use some speeches, that he was not consenting to the
Powder Treason. Garnet.


Whereupon the Earl of Salisbury said, Earl of Salisbury.
Mr. Garnet, give me but one Argument that you were not consenting to it, that
can hold in any indifferent man's ear or sense, besides your bare Negative. But
Garnet replied not.

Then Mr. Attorney General spoke in Answer Mr. Attor.
of Garnet more particularly to this effect. 1. For Equivocation, it is true
indeed, that they do outwardly to the world condemn lying and perjury, because
the contrary were too palpable, and would make them odious to all men: But it
is open and broad lying and forswearing, not secret and close lying and
perjury, or swearing a falsehood which is most abominable, and without defense
or example. And if they allow it not generally in others, yet at least in
themselves, their confederates and associates in treasonable practices, they
will both warrant and defend it, especially when it may serve their turn, for
such purposes and ends as they look after. 2. Concerning the usurped power of
the Pope in deposing of Princes, neither is it the general Doctrine of the
Church, as he falsely said, neither allowed or tolerated by all Princes, who are
otherwise of their Religion, as may appear out of the French discourse written
to the French King against the re-admitting of the Jesuitical Faction. And
whereas he would pick a thank, in seeming to spare and exempt King James our
Sovereign; it is not possible to avoid their distinction of being
Excommunicated de jure, if not de facto; howsoever if it be true also, that the
Pope does, de facto, every year once curse all Heretics. For Recusants not
going to Church, the example of the Catholics not joining in service and
prayer with the Arrians, who denied a main Article of the Christian Creed, does
no ways hold, neither can it agree to us, of whom no such impious blasphemy can
be showed or imagined. That Garnet said, He knew some, who, before the Bull
came, went not to Church, it may be true perhaps in some one or two perverted
and perverse men like himself: But whereas he produced the Council of Trent, as
if there the matter had been determined, and thereupon infers, that after
that all Romish Catholics refused to meet with us at Church in time of prayer,
it is a gross error; for the last Session of that Council was in the year of
our Lord 1563, which was in the fifth year of Queen Elizabeth; whereas I
showed, and am able to justify and prove, That their Romish English Catholics
came to our Service in our Churches until the nineteenth year of her Majesty,
which was many years after that Council was ended.

Concerning Garnet himself: First, for that answer of his, that he knew of the
Powder Treason by Confession; it is true which before was spoken, that such
Acts as this is, Non laudantur nisi peracta, are then only commended when they
are performed; but otherwise, first, Greenwel's was no Sacramental Confession,
for that the Confitent was not Penitent: nay, himself has clearly delivered
under his hand, That the Powder Treason was told him, not as a fault, but by
way of consultation and advice. 2. It was a future thing to be done, and not
already then executed. 3. Greenwel told it not of himself that he should do it,
but of Fawkes, P^y, Catesby, Winter, and others; and therefore he ought to have
discovered them, for that they were no Confitents. 4. He might and ought to
have discovered the mischief, for preservation of the State, though he had
concealed the persons. 5. Catesby told it unto him extra confessionem, out of
Confession, saying, They might as w^ll turn him out, as have kept him out.
Lastly, by the Common Law, howsoever it were (it being crimen laesae
Majestatis) he ought to have disclosed it. Now for that Garnet denied, that he
was a principal Author and Procurer of this Treason, but only that he had
received knowledge thereof; the contrary is clear and manifest, both out of his
own Confessions, by himself acknowledged, and apparently proved, in that he
resolved Catesby concerning the lawfulness and merit thereof, and that he
prayed for the good success of the Powder Treason, which is more than either
consultation or consent. Besides, he must remember him of the old Versicle, Qui
non prohibet quod prohibere potest, consentire videtur. Garnet might have
commanded Greenwell that told him of the Powder Treason, to have desisted, but
did not: but Greenwell went still on with the Treason, and when it was
disclosed, went into the Country to move Rebellion, which doubtless he would
never have done, if Garnet had forbidden him: therefore he said, he might say
with the Orator Tully, Cui adsunt testimonia rerum, quid opus est verbis?
Moreover Mr. Attorney added, how Garnet writ first for Thomas Winter, then for
Kit Wright, after that for Guy Fawkes, then for Sir Edward Bainham, and
afterward for Catesby for a Regiment of Horse; and that Garnet was for the
Infanta, and by his Breeves intended to keep out the King, except he should
tolerate and swear to maintain the Romish Religion. Then Mr. Attorney spoke of
the Interlocution betwixt Garnet and Hall, and said, That in all their speeches
they never named God, nor confessed their innocence; but as soon as they spoke
together, Hall spoke first, and then Garnet said, He suspected one, whose name,
they that were set to over-hear them, could not hear, to have disclosed
something against them. But it may be otherwise, for he said he was much
subject to that frailty of suspicion. He said, He received a Note from
Rookwood, that Greenwell was gone over-Seas; and another, that Gerard was gone
to father Parsons, and that Mistress Anne was in Town (meaning Mrs. Anne Vaux)
and many other things were by them uttered in that conference.

By this time came in Mr. Forset, who being deposed, affirmed likewise, that
their examination, and the matter therein contained were true; saying further,
that both of them took notes of that which they heard of Garnet and Hall, as
near as possibly they could, and set down nothing in their examinations, but
those things, wherein both their notes, and perfect memories agreed and
assented, and that many things that were very material; and of great moment,
were left out of their examinations, because both their notes and memories did
not perfectly agree therein.

And now one of the Letters, which were written with sack, washewed to the
Court, by which appeared that Hall and Garnet had interlocution together. Mr.
Attorney here inferred that the necessary end of Justice was, vt poena ad
paucos, metus ad omnes perveniat, and urged the examination of Garnet, wherein
he confessed that when Tesmond alias Greenwell, made relation to him of the
great blow by the Powder Treason, who should have the protection, Greenwell
said, the Lords that should be left alive should choose a Protector. And
further Mr. Attorney urged the writing of another Letter written with sack to
Sayer, alias Rockwood, a Priest in the Gate House; But of this point much is
formerly mentioned.

Here Mr. Attorney ending, my Lord of Northampt. spoke to the Prisoner this
speech following.

THough no man alive can be less apt or willing Earl of North.
than my self, to add the least grain or scurple of improvement to the weight
of any man's calamity, that groans under the heavy burden of a distressed
state, Vel gravatis addere gravamina, whereof I have as many witnesses as the
world has eyes: yet as the case stands now in this trial, Mr. Garnet, between
my dear Sovereign, ex cuius spiritu, as one of Alexander said, nos omnes
spiritum ducimus, and you that were so well content to let the course of
conspiracy run forward to the stopping of this breath before the time, which
God by nature does prescribe between his honor, and your error, his just
proceedings and your painted shows, his sincerity and your hypocricy; I could
wish it possible that in a person of some other quality, you might hear the
Echoes of your unperfect and weak answers, and thereupon judge more
indifferently and evenly of the true state of your cause than you have done
hitherto, being distracted with fear, or forestalled by prejudice, or, to
borrow your own phrase, which is more proper to the point than any I can use,
oppressed tanta nube testium, with so thick a cloud of witnesses, as concur
with one voice, heart and spirit, for the conviction of your audacity.

I confess that never any man in your state gave less hold or advantage to
examiners, than you have done in the whole course of proceeding, to us that
were in Commission: sometime by forswearing, as upon the confession of Hall
your fellow: sometime by dissembling, as about the places of your Rendezvous,
which was the lapwings neast: sometimes by earnest expostulation: sometime by
artificial Equivocation: sometime by Sophisticating true substances: sometime
by adding false qualities: yet sat superest, as may appear, to the defeat of
your inventions, and the defense of the Kings Majesty, quia magna est veritas,
and praevalet.

Your parts by nature simply considered, and in another person, would rather
move compassion, than exasperate humanity: for whom would not the ruin of such
a person touch, as is in appearance temperate, and in understanding ripe? But
our end at this time is the same with Decius in Livie, ut quem vos obrutum
reliquistis, ignem etc. that we may quench that fire by prevention, which you
have only raked up in ashes, ut novum daret incendium, that it might cause a
new combustion so soon as it might hit upon matter that were fit and suitable.
Wherefore I must rather draw your answers to the true touch for discharge of
rumors, than verberare aerem, beat the air: For the substance of all your
evasions and sly shifts, is as the Innkeepers of Chalcis confessed of his
dishes to his guests, admiring tantam fer^ulorum diversitatem, that they were
only compounded of pork, howsoever your fine cookery may vary them.

The two Bulls that in the late Queens time entered the land (with a purpose by
their loud lowing to call all their calves together, for the making of a stong
party, at the shutting up of the evening against our dead Sovereign) were
grased in your pastures, Mr. Garnet, or to speak more properly (because they
durst neither endure the light, nor admit the air) they were staul-fed at your
crib, as your self confess, and therefore, Serve nequam, ex ore tuo te judico.
And what answer make you to this? mary that the purpose was imparted to very
few: so much the worse: For out of publication grows discovery; and yet
experience has justified, that those very few were the very souls and spirits
of that pack of Conspirators, and such as for want of patience and temperance
to tarry the time, when the game had been brought to bearing, should have played
the chiefest parts in the late smoking Tragedy. You say the Bulls were after
sacrificed in the fire by your self. But not before the Kings good Angel had
cut their throats, and the best part of their proof were past, and your hopes
dead of that good which in likelihood they should have brought with them. For
to what use could these dumb beasts serve in seeking to prevent that lawful and
undoubted right, which heaven had now proclaimed, and earth acknowledged? But
let the proof be what it will, I look into the root. I wonder Mr. Garnet, what
Apostle warrants you in undertaking wicked Plots, in hope that good may follow;
neglecting what all Laws (and the Laws of England above all) what all States
and Nations conclude of men, that slily practice, and combine for anticipation
of the future rights of lawful Successors.

In excuse of Letters written with your own hand by Thomas Winter to father
Creswell, when he was employed about the procurement of an Army to Invade, with
supplies of Treasure proportionable for the quicker execution of so desperate an
Enterprise, you answer, that the Persons were commended in your Letters, not
the Plot: spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici? as though the minister had
any other errand or instruction, than the main Plot it self: as though you, Mr.
Garnet; being then Magister in Israel, and Rector chori, could or would be
ignorant of their prefixed end; as though so grave a Person as your self, were
likely to set his hand to Blancks like a baby, and to leave the rest to the
disposition of a man wholly transported with fiery humors: Or as though in this
very point other men's confession in particular, beside your own in generality,
had not left us marks and traces evident and plain enough to descry doubleness
with diversity. You confess privity to a practice, but not for an Army:
foreknowledge of a course for getting Treasure, but with a purpose, as you
conceived, to employ it wholly for the relief of Catholics. So as the reason
of the reservedness of Catesby, Winter and the rest toward you, must be
undoubtedly their suspicion of your over great affection and duty to the Queen;
For otherwise it is certain they would have trusted you as well with their
intention, as with their means: with their hopes, as with their instruments:
especially considering how hard it was for them to compass their own vast
desires, without help both of your credit, and of your industry.

Wright was in like manner, and with like expedition commended by you afterward
for the quickening of Winters project, if any life were in it, upon the
slacking of the passions of Spain, with the propositions of peace, that no time
might be lost, no stone left unremoved, that might give a knock to the peace of
our policy: your head wrought upon all offers, your hand walked in all Regions,
your spirit steered all attempts and undertakings: and yet if protestations,
qualified and protected by Equivocations, may carry weight; all this while your
mind was, as good pastors to be, patient, your thoughts were obedient, and your
counsels innocent. But now to search your cunning somewhat nearer to the quick,
we must observe, that when your hopes of Invasion began to cool by likelihood
of peace, your desires of supplies by the cold answers that came from Spain,
your expectation of new mischief to be wrought at home without Complots abroad:
when malice it self was cast into so desperate a swoun, as neither Rosa solis
when Spain relented, nor Iscobah when Tyrone submitted, nor dissension within
the Kingdom when discontentments ended, could put it by any fresh adventure
into life, when you for your own part, Mr. Garnet, having bin once washed and
regenerated in the fountain of the Kings free Pardon, from the leprous spots of
former Treasons, were determined to begin upon another stock, and return as a
dog to the vomit (though washing can avail no man (as the Preacher warns) that
iterum tangit mortuum, touches the dead the second or third time after he has
been made clean:) for secretly Catesby resorts to you, as Mahomet might to
Sergius, (for now I speak according to the matter, and not the men) to enquire
whether it were lawful, considering the necessiity of the time, to undertake an
enterprise, for the advancement of the Catholic Religion, though it were
likely that among many that were nocent, some should perish that were innocent.
A man that is Religious in any kind, or but morally honest in his own kind,
would expect that a Priest, a Jesuit, (which title does imply salvation, and
not destruction, nay, the Superior of English Jesuits) upon this rash demand,
should have resorted for a safe resolution to Gods own Book, where he should
have found, that God was pleased to withdraw his wrathful hand from Sodom, so
as there had been only december justi, ten justmen within that Town, and for their
sakes; that the wise householder in St. Matthew, marking how hard it would be,
when the corn was ripe, to make separation, gave order to his servants to
abstain from plucking up the tares, ne simul eradicarent triticum, least
withal they plucked up the wheat by the Roots. Ye should have found in the
stories of the Church, that the godly Bishops in the first spring of Religion,
suspended process against the Priscillian Heretics, ne Catholici cum illis
perirent, least the Catholics might also perish with them. And the Church of
Millain taxed Theodosius the Emperor, quod insontes una cum sontibus
trucidasset, that he had proceeded both against the guilty, and the guiltless
with one stroke, and with one measure of severity. But far beside the Holy
writ, or holy presedents, your answer, Mr. Garnet, was such, as I both abhor to
think, and quake to utter, that if any great advantage were to grow to the
Church this way, they might destroy them all.

Tantae ne animis coelestibus irae? O Mr. Garnet, be not offended though I ask
of you, as a worthy Emperor did once of a Traitor, in a case by many degrees
inferior to this, Quid facit in pectore humano lupi feritas, canis rabies,
serpentis venenum? But that which ought most to torture and afflict the spirit
(if you be the child of him, whose Name and Badge you bear) is, that your
Doctrine was confidently delivered, and so speedily digested, and converted to
nutriment from such a mouth as yours, considering that (according to the
Prophet) knowledge should depend upon the lips of the Priest, as Rookwood,
Bates and others, that did shrink at the horror of the Project when it was
first laid down, received satisfaction upon the very sound of your assent,
though masked with the title of a man as grave and learned, as any in the land.
And Catesby doubting of the fickleness of men's affections, in cases that
concern the soul, used your admittance as a charm or spell, to keep quick
spirits within the circle of combined faith, which otherwise perhaps when Hell
brake loose, would have sought liberty. Your Charter only (whereupon I beseech
you for your own souls health, to meditate for the time you tarry in this
world) was the Base whereon some grounded their bad conscience in proceeding
with this Plot, not only to the destruction of their bodies, but to the peril
of their souls, without sound and true repentance, which by the merit of
Christ's passion, will serve in quacunque hora peccator ingemuerit. For though
Christ were joyful that he had not lost one of those whom his father gave him
in charge, and came to save, and not to destroy; yet your advise was to destroy
them all: Such was your burning charity.

Some man surprised with a question upon the sudden, might answer sharply and
shrewdly at some time, I confess, without thinking or intending ill: But this
man, Mr. Garnet, cannot be you, that having confessed clearly under your own h^
(...) suspicion and fear of some ^sch^ (...) and intended in their hearts, by
t^ (...) of Nocents and Innoce^ts and (...) ^uod dubitas ne feceris. It seems
the heart of Catesby was a fertile soil for sprowting of stinking weeds
hastily, into which the seed of your securing confidence was cast. For the
Powder Plot which in January was barley embryo, became formatus foetus in the
March next following, it quickened the next December, when the Pioneers began
to dig in the thick wall: Catesby not long after imparted his conceit secretly
to you, of the great likelihood he foresaw of a lucky time of birth, and
thereupon was Guy Fawks sent over by your knowledge and encouragement, to deal
with Sir William Stanley, about the drawing down of Forces somewhat nearer to
the Sea side for speedy transport, which if need were, might carry torches at
the solemnity. But what is your answer to this employment of Guy Fawks?
Forsooth that your purpsoe was only, to commend him as a Soldier, but not as a
Conspirator. O unlucky Treason, that comes to be excused by so poor an
Advocate! when Fawks himself meant nothing else than to be a Soldier, having
so strange a part to play soon after in the Powder-train, but used this retreat
as a color to disguise the secret purpose that did only tarry time, and to
eschew those watchful eyes, that nearer hand would have observed both his
inlets and his outlets in that place more narrowly. The point is clear, the
confessions are direct, the purpose is palpable. All the lines of your level
are drawn to the center of the Powder-mine. All Letters are either drawn or
enterlined manu Scorpionis, to use the word of Hierome; and yet under pain of
censure we must believe, that all this while you were in charity, because all
this while (which it grieves me to remember) you were not afraid to communicate.

But now to weigh your Answers that concern the Powder Plot it self, which is
paramount in respect of the Longitude and Latitude to all that have been, or
shall ever be: Your self cannot deny, Mr. Garnet, that Green-wel's overture, as
you say in Confession, coming after the notice which you took of Catesbies
question about Innocents, was but a fruit of your own Doctrine, an effect of
your own instruction, and a conclusion drawn wholly out of your own
propositions and principles. Now when we press to know what reason drew you to
the concealment of a Project so pernicious both to Prince and State, without
revealing it either to the King himself, tanquam praecellenti, to use St.
Peter's term, or to his Ministers subordinate; you start to the shift of
Confession for a formal help, which comes too short in respect of Catesby's
first discovery, which your own words aver plainly to have wrought with you. I
will not argue in this place what course a Confessor should take, or how far he
ought to strain for the securing of a Princes life, that otherwise is sure to
perish by the rage and ignorance invincible of a base Villain, (whose life
answers not in value the least hair of a Princes head) because time suffers
not: But I am sure, that for a matter of less weight than this, and a crime of
less importance than the life both of Prince and State, Confession received a
deep wound for a long time, more than a thousand years past, in the Church of
Constantinople. For God forbid that matters of such weight should hang by such
feeble threeds. But to this excuse of tenderness in the point of Confession, I
would answer by making a great doubt, Whether this course of conference were a
Confession or not: for against your bare words, which Equivocation supports, I
object some likelihood, That since you kneeled sometimes, and sometimes walked
up and down; since matter of conspiracy were interlaced with matter of
Confession, not for ease of conscience, as should appear, but for advice in
execution; since Greenwel was absolved instantly, which excludes the shift of
reference; and Greenwel should be found to lie to the holy Ghost, in case this
were a true Confession, in promising (Mr. Garnet) as you say, to dissuade the
project, which he prosecuted even to the last point, as is evident: and after
the Powder Camp brake up, I conclude, that though this discovery were by
confession, yet it was no Supersedeas to your former knowledge from Catesby,
your trusty friend: and if it were none, then it can be no protection for faith
putrified. What need we seek light through cobweb-lawns, when the drift of your
whole device in seeking to conclude from one what you learned of another, and
from all what you affected and abetted in your heart, does evidently prove your
counsels to have been carried along with such a temper of reservedness, as
whenever mischief should be brought to light, the world might rather wonder
at your caution, than commend your fidelity.

By shaping such weak answers to demonstrations so manifest, you must either
work by the Ring of Giges, in making your audacity and presumption invisible;
or hold a very weak conceit of our capacities, in supposing that they can be
either dazzled or deluded by such poor Sophistry. For though you pretend to have
received a deep wound in Conscience at the first revealing of the plot, to have
lost your sleep with vexation of spirit, to have offered and prayed to God for
his preventing grace, to have required Greenwel's help and furtherance in
crossing and diverting the design; yet all this while you suffered the project
to proceed, you helped and assisted their endeavors that were laborers, you
wrote earnestly Letters both to Baldwin and to Creswel for their furtherance of
ordinary means, you gave order for a prayer to be said by Catholics for their
prosperous success, you kept measure with the two first dimensions of Friar
Bacon's Brazen Head, Time is, Time was, till (thanks be to God) the third time
was past; you had ever an ear open to listen for the crack, and were in the
same agony for the Powder Plot, that Charles the Fifth was for the Popes
duress, giving order in all his Dominions, that Prayers should be made for his
release, when in the mean time he kept and held him in his own hand prisoner:
the least word of your mouth, or labor of your pen, might have secured both
Prince and State; while you pretend to have broken both your sleeps and your
brains, and that with a greater advantage to the cause which you would advance,
than can ever grow by combustion and conspiracy. But your tenderness herein was
suitable with another dutiful desire of yours to dissuade Catesby from the
Plot, at his coming into Warwickshire, who never meant to come thither, but as
to the Rendezvous when the Parliament had been blown up, and the storm had been
blown over. It may be that your mind was perplexed and disquieted upon the
meditation of strange events, for so was the mind of Cain, Achitophel, and
Judas that betrayed his Master: the reason is very pregnant in the Word of God
it self, that cum sit timidia nequitia, dat testimonium condemnationis, since
wickedness is cowardly and timorous, it gives evidence of condemnation against
it self: Et semper praesumit saeva perturbata conscientia; but Satan
prevailing, his Angels execute.

I will now conclude this address to you, Mr. Garnet, by observing some special
points, how strangely and preposterously the Devil, in this last project of
Powder, has altered his old properties. For the curse that God laid upon the
Serpent, after the first transgression, was, Ut gradiretur super pectus suum,
to creep upon his breast; but now we find him mounted upon the wings of an
Espray, to the highest Region of the Air, and among the Fireworks. The other
part of his curse was, that he should eat Pulverem, that is, dust or powder:
But now since Sodom was destroyed by Sulphur, and the Wife of Lot transmuted
into Salt, the proper materials of that mean by which Satan wrought in this hot
fire, it appears that the Serpent from eating powder (which was a plain devise)
fell, for a worse purpose, to snuff Gunpowder. Then the Serpent did insidiari
calcaneo, now capiti, from which the body draws both sense sense and
influence. Then he began to Eve with a modest question, Cur praecepit Deus, Why
has God commanded? now with a resolution, Praecepit Deus, God has commanded.
His words in those carried a flourish of great comfort, Nequaquam moriemini;
but now terror, Moriemini, for a great advantage destroy them all. The Devil at
that time did only nibble about the Text of holy Writ, tanquam mus ponticus,
as Tertullian terms Martian; but now he draws the grounds of Equivocation
concerning Princes lives: Out of the very Scripture, and by Scholastical
Authority, Satan tempted Christ with a fair offer, Dandi omnia, of giving all
upon the top of the Pinnacle: But now he sets upon the great Lieutenant of Gods
Authority and Dignity, with an auferam tibi omnia, both Life and Crown, ex
penetralibus ubi Christus non est, as we are taught by his Evangelist. The
Dragons ambition extended no further, than the sweeping away with his tail of
the third part of the Stars in the Firmament: But now the plot of him and his
Disciples was, to sweep away the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, both out of
Star Chamber and Parliament, that no light be given in this Kingdom to the best
Laborers. In the time of Saul, the Devil was so modest as to suspend his
Illusions and Oracles, till the Visions of the Prophets began to cease: But now
though we have both Moses and the Prophets, and firmiorem sermonem propheticum,
yet he ruffles among the robes, and inaudita fundit oracula. In the beginning
of the Christian Church, the very name of Christ was sufficient to make Satan
pack, and to quit the possession of tormented men; but he has learned a more
cunning trick of late, under the banner of Christ, to fight against the
Lieutenants of his Imperial Majesty. In one point I find no change, that is, in
laboring and working by all means, to draw men from their trust in Gods
direction, to a tickle kind of confidence in themselves, and their own weak
knowledge of good and ill. And as that error was the cause of Adams exile from
Paradise, which was hortus conclusus; so had such another almost divided us and
our heirs both from our lives and Estates, Et penitus toto divisos orb
Britannos.

I have stood the longer on this point, to let you know how idly, and yet how
wilfully you strive against both the Providence of God, and the Justice of the
Land; Quae tuo te jugulavit gladio. The more you labor to get out of the Wood,
having once lost the right way, the further you creep in. For the wisdom of the
world is folly before God; and unpossible it is, that those counsels or
proceedings should either have good proof in this world, or reward in the next,
that are embrued with blood, and pursued with tyranny. If then there be no
other way to Heaven than by the destruction of Gods Anointed and their Heirs,
I will conclude with you, Mr. Garnet, as Constantius did with Ascesius, Erigito
tibi scalam, and in coelum solus ascendito; set up a Ladder for your self, and
climb up to Heaven alone, for Loyal minds will not suit themselves with such
bad company. The worst I wish to your person standing now to be convicted at
the Bar, is remorse and repentance, for the safeguard of your Soul; and for the
rest, Fiat justitia, currat lex, and vincat Veritas.

Hereunto Garnet said, That he had done more Garnet.
than he could excuse, and he had dealt plainly with them; but he was bound to
keep the secrets of Confessions, and to disclose nothing that he heard in
Sacramental Confession.

Whereupon the Earl of Nottingham asked him, if one confessed this day to him,
that to morrow Earl of Notting*
morning he meant to kill the King with a dagger, if he must conceal it?

Whereunto Garnet answered, That he must conceal it. Garnet.


Then the Earl of Salisbury desired liberty of him to ask him some questions of
the nature of Earl of Salisbury.
Confessions.

Garnet said, His Lordship might, and he Garnet.
would answer him as well as he could.

Why then (said he) must there not be Earl of Salisbury*
Confession and Contrition before Absolution?

Yes, (said Garnet.) Garnet.


Then he demanded, Whether Greenwel were Earl of Salisbury.
absolved by him or no?

Garnet said, He was. Garnet.


The Earl then asked him, What Greenwel had done, to show that he was sorry for
it, and Earl of Salisbury.
whether he did promise to desist?

Garnet answered, that Greenwel said, He would do his best. Garnet.


To that the Earl replied, That it could not be so; for as soon as Catesby and
Percy were Earl of Salisbury.
in Arms, Greenwel came to them from Garnet, and so went from them to Hall at
Mr. Abington's house, inviting them most earnestly to come and assist those
Gentlemen in that action. Hereby (says he) it appears, that either Greenwel
told you out of Confession, and then there needs no secrecy; or if it were in
Confession, he professed no penitency, and therefore you could not absolve him.
To which the Earl added, That this one circumstance must still be remembered,
and cannot be cleared, That when Greenwel told you what Catesby meant in
particular, and you then called to mind also what Catesby had spoken to you in
the general before, if you had not been so desirous to have the Plot take
effect, you might have disclosed it out of your general knowledge from Catesby:
but when Catesby offered to deliver you the particulars himself, as he had done
to Greenwel, you refused to hear him, lest your tongue should have betrayed
your heart.

To this Garnet weakly replied, That he did what he could to dissuade it, and
went into Garnet.
Warwickshire with a purpose to dissuade Mr. Catesby, when he should have come
down. And for Mr. Greenwel' s going to Father Hall, to persuade him to join,
Garnet said, he did very ill in so doing.

To that the Earl of Salisbury replied, That Earl of Salisbury.
his first answer was most absurd, seeing he knew Catesby would not come down
till the 6th. of November, which was the day after the blow should have been
given; and Garnet went into the Country ten days before. And for the second,
he said, That he was only glad, that the world might now see, that Jesuits
were condemned by Jesuits; and Treason and Traitors laid naked by the Traitors
themselves; yea, Jesuits by that Jesuit, that governs all Jesuits here, and
without whom, no Jesuit in England can do any thing.

Garnet (as it should seem) being here mightily touched with remorse of his
offense, prayed God Garnet.
and the King, that other Catholics might not fare the worse for his sake.

Then the Earl of Salisbury said, Mr. Garnet, Earl of Salisbury.
is it not a lamentable thing, that if the Pope, or Claudius Aquaviva, or your
self, command poor Catholics any thing, that they must obey you, though it be
to endanger both body and soul? And if you maintain such Doctrine amongst you,
how can the King be safe? Is it not time therefore the King and the State
should look to you, that spend your time thus in his Kingdom?

Garnet said very passionately, My Lord, I would to God I had never known of
the Powder Treason. Garnet.


Hereupon the Lord Chief Justice of England said, Garnet, you are Superior of
the Jesuits; Lord Chief Just.
and if you forbid, must not the rest obey? Was not Greenwel with you half an
hour at Sir Everard Digby's house, when you heard of the discovery of your
Treason? and did you not there confer and debate the matter together? Did you
not send him to Hall, to Mr. Abington's house, to stir him up to go to the
Rebels, and encourage them? Yet you seek to color all this, but that is but a
mere shift in you; and notwithstanding all this you said, No man living but one
did know that you were privy to it; then belike some that are dead did know it.
Catesby was never from you, (as the Gentlewoman that kept your house with you
confessed) and by many apparent proofs, and evident presumptions, you were in
every particular of this action, and directed and commanded the Actors; nay, I
think verily, you were the chief that moved it.

Garnet said, No, my Lord, I did not.

Then it was exceedingly well urged by my Garnet.
Lord Chief Justice, how he writ his Letters for Winter, Wright, Fawkes,
Baynham, and Catesby, principal Actors in this matchless Treason. Besides, his
Lordship told him of his keeping the two Bulls to prejudice the King, and to do
other mischief in the Realm; which, when he saw the King peaceably to come in,
then being out of hope to do any good, he burnt them.

Here Mr. Attorney caused to be read the Confession of Hall, alias Oldcorn the
Jesuit, under his own hand, (which, he said, was Omni exceptione majus) against
him, wherein he confessed, That Humfrey Littleton told him, That Catesby and
others were sore hurt with Powder, and said that he was exceeding sorry that
things took no better effect; whereat Hall wished him not to be discouraged,
nor to measure the cause by the event: For though the xi. Tribes of Israel went
twice by the special commandment of God against the Tribe of Benjamin, yet they
both times received the overthrow. So Lewis the French king in his voyage into
the Holy Land against the Infidels, was overthrown, and his whole Army
discomfitted, though his cause were good. And so likewise the Christians when
they defended Rhodes against the Turks, lost the City, and the Turks had the
upper hand. And this he confessed, and applied to the fact of Catesby and
others for the Powder Treason, and said, It would have been commendable when it
had been done, though not before.

After this Mr. Attorney opened, how Francis Tresham, a dilinquent Romanist,
even in articulo mortis (a fearful thing) took it upon his salvation, That he
had not seen Garnet in sixteen years before, when Garnet himself had confessed
he had seen him often within that time: and likewise, that Garnet knew not of
the Spanish Invasion, which Garnet himself confessed also, and which two things
Tresham himself had formerly confessed to the Lords; yet for a recantation of
these two things upon his death bed, he commanded Vavasor his man, (whom I
think (said Mr. Attorney) deeply guilty in this Treason) to write a Letter to
the Earl of Salisbury: And to show this his desperate recantation, Mr. Treshams
Letter was offered to be read.

But before the reading thereof, my Lord of Earl of Salisbury.
Salisbury said, Because there was matter incident to him, and to that which
should be read, he thought fit to say something. To which purpose he said his
desire was, truly to lay open what cause there was for any faith to be given to
these men's protestations, when they, to color their own impieties, and to
slander the Kings Justice, would go about to excuse all Jesuits, how foul
soever, out of an opinion that it is meritorious so to do, at such time as they
had no hope of themselves. Such is it to be doubted that Sir Everard Digbies
protestations might be at the Bar, who sought to clear all Jesuits of those
practices, which they themselves have now confessed ex ore proprio. That such
was also Treshams labor, who being visited with sickness, and his wife in
charity suffered to come to him, this Letter was hatched by them, and signed by
himself some few hours before his death, wherein he takes that upon his
salvation, which shall now by Garnet be disproved.

Then the Letter was read, being to this effect, That whereas since the Kings
time he had had his pardon, and that to satisfy the Lords who heretofore
examined him, he had accused Garnet; that now, he being weak, desired that his
former examinations might be called in, because they were not true: and set
down upon his salvation, that he had not seen Garnet in sixteen years before.

Then my Lord of Salisbury showed and said, Earl of Salisbury.
It was a lamentable thing: for within three hours after he had done this, he
died; and asked Garnet what interpretation he made of this testamental
protestation?

Garnet answered, It may be, my Lord, he Garnet.
meant to Equivocate. Here was the examination and confession of Mrs. Anne Vaux
offered to be read also, to confirm Treshams perjury, who confessed that she
had seen Mr. Tresham with Garnet at her house, three or four times since the
Kings coming in, and diverse times before; and that he had dined with him, and
that Garnet always gave him good counsel, and would say sometimes to him, and
others, Good Gentlemen, be quiet: for we must obtain that which you desire by
prayer. She confessed also, that they were at Erith together the last Summer.

After all this, Garnet being demanded, if these examinations were true, he
affirmed they were. And then were his own examinations likewise read to the
same effect, wherein he both confessed the seeing of Mr. Tresham, and his
sending into Spain about an Invasion.

Here my Lord of Salisbury concluded, That Earl of Salisbury.
that which was said of Mr. Tresham, and others, was not done against charity
to the dead, but upon inevitable necessity, to avoid all their slanderous
reports and practices: for he said, That even now there was current throughout
the Town, a report of a Retractation under Bates his hand, of his accusation of
Greenwel; which are strange and grievous practices to think upon. But this day
shall witness to the world, that all is false, and your self condemned not by
any but by your self, your own confessions and actions. Alas, Mr. Garnet, why
should we be troubled all this day with you, poor man, were it not to make the
cause appear as it deserves? wherein, God send you may be such an example, as
you may be the last Actor in this kind.

Hereupon my Lord Admiral said to Garnet, that he had done more good this day
in that Pulpit which he stood in (for it was made like unto a Pulpit wherein he
stood) than he had done all the days of his life time in any other Pulpit.

Then was another examination of Mrs. Anne Vaux read, wherein she confessed
that Mr. Garnet and she were not long since with Mr. Tresham, at his house in
Northamptonshire, and stayed there.

After this, my Lord of Salisbury said, Mr. Garnet, if you have not yet done, I
would have Earl of Salisbury.
you to understand that the King has commanded, that whatsoever made for you,
or against you, all should be read, and so it is, and we take of you what you
will. This Gentlewoman that seems to speak for you in her confessions, I think
would sacrifice her self for you to do you good, and you likewise for her:
Therefore, good Mr. Garnet, whatsoever you have to say, say on a Gods name, and
you shall be heard.

Then Garnet desired the Jury, that they would allow of, and believe those
things he had denied, Garnet.
and affirmed, and not to give credit unto those things, whereof there was no
direct proof against him, not to condemn him by circumstances or presumptions.

The Earl of Salisbury demanded of him, saying, Mr. Garnet, is this all you
have to say? (...) of Salisbury.
if it be not, take your time, no man shall interrupt you.

To whom Garnet answered, Yea, my Lord. Garnet. Mr. Attur.


Mr. Attorney humbly desired all the Lords Commissioners, that if he had
forgotten to speak of any thing material, that their Lordships would be pleased
to put him in mind of it: Who was assured by my Lord of Salisbury, that he had
done very well, painfully, and learnedly.

Then Mr. Attorney desired the Jury might go together, who upon his motion
going together forth of the Court, within less than a quarter of an hour
returned, and found Henry Garnet guilty.

Whereupon Mr. Sergeant Crook prayed Sergeant Crook.
judgment.

Then Mr. Waterhouse the Clerk of the Mr. Waterhouse.
Crown demanding what he could say for himself, why judgment should not be
given against him?

Garnet made answer, that he could say nothing, Garnet.
but referred himself to the mercy of the King, and God Almighty.

After this, the Earl of Northampton made a Learned Speech, which in it self
was very copious; and the intention being to contract this Volume as much as
might be, and to keep only to matter of Fact, it was thought convenient to
omit the same.

Then the Lord Chief Justice making a pithy preamble of all the apparent proofs

hanged, and quartered.

And my Lord of Salisbury demanded, if Earl of Salisbury.
Garnet would say any thing else?

Garnet answered, No, my Lord. But I humbly desire your Lordships all, to
commend my life Garnet.
to the Kings Majesty, saying, That at his pleasure he was ready either to die
or live, and do him service.

And so the Court arose.

A true Relation of all such things as passed at the Execution of Mr. Garnet,
the Third of May, Anno 1606.
ON the Third of May, Garnet, according to his Judgment, was executed upon a
Scaffold, set up for that purpose, at the West end of St. Paul's Church. At his
arise up the Scaffold, he stood much amazed, (fear and guiltiness appearing in
his face.) The Deans of Paul's and Winchester being present, very gravely and
Christianly exhorted him to a true and lively faith to Godward, a free and
plain acknowledgment to the World of his offense; and if any further Treason
lay in his knowledge, to unburthen his Conscience, and show a sorrow and
detestation of it. But Garnet impatient of persuasions, and ill pleased to be
exhorted by them, desired them not to trouble him; he came prepared, and was
resolved. Then the Recorder of London (who was by his Majesty appointed to be
there) asked Garnet if he had any thing to say unto the people before he died;
it was no time to dissemble, and now his Treasons were too manifest to be
dissembled: therefore if he would, the world should witness, what at last he
censured of himself, and of his fact; it should be free to him to speak what he
listed. But Garnet unwilling to take the offer, said, His voice was low, his
strength gone, the people could not hear him, though he spoke to them; but to
those about him on the Scaffold, he said, The intention was wicked, and the
fact would have been cruel, and from his Soul he should have abhorred it, had
it effected. But he said, He only had a general knowledge of it by Mr.
Catesby, which in that he disclosed not, nor used means to prevent it, herein
he had offended; what he knew in particulars was in Confession, as he said. But
the Recorder wished him to be remembered, That the Kings Majesty had under his
handwriting these four points amongst others:

1. That Greenway told him of this, not as a fault, but as a thing which he had
intelligence of, and told it him by way of consultation.

2. That Catesby and Greenway came together to him to be resolved.

3. That Mr. Tesmond and he had conference of the particulars of the
Powder Treason in Essex long after.

4. Greenway had asked him, who should be the Protector? But Garnet said, That
was to be referred till the blow was past.

These prove your privity besides Confession, and these are extant under your
hand. Garnet answered, Whatsoever was under his hand was true. And for that he
disclosed not to his Majesty the things he knew, he confessed himself justly
condemned, and for this did ask forgiveness of his Majesty. Hereupon the
Recorder led him to the Scaffold to make his Confession public.

Then Garnet said, Good Contrymen, I am come hither this blessed day of The
Invention of the holy Cross, to end all my crosses in this life: The cause of
my suffering is not unknown to you; I confess I have offended the King, and am
sorry for it, so far as I was guilty, which was in concealing it, and for that
I ask pardon of his Majesty. The Treason intended against the King and State
was bloody, my self should have detested it had it taken effect; and I am
heartily sorry, that any Catholics ever had so cruel a design. Then turning
himself from the people to them about him, he made an Apology for Mrs. Ann
Vaux, saying, There is such an honorable Gentlewoman, who has been much
wronged in report; for it is suspected and said, that I should be married to
her, or worse; but I protest the contrary, she is a virtuous Gentlewoman, and
for me a perfect pure Virgin. For the Popes Breeves, Sir Edmond Baynams going
over Seas, and the matter of the Powdertreason, he referred himself to his
Arraignment, and his Confessions; for whatsoever is under my hand in any of my
Confessions, said he, is true.

Then addressing himself to Execution, he kneeled at the Ladder foot, and asked
if he might have time to pray, and how long? It was answered, he should limit
himself, none should interrupt him. It appeared, he could not constantly or
devoutly pray, fear of death, or hope of pardon, even then so distracted him;
for often in those Prayers he would break off, turn and look about him, and
answer to what he overheard, while he seemed to be praying. When he stood up,
the Recorder finding in his behavior as it were an expectation of a Pardon,
wished him not to deceive himself, nor beguile his own Soul; he was come to
die, and must die; requiring him not to equivocate with his last breath, if he
knew any thing that might be danger to the King or State, he should now utter
it. Garnet said, It is now no time to equivocate; how it was lawful, and when,
he had showed his mind elsewhere. But, says he, I do not now equivocate, and
more than I have confessed, I do not know. At his ascending up the Ladder, he
desired to have warning before he was turned off. But it was told him, He must
look for no other turn but death. Being upon the Gibbet, he used these words, I
commend me to all good Catholics, and I pray God preserve his Majesty, the
Queen, and all their Posterity, and my Lords of the Privy Council, to whom I
remember my humble duty, and I am sorry that I did dissemble with them; but I
did not think they had had such proof against me, till it was showed me: but
when that was proved, I held it more honor for me at that time to confess,
than before to have accused. And for my Brother Greenway, I would the truth
were known; for the false reports that are, make him more faulty than he is. I
should not have charged him, but that I thought he had been safe. I pray God
the Catholics may not fare the worse for my sake; and I exhort them all to
take heed they enter not into any Treasons, Rebellions, or Insurrections
against the King. And with this, ended speaking, and fell to praying: and
crossing himself, said, In nomine Patris, and Filii, and Spiritus sancti; and
prayed, Maria matter Gratiae, Maria matter misericordiae, T^ me a malo protege,
and hora mortis suscipe. Then, In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum.
Then, Per crucis hoc signum, (crossing himself) fugiat procul omne malignum.
Infige crucem tuam in cord meo Domine. Let me always remember the Cross. And
so returned again to Maria matter Gratiae, and then was turned off, and hung
till he was dead.

PAPERS OR LETTERS OF Sr EVERARD DIGBY, Chiefly relating to the Gunpowder-Plot,
and written by him during his Imprisonment in the Tower.

Never before Published.

Licensed,

William Jane.
Ian. 31. 167^.
TO THE READER.
WHere and when the Originals of the following Papers or Letters of Sir Everard
Digby were found, will appear by the Certificate at the end of this Preface.

It is thought fit to publish them all just as they were found, though all of
them do not concern the Plot; that it may not be pretended, that any thing
tending either to his Vindication or Honor is omitted or suppressed. His
Letter to his Sons is full of good counsel, proper for a dying Father: And the
Verses, though they be not excellent, yet have a good tincture of Piety and
Devotion in them.

The rest seem most of them to be written with juice of Limons, or some such
thing, and are not made up and directed in the form of Letters, but several of
them written in small pieces of Paper, that so they might the more easily be
conveyed away without suspicion, by those who were permitted to come to him.

Where any words are worn out, or so decayed, that they could not be read,
there is a space left: Where any Letters or Words were doubtful and obscure,
the Transcriber has conjectured as well as he could, and Printed them in a
different Character.

This unfortunate Gentleman, Sir Everard Digby, who from a mistaken Zeal, was
engaged in this horrible Conspiracy, was not, as I have been credibly informed,
above 24 years of age, at the time of his death.

As for the Papers themselves, whoever shall diligently peruse them, may
receive abundant satisfaction in these following particulars.

First, That this Gentleman was verily persuaded of the lawfalness of this
Design, and did engage in it out of a sincere, but ignorant zeal, for the
advancement, as he thought, of the true Religion.

Secondly, That although, after his Imprisonment, when he heard it was censured
by those of his Religion as a great sin, he called in question the lawfulness
of it, yet he was never fully convinced that it was so great a sin.

He says indeed, That the censure of Paper 1.
this Action by some of his Religion, called his Conscience in doubt of it; but
withal, that this doubt which he had Ibid.
of his good estate proceeded only from the censure of others; and that for
Ibid.
some good space he could do nothing, but with tears ask pardon at Gods hands
for all his errors, both in actions and intentions, in this business, and in
his whole life; which the censure of this, contrary to his expectance, had
caused him to doubt. So that here was no clear conviction of the heinousness of
this horrible crime; only if it were a sin, which, from the opinion of others
concerning it, he had some doubt it might be, he asks forgiveness of God for it
among the other errors of his life: But had he been fully convinced, he would
not only have declared his repentance for it after another manner, but have
made a full discovery of this wicked Plot, and of those that were engaged in
it, which it is plain from these Letters, he declined to to do to the last: And
surely that cruel expression, upon supposition that the Plot had taken effect,
I do not think there Paper 9.
would have been three worth the saving that should have been lost, is but a
very ill sign of his repentance.

Thirdly, That it is very probable, that afterward, before his death, he
received satisfaction of the lawfulness of it, and that from his Brother, or
one whom he calls so, as may appear by these passages: I give (says he) my
Brother Paper 4.
many thanks for his sweet comforts, and assure him, that now I desire death;
for the more I think of Gods mercy, the more I hope in my own case, though
others have censured our intentions otherwise than we understood them to be:
And though the Act be thought so wicked by those of judgment, yet I hope my
understanding it otherwise, with my sorrow for my error, will find acceptance
at God's hands. And toward the end of that Letter, he seems to be yet much
better satisfied, when he says, that he only Ibid.
owed 200l. which he had kept in his hands for the good of the BEST CAUSE.
Which plainly shows what opinion he had of it himself, though out of regard to
the opinion of others he begged Gods mercy if it were an error: And in the
conclusion of the next Letter (which must be written afterward, because he
says, that then he had not been asked the Paper 5.
Priests name, concerning which, he had desired his Brothers advice in the
former Letter) he entreats his friends to pray Ibid.
for his not sufficient striving against Temptations, since this business was
undertook. Where by Temptations he does in all probability mean, the doubtings
he had entertained about it. But that which is more then all this, is, that in
his long Letter to his Sons, though he do earnestly recommend his own Religion
to them, yet he gives them not one word of caution against such Practices and
Conspiracies upon account of Religion, as that for which he was to suffer:
Which it cannot be imagined he would have omitted to do, had he been thoroughly
convinced of the impiety of such Practices.

Fourthly, That he thought it lawful to deny anything upon his Examination,
that was to the disadvantage of his Religion, or might bring others into
danger, without any regard to truth: which is a strange liberty for a
conscientious man to take, or to think Religion does allow: and yet he owns it
so frankly, that no man can think he had the least doubt concerning it, as is
evident from these Passages.

My Lord Chief Justice asked me, Paper 1.
if I had taken the Sacrament to keep secret the Plot, as others did? I said,
that I had not, because I would avoid the question, At whose hands it were?

If I be called in question for the Paper 4.
Priest in my Letter, I propose to name him Winscombe, unless I be advised
otherwise. And speaking of the same Priest, he says, I have not been asked his
Paper 5.
name; which if I had, should have been such a one as I knew not any of. And in
the next Letter, You forgot to tell me whether Winscombe be a fit name; Paper 6.
I like it, for I know none of it. By all which it appears, that he made no
manner of scruple, to give in a false name upon examination.

Fifthly, That this was a real Plot, wherein several Popish Priests and
Jesuits, and other Persons of Quality of that Religion were engaged: And not
only so, but that if it had taken effect, an Association of Foreign Princes of
that Religion, by a Solemn Oath, like that Paper 9.
of the Holy League in France, was designed, to have assured the business
afterward.

And is it not strange, that after all this, men should have the face to
disclaim a thing so notorious to all the world? and to lay it upon the Kings
Ministers, as a State-Contrivance, on purpose to make the Papists odious?

Why was not this said before, by those who were likely, and most concerned to
know it? This Gentleman seems not to have had the least suspicion of any such
matter: None of the Conspirators either at their Examination, or Trial, or
Execution, complained of it, that they were deceived and dwn in; and if they
had, they had nevertheless been Traitors: None of the Apologists of that time
for this black Conspiracy, neither Bellarmine, nor Eudaemon Johannes, nor any
other that I have seen, do suggest any such thing, which they would most
certainly have done, had they known the least ground for it. Nay, the late
History of the English Jesuits, written by More, a Jesuit, and published at
St. Omers in 1660, does fully own this horrid Conspiracy of the Papists, and
charge it Hist. Provinc. Anglic. Soc. Jesus. l. 7. page 310.
solely upon them; only he endeavors to clear the Jesuits of the contrivance
of this Design, acknowledging they were guilty of the concealment of it.

But now to come threescore years after, and to think to baffle all the Records
and Histories of that Time, by a bold and groundless surmise, that all this was
a Contrivance of Secretary Cecil, without the least proof or evidence produced
for it, is a confidence only becoming such a Church, and such a Cause. To
conclude this matter, Though the Priests of the Roman Church are able to impose
so far upon the easy credulity of their People, as to persuade them every day
to deny their Senses, and to believe contrary to what they plainly see; yet
have they no reason to expect the same civility and compliance from us, whom
they know to have, above an hundred years ago, taken up an obstinate resolution
to believe our own Senses, against the confidence and presumption of any Church
in the World.

1. I Have not named any either living or Paper 1*
dead, that should have hurt my Lord Salisbury: and only intended these General
Informations to procure me access of some Friend, that I might inform my
knowledge, for I never intended to hurt any Creature though it would have
gained me all the world. As yet they have not got of me the affirming that I
know any Priest particularly, nor shall ever do to the hurt of any but my self.
At my first examination the Earl of Salisbury told me, that some things should
be affirmed against me by Gerrat the Priest, who, says he, I am sure you know
well. My Answer was, that if I might see him, I would tell him whether I knew
him or no, but by that name I did not know him, nor at Mrs. Vauxe's, as he said
I did, for I never saw a Priest there. Yesterday I was before Mr. Attorney and
my Lord Chief Justice, who asked me if I had taken the Sacrament to keep secret
the Plot as others did. I said that I had not, because I would avoid the
question of at whose hands it were. They told me that five had taken it of
Gerrard, and that he knew of the Plot, which I said was more than I knew.

Now for my Intention let me tell you, that if I had thought there had been the
least sin in the Plot, I would not have been of it for all the world: and no
other cause drew me to hazard my Fortune and Life, but Zeal to Gods Religion.
For my keeping it secret, it was caused by certain belief, that those which
were best able to judge of the lawfulness of it, had been acquainted with it,
and given way unto it. More reasons I had to persuade me to this belief than I
dare utter, which I will never, to the suspicion of any, though I should to the
Rack for it, and as I did not know it directly that it was approved by such, so
did I hold it in my Conscience the best not to know any more if I might.

I have before all the Lords cleared all the Priests in it for any thing that I
know, but now let me tell you, what a grief it has been to me, to hear that so
much Condemned which I did believe would have been otherwise thought on by
Catholics; there is no other cause but this, which has made me desire Life,
for when I came into Prison death would have been a Welcome Friend unto me, and
was most desired; but when I heard how Catholics and Priests thought of the
matter, and that it should be a great sin that should be the Cause of my end,
it called my Conscience in doubt of my very best Actions and Intentions in
question: for I knew that my self might easily be deceived in such a Business,
therefore I protest unto you that the doubts I had of my own Good State, which
only proceeded from the censure of others, caused more bitterness of grief in
me than all the miseries that ever I suffered, and only this caused me wish
Life till I might meet with a Ghostly friend. For some good space I could do
nothing, but with Tears ask pardon at Gods hands for all my Errors, both in
Actions and Intentions in this Business, and in my whole life, which the
censure of this contrary to my expectance caused me to doubt: I did humbly
beseech that my Death might satisfy for my Offense, which I should and shall
offer most gladly to the Giver of Life. I assure you as I hope in God that the
love of all my Estate and wordly happiness did never trouble me, nor the love
of it since my imprisonment did ever move me to wish life. But if that I may
live to make satisfaction to God and the world where I have given any Scandal,
I shall not grieve if I should never look Living Creature in the face again,
and besides that deprivation endure all wordly misery. I shall not need to
clear any living body either private or public, for I never named any body,
but reported that those that are dead did promise, that all Forces in those
parts about Mr. Talbot would assist us, but this can hurt nothing, for they
openly spoke it. You must be careful how you send, for Mr. Leiftenant has
stayed the Book, but I thi^ it is Pap^ Book, b^ the lette^ are alm^ worn ou^
take no notice of it. Let my Brother see this, or know the Contents, tell him
I love his sweet comforts as my greatest Jewel in this Place, if I can I will
Convey in the Tables a Copy of a Letter which I sent yesterday; it is as near
as I can understand the meaning of the Instruction. I perceive it works with
the Lords for I shall be sent to them. Oh how full of Joy should I I dye if I
could do any thing for the Cause which I love more than my Life! Farewell my

sent to Mr. Catesbyes, I did carry but one other Trunk with me, which had in
it Clothes of mine, as, a White Satin Dublet cut with Purple, a Jerkin and
Hoase of De-roy color Satin laid very thick with Gold-lace, there were other
Garments in it of mine, with a new black Winter Gown of my Wifes, there was
also in the Trunk 300l. in Money, and this Trunk did I see safe at Mr.

Since that Mr. Adis cannot spare time from his business to sell such goods as
shall be necessary to defray the expense of my Wife, Children and Family, and
my own Charges, my desire therefore is that one Andrew Knight of Newport,
dwelling near the house where these goods are, should have power given him to
make sale of such things as shall be thought necessary for these purposes.

you, I have been with the Lords, whose chiefest questions were what I meant by
the Message, which I should send you to Coughton, about laying up that which I
delivered, which, said the Lords, were either a Priest or Money: but I denied
the sending of any such Message, they asked me of Father Wallies being there,
which I denied: also they asked me what Letter Mr. Catesby did send to him, but
could tell them of none: it seems that Bate has confessed thus much, whether
he has been tortured or no, I know not: they asked me what Company I kept the
Sunday Sevenight before the day: to which I could not answer, for I did not
remember; but they told me that I was in the Company of Father Walley, Father
Greenway, and Father Geratt at Mrs. Vauxe's: I told them that I had been in
their Companies, but not there or any where else with others but my self; they
said Mr. Greenway came to Huddington when we were there, and had speech with
Mr. but I told them it was more than I took note of, and that I did not know
him very well, that he would be very careful of himself; my Lord of Salisbury
told me he had received my letter, but if the King should propose such a course
he had no need of me. I was not much pressed in these matters, and so they
dismissed me for this time. Farewell my Dearest.

4. SInce my late writing, I have been examied Paper.
about the knowledge of Foster and Hamon. I give my Brother many thanks for his
sweet comforts, and assure him that now I desire death; for the more I think on
Gods mercy the more I hope in my own case: though others have censured our
Intentions otherwise than I understood them to be, and though the Act be
thought so wicked by those of Judgment, yet I hope that my understanding it
otherwise, with my Sorrow for my Error, will find acceptance at Gods hands. I
have not as yet acknowledged the knowledge of any Priiest in particular, nor
will not do to the hurt of any but my self, whatsoever betide me. I could give
unanswerable reasons both for the good that this would have done for the
Catholic Cause, and for my being from Home, but I think it now needless, and
for some respect unfit. I do perceive the Lords will come hither no more, which
caused me to write, which Copy I send you. I have some guess that it works,
but the Lieutenant makes all show to me of the contrary; for, says he, the
Catholics are so few in number as they are not to be feared on any terms, for
on his knowledge there were not above 4000. in all England. Besides he said
they were easily pacifyed, I would not at all argue the matter with him, but if
the number should be objected by the Lords unto me, why may I not Answer it
thus, that it is certain there is at least 400 Priests in England, therefore by
all Consequence there must be more Catholics: if there be inconvenience in it
let me know and I have done. If I be called to question for the Priest, in my
Letter I purpose to name him Winscombe, unless I be advised otherthwise. I do
desire my Brothers advise for Sir Oliver, for his Rents I never received any,
and only owe 200l. which I kept in my hands for the good of the best Cause, out
of which I had paid 30l. There is one hundred pounds yet to be paid by my Cousin
John to him, and the Bonds for that and three more he has paid, are in my
Guilt Box, at least there I left them: I durst not make a perfect note for his
Estate, because I know not his course, and whether it would be hurtful for me
to put it from my self to him, as

5. I Do not well conceive my brother, for I did Paper 5.
never say that any other told me but Mr. Catesby about the Lords particulars:
and for affirming that a Priest in general said something of Intentions of
redress, I did understand Tar: Notice to give approbation, I have not been
asked his name, which if I had should have been such a one as I knew not of.
Howsoever my Brother is informed, I am sure they fear him for knowledge of the
Plot, for at every examination I am told that he did give the Sacrament to five
at one time, who they say have confessed it I do not know who they be; sure I
am that I never yet did confess to know him nor any of the three. I do it not
in regard of my self, as it shall appear at the Bar, for whatsoever I could do
for him or any of his, I would do it though it cost me never so much
sufferance: but I have been sparing in that, because I may do more in public,
which will I think be best, as you wish I will do, and what else may clear me
from Scandal, not with any hopes or desire of favor; my little friends
Courtesy is very comfortable, entreat them to pray for the pardoning of my not
sufficient striving against temptations since this business was undertook.
Farewell, God send you can read.

6. YOu forgot to tell me whether Winscombe Paper 6.
be a fit name: I like it, for I know none of it. You need not fear this Lord
for he never looks in the tables nor dare show them to any. Tell my brother I
do honor him as befits me, but I did not think I could have increased in so
much, loving him more as his charitable Lessons would make me. Your information
does much comfort me, but I pray you after my Death let me not want good
Prayers, for my need is great though my trust in God is not small, as occasions
falls out you will know. Farewell.

7. I Have found your pennywares but Paper 7.
never that in the Wascoat till this night. The ^bstance of my last writing was
strictly examined about Mr. Darcy, who they said the first time was Blackwell,
but after they told me it was Wallee or Garnet, I told them it was more than I
knew, for I did not take him to be a Priest: they also urged me with Brook,
Fisher and Brown and said they were Priests, and that Brook was Gerratt, but I
answered I did not know so much, they told me that I had been at Mrs. Vauxe's
with this Company and that I knew Gerrat there, but I denied it. They did in a
Fashion offer me the torture, which I will rather endure then hurt any body, as
yet I have not tried it the next time I will write more. I could scarce

an inward friend with the Business, was not for any particular wilfulness, or
ill end; but I thought it not best for the Cause, nor did not think it ill,
which was to be done, since necessity compelled, as I thought somewhat to be
done. I saw the Principal point of the Case, judged in a Latin Book of M. D. my
brothers Father in Law, I neither can nor will draw in suspect for a world, but
if he were deceived in that point by a prefixed day, let him think that I had
more cause than he

9. MY Dearest the I take at the uncharitable taking of these matters, Paper 9.
will make me say more than ever I thought to have done. For if this Design had
taken place, there could have been no doubt of other Success: for that night,
before any other could have brought the News, we should have known it by Mr.
Catesby, who should have proclaimed the Heir Apparent at Charing Cross, as he
came out of Town; to which purpose there was a Proclamation Drawn; if the Duke
had not been in the House, then was there a certain way laid for the possessing
him; but in regard of the assurance, they should have been there, therefore the
greatest of our business stood in the possessing the Lady Elisabeth, who lying
within Eight Miles of Dunchurch, we would have easily surprised before the
knowledge of any doubt: this was the Cause of my being there. If she had been
in Rutland, then Stoaks was near, and in either place we had taken sufficient
Order to have been possessed of her; there was also courses taken for the
satisfying the people if the first had taken effect, as the speedy notice of
Liberty and Freedom from all manner of Slavery, as the ceasing of Wardships and
all Monopolies, which with Change would have been more plausible to the people,
if the first had been, than it is now. There was also a course taken to have
given present notice to all Princes, and to Associate them with an Oath
answerable to the League in France. I have not uttered any of these things, nor
ever thought to do; for my going from Dunchurch I had this Reason. First I knew
that Faux could reveal me, for I must make choice of two besides Mr. Catesby,
which I did of him and Mr. Winter. I knew he had been employed in great
matters, and till torture sure he carried it very well. Secondly, we all
thought if we could procure Mr. Talbot, to rise that party at least to a
Composition that was not little, because we had in our Company his Son in Law,
who gave us some hope of, and did not much doubt it. I do answer your speech
with Mr. Brown thus. Before that I knew any thing of this Plot, I did ask Mr.
Farmer what the meaning of the Popes Brief was; he told me that they were not
(meaning Priests) to undertake or procure stirrs: but yet they would not hinder
any, neither was it the Popes mind they should, that should be underdertaken
for Catholic good. I did never utter thus much, nor would not but to you; and
this Answer with Mr. Catesbyes proceedings with him and me, gave me absolute
belief that the matter in general was approved, though every particular was not
known. I dare not take that course that I could, to make it appear less Odious;
for diverse were to have been brought out of the danger, which now would rather
hurt them than otherwise. I do not think there would have been three worth
Saving that should have been lost; you may guess that I had some Friends that
were in danger, which I had prevented, but they shall never know it. I will do
as much as my Partner wishes, and it will then appear, that I have not hurt or
accused one man, and howsoever I might in general possess them with fear, in
hope to do the Cause good, yet my care was ever to lose my own Life, rather
than hurt the unworthiest Member of the Catholic Church. Tell Her I have ever
loved Her and Her House, and though I could never show it, I will not live to
manifest the Contrary. Her Go: I hope will remember me, who I am in temporal
respects indebted to: your Sister salute from me, whose noble mind to me in
this misery, I will never my Lord of Arundell may do much with the Lord and the
Queen. One that you write of which dearly loves him, and is dearly loved of
him again, can tell him that I love him, and did manifest it in his sight, and
he might have found it; last time as I saw him, was in his Company, as I think.
I am sure when this was, he was there. If your Mother were in Town you should
do it to her. Farewell, and where you cannot understand, send to me by your
next, and I will Explain.

Jesus Maria.
THere be many reasons (my dear Children) that might dissuade me from putting
Pen to Paper in this kind, and only one which urges me to undertake this poor
and fruitless pains. Wherefore to tell you what inciteth me to it, is my want
of other means to show my Fatherly affection to each of you: (which is so far
from uttering, as my mind is willing to accept of poor means, rather than none
to bewray my disposition) if I would have been checked from the performance of
these lines, by number and probabilities of reasons; I might then have called
to mind the unlikelihood, that these would ever have come to your view; with
the malice of the world to me, which (I do imagine) will not fail to endeavor
to possess you with a loathness to hear of any thing that comes from me: as
also I might, and do think, on my own disability in advising, with many other
disswasive reasons, which my former recited single stirrerup has banished.

Wherefore to begin with both and each of you, I send you by these my Fatherly
and last blessing; which I have not failed to ask at Gods hands on my knees,
that he will grant to descend so effectually on you (that his holy grace
accompanying it) it may work in you the performance (on your part) of Gods
sweet and just commandments; and on his part to you, the Guerdon that his mercy
inricheth his Servants withal.

Let this end (Gods Service I mean) be the chief and only contentious strife
between you, which with all vehemence and desire each of you may strive to
attain soonest. Let this be the mark which your thoughts and actions may still
level at; for here is the chiefest Prise, to recompense the best deserver.
Believe me in this (my Sons) that though my unripe years afford me not general
experience, yet my variety of courses in the world (and Gods grace to illumine
me) may sufficiently warrant the verity of this principle. If you make this
your chief business, (as you ought to do, and for which end only you were sent
into the world) I doubt not but God will send you better means for your
particular directions, than either the brevity of a Letter, or my ability can
discharge. So that in this I will say no more, but pray that you may live as I
hope to die, which is in the perfect obedience of the Catholic and only
saving Church.

I cannot but a little touch, what I could wish you did, and I hope will do to
all sorts of people; it is a lesson I could never learn well my self, but
perhaps see more* what is convenient for others, than that I were ever able to
show the force of wholesome counsel, and good instructions in my own life.

Above all things in the world, seek to obey and follow your Mothers will and
pleasure; who as she has been the best wife to me that ever man enjoyed, so
can she not fail to show her self equal to the best Mother, if you deserve not
the contrary. If it please God to send her life, (though you have nothing else)
I shall leave you enough: And on the contrary, if I could leave you ten times
more than my self ever had, yet she being taken from you, I should think you
but poor. It is not (my Sons) abundance of riches that makes a man happy, but a
virtuous life; and as they are blessings from God, and cause of happiness to a
man that uses them well, so are they cause of misery to most men even in this
world.

You may read of diverse men, who whiles they lived in private state, deserved
the fame of all that knew them; but so soon as prosperous fortune, and higher
degrees, had taken possession of them, they seemed not to be the same men, but
grew into scorn of all the world. For example, Galba, whiles he lived in Spain
as a private man, and, as it were, banished his Country, by a Charge that
procured in him great pains and care; he was so well liked, that upon the death
of Nero the Emperor, he was Elected in his room; but was no sooner in that
Place, than he was plucked out of it again by violent death, as a man unfit for
such a Charge, by reason of his alteration which that Dignity wrought in him.

You may see also in Otho, who succeeded him, that all the while of his
prosperity, he lived a most dissolute life, and odious to all men; but he was
no sooner touched with adversity, but he grew to a brave and worthy resolution,
making choice rather (not out of desperation) of his own death, than that by
his life the Commonweal sho^ ^e disturbed. And though I cannot but disallow
the manner of his death, (by reason he knew not God truly) yet is it plain,
that adversity brought him to that worthy mind, which contemned life in regard
of his Countries good; and which was so contrary to that mind that prosperity
had missed in him. If then adverse Fortune were so powerful, more than
prosperity, in Pagans and Misbelievers, to procure in them worthy minds; what
may we expect the force of it should be in Christians, whose first Captain (not
out of necessity, but free choice) made manifest to the world, by his own
painful footsteps, that there is no other perfect and certain way to true
happiness.

He has not only staid here in demonstration of his verity, but has sent to
all those (who, the world knows, he highliest esteemed, and best loved) nothing
but variety of misery in this life, with cruel and forced death; the which
thing truest wisdom esteems as the best tokens of Love from so powerful a
Sender, and as the best and certainest way to bring a man to perfect happiness.

I speak not this to conclude, that no man is happy but those which run this
strict and best course. But to tell you (my Children) that if the world seek
and prevail to cut you off from enjoyin^ my Estate and Patrimony in this world,
yet (...) should not think your selves more unhappy (...) for God, it may be,
does see, that (...) other course more fit for you; or (...) would give great
hazard to your Souls health, which he takes away, by removing the occasion.

But howsoever you find your selves in fortunes of this world, use them to Gods
best pleasure, and think your selves but Bailiffs of such things for an
uncertain time. If they be few or poor, your fear of making a good account may
be the lesser; and know, that God can send more and richer, if it be requisite
for his glory and your good: if they be many or great, so much the more care
you ought to take in governing your selves, lest God, as holding you unworthy
such a charge, by taking them from you, or you from them, do also punish you
with eternal misery, for abusing his benefits. You shall the better learn to
make true use and reckoning of these vanities, if with due obedience you do
hearken to your Mothers wholesome counsel; and what want you shall find in my
instructions, you may see better declared to you by looking on her life, which
though I cannot give assurance for any thing to be done in future times, yet
can I not but very steadfastly believe, that the same Lord will give
perseverance in virtue, where he has laid so strong a foundation for his
Spiritual building, and where there is such an humble and resigned will to the
pleasure of her Lord and Maker.

The next part of my Charge shall be, in your mutual carriage the one to the
other; in which, all reasons to move you to perfect accord, and entire love, do
present themselves unto you, as the obligation of Christianity, the tie of
natural and nearest Consanguinity, and the equality, or very small difference
of Age. There is in none of these any thing wanting, that may be an impediment
to truest Friendship, nor any thing to be added to them (for procuring your
mutual and heartiest love) but your own consent and particular desert each to
other. Since then there is all cause in each of you for this love, do not
deprive your selves of that earthly happiness, which God, Nature, and Time
offers unto you: but if you think that the benefit which accord and
friendship brings, be not sufficient to enkindle this love, (which God forbid
you should) yet let the consideration of the misery which the contrary works
in all degrees, stay your mind from dislike.

As no man in any Age, but may see great happiness to have been attained by
good agreement of Friends, Kinsmen, and Brethren; so wants there not too many
examples of such, as by hate and discord have frustrated strong hopes sowed in
peace, and brought to nothing great Fortunes; besides the incurring Gods
displeasure, which still comes accompanied with perpetual misery. If you look
into Divine Writ, you shall find, that this was the cause of Abel and Cain's
misery, which the least hard hap that came to either of them, was to be
murdered by his Brother.

If you look into Humane Stories, you need search no further to behold a most
pitiful object, than the two Sons of Philip King of Macedon, whose dislike each
to other was so deeply rooted, that at length it burst forth to open
complaints, the one of the other, to good old Philip; who seeing it, could not
be put off from a public hearing, called both his Sons, (Demetrius and
Perseus) and in both their hearing made a most effectual speech of concord unto
them; but finding that it would not take effect, gave them free leave to wound
his heart with their unnatural accusations, the one against the other; which
staid not there, by the unjust hastening of their Fathers sudden death, but
caused the murder of one of them, with the utter overthrow of that
Commonwealth, and the misery of the Survivor. These things (I hope) will not be
so necessary for your use, as they are hurtless to know, and effectual where
need requires.

Besides these examples, and fore-recited obligations, let me join a Fathers
charge, which ought not to be slightly esteemed in so just a cause. Let me tell
you, my Son Kenelm, that you ought to be both a Father and a Brother to your
unprovided for Brother, and think, that what I am hindered from performing to
him by short life, and voluntary tie of my Land to you; so much account your
self bound to do to him, both in Brotherly affection to him, and in natural
duty to me. And you, my Son John, know I send you as Fatherly a Blessing, as if
I had also given you a great Patrimony; and that if my life had permitted, I
would have done my endeavor that way. If you find any thing in that kind to
come from your Brother, take it the more thankfully; but if that you do not,
let it not lessen your love to him, who ought not to be loved by you for his
Fortune or Bounty, but for himself. I am sorry that I am cut off by time from
saying so much as I did intend at the first; but since I may not, I will
commend in my Prayers your instruction and guidance to the Giver of all
goodness, who ever bless and keep you.

From my Prison this 23. of Jan. 1605. Your affectionate Father, Eve. Digby.


Come grief, possess that place thy Harbingers have seen,
And think most fit to entertain thy self;
Bring with thee all thy Troops, and sorrows longest Teem
Of followers, that wail for worldly pelf:
Here shall they see a Wight more lamentable,
Than all that Troop that seem most miserable.
For here they may discry, if perfect search be made,
The substance of that shadow causing woe:
An unkind Frost, that caused hopeful Sprou^s to fade;
Not only mine, but others grief did grow
By my misdeed, which grieves me most of all,
That I should be chief cause of others fall.
For private loss to grieve, when others have no cause
Of sorrow, is unmeet for worthy mind;
For who but knows, that each man's sinful life still draws
More just revenge, than he on earth can find.
But to undo desert and innocence,
Is, to my mind, griefs chiefest pestilence.
I grieve not to look back into my former state,
Though different that were from present case;
I moan not future haps, though forced death with hat^
Of all the world were blustred in my face.
But Oh I grieve to think that ever I
Have been a means of others misery.
When on my little Babes I think, as I do often,
I cannot choose but then let fall some tears:
Methinks I hear the little Pratler, with words soft,
Ask, Where is Father that did promise Pears,
And other Knacks, which I did never see,
Nor Father neither, since he promised me.
It Is true, my Babe, thou never saw thy Father since,
Nor art thou ever like to see again:
That stopping Father into mischief which will pinch
The tender Bud, and give thee cause to plain
His hard dysaster; that must punish thee,
Who art from guilt as any Creature free.
But Oh! when she that bare thee, Babe, comes to my mind,
Then do I stand as drunk with bitterest woe,
To think that she, whose worth were such to all, should find
Such usage hard, and I to cause the blow,
Of her such sufferance, that does pierce my heart,
And gives full grief to every other part.
Hence comes the cause, that each tear striveth to be first,
As if I meant to stint them of their course.
No salted meats: that done, you know my heart would burst
With violent assaults of your great force:
But when I stay you, it is for that I fear,
Your gushing so will leave me never a tear.
But ah! this doubt, Grief says, I never need to fear,
For she will undertake to afford me store;
Who in all her knowledge never cause of woe did hear
That galled her deeper, or gave witness more
Of earths hard usage, that does punish those,
That guiltless be, with Fortunes cruellest blows.
Though further cause of more than utterable grief,
As others loss, I could dilate at large,
Which I am cause of, yet her suffering being chief
Of all their woes, that sail in this deep Barge
Of sorrows Sea: I cannot but reflect
Hereon more deeply, and with more respect.
On which dear object when I look with grieved mind,
Such store of pities see I plead her case,
As hardest heart cause of compassion there would find,
To hear what could be said before that face,
Which I have worng'd in causing so to weep,
The grief whereof constrains my Pen to sleep.
Jesus Maria.
Who Is that which knocks? Oh stay, my Lord, I come:
I know that call, since first it made me know
My self, which makes me now with joy to run,
Lest he be gone that can my duty show.
Jesus my Lord, I know thee by the Cross
Thou offer'st me, but not unto my loss.
Come in, my Lord, whose presence most I crave,
And show thy will unto my longing mind.
From punishments of sin thy Servant save,
Though he has been to thy deserts unkind.
Jesus forgive, and strengthen so my mind,
That rooted virtues thou in me may find.
Stay still, my Lord, else will they fade away,
As Marigold that mourns for absent Sun:
Thou know thou plantest in a barren clay,
That choaks in Winter all that up is come.
I do not fear thy Summers wished heat,
My tears shall water where thy shine does threat.
FINIS.
