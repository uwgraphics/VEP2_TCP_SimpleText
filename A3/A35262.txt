Dear Youth, True Wisdoms Precepts learn,
And hearken to her Words,
She to all that obey her Voice,
A glorious Crown affords.
THE Epistle to Youth.
SWeet Children, Wisdom you invites
To hearken to her voice;
She offers to you rare Delights,
Most worthy of your choice.
Eternal Blessings in her ways,
You shall be sure to find.
O therefore in your youthful days,
Your Great Creator mind,
Upon a World vain, toilsom, foul,
A Journey now you enter;
The welfare of your Living Soul
You dangerously adventure.
The Joys that other pleasure brings,
With Vanities abound,
Nay, when in Streights they take their wings,
Vexations they are found.
Then humbly strive without delay
Grace in God's sight to find,
And gladly now and all your days
Your Great Creator mind.

I. Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, Genesis 2.


ADam and Eve were formed of dust,
That was their Pedigree,
Yet had a grant never to die,
Would they obedient be.
And to add to their happiness,
In uprightness were made,
And into Eden they were put,
Under God's blessed Shade.
They wanted nothing, but had leave
This Garden to possess,
And there to eat and recreate
Themselves in Blessedness.
They only were prohibited,
The Tree of Good and Evil,
Lest eating it should them betray
To Sin, Death, and the Devil.
But they were quickly drawn aside,
By Satan's subtilty;
By whose advice they took and eat
What caused their misery.
They God's Command forget, and what
He unto them had said:
The Serpent's Craft over them prevails
Whereby they are betrayed.
Being thus fallen, they next contrive
Excuses how to frame,
To cover their Iniquity,
And to conceal their Shame.
Adam does Eve accuse, and she
All on the Serpent lays,
But still their guilt the more appears,
Their Crime it more displays.
For which the Almighty did them cast
Out of his Paradise,
To make them know that Death and Woe
Does follow Sin and Vice.
II. Upon Cain and Abel, Genesis 4.


CAin seemed a Zealous Worshiper,
Yet did he come behind
His Brother, Abel is preferred,
'Cause he was best inclined.
Cain saw no further than the Law,
But Abel walked by Faith,
Which made his Offering acceptable
To God, as Scripture says.
Abel looked through his Sacrifice
To Jesus, yet to come,
Cain his own works o're-valued,
And a Curse carried home.
When God in Judging did receive
Abel, and Cain reject,
Cain murmurs, and complains and grieves,
'Cause he had no respect.
And being proud, did much disdain
The Youth should him outdo,
Yet finds no way repute to gain,
But what adds to his Woe.
He takes his opportunity,
And does his Brother kill,
'Cause he his God did glorify,
And rightly do his Will.
This done, God asks, Where Is Abel? Cain,
He says, I cannot tell,
And yet he had poor Abel slain?
Oh the deceits of Hell!
But Cain, a very dreadful sound
I from the Earth do hear,
Thy Brother's Blood spilt on the ground
Does sadly pierce mine Ear.
Thou Wretch! Thou have my Abel slain,
His Blood revenge I will;
Depart, see not my Face again
Upon my Holy Hill.
III. Upon Noah 's Flood, Genesis 6.7.


WHen Men by Sin and Violence
Did stain the Earth with Blood,
God did resolve to wash them thence
By Waters of a Flood.
Yet did he warn before he struck,
Noah was sent to tell
They by their Sins would God provoke
To cast them down to Hell.
He also set an hundred years
Betwixt the threat and blow,
If happily they by Prayers and Tears
Might yet prevent their Woe.
He likewise caused Noah to make
An Ark, thereby to save
His House, while those who did forsake
Him, might their Judgment have.
Thus patience was with threatening mixed,
But all did them no good;
Their minds on mischief they had fixed,
And so God sent the Flood.
Then some unto the Mountains flee,
And others climb the Trees,
Here one cries out, Ah! Woe is me,
He Death and Judgment sees.
But now alas it is too late,
Treasures of Wrath break out,
Their dismal, yea Eternal Fate,
Does compass them about.
Now Mercy does to Judgment turn,
Now sinful pleasures sting.
The thoughts of years misspent return,
Terrors in every thing.
But where is Noah? In the Ark
Alive, in health and well,
Though at his Building they did mock,
He has escaped their Hell.
IV. Upon the Burning of Sodom and Gomorrah, Genesis 19.


IN Canaan's Land did Sodom stand,
Amidst a pleasant Plain.
Like Eden 'twas, nor want, nor loss
They seemed to sustain.
They eat and drank, had all things full,
Whatever they could require,
God liberally provides for them,
They have their Hearts desire.
They bought and sold; Silver and Gold
They in abundance had,
They decked were with Jewels fair,
And with fine Silk were clad.
Their Fertile Fields much Corn did yield,
Their Water-Springs ran clear,
Their Sheep and Kine, Fig Trees and Vine
Brought Plenty every year.
They wanted not a Righteous Lot,
To teach them how to please
So good a Lord, who did afford
Them Riches, Health and Ease.
But Ah behold, how vile and bold
These Men of Sodom were;
To wantonness and all excess
They all addicted are.
The Poor they slight, in Lust delight,
And live in Sodomy.
Yea in their Pride at Lot deride,
And mock his Ministry.
For which the Almighty with a Rod
Of Brimstone set on Fire,
Drives from the Earth to dismal Death,
These objects of his Ire.
To Ashes turns their Cities; Burns
Their Fields, and all the Plain,
Makes them a Sign of Wrath Divine,
By a most Fiery Rain.
V. Upon Abraham 's Offering Isaac, Genesis 22.


OUR Father Abraham was he
Whom God the Promise made,
That in his Seed we blessed should be,
And thence should come our Aid.
Isaac his Son he did beget,
From whom that Seed should spring,
Who on the Throne of God should sit
As Prophet, Priest and King.
But now since God his Promise kept,
By giving him a Son.
And since that Abraham did avouch
God for the Holy One.
He tempted him, and bid him go
Unto his Holy Hill,
And there by Sacrifice undo
What he meant to fulfill.
Without delay then Abraham went
With Fire, with Wood, and Knife,
And with a resolute intent
To take his Isaac's life.
Being come, he there an Altar makes,
The Wood in order lay,
And then the bloody Knife he takes
God's Counsel to obey.
Nor did he unadvisedly
In this his bold Attempt,
If God will have his Isaac die,
Abraham will not him exempt.
Accounting, had he slain his Son,
And shed his innocent Blood,
The Promise would be still performed,
His God could make it good.
For his Obedience God does give
Him Isaac back again,
A sign that he by Christ should live,
And in his Grace remain.
VI. Upon Joseph and his Mistress, Genesis 30.


TO Potiphar, a Man of War,
Young Joseph for a Slave was sold,
And was so just unto his Trust,
His Master never him controull'd.
Now Joseph's Mistress, void of shame
Upon him cast a lustful Eye,
And without fear unto him said,
I prithee Joseph with me lie.
O impudent, why not content,
With what by Marriage was thy share,
How confident, how void of grace
Does this thy motion thee declare?
To modest Wives thou art a shame,
Who all such wickedness decry,
And all such Harlots will exclude
And banish from their Company.
But would he be, and do as she
With shameless Face did him desire?
No; Sacred Story to his Glory,
Says he from her did soon retire.
For which a false and treacherous part
She did to innocent Joseph show,
Since her lasciviousness he hates,
She into Prison will him throw.
Therefore a cry she instantly
Did feign, pretending she was Chaste,
Alas, said she, he will ravish me,
Come, come, to my relief make haste.
Thus Joseph, 'cause he faithful was,
Did grief endure most wrongfully,
While Potiphar his Wife adores,
For her pretended Honesty.
But into Prison Joseph's thrown,
As guilty of Disloyalty;
With Fetters bound, for Crimes unknown,
Yet soon advanced to dignity.
VII. Upon Joseph and his Brethren, Genesis 42.43.


WHen Joseph's Brethren had him sold,
and into Egypt he was gone,
They went home, and their Father told,
An evil Beast had slain his Son.
This did they, 'cause their evil deeds,
He to their Father used to tell,
Who Vice corrects, but hardly speeds,
Though by so doing he means well.
They likewise hate him for his Dreams,
Scorning he should above them be.
Pride always runs men to extremes,
And envies those that rise more high.
Yet Joseph up at last is set,
Made next to Pharaoh in the Land.
The Cross to Dignity's no let,
The purpose of the Lord shall stand.
A Famine makes them hunt for Bread,
Distressed, they come to Joseph's Door.
What Men despise when they are Great,
They Will not disdain if once grown Poor.
To Joseph now they cringe and bow,
And give him both the Cap and Knee.
The haughty looks the Lord knows how
To bring unto humility.
Joseph looks strange, and speaks rough,
He charges them with being Spies.
Oh! ye are served justly now,
Remember your poor Brother's cries.
Falsehood and Theft he to their charge
Does lay; to mind them of their Sin,
Imprisons, and sets them at large,
To show his Dream fulfilled had been.
At last he tells them who he was,
He kisses and forgives them too,
Tells them, the Crown he got by the Cross;
There Is none but Christ the like can do.
VIII. Upon Moses in the Ark of Bullrushes, Exodus 2.


THY Mother when she saw thy Face,
Concluded thus of thee,
A Man above the common Race
Of Men, my Son will be.
Therefore when she no longer could
Thee in her Bosom hide,
To save thee from the Tyrants wrath,
An Ark she did provide,
Composed of Bulrushes, wherein
Being put, she down thee laid
Upon the Rivers brink, in hope
That God would send thee aid.
Soon after Pharaoh's Daughter came
Unto this very place,
She sees the little Ark, and sends
Her Maid, it to uncase.
When opening this Rushy House,
She there a Babe does spy,
Thou weptst, her Bowels yearn, and she
Bewails thy destiny.
Thy Sister comes and tells her she
A Nurse for thee will call;
Who thy own Mother is, what could
More happily thee befall.
This Child, said she, nurse thou for me,
And Wages thou shall have.
His Mother now Becomes his Nurse,
Naught kills when God will save.
Being now grown up, he comes to Court,
Where owned as the Son
Of Pharaoh's Daughter, he Respect
And Reputation won.
And Moses called, because he was
Taken out of the River,
Who in his early years began
His Brethren to deliver.
IX. Upon Moses and the Burning Bush, Exodus 3.


WHen Moses kept his Fathers Sheep
At Horeb, he did see
What made him quake, a Bush on Fire
Which could not burned be.
He saw the flaming, with amaze,
But whilst he viewed this wonder,
There suddenly from thence proceeds
A Voice much like to Thunder.
Moses, thy Shoes thou must unlose,
Thou stand'st on Holy Ground,
The Lord, thy Father's God is here,
Who does with Grace abound.
I Have heard and seen, and long have been
With Jacob' s groans affected,
For help they crave, and I will save
From Egypt mine afflicted.
Out of this Land I them will bring,
In Canaan they shall dwell,
Their Cause I Will plead, I will them lead,
Because I love them well.
I thee will unto Pharaoh send
For their deliverance;
By Signs and Wonders done by thee,
My Glory I Will advance.
Doubt not, nor be at all dismayed
To go before the King,
Free from all danger, I the Lord
Thee safely back will bring.
Moses now saw the real cause
The Bush was not consumed;
He knew where God made his abode,
Fire rather there perfumed.
Moses and Aaron then to Court
Upon God's Message go,
And bid the King set Israel free,
The Lord will have it so.
X. Upon the Plagues of Egypt, Exodus 7, 8, 9, 10.


WHen Moses unto Pharaob came,
To him he did this Message bring
The Lord says, Let my People go
To serve me with mine Offering.
But he refused he will not hear,
God therefore on him Plagues did send,
Yet still he turned a deaf Ear,
And God with Plagues his life did end.
He turned their Waters into Blood,
From whence a Plague of Frogs did spring,
Which overspread the Land, and came
Into the Chambers of the King.
He still rebels; God next sends Lice,
And swarms of Flies in all their Coasts,
To make them know none can withstand
Jehovah, the Lord God of Hosts.
He Is hardened still; the Murrain next
Infects all Cattle in the Land.
With Boils and Blains God next them plagues,
Magicians cannot before him stand.
To this succeeds a Plague of Hail,
With Thunder mixed and Flames of Fire,
Yet all could not prevail; the King
Performs not what God does require.
He will not yet let Israel go,
The Locusts next by Gods command
Are sent to eat up all green things,
Who instantly devour the Land.
The Heart of Pharaoh still is proud,
He yet refuses to obey,
God them incompasses about
With horrid darkness night and day.
He still persists; till in one Night
Egypt's Firstborn the Lord did slay,
Which put them all in such a fright,
That Pharaoh bid them go their way.
XI. Upon Pharaoh and his Host drowned in the Red Sea, Exodus 14.


WHen Pharaoh had let Israel go,
And they were marching to their place,
He soon repents his doing so,
And calls back his Act of Grace.
Then furiously he them pursues,
Resolving he revenged will be,
For all the mischiefs he had felt,
They now shall feel his cruelty.
At length he does them overtake,
As they encamped by the Sea,
Which filled all their Hearts with dread,
They see there is now no Room to flee.
They made unto the Lord their Prayer,
But seeing Pharaoh was so nigh,
Their Faith was mixed with despair,
They all cry out, we die, we die.
But Moses bid them not to fear,
Stand still (says he) and you shall see
Salvation; God will now appear
And your Deliverer will be.
Moses his Hand stretched out; The Sea
With open Arms does them embrace.
Let Israel still their God obey,
And they will be safe in any place.
Pharaoh pursues; comes near; when lo
An Angel does his speed abate,
Takes off his Wheels, stops his Career,
A Cloud does him infatuate.
He fears, and sees God does oppose
Him in his bloody enterprise.
Yet still is hardened; on he goes,
Revenge and Malice blind his Eyes.
Into the Sea they headlong march,
Over it Moses shakes his Rod.
They all are drowned in their Pride,
According to the Word of God.
XII. Upon the Brazen Serpent, Numb. 21.


GOD's Israel' against him rebel
In Edom's Wilderness,
They Manna slight, as Bread too light,
Which brings them great distress.
God Fiery Serpents on them sent,
Their murmurings to allay,
Which with their biting and their stings
Did very many slay.
This to Repentance brought them, and
They supplicate their God,
He would remove this grievous Plague
And take away this Rod.
Yea Moses too with Prayers does woo
The Lord for Israel:
When they repent, God soon provides
The means to make them well.
Moses was bid by God, of Brass
He should a Serpent make,
That those among them who were stung,
Of Healing might partake.
This Serpent then as on a Cross
Was lifted up on high,
And those who saw it were preserved,
Though stung, they did not die.
This Serpent Lord does represent
Thy well-beloved Son,
Who when Mankind were stung with Sin
And utterly undone,
Thou did advance him on the Cross
That all who do believe,
And yield Obedience unto him,
Assistance might receive.
Let us not therefore shut our Eyes,
But look to him for aid,
In all our wants and miseries,
And never be afraid.
XIII. Upon Balaam and his Ass, Numb. 22.


BAlak much fearing Israel
To Balaam sends, that he
Would come and curse Gods Heritage,
Thereby his Land to free.
Balaam was ready, but forbid
By God, so great a crime,
And therefore stays till Balak sent
Again a second time.
Then Balaam would no more refuse,
But does with him comply,
And thereby is at length involved
In Balak's destiny.
He takes his Servants, and his Ass,
And so away does go,
Forgetting what God to him said,
Balak will have it so.
An angry Angel with his Sword
Appears, him to withstand,
The Ass him sees, and Balaam saves
By flying from his Hand.
He beats his Ass into the way,
The Angel then does stand
In such a place, that Balaam now
His Ass could not command.
But beat him; whereupon the Ass
His Master does reprove
For being cruel to him, when
To keep him safe he strove.
And now this seems a very strange
And an unequal strife,
Balaam resolves to kill his Ass
Because he saves his life.
Thus God by Brutes sometimes is pleased
Men's follies to correct,
When they refuse Obedience,
And his Commands reject
XIV. Upon the Fall of the Walls of Jericho. Joshua 6.


WHen Israel over Jordan got,
To Jericho they quickly went
Because it was part of their Lot,
By the Great God's Commandment.
They blockt it up on every side,
None could get out, nor none go in,
Thus God began to check the Pride
Of The Canaanites who lived in sin.
Arms never heard of used must be
By Israel to gain the Town,
They must sound Rams-horns till they see
The Walls of Jericho fall down.
Six days the Ark must compass it,
And Armed Men about it go,
But must not speak a word as yet,
Nor with a Weapon strike a blow.
The seventh day they seven times go
With sound of trumpet round the town,
Which done, they gave a shout, and lo
The Walls of Jericho fall down.
Thus did the Lord let Israel see
He needed not their Sword nor Bow,
By strange and most unlikely means
He can destroy his strongest Foe.
Yea he to them a promise makes,
Would they his Laws hearken unto,
The rest of Canaan for their sakes
Should soon become like Jericho.
By this we see what Faith can do.
By Faith they did Besiege the Town,
By Faith they often surrounded it,
By Faith its mighty Walls fell down.
Thus they that put their confidence
And trust alone in God the Lord,
Shall find that he deliverance
Will always unto them afford.
XV. Upon Samson and Dalilah, Judges 16.


MUst Samson have a Dalilah?
Will he that Harlot love?
She Will make him bitterly repent,
A Dalilah she will prove.
To her bewitching Beauty, and
Her charming Tongue was he
So much a Slave, whatever she asked
He nothing could deny.
Who being hired by his Foes,
To know where lay his strength,
She tries her several Arts, and so
Prevails on him at length.
She makes him sleep upon her Lap,
And then she cuts his Locks,
And calling in the Philistines,
They seize on him with mocks,
Thus valiant Samson was betrayed,
And given as a prey
Unto his Foes; whom locked in Chains
They in a Dungeon lay
And now when he designs to act
As he had done before;
It Is but in vain, his strength is gone,
He can do so no more.
Is this the Man, the Champion who
The Lion tore in sunder?
Is this the Mighty Conqueror
Whose Arm destroyed like Thunder?
Is this the Man who only with
The Jaw Bone of an Ass
Destroyed a thousand Philistines?
Yet now a Slave? Alas!
Lord watch, Lord keep, Lord save us all,
Be with us night and day,
When tempted we are apt to fall,
And often go astray.
XVI. Upon Samsons pulling the House on the Philistines. Judges 16.


NOW Samson thou have lost thy Locks,
Next labor to secure thine Eyes,
They Will pluck them out, and then with scorn
Over thee they will Tyrannize.
Thou once their plague, art now their sport,
See what thy crimes have brought thee to;
On thy Religion they reflect
And cry, God Dagon wrought thy woe.
In Brazen Shackles thou do lie,
And forced art to grind their Mill.
Ah! to what misery art thou brought
By yielding to an Harlots will.
Yet O Philistines, have a care
His Locks begin to grow again,
And with them that great strength whereby
So many thousands he has slain.
But over-joyed, that take no thought
Of that. It is a Feasting day
They have him fast, and now resolve
That he to them shall sport and play.
Samson is brought, all sorts repair
To see Blind Samson in the Hall,
Who sometimes stumbles, sometimes falls,
And seeks about to find the Wall.
Between the Pillars they him place,
Where he is scoft at and abused.
It filled his Heart with grief and rage,
To find himself so basely used.
He prays to God to streng then him,
And bows himself with all his power,
He plucks the Palace to the ground,
A thousand slays at his last hour.
Thus died Heavens Champion with renown,
And at his Death more Honor won,
Than by his Glorious Conquests he
Even all his Life before had done.
XVII. Upon David and Goliath, 1 Samuel 17.


WHen Israel against the Philistines
Made War under King Saul,
They had a Giant in their Host
Whom they Goliath call.
He taller was than others far,
In strength he did excel.
He had an Headpiece all of Brass,
And he with Pride did swell.
He marches up to Israel's Tents,
And boldly does proclaim
Defiance to the best of them
That dare at him to aim.
The Israelites were much afraid
And trembled at his voice,
Which made their Enemies laugh and scoff
And over them rejoice.
Thus proud Goliath often does vaunt,
And challenge them to Fight,
But there was none the courage had
To meet this Man of Might.
When David comes into the Host,
And hears the boasts he makes,
He much disdains his Blasphemies,
The Combat undertakes.
Goliath does the Youth despise,
Swears he will have his life,
David as vallantly replies,
His death shall end the strife.
Goliath comes with Sword and Spear,
But David with a Sling,
And though the Giant rage and swear,
David him down does bring.
He only slings a little Stone
And therewith lays him dead,
Which done he bravely marches on
And then cuts off his Head.
XVIII. Upon David and Abigail, 1 Samuel 25.


IN great distress to the Wilderness
Of Paran David fled,
To save himself from furious Saul,
Who close him followed.
Being in want he sends his Men
To Nabal for relief,
But he instead of Food, returns
What added to his grief.
David he calls a Runaway,
And nothing will bestow,
He will not give his Bread and Drink
To Men he does not know.
The young Men back to David come,
And Nabal's words declare,
Who vows his Family to slay,
And none of them to spare.
When one of Nabal's Servants heard
His Master so severe,
He told his Wife, who instantly
The Consequence did fear.
Plenty of Bread and Wine she takes
And unto David goes,
To pacify his wrath and save
Her House from Blood and Woes.
Being discreet at David's Feet
She falls, and favor craves,
Prays he will be pleased to be appeased,
Since God him often saves.
He hears her voice and does rejoice,
She kept him back from Blood,
He up her lifts, receives her Gifts,
And promises her good.
Soon after Gods revenging Rod
Took away Nabal's Life,
Then David sent for Abigail
And took her to his Wife.
XIX. Upon David and Bathsheba, 2 Samuel 11.


When Joab against Ammon fought
King David staid at home,
And on his House did use to walk
Till Joab back should come.
From conquering his Enemies,
One Evening thus employed,
Bathsheba who was very fair
Bathing her self he spied.
Her Beauty proved a snare to him,
He sent, and she is brought,
With whom he folly does commit,
Which him much mischief wrought.
And to conceal his wickedness,
And cover this vile deed,
Her Husband poor Uriah's doomed,
Though innocent, to bleed.
This faithful valiant Soldier
Must be exposed to die,
Lest he his Wives Adultery
Should happen to descry.
Joab must be employed therein,
Who never asks the Cause,
David then takes her to his Wife;
And thus rejects Gods Laws.
Lord if the best of men may thus
So foully sin and fall,
What need have we to watch and pray!
And on thy Name to call;
For thy assistance and thy grace
Temptations to withstand,
That they may never prevail on us
To break the least Command.
Since we observe that one sin still
Is followed by another,
Vainly, like David, men design
The first the last shall cover.
XX. Upon David and Nathan, 2 Samuel 12.


DAvid a while lay quietly,
And thought his Crime concealed,
But foolish Man can never hide
What God will have revealed.
For Nathan came, and in Gods Name
Laid to his charge this sin,
And threatens him, that for the same
The Lord will visit him.
Thou did, quoth he, this secretly,
But I before the Sun
Will show to all how I detest
The Fact that thou have done.
Uriah 's Wife, and then his Life,
Were subject to thy Lust,
And now thy Wives and Childrens death
Shall show that I am just,
Thus says the Lord, I Will draw my Sword
Against thy Family,
And first the Adulterous Child now Born
I do pronounce shall die.
I made thee king, and gave thee Wives
And all thou could desire,
Yea more I would have done for thee,
If more thou could require.
But since mine Enemies now Blaspheme
For these thy evil ways,
Thy House shall have no rest nor peace
Within it all thy days.
Thou do confess thy wickedness,
I Will therefore thee forgive,
Yet to be sure thou must endure
My wrath whilst thou do live.
Thus God declares he will not spare
The best, but them chastise,
Let us then fear him to offend,
For he is just and wise.
XXI. Upon David and Absalom, 2 Samuel 13.


DAvid does still Gods Judgments see,
Now Absalom conspires;
His best beloved Absalom,
His Fathers Death desires.
He first contrived Amnon's Death,
And now invades the Crown,
David's gray Hairs with sorrow he
Will bring unto the ground.
The Politic Achitophel.
In League with him does join,
The Rebels now grow confident
Of carrying their Design.
David flies from Jerusalem,
VVeeps as he goes along,
With covered Head, and bared Feet:
The Traitors still grow strong.
Alas! what shall poor David do?
He calls upon the Lord,
And of him humbly does implore,
He would his Aid afford.
God hears his Prayer, confounds his Foes,
Brings all their Plots to naught.
In rage Achitophel hangs himself,
In his own Snare he is caught,
Joab pursues young Absalom,
Assured of Victory,
And finds him hanging by the Locks,
In The Branches of a Tree.
And notwithstanding David's Charge
He to him should be kind,
He with a Dart pierces his Heart;
The Youth his Life resigned.
Then David mourns for Absalom,
As for an only Son;
Yea, his dear Absolom's Life to save,
Wishes his own had gone.
XXII. King Solomon and the two Harlots. 1 Kings 3.


When Solomon in Peace possessed
The Throne of Israel,
His Wisdom far and near was known,
Most King's he did excel.
It happened two Harlots begged
Of him to do them Right;
Who having heard them plead their Cause
Soon brought the Truth to light.
Both dwelt together in one House,
Each did a Man-Child bear:
One Woman over-laid her Son
In The Night for want of Care.
Then rises up, and in the dark
Does to the other come,
And takes away her living Child,
Leaving her dead in the room.
The Mother wakes, the dead Child finds,
But looking well thereon:
At length she certainly concludes
This Child is not her own.
The other boldly does affirm.
Here Is is the living Child.
The Difference is so great that they
Could not be reconciled.
The King hears all, and thinks this Cause
Affection must decide,
Calls for a Sword, and tells them he
The live Child will divide.
The Mother of the living Child
Fearing it should be slain,
Yields that the other it should have
And thereby makes it plain.
That she the real Mother is,
He it on her bestows,
The King for Wisdom is renowned,
His Name more famous grows.
XXIII. Elijah fed by Ravens, 1 Kings 17.


IN Ahab's Time, great Wickedness
Was acted in the Land;
For which, God now resolves they shall
Feel his afflicting Hand.
Elijah came, and in the name
Of God to him declares,
No Dew nor Rain upon the Earth
Shall fall in full three Years.
Ahab is wroth; the Prophet flies,
And by the Lord's Command,
At Cherith hides, till God remove
The Famine from the Land.
And there (says God) by Ravens I
Thee constantly will feed,
They never shall fail thee to supply
With what thou stand'st in need.
Elijah nothing doubts, but goes
Where God did him advise:
Had we but Faith to trust in God,
We never should want supplies,
Of what is fit, and good for us;
Which this good Prophet found,
Who is so far from wanting, that
He seems to abound.
The Ravens every Morning come,
And bring him Bread and Flesh,
And every Evening do the same,
Wherewith they him refresh.
Thus of the most unlikely means
God sometimes makes use.
Birds, Beasts and Fishes do his will,
They cannot it refuse.
A Lion did with Honey feed
Good Samson; from the Jaw
The Waters burst to quench his Thirst;
All must obey Gods Law.
XXVI. Upon Elijah 's Fiery Chariot, 2 Kings 2.


GOod Man! how weary was thy Soul
of violence and strife.
So great were thy Afflictions thou
Wast weary of thy life.
Thou hunted wast from place to place
Hid in a Den, or Cave,
Because thou did Repentance preach,
And Israel would save.
Then God gave ear unto thy Prayer,
And bid thee to prepare,
Thou now must into Heaven fly;
Thy Heart before was there.
This welcome Message having heard
He goes to Jericho,
And thence to Jordan he makes haste
For quickly he must go.
Triumphantly he marches on,
Elisha does attend,
And all the way the Prophets say
Thy Master must ascend.
When they were unto Jordan come
Elijah smites the Flood,
The Waters presently give way;
All turns to him for good.
When safe got through, Elijah says,
What shall I do for thee?
Ah ( says Elisha) that thy Spirit
Might doubled be on me.
Now as they walk, a Chariot
Of Fire does appear,
Takes up Elijah into the Air,
But leaves Elisha there.
Swiftly he through the Sky does ride
And into Heaven's received,
Elisha having lost his Lord
Exceedingly is grieved.
XXV. Upon the Bears destroying Forty Children. 2 Kings 2.


ELijah gone, Elisha now
At Jericho does stay,
The Prophets Sons persuade him that
His Master find they may.
He them forbids, but they persist
And urge him to it again,
But after three days seeking him
They find it is in vain.
The Citizens then him entreat
He would their Waters cure,
Which he performs, and healthfulness
Does unto them procure.
Then does he toward Bethel go,
But as he past along,
Many young Children from the Town
Him followed in a throng.
And mocking him they loudly cried,
Go up thou Bald-head, go,
He meekly hears them for a while,
Which made them bolder grow.
They still mock on, at length he turns
And sternly does them eye,
His angry words are worse than blows
As they find instantly.
He does them in the Lords Name Curse,
And quickly there appears,
Out of the dismal neighboring Wood,
Two ravenous fierce she Bears,
Who soon do these young Scoffers seize,
And them in pleces tear;
They in a moment forty slay,
While others fly for fear.
Thus these Youths justly lost their lives,
Because they did miscall
Gods Prophet; Ah! Young Men, let this
A warning be to all.
XXVI. Upon Jezebel eaten by Dogs, 2 Kings 9.


KIng Ahab was a wicked Man,
And had a vicious Wife
Called Jezebel; She treacherously
Robbed Nabal of his life.
Because he would not let her have
His own Inheritance.
And prospering in her wickedness
She therein did advance.
The Prophets of the Lord, before
She caused to be slain,
Yea she did strive to Murder all
That there might none remain.
When she her course had finished;
For her Inquity,
And for the Blood which she had shed,
This Jezebel must die.
Out of a Window she is cast,
And falls upon the ground,
Thus Jezebel does find at last
That God can her confound.
Her Blood is sprinkled on the Wall,
And on the Horses falls,
She innocent Blood had often spilt,
Which now for vengeance calls.
The Dogs did eat up Jezebel,
And nothing now remains
Of this proud and ambitious Wretch
But Skull, and Feet, and Hands.
They then that sought for Jezebel
No Jezebel could find,
The rest of her devoured is,
Here Is all that is left behind.
She that in the Morning painted had
Her false bewitching Face,
E're Night by Dogs is eaten, and
Of Burial found no place.
XXVII. Upon Haman and Mordecai, Esther 3.


ESther's Beloved, Wedded, and Crowned,
A Treason Mordecai betrayed,
The Traitors are pursued and found,
Their Lives they for their Treason paid.
Haman the Amalekite by Race,
A Favorite, and in much grace.
His rage to Mordecai expressed,
For his not bowing as the rest.
Unto the King proud Haman sues
For the destruction of the Jews,
The King consents, and in his Name
Decrees were sent to effect the same.
The Jews and Mordecai lament
Their miseries and great distresses,
But Mordecai the Queen possesses
With cruel Haman's foul intent.
Her aid implored the Queen refuses
To help them, and her self excuses.
But (urged by Mordecai) consents
To die, or cross their Foes intents.
Unto the King Queen Esther goes,
He unexpected favor shows,
Demands her Suit; She does request
The King and Haman to a Feast.
Mordecat's want of reverence
Great Haman's haughty pride offends,
Acquaints his Wife with the offense
And asks her Counsel, and his Friends.
The King asks Haman what respects
Becomes the Man whom he affects,
And with that Honor does repay
The good deserts of Mordecai.
The Queen brings Haman's accusation,
The King's displeased, and in a Passion
And for his Crimes, commands that he
Fifty Foot high shall hanged be.
XXVIII. Upon the History of Job, Job 1.2.


SAtan appears, and then professes
Himself Man's Enemy; confesses
Gods love to Job; questions his Faith,
Gains power over all he has.
The frighted Messengers tell Job
his fourfold loss; he tears his Robe,
Submits him to the Almighty's trust,
Whom he concludes to be Just.
Satan a second time appears
Before the Eternal, boldly dares
Abuse Job's tried Faith afresh,
And gains the Afflicting of his Flesh.
Job plagued with Ulcers, grovelling lies
Plunged in a gulf of miseries,
His Wife to Blasphemy does tempt him,
His three Friends visit and lament him.
Overwhelmed with grief, be breaks forth
Into impatience, against his Birth,
Professes that his Heart did doubt
And fear what since has fallen out.
He counts his sorrows, and from thence
Excuses his impatience,
Describes the shortness of his time,
And makes confession of his crime.
Rash Eliphaz does aggravate
The Sins of Job, and his sad State,
Whom Job reproving; justifies
Himself, bewails his miseries.
God questions him, and proves that Man
Cannot attain to things so high,
As Divine Secrets, since he can
Not reach to Natures Secrecy.
God speaks to him the second time,
Job yields his Sin; repents his Crime;
God checks his Friends, restores his Health,
Gives him new Issue, double Wealth.
XXIX. Upon the three Children in the fiery Furnace, Dan. 3


When Israel was Captive led
For Sin to Babylon,
^^^e Youths the King chose, and them fed
With his Provision.
These Children were well-favoured,
Such whom he could discern,
Had Wisdom, Knowledge, and were apt
All Sciences to Learn.
Now among these four Youths there were
Who did the rest excel,
Whom the King Governors did make,
Which Trust they managed well.
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,
Over his Affairs were set,
But Daniel lived at the Court,
And ruied in the Gate.
The King a Golden Image made,
And set it in the Plain,
And whosoever will not worship it
Must certainly be slain.
Yet these three Men do this refuse,
At which the King is wroth,
And does command that instantly
Before him they be brought.
Into a fiery Furnace he
Orders that they be thrown,
But they received no hurt thereby,
They trust in Heaven alone.
One like the Son of God was there,
Which when the King did see,
He calls them forth, and does declare
Their God his God shall be.
He also them restores unto
Their former dignity,
And does command all shall adore
Their God as the Most High.
XXX. Upon Daniel in the Lions Den, Dan. 6.


DAniel escaped the Fire, but yet
Was cast into the Den.
He envied was because he rise
Higher than other Men.
And since they could not him ensnare,
In matters of the Crown,
Of his Religion they complain,
Thereby to bring him down.
They cry, O King make a Decree
And Seal it with thy Ring,
That those be to the Lions cast
Who will not do this thing.
All Men as God shall thee adore,
And unto thee shall pray,
And whosoever does refuse
This Edict to obey,
He shall into the Lions Den
There cruelly to die.
This Daniel knew, and yet did still
Serve God as formerly.
Then to the King they do accuse
Him of Disloyalty,
Because unto the Kings Decree
He dared not to comply.
For this he is cast into the Den,
Of which the King repents,
And for his Servant Daniel
He woefully laments.
The Lions will not touch him, but
Do seem to stand in fear;
Daniel in safety there remains,
(For Daniel's God was there.)
At which the King does much rejoice,
And soon does him deliver,
His Enemies the Lions tear.
God loves his Servants ever.
XXXI. Upon the History of Jonah, Jonah 1. 2.


THE Word of God to Jonah came,
Commanded Jonah to proclaim
The vengeance of his Majesty
Against the Sins of Nineveh.
But Jonah toward Tarshish went,
A Tempest does his course prevent,
The Mariners are sore oppressed
While Jonah sleeps and takes his rest.
The Pilot thumps on Jonah's Breast,
And rouzeth Jonah from his rest.
They all cast Lots, being sore affrighted,
The Sacred Lot on Jonah lighted.
They question Jonah whence he came,
His Country and his Peoples Name,
He makes reply; they moan their woe,
And ask his Counsel what to do.
The Prophet does his fault discover,
Persuades the Men to cast him over,
They row and toil, but do no good,
They pray to be excused from Blood.
They cast the Prophet over board,
The Storm allayed; they fear the Lord.
Almighty Fish him quick devours,
Where he remained many Hours.
Within the Belly of the Whale
He does his misery bewail,
God hears his Prayer, at whose command
The Fish out casts him on the Land.
The second time was Jonah sent
To Nineveh; now Jonah went,
Against their crying Sins he cried,
And their Destruction prophesied.
The Ninevites believe his Word,
Their Hearts they turn unto the Lord,
In him they put their only trust,
Since he is both Merciful, and Just.
XXXII. Upon the Prodigal Son, St. Luke 15.


TWO Sons unto a certain Man
Were Born; with whom they live
Until they were grown up; but then
The youngest seems to grieve.
That he must always dwell at Home,
Therefore abroad will he,
Let me, says he, my Portion have,
I Will Travel presently.
His Father, though unwillingly,
Unto him does consent,
Who taking all his Goods with him
To a far Country went.
Where he with Riot soon does waste
All that with him he brought,
Women, and Wine, and Gluttony
His Ruin quickly wrought.
And which did much increase his woe,
A Famine in that Land
Then happened, which caused him
In want of Food to stand.
Yet if in this necessity
On Husks he could have fed,
It may be he would never have thought
Of coming Home for Bread.
But hunger forced him to recall
His Fathers House to mind,
Then Home he goes, and after all
He finds his Father kind.
With Kisses, Robe, with Shoes and Ring,
And Musicks lofty strain,
With the fatted Calf, and all good things,
He does him entertain.
And pleads that so it ought to be,
None should of it complain,
For this my Son was dead, says he,
And is alive again.
XXXIII. Upon Dives and Lazarus, St. Luke 16.


DIves was blessed with happiness,
But Lazarus was poor;
Dives lives high, but Lazarus
Does beg from door to door.
The very worst of Dives Slaves
Fared better far than he,
Whose Clothes were Rags; he nothing has
But Sores and Misery.
At Dives Door Lazarus begs
Only some Crumbs of Bread
Which from his Riotous Table fell,
Wherewith he might be fed.
At length both on their Death beds lie,
And both now equal seem,
But after death, Dives is vile
And Lazarus in esteem.
The Beggar goes to Heaven, and there
In Abraham's Bosom lies.
The Rich Man is in Hell, and there
Though dying, never dies.
From whence he Lazarus sees, and does
Of Father Abraham crave,
He would send Lazarus back again
His Brethren to save.
Yea being in great misery
He humbly does entreat,
A drop of Water for to cool
His Tongue inflamed with heat.
But this his cry, and strange request
Abraham does now reject;
Upon his former Luxury
He bids him to reflect.
Remember Son, says he, that then
Thou good things did enjoy,
But Lazarus evil, therefore now
He reaps Eternal Joy.
XXXIV. Upon the death of Ananias and Saphira, Acts 5.


THese two dwelt in Jerusalem,
And did the Faith profess
Yet these two lost their Lives because
They acted wickedness.
They come and deal deceitfully
Before the Lord of Hosts,
Yea they presume to tell a Lie
Unto the Holy Ghost.
For selling their Possession, they
Part of the price kept back,
It may be they were covetous,
And feared themselves should lack.
And then they falsely did affirm
They nothing did retain,
Thinking St. Peter to deceive,
But found it was in vain.
He soon discovers the deceit,
And plainly does declare,
Satan had filled their Hearts with Lies,
'Cause God they did not fear.
To them his word was like a Sword,
He need do nothing more;
Vengeance o'retakes them; and they dead
Are carried out of door.
Great fear from hence falls upon all,
They the Apostles dread,
Since God even by their word alone,
So soon strikes sinners dead.
Let this a warning be to all
That they avoid a Lie,
But speak the truth in righteousness,
And in sincerity.
Lest such a sudden dismal Fate
Do unto them befall,
As unto these two happened,
God's Justice can reach all.
XXXV. Upon the Stoning of St. Stephen. Acts 6, 7. Chapters.


STephon was a Man of mighty Faith,
Who many Wonders wrought,
The Doctrine of Christ his Lord
With Power the People taught.
His Spirit and Wisdom was so great
He his Opposers foiled,
Which made them so malicious they
Would not be reconciled.
False Witnesses they then set up
His Life a way to take,
Who swear; that he blasphemously
Against the Law and Temple spoke.
He to the Councel's led by those
Who against him did combine,
His Face when he began to plead
Did like an Angels shine.
Having their leave; he then begins,
And shows how God did lead
Of old his people Israel,
And them delivered.
But coming close, and charging them
With guiltless Blood; they cry
Out all at once; Let Us him condemn
For he shall surely die.
Mean while he looks up steadfastly
To Heaven; and there sees stand
The Son of Man in glory great
Placed at Gods right hand.
Out of the City then he is cast,
And stoned till he dies,
But Stephen even to the very last
Like a true Martyr cries,
Lord lay not to their charge this sin,
My Soul receive and keep.
He gained the Crown of Martyrdom,
And then he fell asleep.
XXXVI. Upon St. Paul 's Shipwreck, Acts 26, 27. chap.


SAint Paul was sailing unto Rome,
When lo a storm arose,
Which was so fierce and violent,
They could it not oppose.
The Men were much affrighted, since
They saw no hope at all,
They fear destruction on them will
Inevitably fall.
St. Paul them comforts, and assures,
Though they in danger are,
Yet all shall save their Lives, for so
God did to him declare.
The storm more furious grows, and all
Their labor does confound,
At length the Ship in pieces breaks,
By being run a-ground.
Each Man then for himself shifts; so
By skilful swimming, and
The broken pieces of the Ship,
They all come safe to Land.
Having this danger thus escapt,
They are on Malta thrown,
And there by the Inhabitants,
Much kindness had them shown.
But when St. Paul had gathered sticks
To make a Fire at Land,
A Viper came out of the heat
And fastened on his Hand.
Whereat the people look on him
As he a Murderer were,
Who though he had escaped the Sea,
Yet vengeance followed there.
But when they did observe that he
Received no hurt thereby,
They quickly change their minds; and now
He is a God, they cry.
Upon Death.


CAn he be counted Fair
Who withers at a blast,
Or he be Strong, one breath of wind
Into the Grave can cast?
Can he be counted Wise
Who knows not how to live,
Or can he be a Rich Man called
Who nothing has to give?
Can he be reckoned Young
That Is feeble, weak and wan?
So Fair, so Strong, so very Wise,
So Rich, so Young is Man.
So Fair is Man, that Death
Even with one parting blast,
Blasts all his fair and dainty Flowers,
And makes him Earth at last.
So mighty Strong is Man,
That with a gasping Breath,
He totters, falls, and then bequeaths
His boasted strength to Death.
So Wise is man that if
With Death he once do strive,
His Wisdom never can him teach
How he one Hour shall live.
So Rich is Man that when
He once his debts has paid,
His Wealth's his winding sheet wherein
Even he himself is laid.
So Young is Man that when
He Is broke with care and sorrow,
He Is old enough this very day,
That he may die to morrow.
Why brag'st thou then, thou Worm
Who art but five Foot long?
For thou art neither Fair nor Strong,
Nor Wise, nor Rich, nor Young.
Upon Judgment.


THE dreadful Trump shall blow,
The Dead awaked shall rise,
And then unto the Clouds they all
Shall turn their wandering Eyes.
The Heavens shall opened be,
The Bridegroom forth shall come
To Judge the World, and to bestow
On all the World her Doom.
Joy it shall be to the Just,
To the Wicked endless smart,
To those the blessed voice bids, Come,
To these it bids, Depart.
Depart you must from life,
Yet dying live for ever;
For ever you will dying be,
And yet you will die never:
Depart from me like Dogs,
With Devils take your Lot,
Like Devils all depart from me
Because I know you not.
Like Dogs, like Devils go,
Go cry, and howl, and bark,
Depart and into Darkness fly,
Because your deeds were dark.
Let yells and roarings be
Your Music; and your Food
The Flesh of Vipers and of Toads;
Your Drink shall be their Blood.
Let Devils you afflict
With scorn, reproach and shame,
Depart, depart away from me
Into Eternal Flame.
If Hell the Portion then
Of wretched sinners be,
O Lord give me my Hell on Earth,
Lord give me Heaven with thee.
Upon Heaven.


WHen I do contemplate
The New Jerusalem,
Wherein there is reserved for me
My Crown, my Diadem.
Oh! what a Heaven of Bliss
My Soul by this enjoys,
All on a sudden I am wrapped
Into the Heaven of Joys.
Where there are Troops of Powers,
Of Virtues, Cherubims,
There Angels and Archangels are
With Saints and Seraphims.
Who still are singing praise
Unto their Heavenly King.
Their Songs and Hallelujahs they
For ever to him sing.
Where joys are full and pure,
And are not mixed with mourning,
Where they continue without end
From which there is no returning.
No Theft nor Cruelty,
No Murder harbors there,
No hoary headed Care afflicts
Nor yet no sudden Fear.
No pinching Want is there,
No griping fast Oppression,
Nor Death which is the just reward
Of the first Man's transgression.
But dearest Friendship, Love,
And Everlasting Pleasure,
Do there abide continually
Without decay, or measure.
Fullness of Riches, Joy
And Comfort sempiternal
Excess, yet without surfeiting,
With Light, and Life Eternal.
Upon Hell.


HEll is beyond all thought,
A state sad and forlorn,
No mortal Man can here relate
The Pangs that there are born.
These Burnings cannot be quenched,
No not with tears of Blood,
No mournful groans, nor doleful sighs
Will here do any good.
Nay all that can be said,
TO express the pain of those
In Hell, comes short; they are enwrapt
In Everlasting woes.
For Time there finds no end,
And Plagues find no exemption,
Their cries admit no help, for from
That place is no redemption.
Where Fire lacks no Flame,
Therewith the Flame to heat,
To make their torments more severe,
Their miseries to complete.
Where wretched Souls for ever
To tortures bound shall be,
Where they shall serve a world of years,
Yet never shall be free.
Where nothing's heard but yells
And groans, and woeful cries,
And where the Fire never abates,
The Worm there never dies.
That Worm which ever gnaws
And tears their Bowels out:
The Pit upon them shuts its Jaws;
It Is terrible no doubt.
But where this Hell is placed,
My Muse must needs stop there;
Lord show us what its horror is,
But never show us where.
Scripture Hymns and Songs upon several Occasions, turned into Common English
Verse. With some others.
The Song of Moses, when Pharaoh and his Host were Drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus 15. Then sang Moses and the Children of Israel this Song unto the Lord,
and spoke, saying.
I To the Lord will sing, for he
Triumphed in Glory so,
The Horse he and his Rider down
Into the Sea did throw.
The Lord's my Strength and Song, and he
Is my Salvation,
My God he is, I Will him prepare
An Habitation.
My Fathers God he is also,
I will exalt his Fame,
The Lord he is a Man of War,
Jehovah is his Name.
He Pharaoh's Chariots and his Host
Into the Sea has cast,
And his choice Captains Drowned were
At in the Red Sea they past.
The depths them hid, to the bottom they
Sunk down even as a Stone,
Jehovah thy Right Hand in power
Most glorious is alone.
Lord thy Right Hand in pieces dashed
Those that against thee rose,
And in thine Excellency Great
Thou have overthrown thy Foes.
Thou did send forth thy wrath, which as
The stubble did them waste,
Together gathered were the waves
Even with thy Nostrils blast.
The Floods stood upright as an heap,
The depths in mid-sea rose,
The Foe said, I Will pursue, I Will catch,
I will the spoil dispose.
My Lust on them shall filled be,
My Sword draw out will I,
My Hand shall them again possess,
Or spoil them utterly.
Thou with the wind did on them blow,
The Sea them covered,
They in the mighty waters sunk
As if they had been Lead.
Lord who is like thee among the Gods?
Who Is like thee? glorious
In holiness, fearful in praise,
In doings mavelous.
When thou did forth thy Right Hand stretch
The Earth them swallowed,
The people whom thou have Redeemed
Thou have in Mercy led.
Thou by thy strength shall guide them to
That Holy Seat of thine,
The Folk shall hear, and fear, and grieve
Shall they of Palestine.
Then Edom's Dukes shall be amazed,
And Moab's mighty men
Trembling shall seize; away shall melt
All Canaan's dwellers then.
Fear upon them and dread shall fall
By thy Hands mightiness,
They shall lie still as does a Stone
Until the People pass.
Until thy People Lord shall pass,
Which thou have purchased,
Till thou have them brought in, and in
Thy Mount established.
The Mount of thine Inheritance,
O Lord, the place wherein
Thou have prepared thy Sanctuary
For thee to dwell therein.
Lord, which thy Hands established;
Jehovah he shall Reign
For evermore, through Ages all
For ever Sovereign.
For Pharaoh's Horse and Chariots,
And Horsemen down they went
Into the Sea; Jehovah then
The Sea upon them sent.
The waters of the Sea on them
He turned back in haste,
But on dry Land in the midst of the Sea
The Sons of Israel past.
And Miriam answered them,
Sing to the Lord for he excels
In glorious renown,
He has the Horse and Rider both
Into the Sea cast down.
Samson 's Triumph over the Philistines, when he had slain a thousand with the
Jaw Bone of an Ass.
SAmson rejoice, be filled with mirth,
Let all Judea know,
And tell the Princes of the Earth
How strong an Arm have thou.
How has thy dead inricht the Land,
And purpl'd over the Grais,
Thou had no weapon in thy Hand
But the Jaw Bone of an Ass!
How does thy strength and high renown
The glory of men surpass,
Thine Arm has struck a thousand down
With the Jaw Bone of an Ass!
Let Samson's glorious name endure
Till time shall bring forth One,
Whose greater glory shall obscure
The glory thou have won.
David 's Lamentation over Saul and Jonathan.
And David lamented with this Lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his Son.
2 Samuel 1.19.
THE Beauty of Israel is slain
Upon the places high.
How are the Mighty fallen down?
In Gath this never cry.
Nor tell't in Streets of Askelon
Lest Philistines rejoice,
Lest Daughters of the uncircumsised
Make a triumphant noise.
Ye Mountains high of Gilboa,
Let there be never Dew,
Let neither Rain, nor Fields again
Of Offering be on you
For there the mighty One his Shield
Received disgraceful foil.
The Shield of Saul as he had not
Anointed been with Oil.
The Bow of Jonathan turned not
Back from the Blood of the slain,
From fat of the Mighty; and Readiness Sword
Returned not in vain.
Lovely and pleasant in their Lives
Were Saul and Jonathan,
And in their death, and latest breath
Was no division.
They swifter were than Eagles far,
They Lions did excel
In strength. O weep ye over Saul,
Daughters of Israel.
Who did in Scarlet you array
With deckings manifold.
Who did on your Apparel lay
Rich Ornaments of Gold.
O thou, my Brother Jonathan,
I am distressed for thee,
A pleasant, kind Companion
Thou have been unto me.
Thy love to me was wonderful
Past that of Women far,
How are the Mighty fallen? and how
Are lost the Men of War.
The Prayer of Jonah to the Lord his God, out of the Whales Belly. Jonah 2.
I to the Lord in my distress
Did cry, and he gave ear,
Out of Hells Belly cried I,
And he my voice did hear.
Into the deep, in the midst of the Sea
O Lord thou did me cast.
The Floods me compast, all thy Waves
And Billows over me past.
Then did I say, I utterly
Cast from thy sight remain,
Yet to thy Holy Temple I
Will once more look again.
The waters even to the Soul
Did me incompass round,
The depths me round enclosed, the weeds
About my head were bound.
To the Mountains bottoms I went down,
Earths Bars did me beset,
Yet Lord my God, thou broughtest my life
Up from corruptions Pit.
When as my Soul did faint in me
The Lord remembered I,
Even then my Prayer came unto thee
Into thy Sanctuary.
They their own mercies leave, that do
Mind Lying Vanities,
But with the voice of giving thanks
To thee I Will Sacrifice.
The thing the which I vowed have
To pay I will accord,
Because alone Salvation
Proceeds from the Lord.
Conclusion.
O Holy, Holy, Holy Lord,
The Almighty God alone,
Which was, and is, and is to come,
Who sit on the Throne.
Thou Glory, Honor, and great Power
Lord, worthy art to take,
For thou made all, they are and were
Made for thy pleasures sake.
A Poem upon Death and Judgment.
THE Day of wrath that dreadful day,
Shall the whole World in Ashes lay,
As both the Psalms and Sybils say.
What horror will distract your mind,
When the strict Judge who should be kind,
Shall have few venial faults to find?
The last loud Trumpets wondrous sound
Shall through the cleaving Graves rebound,
And wake the Nations underground.
Nature and Death shall with surprise
Behold the Conscious wretches rise,
And view the Judge with frighted Eyes.
Then shall with Universal dread
The Sacred Mystic Roll be read,
To try the Living and the Dead.
The Judge ascends his awful Throne,
But when he makes all secrets known,
How will a guilty Face be shown?
What Intercessor shall I take,
To save my last important stake,
When the most Just has cause to quake?
Thou mighty formidable King,
Mercy and Truths Eternal Spring,
Some charitable pity bring.
In Storms of guilty Terrors lost,
Forget not what my Ransom cost,
Nor let my dear bought Soul be lost.
Thou who for me have felt such pain,
Whose precious Blood the Cross did stain,
Let not thy Death and Birth be vain,
Thou whom avenging Powers obey,
Remit my Debt, too vast to pay,
Before the last accounting day.
Surrounded with amazing Fears,
Whose load my Soul with anguish bears,
I sigh, I weep, accept my Tears.
Thou who wast moved with Mary's Grief,
And by absolving of a Thief,
Have given me Hope, Oh! give Relief.
Reject not my unworthy Prayers,
But free me from those dreadful Snares,
That hungry, gaping Hell prepares.
Oh! let thy Blood my Crimes Efface,
And fix me with those Heirs of Grace,
That thou do on thy Right Hand place.
From that Portentous vast Abyss,
Where Flames devour and Serpents Hiss,
Call me to thy Eternal Bliss.
Prostrate, my contrite Heart I rend;
My God, my Father and my Friend,
Do not forsake me in my end.
Well may they Curse their second Breath,
Who rise to a severer Death.
Thou Great Creator of Mankind,
Let sinful Souls compassion find.
Could we divide a Moment to the Eye,
We should see Life the Moment that we die,
And Faith does fully that defect supply,
For though my Body Dies, it is not I.
FINIS.
