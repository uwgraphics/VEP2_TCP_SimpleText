Die Martis 3 Maii 1642.
ORdered by the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled; That the Persons
entrusted with the ordering of the Militia of the City of London, shall have
power to draw the Trained Bands of the City into such usual and convenient
places within three miles of the said City, as to them from time to time shall
seem fit, for the training and exercising of the Soldiers; and that the said
Soldiers upon Summons shall from time to time appear and not depart from
their Colors without the consent of their Officers, as they will answer their
contempt to the Parliament.

Joh. Brown Cler. Parliam.
