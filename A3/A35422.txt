YORK: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty:
And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

THE DECLARATION of the Right Honorable Henry Earl of Cumberland, Together
with diverse Gentlemen of the County of York, who desire it may be put in print,
and published in all the Parish Churches of this County.
WHereas it appears, That some Gentlemen of this County, have given
information to one of the Members of the House of Commons, of many great
oppressions exercised upon His Majesty's Subjects here, And that a Tyrannical
government is founded, under pretense of His Majesty's service; and have
thereby, and upon that misinformation, drawn a Declaration from the Lords and
Commons, bearing date the twentieth of August instant, to be published to the
people, which is grounded upon those, and diverse other false informations: We
hold it our duties to the Honorable Houses, to the satisfaction of the County,
and vindication of our own honors and integrity herein, to declare, That we
are so far from being contrivers, or Instruments of Arbitrary Government or
Tyranny, or doing any Act, whereby the Country may receive loss, or suffer
violence, That all our endeavors shall tend to no other end, then to assur^ it
from spoil and rapine, and to protect every person therein, (as far as we
can) from injury and oppression.

To the better advancement of which good desires and resolutions, the Grand
Jury (the representative body of this County) at the Assizes last holden,
presented their humble requests to His Sacred Majesty, and received thereunto
His Gracious approbation: And thereupon some progress has been made, and
resolutions taken, aiming only at the tranquillity of this County, and at no
other end or purpose whatsoever: And if any have, or do mis-understand those
propositions, or wrest them to any other sense then they were intended, they do
it without any ground at all. For we profess, That we have not gone about to
conceive, or act any thing, for sinister or by respects, but only for the
benefit and peace of the County in general, and of every particular Person
therein; and that we conceive our doings, warranted by the Law of Nature and
Necessity, and Authorized by a former order of Parliament, which declares, That
such Counties as put themselves in a posture of defense, have done nothing but
what is justifiable: And in pursuance whe^^of, and agreeing upon the like
Resolutions and Propositions to these, we have formerly received approbation,
and public thanks from the House of Commons.

We do therefore further unanimously publish to all lovers of Peace, That we
neither have, nor will do any act, or acts of other nature, or tending to other
consequence, then those formerly agreed on in this County, upon the like
occasion, by the Justices of Peace, the eight and twentieth of January last,
and for which, we, by order from the House of Commons, received thanks the
first of February following. As also, That we will not go about to take the
Arms of any honest Gentlemen, Yeomen, or Townsmen, as we perceive is falsely
misreported to the House, we having Our selves hitherto done no such thing, nor
intending as far as in us lies, to suffer others to do the same, unless we be
enforced to the contrary by hostile actions, or pregnant suspicions from the
parties.

We do likewise promise, That we will preserve to our uttermost endeavors, the
peace of the County, and by all just ways, oppose, and bring to punishment all
such as plunder and pillage any person or persons of what degree, quality, or
profession soever in this County.

That we will constantly, and with one mind, aid and assist all his M^jesties
Subjects, to defend them from oppression or violence, and not go about to take
any man's goods, or levy money by force.

These, and no other being our united resolutions, we are confident they will
receive the assistance and concurrence of the whole County, to bring to a
wished effect a work of so much safety and concernment unto us all.

And therefore (according to the Presentment of the Grand Jury, who resolved,
that less then eight thousand, six hundred, and forty pounds, two shillings
six pence, could not perform this necessary work) we have proportioned
(according to ancient and unquestioned rates) the said Sum, and have sent the
several proportions agreed upon, justly rated, to every Parish; not at all
doubting, but that every man's good affection to his Country, and care of his
own well being, will prompt him, with all cheerfulness, to put his ready hand
to such a pious and necessary work, which we desire may be speedily put in
execution in every respective Parish, the people called together by the
Mini^ter, Constable, Chur^hwardens, and Overseers of the poor, or some other
well-affected persons, and the name of those men returned in writing, who do
accordingly pay, or agree to pay their proportions; together wit^ the names of
those (which we cannot believe will be many) who are backward, or deny to pay
so small a Sum, thus laid in balance, with the safety of themselves and their
Country. And if there be any so void of affection to his Country, as to
refuse his concurrence in this affair, of such general and particular
concernment, we shall wash our hands, as guiltless from the consequence of
that crime, and rest satisfied with the conscience of our good endeavors, for
Unity, Peace, and a right understanding, the only way to render this County
safe and flourishing, and every particular person void of fear and mistakings,
and assured of his person, goods, and family.

Since these, and no other, are the determinations of our (by some so much
mistaken) meetings, if any who have not hitherto been present with us, will,
for the time to come assist us, with their company and advice, they shall be
willingly received, as members of the same County, enjoy free liberty of
debate, and receive suitable respect; that so, with united hearts and hands, we
may all join together, to the glory of God, the service of our King, the
preservation of true Religion, and the tranquillity and assurance of this our
Country.

FINIS.
