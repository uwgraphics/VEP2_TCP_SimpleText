royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation Proclaimed in London the ninth of June
Whereas by the Statute made the seventh Year of King Edward the first, The
Prelates Earls, Barons, and ommonalty of the Realm, affirmed in Parliament,
that to the King it belongs, and His part it is by Royal Seigniority straightly
to defend wearing of armor, and all other Force against the Peace, at all
times when it shall please Him, and to punish them which shall do contrary,
according to the Laws and usages of the Realm; and hereunto all subjects are
bound to aid the King as their Sovereign Lord at all seasons, when need shall
be. And whereas we understand, that expressly contrary to the said statute, and
other good laws of this our Kingdom under color and pretense of an Ordinance
of Parliament, without our consent, or any commission or warrant from Us; the
Trained Bands, and Militia, of this Kingdom have been lately, and are intenbed
to be put in Arms, and drawn into Companies in a warlike manner, whereby the
peace and quiet of Our subjects is, or may be disturded: We being desirous by
all gracious and fair admonitions to prevent, that some malignant persons in
this Our Kingdom, do not by degrees seduce Our good subjects from their due
Obedience to Us, and the Laws of this Our Kingdom, subtly endeavoring by a
general combustion or confusion, to hide their mischievous designs and
intentions against the Peace of this Our Kingdom, and under a specious
pretense of putting Our Trained Bands into a posture, draw and engage Our good
subjects in a warlike opposition against Us, as Our town of Hull is already,
by the Treason of Sir John Hotham, who at first pretended to put a Garrison
into the same, only for Our Security and Service.

We do therefore by this our Proclamation expressly charge and command all Our
Sheriffs, and all Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Serjeant-Majors, Captains,
Officers, and Soldiers belonging to the trained bands of this our Kingdom,
and likewise all high and petty Constables, and other Our officers and subjects
whatsoever, upon their allegiance and as they tender the Peace of this Our
Kingdom, Not to Muster, Leavy, raise or March, or to summon or warn upon any
warrant, order, or Ordinance from one or both Houses of Parliament (whereto We
have not, or shall not give Our express consent) any of our Trained bands, or
other Forces, to Rise, Muster, March, or Exercise, without express Warrant
under Our Hand, or Warrant from Our Sheriff of the County, grounded upon a
particular Writ to that purpose, under Our great Seal. And in case any of Our
Trained Bands shall rise, or gather together, contrary to this our Command, We
shall then call them in due time to a strict account and proceed Legally
against them as violators of the Laws, and Disturbers of the peace of the
Kingdom.

Given at Our Court at York the 27 day of May, 1642.
