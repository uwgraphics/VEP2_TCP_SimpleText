March 1.
A Message sent unto His Majesty, by a special Committee of both Houses,
concerning the present dangers of this Kingdom.
Most gracious Sovereign,
YOur Majesty's most loyal and obedient Subjects, the Lords and Commons in
Parliament, do find their just Apprehensions of sorrow and fear, in respect of
the public dangers, and miseries like to fall upon your Majesty and the
Kingdom to be much increased, upon the receipt of your unexpected denial of
their most humble and necessary Petition, concerning the Militia of the
Kingdom; Especially grieving, that wicked and mischievous Counselors should
still have that power with your Majesty, as in this time of Imminent and
approaching ruin; Rather to incline your Resolutions to that which is apt to
further the accomplishment of the desires of the most malignant enemies of Gods
true Religion, and of the peace and safety of your self, and your Kingdom,
then to the dutiful and faithful Council of your Parliament.

Wherefore they are enforced in all humility to protest, that if your Majesty
shall persist in that denial, the dangers and distempers of the Kingdom are
such, as will endure no longer delay: But unless you shall be graciously
pleased to assure to them by these Messengers, that you will speedily apply
your Royal Assent to the satisfaction of their former desires, they shall be
enforced, for the safety of your Majesty and your Kingdoms, to dispose of the
Militia by the Authority of both Houses, in such manner as has been
propounded to your Majesty, and they resolve to do it accordingly.

They likewise most humbly beseech your Majesty to believe, That the dangerous
and desperate design upon the House of Commons, mentioned in their Preamble,
was not inserted with any intention to cast the least aspersion upon your
Majesty, but therein they reflected upon that malignant party, of whose
bloody and malicious practices they have had so often experience, and from
which they can never be secure, unless your Majesty will be pleased to put
from you those wicked and unfaithful Counselors, who interpose their own
corrupt and malicious designs betwixt your Majesty's goodness and wisdom,
and the prosperity and contentment of your Self, and of your people: And that
for the dispatch of the great Affairs of the Kingdom, the safety of your
Person, the protection and comfort of your Subjects, you will be pleased to
continue your abode near to London and the Parliament, and not to withdraw your
Self to any other remoter Parts; which if your Majesty should do, must needs be
a cause of great damage and destruction.

That your Majesty will likewise be graciously pleased to continue the Princes
Highness in these parts at St. James, or any other of your Houses near London,
whereby the designs which the enemies of the Religion and Peace of this
Kingdom may have upon his Person, and the jealousies and fears of your people
may be prevented.

And they beseech your Majesty to be informed by them, That by the Laws of the
Kingdom, the power of raising, ordering, and disposing the Militia, within any
City, Town, or other place, cannot be granted to any Corporation by Charter,
or otherwise, without the authority and consent of Parliament; And that those
parts of the Kingdom which have put themselves in a posture of defense against
the common danger, have therein done nothing, but according to the Declaration
and Direction of both Houses, and what is justifiable by all the Laws of this
Kingdom.

All which their most humble counsel and desires, they pray your Majesty to
accept, as the effect of that Duty and Allegiance which they owe unto you, and
which will not suffer them to admit of any thoughts, intentions, or endeavors,
but such as are necessary and advantageous for your Majesty's Greatness and
Honor, and the safety and prosperity of the Kingdom, according to that Trust
and Power which the Laws have reposed in them.
