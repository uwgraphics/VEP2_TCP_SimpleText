The Blessedness of the Death of these that die in the Lord, and more
especially in ane evil time;

Excellently discoursed in seven very searching, but very sweet Sermons, on
Revel. 14. v. 13.

Wherein, several weighty cases relating to death in General, and to dieing in
the Lord in particular are succinctly, solidly, and satisfieingly handled.

Printed in the Y ear 1681

To the Very much HONORED and Virtuous. LADY MADAM JEAN COKBURNE, Lady to the
Right Honorable Sir ROBERT HEPBURNE OF KEITH-MARESCHAL In East-Lothian, Knight.
MADAM,
WHen I was casting in my thoughts, to whom I should address the dedication of
these, few following Sermons, your Ladyships self readily offered, being a
person to whom I am upon many accounts singularly oblidged, As I am likewise
unto your Honorable Husband; Having also had the retirement and conveniencie
not far from you, for reviseing and making them ready for the Press, which as
you partly know, and as others may conjecture, was not so very easy a piece of
work, considering that they were not taken from the Author's Pen, but from his
mouth when preaching, by one of his ordinary hearers no Scolar, and afterward
transscribed by another person of less Judgment: Your La: being withal a
genuine and undegenerat Daughter of the Ancient, Honorable, and Loyal Family
of Ormestoune, eminently instrumental in our beautiful and blessed, in our
great and glorious, work of Reformation from Popery, and famous (as it is hoped
it will through grace still continue to be, if the like sad occasion, as we wish
it never may, should again occur) for ready and cheerful receiving,
herbouring, cherishing, and incourageing the faithful Servants of God and
Martyrs of Jesus; particularly of renowned Mr. George Wishart, who was thence
taken under trust by the unhappy Earl of Bothwel, now extinct and his memorial
with him (the mentioning whereof, I know your Honorable Husband Sir Robert's
just regaird for the Reformed Protestant Religion, will easily persuade him o
bear with, though he may be, for any thing I know, one of the nearest relations
of that some-time great Nobleman now surviving) while the house of Ormestoune
stands and flourishes still; which Mr. Wishart, I say, was taken thence, and
thereafter most cruelly murdered at Saint-Andrewes, the then seat of Cardinal
Beatton, who in great state and much pompuous pride, looking out of the Window
of his Castle there, now almost levelled with the ground fedd his lustful eyes
with the horrid and pitiful, but to him pleasant, spectackle, of that eminent
Saint and Servant of Christ, his bei^ brunt alive and consumed into ashes: The
measure that Master Patrick Hamiltoune that notable person nobly descended,
having been See Spotswoods Hist. page 52.
nephew by his Father to the Earl of Arran, and by the Mother to the Duke of
Albany (no blood being too noble or precious to be let by these butchers, or
to be sucked by these blood-thirsty leeches) met with at the hands of
Arch-Prelat Beatton Uncle to the said Cardinal, not many years before in that
same place. O! terrible truculent and Tragical actings, yet such as may be
eracted amongst us, if ever (as God forbid) the Roman Antichrist that scarled
colored beast drunk with the blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jesus, shall
again recover his interest in these Kingdoms, now the Kingdoms of the Lord
and of his Christ.

But it may be some care less and unconcerned Gallioos will, for silenceing
and satisfieing us, say that these things were done by Law; As we are told by a
late petulant and profane Pampheleteer, that all these horrid and hideous
persecutions raised and prosecuted against many Protestants in the neighboring
Kingdom of England, in the short but very bloody reign of Queen Mary,
notwithstanding her solemn Professions made to the Northfolk and Suffolk
Gentlemen, and in plain Council, to the contrary; Were according to Law, So
that the Martyrs in her days can no more be ^ounted such, then those who
suffered since the late Popish plot; (above 200. of whom, being in all but 277,
according to his reckonings, (though he reckons amiss) were, as he falsely
and impudently alleges, executed as profligat persons, speaking this
malicious and grossly calumnious lie purely out of his own, in exact imitation
of the Father of lies; for famous Mr. Fox that indefatigably laborious searcher
after all occurrents of that nature, gives us no such account; of whose exact
scrutiny in the sufferings of the Martyrs under Queen Mary, ingenuo^ and
impartial Master Fuller speaking in his ecclesiastical History, says; This
point has been handled already so curiously and copiously by Mr. Fox, that his
industry herein has starved the endeavors of such as shall succeed him,
leaving nothing for their pens and pains to feed upon; for what can the man
do that comes after the King? But that which has been already done, and Mr.
Fox appearing sole Emperor in this subject, all posterity may despair to add
any remarkable discoveries which have escaped his observation, wherefor to
handle this subject after him, is to light a candle to the Sun; and further
according to his commendable candor, he adds, as if it had been in designed
contradiction to this Detractor, And now to take our leaves of these Martyrs,
what remains but -- that we embrace and defend that doctrine which they sealed
with their lives, and as occasion shall offer, to vindicat and assert their
memories from such scandalous tongues and pens, as have or shall traduce them;
Neither does Doctor Burnet, in his late History of the Reformation of the
Church of England, give us any such account; Nay neither Speed nor Baker, whom
he most injuriously voucheth for his Authors of this calumny, hint any such
thing): But the man has forgotten, or would not remember, that there have
been, may be, and still are in the world, thrones of iniquity which establish
mischief by a Law, wherewith God, the great Lawgiver, has no fellowship; And
that the primitive Christian Martyrs, who were most cruelly put to death by
the persecuting PaganRoman-Emperours, particularly by Trajan, Hadrian, the
Antonins and Severus, were so dealt with by them, according to the Then-lawes of
the Roman Empire; for which reason, it is very probable that John the Divine in
the Revelation, brings in some of these persecutors with a pair of balances in
their hands, insinuating thereby, that they pretended to weigh and measure out
their persecutions of Christians, by exact Justice according to Law: Who are
therefore no more to be accounted Martyrs; Nay, all that have suffered most
exquisit torments and cruel deaths on the account of the Protestant Religion,
not only in Scotland and England, but in France, Germany, the Low countries,
and elsewhere since the beginning of the Reformation, and our forsakeing the
Apostate Church of Rome: and in Toulouse, Bohemia, the Valleys of Piedmont,
and in other parts of the Christian World before that time, for that very same
Religion, tho not under the denomination of Protestant, must needs according to
the new doctrine of this pretended protestant Author, be dashed out of the roll
and catalogue of the Martyrs of Jesus Christ; because forsooth, they were
generally put to death by and according to the laws of the respective
Countries wherein they suffered, tho these humane Laws were framed on the
matter in contempt and defiance of divine Laws to the contrary. And yet we
need neither wonder nor strange to find this man basely bespattering, as so
many profligats, the Protestants who suffered in Queen Mary's days, and
ranking them almost in the same class and category, and setting them near by on
the same level with the Papists, that were lately executed for their accession
to the horrid and hellish plot, and denying the former to have been Martyrs
more then the latter; who roundly and boldly in the face of the reformed
Churches dar assert, that all the difference betwixt the Popish and Protestant
Religion is, in modes and circumstances, and no more in reality; and that the
Laws which established the Protestant, and abolished the Popish Religion,
cannot be otherwise altered but by ane equal power with that from whence they
had their being, King and Parliament, who by aggreeing, no more prejudge the
public in order to Heaven, then they did before, that being only accidental
and extrinsecal to the substance of Religion, by which alone, and not by forms
or ceremonies, men are to be saved. What? are there no material and highly
momentuous doctrinal differences betwixt Papists and Protestants? As about the
Pope his arrogantly claimed and Usurped universal, Civil, and Ecclesiastic
supremacy, whereby he takes on him to transfer Kingdoms, to depose Kings and
Emperors, and to loose subjects from their sworn alleadgences to them; to
interdict as to all sacreds, and on the matter to excommunicat, not only
particular persons the greatest crowned heads not excepted, but wholl Christian
Kingdoms at his pleasure, none being warranted to say, what, or why do thou?
And all this as Christ's Viccar on earth, whereas indeed he is the Arch-enemy of
Christ, even that Antichrist to whom all his characters assigned by the
Apostles Paul and John, do most exactly and punctually aggree. About his
fondly fancied infallibility, times and ways out of number to the conviction
of the World, not only fallibilized, but grossly falsified and belied; as for
instance undenyably appears in a matter of very great moment, to wit, the
different translation of the old vulgar latin Bible by Pope Sixtus the fifth,
and by Pope Clement the eight, some three years only interveening betwixt the
one and the other See Mr. Thomas James his Bellum Papale, and his Defense
thereof.
; each of which translations, is in the preface or bull thereto prefixed,
declared to be authentic and obligatory of the whole Christian World, to own
the same as such; the printing or publishing of any other translation, being
under the pain of the greater excommunication severly discharged; and yet
these two translations, are not only in a multitude of places, upward of a
thousand, different the one from the other, but in many expressly contrary the
one to the other; so that the Popes pretended infallibility, does infallibly
prove fallible, and falls down flat; for if the one of those translations be
infallibly true, the other must needs be infallibly false, or if they should
still say, which it seems they cannot have the e^rontry to do, that they are
both infallibly true, then their Popes will not only be made infallible, but
(if it did not involve a blasphemous repugnancy) superomnipotent, by
attributing to them a power to make, most really, plainly, and palpably
contradictory propositions true at once (So that we need not henceforth wonder,
that their Canon Law styles the Pope, Our Lord God the Pope); besides that
several of these pretended infallible Popes, have by the published confessions
of their own writers, been found respectivly guilty of grossest Heresy, Simony,
Perjury, Adultery, Sodomy, Necromancy, Sacrificeing to Idols and Devils, and of
other most vile and abominable villainies; yea, their great Champion Baronius at
the year 897; expressly says, that for the space of ane hundred and fifty
years together, the Popes were rather Apostats then Apostolicks, and that they
were thrust into the papal chair, by the power of harlots, and by the violence
of the Princes of Tuscany; which Sandy fundation of alleged infallibility
being overturned, all the rotten and tottering superstructure of his false
doctrines reared up thereon, as so many castles of come-downe, must needs fall
to the ground; It is indeed a wonder that any rational man should have the
confidence to own such a fancy, but a greater wonder that any professing
himself to be a Christian, should make it a grand article of his belieffe, and
a basis of the eternal salvation of his immortal soul; alace! its to be feared
that ane evil conscience cauterized, and some predisposition to Atheism, are
with many, the great inductives to it. About the authority of the sacred
Scriptures, which they will have wholly as to us, to depend upon the authority
of the Church, that is to say at bottom, of the Pope, blasphemously
alleging, that the authority of the Pope is above the authority of the
Scriptures, that no book, nay, nor chapter in the whole Bible, is to be held
for canonical, without the Popes authority, and that the authority of the
Scriptures is no more to be valued then Aesops Fables See Pighius de Hier.
Eccl. lib. 1. cap. 2. Prierius his dialogues against Luther. See Greg. 7. Dict.
in Conc. Romans See Hermannus.
, unless it were for the Testimony of their Church. And about the perfection
and perspicuity thereof in all things necessary to Salvation, which they
endeavor to disgrace, by the impious imputations of imperfection and
obscurity, calling them a Black Gospel, Incken Divinity, and a Nose of Wax See
Pighius ibid. lib. 3. cap. 3.
. About the necessity of unwritten traditions in matters of faith, as
proceeding from the same divine authority, and to be received with the same
divine belief, and under the same pain of divine wrath and damnation, that
the divinely and infallibly inspired Scriptures are; For the Council, or rather
causlesly cursing Conventicle, at Trent, says, that they are to be received
with the same reverence. About the unwarrantablenesse of translateing the
Scriptures into vulgar languages, and of the peoples reading of them, in point
blanck-contradiction to the Scriptures themselves; and whatever be pre^ended,
mainly intended to keep them still in gross ignorance of divine
Scripture-truths, and in utter incapacity to discover, detasse, and abandon
their abominable errors; and how dar the people presume to read the Scriptures?
Since his holiness Pope Innocent belloweth out like a beast this fine
infallible interpretation of that Scripture, anent the beasts not touching the
mountain whereon the Law was given, This mountain (says he) which must not
be touched by the beasts, is the high and holy Scriptures, which the unlearned
must not read: And their Doctors commonly affirm, that the People must not be
suffered to read the Scriptures, because forsooth, We must not give holy things
to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine: such account make these Pastors of the
people, as to rank them amongst beasts even the vilest of them, dogs and swine;
which says, such Pastors are fitter to feed and keep dogs and swine, then to
feed and watch over rational men and women that have immortal souls: And one of
them, Alphonsus de Castro, asserts, that from the reading of the Scriptures,
all heresies come; though this has been ordinarily more through the fault of
learned men then of the common people, and in neither, through any fault of the
Scriptures; They are so mad angry at the translation of the Bible into vulgar
languages, that some of them have boldly belched out this blasphemy, That
peoples being permitted to read the Bible, was the invention of the Devil See
Peresius.
; there is ane English Pamphlet printed Anno 1663. entitled, The Reconciler of
Religions, that has these horrid words, page 41. -- The protestant Bible is no
more the Word of God, then is the Alchoran or Aesops Fables, it is a Diabolical
invention, and a sacrilegious instrument to deceive and damn all such poor
souls as believe it, and therefore worthy to be burnt with fire in the middle
of the merket at noone, and let all the People say Amen, so be it. About
justification by works and inherent righteousness, and not by the imputed
righteousness of Christ; whereby sinners have access to boast and glory, as
being made their own immediate saviors, and to offer a false sacrifice which
God will never accept of, to the great dishonor of the alone Savior Jesus
Christ. About the possibility of not only fulfilling the Law perfectly in this
life, tho the whole Scriptures, the universal experience of all ages, and men's
own consciences reclaim; but of out-doeing the Law, and doing more then it
requires or oblidgeth men unto, by their works of supererogatione; whereby
they think to oblidge God, and to merit from him not only for themselves, but
for others also, and whereby they will needs have the righteousness of one
supererogating Saint, to be imputed to other persons, and hold this for a very
real truth, while in the mean time they flout at the imputation of Christ's
merits and righteousness, as but a putative and merely imaginary thing, so
great is the strength of judicially infatuating delusion. About antiscriptural,
irrational, nonsensical, and monstrous Transubstantiation, whereby they will
have the bread and wine in the Eucharist turned, and that by the Priest when
and as often as he pleases, into the very body and blood of Christ, and so
will have him, whom the Heavens must receive or contain till the time of the
restitutione of all things, to be corporally or bodily present therein, and
that in thousands of places at once, as to his whole body; and so to be chewed
with the teeth, digested in the stomach, and sent forth into the draught of the
profainest wretches that participat of that Sacrament; yea, it may be, to be
eaten by mice and rats, terrible to be once but thought of. And their
abominable unbloody sacrifice of the Mass, offered daily for the sins of the
Living and of the Dead, highly derogatory unto that one propitiatory and
Justice-attoneing bloody sacrifice, offered up once for all unto God by Jesus
Christ the great high Priest, on the golden Altar of his divine nature, by
which sacrifice he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified. About the
Sacraments conferring grace on such as receive them by the very deed done; and
the necessity of a right intention in the administrator of them, not only as to
the fruit and effect, but as to the validity and very being of them; whereby
not only their Opus operatum is overturned, but most things in popery as such,
namely their Transubstantiation, and sacrifice of the Mass, nay the very Papacy
itself (as some of their own noted writers seem to be convinced See Puteanus,
who in 22. q. 1. art. 6. teaches that it is not absolutely of faith, that the
existing Pope (v. g.) Paul the 5th is the true Vicar of Christ, and Successor
of Peter, because it suppons two propositions, Paul is baptized (N. B.) and
Paul is canonically elected, neither of which is absolutely of Faith.
are rendered utterly uncertain; and in truth nothing left certain among them
but this, that there is ane uncertainty of most, if not of all things. About
their halfe-communion, whereby, on most frivolous and foolish reasons, such as
their fear least some of the wine or blood as they call it, should remain on
the Laiks beards or mustachoes, they sacrilegiously rob the people of the cup,
most expressly contrary to Christ's allowance thereof on them, in the divine
unalterable institution of that most precious ordinance, appointed for the
spiritual nurishment of his people. And the absolute necessity of baptism in
order to salvation; whereby all the Children of them who believe no other place
that souls departed go to after death but Heaven or Hell, are for the mere
want thereof, tho neither neglected nor contemned by the parents (for of such
contempt or neglect the infants themselves are incapable) are most cruelly
damned to Hell fire for ever. About purgatory, a mere fable and figment, but
indeed a very serviceable fire for the Popes Kitchine; whereby the alone,
purely, and perfectly purging virtue of Christ's precious blood, is mightily
disparadged. And about the Popes pardons and indulgences (or rather emulgences
or purse-milking and emptying devyces) offered to all who will give money for
them on their saying of so many Ave Mary's, and Pater-nosters, and doing other
such poor, childish, and foolish faites; and manyest to them that give most
money, but utterly denied to those poor wretched souls that have nothing to
give. About their praying publicly in the Church, in a language utterly
unknown to the generality of the common people; whereby he that should be their
mouth to God is a Barbarian to them, and they incapacitat to join with him
understandingly, or to give their assent to what he prays; in plain and
palpable contradiction to what is most clearly and convinceingly discoursed in
the Scripture to this purpose. About praying to Angels and Saints departed, not
without deep and dishonorable reflections on the intercession of Jesus Christ
our alone Mediator. And About praying for the dead, who are by death put into
ane eternal unalterable state, and so set quit without the reach of the
benefit of the prayers of the living. About worshipping of images with
religious and divine worship; which if any of them for shame should deny, their
great Angelick Doctor, Thomas of Aquin See Thomas in 3. q. 25. Art. 3, 4.
will give them the lie, who expressly says, that the same reverence is given
to the Image of Christ, which is given to himself, and because Christ is
worshipped by the worship Latria (which is the highest worship) his image
therefore is to be worshipped with the same worship Latria; he affirms the like
of worship given to the cross of Christ, or the Crucifix of whatever matter it
be made. And on the matter About the obligation of the Second Command, which
because it cannot be bowed nor bended, no not by the plenitude of the Popes
power, to patronize nor in the least to favor their grossly Idolatrous
image worship, they will needs not only break it, but dash it quit out of the
decalogue in despite of the great Law giver, who has so vexed and confounded
them by that Command, that they cannot evite the dint of it; and has involved
them into such a Labyrinth that they cannot extricat nor bring themselves out
of it, no not by the clew of the smalest Spunthreed of their most subtle
distinctions. About the Apostasy of the Saints, and the uncertainty of their
Salvation, the very cutthroats of the comfort that is allowed by Jesus Christ
on them that unfainedly believe in him; and about many more weighty things. Are
all these but Ceremonies and Circumstances in Religion? Can the man be so
grossly ignorant as to think so, or so wickedly prejudicat to say so when he
thinks otherwise? Are all the very substantial differences betwixt
Protestanisme and Popery thus dwindled away into mere Modes, and Circumstances,
Forms, and Ceremonies? And shall we look on the great multituds of
Protestants, who on the sole account of their Religion have been putt to so
many, various, exquisit tortures and most cruel deaths, as a company of silly
shallow-pated ridiculs, rather to be pitied then as paterns to be imitated, who
knew not how to distinguish betwixt the substance and mere modes and
circumstances of Religion, but would needs injudiciously and foolishly throw
away their lives, burn quick, and run themselves into so many extreme
sufferings, for their obstinat adhering to modes and circumstances of Religion,
wherein the substance of it was not at all concerned, nor so much as trench'd
upon or touched? God forbid that we should dar, especially at so high a rate,
to offend against, and condemn the generation of, these righteous persons,
who overcame by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their Testimony, and by
not loveing their lives unto the death; or suffer ourselves to be whidled into
such a sinister and perverse belief of these witnesses and worthies, of whom
the world was not worthy, and that upon the bare and unproved assertions, and
malign whispers, of this truckler after, and trafficker for, Rome; who, yet if
ye will trust him, never was, nor is like to be, addicted to Popery, he is not
sure but he may be, and who I pray that is not over credulous will believe him,
or any other man of his Kidney, that looks at all differences betwixt
Protestants and Papists, as matters of mere Mode, Circumstance, and Ceremony,
but that he will be easily prevailed with, to forgo the one and to embrace the
other Religion, both being in his account the very same for substance, if
especially by the change he may come to a little more substance in the world?

However, since such industrious endeavors are used to disparage, disgrace,
and vilify sufferers and Martyrs for the Protestant Religion, and to make
little and light of all the great and weighty differences betwixt Protestanisme
and Popery, It should alarm, as with sound of trumpet, your La: and all sound
and upright hearted Protestants in Scotland, to rouse ourselves, and by all
suitable, sinlesse, and warrantable ways earnestly to contend for the reformed
Protestant Religion, the very faith once for all delivered by Jesus Christ and
his Apostles to the Saints, (I say the very faith so delivered, because we
reformed Protestants heartily own all the doctrine of faith contained in the
sacred Scriptures, and own nothing as necessary to be believed or practiced in
order to salvation, that is not contained there, either in express words, or
that is not deducible therefrom by genuine, unconstrained, and necessary
consequence) that has been signally sealled from Heaven by the conversion,
edification, and salvatione of multitudes of souls; That has been confirmed by
the sufferings and deaths of many thousands of Martyrs thorrow the world, and
of not a few in these Kingdoms; That faith for which our noble and renowned
Ancestors did so strenuously strive and wrestle, by all lawful means and ways,
that the same might be handed down to us; And which God and they have committed
to our trust and custody as a most precious depositum, oblidging us under all
highest pains, even of his eternal wrath and curse, that we endeavor to
transmit the same inteir and untainted to them that shall come after us; And
that faith which we are withal by solemn ingadgements, taken on before God
and the World, indispensibly oblidged to maintain, profess, avouch, and bear
testimony unto, at any rate or hazard, as we are called to it, It being indeed
the true glory of a testimony, to give it when God calls for it in the face of
danger; Let us therefore be prevailed with, and persuaded by all these and
other such considerations, earnestly to contend for this faith, and to stand
fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, that we be not again
entangled with the yoke of Antichristian bondage. And that we may thorrow
grace, be the better disposed and capacitated to do so; We would endeavor, 1.
Thorrowly to know, and to be well acquainted with, the principles of the
Religion which we profess, that we may be able and ready always, with
meekness and fear, to answer every one that asks us a reason of our faith
and hope; even to have our loins girt about with the truth. 2. We would seek to
be fully assured and persuaded of the infallible truth and divine authority of
the sacred Scriptures wherein our Religion is contained, and that from the
inward work of the Spirit of God bearing testimony thereof unto our Spirits
according to the Scriptures. 3. We would yet more then ever endeavor to
receive the love of the truth, or to receive the truth in love, for the neglect
whereof many have been, and more, if God prevent not, will be, given up to
strong delusion to believe lies. 4. We would covet earnestly to feel the power
and more and yet more of the power of our Religion upon our hearts, captivating
us to its obedience, and mightily influenceing our practice to ane universal
exact conformity to it, that no part nor point of the truth may be detained in
unrighteousness, nor made, as it were, a prisoner of, by setting a guard of
corrupt affections about it, not suffering it to look out and show itself in
our practice. 5. We would study to be and abide near God, not only to make sure
on good grounds, that we who were sometime far off, are now made nigh through
the blood of Christ's cross as to our state, but by all appointed means to
endeavor to draw nigh as to our frame, disposition, and walk, (for though it
be impossible that there can be any drawing nigh to God in respect of frame
where the distance of state remains still, yet there may be, as many doleful
experiences of the Saints put beyond all reach of debate, great distance of
disposition and frame where there is nearness of state) that we may hear this
to be the unanimous voice of all the occurring providence of these days, that
its good for us that we draw nigh to God; It was sure always good but never
better, always necessary but never more necessary then at such a time, wherein
distance from God, usually attended with darkness and deadness, is singularly
dangerous and portends sadly. 6. We would endeavor to have the honor and
glory of Jesus Christ much endeared to our hearts; To have, and to keep up, a
high and superlative esteime of him as transcendently and incomparably
precious, and of the worth and excellency of our Religion, as coming from him,
as conforming us to his image, and as disposing and fitting us for the
enjoyment of him; that in comparison of the excellency of the knowledge of him,
by and according to Scripture-Religion which we profess, all things in this
world, pleasure, profit, and honor, may in our esteime be degraded, and
detruded into the very lowest degree of baseness and vileness, even to be
accounted but as loss and dung; which will not ably predispose to part with,
forgo, and actually to suffer the loss of them, when any of them or all of
them together shall presume to compare or come in competition with the
excellency of Jesus Christ, and of the Christian reformed Protestant Religion:
This is a time, wherein all the lovers of Christ and of their Religion amongst
us, are in ane especial manner called to have such a low esteime of all these
things in this competion, to cry down the market and to let the prices of them
fall, to sit very loose of them, to be very denied to them, and to be ready on
a call to let them all go, when we cannot brook them and Christ and our
Religion together. 7. We would set ourselves down with greater and more grave
deliberation then ever, to count what Christ and our Religion may cost us; And
to this purpose we would cast up (to say so) the Kings Book of Rates, the Book
of the holy Scriptures, that there we may see what all the followers of Christ
are most expressly called to lay their reckoning with the loss of, for his and
the Gospels sake, and what Christ and the very same Religion which we profess,
has cost many of the Saints recorded there; We would also review, as we have
access, humane writings concerning the many various, great, and grievous
losses and sufferings of the Martyrs of Jesus, for him and for our Religion,
that we may thence further see what they have been put to expend on that noble
and non-such account, who yet all reckoned their greatest expense and cost
infinitely below the worth of the cause for which they were put to it; We have
generally hitherto, and that for a considerable time, held and possessed our
Religion at mighty easy and cheap rates, it has cost us but very little; It
may be, yea, its probable that the rates will be raised, that the market will
be up; Which calls aloud on us to sit down seriously and soberly and count the
cost, whither we will be able to finish and go through with our undertaking,
and that thorrow the neglect and defect of such previous deliberat reckoning,
we be not with the surprising and unexpected change and cost putt to give over
in the midest of our work, and so expose ourselves to be the objects of the
scorn and derision of all observing passers-by. 8. We would beleivingly take
Christ's bond and obligation, for his gracious and free compensing of all losses
that shall be honestly undergone for his and the Gospels sake, even ane Hundred
fold in this present time as to what is infinitely better then that which is
lost, and life eternal in the world to come, with the comfortable clause non
obstante persecutione, with or notwithstanding of persecutione, and to show
that he is not complementing sincere sufferers for his sake, by giving them
this his bond for upmaking of their losses, nor putting ane empty spoone into
their mouth, but speaks his very heart to them, he has ordered the recording
or regestrating of it by three of his Evangelists, and in every drawght of it
(which is worthy observation) he has prefixed a grave asseveration, verily;
O! highly valid, good, and sufficient security, given with such sincerity by so
infinitely Responsal a person, whom God has trusted as great Surty and
Cautioner for the debt and duty of all the elect, who can never breck or be
unable to pay his debt; And who is willing his people should beleivingly,
prayerfully, and humbly sue him, in the court of Heaven for implement of his
bond for compensation, and will never refuse the debt, nor will he suffer his
bond to ly untaken up, nor will he take it up till he has completely paid all
that he has most freely become debtor for by his bond and obligation; And
when that shall be done, then sure all losses for Christ and the Gospel, for
true Religions sake, shall be fully, superaboundantly, and to ane infinite
overplus, made up.

Madam, I am the more encouraged to address the dedication of these few Sermons
on this sweet, serious, and savoury subject to your La: that I know you will
read them concernedly, as will also your honorable Husband Sir Robert do, as
being, through grace, more immediately contributive toward his excitment and
upstirring, to make ready for his quickly approaching dissolution, walking now
betwixt threescore and ten and fourscore years, the outmost ordinary boundary
fixed by God in these last ages of the world for the continuance of the short
life of man; I know he reads much, would to God that all the Gentlemen in
Scotland old and young, gave themselves as much, when not otherwise necessarly
and suitably avocked, to reading of profitable and edifieing books as he
does; they might, through his blessing, be much more accomplished both men and
Christians, and a great deal more fitted to serve their generation, according
to the will of God, in their respective capacities and stations. That you both
may be helped of God, to live more and more so as you may have the
well-grounded, lively, and soul-refreshing hope of dieing the blessed death of
them that die in the Lord, who rest from their labors and whose works follow
them, is the very serious desire of

Madam Your La: very much obliged Servant, and hearty Well-wisher in the Lord

To the Christian READER.
Christian Reader.
MAny and various are the vicissituds and changes to which sin has sadly
subjected us poor, transient, itinerary, miserable Mortals, grieving, groaning,
dwining, and decaying nothings; the Reireward of all which changes is at length
brought up by Death, that last, great, and vastly momentuous change, which
putts a final period to all the changes that shall ever befall us in this world;
and whereby every one of us without exception of sex, age, descent, degree,
calling or capacity, will be put into an eternally unchangeable state of
happiness or of misery: If so, then sure it is very sad, and never enough to
be lamented, if it were with tears of blood, that men and women who have
rational and immortal souls endued with a discurring faculty, and capable of
eternal happiness in the enjoyment of God, and of eternal misery in separation
and destruction from his presence, should for most part, so much abstract from
the serious thoughts of that most important change, followed with so long a
train of everlastingly concerning consequents, and in their retired
meditations, take so few turns in this long gallery of Eternity; As if all
that the divinely inspired Scriptures say of it, and that many every day
experience the truth of, were a mere Romance, or cunningly devised fable: And
yet notwithstanding Death is most incontrovertibly certain, all men being by
Divine appointment concluded under a necessity of dieing; which appointment
takes in not only the infallible certainty of the thing, but the determination
of the precise time, when, of the place, where, and of the manner, how; whither
by a violent or natural death, whither by a more sudden and surprising, or by a
more lent and lingering, death: For our times are in the hand of the Lord, the
years, months, weeks, days, and moments of them, with all their incident
changes and revolutions are at his dispose; There is an appointed time to man
on earth, he has determined the times before appointed; the times and seasons
are kept in the Father's own power; our days are determined, the number of
our Months is with him, he has set bounds to us which we cannot transgress:
There is no possibility of circumduceing the day prefixed to the continuance of
our life by his appointment (which is not at all gainsaid by what the Psalmist
says of bloody and deceatful men, that they shall not halve, or live out half
their days, that is, they shall often not live half or near so long as they
might according to the ordinary course of nature, or not half or near so long
as they desired, designed, and expected, or, they shall be cut off in the
throng of their bussinesse, and in the midst of their projects and designs;
nor by that sentence of death of a disease mortal in its own nature, denounced
against King Hezekia, and the addition of 15. years to his life, which imports
only the change and reverse of a tacitly conditional commination and sentence
(as in that against the Ninivits* and that against Abimelech in the matter of
Sarai) but no change at all of Gods purpose and decree, who is not as man that
he should repent*, whose counsel stands and with whom there is no variableness
nor shadow of turning, who had decreed in his eternal purpose the drawing forth
of Hezekias life that length, and had by his decree infallibly ensured the
performance of the condition, to wit, Hezekias praying, humbling himself, and
rouseing up of himself yet more to the serious exercise of Godliness, and his
useing prescribed means for the recovery of his health; Nor is it gainsaid by
any other scripture rightly understood^. So that it seems to be (to say no
worse) Atheologick, and no thing consentient to Divine-Scripture-dictats,
positively and peremptorly to deny that the outmost term and period of this
mortal life is unalterably fixed in the eternal purpose of God: It being very
unreasonable to substract and exempt so concerning and important a thing as the
last term of man's life, or the precise time of his death, which in the
Scripture* is by way of eminency above and beyond all other changes called His
Change, even that whereby he steps over the border of time into eternity, from
the sovereign influence of his decree and of his Providence that does most
vigilantly and accuratly inspect the infrustrable execution thereof; since they
reach the least momentuous and most minute things, even the numbering of our
hairs, and the falling of a sparrow to the ground. Beside, whatever is or can
be said against this, seems with equal strength to militat against the
immutability of the divine purposes and decrees about the everlasting state of
men; and to infer as great an uncertainty of the later as of the former. And
indeed it is worthy Observation that those who most violently maintain (I say
most violently; because I know there are some otherwise Orthodoxe who demurr
in this) that the term of humane life is unfixed, mutable, and ambulatory,
even in the eternal decree and foreknowledge of God, as well as it is
contingent and uncertain in respect of natural and second causes, do also
patronize and peremptorly plead for the mutability and conditionality (for both
come to the same amount) of God's decrees about men's spiritual and everlasting
state, making him either daily to acquire new knowledge, though known to him
be all his works from the beginning, or at least to be doubtful and irresolved
in his purposes till new emergents arising from an uncontrolled and
selfe-governing Free Will cause him take new measures and resolutions: Which is
a doctrine justly exploded by all truly Orthodoxe Divines, as being unworthy
of, and injurious to, the infinitely wise and absolutely supreme Governor of
the World; And as having a tendency (however it may be honested and plaistered
over with specious and splendid pretenses of somewhat else to narrow and limit
the sovereign dominion and will of the infinite Majesty of God the Creator,
that the will of the finit and fecklesse Creature may have the greater scope
and latitude of liberty; which yet is no liberty indeed, nor worthy the name of
liberty; because it is not that wherewith the Son of God makes free: And to
take the crown of the glory of the conversion and salvation of sinners off the
head of free grace, and to set it most sacrilegiously on the head of their own
Lord Paramount Free Will: And in down right contradiction to the Scriptures of
truth, to make poor man proudly boast, that it is not God, but he himself, who
has made him to differ from others; and that he is more oblidged in the Matter
of his conversion and salvation to his own toward, tractable, gentle,
courteous, complyant, and obsequious Free Will, then to God's decree of
election, and the efficacious, omnipotently sweet, and sweetly omnipotent,
infallibly and necessarily will-inclining and determining, though not forcibly
violenting, or compulsorily coacting, influence of soveraignly free grace: If
wantonly curious, superciliously insolent, tumultuantly mutinous, corrupt
humane Reason (ambitiously affecting to take up and comprehend the great
Abyss, the shoarlesse, bottomless, and incomprehensible Ocean of the Decrees
and Providence of God within it is own little and shallow cockle-shellcapacity)
would suffer its self to be sobered and becalmed into a humble and just
consideration of things, all those high and haughty reasonings and debatings
against the unalterable fixednesse of the last term of man's natural life, and
against the immutability of his Decrees in reference to their spiritual and
everlasting state, would quickly be let fall; for then it would easily see the
great congruity, and pleasing sutablnesse that is in subjecting all, and
particularly the rational Creatures being but derivat and borrowed bitts of
being from that first fountain, and original being, that being of beings, in
all the events that befall them, and in all their motions, actings, and
operations, according to their respective natures, entitatively, morally, or
graciously good; And all the adhering^nomies, ataxies, and vitiosities of them;
to the Majesty of the most high God, as to his efficient produceing of the one,
and as to his permitting, bounding, ordering, and directing of the other, to
his own holy and blessed ends; without being justly chargeable with any the
least culpable accession to them; who is, by the most absolute perfection of
his purest nature, infinitely removed from all possibility of being reached by
any tincture or touch of pollution: It would also see clearly the most
profoundly and admirably wise connection, that in these Decrees of God, and in
the execution of them by his all eye-providence, is ordered betwixt the ends,
and all the several midses leading thereto; it being evident beyond all hazard
of rational contradiction, that the boundary of the life of Ahab, and of that
unbeleeving Samaritan Lord who was trod to death in the gate of Samaria, and
of our blessed Lord Jesus himself, was determinatly prefixed, since it was
expressly foretold, as the Scripture clears; And it is simply impossible that
Divine predictiones can prove false; And yet the man that shot at Ahab acted
freely in so doing: Those who trampled that Lord to death were not forced by
any to gather themselves together into such a crowd, or to be so reguardlesse
of a person of honor; and the Murderers of Christ were not a whit the less
guilty, that they did nothing but what God's hand and counsel determined before
to be done, nor yet did our Lord any thing that was irrational or foolish, in
using lawful and fit means for his own preservation, in so frequent retireing
and hyding himself from the jews violence as he did, though as the Scripture
often makes mention, His hour was not yet come; by which instances it is very
clear, that the determinatnesse of the decrees of God, does no ways violent or
infringe the native freedom of the wills of Men, nor yet is it any excuse for
their sin, or encouragement to their neglect of means, since it is by the using
rightly or neglecting of these, that God causes his unalterable decrees to
take their designed effect.

As then it is most indubitably certain, that we must die, so the time for the
continuance of our life and days here, is very short, even but as an
hand-breadth, and our age as nothing before him, our days are spent as a tale
that is told, they are as a shadow on the earth, and there is none abiding;
they are swifter then a Post, they flee away and see no good; they are passed
away as the swift Ships, as the Eagle that hastes to the prey, they are
swifter then a Weaver's shutle; our life is even as a vapor that appears for
a little time, and then vanishes away; as a little warm breath, that is turned
in and out at our Nostrils, which is very easily and quickly stopped. The
precise time also of the expiring of this breath of life is (however to God, to
whom (as is said) are known all his works from the beginning, most infallibly
certain) to us most uncertain; death comes on us ordinarily, in such an hour as
we do not think of; It comes on us as a thief in the night; We are now strong
and in good health, and on the sudden we grow weak and sicken: Now we live, and
by and by we die, and see men no more in the land of the living. All which, to
wit, the certainty of our death, the exceeding brevity of our frail and
brittle life, with the great uncertainty of the precise time of our dieing, do
with one voice unanimously call aloud unto us seriously to mind, and with all
our might to make for an other life; to make sure peace and friendship with God
thorough the blood of Christ's cross; to secure an interest in him (the choice
and wale of all interests, the only everlastingly durable interest, in
comparison of which, all other interests are but petty and inconsiderable, to
which they all ought to cede and give place, and, as it were, to strick their
flag and lower their top-sail) by sincere closing with Jesus Christ on his own
terms, and cordially consenting to, and taking hold of, the Covenant of Grace;
and to live so as it becomes them, who are very certain that we shall die, and
very uncertain how long we shall live: To endeavor thorrow grace to have our
loins girded, to have our affections, as it were, trussed up that they may not
hang down and traile on the earth, and to have our lights burning, not only to
make sure on solid and good grounds that we have a stock of habitual grace,
but to endeavor to have it* lively and vigorous in its exercise, even as it
were burning into a flamme; that we may be as men that wait for the coming of
their Lord, that in whatsoever watch he shall come, we may be ready to open to
him immediately, even at the very first knock, were it on a night's, or a day's,
or an hour's, yea, were it but on a moment's warning, having our house (to say
so) in such order, and the spiritual affairs of our souls so well disposed
of, and in so good a postour and case, that we may not be taken tardy or
napping, nor be on the sudden sadly surprised to our unspeakable prejudice;
even to be in that most desirable and delightful condition, that to us to live
may be Christ, that the very principal scope and end which we propose to
ourselves in desiring life and health, may be the honor and glory of Jesus
Christ; looking at life with all the external conveniences and comforts of it,
as but little valueable and unworthy to be desired were it not mainly in order
to this end: And then we may confidently and comfortably conclude, that death
whenever, wherever, and however it should overtake us, would be gain to us, by
putting a final and eternal period to all the remainders of indwelling sin, to
all tentationes to sin, to all desertion, and to all complaints and fears of
desertion and hydings of God's face; to all doubtings about our gracious estate
and about our interest in God; to all fears of backsliding, and of offending,
or of giving offense; to all trouble, sorrow, sadness, and sighing on
whatsoever account; to all indisposition to serve, worship, and glorify God; to
all interruptions of fellowship with him, and to all fellowship that is but
mediat and in part: To all smful ignorance and imperfect knowledge, or but in
part; These great Theologues there read all their divinity without book, and
without any the least difficulty in that beatifical immediate Vision of God's
face: And by ushering us in to that blessed estate, wherein we shall be
satisfied with his likeness, and that both objectively and subjectively* being
then admitted to see him in himself as he is, face to face, even to full,
immediate, and never to be interrupted fellowship with him; and being
privileged to see him in ourselves, perfectly conformed to his image in
holiness according to Creature-capacity; and put in case to serve him there,
where his Servants serve him as well as ever we desired to serve him in the
best frames we were ever in, and in the best hours we ever had on earth in the
most countenanced public ordinances, or in the sweetest secret duties of his
worship; Nay, which is yet more, where we shall serve him as well as ever he
commanded us to serve him, or shall desire us to serve him, that sure will be
in such spiritually noble state as we never before served him while we sojourned
here on earth. Alace! How few, how very few, how lamentably few are there, even
amongst the great multitudes of professing Christians, of pretenders to
godliness, and to the hope of that gain and blessedness which attends them
that die in the Lord, who make it the great bussinesse of their life to live
thus? even all the days of their appointed time, to wait till their change
come; coveting and crying in prayer to God that he would graciously and
effectually so teach them to number their days, that they may apply their
hearts to wisdom? How many are there that may at their death sadly complain,
as it is storyed of one Similis Captain of the Roman Emperor Hadrian his
Guard* who having lived long in the City and at Court, and having some seven
years before his death retiered himself unto a private Countrey-house, where he
thought, it is like, he enjoyed himself more, being freed from the avocations,
distractions, noise, and cumbersome converse of a Court-life, commanded that
after his death it should be written over his grace, Here lies Similis who was
many years, but lived only seven: How many Professors of Religion are there, I
say, that may thus sadly and sorrowfully complain of themselves when they come
to die, Ah! we have been many years, but have lived either none at all, or but
very few years: For that life that is not lived to God, and to the honor and
glory of Jesus Christ, is not at all worthy the denomination of life, since we
are all the time we live so, but dead while we live: It is astonishing to think
that Reasonable Men and Women professing they have immortal souls, living
especially under the clear light and sunshine of the Gospel, who do not at all
design nor endeavor to live to God, nor to live the life that they now live
in the flesh by the faith of the Son of God, should foolishly fancy themselves
to live, and fondly flatter themselves in a golden dream, that they shall be
well at death, and die in the Lord, and so be blessed with them that die thus;
who rest from their labors, and whose works follow them; who enter into peace
and rest in their beds, every one walking in his uprightness; O! fools
Paradise; O! deplorable and damnable delusion. Who ever therefore would be, (as
all of us are unspeakably concerned to be) undeceived as to this
selfe-murthering and soul-ruining gross practical error and mistake, and
seriously and sincerely desire to live so as they may have the well-grounded
hope of dieing in the Lord, and of being truly blessed at and after their
death; (without which it had been much better for them never to have lived at
all, or to have lived the life of brutes, even of the most abject, vile,
contemptible, and abominable brutes, which when they are dead are done,
annihilated, and gone) Let them diligently peruse, and gravely ponder these few
following Sermons, and pray for the blessing of them; The Design whereof
(excellently driven by the Author, who did most edifyingly and exemplarly, most
convinceingly and comfortably* live and die thus) is to rectify such miserable
mistakes; and to airth right (which he does by a most admirably divine art)
toward the only sure and safe way of dieing happily, which is by living holily.

I doubt not, Christian Reader, of thy having read several other Tractats on
this subject, but I suppose thou have hardly read any more solidly and
succinctly, more pertinently, powerfully, and pungently written, and withal,
more suited to the various cases and conditions of all sorts of Readers, then
this. As for me, while I was revising these Sermons, and making them ready for
the press, I was sometimes, as I still am, made to doubt (I shall not deny but
my little acquaintance with other men's writings may considerably influence this
doubt) whither any ordinary Minister of the Gospel, has readily to this
purpose handled so many notable purposes to better purpose, several of them
surprising, yet all of them clearly dependent upon, and natively consequent
unto, one another, in so few words.

Read then this little Book (which is Mr. DURHAMS, from whose pen or mouth, no
thing has hitherto dropped into the press, that has been unsavory or
unacceptable to the Churches of Christ) again and again, and digest it well,
and I think I may with humble boldness say, that if thou should read nothing
else on this concerning subject but it, and what is written thereof in the book
of the sacred Scriptures, (which in this and all the other purposes treated of
in it, does infinitely transcend all the writings of the ablest and holiest men
in the world) thou may, through God's blessing, be sufficiently instructed
thence, how to die the blessed Death of them that die in the Lord. Now blessed
eternally be our blessed Lord Jesus who by his accursed, but most blessed
Death, has procured all this Blessedness that attends and follows the death
of them that die in him; Who are all blessed and shall be blessed in despite
of the Devil, of the World, and of the Remainder of Corruption dwelling in them
till their dieing day; He himself has pronounced the blessing on them, and
who shall, who dare, who can reverse it? They are all blessed that live and die
in the Lord, and none but they; all true blessedness is entailed upon,
engrossed and monopolized unto, this honorable Society; Not a drahme-weight of
it (to say so) being to be found all the World over beside; Whatever ignorant,
deluded, and befooled men may fancy to the contrary. That thou may be found
associated with this blessed Company, is the earnest desire of

Thy Servant in the Gospel J. C.

SERMON I.
On Revel. 14. v. 13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write,
blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, says the
Spirit, that they may rest from their Labors; and their works do follow them.
THese words are singularly useful, material and momentuous in themselves, and
it is not for naught that the Spirit of God puts such a mark on them, and that
a special commission is given to John to write them; we have therefore thought
it meit to speak a word of them beyond what we can easily reach in the
lecture, they including a truth so very concerning to us even the right way of
dieing and the happiness that follows them that die in the Lord; blessedness
has in all ages been thought of and sought after by men, though alace many
have sadly mistaken it, and the way how to come at it, here is the neirest step
and door to it, even to die rightly and well, and that is to die in the Lord.

That we may a little open up the meaning of the words we would consider that
this verse set down by way of transition coupleth the two last parts of the
chapter together; for when John has spoken of the warneing and advertisement
given to the world by the Ministers of the Gospel, ere he come to denunce
Judgment for despysing of the preached Gospel, these sweet words are
interjected by a voice from heaven, writ says he, blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord etc.

The scope of them then is this, since there were sad and doolfull days coming
and Judgments were like to be very universal after Gods beginning to reckon
for despysing of the Gospel, that he may both set out the greatness and
terriblenesse of the Judgments and comfort the Godly against them, the Lord
bids John writ down this, that none who die in him neids to be affrayed of
them; as if he had said, though these Judgments that are coming will be very
great and though many will be removed and sweeped away by them, and though
withal the coming-calamities will be such that the Godly will be ready to
think them happy that were taken away, yet notwithstanding, all these that die
in me are blessed.

There are 4 things considerable in this verse, 1. A preface, I heard avoice
from heaven, saying unto me writ, importing the weightinesse of the matter
and commission, for it is sent from heaven to John and he is bidden writ it,
its a heavenly message sent by Christ to his Church and even to his Church in
these times and days wherein we live. 2. A plain maxim, conclusion, or
general doctrine laid down as a most certain truth, writ says he,
blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, registrat and record this says
Christ, it hes been and shall be a most infalliblie certain truth to the end
of the world, let never so many confusions come and let Kingdoms be turned
upside down, they are blessed that die in me. 3. There is a qualification of
this truth not denying the universalitie of it, but seeming to apply it as
especially verified in such a time, from henceforth, yea says the Spirit. We
cannot so expone these words as if the meaning of them were, that from the time
of their death they are blessed who die in the Lord though that be a truth, 1.
Because it agries not with the scope, these words being a diversion relateing
to this time, and intended for a peculiar comfort to the Godly against the
evils of Judgment coming in this time. 2. Because it will not agrie with the
particle here used, from henceforth or now, (as it is in the original) to
expone it so, for then it would have been said, from thenceforth, that is from
their death forward; but it is from henceforth, that is now in this sad time
that is coming; and if any should ask what shall be the singular happiness
that these shall have who after this time shall die in the Lord? The answer may
be drawn from the reason that is subjoined, which is the 4 thing in the text,
that they may rest from their Labors and their works do follow them; this
implies a special tosseing and troublesome time coming, and says this much,
that its very good to be in heaven ere that time come; and out of this reason
we may see a threefold respect wherein their happiness that die in the Lord is
applicable to this time, and they do all agrie to the scope. 1. They are freed
from much tossing toill and trouble that the surviving godly would be involved
in who should have a hard and toilsome life of it under the coming judgments
(for the scope is to set out the greatness of the approaching judgments); and
they are happy that are taken away from the evil to come, as Solomon says
Eccles 4: 2. I praised the dead which are already dead, more then the living
which are alive, meaning they are freed from these troubles vanities and
vexations that the living were waited with; they are (as if the Spirit had said)
freed from a toilsome and troublesome world, more so now and at this time then
at other times. 2. They are happy in this respect that now when the Gospel is
brocken out, they die with more confidence, being freed from the fear of
purgatory, being cleir in the matter of their salvation, and assured of their
goeing immediately to paradyse; and this is holden forth in the end of the words
in that it is said their works do follow them; though they have no expectation
to receave any thing by way of merit, yet it shall be well with them who have
kept a good conscience, for they shall eat the fruit of their doeings, as it
is Isai. 3. for though God give not any thing to his people for their works,
yet he rewards them according to their works, so proportioning his proceeding
with them as nothing shall be found to have been done by them for him for
naught; and this is a special part of their happiness, that they shall be
freed from the anxietie that the darkness of these superstitious times kept
men under being now cleired by the light of the Gospel. 3. Compareing this
with verse. 11. they are blessed that die now in the Lord after life and
immortality are brought to light by the Gospel, because they are freed from
the scroching hell that these got who worshipped the beast; now when the light
is come are they not blessed who die in the Lord and are freed from that which
they would have met with if they had not lived and died in him but in
darkness and ignorance of him? And so the words say, that when the Gospel
breaks forth men must resolve to live and die in Christ, or to live and die
in a more damnable condition then the heathens that lived before them without
the Gospel.

In this conclusion or general doctrine we have these three things employed, 1.
Something common to all, and that is dieing, good and bad have that lot, all
must die. 2. That there is a difference in dieing as to some, though death be
common to all, and that is to die in the Lord, 3. That there is a peculiar
effect or advantage to them that die with this qualification, and that is
happiness or blessedness, and these two last imply that there are many who
die not in the Lord, and that consequently they are accursed who neither live
nor die in him.

The general doctrine is plain and it greatly concerns every one to take
notice of it, it were good that this text were engraven in deep and legible
characters on our hearts that we may learn to reckon blessedness not so much
from our life as from our living and dieing jointly together; be what we will
in our life if we die not in Christ there is a great let and mancke in our
happiness, a curse in stead of a blessing, and if this indispensiblie requisite
qualification be in it, it intitles us to this blessedness, O! therefore let
these plain words and the necessity of the doctrine speak home to you.

First then it is employed here that there is a necessity of dying lying on
all, for whill it is said, blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, it says
plainly that there is a sort of dieing that is in the Lord, and a sort of dying
that is out of the Lord, and all sorts of men and women die one of these ways,
as if he had said, would ye know who are indeed happy? Its not all who die, but
such only as die in the Lord; ye know what death is, we need not describe it
to you, and ye are disposed to think that this needs not to be proved that all
must die, and we wish it needed no proof, however see 1. Heb. 9: 27. Its
appointed to men once to die and Romans 5. where it is said, that death has
passed upon all men and that death reigns over all men, verse. 12. and 14. And
2. it is certain from the cause of death, which is sin and Gods curse for sin,
death is the wages of sin, and where sin is as the cause death must be as the
effect, yea 3. it may be confirmed from neir 6000 years experience, wherein
none that have been borne thrughout all generations but they have died; we
speak not of these extraordinar examples of Enoch and Elias who were
particularly and singularly by the soverainge dominion of God exempted from
death, neither will we speak of what the Lord did to them in the place of death
or for putting them in capacity to sustain immortality; Gods ordinary way of
dealing with menis that which we are called to look to, its eneugh that they*
have putt off mortality and putt on immortality though we know not the manner
and way; but look on the race of mankind and ye will find that these who lived
longest died at last as Adam, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Iared, Genesis 5. and
Methuselah who though he lived nine Hundredth Sixty and nine years yet died, and
its said Eccles. 8: 8. There is no man that has power over the Spirit to
retain it, neither has he power in the day of death: and there is no
discharge in that war, neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given
to it; there is no man that has power to keep his soul in his body, there is
no dimission or forloffe in that war, no way to escape death, the profanest man
that putts death furthest off from him shall not shift it; and seeing he takes
it forgranted and all generations have proved the truth of it, we shall insist
no further on the proof of it but come to the use.

Use I. It serves to setle and fix the impression of the truth of this point
deeply upon us, and withal to reprove our living so much from under and
without it; alace we take general truths ordinarlie for granted, but as for
any suitable use or application of them in our practice we live for most part as
if they were untruthes; we live as mortal in respect of seiknesse, infirmities
and fears, but we live as immortal in respect of the stayed thoughts of a
world to come; let me therefore pose you in sober sadness, how often do ye
think seriously of dying? When laid ye your reckoning solidly for it? When
descended ye into your hearts to see how it would be with you at death? how
often have you made your testament this way to say so? and when took ye your
leive and farewell of the things of a world and laid them some way by, on this
consideration that death will make a final separation betwixt you and them?
Take these two or three evidences that ye do not indeed mind death and
mortality. 1. The stupid security we generally live under and our great
unwatchfullnesse says plainly that we do not really mind death, if we were
thinking on death would we be so careless in counting with God and so little
affrayed what will become of the immortal soul, and live as if there were not a
life eternal, and as these of the old world did who eated and drank and never,
to say so, once altered their pace? Ah! Is it not so with the most part now?
Death lights like a falcon out of the air on the most part of men unawar,
because this general truth is not practically believed, there could not be
such deep and senseless security if there were serious thoughts and real belief
of dying. 2. The great earthly mindedness and unsatiable coveting and lusting
after the things of the world as if men were perpetually to abyd with them,
clearly and convinceingly speak out this, believe me, serious thoughts of
dieing would much wean and estrange from these things; men alace seek after a
happiness here in time as if they were to have ane eternal abode in the world,
as that poor rich man in the Gospel did who brutishly said to his soul, soul
take thee rest for thou have much goods laid up for many years eat and drink
and be mirry; if men were on their wing looking for death, sure they would not
thus glutt themselves with these wordlie empty things, hugely disproportioned
objects for satisfieing the vast appetite of ane immortal soul which by its
constitution is elevated to the capacity of an happiness of a higher and more
excellent nature then these things can possibly amount unto; take this then
for a palpable evidence of your Atheism and unbeleife in this concerning
point, and let the thoughts of death come in to bound and moderat your eager
and inordinat persute of the world. 3. The great and intolerable pride and
loftiness of men and women is a demonstration of this, if ye minded death in
good earnest and believed that it were neir even at the door, and that your
breath is in your nostriles, it would make you humble in your walking with God
and in your converseing one with another. 4. Little preparation for dieing and
for the life to come, if there were no more says plainly and undenyablie that
ye lay not death seriously to heart, which if ye did ye would be seeking more
to lay up treasures in heaven and to be flitting (to say so) your affections
thither and toward things above and to be casting your anchor within the veil.

Use 2. In opposition to the former security and stupid unconcernednesse let
me beseech you to mind this more seriously which is so certain and to take
more pains to the prepareing of yourselves for it, eternity is long O vastlie
and incomprehensiblie long, heaven and hell are matters of great unspeakablie
great moment and consequence, when the master or goodman of the house is (to
say so) laid down and has shutt the door there will thenceforth be no
opening; its now your summer, provyde O provyde for your long winter, its ill
thrift to leave that which is of greatest concernment hindmost, and to put over
the secureing of your eternal state till the time of sickness and death, ye
know not if ever ye shall get advertisement by any l^inthened disease; and
sickness will have much to do with itself, neither know ye but ye may be
snatched away in a moment on the sudden, and believe it, its no common thing to
die well, and to have death as the entry and door to happiness.

Therefore to stir you up seriously and timeously to mind dying that ye may
not with the sluggard say yet a little sleep yet a little slumber, and yet a
little folding of the hands to sleep, whereby the fool is slain, consider 1.
that it will not be bare wis^ as that will make you die well, Balaam had many
such wishes to die the death of the righteous and yet was nothing the better of
them, spend not your days idly, triffle not away your time unprofitablie, for
death is always coming on and will not stay and wait for your preparation when
it comes; seek therefore to be found in a watchful and praying frame, blessed is
that servant who when his master comes is found in that postour waiting for the
coming of his Lord and ready to open to him immediately (or at the very first
knock) as it is, Luke 12. verse. 36. O! Strangely Emphatick word! 2. Consider
how few they are who at death are ready and how few they are who at death get
the liberty and blessing to make themselves ready; some I grant as one theife
on the cross finds mercy, that none may despair, yet its but one that none
may presume, but that all may be alarmed to look well and watchfullie to
themselves; many will go to hell no doubt who will seek to enter into heaven
and yet will not be able, a sort of whinging and youlling at death may be in
very godless and Atheistical persons, because they did not begin in time to
seek to enter, as the scope of that parable shows; if ye heard the language
of many in hell. O! How would they to the life preach this point? Bewar of
dallieing and putting off the time, many that are there did ye hear them speak
would readily say. O! That was our ruin and did undo us; but if the word of
God do not affect you, nor work you up to the serious consideration of this
though one should rise from the dead and preach to you, it would not affect you
to any advantage. 3. Consider that the longer ye be of thinking on death it
will be the terribler when it comes, serious and suitable thoughts of death
before hand would do much to mitigat the terror of it, but when death comes
violently and suddenly on you and finds you settled and sitten down in the
world and will needs have you loosed and raised it is in that case indeed as
the King of terrors, whereas if ye were dieing daily and by converseing with
death came to have experience as it were of little deaths before hand, that
would make death itself when it should come much more easy, if especially ye
were dieing to your lusts and Idols, mortified to the world and to the things
that are in it, death should have in that case but little to do when it came;
for it is the cleaving of your hearts to these things and your being glued to
them that makes death so terrible, for it will not tryst nor treat, but
suddenly and inexorablie seperat you and them. 4. Consider the longer ye be a
beginning to mind your eternal state and to think seriously of dieing ye will
have the more to do when death comes; O! There is much work about dieing even
to these who have been thinking on it, how to get faith in Christ right, how
to get themselves rolled on the everlasting covenant for salvation, how to be
in a patient calm and composed frame to encounter the terrors that accompanies
death, how to be weaned from the world and to have their affections heavenly;
sure the longer ye putt off ye will have the more to do and will readily be
the less able to do it; and is it wisdom think ye, to leave your greatest
and most necessary work to your last, weakest, and unfittest time to go about
it? Which yet alace is the lamentably foolish, demented, ruefull, and
soul-ruining practice even of many hearers of the Gospel; there is none of
these things but it must be done before death or not at all; what is in the
bargane or bussinesse then? O what is in it? It Is not ten or tuentie thousand
years happiness or misery but ane eternity of happiness or misery in the
greatest measure and highest degree that can be imagined; and should such a
bussinesse be delayed and putt off? And this is even it in the Text by which
dieing in the Lord is so much commended.

Now before I close this Sermon let me speak a word to what it is to die in the
Lord, which is holden forth as the great and necessary qualification of them
that die with well grounded confidence and warantablie expect happiness; and
there are three Scripture-phrases that conduce very much to the opening up of
it. 1. It implies a being in Christ as that word is, 2 Cor. 5: 17. If any man
be in Christ be is a new creature, this holds out union with him by faith, when
Christ opens his arms and takes the soul in to himself which flies to him
closes with, and cleaves to him like a graft that is imped in the stock, or
like the manslayer sheltred in the city of refuge; this is the first step and
ground of happiness and it has with it a new nature and a new life. The 2
phrase is Gal. 2: 21. I live yet not I but Christ lives in me, and the life
that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the sone of God, and this
is a step further, when a man by faith is fled to Christ and improves and makes
use of his title to him and interest in him for performing the acts of life;
this living in Christ or by the faith of Christ expresses and holds forth a
new nature and life in the acts of life in bringing forth the fruits of the
Spirit, and makes the person indeed a Christian man or man-christian, doing
not only the duties of religion, but all his moral, civil, and natural
actions to Christ living thus Christian like, as spiritual and from the
Spirit, as the word is, 2 Cor. 5: 5. Living not to ourselves but to him etc. 3.
There is a dieing in the Lord here in the Text which follows upon the former;
living in him is the way to happiness and dieing in him is the very door
through which he enters into the possession of happiness; now this dieing in
the Lord presupposes the former and has somewhat more in it, to wit, as ane
acting of faith for living in him, so ane acting of faith for dieing in him; it
takes in; 1. a flieing to Christ a fresh and of new for refuge, as it is
Philip. 3. verse. 9. A seeking to be found in him, leaping as it were out of
ourselves and betakeing ourselves to him as our ship to sail in through death to
life, renunceing our own righteousness of new and closeing with his, yea and
renunceing the very acts of our faith as they are acts. 2, It takes in a
giving of credit to Christ for bearing us through death, acquiesceing in, and
resting on him on that ground, sticking closse by our gripes of him, being well
content and satisfied to adventure to go through death in his hand, and having
gotten a word from Christ resolvedly to keep the grippe of it, and with old
Simeon to say now lets thou thy servant depart in peace; Lord I am content to
take shipping, as it were, in Christ and in that bottom to sail throw the
gulf of death when thou will. 3. It takes in a humble quieting and
satisfieing of ourselves on this ground, not only delyting ourselves in him as
alsufficient, but comforting ourselves in our thus resting on him and counting
ourselves happy in it: something of all these last three we will find holden
forth in these called the last words of David his swan-like song when he is
goeing to die, 2 Samuel 23. verse. 5. Although my house be not so with God, yet he
has made with me ane everlasting covenant; here is the first step his
betakeing of himself and flieing for his life to the grace of God in Christ
holden out in the covenant. 2. He goes forward and concredits himself to and
contents himself in this covenant calling it a well ordered and sure covenant,
able and sufficient to do his turn, O! its a tight veshell that cannot have a
leck, as if he had said, I may sail through death in it safely and not fear. 3.
There is his delyting and satisf^eing himself in it, his acquiesceing in it,
this is all my salvation and all my desire its all my heart can wish, its
mensura voti, the very outmost measure of my wishes, I need no more and I
desy^e no more. Now when we speak of dieing in the Lord we would have you to
take all these three steps together. 1. Study to be in him, there is no
possible dieing in him without being in him, any that would be happy by dieing
in him would by all means accept of the offer of the Gospel, flee to Christ
for refuge and close with him by faith, and endeavor to putt that out of
question that ye are in him; O! Make it sure that thou have given him a soul to
save, and acquiesce in him as thy savior. 2. Live by faith in him, there is
none that can expect to die in Christ that never seriously sought to live in
him, make it manifest that ye live in him by having another sort of life then
brutish men still in their natural state have; God may call a thief on the
cross and make him die in Christ that hes not lived in him, but none of you
can comfortablie expect that he will deall so with you, and where one is so
dealt with, tuentie if not a Hundredth, even very many die without it: and let
me say it if ever at any time God was strikeing men and women with stupiditie
at death, it is palpable he is strikeing many so in this time; it may be some
of you may know Gods strikeing some with stupiditie that made a mock of the
serious exercise of Godliness in their life time; therefore I say again make
your being in christ sure, evidence your being in him by your living in him and
to him. We shall not insist further at this time on this subject, God calls us
all seriously to think on it; sickness, smiteing with Judgments and death have
not readily been more frequent, and if ever there was a time when folk were
called to believe and lay to heart such a doctrine this is the time; it may be
there are some here who ere a few days go by may experience the truth of it,
and who knows who these some shall be? As ye exspect happiness learn to die,
and as to die in Christ so to live in him; and as the Lord bidds John write
these words, so we bid you read them and think often on them, blessed are the
dead, that die in the Lord, from henceforth says the Spirit, that they may
rest from their labors and their works do follow them.

SERMON II.
Revel. 14: 13. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord etc.
THere is one thing common to all men and that is a natural inclination to,
and ane appetite and desire after happiness or blessedness, but there are two
things wherein the most part of men do exceidingly err; 1. In seeking
blessedness where it is not to be found and in accounting that to be
blessedness which is not so, but leaves them eternally miserable. 2. That
when some glances of happiness and wherein it consists are gotten they
grosslie mistake the way to come by it; these words give a notable description
of true blessedness, and a clear direction toward the way how to come at it,
they show plainly where it lies, let the blind and prejudicat world esteem of
it as they will, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, that is only true
blessedness which the dead in the Lord enjoy, and that's the only way to true
blessedness, to be in Christ and to live and die in him.

This is a most concerning subject and singularly suitable to our times; it
being probably with respect to these times that the words are spoken, we shall
therefore proceed to add a little to what we said the last day.

The doctrine which we shall now propose and prosecute lies plainly and
obviously in the very words of the text, they are blessed and happy, yea they
are only blessed and happy that are dead in the Lord Christ or shall die in
him; a voice from heaven asserts it to John, and the Spirit adds a confirmation
of it, yea says the Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of
truth; we shall ere we proceed further in a word or two cleir these things in
the doctrine which are also in the words. 1. What this blessedness is? It is
spoken of here as that which is singularly so, its the only happy condition
that can be truly thought of in all the world, its even to be fully and
compleitly blessed. 2. What is the necessary qualification of these persons who
are pronunced to be blessed? Its not these that die, but these that die in the
Lord that are thus blessed; and for cleiring of this beside what we said the
last day we shall now add, that there are two sorts of dieing spoken of in
Scripture. 1. There is a dieing in sin, if ye believe not in me, ye shall die
in your sins, says Christ to the Jews John 8. verse. 24. and this implies
two things. 1. Ye shall die under the guilt of your sins, and under the curse
and wrath of God which ye deserve, before death, at death, and after death. 2.
Ye shall die in a sinful estate in opposition to repentance for sin, ye shall
slip away and be removed in that sinful condition, ye shall depart and go off
the world in that sinful state, O sad and sorrowful departure! 2. There is a
dieing in the Lord and this implies two things also just opposite to dieing in
sin. 1. That persons in the sense of their sin have betaken themselves to
Christ and are freed from the guilt of sin by faith in him and are clothed
with his righteousness or with a right and title to it. 2. It implies a
breaking off of the course of sin, and the bringing forth the fruits of a new
nature and life, by a livlie faith in Christ in whom as the true vine they are
as so many branches grafted abiding in him and bringing forth fruit to him that
his father may be glorified and they manifested to be his disciples John 15.
Who as they have union with him by faith, so they have communion with him in
the fruits of sanctification; these and these only are thus blessed, and this
blessedness is restricted unto and intailed upon them only, and peremptorly
denied to all others and they utterly excluded from it.

In prosecuting the doctrine I shall, 1. Cleir the truth of this, that they are
blessed, exceedingly blessed and only blessed who are dead or shall die in the
Lord. 2. I shall offer two or three reasons proveing that this blessedness is
peculiar to them and not to any other. 3. I shall speak a little to the use and
improvement of it.

For cleiring of the first, that they are exceedingly blessed that are dead or
shall die in the Lord, we need to do no more but to describe happiness or
blessedness, and we will find it exactly to agrie in all its propperties and
circumstances to them that are dead or shall die in Christ; O! Sirs look not on
this as a story or some airy notion, but as that which is a great realitie, a
thing which some of our Christian acquaintance dead in the Lord do now enjoy,
and which others ere long shall enjoy, and that which by faith in him ye may
all enjoy if ye prejudge not yourselves of it; there are two things necessary
to, and constitutive of, true blessedness or happiness, 1. Ane absolute
freedom from all evil, from every thing that troubles or may be the cause of
trouble, and from any sinful blameable or unsuteable defect or want, for
happiness cannot consist or stand with any thing of that kind. 2. A
concurrence of all the good things that are necessary to compleit blessedness
or happiness, both which are enjoyed by all these that die in the Lord and by
them only.

For the first part of it they that die in^ he Lord are perfectly freed from
all evil, which holds true whither we look to it more generally or with more
particular respect to the scope; they are freed from all these evils that ane
evil time has with it: to descend into the particular consideration of this
blessedness would not be easy, let us only therefore look on some general
heads to clear it so far forth as concerns the present point. 1. They have
freedom from all sin that is the fountain of all evils; the Spirits of just
men are made perfect, before the throne no flesh or blood as corrupt is
permitted to enter in there, no rebellion in the law of the members against the
law of the mind is there, no remainder of the evil heart of unbeleife in
drawing a back from the living God, nor any wearieing of holy duties but a
delightful serveing of God day and night, that is, without any the least
interruption, for there is not day and night, but constant day in that life,
then O! Then is that petition so often putt up to him in his peoples prayers,
thy will be done as it is in heaven, fulfilled, there is then a most perfect
doing of is will, there his servants serve him, in such Spiritually noble
state as he was never ^erved by them on earth; this light, vain and unstable
heart shall then be established and even fixed as ane immovable pillar in the
temple of God, the loosnesse of a wavering gauding and wandering mind shall then
be (...) and for ever removed, and the thoughts of it so strongly stayed in the
contemplation of that most blessed object that they shall not for so much as
one moment be diverted, there will not then be any the least inclination to,
nor capacity of a diversion* O! What would some give (were it to be bought) for
this part of happiness? even to be fully and finally delivered from a body of
death and from the many si^ull pranks of it, and the dangerous precipices it
drives them upon? 2. They have perfect freedom from all tentations to sin,
there does not in that most clear and serene upper region breath the least air
of tentation, there is no tentation to sin from without as there is no
inclination to sin from within and consequently there is a full freedom from
all fear of hazard and danger o^ sinning, no unclean thing comes within the
gates of the new Jerusalem; sin and death and the devil being cast into the
lake; there is no evil example there, but on the contrary if there were any need
of stirring up, strengthening and encouradging one of another, its there
eminently; there is withal there a holy freedom from the difficulty that is
in watching here, which though it be a requisite useful and necessary duty in
sojourning saints yet it has with it a painfullnesse and fear, from which the
dead in the Lord even triumphing saints are perfectly freed. 3. They are freed
from all challenges for sin, they have there no troublesome nor disquieting
exercise of conscience, the immediate enjoyment of Gods company so quiets and
satisfies them, that nothing can disquiet them; there they are under no
desertion nor fear of desertion, and these are often two sad exercises to the
godly here, the challenges of their conscience for sin, and the weights on
their Spirits because of desertion; there is moreover no lukewarm nor any
lyfelesse Spiritual condition there, but a condition always fresh, livlie and
at the very best, they are continually praising in the sense of the love of
God overflowing them in duty: the dead in the Lord must then certainly be in a
most happy condition when they are freed from all these and from all fear of
them. But 4. they are freed from all the effects of sin, there is no curse, no
wrath, no sickness of body, no anxietie of mind there, no terror nor
apprehension of indignation; no poverty no scarsi^ie nor want to them of any
thing there (how poor soever a life they may have here), but God is all and in
all, he by himself immediately fills the room of all things, and fills up the
vastest capacities of the soul; they are also freed from all the tossings and
troubles that are here in this lower world, there are no confinings nor
fynings, no sequestrations nor forefaultures or hazard of loseing estates, no
quarterings of soldiers to discompose the quiet and tranquillity of families
there, which some would think a piece of happiness to be quyt of; there is no
reproach, no discredit nor disgrace there, but a new name given; there are no
mistakes nor jealousies, no alienations nor animosities, no rents nor
divisions, no unsuteable passiones nor heats there, but a most comely and
compleit union and holy harmony in the praising of God, there is no
darkness of mind there, the understanding being perfectly enlightened, no
disorder in the affections, but a most exact regularity, no preversenesse nor
backwardness in the will, but a most thorrow compliance in all things with the
will of God, all within the man sweetly conspiring in a holy harmony and in a
due subordination to the head; there is no scandal or offense given nor taken
there; there is no sadning reports nor ill news there; nay its impossible there
can be, since God orders all immediately; and they approve all that he does,
they applaud to, and are well satisfied with all; there are no overturnings of
Kingdoms and states, nor confusions or desolations in Churches to mar their
happiness there; but they being fully acquainted with the infinitely wise
proceedings of God, there is nothing that can mar their happiness, suppose
they knew all these overturnings confusions and distractions that make us sad
here below; they cannot be troubled with the want nor with the fear of the want
of any thing, and thus they continue to be for ever and ever; yet this is but a
little piece of their happiness that die in the Lord, how small a portion of it
do we know?

As to the other half of their happiness (and O! That ye knew and believed
what the happiness is which they have that are now before the throne) we said
in general that there is in it a concurrence of all good things necessary for
making of them compleitly happy; and it must have these four things
concurring to this end which are all in their estate who die in the Lord. 1.
Ane enjoying of God the chief good, for no other thing nor person can
communicate true happiness nor make one truly happy. 2ly. Because there
cannot be ane enjoying of him without some suteablenesse to him, therefore a
suteablenesse for the enjoyment of God is required, for we could not, we dought
not fully and immediately enjoy God in the estate wherein we now are. 3ly. It
requires full measures and degrees of enjoying God. 4ly. It requires a
perpetual and eternal enjoying of him, and all their concur, as I said, to
compleit the happiness of them that die in the Lord. 1. They do fully enjoy
God the chief good, look where Abraham is there are they, he is in the
Kingdom of his father, and so are they, and therefore most happy; hence it is
that Christ speaking of blessedness to his disciples he tells them that they
shall sit with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of heaven, Matthew. 8.
verse. 11. they have places among them that stand by, Zech. 3. verse. 7. they see
his face and are therefore happy, blessed are the pure in heart for they shall
see God, Matthew. 5. verse. 8. when we speak of enjoying God, it is far very far
above and beyond what we can express; it must sure be a great happiness and
delight when the object of their delight is no created thing, but the infinite
and alsufficient God, it must be a pure heavenly and excellent delight that
flows from the enjoyment of God with whom is the fountain of life. 2ly. They
are made meet and suitable to enjoy him in a full measure and in a high degrie;
if we would imagine man's understanding to be enlarged to conceive of God, and
the enlargement of it to be very far beyond that which we can now Imagine or
conceive, it shall* be thus dilated and filled; it shall then have a distinct
and fully satisfieing knowledge of the great mystery of the adorable
trinity, as Christ assures his disciples, Ioh. 14. verse. 20. At that day ye
shall know that I am in the father, the affections shall then be made capacious
to receave and shall be filled and satisfied with delight in the enjoyment of
that clearlie and distinctly known object; it satisfies Angels and must
satisfy the Spirits of just men made perfect, it makes them happy to behold
and enjoy him, and the greatest happiness that the Scripture speaks of, is to
be in Christ's company, beholding the glory that he hes gotten from the
father; and if ye could suteablie conceive what condition David, Paul, and some
that have gone a few years or months since into that blessed rest are in, it
would make you long to die in the Lord, and would through grace put you to give
all diligence in time to make that happiness sure. 3ly. As they are made
suitable and meet to enjoy God in a full measure and high degrie, so they shall
enjoy him in a full measure and degrie actually, there is no more desired nor
desyreable, it is full glory and full joy, none can imagine or wish more, it
being a thing to which there can be no accession made according to the
capacity that they are put into; for though there be different degrees of
glory and some conceave and receave more and some less, yet all are filled
even filled with the love and loveing-kyndnesse of God with that fulness of
joys and these pleasures that are at his right hand; and they have all this
not in bare notions but most reallie and in ane incomprehensible way (to us now
at least incomprehensible) communicated to them. 4ly. This enjoying of God is
perpetual and eternal, for ever and ever without interruption or
intermission, its not only a full but ane everlasting joy and glory, sorrow
and sighing shall then for ever flee away, and everlasting joy shall be upon
their heads for evermore, the croune is ane eternal and immarcessible one even
a croune of life that is perpetually floorishing; yet all that we have said
falls hugely short of, and as to our manner of expressing it, unworthie to be
compared with the happiness of them that die in the Lord; if any of them heard
us speak of their condition they would wonder to hear us do it so childishlie,
poorly, meanly and bauchly; O! That we could streatch ourselves to believe that
which we cannot so distinctly conceave of this blessedness.

The next thing I proposed to speak a word or two to, is the reasons why
blessedness is peculiar only to them that die in the Lord and not to any
others; I shall shortly hint at three, the 1. whereof is, because only they
that die in the Lord Christ are made partakers of his satisfactione, and
therefore they and they only are freed from the curse by beleiving in him, John
3: 36. He that beleiveth on him is not condemned but has everlasting life, but
he that beleiveth not is condemned already and the wrath of God abides on
him, John. 3. verse. 18. and 36. They that believe have gotten a discharge of
their debt, the handwriting that was against them is cancelled; but they that
believe not have the bond still standing over their heads, and they for their
debt undischarged shall be hailed before the Judge and cast in prison where
they must lie till they pay the utmost farthing which will never be done.

2. Because they only that are in Christ and die in him are privileged with
the adoption of sons, and consequently they only have right to heaven and
eternal life, to as many as received him he gave power to become the sons of
God, that is, to as many as believed on his name, Joh. 1. 12. And if sons
then heirs and joint heirs with Christ, Romans 8: 17. If we be not sons then
are we not heirs.

3. Because only they that live and die in Christ are new creatures, if any man
be in Christ he is a new creature, 2 Cor 5. verse. 17. And in Christ Jesus
nothing availls but a new creature, Gal. 6: 15. Except a man be borne again he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven, John 3. verse. 3. And there being none
borne again but they that are in Christ, and our regeneration and faith in
Christ goeing inseperablie together, none can be happy but these that live and
die in him.

We come now in the 3d place according to the method proposed to speak to the
uses of this doctrine, which must needs have many uses being such a high point
as holds forth the right way and the only way to true blessedness.

The first use then is to put us all to be more seriously exercised how to die
well, and that is to die in the Lord; seeing happiness and such a happiness
depends on it, and only on it, then sure folks should be exceedingly concerned
to walk by this middle, of dieing in him as they would meet with happiness at
the end. There are many things that press this; as 1. if peace and
tranquillity of mind and conscience be of concernment, then this is of
concernment, for how can they possibly have peace that know not whither they
shall go to heaven or hell? 2. If comfort in any thing or all things be of
concernment, then this is of concernment, for how can men's sleep, meat, drink,
apparel, or any thing they enjoy be comfortable to them if they know not that
they are in him and shall die in him? This one word may mar all their mirth
and happiness, that they that are not in him shall die miserably and so love
all other comforts. 3. If it be of concernment to have boldness and confidence
to god-wards at death, this is of concernment; for if death sadly surprise men
how can they have peace, confidence or boldness since they are not in him? All
the world cannot buy nor purchasse a quiet and good conscience to them. 4. If
we think heaven or happiness to be of concernment, then this is no doubt of
concernment, for heaven and happiness are knitt to dieing in him; and therefore
let me in the name of the Lord lay it upon you, by all suitable means to
endeavor to bear it upon your very hearts to have your peace with God made in
time, that die when ye will, it may be made sure that it shall be in him; think
ye that to be eternally in ^e^ven or in hell is of little concernment? Its your
way of dieing that makes the difference, as the tree falls so it will ly; there
will be no revocking of that sentence nor any change of your state after death;
and knows any of you when it will come? Are any sure to get time or grace
then to make peace with God when seiknesse and death comes? Are there not many
stricken wish hardness, sensless^esse and conscience benuming stupiditie at
their death? Remember therefore that death is coming and study to have this
much in your eye.

To prosecute this use a little and to reprove the great stupiditie that the
most part live in as i^ they cared not how they die, (for how live many
grosslie profane and Atheistical men, as i^ they were to die like beasts? And
now many presumptuous hypocrites are there, that think it a veri^ easy matter
to die, yea that it is nothing; and how many are there who have frequent fears
and convictions especially at death, who yet never come this length to make it
sure on good grounds that their sins are laid on Christ, and to make it their
great bussinesse to have their corruption mortified by his grace that they may
die in him? And how many are there that have some good in them w^o are very
lasie and careless and who in a manner let death come as it will?) We shall
seeing it is of such mighty concernment) press it on you by a familiar laying
before you some things that are very ordinary to men and women at death* we
look a^ace upon death (...) off, but we should bring it neir to us and have it
always before us, the neglect whereof makes folk very ordinarily to die as
they live, and that's not well nor in the Lord: there are four cases or
conditions that we most ordinarlie meet with in the plurality of them that
die. 1 We find some senseless and stupid without any fear of God or regaird to
their souls, they lived a stupid life without all fear and aw of the majesty
of God, and they die so, thus Churlish Nabal died as he lived most stupidly and
senselessly; it might possibly be edifieing though very sad to speak of the
lamentable condition of some graceless persons that die among us; therefore
putt away senselessnesse and stupiditie now alonge your life, as ye would not
die senseless and stupid. A 2d sort of persons we meet with who have been
p^esumeing all their days, and will needs pertinaciously disput it out at
their death that all shall be well with them; and though it may be palpablie
discerned that they are without all due sense of sin and utterly void of grace,
yet they will confidently aver that they be e^ved all their days, and will
not quyt their deluding hopes that all shall be well with them now at death; O!
Sirs think ye that to be a good condition, to die without sense of sin, and
with wersh, teastlesse, lifelesse and groundless apprehensions of mercy;
dread therefore and deprecat presumption; O! But its hard to get some of you
convinced of it, and yet it is a special thing that keeps you from coming in
good earnest to Christ. A 3d sort are these that die with some little
challenges, and at the best with much doubting, and many fears who have had
their own convictions fears and doubtings in their life, and yet never labored
in Gods way, to be through in the matter of their interest in, and peace with
God; they are affrayed to die, and yet die they must, the faith they had
mi^gives them, and the strong apprehensions they have of wrath quite overturnes
their confidence and hope, the just recompense of living in a doubtful and
doubting condition without serious seeking after thorrow clearness; I grant
this condition is somewhat better then any of the former two, and yet ane evil
and dangerous condition to die in; words sp^ken to them do neither satisfy
nor setle them, for either they have little Judgment or tentations are strong
and vigorous, or bodily infirmity is growing fast on them. There is a 4th sort
of selfe-righteous persons, that please themselves with a hope of heaven,
because they have been good neighbors, and lived harmlesslie, they were not
grossly profane, they were not drunkards, swe^rers, sabbath breakers nor
extortioners etc. But civil and honest, faithful and just in their deallings
and their callings, they had prayer in their families and in secreet, they
waited on ordinances etc. And at death they confirm themselves from these
grounds that all shall be well; we condemn not duties, God forbid, but its a
sad and hazardous case when they are mainly laid weight on and stuck to at
death; such selfe-justifiers are brought in by the Lord Luke 13. saying Lord we
have eaten and drunken in thy presence etc whom yet he boasts away from him;
see how the proud and selfe-justifieing Pharasie on such grounds as these is
sent away unjustified Luke 18. folks habituating themselves to these grounds
of confidence in their lifetime makes them stick stiffly to them at their
death, and keeps them from seeing the absolute necessity of Christ's imputed
righteousness, and from fleeing to it for their justification.

The 2d Use is of exhortation to stir up yourselves from these considerations
to think on death more seriously, and how ye may die in the Lord; and to this
end we shall propose three questions that ye would lay your account to be putt
to answer at death.

1. Think how ye will answer the challenges that death will readily bring
alonge with it and urge you for a satisfieing answer unto, where there has
been a negligent life there will be many challenges, yea where there has been
a diligent life there will not be challenges wanting, ye would see how to
prevent or answer these; I shall instance only in fyve of them. 1. When this
comes, thou have stiffled many good purposes and resolutions, or suspended the
conscientious execution and practice of them, thou have delayed and putt off
from day to day the making of thy peace with God, how will thou answer that?
When conscience begins to reflect and look back and to ask how is all? Is the
house out of order through thy negligence? Tell me man what is the reason thou
made not thy peace with God sure before this time? Did thou shuffle by such
and such a duty when thou wast called to it and when it was pressed on thee?
Why did thou forbear to mortify such and such a lust? Consider, O ^ Consider
how ye will answer such a challenge when ye will not dar to adventure on death*
and yet will not be able to put it off, O secure Atheists and contemners of
Godliness consider in time what ye will say to this. 2. Another challenge will
be this, the conscience will say thou have been bussied in following after some
vain Just, bussie about the bigging of a house, about the gathering of some
gear or riches, about making conqueist of such a piece of land etc. Now what
will all these advantage thee? And what profit have thou of all these things
whereof thou art now ashamed? Why did thou set thine eyes on, why bestowed
thou so much labor and spent so much time and pains on that which cannot
satisfy, on that which is not? What good will they then do to thee? It shall
be said to thee, fool this night thy soul shall be taken from thee and then
whose shall these things be; what advantage is there or can there possibly be
in gaining the wholl world if thou lose thy own soul? And O! What grounds of
such challenges are there in this generation? A thing which when death comes
will stick to and gnaw in the consciences of many of you that hear me this day,
even that you have been cumbred and careful about many things while in the
mean time the one thing necessary has been postponed and quite neglected. A 3d
challenge, the ground whereof is alace very common, will be, careless
sloathfull and idle triffling away and mispending of precious time, and
neglecting the great work of salvation, easy letting pass without improvement
opportunities of getting good and doing good, when ye shall look back and ask
yourselves what have we been doing in this our day? And the conscience will
answer and say, ye were vainlie discoursing or tippling or vaiging and wandering
thorrow the feilds bussied in doing nothing or worse then nothing, then ye
will cry but in vain, O! To have some of these precious opportunities back
again, that we thought little of when we had them; we have past 30. or 40.
years time in the world, and yet are no surer of our salvation now then when we
came into it, but we have much more sin and guilt then we had; Ah! Will some
say we have lived 50. or 60. years and yet none of all that time has been well
spent. A 4th challenge will be, folks formalitie and hypocrisy in the worship
of God, that they came to the Church to hear, but sleeped or wandered and were
nothing careful to profit, that they satt down and prayed, but were not in
earnest in it, never sought after the Spirit of grace and of supplications, it
may be they prayed in their families, and in secreet, but when the conscience
looks back and sees that all has been but formal and hypocritical work,
that they knew not what communion with God was, they knew not neither cared to
know whither their persons were accepted and their prayers heard, they studied
not experimentally to be acquainted with the life and power of godliness, O!
How sad will this be? And how will it all be got answered? A 5th challenge
will be abuseing of many means of grace, of many mercies and favors, such as
Sabbaths, Sermons, Conferences etc. that ye lived not under heathnish or
Antichristian darkness, but where the pure light of the Gospel shined
clearly, that ye might have known the right way and would not, that ye might
have made use of such ane Instrument, of such a Sermon, of such fellowship, of
such a book etc. And it would have been better with you, but ye did not, ye
would not; the conscience will say, here ye were negligent, there ye dallied,
here ye wearied, and there ye satt up and gave over, and what can ye now answer
for all? There are many in Glasgow and else where, that will meet with this
challenge if not with Gods Judgment for the sins whereon it is founded; as ye
would die in the Lord, for Christ's sake, study to prevent such challenges, and
to get them scored out by timeous turning to God in Christ and seriousness in
the way of faith and holiness; for assuredly death will bring alonge with it
many more and many other challenges then most have now while they live and are
in health, they will prick and byt in ane other manner then quickly transient
lighter touches of convictions do now.

The 2d Question we would propose is, how will ye answer some peculiar
tentations that death uses to bring alonge with it; for tentations are then
more sly and subtle as challenges are more loud and peirceing, and the devil
is then more then ordinarily bussie, and if tentations be then yielded to, he
has almost win the cause; O! Consider how ye will answer these tentations; I
shall only instance these fyve tentations that use to assault and set upon
folk at death; the 1. is a tentation to fretting against Gods dispensation in
removeing and calling away a person at such a time and under such
circumstances, which fretting flows from a unwillingnesse to die; O! As
enimitie will be ready to burst out in being angry at Gods chopping by death
at the man in the midst of such a design and project or before he got such a
bargane ended, such a purchasse made, or such a child provided for etc. And if
the devil prevail by this tentation to fretting and repining at divine
disposal, it will mar the fruit of any thing that might be then expected, and
will further estrange you from God that ye cannot come neir him, and yet O! How
ryfe is such a tentation? Study to walk therefore in a sweet plyablenesse and
readiness to die, for if ye go on following one design after another, and
one wordlie bussinesse after another without this study, ye will be taken
unawarse suddenly surprised in the midst of them as many are, and be in eminent
hazard of being prevailled over by this tentation to fretting and grudging at
deaths arreasting though by the great and righteous Judge his order. A 2d
tentation is to Atheism, for as folk have lived in Atheism, so the devil
assaults them by tentations to Atheism at their death, to make them despise
death and desperately to harden themselves against it, and with a profaine and
damnable sort of delicacy Agag like to throw themselves into the pit; hence
many desperate souls who as they tushed alonge their life at the thoughts of
death, so when death comes they trouble not themselves with it, but shake off
all fear and study a sort of godless gallantrie of Spirit, and seeing they
must die they will die, and will not so much as seem to regaird it; but will ye
that way outface the wrath of God and dar to laugh in taking the cup of his
indignation in your hands? It is true, I grant it is a piece of Gods dreadful
justice that these who have not stood in aw of him in their life, should die
Judicially hardened, but such will meet with a most fearful wakening after it.
A 3d tentation is to presumption and hypocrisy, which prevaills especially
with civil and formal professors, that dought never abyd to be evened to
hell, nor could ever endure to be called natural folk; as such did presume
and were hypocritical in their life, so the same tentation sticks to them and
prevaills over them at death; and they will it may be, speak something of the
consolations of God with their mouths when they have no feilling of them in
their hearts, and of faith in Christ when yet they never knew the real
exercise of it, and will need like the foolish virgins go forth with the wise
to meet the bridgroome keeping their lamps till their very death; that same
principle of Hypocrisy that made them dissemble in their life will make them
speak many good words for a name at their death; therefore bewar of it, hunt
not after a name of religion, and affect not to be accounted and to be called
somebody, but seek to be sincere, to be reallie that which ye seem to be, and
when ever a challenge comes for this, rather entertain it and make some good
use of it then shake it off, for though ye could pass away undiscovered by
man, God will find you out and discover you; and often not a few of such
persons make such discovery of themselves, that a discerning eye will see them
in their own colors; always I say take notice of it as a mighty tentation,
when folk take more pains to faird and paint their condition over with fair
words and shows, then to be real before God, and be upon your guard against
it. A 4th tentation is to conceit of selfe-righteousnesse, and which even some
holy men at their death have been more troubled with then any other tentation,
and it prevaills much with formal professors (such as the Pharasies were) who
as they lived in conceit of it, so readily it cleaves to them at death, such
will be ready to say, I thank God I kept the Church, I was never heard with
my neighbors, I dealt truly and Justly with all men, it was Gods goodness to
me, I was aye on the right side, I read, prayed, kept the Sabbath etc. These
are good in themselves I grant, but not to be laid weight upon and lippened to
neither in life nor at death as the main fundation of salvation and
consolation, therefore guaird against it as a tentation when ever Satan comes
to speak a good word to you in order to merit or deserving. The 5th and last is
a tentation to doubting yea to desperation, which is not so frequent I grant,
yet it prevaills with some who have lived it may be very secure in their life,
and when death comes the devil says, ye have never sought God in earnest all
your days, and now time is gone the door is shutt ^e will not hear you, this
may through grace be answered and it would not be strengthened by refuseing the
offer of Gods grace even then, especially if God call thick, to say so, and
some of the senses it may be begin to fail and to be taken away.

The 3d and last Question is to inquire at you what think ye will be your
thoughts at death? And I shall draw forth this also into four or fyve; 1. What
will ye then think of the world, of all its pleasures, gains and honors? In
health and prosperity men have big and high thoughts of this and that vanity,
project and design* but what will ye think of all outward prosperity, and of
barnes full of corn, of cellars full of wine, and of houses full of wealth and
ric^es, of high places, honors, credit and repute in the world when death
comes to summond you to leave them all? The mind will not feed upon them then,
the glory and splendour of them will then grow dim and dark, they will then
lose their blossom and flowr, the teast and sweet relish of them will then
quite evanish; has not the experience of many men who did sweem in pleasures
and abound in wealth and honor, verified the truth of this? Have they not
found all then to be but vanity and vexation of Spirit, and have they not some
times proclaimed them to be so? Yea even it may be before death when under some
great pain or sickness or some quick and sharp challenge of conscience; all
the man's riches, pleasures, and honors could not then ease his mind. 2. What
will be your thoughts of the cheiffest grounds ye have to build your peace on
now? Ye can presume now and have no doubt of your Salvation, but at death your
grounds will be narrowly sifted, and in sted of a solid assurance, ye will
scarce get a harleing thought of it, to say so, in sted of faith ye will
readily have doubting, and for hope ye will have fear; how many at death have
been made to think and even to say, they have been but beguileing themselves?
and will not many of you, if God prevent not, think and say so? when ye begin
to look on eternity and Gods Justice, and to find that many things ye have
leaned unto, will not then abyd the trial nor be able to bear the weight of
your souls salvation, nor to answer the challenges which they answered, as it
might be, in health; Hence is it that many at death will cry for a Minister and
for Prayer, that cared little for their Company and for that duty alonge
their life, and when the Minister is come they will then tell him they can do
nothing, and indeid they can do nothing till grace friely give both to will
and to do, but this bids you bewar of putting off till death. 3. When ye draw
neir your latter end, and death comes to sit down on your eye lids, when the
eyes and ears begin to fail and eternity stares you in the face (for I suppose
the persons to have still the exercise of their Judgment) what will be your
thoughts then? may we not Imagine the thoughts of many will be like these of
the poor Heathen Emperor Hadrian, who bespoke his dislodging soul thus, O poor
soul whither art thou goeing? And think with yourselves what ye would give for
a Sabbath then, for one Sermon then, and when relations and neighbors will be
weeping about you and ye groaning under a burden of sin and fear of wrath, and
also of pain and sickness, and feign would ye stay but ye may not, the soul
must go and not one hours delay will be granted, what think ye would ye give
then, and at that hour to be suffered to come back again, and stay a while
here? and yet that hour is not far off from many of you, from some not a year,
from othersome it may be not a Month yea possibly not a week. 4. What think
ye will be the condition of the soul when it goes out and dislodgeth from the
body, and when the sentence shall be passed, and when Legions of Devils shall
harle and drag the soul away to hell the place of Torment that was thinking to
go to heaven; what think ye will be the thoughts of such a soul that in the
persons lifetime would have disdained and stormed to hear a Minister or any
other eiven it to hell, when it shall be thus unexpectedly seized on and
hurried thither? Do ye think Sirs that there are no souls in hell, or that few
or none at all are in hazard of being there eternally? If ye will deny neither
but grant both, do not then think ye, all they infinitely wrong themselves who
securely drive over their time and think not seriously on their dieing in the
Lord? which is the scope of all: This Doctrine lays before you Life and Death,
Heaven and Hell, if ye live and die in Christ, ye shall get life and be
eternally blessed, but if ye live and die in your sins in sted of life ye
shall without all doubt meet with death, and such a death as ye heard of in the
Lecture, a death that has the Wine of the Wrath of God without mixture in the
Cup of his Indignation, and torment even eternal Torment without any the least
intermission or mitigation, whereby ye will be made everlastingly most
miserable. Lastly, is it not think ye of your unspeakablie great concernment
to think seriously on your living and dieing in the Lord before death come? Let
me but put this one question to you; what will be the thoughts of many in Hell,
who have gotten fair warning of this ere it come? many of you if grace prevent
not will then remember better on this preaching then you will do a day or two
hence, ye may reject and beat back a word now, but ye will not get it beat
back then, but it will take hold of you, it will gall and torment you, the
Prophets do not live for ever, says the Prophet Zachary Chap. 1. but the
Word of the Lord will live for ever, it will take hold of them that despised
it, it will take them by the throat, as it were, and make them gasp eternally;
The Lord graciously knock hard at your hearts by this so concerning a truth,
that it may have access to you, and keep you from slighting of it; Blessed are
the dead which die in the Lord, they rest from their labors and their works
do follow them.

SERMON III.
Revel. 14: 13. Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, etc.
THere are some things of such concernment to us that if we go suteablie,
seriously and singly about them, we can be hardly too much in them, and
therefore these four things that are called man's last things, Death, Judgment,
Heaven and Hell, have been so frequently recommended to Christians as the most
constant subjects of their Meditation; and among them all, death ought to have
the first place in order at least, it being the door whereby we enter into
Judgment, and as men die so they shall rise and may expect a final decision and
sentence from the Judge about their eternal state, and the Spirits casting in
this to divert John and the Reader a little from following the series of the
History, does put a commendation on it, and says that it is no digression,
for his People to bestow some serious thoughts on it.

The last thing we spoke to was a Doctrine from the words as they lie, that
they and they only are blessed who die in the Lord; now ere we further prosecut
the main uses of the Doctrine we shall speak a word to that which is manifestly
employed here, and it is this, that as they are blessed who die in the Lord, so
they are exceedingly miserable that die out of him in their sins; for the
affirming of the one implies and supposes the other; and it might follow on the
former Doctrine as ane use, however its cleirly in the words and commends
dieing in Christ to you all, and serves to stir you up to be serious to make
that sure, and therefore we exhort, beseech, and obtest you to count it of
concernment even of the greatest concernment unto you, it is to you Men and
Women that we speak and not to walls, to timber and stones, sleep not neither
let your minds vaig and wander, for we are speaking the words of truth, that
many of you may be made to find the truth of too late.

In prosecuting this Doctrine, we shall speak a little to the cleiring of both
the branches of it, and then come to the use. The first branch is, that there
are many that die not in Christ, this is cleirly employed in the words; Its
looked on as a rare thing in the spreading of the Gospel after the reign of
Antichrist to find People dieing in the Lord, he is a rare so a happy man that
dies in him. The second branch of it is, that be who they will that die not in
him but die out of him in their sins, they die exceeding miserably; we shall
confirm the first, and then speak a little to the explication of the second.

For the first, that there are many that die not in Christ, it appears from
Matthew. 7. verse. 22. and from Luke 13. verse, 24. These three will confirm it
abundantly; 1. the plain words of Scripture where Christ speaks of Heaven
as having, for coming to it, a narrow way and a strait gate so that few enter
in thereat, and of Hell and Destruction as having a wide gate and a broad way
into which many enter, and when he speaks of the day of Judgment, he says,
many shall come to him in that day and say, Lord, Lord, open to us, to whom he
will say depart from me I never knew you, and he will set the goats on his
left hand and send them thence into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and
his Angels; these Scriptures speak not only of such as are without the Church,
but also if not mainly of many visible Professors, yea even of such as
preached in his name, and yet say of them that they die not in Christ. 2. If ye
will look to the ordinary connection that is betwixt men's living and dieing, ye
will find that the way of the most part of men declares plainly that they die
not in the Lord; for as we show, men's being and living in Christ must preceid
their dieing in him, before they can die in him they must needs be in him; we
do not say that all must be and live so many years in him before they can die
in him, but that they must be sometime in him before they can die in him, and
that they must live and put forth some acts and breathings of a spiritual life,
of the life of Faith in him, if it were but a few words to Gods glory and for
others edification, or a few sighs, groans, and looks to him; as we may see in
the theife on the Cross though his time was very short; And if this being and
living in Christ must preceid dieing in him, if ye compare it with the most
part of your lives, Ah! how sad a prognostic gives it, of what is like to be
your way of dieing? How many are there of you that live still in black nature
and were never borne again? If I could class the lives of the most part I
would essay it. 1. How many are living like Atheists not calling upon God at
all, casting off fear and restraining Prayer before him? And as these live so
they die for the most part either securely or desperately. 2. How many live in
formalitie and never knew what it was to mortify the Flesh, or sincerely to
aim at the power of godliness, and yet says the Holy Ghost Romans 8: 13. If
ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit mortify the
deads of the body ye shall live; if grace be not in the heart and Kyth not at
all in the conversation, ye cannot warrantablie expect to die in Christ; except
a man be borne again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, this is a
large and great class and takes in all that live and die as they were borne,
and seek not after another life then that which they brought with them into the
World. 3. How many are there that have some outward fairding and paint and yet
have no realitie of Religion within? Whereby they mock God and dissemble with
Men: It is to such that Christ speaks John 8. 21. and tells them that they
shall die in their sins, and against this sort of men he denounces many
woes. 4. Are there not many that live without Faith in Christ? Without which
they cannot possibly please God neither living nor dieing, and shall be damned
if they continue so, for says the Lord John 3. v. 18. he that beleives not is
condemned already: Now when all these Classes are laid aside, there will be
but few behind; all which proves abundantly the truth of the thing, and that
there is but too good ground to think that there are many, very many who die
not in Christ. A third ground of confirmation of this sad truth may be drawn
from the ordinary way that the most part die in, and pass out of time into
eternity; O! how many die securely, stupidly and (as we said before)
senselesly, and are no more affected with the thoughts of the immortality of
their souls then if they had none at all? How many die presumptously confident?
how many found their faith of dieing well on wrong grounds? how many die
doubtinglie not knowing what shall become of them? And how many die desperately?
So that (alace) there are but few among us that close their eyes like dieing
Persons in Christ; and though we will not be peremptour in passing Judgment
upon, or in censureing of particular persons as to their final state, yet all
this shows that it is no very common nor ordinary thing to die in the Lord.

As for the second branch of the Doctrine, to wit, that these who die out of
Christ in their sins, die in exceeding great misery, It is also very clear,
for as the happiness of them that die in Christ is unexpressiblie great, so
the misery and unhappiness of them that die not in him is also inexpressible,
for they are excluded and shut out from God and from all good, and have his
wrath, his furious indignation, and his most sever Justice persueing them for
ever and ever; we shall only consider it briefly in these two generals; 1.
They are put out and secluded from the greatest happiness that can be
Imagined, and that in all the degrees of it. 2. They are concluded and put
under the greatest misery that can be conceaved, and that in all the degrees
of it. 1. I say they are shutt out from the greatest happiness, and that is,
from the fellowship of God who is the chief good, from converseing with the
Lamb, glorious Angels and Saints, they shall not have one Saint in all their
Company, there is not nor shall be the least evidence of the love of God among
all the thousands in Hell, not one drop of cold water to cool the tongue of
any of them who are tormented in these fiames, they have Judgment without the
least mixture of mercy, Iam. 1. 13. and that for ever without intermission;
they shall never have the least glimmering of light nor the least slaiking or
mitigation of their pain, they shall have no rest night nor day; and which
aggreageth all even to the very hight and extremity, they have no outgate nor
hope of it, but lie in utter desperatione under that felt eternal torment; it
would be some lightening to the damned in Hell if their torment were to continue
but for some thousands of years, yea or but for some millions of thousands of
years, as poor Spira said, that it would have been a comfort to him if Hell had
been but for twenty thousand years; but it is for ever. And 2. If we look to
the other part of it, they are in this hopeless condition under the greatest
misery drinking for ever of the Wine of the wrath of God without mixture in
the cup of his indignation, which shall be both their meat and their drink; and
their company shall be the Devil and his Angels; O! that we were serious in
speaking and hearing and thinking of these things; the Ods and Difference is
both great and strange, in stead of shareing in the Glory of God, of Christ,
and of his Angels, to be shareing of the Torment of the Devil and his Angels;
If it be a very evil, nay the very worst condition, for a Person to have
enimitie at God in the hight, and to have God ane everlastingly irreconciliable
enemy furiously persueing his quarrel, though without all passion in him, yet
with wonderful horror in the person that is thus plagued, It cannot sure be
told to the full, how inconceavably evil and miserable their condition is that
die out of Christ, nor what the hazard is that many of you are in, in reference
to it.

The first use of this is, for exhorting you not to think it of light or little
concernment how ye die, nor a thing unworthie of your most serious and
painful endeavors to be made sure on good grounds that ye shall die in him;
if it be of great concernment to get heaven and to escape hell, to be (...)
Gods company and not in the devils for ever, to have love and not hatred to
God for ever, and to have Gods love to you and not his hatred for ever (for
death casts the balance); set, O! Set yourselves seriously to obtain the
one and eshew the other; and there is no way to win at it but by being, living,
and dieing in Christ.

A 2d use, serves wonderfully to check and reprove the senseless secure
multitude that have the common profession of the faith of these things, and yet
are utterly careless to have this most concerning question clearly,
distinctly, convincingly, and satisfieingly answered, whither they shall die in
the Lord? Certainly there are many of you when your souls shall dislodge that
will find yourselves exceedingly mistaken in this matter; O! If we could pity
and lament over the lamentable condition of many of you who are so senseless,
stupid, and unconcerned, that what ever is spoken of the life to come and of
the necessity of making your peace with God through Jesus Christ, it is as if
it were spoken to so many stocks or stones as to any suitable effect it has
upon you, for who of many of you quit their prophannesse, formalitie,
hypocrisy, and security? Who through grace mends any thing faulty and amiss?
Or setts more timeously and seriously about the learning of this great lesson
of dieing in the Lord? The supine, lasie, and gross neglect of all which, bids
you look for and lay your account to meet with the deeper, sorer, and sader
challenges at your death and appearance before Gods terrible tribunal.

But it may be asked here, what is the reason that so many die out of Christ?
How can this be, seeing they have no happiness, but so much and so great
misery by it? How comes it to pass that so many take the one way of living
and dieing out of him, and so few choice the other way of living to him and of
dieing in him? To insist long and at large in answering of this question would
lead us to give reasons why men shun and decline the study of holiness and
will be profane, why they despise the Gospel and embrace the world and their
lusts; but to leave such generals we shall speak a word or two more
particularly and clossly to this, why it is that so few die in the Lord? And
the 1 Reason is this, because the faith of these general truths that there is
a heaven and a hell, a life eternal and a Judgment to come, is scarcely
received by the multitude of the hearers of the Gospel, yea the very faith of
their own dieing in particular (though they know they will die and though
experience may teach them the same daily) sincks not into their hearts; who
are they that believe practically and with particular application that they
will die and come to Judgment, and that they shall be put into ane eternally
unchangeable condition after death? And if this be not indeed believed then to
allude to the Apostles words 1 Cor. 15. our preaching is in vain and your
faith is but vain; that these things are not reallie believed we hinted before
when we began to speak on their words, and the practice of most undenyablie
proves it; for though all in word profess they believe that they will die, yet
who are they that on the matter mind not to outlive this day, and the next day,
and the day following and so on? So that in effect it turns to this, they
would live eternally here; and this is a root-evil or ane evil root that
destroys many souls; most people are like to these spoken of in the days of
Noah, Math. 24. eating and drinking, marying and giving in marriage, suffering
one day to come and another to go till death come and surprise them er they be
awar, and then are they confounded and put through other, to say so, with the
very first thoughts and appearances of it: if men were seriously thinking on
death and Judgment and a particular reckoning with God and were reallie
beleiving these things, is it possible they would thus delyt themselves in
their sinful lusts and pleasures and have their affections so glued to a
present world? No certainly, the thoughts of death and Judgment would putt gall
and wormwood in these things and imbitter them. A 2d reason may be drawn from
peoples gross mistakes about the right way of dieing, they take dieing in the
Lord to be quite another thing then indeed it is, for even as folk mistake all
other duties, so they mistake this, they take that for repentance, for faith,
and for holiness, which is not repentance, nor faith, nor holiness indeed; so
they take that to be dieing in the Lord which is not dieing in him: and here we
shall touch on two or three things which we conceave many take for dieing in
the Lord wherein yet they are exceedingly mistaken. 1. They think if they can
die without any public scandal or known sin* or without challenges, and if
they can get their presumptuous conceit and good opinion of themselves keept
up to their grave (as if it were eneugh to say Lord Lord open to us) and if
they can go away calmly and quietly like these spoken of, Psalm. 73. verse. 4.
Who have no bands in their death; that then they are well eneugh and die well,
but this is a great mistake. 2. They trow they die well if they die with a sort
of hope that it shall be well with them, and for this they will toughly debeat,
and when Christ comes and tells them they are beguiled they will hardly trow
him, but rather as it were allege that he is mistaken and they are not the
men, what? Have we not eaten and drunken in thy presence, have we not heard
thee preach in our streets, have we not been at many preachings and communions?
We have always had a good hope toward God and why should we now fear death?
O! The strong presumption that some die with? And this is another great
mistake. 3. Some think if they can die after some prayers and convictions and
that which they think to be repentance, all will be well, these things indeed
if they were real, were good; but how many play the hypocritegregiously in them?
There are not a few that fancy they have the grace of repentance because they
have some sadness for sin, or some little anxietie or a few challenges, who yet
never took seriously with the corruption of their nature, and the quarrel
that God has with them on that account, Nor ever fled to Christ for refuge,
but go away in their fit of carnal sorrow, and this is another great mistake.
4. Some lay down a mould of religion of their own, and if they have a civil
life with men, and some formalitie of Religion toward God, they think
themselves well enough; how many such are there who thus breck their neck at
death? O! sad mistake.

A third cause of folks not dieing in Christ may be this, that there are many
who have some right thoughts and apprehensions of dieing well, but they never
seriously endeavor to bring them to practice, they seek not to have their
practice answerable to their light, they in effect make a prisoner of their
light, by putting a guard of corrupt affections about it; for either they take
ane absolute dispensation to themselves, as to some particular lust or sin, or
a liberty for such a time, and when that time is by they intend to quite and
abandon such a lust and to think on death, but they will not quite it yet, nor
prepare themselves for dieing; they must needs first have their families in
such a postour, they must have their children, or such a child provided for and
disposed of, they must have such or such a bussinesse put by their hand first;
not knowing or not considering that this hardens them and that they daily
become further slaves to such things, and that Judgment may suprize them
unawares, before their time come; there are many that will not deny but a
strict way of holiness is requisite, but they dow not, they cannot prevail
with themselves to fall about it yet; and are like that ill and sloathful
servant who because the Lord delayed his comeing, went to eat and drink and to
take his pastime, but his Master comes in ane hour when he is not looked for,
nor the servant awar, and on the sudden appoints him his portion with
Hypocrites; Ah! is it not thus with the most part, who if they get such a
sickness put by or such a cross dispensation over, they think that Christ
will bid a while longer, and so still they putt off till it becomes too late.

A fourth cause may be this, that few are serious in goeing about these things
that concern death, or in minding what will be their own case at death, few
very few make conscience to examine themselves and to search their bygone
ways, and therefore they know not their hazard; and among the many advantages
of selfe-examinatione this is a special one, that it notably fitts, through
Gods blessing, for dieing in the Lord, whereas when it is neglected, souls are
kept still securely sleeping and accounts lie over uncleared and unadjusted,
they neither distinctly know their danger nor their need of the remedy; all
their Prayers are by guess and at hap hasard, as it were, neither can they
comfort themselves in any duty they go about; we name these things not only
that ye may know them, but that ye may shun them, and that ye may withal
learn to draw some directions and duties out of them for your practice.

We come now to a third and main use of the general Doctrine, seeing it is of
such concernment to die in the Lord, as it has eternal happiness depending
upon it, let all of you seriously set yourselves to fall about such a way of
living, as when death comes ye may die in him; As ever ye would attain to this
happiness and eshew this misery whereof ye have been hearing, take I say,
such a way of living as death may find you in him.

To cleir and press this a little I shall speak a word to these three things;
1. Somewhat further to what dieing in the Lord is; 2. To some rules or
directions that all, who would solidly comfort themselves in the hope of dieing
in the Lord, would make use of, and walk by, in their life. 3. To the
necessity of taking these directions and walking according to them, even as
ye would have the comfort of these that die in the Lord; and of doing this
speedily without delay or dallieing.

For the First, we shall not insist in it having touched on it a little
before; what we would say of it now, we shall briefly sum up in these two; 1.
To some things that are in the affections that accompany a person that dies in
the Lord, or in some propperties that go alonge with it. 2. In something of
the grounds that these flow from.

For the first, there are these three things or propperties that go alonge
with dieing in the Lord, or with them that die in him, that are exceedingly
desyrable; 1. A dieing willingly and cheerfully, not goeing to death as to a
prison, but as through a trance to a palace, Its a dieing as old Simeon died,
Luke 2, Now (says he) let thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes
have seen thy Salvation; though death be the King of terrors, he heasteneth to
it; or it is a dieing as Paul died, who desired to be dissolved and to be with
Christ, as being best of all, 2. It is a dieing with holy confidence and
boldness, not with fear and terror or anxietie, doubtfullie disputing what
will become of them, but being confidently assured of a mansion in Heaven; We
know, says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 5. v. 1, 2. if the earthly house of this
tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God ane house not made with
hands eternal in the Heavens; for in this we groan earnestly, desyreing to be
clothed upon with our house which is from above; being confident that at death
his happy condition was but as it were beginning; to die in Christ makes a man
to set himself boldly against death and all its terrors. 3. Its a dieing not
only with peace and quietness but with complacency and satisfaction, and even
so that if the soul had its wish it desires no more, the man does not frett nor
complain that he is taken from a good and plentiful estate, from a fine and
commodious dwelling, from friends and relations, from honor and repute in the
world etc. but he dies with contentment being fully satisfied with his right
and tolooke to the fair inheritance above, this we may see in David, who
sweetly says and sings, 2 Samuel 23. 5. This is all my salvation and all my
desire, although he make not my house to grow: and therefore he will Ps. 23.
walk resolutlie through the Valley of the shadow of death and fear none evil,
because the Lord is with him: and indeed it is no small matter to die these
three ways, willingly, cheerfully, confidently and boldly, and with
quietness, contentment, and satisfaction. But secondly, the grounds that
these three flow from do mainlie answer and determine the questione, for its
not a counterfit willingness, nor a natural boldness or manliness of Spirit,
nor a carnally secure peace and quietness flowing from senselessnes, but such
willingness, boldness, and quietness as come and flow from these 3 pregnant
grounds: 1. From peace with God through Jesus Christ, the soul having reallie
fled for refuge to Jesus Christ and committed it self to him; faith says,
that is a good, sure, through, and everlasting bargane, and so the man rests on
it and has peace. 2, From a good conscience giving a good testimony, which is
ane excellent ground to come before Gods Judgment with; the testimony of a
good conscience either in respect of ane endeavored blameless life, or if the
man have not so a good conscience in that respect, but many failings and so
many challenges, yet he has a good conscience in respect of its being
sprinkled with the blood of Jesus, through whom all his failings and
transgressions are pardoned, which also takes in a good conscience of sincere
endeavor to study holiness. The third ground is, a livlie and distinct frame
of Spirit, whereby faith has some present acting on Christ, and on the
everlasting Covenant even in death, that the soul is by and by to meet with; we
will not say but there is a difference amongst their three; the first of them is
simply and absolutely necessary; and the second is necessary also in one of
the two forementioned respects; the third may not be always necessary (for a
beleiver may die in the rage of a fever, in a fit of high distemper, or in a
stupifieing palsy) yet it is always to be pursued and sought after, with
submission to Gods blessed will, and it conduces much to the beleivers
confidence and comfort, to have some present actings of faith in a distinct way
on Christ and on the Covenant of grace.

I suppose now that this is such a sweet condition to die in, as there is none
of you but would desire to be in it at your death; but let me say it, the most
part takes not the right way to attain it; Therefore in the second place let me
speak a little to these rules and directions that ye must needs seriously, and
in the strength of grace endeavor to live by, without which ye cannot with
well grounded confidence promise to yourselves these comforts at death, and the
blessedness that follows it.

And for the more cleir prosecuting of this, I shall first, in a word put by
that which is not the way of dieing in the Lord. And then secondly, I shall at
greater length propose to you the way wherein ye should walk, in order to the
attaining of this desyreable end.

First then, it is not the way of dieing in the Lord, to die in external
quietness, and with all our friends about us, or in a sort of calmness with
little pain or sickness, many heathens, many carnal and civil men, and many
hypocrites, have died that way; Its but a common outward thing, and many may,
and do slip quietly into the pit. Nor 2. Is it to be much taken up with bare
wishings and desyreings to die so, nay nor with some esteime of dieing in the
Lord, it is good indeed in so far, to wish and desire it, and to esteime of it,
but Balaam who had a most miserable exit, and made a very wretched end, came
that length, Numb. 24. and yet this is a great part of many folks Religion,
yea, the almost all of it, who it may be will now and then commend it when in a
good mood. Nor 3. is this the way of dieing in the Lord, to have some coldrife
Prayers to die so, and to be good friends with God, as we use to speak, there
are none so graceless but seeing that they must needs leave the world, would
rather be in Heaven then in Hell, and will readily have some general desires
after it, and words of Prayer for it, but that will not do the turn, for
many will seek to enter, that shall not be able; Luke 13. v. 24, many will
pray to be taken to Heaven that never walked, neither loved to walk, in the
right way to it; Nor 4. Is this the way of dieing in the Lord, to be taking
some pains in the externals of holiness, to be hearing preachings, and
frequenting Communions, if that be all, it will not do the turn neither: It
will not be sufficient that ye heard Christ preach and satt at one table with
him; halfeing of holiness is no holiness, to be almost a Christian will not
make a Christian indeed, there is a necessity of being a Christian altogether;
to have half holiness, and to be almost a Christian only, will be but to be
half saved, and that will be indeed no salvation, but will period in eternal
damnation, and so cannot be dieing in the Lord. Nor 5. Is it to die with a
persuasion in our own mind, but ill grounded, that we are in him and that all
shall be well, many take themselves to be well and in a good and safe
condition, because they trow it, and fancy that they are so, and they are
very unwilling and loath to let themselves think ill of themselves: When we
speak then of dieing in the Lord, it must be such as will abide Gods trial,
and it is not he that commends himself, but he whom God Commends, that will
abyd his trial and be approven.

But secondly, what then will do it? may you say; we shall (as we promised)
commend to you some rules to walk by, for attaining this end of dieing in the
Lord; and ye shall take them in several directions, but we will not now in the
close of this discourse enter on the particulars, only take this word in the
general; that all these who propose this end to themselves, would previously
take along with them their three necessary antecedents; 1. That they have their
peace made with God through faith in Christ, and that they see well they be not
living with a standing quar^el betwixt God and them, for its by faith that we
are united to him, and without faith we cannot be in him, and so cannot
possibly die in him. 2. This would be taken alonge, not only to have faith in
Christ, and our peace made with God through him, but to know that we have it, to
know in whom we have believed; It is true this is not essential as the former,
yet it is hardly possible to die comfortably and confidently without it,
therefore Christians are exhorted, 2 Pet. 1. Give diligence to make your calling
and election sure. 3. That they be exercised to keep a good conscience in all
things, and always toward God and toward men, Its impossible in ane ordinary
way to die well except folks endeavor seriously and singly to keep a good
conscience along their life, and to squair the same according to the rule of
the word, and walk suteablie to their profession; All these three are put
together by the Apostle Peter, 2 Pet. 1. v. 5. He wills them to whom he writes,
to add to their faith the exercises of the other graces of the Spirit, then,
v. 10. he exhorts them to give diligence to make their calling and election
sure; and then by so doing, he assures that ane entrance shall be ministered to
them to the everlasting Kingdom, which is as if he had said, by fastening your
faith on Christ, by the exercise of grace, and by studieing to make your
calling and election sure by well doing, a wide door shall be made to you at
death to enter into Heaven, and ye shall have the greater comfort and
confidence to lay down your life; whereas on the contrary when Christians do
much neglect the fastening and fixing of their faith, the exercise of grace,
and the making of their calling and election sure, the entry is strait and
difficult, and others that altogether neglect these things, do find the door
quitte shutt and no entry at all: If there were no more spoken but these three
words, to be in Christ by faith, to live in him by the exercise of faith and
other graces, keeping a good conscience toward God and men, and to make your
calling and election sure, they might furnish you with work and duty to take
you up all your days; and they may also serve to convince and reprove many
who vainly intertaine themselves with the hope and expectation of dieing in
Christ, but do not at all be-take themselves to this way of being, and living
in him, even to go with a blecked face and a stoped mouth to the throne of
grace, and cordially close with Christ's Offer, being content to adhere to him
for righteousness, and utterly to renounce their own, and then in a way of
diligence in duty, and by the fruits of a new nature and life, to evidence
their union with him; this is the very marrow and substance of what we would
be at, and that which is the hinge of our salvation, even the right exercise of
faith for righteousness, the right exercise of grace for sanctification, and the
right setting of ourselves ere death come, to have the grounds of our interest
sure and clear; But such of you as have taken no pains to walk in this way,
but still walk on, and continue in, your own old ^arnal way, ye cannot
warrantably expect the benefits and comforts that flow from faith in Christ,
and from walking in him, and these are, to die in him and to reign with him;
now God himself bless this word and make it useful to you.

SERMON IV.
Revel. 14: 13. Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, etc.
IT is ane easy matter to speak and hear of the most spiritual and highly
concerning truths, in comparison of what it is to make them practicable, and
hence it comes to pass, that so many speak and hear of them, and that so few
practice them, and the neirer that truths or duties come to press upon us the
mortification of our lusts, and to abstract us from the world, or to prepare us
for dieing, we are the loather and the more reluctant to engadge in the
practice of them, and to keep closse at it; Its a hard and difficult business
to be both living and dieing at once; though every man living may be said to
be dieing daily in so far as he is hastening to it: And therefore seeing what
follows concerns your practice, and is the maine and most material use of
this great doctrine, let one and other hearken diligently and give ear to what
we are to say from God on this important subject, with a serious purpose and
resolution to practice, for it will not otherwise be of advantage to you, and
ye would so prepare yourselves though grace to hear, as ye may firmly resolve
to keep that which is of so great and everlasting concernment to you.

We (...) last occasion at ane use of exhortation, commending to you the right
way of living so as when death comes, ye may have some well grounded hope of
dieing in the Lord; And we proposed three things in prosecuting this use to be
spoken of. 1. What we called dieing in him, and we show it was to have solid
faith and cleirnesse of Interest in Christ, cheirfulnesse and comfort,
quietness and satisfaction in dieing, a most desyreable and comfortable
condition when we enter the lists with death, even to have this confidence that
we are in him and shall die in him.

We come secondly, to some directions that are so many steps in the way to the
attaining of this comfortable end of dieing in the Lord, we entered on them in
General, and now are to prosecute them a little further, through the help of Gods
grace; Before we could be particular in directions, we show that these three
things behoved to preceed; 1. There would be flieing to Christ by faith, and
making peace with God through him; 2. There would be endeavoring to make our
calling and election sure by well doing, for though our Justification before
God depend not on our cleirnesse in this, yet much of our comfort and
confidence depends on it, and it is no doubt our duty to labor to make it
sure. 3. There would be a holy walk whereby we may have a good conscience at
Christ's appearing, for there can never be boldness and confidence where there
is a stinging conscience within, and challenges for sinning against light.

To proceed then more particularly to these directions, how to live as ye may
die well, wherein if we should be large and say all that might be said to this
purpose, it would lead us to speak of all the duties of holiness, and that
with respect to all the conditions of our life, sickness and health,
prosperity and adversity etc; to our particular and general callings, and to
all events; for as we carry in these, so we may expect to die, but these being
general we shall pass them, and only propose some five or six directions in
order to men's dieing in Christ, as the great scope of this doctrine.

The first direction is, seek to establish yourselves in the faith of these
general truths that concern your dieing, especially to be established and
confirmed in the faith of death, judgment and eternity, wherein it will be
either well or ill with you for evermore; And this is not only to have a
general conviction of the truth of these, but by meditation to draw them down
to particular application to yourselves, that ye will die, that after death ye
will come to Judgment and be eternally happy or miserable; for as we said
before, one of the great evils that cherishes Atheism, is men's living as if
they were never to die; so then it is a fundation of well doing, solidlie to
believe death, judgment, and eternity, and they can never live well who lay
not this for a ground, that they will die and come to Judgment, and who
consider not what will readily be their challenges at death, that they may seek
to answer them now, and what may be their tentations, that they may be guarded
against them; Therefore ye would be established in the faith of these generals,
and endeavor to draw death and judgment neir to you, you would pursue them
closse in your meditation; Suppose that death were this very night approaching
you, consider with yourselves if ye durst appear before Gods tribunal to be
judged; more of this in our thoughts would help us, through Gods blessing, to
mortify lusts, and to give death little to do when it comes; But the truth is,
the most part never think seriously on death, and because they desire not
another life then the present, they shun to think of death; I commend the
necessity of this to you from the great averseness that your carnal hearts
and humors have from the serious and stayed thoughts of it, I pose you that
are given to pleasure, can ye endure to think on dieing? And you that are
glutting and surffetting yourselves with the world, Dow ye abyd to think on
that word, Thou fool this night thy soul shall be taken from thee, and whose
shall these things be? And you that are profane, dow ve think on that sad
sound of the trumpet, arise dead and come into Judgment; that word of Job is
meet to be carried along with you, I know thou will bring me unto death, though
the good man was mistaken in thinking he would die at that time, yet he knew he
would die ere long, and be brought unto Judgment after death, and carried along
with him the thoughts of it: And if we would be induced to try our prepareing
for death by these thoughts, how few of us would be found to mind it, though it
be of everlasting concernment? Ah! how few hours are taken to think upon it? if
ye were to come before men or ane humane court with a cause that much concerned
you in the world, how would ye think of it before hand, and think of it again?
and yet the most momentuous of these are but very triffles, being compared
with this great cause and case of conscience, how you shall die, and appear
before the great God his Judgment seat.

The second direction is, that though all duties of holiness be requisite, yet
there are some particular duties that ye would in a special manner make
conscience of (without neglecting any other called*for duty) as having a
special influence on preparation for dieing, and as comeing neirest (to say so)
to death, though much slighted. As 1. the duty of selfe-searching and
examination, we would be very impartial in selfe-examination and in comp^ing
with God; If men (as Solomon exhorts) should see to the state of their herds
and of their flocks, much more should they see to the condition of their souls:
Is it possible, think ye, to die confidentlie and comfortablie if ye be not
acquainted with the state of your spiritual affairs, and endeavor not to have
your accounts with God stated and adjusted? If there be a plague on men it is
the neglect of this; and if there be ane aw-band and restraint on their Spirits
from unsuteable latituds and lousnesse, its the conscionable practice of this
duty; that which makes death so terrible to many, is their living, some 30,
some 40, some 50, some 60, years; without having ever endeavored to fit their
accounts with God, let be to have them discharged. 2. The exercise of
repentance (which is alace^a rare thing even among Christians in these days)
is a special duty to be gone about in order to our dieing in Christ, that when
we see ourselves wrong in any thing (as many wrongs may be easily found in
the forementioned search) we let them not lie over, but be earnest with God
till we get a discharge, and that cannot be gotten till repentance be
exercised; where this grace of repentance is, it has faith always with it,
and it makes the heart tender, and removes challenges which make death
terrible, it is also a great enemy to security, presumption, and pride, and
keeps the heart withal melting, and much in pouring out itself before God;
the want whereof in these days Kythes in the coldness of our duties of
avorship, and in the carnalnesse of our walk; however they that would die in
the Lord, would study to be found much in the exercise of this grace (we do
here indifferently design these, duties or graces,) for if repentance be
called for when the Kingdom of Heaven is neir, then sure it is called for,
when death is neir, and there is nothing more requisite then a kindly penitent
heart as a spurr to chase to Jesus Christ, when we are to meet with him at
death. 3. A third duty, is the exercise of mortification, it is a painful but
a profitable duty, to be crucified to the world, to die to our lusts and
carnal delights; by mortification we mean not only that which takes away the
dominion of sin, and setts on to the study of holiness, but that which plucks
up the roots and tapouns of sin, and slayes the motions of it, and as it were,
weids it out of the heart, that which puts you to mortify your distempers and
passions of invye, anger, pride, inordinat desires etc. And to seek to have your
affections heavenly, which notably fits for dieing in the Lord. A 4. duty
that would be carefully practiced, is sobriety, let your moderation, says
the Apostle, be known to all men, the Lord is at hand, mortification looks
much to things in themselves sinful and unlawful, I say much, though I will not
say only, and sobriety looks to things lawful in themselves, wherein
insobrietie is the bain and plague of many, who being so glued to the things
of a world, and to these delyts and pleasures which are lawful in themselves,
and whereof a moderat use is allowed, that they are entangled and fettered with
them and made as unfitt for dieing, by their insobrietie in them, as by their
doing of some things that are in themselves sinful, O! how does inordinat
love to children, friends, lands, houses, farms, oxen, and to the married
wife, unfitt them for dieing, therefore the Apostle exhorts Christians, 1 Pet.
1. To gird up the loins of their mind, to be sober (...) hope to the end; for
when men are unsober in the use of the creatures, they are like to these that
have long garments which take the feet from them, as it were, and impede them in
their walking and at their work, when the affections hang loose and drag on the
earth and the things that are in it, and the mind takes liberty to vaig and
roave after these things, the man cannot be bussie at his main work, or make
progress in his Journey to Heaven; but sobriety fitts him for his work and
makes the way easy to him, makes him well content with his house or place and
station and with whatever is his condition and lot in the world, it suffers not
his affections to be entangled with them, it makes him so to use this world as
not abuseing it; As the Apostle exhorts, 1 Cor. 7. to have a sort of sanctified
denyednesse to a lawful use of the creature comforts, that the heart be not
glutted and surffetted with them, from which, our blessed Lord Jesus does most
powerfully diswade, Luke 21. v. 34. where he says, Take head least at any
time your hearts be overcharged with surffetting and drunkenness and the cares
of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares; where he plainly
insinuats (which is strange and little believed and considered) that there is
ane overcharge by cares about the things of this life lawful in themselves, as
well indisposeing and unfitting for death and Judgment, as ane overcharge with
surffetting and drunkenness is. This sobriety prepares for dieing in the
Lord, to which preparation on the contrary, ane overcharge with worldly cares
is a mighty impediment, as these words of our Lord put beyond all debeat;
especially when these two are trysted together, a distempered mind with such
worldly cares within, and many tentations and stumbling blocks from without.

A third direction is, they that would die in the Lord would carry the thoughts
of death along with them, as if every day and moment were their last, and as if
they were just now to appear before God, and as if they were holily indifferent
what hour or moment he would call upon them, for God has set (as to our
knowledge of it) no time precisly to our living here; it is observed by some on
Eccles. 3. that there is a time for every thing, a time to be borne, a time to
die, a time to laugh, and a time to weep, but there is none for living, for
none can say I must or I shall live till to morrow, therefore he bids the
porter watch, and would have all standing with their Armor on them in a
watchful posture, waiting for their Lords coming that he come not on them
unawarse; nunc age quod moriturus agas, do that now which thou would be
found doing when death comes, has been ane old and excellent saying.

It may be objected or queried here, is it possible that a beleiver can always
actually remember Christ's coming and carry the thoughts of death along with
him? Answ. It is in this duty as in others, as when it is said do all to the
Glory of God, it is not so to be understood as if we could actuallie mind it
all-alonge in every thing we do, our minds being but finit, and so unable
actually to mind many things or different things in the same instant of time or
at once, that is impossible, but as there is a habitual minding of the glory
of God, so there is a habitual minding of Christ's appearance, which implies
these three things. 1. That when in cold blood (to say so) and at ourselves, we
resolve to wait for, and carry ourselves sutablie to the expectation of his
appearing, and to do nothing that we would shun or think shame of, or would
not desire to be found doing, if he were appearing; which is in effect to be
continually on our watch. 2. That when ever we take ourselves napping, we
stir up ourselves to ane actual minding of it, and endeavor to squair the
actions of our life accordingly, asking our own hearts, if we durst do this or
that if he were to appear, and accordingly to be sweyed with the aw of his
appearing. 3. That in our ordinary walk, we be often reviveing the thoughts of
Christ's appearing, putting ourselves often in mind of this rule, even to walk
so as if he were immediately to appear; hence beleivers are often styled in the
Scripture, waiters for, and lovers of, his appearing; and hence also the duty
of watching is so frequently commended to them: so then we would not have this
so universallie to be understood, as if beleivers were to do nothing more, nor
if it were spoken by a voice from heaven that they would presently die, or that
Christ were presently to appear, for then they would leave many actions undone,
and leave off lawful Journeys and Voiadges, and other actions they are called
to, but the meaning is, that we endeavor to be found in, or at, nothing, we
will think shame of when he appears, and in all things always to keep a good
conscience, a conscience void of offense toward God and toward man.

A fourth direction is this, these that would die in the Lord would be
timeously acquainting themselves with the cross of Christ and not seeking
after a pampered life, or to have the world at their will, but learning to
fold, bow, and stoup to difficulties and straits; not that I would have any
procureing crosses to themselves, but as they would not procure them, so they
would not peremptorly determine to eshew them when the Lord calls to take them
on, and bear them; but 1. they would carry along a resolution to fold to
crosses when they come. 2. When they come, they would neither with sinful
anxietie, seek to shun them, nor would they lie down discouradged under them,
but deny themselves, take up their cross pleasantly, and cheerfullie, and
follow Christ. 3. They that have personal freedom from crosses would kindly
sympathise with them that are under the cross, Hence Solomon says, that it is
better to be in the house of (...) then in the house of feasting, Eccles. 7. v.
2. there is a greater good to be had there nor in the house where there is
banqueting, revelling, and carrousing; The reason is, because few living in
prosperity are content and disposed to die, and adversity does best loose
folks grips from the world; O! it is hard to be glutting in the things of the
world, and to live in a prosperous and plentiful condition, and not to be
withdrawn thereby from spiritual things; Therefore is the cross and dieing to
the world so much commended, for little crosses are, as it were, bitts of death
or little deaths and pieces of the curse, as well as death itself is (though by
the death of Christ they are turned into blessings to beleivers) and if we be
habituat to these little deaths, there will be a much easier yiedling to the
great*death, and less to do when it comes.

A fifth direction is, that we study to die daily, and it is drawn from the
Apostles words, 1 Cor. 15 31. I protest by your rejoyceing, which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily; which not only setts out his hazard
daily, but his seeking to prevent death, in dieing while he was living and ere
death came, and it implies, 1. a conviction carried along with him of the
necessity of dieing. 2. A looking on the continual hazard of dieing; 3. A
preparation for, and continual readiness to die; and 4. Ane activenesse in
essaying to die, or ane acting of death, in a manner, before death come: We
would follow the same way and be frequentlie putting ourselves before Gods
bar, and considering how we will answer deaths call, bowing our stubborn
humor that it may not be found untractable at death, doing that every day
that we would be found doing when death comes, studieing to have all things in
that order that we would desire to have them in then, and habituating ourselves
(as I said) to dieing; when going to our Prayers in the morning, to put
ourselves in such a postour as if we were no more to go abroad in the world,
and lyeing down at night, as if we were not to rise again in the morning, and
when we speak or do, to speak and do like men that have not long time to live
after our speaking or doing.

The sixth and last direction shall be this, that ye would put in practice what
your own conscience, your light according to the Scriptures, and the means ye
have, hold out as necessary for making and keeping of your peace with God,
and the keeping off of a quarrel betwixt him and you; This ordinarily is one of
the main challenges that meets folks at death, that they have suspended the
practice of many things they were convinced of, that they have shifted,
delayed, and putt off seasons and opportunities of called*for duties, and have
sitten down on this side of them; that they have not reformed such faults as
they were convinced of etc. it is commonly said of laws, that we had need of
one law to make other good laws be put in execution, and so have we need of
some one direction to help us to make other directions practicable, according
to that word, Eccles. 9: 10. Whatsoever thy hand finds to do, do it with
all thy might, for there is no work, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, nor devyce in
the grave whither thou go; we are all posting on toward our grave, and
there is no doing of duties nor mending of faults there; therefore what ever
the light of the word, and of our conscience well informed thereby, cleirs to
be duty we would be serious and diligent in the doing of it, and in the
doing of it without delay: and if this one thing were made conscience of, it
would do more, through Gods blessing, then many: your consciences are convinced
I suppose, that the former directions are very helpful, and that such as live
thus will die the better, but alace! Many of you do not so much as think on
them let be practice them; it may be they shall not be in your thoughts till
this day eight days, and when it is so to what purpose are all directions, for
what use serve they? Are they not, think ye, useless unless they be put in
practice? Therefore put not by this as a thing of little concernment; death is
the door to heaven, and death is at the door; and living well is the way to
dieing well, and as ye would live and die in the Lord, ye would lay weight on
these directions, and fall about the practice of them in the strength of his
own grace.

But before we proceed any further, though there may be a conviction that what
has been said is all true, yet there will be ane inward murmuring against it
with many profain persons and readily two objectiones will be started by such.

The first objection will probably be this, if none die well but such as
be-take themselves to such a way of living, who will or can die well? Such a
life is impossible to us, therefore we will hold on in our own way and hope
well; many when they hear such doctrine are ready to think and say as they did,
John. 6. Who after they had murmured at Christ's discourse, said verse. 41. This
is a hard saying who can bear it? We shall by this means, will they say, be
restrained in our liberty, we shall thus be putt to haunt always the house of
mourning, and never suffered once to laugh or smile (although that be not our
meaning, to keep men from being mirry and cheirfull when called to be so, but
to keep from being carnal, and to set just bounds to them in their mirth);
But for answer to these men's question, we would; 1. Ask them this Question, is
this the truth of God, that such as would die in him must aim and endeavor to
live as we have said? Is living well the way to dieing well, and dieing well
the gate to Glory? If so, will it then, think ye, be a satisfieing answer to
God to tell him, that though this way of living is the way chalked out by thee
for dieing well, yet we cannot close with it, we cannot walk in it, its so
uneasy and so narrow a way? If it be Gods way will ye putt it off so? Or will
ye carve out another way then God hes carved out to you? 2. Let me ask such, is
not the gate strait and the way narrow that leads to heaven and eternal life?
Will ye not therefore go to heaven through such a gate and way? And is not the
way of living so as to die well and in the Lord the way to heaven, and must it
not have difficulty in it? And yet thirdly let me say to such, that this way
is but difficult and uneasy to corrupt nature, to a proud and carnally
delicate heart that cannot endure in the least to be disquieted in the
enjoyment of its sensual pleasures and delyts, and to a sinful selfish humor
that will not stoup to God, yet to such as love to walk in this way, all the
duties are possible and the difficulties superable through grace, yea it is
thorrow-out a most pleasant path and way, Philip. 4. verse. 13. Prove. 3. verse.
17.

They will secondly object, all yonder things the man speaks of may be true,
nay we cannot deny but they are true, yet we may be doing and yet hope through
Gods mercy to win to heaven; have not many who have lived even as we do died
well and been saved? And such will readily have the thief on the cross to
cast up, which would in reason speak to them for their reclaiming, and from
this they profainly conclude that they may hold on their own way, and yet hope
to mend and grow better at length and so to get mercy when they die; but for
answer; 1. O! Thou graceless and profaine wretch is that the use thou makes of
mercy, even to sin because God is merciful, and to sin that grace may abound?
Is that the end of Gods revealing his grace and mercy, to make him a minister
of sin? How can ye look mercy in the face that so abuse mercy? And yet O! How
ryfe is this among profain souls, to sin because God is merciful, to abuse
his grace and make him, as I said, a minister of sin? Consider of it, if ye
will dar to look grace and mercy in the face that have thus stumbled and
brocken your necks on them. Secondly though there be some that God has given
mercy to at their death, yet how many are they who have sinned presumptously
and have gotten mercy? The theife on the cross, it is true, got mercy, but
did he ever despise and abuse Gods grace and mercy as ye do? It is one thing
to sin out of infirmity and humbly to pray for, and to expect mercy, and
another thing to sit warneings, and profainly to turn the grace of God into
wantonness, and yet to have a presumptuous hope of mercy. Thirdly how many
are there in hell, and how few are there in heaven who have lived as ye do?
Gods Judgment has come upon them and surprised them, so that they got never
leave to repent nor seek after Gods mercy, and they are now smarteing for
delaying to embrace the offer of mercy, and for their despiseing of it, and
cannot mend it? How many are like the rich glutton crying in the place of
torment, who if they were permitted to speak to you would say, go tell these
our Brethren that they put not off time, and that they dally not in their day
with the offers of grace and mercy as we did, least they come into this place
of torment with us. Fourthlie, Who ever got mercy to whom their sin has not
been bitter to them? And will ye continue in that which has been so bitter to
others? If ever ye get mercy ye must come to it, thorrow the way of
repentance, and by weeping-crosse, to say so, and it shall be more bitter to
you soon or syne, then all the pleasure ye had in sin was sweet to you.

The third and last thing to be spoken to, is some few Considerations to press
the necessity of taking these directions, and of walking according to these
rules, that ye may not be unfruitful hearers but doers of this truth; for it is
practice* that is the life of Religion, and if any thing ought to be
practiced, sure this is it, even to learn the right airt of dieing in the
Lord; And therefore that ye may not decline it; Consider, 1. Whither or not the
authority of God and of his Son Jesus Christ lays on this doctrine, if there
be a command for it, that all that expect a dieing in Christ should live in
him, and if to die in him be a duty, then to make use of these means and
directions that conduce to it, must lykewayes be a commanded duty, and these
must be the true and faithful sayings of God; it is a wonder that ye can have
any thing to say against them, for ye cannot deny them to be the truths of
God, and yet as it is Psalm. 50. ye (many of you I mean) cast them behind your
backs, ye will not it may be bow a knee to God in prayer when ye go home, ye
will not so much as ask yourselves what postour your soul is in for all that
has been or can be said; remember that ye will have God and not us to make ane
account unto; and therefore any of you that have consciences and any the least
measure of rendernesse in them, mind these duties, or know that ye shall, will
ye nill ye, be the more unexcuseable; if we darr confidentlie press any truth
upon you, Its this anent dieing in Christ, and holiness as the way to it, as
the sum and scope of all our preaching, which will only do you good as it
works to this end; And therefore let us with all earnestness obtest you to
think more seriously on your dieing in Christ, and in order to that, on your
living in him and to him that ye may have boldness at his appearing,
otherwise we do seriously and solemnlie protest unto you in the Name of God,
that you shall never see his blessed face, nor enjoy his blessed followship.

The second consideration is taken from your own great advantage, and the
mighty concernment that is in giving obedience to these directions, though
there be a second death to them who make not ready for the first, yet there is
but one death to all of you as to the final sentence, and upon this depends
Heaven and Hell and the eternal condition of your immortal souls, whither they
shall be under the curse of God drinking of the cupe of his Wrath for ever, or
under his blessing drinking the cup of his love for ever, whither they shall be
in the case of enemies, or in the case of friends, whither they shall enjoy
Gods company or have the company of Devils; And think ye the^e is no ods or
difference betwixt these two, blessedness and misery? and are ye not
concerned which of these two shall befall you and be your lote for ever more,
are ye beasts that have no immortal souls? or are ye Heathens that never heard
of the right way to Heaven and happiness, that ye should thus walk on in the
broad way that leads to Hell and destruction, and turn your backs upon the
narrow way because it is narrow, and so willfullie precipitat yourselves into
the bottomless pit, and into the deep gulf of Gods curse and wrath for ever?
How little soever ye may think of these things now, yet ye shall, if ye look not
to it, to your eternal cost find the certain and sad truth of them one day.

A third Consideration is drawn from the great work that there is about death,
and when it comes to dieing, and when the immortal soul must be dislodged and
leave the body, and will not possibly be got kept any longer in it; ye
never made such a voyadge, ye never had such a piece of work in hand as this
will be found to be, when infirmities of the body grow on you a-pace, and at a
great height, when the encumberance and fashrie (to say so) of the things of
the world, when the affection of relations and friends, when eternity stareing
you in the face, when the Devil the great accuser, not only of the brethren
but of all other men, with his libels waiting on, when the Law in its passing
the sentence and curseing every transgressor, when Christ's dreadful sentence,
depart from me ye cursed etc. are all to be met with and encountered at once;
and when the conscience within will be clamouring to you that ye were not at all
sollicitous and careful to eshew that sad sentence; and beside all these ye
will yet have a greater party to deal with then your conscience, even the
great God the just and righteous Judge of all the earth, and O! but it be a
fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, and when withal ye
shall have a multitude of challenges and tentations to enter the lists with,
this will be found another sort of thing then a Journey to London, or a voiadge
to Holland, France or Spain, or to the east or west Indies; and think ye who
have put by and spent all your life in vanity, that ane hour or two, or a
little time at death will be enough for prepareing you to encounter with it? O!
sad and soul-ruining mistake, are there not many poor wretched souls when
death comes, who are forced to wish, Oh! if we had another lifetime to live, we
would spend it better, and with such a wish as that, poor souls, they slip away.

Consider fourthlie, the connection that God has established betwixt your
dieing in the Lord and the following of these directions, betwixt holiness and
happiness, now holiness is not the speaking of some good words when ye come
to die, otherwise why should it be so much pressed in your life? the end of
holiness is Heaven and happiness, and the end of the broad way of profanitie
and formalitie, is Hell and destruction; It is true, as I have often said, that
God may pluck some by a miracle of his grace out of the broad way at their
death, but they are very few with whom he deals so; the way to destruction is
broad and easy, and many walk in it; O! how is this road beaten by
multitudes of passengers, and usuallie as men live so they die, if they live
wickedlie they die accursedlie and fall into perdition, hence is that proverb,
such a life such ane end; a man that is worldlieminded, or presumptuous and
selfe-conceated in his life, ordinarlie dies so; And can ye promise to
yourselves a comfortable death if ye live profainlie or hypocriticallie? be not
deceaved God will not be mocked, for if ye sow to the flesh alonge your life,
ye shall most certainly of the flesh reap corruption at your death; O! know
therefore and believe the absolute necessity of living well, of living in, and
to the Lord, if ye would die well and in the Lord.

Fifthlie, Consider and think seriously upon the great hazard ye are in of
spiritual Judgments, if so be ye neglect holiness and the following of these
directions in your life, be affrayed of blindning, hardening, of delusion, of a
reprobat mind etc, be affrayed that though ye should get a long time before
death, that yet ye may never get grace to repent who thus delay and put it off
so long; if ye then would die well and prevent such plagues, live holily, or if
ye care not to die miserably, go on in your profanitie or in your presumption
notwithstanding of the hazard of being thus plagued, and of perishing at the
last, on the fancied hope of mercy, for one of these ways ye must live and
die; but we say again, consider what spiritual Judgments ye may fall under in
your delaying, ye know not but a commission may come forth from God to his word
and messengers, to make your heart fatt, your eyes blind, and your ears heavy
etc. such a sad commission as the Prophet Isaiah get^s in the sixth Chapter of
his prophecy to many of his then-hearers; It may be a challenge has been
resisted, or a motion of the Spirit quenched at this very time, and who knows
but ye may never henceforth meet with another that shall do you good? are
there not many Judgments of this kind rained on sinners daily? are not many
preached blind, deaff, and hard, so that the plainest, clearest, and most
home-pressed truths have no more influence on them then upon as many stocks
or stones? and whence is this I pray? Is it not from your not making use of
the light holden forth to you from this Word of God, and from your resisting,
stiffling, and smothering of challenges and motions of the Spirit ye have had?
because of which God smites you with senselessnesse.

Sixtlie, Consider what possible advantage there is or can be in delaying this
so necessary a work, and what certain prejudice there is in it, 1. There is
no advantage, for the longer ye continue to delay ye are still the further
behind, and the further out of the way, and the greater will be the difficulty
to get yourselves recovered, there will still be more guilt contracted, and
more challenges to deal with, and the greater labor to get your Spirits put
into a good frame which ye have so much and so long distempered; yea, it will
be a piece of a begun hell to you, when ye consider how ye have brought
yourselves to such a woeful necessity of hastering, mangleing, and spoiling
all that work and bussinesse that ye should have gone about so deliberatlie,
orderly, timeouslie, and carefully in the time of your health; so that all
your advantage will be but more sin, and that will bring on a greater heap of
desperate sorrow and wrath. Secondly, ye will not only have no advantage but
ye will have much prejudice by it, for beside what has been said, ye cannot
comfortablie answer deaths call and summonds to appear before the tribunal of
the great Judge; How many of you if ye were to die just now and never to go
out of this Church alive, how many are there, I say, of you that could not
have peace and comfort at your death? If the walls of this house were shaking,
would not horror take hold on you, as pangs of a woman in travel? It may be
some that are beleivers in Christ would be somewhat disquieted and a little
surprised, yet they would soon through grace recollect themselves and be
composed, but could the most part of you lay down your life with peace,
calmness, and comfort if death should thus come upon you now or before to
morrow? and you are not sure but it may, for you know not what may befall you
ere ye go home, nor when ye lie down if ever ye shall rise again; And is it
possible that ye can have peace or comfort on solid grounds when death comes,
if ye be not found having your peace made with God through Jesus Christ, and
walking in the way of holiness? It will be put poor and cold comfort then, to
think that you have made such ane advantageous bargain in the world, that you
have such a land-estate or so much money, such a commodious dwellinghouse, so
fine orchards or gardings, or such a well furnished shope etc. that one word
will mar all that comfort, fool this night they shall require thy soul, and
whose then shall all these things be?

Seventhlie, Consider the particular crosses, infirmities, and afflictions ye
are under and may be shortly under, which may put you in mind of dieing, and
invite you to make for a change to the better; now ye are in health, within a
little ye may fall sick; now ye are in saftie, and by and by ye may be in
hazard; do not so many changes call on you aloud to make for ane unchangeable
estate, and to endeavor to make sure that it may be a happy one?

And now when we have spoken both to directions, and considerations pressing
and enforceing the practice of them, for ordering our life and walk with a due
regaird to dieing, and to dieing in the Lord; we are affrayed that it shall be
but as water spilt on the ground, and but little further the conviction and
edification of many of us, which God only can prevent; and therefore we shall
shutt up all with a word to two sorts of you; The 1. is to you that are
stricken deaff and dead with the spiritual Judgments of God, who no more
regaird or mind your immortal souls then if ye had none at all, who live
rather like beasts then like reasonable men and women, or like pagans rather
then like Christians, what through carnal joveltie and mirth in some, what
through prophanitie and mocking of piety in other some, what through idleness
in a third sort, what through the earthly mindedness and grovelling in the
world that is in a fourth sort, and what through security, formalitie, and
hypocrisy that reigns in the greatest part; I assure you in the name of the
Lord, that death is comeing and God will not be mocked, as ye sow so ye shall
reap; think ye it sufficient preparation for death, or a suitable readiness to
die, to laugh and sport and play over your time, or to have your buildings
goeing up, and your bargains goeing on? beguile not yourselves there is a
reckoning quickly coming which will be very sad, and many of you will find
yourselves behind and at a loss in the maine business: do not think, Sirs,
that we speak their words for the fashion, your case requires them all, and
therefore yet again as ye would eshew the evil and misery that follows the
slighting of such a warning, do not put it easily and lightly by you, for
the Lords sake, for it is hugelie above all your greatest concerns in the
world, to look for death and to provyde for it. The second word shall be to you
that thorrow grace have begun to provide for it and are fallen slack, remiss
and negligent, O! be alarmed and roused up to diligence; Alace! but few
carefully and conscionablie study the airt of dieing well and in the Lord,
and make in any tolerable measure as they ought, for their appearing before
Christ's tribunal; look Christians to the tract of the best of your lives, and
how unsuteable it is and how short of that it should be, there is (alace!) much
carnalnesse, ruggedness, and untendernesse amongst us, much formalitie and
overlinesse in duties of worship, much earthlie-mindednesse, much passion, much
pride and vanity; It is a wonder that any, who have the faith of their
appearing before God, should dar to play such untender pranks (to say so) and
to take such unsuteable latitudes to themselves beside the rule, and to have so
groffe, so carnal, and so uncircumspect a walk as many of us have; Study more
tenderness Christians, for the Lords sake, otherwise though you will get
your souls for a prey, and will arrive at last safe at that harbor of rest
prepared for the people of God, yet ye may and will probably have a very
unpleasant and uncomfortable voyage not without several tempests and storms
sometimes threatening utter shipwrak, and find a very strait and difficult
entering into the port; when death comes to look you in the face, and when you
begin to think of your being so near to ane appearance before God, you may be
in considerable fear; now the Lord himself* whose word this is, make it
effectual for your edification and advantage through Jesus Christ.

SERMON V.
Revel. 14: 13. Blessed are the dead, which die in the Lord, etc.
IT has been ane old saying of many, that none can be called blessed before
their death, though possibly in the sense that some Heathens took it, it be
not sound, yet we who are Christians may say, if death be not taken in, and if
a man be not blessed at his death he is not blessed at all, and though death
after a very short whiles abode in the world putts men out of time, yet it
has a long train of eternal consequen^s following it, appearance before God
in Judgment, and everlasting well or ill being, are no trivial nor light
matters; and yet as men close their eyes in time at death, so they may expect
the misery or comfort that Judgment and eternity will bring along with them;
and it is the great scope and design of this Scripture to commend to you
dieing well from the blessedness that accompanies and follows it.

We were in the forenoone pressing, as we could, the practice of some directions
how to prepare for death, and shall now speak a little to one question ere we
proceed to make any further use of the doctrine, and it is this.

What shall they do at death who have quite neglected these directions, or not
so minded them as they should have done, and who are brought in a surprise of
providence, ere they be awar, near the border and brink of eternity, who have
but few days or rather hours to live and cannot promise one to themselves? A
very concerning question, (and O! That folk would study to prevent it by
minding the former directions in time) and withal a difficult question to
answer solidly and cautiously; for indeed it is not easy to speak to dieing
persons (what ever many may think of it) who when they are living will not
hear; and therefore let none make a wrong use of what shall be said to the
question, and this certainly is one wrong use of it, to delay time and to shift
preparing for death till it come on you; but first, put this question seriously
to yourselves, how ye should live that ye may not have such a question to ask
at your death, and that ye may eshew the anxietie that such a question has
with it at such a time; ye will very readily ask the question but heartleslie
in sickness, who in your health putt it off carelesslie till death surprise
you, and therefore be rather in holy dread of that time when it may be ye will
scarcely get ane hour to think on the bussinesse, or it may be get none to
speak to you to give you clearness about it, or possibly ye may not have
liberty for pain and sickness to think on it, or to hear one speak to you
anent it, which should in reason stir you up by all suitable means to
endeavor to be in a good, meet, and ready postour before that time come. But
to speak a little in answer to the question, we shall distinguish
unpreparednesse for dieing in three sorts or kinds of it, or there may be three
sorts of persons that may be suprised by death in ane unprepared condition, and
to each of these we shall speak a word. 1. There is one sort which are
absolutely and most sinfullie so, that never take any pains at all to be
prepared for death till it comes upon them; we may speak to stones in the wall
as well as to many of you who are such. A second sort, is of these who have
had some tenderness, but they are fallen slack, negligent, and out of a good
frame. A third sort is of such as want feiling and comfort and are without
clearness of their interest, and fear to die in that condition.

As for the first sort, we say to you, it is no wonder that ye slip away
securely, and fall into the pit of destruction that live senselesslie and
stupidlie till death come upon you, ye that never think of death till ye and it
meet, what can ye expect should be spoken to you for your comfort? always we
shall lay down some grounds to be made use of, even in such a deplorable and
desperat-like condition, when folk have quite neglected preparation for death
in their health, if such have but one hour to live, they would consider 1. That
repentance is then possibly attainable, they are within trysting terms with
God as long as they are in the land of the living and the sentence not past.
Secondly, That there is then no peace to be had with God, but in the same way
it is gotten now, that is by faith in Jesus Christ, which goes along with
repentance, and by folks betakeing themselves to a new way of living were it but
in a sincere resolution; Christ is the way the truth and the life, none can
come to the father but by him, and without faith there is no union with him,
and whoever look for eternal life, must have it through faith in him. Thirdly,
That though a person were to live but one hour, somewhat of these must be, some
faith, some repentance, some endeavored clearness of interest, some peace,
some holiness though it were but in the bud, so as to speak but a few words to
God, or to others standing by, as we may see in the theife on the cross, grace
wherever it comes were it but of one hours age or standing, is grace and has
the same virtual substantial fruits, or fruits in the bud, as I said, that
grace of older age and longer standing has. Yet fourthlie, where short time
is, there is need that there be some difference from what is ordinary in the
death of Christians of longer standing in the state of grace in pursueing of
these things; 1. In respect of time, to go the speedilier through them, that
is, to run (as it were) the more swiftly and speedily through repentance and
selfe-examination, fleeing to Christ, and the fruits of holiness; If time be
short these would be contracted, not that they would be slighted, but there
would be endeavoring to put them some way together, The Lord says, Matthew.
11. 12. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by
force; there must be a sort of violence even in health in this matter but more
at death, that is, if they get not all doubts answered they would know there
is ane absolute necessity to be at Christ, which must putt them to step over
these particular difficulties; as the preaching of the moral Law in John's time
forced people some way to step over the Ceremonies of the Law to Christ, so by
Analogy, persons who have been negligent in their life must use the same
violence at death, they must have sound repentance and faith, and by these
betake themselves to Christ speedily, and this speediness is, as I said, to
be understood in respect of time; these things fit and qualify for him and
would be made use of speedily to unit to him. 2. A difference would be in
respect of the measure, though repentance be in this case shorter, the
humiliation would be deeper, though the challenges be shorter, the pangs would
be so much the sorer, the person would be further down in selfe-loathing and
abhorring; regeneration and the new birth in such persons borne again so very
late, will readily be with greater pain and sharper pangs, with higher
indignation at sin and greater hatred at their own evil ways, then if they had
been sooner regenerated. 3. There would be a difference in respect of
eagerness and holy broudennesse, which would be beyond ordinary; it is never
good to delay repentance, faith, and holiness, but yet folks may come in to
Heaven with a somewhat flower pace (to say so) in health, then when they have
putt off and delayed these till sickness and death come on them, then they
would be in a special manner always restless till they be at a point, 4.
Having thus exercised faith and repentance, they would die resolving to be the
more in free graces commoun and debt, for if any of all Adams posterity be
oblidged to God, and bound to be the very humble slaves (if we may speak so)
of most soveraignlie free grace, most certainly these persons are most
singularly so, who have been rescued and snatched from death, hell, wrath, and
the Devil when he was even ready and about to lay presently* his hands on
them, and pull them to the pit with him: And now I say again, none that are
in such a condition, nor any of you all, have any the least ground of
encouradgment given from this doctrine, to putt off or delay faith, repentance,
and the study of holiness, let none therefore take any, least they be put to
smart for their folly eternally.

As for the second sort that have had more tenderness, but are backslidden and
fallen negligent and out of frame, they are to take the same way; when death
putts them in a flaught, as it were, and conscience with challenges stairs them
in the face, they would renew their repentance and faith in Christ, and the
fruits of holiness, the more speedily and eaggerly, they would be the more
humbled, flee the more hastily to their city of refuge, come with a more stopped
mouth before God, and acknowledge grace to be the freer, and allow it to have
the greater glory.

As for the third sort, who have kept up more tenderness, and who would
feign have their interest and peace clear, and to this day could never attain
to it, or if once they had it clear its grown somewhat dim and dark, and even
in a manner worn away again, they grow heartlesse when death comes and
surprises them; to such I would say. 1. That beleivers may die without sensible
comfort and die well, for as sensible comfort is not essentially necessary to
folks justification, so neither to their dieing in Christ; folks may die
sleeping, or in a distemper, or in a spiritual fear, and yet that fear have
faith and love in the bosom of it; and that condition which marrs not
Christians peace once made with God in their life, and is not so sinful, may
also be died in; they may be in the dark and yet die well. Secondly,
distinguish and put a difference betwixt the sense of the joy of the Spirit,
and that comfort and joy which a beleiver may have from Gods word of promise;
beleivers both living and dieing may want the one and have the other; though
they have not the flowings of the Spirit in sensible comfort and joy, yet they
may have solid peace and consolation, because they have Gods word of promise to
rest on, who have fled to him for their life, and their conscience has ane
inward testimony, that they have denied their own righteousness and betaken
them to his, and in this they have peace; else how could a beleiver possibly
lie down in any measure of true quietness under desertion, even for their
trial, it may be, more then for their sin? And if we look to David dieing
though we will not peremptourlie determine, yet it is like he had not much
comfort, for in these that are called his last words, 2 Samuel 23. 5. He betakes
him to Gods Covenant, though he did not so feill the fruits of it, and rests
there as at ane anchor; And therefore thirdly, they that are in this condition
would with the more confidence put themselves in over upon, and within the
compass of, the Covenant, and make their faith the sickerer because they want
sensible comfort; and readily it is and will be so with beleivers at that
time, for then they are most out of conceit with their own righteousness, and
in a holy fear and solicitude in themselves; for as he suffers some to be the
more untender in their life, and therefore makes them walk without sensible
comfort to keep down their van^ and pride, so may he exercise some at death.
Fourthlie, Let such so much the more trust God with their throwbearing, and
resolve to be the more in his debt, and they never took shiping thus in deaths
boat that had cause to fear to be drowned and cast away, He is the beleivers
God and guide not only to death but even throw death; He may go therefore
through the valey of the shadow of death and fear none evil Ps. 23. We come now
to add some further uses of the maine doctrine to these we made before.

And the first use is, seeing they are happy that di^ in the Lord, and
miserable that die out of him whatever their external condition be; 1. Lay the
less weight on the comforts of this life, and 2. be the less feared for the
afflictions of it O! Beleivers in Christ; There are, ye see, two parts of this
use, 1. (To begin with the last) If happiness be the portion of them that die
in the Lord, what needs Beleivers, who have clearness of Interest and well
grounded hope to die in the Lord, fear the afflictions or be much troubled with
the ups and downs of a present life? Though they meet with contempt, reproach,
poverty, disgrace, imprisonment, fineing, confineing, exile, many challenges
etc. These have ane end, death will put a period and close to them all; their
great happiness is not here, it is at the back of death; all your miseries
will be soon at ane end, and its a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory that is laid up for you; your time here away will not be long, it will
be but 30 or 40 years to some, 10 or 20 years to othersome, some more or fewer,
and it may be but one year to some of you, and then our blessed Lord Jesus will
come and wipe all tears from your eyes, and the comfortless rememberance of
these trials, troubles, and tosseings shall never enter into heaven with you;
its a shame that beleivers who have such a hope should be so heartlesse when
they meet with crosses, and walk so discouradgedly under them. Secondly, seeing
happiness follows after death, lay not much weight on the comforts of this
life, what comfort or satisfaction can ye have in them at death? And seeing
they can yield you no solid satisfaction then, are ye not far wide, and much
mistaken that bestow your travel and pains in seeking satisfaction among
creature comforts, and never labor to enter into his rest; needs there any
more be said to fright you from this foolish course but this, even to tell you
that ye leave and forsake the fountain of living waters, and betake yourselves
to the cisternes that can hold no water, and which will dreadfullie beguile and
disapoint you; what will riches, pleasures, grandour, honors, and great places
do to you at death? these make but a poor happiness and will soon have ane
end, and yet there is no lesson in the world that men and women learn less
then this; As all creatures say that wisdom is not in them, Job 28, So they
all cry with one voice that happiness is not in them; Its not in riches, for
they take to themselves wings and flee away; Its not in honor, for man that is
in honor and understands not, is like the beast that perishes, and he that
is high in court to day, may be hanged the morrow; neither is it in pleasures,
for the laughter of the fool is madness, and has grief and ^adnesse of heart
with it and even in the midst of it.

A 2d Use is, and it has other two branches, If happiness follow them that
die in the Lord; 1. It calls for a willingness as well as a readiness to die
when ever God calls you believers to it. 2. It serves to condemn a general
unwillingnesse to die, and possibly somewhat of it, even among the people of
God. 1. I say if happiness be in dieing in Christ, then they that are in the
way to it should be ready, willing, and cheerful to die. And 2. It must be ane
exceeding great distemper when folks dow not hear of death with patience, and
it argues strongly that either folk are out of the way, or not through and
clear as to their being in the way; Therefore reflect on your condition; what if
God should call any of you this night, are ye willing to die? I believe there
is not one amongst many that could heartily say it, there is scarce one among
many, but when death comes they would feign shift it, I speak not this to
condemn the use of lawful means in sickness for recovering health, but to
check our great loathnesse and unwillingnesse to die, which is such that we
would always suspend and putt it off; which speaks either; 1. Little faith of
this truth that they are happy who die in the Lord, otherwise it could not be
but if it were solidly believed, folk would be more willing to die and to be
with Christ, yea, there would be a desire to be there; if it were testified to
men by persons worthy of credit, that there were a good, pleasant, and fertile
land to be inhabited in such a place of the world, many would repair thither
for making a good fortune (as ye use to call it) in this life, And yet for all
Gods testimony (who cannot possibly lie nor deceave) of the happiness that
follows dieing in Christ, yet its not believed, and therefore few are willing
or desirous to go through death to enjoy it, very few are like Paul, who
desired to be dissolved and be with Christ which was best of all, weakness of
faith makes want of willingness to die. Or 2ly, it speaks out great want of
love to Jesus Christ, unwillingnesse to die is no little sin, but want of love
is greater, when folks prefer the being with Husband, or Wife, or Children,
or Friends, to being with Christ; O! love to Christ strangely loses the heart
from these, and makes the soul breath after being with him, as that which is
best of all; Or 3ly, It speaks much earthly mindedness, and addictednesse to
the things of a present world, hence it is that many carnal and earthly minded
wretches would never desire a better life, nor another life then their house
and bitt of land in quietness, the fellowship of their natural relations and
other external enjoyments.

For clearing of this use further, let us in a word touch on a question or two,
1. If all willingness or desire to die be good? 2ly, If a Christian may not
sometime be warrantablie unwilling to die.

For the first of these, to wit, If all willingness or desire to die be good?
To cleir it we would distinguish and put a difference betwixt these two, a
sinful and a commendable willingness.

First there is a sinful willingness or desire to die in folks carnal fitts,
and it is threefold, 1. A desperate willingness; when folks dow not abide some
present horror on their Spirits, or some pain of their bodies, or some other
very heavy and sharp cross, they will wish to be away, and some in such
fitts dispatch themselves by their own hands, so Judas dought not endure the
horror of his own conscience, and therefore hanged himself; but this is
rather ane unwillingnesse to submitt to, and bear their present lot and case,
then any willingness to die: the other two are incident to the Godly if not
only to them; The 2d willingness then is, when the Godly have many crosses
that they dow not well bear, and are affrayed that God be dishonored through
their fainting or other miscariages, or when they see it goeing ill with Gods
People and his public work, and they cannot do any thing to mend it; they
look upon themselves as useless and would feign be away, So Eljah 1 Kings 19.
prays, Lord take away my life, because they had slain his Prophets, dug
down his Altars and he only was left, as he apprehended, and they sought to
take away his life; but the Lord tells him that he was wrong, that he had yet
more to do with him, and that matters were not so ill as he trowed, for he had
reserved seven Thousand who had not bowed the knee to Baal; Thus some eminent
godly men in ane evil time, will readily wish to be away, they dow not endure
to be always fighting, striving, and contending to help and heal, especially
since they think they can do no good: And yet sometimes it is not so much the
case of the public, as fear of being straightened or disappointed in some one or
other particular of their own, that is the great ground of their fainting and
wishing to be gone, as we may see clearly in eminently godly and faithful
Baruch, Jer. 45. The 3d willingness to die is, when a dispensation or
affliction reflects ^ore on folks credit, whither they be preachers or more
private Professors; either some slip or miscariage in themselves, or some
affront put on them by others, which makes them think they will do no more
good (though it may be such a thing has come sinfullie from others), or it may
be from want of success in some work committed to them, or some disappointment
met with which they may desire to have removed, as we see in Jonah Cap. 3.
where he desires the Lord to take away his life, he conceaving himself as a
Prophet to be discredited, and he is so headstrong that when the Lord asks him,
does thou well to be angry Jonah? He answers pettishly, I do well to be
angry even unto the death; where God hints it to be his passion that
precipitated him, and by the gourd lets him see that it was his particular that
too much swayed him, and that he was not right in his desire of death, or in
his willingness to die.

For the 2d, The commendable willingness, I shall show you what it is by four
or five propperties that it has. 1. Right willingness to die is content to
die in prosperity, and is submissive to live in adversity; when all things
prosper with men, its a very rair thing to see them willing to die, though in
fitts of crosse-dispensations, they may seem to be willing; and to have a
submissive mind contented to live in adversity, yea, in the midest of greatest
troubles that are incumbent or imminent, is as rair: to be as Paul was, Philip.
1 23. content to abyd or go as God thinks meet, is a sweet temper and frame of
soul; to be willing to live shamed and reproached, and not to be discontented
with the down-lookings of honest folks, and to go through evil report as well
as good report, in all things laboring to keep a good conscience, and in
prosperity, as I said, to be content to leave the world and all that is in it*
when God calls by death, is a great matter. 2ly, right willingness has this
proppertie, that it flows not so much from a desire to be quyte of the
troubles of the world, as to enjoy Christ and the good which the soul hopes for
in and with him; it is not because either the persons own particular crosses
grow, or because confusions, distractions, and contentions in the public
increasse, that they covet to be out of that life and to be gone, but because
they long to be with Jesus Christ, We (says the Apostle 2. Cor. 5. v. 4.)
that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened, and what is the ground?
not that we would be uncloathed but clothed upon; not so much to get the
infirmities of the body laid down, as to have the glory promised; it is that
which swayes mainly in the right desire of death or willingness to die. 3.
Right willingness to die has much desire and endeavor after communion with
Christ here, and if it cannot come soon eneugh (so to speak) to full,
immediate, and never to be interrupted communion with him in the next life, it
seeks to make it up by pressing much after the nearest communion with him in
this life; It is ane evil token when folk are desyreous to die and to be away,
and yet are found neglecting communion with Christ while they are living; these
that are rightly willing to die will be much in desire and longing after
fellowship with Christ, and much in the delightful contemplation of Heaven ere
it come and in their practice tending thitherward, and very loath to do any
thing that may obstruct that so much desired fellowship; This we may see in
David, in the old Testament, and in Paul in the New, O! how do they pray and
pant after, and O! what pains are they at to keep communion with God? and how
do they labor alonge all their conversation so to behave, that no obstruction
from them may be laid in the way of their so much longed*for fellowship with
him; let none then think that it can be a right willingness to die, that putts
not men to be tender in the study of holiness, and of conformity to Christ
in their life; Therefore it is said of Simeon, who was so willing to die, that
he was a just and devot man, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and by him
and other such godly persons in his time, was the Temple frequented night and
day. 4ly, That is right willingness to die that is not by fitts, but
continueing and distinct and goes upon solid grounds, I speak not of sensible
comfort but of the grounds of faith, of some clearness of interest, and of
sweet submission to Gods blessed will; for though none needs to wonder much of
Simeons willingness to die when he has gotten Christ in his arms, yet it
has this sweet submission to God in it.

The 2d Question is, if even beleivers may be unwilling to die? And if this be
warrantable? I answer, They may be sometimes unwilling to die and that not
unwarrantably; And for clearing of this we shall speak to two things. 1. To ane
unwillingnesse to die upon carnal grounds; 2. To ane unwillingnesse to die upon
good grounds; For the first, Beleivers may be unwilling to die from a sinful
unpreparednesse to die, they may have a loathnesse to look death in the face
throw the conscience of some, yea much carnalnesse in their life; beside that
there is in all naturally ane averseness from dieing, beleivers may have
sometimes their own carnal designs that may make them unwilling, but this is
sinful; for where there is a good conscience sprinkled with Christ's blood,
solid faith, and clearness about our peace with God, in so far they will make
willingness to die. But 2ly, There is ane approven unwillingnesse that
sometimes has been in the Saints, as in David and Hezekiah, which is rather
asweet submission to live, then a direct desire to live, for other reasons, for
if it be a fear about the want of temporal or spiritual things for soul or
body, or about any thing that relates to Gods public work, faith will answer
these; but there are two reasons that the Saints have gone on, by which they
have been induced to this, that made them approven in their unwillingnesse to
die. 1. The great stroke and influence that their removeal might have had on
the work of God, as it was in Hezekiah, Iosia and Paul, their case; if the
former two should have been removed, it would very probably have overturned
the Work of God, as Paul's removal would have made many sore hearts amongst
Christians. 2ly, When their dieing in such a case, or under such a dispensation
seems to carry some blot with it on innocent godly persons, or on godliness
and the profession of it; As if Job should have died in his affliction, it
would have confirmed his Friends in their erronneous opinion or tenet; and
David's dieing in the hands of his enemies before he came to the crown, would
have left some blemish on the faithfulness of God, and on the profession of
Religion, and been matter of shame and blushing to the godly; Therefore says
he, For their sakes return thou on high; And so that unwillingnesse to die
that flows not from respect to a man's self, but from respect to the public
work of God, to his glory and others good or either of them, is warrantable.

A 3d Use is, which has also two branches, 1. Learn from this Doctrine to try
and Judge what true blessedness is, it is even to die in the Lord. 2. Learn
to cast at that as ane unhappie thing, which conduces not to this end of
dieing in the Lord. First I say, if ye would try your own hearts, when they are
in a spiritual frame, take this as a mark of it, if ye do really account this
to be bessednesse; if ye were to hear a voice from Heaven, declareing who is the
blessed man, and if ye had the Spirits Testimony sealling it, here he is,
blessed is he that dies in the Lord; Its not they that conquer, and overturne,
and transferr Kingdoms, that obtain many victories, and have great success
in their atcheivments and undertakeings, that are blessed; Its not to be a
Protector, or sole Governor of Nations, that makes a man blessed, but this is
it, to die in the Lord; this is the language of Heaven and that which is laid
weight on there, and so should be by you. And 2ly, Lay all the things ye can
Imagine in this world in the balance with this, they cannot possibly weigh
equally with it, let be down weigh it and what follows it; when they are all
laid in the balance with dieing in the Lord, and with the consequent glory
and happiness, they are light as a feather, yea lighter then vanity utterly
unworthy to be named in a day with these; As there is therefore no happiness
in them so cease to seek it in or from them.

A 4th Use is, and its of other two branches, If there be a necessity of dieing
and dieing in the Lord to them that would be happy; There is nothing so
forcible to press the study of holiness. 2. Nothing so forcible to scarr
from prophanity, which are the great scope of all preaching: I say consider
this doctrine rightly and it will be found, 1, To be most powerfully provocking
to holiness, the reason is, because dieing well, and living well are knitt
together, and nothing can more demonstrat the absolute necessity of holiness,
without which none shall see the Lord; its as necessary as peace with God and
Heaven, and who ever they be who think not so now, when ever they shall be
summoned to remove, they shall without all peradventure find it to be so. 2ly,
Is there any thing more scarring at, and deterring from, profanity and a carnal
walk? Gather all that the world can afford whither of sinful pleasures, or of
lawful temporal delyts immoderatly often used, and suppose that ye could come
by your very hearts desire and wish in them, what will they all advantage you
when death comes? to have so many thousands or hundred thousands of merks, to
have so much land or so many houses, will do you no good at death; what will
it advantage you to spend your time in pleasure, in the lusts of the flesh, in
tippling and drunkenness? And ye that are swelled with pride and ambition, and
would have all others backing you, and beckning and bowing to you, what, I say,
will these profit you when death shall put ane end to them all, and make ane
eternal divorce betwixt you and them, and when ye must lie down amongst the
dead, and when the worms must be a covering to you? Its even a wonder (if
ought of this kind could be a wonder to our carnal and profaine hearts)
considering the necessity of dieing and of dieing in the Lord to all that would
die well and happily, with the faith and conviction that we generally profess
to have of them, that we think so little seriously of death, and of such a
death, and are at so little pains in the study of holiness to prepare for it.

I shall therefore in the last place speak a word or two to several sorts of
persons, who should be thinking upon, and prepareing for death, but put it far
away from them: 1. To them that are young and take a merry life of it, and dow
abide nothing but to be carnally Jovial, ah! poor wantouns, is not death fast
approaching? Will it not be upon you ere ye be aware, and ere many years go
by? Certainly your life will not be eternal, and who knows but your time may
be shorter then ye dream of? The grave may be as soon filled with you that
are younger, healthfuller, and stronger, as with the more aged, sick, and
infirm, what reason then have ye to be so mirry and jovial, when your peace is
not made sure with God? Its a most remarkable and alarming word that is spoken
to you by the Spirit of God, Eccles. 11. 9. Rejoice O young man in thy youth,
and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways
of thy heart, in the sight of thine eyes; but know that for all these things
God will bring thee into Judgment: Ye may go on, if you will at your perril,
slighting all warneings and admonitions, but be assured Death and Judgment are
quickly coming when ye will be called to reckon with God, not only for every
open, but for every secret thing good or evil; Therefore be exhorted to review
and to cast your eye along your youth, and to consider seriously how it has
been spent, and see if there be not reason for your taking the exhortation
that follows, Remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth etc. Eccles.
12. 1. and to spend some more time in thinking of, and prepareing for death;
2ly, To them that are exceeding wise in their own generation, very provident
for Summer and Winter, and for all seasons of the Year, and who can manage
their estates very well and put all things in good order for themselves and for
their children, to make them a convenient life in the world, but do not at all
in good earnest mind ane other life, how many such are there, that are very
wise for this life, but for the matters of God and their own souls are stark
fools the veriest fools in the world? Many like Martha (who though a good woman
was nevertheless much prevailed over by this distemper, albeit it did not
reign in her nor obtain dominion over her, as it does over unregenerat
persons) are careful, cumbred, and troubled about many things, and neglect the
one thing that is needful; Is it not a wonder that such very rational and wise
men should wast all their precious time, except what they spend in eating,
drinking and sleeping, upon the things of a present life, and not allow so much
as one hour of all the week to think seriously on their souls and of death? I
appeal to your own consciences if this be reasonable and a practice worthy of
rational men having immortal souls capable of eternal happiness and misery?
And if your time be not spent on these things which are but vanity, and which
at death will do you no good nor profit you, and concerning which you will
then be made to cry, What profit have we of these things whereof we are now
ashamed? 3ly, To such as are frequent in their attendance on public
ordinances, and in the use of other commanded means, and yet never thought nor
believed their souls to be in hazard, nor in good earnest prepared themselves
for dieing; O! think yet upon your hazard, for that is the first spring of
making ready for the remedy, O! seek grace to examine yourselves, to believe
in Christ, to repent, and to live as it becomes them that profess themselves
to be dieing persons; Its really both strange and wonderful how it comes to
pass that ye can so often hear and yet give no obedience to what ye hear, do
ye or can ye think that it is religion enough to hear? Has not the Scripture
said, James 1. That it is not the hearer, but the doer of the word that is
blessed in his deed or doing? I beseech you therefore be ye doers of the word,
and not hearers only deceaving your own souls, or (as the word is) deludeing
and playing the Sophist with your own souls. 4ly, To them that have greater
parts and abilities, and higher places and power then others, and have withal
more opportunities to be prepareing for death; who are masters of families and
can command their children and servants to read the Scripture, to fast and
pray, and seek God; and who know from the word what is right and what is wrong,
what is duty and what is sin* and yet are so very little in the practice of
these directions in order to their preparation for death; Consider I entreat
you what your knowledge, parts, places, and power, will do to you or advantage
you when ye are dieing, if there be not faith and love, and the fruits of both
in practice; Its really a wonder that so many men should have light in, and
conviction of, these things, and yet should so dally with their light and
conviction and not endeavor to make them practicable. 5ly, To them that are
aged and have their one foot as it were in the grave, who are neir fifty or
sixty, or a very few more years which not many exceeds, and yet are, even when
so far on in years, as secure and negligent in preparing for death as if it were
ane hundredth years from them; consider what ye are doing, age (alace) and
years do not necessarly bring along with them more tenderness in
soul-concernes, for we see it in experience oftentimes, that the more aged men
are, the more stocked are they in ignorance and senselessness; certainly if
this word speak to any, it speaks to you that should in a manner carry your
deaths-cloaths about with you, and be examplary to others in prepareing for
death; ye would therefore take it to you. A 6th and the last sort we shall
speak to, are these that are in a poor mean and low condition in the world, for
all are not rich and wealthy nor have a plentiful outward condition, many can
scarcely get their families maintained, and yet even but few of such (which is
a wonder) are seriously seeking after Heaven, and prepareing for dieing in the
Lord that leads to it; the rich have a tentation that ye want; If any in the
world should seek after Heaven it should be you who are poor, and yet how many
of you will be miserable, not only here but also eternally hereafter ere ye
betake yourselves to the way of holiness? If ye were wise, as ye ought to be,
ye would bless God that ever this Gospel came among you and was preached to
the poor, which has happiness and everlasting riches in the bosom of it to
all that will embrace it: O! take this word to you poor and rich, ye will all
most certainly lie down in the grave, but this will make the difference, ye
will die happy or accursed, as ye die in Christ or out of him. Finally, I must
say this word to them that have some acquaintance with God, and some conviction
of the fecklessnesse and great deficience of their endeavors in prepareing for
death, for their both humbleing and further upstirring to diligence, that there
is amongst us both little rouseing of ourselves, little hastening to the comeing
of the day of God, little goeing out to meet' the bridegroom; Alace! We will,
to speak so, take both a putt and a call to make us advance toward death,
though we be drawing neirer to it daily, yet few of us, as I just now said, are
waiting for, and hastening unto the comeing of Christ and of the day of God.

I shall close up all with this one word, it may be that many of us shall teast
of death before we hear so much spoken of it; take it therefore as ane
advertisement and call from Heaven to mind more that which is so much
forgotten, and yet so necessary to be always remembered, even to live so as we
may die in the Lord Christ, and so be eternally and unspeakably blessed.

SERMON VI.
Revel. 14: 13. Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, etc.
ALthough we have already spoken at greater length on these words then at first
we intended, yet somewhat remains that is useful, and which seems to be their
maine scope; therefore we shall insist a little further. The way that we gather
what we are to say is by considering the Spirits purpose and design in this
place, which comes in very remarkably, having no particular dependence (as
would seem) on the former words, nor connection with what follows; what can be
the reasone that betwixt the denunciation of Judgment before, and the
Prophecies of Judgment that follow, there is such ane interruption and breaking
off from the series of the History made? I heard a voice saying to me, write,
blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea says the
Spirit etc. there must sure be some reason; We shall offer these two reasons
that point especially at the scope of the Spirit of God and are insinuated in
the words, that will be the grounds of two doctrines; The (...) reason is, That
the Lord when he is speaking of sad things to come upon his Church, and and of
Judgments to come upon the enemies thereof, casts in this as a ground of
profitable meditation to his people at such a time, so that whither we look to
Judgments to come on enemies, or to trials and tentations his own people are to
meet with, this is cast in seasonably as a practical lessone plain in itself,
and profitable to them. A 2d reason is, that God by such a word, when death
should be frequent and trouble and confusion should grow, may comfort and
encourage his people, that death may not be bitter nor terrible to them since
the Lord putts this motto, to say so, on men's dieing in him in the darkest and
sadest times, that they are blessed.

These two being the scope, the one to prepare them for dieing, and the other
to comfort them against dieing, they yield us these two useful points of
doctrine, the first whereof we shall speak to at this time, which is this.

Doct. 1, That death and the happiness of them that die in the Lord, is a
suitable and profitable subject of the meditation of Gods people, especially in
times of difficulty and trouble; This we conceive is clearly employed in the
words, certainly the Spirit that is so wise, and who most opportunely timeth
and trysteth things for the good of his people, would not so abruptly have
brocken in on this purpose at this time, if it were not very pertinent and
suitable to such a time; there is not in all this book such a remarkable
diversion from the series of the History, having such a word prefixed to it,
and such a word affixed and subjoyned to it as this; no doubt to stir up Gods
people that have this book to read, when they come to this memorable passage,
to think and consider of it the m^re seriously: To clear the doctrine more
generally a little, we will find that these who have been most holy, have been
most frequent in the thoughts and meditation of death, so David prays, Psalm.
39. Lord make me to know mine end, and the number of my days, that I may know
how frail I am; and Moses, So teach us to number our days, that we may apply
our hearts to wisdom, Ps. 90. (the numbering of our days, is this, serious
thinking and meditating on approaching death) We may here also look on the
example of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, Luke. 9. 31. who speaks at his
transfiguration on the mount with Moses and Elias of his deceasse* which he was
to accomplish at Jerusalem; for though there was something peculiar in his
death, yet his speaking of it, and prepareing for it, belongs as a common
duty to us, and should be a pattern to us; And O! how does Solomon commend
the meditating on death, Eccles. 7: v. 2. and 11: 8, 9. and Chap. 12.
throughout.

But for further and more particular clearing of this doctrine, we shall speak
a little to these three contained in it; 1. What is meant, when we say that
death is a suitable subject of meditation? 2. What profit or advantage comes
to the people of God by it? 3. Why do we say it is especially profitable and
advantageous to be thought upon in ane evil time?

For the first, when we speak of death as a suitable subject of meditation, It
is not to be strictly taken as contradistinguished from other things that
preceed, accompany, and follow death; But 1. we take in the thoughts of the
certainty of dieing, and the uncertainty of its time and other circumstances
as to us; Its then to think on death as the way of all flesh, as that which no
man can get a discharge from, and of the uncertainty of the time and manner of
it, how sudden and surpri^ing it may be. 2ly, When we speak of the meditation
of death, we take in all that accompanies it, the pain and outward deseases
whereby men are made unable to do any profitable work in their generation, as
also all the challenges, convictions, tentations, terrors, and anxieties that
accompany death, and the estimation of things that we see dieing men to have;
All these would be taken in as a part of this meditation. 3ly, When we speak of
meditating on death, we mean not that it would be meditated on, only as it is a
natural thing after the fall of man, but would consider and distinguish it in
its several kinds as its dieing in sin and dieing in the Lord, the first and
second death; we would look upon death on the one side, as ane effect of the
curse, and on the other side, as sweetened with Gods love and as ane entry into
happiness: And we would add to this the causes of the one and of the other,
what it is that makes death miserable to one, and happy or the entry to
happiness to another. 4ly, When we speak of thinking on death we would take in
the effects and consequents of death, our appearing before God, Judgment, and
Eternity, that are at the back of death; The entering into an unchangeable
estate of well or ill being, meeting with a sentence that is irrevocable, the
eternal happiness of them that die in Christ, the eternal misery of them that
die in sin, perfection of Joy, and extremity of sorrow for ever, which men and
Angels are not able to conceave and farlesse to express; And when we speak of
meditation on death, we say its a suitable subject to be thinking often and
frequently on all their, not only at more solemn and set times, but even in
the midst of our callings and employments, in the midst of our Joy, and of our
grief and sadness, to be taking some serious looks of this day that will
put ane end to all these in the way before spoken of; in your youth (...) be
considering that this day of darkness is comei^g, and in old age especially,
when the shadow of death sitts down on the eye lids and the strong men begin
to bow themselves etc.

As to the second, To commend this duty to you all consider what advantage
flows from it, though we spoke of meditation in general at another occasion,
and hinted some what at meditation on death, yet it being so frequently spoken
of in Scripture and so profitable to beleivers, we shall speak a little to some
advantages that will commend the expedience of the duty, as well as the
necessity of it to you; And 1, Much of the improvement of the great truths we
have been speaking of to you these days past, depends on your meditation on
death, and these things that go before, accompany, and follow after it; its
impossible to know a right, and to believe how great a task and work it is to
die well, and what is the happiness of them that die so, if we be not taking
pains to be cleared and confirmed in it by Scripture and by meditating on it;
folks take but a glance at it in the by, but stay not to look on the quarrel
and controversy that is betwixt God and them, neither do they consider
seriously what is at the back of death, and therefore it surpriseth them when
it comes; whereas that man can speak of death boldly and advisedly that has
been acquainting himself with it before hand. 2ly, There is nothing that
readily does more heighten the estimation of God and of Christ then the
thoughts of death, the thoughts of it brings folks closser and nearer to his
bar, and make them look on him as Judge, they put them to consider their
fecklenesse, baseness, and vileness upon the one hand, and the greatness of
the Majesty of God upon the other; O! how sublimely do David and Job speak of
God? when in the one word they talk of the grave, and of the cover of worms
there, and in the other word, highly exalt the Majesty and greatness of God;
Meditation on death brings the thoughts of what God is, and of what we are,
very near us, and represents to us before hand what he will be found to be at
and after death, and what we will be then; whereas on* the contrary, it is
given as a root of our despising God, when men put the evil day far away, as no
doubt a root of reverence and respect to God, is serious meditation on death.
3ly, More particularly, look to beleivers converseing with others that have
grace, or that abound in corruption, we will find it exceeding needful, useful,
and advantageous to carry along the thoughts of death; It would make Christians
walk loveingly and edifieingly with others, loather to do wrong, more patient
when they suffered wrongs, and more easy to forgive, and more ready to forget
wrongs; our carnal humors would not get such way, if the thoughts of dieing
were suteably entertained; and half an hours discourse together with the
impression of it on us, through Gods blessing, would edify and profit us
mutually, more then many days meeting without it could do. 4ly, In reference
to a man's self: 1. More generally, meditation on death is a most quieting and
Spirit-sobering thing, it stays the mind, it diverts from vanities, and
removes them from being the object of his persute, nay it someway crucifies him
to them; And hence it is that men are seldom or never in a more sob^r and in a
better frame, then when they are seriously apprehensive of death, as suppose
men to be in sickness, or in danger at Sea or on Land, they will readily be in
another frame then ordinarily they use to be in, and when the danger or strait
is by, that impression wears readily much away; but were we more in meditation
of death, this frame might be more constant and lasting. 2ly, More particularly
1. It contributs, through Gods blessing, to rectify a man's Judgment that by
orriginal sin is darkened, and accounts ill good and good ill, the thoughts
of death make a man wise, discreet, and condescending; men while they are in
health and without these thoughts, will not quite ane inch of their will, they
will rather wound their conscience then their credit; and to get their barnes
full and all goeing well with them in the world, wholly takes them up, but the
serious thoughts of death makes them wise to discern and judge of things,
therefore Moses joines these two together, thinking on death and the applying
of the heart to wisdom, Psalm. 90. when folks think not on death, they are
cumbered with many things, they r^ne to cisternes and turn their back on the
fountain; whereas serious pondering on death, lets the vanity and emptiness
of these things be seen; how many see we daily when dieing, counting little of
these things they thought much of before, and calling and accounting themselves
fools that suffered themselves to be so carried away with them; and however Gods
Spirit calls them fools that make such a choice. 2ly, As it inlighteneth the
Judgment, so it orders the affectiones and rules the passions, therefore when
Solomon is speaking to the young man who will be tied with no bands, he
Ironically bids him rejoice and laugh on, but withal wills him to remember
that for all these things he will come to Judgment, the meditation of Death and
Judgment would say of laughter thou art mad, and of mirth what do thou? It
would make men look on them as vanity, folly, and madness; and these thoughts
especially would become folks in prosperity, and in their youth when their
humors are more high bended and light; meditation on death is a notable bridle
to lightness. 3ly, If we will yet look more particularly forward, Its
exceeding profitable to advance mortification, to bring us out of the
entanglements of a world, and to help us with singleness and denyednesse in
following Christ, thou fool, (says death) this night thy soul may be taken
from thee, and whose shall all these things be? It makes men's carrouseing and
good fellowship (as they call it) teastlesse; conscience would in that case
speak and say, what if thou die drunken or with the cup in thy hand? this
meditation makes a man care little for the world, riches, pleasures, and honor;
it would make all to grow very unsavory, in a word, it mortifies these three
which are the worlds trinity, pride, covetousness, carnal lusts. 1. It
mortifies pride, as we may see in David, who says, Psalm. 39. Lord teach me to
know my end and the measure of my days, that I may know how fraill I am. And
in Job, who says to corruption, it is his mother, and to the worms, they are
his Sisters; It puts to say, dust I am and into dust I shall return. 2. It
mortifies covetousness, for the meditation of death wrings the heart from the
things of the world, and gives the man other thoughts to think upon; how many
when death approaches are forced to say, they have cumbered themselves with the
world and it hes beguiled them. 3. It mortifies carnal pleasures, for what can
vain fleshly lusts do to men that are dieing? For as merry as they are now,
say these thoughts, they must appear within a little before God in Judgment, and
if this be not a bridle to these lusts, I know not what will be a bridle. 4. It
stirrs up to the diligent exercise of all duties, and to the goeing about them
soberly and seriously, one preaching or prayer after serious meditation on
death would have more weight, and be waited with more advantage, then many
others without it; It puts to humiliation, selfeexamination, selfe-searching;
it furthers the exercise of the fear of God, and brings the soul to stand in aw
of him before whom it is to appear shortly: It furthers repentance and prayer,
Job 41: 25. Because of breakings they purify themselves; they make themselves
for death by repentance, prayer, and the offering of sacrifices even these
Heathens in the Ship with Jonah; And if meditation on death put profaine men to
the form of Religion, how much more will it put beleivers to be serious and
spiritual, in the exercise of these duties and in the practice of Religion? And
if God give them time and seriousness at dieing, their prayers will be more
feckful and fervent at that time then before. 5. It is exceeding profitable to
work kindly submission to crosse-dispensations, and to make folks go softly
under them; what will a man care, (carkeingly I mean) that is taken up with
meditating on death, for the fore faulture of his estate or to have his house
brunt, or his land wasted? He knows death will put ane end to all these things.
6. As it fitts for all duties and restraines from all vices, so it exceedingly
prepares for death itself which is the great scope; Solomon describes
sickness and old age, Eccl. 12. to make the young man ready for death ere it
come, and if there were no other advantage by meditation on death, this is no
small one, not to be surprised with it: Yea, it some way also mitigats the
bitterness of death, so that its not so terrible to them that have been
thinking on it seriously, as it is to others who have never made it the subject
of their meditation? And what wonder is it to see many either mightily
terrified or very stupid at death, since they never studied the lesson of
dieing before it came on them?

But as to the 3d, Why add we this, that it is especially advantageous in evil
times? Which seems to be the very scope of the words, and the godly such as
David and others have thought it so; we do not say that meditation on death is
especially profitable and advantageous in ill times, as if it were not to be
thought on in times of prosperity and peace, but that it is exceeding
necessary, and singularly profitable in ane evil time, and in such ane one as
we now live in; And the great necessity and advantage of this arises from
three things that accompany ane evil time; 1. Many snairs and tentations; in
ane ill time flesh and blood is ready to postpone a good conscience and to
prefer self preservation; now living in the meditation of death guards
against that; if the tentation say, man spare or save thyselse, the soul that
is thinking on death will say, I may soon loss my good conscience by yiedling
to such a thing for preservation of self, and yet it may be myself shall not
live a year after it, and though I should live twenty yet shall I be brought
to com^t for it, And therefore I will rather hazard on the loss of any thing,
yea of life itself, then by wounding or ship-wracking my conscience on
provocking God; Hence the Apostle tells us, 2 Cor. 5. that he was not swayed
with outward things. 2. Another evil accompanies ane evil time, and its carnal
sorrow, fainting, perplexity, discouradgment; meditation on death mitigats
these, It says that these things, or any other thing the Godly can suffer, are
not eternal, It sweetneth our grief, it diverts the mind from carnal thoughts
to that which is more profitable, it eases the mind, and lays the ^lormes,
and calmeth the confusions, that outward difficulties and troubles raise and
awake in it, and gives a profitable use of sad things. 3ly, There is in ane
evil time ordinarily, much confusion and distraction; that is down which we
think should be up, and that is up which we think should be down, and our
minds are ready to stagger and reill to and fro like a drunken man, because of
these confusions; but the thoughts of death stay the mind, and say, that death
er long will bring all these things to ane end or else ane end to us, and will
bring them all to be recognosced and judged over again; To this purpose
compare, v. 16, and 17. of Eccles. 3. where Solomon says, I saw the place of
Judgment that wickedness was there, and the place of righteousness that
iniquity was there; And what does comfort him against this? I said in my
heart, God will Judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time there
for every purpose and for every work; oftentimes there is not a seasone for
things here, but at death there is a season for every thing, all sentences that
have been wrongously past here will be reduced there, the consideration of this
stays his heart and comforts him.

The Uses are two, The 1st is by way of exhortation, to commend this excellent
though much slighted duty, not only meditation in the general, but meditation
in particular on this subject of death; folks have often as little mind of this
duty as if it were not in the word of God, and yet it is frequently called for
there, and if in any generation, then in this, wherein there is so much
confusion, turneing of things up side down, and reilling to and fro; so many
snairs and so many grounds of grief and sorrow; when so many are carnally
weighted and dejected, and so many are declineing and goeing wrong: And (as we
show before) we think that this text relats to this time of the World, the time
of Gods beginning to execute his Judgments on Antichrist before the full
harvest and vintage come; and therefore we would speak to this use a little more
particularly, because its very useful and a notable mean to make you go
profitably about the practice of all that we have spoken to this purpose; for
it puts us in mind of these directions for right living in order to dieing, and
it holds us at them; without the minding of death, there can be no minding of
them, for these that mind not the end can never mind the midses; because, I
say, its thus useful, We shall therefore for further clearing of it speak a
little to two things; 1. To some directions or rules, showing how ye should
think on death. 2. To some helps and means thereto.

For the first, ye remember when we said death was a suitable subject of
meditation, we took in death in its circumstances, concomitants, and kinds; And
our first direction or rule shall be this, be particular in your meditation,
let it not be abstracted from yourselfe in particular, Its not enough to take
it for granted that death is common to all; So does Job, cap. 30. 23. I I know
that thou shall bring me to death, and so does David, Ps. 39. Lord teach me to
know mine end and the number of my days, how frail I am; go through all the
concomitants of death, and consider what may be your case at death, what will
be your challenges, tentations, and thoughts; and what will be the effects and
consequents of death to you, when ye must with these same eyes and none other
for you behold and face your Judge. 2ly, Cast a reflexe look on yourselves and
your own way in meditation, when ye look to that way that prepares one to die
well, look back and see if such a preparation be in you, consider how your way
suits with that which the Scripture holds out to be the way, if such a
challenge may meet you at death, and what course is taken with it to answer or
prevent it; this was Jobs way Chap. 31. where he tells us that he durst not
slight the cause of his manservant or maidservant when they contended with
him, for then he should not have had a good answer to his judge, and that if he
had done otherwise, it would have marred his boldness. 3ly, Labor to have
your affections moved in your meditation on death; This is a chief end of
meditation; otherwise we will but run to and fro, and roave up and down to
inform the Judgment, and carry the thoughts of death as a common place along
with us, but will get no more good of it; the special thing is to have
somewhat dropeing from it that may melt the heart, as it was with David, Psalm.
77. I thought on God and was troubled; and Psalm. 63. My soul shall be filled as
with marrow and fattnesse; there is something like this in meditating on death,
it affects the heart with terror, when the soul thinks on dieing without
clearness of interest; It affects the heart with comfort and joy, when the
soul is clear in its interest; to think on dieing in Christ so as thereby to be
advanced a step nearer unto it, and to drink in what we have been thinking
upon, that is the truly profitable thinking on such a thing; the meditation
that is without affecting of the heart, is like the chewing of meat that is
presently spitt out again and not swallowed down and digested; or to the
looking only on what is profitable without making any further use of it: Such,
I say, is all our preaching, hearing, speaking, and thinking of death, when
they do not affect the heart. 4ly, Study to be practical in your meditation,
that is, to have it tending to some profitable use in your practice as its end;
when ye have found out such a thing to be wrong, presently to set about the
amending of it; when ye have found out some thing spiritually profitable,
resolutly to go about it and all the means to attain it. 5ly and lastly,
Seek to be much in prayer to God, and in dependence on him for direction in
this particular, go about meditation on death as a duty commanded by God, with
prayer to him and with dependence on him for his assistance and his blessing on
it, many look not on the meditation of death in particular as a peculiar duty,
and therefore its so much slighted: When we commend it to you as a duty, we mean
these three things; 1. That ye should look upon it as required of God, and as
being useful and profitable as well as any other duty: 2ly, That ye should go
about it as in his presence, ordinarily folk take a greater latitude in
meditation then in prayer, but ye would remember and consider that he is
witness to your meditation as well as to your prayers, that he is the great
subject of it, that it is laid on by his command, that su^eable meditation is
and must be wrought by his Spirit, and that ye will and must count to him for
your wand^ings in it, as well as in prayer. 3ly, That ye should take in all, at
least, the general circumstances of it pointed at before, that ye should take
time to it, and betake yourselves to it of set purpose, and even now and then
when possibly ye might have some other thing to do that is not necessary for
the time; and that ye should by prayer seek Gods guiding in this particular
duty as well as in any other duty, as Moses does Psalm. 90. Teach us to number
our days: Be not frighted from it by the apprehended difficulty of it, for as
meditation in the general is hard and difficult, so is the particular
meditation of death even a subject that we are naturally very averse from,
therefore David Prays, Psalm. 39. Lord teach me to know mine end, etc. and
indeed, more frequent and habitual exercise and practice of it, would, through
Gods blessing, make it more easy.

For the 2d, Because there is difficulty in this duty as we have just now
hinted, we shall therefore propose or point at a few things that may be helps
to it; There is nothing we have more motives to, nor more memorandums of to say
so) then of this, take then these helps. 1. Consider seriously the frequent
deaths and burials among you every day, whereof ye are witnesses and at which
ye are present, and possibly of several younger, healthier, and stronger then
yourselves, and of whom it might have been thought not many days since, they
would have outlived you: And then reflect upon yourselves and see if ye be
prepared for death, when ye are in your houses, or goeing in the streets, and
hear the bell giving notice of the death of such and such persons, or see the
corpses carried forth to their burial place, think on these things, for they are
helpful: Therefore Solomon says, Better is the day of death then of ones
birth, and he gives the reason, for the living will lay it to heart, that is,
the living should lay it to heart. 2ly, Look unto, and consider well, your own
infirmities, sicknesses, and diseases of one kind or another: There are none
but they have the seed of fewer or of more diseases in them, besides fitts of
sickness that befall them now and then, and what is the language of all these
but this? Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return: When folks have in
their bodies the beginnings of rottenness or of a gangerine, they will spread;
ye would hear all these infirmities, diseases, and distempers crying aloud upon
you that ye will and must die, for these cry to you every day as that man was
cried unto by one whom he appointed to cry at his door every morneing, thou
art mortal. 3ly, Consider the extraordinary events that befall many men and
women, some are suddenly stricken down with palfies, some fall down and never
rise, some go abroad and never return, some are stricken with fury and
madness; and are any of us exempted from these or any of them? 4ly, We commend
to you frequent reading of, and meditating on, these Scriptures that speak of
death, and of other books that treat of that subject, and set forth most
lively the shortness of man's life; be often reading of the death of the
Saints, many are rather taken up with reading vain Romances or Stories, that
are unprofitable in comparison of this; and others are, it may be, taken up
with mysterious, dark, doubtful, and little edifieing questions and debats. 5ly,
We commend to you to think seriously upon the names that death getts in
Scripture, and the comparisons whereby it is there holden forth, for there are
not many things that we can readily mention or meet with, which may not serve
to put us in mind of dieing; do men put off their clothes? Death is compared
to that, 2 Cor. 5. do we lie down in our beds to take rest? Death is also
compared to that Isay 57. verse. 2. where the Prophet speaking of the righteous,
says. He shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their beds: So to the
same purpose death is compared to a sleep, one generation goes and another
comes and every one sleeps their sleep Psalm. 76. v. 5. would ye but reflect
when ye are goeing to bed and consider what postour ye are lyeing down in, and
from this bethink yourselves what is out of order, and how ye may be suteably
affected with it, and raise up in the morneing with a resolution to practice
accordingly, it were a profitable meditation; death is also called, the way of
all flesh, and can we reckon our age or number our years, but it must at least
should put us in mind of death that is fast comeing? Yea, can we so much as
breath (which is one of the most ordinary things) but it must or at least might
put us in mind of death? Thou take away their breath, they die and return to
their dust, says the Psalmist, Psalm. 104. 29. If there were but a stop put to
this continual breathing of ours, then our life should be quickly found to be
but as a vapor that goes up and returns not again, that appears but for a
little time and then vanishes away, as James says, cap. 4. 14. So that we want
not sufficient occasions to putt us and keep us in mind of death; but alace! We
want heart and affection to the thing, and spiritual-mindednesse to make use of
these occasiones; Always we leave it on you not only as a duty, but as a very
profitable duty, to meditate more on death and to make use of these and the
like means to help you to it, and the Lord himself bless them to you.

A 2d Use is for reproof and conviction, and O! what ground of reproof and
challenge does it bring along with it? Were this the very time of our goeing to
die, and of our appearance before our judge, how many of us can say, we have
made conscience of thinking on our last end? So that the Lord may expostulat
with us, as he did with his people of old, Deuteronomy. 32. as with a foolish people
and unwise, O! that they were wise, O! that they understood this, that they
would consider their latter end; many may sadly say, that they scarcely ever
reckoned it among their duties, nor the neglect of it among their sins and
grounds of challenge, and we fear, which is yet worse and more sad, that it may
be said of many, that they do not resolve to rank and place it amongst their
duties? But if ye will not be prevailed with, to make it and mind it as your
duty, be assured it shall be your sin and ye shall have it for your challenge;
What? Have ye not the command of God enjoining it? Has not the Saints
practiseing of it so much, some weight with you? The plainness of the duty
will make your guilt the greater and you the more inexcusable in your
neglecting it; there are none of us but we may go home with many challenges
for our being so much entangled with the things of the world; and for the
levity, unstayednesse, unsobernesse, and carnalnesse of our Spirits, which make
us think so little and speak so little of dieing; and if any thoughts of it
occur now and then to our minds, they sink not, they affect not, they leave
not suitable impressions: If ye would essay it seriously ye should find the
fruit of it, it should further holiness, it should sober and compose you, and
fit you for any thing that may be comeing in ane ill time, for doing and for
suffering as ye should be called to it, and for death itself; God himself
give you so to essay it, as ye may find the blessed fruit and advantage of it.

SERMON VII.
Revel. 14: 13. Blessed are the dead, which die in the Lord, etc.
SInce sin entered into the world, death has been one of the most terrible
things that the children of men have to meet with, even the most terrible of
all terrible things; and indeed it is no wonder that they who know not of ane
other and better life to come, nor of the way how to come at it, esteime so of
it; It is called by Job cap. 18: 19. The King of terrors, all other terrors are
but petty and inconsiderable in respect of this; and it is one of the
beleiving-Christian his great Privileges, that he is armed for death, and that
death is disarmed as to him; Death is made a kindly friend to the beleiver, and
the terror of it is taken away; and that which the stoutest dar not, dow not,
composedly look in the face (though in a fit of manliness as they call it, or
rather of desperatnesse indeed, some will endeavor to brave it out against
death and to bear down the terror of it) the true Christian only through faith
in Christ is a victor over even over this enemy death: The scope of these
words as we show, is, that the Lord knowing how in these calamities and
troubles that were comeing, death would be frequent, and that many of the bodies
of his Saints would go among the rest, though their death be very precious in
his sight; And knowing also how despicable their death would be in the eyes of
the profane world; and how that they would be accounted the only wise and
happy men that could best shift suffering for Christ and for his truth; and
knowing withal how tempting this would be unto them, he premits this seasonable
and sweet word of comfort, Blessed are the dead, which die in the Lord, etc. as
if he had said, let not beleivers in Christ think much of death, it will not
mar their happiness but shall rather further and hasten it: So that this word
is given to strengthen and comfort the godly against such ane evil time.

From which ground we propose this second doctrine: That God has fully
furnished the beleiver in him with comfort and encouradgment against the
terriblnesse of death, so that though death be terrible in itself, yet the
beleiver hes good and sufficient ground of encouradgment against it, and may
quietly and comfortably die when God calls him, where and however it shall be;
there is nothing in death that needs to fear him, the Word of God has given
him notable grounds of comfort and encouragment to bear him through it most
heartsomely, and in the faith of that word he should walk confidently and
comfortably throw the valey of the shadow of death and fear none ill; There
are two things in this doctrine much to the same purpose: 1. That the Lord
allows the beleiver to be comforted in his death, and therefore hes allowed
him grounds of strong consolation. 2. That the beleiver who has these grounds,
should make use of them to bear him cheerfully and comfortably through death; so
the Lord speaking of Death and Judgment, Luke 21. 28. says to, and commands,
beleivers in him, When ye shall see these things come to pass, then look up
and lift up your heads for the day of your redemption draws nigh, beside many
other commands that are frequent in the Scriptures to this purpose; and how
many of the Saints resting on and improveing these grounds have died most
willingly, pleasantly, comfortably, and joyfully? Take for instance old Simeon,
who sweetly says, Luke 2. Now let thou thy Servant depart in peace, etc.
He begs leave to be gone; And if ye look to Paul, O! how earnestly does he long
for his pass and dimission, and how heartily does he welcome the thoughts of
it? Philip. 1: 21. To clear the doctrine a little, we shall speak somewhat to
these two things. 1 What are the things that ordinarily make death terrible. 2.
What are the grounds of comfort and refreshing, or the refreshful
considerations that beleivers have in the way of grace against these grounds of
terror, and the latter will be found very far greater then the former; only
take this word of caution or warning, that we speak not of death so, as if it
were comfortable to die simply, or as if it were so to all; no not so, for its
terrible to all them that die in sin and out of Christ; but to them that
believe in him, and take his own way to this blessed end of dieing in him, to
all them and to them only, is death comfortable and refreshing, and to none
others.

But 1. As to these things that make death terrible and so much to be feared,
they are especially these five. 1. There is something natural in death that
makes it terrible, and that is, the dissolution of that intime, closse, and
strait union, which is betwixt the soul and the body; which separation of these
two great intimates being contrary to nature, cannot but be abhorrent and
terrible to it; and death withal, in its large extent, being a part and fruit
of the curse, and a bitter fruit of man's departure from God, its no wonder it
be terrible. 2ly, There is something in death that is penal; as it is the wages
of sin (just now hinted) it has challenges flowing from the law with it, which
speak in the conscience; this is the fruit of sin, and has a right with it to
dominion over the sinner flowing from the breach of the Law of God; and were
there no more then this in death it might make it terrible to all; Hence its
said, 1 Cor. 15: 20. that the sting of death is sin, because it were nothing to
die if there were no challenge for sin in it; and the strength of sin is the
Law, because the Law curses every one that continues not in all things that
are written in it to do them, Gal. 3. 10. So that by this means death has
dominion over all, and brings all as in their natural condition under wrath.
3ly, There is something that is accidental (if we may so speak) in death, and
that is, the greatness and greivousnesse of pain that ordinarily takes hold of
men and women when death as a King of terrors draws near; and sometimes some
other circumstances concur to make it terrible, as namely, that it comes at
such a time, very surpriseingly, that it comes by such a sort of sickness that
it may be is loathsome and somewhat thought shame of, that it trysts the person
in such a place and among such a company, and it may be at distance from all
friends and familiars. 4ly, There is a^e uncowthnesse and strangeness in the
thing, that makes it terrible; the man that now is a dieing never died before,
and none can tell him to the full and to the life what and how great a thing it
is to lay down his life; a thing which he never experienced before; for his
thoughts, affections, delights, desires, and designs are all much changed and
altered from what they were; Yea, that wherein he had pleasure is possibly his
bane and torment; his thoughts of the world are quite another thing then
sometime they were; It is then no wonder that folks scar and be very fearful to
adventure on a voyage, whereof none can give them a particular and exact
account as having sailed it before them, and with which they themselves have
never been acquainted, and which has such terrible effects, especially where
faith in Christ is wanting. 5ly, That which accompanies and follows death
makes it terrible, if it were to go to the dust as the beast does, it were
nothing so terrible, but to have ane immortal soul that must appear before the
tribunal of the great God, and must go through the hands of his holy severe
Justice, where the least sin will draw on damnation, and where the sentence
that's once past is never to be revocked; O! what a concerning and terrible
thing is that? And however while men are in health they think but little of it,
yet it has a broad look at death: Nay if you will consider men as men, much
more as having some light of the Gospel, ye would think it matter of
admiration, that the serious thoughts of what follows after death, does not
putt them quite beside themselves, and fright them out of their wits; However,
to die carelessly and without satisfaction anent ane interest in Christ, is
doubtless a most terrible thing.

In the 2d place, If ye look to the allowance that beleivers have, and to their
grounds of comfort against these things that are terrible in death, ye will see
them to be far greater and stronger then they are terrible; For clearing
whereof, Consider, 1. The grounds of the beleivers peace and comfort in dieing.
2. The fruits that flow from these grounds, which are exceeding refreshing and
encouradging, and which ye would carefully gather and lay up against the time
of dieing, and take such a way of living as ye may have right to them when ye
come to die.

First then for the grounds of beleivers peace and comfort, consider these, 1.
Gods over-ruleing providence in the least circumstance that concerns a
beleivers death, Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints,
Psalm. 116. v. 15. He looks to their death as a matter of special concernment,
the time, the sickness, the kind of death, whither a violent or natural, a
lingering or sudden death, are all determined and concluded with him. I said,
says David, thou art my God, my times are in thy hand, deliver me from the
hand of mine enemies, Psalm. 31. 15. his interest in God sweetneth all to him,
and it also comforts him against the persecution of enemies, that it was not in
men's hand to putt ane end to his life when they pleased, but in Gods. 2ly,
Consider our Lord Jesus his special commission in reference to death as he is
Mediator, whom God has furnished with all power in Heaven and Earth; Therefore
when John is affrayed to die Revel. 1. v. 18. He laid his hand on him, and said
unto him fear not, I have the keys of Hell and of Death: The godly need not be
surprised with it, as if it could seize or take hold of them without
commission, for death has not the keys of itself in keeping, but he bears
them all; the world cannot take the bodily life of a Saint from him, till he
grant a commission for that effect: Is it not then very comfortable to be in
such a blessed estate about which he does in a special manner order and
command all? Most certainly it is. A 3d ground of consolation, is taken from
our Lords satisfaction and death; and this is a maine one which has many
grounds of comfort in it, he died and was laid in the grave; Hence 1, He has
satisfied the Law and taken away the curse, 2 Cor. 5. v. last. He was made sin
for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him:
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.
Gal. 3. 13. Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
and that was contrary to us, taking it out of the way and nailing it to his
cross, and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them
openly triumphing over them in it, Col. 2: 14, 15. his death is our victory
over death, he disarmed the Devil by his dieing, and became the death of death,
as it is, Hosea 13. O death I will be thy plagues, O grave I will be thy
destruction; He by lyeing in the grave has sweetened it to beleivers, so that
they need not fear to lie where he lay. 2. His resurrection compleats the
consolation, it shows that death is his captive, that it prevailed not over
him, but that he prevailed over it and spoiled it of its power; so that
beleivers may sweetly sing, O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy
victory? Thanks be to God who has given us the victory, th^ugh Christ's
resurrection, he having satisfied for them and in their room; this is the
ground of the Apostles triumph, Romans 8. 33. Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifies, who shall condemn? It is
Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again; Let the Law, Justice, the
Devil, and sin come forth, they have no just ground of challenge or plea
against the beleiver, for the debt is paid, Christ is dead and risen and has
got a discharge; this is the fundation of a beleivers comfort, considering
that Christ died to prevent all right in any party or person to challenge or
implead him. 3. His intercession yet further compleats the consolation, for he
has not left the beleiver to die his alone nor to live his alone, but the
benefits of his purchase are made forth-comeing for him, according to his
prayer, John 17. 24. (and he is the same now in Heaven that he was on earth)
where he says, Father, I will that these whom thou have given me be with me
where I am, that they may behold my glory: The sum of his intercession, is to
ge^t beleivers made conquerours, and it is not fully satisfied ^ill they be
completely so; This is a very great ground of comfort, that when the beleiver
cannot pray for himself, and possibly his senses fail and are gone, and the
prayers of others can be but little refreshing, that even then he is reached by
the benefit of Christ's intercession. A 4th ground, is the consideration of
Gods Covenant, and of his love and faithfulness in keeping Covenant, even in
and through death, when David 2 Samuel 23: 5. is about to comfort himself
against death (which seems to be his scope in these words) he draws his comfort
from this ground, that God has made with him ane everlasting Covenant, ordered
in all things and sure: And the Covenant holds forth five propperties in God,
that do most strongly comfort against death: 1. The Love of God, that is
stronger then death, for death will never overcome it, but it overcomes death;
Who shall separat us from the Love of God, saves the Apostle, Romans 8: 37 shall
tribulation, or distress, or persecution etc? Nay in all these things, we are
more then conquerours through him that loved us: The love of God getts the
victory, and gives the beleiver the victory over all not only in life but in
death, it being of infinitely broad extent and of everlasting duration. 2. His
Faithfulness in this Covenant is plighted to the beleiver, which death takes
not away, hence God is said to be the God not of the dead, but of the living;
Though Abraham be dead yet is he his God still, the covenant relation is not
dissolved, but as he is faithful in keeping Covenant to him while he is alive,
so is he at death, which is the prefixed term for making all the promises of
the Covenant fully forthcomeing, and for entering beleivers in possession of
them. A 3d propperty, is Gods Wisdom in frameing the Covenant so suteably,
that it comforts not only in life but at death, therefore its said to be
ordered in all things, the promises of grace and mercy in the Covenant, are not
only to give pardon here alonge the beleivers life, but assured quietness at
death, even though sense and feiling be gone. A 4th propperty, is the Justice
of God, which though it seem to be most terrible, yet is it comfortable to
beleivers against death, Henceforth is laid up for me, says the Apostle, 2 Timothy 4. 8. a crown of righteousness, which God the righteous judge shall give
to me at that day: For it is just with God to give to beleivers what Christ
has bought and purchased at so dear a rate for them, to give them comfort who
have betaken themselves to him for it; for though he gives nothing to beleivers
on the account of their merit, yet there is a su^eablenesse and
proportionablenesse by which he walks toward them, and without all doubt
Christ has merited these great things for them, which God in Justice is
oblidged to him to bestow on them The 5th and last propperty, is the Power of
God, which is engadged for the keeping beleivers to salvation, 1 Pet. 1: 5. he
has spoken the word and he can and will make it good, and there is nothing
wherein his power shines forth more conspicuously, then in their supportance
and through-bearing in their death, when tentations are readily strongest. A
5th ground, is the begun operation and work of the Spirit of God, considered
either as his comfortable work, as he is the Spirit of adoption bearing
witness with their Spirits, or as it is his sanctifieing and mortifieing work,
killing inward lusts, or as it is his strengthening or quickening work, whereby
he keeps life in the beleiver, and gives him ane earnest of that which is
comeing; the more of these he has he may the more quietly and comfortably die,
the seed of God is in him and is keept still alive in him; And now since God in
his providence, Christ in his death, resurrection, intercession, and
administration of his offices, Gods Covenant and all his propperties, with the
work of his Spirit, are all ingadged for the beleiver; what more can be
required for his comfortable through-bearing in death? And yet all these are
Gods allowance on him, even on every one that has made his peace with God
through Jesus Christ; are they not then, O! are they not blessed that die in
the Lord?

In the 2d place, take some comfortable considerations as so many fruits that
spring from these grounds, or as so many fruits of Gods love and everlasting
Covenant. 1. God gives charge to his Angels to attend on beleivers at death,
for convoying their souls to the bosom of Abraham, Luke 16. for if Angels be
ministering Spirits to page and wait on them in their life, they are much more
so at their death; God is so tender of them that he has Angels more then one
waiting on them; And though this come not up the length of the former grounds
of comfort, springing more immediately from the Father, the Sone, and the Holy
Spirit, yet its exceeding comfortable when neither Minister nor Friend can
comfort, that they have glorious Angels to be with them for ever, to convoy
them to Heaven, which is by them accounted ane honorable piece of service. 2.
The present happiness wherewith the soul is possessed on the back of death,
(for its immediately carried as I said, to the bosom of Abraham, or rather to
the bosom of Jesus Christ) Take a word of it in these two (which we spoke to
more largely before,) 1. They have a perfect freedom from all ills of this
life, no sin, no challenge, no accusation, no cross, no difficulty, no weight,
all ^ears are wiped from their eyes, sorrow and sighing flee away, they have
absolute freedom from all the disquietnesse that is here: 2. They are brought
to the possession of their hope, they are brought to the immediate enjoyment of
God and of Christ as man visible, they are furnished with all desyreable
perfections, nothing is now in part, all is perfect, they are perfect in
knowledge, they have a clear resolution to all their doubts anent things which
we disput long about here with much contention, and seldom come to a clearly
satisfieing close; a glance of God and of Christ fully satisfies as to all
these; There is ane admission to all the privileges of Heaven, a place given
among them that stand by, a sitting on Thrones with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob*
M^ses, Samuel, David, and with the rest of the Prophets; with Paul, James*
John, and the rest of the Apostles, where they behold the face of God and of
the Lamb, and are amongst his attendants serveing him always without any the
least weariness, weight, or burden, without any difficulty or indisposition,
and blessing and praising him for ever and ever; And is not this a most
heartsome and comfortable life and lot? May not a beleiver then yield to death,
yea and make it very welcome on this ground? Considering what a miserable world
he lives in, and how eminently, abundantly, and superexcellently all the vain
and evanishing shadows and shows here away are made up, by what is most real,
solid, substantial, satisfieing, and abiding there. There is 3ly, the
resurrection of beleivers bodies; though this tabernacle be dissolved and go
to the dust, yet up again it must; and that part of Isaias his song, Cap. 26.
is then eminently verified, Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body
shall they arise; awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust, for their dew is as
the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead: As in winter the
herbs are not seen, yet the roots remain in the ground and they rise again
in the spring, so (says faith resting on the word of promise) shall the
bodies of the godly and these that lie down mortal rise immortal, having
agility and aptitude to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes; these bodies
that were sown in cor^uption and dishonor, and which after a while lyeing in
the ground become very loathsome, shall be raised in incorruption and glory,
even conform to the glorious body of Jesus Christ; these bodies that were sown
in weakness, even such weakness that they could not go on their own feet to
the grave, nay that were without all life, motion, sense, and feiling, shall be
raised in power, as you may see at greater length in these excellently sweet
and comfortable words of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15. wherein not only he clears the
great truth of the resurrection, but also shows what grounds of comfort
himself and other beleivers had against death in it. 4ly and lastly, Consider
what will be the souls and the bodies case when that desyreable day of the
resurrection comes, when these two old intimats shall meet together, and as it
were renew their acquaintance again in much better condition then they parted,
there will be no more a wrestling thenceforth betwixt flesh and spirit, but a
holy harmony in ane unit and joint enjoying of God, in ane unit and joint
delighting in, and serving of God, and in ane unit and joint satisfaction in
God and in being with God for evermore, for we shall be for ever wi^h the Lord,
says the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 4. Wherefore, says he, comfort one another with
these words; As indeed there is good and non-such ground to do: Consider
withal the great honor they will have at Judgment, and the happiness
following it. To return then to what we proposed, seeing beleivers in Christ
have such pregnant and impregnable grounds to comfort them against death, and
seeing such sweet and passing-excellent fruits flow from these grounds, and
since there is such a begun good at death that has no end, may they not be
very quiet in their life and at their death, and be exceedingly comforted,
whatever be the time, the place, or manner, that God in his wisdom shall
think fit to call them by death out of this present evil world?

We come now to the Uses of this sweet point of doctrine; And the first use is
of exhortation to beleivers: 1. To lay up this comfort, and 2ly, To bless God
for this comfort, that he has provided so very well for you both in this life,
and at and after your death; 3ly, Bless him that ever he was graciously
pleased to bring you to this happy condition, when he might have left you
altogether comfortless both in life and death, O! bless him that he has
given his Son Jesus Christ, that he is come, and that grace is through him
extended that broad as to take you in: It should make you cry with holy David
in a transport of admiration, what am I, and what is my fathers house, that
thou have brought me hitherto: 2 Samuel 7. and with him to say, I bless the Lord
that has given me counsel, Psalm 16,

But 2ly, There are two uses we would speak a little more particularly to, the
first whereof, is to exhort you to that which is the sum of all we have
spoken to you from these words, even to study to live so as ye may die in
Christ, which death, has so many and so strong grounds of consolation waiting
it, that all the world cannot possibly parallel or equal them; If here were not
another motive to press you to faith in Christ, and to mortification, and to
the making of your calling and election sure, this is sufficient, that these
things have such comforts at death and against it, which are the most
uncontravertibly sure, stable, and lasting grounds of comfort; other grounds of
comfort that go quite dry and evanish at death, are but miserable comforters,
and like Job's winter-brookes of water, that in summer disappoint the weary
traveller, and send him away ashamed; but these comforts can guard the heart
against the law, against challenges for sin, and against the Devil; nay let us
suppose, that there were millions of Devils, and of challenges for sin, and of
laws transgressed thereby, to speak and pass sentence against the beleiver in
Christ, there is mighty and mervelous ground of comfort for him against them
all here, he may appear and appeal and confidently say, there are more with me
then against me; death to him wants its sting, and ^in its strength, and he may
stop over the bound-rode (to say so) and border of time into eternity, with a
song of praise and triumph in his mouth, and die as quietly and confidently as
if he were to lie down in his bed, as it is Isa. 57. v. 1, 2. yea, with a great
deal more quietness, confidence, and cheerfulness: Therefore were ye to choice
a way of living, let it be this, even to live so as ye may die in Christ; This
is, as I said, the great scope of all that we have spoken from these words,
even to stir you up to live so as ye may be happy at your death, and that is
to die in him: I shall propose but one consideration to enforce this upon you,
and its this, that way of living and dieing has with it ane alteration of the
nature of all things; when a man is ane enemy to God, all things are accursed
to him, but when he is befreinded to God and in good terms with him, all
things are blessed to him, and work together for his good, Romans 8. v. 28 and
death comes in amongst these all things; All things are yours, says the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 3. at the close, whither Paul, or Cephas, life, or death,
things present, or things to come, they are all at your service, they are all
yours as to the blessed use of them; they work together for your good, and prove
all contributive and subservient to your bringing to glory.

The 2d Use on the other hand, is to let all of you see what great prejudice
ye suffer, and what disadvantage ye lie under, that live not so as ye may die
in Christ; ye have nothing to do with any the least of all these consolations,
and therefore in the name of the Lord ye are inhibited and discharged to meddle
with them; See that none of you who resolve not to rest on Christ by faith, to
live holily, and to show forth his praise, by a shineing and exemplary
conversation, dar to prefume to put forth your hand to touch these
consolations; that terrible word in the 7. of Jeremy, calls for your
consideration, Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
and come and stand before me in this House, and say we are delivered to do all
these abominations? Will ye take your own way of profane living, and yet
expect any benefit of my Covenant, or any saveing fruit of my grace; As God
reckoned with profaine Israel, so shall he reckon with you, and shall separat
you from his people unto a curse, and the anger of God shall smoke against you;
not one graceless sinner shall be permitted to join himself with, or to
lurk amongst, the great company and congregation of these godly; Angels shall
separat you from them, and the sentence of the judge shall separat you from him
and them with that doolful, depart from me, ye workers of iniquity; and that
sentence will be as terrible to you as the godlies sentence will be comfortable
to them, Come ye blessed of my Father etc. Take notice of this all ye that
think ye would feign die well, (and no mervel, for so did profane Balaam
desire to die the death of the righteous) but have no care to live well; when
all t^is doctrine is summed up, it will draw your happiness on this very hinge
and bring it to this issue, whither ye will indeed in the Lords strength sent
yourselves to live so as ye may die in Christ, then in this case all these
consolations, even all the consolations of the Gospel, shall be yours, but not
one of them all is yours otherwise; To them that die in the Lord and to them
only, is happiness promised, but on the contrary to all them that live not to
him, and die not in him, God is ane enemy in life and in death, his curse
follows them here, and cleaves closse to them as a girdle does to the loins
of a man in the grave, so that they shall never be able to shake it off; sins
and challenges shall then be multiplied, death shall then putt forth its stinge
and sin its strength; the grave shall then obtain full victory over them, it
shall feed on them; but it shall not be so with the godly, it shall have no
dominion over them as it has over the wicked that die in their sins and out
of Christ, death and the curse make a morsal, as it were, of all that live and
die out of Christ, it eats them up and consumes them for evermore; when the
first death is over and gone, the second death takes hold of them and never
lets go its hold; so that death will still, even through all eternity pursue
the quarrel against them, And therefore let me shut up all with two words; The
1st whereof is to you who make conscience of being and living in Christ, though
ye come short of that which ye much covet and long to be at, and is called for
from you, which is your burden and affliction; yet consider what a comfortable
allowance ye have from God, who is the God of all consolation, and be comforted
in it; what ever be your lot and condition in the world, be what it will or may
be, a little time will put it by and to ane end; Therefore I say, take
encouragment from these grounds of consolation that God has given you against
the terriblenesse of death, and walk so as ye may not mar your own comfort;
and withal, bless God who has given you such good ground of hope, ye have
more to make a truly comfortable life to you, then all the Kings and great men
in the earth have that are out of Christ; ye may be very sinfully defective in
this much called-for duty of blessing God, who has provided so notably well
for you, and may robe him of the glory that is infinitely due to him from you,
on many O! very many accounts, if ye look not to it.

The 2d word, is to all of you whom we would earnestly beseech, for the Lords
sake, and as ye prize these mercies, to take the way that God has shalked out
to come by them; dieing in the Lord is the great qualification that has all
these comforts annexed to it, and living in, and to him, is the indispensably
requisite qualification of all that would die in him, and this is to live by
faith in the Sone of God, and to live Christ-like, to live so as Christ may
live in you and ye may live in him, that the truth and the straitness of your
union with him may be evident and apparent by the fruits of it; In a word, to
live in continual communion with him, and in the closse and constant pursuit of
conformity to him; We will dar to say to you that live so, yea, to all of you
on condition ye will through grace choice this way of living, that ye shall die
happy, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, and will make it good,
Blessed are they which die in the Lord, he has pronounced blessedness on
such, in death and after death; And upon the other hand, if ye will betake
yourselves to the way of the most part, and live carnally and carelessly, and
will not think more on death, and will do no more to prepare and make ready
for it, alace! we must say to you, and dar not but say to you, and the Lord
will ratify and confirm it, that ye have nothing to do with these comforts
of his people, nor have any part or portion in them; And if so, what have ye to
comfort yourselves in, though ye were all Kings and Queens, of the most
opulent, potent, and floorishing Kingdoms in the World? God will say to you,
that ye had nothing to do, to take his Covenant in your mouths, since ye hated
to be reformed: And though poor wretches, ye now live in carnal mirth and
jollity, yet your laughter and joy, your singing and dancing, shall by and by
be turned into mourning, into weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth, as your
mirth and laughter end, your weeping and houling shall begin but never end: Is
there not then, O! is there not great, vastly great difference betwixt dieing
in sin and dieing in Christ? And all this depends on your way of living, And is
there not a necessity, a most absolute and indispensible necessity of your
being in him, and of your living in him and to him, as ye would not to your
eternal prejudice and loss, be found mistaking or not duly considering these
things that belong to your peace, till this your day be over and gone, and
matters betwixt him and you be past all ridding and remedy? Now the Lord
himself who only can do it, powerfully persuade and prevail with you, so to
live that ye may have the well-grounded hope of dying in Christ, since blessed
and only blessed are they who die in the Lord, who rest from their labors and
whose works follow them.

late Minister of the Gospel, to suc^ unto whose hands some printed papers,
called Sermons, bearing the said Mr. William Guthrie his name, may come.

Christian Reader.
BEing much afflicted with the sight of some printed papers or Sermons, to
which the name of my worthy Husband, now with the Lord, is prefixed, by these
who have published them, because I found many things therein injurious, not
only to his memory, but to the truth; I was therefore at the pains to cause
compare them with his notes I have beside me, and likewayes, to interrogat some
of his most conscientious and judicious ordinary hearers yet living, anent the
same; And after due and serious consideration of the whole, I dar very
confidently declare, that they are not the genuine works and Sermons of my
forsaid Husband, which may be very evident to all that knew him, considering
the perplexed style, the confusion and want of connection, and a multitude of
vain repetitions, that are oftentimes to be found therein, as also want of that
clear method familiar to him, together with the unsoundnesse sometimes of the
matter, which was known to be far from him, being well instructed in the form
of sound words, which in all discourses to the people he held fast. More^ver,
there be many things therein clear nonsense and not intelligible by the ^eader,
a fault very far from his way in preaching But this is to be the less wondered
at, seeing that when he was yet alive, some made bold to print some S^mons of
his without his knowledge, which he wo^ld not own, and therefore was necessitat
to emit these papers himself, to the advantage of the truth, which otherwise
had been wronged. It is hoped therefore that every conscientious person will be
so far tende^ of the truth, and of the fame of such a faithful Minister of the
Gospel, who is not now to speak for himself, that they will not look upon
these printed Sermons a^ his works, seeing they have been put forth to the
public view, without the knowledge or consent of any of his relations, or
Brethren of the Ministry, who were particularly acquaint with him and his way of
doctrine, and to whom if he had minded any thing for the press, he would have
left the charge of the oversight thereof: The world has already had a taste of
his gift, and of the Spirit that appeared in him, in that useful little book
published by himself, and blessed of God to the edification of many, which I
hope will easily move the observing and judicious Reader, to have these lately
printed under his name in suspicion; I shall add no more but for the future
entreat, that nothing bearing his name, may be looked upon as his, that is not
attested by his nearest relations, and his Brethren of the ministry, This from

Thy Well-wisher A. C.
