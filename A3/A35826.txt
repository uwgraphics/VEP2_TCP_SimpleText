Du tres-haut, tres-puissant, et tres-illustre Prince GUJLLAUME Fills de la
Princess ANNE par le Prince GEORGE de DANEMARC; Chevalier du tres-noble Order

TO THE Most Illustrious and Highborn Prince, WILLIAM Duke of Gloucester, etc.
KNIGHT and COMPANION Of the Most Noble Order of the GARTER.
May it please your Highness;
YOUR near Relation to the Imperial Crown of England, whence those HONORS
comprised in this ensuing Treatise are derived, induced me, with all Submissive
Deference, to lay these First Fruits of my poor Endeavors at Your Highnesses
Feet, as an humble Oblation of my Dutiful Service, in a modest Assurance of
Your Favorable Acceptance and Patronage; an Encouragement able to put Life
into the Meanest Undertaker, and without which it must never have appeared in
Public, the Author being every way too Inconsiderable to afford it the least
Protection.

The much-loved Name of Favorite GLOUCESTER, is alone sufficient to Guard it
against the Censures of the Prejudiced and Envious, who, through a lazy
Malignity, decry many very Useful Performances, rather than take the Pains of
out-doing 'em by any Commendable Attempts of their Own.

That Noble Disposition and Generous Condescension, Mighty PRINCE, so eminently
Conspicuous in Your Highness, is too well Known, and justly Celebrated, to
receive an Additional Luster from any faint Encomiums of mine: I shall
therefore readily acknowledge my own Inability, by declining the Custom of such
Addresses, and only Presume to make it my Constant and most Ardent Prayer, That
Your Great Birth and Glorious Endowments may be further Ennobled by Your yet
Greater and more Glorious Achievements; And that, as You are now in Your
Blooming Youth, the Darling Object of Great Britain 's most Promising Hopes,
so, in Your Riper Age, You may be the Delightful Subject of its Loftiest
Panegyrics, and Europe 's united Admiration: That so, after You Have attained the
Highest Step of Earthly Grandeur, and numerous Years prosperously enjoyed the
Happy Honor, You may from thence have the easier Ascent to a Celestial Throne:
Which, as it is the NATIONS Universal Wish, shall in a more especial manner be
sincerely offered up to Heaven by,

Illustrious SIR, Your HIGHNESS's Most humbly Devoted, and most Faithful
Servant, ROBERT DALE.

Note. The King of Sweden is very lately Dead, whereby the First Stall on the
Prince's Side, in the Scheme of the Knights of the Garter, (inserted after the
Preface) is become Void.

And, That the late PROMOTIONS, with the Alterations made at Court, upon His
Majesty's going beyond Sea, are all carefully observed in the Supplemental
Addenda, etc. following the Index.

THE PREFACE.
MY PROFESSION obliging me, in some measure, to acquaint my self with these
Matters of HONOR, I began this Collection purely for my own private
Satisfaction, and having finished it, was persuaded to make it Public, in hope
'twould not prove altogether Unacceptable to the Curious, who rather want the
Leisure than Convenience for a more Perfect Information, by consulting those
large and elaborate Volumes Sir William Dugdale Knight, late Garter Principal
King of Arms, (and some time Blanch-Lion Pursuivant Extraordinary) has written
on this Subject, I mean his BARONAGE and SUMMONS to PARLIAMENT, which I Have
chiefly followed, excepting where by the Light of other Approved Authors, it
may reasonably be Presumed those BOOKS are mistaken.

What was further Requisite for Accomplishing this Work, is taken from the best
Authorities and Intelligence that could well be had, and therefore I dare be
Answerable it is less Erroneous than any Thing of the like kind yet extant;
although it must fall short of Absolute Perfection, that (the Difficulties
considered) being almost Impossible in such an Undertaking.

The METHOD I Have pursued herein, is so apparently easy and natural, it needs
no Explanation: However, lest any may Except against the orderly Distribution
of the Accidental Official Titles, 'twill notwithstanding be necessary for me
frankly to acknowledge, That I could never yet observe there was any constant
settled Rule for the due Regulation of 'em, but that every Writer on this
Subject manifestly appears to have been guided by his own particular Fancy,
with some little Regard to the smoother Currency of Style: So that having in
this Composure first set down in order the Hereditary, and then subjoined all
the other Temporary Honors, which occurred to my Knowledge, with respect to
their closer Connection and Affinity; I shall not here in the least Endeavor to
Justify (much less Impose) my Opinion, but freely afford every one (as
Occasion requires) the liberty of ranking them according to their various
Judgments and Discretion.

I may rationally suppose NONE can be so wilfully Blind, as not to perceive,
That the CREATIONS for the most part have Reference to the nearer or more
remote Ancestors or Ancestor of the respective Nobleman to whom they are
immediately applied, and generally concentre in Him, as the Heir by Lineal or
Collateral Succession, according to the Prime Entails, unless in some of the
latest Promotions, which are therefore both Obvious and well enough Known to have
been Conferred on the present Possessors.

But the Baronies by Writ being many times derived through several Heirs general
successively, seemed (I confess) to exact a more Intelligible Deduction; for
notwithstanding the Different Summons of the Families by whom they Descend, to
those who now enjoy the Titles, be punctually recounted, some Persons (it is
probable) may expect I should have been more Express; yet that will be soon
Answered for, if it be considered, I propose not a full and perspicuous
Illustration of their Genealogical Series, (as being already Performed by Able
Hands) but only a Slight Glance at the Intermedial Course of such Honors (by
Female Heirs) from one Surname to another, for the more certain Passage to
their Original Source and Rise.

Nevertheless, in some sort to Excuse my self, and partly remove that
Inconvenience, I shall gratify the Reader with a summary Account of all the
Barons called to Parliament by Writ, treated of in this small Piece, as they
present themselves to View in the several Pages thereof, whereunto the Numbers
foregoing 'em exactly refer, viz.

Having with all possible Brevity thus far cleared my way, I shall next proceed
to Remark, That in the ARMS I Have carefully noted where the Modern Usage varies
from the strictness of the Ancient Bearing, whether by Augmentation or
otherwise; So likewise where the Maternal Coat has been Assumed, and the
Paternal either Disused or entirely Relinquished.

By the Hints under this Head, 'twill not be difficult to guess whose Natural
Issue those were, who are either Illegitimate, or descend from such Ancestors;
as for instance, in the Duke of Berwick, The Arms of King James the Second are
described within a Bordure Compone Gules and Azure; the First charged with
Lions of England, and the Last with Fleurs de Lis of France, (the Distinction
give him by that King) denoting both his Illegitimacy and Father.

In the Proper Coats of several LORDS SPIRITUAL, for default of Constant
Entries in our Visitation-Registers, I was under a necessity of having Recourse
to Seals and Sculptures, where the Colors not appearing, or being (at best)
very dubiously distinguished, I thought 'twould much better become me (in so
great an Incertainty) to acquiesce with giving some Notice of the Charge, and
leave the Blazon deficient, than unadvisedly hazard the not doing their
Lordships Right, or (perchance) Injuring any other Families of their or another
Name.

It remains now I should suggest but One Thing more to inform the Reader, That
for rendering my DESIGN complete, I have Prefixed a SCHEME which by Inspection
shows him the Installations of the Knights of the Garter respectively, and
likewise Affixed a Perfect INDEX, Alphabetically digested, whereby he may
certainly find what TITLES of HONOR exist in any of the Nobility, as also in
what Counties those Places lie from whence they are assumed; most especially
Useful to such as may be Unacquainted, who are really PEERS, or only Titular
Lords, by the Courtesy of England; as the Eldest Sons of Noblemen, bearing
their Father's Inferior Title.

To conclude; As neither my Years nor Reading furnished me with any great
Advantages for this ESSAY, wherein too I Have been wholly destitute of all
foreign Assistance; So, no Pains has been spared, which might conduce to make
it Correct: Therefore, I hope, 'twill find the more Candid Construction from
the Ingenuous Perusers: And to such as may Dislike it, I shall Address my self
only with an Apology borrowed from Horace; -- Si quid novisti rectius istis,
Candidus imperti: Si non, his utere mecum.

Archbps.
The Archbishop of Canterbury takes Place next after the Princes of the

The Archbishop of York takes Place before all the Nobility (except Prince
George of Denmark) and the Great Officers, next after the Lord High Chancellor,
or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England.

The Bishops (whereof London, Bishops.
Durham, and Winchester always precede the rest) take Place next after the
Viscounts, before the Barons, and are ranked according to the Seniority of
their several Consecrations.

Note. The three Bishops before mentioned, have Precedence (as it is anciently
remembered) for the Considerations following, viz.

I. The Bishop of London, for that his See is the King's Chief Chamber.

Bishops.
II. The Bishop of Durham, for that he not only in the King's Defense, within
his Diocese, wears Armor as a Knight in the Field, with his Power against
the King's Enemies; but also has his Prerogative, as his Exchequer and other
Courts, as the King has; whereby he is a Count-Palatine. And,

III. The Bishop of Winchester, [who has anciently sometimes been styled
Count-Palatine of Hampton] as Prelate always of the most Noble Order of the
Garter.
