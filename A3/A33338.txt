TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL His much Honored friends, Sir RICHARD PIGOT OF
DODDERSHALL Knight, And to the Virtuous and truly Religious Lady his Wife.
Sir, Madam,
I Have longed for an opportunity whereby I might testify my gratitude unto
you for your Noble favor in so freely conferring the Rectory of Grendon upon
my eldest Son: as also for those many encouragements which he has since
received from you: and this (I conceived) I could not better do then by
presenting this Book unto you wherein you have the substance of many worthy
men's labors upon several Heads in Divinity contracted into a narrow room.
Solomon, the wisest of men, tells us, that of making (which is true also of
reading) many Books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the
flesh: Eccl. 12.12.
yet to have the choiceest flowers transplanted out of several gardens into a
little parcel of ground, cannot but minister both pleasure and profit.
Concerning this Subject, a Learned, famous, and Reverend Divine has left us
his thoughts in these words: Of all Divinity (says he) that part is most
useful which determines Cases of Conscience, B. H^lls Epist. to his Cases of
Conscience
and of all Cases of Conscience the practical are most necessary; as action is
of more concernment then speculation. Such you shall find here, whereby you
may be guided both in private and public; and whereby, as in an impartial
Glass, you may view the face, and know the true state of your souls, and be
directed to be the more exemplary in your lives* you know that Magnates sunt
Magnetes, great ones, like Load-stones, draw many by their examples, and
inferiors look upon them as their Looking-glasses, by which they usually dress
themselves: Its very observable, that when Crispus the chief Ruler of the
Synagogue believed, many of the Corinthians believed also; Act. 18.8.
and I doubt not but your constant and diligent attending upon the public
Ministry (though at a great distance from you) does attract and quicken many of
your Tenants and neighbors to do the like. It makes you also precious in the
eyes of God and his people, Summum apud Deum est nobilitas* cl^rum esse
virtutibus* Hierom.
the best Nobility is to excel in grace, and virtue; and this cannot be better
discovered then by love to Gods Ministers, and a careful Sanctification of the
Lords day: and what Influence such examples have upon the vulgar is obvious to
every eye. I have read that Queen Elizabeth once riding progress into Suffolk,
said, that now she saw the reason why that Country was so well governed; for
she observed that all the Justices, and Gentlemen coming to meet her, had every
one his Minister next to his person. And truly they that honor God, shall be
honored by him, he will be a Sun and a shield unto them; Psalm. 48.11.
he will give them grace here, and glory hereafter; and no good thing will he
withold from them which walk uprightly. Godliness is the highway to
happiness, the good old way that has ever been beaten by all those Saints
that now find rest unto their souls. What Aeneas Silvius said of learning, may
much more be said of Religion, and righteousness: Vulgar men should esteem it
as silver, Noble men as gold, and Princes should prize it above their chiefest
pearls. Semen sanctum statumenterrae, the holy seed is the substance of the
earth; Isa. 6.13.
the Saints are the people of Gods purchase, that comprehend all his gettings,
and are much more dear to him then Naboths Vineyard was to him. He sets them
before his face for ever, Psalm. 41.12. as loving to look upon them, yea, upon
the very walls of the houses where they dwell, Isa. 49.16. they are his
portion, Deuteronomy. 32.9. his inheritance, Esaias 49.16. the dearly beloved of his
soul, Jerem. 12.7. and his glory, Esaias 46.13. And thus they are though
accompanied with many weaknesses: For as David saw nothing in lame
Mephibosheth, but what was lovely, because he saw in him the features of his
friend Jonathan: So God beholding his offending Saints in the face of his
Son, takes no notice of any thing amiss in them. And truly the knowledge
and remembrance of these things is that which does wonderfully support the
godly under their greatest pressures, and draw forth their affections
Heavenward: The Saints (says a Reverend Divine) are lowly in their speeches,
but lofty in their actions; but especially in their affections, which are
carried above all Earthly Objects, and not content till they are got home to
Heaven. Col. 3.1, 2.
These stars, though they are seen sometimes in a puddle, though they
reflect there, yet they have their situation in Heaven. These Birds of
Paradise, though they may happily sometimes touch upon the Earth, yet they are
mostly upon the Wing, and these outward comforts, and Creatures are to them,
but scalae and alae, wings, and wind in their wings to carry them upwards. I
write not these things (Right Worshipful) as suspecting your ignorance, or
doubting your practice of them; but only to stir up your pure minds by
putting you in remembrance, that wherein you have begun, you may be encouraged
to persevere till you come to the full fruition, and enjoyment of that Crown
of Glory, and eternal happiness which Christ has purchased, and will certainly
confer upon all those that love him, and long for his appearing. For the
furtherance whereof, I hope the Reading of this Book may contribute something,
which is the hearty prayer, and earnest desire of him, who will not cease,

Sir, Madam, March 22. 1658/9. To Love, Honor and serve you, SA. CLARKE.

TO THE Christian Reader.
Christian Reader,
IT has been long and often complained of, that our English Divines, who of
all others are judged the fittest, and ablest to write Cases of Conscience, in
regard of their manifold experiences in this kind, have yet done so little. The
Friars and Jesuits have written many large Volumes of this Subject, which yet
are rather so many dunghills, then so many Gardens of sweet smelling Flowers,
and tend rather to the corruping of, then to the satisfying of troubled souls,
as may be amply seen in a book lately taught to speak English, called the
Mystery of Jesuitisme.

I have long expected, and hoped, that some abler pen would have undertaken
this work of such great tenderness, and vast extent, the rather because it has
been the desire, and request of all the Foreign Protestant Churches that some
such thing should be done, at least by our London Ministers. And truly the work
is too great, and the burden too heavy for one man's shoulders: Yet seeing that
none else would set about it, I, who am the most unfit, and least able for such
an Herculean labor, have adventured to publish these my first Essays: and
being conscious to my own insufficience, have made the greatest part of it,
rather a Collection out of others writings, than any thing spun out of my own
brains. Yet, besides the pains in making choice of, and going through so many
Authors, I have taken liberty to contract where it might well be done, and to
vary the phrase (not thinking fit wholly to tie my self to other men's words)
Sometimes to add, and others sometimes to leave out, where my judgment did not
concur with theirs.

I presume, I need not tell you the usefulness of this Subject. How necessary
it is to get and keep a good Conscience: To be acquainted with our Spiritual
Estate, and condition: To be directed in that great duty of self-examination:
To have rules prescribed for the right ordering of our thoughts, Words, and
Actions. To have our sins discovered that we may avoid them; and our Errors
laid open that we may amend them. For as the clearest blood makes the best
Spirits, and the purest Air breeds the greatest agility, so the holiest life
yields the soundest comfort, and the tenderest Conscience the most unspotted
life. Yea, a good Conscience will appear in the Countenance, and look merrily
out at the windows of the eyes. It made Stephen look like an Angel of God, Act
6.15 It is praemium ante praemium: Heaven aforehand: Some clusters of Grapes of
the Caelestiall Canaan. Its like Sampsons hair, that will make a man
invincible. It will stand under the greatest pressures: It made the Apostles to
go away rejoicing when they had been beaten, for that they were counted worthy
to suffer shame for Christ's sake, Act. 5.40, 41. It made many of the Martyrs to
go as merrily to dye as to dine. Be the Air clear, or cloudy, he that has a
good Conscience enjoyes perpetual serenity of soul, and sits continually at
that blessed Feast, where the holy Angels are Cooks, and Butlers (as Luther
phraseth it) and the three persons of the Trinity are gladsome Guests. Let a
man be sound within, and at peace with his own Conscience, and he will bravely
bear up under unspeakable pressures. Paul (though no man out of Hell suffered
more) Yet did he not only glory in Tribulation, but overabound exceedingly with
joy, 2 Cor. 7.4. As an old-beaten Porter to the Cross, Malluit tollerare, quam
deplorare: His stroke was heavier then his groaning, Job 23. 2. Premat corpus,
fremat Diabolus, turbat mundus, ille semper erit securus, says Bernard. Let
Men, the World, and the Devils do their worst, they can never hurt him that
has a good Conscience. Conscientia pura, semper secura. A good Conscience has
a sure confidence, he that has it sits ( Noah-like) Mediis tranquillus in
undis: quiet in the midst of greatest combustions. It will make a man sleep
without a pillow, yea without a bed. It made Jacob take such good rest upon a
stone: Peter to sleep so sweetly, though laden with Iron Chains, and (for ought
he knew) to die the next day. Philpot, and his fellow Prisoners to sing Psalms,
and to rouse as merrily in the straw in the Bishops Colehouse, as if they had
been upon down beds in a Palace. Its a Feast with any food, though never so
course and slender. Hence its excellently said: In minimo maximum est bona men's
in corpore humano: quae si adsit, delicio^ius vivit, etiam is qui teruntium non
habet in orb, quam si in unum hominem sexcentos confles Sardanapalos. Its a
full Feast, a lasting Feast: not for a day, as was Nabals: nor for seven days,
as was Sampsons; no nor for nine score days as was that of Ahashuerus: but a
durable Feast without intermission of solace, or interruption of society. Vis
ergo (O homo) semper epulari? vis nunquam tristis esse? (says Bernard) been
vive. Would thou never be sad? would thou turn thy life into a merry
Festival? Get, and retain a good Conscience: and then I may say to thee in
Solomon's words, Eccles. 9.7, 8, 9. Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and
drink thy Wine with a merry heart: For God now accepts thy works. Let thy
Garments be alwiaes white, and let thy head lack no ointment: Live joyfully
with the wife whom thou love, etc.

Thus you see what are the benefits, and privileges of a good Conscience,
which should move and quicken us to the study of Cases of Conscience, whereby
we may be enable to keep a Conscience void of offense toward God, and toward
man, Act. 24.16. and that we may be the further provoked hereunto, let us on
the other hand consider the mischiefs, and inconveniences of an evil
Conscience, one small drop whereof troubles a whole Sea of outward comforts,
and contentments, a whole confluence whereof would no more ease a wounded
Spirit, then a fair sho^e a gouty foot, or a silken stocking a broken leg.
Indeed its a burden insupportable, which is able to quail the courage, and
crush the shoulders of the strongest man upon Earth: Hence Job preferred, and
Judas chose strangling before it: Daniel chose rather to be cast to the Lions,
then to carry a Lion, and enraged Conscience in his bosom. Its an ever-gnawing
worm that is bred in this life of the f^oth of filthy lusts, and flagicious
courses, and lies gnawing upon men's inwards, many times in the ruff of all
their jollity. It was this that made Saul call for his music: Belteshazzar for
his carousing cups: Cain for his workmen to build him a City, etc. and this
they did to put by the pangs of their wounded Spirits, and throbbing
Consciences: And yet all this many times will not serve turn, as we see in
Nero, after he had killed his Mother, and Wives: In Otho, when he had slain
Galba, and Piso: In Herod the great, after he had caused his Wife Mariamne to
be put to death: In our Richard the third, after he had murdered his two
innocent Nephews: In Spira: Latomus, etc. all which were so grubbed with this
worm, that they could not be at rest neither night nor day, till being utterly
tired with continual vexation of Spirit, they either desperately slew
themselves, or were dreadfully dispatched by others. Hence Plutarch (though a
Heathen) thought that the very life of a wicked man was punishment enough
without, either God or man's revenging hand. For (says he) if they examine
their lives, they find themselves empty of grace, destitute of hope, laden
with fear, sadness, unchearfulnesse, and suspicion of what will follow after:
their lives are therefore worse then the life of a Dog: for a Dog lives without
mental sufferings, and dies, and there is an end of him: but a wicked man is
always upon the wrack whilst he lives, and is never free from the lashes of
an evil Conscience. Quid prodest bonis plena arca, si inanis sit Conscientia?
says St. Austin, what good is there in a chest full of goods, when the
Conscience is empty of goodness: Such an one is like Naaman, a rich man, but a
Leper: or like Jesabel, that (no doubt) had a cold heart under a painted face:
Such an one in the midst of his mirth has many a secret gripe, and little
knows the world where his shoe pincheth him. Every Foul that has the
beautifullest Feathers, has not the sweetest flesh: nor does every tree that
bears a goodly leaf, bear good fruit? and many things glister besides Gold:
So is it with wicked men, in the fullness of their sufficiency they are in
straits, and. Job 20.22, etc.

But I will enlarge no further: I shall only tell you that in ordering these
Cases of Conscience, I proceed (as you may easily perceive) Alphabetically,
according to the method which I used in my Mirror, where you may find Examples
suitable for these several heads, and by that little progress which I have
already made, you may judge how much is yet behind: which were enough to deter
an old man, as I am, being in the sixtieth y^ar of my age, but that, I hope, I
am doing the Lords work, and if my Master call me away before I have finished
it, I shall not much fail of St. Austins wish, who often desired that when the
Lord came, he might find him aut precantem, aut praedicantem, either praying,
or preaching. I have one request more to the godly judicious, that wherein they
observe my failings, they would be pleased either by Word or Letter to inform
me of them, that I may rectify them for the time to come: and if I find these
my poor labors useful, and acceptable to the Church of Christ, I shall be
encouraged, whilst God continues life, and health to go on in the same: I am
also to acquaint you, that the Bookseller has so ordered the Printing hereof,
that whosoever pleases, may put in fair paper between each Chapter, to make
larger Additions to the same. Thus begging thine earnest prayers for a blessing
upon my Labors both public, and private, I rest

QUESTIONS, AND CASES OF Conscience About ABSTINENCE in the Use of Lawful
things.
CHAP. I.
Quest. WHether may a man sin in the use of Lawful things?

Answ. Yea, abuse of lawful things is damnable, as well as the use of unlawful.
The abuse of lawful profits, pleasures, cares, and desires, choaks the seed of
the Word, Mat. 13.22. So Mat. 24.38. As in the days of Noah they did eat, they
drank, they married, and gave in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the Ark, etc. What? was it a sin to eat, to drink, to marry? No, but they
sinned in the abuse of these things, they were so intent upon these, that they
cast off all admonitions, and predictions of judgment. So Luke 14.18. What was
more lawful then to buy a Farm, a yoke of Oxen, or to mar^y a Wife? Yet these
shall never taste of the Supper: not because they did these things, but because
they were so inordinately intent upon them, that they refused the Call to the
Kings Supper. So 1 Cor. 10.7. The people sa^e down to eat, and drink, and rose
up to play.

Quest. Why is there so much danger in the use of lawful things?

Answ. 1. Because in using lawful things men are most secure, and think
themselves Liberties: As he laid his train against Christ himself, in the
matter of meat, and drink, when he was an hungry, Mat. 4.3. So also against us,
chiefly in things wherein God has given us allowance. Wherein was it that
Satan overcame Lot? Was it first in Incest with his daughters? No: but he first
foiled him in that which was lawful: He first abused himself with Wine, and
then in Incest.





Quest. What instances may be given to show how men abuse their lawful
Liberties with the hazard of their souls?

Answ. 1. In eating and drinking, which is not only lawful but necessary: yet
here Christians offend many ways.

1. When they eat not their own bread, earned by their lawful labor, 2 These.
3.12.

2. When they feed themselves without fear, Jude 12. not as before the Lord.

3. When they corrupt themselves in the creatures, losing sobriety, modesty,
chastity, health, and reason.

4. When they never taste the sweetness of God in the creature, more then
beasts do: nor sanctify themselves after feasting: as Job did his sons, Job
1.5.

5. When they waste the creatures, not remembering the afflictions of Jos^ph,
Amos 6.6.



First, for the matter, which is not skins as Adams, but stately and costly
beyond their rank.

2. For the manner, while they take liberty to disguise themselves in strange
attire, and monstrous fashions, showing no other hidden man of the heart but
lightness, vanity, wantonness, and thraldom, to every newfangled fashion,
for which the Lord threatened to visit the Kings children, Zeph. 1.8.

3. For the measure whilst they pass all bounds of sobriety, and prodigally
waste more on their backs, then would cloth a number of the poor servants of
Jesus Christ.

In recreation: which are both lawful and necessary: yet how do men sin

1. In respect of the matter, when with the fool, (Prove. 26.18) they make a
sport of sin: as of Dice, Cards, lascivious Dancing, Plays, Interludes, and
all other sports, wherein is neither praise, virtue, nor good report, Phil. 4.8.

2. In respect of the manner, when they turn their vocation into recreation,
pouring out their hearts unto pleasure, being lovers of pleasure more then of
God, 2 Timothy 3.4. when they waste their precious time in sports, hindering better
duties, both in their general and particular callings: dishonouring the sacred
Name of God by Oaths, blasphemous cursings, jesting upon the Holy Word of God,
jeering his Ministers, Servants, Religion, etc. or when others are hurt by
their sports, and gain by winning their money to their prejudice: or their own
estate, as Solomon says, He that loves pastime shall be a poor man, Prove.
21.17.

In Marriage: what is more necessary for man's comfort, and for the continuance
Only in the Lord, 1 Cor. 7.39. Joining themselves with Infidels, Heretics, and
enemies to the true Religion; as did Solomon to the turning away his heart from
the Lord. Others use it rather to the stirring up of natural corruptions then
to allay them: Some rather to further each other to hell then to heaven,
whilst the husband loses his authority by unthriftinesse, bitterness, or
lightness: and the wise shakes off her subjection by fullennesse, and contempt
both of his person, and commandments: Others sin more directly when the husband
leaves the wife of his youth, and embraces the bosom of a stranger: or the
wife forsakes the guide of her youth, and loves a stranger better.

In a man's calling, wherein its lawful and necessary for a man to busy
himself: Manna on the Sabbath-dayes, which shall rot between their teeth: or by
driving their Trades with as many glossings, lies and oaths, almost as words:
or by turning their Trades into Crafts, and Mysteries of Iniquity, getting as
much by Deceit and Injustice, as by fair dealing: or by choking their general
calling by their special, scarce allowing any time to Gods service, etc.

In providing for a man's family, which is lawful and necessary, and he that
does is worse then an Infidel, 1 Timothy 5.8. yet herein many sin by carking
cares: not seeking first the Kingdom of God for themselves and theirs, but
becoming drudges to the world, and to their children, neglecting to bring them
up in the nurture and instruction of the Lord, as they are commanded, Ephesians.
6.4.

In company and society with men, which is sweet and necessary, man being

Quest. What means may we use to prevent our abuse of these lawful things?

Answ. 1. Consider that lawful liberty used to the full extent of it, is
exceeding dangerous, and therefore some restraint is necessary. He that will
take all the liberty he may, will sometimes take that he ought not: and the more
the flesh is pampered, the more the spirit is weakened and foiled.

Romans 11.36. Of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be
glory for ever, 1 Cor. 10.31. Whether ye eat, or drink or whatsoever you do, do
all to the glory of God.

Romans 13.14. In Marriage, meditate much on that sweet contract between Christ
and the soul: and so in the rest. This is an holy Alchimy, that draws Gold out
of Lead, Heaven out of Earth, and Grace out of Nature.

Acts 9.31. For where the Lord affords more outward blessings, and with them,
more time and means to serve him, he looks for the more service from them.

Job, when his sons feasted together, sanctified them, and sac^ificed according
to the number of them, saying, It may be my sons have sinned, etc. Job 1.5. Do
thou the like, mingle not thy joy with sin, lest it end in woe. Dr. Tailor on
the Parable of the Sower, p. 164.

CHAP. II. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about our Actions, Natural,
Civil, Recreative, Religious, etc.
Quest. WHat makes an Action good?

Answ. Every truly commendable and comfortable Action must consist of an
absolute integrity of all concurrents, and requisites. For though some mixture
of infirmities and imperfections will cleave to the face of the fairest action
(an absolute unstained purity being incompatible with mortality) yet every
several Ingredient must be attended, and temper^ with its own particular
goodness, and honesty, and seasonable conformity to the whole, or else the
whole action, though right in other respects, is utterly disrobed of all true
splendour, acceptance, and grace. Here a little leaven ^oures the whole lump:
and the iniquity, defect, and exorbitancy of any one ingredient, denominates
the whole action naught.

Quest. What are the Ingredients requisite to make an Action good?

Answ. 1. It must be good in its own nature, and warranted by Gods Word, by
which all things must be sanctified to us, 1 Timothy 4.5. Otherwise let the person

The Object about which the Action is exercised, must be qualified according to
the Rules of Religion. As works of charity are sweet sacrifices to God: but

We must look to the matter, else all may be marred. As for instance, the
matter of our beneficence must be our own goods got lawfully, else in respect
of

The person must be pleasing to God, else his best deeds are but beautiful
abominations. If the person be not justified by faith, and accepted through
Prove. 15.8, 9. So in the Pharisee, Luke 18.14.

Judas preached and wrought miracles, yet was a desperate hypocrite: See how
the Israelites sought God, and enqui^ed early after him, Psalm. 78.34 etc. yet
because their hearts were not upright God rejected them.

we must not do evil that good may come of it, Romans 3.8.

Mat. 6.5, 6. Meditation of divine things is an excellent duty: but not when
the Preacher is praying, etc.

Jehu did excellent service* by rooting out the idolatrous house of Ahab; and
destroying Baals Priests: yet it was but murder in Gods account, Hosea 1.4.
because he sought himself, and not Gods glory therein. See Boltons General
Directions for a comfortable walking with God, p. 149.

Quest. What things can make a good action to become evil?

Answ. 1. Impenitency in any sin will stain any action, be it in it self never
so good, Isa. 1.13, to 16.

Mat. 6.2, 6.

Heb. 11.6. when we either know not our warrant for it, or believe not Gods
acceptance of it.

Prove. 19.2. when we have not respect to the circum^ances of well-doing: when
good duties are done rudely, etc. whereas we should be wise to do good, Romans
16.19.

Josh. 24.14, 15. when our works are dead works, Hebr. 9.14. Deuteronomy 28.47.



Col. 3.17. Phil. 3.3.



Quest. Can any thing we do be good, when all our righteousnesses are as filthy
rags? Isa. 64.6.

Ans. Our works in themselves are not good, but by Gods indulgence assured unto
us in the New Covenant they are: where God

1. Accepts the will for the deed: we do well, when we desire and endeavor to
do as well as we can.

2. God beholds the work in Christ: and through his intercession passes by the
evil that cleaves to our best actions.

3. God regards it, as proceeding from his own spirit in us, who causes us to
do good, and works our works for us: as in Ptayer, Romans 8.26.

Mr. Byfield on Peter.

CHAP. III. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Adoption.
Quest. HOw many sorts of sons are there?

Answ. Four; 1. There is a son by eternal generation:

2. By Creation; and so Adam, and the Angels are

3. By natural generation; and so Cain was the son of Adam.

4. By Adoption: and so Moses was the son of Pharaohs daughter. And

Quest. How manifold is Adoption?

Answ. Twofold: 1. External, whereby the Lord takes a people by outward
Covenant and Dispensation to be his sons: and thus the Jews were Gods first
Exodus 4.22. and unto them did belong the Adoption, Romans 9.4, 5. and hence their
children were accounted sons, as well as Saints, and holy, 1 Cor. 7.14. Ezekiel.
16.20, 21. but many fall from this Adoption, as the Jews did.

2. Internal, whereby the Lord out of everlasting love to particular persons in
Isaac by special Promise was accounted for the seed, Romans 9.8.

Quest. How manifold is this internal Adoption?

Answ. Twofold: 1. Adoption begun, 1 John 3.1, 2. Now are we the sons of God,
to whom yet the Lord behaves himself for some time, and for some special Gal.
4.1, 2. because some spirits will not be the better for the love of their
Father, but the worse, and therefore he is feign to keep an hard hand over
them. To others he behaves himself with more special respect, enabling them
with more boldness to cry Abba Father, Romans 8.15, 16. who are more easily bent
to his will by love.

Adoption perfected, when we shall receive all the privileges of sons, not one
excepted, Romans 8.23. where we are said to wait for the Adoption, the Redemption
By the first we are sons, but not seen and known to be such, 1 John 3.1, 2. By
the second, we shall be known before all the world to be so.

Quest. What is the manner of Adoption begun here in this world?

Answ. 1. God loves Jesus Christ with an unspeakable love as his only Son, and
our elder brother.



Ephesians. 1.5, 6. His love is not now toward us as to Adam, his Son by Creation:
but in loving his own Son immediately, hence he loves us, adopts us, and
accounts us his children.

Quest. What are the benefits and comforts that flow to us from hence?

Answ. If we are sons, then the Lord prizes and esteems us as sons: yea, the
poorest, weakest, feeblest believer, is more esteemed by God then all the
world, and the glory of it: yea, then all the Kings, and great men in the
world, Isa. 43.4, 5, 6. not because they can deserve it, but because he has
freely made them sons.

Mat. 6.31, 32. and if at any time we fall into want, and straits, the Lord
intends thereby our eternal good: Hence come all Gods corrections, Deuteronomy. 8.5.
Heb. 12.8.

Israel may say, My God has forsaken, and forgotten me, Isa. 49.14. and yet no
mother tenders her child, as the Lord does his children. Yea, he freely those
us to be his sons, and therefore loves us notwithstanding all our sins, Psalm.
89.32, 33. If he see Ephraim bemoaning his stubbornness, as well as his
sickness: as Jer. 31.20. God cries out, Is not he my Son?

heirs, and co-heires with Christ, Romans 8.17. sons by nature are all heirs,
but all sons by Adoption are: We are heirs, First, of the Kingdom of glory, 1
Pet. 1.4, 5. Secondly, of all this visible world, 1 Cor. 3.22. not that we have
it all in our own hand; it would be too cumbersome for us: but we have the use
and comfort of it. Thirdly, we are heirs of the Promise, Heb. 11.9. and 6.17.
whereby the Lord himself comes to be our inheritance and portion for ever.

Romans 8.15, 16. And hereby 1. We shall be enabled to pray to God, who before
could not do it, our mouths being stopped with guilt. 2. To cry Abba, Father,
and this spirit witnesses that we are sons of this Father. 3. Hereby we are
led and guided continually toward our last end: whence it is, that the same
sins which harden others, at last humble us: the same temptations by which
others fall, and perish, serve at last to purify us: Hence our decay in grace,
leads us to growth at last: Hence our fears and doubts serve to establish us
at last: Our wanderings from God for a time, make us esteem more of the Presence
and ways of God at the last. See Shepherds Sound Believer, p. 277.

Mal. 3.17.

Quest. How may we know our Adoption?

Answ. By our resemblance of God, as a natural child is like his natural
father.

Quest. But how may this be known?

Answ. 1. Examine the life of God in thee, who naturally art dead in sin. The
breath of this life is heavenly thoughts, meditations, affections: The Actions
of this life are spiritual growth, and increase in grace and virtue. The
maintenance of this life, is hungring and thirsting after heavenly Manna, and
Water of Life, the Word of God. The very being of it is our union and communion
with God by the Spirit, which is as the soul to the body.

and if thou be his child, thou art a child of light. As thou growest in
understanding thy Fathers Will, so thou growest in his Image, and art like
Christ thy elder brother, and have his Image renewed in knowledge, etc.

See whether thou growest up in holiness and righteousness? whether thy light
shine before men, Mat. 5.16. 2 Cor. 7.1. whether thou cleanse thy self from
all filthiness of flesh and spirit, etc. See Doctor Tailor on Tempt. p. 93.

Quest. What Duties are we taught from the consideration of our Adoption?

Answ. 1. To walk worthy of our Calling; Be not vassals of Sin and Satan:

To come often into our Fathers Presence, doing all as in his sight: seeking
Mal. 1.6.

Strive to resemble Christ, our elder brother, in all virtues, and holy
conversation: John 3.2, 3.

Love Gods Word, that we may grow by it in grace and knowledge: Its the Pet.
2.2.

Expect afflictions and chastisements from our Father, Heb. 12.7, etc.

Quest. What are the means of our Adoption?

Answ. 1. Internal. 2. External.

Quest. What is the internal means?

Answ. Faith in Christ, which has three acts or effects.

1. To believe Christ to be a Savior. 2. To believe him to be my Savior. 3.
To put confidence of heart in him, John 20.29.
Quest. What is the external means of our Adoption?

Answ. Baptism; yet not this alone, but when its joined with faith, Gal. 3.26,
27. and thus it comprehends both outward and inward Baptism, Mat. 3.11. 1 Pet.
3.21.

Quest. What are the marks of the inward Baptism?

Answ. The new birth, whereby a man is washed and cleansed by the Spirit of
God: which has three marks.

1. The Spirit of Grace and Supplication, Zach. 12.10. 2. To hear, and obey the
voice of God in all things, John 8.47. and 10.27. 3. Not to live in the
practice of any sin, 1 John 3.9.
Mr. Perkins on Gal.

Quest. How may the mystery of our Adoption be conceived of?

Answ. A Christian by the Gospel is made a believer. Now faith, after an
unspeakable manner engrafts us into the body of Christ; then being engrafted
into Christ, who is Gods Son, we thereby come to be the Sons of God, and heirs
with Christ. Christ is Gods heir, so are all that are grafted upon him, John.
1.12.

Quest. How may the glory of our Adoption appear to be so great?

Answ. 1. If we consider by whom we are adopted, viz. by God: If it be such an
honor to be heir to a great Prince in the world, what a surpassing glory Romans
8.17. the rather if we respect the excellency of God, who is King of Kings: or
his eternity; he lives for ever, Hos. 1.10. Isa. 9.6. Other fathers that adopt,
may die before they pass the estate.

If we consider the great price that was laid down to make us capable of this
honor to be heirs, viz. the blood of Christ, Gal. 4.4, 5. Heb. 9.14, 15.

If we consider the great things we are heirs to, we shall inherit the earth,
Mat. 5.5. be heirs of the world, Romans 4.13. yea, we shall inherit eternal
life: yea, we are co-heires with Christ, Romans 8.17.



1. They have Christ's spirit in their hearts, called therefore the spirit of
Adoption, Romans 8.15, 16. Gal. 4.6. this drives away all legal terrors, and
testifies to them that they are the adopted sons of God, enables them to pray
with boldness, and to call God Father: leads them into all truth, etc. John
16.13. Isa. 30.21.

2. By the right of their Adoption in Christ, both their persons and works are
accepted with God: so that they are Gods Favorites, what entertainment soever
they have in the world, Ephesians. 1.6.

3. They have an honorable and everlasting name: so that no preferment is like
theirs, Isa. 56.4, 5.

4. They have Gods Angels to attend them, Heb. 1. ult.

5. They may ask whatsoever they will of God, and are sure to have it: yea, he
complains that they will not ask enough, and often enough, John 16.23.

6. When they fall into distress, they have such interest in Gods special
Providence, that an hair of their heads shall not fall to the ground without
it. Besides, God will make himself mavelous in their deliverance, when all
worldly means fail, Isa. 43.18, 19, 20, 21.



1. Hereby we have communion of nature with him by his Incarnation, whereby he
became our brother: yea, we have communion with him in his divine nature, 2
Pet. 1.4.

2. We have communion of state with him, which the Scripture calls a great
mystery: for so we are said to live with him, to die with him, to suffer with
him, to be buried with him: yea, to rise and ascend with him, and to sit with
him, Ephesians. 2.6. only preserving the difference between the head and the members
in all this.

3. We have communion of offices with him: For he has made us Kings, and
Priests with him, Rev. 1.5, 6. 1 Pet. 2.9.

4. We have communion in benefits with him: For God our Father has blessed us
in him with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things, Ephesians. 1.3. Communion we
have with him in grace in this life, and in glory in the life to come.



1. We have an Act for it in Gods eternal counsel, Ephesians. 1.5. we are
predestined to Adoption.

2. Yea, we have Gods oath for it, that by these two immutable things the
heirs of Promise might have abundant consolation, Heb. 6.17, 18.

3. God has put his Spirit into us as the seal and earnest of our inheritance,
Ephesians. 1.13, 14.

Quest. What kind of persons must we be to attain to this Adoption?

Answ. 1. We must have a true justifying faith, John 1.12. as we said before.

Romans 8.13. For none can inherit, but such as overcome their corruptions, Rev.
21.7.

Cor. 6.17, 18.

We must make conscience of sanctifying the Sabbath, and choosing the Isa.
56.4, 5, 6.

Quest. What are the marks whereby we may know our selves to be the adopted
children of God?

Answ. Such are made like unto God their father in holiness, in some Pet.
1.15. and this they show two ways.

1. By purifying themselves, and sound humiliation for their sins that defaced
Gods Image in them, 1 John 3.2, 3. 2. By employing themselves constantly in
doing righteousness. Hereby they are known from the children of the devil, 1
John 3.10.
Such love the brethren as their fellow-heires, 1 John 3.14.

Such have the spirit of prayer, Romans 8.15, 16.

Such serve God, not out of a slavish fear, but with a filial affection, Isa.

Such will love them that hate them, and bless them that curse them, Luke 6.35.
Mat. 5.44.

Quest. How must the adopted sons of God carry themselves in this life?

Answ. They must be Peacemakers, Mat. 5.9. their Father is the God

They must not revile such as revile them, but rather bless them, seeing they
Pet. 3.9.

They must live without carfulness, knowing that they have a heavenly Father
Mat. 6.32. and being heirs of a better, they must not set their hearts upon
this world, 1 John 2.15.

They must willingly submit to their Fathers corrections, Heb. 12.9.

Mr. Byfield on Peter.

Quest. What may we do that we may attain the spirit of Adoption, and keep the
lively sense and feeling of it in our souls?

Answ. We must diligently attend upon the Ministry of the Word, 2 Cor. Ministry
of the Spirit, because by it God offers and communicates his Spirit, Gal. 3.2.

We must beg this spirit of Adoption of God, Luke 11.13.

We must open the doors of our hearts that the Spirit may enter, Psalm. 24.7.
Rev. 3, 20. that is, we must call off our minds from earthly things, and we
must raise them up to attend to the motions of the Spirit.

Quest. What are the Signs that we have the Spirit of Adoption?

Answ. If we have the Spirit of Prayer, whereby we can call God, Father, Zach.
12.10. Romans 8.15, 26. Gal. 4.6.

If we have an high esteem of that dignity which is in Adoption, John 1.12.
John 3.1.

If we reverence and honor God as our Father, Mal. 1.6. 1 Pet. 1.17.

If we yield child-like obedience to him, 1 Pet. 1.14. Romans 8.14.

If we are made conformable to the Image of God our Father, and Christ our Mat.
5.48. Romans 8.29 1 John 3.9.

If we have a lively hope of our future inheritance, Romans 8.17.

Quest. How may we preserve the witness of the Spirit of Adoption in us?

Answ. If we do not extinguish it by contempt of the means of grace, These.
5.19, 20.

If we do not grieve the Spirit by the filthiness of sin, Ephesians. 4.30.

If we stir it up by our honest endeavors.

CHAP. IV. Questions, and Cases about Adoration or Worship.
Quest. WHat is Adoration?

Answ. Its the part of Gods Worship, whereby a man, upon a vile and base esteem
of himself, as being but dust and ashes, submits, and subjects his soul to the
Majesty and Glory of God.

Quest. What are the principal Grounds in the heart?

Answ. Two. 1. Abnegation, or denial of our selves, when we esteem our

Exaltation, or advancement of Gods Majesty, above all things in the world.
Genesis 18.27. Isa. 6.2. Dan. 9.7. Man. 15.27.

Quest. How manifold is Adoration?

Answ. Twofold, Religious, or Civil.

Quest. What is religious Adoration?

Answ. Its the Worship of God, in which Religion and Godliness is exercised,
expressed, and signified.

Quest. What is to be considered herein?

Answ. The inward intention of the mind, wherein God is conceived

The outward prostrating of the body, as bowing the knee, lifting up the hands,
etc. to testify our subjection unto God as our absolute Lord.

Quest. What is Civil Adoration?

Answ. It belongs to the Second Table, and is termed Sociall, because its the
Adoration, or Worship that fellow creatures give one to another.

Quest. What is to be considered herein?

Answ. The inward intention of the mind, which must be this: that the creature
worshipped is endued with excellent gifts by God, or that he has Power

The Action, or outward gesture of the body, in token that the creature
worshipped is endued with excellent gifts, and graced with authority over us.
So

Quest. To what things is Adoration due, and in what manner?

Answ. The things are of three sorts, 1. God the Creator. 2. The creatures. 3.
The works of the creatures.

Quest. What Adoration is due to God?

Answ. It must not be Sociall, (for we are not Gods companions,) but Religious,
which is due to him, and to him alone, Mat. 4.10.

Quest. What Caveats are to be remembered herein?

Answ. If Adoration be given to god with a false and erroneous intention, it
makes him an Idol. As if our bodies be bowed to worship God out of the Trinity,
as the Turks do: or if he be worshipped out of the Son, as the Jews do, we
worship not the true God, but an Idol. For God must be so conceived of us, as
he has manifested himself in his Word, and not otherwise.



Quest. Why so?

Answ. Because he that so worships him, binds his presence, operation and grace
to those places, to which God never bound himself, nor his Presence, etc.



God expressly forbids the Worship of his Majesty, in, at, or before any
creature Deuteronomy. 4.16, 17, 18, 19.

Obj^ct. But I intend not to worship the Image, but God in the Image?

Answ. It matters not what thy meaning is, seeing God detests that manner of
Worship; the Israelites worshipped not the Calfe, but God in the Calfe, Exodus
32.8. yet they are said to worship an Idol.

Obj. God was worshipped before the Ark, and there he promised to hear the
prayers of his people?

Answ. They had an express Command from God to worship before the Ark, and a
Promise that they should be accepted and heard, which the Idolater has not.

Obj. Subjects kneel before the Chair of State, though the King be absent, in
token of their subjection due to him, therefore much more may we to the Images
of God, and the Saints in Heaven?

Answ. Kneeling before the Chair of State is a mere Civil Worship, only to
show our subjection to our lawful Sovereign, and so is commanded by God: but we
have no such warrant to bow to Images: neither is it Gods Will, that they
should be Tokens of his Presence.

Quest. What Virtues are required in religious Adoration?

Answ. Fear, which is a great part of Gods Worship, Isa. 29.13. with Mat.
15.8, 9. where fear and worship a^e taken for one and the same.

Inward obedience of the hidden man of the heart: which is preferred before
sacrifice, 1 Samuel 15.22. and this stands in two things.

1. In yielding subjection of the Conscience to the Commands, Threats, and
Promises of God, so that we are willing to be bound by them. 2. When the rest
of the powers of the soul, in their place and time, perform obedience to God, 2
Cor. 10.5.
Psalm. 37.7. and 39.9. 2 Samuel 15.26.



1. In acknowledging that our selves and whatsoever we have is Gods, and
proceeds from his blessing alone. 2. In consecrating our bodies, souls,
callings, labors, and our lives to the honor and service of God*
Quest. What Adoration is due to the creatures?

Answ. The creatures are either, 1. Evil spirits. 2. Good Angels. 3. Living
men. 4. Saints departed.

Quest. Is any Adoration due to the evil spirits?

Answ. No: for they are Gods enemies, and accursed of him, therefore no honor
is due to them: neither are we to have any dealing with them at all, but
utterlie to renounce whatsoever comes from them, or their instruments, as
Spells Charms, Enchantments, etc. which serve to work wonders, but have no
such virtue from God, either by Creation, Nature, Word, or Institution.

Quest. What Adoration is due to the good Angels?

Answ. If they did appear to us, and we certainly knew them, we might adore
them, but only with a civil and sociall worship. So Genesis 19.1. they refuse
Religious worship, Rev. 19.10.

Quest. What Adoration is due to men?

Answ. That which is merely civil, and that in respect of the gifts of God that
we see in them, as also of the authority, and place they have amongst us.
Enjoined in the fifth Commandment. So we see in Abraham, G^n. 23.7. which
Adoration must be according to the laudable custom of the Country where we
live.

Quest. May not religious, or mixed Adoration be given to them?

Answ. By no means. Peter blamed Cornelius for it, Acts 10.25, 26. Mordecai
refused to give it to Haman, Esther 3.2. Kissing the Popes toe is therefore
unlawful, because its a Civil worship, mixed with Religious; tendered to him as
to Christ's Vicar, and is not done to any Potentate on the earth.

Quest. What Adoration is due to the Saints departed?

Answ. All the worship that we owe them, is no more but a reverend esteem of
their persons, and imitation of their virtues: No religious worship is due to
them, they having nothing to do with us, nor we with them.

Quest. Does any Adoration belong to the unreasonable creatures?

Answ. No, there belongs nothing to them, but a reverend and holy use of them.
For Adoration is a sign of subjection in the Inferior to the Superior: but
Man is their Superior, and therefore is not to worship them: therefore not the
relics of Saints, or the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament.

Quest. Is any Adoration due to the works of the Creatures, viz. Images?

Answ. None at all: For

1. Its expressly forbidden in the Second Commandment.

2. The Superior must perform no Adoration to the Inferior: Now man is a more
excellent Image of God then any other Image, and therefore better then it: yea,
the meanest worm which is Gods Workmanship, is better then any Image made by
man: therefore we may better worship a worm, then an Image.

Mr. Perkins, Vol. 2. p. 84, etc.

CHAP. V. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Adultery.
Quest. WHat is Adultery?

Answ. It is uncleanness about the Act of generation between a man and a
woman, whereof one at the least is married, or betrothed to another.

Quest. Whether, when the husband or wife commits Adultery, the bond of
Marriage is thereby dissolved?

Answ. No: neither may the nocent, nor innocent party put the other away, but
still they remain man and wife, till the cause be fairly heard by a lawful
Magistrate, and by him judged and determined, which is proved.

1. Because the Scripture still calls them man and wife: Abraham was still
Sarahs husband after he had committed Adultery by lying with Hagar. So of
David, etc.

2. Though Christ has allowed it to the innocent party, that he or she may
commence that action, and being judged, put the other away: yet no where has
he commanded it, that before judgment, he should put her away, which, if she
had ceased to be his wife, he would have done, Matthew. 19.9.

3. Only he that joined them can separate them, and make them not man and wife,
which is God only. Indeed, Jerome reports of Fabiola, that without the judgment
of the Church, or Magistrate, she put away her husband, who was a very vicious,
and an adulterous man: But though he write not the rest, yet others say, that
she was made to do public penance: not that she made a divorce, but because
she did it of her self without the judgment of the Church.

4. As private and clandestine marriages are not allowed by reason of manifold
inconveniences; So privy and secret divorces are not allowable, because it
would prove prejudicial to the good of many.

5. They are man and wife, till a just cause be justly known to the contrary,
but that cannot be in private, but before a competent Judge: God allowing none
to be accounted Adulterers, but such as are lawfully convicted of it before a
lawful Magistrate; for by no right can a man be both Party and Judge.

6. If Adultery be not known to the innocent, then they are still man and wife,
though there be great presumption of it: why not then if known? Knowledge, or
not knowledge breaks the bond never the more, unless it be proved, judged and
determined.

7. Divorce is a punishment for a fault committed; now none may punish it but a
lawful Judge. See Stock on Mal. c. 2. p. 118.

Quest. How may married persons prevent, and withstand temptations to Adultery?

Answ. Consider that the Adulterer makes himself the member of an harlot, which
will lie heavy upon the conscience when time serves, that in sinning this sin,
the body is thus made the member of a Strumpet.

Solomon the wise to run into idolatry against common sense: and Sampson the
strong, though he knew the harlot would betray him, could not forbear.

It will damn men in hell except they repent, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. No Adulterer
shall enter into the Kingdom of God. So 2 Pet. 2.9, 10.

Original lust unto it, and Satan is more eager to draw us to it.

Prove. 5.19, 20.

Prove. 22.14. Eccl. 7.26.

Cor. 7.5. There must be quenching, not provoking of lust: Raging lust is a
great enemy to love, and will not be content with one. Married persons must
avoid also,

1. Words, and talk full of obscenity* they must not by words corrupt one
another chastity, which is worse then corrupting the chastity of a stranger.

What if no body be by, yet God is by.

2. Their eyes must be pure and chaste, else it will follow, that their eyes
will be full of Adultery, 2 Pet. 2.14. Adam and Eve made coverings to hide
their nakedness each from other. Modesty is the best Preserver of Nuptial
chastity Love does no unsightly or unseemly thing.

3. The bed must be sanctified and kept undefiled by the Word and Prayer: The
Word is a mighty healer of corruptions, to which we must join Prayer, or else
we rely too much on the Physic. Prayer will keep us that we shall not surfeit,
and so come to a loathing: Nor fall into a defect: There must be a satisfying
and drinking away of our thirst at our own Cisterne, Prove. 5.19. least we
hanker after a strange fountain. Prayer will keep us from base and abusive
dalliances. It will keep the bed undefiled, and increase love, and mutual
affection. See Capell on Temptations p. 386.

These. 4.3. This is the Will of God, that ye should abstain from fornication,
and every one possess his vessel in holiness, etc.

Remember how the Lord interposeth, and challenges the Covenant between
forsakes the guide of her youth, forgets the Covenant of her God, Prove.
2.17. yea, he professes that he narrowly watches, and clearly sees when this
Covenant is broken. For Prove. 5.15, 17, 20, 21. this is made the reason of the
Precept: The ways of men are before the eyes of the Lord, though no other eye
sees it.

Remember, the Lord watches sinners of this kind to destroy both their souls
Pro. 5.22. He destroys his own soul: He shall be shut out of the heavenly
Jerusalem, Rev. 22.15. and by Gods Law the Adulterer and Adulteress should
die, because he would not have the land defiled: nor the guilty person live to
be an eyesore to the innocent. Its worse then theft, Prove. 6.30.31.

Consider further the odiousness of this sin.

1. It directly corrupts the fountain of honest, civil, and godly life, which
is the inviolable preservation of Gods Ordinance of Marriage.

2. Its infamous for the Church to be accounted an Assembly of harlots,

3. It brings confusion in the Commonwealth to have a bastardly brood
inheriting.

4. Its an injury to families to bring in unlawful and usurping heirs.

5. All other sins are without the body: this is against the body, 1 Corinthians.
6.18.

6. Whereas all other sins may be committed by one party, this winds in two
into the sin: So that if one party repent, the other may not, which will be a
great burden to the Penitent whilst he lives.

7. Its an high sin against the price of Christ's blood, wherewith their bodies
were bought to be members of Christ, that by this sin are made members of an
harlot.

8. The curse of God follows this sin: 1. In the soul of the sinner, Hebr.
13.4. Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge. 2. In his body, Prove. 5.11.
He shall mourn, having consumed his flesh and his body. 3. In his Name Prove.
5.9. which precious thing is irrecoverably lost. 4. In his estate, It brings
him to a morsel of bread. Pro. 6.26. Its a fire that consumes all his
substance, Job 31.12. As we see in the Prodigal. 5. In his bastard-brood: we
never read of any that came to good besides Jephthah.

Quest. By what means may we preserve our chastity?

Answ. Get a pure heart, because out of it issue Adulteries, Mat. 15.19. Let
thy soul become a pure Spouse of Christ, love him, and cleave to him, this

Preserve in thy soul the fear of God, Eccl. 7.26. He that is good before God
shall be preserved, Prove. 2.10, 16. Consider Gods Presence, who sees thee.

Get an hearty love to thy wife, Prove. 5.19, 20.

Avoid occasions of wantonness; As 1. Idleness: one of Sodoms sins: standing
they are mockers. Avoid intemperance in sleep and apparel: Let thy diet be
sober, and sleep moderate. 3. Avoid the company and sight of persons, that may
become snares: as Joseph avoided his Mystresses presence: Death often enters by
the windows of the eyes: Beware of amarous books, pictures, speeches, etc. 5.
Use all good means appointed by God for this purpose; As first, resist lustful
thoughts at first, and exercise thy mind in holy thoughts. Secondly, consider
thy calling of a Christian, and remember that thereby thou art called to
holiness. 3. That the pleasure of sin is short, but the gnawing of a guilty
conscience durable. 4. Apply the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God against
it, which is a sharp two-edged sword, etc. 5. Fly to God by prayer; make thy
case known to him, and crave his assistance. See Dr. Tailor on Titus p. 386.

CHAP. VI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Affections, or Passions.
Quest. HOw many sorts or kinds of Affections be there?

Answ. Two. 1. Sensual. 2. Intellectual, or Rational.

Quest. What are sensual Affections?

Answ. They are such as belong to the sensual appetite: are sented in the body
for the instruments of them; and are suited to the body for the objects and
ends of them, and are guided by the phancie, and are common with us to beasts:
The objects of them are sensible things, as meats, drinks, marriage,
recreations, etc. A natural or bodily good to be obtained, or evil to be
avoided.

Quest. How may it appear that these sensitive Affections are not to be
abandoned, but only moderated according to the Rules of Reason and Faith?

Answ. 1. Because virtue never ruins that which is wholly conformable to
Reason: As its Reasonable to see a man moved with pity and compassion toward

To apprehend evil, to fear punishments, to attend recompenses with Joy, to
long after Promises, are they not encouragements to Piety, Temperance,

The Passions of our souls are the objects of many excellent virtues, which do
moderate them, and reduce them to Reason when they seek to fly out: As

4. The sensitive appetite is a gift freely bestowed upon us by God, but virtue
never destroys nature* but adds to it the perfections which it wants. It must



Quest. What are the Rational Affections?

Answ. They are such as appertain to the Will, of which they are immediate
acts, directed by the Understanding.

Quest. How may it be proved that there are Affections in the highest and
chiefest part of the soul?

Answ. 1. Because the Scriptures ascribe to God love, hatred, anger, zeal, etc.
who cannot be subject to any sensitive aberrations, and therefore as in him
they are perfections, we are commanded to imitate him in them: so there is no
reason why they should be denied to us in such sort as they be perfect, and
that is principally in the Intellectual power of the soul.





Quest. How may it be proved that these Rational Affections are motions of the
Will?

Answ. Because they are conversant about spiritual, celestial, yea, eternal
objects: as of God, Christ, Heaven, etc. Col. 3.2. of which the sensitive
appetite is incapable.

They remain in the soul when its separated from the body: the Saints carry

Luke 15.10. and desire to look into Gospel-mysteries, 1 Pet. 1.12. and the
devils fear and tremble, Jam. 2.19.

Paul makes the Will the seat of the Affections, and joins them together, 1
These. 2.8. being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have
imparted to you, not the Gospel only, but our own soul.

Quest. Are these rational Affections so elevated above the body, as that they
have nothing to do with it? no, not whilst the soul is in the body?

Answ. Yea, though they are originally and radically in the Will, yet the Will
stirs up the sensual Affections, and they stir the humors and patts of the
body, especially the spirits and the blood, and so make the whole man to
suffer, both body and soul. Hence they are called Passions: As Fear chills the
blood: Anger boiles it; Grief contracts and closes up the Heart: Joy dilates
it, etc.

Quest. Why must our Affections be carefully looked to, and ordered by Gods
Word?

Answ. The first sort of reasons may be taken from the effects of disordered
passions: As,

1. Because Passions when unruly, blind Judgment and Reason: Passions are

Passions seduce the Will: because the Understanding being the eye and director

Passions mightily change the quiet temper, and disposition of the mind:

1. Passions rebel against Reason, and undermine the Understandings of men to
their great molestation: For no sooner does the Mind ascend Heavenward by
Meditation, but inordinate Passions hale it back, and draw it down to the earth.

2. One passion fights with another, as fear opposes Anger, Covetousness,
Prodigality, and on a sudden men fall from one extreme to another, as from
great ^oy to great grief.

3. Passion is unsatiable, Covetousness increases as riches increase.

4. Inordinate Passions either prevent Reason, or are stirred up by a corrupt
judgment, and therefore neither observe time nor place; but upon every
occasion would be leaping into action, importuning execution: yea, sometimes
many greedy passions crowd in altogether, every one being more earnest then
other to be satisfied: so that to content them all, is impossible; to content
none is intolerable: to prosecute one, and abandon the rest, is to carry so
many hungry vipers continually gnawing upon our souls.

5. There are none that follow the streams of their Passions, but expect and
believe at last to get full rest and content to their appetites, which yet in
the event is altogether impossible: for they keep neither sense, order, nor
measure.

6. Inordinate passion it self is an extreme tortute and vexation; God having
so ordained that they which will give way to them, should feel the burden of
them: Thus anger, envy, pride, etc. more disquiet them that entertain them,
then they can hurt any other man.

Rashness, Inconstancy, Craftiness, are the companions of inordinate
Passions.

Inordinate passions are hurtful to the body, impair health, breed humors,

Secondly, the second sort of Reasons, to show that Affections should be
rightly ordered are taken from the consideration of the profit, and benefit of
well-guided affections. For, 1. They rather serve as instruments of virtue,
then foment vice: and as an occasion of victory, then a cause of foil. Christ,
in whom were no inordinate affections, had his soul heavy even unto death, Mat.
26.38.

2. The Scriptures exhort us to love, fear, joy, etc. therefore it were
blasphemous to say that these Passions are absolutely evil.

3. If the motions of our Wills be virtuous, being guided by Gods Word and
Prudence, if then the Passions concur with the Will, virtuous actions are
performed with much more ease and delight.

Quest. How may we know to what Passions our souls are most inclined?

Answ. By our company that we most delight in: Like affects like; meetings
and manners for the most part sympathize together.









Quest. By what degrees are the affections wrought on?

Answ. By nine degrees: In the five first, a carnal man may have his affections
wrought on, and in the last four of them he cannot. As,

Corinth wrought on the Affections of the Hearers that they flockt after them.
Paul durst not so preach, 1 Cor. 2.4.

When the Affections are so wrought on, that the heart is somewhat touched
Israelites to Saul, 1 Samuel 10.26. As a Needle touched with a Loadstone, turns
it self to the North: So a wicked man's Affections may be touched by the Word.

When Affections are so wrought on, that the heart is somewhat bowed thereby:
David bowed the hearts of the men of Judah, as of one man, 2 Samuel 19.14.

Absalom stole away the hearts of all Israel, 2 Samuel 15.6.

i. e. whilst he was in a Passion, Deuteronomy. 19.6. So Saul had a great zeal to
Gods Church, 2 Samuel 21.2. Jehu was zealous for God, 2 Kings 10.16.

Lam. 1.20. Behold, (Oh Lord) for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled, my
heart is turned within me, etc. viz. with grief for their sins.

Jer. 30.21. Who is he that engages his heart to approach unto me?

David's, Psalm 119.31. I have stuck unto thy Testimonies.

that it affects. Thus Solomon gave his heart to seek wisdom, Eccl. 1.13. No
wicked man can have his affections thus wrought on, yet his affections may be
raised a good way toward Christ. For,

1. By the sparks of right Reason, naturally implanted by God in the heart, he
may so regulate his affections that he may be chaste, sober, kind, liberal,
just, patient, etc. and to observe the things contained in the Law.

2. Their knowledge by the Word may raise up their affections exceedingly:
Knowledge may awe the heart with fear that it go not against its own
knowledge: Herod feared, Mark 6.20. and did many things.

3. God may quicken their knowledge and conscience, and tell them the horror
of their sins, which may raise up their affections many steps higher, to mourn
and be sorry for their sins: As in Ahab, 1 Kings 21.27. He rent his clothes,
fasted, and went softly.

4. They may have a deep sense and horror for their estate: they may be afraid
to be damned, and of Gods judgments, which may make them weep, and sigh, and
groan. So Mal. 2.13. They covered the Altar of God with tears, with weeping,
and crying out; and yet were hypocrites.

5. Self-love may wind up their affections yet higher: For when a man knows
that he cannot be saved unless he does thus and thus; Oh how affectionate may
he be to do it that he may be saved. For, 1. He may be loath to commit sin: He
may wish affectionately to leave it. He may use some means to leave it. As
Darius did to have deliveted Daniel from the Lions Den, Dan. 6.14. and Pilate
to deliver Christ. 2. He may vomit up his dear sins, and be sorry that other
men should commit them. So Micha confessed the silver that he had stolen, and
proffered to make restitution, and was troubled when he heard his Mother curse
and swear, Judge. 17.2. Joab was vexed when David would number the people, 1 Chronicles. 21.3. 3. He may be so set against sin, that money, favor, honors, etc.
may not prevail with him to commit it, as in Balaam, Numb. 24.13. 4. He may be
forward in Religion, and so strict in his ways, that he may be persecuted for
the truth-sake, and for Christ's sake, and may endure persecution a good while.
5. He may be ravished and enamoured with the joys of the Spirit. He may be in
some ecstasies of spiritual joy, Heb. 6.5. He may taste the good Word of God,
and Powers of the world to come.


Quest. Why may wicked men's Affections be so far wrought on, and yet come
short?

Answ. Because they are not kindly wrought on: the Galatians affections were
Paul, but they were not kindly wrought on. Its only the love of God shed abroad
in the heart that kindly affects us.

They are not judiciously wrought on: they are wrought on in a fit, but not

They are not wrought on regularly: He is affected with fear; but its with
Hos. 3.5. the true Israel of God are there said to fear the Lord and his
goodness.

They are not wrought on universally: Some affections are wrought on, but

Quest. How then shall we know whether we are rightly affected toward Chrict
or no?

Answ. He that is truly affected with Christ, grace, etc. affects nothing so

Psalm. 39.3.

Came. 5.8. Tell him I am sick of love.

Psalm. 33.1. as in the Fountain of all grace.

Quest. But why should we be so careful to have our Affections set right?

Answ. Hereby only we are in a capacity of being married to Christ, who will
have our Affections before he will marry us. When a man goes a wooing for a
wife, his care is to get her Affections. He will never marry her, if he be
wise, except he may have her affections. So if our affections be to the world,
or the Strumpet-like things of the world, Christ cannot abide us: Know ye not
that the love of the world is enmity with God, James 4.4. Therefore the Apostle
commands us to mortify inordinate Affections, Col. 3.5.

Hadad was in favor with Pharaoh, he married his wives Sister to him, 1 Kings
11.19. So if thou favourest the things of the world, thou weddest thy soul to
them; and what an infinite indignity is this to Christ, when such base and
sordid things should have those affections which belong to him?

without natural affections, implacable, Romans 1.31. what a care then should we
have of our affections, because thereby we are reconcilable to God?

Psalm. 24.4. He that has clean hands, and a pure heart: i. e. He whose
affections a^e clean, and heart pure: Psalm. 26.6. I will wash my hands in
innocence, etc. i. e. I will purge mine affections, and so pray, 1 Timothy 2.8.
Lifting up pure hands, i. e. holy affections without wrath, etc. Now what a sad
thing is it that these hands should be put out of joint? As long as our
affections are out of order, and set upon things below, we can never take hold
of grace, or Christ. When the devil takes a man Prisoner, he binds him hand
and foot: He binds up his heart and affections that he cannot weep, nor repent
of his sins: He cannot rejoice in grace nor goodness: He cannot delight in the
Word, etc. Above all things therefore be sure that thy hands be loose, and
thine affections at liberty to be set on heaven.

They are also the handles of the soul: As we can take hold of nothing that is

Affections are the souls stomach: that which the soul affects, it fills and
Pet. 2.2. Let us therefore ^et our affections upon the things which are above,
which is the wholesome food of the soul.

Affections are the materials of grace: the main work of grace is the ruling of
Gratia non tollit sed attollit naturam: It takes not away nature, but lifts it
up. Therefore Saint Paul calls our affections members, Romans 6.19. Because by
them grace works.

Affections are arguments what we are: As our affections are, so are our
souls. The goodness or vainness of our affections show that we are godly,
Affectus virum indicat. Our affections, show what we are.

Quest. How may it be proved that affections in themselves are not sinful?

Answ. Because Adam and Eve had affections in innocence, who were created
without sin.

Christ took our affections upon him, which if they were sinful he could not
have done. He rejoiced, Luke 10.21. He sorrowed, Mat. 26.38. He Mar. 3.5. He
desired, Luke 22.15.

God commands us to be angry, Ephesians. 4.26. and to mourn, Joel 2.12. to fear,
Luke 12.5. to be ashamed, Jer. 3.3. which if they were sinful in

1. Had we no affections, we should be like stocks and senseless stones; as is
implied, Lam. 1.12. q. d. Are you such blocks that ye are not at all affected
with my sorrows, therefore its reckoned as a symptom of a desperately
hardened heart, not to be affected with any thing.

2. Were it not for affections nature would be idle and lazy: For they are as
wind to the sails of a ship, as wheels to a Chariot: Hence Psalm. 119.32. I
will run the way of thy Commandments, when thou shall enlarge my heart, i. e.
my affections. Though a man's reason tells him, that he is bound to repent, to
be godly, to obey, etc. yet if he has no affections thereto, he cannot move
toward them. Hence Cant. 1.4. Draw me, viz. by the affections of love, and I
will run after thee. Affections are whetstones to good. Have thou love? Its a
whetstone to obedience. Have thou grief? Its a whetstone to repentance. Have
thou anger? Its a whetstone to zeal, etc.

3. Affections are good channels for grace to run in. Art thou covetous and
full of desires? Its easier for thee to covet the better things. Art thou
choleric? Its a fit channel for thy zeal for Gods glory to run in. Art thou
melancholy? Its a fit channel for repentance to run in. Art thou fearful? Its a
fit channel for the fear of God and his judgments to run in, etc. Jeremy was
of a sad constitution, and see what advantage he made of it. Jer. 9.1. Oh that
my head were waters, etc.

Quest. How are unmortified Passions to be subdued?

Answ. To bridle unlawful pleasures its good to accustom our selves to abstain
from lawful: He shall not fall in things unlawful, that warily restrains
himself sometimes in things lawful. As if a man be given to drunkenness, he
shall the easilier overcome it, if he abstain from strong drink when he might
use it. If a man be prone to pride, its best for him not to go so fine as he
might do. He that takes his liberty in all things that are lawful, will quickly
be a slave to his lusts. Hence 1 Cor. 6.12. All things are lawful, but all
things ^re not expedient, etc.

Nazarite: to prevent drunkenness must drink no Wine, nor eat Grapes or
Raisins, lest thereby they should be tempted to drink Wine, Numb. 6.1. etc.

Joseph's chastity: Jobs patience: Abraham's faith, etc.

Principiis obsta, etc. Cure the wound whilst its green: Take Physic before
the disease be rooted. As he that will be rid of an ill guest, the worser that
he entertaines him, the sooner he will be gone.

Cor. 9.27. I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, etc. He that
would quell his passions whilst he pampers his body, is like him who would
quench a fire by adding more fuel to it.







Quest. How may affections be divided?

Answ. Into two kinds. First, some embrace their Object, as Love, Joy,

Secondly, others shun and decline them, as Hatred, Fear, etc.

Wherein consists the sanctified exercise of those affections that embrace, or
prosecute their Object.

Answ. In this, that they move to all good soundly, orderly, in fit season,

Quest. What Reasons may move us to affect that that is good?

Answ. By the Law of nature imprinted in our hearts, like a Lanthorn to

Quest. Is it not mercenary to yield obedience to God upon hope of reward?

Answ. No: for if the Lord use such means and motives to quicken us in Heavens
way, its not mercenary but lawful to make use of them for that end, So John
3.16, 18. Romans 2.7. Heb. 11.26.

Quest. Wherein stands the sanctified exercise of those affections that fly
from their object?

Answ. In that they shun all evil soundly, orderly, and constantly, according
to the direction of Gods Word.

Quest. What Reasons may induce us to shun that which is evil?

Answ. The remorse and pangs of conscience in the very act of sinning, may

is the wages of sin.



All creatures made by God for our use, exclaim against a vicious life: the



Quest. But is it not servile to foregoe sin for fear of punishment?

Answ. The Scripture commands the godly to fear him that is able to cast both
soul and body into hell, Mat. 10.^8. Heb. 4.1. and 2.3. and 10.26. Fear of
eternal wrath, as it makes men avoid sin, may well stand with confident
assurance of eternal happiness, and final perseverance.

Quest. May the state of our soul be discerned by our affections?

Answ. Yea: we may know our estate to be good, by our embracing of good things,
by our joy and delight in them, and by our wonderment at them: As, Oh, how I
love thy Law! Psalm. 119.97. One day in thy Courts, is better th^n a thousand
elsewher^, Psalm. 84.10. Oh the depth of his Mercy, Romans 11.33. One thing have I
desired of the Lord, and I will desire it, etc. Psalm. 27.4. when the soul
stands in admiration of God and good things; ready to welcome Christ and
heavenly things, and in comparison thereof to count all but dung, etc. A man is
then in a good estate, when hearing of the excellency of heavenly things, he is
exceedingly affected therewith, and gives them a room in his heart.



Quest* How happens it then, that Gods children sometimes, even when their
judgments are convinced, yet find their affections so flat, crying out: Alas!
that I should believe such happiness as heaven, such glory, and yet should
have my affections no more stirred in me? Can I be a child of God?

Answ. Sometimes the Judgment may be convinced, and yet the affections

1. Because there may be some division at the same time, as some present
cross, or some present thing lawfully loved that may take up our affections at
that time.

Gods children are sometimes deceived in judging of their affections, but when
opposition comes, then they are discovered: As for want of stirring up the
grace

This is a certain rule, that a man's affections are as his persuasion is, and
his perwasions as his ^ight is. As he has a heavenly light, discovering
heavenly things, so is his persuasion of a better state then the world can
yield: and answerable to his persuasion so is his soul raised up to delight in
the best things.

Quest. What rules are to be observed for the better government of our
affections.

Answ. They must be guided by the word of God: If they have not this rule to
guide them, they will wander out of the right way: These are good Servants but
bad Masters. They must not run till Reason bid them go. They are the feet of
the soul, now the eye must guide the foot or else it will go it knows not
whither. Hereby affections are directed to right Objects, to love what should
be loved, and to hate what should be hated: as Christ directs. Luke 12.3, 4, 5.
and so Col. 3.2. 1. Pet. 2.2. 1. John. 2.15. Affections misplaced are like
members out of joint which will one day cause pain.

Moderate affections, and keep them with in due bounds. Proportion them to
their objects in measure more or less according to the kind and degree of
good, or evil wherein they are to be ruled by judgment. Grieve for the
greatest evils most wherein God is dishonored, grieve for afflictions less
which are less-evills. So for joy; Luk 10.20. Psa. 41. and 16.3.

Quest. Why should the affections be thus kept within their bounds.

Answ. Because whilst affections are kept within bounds, they are kept in
order, every affection keeps his place, like soldiers in their ranks: but when
they break their bounds, they break their bancks like a swelling water.

Whilst they are kept within bounds they are kept in use, ate helpful one to
another, and obedient to reason, otherwise they hurt and devour one another;
as excessive grief devoures joy. etc when they exceed they make themselves
unuseful, and the man in whom they are, unfit either for the service of God, or
man. yea they captivate reason, and draw us to do things both contrary to
judgment and conscience.

Whilst they are kept within bounds they are kept in credit and esteem: but
Cant. 5.8.2. Cor. 5.13.14 Exodus, 32.19.

Quest. How may these immoderate affections be prevented? or cured?

Answ. Forsee by prudence such things before they come which may prove great
Provocations to our selves of joy, Grief, Anger, Fear, etc. and set bounds to
them in our resolutions before hand how much we will be affected with them when
they com to pass, and noe more.

Set up a Master affection in your hearts to rule all the rest, and keep them
in awe, in order, and in measure, and let that be the holy fear of God* that
your hearts may not dare to love any Creature overmuch, nor to grieve for any
worldly loss too much. etc. and that because you fear God, who will reward and
punish your affections as well as actions.

Phisicians open a vein to divert the course of blood! As when you are angry
overmuch at persons, or things, turn it against sin etc.



3. Rule.
Command affections so as to have them at your beck to make them come and go
when you bid them. For Prove 16.32. He is better than he that takes a City.
Contrarily Pro. 25.18. Hence 1 Cor* 7, 30.31. Psa. 131.2.

To this end pray to God for stren^th: For to command our affections requires
power as well as Skill. Ephesians. 3.10. Psa: 38.2. The weaker the person is in his
understanding and parts, the stronger are his passions: and as Persons grow
weak, their passions grow strong: the mind may out-reason affections, but
strength must over-master them.



1 From mixtures of the flesh: as of spiritual, and carnal together: Hence, 1
Pet. 1.22. see that ye love one another with a pure heart etc.

2 Purge them from mixtures of self, as the people followed Christ, not for
himself but for the loaves.

3 From mixtures of deceit: as of abundance of show of affections, when there
is little reality: as those hearers: Ezekiel. 33.31. Hence: Romans 12.9. Let love be
without ^ssimulation.

4 From all mixtures of corruption: As your zeal from passions, and
bitterness; your anger from revenge: your joys from levity etc.

4 Suit your affections to Gods Ordinances, and Providence: to Gods words, and
Luke 7.32. etc.

The administrations of Gods providence call for suitable affections: as Jsa.
22.12. In that day did the Lord God call to mourning: etc. yea we should suit
our affections to the conditions of others Romans 12.15. To weep with them that
weep etc. So Psa, 17.1.6. Neh. 1.4. Psa. 119* 136. we should mourn for the
sins of the times Ezekiel. 94. Jsa. 57.1.

Yea they should be suitable in degree: Great sins, or calamities call for
great sorrow: great salvations for great joy etc. For which end.

1 We must sanctify God in our hearts, and make him our fear, joy, hope etc.

2 To be affected contrary to our condition, or Gods dispensations makes a
discord in Gods ears, and pulls down judgment. Isa. 22.12.13.14. Amos 6.4.
etc.

3. To be affected with things as God would have us, is a means to make that
good use of them God intends us by them.

Mingle affections, not only to allay, and moderate them, but to corroborate

1 Because, this will keep the heart whole, and entire, and prevent heart
divisions, when the affections go hand in hand, and flow together in one
channel.

2. It will the better unite their forces, and make them more strong: what is
spoken of persons, is true of affections: Eccles. 4.9. etc. Two are better then
one, etc.

Seventhly, Spiritualize affections* as 1. Sorrow for affliction into sorrow
for sin; VII. Rule.
turn worldly sorrow into godly sorrow. So your delight in the creatures to
promote your joy in the Lord, and in communion with Christ, and in holy duties:
your hopes of favors from men to raise expectation of spiritual blessing from
God: your fear of man into an awful dread of God, Isa. 51.12.

Eighthly, Root and increase good affections in you, as Ephesians. 3.17. and that

1. Because, when they are rooted in the heart they will be durable, and mould
us into their likeness: else they will be but flashes, and bear no fruit, as
R^v. 2.4. Gal. 4.15. John 5.35.

2. Cherish holy affections, and blow them up from a smoke to a flame, by the
bellows of prayer, and fuel of the Word, 1 These. 4.9, 10.

Ninthly, Distinguish affections, and act them.

1. Distinguish them by the Objects about which they converse, and by the Roots
from whence they grow, and by the heads to which they rise.

1. The Objects about which affections are conversant, are either good or evil,
as apprehended so by the understanding: As when the understanding apprehends a
thing to be good, the affections embrace it with love, Cant. 5.2, 5, 6. and
this good is either present, and then we rejoice in it: or absent, and then we
desire it; If it be improbable to be attained, then we fear; If impossible,
then we despair: If obstructed, it stirs up anger.

If the evil be future, we fear it, etc.

2. The Roots from whence the affections grow, are love or hatred. All the
affections which arise from the apprehension of good grow from love: As desire
is love in motion: the continual sallies of love: Delight is love acquiescing
in the possession of it; Fear is love in awe of the beloved: Hope is love in
expectation: Zeal is love in a flame.

All the affections which arise from the apprehension of evil, grow from hatred.

3. The heads to which they arise, and are referred: Thus all the affections
which are conversant about good, have some delight in them, as Love, Desire,
Hope. All that are conversant about evil have some grief mingled with them: as
Hatred, Fear, Repentance, Anger.

2. Act them according to the nature of them. For,

Affections are the first principles, or movers of actions, and action is the
end or proper work of affections.

To act affections consider why God has placed them in the soul, and act them
accordingly: Concerning which see each particular affection under their proper
heads.

Tenthly, try affections whether they be true or false, real or counterfeit; X.
Rule.
and that

1. By their properties. 1. Are they set upon right objects? as to love,
desire, delight in, and hope for God and good only. To hate, fear, fly, and
mourn for, and be angry with that which is evil.

1. Are they sincere for their acts and ends? Are their acts real or feigned?
as Mar. 12.30. 1 John 3.18. Do you hate and mourn for sin really? Do ye prefer
God and his glory before self? Do ye prefer public good before private?

2. Are they sincere for their ends? Do we affect goodness for goodnesse-sake?
and God, his Word, Servants, etc. for the goodness that is in them? Do we hate
evil for evils sake? Do we affect spiritual things for spiritual ends? Do we
desire gifts and graces to glorify God, subdue corruptions, etc?

3. Are they moderate? Do you keep them within bounds? Are you fearful of
exceeding in them?

4. Are they seasonable for time and occasion? then they are good fruit, Psalm.
1.3. unseasonable affections are like Snow in Summer, or Rain in Harvest.

5. Are they constant in their course? not sudden flashes, or fleeting motions,
stirred up by fits, or upon extraordinary occasions, but the constant pulls of
our soul.

6. Are they unchangeable and invincible in their bent? Can nothing take of our
affections for God and goodness? our hatred and mourning for sin? our delight
in Gods Ordinances, and Duties? etc. Unchangeable love is true love: Such is
Gods to us: and invincible hatred against sin is right hatred, John 13.1. Jer.
31.3.

2. Try them by their effects?

First, do they draw us nearer to God, Christ, Heaven, to walk with him, and
wait on him for grace and strength? Do they further our Communion with God, and
conformity to him.

Secondly, do your affections prepare you to holy duties, put you forward to
them, in them, and further your obedience as the wheels and sails of your
soul?

Thirdly, do they help you in eschewing and overcoming evil, as well as in the
obtaining good? Do they turn you from, and set you against evil, so that you
dare not sin, because you hate it, and fear God?

But on the contrary, if your affections,

1. Disturb Reason and hinder it, or cause you to call good evil, or evil good,
or to stand in defense of evil, as Jonah did of his passion, Jonah 4.9. I do
well to be angry, etc.

2. Draw you away from God to go a whoring after vanity.

3. If they indispose you to duties, take off your edge to them, or put you out
of frame for them, as Exodus 6.9. 1 Pet. 3.7.

4. If they disquiet your souls, trouble and unsettle them, and cause a tempest
in them, as grief did in David, Psalm. 42.11. So Act. 16.27. Genesis 30.1.

5. If they put the body into a languishing condition, as Amons love, or lust
rather did him, 2 Samuel 13.4.

6. If your affections misguide tongue, or hand, as passion did Moses tongue,
Psalm. 106.33. Jeroboams hand, 1 Kings 13.4. they are not right.

Quest. Why should we try our affections?

Answ. First, Because they are the pulse of the soul, and by the temper of them

Secondly, Because there is much deceit in them: For a great part of the hearts

Quest. Why should we so diligently govern our affections?

Answ. First, Because such as the affections are, such is the man: Good
affections Job, chapter 1.1. And so Ps. 112.1. Deuteronomy. 5.29.

Secondly, God accepts our persons and services according to our affections: As
Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, Genesis 22.16, 17. and David's to build
him an house, 1 King. 8.18. 2 Samuel 7.11. For 2 Cor. 8.12. It is accepted if
there be a willing mind, etc. 2 Cor. 9.7. So Ephesians. 6.7, 8. Col. 3.2^, 24. Yea,
God is much taken with his peoples affections, 1 Cor. 8.3. Cant. 4.9.

Thirdly, Affections are the root of spiritual Worship in us, and of our
Communion Luke 8.15. Mal. 2.2. Deuteronomy. 6.6. Act. 2.41. Isa. 66.2. Jam. 5.16. Ephesians.
5.19. Mal. 3.16.

and solace of life lies in love, joy, desire, hope, etc. and how much
discomfort in fear, grief, anger, hatred, envy, etc? The greatest troubles
that ever befell many, were procured by their own disordered passions. So 1 Timothy
6.9, 10. 2 Timothy 3.1. to 5. John 12.43.

The best men are subject to discover humane infirmities in their affections,
as Moses, Psalm. 106.33. Job, chapter 40.5. David, 2 Samuel 1^.33. Abraham, Genesis
12.18, 19. Peter, Mat. 14.30, 31. Paul and Barnabas, Act. 14.15. Elias, 1 Kings
19.4.

Affections make us convertible to God, marriageable to Christ, pliable to

1. Convertible to God: for in the Conversion of sinners he works upon their
affections, to draw and gain them to himself, as Acts 2.27. and 16.29, 30.

2. Marriageable to Christ: for Christ wooes our affections, when he would
marry us to himself, by heart-charming compellations and arguments, Cant. 5.2.

3. Pliable to relations: for relations are founded in affections: as love is
the glue that makes man and wife cleave each to other, Ephesians. 5.31. so of Parents
and children, Masters and servants. So of friends, 1 Samuel 18.1.

4. Tractable, either to good or evil, to truth or error. Hence 1. Satan to
draw men from the Truth and Ordinances, labors to bring them into distaste of
their Ministers. 2. To draw them into error, he labors to bring the broachers
and teachers of errors into favor with their hearers, Ephesians. 4.14. 3. To draw
men to sin he bewitches their affections, and by them blindes and corrupts
their judgment, as he did Eves, Genesis 3.6, 12.


See Mr. Fenner. Ball. R^yner.
of the Government of Affections.

Quest. Whether may the strength of Grace consist with the want of those strong
affections, which Christians have found in their first Conversion?

Answ. For answer hereunto these three things are to be considered.

First, When a man may be said to lose his first affections?

Secondly, in what cases a strong Christian may be said to want strong
affections?

Thirdly, whence it is that they which have strong grace may yet want such

For the first, Affections are fitly compared to the pulses of the soul, by
which judgment may be given of the state and temper of the soul; and that we
may know when our affections beat low and are decayed, we may judge thereof by
these signs.

1. When we have not such quick desires after duties. Mostly a Christian at his
first Conversion, is so earnest and eager after holy duties, that he will
scarce allow himself time for the duties of his particular calling. Yea, many
times they tire themselves in hearing, reading, meditation, etc. But afterward
this heat abates, and they pray less, hear seldomer, etc. which usually
proceeds from their multitude of worldly occasions.

2. Affections may be judged to be decayed, when men want those soul-ravishing
joys which formerly they have had: which being abated, their affections also
are abated.

3. Affections are decayed, when sensible profiting by Ordinances is abated,
Indeed, a man may profit by Ordinances, and yet not be sensible of his
profiting. He may grow at the Root in solidity of Grace, though it may not
shoot up so much in blossom of affections.

Quest. For the second, In what cases may strong Christians want strong
affections?

Answ. First, If they have less sin in duties, though they have less
affections: Young Converts have oft-times much affections in holy duties, but
withal much corruption: they are subject to rashness, and precipitancie in
their prayers, to be proud of their graces, and to be too apt to have ca^nal
dependence upon their duties; but old experienced Christians, as they have often
less affection, so they have less sin in holy duties, and exercise more grace
in them. So after duties, a weak Christian is apt to indulge his corruptions,
thinking that he has made a compensation for his sins by his duties; but an
experienced grown Christian, though he be not so affectionate in duty, yet he
is careful afterward not to spoil all by sin.

Paul prays for the Philippians, not only that their love might abound, but
that their judgment might abound also, Phil. 1.9. Though old experienced
Christians have not so much affection; yet they have more solidity and
clearness of judgment, more experimental knowledge in the profound mysteries
of the Gospel, and more distinct apprehension of the deep things of Christ;
whereas affection without knowledge will be but rashness, yet such have a
Promise made unto them, Isa. 32.4. The heart of the rash shall understand
knowledge, etc.

Luke 23.27. Some men's temper is like ice that easily thawes; others are like
iron, and it must be a hot fire that will melt them down; But the less
affectionate, are the more judicious.



Quest. Whence is it that they that have strength of Grace, may yet want those
strong affections which they had at their first Conversion.

Answ. First, Because at first Conversion, grace was but particularly employed,
which afterward is more diffused, and generaly employed. When much water runs
in one channel, it makes the stream to run the stronger: but when there are
many rivulets cut out, though there be as much or more water, yet there is not
the same strength of the stream; So it is at our first Conversion, then all our
affections made up but one stream, and therefore seemed the stronger. A new
Convert has not so many duties to perform as a grown Christian, because he
does not know so many. It may be at first, all his affections run out to pray,
to hear, to read, and whilst all the affections run in this one channel,
they seem to be very strong: whereas a grown Christian has, besides these,
many particular duties of his calling, and relations to follow, and therefore
its no marvel though his affections seem weaker.

Secondly, This is from the newness of the condition. Naturally we are much
affected from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. 1 Pet.
2.9. By the Grace of Conversion, God brings us out of darkness into his
mavelous light: and because its so mavelous, therefore it does so much
affect. Our change at Conversion is very great: we become new men, and we are
so affected therewith, that we are (as it were) astonished therewith. Yet in
this case we must distinguish between solid affections, and transient passions,
which wear off presently, and vanish suddenly. The affections of some
Christians, especially of young ones, are like colors which are not in grain,
they will soon fade. It is with a new Convert, as with a man going to
execution; whilst he is upon the Ladder a Pardon is unexpectedly brought, how
will he be transported with joy? He will even leap for joy, yet afterward this
torrent of his joy may he abated, though his life be as dear to him as ever. So
when a soul has been brought by the Law to a sight of its lost condition, when
the Gospel proclaims a Pardon, and the Spirit of God has set on the comfort
of that Pardon upon the heart, Oh what ravishments has that soul fot the
present! which perhaps he shall not long retain: the violence of his joy is
abated, but the solidity of it remains.

A third Reason may be taken from Gods indulgence to young Converts, who
Shoes, but a Ring; not only clothes, but the best Robe: not only bread, but
the fatted Calfe, and Music at this Feast, and all this was for his newly
converted and repenting Son: he did not entertain him so every day after. At
our first Conversion God expresses much bounty and indulgence to us, and
afterward, though we have the same love from God, and the same love to God,
yet the expressions may not be the same now, as formerly they were.

Quest. What must we do when we find that we have lost our first affections?

Answ. First, Labor to be sensible of, and humbled for those decays. A decayed
condition is an uncomfortable condition: Though thy grace may carry thee to
Heaven; yet by thy decays, thou will live uncomfortably on earth.

Secondly, Labor to get those decays repaired. If thou have lost thy first
love, repent and do thy first works, Rev. 2.4, 5.

Thirdly, Make up the want of former affections in solidity of knowledge and
judgment: and if the candle give not so great a blaze, let it give a more clear
and

Fourthly, Labor to keep up the first vigor of your affections. For,

1. Remember that you may lose that in a short time, which you may be long

2. Labor to keep up your holy affections; For the truth of grace is more
discerned by our affections, then by our actions. Its easier to dissemble acts
of grace, then gracious affections. A Painter may paint the color, but not the
heat of the fire.

3. Its very hard to retain the first vigor of our affections, therefore we
should take the more pains about it. Flushing of spiritual joy is like the
sea, wherein the tide does not flow so high, but the ebb falls as low: Bernard
speaking of them, says, Rara bona, brevis mora, they come seldom, and stay but
a short time: As the Fall follows the Spring: and one day is clear, and another
cloudy; so it is with the best Christian, his affections are not always at the
same pitch: yet it should be our endeavor to maintain in our souls our first
vigorous affections in, and toward the ways of God.

Mr. Love of Grace.

CHAP. VII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Afflictions
Quest. WHat is Affliction?

Answ. Any trouble, grief, or evil whatsoever, that happens either to soul or
body, name, goods, or estate, for correction of sin, or for trial, as it does
to the godly: or for punishment and vengeance, as it does to the wicked, Romans
2.8.

Quest. Why does God suffer his children to be distressed and afflicted?

Answ. He respects himself therein: For

First, God gains glory many ways by it; As first his power is seen in their
Job, Mine eyes have seen thee, Job 42.5.

Secondly, not only present power and mercy is then seen, but former: we see
what power was used in preventing misery, what mercy in giving comfort.

Thirdly, Then God shall have their custom and company. Children that care not
for their Parents in prosperity, will fly to them in adversity.

He aims at his peoples good therein: For

1. Whilst they are Spectators, they lay about them in getting and exercising
of grace. Others deep sorrows make us see how needful it is to get much faith,
patience, Scriptures, etc. in readiness.

2. They stir up to prayers, mercies, etc. as when Peter was in prison, they
thought it high time to pray, Acts 12.5.

3. When themselves be afflicted, they help themselves by the afflictions of
others; Such suffered this affliction, and God loves them, why not me also?
Such cried, and sped well, why may not I? Psalm. 32.5, 6.

God aims at the Parties good in great distresses: Hereby they are tried,
humbled,

2. Hereby they are brought to receive often sentence of misery, Death, Hell in
themselves; and its good to taste these things before we feel any of them: It
will empty a man of himself, and make him trust in the living God. It will
learn him those three lessons of Christianity, mentioned by Paul, Phil. 3.3. To
worship God spiritually, to make Christ his joy, and to lay down all confidence
in the flesh.

3. Hereby they are made helpful to all, For 1. We cannot pity others till
experience has taught us. 2. We will not be serviceable till affliction has
humbled and broken us. 3. We know not how to comfort others till our selves
have been wounded and healed: But when we have learned by experience, we can
make our plaster serve another man, and comfort him in the same affliction
with the same consolation, 2 Cor. 1.4.

See Dr. Harris's David's comfort, p. 56.

Quest. Why does God suffer holy men to be afflicted?

Answ. Saint Chrysostom has set down eight Reasons, to which more may be
added.







Job.

Romans 8.17.

Sixthly, For the consolation of others, when they see that all things fall
alike





David.





Hosea 2.6.



See Stock on Mal. chapter 3. p. 236.

Quest. But what shall we say to extraordinary afflictions?

Answ. They are no good proofs of a bad person or condition, as in Job, etc.

Obj. But would God so afflict me if I were his child?

Answ. So? How so?

Obj. I am crossed in a child as never man was: so ungrateful: so unnatural?

Answ. Yea, except David: Eli* and yet they were beloved.

Obj. Oh, but I have such a beast to my husband as never woman had?

Answ. Yea, Abigail.

Obj. Oh, but my estate is so broken, that I am worth nothing?

Answ. So was David's at Ziklag: So Naomies, and yet beloved.

Obj. Oh, but I have sold all, and now want bread?

Answ. So did the widow of Sarepta, 2 Kings 4.1. So Neh. 5.2. etc. and Lam.
5.6, 10.

Obj. Oh, but my body is smitten too?

Answ. So was David's: Psalm. 32.3. and Jobs: and yet beloved.

Ob. But I am disabled from all service: I can neither pray, nor read, nor
hear, nor live, nor die.

Answ. So the Saints, Ps. 102.3. etc. the Church in Isay, and yet beloved.

Ob. Oh, but my spirit is wounded. I am scorched with hell-flames in my
conscience.

Answ. So Job, and David, and yet beloved.

Ob. Oh, but I am torn in pieces with hellish blasphemous tentations?

Answ. Christ had such offered from Satan, and yet beloved.

Ob. Oh, but I am haunted with lusts: now impure lusts: then covetous,
revengful lusts, etc.

Answ. So was Paul, Romans 7.14. etc. Gal: 5.17. yet beloved. Resolve therefore
that neither things present, nor things to come, shall be able to separate us
from the love of God, in Christ. For no affliction forfeits our title.

Ob. Oh, but mine be sins, passions, tentations?

Answ. Let them be what they will. If they be afflictions to us: If they tire,
wound; and make us cry to God, as Jehosaphat did, when they pursue us, they
weaken not our title.

Ob. Oh, but the smart of them may cause that without the hatred of sin! they
may make us weary because painful not sinful!

Answ. 1. They may: but these two are not well opposed: painfulness comes after

Secondly, If opposed; know the pains in hippocrites only follows sin
committed, Paul, Rom: 7:24. Who shall deliver me from this body of death.

Thirdly, Only great sins are painful, if nothing but pain be heeded, whereas

Fourthly, Sin is only painful to the unsanctified, whereas thou art as much

Fifthly, Pain makes an hyppocrite houle, but not to God, at least in the
First Davia, First to God, then to men: It ends in prayer, not in fretting,
despair etc. And is it thus with thee? Either thou must condemn David, or
confess that a man may be crossed in wife, child, house, goods, friends,
Kinsmen, all at once: Nay, hazarded in his life, tempted in his soul, troubled
in his conscience, yea plunged into a Sea of miseries, and yet be dear to, and
beloved of God. Dr. Harris.

Quest. What other reasons may be rendered why Gods Children are exercised with
grievous crosses?

Answ. Because they are so beset with corruption, and therefore must be purged.
For

First, Gods children will sometimes venture on noisome meats, and hurtful
David will lie, and commit adultery, and murder the innocent, what can God do
less (Unless he would have him spoiled) then scourge him thoroughly, when he
will be walking so near Hells-mouth, then take him by the heels, and make him
believe that he will throw him in. Its bettet he should lose his sin them God
his child.

Secondly, If they fall not to deadly poison, yet will they surfeit of lawful
meats; and pleasures unlawfully: So childish we are that we cannot be turned
lose to delights, and keep a mean: we cannot have prosperity but we abuse it,
swell, brag, snuff, look over our brethren, and forget our selves; It was so
with David, Psa. 30.6.7. Hezekiah, Jsa. 39.2.





Dr. Harris. p. 210.

Now that God has his great day for afflicting his own people appears by
these texts. Jsa. 42.24. Jer. 10.25. and the reasons are,

Amos 3.2. you only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I
will punish you, for all your iniquities. So Jer. 25.29. 1 Pet: 4.17.

Jer. 30.11.

Romans 2.23. Through breaking the law they dishonor God: yea their sins in some
respect are greater then the sins of others, being committed against greater
light, sweeter motions of the Spirit, louder cries of conscience, richer means
of grace, more frequent purposes, promises, and vows of better obedience: and
God has said that such as honor him he will honor, and such as despise him
shall be lightly esteemed, 1 Samuel 2.30.

Psa. 119.91. and therefore when the day of visiting his people comes, he
cannot want either accusers, or executioners. See Conants Parliament Sermon.

Adams filth even in the purest, which must be washed out with these waters of
Marah. Jsa. 27.9. and afflictions puts them upon judging themselves, that they
be not judged by God, 1 Cor. 11.30.31.

are apt to offend in prosperity, Job. 1.5. Psa. 119.67. 2. Cor. 12.7.

Seventhly, Troubles drive men to God: as sickness, lameness, blindness,

Eighthly, God: by these tries the spirits of men, as he led Israel 40 years
in the wilderness to prove them, Deuteronomy. 8.2. So Romans 5.3.4. Prove.

Ninthly Graces are much exercised by afflictions, Hence one said, Qui
nescit^are are discat navigare: He that knows not how to pray let him go to
Sea, and as afflictions

Tenthly, God intends to work glory to himself: thereby For

First, He justifies the power of his grace thereby against the slanderous
accusations of Satan, who accuses our service to be mercenary, as he did Jobs,
Job.

Secondly, Saints are added to the Church daily, and so great honor brought to
God by the examples of the patient sufferin^ of Gods people, Jam. 5.10 P^t.
2.20.21. When the people saw the constancy of Cipryan in his Marty^dome, they
cried out, Let us also with our holy pastor die. Moriamur simul cum sancto
Episcopo. and J^stin Martyr testifies of himself: that having been trained up
in the school of Pl^to, he was converted to Christianity by seeing the patience
of the Christians in their Martyrdom. Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesia: the
blood of Martyrs is the seed of the Church.

Thirdly, God shows then the glory of his power in drawing them out when John
9.3. and Lazarus whom he suffered to lie Four days dead John 11.39. So Exodus 14
13.

God also turns the crosses of his people into Crowns, and so their
afflictions make for their further glory. For

First, The readiest way to heaven is by weeping Cross. Christ who came from
the noe could find noe other way thither again Luke, 24.26. So Acts 14.22.
Heb. 12.6.8. Luke 16.22. His fatherly Correction keeps off the severity of his
judgments, fits thee for mercy, and so for heaven too.

Secondly, As they are a way to glory, so they work a proportionable reward of
glory, Q^o plus tormenti tanto plus erit gloria,.2. Cor. 4.17. Romans 8.18. See
Dr. (...). Parliament Sermon.

So then thou may be assured if thou be a son, thy heavenly father will
correct thee yet for thy comfort remember that,

First, He never does it till there be need. 1. Pet. 16.

Secondly, In wisdom, Heb. 12.9.10.

Thirdly, In measure Jsa. 27.8. and 28.26. etc. Jer. 46.28. 1. Cor. 10.13.

Fourthly, In love and tenderness, Prove. 3.12. Heb. 12.5.6. Rev. 3.19. Isa.
Psalm.: 103, 13, 14. Hos. 11 89.

Fifthly, for a moment only Psalm. 30.5. and 103.9. and 125.3. Isa: 10:25. and
54.7.8. and 57.16. Jer. 10.12. Mich. 7.18.

Sixthly, To try thee what dross of corruption, and what found metal is in
thee Deuteronomy. 8.2. Psalm: 66.10. Prove. 17.3.3.. 1 Pet. 1.6.7. Jam. 1.2. and

Seaventhly, To purg out sin. Jsa. 25. and 27.9. Prove. 20.33. Psa:

Eighthly, To refine and make the virtues of Christ more stirring in thee Dan.
Zach. 13.9. 1. Pet. 1.5.9. to refine and make the virtues of Christ more
shining in this, Dan. 11.35. and 12.10. Zach. 13.9. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7.

John 15.2. Romans 5.3.4, 5. Isa. 26.9. Ja^. 1.2, 3. and amongst all the rest,
faith always become most famous by afflictions, as Heb. 11.

Job 5.17. Jam. 1.12. and 5.11. Psalm. 94.12.

Cor. 11.^2. 2 Cor. 4.17.

Isa. 41.10, 11. and 43.2. Psalm. 91.15.

Job 5.18, 19. Psalm. 34.17, 18, 19. and 50.15. and 91.15.

Isa. 20.13.

See Boltons Preparation to death, p. 31.

Fifteenthly, by afflictions we are made conformable to our Head Christ.

David confesses, Psalm. 119.75. In very faithfulness thou have corrected me.

Quest. What design has God in afflicting his children?

Answ. To teach them to know him and to trust in him, and to know themselves:
Luther, Schola crucis est Schola lucis, the House of Correction, is the School
of Instruction. (...) are (...). His rods when sanctified are powerful Sermons
to teach us.

1. To know God: and this is life eternal to know him, John 17.3. Its said of
Manasseh, 2 Chronicles. 33.13. Then he knew that the Lord was God: Affliction
teaches us not only to know God in his power, anger, hatred of sin, but also
in his goodness and mercy. For God does so sweeten the bitter Cup of
affliction, that a child of God does often taste more of Gods love in one
months affliction, then in many years of prosperity, 2 Cor. 1.4, 5. and 7.4.
Affliction also teaches us to know God experimentally, and affectionatively: so
to know him, as to love and fear him, and to fly to him as to our Rock and
hiding place in the day of distress, Cant. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. By night, i. e. in
the time of divine desertion, etc.

2. Not only to know God, but to trust in him also, 2 Cor. 1.9.

3. To know our selves also: when the Prodigal was in adversity he came to
himself, Luke 15.17. they teach us to know that we are but men, Psalm. 9.2. yea,
but frail men, Ezekiel. 21.17. and that God can crush us as easily as we do moths:
which will make us to stand in awe of God, and to study to serve and please him.

Secondly, Gods aim in affliction is to keep us from sin. So 2 Cor. 12.7. or

1. They open the eyes to see sin, as Genesis 42.21. Oculos quos culpa claudit,
poena aperit.

2. They open the ears to discipline, as Deuteronomy. 5.27. For Jer. 2.24.

3. They open the mouth to confess sin, Judge. 10.15.

4. They command us to depart from iniquity, Job 36.8, 9, 10. They are Gods
Furnaces to purge our dross: Gods Files to pare off our spiritual rust: Gods
Fanns to winnow out our chafe, Dan, 11.35. and 12.10.

Thirdly, Gods end is also to make us holy and righteous, Isa. 26.9. Hebr.

Fourthly, to make the world bitter to them, and Christ sweet. For Prove.

Fifthly, to prove their graces, Rev. 2.10. Deuteronomy. 8.2. 1. The truth and
sincerity Job with afflictions: and the strength of our graces; for it requires
a strong faith to endure great afflictions.

2. To improve our graces: For as the Palm Tree, the more its pressed, the hi^
her it grows, so do the graces of Gods people.

Sixthly, it is to put an edge upon their prayers, and all their other holy
services.

1. Upon Prayer: what a fervent prayer did Manasses make when he was in fetters
in the dungeon, 2 Chronicles. 33.13, 18, 19. When Saint Paul was struck off his
horse* and smitten with blindness, then he prayed to the purpose, Acts 9.11.
So Isa. 26.16.

2. Upon Preaching. Prosperity glutteth the spiritual appetite, Adversity whets
it.

3. Upon the Sacrament. How sweet is the Sacrament to a true Saint, after a
long and great sickness.

4. It makes God and his Word precious. If God set our corne-fields on fire, as
Absalom did Ioabs, then we come running to him: and how sweet is a
Scripture-Promise to a child of God in his distress, Hos. 5. ult.

Quest. What considerations may cheer up our hearts in the time of affliction?

Answ. First, that God never afflicts his people, but out of pure necessity, 1
Pet. Lam. 3.33. Isa. 27.9. Its sin that puts thunderbolts into Gods hand. God
never scourges us, but it is with a whip made of our own sins, Prove. 5.22.
Romans 2.5. Hence Isa. 28.21. Its his strange work.

Secondly, he does it out of his true and real love, Heb. 12.6, 7, 8.

Obj. Do not divine afflictions proceed from anger? was not God angry with
Moses for speaking unadvisedly, Psalm. 106.33. and with David for Adultery?

Answ. This anger was a fatherly anger rooted in love. It was not Ira quae
reprobat, but Ira quae purgat: It was not Ira hostilis, and exterminativa, but
Ira As its sometimes a great punishment for God not to punish, Isa. 1.5. Hosea
4.14. So its a great mercy sometimes for God to withdraw his mercy.

Thirdly, afflictions are a part of divine Predestination: that God that has
elected us to salvation, has also elected us to afflictions, 1 These. 1.3, 4,
6. Romans

Fourthly, they are part of that gracious Covenant which God has made with his
people, Psalm. 89.31. etc. In which Text three things are observable.

1. A supposition of sin? If his children forsake my Law, etc. For it is
always the cause sine qua non, the cause without which God would never
chastise us, and mostlie its the cause for which he chastises.

2. A gracious Promise, Then will I visit their transgressions with the Rod,
and their iniquiry with stripes.

3. A merciful qualification, Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not take
from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail, etc. So Psalm. 119.75.

Fifthly, Consider that afflictions are part of the Saints blessedness, Job
5.17. Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects, etc. Afflictions when
sanctified are instructions, and so are evidences that we are in a blessed
condition, Psalm. 94.12. Job, when upon the dunghill, wonders why God should so
set his heart upon him, as to visit him every morning, and try him every
moment, Job 7.17, 18. Lazarus full of sores, and in his rags, was happier then
Dives in his robes: P^ilpot in his Colehouse, then Bonner in his Palace.





^i^^hly that all afflictions shall at last work for their good, Romans 8.28. God
D^u. ^.25. God will either deliver them out of afflictions, or send them to
heaven by them.

Quest. What else may comfort us in the times of affliction?

Answ. First, consider that by afflictions we are conformed to the Image of
Romans 8.29.

Secondly, that Christ himself suffers with us, nay, suffers in us. Act^ 9.4.
Christ

Thirdly, he will (...) then us with his grace, that we shall be able to say
Phil. 4.13. I can do all things, (yea, and suffer all things too) through
Christ tha^ s^^^^g^neth me.

Fourthly, Christ will sweeten all those waters of Marah to us, that we shall
Came. 1.13. A bundle of (...) is my beloved to me, he shall lie all night
between ^y br^^sts: though a bundle of bitterness, yet I Will lodge him as near
my heart as may be.

Fifthly, as li^ht is to a man that has lien long in a dungeon: as the Haven

Quest. What must we do to prepare for ^fflictions?

Ans^. First, get a stock of graces: For sickness is a time of spending, not

Now the Graces to be stirred up beforehand are*

1. A true and a stron^ faith: for a little faith will faint under great
afflictions: when the win^e blew fiercely* Peter's little faith ^ailed, Mat.
14.30.

2. A great measure of patience to enable us to wait quietly and contentedly,
till God comes in with help, who many times deferres till the fourth watch of
the ni^ht, as Mat. 14.25.

3. A great stock of self-denial, humility, contempt of the world, heavenly
mindedness: Such will be as safe as No^^ in the A^k: and as those which had
sufficient food in the seven years dearth in Egypt.

^ob 19.25. this was Jobs comfort. So Paul, Romans 8.^8.

Moses, Numb. 14.19. and David, 1 Samuel 17.37. and Paul, 2 Cor. 1.10.

Isa. 42.23. we are commanded to hear for aftertime.

Fifthly, a stock of Scripture-Promises which will be as so many reviving
cordials, D^vid, Psalm. 119.92. I had perished in mine affliction, unless thy
Law had been my delight.

Quest. But what may we do to know the meaning and voice of Gods Ro^?

Answ. Gods Rod ordinarily speaks three Languages. 1. It corrects for sin. 2.
It tries and exercises grace. 3. It instructs in holiness: sometime its for
the two latter, and not for the former: as in Jobs, and the blind man's case.
But usually its for all three, Lam. 3.39. Isa. 42.24. Luke 1.20. 1 Cor. 11.30.

Quest. How shall we know whether our afflictions are only for trial and
instruction, and not for sin?

Answ. Its safest to believe that they are for sin also, when upon our selves,
though out of charity we judge them not so to others, Romans 5.12. For though all
afflictions are not sent directly and specially for sin, yet sin is the
original of all afflictions.

Quest. What course must we take to find out that particular sin for which God
corrects us?

Answ. First, Sometimes we may read our sin in our punishment. As in
Adonibezek, 1.7.

Secondly, consider, what that sin is, for which thy conscience most accuses

Thirdly, what is the sin of thy constitution: what is thy dilectum delictum,
thy peccatum in delitiis, thy beloved and bosome-sin, of which David speaks,
Psalm. 18.23. I have kept my self from mine iniquity.

Fourthly, when sick and near death, consider what sin does most trouble and

Fifthly, What those sins are, for which thy godly Minister, under whose charge

See Mr. Calamie's Godly man's Ark.

Quest. What means may we use to quiet our hearts in afflictions?

Answ. First, Remember that they are inflicted by the Decree of Heaven, and Job
5.6. So Jer. 51.53, 55. Psalm. 39.9. etc.

Secondly, that they are sent to try thy patience: to show how well thou

Thirdly, its the common state of all mankind: we are all borne to sorrow, Job
5.7. As a man we must bear what is common to man, and as a sinful man we bring
troubles on our selves, and therefore should say with the Church, Mich. 7.9. I
will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.

Fourthly, that God takes care for his children, and then especially when they
Psalm. 40.17. I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks of me. So Jer. 29.11.
Isa. 49.13.14, 15.

Fifthly, that God intends us no evil but good thereby, Jer. 24.5. For Romans

Sixthly, when in affliction, be assured that it shall be better with thee then
now, James 5.6. the darkest night shall have a fair morning; The Rod of the
wicked shall not always rest, etc. So Isa. 54.11. and 62.3.

Seventhly, what we lose by afflictions are such things as may be spared, and
Zach. 10.8. 2 Cor. 4.8, 9. Zeph. 3.19.

Eighthly, no affliction shall be too much, or too long, for that only is too

1. That exceeds our desert. Whereas Ezra 9.13. Thou have punished us less
then our iniquities deserve.

2. Nor too much in regard of our strength, for God proportions his burdens to
our backs, and his strokes to our strength, Isa. 27.7.

Obj. But Paul says, 2 Cor. 1.8. that he was pressed out of measure?

Answ. First, Indeed he met with unreasonable men who knew no measure, and his
afflictions were above his strength as a man; but he was able to do, and to
suffer all things, through Christ strengthening him, Phil. 4.13. At such times
God increases their power, Isa. 40.29, etc.

How long? and a little time seems long; But God who intends our good, must
take a time answerable to his own intentions; when the sore is cured, the
plaster will fall off; If we be not in the fault, usually thy time is short: A
day: the evil day, Ephesians. 6.13. A night, Psalm. 30.5. A piece of a night, Isa,
17.14. A moment, Isa. 54.8. A small moment, ver. 7.

Quest. How can this be when afflictions are often much longer?

Answ. First, in the times of affliction there are many lucida intervalla,
intermissions,





See Mr. Valentines Parl. Sermon.

Quest. What are the benefits of receiving our afflictions as from God?

Answ. First, it will put us upon serious humiliation for our sins, whereby we
have provoked him against us, the rather because no hand can heal us, but the
same that has wounded us, Hosea 6.1. 2 Chro. 7.14.

Psalm. 76.10.



Quest. What is especially to be feared when afflictions are heavy, and long
upon us.

Answ. First, then especially fear, and look to the seeds of rage and madness
which are in thy heart. Never more need to look to the banks, then when a
tempest is upon the sea. Have you seen a beast break his teeth upon the chain
that ties him? or a dog pour forth his revenge upon the stone that hurt him,
then have you seen some dark shadows of that fierceness and fury that is apt
to rise out of our hearts, when Gods hand lies close upon us. When thou hear
of the strange impatience of Jonah, at the beating of the Sun upon his head,
unto whom yet it was a wonder that he did now see the Sun: when thou hear of
those deep expostulations of David with God, Psalm. 77.9, 10. Has he forgotten
to be gracious? forgotten his Promises? forgorten his Truth? forgotten his
Power and Mercy? and shut up all his kindness in displeasure? when thou
hear the impatiencies of Job, yet a man renowned for his patience, Jam.
5.11. expostulating and charging God, Is it good for (...) that thou should
oppress? Job 10.3. when thou hear of those deep curses of Jeremy against
the day of his birth, Ier. 20.14, 18. of those froward expostulations and
debates of the people of Israel with Moses, and of Moses with God, Why have
thou evil entreated this people? why have thou sent me? Exodus 5.28.22. Oh then
reflect upon thy self, and be afraid of thine own evil heart, which is far
more likely to break out against God, then any of those were; and for
prevention hereof keep in thy sight the history of thy sins, make them as
heinous to thy own view as they are in their own nature. The way not to rage
against afflictions is to know our selves aright; that will make us to confess
as Ezra, That the Lord has punished us less then our iniquities have deserved.
Ezr. 9.13. The way to bear the hand of God with patience is to confess our
sins, and to be humbled for them. Levit. 26.40, 41. Wherein is showed that the
sight of our sin and humiliation for it, is the way to make us accept of the
chastisements of God: so Lament. 3.39. Wherefore does the living man complain?
a man for the punishment (...) his sins. Where are three strong reasons why we
should not murmr in our affliction. First, We are men, and what an impudency
is it for the clay to swell against the Potter that formed it, and complain
why have thou made me thus? Secondly, We are sinners all the punishments we
suffer are the wages of our own iniquities, an^ what a madness is it to
complain against the justice of our Judge? Thirdly, We are living men, and
therefore God has punished us less then our sins deserve: for the wages of sin
is death: Romans 6.23. and what ingratitude is it to repine against merciful,
and moderate punishments? and yet we are prone hereunto; But it is the cure;
See v. 40. Let us search, and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord our
God, the more that we grow acquainted with our sinful estates, and mavelous
provocations, with the patience, and promises of God, the more we shall
justify God, and wait upon him; the more we shall judge our selves less then
the least of Gods mercies, forbearances; as Mich. 7.9. q. d. I have pressed,
and vexed, and wearied him with my sins without any care of his glory, but he
has visited me in jugdment not in fury: In wrath he has remember mercy, and
not consumed me as he might have done, he has not rewarded me according to my
sins, etc. but has spared me as a son, when I dealt with him as a Traitor. See
Dr. Raynolds sinfulness of sin, p. 175.

Quest. How shall we bear afflictions rightly?

Asw. First, If we count it no strange thing to lie under it, 1 Pet. 4.12. but
rather that it is that whereunto we are ordained of old, to be conformed to
Christ in Romans 8.29. Yea, if we esteem them as the beaten path, by which God
will have all his Children to enter into heaven. Acts 14.22. 2 Timothy 3.12.

2ly, If we observe the example of all, or the most excellent of Gods servants,
and especially of his only Son, from the beginning of the world to this day,
Heb. 12.1.2

Thirdly, If we inure and accustom ourselves: to bear the yoke from our
youth, it will tame our proud and rebellious hearts, and frame us to bear
afflictions Lam. 3.27.

Fourthly, If we consider that Satan every day invents new mischief against us,
Job. 1.6. etc.

Fifthly, if we remember that it is a sign of Gods love, Heb. 12.7. Rev. 3.19.
and Psalm. 37.5. Esth. 4.16.

Sixthly, If we remember the many good uses of afflictions. For hereby Gods
power appears in our weakness: and we have the better proof of his grace
dwelling Cor. 12.9. as Faith, Hope, Love, humbleness of mind, patience, etc.
that these light, and momentany afflictions work an exceeding, and eternal
weight of glory. 2 Cor. 4.17.

Quest. How shall we be sure to profit by afflictions?

Answ. First by the confessions of the Saints, who have experimented it: as
David, Psalm. 119.67, 71. Manasseh. 2 Chronicles. 33.13.

Qu. How come we by wisdom not only patiently to bear, but to profit by
afflictions?

Answ. First, it is obtained of God by prayer, Jam. 1.5, 6, 17.

Secondly, by a due consideration of the end, fruit, and uses of afflictions.

Quest. What are the ends of afflictions?

Ans. First, To keep us from wandering, or to bring us back when we have erred,
and to make us tractable scholars in the school of Christ. Ps. 119.67.71. 2
Cor. 1.10.

Manasseh: 2 Chronicles. 3 and 13.

Psa. 34.17, 19.

Romans 5.4.5. Jam. 1.3.

Cor. 11.31, 32.

Dan. 12.10. and as mustard laid upon the breast, to weane us from the world.
Psalm. 131.2.

Heb. 12.6, 8.

Heb. 12.8, 9. See practice of Christianity.

Quest. Are not all afflictions evil in their own nature?

Answ. Yes, and so the Lord stills them, Isa. 45.7. Amos. 3.9.

Henc^, Prove. 15.15. All the days of the afflicted are evil* and Genesis 47.9.
Few and evil are the days of my Pilgrimage, etc.



Lam. 3.19.



Quest. Are afflictions then simply, and absolutely evil?

Answ. No, for thus sin is only evil, but they are of an indifferent nature.

Quest. How then come they to be good.

Answ. First, In respect of the chief efficient, or author whence they come,
they are good, either as they are punishments inflicted by a righteous Judge,
or chastisements coming from the hand of a merciful Father.



Thirdly, As they help us to come to the chief goodness: For God has ordained
Romans 8.29. 1 These. 3.3.

Fourthly, As they are means to draw us nearer to God by true repentance, and
Mat. 7.14. Act. 14.22.

Quest. What rules are we to observe in preparing our selves unto the conflict
with afflictions

Answ. First, We must hear, read, and study the word of God: For

Ps. 119.92.

Psalm. 119.25, 50. Its our joy in all our sorrows, v. 143. and its our chief
comforter in all our miseries.

2. We must be frequent, and fervent in Prayer, acknowledging our sins, that
all Prove. 28.13. 1 John 1.9.

Thirdly, In our prosperity we must labor diligently in the moderating, and

Fourthly, we must not fain unto our selves afflictions in our conceit, and
imagination,

Fifthly, We must not by fear anticipate afflictions, making our selves
miserable

Sixthly, With wise, and Christian providence we must forsee crosses, and in
Luke. 14.28.31. Mat. 16.14.

Seventhly, We must not fix our hearts upon any thing in the world, but use
these outward blessings as though we used them not, and enjoy them as those
lose with immoderate grief: and if we look upon these things as perpetuities,
we shall be subject to much sorrow and find small patience when they prove
movables. So we should look upon Honor, riches, relations, health, etc.



Heb. 12:6: Psla. 119.120. and indeed we have small cause to contemn
afflictions if we consider our own weakness and want of patience etc. The
latter of these evils is to be avoided; because we should be courageous in the
power of Gods might, and not faint. Heb. 12.6. we should resolve with Job:
Though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee, Job. 13.15. such resolution was
in the three Children, Dan. 3.18. In Peter, and John, Act. 5.29, and In Paul,
Act. 21.13. Hence Romans 8.35.38. Remember his promise. 1 Cor. 10.13.

John 18.11.

Mat. 4.7. Jacob used all good means to escape his brothers fury, Genesis 32.11,
13. Moses fled from Pharaoh, Exodus 2.15. David from Saul and Absalom, 1 Samuel
19.12. 2 Samuel 15.16. -- Joseph and Mary from Herod, Mat. 2.14. Paul from the
Jews, Acts 9.25. and 22.21. and 23.

Quest. What considerations may move us, patiently and quietly to bear those
afflictions which God lays upon us?

Answ. First, that afflictions are not laid upon us by God as punishments to
satisfy his justice: For,

1. Christ bore all our sins in his body upon the Cross, 1 Pet. 2.24. Isa.
53.5, 6, and had not Christ done this, he had not been a perfect Savior, nor
had offered to his Father a full and all-sufficient price for our Redemption.
But he was a perfect Savior, Luke 1.74. Heb. 7.25. and 9.12, 26. Mat. 20.28.
John 1.29. 1 John 1.7.

2. Christ taking upon him our debt, by being our Surety, he has discharged it
to the uttermost farthing. Yea, he has also cancelled the handwriting of
Ordinances, and the obligation of the Law by nailing them to his Cross, Col.
2.14. Gal. 3.13. and therefore God cannot require a new satisfaction by our
sufferings, etc. Yea, God is so far off from punishing, where his Justice being
satisfied, wills him to spare, that when he corrects his people, its called
his strange work, Isa. 28.21. and he is grieved for it, Judge. 10.16.

3. Where there is no sin, there is no place for punishment: but in the
faithful there is no sin, because it is not imputed to them: their sins are
washed away by the blood of Christ, and being justified for his righteousness
and obedience, they are accepted as righteous in Gods sight, Col. 1.14. and
2.13. Rev. 1.5. 1 John 1.7. John 3.29. Jer. 31.34. Isa. 1.18. Jer. 50.18. Mich.
7.19. Psalm. 31.1, 2.

4. Afflictions tend to our good, to the mortifying of our sins, and to the
multiplying and increasing Gods graces in us, and furthering our everlasting
happiness, Romans 8.18, 28. 1 Cor. 11.32. Heb. 12.10, 11. 2 Cor. 4.17. Lam.
3.27. therefore they are not punishments for sin, not being inflicted for our
hurt, but for our good.

5. That which is either a cause, or means of eternal blessedness, cannot be
a punishment for sin: but so are afflictions to the godly, Psalm. 94.12, 13. and
23.4. and 16.11. and 119.67.

Secondly, that afflictions are to the godly the chastisements of a gracious
Father,

Because we have testimonies and examples in Scripture to make this out, Ier.
25.29. 1 Pet. 4.17. Amos 3.2. Prove. 3.11, 12. Heb. 12.5, 6. Rev. 3.19. 1 Cor.
11.32. So we see in the examples of Job, David, 2 Samuel 12.25. 2 Samuel 7.14. of
the Church, Psalm. 89.31, 32, 33. Ps. 99.8. Romans 8.35, 38.

Quest. How is this love of God manifested unto them in their afflictions?

Answ. First, by the measure of afflictions, and that

1. In general, in that he corrects us in measure, when our sins have been out
Isa. 64.9, 12. Jer. 30.11. and 46.28. Mat. 10.30 So we see in Job 1.12. and
2.6. and Isreal's bondage, Exodus 12.40, 41. Jer. 25.11. and 29.10. Rev. 2.10.
and 12.6.

2. In that all our afflictions are small and light, far inferior to the
desert of our sins, Lam. 3.22. 2 Cor. 4.17. 1 Cor. 11.32. 2 Cor. 6.9.

3. In that they are momentany, and of short continuance, 1 King. 11.39. 2 Samuel
7.14. Isa. 57.16. Lam. 3.31, 32. Mich. 7.18. Psalm. 103.8, etc. Mal. 3.17. Ps.
30.5. Hos. 6.1, 2. Isa. 54.8. Ps. 71.20.

Secondly, In that our afflictions exceed not our strength: In anger he
remembers Hab. 3.2. He corrects in judgment, Jer. 10.24. and 30.11. 1 Cor.
10.13. yea, he proportioneth them according to the scantest measure of
necessity, laying no more upon us then he is necessarily enforced to do, having
therein respect to his own glory, and our benefit.

Thirdly, in that God the Father has committed the tempering of our Cup Psalm.
103.14. Yea, he himself began to us of this Cup, and drank it all off, and has
left us only some few drops. His was given him in anger for the purging away of
punishment in respect of sin: but ours in love, either to purge out sin, or to
prevent sin, Isa. 53.4, 5. Heb. 4.15, 16. and 2.17, 18. and 5.2. Job 5.18, 19.
Mat. 12.20.

Mat. 8.24. Exodus 2.23. and 14.10. Psalm. 118.18. 2 Cor. 4.8, 9. Romans 8.35. 2
Cor. 1.5, 7. Psalm. 94.19. and 46.4. and that he gives strength also, See Isa.
40.29, 30, 31. Psalm. 41.1, 3. 2 These, 3.3. Isa. 41.10, 13, 14. Psalm. 46.1, 2,
3. God uses to moderate our grief for worldly crosses, by giving us spiritual
comforts, Romans 5.3. Act. 7.76.

1. He takes no delight in our sufferings, but uses all means to prevent our
punishment, Lam. 3.33. Isa. 28.21. Mich. 7.18. 2. The measure of our
afflictions exceeds not necessity, and therefore first he corrects us gently,
and if that prevail, he proceeds no further. 3. By Gods corrections and
medicines we may guess at the greatness of our faults and grievous diseases,
4. Our great afflictions argue that our sins are great, either in their own
nature, or as they are aggravated by circumstances.


1. As a Soldier, behaving himself valiantly in fight, the honor returns
also to his Captain: so when we fight manfully against temptations and
afflictions, God our General is glorified thereby: and that in the
manifestation of his power and goodness, assisting us in our afflictions, 2
Cor. 12.9. and 4.7. Ps. 44.3, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 10.17. Isa. 25.3, 4. 1 Samuel
2.6. Psalm. 50.15. 2. God is glorified in our afflictions, as they are trials of
our spiritual graces, John 21.19. Psalm. 44.22.




1. As they learn by them to fear God in his judgments, 1 Pet. 4.17.

2. As they serve to restrain them from committing the like sin, which they see
punished in us: Thus God severely chastened Moses and Aaron for their distrust,
that others might be aware of the like: so David for his adultery: Lots wife
for looking back, Luke 17.32. So 1 Cor. 10.6, 11.

3. As they serve to manifest Gods graces in us, and so make us examples of
piety unto them, and Presidents for their imitation. So Abraham's trial in
offering Isaac, Genesis 22.2. Moses was tried both with prosperity and adversity,
Heb. 11.25. So Jam. 5.11. Acts 5.41. Jam. 5.8, 10. Mat. 5.12. Phil. 1.13, 14.

4. As they are Partners of humane frailty, whilst in our afflictions we
bewray impatience: For this will comfort a man when he bears his Cross with
much weakness and imperfection, in that he observes that Gods dear children,
yea, and great Worthies have showed the like frailty, as Job 3. Jer. 20.18.

5. As they are occasioned hereby to acknowledge and magnify Gods power,
appearing in our weakness, his wisdom in our foolishness, and his goodness,
and the virtue of his graces in our frailty, and natural corruption, 2 Cor.
1.11.

6. As our hearts are made tender by afflictions, so that we are apt to pity
others in the like miseries: as also because after we are delivered, we are the
better able from our own experience, to comfort others with those consolations,
wherewith ourselves have been comforted. So Psalm. 34.4, 5. 2 Cor. 1.4. So it
was in Christ, Heb. 2.18.

Quest. How will it appear that afflictions cannot hurt the children of God?

Answ. First, because the afflictions of this life do neither deprive us of any
of Romans 8.38, 39. Heb. 12.6. they do not extinguish no^ diminish in us Gods
sanctifying Graces, but rather they are increased by them; they do not make us
more slack in the service of God, but rather kindle our affections in them. Nor
do they hinder our heavenly happiness, but rather further it. Again, they
bring not upon us the chiefest evils that are to be avoided: For they do not
empair our spiritual estate: for though the outward man decay, the inward man
is renewed daily: they defile us not with sin, but rather (like files) scour
off our rust; they do not subject us to the Curse of the Law, or to the wrath
of God, or to the torments of Hell: but rather by bringing us to a fight of our
sin, and sense of our misery, drive us to Christ the great Physician of our
souls, they hurt us not in the day of death, but by our being inured to suffer
them, death becomes much more tolerable, etc. Psalm. 34.19, 22. and 129. 2, 3. 2
Cor. 4.8, 9. Exodus 3.1, 2, 3.

Secondly, because God not only aims at, but powerfully effects our good Romans
8.28. Deuteronomy. 8.16. Lam. 3.27. Ps. 119.71. So Genesis 50.20.

Quest. How does God intend, and work our good by afflictions?

Answ. First, in this life, whether we consider them as trials, or as fatherly

1. As trials, for they are not always chastisements for sin, but sometimes
gracious trials, whereby God tries us for his glory, and our own good. So
Deuteronomy. 8.2. Zach. 13.9. 1 Pet. 4.12, 13. Job 1.9, 10, 12. and 23.10. Psalm.
139.1, 5. and this God does, not to better his own knowledge: for, Psalm. 139.1,
2. Jer. 17.10. Heb. 4.13. but to make us known better, both to our selves and
others. Again, God tries us by afflictions, whether we are true Christians or
no, lest we declare ourselves to others as the stony ground did, Mat. 13.5, 6.
So Mar. 10.22. Christ tried the young man. Yea, God by afflictions tries what
measure of grace we have attained unto, as what measure of faith and affiance
we have in God. So Acts 21.13. Romans 8.35, 38. Job 13.15. So also of our love,
patience, humility and obedience, Acts 20.19. 2 Cor. 6.4, 5. 2 Samuel 15.26. Mar.
14.36.

2. He tries us for the advancing of our credit, and esteem also, through the
manifestation of his graces in us, Prove. 17.3. Ars tua Typhe jacet si non sit
in aequore fluctus, etc.

3. He tries us likewise for the discovery of our infirmities, and corruptions
for our further humiliation, Psalm. 81.7. Mat. 26.70, 71.

Quest. What comfort may the consideration hereof afford us in our afflictions?

Answ. First, this consideration may justly move us to bear all our
afflictions, not only with patience and humility, but also with thanksgiving,
and spiritual

1. Because nothing should seem too difficult to be attempted, nothing too
grievous to be borne, if it tend to the advancement of Gods glory, which should
be the supreme end we should aim at in all we do, and suffer.

2. Because hereby we may get assurance that we are Gods children; for God
tries, and in trying purifieth us, that we may be vessels of glory for his own
use, Isa. 48.10. Psalm. 11.5. Iam. 1.2, 3.

Quest. How may we know that our afflictions are trials, and not punishments
for sin?

Answ. First, when by them we are purified, and made to shine more gloriously
in the eyes of God and men, through the brightness of those saving graces
which are manifested by them.

Secondly, when we a^e not overcome in the conflict, so as to murmr against
the dispensations of God, but show Christian fortitude notwithstanding, and
overcoming all these assaults.

Thirdly, When they prove profitable to us in humbling us for sin, and
quickening us in prayer for pardon and reconciliation through the blood of
Christ.

Secondly, we may be comforted in our afflictions, because they have always
Jam. 1.13. but he tries us to do us good, Deuteronomy. 8.16. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. and that
after victory we may receive the Crown of eternal life, Rev. 2.10. Job 23.10.

Obj. But my afflictions are great, and my strength small, so that I fear I
shall be overcome?

Answ. God knows how to fit his trials to thy strength, and he has bound
himself by Promise to do it, 1 Cor. 10.13.

Obj. Yea, but in the mean time I am so pressed, that I discover many
corruptions?

Answ. Happily this is necessary and profitable for thee, that thou may be
humbled by the sight and sense of thy corruptions, brought to unfeigned
repentance for them, and an hearty endeavor in the use of all good means, to
be freed from them.

Abraham, Job, David, Paul, etc.



1. By enriching us first with his graces, and then trying them, whereby their
excellency is manifested to all that behold them.

2. By crowning his graces in us, when as by trial they are approved: as the
Armorer first graces his armor by good Workmanship, and then brings it to the
proof, and lastly employes it in his Princes service.

Fifthly, we may be comforted, because God uses afflictions as an effectual
Hosea 5.15. and 6.1, 2. Isa. 17.7. Ps. 83.16. and 78.34, 35. Isa. 26.16. 2 Chronicles. 33.12. Act. 9.5.

1. For by afflictions he fits, and prepares us to hear the Word, Hos. 2 6, 7.
Job 33.16, 17. and 36.15.

2. By afflictions he works in us contrition and humiliation, 2 Samuel 15.26. 1 Chronicles. 21.17. Lam. 3.22.

3. Afflictions are usually the last means that God uses to convert obstinate
sinners, Jer. 8.5, 6. Amos 4.6, 12. If they profit not by these, their case is
desperate as in those foregoing texts. So Isa. 1.5. and 9.13.

Heb. 12.10. Job 33.16, 17. Isa. 4.4. Ezekiel 24.11.



1. First, those which are seated in the understanding; as saving knowledge,
and spiritual wisdom, Prove. 19.15. Isa. 28.19. Hos. 6.1, 3. Job 33.16, 17. and
33.15. Psalm. 119.71. and the benefit of this spiritual wisdom, does much
exceed our hurt by afflictions, Prove. 3.11, 19. and 3.15. John 17.3. Psalm.
94.12.

2. They much confirm, strengthen and increase our faith. So in Abraham, Heb.
11.9. and this they do through the experience which we then have of the truth
both of Gods threatenings and gracious Promises. So 1 Samuel 17.36, 37. 2 Cor.
1.9, 10. As also by causing us to renew our repentance, and assuring us that
our sins, for which we are thus corrected, shall not rise up to our
condemnation, 1 Cor. 11.32. They also strengthen our faith as they are signs
of our Election, Romans 8.29. Luke 24.16. 2 Timothy 2.12. Acts 9.15, 16. Amos 3.20.
and as they are signs of our effectual calling, 2 Timothy 3.12. Luke 9.23. 1 Pet.
4.17. ^er. 25.29. John 15.19. and as they are signs of our Adoption, Gal. 4.1.
Heb. 12.6, 8. 2 Samuel 7.15, 16. Gal. 4.29.

3. They confirm and increase in us affiance, love, hope, fear, and humility.
Our affiance, Jer. 10.6. Psalm. 23.4. and 46.1, 2. 2 Cor. 1.9, 10. Job 13.15. So
for our hope, Romans 5.4. and 4.18, 21. and our love, Cant. 8.6, 7. and our
fear, Psalm. 119.120. Heb. 12.31. Isa. 57.11. Psalm. 111.10. and our humility,
Psalm. 115.1. Dan. 9.7. Deuteronomy. 8.2. 2 Cor. 12.7. 2 Samuel 15.26. 2 Chronicles. 12.6. and
33.12. Lam. 3.28, 29, 30.

4. They increase in us repentance and new obedience, as they put us upon
self-examination to see our sins, and to bewail them with greater grief, Genesis
42.21. Psalm. 32.4, 5. 1 Kings 8.35, 36. God by them increases in us obedience
to his Will, Heb. 12.11. 1 Pet. 4.1, 2. John 15.1, 2. 2 Chronicles. 12.8.

5. They make us more devout and zealous in his service: as in prayer, Isa.
37.1, 2, 3. Psalm. 18.1, 2. 2 Chronicles. 33.12. Isa. 26.16. Psalm. 78.34. and 81.7.
and 107.6, etc. and 108.12. In thanksgiving, Psalm. 103.8. Lam. 3.22. Exodus
15.1. Jude 5.1. Psalm. 30.11, 12. and 59.16, 17. and 9.13, 14. They increase our
patience, Romans 5.3. Jam. 1.3. 2 Samuel 15.26. Heb. 5.8.

2. Secondly, God by afflictions works and increases in us all those
virtues,

1. Hereby we are moved to do justice unto all men.

2. We are made more merciful, and compassionate toward others in misery, Heb.
5.2. and 2.18. and 4.15, 16.

3. We are by them made more humble and courteous toward our neighbors, Prove.
18.23. 1 Kings 20.10, 18, 30, 31.

4. Afflictions bring us to a knowledge of our selves, Psa. 30.6. and 104.29.
Hag. 1.9.

5. By the exercise of afflictions our strength is increased to bear them,
Prove. 24.10.

6. By afflictions God works and increases in us temperance, sobriety,
modesty, and chastity.

Thirdly, God uses afflictions as means to convey to us diverse worldly
benefits

1. By afflictions we profit much in civil wisdom and policy.

2. By them we are enabled to discern our friends from our foes; He who is a
friend in need, is a friend indeed.

3. By them we come the better to relish Gods blessings and benefits, Prove.
27.7.

Quest. What further helps are there to comfort us in, and under afflictions?

Answ. First, if we compare our lesser and lighter afflictions with those
Abraham, Genesis 12.1, 2, 10. and 13.7, 8. and 14.12, 14. and 16.2. and 20.2. and
21. Of Isaac, Gal. 4.29. Genesis 25.35. Of Jacob, Genesis 27. and 34. and 35.22. and
37.35. Of Moses, Heb. 11.25. Of Job, David, Jam. 5.11. 1 Samuel 30* 2 Samuel 18.33.
Of Paul, Act. 9.15, 16. 1 Cor. 4.10. etc. and 2 Cor. 4.9, 10. and 6.4, 5, 6.
and 11.23, etc. And its the lot of the whole Church militant to suffer
afflictions, Isa. 41.14. and 54.11. 1 These. 2.14. The Scripture often foretells
the manifold afflictions of the faithful, Luke 9.23. John 16.20. Revel. 3.19. 2 Timothy 3.12. Heb. 12.6, 8. Acts 14.22. 1 Pet. 5.9. Heb. 10.33, 34.

Isa. 53.2, 3. Heb. 2.10. and 5.8. Luke 24.16. and 8.3. and 9.58. Mat. 27.38,
etc. 46. and consider further.

1. That Christ suffered all those miseries being innocent, Isa. 53.9. 1 Pet.
2.22. 1 John 3.5.

2. Yea, he suffered them for us who are sinners, dead in our sins, children of
wrath, and enemies to God, Isa. 53.4* 5. 1 Pet. 2.24.

3. That we shall be adjudged unworthy to reign with Christ, if we be not
content to suffer with him, Matthew. 10.38, 39. and 16.24, 25. Luke 14.13.

4. That God has pre-ordained those to be like Christ in sufferings, who shall
reign with him in glory, Romans 8.29. 1 Pet. 2.21. 2 Cor. 8.9. Mat. 20.22, 23.

Eighthly, we may be comforted* by comparing our afflictions with the
punishments

1. The wicked endure many and great miseries in this life, for the attaining
of earthly vanities, J^r. 5.9. Hab. 2.13.

2. But especially their intolerable torments in hell, do infinitely exceed all
the miseries of Gods people in this world.

Luke 6.21. John 16.20. Romans 8.18. 2 Cor. 4.17. 1 Pet. 1.4, 6, 7. 1 Cor. 2.9.

Psalm. 118.18. Psalm. 34.17, 19. and 147.3. Heb. 12.10. Psalm. 125.3. Isa. 57.16.
For,

1. God takes notice of all our afflictions to deliver us out of them, Psalm.
34.15. and 94.7, 9. and 33.18, 19. 2 P^t. 1.9. Psalm. 40.17.

2. God is present with us in all our afflictions to help and relieve us, Job
5.15, 16. and 36.15. Psalm. 34.18. and 121.5. and 145.18, 19. and 91.14, 15.
John 14.18. Isa. 43.1, 2. and 41.10, 13, 14. and 46.1, 2, 3. 2 Chronicles. 32.7, 8.
and our God is Omnipotent, and therefore able to help us, Psalm. 18.31. Isa.
63.1. Nahum 1.6, 7. Isa. 26.4. Yea, he loves us, and therefore will deliver us,
Deuteronomy. 7.6. and 32.9. Tit. 2.14. 1 Pet. 2.9. Jer. 31.3. Psalm. 103.13. Isa.
49.15. and he never shows his love more then in the time of affliction, Isa.
63.9. Judge. 10.16. Jer. 31.20. Lam. 3.31, 32, 33.

Mr. Downhams Christian Warfare.

CHAP. VIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about the Angels.
Quest. WHat are Angels?

Answ. Created good spirits sent forth by God to minister for the good of the
Elect, and for the punishment of the wicked, Heb. 1.17, 14. 2 Kings 19.15.

Quest. What titles does the Scripture give to them?

Answ. First, they are called spirits, to show their nature, which is
spiritual.

Secondly, Ministers, to show their Office, which is to

Thirdly, Men of God: So Judge. 13.6, 9. The Angel is called a man, because he
appeared in the shape of a man: and a man of God, because he came from, and was
sent by God.

Fourthly, Sons of God: So Job 1.6. Because they received their being, and are
sustained by God, as also for that being made after his Image, they still
retain the same.

Fifthly, Gods. So Psalm. 8.5. to set out their excellency, Psalm. 82.1, 6. For
so in Scripture^language excellent things are styled Gods, Psalm. 97.7.

Sixthly, Cherubims, Genesis 3.24. Ezekiel. 10.1. which signifies a Figure or Image:
most usually a resemblance of a young man: for so they appeared as a man, to
show that they had knowledge and understanding, (as men have reasonable souls)
and as a young man, to set out their beauty, vigor, strength, etc.

Seventhly, Seraphims, Isa. 6.2, 6. which comes from an Heb. word that
signifies to burn: and they were so called, either from this particular act in
touching the Prophets lips with a burning cole: or from their fervent zeal in
executing the Will of God.

Eighthly, Watchers: So Dan. 4.13, 17. and its attributed to Angels.

1. Because of their nature, being spirits they are not subject to drowsinesse
and sleepiness: but wake and watch day and night.

2. Because of their office, which is always to behold the face of God, Mat.
18.10. and to be ever ready to do his Will, Psalm. 103.20. which requires
watching.

3. Because of the constant and continual care that they have over the Saints
to keep them from the manifold dangers, whereunto they are subject. Hence they
are said to be full of eyes round about, Ezekiel. 1.18.

Holy ones; So Dan. 4.13, 17. because of that holiness wherein they were at
first created, and in which they still abide: Hence called holy Angels, Mar.
8.38. Mat. 25.31.

Gods Host. So Genesis 32.2. Psalm. 103.21. Luke 2.13. because God uses them as an
Host to protect his Saints, 2 Kings 6.17. and to destroy his enemies, 2 Chronicles.
32.21. Rev. 12.7.

Thrones. So Col. 1.16. because of their dignity and excellency, being fit to
sit on thrones, at least in comparison of other creatures.

Dominions: So Col. 1.16. because God has given them dominion and rule,
whereby as Lords under God they order and govern matters and persons in the
world.

Principalities; as Dominions note indefinitely and generally, such as have
authority without respect to any peculiar jurisdiction; So Principalities are
such as have a special and peculiar jurisdiction: So Tit. 3.1. Its attributed
to Angels, Ephesians. 3.10. Col 1.16. because God sets them over particular Policies,
Kingdoms and Persons.

Powers: the word properly signifies that right which Governors have to
exercise their authority. So John 10.18. Acts 5.4. It shows therefore that
Angels have a good right to that Government which they take upon them.

Mights: this title imports strength and ability to accomplish what they
undertake. Hence they are said to be mighty in strength, Psalm. 103.20. So they
are called, Romans 8.38.

Quest. What are the principal properties of the Angels?

Answ. First, they have great knowledge: for they are understanding creatures
Mat. 18.10. In Heaven they always behold the face of God, implying, that they
are privy to the whole Counsel of God revealed in Heaven. On earth also they
frequent the Assemblies of Saints, whereby they know the whole counsel of God
made known to the Church, Ephesians. 3.10. 1 Pet. 1.12. And this gift is necessary,
because their maine function, is to be Gods messengers to declare and execute
his Will, which they could not do without knowledge thereof.

Jam. 3.13. they are coupled together. And this is necessary, because the evil
Angels, against whom the good Angels defend the Saints, are exceeding crafty
and subtle.

Thirdly, Purity: which is perfect without the mixture of any impurity and Rev.
15.6. Hence they are styled holy Angels, Mar. 8.38. under which is comprised
their sincerity, Rev. 14.5. and their integrity in execuring Gods Will, Psalm.
103.20. and these are necessary to make them fit to appear in the Presence of
the pure and holy God; For Rev. 21.27. Hab. 1.13. Psalm. 5.4.

Fourthly, Glory: such is the brightness of their glory, that its resembled to
Mat. 28.3. so that men on earth cannot endure the brightness of Angels, Numb.
22.31, 33. Mat. 28.4. Yea, good men cannot endure it, Luke 1.12. and 2.9. Rev.
19.10. and 22.8. Dan. 8.17. and this is necessary for the glory of the Lord
whom they serve, as Courtiers attending upon Kings are gorgeously attired, Mat.
11.8.

Fifthly, Power: Hence they are called mighty, 2 These. 1.7. Strong, Rev. Psalm.
103.20. Resembled to horses and charets of fire, 2 Kings 6.17. See what one
Angel did, 1 Kings 17.35. and this is necessary, because the Church and
children of God whom they defend, have here against them, not only many,
mighty, cruel, malicious men, but Principalities, Powers, etc. Ephesians. 6.12.

Sixthly, Speed: Hence they are said to have wings, Isa. 6.2. Dan. 9.21, 23.

1. They cannot be hindered by any bodily impediments, no corporal substance
can stay their course; they can pass through, and pass over Castles, Cities,
Stone-walls, Iron-gates, Woods, Rivers, Seas, etc.

2. They have no corporal gravity to slaken their motion.

3. They need not such space of time to pass from place to place, as bodies
need. They can suddenly move from heaven to earth, or into any place of the
world.

4. They have great forwardness to do any task enjoined by their Lord, more
then any other creatures. Its necessary for them.

1. Because heaven and earth are so far asunder, and they have often occasions to
pass from one to the other.

2. Many Saints in the world, (whose distress requires present succors) are
far distant one from another.

3. Devils are very swift to mischief: and its meet that good Angels be as
swift to protect, as evil ones to annoy.

Seventhly, Zeal, which is most fervent; Hence Seraphim; such as burn flame of
fire, Heb. 1.7. Its necessary because of the fiery fury of the devil and his
instruments in plotting against Gods glory, and his Saints good, therefore the
good Angels must be as zealous in maintaining the cause of God and his Saints,
as the other are furious against them.

Eighthly, Constancy in good: and this with respect both to their condition

In respect of their condition they are immortal, and without decay; Hence
after the Resurrection we are said to be equal to the Angels, Luke 20.36.

In respect of their disposition: It always temains good, and ever will do:
they never yielded to any evil, nor were weary of good, nor never repented of
doing good. Hence Rev. 7.15. they serve God day and night: And Mat. 18.10. Its
necessary, because the Lord whom they serve is Jehovah that changes not, Mal.
3.6. Jam. 1.17. God established the good Angels that stand, and this is the
true cause of their unalterable constancy.

Quest. What are the Offices of the Angels?

Answ. They may be ranked under three Heads.

First, such as they perform to God, which are these.

1. They attend in his Presence for the honor of his Majesty, and to set out
his magnificence. So 1 Kings 22.19.

2. They follow the Lord whithersoever he goes. Hence styled Charets of God,
Psalm. 68.17.

3. They are his Messengers to be sent on his Errands, Psalm. 104.4. Dan. 7.10.

4. They are often employed in declaring his Will, as in delivering the Law, Acts
7.53. Gal. 3.19. Heb. 2.2. So in diverse other particulars: As Genesis 16.7, 9. and
19.1. 2 Kings 1.3. Dan. 7.16. Luke 1.13, 26* and 2.10. Acts 1.11. and 5.19, 20.
and 8.26. and 10.3. Revelat. 1.1.

5. They are his Ministers, to do what God appoints them, Psalm. 103.20. Genesis
19.1. Numb. 20.16. Numb. 22.22. Dan. 6.22.

6. They are Executioners of Gods judgments, as 2 Samuel 24.15, 16. 2 King.
19.35. Rev. 15.7.

7. They are special instruments of praising God, Rev. 7.11, 12. and 4.8. Hence
they are called on to do it, Psalm. 103.20. and 142.2.

John 1.51. G^n. 28.12. Heb. 1.6. Psalm. 91.11. More particularly, 1. They
foretold his conception, Luke 1.30, 31. 2. Declared his birth, Luke 2.9. etc.
3. Prevented his danger, Mat. 2.13, 14. 4. Ministered to him in his need, Mar.
1.13. 5. Protected him from enemies, Mat. 26.53. 6. Comforted him in his Agony,
Luke 22.43. 7. Opened his Grave at his Resurrection, Mat. 28.2. 8. Witnessed
his Resurrection, Luke 24.5, 6, 23. 9. Confirmed his Ascension, Acts 1.10, 11.
10. Accompanied him to Heaven, Ps. 68.17, 18. Ephesians. 4.8. 11. Reveal what he will
have done, Rev. 1.1. and 22.16. 12. Fight with him against his enemies, Rev.
12* 7. 13. Gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, Matthew. 13.49, 50.
14. Accompany him at his last coming, Mar. 8.38. Mat. 25.31. 15. Execute his
last judgment, Mat. 13.49, 50.


Heb. 1.14. Hence, Mat. 18.10. In particular, 1. They are Stewards to provide
for them in their need, 1 Kings 19.5, etc. 2. As Physicians to cure their
maladies, John 5.4. 3. As Nurses to bear up and keep them from hurt, Ps. 91.11,
12. 4. As Guides to direct and keep them from wanderings, Genesis 24.7. and 32.1.
5. As soldiers to guard them, Psalm. 34.7. 2 Kings 6.17. and to destroy their
enemies, 2 Kings 19.35. 6. Rescuers and deliverers to pull them out of dangers,
Acts 5.19. and 12.7, etc. Dan. 6, 22. In reference to our souls in this life:
1. They are as Prophets or Teachets to instruct them, Dan. 8.16, 17. and 9.22.
Luke 1.15, 34, 35. Act. 1.11. 2. They are Comforters to them in their fears
and perplexities, Genesis 21.17. Isa. 6.6, 7. 3. Coadjutors to stand with them
against Satan, Zach. 3.1, 2. Judge. 9. 4. Fellow Members to rejoice with them at
the Conversion of sinners, Luke 15.10 5. Tutors to punish them for their
offenses, that they may be brought to repentance, 2 Samuel 24.16. In the life to
come they are, 1. Watchers, to carry their souls at the separation of them
from their bodies into Heaven, Luke 16.22. 2. As Keepers at the last day to
gather all the Elect together, Matthew. 24.31. 3. Fanners or Fishers to separate
the evil from the good, Matthew. 13.49. 4. Companions in Heaven to join with
them in praising God, Rev. 7.9, 10, 11.




Dr. Gouge on Heb.

Quest. Why does God use the Ministry of the Angels about us?

Answ. Not for any necessity, for he can do it of himself without them; but to
declare his abundant love to, and care of us in providing for our comfort, and
making far more excellent creatures then our selves our Keepers.

Quest. Why are the Angels such tender Keepers of Gods children?

Answ. First, because Christ our Head (who is their Lord and Head also) has
Col. 1.20. viz. Angels and men* so that whereas they hate us for our sins,
now they tender us as hi^ members.

2. They love us as Nurses their children, now that they see that God loves us

Thirdly, because he has given them charge and commandment so to do, Ps.

Quest. What comfort does the consideration hereof bring to Gods children?

Answ. First, When we see our own weakness and impotency on the one hand, and
the multitude, power and policy of the enemies on the other. When

Secondly, when we neglect the Watch over our selves, through sleep of Mat.
2.13. when Joseph slept, dreaming of no danger from Herod, the Angel
admonishes him in a dream, and tells him how to escape.

Thirdly, when we see great difficulties between us and our desires, what
comfort is it that we have Gods Angels ready to do it to our hands? as Mar

Fourthly, when Satan begins to insult, and makes as if he would t^ample upon
Daniel. Dr. ^ailor.

Fifthly, that their care and attendance on us will be perpetual, because their
love to us is founded on their love to Christ our Head, whose Members and

Ob. But Gods children often fall into inconveniences, how then are they
attended by the Angels?

Answ. First, they are preserved by the Angels from many inconveniences

Secondly, if at any time we fall into inconveniences, its because we are out
Ps. 91.11.

Thirdly, if we suffer in the custody of Angels any inconvenience, it is that
we Romans 8.28.

Quest. What may this Guardianship of the Angels teach us?

Answ. First, Not to grieve these good spirits: Its wondrous humility in them
that they will stoop to be our servants that are weaker, and baser then they:
and its wonderful patience that they will continue to guard us, though we
grieve them by our sins: this consideration would keep us from secret sins
where no eye of man sees us, but God and our consciences, and the blessed
Angels see us, and grieve when we fall into sin.

Tim. 5.21. but they are not the Spouse of Christ as we are; he has honored
our nature more then the Angelical.

Quest. But what need we the guard of Angels, since God can guard us without
them?

Answ. It is not by reason of any defect in God to supply his want of power,
but further to enlarge and demonstrate his goodness: God could do it of
himself, but having ordained such ranks of creatures, he makes all to serve for
his own ends.

Quest. What may we learn further from hence?

Answ. First, to take an holy State upon us, and to think our selves too good
to abase our selves to sin, to be slaves to men, seeing we have Angels to
attend upon us; we are Kings, and have a mighty guard, therefore we should
carry our selves answerable.



Quest, What excellencies are attributed to the Angels in Scripture?

Answ. They are said to be excellent for holiness, Mar. 8.38. excellent for
beauty, Acts 6.15. excellent for strength, Psalm. 103.20. excellent for wisdom,
2 Samuel 14.17. excellent for swiftness. Hence Isaiah 6.2.

Quest. Wherein should we imitate the Angels?

Answ. First, rejoice at the Conversion of sinners as they do, Luke 15.

Isa. 6.2, 25.

Psalm. 103.20, 21.

viz. with cheerfulness, sincerity, and without wearisomness.

Quest. What further comfort may the Nature and Offices of the Angels afford us?

Ans. First, In regard of their readiness they stand before the face of God,
ready

Jacob was alone, the blessed Angels were with him.







Quest. How are the Angels employed?

Answ. First, in respect of God they stand before him to execute his Will,
Psalm. 103.20, 21: and to praise him, Isa. 6.3.

Secondly, In respect of man they are employed.

1. By way of punishment, and that 1. To blind them that they cannot see, Genesis
19.11. 2. To stop them that they cannot go, Number. 22.26. 3. To slay them that
they cannot live, 2 King. 19.15. Acts 12.23.


2. In mercy to the godly, and that 1. To defend them from dangers, Ps. 34.8.
2. To comfort them in troubles, Luke 22.23. 3. To encourage them in duties, 2
King. 1.15. 4. To reveal to them hidden mysteries, Dan. 9.22, 23, 24. 5. To
carry their souls to heaven, Luke 16.22.


Quest. How else does God use the Ministry of Angels?

Answ. First, in the swaying of the Kingdoms of the world, and wherein we Ephesians.
3.10. they are called Principalities and Powers, because God gives them a
pre-eminence under him, and a power of ordering th^se inferior things; As the
devils are called, Powers of darkness, Ephesians. 6.12. because the wickedness of
the world does set them up as Kings and Princes: So Dan. 10.13. the Angels are
called Great Princes. They are made to he above Kings and earthly Powers, as
God is above them, Eccl. 5.8. Marvel not at the oppression in a Province; for
there is an high one above the High on earth: and there is the Father, Son, and
Spirit, higher then both. A created Angel led the Israelites into Canaan, as
may be gathered by comparing the 20. and 31. Chapters of Exodus together.

Secondly, they are Gods Warriors and Ministers of his manifold decrees. Kings
2.11. and 6.17. Hab. 3.8. Ps. 68.17.

Thirdly, they are Spirits of Heaven, Mat. 24.36. Gal. 1.8. resembling Sons of
God, Job 1.6. and 38.7. both in regard of their substance, which is
incorporeal: and in regard of their excellent properties, life, and
immottality, blessedness and glory, a part whereof is their just Lordship, and
Command over the inferior Creatures. For as they stand before the Lord, who
sends them out at his pleasure to serve his Providence, so they have no small
stroke in ordering and managing natural and civil affairs. Hence Ezekiel. 1.6, 7.
they have faces to look every way, when as Gods Watchmen, they stand Sentinel
in Heavens Turret: their feet are like Calves feet, round, and ready to go
either forward or backward with greatest facility. For as they see every way,
so they are ready to go every way, for dispensing Gods benefits, or executing
his chastisements on the Elect, and his vengeance on reprobates. Let us labor
to obey God as the Angels do; else we may be Angels for gifts, and yet go to
Hell.

Angels wait for Gods commands, and are ready to run on his errand, Mat. 18.10.
Dan. 7.10. Jacob saw them at Bethel, ascending to contemplate and praise God,
and to minister to him; and descending to execute Gods Will upon men for mercy
or judgment?

Quest. What other employment have they?

Answ. They are eyewitnesses of what is done in the Church of God, 1 Cor.
11.10. The woman ought to have power on her head, because of the Angels. This
was shadowed out in the old Church? Exodus 36.8. the Curtains were wrought with
Cherubims, to signify that about us, who are the true Tabernacle, and Church
of God, there are troops of Angels. Hence 1 Timothy 5.21.

Quest. How manifold is the knowledge of the Angels?

Answ. Its fourfold.





Dan. 7.16, etc.



Now the knowledge which the Apostle speaks of, that they have acquired, Ephesians.
3.10. is this knowledge of experience, beholding that which the Gospel wrought
in the Church, they did more fully see the work of Redemption. For, 1. They did
see accomplished before their eyes things which they had known in some sort; as
we know things absent unaccomplished. 2. They did thus grow to a more full and
confirmed enlightening, in the wise work of our Redemption. 3. And, which is
the principal, they did thus come to a more full knowledge, and acknowledgment
of the deep riches of the wisdom of God, the fountain of the former. For
though the Angels had always a blessed knowledge of God; yet not a perfect,
either in regard of themselves seeing, or of God seen: they did not see him
totaliter, so as there was no further thing in him to be seen; nor yet with
such a sight in regard of themselves; so perfect, that no further light could
be lent to it then it had.


Baines on the Ephesians.

CHAP. IX. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Anger, Wrath, Passion,
Malice, Hatred, and Revenge.
Quest. HOw many sorts of Anger be there?

Answ. Two. 1. Good. 2. Bad.

Quest. What is good Anger?

Answ. Its a displeasure not against the person, but against the sin of our
neighbor, or of our selves: this anger being moderate, and joined with
compassion is an holy anger: Commanded, Ephesians. 4.21. Commended, 2 Cor. 7.11. Or,

Its a displeasure at that which stands in our way, and hinders good. Thus
Moses was angry, Exodus 11.8. Lev. 10.16. etc.

Quest. What is bad Anger?

Answ. Its a desire to be revenged upon the person of our neighbor, either by
words or deeds, threatened, Mat. 5.22.

Quest. Why is Anger placed in the heart?

Answ. First, to be an Harbinger, or Usher to prepare the way, for obtaining
some good desired, and to remove the obstacles that lie in the way.

Secondly, to be as it were the hearts dagger for the defense of love, desire,
delight,

Quest. How must we act Anger?

Answ. First, against sin as the open enemy, and grand Obstructer of Gods
glory, Isa. 59.2. especially against sin in our selves: and in those that are
near and dear to us. So Moses, Exodus 32.19. Nehemiah, chapter 13.17, 21.

Secondly, For the removal of the impediments of Gods glory, and our

Thirdly, for the Reformation of the person, and the abuse.

Quest. How may it be proved that there is a good and lawful Anger?

Answ. First, because its attributed to God himself, Romans 1.18. John

Secondly, it was made by God, and was in man before the fall.

Thirdly, yea, it was in Christ himself as man, Mar. 3.5. Mat. 10.14. Joh.

Fourthly, many holy men in Scripture are commended for it, Exodus 16.20. Act.
8.20. Act. 7.24. and 13.11, 12. Neh. 5.6.

Fifthly, in true repentance there must be anger and revenge, 2 Cor. 7.11.

Eccles. 7.3. and commands it, Ephesians. 4.26. Mat. 5.22.



Quest. When is anger rightly ordered?

Answ. When it is moved, quickened and guided by faith, stirring up godly sorrow
for sin in our selves or others, joined with an holy and just desire of
revenge, to the saving of the person, appeasing of Gods anger, and promoting
the Kingdom of Christ.

Holy anger must have a just and weighty occasion: so we read of Moses, he was
angry, when contrary to the command of God Mann^h was reserved till the next
morning, Exodus 16.20. when they tempted God in worshipping the golden calf,
Exodus 23.19. When Corah etc. rebelled, Numb. 16.15. The causes of just anger
are,

Phineas, Numb. 25.7, 8. and Elias, 1 King. 19.14.

Paul, Acts 23.2. and in Christ, John 18.23. But this gives no place to private
revenge, when out of bitterness of spirit we seek the hurt of them that wrong
us. Forbidden, Matthew. 5.39. Romans 12.17. yet when wronged we may implore the aid
of the Magistrate, yet without a desire to hurt him that wrongs us, as Luke
18.3.

Thirdly, when injury is offered to our brethren; for by the law of charity we
Moses, Acts 7.24. in David, 2 Samuel 13.21. in Nehemiah, chapter 5.6. hence, James
1.9. we are commanded to be slow to anger: For the object of holy anger is sin,
not the person: so in David, Ps. 119.139. in Jeremy, chapter 6.10, 11.

Quest. What are the properties of holy anger?

Answ. First, It must begin at home: we must be most angry with our own sins.

Hab. 3.1, 2. So in Moses, he prays for those with whom he was angry, Exodus
32.31, etc.

Thirdly, anger for an offense must be mixed with sorrow for the offense. So in
Mark 3.5. Hence Gal. 61.

Fourthly, we must show Christian modesty in our anger, by abstaining Michael,
Jude 9.

decorum, and fit respect in it, and that,

1. In regard of our selves, we must have respect to our place and calling: A
Magistrate must show his anger, not only in countenance and words, but in his
actions also: and so must a father, the contrary was Eli's sin; but a private
person must only show it in countenance and words.

2. The offenders are not to be used all alike: A mean man must not show his
anger to a noble man, or Magistrate as he may to his equal; the son must not
show his anger to his father as the father may to the son. Moses, a Magistrate
uses the sword, Exodus 32.27. John Baptist, a Minister, uses only the sword
of the Spirit, Matthew. 3.7. Jacob a private man toward Laban, uses only mild
and gentle admonitions, Genesis 31.36. Jonathan by rising from the Table, and
going out, 1 Samuel 20.34. The three children in humble and respective words to
the King, Dan. 3.16. Paul the like to Festus, and Agrippa, Acts 25.10, 11. and
26.25, 29.

so as that it make us not to neglect our duty either to God or man.

Seventhly it must be moderate, rising and falling according to the nature of

Eighthly, it must be seasonable for time and continuance: It must not continue

Ninthly, the ends of holy anger must be just and holy: which are,

1. The glory of God which is set forth by our anger, when being private
persons we manifest our detestation of sin in word and countenance: Being
Magistrates we punish sin, and execute justice.

2. The good of Church and Commonwealth, which most properly belongs to
Magistrates who are to punish sin, not only that civil justice may be
maintained, but that Gods anger which hangs over whole countries where sin is
countenanced, or not justly punished, may be averted.

3. The good of the party: For hereby the offender is restrained from the like
future miscarriages.

Quest. How are we to stir up just and holy anger in our selves?

Answ. We are to stir it up by the exaggeration of the injury done, or
received, and that by the consideration of these four circumstances.

First, from the person that does the wrong: his baseness, wisdom, gravity,

Secondly, the second circumstance is the injury it self, as if we be injured
in

Thirdly, the person injured; as if he be a person of great authority, esteem,
and virtue: If one that was then endeavoring the offenders good, etc. In

Fourthly, the mannner of injuring: as if we be esteemed as friends, and yet
For in words we profess our selves Christ's servants, but in deeds we deny him:
We lightly regard his presence: sin against knowledge, and conscience, etc. If
ever we had just cause of indignation, it is against our selves for sinning
against God.

Quest. Why is anger rightly to be ordered?

Answ. First, because of all passion: it is deepliest rooted, and extends its
branches farthest; For no age, condition, or nation are free from it: other
passions only trouble some particular persons. Lust enflames one, ambition
another, covetousness another, etc. But whole states are enflamed by anger,
and fury.







Fifthly, it is the character of a fool, Prove. 12.16. and 14.17, 29. Eccles.

Sixthly, it makes a man unmindful of his own condition: If poor, yet he will

Seventhly, an angry person can neither please God nor man: He regards

Quest. What are the several kinds of disordered anger that must be shunned?

Answ. It Is disordered when it is not moved by faith, arises not from love,
keeps not within its bounds, and is not directed to a right end. The kinds of
it are many.

Caine, Genes. 4.5. In Saul, 2 Samuel 20.30. In Asa, 2 Chronicles. 16.10. In the Jews,
Luke 4.28. In Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 3.13.



1. Unjust anger that proceeds from our own suspicion and imagination only, as
in Eliab, 1 Samuel 17.28.

2. When we are provoked without cause, or upon every small occasion contrary to
the law of love, 1 Corinthians. 13.7. Prove. 10.12. and it is a man's glory to pass
by a Transgression, Proverbs 19.11. And so sudden anger which is admitted
without deliberation; condemned, Eccles. 7.9. Its a foolish thing, Prove.
14.17.29. such abound with transgressions, Proverbs 29.22.

Thirdly, immoderate, and immodest anger: which may be discerned by

1. When men utter words dishonorable to God by blaspheming, swearing,
cursing, etc. or opprobrious to their neighbors, as when their anger breaks
out into bitter and reviling speeches, as Shemei did against David, 2 Samuel
16.5. the Jews against Steven, Acts 7.54. Forbidden, Ephesians. 4.32.

3. When we have no regard of order, and comeliness, either in respect of our
selves, or those with whom we are angry: In respect of our selves, when (though
private men) we take revenge, which belongs to God, Romans 12.19. In respect of
the party with whom we are angry; as when a son being angry with his father
(though upon just cause) uses him unreverently: and so of servants toward
their Masters, etc. and all inferiors toward their superiors.

4. When it makes us forget any duty of love which we owe to them, as to pray
for them, and endeavor their reformation: So in the Disciples, Luke 9.54.

5. When it stirs us up to violent and unseasonable reproofs, Psalm 106.32, 33.

6. When its not mixed with sorrow proportionable to the displeasure that we
conceived: He that is rightly angry, though he be displeased with the offense,
yet he pities the offender.

Fourthly, when anger is partial its disordered: and that is,

1. When its hot against some sins* and can brook others as bad, either because
they suite with our disposition, or that we have little wrong by them.

2. when we are zealous against sin in our enemies, but ^avourable to it in our
selves or friends.

3. When we are as angry for small as for great offenses: whereas our anger
should be proportioned to the offense.

Fifthly, when it is directed against the person of the offender, not against
Cains toward Abel: Saul's toward David, Nebuchadnezzars toward the three
children, but Christ's rule is otherwise, Mat. 5.44.

Sixthly, when being long retained it turns to hatred.

Quest. What Motives may dissuade us from sinful anger?

Answ. First, consider the sinful causes of it, which are

1. Unbelief in Gods Word; David tells us that he was so patient toward his
adversaries because he waited upon God, Psalm. 38.13, etc.

2. Folly, for Eccles. 7.9. it rests in the bosom of fools.

3. Self-love which makes us so to prize our selves as never to think on the
injuries and indignities we do to others; and hainously to aggravate every
small wrong done to our selves.

4. Pride, which makes us more sharp-^ighted in apprehending a wrong, and more
furiously insolent in taking revenge, Prove. 13.10. so in the Ephramites, Judge.
8.1. and 12.1, etc. so Psalm. 10.2. This set Haman against Mordecai, and the
Jews, Esth. 3.5, 6.

5. Covetousness: For if the hope of a covetous man fail his expectation,
their unquiet thoughts prepare a lodging in their hearts for anger; they
trouble their own house, Prove. 15.27.

6. Impotency, and effeminatenesse of mind which makes men unable to bear
injuries: Hence women, children, sick, and aged persons are so waiward.

7. Luxurious niceness; If the houses of such are not kept neat; their diet
cooked to their minds: if a spot be on their clothes, they are so enraged that
the house will not hold them.

8. Curiosity: For when men have an itching desire to see and hear all things:
How friends, and foes speak of them: what servants do, and say, etc. they come
to hear, and know many things which provoke them to anger. Hence Prove. 20.3.
Eccles. 7.21, 22.

9. Lightness in believing reports, and listening to tale-bearers: Hence,
Prove. 26.20. and 16.28. so in Saul, 1 Samuel 22.19. yea, in David, in hearkening
to Ziba, 2 Samuel 19.29. Hence Jam. 3.6.

10. Inordinate love, or excessive sorrow: For the powers of the soul, being
weakened by these passions, are made unable to bear any burden.

11. Want of meditating on the common imperfections whereunto we are all by
nature subject: For if we consider that our selves have as great, or greater
faults as those we are angry for in others, we would not be so easily provoked
for every trifling occasion, Eccles. 7.21, 22. Titus. 2.3. If we would look
more at home, and less abroad, it would prevent much anger.

12. Tenderness of education, and foolish cockering of mothers, begets anger,
making their children more teasty then wasps, more proud then peacocks, more
wanton then the Asse-colt, etc. whereas severer education would pull down their
stomachs, and make them more patient.

13. Idleness, unthriftinesse, and voluptuousness nourish anger. Hence,
Proverbs 26.17. 1 These. 4.11. 1 Timothy 5.13. Proverbs 16.12, etc. and 20.1.





1. It blindes reason, and makes men for the present as though they were
distract of their wits. It Is a short madness, and in this respect worse; for
that madness is involuntary* but this passion is entered into willingly and
wittingly. Madness is an evil of punishment, but this is an evil of sin: So in
Simeon, and Levi, Genesis 34.25. In David, 1 Samuel 25.13, 22. in Saul, 1 Samuel
22.18, 19. in Theodosius.

2. As it springs from, so it causes infidelity, and fretting against God, as
in Moses, Numb. 20.10, etc. Prove. 19.3. 2 Samuel 6.8.

3. It extinguisheth the love of God, which cannot kindle in such an unquiet
breast. How should we love God whom we have not seen, if we love not our
neighbor whom we have seen, 1 John 4.20.

4. It Is an hindrance of holy prayer. An angry man cannot call upon God, or if
he should, God would not hear. Hence, Psalm. 26.6. 1 Timothy 2.8. Mat. 5.23. and
6.12, 14, 15. 1 Pet. 3.7.

5. It makes the Word of God unprofitable: Hence, Jam. 1.19. Be swift to hear,
slow to wrath. It hardens the heart that the Word cannot take root.

6. It so fills, and swells the mind that there is no room for good thoughts,
and meditations, it is so full of thoughts of revenge, etc. so that it stops
communion with God, and disturbs the peace of conscience.

7. It makes men impatient of admonition, which is ordained by God as one means
to recover us from sin: so in Abner when justly reproved, 2 Samuel 3.8.

8. It grieves the Spirit of God, and lets the Devil into men's hearts, to whose
image they are conformed by unjust anger, Ephesians. 4.27.30, 31.

9. It disfits a man for society. Hence, Prove. 22.24, 25. make no friendship
with an angry man, etc.

10. It macerates, and vexes the soul with fury, so that they become
self-tormentors; Rage, and fury, tortures more then wrong, and injury.

11. It exposes to infinite dangers, by provoking men to enter into private
quarrels so as wholly to neglect themselves, that they may hurt their enemies:
Like the Be that loses her life to sting others. It often ruins the body;
some being extraordinarily moved have broken their veins, and vomited out their
souls with their blood. Others have fallen into mortal diseases, as Apoplexies,
frenzies, madness, palsies, falling sickness, etc. These are its effects in
regard of our selves; now in regard of our neighbors.

1. It overthrows all friendship: for there was never friendship so inviolable,
but anger has dissolved it. Hence, Prove. 27.4. Anger is cruel, and wrath
raging: they will fall from words to blows, then to wounds, then to death.

2. Yea, it makes men hurt whom they should most love, as wife, children,
servants, who being necessarily conversant with them, are most exposed to their
fury.

3. It Is the gate of vice whereby it enters. Hence, Psalm. 37.8. Cease from
anger, leave off wrath, fret not thy self to do evil; so Prove. 29.22. A furious
man abounds in transgressions: so Jam. 1.20.

The effects of anger which are caused by others as a deserved punishment of
it, are,

1, It subjects a man to the wrath of God, and brings his curse upon him, Mat.
6.14, 15. Hence Job 5.2. Prove. 19.19. Mat. 5.22.

2. Such are a prey to Satan, whilst they plot, and devise that mischief which
pleases him; and when once by passion he has blinded the eye of reason, he
can easily lead us into all wickedness. As Crows first pick out the sheeps
eyes, and then prey upon them.

3. It brings contempt from men, whence by it they blaze abroad their folly,
whereas wisdom procures honor and respect.

4.. An angry man lies open to the malice, fraud and violence of his adversary:
For having no power over his passion when provoked, he rusheth himself
headlong into danger, not caring what he says, or what he does, though
tending to his own prejudice, and to his adversaries advantage.

Prove. 23.26. God calls for the heart, i. e. a heart well drained from sinful
affections; and a Christian may fetch a surer evidence of his spiritual estate
from his reformation herein, then from any particular duty to the affirmative
Commandments of the moral Law.

Object. But I am chollerick by nature and cannot expel it?

Answ. This excuse is no better then Adams fig-leafe to hide the nakedness of
thy sin. It will not excuse us before a temporal Judge to say, we are prone by
nature to such a sin: much less before God, God gave us not such a nature, but
it comes from original sin, therefore we must not excuse one sin with another;
and what serves grace for but to reform nature. If thou be regenerate by
the Holy Ghost, he makes of a Leopard a Lamb, etc. Esaias 11.6, 7.

Object. Though I be somewhat hot for the time, yet it is quickly gone?

Answ. Eccles. 7.9. Be not of an hasty spirit, for anger rests in the bosom of
fools: Many are the mischiefs of sudden anger: as it begins without son, so it
ends without shame, and repentance: Gods children should resemble their
heavenly father, who is slow to anger, Exodus 34.6, 7.

Object. I say nothing in my passion, what would you have me do?

Answ. Concealed anger, (if nourished in the heart, and hidden to have a better
opportunity for revenge, or being dissembled for credits sake) is worse then
professed anger. First, in respect of the party that is angry, because
turbulent affections kept in, torment the more, like a raging fire that has no
vent, or a violent stream that is stopped. Secondly, in respect of the person
with whom we are angry; because it makes him less wary, and more secure. Hence
a secret enemy is more dangerous then a professed enemy: Prove. 12.20. and
14.17. as we see in. Caine, Genesis 4.8. In Absolon, 2 Samuel 13.22, 23. in Joab, 2 Samuel 20.9. in Judas, Luke 22.47.

Object. But he has often offended me; I can bear no longer.

Answ. Love covers a multitude of sins, Prove. 11.12. we must forgive to seventy
times seven times, Mat. 18.22. as David did to Saul; Joseph to his brethren.

Object. But except God give us the gift of patience we can never put up
injuries contentedly?

Answ. Such would have God do all, and will do nothing themselves: For if they
sincerely desired the grace of patience, they would use Gods means to get it.

Quest. But by what means is corrupt anger to be subdued, and mortified?

Answ. First, faith, as it moderates all passions, so this of sinful anger:

1. By stamping Gods image of goodness, patience, and long-suffering upon the
soul: A man cannot have fellowship with God by faith, but he shall be like him:
Faith teaches us to imitate our heavenly father, as Exodus 34.6. Psalm. 103.8, 9.
see his long-suffering, 1 Pet. 3.19* 20. Ezekiel. 4.5. therefore Col. 3.12. Look
upon Christ's example, and imitate him.

2. By acknowledging the providence of God, without which the least injury
could not befall us: the least being a portion of that cup which Gods hand
reaches out to us: So in Job, chap. 1.21. in Joseph, Genesis 50.20. in David, 2 Samuel 16.10, 11. This persuasion that all our sufferings come from God, is a
forcible motive to patience. For 1. It constraines us to confess that all our
chastisements are just, yea, less then our sins deserved, being but light and
momentany: we have cause therefore to admire Gods goodness in such gentle
rods, rather then to be angry at them. 2. It teaches that the manner of Gods
dealing is exceeding tender, and compassionate, Psalm. 25.10. when we deserve to
be cast into hell fire, he does only lop and prune to make us more fruitful,
therefore we have more cause to be thankful then to be offended. 3. It shows
that God in his infinite wisdom will dispose of every thing for our good, as
he has promised, Romans 8.28. why then should we be angry, seeing God will turn
the injuries of men into blessings? say therefore with Christ, John 18.11.
shall I not drink of the cup, etc. 4. It acknowledges the present course that
God takes to be best, and most behooful for us: For God is wisest, and his
prescriptions most safe and healthful: we have therefore no reason to be angry
unless we will fight against God.


3. It looks up to Christ, and imprints the virtues of his death upon the soul:
He that believes in Christ crucified, is made like unto Christ in love,
meekness, and all other graces that he manifested in his death. For it thus
pleads; Christ endured scoffs, reproaches, railings, revilings, buffetings,
scourgings, yea, and death it self: not for any demerit of his but for our
sakes; and shall we grudge to suffer small injuries from men at our Savior
Christ's request, seeing we have deserved far greater?

4. It submits to the absolute sovereignty of the Lord, and will not encroach
upon his Prerogative Royal: Now all revenge is Gods right, and he has not
given it to man, Romans 12.19. A private man in the Commonwealth may not usurp
the place of a Judge, nor a servant of a Master: much less may a Christian, by
revenging his own quarrel in word or deed, intrude himself into Gods office.

5. Faith works humility, and lowliness, and banisheth self-love, and pride:
For it minds a man of his sin, and the desert thereof: and that whatsoever good
he enjoys, he holds as an alms of grace; whatsoever he suffers, he
acknowledges less then his desert, and a just chastisement of love, and
therefore is patient.

6. It raises the heart to an earnest desire of spiritual things, and treads
under feet all vain and transitory things, and therefore a believer is not
much disquieted when he is crossed in them. As the upper region of the air is
not molested with wind, rain, hail, etc. so a heavenly minded Christian is
lifted up far above these sublunary things, and cannot be afflicted with them.

7. Faith begets soundness of spirit, and Christian hardiness: But a sound
mind is not easily disturbed with wrongs that are offered, no more then sound
flesh is when handled.

8. It seeks the approbation of God, but is not vainly inquisitive what others
think, or speak, or do; whereas he that basely enquireth what is said against
him in every company, disquiets himself with anger, and makes his faults more
public.

9. It acquaints us with the common frailties of all mankind; discovers the
filthiness of original sin which has infected all the sons of Adam: It puts
us in mind how often we have provoked God, and offended our brethren, the
remembrance whereof is a great curb to carnal anger, seeing we do many things
that need pardon both from God and man.

10. It kindles in us just indignation against our own sins, which restraines
carnal anger from breaking out against others: For he that is zealous against
his own sins, has no leisure to quarrel with others for petty wrongs and
injuries.

11. Faith proceeds with counsel and deliberation: It considers before it
judge, and judges before it proceed to execution: It defers to censure till
time has revealed the truth.

12. Faith works by love, which is of more force to restrain us from revenge,
then injury to provoke unto ange^: For love suffers long, yea, suffers all
things, 1 Corinthians. 13.4, 7. It makes us look upon him with whom we are angry as
a brother: To remember that we would have other men to forgive us when we wrong
them, and therefore we must do the like.

13. It Is the property of faith to receive the whole Word, and to diffuse the
saving virtue thereof into every power of the soul, which changes us in to the
nature of it self: But the Word requires meekness, long-suffering, and
patience: the Word is compared to leaven that leaveneth the whole lump.

14. Faith obtains of God by prayer the spirit of meekness whereby our
nature is renewed after the image of God; and our affections sanctified that
they may further Gods glory, the good of our brethren, and our own salvation.

15. It shows the danger of retaining anger which is a high degree of murder.
It shows that the promise of forgiveness is made only to them that forgive,
Matthew. 6. that judgment merciless belongs to them that show no mercy, James
2.13. that with what measure we mete it shall be measured to us, Mat. 18.23.

Quest. What further means may a Christian use to subdue anger?

Answ. First, shun all businesses above thy reach, least being oppressed with
an unsupportable burden, it makes thee froward and teasty.



Prove. 22.24, 25. As one stick kindles many.



Fifthly, take heed of meddling with the strife that belongs not to thee,
Proverbs 26.17. and 29.9.

Sixthly, look often upon the admirable examples of the patience of Gods
Abraham, Genesis 13.8. of Moses, Exodus 17.4, 11. of David, 2 Samuel 16.10. of
Stephen, Act. 7.60. especially of Christ himself, 1 Pet. 2.22.

Quest. But when anger has seized upon us, what means may we use to supplant
it?

Answ. First, yield not obedience to it: believe it not when it would provoke

Secondly, remember that it is a dishonest thing to revenge an injury, Prove.

Thirdly, do not multiply words which are the fuel of anger: we may as well

Fourthly, when angry, make some delay before thou speak, or do any

Fifthly, get out of the company of such as have offended thee, as Jonathan

Tenthly Meditate on the unbounded mercy of God, whose virtues thou must thy
many foul offenses: and will thou not let one drop fall upon thy brother to
forbear, and forgive in trifling wrongs?

Quest. How may we cure anger in others?

Answ. First, if thou live with those that be furious, the best way to win
them to kindness, is for thy self truly to repent of thy sins. For Prove. 16.7.
If a man's ways please the Lord, he will make his enemies to be at peace with
him, Isa. 11.6. etc. He makes the Wolf to feed with the Lamb, etc. the hearts
of men are in his hands, and he turns them as he pleases: as he did Esaus to
Jacob, Genesis 32.9. etc. and 33.4, 5. Remember his Promise, that if we humble our
selves, he will grant us compassion in the sight of them that hated us, 2 Chronicles. 30.9. 1 Kings 8.47, etc. 2 Chronicles. 7.11. etc. Solomon prays for it.

Prove. 26.21. and 30.33. Jam. 3.5, 6. As Cannon-shot loses its force if it
light on earth, or soft wool, but dasheth the stone-wall in pieces: so the
violence of anger is abated, when not resisted: but furiously rages when it
meets with opposition.

Prove. 15.1. and 25.15. Genesis 50.17. Jude 8.1. etc. as milk quenches wild
fire, and oil lime, so does a mild answer anger.

Abigail to David, 1 Samuel 25.24. But this must be done when the heat of anger
is somewhat assuaged, and with mildness and moderation, else it may provoke
more.

Jacobs case with Esau, Genesis 33.3, 4.

Saul's anger against David, 1 Samuel 24.17. and 26.21. Hence Prove. 25.21. If
thine enemy hunger, give him bread, etc. A great fire melts the hardest iron:
so said Jacob, Genesis 32.20. So Prove. 21.14.

Eccl. 1.3. and 10.4.

See Mr. Balls Power of Godliness; Dr. Tailor on Tit. Mr. Bolton, Mr. Rein^r,
and Dr. Harris.

Quest. How are vicious and virtuous anger differenced?

Answ. Chiefly in the object: the virtuous regards the interest of God, the
vicious the interest of a man's self; but both proceed from glory, and have
their motions for the vindication of glory: For a religious anger has for its
motive the glory of God: but the motive of vicious anger is a man's particular
glory, and the resenting of private contempt either true, or imagined. Hence
the proudest men are most choleric, for being great lovers of themselves, and
valuing themselves at a very high rate, they deem the smallest offenses against
them to be unpardonable crimes. But he that knows himself, and apprehends how
small a thing he is, will not think the offenses against him to be very great,
and therefore will not be much moved at them.

Quest. What other causes be there of sinful Anger?

Answ. First, weakness contributes much to it: For though a fit of anger look
like a sally of vigor and courage, yet its the effect of a soft spirit. Great
and strong spirits are patient, but a weak nature can suffer nothing. The wind
stirs leaves and small twigges, seldom the bodies of great trees.

Secondly, all things that make a man tender and wanton, make him also

Thirdly, anger is produced by giving way to the wandering of thoughts,
curiosity,

Fourthly, its sometimes stirred up by contrary causes, as by prosperity and
adversity,

Quest. What are the evil effects of it, the more to make us shun and hate it?

Answ. First, its dreadful, when assisted by power, like an impetuous storm,
that overthrows all that lies in its way: How often has it razed Cities,
ruined Theodosius, (the best of Emperors) slew many thousands of innocents
amongst the nocents in Thessalonica. How many have been massacred by wicked
Princes? and what slaughters would there be in the world, if mean fellows had
as much power as wrath?

Secondly, its dangerous to the angry man himself; for by the overflowing of
the gall, wrath overflows all the faculties of the mind, which discovers it
self

Thirdly, there is no cause so good, but its marred by impetuous anger: The

Fourthly, the wrong done to Piety or Justice, is no just reason for our
immoderate

To which end we must remember, that in the violation of Justice, God is more
interessed then we are, and knows how to punish it when he sees it expedient:
and if God will not punish as yet, our wills must not be more hasty then his,
and it becomes not us to be impatient for our own interest^, when himself is
patient in the wrong done to his own: Let the cause of our anger be never so
holy and just; yet that of James is a perpetual truth, chap. 1.20. The wrath of
man works not the righteousness of God. If it be the cause of God that we
defend, we must not use that good cause to bring forth evil effects, and the
evil of that which incenseth us can hardly be so grievous as the loss of
humanity and right reason, of which a man is deprived by excessive wrath. For
Prove. 27.4. Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous. It rests in the bosom
of fools, Eccl. 7.9.

Prove. 16.32. He that is slow to anger is better then the mighty, and he that
rules his spirit, then he that takes a City: Alexander M. deserves not the name
of a great Conqueror, who was a slave to his anger.

Ob. But I have many provocations from those with whom I must necessarily live,
servants esp^cially, they are so bad, etc?

Answ. Anger is a remedy worse then the disease, and no houshold-disorder is
worth the disordering of our souls with passion. Better were it for us to be
ill served, or not served at all, then to make our servants our Masters, giving
them power of dispossessing us of the Command of our selves, whenever it
pleases them to provoke us to anger. Yet a wise man may express indignation
without anger, making others tremble, himself standing unmoved.

Quest. How may we from seeing anger in others, learn to cure it in our selves?

Answ. First, learn to hate it, and take heed of it, by observing how
imperuous and servile it is together: How ugly, unbecoming, unreasonable and
hurtful it is to others, and more to a man's self.



Lamech did. And from hence let us reflect upon our selves: He that minds well
how wrath betrays a man, and lays open his infirmities, and that a man that
has no rule over his own spirit, is like a City that is broken down, and
without walls, Prove. 25.28. will fence himself against that treacherous
passion, by Christian meekness and moderation, and will learn to be wise by
his neighbors harms: and will observe Christ's Precept, Mat. 11.29. Learn of
me, for I am meek and lowly, etc.

Quest. What is hatred?

Answ. It is an indignation for an injury received or imagined, or for an ill
opinion conceived of a person or action. It differs from anger in this: Anger
is sudden, and has a short course, but hatred is more durable and lasting;
Anger seeks more a man's vindication then the harm of others, but hatred
studies the hurt of his adversary.

Quest. Whence does hatred proceed?

Answ. Its a compound of pride and sadness: and it proceeds out of Ignorance
of ones self, and the price and nature of things: Hence 1 John 2.11. He that
hates his brother is in darkness, and knows not whither he goes, because that
darkness has blinded his eyes; As then blind men are commonly testie: so the
blindness of ignorance makes men prone to hate their neighbors.

Quest. Is there no good use of hatred?

Answ. Yes, First, its naturally good, serving to make us avoid things that

Secondly, its morally good, when we use it to oppose that which is contrary to
the Sovereign good, which is God: For when we hate that which God that we
should love our neighbors as our s^lves. There is indeed an hatred of iniquity
in God against those that oppose his glory, which obliges us also to hate them
with that hatred of iniquity, and to oppose them so long as they oppose God. So
David, Ps. 139.21. Do not I hate them that hate thee, etc? I hate them with a
perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies; But we must take heed lest the
hatred of iniquity, bring a hatred against the person. For to love our enemies,
and to overcome the evil with good, is the most ingenuous imitation of God
himself. Hence Mat. 5.44. Love your enemies, etc. that you may be the children
of your heavenly Father, etc. There is need of a great measure of wisdom, and
grace to observe these two Precepts together, Psalm. 97.10. Ye that love the
Lord hate evil; and Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, Mat. 22.39.
Hating iniquity in the wicked, and loving their persons, and both for Gods sake.

Quest. What is the chief use of hatred?

Answ. It is to be incited to good by the hatred of evil; For which end it is
not necessary that the greatness of hatred, equal the greatness of the evil:
We are not obliged to hate evil things as much as they deserve; for then the
great current of our affections would run into the channel of hatred, and leave
the channel of love dry: whereas the hatred of evil is not requisite of it self
but by accident, as a consequence of the love of good: For if the hatred of
vice persuade us to virtue, we shall be yet more persuaded to it by the love o^
goodness.

Quest. What are the effects of hatred, which may make it hateful?

Answ. First, many of them are the same with the effects of anger: For

Secondly, all the destructions in the world, wherein man's Will is an Agent*
are immediately wrought by hatred: For though they may have remote causes of

Thirdly, unto hatred all the cruelty of Tyranny, and malice must be imputed:
John 4.20. If a man say he loves God, and hates his brother, he is a liar.

Fourthly, hatred is a bitter venom, which being once diffused, and soaked
into the soul, turns a man into an Hell-fury: makes him contrary to all good,

Fifthly, its often seen that whilst men consume themselves with hatred of
David hoped, Psalm. 109.28. Let them curse, but bless thou.

Quest. What means may we use to prevent, or cure hatred?

Answ. Consider that hatred is conceived for one of these two ends.







Secondly, calmly consider whether the revenge may not do us more harm Heb.
10.30.





Fifthly, when another offends thee, remember tha^ thou have offended others:

Lords Prayer.

Ira mortalium debet esse mortalis.

for the most part this is but a pretense, whereby we cozen our selves, and
others to palliate personal hatred. If we take Gods cause sincerely in hand, we
must conform our selves to his Will and Wisdom, expecting till he send his
Messenger, Death, to attach, and bring the wicked before his Tribunal, Psalm.
37.8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Fret not thy self in any wise to do
evil, for evil doers shall be cut off, v. 10. yet a little while, and the
wicked shall not be. If we hate wickedness, we may be sure that God hates it
more, and will punish it: but in his own time, to satisfy his Justice, not our
humors; Certainly, if we hated iniquity in good earnest, we would hate it more
in our selves. If our enemies be wicked, we must love them for Gods sake, and
for our own, because we also are subject to the like infirmities. Dr. Peter du
Moulin of governing the Passions.

Quest. How is immoderate anger a sin?

Answ. First, in regard of the impulsive cause of it, when a man is excessively
Mat. 5.22.

Secondly, in regard of the degree and measure of it; when, though we have a
just Genesis 49.7.

Thirdly, in regard of the end, when it is not directed to Gods glory, and
Prove. 13.10. and 21.24. and 28.25.

Fourthly, in regard of the direct effects of it: as when we break out into
curses, Ps. 106.33.

Fifthly, in regard of the indirect effects of it, as when we thereby lose the
use of our reason, Prove. 16.32. Luke 21.19. or when it works not the
righteousness

CHAP. X. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Anger in God.
Quest. WHat is anger in God.

Answ. It Is the inward displeasure which he has against sin, and his purpose
to punish it, accompanied with threatenings upon his purpose, and execution upon
his threatenings.

Quest. How may it be proved that there is anger in God?

Answ. First, by his judgments executed upon sinners: as upon the lapsed
Angels: the old world: Sodom and Gomorrah: the ten Tribes: the two

Secondly, by his threatenings against sin, Isaiah 63.6. Job

Thirdly, by the Saints complaining of it, and praying against it, as Psalm.
6.1. and and 74.1. and 90.11.

Quest. Why is there anger in God?

Answ. First, because of that antipathy which is in him against sin, as it is
contrary

Secondly, Sin is the only object of Gods anger, though foolish persons make a
Adam was cast out of Paradise, Genesis 3.23. the old wo^ld destroyed, Genesis 6.13. 2
Pet. 3.12. yea, it made God in a sort angry with his own dear son, so that he
cried out, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me, Mat. 27.46. and if God
showed anger against sin by punishing it in our Surety, Christ, who was made
sin for us, and yet had no sin in himself: what will become of wicked and
ungodly sinners.

Quest, Why are judgments called Gods anger?

Answ. Because they issue from his anger: For its not the judgments, but the
anger in them which lies heavy upon the soul: whereas when we suffer ill,
knowing that it is not from anger, but for trial of our graces, or for exercise
of them we take it patiently. Hence, Deuteronomy. 28.27. The Lord will smite thee with
the botch of Egypt, and with the Emrods, and with the scab, and with the itch,
whereof thou can not be healed: What is a scab, or the itch (which now are so
light set by) such a terrible judgment? O yes, when it comes with Gods
displeasure: what is it that blows the coals of hell, and makes that fire so
hot, but Gods anger? Isa. 30.33.

Quest. How will it appear that Gods anger is so terrible?

Answ. First, we may see it in the earnestness of David's suit to have Gods
wrathful countenance turned away from his sins, and from him because of his
sins, Psalm. 51.9. As also in that of the Church, Psalm. 85.4, 5. Turn us O God
of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease: Will thou be angry
with us for ev^r? will thou draw out thine anger to all generations? etc.

Psalm. 76.7. Thou, even thou art to be feared, and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry. Psalm. 18.7. The earth shook and trembled: the
foundations of the hills also moved, and were shaken because he was wroth.
Psalm. 2.12. and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled, yea but a
little. It was time for Moses to call upon Aaron to make haste, and go quickly
to make an atonement, when there was wrath gone out from the Lord, Numb.
16.46. It Is called Gods fierce wrath, Jer. 3.9. his sore displeasure, Psalm.
2.5. Oh! rebuke me not in thine anger, says David, Psalm 6.1. He cared not
what God laid upon him, so it were not in anger.

Heb. 12.29. Our God is a consuming fire, Heb. 10.31. It Is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God.

To offer up prayers, and supplications with strong crying, and tears, to be
saved from that which he feared, Heb. 5.7.

See Mr. Hieron. on Psalm. 51.

Quest. What means then may we use to divert this fierce anger of God?

Answ. Repentance is the best means we can use to pacify Gods displeasure.
When the Lord has threatened many grievous judgments, and plagues for sin
one upon the neck of another, denounced with variety of expressions in the most
terrible manner, yet after all that terrible thundering. See Deuteronomy. 30.1, etc. It
follows: It shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee, the
blessings, and the curses which I have set before thee, and thou shall call
them to mind amongst all the Nations whither the Lord thy God has driven
thee, and shall return unto the Lord thy God, etc. that then the Lord thy God
will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, etc. Not that
repentance is the meritorious cause of pardon, but God will have an order in
things: where there is no sense of sin, and humiliation, with prayer for
pardon, and reformation, trusting in God for mercy, there the anger of God
abides still. Again, 2 Chro. 7.14. If my people that are called by my Name
shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked
ways: I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and heal their land:
and no marvel; for he is gracious, and a sin-pardoning God, Exodus 34.6, 7. so
Ezekiel. 18. and chapter 33. Manasses was a very great sinner, being enabled by his
authority to do the greater mischief, yet upon his humiliation, and prayer, he
found mercy, 2 Chronicles. 33.12, 13. so in the Prodigal, Luke 15.20. David, Psalm.
32.3, 4. confesses that whilst he neglected repentance, Gods hand was heavy
upon him, so that his moisture was turned into the drought of Summer, etc. But
when he confessed; God forgave the iniquity of his sin.

Quest. Why is repentance such an effectual means to divert anger?

Answ. Because it is Gods nature so to do: His nature is more inclined to mercy
then to anger. For God to be angry, its upon the supposition of our sins; but
to be merciful, it always proceeds from his own bowels. Micah 7.18. Who is a
God like unto thee, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgressions
of the remnant of his heritage: He retains not his anger for ever, because he
delights in mercy. What comes naturally, comes easily, without pain, as beams
from the Sun, water from the spring, heat from the fire: Hence, Psalm. 9.10.
They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee, for thou Lord have not
forsaken them that seek thee.

Quest. How can Gods anger be said to be turned away from his children, when
yet oft-times they find the effects of it in the course of their lives?

Answ. There is a double anger in God, 1. Vindicative. 2. Fatherly.


Now God after our first conversion removes his vindicative anger from us:
after which, though he sometimes threatens and frowns upon us, yet it is with a
Fatherly anger: and this is that which God removes, together with the shame,
and correction attending it, when we repent of our sins, and reform our ways. Or

There is A child of anger. A child under anger.
Now Gods children after their conversion are never children of wrath, and
anger, though sometime, they be children under anger, if they make bold with
sin: so that then, though they have the right of Sons, yet they cannot make use
of it, to go boldly to the Throne of grace, conceiving God to be angry with
them, and so continue till they humble themselves, and reform their ways: God
was so angry with Moses that he suffered him not to go into the land of Canaan,
Numb. 20.12. so he was with David when he had numbered the people. 2 Samuel 24.1.
and with the Corinthians for their unworthy receiving the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11.30. These were all children under wrath, but not
children of wrath.

Quest. How may we know Gods anger to be removed, when yet we ^ndure the
afflictions?

Answ. God is infinitely wise, and in afflicting has many excellent ends: as

First, when he afflicts us, it is to correct us for our sins* after which when
we have

Secondly, affliction sometimes is only for the exercise of our faith, and
patience,

See Dr. Sibs his returning Back-slider.

Quest. How is God said to be angry with his children? Isa. 64.5.

Answ. Gods anger toward his children does not exclude them out of his love,
seeing it is not the anger of an enemy, but of a gracious father, who is not
angry with their persons to destroy them, but with their sins to convert and
save them. As children by their miscarriages may anger their parents, and
provoke them to frown upon them, yea, sharply to correct them, and yet at the
same time their parents entirely love them, and seek their amendment: So Gods
children, when they sin, provoke him to anger, and are said to be out of his
favor, not that God changes his fatherly affections, or purposes utterly to
reject them: but only changes the effects of his love, into effects of hatred
by suffering them to be vexed with terrors of consciences, and outwardly
scourges them with temporary afflictions, not out of hatred to their persons,
whom he has once loved in Christ, and therefore for ever loves them: but for
hatred of their sins, and love to their persons whom by this means he brings to
repentance, and reformation of their ways.

Quest. What is anger in God?

Answ. The ancient Fathers do unanimously agree that anger in God is nothing
but the Divine revenge or punishment that he inflicts for sin: For there are no
perturbations, or troubled affections in God as there are in men: Hence St.
Austin says, Ira Dei non est perturbatio concitati animi, sed tranquilla
constitutio justi supplicii. And again, Cum irasci dicitur Deus, non
significatur perturbatio, qualis est in animo irascentis hominis: sed ex
humanis motibus vindicta ejus irae nomen accepit: So then Gods anger being
nothing but his revenge or punishment that he inflicts for sin, it must needs
follow that the anger of God is always provoked by sin: so Genesis 6.11. with
17. and 18.20. Job. 31.3.

Quest. Why does God pour out his anger upon sinners?

Answ. First, because of his justice: for though God be not delighted with our
suffering, yet he is delighted with his own justice, according to which
punishment is due to sin. It is not evil therefore in God to punish wicked men,
because it proceeds from his love of justice. But its evil for men to deserve
punishment, because it proceed from the love of wickedness.

Austin says, Quicquid Divinitus ante ultimum judicium vindicatur, non ad
interitum hominum, sed ad medicinam valere credendum est. Neither will it
weaken this argument to say, that wicked men are so far from being warned by
their punishments to avoid sin, as that they are hardened by them to the
aggravation of their condemnation: because notwithstanding this, they have this
profitable effect on the godly; For by the punishment of fools wise men are
reformed. As Cyprian says; supplicia imprudentium prudentibus conferunt
sanitatem.

Aquinas says rightly. Aequum and ordinatum est, ut qui contra voluntatem
Divinam percipere voluit peccati voluptatem, ut contra voluntatem propriam
cogatur experiri supplicii acerbitatem. It Is but just and equal that those
which will needs solace themselves with the pleasures of sin contrary to the
will of God, should taste of the bitterness of punishment contrary to their
own wills.

D. Daunant on Col.

CHAP. XI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about some of the Antinomian
Errors.
Quest. THe Antinomians say* That through the bloodshed and righteousness of
Christ in their free Justification. God sees no sin in them, and therefore they
should see no sin in themselves; Or if they do see it with the eye of Reason,
yet they should not see it with the eye of faith.

Quest. Is this true Doctrine?

Ans. No; for the blood of Christ was never shed to destroy all sense and sight
of sin in believers. But he died rather to make them sensible of their sins:
For he died to save his people from their sins, 1 John 3.5. Tit. 3.14. but by
the sight of sin they come to be weaned from it, and so saved out of it: and
hence it is, that the greatest and deepest spirit of mourning for sin is poured
out upon believers, when God has poured upon them the Spirit of grace, Zach.
12.10, 11. and godly sorrow works repentance, etc. 2 Cor. 7.10. The blood of
Christ which was shed for the killing of sin, makes them sensible of their sin,
with the aggravations of it, being now not only against the Law of God, but
against the blood and love of the Son of God. The contrary doctrine is very
false and pernicious.

Quest. Whether is the Law given as a Rule to believers under the Gospel?

Answ. Yea, as may be proved by these Arguments.

First, if sin be the transgression of the Law, as the Apostle affirms it to
be, John 3.4. then a believer is bound to attend the Law as his rule, that so
he may not transgress it: as David did, Psalm. 119.11. For whosoever makes
conscience of sin, cannot but make conscience of observing the rule: and they
which lay aside the rule, cannot make conscience of sin, which is downright
Atheism and Profaneness. P^rquius, a great Libertine in Calvin's time, makes
this only to be sin, viz. to see, know, or feel sin, and that the great sin of
man is to think that he does sin, and that the old man is put off by not seeing
sin. But these are liars, 1 John 1.8, 10.

Secondly, a true believer, though he cannot keep the Law perfectly as his
cries out with the Apostle, Romans 7.12. The Law is holy and good, though I am
carnal: He loves his Copy, though he can but scribble after it.

Paul would never have persuaded them to love upon this ground, Because its the
fulfilling of the Law, Gal. 5.13, 14.

Ob. But the Law written in the heart and the spirit, is the rule of life:
therefore not the written Law?

Answ. First, the Law written in the heart, is called a Law, not in respect of
perfect direction, (which is essential to the rule) but in respect of ^ighty
and effectual operation, (...) being a power in it as of a strong Law
effectually, and sweetly compelling ^o ^he obedience of the Law.



1. That the Spirit enclines the heart to the obedience of the rule.

2. It illuminates the mind many times to see it by secret shinings of
preventing, as well as brings things to remembrance which we knew before.

3. It acts them also sometimes: as when we know not what to pray, it prompts
us. Romans 8.26. when we know not what to speak before our adversaties, it gives
it in to us, M^t. 10.19 when we know not whither or how to go, its a voice
behind us, and leads us to the fountain of living waters, Isa. 30.21. Rev.
7.17. But all these quickening acts proves it not to be a rule by which we
ought to walk, but only by means of which we come to walk, and are inclined,
directed, and enabled to walk according to the rule.

Isa. 8.20. John 5.39. For which the men of Bereah were commended, Act^ 17.11.

Ob. The diff^r^nce between the Old and New Testament is this: That of Moses
was a Ministry from without, but that of Christ from within, and therefore the
letter of the Scriptures is not a Law to a Christian, but the Law written in
their hearts, etc?

Answ. If this be the difference between the dispensation of the Old and New
Testament Ministry, then we may all burn our Bibles as useless: and then its
a marvel why the Apostles preached, or why they wrote the Gospel for
aftertimes; that men mi^ht believe, etc. as it is, John 20.31. 1 John 5.13.
For either their writing and preaching was not an external Ministry, which is
contrary to sense: or it was not Christ's Ministry, which is blasphemous:
whereas Christ in the Spirit, leads us to Christ in the letter; the Spirit
within to the Word without, by which we shall be judged at the last day, John
12.48. and therefore certainly we are to be regulated by it now.

Ob. But the faithful receive an Unction of the Spirit, which teaches them all
things?

Answ. This teaching is either immediate or mediate: If immediate, why does St.
John tell them that he writ to them, that they might hereby know that they had
eternal life, 1 John 5, 13. But if mediate, to wit, by the Word externally
preached, or writ, then that external word is still to be our rule, which the
anointing of the Spirit helps us to know: when therefore he says, 1 John 2.27.
that being taught of the Spirit, they need not that any man should teach them,
he speaks not of the immediate teaching of the Spirit, but explains his meaning
in the words following; Ye need not that any man should teach you, (i. e.
otherwise, or after another manner of way then the Spirit taught them) but as
the anointing teaches you all things, and is truth. For if Ministers are to
preach in demonstration of the Spirit, then they that hear them, and are taught
by them, need no man to teach them otherwise, then as the same spirit in the
same demonstration teaches them all things. As therefore the Spirit leads us
to the Word, so the Word leads us to the Spirit, but never to a spirit without
or beyond the Word, whereby the outward administration in the Word, or letter
should cease, when the inward administration of Christ in the Spirit comes.

Ob. We are not to be led or guided by any outward commands in our obedience
unto God, because God is to work all our works for us, and we are not to live,
but Christ is to live in us?

Answ. Its vain to think that we are not to look at any Promises, because
Christ is to accomplish all Promises for us: If the question therefore be, by
what we are to live? the Apostles answer is full, Gal. 2, 19, 20. We are to
live by the faith of the Son of God: But if the question be, According to what
rule are we to live; the answer is given by David, Psalm. 119.4, 5. Thou have
commanded us to keep thy Precepts diligently, etc. So v. 17.77. If any demand
what is the rule of faith by which we live? Answ. The Gospel, Phil. 3.16. But
if you demand, what is the rule of life it self? Answ. The Moral Law, and of
this is the controversy.

Ob. But we are neither subject to the Law, nor to sin: Because all things both
good and evil come from Gods Will, and all things that are done are wrought by
him, and all that he does is good, and therefore all sinful actions are good,
because he works them?

Answ. The commanding Will of God, called Voluntas mandati, is to be our Rule,
and not the working Will of God, called Voluntas decreti; For we cannot sin by
fulfilling the one, but we may sin in fulfilling the other: Gods secret, and
working Will was fulfilled when Joseph's brethren sold him into Egypt, and when
the Babylonians afflicted Israel seventy years, and when the Jews caused
Christ to be crucified, yet in all these they sinned, and provoked God against
them, Acts 4.28. Gods Will is his own rule to work by, not ours: and therefore
Samuel convinced Saul, when he spared Agag, that his disobedience against Gods
command, was rebellion, and as the sin of witchcraft, though therein he
fulfilled the decree of God, 1 Samuel 15.23.

Fourthly, a fourth Argument to prove that the Law is our tule, is this: If the
love of Christ is to lead us, then the commands of Christ (wherein he discovers

Object. The Law indeed requires doing, but not the Gospel, and therefore
Believers that are under the Gospel are under no Law of doing?

Answ. As the Gospel requires ^o doing that thereby we may be just, so it
requires doing also when by Christ Jesus we are made just: For it commands us
to be holy as God is holy, 1 Pet. 1.15. and perfect as our heavenly Father is
perfect, Mat. 5.48. The Law and Gospel require the same perfection of
holiness, only here is the difference, the Law requires it that thereby we
may be made just, and therefore accepts of nothing but perfection: but the
Gospel requires it, because we are already perfectly just in Christ: Hence
though it commands as much as the Law, yet it accepts of less, even the least
measure of sincerity, though mixed with the greatest measure of imperfection.

Object. A Believer has repented in Christ, and mortified sin in Christ: so
that mortification, and vivification is nothing but a b^lieving that Christ
has mortified sin for us, and been quickened for us, and sanctification that is
inherent in Christ, and not in us, is the evidence of our justification?

Answ. First, this principle confounds a Christians justification, and
sanctification, basis refusing to do any duty, or conform to any Law in our own
persons; and it will follow, that as the perfection of Christ's righteousness
to our justification, should make us abhor any righteousness of our own to our
justification: so if we be perfectly sanctified in Christ, then perfection of
Christ's righteousness to our sanctification, should make a believer not only
renounce the Law, but abhor all personal righteousness through the spirit to
our sanctification: and then a Believer must abhor to seek any love, or fear
of God in his heart, which directly is an inlet to all manner of prophannesse.

Cor. 1.30. but not materially, and formally, but virtually, meritoriously, and
(with meet explications) exemplarily. Our righteousness to our justification
is inherent in him, but our sanctification is inherent in our selves, though
derived from him: Hence we are never commanded to justify our selves, unless
it be instrumentally, and Sacramentally, but we are commanded by faith to wash
ourselves, Isa. 1.18. Act. 22.16. we are exhorted to repent, to believe, to
mortify our earthly members, to walk in newness of life, etc. because these
things are wrought in us by Christ to our sanctification, but not wrought in
Christ for us as our righteousness to our justification.

Object. They that are in Christ are said to be complete in him, Col. 2.10. and
that they receive all grace from his fullness, John 1.16. therefore they have
no grace in themselves; but its first in him, and consequently their
sanctification is perfected in him?

Ans. Though the perfection and fullness of grace is first in Christ, yet
believers have not all in him after one, and the same manner, nor for the same
end: For our righteousness to our justification is so in him as never to be
inherent in us, neither here, nor in heaven; but our righteousness to our
sanctification is so far in him as it is to be derived to us, and hence it is
formally in us, but virtually and meritoriously in him.

Object. A Christian must do what is commanded, but not by virtue of the
command, for the spirit will bind their hearts to the Law, but they are not
bound by any authority of the Law to the directions thereof; For the Spirit
(say they) is free, and they are under the government of the Spirit, which is
not to be controlled by any Law?

Answ. If their meaning be that a believer is not bound by the commanding power
of any Law to conform thereunto, only the spirit will conform their hearts to
it, so that perhaps they shall do the thing which the Law requires, but not
because the Law commands it, then it will follow, that in case a believer fall
into any sin: as whoredom, drunkenness, murder, etc. these wicked acts though
they be sins in themselves; yet they are not so to him, because he is now free
from the Law, and not bound to obedience by virtue of any command, and where
there is no Law, there is no transgression.

Object. The Law is our rule as it was given by Christ, and not as it was given
by Moses?

Answ. The Law may be considered, either materially, as it contains the matter
of the Covenant of Works, and thus a believer is not to be regulated by it: or
it may be considered finally, or rather relatively, as it stood in relation to
the people of the God of Abraham, who were already under Abraham's covenant,
which was a Covenant of Grace, Genesis 17.7. And so the Law as it was given by
Moses, was given by Christ in Moses: Hence it is that the Law of love commanded
by Moses is called the Law of Christ, Gal. 6.2. therefore we must not set
Christ, and Moses together by the ears.

Object. The written Law is not to be a Christians rule, but so far as its
written in the heart?

Answ. This is a cursed assertion: For did not Christ himself resist tentations
to sin by cleaving to the written word, Mat 4.4, 10. and was not this done for
our imitation: So David, and Christ delighted to do Gods Will, because it was
so written of them, Psalm. 40.7, 8. Paul exhorts children to obedience, because
it is the first Commandment with promise, Ephesians. 6.2. Paul preached what was in
the Old Testament, Acts 22.20. what is it but Popery to make the spirit within
to be the supreme Judge, and superior to the Spirit of God in the written Word
without? The grace of God appearing in the Gospel will have us to walk worthy
of God in all well-pleasing according to the Law, Tit. 2.12, 13. and to mourn
bitterly that we are so unlike the will, and image of God revealed in the Law,
Romans 7.23, 24.

Object. Paul speaks of a Law written and engraven in stone, and therefore of
the Moral Law, which yet he says is abolished by Christ in the Gospel? 2 Cor.
3.6, 7, 11, 13.

Answ. The meaning of this place, as also Gal. 3.25. is, that the Apostle
speaking of the moral Law by a Synecdoche, comprehends the ceremonial Law also,
both which the false Teachers urged as necessary to salvation, and
justification, at least together with Christ, against whom the Apostle here
disputes: The moral Law therefore is abolished, First, as thus accompanied with
a yoke of ceremonies. Secondly, as it was formerly dispensed, the greater light
of the Gospel obscuring that lesser light of the Law, as ver. 10. Thirdly, he
may speak of the moral Law as a Covenant of life, which the false Teachers
urged, in which respect he calls it a Ministry of death, and a letter which
kills; and thus its abolished by Christ, that with open face we may behold
the glory of the Lord, as the end of the Law for righteousness to every one
that does believe.

Object. The Gospel under which Believers are, requires no doing, for doing is
proper to the Law, which promises life, and requires conditions; But the Gospel
promises to work the conditions, but requires none, and therefore a believer
now is fully free from the Law?

Answ. The Gospel and the Law are taken two ways. 1. Largely, the Law is taken
for the whole doctrine contained in the Old Testament, and the Gospel for the
whole doctrine of Christ, and the Apostles in the New Testament. 2. Strictly,
the Law pro lege operum: for the Law of Works: the Gospel, pro lege fidei: for
the Law of faith: The Law of Works is strictly taken for that Law which
promises Gods favor, and life upon condition of doing, or of personal
obedience: the Law of faith is strictly taken for that doctrine which reveals
remission of sins, and reconciliation with God by Christ's righteousness only,
apprehended by faith: Now the Gospel in this latter sense excludes all works,
and requires no doing in point of justification, but only believing: but take
it largely for the whole doctrine of Gods love, and free grace, and so the
Gospel requires doing: For as it is an act of Gods free grace to justify us
without calling for our works: so it is an act of the same free grace to require
works of a justified person, to serve him in righteousness, and holiness all
the days of our lives, Tit. 2.14. and to think that the Gospel requires no
conditions, is a dream against multitudes of Scriptures, which contains
conditional, yet evangelical promises. There are indeed no conditions required
of us in the Gospel, but what the Lord himself has, or shall work in us: but
it does not therefore follow that no conditions are required of us; for
requiring the condition is the means to work it, and the means and end should
not be separated: As Christ's righteousness must go before as the matter, or
moving cause of our justification: so faith must go before this righteousness,
as an instrument, or applying cause of it by which we are justified: It Is true,
God justifies the ungodly. But not immediately without faith, but mediately by
faith, Romans 4.5. when the Apostle affirms that we are justified by faith
without works, he does hereby plainly give that to faith which he denies to
Works: so then as he denies works to be the antecedent condition of our
justification, so he affirms the contrary of faith which goes before our
justification. Believe, and live.

Object. There is no sin now but unbelief, which is a sin against the Gosp^l
only; therefore there being no sin against any Law, Christ having abolished it
by his death, the Law cannot be our rule?

Answ. Are drunkenness, whoredom, theft, etc. then no sins to be repented of,
or watched against, but only unbelief? will not the Lord judge men, not only
for unbelief, but for all the works done in the body, as Romans 2.16. 2 Cor. 5.10
Is not the wrath of God revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness, etc?
Romans 1.18. If there were no sin but unbelief, how can all flesh, Jews and
Gentiles become guilty before God, that so they may believe the Gospel? as Romans
3, 21, etc. if they be all guiltless till unbelief comes in? No sin indeed
shall condemn a man if he believe, but it will not hence follow that there is
no sin but unbelief; sin is before unbelief comes: a sick sinner, before an
healing Savior: sin kills the soul, as it were, naturally, unbelief, morally:
No sin shall condemn us if we believe: but it does not hence follow that there
is no sin before, or after faith, because there is no condemning sin, unless
we fall by unbelief.

Object. But now to preach the Law savours of an Old Testament spirit, which
was wont to wound, then to heal, to humble, and then to raise: But now we are
to be Ministers of the New Testament, and no Law is to be heard of?

Answ. Indeed to preach the Law as the means of our justification, and as the
matter of our righteousness without Christ, or together with Christ, as they
did, 2 Cor. 3.6. is a Ministry of the letter, not of the Spirit: But to preach
Christ plainly, as the end of the Law, and to preach the Law, as the means to
prepare for, and advance Christ in our hearts is no Old Testament Ministry,
neither does it put a veil upon men's hearts that they cannot see the end of
the Law, as 2 Cor. 3.14. but it takes away the vail of all conceit of man's own
strength, and righteousness by seeing his curse, that so he may fly to
Christ, and embrace him for righteousness.

Object. Indeed the children of the Old Testament were under the Law as their
Schoolmaster to lead them to Christ, Gal. 3.24, 25. But now (says the
Apostle) we are no longer under this Schoolmaster?

Answ. Be it so that the sons of God are now no longer under the terror of
this Schoolmaster, is it not therefore a Ministers work to preach the Law unto
the slaves of sin?

Object. No, but we must say: Thou poor drunkard, etc. here is a God that has
loved thee, and a Christ to die for thee: here is salvation by him only,
because thou art a sinner, fear not; thou art free from dam^ation, Christ died
for thee.

Answ. Is a poor drunkard, a villain that never believed in a state of
condemnation? Romans 8.1. Paul says, there is no condemnation to them that are
in Christ, but where are they freed that are out of Christ? who are by nature
the children of wrath whilst dead in sin, Ephesians. 2.1, etc. much less are such
to believe because they are such: Are not such Ministers therefore that preach
this doctrine like the false Prophets, Isa. 48. ult. and 57. ult. that cry,
peace, peace, when God says there is no peace to the wicked? and says not
Christ, John 3. ult. He that believes not, the wrath of God abides on him: It
was upon him before, and when he believes not, it abides still on him. Must the
Ministers of the New Testament preach lies, and tell drunkards and villains,
before they reject the Gospel by unbelief, that the Lord loves them, and there
is no condemnation to them?

Object. To judge of Justification by sanctification is a doubtful evidence, a
carnal and inferior evidence?

Answ. If to be under the power and dominion of sin be a certain evidence of
condemnation, so that he that says he knows Christ, and yet walks in darkness
is a liar, 1 John 1.6. and 2.4. then sanctification, whereby we are freed from
the power of sin, is a clear and full evidence of our actual justification: 1
^oh. 2.3. Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments: So Act.
3. ult. Christ is sent to bless his people by turning the^ from their
iniquities: then they that are turned from them by him, may know certainly that
they are blessed. So 1 Timothy 4.8. Godliness has the promise of this life, and
that which is to come; therefore sanctification is a clear evidence of Gods
love to us; sanctification is always an evidence in it self of a justified
estate, though it be not always evident unto us.

Now to prove that its no carnal, and inferior, but the first evidence, and a
principal one, take th^se propositions.

First, the free offer of grace is the first evidence to a poor lost sinner
that he

Secondly, the receiving of this offer by faith (relatively considered in
respect

Thirdly, the work of sanctification (which is the fruit of our receiving this
offer

See Shepherds morality of the Sabbath.

Object. That which reveals any evidence of assurance that I am Christ, and
he is mine, is the Spirit speaking personally, and particularly to my heart,
with such a voice, Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee: and this
is that broad seal of the Spirit, making an immediate impression on my heart,
without any begged testimony from works of sanctification, which is the
revealing evidence of my interest in Christ: and the receiving evidence is
faith, believing this Testimony of the spirit, only because the spirit says
so; not because I have evidences or particular works of sanctification, such as
are, universal obedience, sincerity of heart, and love of the brethren?

Answ. The Papist is the black devil, taking away all certainty of assurance:
the Antinomian is the white devil; a spirit of hell clothed with all heaven,
and the notions of Free Grace; they say, Free Grace in us is a dream:
sanctification inherent is a fiction: Christ is all: there is no grace existent
in the creature; Grace is all in Christ, and nothing but imputed
righteousness. But if works of sanctification can give no assurance, then

First, the joy, and rejoicing which we have in the Testimony of a good
conscience, that in simplicity, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom,
but by the grace of God, we have our conversation in the world, 2 Cor. 1.12.
must be but a dream. David, Job, Moses, Samuel, the Prophets, and Apostles,
their joying in a good conscience, must arise from doubtful and conjectural
evidences: yea, then none can say in any assurance: I believe in Christ: In the
inward man I delight in the Law of God. I am crucified to the world. My
conversation is in Heaven, etc. for all these are inherent qualifications in a
child of God, but they are doubtful and uncertain. How then has God promised
to love the righteous: to give the prize to him that runs, etc.

witness to our spirit that we are the children of God, Romans 8.16. is in this
sense, an immediate act of the Spirit, because the reflex acts of the soul are
performed without any other medium, or means, but that whereby the direct acts
are performed. I know that I know, and I know that I believe; my sense by the
same immediate operation of the Spirit, by that which I know God, without any
other light, teaches me to know that I know God: As by light I see colors,
and my common sense needs not another li^ht to make me know that I see colors:
so when I believe in Christ, that habitual instinct of the grace of God
actuated and stirred up by the Spirit of God, makes me know that I know God,
and that I believe, and so that I am in Christ to my own certain feeling and
apprehension: but this does not hinder, but the assurance of my interest in
Christ is made evident to me by other inferior evidences, as 1 John 2.3.
Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. By keeping Gods
Commandments we do not simply know that we know him by certainty of faith; but
we know that we know God these two ways.

1. We know (the instinct of the new man being stirred up to action by the
wind which blows when, and where it lusts) our knowing of God to be sound,
saving and true; we do not so much know our knowing of God by this supernatual
sense, as we know the supernatural qualification and sincerity of our knowing
of God; so that we rather know the qualification of the act, that the work is
done according to God: then the act according to its substance, though we do
also know it in this relation. So 1 John 3.14. We know that we have passed from
death to life, because we love the brethren, i. e. our love to the brethren
does evidence to us, both that we are translated to the Kingdom of grace, and
also we know that that translation is real, true, sincere, and effectual by
love, and all the fruits of the Spirit.

2. By these works of sanctification we have evidence that we have interest in
Christ, not as by formal light suggesting to us, that the immediate impression
of this great, and broad Seal of God, and his personal and particular testimony
is true, (for Gods Spirit needs not another witness to add authority to
what he says) but because this Conclusion, (thou John, Thomas, etc. have
interest in Christ to thy own feeling) must be proved by Scripture, (except
with Enthusiasts, we separate the Word and the Spirit) therefore these works of
Sanctification prove the Conclusion consequently by Scripture and sense, and so
lead us to the word of Promise, thus. He that believes, and makes sure his
belief by walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, has a clear
evidence to his own feeling that he has interest in Christ. But I John,
Thomas, etc. do believe, and do make sure my belief by walking, not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit; therefore I have a clear evidence to my own
feeling that I have interest in Christ. The Proposition is Scripture, John
3.36. and 5.24. and 11.25, 26. Romans 8.1, 2. 1 John 1.4. and 2.3. The Assumption
is made sure by sense, not at all times, but when the Spirit is breathing upon
the soul. For though I do believe, and walk after the Spirit, yet to my own
feeling I have only evidence of my interest in Christ, when the Spirit stirs up
my sense to compare my faith, and walking with the Promises of God in Christ.

Ob. If this be so, then all the certainty that I have of my interest in
Christ, is ultimately and principally resolved into this weak and rotten
foundation of my own good works, which being examined by the Law of God, will
be found so sinful, that they must needs involve me under the Curse of God?

Answ. This will not follow for if our works of Sanctification were the causes
of our peace and comfort, then it might have some color of truth: but, though
these works have sin cleaving to them, yet because our supernatural sense of
the Spirit suggesteth that these works are the fruits of faith, and are done in
some measure of sincerity, and flow not from the Spirit of the Law, but from
the Spirit of the Gospel, therefore they lead us to Christ, and drive us upon a
clear Gospel-Promise, thus.

First, That the adherent sinfulness of our works are purged by the blood of

Secondly, That our peace and assurance depends not upon our works, but upon
the Tim. 4.7, 8. 1 Cor. 9.24. Rev. 22.14. Only our inherent qualification leads
us, as a moral motive, to look to the Promises of God, which is the foundation
of our peace.

Thirdly, if works of sanctification be no sure marks of our interest in
Christ,

Fourthly, in exalting Christ's righteousness one way by making Christ all,
they

Fifthly, the Spirit which they make the only witness, must be known to us
Gal. 5.22. Love, Joy, Peace, etc. as the fruits are evidences of the life of
the tree, then men are to labor for faith, and the raptures, impressions, and
the immediate and personal influence of a Spirit from Heaven without making any
conscience of holy ving, and so this is the highway for men void of all
sanctification to believe that they are in Christ; and they may live after the
flesh, and yet believe the Testimony of the broad Seal of an immediate working
Spirit.

Mr. Rutherfords Parl. Sermon.

Ob. But Romans 4.5. Its said that God justifies the ungodly?

Answ. First, Some answer it thus: that these words are not to be understood in
sensu composito, but diviso, and antecedenter: He that was ungodly, is, being
justified, made godly also, though that godliness does not justify him; and
so they compare these passages with those of making the blind to see, and the
deaf to hear, not that they did see whilst they were blind, but those that
were blind do now see; which is true and good. But

Secondly, Ungodly here is meant of such, who are so considered in their Acts
15.9. For whole Christ is the object of his faith, who is received not only to
justify, but also to sanctify.

Ob. But Romans 5.10. Christ died for us whilst we were enemies?

Answ. If Christ died for us whilst we were enemies, why do they say, that if
a man be as great an enemy as enmity it self can make him, if he be willing to
take Christ, and to close with him, he shall be pardoned, which includes a
contradiction: For how can an enemy to Christ close with Christ? But Christ
died, not only to justify, but to save us: now will they hence infer, that
profane men living and dying so shall be saved; and indeed, the grand
principle, that Christ has purchased and obtained all graces antecedently to
us, in their sense, will as necessarily infer, that a drunkard abiding so,
shall be saved, as well as justified.

Ob. But its said that Christ died, and rose again for sinners?

Answ. We must know that this is the meritorious cause of our pardon and
salvation; but besides this cause there are instrumental causes, that go to the
whole work of Justification; therefore some Divines, as they speak of a
Conversion Passive and Active; so also of a Justification Active and Passive:
and they call that Passive, not only when the meritorious cause, but the
instrument applying it is also present, then the person is justified. So then
to that grand mercy of Justification, something is requisite as the efficient,
viz. the grace of God; something as meritorious: viz. Christ's suffering:
something as instrumental: viz. Faith: and one is as necessary as the other.

Mr. Burges Vindiciae Legis.

CHAP. XII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Apostasy, or Falling away.
Quest WHat is Apostasy?

Answ. It Is a leaving or forsaking that good way and course which men had once
taken for the obtaining of grace: so Gal. 5.4. Ye are fallen from grace.

Object. How many sorts of Apostasy are there?

Answ. First, there is a falling from God, either secret, when the heart by
Act. 19.9.

Secondly, there is a temporary defection, or falling away, which afterward is
Julian did.

Thirdly, there is a spiritual defection from some part of Doctrine and
obedience: David, Peter, etc. And a total when the foundation of faith is
denied.

Fourthly, some fall from God in their first years, following their
superstitious Tim. 4.1. Foretold, 2 These. 2.3.

Fifthly, there is a universal departure from the whole Doctrine of Christ,
Heb. 6.6. and 3.12. and 10.29. Read more of it, 2 Pet. 2.20. 1 John 5.16.

Quest. How far may a child of God Apostatize, and fall back?

Answ. First, he may loose all his zeal; and be but lukewarm, Rev. 3.15, Sam.
17.16. there was no zeal in any to oppose the blasphemy of Goliath. This was
foretold, Matthew. 24.12. The love of many shall wax cold.

Sardis, R^v. 3.2. so with Asa, 2 Chronicles. 16.10. and David, 2 Sa^. 11.25.

Joseph's brethren when they had thrown him into the pit, Genesis 37.25. so the
Israelites when they had made the golden calf, Exodus 32.6. so David, 2 Samuel
11.13.

Paul complains of some of his dear friends, Phil. 2.21.

Mal. 1.13. Hence Paul exhorts the Galatians, chapter 6.9. Be not weary of
w^ll-doing.

Sixthly, he may be so dead that nothing can quicken him: and so it may fare
with Isa. 59.16. I wondered that there was no intercessor.

Quest. Where then is grace in such an one? Is he unchilded again?

Answ. The grace of a child of God can never be wholly lost, not for any
goodness in himself, but through the goodness of God to him: For,

John 3.9. so that he cannot commit sin with that full swinge as wicked men do.
Regeneration is an immortal seed, 1 Pet. 1.23, 25.

Psalm. 37.24. Though the righteous fall, yet shall he not utterly be cast down,
etc. Now the difference between the seed, and habits is this. This seed is
immediately in the soul, though it runs through all the powers of it: But
these supernatural habits are immediately in the powers and faculties of the
soul: and herein they differ from moral and natural habits; in that these do
naturally incline, but supernatural habits do never actually incline, but upon
concurrence of special grace.

John 2.27. i. e. a gift, and grace of God, whereby his eyes are enlightened to
look upon God and his Ordinances, and all sin, and iniquity with an heavenly
eye, which can never be taken away: so that he will not think or talk of God as
a natural man does: he will discover that he has something of God still in him.

Rev. 3.8. He does a little fear God: has some good desires though but weak,
and a little endeavor to please God: though corruptions be very strong.

Quest. Whence proceeds this backsliding in Gods children?

Answ. From their giving way to sin, and not looking to themselves to abstain
from it; as from worldliness, passion, etc. as 1 Timothy 5.6. This David found by
woeful experience, and therefore prays, Psalm. 51.12. that God would uphold him
with his free spirit. So we see in Peter, Matthew. 26.47. now the reasons why sin
does so deaden grace in their hearts are,

First, sin is a soul-killing thing: when the devil hooks a man into sin, he
dead Sea, Hos. 13.1. when Ephraim offended in Baal, he died, Ephesians. 2.1. ye were
dead in sin: Hence he calls the Law of sin, the Law of death, Romans 8.2. sin
weakens all the powers and faculties of the soul, and body that they cannot
stir to any duty. It Is like a great weight on a man's back, Heb. 12.1. As Christ
says, cares overcharge the heart, Luke 21.34. It separates between God which
is the fountain of life, and the soul, and therefore no marvel if it deaden it.

Secondly, sin grieves the holy Spirit of God: and we know that all the Ephesians.
4.31. Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, etc. And 1 These. 5.18, 19. It
quencheeh the Spirit.

Thirdly, it puts a most bitter hard task upon the soul to go through, which
David so loath to call himself to account when he had sinned with Bathsheba.

Fourthly, it defiles the conscience, till it be again purged by the blood of
Heb. 9.14. It knocks off a man's fingers from laying hold of the Promises, which
are the things by which men live, Isa. 38.16. It makes the conscience say, the
Promises do not belong to me: For God is an holy God, and his Promises are
holy, and there is no meddling with them without holiness.

Fifthly, sin does either utterly destroy, or mightily weaken all our assurance
of welcome to God: and therefore it must needs dead the heart in all duties:
Jonah and David.

Quest. What are the particular sins, which cause this deadness and
backsliding?

Answ. First, the niggardliness of Gods children in his service: when they
Philemon v. 21. I know thou will do more then I ask. So 2 Cor. 8.3.

Secondly. neglect of our spiritual watch; This caused deadness in the Sardis,
Rev. 3.12. Such lie open to the tentations of Satan. Hence 1 Pet. 5.8. So we
see in Eve, Noah, Lot, David, etc. Hence Paul, 1 Cor. 2.3. I was amongst you
with much fear.

Thirdly, contenting our selves with a low kind of Religion, that will never
attain to any quickening: whereas Religion is an high thing, Prove. 15.24. Phil.
3.14. So we see in Jehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 17.6. We (says the Apostle) have our
conversation in Heaven, Phil. 3.20.

Fourthly, vanity of men's minds is another cause of great deadness. Hence
David prays against it, Psalm. 119.37. when a man gives way to vain thoughts,
vain speeches, vain expense of time.

Fifthly, evil examples is another cause: when we live amongst dead and
declining

Sixthly, covetousness and wordlinesse: whereas while we keep off our
affections Demas, and 1 Timothy 6.10. See how heartlesse those heaters were from
this cause, Ezekiel. 33.31. Hence Ephesians. 5.3. Let not covetousness be once named
amongst you, etc.

Seventhly, idleness and spiritual sloth, when men let their minds go as a
Prove. 19.15. so when we do not lay forth our talents, and improve our gifts and
graces.

Eighthly. contenting our selves with what we have attained to, and not Heb.
6.1. where there is truth of grace there will be growth, 1 Pet. 2.2. and so we
are exhorted to it, 2 Pet. 3.18.

Quest. What means may we use to prevent this backsliding, and to be quickened
in grace?

Answ. First, we must go to Christ for life and quickening grace: He came for
that end that we might have life, etc. John 10.10. Now to attain hereunto we
must believe in him, John 7.38. and then he invites us, Isa. 55.1. Believe in
the Lord Jesus Christ, set your hearts upon him, seek after him, and you shall
have all good, even life it self.

Cor. 6.11, 12. You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels: For our
mouth is open to you: q. d. In our Ministry there is abundance of grace, life,
etc. we come with our arms full, you may be enlarged sweetly thereby, but that
you are straitened in your own bowels.



Elijah did, that fire from heaven may come upon thy sacrifice to warm and
heat thy heart, and to stir thee up to that which is good, as the Church does,
Psalm. 30.18. Quicken us, and we will call upon thy Name. Of all Petitions we
should pray most for life and zeal, next to Gods glory and our own salvation,
(nay, indeed as the very means of both): For indeed there is no grace that we
have more need of then this, for it sets all other graces on work, and its most
acceptable to God: yea, its the greatest blessing God can bestow upon us. Hence
Psalm. 119.156. Great are thy tender mercies, quicken me, O Lord, etc. where he
takes the quickening of his heart as a gracious effect of Gods infinite mercy
to his soul.

Prove. 10.4. So it is in regard of spiritual life, there is a secret blessing
upon those that are diligent about the means of grace: as in prayer, striving
against sin, hearing the Word, sanctifying the Sabbath, receiving the
Sacraments, etc. such shall thrive in grace, when others shall be like Pharaohs
lean kine, Prove. 13.11. He that gathers by labor shall increase: so is it
here. Paul though he came late into the vineyard, yet by his diligence he
out-went all the rest of the Apostles.



James would quicken them to patience, he proposes the examples of Job and the
Prophets, Jam. 5.10. So when he would quicken them to Prayer, he proposes the
example of Elias, v. 17, 18. The zeal of others will provoke us, 2 Cor. 9.2.
So when Christ would exhort his disciples to suffer persecution, he says,
Consider the Prophets which were persecuted, Mat. 5.12.

Quest. What motives may persuade us to avoid that deadness which accompanies,
or precedes backsliding?

Answ. First, consider the woeful Ingredients of this sin, which

1. A dullness and blockishnesse to learn any thing that is good; as its said
of the Jews, Acts 28.27. when we enjoy excellent means, and profit not by
them.

2. An awkardnesse and listlesnesse to the ways of Jesus Christ, as is said of
the Jews, Mat. 15.8. when we go about duties as having no heart to them.

3. Senselessness of conscience, when it feels not little sins, and is little
sensible of great ones.

4. Coldness and lukewarmnesse of affections: when we neither pray, nor hear,
etc. with affections: we can find tears upon other occasions but not for our
sins: Our love waxes cold, as foretold, Mat. 24.12.

5. Weakness, and faintness of endeavors: as Solomon says, Prove. 13.4. we
would feign have heaven and salvation, but we will not be at pains, and cost
to get it, far unlike to John Baptists hearers, Mat. 11.12.

6. Dullness and drowsinesse of the whole man; though we are very careful, and
industrious about the world, yet we are extreme careless of our souls; If our
hearts were contrite we should soon be quickened, Isa. 57.15.

Secondly. consider that so long as we are dead hearted, we cannot pray.
Implied, Psalm. 80.18. nor hear profitably, implied by Christ, Mat. 11.16, etc.

Thirdly, whilst we are dead we can have no comfort, no assurance to our John
5.21. True repentance is from dead works, and unto life. Faith is not faith if
it do not quicken. Hence Galat. 2.20 Our sins are not forgiven; if we be not
quickened, Col. 2.13.

Fourthly, we cannot grow in grace except we are quickened; Implied, Hosea
Philippians love to Paul was dead till it was quickened, and then it
flourished, Phil. 4.10.

Fifthly, as long as we are dead, we shall be so far from growing that we shall
not be able to keep our own. Hence Rev. 3.2. Such men pine away, as Ezekiel.

Sixthly, this sin of deadness is worse then other sins, and that in six
respects.

1. Other sins for the most part are but in one part of a man: as pride in the
heart, drunkenness in the appetite, etc. but deadness is in the whole man: It
heaps all miseries upon a man, as Rev. 3.17. Such a man is like Judah. Isa.
1.6. has no sound part. Its like the deluge, that drowned the whole world.

2. Other sins are against one or two of the Commandments: but deadness is
against all: Its a sin against prayer, hearing, all Ordinances and Sabbaths:
For in all these we should have life.

3. This sin is deeper in the soul then any other sin: A man will be wil-linger
to part with any sin then deadness, and to take up any duty then quickening:
Judah was content to turn to God, but not with her whole heart, Jerem. 3.10.

4. Other sins may be but acts, and we may not have an habit of them, as we see
in Noah, Lot, David, etc. But deadness is an habit, Ephesians. 2.1. and an estate of
sin is worse then any act of sin.

5. Other sins are the first death of the soul: we are all by nature the
children of wrath, and were once dead: but if after we are Christians we grow
dead again, we are twice dead: and it causes the second death, not of
damnation, but of being dead after we are quickened.

Sixthly, though God threatens hell and damnation against other sins, yet truth
in the love of it: as 2 These. 2.10, 11, 12. Its a most woeful thing when we do
not love the Truth, Ordinances, Obedience, Duties, etc. See also Rev. 2.4, 5.
and 3.16.

Now further to quicken us, let us consider

1. We have life, and why should not God have it? In him we live, move, and
have our being: He gives us life and breath: why then should we not give it him
again? the Rivers that come from the Sea, return to it again. We should
therefore with the Macedonians, 2 Cor. 8.5. yield our selves to the Lord.

2. All the world is alive in their courses: O let Christians be alive in
theirs, as Mich. 4.5. Every man walks in the Name of his God: Let us walk in
the Name of God. They whose belly is their God, or their pleasures, profits,
preferments, etc. their mind and affections run all that way, why should not
we be as forward in our ways.

3. Consider the worth of the Kingdom of Heaven, eternal life, the Gospel,
Prayer, Ordinances, etc. Are they such poor beggarly things, that they are
scarce worth looking after? Yea, they deserve our best affections.

4. If we be quickened, nothing will be difficult: for nothing is hard to a
willing mind: the difficulty of Religion is over if a man be quickened. To
such an one Gods Commandments are not grievous, 1 John 5.3. whereas if our
hearts be dead, there is the greater labor required, Eccl. 10.10. Its hard for
such to overcome lusts, to perform duries: whereas quickening is as oil to the
wheels, it makes it go easy.

5. It will yield a great deal of peace, joy and comfort, as Psalm. 85.6. Revive
us again, O Lord, and we shall rejoice in thee* Such as follow God with an
earnest heart, have such joys as none else can meddle with, God gives them
unknown comfort, joy and peace.

6. It would make Heaven it self to rejoice: as the Father of the Prodigal:
This my son was dead, and does live, Luke 15.32. therefore its meet we should
rejoice. So when a poor soul that was dead before, is now quickened in his
ways, the Angels in Heaven rejoice at it.

7. If we were quickened, we should not only do our selves good, but others
also. So it was with David, Psalm. 34.8. himself being quickened: O taste and
see (says he) that the Lord is good, etc. O fear the Lord ye his Saints. And
v. ^1. Come children, hearken unto me, I Will teach you the fear of the Lord,
etc. So it was with Paul, Acts 26.29. Would that thou, and all that hear me
this day, were not only almost, but altogether such as I am, etc. Fenners
Alarm. Second Part.

Quest. How do temporary believers wither, and fall away from grace?

Answ. First, in judgment, when they fall from the grounds of sincerity,
Demas, who forsook the truth to embrace the present world: The Galatians, who
by little and little fell to another Gospel, Gal. 1.6. At first through
weakness, and in part: afterward in whole, and by obstinacy. Hymenaeus and
Philetus, who once held the truth concerning the Resurrection, but in short
time erred from the faith, and destroyed the faith of many, 2 Timothy 2.18. As
this was prophesied of these latter Ages, so our eyes have seen it abundantly
fulfilled in numbers in these our days, who have departed from the faith, and
given heed to the spirits of Error, and doctrines of Devils, 1 Timothy 4.1. by
turning Anabaptists, Anti-Scripturists, Antitrinitarians, Seekers, Quakers,
Ranters, etc.

once they had for God and goodness. Thus many who seemed fervent in spirit,
and forward maintainers of religion, are now cooled and come to a state of
indifferency, if not of neutrality, framing themselves to the times for their
own profit, preferment, etc.

Thirdly, in practice, as the Galatians who did run well; but something let
and cast them back, Gal. 5.7. Thus many who began in the spirit, end in the
flesh: who having escaped the filthiness of the world, are again entangled
therein, returning with the Dog to his vomit, and with the washed sow to her
wallowing in the mire, 2 Pet. 2.20.

Fourthly, in respect of means which should preserve them from Apostasy. Some
heap to themselves Teachers after their own lusts, 2 Timothy 4.3. Others that used
to pray much, and often, and fervently, but now they wholly, or in great part
neglect it. Others that were diligent in instructing their families, watching
over their behavior, etc, wholly lay it aside.

Quest. What is the danger of these Apostates?

Answ. First, in regard of God they are most hateful to him, seeing they can
find dogs, and swine, 2 Pet. 2.23.

Secondly, in respect of the Church, they scandalize the weak, and make
themselves

Thirdly, in respect of the sin it self, none more dangerous: For, 1. Relapses
are Heb. 10.26.

Fourthly, in respect of the judgments which attend this sin. 1. The house not
Mat. 7.27. 2. The judgment is certain, being already in part inflicted: The
talent is already taken away, and in the next place the unprofitable servant is
to be cast into hell fire, Mat. 25.28.

Quest. What are s^gnes and notes of a man thus Apostatizing in grace?

Answ. First, a resting in a common and general hope of a good estate, without
a desire and endeavor to get special assurance.

Secondly, an opinion of sufficiency: that he has grace enough, and needs seek
no more: and so not to go foreward, is to go backward.

Thirdly, a comparing of a man's self with those of inferior graces, or means
of

Fourthly, a shunning or slighting Gods Ordinances, and forsaking

Fifthly, secret sins ordinarily committed, not bewailed, nor reformed: or
allowing a man's self in lesser oaths, idle speeches, roving thoughts* expense
of time

Sixthly, hatred of Gods children and their ways whether openly or secretly:
Hence, Psalm 129.6. They that hate Sion shall be as grass on the housetop

Quest. What means may we use to keep us from this Apostasy?

Answ. First, get sound judgment to discern the truth ftom error, which is
attained by the public ministry. If we would not quench the spirit, we must
not despise prophecy, 1 These. 5.19, 20. If we would not fall we must be built
upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles: we must attend upon reading,
meditation, and conference, which notably begets, and confirms soundness of
judgment: and by Prayer, which obtains the Spirit, called the Spirit of
judgment, Isa. 4.4.

Secondly, Sound persuasion of the truth thou professest, and that by getting
dress and dung: get experience of Gods love in Christ, and it will be stronger
then death, etc. Cant. 8.6, 7.

Thirdly, sound affections and love to the truth: esteem it as a Pearl worth
D^mas thou will forsake it: So, 2 Thessal. 2.10, 11.



1. Sincerity, when a man is inwardly a true Nathanael, without guile.

2. Tenderness; whereby we fear and dislike all sin, the least, the closest,
the dearest bosom sin; whereas an evil conscience makes shipwreck of the
faith, 1 Timothy 1.19.

Fifthly, sound conversation. Fruitfulness in our life fastens our faith,
whereas hear the word and do it, if we will be built upon the rock, Matthew.
7.24. God uses to recompense practice of grace with increase of grace. Hence
John 17.7. If ye do these things ye shall know my doctrine, and Psalm 15. ult.
He that does these things shall never fall. The Talent used increases, like
the meal in the barrel, 1 Kings 17.16.

Sixthly, sound fellowship in the communion of Saints: In receiving, and These.
5.11. Heb. 12.12.

Quest. What motions may encourage us to the use of these means?

Answ. First, consider how heresies and errors increase daily in all places,

Secondly, this decay, and withering is fatal to reprobates, and befalls them
Elict, Matthew. 24.24. the Elect cannot be deceived.

Thirdly, experience tells us that we may say of some great Professors, as
Matthew. 21.20. How soon are they withered? which is a shrewd argument that the
sentence is out against them: Never fruit grow on thee any more, ver. 19.

See Dr. Tailor, on the Parable of the Sower.

Quest. Seeing many who have been once zealous for Gods way, afterward decline
it totally, what is it to set rightly forth at our first owning of Christ, and
to lay a sure foundation to prevent Apostasy?

Ans. First, then are our beginnings hopeful when the Spirit of God in the
Ministry of the Word, or other means of grace did work upon us: when it was
not mere education under good governors, nor the acquaintance, and company
which we had with those that fear God, but an inward, experimental work of
grace upon our hearts.

We read, 2 Chronicles. 24.22. of Joash, who in his latter days did most wickedly
degenerate, when yet in his former time he had been very forward in repairing
the Temple, and had showed more zeal for Gods glory then the Priests did: But
what was the ground? Jehoiadah the High Priest had a great hand over him, he
helped him to his Kingdom, and engaged him to God several ways: but when this
good man was dead he became a wolf, and put Zachary, Iehoiadahs son, to death,
and that merely because he reproved him for his sins: So that though Joash had
some external restraint upon him, yet was there no internal renovation by Gods
Spirit. Look therefore what put thee upon a forwardness in the ways of God:
was it the Spirit of God through the Word? then it is of God, and will endure:
Otherwise a child misshapen in the conception will ever after be a Monster.

Secondly, then will beginnings and endings be alike, when grace is rooted, and
Mat. 13.21. the seed that grew hopefully miscarried, because it had no rooting:
and the house upon the sandy foundation fell, because the builder dug not
deep enough: Hence the promise of regeneration is, Ier. 31.33. to put the Law
of God into their inward parts: therefore grace is called the inwa^d man, the
hidden man of the heart: If therefore thy repentance has been deep enough? If
thy faith, and love be rooted? the gates of hell shall never prevail against
thee.

Thirdly, good beginnings will end well when we profess Christ out of love to
Judas. To follow Christ for the loaves, or to know him only after the flesh,
will never endure. Jehu begins with zeal as hot as fire, yet his latter end was
like Jeroboams, and all because his ends were not pure. Observe therefore thy
heart diligently in the motions and intentions of it. Is it to get applause? to
be reputed of? to compass great things for thy self? If so the time will come
that, thy building will fall, though so many did admire it.

Fourthly, thy beginnings will end coldly, when thy judgment is not well
instructed, carried up and down with every wind of doctrine; Christ therefore
prays, John 17.17. that they may be sanctified through the truth: Hymenaeus
and Philetus, when they made shipwreck of the faith, they then cast away a good
conscience: so that a sound mind and judgment is a special help to
perseverance: they which are tossed up and down with every new doctrine, are
called children, Ephesians. 4.14. because their understandings are weak.

Fifthly, they that will persevere must be well advised about the nature of
grace, Luke 14.31. etc. so think thou with thy self: shall I join my self to
those that fear God? am I fit for such a great work? Am I mortified to all sin?
Can I endure to lose all for Christ? Do I love him better then my relations,
then my life it self? etc. Mr. Burges on Joh. 17. p. 383.

Sixthly, if thou would not Apostatize, practice so much as thou know, and
John 7.17.

Seventhly, call no grounds of Divine truth into question: suspect not that

Eighthly, beware of indifferency in the matters of God; many think it better
to Tailor on Tit.

CHAP. XIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Apparel.
Quest. HOw are we to use Apparel?

Answ. Men and Women are to cover their bodies with decent and comely Apparel,
and so to atti^e themselves, as that in their Apparel they do express the
virtues of their minds, and the graces that be in their hearts, especially
modesty, shamefastness and frugality.

Quest. Wherein stands d^cency and comeliness of Apparel?

Answ. First, in covering the whole body with it, except such parts as are left
bare for necessities sake, as the face, and hands, Genesis 3.10, 21. By sin came
Deuteronomy. 28.48. Nakedness is threatened as a curse, therefore affected nakedness
is monstrous and vile.

Secondly, in the fashion making our garments in a decent manner, which is, 1*
When its fitted for the sex, Deuteronomy. 22.5. 2. According to the condition, Mat.
11.8. Zeph. 1.8. 1 Cor. 11.14, 15. Phil. 4.8. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4, 5.

Quest. May not ornaments of gold, silver, pearls, precious stones, lace,
silk, sattins, velvets, etc. be used?

Answ. Yea, some necessary cautions in using them being observed, as may be
proved, Genesis 24.22, 47. and 41.42. Exodus 32.3. Psalm. 45.13, 14. Mat. 6.29.

Ob. But the Prophets seem to condemn and threaten such ornaments, Isa. 3 18,
etc.

Answ. Some of those ornaments were indeed mere vanities, and therefore not to
be used. Others were in themselves lawful, and are not simply condemned, but
only in the abuse of them as they were made instruments and ensigns of pride,
wantonness, and the lightness of the women, as appears, v. 16.

Ob. But 1 Timothy 2.9. 1 Pet. 3.3. the Apostles forbid the wearing of gold, or
costly Apparel?

Answ. In these texts the Apostles do not simply forbid the wearing of such
things, but the abuse of them in riot and excess, directing their speeches to
women, who it seems were excessive in adorning their outward man, and neglected
the inward ornaments of modesty and humility, the chief ornaments of
Christians. Hence 1 Timothy 2.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.4. the latter are chiefly commended.

Quest. What are those cautions to be observed in using these ornaments?

Answ. First, they must be used sparingly, and with moderation, according to
the rank, place and calling wherein God has set us, and the example of the
gravest and godly persons of our own rank and place, Dan. 5.16, 17, 29. with
Mat. 11.8.

Jer. 2.32. Luke 16.19. It was the rich man's fault to wear them every day.

Prove. 7.10, 16.) but to the honoring of the body, that therein God may be
honored, G^n. 24.15. 1 Cor. 12.23. 1 These. 4.4.

Quest. How do men and women sin in their Apparel?

A^s. First, When they wear strange fashions and guises: threatened even in
Kings children, Zeph. 1.8. the general rule is, whatsoever things are of good
report, these do, Phil. 4.8.



Solomon's good Huswife was not so clothed, Prove. 31.13, etc.

Deut^ 22.5.







Quest. What are the proper uses of Apparel?

Answ. First, to cover our nakedness, and to hide our corporal shame and
defects.

quasi Gardments.

Thirdly, to preserve and cherish natural heat and life, which otherwise would

What shall we say then to those that make them the ensigns of vanity, and
incentives to lust and luxury? whence else are those bushes of hair and
periwigs, those frizlings, crispings, curlings, powdrings, paintings, patchings
and spottings, especially of women's faces? What are the toys they call
fancies? Are they not such as an old Writer calls Satanae ingenia, the devils
fancies? whereas there is nothing more foolish, did we rightly consider it,
then to show pride in garments, which are indeed the ensigns of our shame; as
if the Thief should be proud of his halter: They are called by a word in the
Hebrew, which signifies perfidiousnesse, as being tokens of our perfidious
dealing with God: when as at first man was naked, and yet not ashamed: They are
but coverings of this vile body,, Phil. 3.21. or as it is in the Greek, The
Body of our Humiliation: such as we cannot think of without humbling our souls
for the intemperance, and uncleanness of it. And must our pride break forth in
decking such a body? The Apostle says, Romans 8.10. the body is dead because of
sin: sure then a course hair-cloth may best become a dead Corpse See Elton on
the Commandments.

Quest. What is further to be considered in the use of Apparel?

Answ. First, the preparation of it to be worn.

Secondly, the wearing of it when it is prepared.

Quest. What Rules are to be observed in the preparing of it?

Answ. Our care for apparel and bodily ornaments is to be very moderate, Mat.
6.28, etc. 1 Timothy 6.8.

Quest. How shall we know what is necessary?

Answ. A thing is necessary two ways.

First, in respect of nature, for the preservation of life and health.

Secondly, in respect of our place, calling and condition, for upholding the

Quest. Who shall judge what is n^cessary for persons of every condition?

Answ. First, vain and curious persons are not competent Judges: but the

Secondly, though we must not seek for more then necessary Apparel, yet if

Ob. But John Baptist says, we must not have above one coat?

Answ. His meaning must needs be, that he that has not only necessary raiment
but superfluity; must give of his abundance unto them that want. Christ himself
had two coats, and St. Paul a coat and a cloak.

2. Rule: All Apparel must be fitted to the body, in a comely and decent
manner, as becomes holiness, Tit. 2.3.

Quest. How shall this be done?

Answ. By observing these five rules.

First, it must be according to the sex both for men and women, Deuteronomy. 22.5.

Secondly, our Apparel must be suited to our callings, that it may not hinder
nor disable us in the performance of the duties thereof. This justly condemns

Thirdly, our Apparel must be suited to our means, that so we may be able to

Fourthly, it must be answerable to our estate, and dignity, for distinction of
Joseph was set over the land of Egypt, he was arrayed in fine linen with a
chain of gold about his neck, Genesis 41.42. So Judge. 5.30. Mat. 11.8. the
contrary brings great confusion, and overthrows the order which God has set in
the states and conditions of men.



Quest. But if we see a fashion used in other Countries that we like, may we
not take it up?

Answ. No, for God has threatened to visit all such, Zeph. 1.^. Paul taxes it
as a great disorder in the Corinthians, that men wore long hair, and women
went uncovered, 1 Cor. 11.13, 14.

Tim. 2.9, 10. Mat. 5.16.

Quest. What spiritual use are we to make of our Apparel?

Answ. First, we must take occasion thereby to be humbled for our nakedness,
in regard of grace, and of Gods favor by reason of original sin: They that are
proud of their Apparel, are proud of their shame. Its as if a thief should be
proud of his bolts or halter. Garments are the cover of our shame, and the
signs of our sins.

Romans 13.14. which is done when by prayer we come to God, and entreat him to
make the active and passive obedience of Christ a covering for us, and that
Christ may be made to us wisdom, righteousness, etc. and that we may be made
conformable to him both in life and death in all moral duties, and that we may
have the same mind, affection and conversation that he had.

i. e. the mass and body of sinful corruption; and that's done when we hate
sin, and firmly resolve against it.



Quest. Why must we take heed of pride in Apparel?

Answ. First, because hereby we waste that that should be better employed, as
for the good of the Church, Commonwealth, our families, and especially for the
relief of the poor.







Isa. 2.11, 12. and 3.16, etc. Zeph. 3.11.

Mr. Perkins, Vol. 2. p. 135.

Quest. What further Reasons may be rendered against excess in Apparel?

Answ. First, God has forbidden garishnesse and excess in Apparel, and
therefore except we will show our selves not to regard his word, we must take
heed of it, 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. 1 Timothy 2.9, 10.

Secondly, consider the coming in of Apparel, and we shall see that we have Our
Apparel then is a badge of our sin, and ought to humble us, and who is proud of
a plaster that covers a filthy sore.

Thirdly, its a most unseemly thing for Christians to put excellency in
Appatel, Romans 12.2. 1 Pet. 1.14.

Fourthly, its absurd to place excellency in such a thing as Apparel, for Mat.
6.28, 29.

Fifthly, when the outside is most decked, commonly the inside is most
neglected,

Sixthly, whereas such as are so careful to get brave apparel, do it to get
honor

Seventhly, it makes none better that wear it, whether they are beautiful or
deformed,

Eighthly, they that affect costly apparel sin,

1. Against God by abusing his creatures to pride, and neglecting his Worship
public or private, or by coming unprepared thereto, whilst they spend so much
time in adorning themselves, dressing themselves by the hour, and praying by
the minute.

2. Against themselves by neglecting the inward clothing of their souls, and
procuring much envy, and ill speech, and many censures from others.

3. Against their neighbors by provoking them to imitate their bad example:
For when some begin, others will follow, and Pride spreads quickly, especially
where Religion keeps it not down.

Ninthly, its not only a sin, but the cause and encreaser of much sin. It comes

Ob. But though we wear such Apparel, we are not proud of it, but as humble as
others?

Answ. How shall we judge of that which is within, but by the outward fruits.
Our light should shine outwardly that others may behold it, Mat. 5.16. we
should keep a conscience void of offense both toward God and man, Acts 24.16.

Ob. We do it to please our husbands, they will have it so?

Answ. Many pretend this, when indeed they do it to please their own vain
minds. But if any have such fantastical husbands, they must yet take heed of
going too far lest they displease God. Let them rather please their husbands
by their humble subjection, and modest and sober carriage.

Ob. We do but what most do?

Answ. We must not follow a multitude to do evil: Exodus 23.2.

Ob. We could be content to lay it aside, if others would do so?

Answ. We ought not to tarry for others, but rather to begin and give them a
good example.

Mr. Byfield on Peter.

Quest. If there be any deformity in the body, may we not labor to cover it?

Answ. Yes: but we may not set a new form on the face: Dissembling is
condemned as well in deed as in word, every one should be content with their
own natural favor, and complexion that God has given them, and account of it
as a precious thing, be it better or worse. For the outward form and favor
that a man has, is the work of God himself proportioned, and fitted to him by
his special Providence. Being therefore the Lords own work, and his Will thus
to frame it rather then otherwise, there is great reason that we should rest
contented with the same. They therefore that devise, and use artificial forms,
and favors to set upon their bodies and faces by painting, and coloring, that
they may seem such as indeed they are not, are condemned by the light of
nature, and much more by the light of Gods Word, wherein we have but one only
example thereof, and that is of wicked Jezabel, 2 Kings 9.30. who by this mark
is noted for a notorious strumpet, in that she painted her face. For what is
this but to find fault with Gods own Workmanship? and to seek to correct the
same by a counterfeit work of our own devising, which cannot but be highly
derogatory to his wisdom, and displeasing to his Majesty.

Quest. What Arguments may be brought against women's painting their faces?

Answ. It is not only evil in regard of the abuse, but utterly unlawful and
abominable in its own nature, and in the general practice of it, as offending
not only against the Law of God, but the very light of nature, such as have no
spark of grace branding it with a note of reproach wheresoever they discover
it: Yea, even those that practice it do condemn it in their own consciences,
and are ashamed to be taken with the fact: But that all Christians may abhor
it, Let them consider,

1. That God is not the Author of this beauty, but the devil himself, who
brings the works of God into disgrace, not only by counterfeiting them, but by
laboring to excel them. Saint Cyprian thinks, that when wicked Angels,
professing love to lewd women, that they might destroy them, abused their
bodies to filthiness, as a reward of their wickedness, they taught them this
Art of painting; whence he infers, Haec non sunt membra quae Deus fecit, sed
quae Diabolus infecit. These painted parts are not of Gods making, but of the
Devils corrupting. Now what impiety is it to Professors of Christianity, being
formed by God to seek to be reformed, and bettered by the Devil. Hence
Tertullian says, The Devil has certainly devised this Art, that he might
oppose himself against God: For that is Gods work which is natural, and that
the Devils which is counterfeited: And what hellish wickedness (says he) is
it to add to Gods work, the Devils Art? etc.

Secondly, as it has an evil Author, so it is in it self evil, as springing
from

1. The root from which it springs is sometimes Pride, which moves them, when
they cannot match others in natural beauty, to use these Artificial helps, that
they may excel them in that which is counterfeit. Sometimes it springs from
lust, and inward uncleanness, which moves them to use these inveigling Arts,
that by seeming more beautiful then they are, they may ensnare the affections
of those thar look upon them.

2. The cursed fruits which it produces, are either against God, others, or
themselves.

1. Against God they offend, by presuming to adulterate his works, and by
taking upon them to mend that which (as they suppose) he has made amiss.
Hence St. Cyprian, God made man according to his own Image, and dare any
presume to change that which God has made? In so doing they offer wrong to
God, when they strive to reform and transform that which he has formed. For
that which is natural is the Work of God, but the alteration of it is the work
of the Devil, etc.

2. They offend against men by deceiving and abusing them, making them to
admire a painted Statue in stead of Gods work. Again, they much more sin
against them, whilst by these devilish Arts, and counterfeit beauty, they
inflame their hearts with filthy and unlawful lusts. Hence St. Jerome calls it;
the fire of youth, the fuel of lust, and the sign which shows where an
unchaste heart dwells.

3. They most of all sin against themselves, yea, against both their bodies and
souls. For it shows that they are ashamed of themselves in their native
color, and therefore being displeased therewith, like Players, they come
disguised in the likeness of other persons, and for want of a better, they act
their parts in the habit of an harlot. Now what is this but unnaturally to deny
themselves? what is it but to make themselves counterfeit idols, that unto them
lust may offer the sacrifice of uncleanness? what is it but to expose
themselves to the scorn and laughter of those, who seeing their counterfeit
beauty, shall afterward happen to see them in their own complexion, and
natural foulness. Again, whilst they labor to attain to this counterfeit
beauty, they lose that true complexion which they have by nature: For with
their medicines and minerals which they use for this purpose, they make their
color pale, they wrinkle their faces, yea, ofttimes poison their skin, and
make dim their eyesight, and so over-greedily seeking false beauty, they find
true deformity, and make themselves loathsome indeed, that they may appear
beautiful in show.

4. They sin against their good name, whilst following the practice of
Harlots, they deservedly get the reputation of being Harlots. For this outward
painting of these earthly houses, makes men think that they are to be let, and
by hanging out this sign of Lust, they invite Customers, seeming to offer
their honesty to sale at easy rates: whereas Christians should not only avoid
sin, but the very appearance thereof. And concerning such St. Ambrose passes
this sentence: Having adulterated their faces, they will soon after think of
adulterating their chastity, and defiling their bodies.

5. They disgrace their Profession of Religion, whilst professing themselves
the members of Christ, they behave themselves like the limbs of Satan. The best
beauty of a Christian woman is modesty and shamefastness, and the best
ornament is simplicity and humility: but how far are they from simplicity and
truth, who lie and dissemble, even when they say nothing, speaking falsehood and
dissimulation with their very faces, to as many as look upon them? unless they
think that only verbal untruth is forbidden, and actual falsehood permitted. Or
that it is a greater fault to dissemble in speeches, then to deceive in deeds
and actions.

Ob. For our selves we take no great pleasure in it, but we must do it to
please our husbands, that we may gain their love, and keep them from lusting
after strange women?

Answ. But you ought not by pleasing men to displease God: therefore if it
could be imagined that any man is so void of understanding, as that he would
have his wife, whom he desires to keep honest, to use the qualities and
practice of an Harlot, yet she ought not to content him by burdening her soul
with a known sin. Neither can it be imagined, that women hereby can wind
themselves into their husbands love, or preserve him from unlawful lusts: For
if neither the fea^e of Gods judgments, threatening the Laws of men, and the
danger of falling hereby into innumerable evils, will deter him from following
such base courses: nor the love of God and his sweet Promises will allure him
to the performance of his duty, how can it be imagined that he will be drawn by
a painted vizard to embrace this Conjugal love, or be preserved from strange
lusts with a counterfeit beauty? Yea, rather such wives make themselves
loathsome to their Husbands, whilst these artificial supplies puts them in
mind of their natural defect, and this counterfeit beauty, of that ^eal
deformity which it hides. If then you would have your husbands love you,
observe rather a sober gravity, then affect a counterfeit beauty, and deck your
minds with ornaments of virtue, as with meekness, humility, chastity, etc.
which being permanent and unchangable, will make his love constant and
perpetual.

CHAP. XIV. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Assurance.
Quest. WHat is Assurance?

Answ. It is a reflect act of the soul, by which a Christian clearly sees that
he is for the present in the state of grace, and so an heir apparent to glory.

Quest. What are the kinds, or degrees of this Assurance?

Answ. First, an Assurance, or certainty of adherence, and application, when we
certainly apply, and adhere to the promise, and to Christ therein; John 1.12. A
cleaving to the Lord with full purpose of heart. Acts 11.23. so that if we must
perish, we will perish believing: This is the lowest step of assurance which
every true Believer has.

Secondly, a certainty of evidence or experience: when by the reflection of new
creature, 2 Cor. 5.17. walking in the light, 1 John 1.7. walking after the
Spirit, not after the flesh, Romans 8.1. loving the brethren, 1 John 3.14. This
assurance is usually attended with much comfort, and joy; yet every Christian
attaines not to it, but should labor hard for it: It belongs rather to the
well-being, then to the being of a Christian.

Thirdly, an unstaggering certainty, or full assurance, when there is such a
Abraham's, Romans 4.17, etc. This is the highest pitch of Assurance attainable
in this life, and next to celestial enjoyment, which few attain unto.

Quest. How may the truth of assurance be discerned? seeing some that have it,
think they have it not, and others that have it not, think they have it.

Answ. First, try it by the qualifications of the persons assured; as,

1. Have thou been troubled in conscience with fears about thy natural
condition, and thy soul kindly humbled in thee: The spirit of bondage goes
before the spirit of Adoption, Romans 8.15, 16. with Matthew. 11.28. Esaias 61.1, 2.

2. Has thy humbled b^oken heart been furnished with saving faith. First we
believe, and then we are sealed with the holy Spirit of promise, Ephesians. 1.13.

3. Has the Spirit been given to thee? we must first have the Spirit, before
we can know the things that are given us of God, 1 Cor. 2.12.



1. Divine testimony by audible voice, as Christ assured those, Mat. 9.2, 5, 6.
Luke 5.20, 23. and 7.47, 48. and 23.42, 43. But this was extraordinary, and is
not now to be expected.

2. The lively exercise of faith, reflecting on its own acts, and seeing it
self believing: and these acts are, 1. Direct: and these again, either
receptive of Christ: as, Joh. 1.12. or operative from, and by Christ received,
as Acts 15.9. Romans 5.1. Gal. 5.6. 2. Reflexive, when faith looks back upon its
own acts thus receiving Christ, and thus acting. So Paul knew whom he had
believed, 2 Timothy 1.12.

3. The testimony of our own renewed and sanctified conscience, according to
the Word of God, witnessing our good estate: The spirit of man is the candle of
the Lord, etc. Prove. 20.27. Tells us what is in us, 1 Corinthians. 2.10, 11, 12.

4. The testimony of the Spirit of God purposely given us to this end, 1 John
3.24. and 4.13. 1 Cor. 2.12. the Spirit is the author of our assurance: 1. As
a seal, Eph^s. 1.13. sealing us after we believe, as v. 14. 2. As an earnest of
our inheritance, Ephesians. 1.14. 3. As a joint witness with our spirits, Romans
8.16. clearing up our spiritual evidences, and enabling us to discern them, as
1 Cor. 2.9. etc. 1 John 2.27.



1. True assurance mightily provokes to self-purifying, to holiness in heart
and life; as, 1 John 3.2, 3. whereas presumption emboldens in sin.

2. It stirs up fervent desires, and longs after the Gospel of Christ; they
long for the sincere milk of the word, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3. But presumption breeds
disaffection to it, Psalm 50.16, 17. such either desire it not at all, or not
the sincere milk of the word, or not in reference to growth.

3. It makes the soul incomparably to desire communion with God and Jesus
Christ, as we see in the Church, Cant. 2.6, 7, 16, 17. with Cant. 3.1. to 6.
and 5.2. and 6.4. How does David mourn for want of the sense hereof? and pray
for it? Psalm. 51.8, 12. But presumption knows not what communion with Christ
means.

4. It notably engages those that have it to serve, and honor God in their
places to the uttermost. God assures Joshuah, that he will never leave him nor
forsake him, Josh. 1.5, 6. and Joshuah resolves, that whatever others do, he,
and his house will serve the Lord, Josh. 24.15. so in Paul, 1 Cor. 5.14, 15.
and in David, Psalm 118.28. But presumption contemnes God, Job 21.14, 15.

5. True assurance singularly supports and comforts the heart in deepest
tribulations: as we see in Job, chap. 19.25, etc. and Paul, 2 Corinthians. 1.12.
But presumption in such cases is a miserable comforter.

6. It fills us with joy in hope of glory when tribulation has done its worst,
Romans 5.1, 2, etc. But presumption has no true hope of another life, Ephesians.
2.12.

Quest. How may this assurance be attained and retained?

Answ. First, be much in self-examination that we may find where our evidence
Cor. 13.5.

Secondly, quench not, grieve not the Spirit, 1 These. 5.19. Ephesians. 4.30. by Cor.
2.10, etc. and he assures us convincingly, clearly and satisfactorily, Romans
8.16. Ephesians. 1.13, 14. with 1 John 3.24. and 4.13.

Thirdly, cherish and improve all our graces; for every grace has evidence in
knowledge, Col. 2.2. Faith, Heb. 10.22. and Hope, Heb. 6.11, 18, 19.

Fourthly, constantly exercise our selves herein to have a conscience void of
Acts 23.1. and 24.16. Romans 8.16. 1 John 3.18, 19, etc. 2 Cor. 1.12. Isa. 32.17.
Prove. 14.26. Psalm 50.23. Joh. 14.21.

Fifthly, Remember former experiences of assurance. So Psalm. 77.7, 8, 9, 10.

Sixthly, labor to get out of those conditions which are prejudicial, and
obstructive to assurance; which are

1. The infancy of grace: such have not their senses exercised to discern
their condition, Heb. 5.13, 14. Labor to be grown men, 1 Cor. 14.20. 2 Pet.
3.18.

2. The spiritual slumber, or sleep of security: then our evidences sleep with
us; as, Cant. 3.1, 2. and 5.2, 3, 6.

3. The spiritual swoon of desertions. For when God withdraws the light of his
countenance, we discern not our spiritual life, Psalm 22.1. and 77.7, etc. and
88.14, etc.

Labor therefore to remove desertions, the conflicts of tentations, and other
soul-distempers.

Seventhly, diligently, and skillfully improve those notable assuring
Ordinances, the Word, the Lords Supper, and Prayer. For, 1. The Word was
written Joh. 5.13. Joh. 15.11. 1 John 1.4. Let it therefore dwell richly in us,
Col. 3.16. 2. The Lords Supper seals up remission of sins, Mat. 26.27, 28.
Communion with Christ, 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. and interest in the new Covenant, 1
Cor. 11.24, 25. 3. Prayer, which pierces heaven, creeps into the bosom of
God, and often furnishes the doubting soul with assurance, Joh. 16.24. David
often began his prayers with doubting, but concludes with assurance: as Psalm
6.1, etc. 8.9* and 31.21, 22. and 13.1, 2, 5, 6.

Quest. What Motives may stir us up to labor for assurance?

Answ. First, the want of it exposes the dear children of God to many
miseries; As,

1. It argues great weakness of grace: and that they want the anointing of the
spirit, 1 John 2.27. 1 Cor. 2.11. but we should not be always ^bes, 1 Cor.
14.20. Ephesians. 4.12* etc. 2 Pet. 3.18.

2. It argues strength and prevalency of corruptions, and tentations, as in
David, Psalm. 51.8, 12.

3. Or spiritual desertions, the Lord having for a time forsaken the soul, and
withdrawn himself, as in the case of David, Psalm. 22.1. Heman, Psalm. 88.14,
etc. As^ph, Psalm. 77.7, etc. the Church, Cant. 3.1, 2. and 5.6, 7, 8.

Hagar when she saw not the fountain, Genesis 21.16, 19. and with the Disciples,
whilst their eyes were holden that they knew not Christ, Luke 24.14, 15. and
with Mary Magdalen, when she knew not of Christ's resurrection, Joh. 20.14, 15.
So if we be close by the well of grace; if Christ be present with us, yea, in
us, if we know it not, we are full of tears and sorrow. Though Nathan told
David, 2 Samuel 12.13. that God had put away his si^, yet because he had not the
sense of it, he wanted the joys of Gods salvation, Psalm 51.8.12.

Pet. 1 10. 2 Cor. 13.5. H^b. 10.22. and 6.11.

Joh. 14.21. Rev. 2.17. 1 Cor. 2.9, 10, 13. 1 John 2.3, 5. and 3.2, 14, 19. and
4.13. and 5.13, 19. 2. The nature of Knowledge, Faith, and Hope tend to it,
Col. 2.2. Heb. 2.1, 15. and 6.11. 3. Many of Gods people have attained to it,
as Job 19.25, 26, 27. David* implied, Psalm. 51.8, 12. Hezekiah, 2 King. 20.3.
Thomas, John 20.28. Peter, John 21.15, etc. Paul, 2 Timothy 1.12. the Church, Came.
2.16. and 7.10.

Prove. 14.10.

Quest. But how will you prove that a Christian may be assured of his salvation?

Answ. First, ^here is scarce any eminent Christian in the whole book of God,
but has set his seal to this truth by his own particular experience, and it is
confirmed by the present experience of many thousands, 1 John 5.13. the drift
of Saint John's Epistle is, that Christians might have assurance: Besides, the
means whereby they attained to assurance are common to all Christians; they
have the spirit dwelling in them; they have the fruits of the Spirit, and a
sweet testimony of their own spirits: Peter also exhorts all to give diligence
to make their calling, and election sure, 2 Pet. 1.10. therefore if it came
only by extraordinary Revelation, to what end were our diligence?

Actus primus, the first act, whereby I believe in Christ for the remissiom of
my sins, and justifying of my person, which is properly justifying faith. 2.
Actus ex fide emanans, an act flowing from faith, by which I believe that my
sins are remitted, Romans 5.1. Assurance is nothing but Apex fidei, the highest
degree of faith. The hand of faith lays hold on Christ, and knows that it
receives him: and the want of assurance comes from the imbecility of faith.

Heb. 6.18. that the heirs of promise might have strong consolation. But what
sweetness can a Christian draw from a promise till he knows that it belongs to
him? will it enrich a man to know that there are Pearls, and Diamonds in the
world? Nay it is rather a vexation to know that there are spiritual dainties,
but they belong not to me. God has given his Word, his Oath, his Seal, his
Earnest, and all to this very end that a poor Christian may be assured of his
salvation, and that he might have strong, and vigorous consolation.

and Hope tarries for it till it come, Heb. 6.19. which Hope we have as an
Anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. Hope were but a poor Anchor if it
should leave the soul to uncertainties, to the courtesy of a wave; to the
clemency of a Rock, to the disposing of a storm. But this Anchor pierces
within the veil, it will be sure to have fast hold, it will fix upon Heaven it
self, etc. Again, Romans 5.2. we glory in hope, etc. But its a poor glory to
triumph in uncertainties, and before the victory: there is little cause of joy
till the soul be provided for eternity, and till it know it self to be in this
safe condition. A probable hope indeed will bear up, and support the soul; but
it will not quiet and satisfy the soul. Christian hope, when it is in its full
vigor, is all one with assurance, Romans 5.5. Hope makes not ashamed: but if
hope could be frustrated, it might make ashamed.

Quest. What is the manner how Christians are assured of their salvation? or
how shall we know that our graces are true, and not counterfeit?

Answ. Many characters of true grace might here be given: as that it must flow
from a principle of sincerity, from a principle of love: that it must be
conformable to the grace of Christ. But all this will not satisfy the soul,
which will still question, how shall I know that my graces are such? so then
that which we must ultimately resolve it into is that double Testimony, Romans
8.16. The same Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are the sons of
God: both these witnesses do fully agree, and make up one entire testimony, so
that the soul may say here, as Paul does, Romans 9.1. I speak the truth, I lie
not, my conscience bearing me witness by the Holy Ghost. So that the whole
work of assurance is summed up in this Practical Syllogism. Whosoever believes
shall be saved; but I believe, therefore I shall certainly be saved. The
Assumption is put out of doubt: For, 1. Conscience comes in with a full
Testimony which is better then a thousand witnesses, 1 John 3.10. He that
believes has a witness in himself. So 1 John 3.21. If our heart condemn us
not, then have we confidence toward God.

Ob. But Jer. 17.9. the heart is deceitful above all things, how then can we
trust it?

Answ. First, some understand it of the unregenerate heart: of which it All the
imaginations of the thoughts of man's heart, are altogether evil.

Secondly, the drift of the text is to show the deceitfulness of men's hearts
Jews ^an delude the Prophets, and so think to evade the curse? No, I the Lord
search the hearts; all is naked in my sight, Jer. 17.10. Heb. 4.13.

Thirdly, its true, the sincerest heart is very deceitful. So was David's.
19.12. Who can know the error of his ways? No man can be acquainted with
every turning and winding of his heart: But this hinders not but that he may
know the general frame and bent of his heart. The soul knows which way its
faculties stream with most vehemence. Conscience cannot be bribed, it will give
in true judgment, especially an enlightened conscience. There is none, but if
he search and examine his soul in a strict, and impartial manner, may know
whether he be sincere or no, 1 Cor. 2.11. Who knows the things of a man, but
the spirit of a man that is in him. Else why are we so often enjoined, to
search, and try, and examine our hearts, etc. if after all our diligence we may
be deceived.

Ob. If by the testimony of conscience, men may know the frame of their
spirits, whether they be upright or no, why then are not all true Christians
assured of their salvation? have they not their hearts and consciences about
them?

Answ. First, many are not so well acquainted with their own hearts as they

Secondly, eternity does so amaze and swallow up their thoughts when they High
Tower knows that he is safe, and yet when he looks down he is afraid of falling.

Thirdly, conscience sometimes gives in a dark and cloudy evidence when its

Come we then to the second Testimony, the great and the supreme witness of
the Spirit, not only the gifts and graces of the Spirit, but the Spirit it self.

Ob. This seems to be the same with the former: for we cannot know our
sincerity till the Spirit reveal us to our selves: The soul cannot see its own
face, till the Spirit unmask it?

Answ. We grant that to the least motion in spirituals there is necessarily
required the concurrence of the Holy Ghost, but yet there is a great difference
between the working of the Spirit, and the witness of the Spirit; there is an
efficacious work of the Spirit when faith is wrought in the soul: but yet there
is not the Testimony of the Spirit, for then every believer should be presently
sealed. So that thou^h the Testimony of our own spirit cannot be without the
assistance of Gods Spirit, yet its clearly distinct from the Testimony of the
Spirit: For here the Spirit enables the soul to see its graces by the souls
light: But when it comes with a testimony, then it brings a new light of its
own, and lends the soul some auxili^y beams for the more clear revealing of it.

Quest. What kind of testimony is that of the Spirit?

Answ. First, its a clear testimony, a full and satisfying light which scatters
all clouds and doubts, 1 John 3.24. By this we know that he dwells in us, by
the Spirit which he has given us. If an Angel should tell us so, there might
be some doubt about it: but the inward Testimony of the Spirit is more
powerful, then if it were by an outward voice.

Secondly, a sure Testimony: For its the witness of the Spirit, that can
neither Abba Father, and that with confidence. Its opposed to the spirit of
bondage, and therefore takes away all doubtings, yea, the Seal, and an ^arnest.
Now he assures the soul.

1. By a powerful application of the promise: For as faith appropriates the
promise on our part, so the Spirit applies it on Gods part. This spirit of
adoption seeks love, and peace, and pardon; and that by a particular
application of the promise to us: as when the promise of pardon of sin, and
life everlasting is generally propounded in the Ministry of the Word, the Holy
Ghost does particularly apply it to the heart, and so seals up the promise to
the soul.

2. By a bright irradiation or enlightening of the soul, clearing its evidences,
discovering its graces, and showing them to be true, and not counterfeit, 1
Cor. 2.12. We have received the Spirit, which is of God, that we might know the
things which are freely given us of God.

Ob. But many think they have the Spirit when they have not: Satan transforms
himself into an Angel of light?

Answ. First, one man's self-deceit does not prejudice anothets certainty. A man
in a dream, thinks himself awake when he is not: yet for all this, a man that
is awake may certainly know that he is so.



Thirdly, the Spirit of God witnesses according as the Word witnesses: Try
the Scripture was endited by the Spirit, and the Spirit cannot contradict
himself: so that whosoever rebels against the light of the Word, shall never
have the light of the Spirit.

Quest. Seeing, as the Spirit breaths when it pleases, so it shines when it
pleases, whether then may a Christian that has but the single Testimony of his
own Spirit, be assured of his salvation?

Answ. The witness of our own spirit is a true assurance, though it be not so
clear an assurance. I may see a thing certainly by the light of a Candle, yet I
may see it more clearly by the light of the Sun. The light of the Spirit may
and does often withdraw it self, and leave us only the witness of our own
spirit, and yet then the soul has assurance.

Quest. But what if I have not the witness of Gods Spirit, nor^ of my own
neither?

Answ. Have recourse to former assurance. Do thou remember that once thou
had a sweet serenity of soul? that an enlightened conscience upon good grounds
did speak peace to thee? Did thou never see the light of the Spirit crowning
thy soul with satisfying beams? then be sure that thou art still in the same
condition; for there is no total falling from grace: Gods love like himself is
immutable. The Spirits testimony is of eternal truth. So did David, when his
joy was extinguished, and he would feign have it lighted again, Psalm. 51.12.
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit;
whence are implied, 1. That for the present it was taken away. 2. That he had
it. 3. He remembered that he had it, and therefore prays to have it restored.
David's own spirit was now very unquiet, and Gods Spirit had withdrawn it self,
and now his best refreshing was his former assurance. Remember this, that the
least drop of true grace shall never be exhausted: the least spark of true joy
shall never be extinguished.

Quest. But suppose we have neither the Testimony of Gods Spirit, nor of our
own, nor can recall former assurance, what shall the soul do then?

Answ. In such a time look to the beginnings of grace: Look now to the souls
prizing of a Christ: to the whimperings after the breast: to the longings and
breathings after its beloved, thoughts upon him, desires after him, endeavors
for him: there is much comfort and sweetness in these: I, and some kind of
Assurance. For,

First, God that has begun this great and good work in thee, will never give

Secondly, the least seed of grace, as its choice and precious, so its vigorous
and Who has despised the day of small things? Zach. 4.10. He that is richest
in grace began with a small stock: Improve but present strength, and God will
send thee in fresh supplies, that thou may walk from strength to strength.

Thirdly, if thou can not spy out any grace in thy self, borrow light of
another: Interpreter, one of a thousand, that may explain thy condition better
then thou can thy self, Job 33.23. He Will show thee, here is grace, and there
is grace, and there is an evidence, etc.

Quest. But what if after all this, there is a total eclipse, all clouds and
blackness and darkness, and the very valley of the shadow of death?

Answ. First, when there is no certainty of evidence, yet even then have a
certainty the free grace of God in Christ. Say, If I perish, I perish, and
though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee. Like men ready to be drowned,
take fast hold, Cast Anchor, though in the dark.



The patient expectation of the poor shall not perish for ^ver, Psalm. 9.18. One
beam of his countenance is worth waiting for all thy lifetime: yet wait upon
him in Prayer, in his Ordinances, where the Spirit breaths, and God shows his
face: Thus wait upon him in his own way: yea, and in his own time too: think
not time tedious; He that believes makes not haste, Isa. 28.16. Consider that
God is all this while preparing thee, and making thee more capable of his love:
yea, suppose the worst, that thou should die under a cloud, as Christ did,
yet thy condition is safe: thou shall then come to a full assurance, nay, to a
full possession of thine inheritance.

Quest. What are the special sealing times wherein Christians have this
Assurance?

Answ. First, sometimes at their first Conversion: when the spirit of bondage
has past upon the soul, and by a strong conviction has applied particularly
guilt and wrath unto it: then the Gospel brings welcome news of a pardon, and
the Spirit of Adoption applies grace and mercy to the soul, this makes strong
impressions of joy, and causes them to cry out, I am my Beloveds, and my
Beloved is mine, Cant. 2.16. Hos. 11.1. When Israel was a child, then I loved
him. I taught Ephraim also to go, taking him by the arms, etc. God has a
special care of tender plants, and Christ does the rather reveal his love to
young Converts for their encouragement in the ways of grace: He oiles the
wheels of the soul: and imprints the sense of his love, which constrains them
to obedience: And hence it is, that young Converts are usually so active in the
ways of Religion; so forward and vehement.

hidden Manna too; Here Is a feast of fat things; the soul is satisfied as with
marrow and fatness. For the two great ends of this Sacrament to a Christian
are, 1. Growth in grace. 2. Sense of grace. Christians come hither, ad
corroborandum Titulum, to confirm their Title; and yet we must not think that
every true Christian that comes to the Sacrament, must needs have assurance:
For 1. Believers themselves may receive unworthily: as the Corinthians came
together for the worse, and not for the better, and therefore were chastened of
the Lord, etc. 1 Cor. 11.32. 2. Many that have much joy and sweetness from the
Sacrament, yet may not have it in so high a measure as to amount to Assurance:
All that truly partake of these heavenly dainties, do not go away equally
satisfied; Some have but a taste to cherish them, others have a full draught,
which does mightily cheer them.


some great and eminent service: he first sheds some of his love into their
hearts, which constrains them to obedience, and encourages them in it. Moses
would not stir without assurance of Gods presence. So God calls Joshua to an
honorable emploiment, and prepares him for so great a work, with a promise of
himself and his love: Fear not, be of good courage, I am with thee. I will
never fail th^e, nor forsake thee. So when God called Abraham to that great
work of sacrificing his son, he first warmes his heart with his love, and
seals up the Covenant of grace to him, and tells him, I am God alsufficient: I
am thy Buckler, and thy exceeding great reward. And thus he dealt with the
Prophets and Apostles, when he sent them upon great and dangerous messages: he
assures them that his directing and protecting mercy shall accompany them, and
this made them so undaunted.

Fourthly, praying times are sealing times: the same Spirit that endites the
Hannah had prayed, 1 Samuel 1.18. the text says, that her countenance was no
more sad. As its privilege of Assurance, that then we may with confidence cry
Abba, Father, so also its a great means to get assurance; Besides, we may pray
for assurance, and be importunate for one smile of his face, and his bowels
will not let him deny us: Hence such as are most frequent and powerful in
Prayer, are most blessed with assurance.

Fifthly, times of outward exigencies are s^aling times, 2 Cor. 4.16. Though
our outward man decay, yet our inward man is renewed daily: when all provision
failed the Israelites, then Mannah was rained down: so is this hidden Mannah
provided for sad and cloudy times: except in the case of total desertion, when
the soul has not the least glimpse shining upon it: But in outward and
temporal distresses God uses to reveal himself more immediately unto them: and
though the creature frown, yet he smiles upon them. Believers are Gods friends,
and it is not the part of a friend to forsake them in the saddest times. When
Saint John was banished into the Isle of Pa^mos, God shows him that glorious
Revelation; Paul and Silas, when in prison, are full of joy: and so with
Hezekiah.

Sixthly, times of victory and conquest over lusts and tentations, are sealing
Rev. 2 17. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden Manna: Thus
when Paul was conquering that great tentation, 2 Cor. 12.9. God then
strengthens him with this, My grace is sufficient for thee: So it was with that
noble Marquess of Vico: He never had such joy at Naples as he had at Geneva,
when he had conquered all tentations, and had trampled upon all relations for a
Savior. So the Mourners in Ezekiel, that would not yield to the abominations
of the times, must have a seal set on them. So that Virgin-company in the
Revelations, Ezekiel. 9.4. Rev. 7.3.

Quest. What use must Christians make of Assurance, when God gives it in to
them?

Answ. First, Times of assurance should be times of humility and dependence
Moses had been so long conversing with God on the Mount, presently at the foot
of the Mount he meets with matter of humiliation: the people having made them a
golden Calfe. When Paul had been in the third Heavens, then comes a Messenger
of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be exalted above measure. Pride, as it
twines about the sweetest graces, so it devoures the sweetest comforts. Yet
there is nothing that tends more to self-abasement, then the beholding Gods
face, and the seeing of his glory, this will make the soul abhor it self in
dust and ashes. None here ever saw more of Gods face then Moses and Paul, and
there were none that ever had lower apprehensions of themselves.

Secondly, Times of assurance should be times of trampling upon the creature,
and scorning of things below: we should not take care for corn, and wine, and
oil, when God lifts up the light of his countenance upon us: when we are in
our Fathers house, and the fatted Calfe is slain, we should not still feed upon
husks: when we are clothed with the Sun, we should trample the Moon under our
feet: and let others scramble for the world, who have nothing else to live on.

Solomon's Idolatry, 1 Kings 11.9. that he turned from the God of Israel that
had app^ared to him twice. To provoke God in a wilderness, is not so much as
to provoke him in a Paradise. Take heed therefore of turning the grace of God
into wantonness: but if God give thee a sense of his love, walk mo^e
steadfastly and accurately before him.

David did. Psalm. 34.8. O taste and see how gracious God is. Men look upon
Religion as a rigid and austere thing, that comes to rob them of their joy: but
thou can tell them of the sweetness that is in the ways of grace: thou
can assure them that all the ways of wisdom are pleasantness: Thou can
show them the goodly fruits of Canaan, that were cut down at the brook Esh^l.
Thou can assure them that there is no such joy to be found in the ways of
sin: that spiritual joy is the most clarified joy: that its solid joy, and
lasting joy. All the creatures make but a blaze: but the least spark of this is
immortal.

hidden Manna: though kept, it will not breed worms: storing up of former
evidences is a good provision against a cloudy day.

Canaan, what shall there be in the full Vintage? Is there such glory in one
beam of Gods face, what shall there be in an eternal Sunshine?

Quest. Who are the great enemies to this doctrine of Assurance?

Answ. Principally, the Papists and Arminians.

Quest. Upon what account do they so oppose it?

Answ. First, the Papists lay too much stresse upon good works: Now assurance
is too goodly a structure to be built upon such a foundation: they part stakes
between grace and merit, and so leave the soul in a tottering condition. For
they that would build their hopes upon their own good meanings, and their own
good wishes, and good resolutions, and good works, when they have done all,
they have built but the house of the Spider. But if men would but look to the
ebbings and flowings of their own spirits, to the waxings and wainings of their
own performances, surely they would acknowledge that they cannot fetch a
Plerophory out of these. Assurance cannot be founded on a bubble; It must be
built upon the free love of God in Christ; upon his royal word and oath: upon
the witness of the Holy Ghost, and seal of God himself, or it can never be
had. Hence dying Bellarmine was forced to acknowledge that the nearest way to
Assurance was only to rest upon the free grace of God in Christ.

Whosoever believes shall be saved, or into this conditional, If thou believe
thou shall be saved. Now this is so far from Assurance, that the devils
themselves do thus believe, and yet tremble. They will not allow the soul to
break the shell of a Promise, so as to come to the kernel; They allow not faith
to say, My Lord, and my God.

Thirdly, they deny Perseverance, and therefore must needs deny Assurance.

Yet the Arminians would reconcile Assurance and non-Perseverance. They allow a
man a little brief Assurance for a moment: a br^ve fulgur: a little shining of
joy, that only shows it self that it may vanish: their meaning amounts to thus
much: For that moment that thou art in the state of grace, thou may be sure
of it: but thou can not be sure that the next moment thou shall be in the
state of grace: and thus they think the grace of God to be as mutable and
inconstant as themselves are: whereas all Gods children are preserved by the
Power of God through faith unto salvation: and many of them can say with Paul,
Romans 8. ult. I am persuaded that neither life, nor death, nor Angels, etc.

Fourthly, they never had any assurance themselves, and so deny it unto others.
Thus the fool says in his heart there is no God, because he never had
communion

Upon this account Mr. Baxter denies assurance, because he never met with any,
nor can hear by others of any that have it, except some melancholy women that
pretend to it, and that for a moment only: But if he read the life of Mr.
Ignatius Jordan of Excester, and of Mr. John Bruen of Bruen Stapleford, he
shall find that they not only had assurance, but maintained it for many years
without interruption: the like he may find of many others in my first Part of
Lives: and in my Mirror or Looking-glass.

Ob. But Solomon says, Eccl. 7.1. No man knows love or hatred, therefore no
man can be assured of his salvation?

Answ. They leave out the latter words, by all that is before him, which show
Solomon's meaning to be this, that no man can know whether God loves him, or
hates him by any outward thing, as by prosperity or adversity, by health or
sickness, etc. wherein all things fall alike to all, good and bad.

Ob. But he says again, Prove. 28.14. Blessed is the man that fears always.
and if we must always fear, then we cannot be assured of our salvation?

Answ. First, we must distinguish of fear: It is either filial or servile: the

Secondly, though we must fear our selves, and our own weakness, to provoke

Ob. But Saint Paul says, Romans 11.39. Who knows the mind of the Lord? or who
was his Counselor? therefore we cannot know that we shall be saved?

Answ. First, his meaning is, that we cannot know the mind of God a priori,
Pet. 1.10.

Secondly, Or thus: we know not the reasons of many of Gods actions and David
professes for himself, Psalm. 131.1. But a^ posteriori we may, as the cause may
be proved by the effect, the Sun by its beams, the fire by heat, etc.

Ob. But Psalm. 19.13. David prays that presumptuous sins might not prevail
over him: therefore he feared they might, and so had no assurance?

Answ. First, David was not in doubt because he prayed so, but rather certain
of the contrary, because of this prayer of faith, as 1 John 5.14, 15. This is
the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his
Will, he hears us: and if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we
know that we have the Petitions that we desired of him.



Ob. But Saint Paul says, 1 Cor. 4.4. I know nothing by my self, yet am I not
hereby justified; but he that judges me is the Lord, therefore he had not
assurance?

Answ. First, Paul was not justified by any good thing in himself, had he
therefore no assurance? Can a man say, I know that I live not by stones,
therefore I cannot know that I live: this is a non sequitur.

Romans 8.38. Gal. 2.16, 20. Phil. 3.8, 9.

Ob. How can a child of God be assured of his salvation, being conscious to
himself, of so many and great sins?

Answ. First, all sins are remitted to those who are in Christ, and therefore
there is no condemnation to them, Romans 8.1.



Romans 3.25. and 4.25.

Ob. But I have so many doubts and fears, that I cannot have assurance?

Answ. First, doubts exercise faith, but do not extinguish it: Christ's
disciples had many doubts.





Ob. But Ezekiel. 18.24. A righteous man may fall from his righteousness, and
therefore can have no assurance?

Answ. First, Suppositions are no positions: he does not say that a righteous
man may fall from his righteousness. but if he do fall, etc.





Quest. But how can assurance stand with the humble, and base esteem which a
Christian should have of himself.

Answ. First, humility fights not with certainty, being an effect of it, Psalm.
130.4.

and are humbled; with the other they look upon Christ and free grace, and are
assured; with the first, Paul looking upon himself, cries out that he was the
least of Saints, and chiefest of sinners; with the other he looks upward, and
triumphs with assurance, Romans 8.38.39.

Ob. But this is a doctrine of liberty. If men may be assured that they shall
be saved, then they may live as they lust.

Answ. First, no such matter, for God will not put new wine into old hidden
Manna shall be put into it. Indeed if God should seal up his love to an
unregenerate man, whilst he hankers after his lusts, he would make such an ill
use of it, as to turn the grace of God into wantonness: when the Sun shines
upon dunghils, they send forth the greater stink: but when it shines on sweet
herbs and flowers, they send forth a more fragrant smell. God sets his seal on
none, but such as have an happy conformity to him, and a full compliance with
him: Such as have the same interests, and the same glorious ends with himself:
such as delight in his Law, and feed upon his Precepts as upon an honey-combe:
such as have an antipathy against sin, yea, against the very appearance of it:
such as are ready to pull out their right eyes, and cut off their right hands
for him: and therefore there is no danger that such will abuse their assurance
to liberty.

Secondly, Sons of God that have this assurance, are led by the Spirit of God,
cannot walk after the flesh, Romans 8.1. They are borne of God and cannot sin, i.
e. wittingly, and wilfully as wicked men do, 1 John 3.9. they hate it as God
hates it: they hate it more then hell, and therefore there is no danger that
they will abuse mercy to liberty.

Thirdly, nothing is more industrious then saving faith. It looks so to the end
[Salvation] as withal its most industrious in the use of means to attain it:

Fourthly, love is a sweeter, surer, and stronger principle of obedience then
Cor. 5.14.

Fifthly, Experience manifests that none walk more exactly and closely Thy
Will be done in earth as it is in Heaven: and whereas they say, there is more
danger in frail men that dwell in houses of clay; we answer,

1. They should entertain more honorable thoughts of the excellent ones of the
earth, whom God now steeps in his own nature, and love, to prepare them
gradually for Heaven.

2, Though there may be some unworthy dealing by them with their God, yet these
flow only from those relics of slavish principles that remain in them, from
some fragments of the old leaven that was not purged out, not by virtue of a
Gospel Plerophorie. Does the knowing that we are the sons of light dispose us
to works of darkness? It Is true, the sons of God may provoke him, but must
they therefore needs do it under this very notion, because they know that they
are sons? nay, must they do it the more for this? Truly this were greater
malice then the devils themselves are capable of; it involves also a flat
contradiction: because they know that they are friends, therefore they will
deal like enemies: and because they know they are sons, therefore they will
deal like slaves. But if they yet doubt whether assurance does advance
obedience, let them compare men assured of their salvation. 1. With others in
the state of grace that want assurance, and then tell us whether they do not
differ as much as a bruised Reed from a stately Cedar. What faintings and
palenesse is there in the one? what vigor and liveliness in the soul of the
other? one is left to the pleasure of a wave, when the other lies safe at
Anchor. 2. Compare them with men in an unregenerate condition, what a vast
difference is betwixt them? sure you do not question whether God has more
service from the Israelites that feed upon hidden Manna? Or from Egyptians,
that feed upon Garlic and Onions? Wicked men by fears and terrors of the Law
may be restrained, and may spend a few sighs, and drop a few tears sometimes,
but when they are thus washed, they soon return to their wallowing in the mire:
whereas they that are assured of their salvation are constant and cheerful, and
uniforme in their obedience.

3. That God has other Rods enough to awaken them out of a sinful security,
though he do not disinherit them. Remember what God speaks to David, Psalm.
89.31, 32. If his children break my statutes, and keep not my Commandments,
then will I visit their transgressions with the Rod, and their iniquity with
stripes, etc. God will make them know what a bitter thing it is for them to
depart from him, and forsake their first love. For

1. They may fall from assurance: though they cannot lose the seed and root of
grace, yet they may lose the flourishing and fragrancy of it: Though the
foundation of God remain sure, yet they may lose their comfort. Though they be
built on a rock, they may be dashed with waves: Though the seal of God remains
sure, yet they may deface the Print of it, so as that it may not be visible to
their eye: Now we may easily conceive what a sad alteration this will be.

2. They may fall into a total desertion even so as to look upon God as an
enemy, and instead of a Filial Plerophory, may have a fearful expectation of
the fierce wrath of God; God may dip his pen in gall, and write bitter things
against them, and his envenomed arrows may stick fast in them: so that they may
be excommunicated from that happy and heavenly intercourse that once they had
with God.

Quest. What diligence is required of us about this assurance?

Answ. First, we must use diligence to get this assurance. For

1. There are but few that have any right to the love of God in Christ. It Is a
principle in morality that intimate friendship cannot be extended to many.
Friends usually go by pairs. Now though God be of vast and boundless love, yet
he chooses to concentricate it all in a few picked out of the world that he
might engage them the more unto himself.

2. Of those few whom he loves, all are not assured of it: Though he loved them
with an everlasting love, yet he manifested it in time: not before they had a
being; nor whilst they were in the state of nature; nor when they were new
born children: For babes in Christ cannot presently cry Abba Father. They are
not assured, nor sealed till the Spirit comes, and stamps a clear impression of
Gods love upon their softened and melted spirits.

2. We must use diligence to keep assurance: It Is a jewel that deserves our
best care. Take heed of loosing the White-stone: Take heed of forgetting the
new Name? Art thou weary of the Sunshine, and would thou cool thy self in
the shade? Do thou begin to loath thy Manna, and would thou return to
the Garlic, and Onions of Egypt? O remember thou did not so soon obtain
assurance, and will thou so soon lose it?

Thirdly, give diligence to recover assurance if thou have lost it. O when will
Awake O South wind, and with thy gentle breathings blow upon the garden that
the spices thereof may flow out. Never leave till thou find thy Spouse
again: Tell him that thou art sick of love: that thou longest for a cluster of
Canaan: that thou art even famished for want of hidden Manna. Lay thy heart
before him, and tell him that thou desire new stamps and impressions of his
love: Tell him that thou have lost the print, yet he has not lost the seal:
Tell him that thou would now more prize his love then ever thou did, or
could before: Give him no rest till he give thy soul rest, and fill it with
himself: O desire him to shine out upon thee a little before thou go hence,
and be no more seen.

Quest. Why does assurance require such diligence?

Answ. First, because of the deceitfulness of the heart that is so apt to
hidden Manna in their mouths. They never knew what a scruple was, and wonder
that others trouble themselves with them. These have a key to heaven of their
own making, and think they can go to it when they please. Thus do vain men
cheat their own souls: whereas it were their wiser way rather to commune with
their own spirits, to see what a false print they are of: what corruptions and
degenerations from the Original: what are the genuine, and what are the
spurious works of the Spirit.

Secondly, we have diligent enemies that would faigne quench our joy, and Prove.

Thirdly, give diligence, because it is a matter of such great consequence, and
great was the fall of it. There is a counterfeit assurance, called presumption
that great devourer of souls that slays its ten thousands: O what misery is it
for a man to take himself to be in the ready way to heaven, when he is dropping
into hell: To expect no less then a crown of glory, when he can find nothing
but chains of darkness, and a gnawing worm.

Quest. But what kind of diligence is required to get assurance?

Answ. First, be diligent in self reflection: A clean heart chews the cud, and
ruminates upon its own actions: Try thy graces by a Scripture Sun-beame: Compel
thy thoughts to come in that they may drink sweetness out of their own
fountain, and that they may be satisfied as with marrow and fatness.
Assurance consists in a reflex act, and by such workings it is maintained.

O that I were sure of heaven and happiness, etc. But this great blessing
deserves a fervent prayer: The white stone is given to none but conquerours: As
assurance does mightily enliven prayer, so prayer cherishes and maintains
assurance. Go then to God: Be importunate with him: beg a smile, a beam of his
face: Desire him to take all thy worldly things again, unless he will sweeten
them with his love. Tell him thou can live no longer on husks, and therefore
desire him to give thee something that its fit for a soul to live on.

Plerophory.

Quest. Why does assurance deserve our best diligence?

Answ. First, hereby the soul is provided for eternity: Thou may then say,
Thy lot is fallen unto thee in ^ good ground, thou have a pleasant heritage.
Thou can desire no more then to be assured that thou shall be for ever happy:
What would the damned in Hell give for a possibility of happiness? What would
some wounded spirits give but for hopes and probabilities of it?



1. Thou art secure against the frowns of the world, for heaven smiles upon
thee. Thou may laugh at the slanders and reproaches of men: For when the
world brands thee, the Spirit seals thee, etc.

2. Thou art secure in times of judgment. For judgments are intended for the
sweeping away of Spiders webs, not for the sweeping away of Gods own jewels: Or
if thou be involved in the common calamity, yet how is this pill rolled up
in sweetness to thee, when others can taste nothing but gall, and wormwood. Thy
body may be tossed in the world, but thy soul lies safe at Anchor.

3. Thou art secure in the hour of death: Thou know that providence only
means to break the shell that it may have the kernel. Let such tremble at the
approaches of death that know not what shall become of their precious souls,
but thou may safely trample upon the Adder, etc. This made the Martyrs
embrace the flames, etc. Assurance of the love of God in Christ, and nothing
else pulls out the sting of death: Indeed death has lost its sting in respect
of all that are in Christ; but yet such as know not that they are in Christ,
fear death still as if it had a sting: Only an assured Christian triumphs over
it, and says with Saint Paul, O death where is thy sting? 1 Cor. 15.55.

4. Assurance fills the soul with praise, and thankfulness. The real presence
of a mercy is not enough: there must be the appearance of a mercy, and the
sense of it before it fill thy heart with joy, and thy mouth with praise: A
doubting Christian is like a bird in a snare* the soul has not its comfort,
nor God his praise: An assured Christian is like a bird at liberty that flies
aloft, and sings cheerfully, etc.

See Mr. Culverwels White-stone, and Dr. Tailor.

Quest. How may it be proved by Scripture that a man may be assured of his
salvation?

Answ. First, By Romans 8.16. The Spirit of God testifies with our spirits that

Quest. But how can Gods Spirit give witness, seeing now there are no
revelations?

Answ. First, indeed extraordinary revelations are ceased: yet Gods Spirit may,
and does in, and by the Word reveal some things to men, whence he is the spirit
of revelation, Ephesians. 3.5.

Secondly, Gods Spirit gives testimony by applying the promises for the
remission 1. The means: For it is ordinarily wrought by hearing, reading,
meditation, prayer, etc. but presumption arises in the brain, either without
such means, or if by them, yet with want of Gods blessing concurring with them.
2. The effects and fruits of the Spirit: For it stirs up the heart to prayer,
Zach. 12.10. and that with sighs and groans, Romans 8.26. arising from the sense
of our miserable condition.


The second testimony is our spirit, i. e. our conscience sanctified, and
renewed 1. By a grief of heart for offending God, called godly sorrow, 1 Cor.
7.10. 2. By a resolution, and full purpose, and endeavor to obey God in all
things. 3. By savouring the things of the Spirit, Romans 8.5. i. e. by doing the
works of the Spirit with joy and cheerfulness of heart, as in the presence of
God.


Quest. But what if both these testimonies are wanting, what must we do then?

Answ. Have recourse to the first beginnings of sanctification, which are these.

1. To feel our inward corruptions. 2. To be displeased with our selves for
them. 3. To begin to hate sin. 4. To grieve so often as by sin we offend God. 5.
To avoid the occasions of sin. 6. To endeavor to do our duty, and to use good
means diligently. 7. To desire to sin no more. 8. To pray to God for his grace.
Secondly, by Psalm. 15.1, etc. where the question is propounded, who of the is,
He that walks uprightly before God, deals justly with men, speaks the truth
from his heart, etc.

Joh. 5.13. where three things are evinced.

1. That he that has communion and fellowship with God in Christ may be
undoubtedly assured of his salvation: which the apostle tells was the end of
preaching the Gospel to them, chap. 1.3, 4. where also he gives four
infallible notes of salvation.

1. By remission of sins through the blood of Christ, v. 7.

Object. But how may this pardon of sin be known?

Answ. He answers. First, by our humble and hearty confession of them to God,
v. 9. Secondly, if our consciences are pacified by the blood of Christ, Romans
5.1. 1 John 3.21.

2. By the sanctifying spirit whereby we are renewed in holiness and
righteousness, 1 John 3.24. 3. By holiness, and uprightness of heart, and
life, 1 John 1.6, 7. 4. By perseverance in the knowledge, and obedience to the
Gospel, 1 John 2.24.
2. He that is the adopted Son of God shall be undoubtedly saved, 1 John 3.2.
Romans 8.17.

Object. But how shall we know our Adoption?

Answ. By these signs.

1. If thou truly beleevest in the Son of God, Gal. 3.26. 1 John 3.23. 2. By
a hearty desire, and earnest endeavor to be cleansed from thy corruptions, 1 John 3.3. 3. By the love of a Christian, because he is a Christian, 1 John
3.10, 11, 12, etc.
3. They that are assured of the love of God to them in particular, may also be
assured of their salvation, 1 John 4.9. and Gods love to us may be known, 1. By
our love to the brethren, 1 John 4.20, 21. 2. By our love to God, 1 John 4.19.
which is also known by two signs. 1. By our conformity to him in holiness: A
child that loves his father will tread in his steps, 1 John 4.17. not in
equality and perfection, but in similitude, and conformity. 2. By the
weanedness of our affections from the things of the world, 1 John 2.15.



Tim. 2.19. the foundation of God remains sure, having this seal, The Lord
knows who are his, etc. i. e. the decree of Gods election stands firm, and
sure: So that they which are elected shall never totally and finally fall away.

Quest. But how shall I know that I am elected?

Answ. Paul answers: By the spirit of prayer and invocation: and by a care to
forsake all sin: Let every one that calls upon the Name of the Lord depart from
iniquity.

Pet. 1.10. Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure, etc. and
this he tells may be done by getting and exercising those graces mentioned, v.
5, 6, 7.

Mr. Perkins 2. Vol. p. 18, etc.

Is there any good to be gotten by departing from Christ? by leaving our first
love? by quenching the spirit? and making Apostasy from former degrees of
grace and holiness? can any son of Iesse do for us as Christ can? Or do we
think to mend our selves by running out of Gods blessing into the worlds warm
Sun? as D^mas did. O call me not Naomi (may such say) but call me Marah: for I
went out full, but come home empty: For indeed so do revolted Christians, when
they come from the act of sinning: when they have been seeking after their
sweet-hearts: they went with their hearts full of peace, and hands full of
plenty, and meeting with a bargain of sinning, they thought to seek out their
happiness, and make it fuller (as Solomon did) but they come home empty: empty
of comforts, but laden with crosses; they have lost their evidences, are
excommunicated from the power of Ordinances; are under the terror of wounded
spirits, are buffetted by Satan: are out of hope of ever recovering the
radiancy of their graces; have their back-burden of their afflictions, so that
they are enforced to confess it to be the greatest madness in the world to buy
the sweetest, and profitablest sin at so dear a rate. So David found it, and
the Sulamite, Cant. 5.1, 2.

Quest. Wherein stands the difference between assurance and presumption?

Answ. First, assurance is built upon the righteousness of Christ, the grace of
Paul's assurance, 1 Cor. 15.10. By the grace of God I am that I am; But
presumption is built,

1. Upon self-ignorance: men know not what themselves are, not what sin is:
Hence they think themselves righteous when they are great sinners, Romans 7.9.
Luke 18.9, etc. so Rev, 3.17.

2. Upon self-love: which is that false glass that most look themselves in,
which makes all seem good that they are, have, or do. Hence, Prove. 16.2. and
30.12.

3. Upon self-righteousness, which flows from the two former.

4. Upon ignorance and mistakes about the nature of grace, or upon false
principles: such as these, 1. That shows are substance: or that to seem
religious is to be so. So Mat. 23.28. 2. That common gifts are special grace:
that Parts are Piety: or that a civil and moral conversation is a regenerate
condition. This will be discovered to be the presumption of many at the last
day, Mat. 7.22, 23. 3. That profession is practice: that trimming of Lamps is
having of oil. So Matthew. 25.6, 7. and that the form of godliness is the power
thereof: and outward performances the substance of Piety, whereas, 2 Timothy 3.5.
4. That restraint of sin is mortification, or putting off the old man: or
that cutting off the branches of sin, is plucking it up by the root: That
outward cleansing is inward purifying. So Math. 23.25. 5. That men's hearts may
be good, though their tongues, hands and lives be bad.


5. It Is sometimes built upon outward prosperity: They hope God loves them, and
will save them, because he has given them so many good things, all these
bottomes are like the house built upon the sands, Mat. 7.27.

Secondly, they differ in the means by which they are obtained, and maintained.

1. Godly sorrow for sin. For Christ gives rest to such, Matthew. 11.28. so Luke
7.38, 48.

2. Soul-searching and self-examination: or by a frequent comparing our hearts
with Gods Word, and communing with them about the proper effects of grace, and
fruits of the Spirit in us.

3. By the illumination and testimony of Adoption.

4. By the Ordinances of the Word, Sacraments, prayer, and a holy and constant
use of them, 1 Job. 5.13.

5. By conflicts with doubts, and by resistance of unbelief: as Mark 9.24. so
that assurance is not ordinarily obtained without much pains. Hence, 2 Pet.
1.10. But presumption is gotten without means or pains: without sorrow for
sin, self-examination, etc. sponte nascitur: It grows up of its own accord,
which is a sign that its a weed, and not an herb of grace.

Again, as assurance is bred, so it is fed, and maintained by means, viz. the
constant exercise and discovery of grace: the careful performance of duties,
avoiding sin, maintaining communion with God, etc. whereas presumption, as its
gotten, so it is maintained without care, or cost.



1. Assurance endears God to the soul to love him, delight in him, long after
him, and fear to offend him, and to be careful to serve and please him, Ephesians.
4.29, 30.31. but presumption stirs up no affections to God, such, love him no
better, fear him no more: leave not sin, not amend their ways.

2. It makes men jealous of themselves, and fearful least they should miscarry:
They are assured they shall stand, yet take heed lest they fall: that they
shall be saved, yet wo^k it out with fear and trembling, Psalm. 2.11. Phil.
2.12. But presumption makes men foolhardy, and unsuspitious that they shall
either fail or fall.

3. Assurance humbles the heart in sight, and sense of Gods great goodness, and
of its own unworthiness. The higher a soul is lifted up by assurance, the lower
it is in its own eye, magnifying God and debasing it self. It compassionates
and pities others, and prays for them, but presumption makes men proud, and
well-conceited of their own worth, and despisers of others. So Luke 18.11. I am
not as other men, etc.

4. Assu^ance grows by degrees to a plerophory, it comes not all at once: But
presumption is at its full strength at first.

5. Assurance bears up the heart from sinking under greatest afflictions: as it
supported Christ in the height of his Passion, Matthew. 27.46. so it did David's
at Ziglag, 1 Samuel 20.6. But presumption suffers the heart to faint at such
times; and it becomes like Nabals, 1 Samuel 25.37. when carnal hopes fail, the
heart fails, and such soon fall into despair.

6. Assurance joins means and end together: and makes us as careful to use
means, as confidently to expect the end of our faith, the salvation of our
souls: As to wait upon God in all his Ordinances, to walk universally in all
his ways, etc. But presumption divides between the end and the means, and feeds
a man with vain hopes, as 1. That he may go to heaven though he live in sin. 2.
That he may come to heaven, though he use no means, etc.


7. Assurance fears not, nor flies trial, but desires it for discovery whether
it be found or no: but presumption shuns examination, and cannot endure to be
tried. Like counterfeit coin that cannot endure the touchstone, or false
wares that decline the light.



Assurance is much assaulted by Satan's tentations, by natural unbelief, doubts,
fears: Its disturbed and weakened by sin, especially if it be indulged, and by
the neglect of holy duties, yea, of lukewarmness in them: But presumption is
troubled with none of these. Mr. Reyers Precepts.

Quest. By what further arguments may it be proved that this assurance may be
attained?

Answ. First, Because God bids us make it sure, 2 Pet. 1.10. 2 Cor. 13.5.

Secondly, If a man may know that he believes, then he may be assured of his
Joh. 2.3.

Thirdly, If a man may know that he is sanctified, then he may be assured that
Romans 8.30. therefore,

Fourthly, If we may have peace toward God: yea that peace that passes all
Romans 15.13. then we may be assured of our salvation.

Fifthly, If we have entrance with confidence into Gods presence, Ephesians. 3.12.

Obj. But its pride and presumption?

Answ. Yea, if we look for salvation by any thing in our selves: but we are
assured of it only for Gods free mercy, and Christ's merits: besides God
requires it of us, and its pride to disobey God.

Obj. No man's name is in the Scripture?

Answ. But there is better, for there is the believers nature and properties.

Obj. But the promises are set down generally, or indefinitely, not
particularly to me?

Answ. We may by a true, and sound reasoning make it good to our selves: Thus
we do from the general propositions of the Law, infer particular conclusions:
For how know you, that you have deserved Gods wrath, and damnation? But because
the Scripture curses all the transgressors of the Law, Deuteronomy. 27.26. but I have
broken the Law, says my conscience: therefore you conclude that you are under
the curse: so may we do from the Gospel. Who so believes in Christ shall be
saved: but I believe in Christ, therefore I shall be saved: The weary, lost and
laden shall have mercy; but so am I, therefore I shall have mercy.

Obj. But we are bidden to work out our salvation with fear and trembling?

Answ. Not with a slavish fear: For we must serve God without fear all our
days, Luke 1.74. but with a godly fear of offending, which stands well with
Assurance.

CHAP. XV. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Astrology, and Seekers to
Astrologers.
Quest. WHo are Astrologers?

Answ. Such as gaze on the Heavens to read the fates and fortunes (as they
term them) of men and States, persons and people in them, and to foretell from
thence what good or evil shall befall them. Such were of old held in high esteem
with the Babylonians, Dan. 1.^0. and 2.2 and 4.7. and 5.7, 11, 15. Also with
other Nations, Dan. 2.10. and with the ungodly Jews, Isa. 47.13, 14, 15. with
whom they did consult about their wei^hty affairs, because they took upon them
to foretell things to come. They are called Star-gazers, and monthly
Prognosticators, Isa. 47.13. They are joined with Magicians, Sorcerers,
Chaldeans, Dan. 2.2, 10. Soothsayers, Dan. 4.7. Wisemen, Dan. 5.15.

Quest. How may it be proved that this kind of Divination is unlawful?

Answ. First, that which the Word of God condemns as a grand offense, is Deuteronomy.
18.10, 11. There shall not be found amongst you any one that uses Divination,
or an Observer of times, or an Enchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a
Consulter with familiar spirits, or a Wizard, or a Necromancer: for all that do
these things are an abomination to the Lord. And the looking after them is
expressed by going a whoring after them, Lev. 20.6. So Isa 2.6. Thou have
forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the
East, and are Soothsayers like the Philistines. And Isa. 47.13, 14. Thou art
wearied in thy couns^ls: Let now the Astrologers, the Star-gazers, the monthly
Prognosticators stand up, and save thee from those things that shall come upon
thee: Behold, they shall be as stubble, the fire shall burn them: God forbids
his people to learn these Arts, Jer. 10.2. Thus says the Lord, Learn not the
way of the Heath^n, and be not dismayed at them. They are called liars, Isa.
44.25. That frustrateth the tokens of the Liars, and makes the Diviners madd.
Such are reckoned up with other Diabolical Arts, as being of the same kind,
Dan. 2.2. and Acts 19.18, 19, 20. -- Many which used curious Arts (such as this
is) brought their books, and burned them before all men, and counted the price
of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver, etc. and this is
ascribed to the power of the Gospel, v. 20.

Isa. 41.22.23. Show things to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are
gods* where we see that knowing, and declaring things to come is as peculiar a
prerogative of God as to know men's hearts.

Isa. 5.12. and the Apostle is as severe against every one that withdraws from
Christ, Col. 2.8, 18* 19. Now that these Prognosticators withdraw men's minds
from Christ, may be gathered from that opposition that is put between them by
Moses, Deuteronomy. 18.10, to 16. where they must not hearken to Sorcerers that they
may hearken to Christ: and whilst men ascribe successes good or bad to the
stars, they withdraw their minds from beholding God in his works.

Isai 44.15. that frustrateth the tokens of the Liars, and makes the Diviners
mad. If they speak true at any time, it is more by hap than any skill. For
though Eclipses of the Sun, and Moon, and Conjunctions of other Planets may be
certainly fo^eknown: yet there is no such certainty of the effects that we may
divine thereby, for they are but general, partial, and remote Causes of Events
in States, and affairs of men: and there is no certain connection between Causes
general, partial, and remote, and their Effects. Besides, those Effects which
depend on other Causes, upon which the Heavens have either none, or no direct
power, cannot be certainly known by the Positions of the Heavens: but so it is
with humane affairs: therefore the affairs of men depend principally on Gods
Providence, and under him on the wills and minds of men. That Gods Providence
orders things concerning Men and States is proved: Ephesians. 1.11. He works
all things after the counsel of his own will; and that not always according to
the ordinary disposition of second Causes: but turning and overruling things
in a secret way beyond the intentions of men, and the ordinary virtue of second
Causes: so we see in Rehoboam's folly. 2 Chronicles. 10.15. Amaziah's frowardness. 2 Chronicles. 25.10. Hence Eccles. 9.11. The race is not to the swift, etc. and Psalm.
75, 4, etc. Promotion comes neither from the East, etc. But God is Judge: he
pulls down one, and sets up another. Again, the Stars have no power over men's
souls, and minds: the Heathen could say: Sapiens dominabitur Astris. A wise
man will rule over the stars. At the most, that which they have, is but by way
of inclination, which grace, education, civil wisdom, and many other things may
oversway. Besides, the affairs of men, and Nations are prospered, and blasted,
not according to the use of natural means, but according to their carriage
toward God, as they are (...) or obedient, penient or impenitent; and men act
in these moral performances as they are assisted, or deserted by God: for which
see, Isai 6.9, etc. Ezekiel. 36.25, 26, 33, 34.

Object. But though they be not certain Causes, may they not be certain Signs
of things to come?

Answ. No: for if they be signs fore-shewing events, they must either be so by
nature, as smoke is a sign of fire: or by institution, as an Ivy-bush is a sign
of Wine to be sold: but they are so in neither of these senses: therefore they
cannot be natural signs, because there is no natural connection between the
Constellations, and humane Events: and whereas it is said, Genesis 1.14. Let them
be for signs, and for seasons; for days, and for years: the meaning is, they
are signs for the things which they cause, as the seasons of the year which
they do both make, and signify: or if they should be granted in general to be
signs yet could we not certainly prognosticate any thing by them except we had
particular Comments on them to declare what they signify, either by divine
revelation, or by solid experience: but no such Comment is to be had, and
therefore we have no certain fore-knowledg by them. Divine revelation is not
pretended to, and a certain experience we have not: for experience arises from
often observing the same thing, as a Physician knows by experience that Rubarb
purges Choler, because he has often tried it, and ever finds it so: but we
can have no such experience of the effect of the Stars: 1. Because the Heavens
do scarce ever return to the same Position: for though some great Conjunctions
be the same, yet there are infinite numbers of Stars (which also have their
influences) that agree not with, and so may vary the effects of the other. 2.
When Events follow these Conjunctions it cannot certainly be known that they
are the effects of them, for that many things fall out together accidentally
without connection, or dependence one upon another. 3. We see experiences
uncertain, for that Twins born under the same constellation differ extremely in
disposition, and event, as we see in Esau and Jacob, and whereas they say, that
by reason of the swift motions of the Heavens, a little time makes a great
difference in their Position. Saint Austin answers, that yet their conceptions
were both in an instant, though their birth differed a little: and Ludovicus
vives adds, that this overthrows all certainty of divining by the stars,
because by reason of the swiftnnesse of their motion, they suddenly alter their
positions, so that a man can never give an exact judgment of any birth,
because he cannot exactly know the minute of his nativity. 5. Identity of
effects does not only depend upon the efficient, but the matter also: so that
if we could be sure that the Position of the Heavens were the same as they were
a hundred years ago, yet the same events will not follow, because of the
difference of men in diverse ages and climates, of diverse tempers, educations,
moral, and intellectual principles, etc. and why may not the influence of the
stars produce diverse effects upon men of diverse dispositions, as we see a hen
sometimes hatches chickens, other times ducks, partridges, etc. because of
different eggs set under her.

5. Arg. That which nourishes vain, and forbidden hopes, and fears is
Astrological predictions: therefore, fear, and hope by reason of the signs of
heaven is forbidden, Jer. 10.2. Learn not the way of the Heathen, neither be
dismayed at the signs of heaven, for the Heathen are dismayed at them.

Object. But Astrologers often hit right in their predictions, therefore it seems
there is certainty in their Art?

Answ. First, Do Astrologers tell right some times? So do Witches, yet all

Secondly, Astrologers do also many times miss in their predictions. For Isa.
tokens of these liars are frustrated. Only this favor they find amongst the
multitude, that their mistakes are not regarded though they be many: their
predictions that fall out right, are observed, and remembered though they be few.



Augustine, Master Perkins, and others tell us of conscientious men who have
been glad to leave off this study, because of the uncertainty they have found
in the Rules of it. And Satan may help curious heads in this way, because
besides his own knowledge, which enables him oft-times to guess shrewdly, he
may be permitted by God in a judiciary way to be a true Spirit in the mouth of
liars, as he was a lying spirit in the mouth of Ahabs prophets. See for it,
Deuter. 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Object. But it is said, Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
Acts 7.22. and Daniel of the Chaldeans, Dan. 1.17, 20. and Astrology was part
of that learning, and therefore either its lawful, or they learned an unlawful
Art?

Answ. There be two things in Astrology. 1. The Theory. 2. The Practice: Now
many have studied the Theory, that have renounced the practice, finding that
nothing could be done by it in a natural way. And it is very probable that all
the learning that these holy men had in this Art (if they had any) was but in a
Theoretical way: there is no footstep of their practice of it in all their
stories, but of the contrary. For we read in the second, fourth, and fifth
chapters of Daniel, that he was never called in with the Magicians, but after
them, which shows that he was not of their society: Also when he went about
searching out secrets, he went not to his books but to his prayers: not to
consult with the stars, but with God, as Dan. 2, 17, etc.

Object. But are not the stars very powerful, and causes of many strange
effects? and are not effects known by their causes? why then may we not divine
by them?

Answ. Though they have a great influence upon inferior bodies, yet we cannot
divine by them touching humane affairs; For,

1. They cannot act but within their own sphere, which is in corporeal things:
but humane affairs, though acted by men's bodies, yet they are guided by their
spirits, which in nature are out of the sphere of the Heavens operation: and
their successes and miscarriages are from divine providence: therefore whatever
may be prognosticated by them concerning elementary bodies; yet for men, their
virtue is so short in working on them, that it can give no light to judge of
their future affairs.

2. Where the power of working is acknowledged, yet our knowledge of their
virtues, and operations is so dim that we cannot divine by it: For the
influences of all, or most of the stars are unknown to us; and when all of them
have their influences conjoined, who can say this effect is from the virtue of
this star, and not from another.



That which most godly and learned men upon experience have renounced, and
repented of, that is neither to be practiced, countenanced, nor tolerated: But
godly men have renounced and repented of their study of Astrology: therefore,
the Minor is thus proved. St. Augustine, the glory of his age for piety,
learning, and solid judgment; confesses that he had been addicted to these
vain studies: But by the grace of God he afterward renounced them as an art
condemned by true piety, affirming that it was a great error, a great madness,
and a suspicion that might easily be refelled: He also mentions another on Psa.
63. that repented of, and renounced this wicked Art, as being as bad as
Paganism, and Judaisme. Aug. de Doct. Christ. l. 2. c. 21. So says holy
Master Perkins. I long studied this Art, and was never quiet till I had seen
all the secrets of it: But at length it pleased God to lay before me the
profaneness of it, nay, I dare boldly say, Idolatry, although it be covered
with fair and golden shows: therefore that which I speak with grief, I desire
thee to note with some attention. Mr. Briggs also, sometimes Geometry Reader at
Oxford: a man eminent for piety, and his skill in the Mathematics, upon a
question moved to him by my Author, touching judicial Astrology, told him,
that when he went first to Cambridge, he thought it a brave thing to be of Gods
counsel, to forsee, and foretell secrets, resolving to attain to that skill
whatever labor it cost him: so accordingly after a while he fell upon the
study of the Mathematics, laying good foundation by going through Arithmetic,
Geometry, and Astronomy, not resting till he had attained exactness therein:
Then he fell upon judicial Astrology: But there he found his expectation wholly
frustrate, for there was no certainty in the Rules of it: Having therefore
tired both body and wits in vain, he at last repaired to a man in Cambridge,
famous in that Art, and a maker of Prognostications, to whom he bemoaned
himself: for that he had bestowed so much pains to be an expert Astrologer, but
the uncertainty of its Rules did now deceive his hopes: whereto the Astrologer
replied, that the rules of that Art were uncertain indeed, neither were there
any cure for it. Whereupon Mr. Briggs left that study. Yea, he affirmed that he
would undertake to the skilfullest Astrologer in the world, that let him set
down any conclusion touching either man or State, yea, or weather, and he would
prove that it would fall out so, and that it would not fall out so from their
own Rules and Principles: He said also that his opinion was, that they that
addicted themselves to the practice of Divining Astrology, the Devil did at
first lend his secret assistance, and at length by degrees, if God prevented
not, entise them into a contract.

Quest. But who may be said to practice this unlawful Art?

Answ. First, all such as calculate men's nativities, and thereby divine what
Almanack-makers as take upon them to foretell future contingents, as what
weather it will be every day, etc.

Quest. Who be the countenancers of this unlawful Art?

Answ. First, such as go to them to have their Nativities calculated,

Secondly, such as buy or read their books, unless it be with a purpose Lev.
20.6.

Thirdly, such as believe their predictions, and are affected with joy, or
sorrow

Fourthly, such as talk of their predictions as things that have something in

Fifthly, by applauding their predictions, and applying them to other

Quest. How and when are Astrologers tolerated?

Answ. First, when their books are licensed, or not prohibited: when they are
suffered to go abroad, and not suppressed.

Gerees Astrologomastix.

Quest. How many sorts of foretelling things are there?

Answ. Three, 1. Divine: such as are by God himself, or by the Prophets
inspired by him.



Witches, Sorc^rers* Astrologers, etc.

Quest. Are these diabolical predictions lawful?

Answ. No. For, 1. It is only the property of God, and of the Scriptures to
foretell things to come: and therefore such Astrologers as take upon them to
foretell things, not natural but voluntary, and such as are merely subject to
men's wills, do not only undertake a vain, rash, and false thing, but that also
which is very abominable and wicked.

Witches, Sorcerers, Soothsayers, and Astrologers to seduce the world out of
the right way. As Cardan, who rose to that height of impiety, as to calculate
Christ's birth, and made his power to work miracles to flow from the influence
of the stars under which he was borne. Others have been bad, though not so bad,
as Petrus de Aliaco, who thought that the time of Christ's birth might have been
foretold by the stars: and Kepler contends, that those Wisemen by the Rules of
Astrology might have presaged, not only some strange event, but the birth of
some great Monarch: As if Christ were not born after an extraordinary, and
miraculous manner. I deny not but that the Heavens have influences upon men's
bodies: hence that man possessed with a Devil was said to be Lunatic, probably
because the Devil took the opportunity at that time of the Moon, wherein
humors do most abound, then to disturb and distract him: but the Heavens were
never made for books to reveal what should come to pass.

Witches Sorcerers, and Astrologers are often condemned in Scripture, as, Lev.
19.26. and 20.27. Deuteronomy. 10.11, etc. Isa. 45.12, etc. Besides, all the Fathers
speak with much vehemence against them: Many Counsels have condemned them: yea,
diverse of the wiser sort of Heathens have cried out upon them. Ptolomy himself
acknowledges that no certain truth can be foretold by them. Tully wrote
several books de Divinatione, condemning such Diviners. Instancing that before
a great battle the Mice had gnawen the buckler of a soldier, whereupon the
Soothsayer concluded that that war should be fatal and unlucky: as if (faith
Tully) because mice did gnaw some books that I have of Plato's De Republica,
therefore I should conclude that our Commonwealth shall be destroyed. And we
read Acts 19.19. of many who being converted* brought their books about such
curious Arts, and burnt them. We may read more hereof in Pererius, Spanhemius,
Zanchy, and others.

Fourthly, if the Heavens were true, and proper causes, or necessary signs,

Fifthly, if the Heavens be causes, yet they are only universal causes: now

Sixthly, if Astrological Predictions were allowed, it would bring in a
contempt How could I help it, seeing I am borne under such a star: As Saint
Augustine tells us of a servant of a certain Astrolo^er, who having robbed his
Master, his Master went about to correct him for it whereupon he cried out that
he could not help it, for that he was borne under Mercury, (and the Astrologers
say that such as are borne under that Planet, are given to stealing) and thus
he silenced his Master by the Rules of his own Art.

Ob. But we see that many times they foretell the truth?

Answ. First, and many more prove false and untrue: and if one thing fall out

Secondly, if such things as they foretell do come to pass, its either from
their Augustine observes, its a just judgment of God upon thee, that thou
should have wherewith to stumble and fall, and undo thy self, as Deuteron.
13.1, etc. Thus a wicked Prophet may foretell that which comes to pass: and
why? God does it to prove and try you?

See Mr. An. Burges on John. p. 396.

Quest. What use may we make of this which has been said?

Answ. First, let all be persuaded to fly the study, and to abandon the
practice of this black Art. The Scripture condemns it as abomination to the
Lord, Reason Perki^s reckons it up amongst the kinds of witchcraft: Saint
Austin counts it ungodly dotage, and inconsistent with Christianity. Does
profit entice you? Its but Balaams gain, the wages of iniquity, money that will
perish with you.

Secondly, if notwithstanding all that can be said, Astrologers will persist
thy Baptismal Vow if thou renouncest not such Diabolical practices. Shall we
countenance what God abominates, and strengthen men in that which makes both
them, and the land liable to wrath? Let them not have the countenance of thy
cost to buy them, nor of thy time to read them, nor of thy tongue to mention
or applaud them, nor of thy affections to fear, hope, or rejoice in any thing
they say. Forbidden, Jer. 10.2, 3. If there were no buyers of such Almanacks,
there would be no Sellers, and if rhere were no Sellers, there would be no
Makers, at least no Publishers of such lying vanities; and truly if the
Astrologer be guilty, the Buyer and Reader cannot be innocent. God has
forbidden seeking to such under a grievous penalty, Lev. 20.6. -- I will even
set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from amongst my people.
Indeed, learned men have observed that such delusions have prevailed amongst
Popish and Anabaptistical spi^its. But that England should countenance such!
and in a time of Reformation! Oh let us blush for shame, etc. How often (said
Tully) did I hear such men promise Pompey and Caesar, that they should live
long, and die a peaceable death, whereas both of them not long after were
murdered. And Cornelias e Lapide the Jesuit, in his Comment on Acts 19.
bewaileth that whilst he was at Rome, they were so much given to this
wickedness, whilst the Astrologers promised to some long life, to others a
Cardinalship, to others the Popedom, and yet at last all were miserably
deluded.

Lillies Almanacks have been vended in a year: If devout men burnt their own
Books of this kind, how should devout Governors see to the burning of such
Books? Sure if those Books deserve the fire which derogate from the honor of
Princes, how much more such as withdraw the minds and hearts of men from God.
It were well, if Astrologers were put into the some Catalogue with other
Sorcerers in the Statute of the first of King James, chap. 20. and to suffer
the same punishment with the other: For the Scripture makes them birds of a
Feather, etc. See as before.

Quest. But may we not use Charms, wherein there are none but good words?

Answ. No; Its the usual craft of Satan to present things, and ways in
themselves indifferent to silly minds, which consider not, that the harm does
not consist in using such words or actions, but in ascribing to them an
unnatural virtue without the warrant of God, who is the Master of nature.

Quest. Is it not lawful to enquire of Astrologers after things to come?

Answ. Certainly, since God has hidden the future time from us, to go about to
lay it open, is a work proper to the professed Undoer of Gods Works.

Quest. Why may we not enquire after future times?

Answ. Curiosity to know the future, carries many so far as to make a Covenant
with the devil, who yet stands not so much upon his points, as to refuse to be
consulted with, by those that have made no covenant with him: No doubt but his
pride is tickled with a mischievous delight, when he sees men seeking to him
for that which is proper to God: and thereby yielding him divine service.

Which service that he may receive in an hidden way from the finer sort of
wits, he has devised some seeming sublime divinations, persuading rhem that
the decree of God about humane events is written in the motions, and several
aspects of the stars, and that therefore this kind of Divination is lawful,
yea, Divine.

Quest. What are the evils that proceed from hence?

Answ. First, they are innumerable: For 1. That silly reverence which vulgar

Secondly, the worst evil is, that thereby man's mind which ought to dwell at
Dragons tail, and the Ascendant of an Horoscope.

Thirdly, it cuts in sunder the very sinews of industry, and makes men idle,
Alexius and Manuel, are lamentable examples how credulous persons are undone by
the Impostures of Astrologers, when they expect from the stars those successes
which should have been wrought out by Piety, Prudence, and Valor.

Quest. What further reason is there against these Astrological Predistions?

Answ. Consider that all affirmation is grounded either upon Reason, or
Authority. The assertions of Judiciary Astrology are of the last kind: For no
reason can be given of their Maxims. Now the authority upon which these
Maxims are grounded, must either be Divine, or Humane, or Devilish. They are
not grounded upon Divine Authority, but are expressly forbidden by it, ^er.
10.2. Isa. 47.13. And humane authority in this case is of no weight: for who
has given power to men to dispose of the several Offices, and Preheminences of
celestial bodies? It remains then that these Maxims are grounded upon
Diabolical authority. In brief, since they are not grounded upon reason, either
they are forged by men, or delivered by revelation: and if that revelation
comes not from God, it must needs come from the devil.

CHAP. XVI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Atheists, and Atheism.
Quest. HHow many sorts of Atheists be there?

Answ. Two. First, when a man says, or at least Psalm. 14.1. 2 King. 6.33. and
7. 2. Mal. 2.17. and 3.14.

Secondly, When a man ownes, and adores a false Ephesians. 2.12.

Quest. How does a man come to the first kind of Atheism?

Answ. First, By two steps or degrees. 1. When he imagins that God does not
Psalm. 10.11. Zeph. 1.12.

Secondly, when he conceits that God is not so severe, and rigorous in
punishing Psalm 50.21, 22. Eccles. 8.11.

Quest. How many ways does a man set up a false instead of a true God?

Answ. First, when a man worships that that is not God in the room of the Act.
19.27, 35.

Secondly, when a man sets some other thing besides the true God to be his etc.
Phil. 3.19. Col. 3.5. Job 31.24.

Quest. How are men made Atheists?

Answ. First, by giving way to sin: For sin draws toward Atheism, by wiping

Secondly, Satan does all that he can to make men Atheists, because when there
is the Devil would have them, Psalm. 14.1, 2. when they say there is no God: it
fol^ows, they are corrupt, they have done abominable works. The Devil indeed
cannot be a ^at Atheist, for he believes and trembles, yet he bears a good will
to Atheism, because he knows that that sin does much advantage his Kingdom. He
knows that it is the master-vein in our original lust, and therefore he tempts
much to it, and indeed would prevail to make us Atheists, but that God has so
wrought in us an impression of a Deity, being the main Pillar of the Law of
Nature* that we cannot possib^y, nor all the Devils in Hell assisting with
their forces, utterly extinguish this Law out of our hearts: Hence we find
that our deepest Atheists in the world, when they are in extremity, and put to
it with some sudden affrightment, do use to cry, O God, O Lord, and therefore
this corruption and temptation is with the more ease opposed, and answered. For
a man has on his side the works of Nature, the Law of Nature, the stirrings
and terrors of his Conscience fearing, and trembling at wrath to come: but
when all is done, that which must, and one^y will hold us up against the
tentation, when we are strongly assaulted by Satan, is to sly to the Word of
God. The Word says that there is a God, and therefore I will believe that
there is a God. But when we are free from tentation, other considerations taken
from the nature, and various acts of Gods providence may stop the mouth of our
lusts which would not have God in all our thoughts: but when we are set upon by
some fierce tentation, the safest way is,

1. Not to enter into disputes with our own reason; for the understanding of
man is too weak to reach the comprehension of a Deity. He that muses much about
the nature, and infinite being of God, shall but let in Satan the more: the
best counsel than for a poor Christian is in any hand not to study this point,
not to dispute this Argument, lest at length he say in his heart, I cannot
conceive what God is, and therefore I doubt whether there be such a being or no.

2. Cleave to the Word, and say: Though my reason cannot tell what to make of
it; though lust in me say that there is no God at all: though Satan say there
is no God, and most men live as if there were no God; yet because I find it in
the Word, and the Scripture says it, I must, and do, and will believe it:
Doubts indeed which have any ground must be disputed and answered: but Atheism
is the denial of the first principle of all Religion, and therefore the best
way is to begin and end with the Word, and to know that such a principle as is
the essence and existence of a God ought not to be so much as questioned: and
therefore put off such thoughts as often as they come, as not fit, or worthy thy
consideration: and thou shall find by often rejecting of them, thy conscience
will be better settled, and confirmed, than by going about by reason to answer
them. Capel on Tentations.

Quest. In whom are these Atheistical thoughts that there is no God?

Answ. These wicked thoughts are not only in some notorious sinners, but in
the corrupt mind of every son of Adam, naturally, Psalm. 10.4. and 14.1. where
David's fool is not some special sinner, but every impenitent sinner, how civil
so ever his life be; though his tongue be ashamed to utter it, yet his corrupt
nature is prone to think it, that there is no God. So Paul insinuates, Romans
3.9, etc.

Object. But it is ingraffed into every man's heart by nature that there is a God?

Answ. These two thoughts, that there is a God, and that there is no God, may
be, and are both in one and the same heart. The same man that by the light of
nature thinks there is a God, may by that corruption and darkness of mind,
that came by Adams fall, think that there is no God: as heat, and cold may be
in the same body in remiss degrees.

Quest. How does a man by thinking deny God in his heart?

Answ. First, by turning the true God into an idol of a man's brain?

Secondly, by placing something that is not God in the room of the true God.

Every man naturally, without further light from Gods Word turns the true God
into an idol: Hence, Gal. 2.8. Ephesians. 2.12. Psalm. 96.5. 1 Cor. 10.20.

Quest. How does a man's mind turn the true God into an idol?

Answ. By three notorious thoughts which are the root of many damnable sins;
as

1. By thinking that God is not every where present, whereby God is robbed of
his omni-presence: For God being infinite, is in all places, and when man's
heart denies this, it turns him into an idol. So Job 22.12, 13. Psalm. 94.7.
Isa. 29.15.

2. By thinking that there is no providence of God, whereby he orders and
disposes of all things particularly. So Psalm. 10.11. Zeph. 1.12.

3. By thinking that there is no justice in God: which is when men imagine that
notwithstanding their sins, yet God will not punish them as he has threatened
in his Word. So Deuteronomy. 29.19, 20. Amos 9.10. and 6.3.

2. A man denies God in his thought by placing in the room of the true God an
Idol of his own brain, which is done by thinking some other thing besides the
true God to be their chiefest good: So Epicures make their belly their God,
Phil 3.19. The covetous man his riches, Col. 3.9. For what a man thinks to be
the best thing in the world for him, that is his God, though it be the devil
himhimself or any other creature. Hence, 2 Cor. 4 4.

Quest. What is the fruit of this thought that there is no God?

Answ. It brings forth the notoriousest sins that can be, even Atheism it self,
which is twofold. 1. In practice. 2. In judgment.

Quest. What is Atheism in practice.

Answ. It Is that sin whereby men deny God in their deeds, lives, and
conversation. This has three special branches.

1. Hypocrisy* which is a sin whereby men worship the true God: but in a false
manner, giving God the outward action but with holding their hearts from him.

2. Epicurisme, which is a sin whereby men contemn God, and give themselves
wholly to their pleasures, spending their time in eating, drinking, and other
carnal delights, not seeking, nor fearing God, which is the sin of many rich
persons.

3. Witchcraft or Magic, which is that sin whereby men renounce the true God:
and betake themselves to the aid, counsel, and help of the devil, either by
himself, or his instruments.

Quest. What is Atheism in judgment?

Answ. It Is that sin whereby in opinion and persuasion of heart men deny God:
It has three degrees.

1. When men hold, and accordingly worship the true God: but yet conceive of,
and worship him otherwise then he has revealed himself in his Word: as the
Turks, Jews, and Papists do.

2, When men place some Idol in the room of the true God, holding the same for
their God: Thus did the Gentiles when they worshipped the Sun, Moon, and
Stars or other creatures.

3. When a man does avouch, hold and maintain that there is no God at all: and
this is the highest degree of Atheism, and such deserve to be put to death for
treason against Heaven, if he shall die that denies his lawful Prince.

Quest. What are the signs whereby Atheism may be discovered?

Answ. David, Psalm. 14. sets down three signs. 1. A disordered life, v. 2, 3.
2. Not calling on the Name of God by prayer, v. 4. 3. Contemning of them that
put their trust in God, v. 6.

Quest. What other signs are there of it?

Cnsw. First, if we deny the omni^presence of God; and are more afraid to sin
in the presence of a mortal man, then in the presence of God.





Quest. What other damnable thought is there naturally in the heart of man
concerning God?

Answ. That the Word of God is foolishness. Thus some thought the Gospel
foolishness. 1 Cor. 1.21. and the reason is rendered, 1 Cor. 2.14. Others have
the like thoughts of the Law, when they judge the threats of the Law untrue,
and so foolishness. Hence, Deuteronomy. 29.19. Isa. 5.19. 2 Pet. 3.3, 4.

Quest. What are the accursed fruits of this Atheism?

Answ. First, hence arises that cursed, and damnable opinion of many that hold
Religion to be but humane Policy to keep men in awe, and so use it as a
politic device to exercise men's brains to keep them from sedition, and
rebellion.

Gal. 1.6.

Quest. What other cursed thought arises from Atheism?

Answ. First, that seeing the Word of God is foolishness, therefore they will
not yield obedience to it. So Job 21 14, 15. Jer. 6.18. Luke 19.14. And very
many are guilty hereof.

Job 21.15. Mal. 3.14. It was in David himself, Psalm. 73.13.

Moses his sin, Numb. 20.12, 6. and David's, Psalm. 31.21. and 116.12. and of the
Israelites, Psalm. 78.19, 20. and of Peter, Mat. 14.30, ^1.

Quest. When do these thoughts of distrust most assault us?

Answ. In times of danger, affliction, tentation, and especially in sickness,
and at death, Job 7.20. and 16.12, etc. so Psalm. 77.7.

Quest. What is the danger of these thoughts?

Answ. First, hence arises all horror, and terrors of conscience: all fears,
and astonishments of heart.

Tenthly, that Baptism is but once to be administered.

Eleventhly, that the force and efficacy of Baptism lasts as long as we

Quest. Can any Argument for the baptizing of Infants, be brought from
Circumcision under the Law?

Answ. Yes: for there is the same extent of the Sacrament of initiation under
the new Covenant, as was under the old. If Infants might partake of the
Sacrament of Initiation and Regeneration, before Christ was exhibited, then
much more since. That which the Apostle says of the Ark in relation to
Baptism, 1 Pet. 3.21. that it was a like figure, may be said of Circumcision:
All their Sacraments were like Figures, not types of ours. The Apostle makes
an express Analogy betwixt Circumcision and Baptism, Col. 2.11, 12. See Dr.
Gouge on Heb.

Quest. Where the Scripture speaks of Baptizing it mentions washing with water,
how then can sprinkling s^rve turn?

Answ. Sprinkling is sufficient to (...) the use of water. The party baptized
is not brought to the Font to have his face, or any other part of his body made
clean, but to have assurance of the inward cleansing of his soul. Now that our
minds may not too much dote on the outward thing done, but be wholly raised up
to the Mystery, the outward element is no further used, then may serve to put
us in mind of the inward thing signified thereby. Answerably in the Lords
Supper there is not so much bread and wine given, and received, (...) would
satisfy ones appetite, or slake his hunger, and quench his thirst, but only a
little bit of bread, and sup of wine to declare the use of bread, and wine, and
so to draw the minds of the Communicants to a consideration of their spiritual
nourishment by the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

Quest. How is Baptism a means of clean^ing and sanctifying?

Answ. Four ways. First, in that it does most lively represent, and set forth
even to the outward senses the inward clean^^n^ of our souls by the blood of
Christ, and sanctifying us by the Spirit of Christ, Romans 6.4, etc.

Luke 3.3. Acts 2.38.

Thirdly, in that it does really exhibit, and seal up to the conscience of him
Abraham received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of
(...), Romans 4.11. The Eunuch and others rejoiced when they were baptized, Acts
8.^9. an^ 16.34.

Gal. 3.17. whosoever are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ; and Acts
22.16. Be thou baptized and wash away thy sins.

Object. But many that are baptized receive no such grace? are neither
cleansed, nor sanctified?

Answ. Such are only outwardly washed with water, not baptized with the holy
Ghost: the fault is not because no grace accompanies the Sacrament, but in that
they receive not, but reject the grace which appertains thereto, Romans 3.3.
What if some believe not? shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none
effect? God forbid.

Object. Many receive the aforesaid graces before they are Baptized. As Abraham
before he was circumcised, Romans 4.11. and some that were baptized after they
believed. How then is baptism a means thereof.

Answ. Their spiritual cleansing is more fully, and lively manifested by
baptism, and they are more assured thereof.

Object. Many who live long in gross sins after baptism, and so were not
thereby cleansed and sanctified, yet many years after have been effectually
called: what means has baptism been hereof?

Answ. The use and efficacy of baptism is not as the act thereof, transient,
but permanent, and perpetual, so long as the baptized person lives: whenever
a sinner unfeignedly repents, and faithfully lays hold on the promises of
God: Baptism, which is the seal thereof, is as powerful and effectual as it
could have been when it was first administered. For the efficacy of Baptism
consists in the free offer of grace. So long therefore as God continues to
offer grace, so long may a man's baptism be effectual. On this ground we are
but once baptized; and as the Prophet put the people in mind of their
circumcision, Jerem. 4.4. So the Apostles of their Baptism long after it was
administered. Yea, they speak of it (though the act were long before past) as if
it were in doing in the time present. Baptism saves, 1 Pet. 3.21.

Quest. What kind of means of grace is baptism?

Answ. Baptism is no Physical, or natural means of working grace, as if the
grace that is sealed up thereby were inherent in the water, or in the Ministers
act of sprinkling it (as in medicines, salves, meats, etc. there is an inherent
virtue which proceeds from the use of them; and being applied they have their
operation whether a man believe it or no.) But it is only a voluntary
instrument, which Christ uses as it pleases him, to work what grace, or what
measure of grace seems best to him: so as grace is only assistant to it, not
included in it: Yet in the right use thereof, Christ by his Spirit works that
grace which is received by it, in which respect the Minister is said to baptize
with water, but Christ with the holy Ghost and with fire, Mat. 3.11.

Quest. Whether is baptism necessary to salvation?

Answ. A means of working a thing may be said to be necessary two ways.

1. Absolutely, so as the thing cannot possibly be without it. Thus are the
proper causes of a thing absolutely necessary: as in this case Gods Covenant:
Christ's blood, and the operation of the Spirit are absolutely necessary for the
obtaining any grace.

Secondly, by consequence, so as according to that course and order which

Baptism is not absolutely necessary as a cause: For then it should be equal
to Gods Covenant, Christ's blood, and the work of the Spirit; Yea, then all that
are baptized should be cleansed. But its necessary by consequence, and that in
a double respect.

1. In regard of Gods Ordinance. 2. In regard of our need thereof.

1. God having ordained this Sacrament to be used, its necessary it should be
used, if for no other end, yet to manifest our obedience. He that carelessly
neglects, or wilfully contemns any Sacrament enjoined by God, his soul shall be
cut off, Genesis 17.14.

2. Great is the need that we have thereof in regard of our dullness in
conceiving things spiritual, and of our weakness in believing things
invisible. We are carnal and earthly, and by things sensible and earthly, do
the better conceive of things spiritual and heavenly: Therefore God has
ordained visible elements to be Sacraments of invisible graces. Again we are
slow to believe such things as are promised in the Word, therefore the more to
help and strengthen our faith, God has added to his Covenant in the Word, his
seal in, and by the Sacraments: That by two immutable things (Gods Covenant,
and Gods seal) in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong
consolation. Besides, though in general we do believe the truth of Gods Word,
yet we are doubtful to apply it to our selves; wherefore for the better
applying of Gods Covenant to our own soul, God has added his Sacraments to his
Word.

Quest. Wherein do the Papists err about this Doctrine of Baptism?

Answ. First, in the necessity of it* they making it so absolutely necessary,
Infants, though they be deprived thereof without any fault of their own, or of
their parents, when they be still born: which is a merciless opinion against
Gods Word, and against the order which he has prescribed. For he has
established his Covenant, and promised to be the God of the faithful, and of
their seed. Hence, Acts 2.39. the promise is to you, and to your children; and
1 Cor. 7.14. Your children are holy. If these promises should be made void by
an inevitable want of baptism, why would God have enjoined circumcision (which
to the Jews was as baptism is to Christians) to put it off to the eighth day,
before which time many of their infants died? Or would Moses have suffered it
to be fo^born all the time that the Israelites were in the Wilderness? If they
say that baptism is more necessary then circumcision, I answer, that the
Scripture lays no more necessity upon it: and if it were so necessary as they
make it, then the virtue of Christ's death were less effectual since he was
actually exhibited then before. For before it was effectual for Infants without
a Sacrament, but belike not now.

ex opere operato, or the wo^k it self: wherein they make it equal with the
very blood of Christ, and take away the peculiar work of the Spirit, and the
use of faith repentance, and such like graces. Can there be more in the water
then there was in the blood of beasts offered in Sacrifices? But it is not
possible that their blood should take away sin, Heb. 10.4. they themselves
attribute no such virtue to the Word preached, and yet they cannot show where
the holy Ghost has given more virtue to the Sacrament then to the word. The
Apostle, 1 Cor. 1.21. joins them both together; that he might cleanse it with
the washing of water through the Word. What can be more said of it then of the
Word, Romans 1.16. It pleased God by preaching to save them that believe. The
Gospel is the power of God to salvation.

Quest. Wherein do the Anabaptists err about this Doctrine of Baptism?

Answ. They too lightly esteem this holy and necessary Ordinance of God in that
they make it only a badge of our profession: a note of difference between the
true and false Church, a sign of mutual fellowship: a bare sign of spiritual
grace: a resemblance of mortification, regeneration, inscition into Christ,
etc. but no more: These indeed are some of the ends, and uses of Baptism: But
in that they restrain all the efficacy thereof hereunto, they take away the
greatest comfort, and truest benefit which the Church reapeth thereby as is
above said.

Quest. What is the inward washing by Baptism?

Answ. In that whosoever is fully baptized is cleansed from sin. Fully, i. e.
powerfully and effectually, as well inwardly by the spirit, as outwardly by the
Minister: Cleansed, i. e. both from the guilt of sin by Christ's blood, and from
the power of sin by the work of his Spirit: Hence, Romans 6.3, 4. As many as
are baptized into Christ, are baptized into his death: Buried with him by
baptism: Baptism saves us, 1 Pet. 3.21.

Quest. Is it necessary that the Word and Baptism go together?

Answ. It Is very requisite that where this Sacrament is administered, the
Doctrine thereof be truly and plainly taught, so as the nature, efficacy, and
use thereof may be made known, and the Covenant of God sealed up thereby, may
be believed. Hence, Matthew. 28.19. Teaching and baptizing are joined together.
So did John, Luke 3.3. and the Apostles, Acts 2.38. and 8.12, 37. and 16.15, 33.

For, 1. A Sacrament without the Word is but an idle Ceremony. Like a seal
without a Covenant: It Is the Word that makes known the Covenant of God.

2. It Is the Word which makes the greatest difference between the Sacramental
washing of water, and ordinary common washing.

3. By the Word the ordinary creatures we use are sanctified, much more the
holy Ordinances of Gods worship, whereof Baptism is one.

Quest. Is it not lawful to Baptize without a Sermon?

Answ. Though it be both commendable, and honorable to administer that
Sacrament when there is a Sermon, yet I judge it not unlawful to do it
without a Sermon: Only the people must be taught by the Word what the Covenant
is that Baptism seals up, which being done, the word is not separated from
that Sacrament though at that time there be no Sermon. See Dr. Gouge in
Domestic Duties.

Quest. How many parts be there of a Sacrament, and so consequently of Baptism?

Answ. There be three essentialls parts of a Sacrament. 1. The Si^ne. 2. The
thing signified. 3. The Analogy between them, which is the union of them both.
The first, is some outward, and visible thing: the second, inward and
Spiritual: the third, mixed of them both: As in Baptism, the sign is water,
the thing signified is the blood of Christ: the Analogy or union stands in
this resemblance, that as the former outwardly washes the filthiness of the
body, so the latter inwardly purges the soul of all sin. By reason of which
relation, and near affection between the sign, and thing signified, it is
usual by an improper, but Sacramental speech.

1. To call the sign by the thing signified, and contrarily. So Baptism is
called the washing of the new birth* because it is a sign, seal, and instrument
of it.

2. To ascribe that to the sign which is proper to the thing signified, and so
Baptism is said to save us, Tit. 3.5. 1 Pet. 3.21. which indeed is the
propriety of Christ's blood, 1 John 1.7. But by the near affinity of these two
in the Sacrament it is said so to do.

1. To teach us not to conceive the Sacramental elements as bare, and naked
signs, so as to grow into the contempt of them.

2. As we may not conceive them idle signs, so neither Idol signs by
insisting in them as though they were the whole Sacrament: For they are but
outward, whereas the principal matter of a Sacrament is spiritual, and inward.

3. That then we truliest conceive of a Sacrament, when by looking at one of
these we see both: by the sign, and action which is outward to be led to those
which are spiritual, and inward.

Quest. What benefit have we by Baptism?

Answ. God in Baptism does not only offer, and signify, but truly exhibiteth
grace, whereby our sins are washed, and we are renewed by the holy Ghost, Acts
2.38.

Quest. Are all baptized persons then regenerated?

Answ. No: For, First, this effect is not ascribed to the work wrought, as the

Secondly, neither by any extraordinary elevation of the action, whereby it
Tit. 3.5. wherein the work of renewing is ascribed to the Holy Ghost.

Thirdly, neither has the water in Baptism it self any inherent power,

Fourthly, neither is grace tied by any promise, or means to the action, so as
God (who is most free in his gifts) cannot either otherwise distribute, or
cannot but dispense it with the action: For,

1. Grace is not tied to the Word; therefore not to the Sacraments.

2. They were separated in the Ministry of John the Baptist, who confessed that
though he baptized with water, yet it belonged to him that came after him to
give grace.

3. If these opinions were true, then should every baptized person be truly
converted, whereas we see the contrary in Simon Magus, and many others.

4. Some are justified before Baptism, as Abraham before Circumcision. So
Cornelius, Acts 10.47. the Eunuch, Acts 8.37, 38. some after, as numbers daily
converted.

5. This opinion of tying grace to the Sacrament overthrows 1. The highest, and
most proper cause of our salvation, which is Gods free Election, to which only
grace is tied. 2. The only meritorious cause of our Regeneration, which is
Christ's blood that properly cleanses from all sin. 3. The most powerful,
next, and applying efficient, which is the Holy Ghost, and to whom our renewing
is ascribed.


Quest. How then is Baptism called the laver of regeneration?

Answ. First, as it is an institution of God signifying his good pleasure for
the pardoning of sin, and accepting to grace in Christ. Thus the Word and
Sacraments are said to save, and sanctify, because they signify the good
pleasure of God in saving, and sanctifying us. Thus we say a man is saved by
the Kings pardon, not that the pardon properly does it, but because it is the
ordinary instrument to manifest the merciful mind of the King in pardoning a
malefactor.







Quest, To whom is Baptism the washing of the new Birth?

Answ. We must not conceive it to be a Laver of regeneration to every person
baptized: but to such as have the grace of faith to receive the grace offered,
John 1.12. Ephesians. 5.27. For ungodly and unbelieving persons receive nothing in
the Sacraments but the the elements, and that as naked signs: as we see in
Judas, Simon Magus, Ananias and Saphira. In all whom neither was grace
conferred, nor wickedness weakened.

Quest. How then can children be baptized, in whom we cannot expect faith, and
therefore in them, either faith is not required, or their baptism is
unprofitable?

Answ. I will lay down some propositions for the unfolding of this difficulty.
As

1. We must distinguish of Infants, whereof some are Elect, and some not. These
latter receive only the element, but are not inwardly washed: the former in
the right use of the Sacrament receive the inward grace: Not that thereby we
tie God to any time, or means, whose Spirit blows when, and where it lists;
as some are sanctified from the womb, and some after baptism; but because God
delights to present himself gracious in his own* Ordinance, therefore in the
right use of the Sacrament he ordinarily accompanies it with his grace: Here,
according to his promise we may expect it, and here we may, and ought to send
forth the prayer of Faith for it.

2. Though Infants want actual faith which presupposes hearing, understanding,
etc. yet they want not all faith: for Christ himself reckons them amongst
believers, Matthew. 18.6. Hence circumcision which was administered to Infants, is
called a seal of Faith.

3. The faith of their parents is so far theirs, as that it gives them right
to the Covenant: For the Covenant was made to Abraham and his seed: and every
believing parent lays hold on the Covenant for himself, and his seed, thereby
entitling his children to the right of the Covenant as well as himself; as in
temporal things he can purchase land for himself and his heirs, 1 Cor. 7.14. If
the root be holy, so are the branches: and one parent believing, the children
are holy.

Object. But the just shall live by his own faith?

An. Elect Infants have a spirit of Faith by the Spirit of God working
inwardly, and secretly, as we see in those which were sanctified from the womb,
as Jacob, Jeremy, John Baptist, etc. neither does it hinder, because Infants
have no sense of any such thing, no more then it proves them nor ^o live,
because they know not that they do so. Neither is Adams corruption more
effectual to pollute infants, then Christ's blood and righteousness is to
sanctify them, and this we ought to believe, or else we must deny that they
can be saved.

Quest. If any believe before baptism, what profit then have they by Baptism?

Answ. First, they must be Baptized in obedience to the command of God;
Abraham, Cornelius, Paul, etc. believing, obeyed without reasoning, and so
manifested their faith by their obedience.

Secondly, such as are invisibly incorporated into Christ's body, must also be

Thirdly, that the grace received may be augmented. For by the

Fourthly, that the party baptized may be confirmed and strengthened, not
Taitor on Tit.

Quest. How may Parents in Faith present their children to God in Baptism?

Answ. The dedication of a child to God is a work of singular and great
importance, one of the weightiest services we can take in hand, though
considered of by few: and it cannot be well done as it ought except it be done
in faith: Now the acts of faith in this, are

1. It calls to remembrance the free and gracious Covenant which God has
made with believing Parents and their Posterity, expressed, Genesis 17.7, 9. Acts
2.39. which Covenant as its made to the believing Parent, and his seed, so does
the faith of the parent apprehend the promise of the Covenant for himself and
his seed. And this is the ground of that tender which a Christian makes of his
children to holy Baptism: For by natural generation children of believing
Parents are defiled with sin, and so under wrath: but they are holy by covenant
and free acceptance, the believing Parent embracing Gods Promise for himself
and his posterity.



Sam. 7.27.







Quest. What use should Christians make of their Baptism, when they come to
years of discretion?

Answ. They should remember that Baptism is a seal of the Covenant betwixt
God and them, of Gods Promise, that he will be their God, and of their Promise,
that they will be his people, repent of sin, believe in Christ, and walk before
him in sincere obedience: and that the signification, force, use, and fruit of
it continues not for that present only when its administered, but for the whole
course of a man's life: for as its the seal of a free, everlasting, and
unchangable Covenant, so is the force and use of it perpetual: so then the use
to be made of Baptism is twofold.



1. In that its a seal of our Regeneration by the Holy Ghost, whereby a divine
quality is infused into us in the room, and place of original corruption: Hence
its called the Laver of Regeneration, Tit. 3.5. It being usual to call the
principal cause, and the instrument by the same name.

2. It seals and confirms to us the free pardon of our sins, Acts 2.38. and
22.16.

3. Its a pledge of the virtue of Christ's death, and of our fellowship therein,
Romans 6.3.

4. Its a pledge of the virtue of Christ's life, and of our communion with him
therein, Romans 6.5. Col. 2.12.

5. Its a pledge of our adoption in Jesus Christ. For when God puts his Name
upon us, he signifies and assures that we are his sons, Gal. 3.26, 27.

6. Its a solemn testimony of our communion with all the lively members of
Christ Jesus. Its a seal of the bond, and mutual love, and fellowship, both of
Christ with his members, and of his members one with another, 1 Cor. 12.13.

7. Its a seal and pledge to assure us, that God will provide for us in this
life, raise up our bodies to life at the last day, and bestow upon us that
everlasting Kingdom and Inheritance which he has prepared for us, Mar. 16.16.
Tit. 3.5, 6, 7. 1 Pet. 3.21.

Secondly, its a seal of our duty promised, and so a spur, and provocation

1. Its a spur to repentance and mortification: For Baptism seals remission
of sins to them only that repent, and as we expect the blessing, we must see
that we perform the condition.

2. Its a provocation to faith, and a pledge thereof. We have Gods Promise
under his hand and seal, that he will wash us from our iniquities, receive us
for his children, remember our necessities, and bestow upon us his Kingdom. Now
we much dishonor him, if we question his performance of that which he has so
freely promised and confirmed by Covenant and Seal.

3. Its an incitement to new obedience, and a pledge thereof, Romans 6.4. we have
solemnly sworn to fight against the devil, the world, and the flesh: and having
taken presse-money of Jesus Christ, it were a foul fault to accept of a truce
with Satan.

4. Its a pledge or pawn of love and unity. We must keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of Peace, for we are all baptized into one body. We must not
jarre, for we are brethren. Its unnatural that the members of this mystical
body should be divided. See Ball on faith, p. 419.

Quest. By what Arguments may the lawfulness of Infant Baptism be proved?

Answ. First, the Infants of believing Parents are under the Covenant of

1. That the Covenant of grace has always been for the substance one and the
same.

2. That God will have the Infants of such as enter into Covenant with him, be
counted his as well as their Parents.

3. God has ever since Abraham's time, had a seal to be applied to such as
enter into Covenant with him.

4. By Gods own order the seed, or Infants of Covenanters before Christ's time,
were to be sealed with the seal of admission into his Covenant, as well as
their Parents.

5. The privileges of such as are in Covenant since Chtists time, are as
honorable, large and comfortable both to themselves and their children, as
they were before Christ's time.

That the Covenant was the same for substance both to Jews and Gentiles* is
proved, First, by the Prophecies, where the same things are promised to the
Gentiles, when the Gospel should be preached to them, as were first promised to
Abraham and his seed. So Jer. 31.33. Isa. 59.21. Joel 2.32. But more fully in
the New Testament, Luke 1.54, 55, 69, 70, 72, 73. Luke 2.31, 32* Mat. 21.4^,
43. Gal. 3.8, 14, 16. Ephesians. 2.13. to the end of the chap. So Gal. 3.16* we find
three sorts of Abraham's seed. 1. Christ, the root of the rest. 2. All true
believers, chap. 3.19. these partake of the spiritual part of the Covenant. 3.
Such as were only circumcised in the flesh, but not in the heart, Romans 10.3. of
whom Ishmael and Esau were types, Gal. 4.22, etc. Such as are only holy by an
external Profession, Gal. 4.29. That God will have the Infants of such as enter
into Covenant with him to be counted his, is proved.

Thus it was in the time of the Jews, Genesis 17.9, etc. and so it is still, Acts
2.38, 39. Luke 19.9. Romans 11.10, etc. 1 Cor. 7.14.

That the seal of initiation is to be administered unto them who enter into
Covenant with God is clear. Circumcision was to the Jews Infants, and
therefore Baptism is, both of them being the same Sacrament for the spiritual
part of them. None might be received into the Communion of the Church of the
Jews till circumcised, nor of the Christians till baptized, that Baptism
succeeds in the room of Circumcision is clear, Col. 2.11, 12.

That Infants amongst the Jews were to be initiated, and sealed with the sign
of Circumcision, which though actually applied to the males, yet the females
were virtually circumcised in them. Hence the whole Church of the Jews are
called the Circumcision. And Exodus 12.48. no uncircumcised person might eat of
the Passover, whereof women did eat as well as men.

Ob. But Circumcision was not a seal of the spiritual part of the Covenant of
grace, but of some temporal and earthly blessings, as of their right to Canaan,
etc.

Answ. That Circumcision was a sign of the Covenant of grace is plain, Romans
4.11. Abraham received Circumcision for a sign of the righteousness of faith,
etc.

That the Privileges of believers under the Gospel is more large, honorable
and comfortable, appears, Heb. 8.6. 2 Cor. 3.10. Gal. 4.1, etc.

Now 1. How uncomfortable a thing is it to Parents, to take away the very
ground of their hope for the salvation of their Infants. For we have no ground
of hope for any particular person, till he be brought under the Covenant of
grace.

2. How unwilling also must Christian Parents be to part with their childrens
right, to the seal of the Covenant, this their right to the Covenant being all
ground of hope that believing Parents have that their Infants that die in their
Infancy, are saved, rather then the Infants of Turks or Pagans.

Ob. But there is neither Precept, President, nor express Institution in all
the New Testament for the Baptism of Infants?

Answ. I deny the consequence, that if in so many words it be not commanded, it
is not to be done: There is no express reviving of the Laws in the New
Testament, concerning the forbidden degrees of marriage: nor against Polygamie:
or for the celebration of a weekly Sabbath: nor for women's receiving the Lords
Supper. No express command for believers children when grown up, to be
baptized, nor example of it, though there was for the instructing and baptizing
Jews and Heathens: But we have virtually, and by undeniable consequence
sufficient evidence for the Baptism of children, both commands and examples.
As Gods command to Abraham, as he was the father of all Covenanters, that he
should seal his children with the seal of the Covenant.

Again, Mar. 16.15. Christ commands his disciples to teach all things what he
had commanded them, i. e. the whole Gospel containing all the Promises, whereof
this is one, I will be the God of believers, and of their seed: that the seed
of believers are taken into Covenant with their Parents. And Mat. 28. Teach all
Nations, baptizing them, etc. Now as they were to teach the aforesaid Promises,
so they were to baptize them: the persons to whom they were to do this, were
all Nations, whereas before the Church was tied to the Jews only; Now we know
that when the Nation of the Jews were made Disciples, and circumcised, their
Infants were made Disciples and circumcised. And Gods manner is, when Promises
or Threatenings are denounced against Nations, to include Infants, which are a
great part of every Nation; except they be particularly excepted, as they were,
Numb. 14.31.

Ob. But Infants are not capable of being disciples?

Answ. First, they are as capable as the Infants of Jews and Proselytes were,

Secondly, they are devoted to be disciples.

Thirdly, they are capable of Gods teaching, though not of man's.

Fourthly, they belong to Christ, and bear the Name of Christ, May. 10.42.
Mar. 9.41. Mat. 18.5. and therefore are his disciples, as appears by those
texts if compared together.

Fifthly, they are called disciples, Act. 15.1. and 10. compared.

Another command by good consequence for the baptizing of Infants is from Acts
2.38, 39. because the Promise was made to them and their children, which proves
that they were taken into Covenant with their Parents, and therefore were to
receive the seal of the Covenant.

For examples, though there were none, yet there is no Argument in it; yet we
have examples by good consequence: For the Gospel took place, just as the old
administration* by bringing in whole families together. When Abraham was taken
in, his whole family was taken in together with him: So of the Proselytes.
Likewise in the New Testament, usually if the Master of the Family turned
Christian, his whole Family came in, and were baptized with him. So we see,
Acts 11.14. So the household of Stephanus, of Aristobulus, of Narcissus, of
Lidea, of the Jailor, etc.

2. Argum. To whom the inward grace of Baptism does belong, to them belongs
Acts 10.47. Can any man forbid water, etc. Act. 11.17. The Minor is proved,
Mark 10.14. to such belongs the Kingdom of God. And 1 Cor. 7.14. they are holy.

Besides, there is nothing belonging to the Initiation and being of a
Christian, where of Baptism is a seal, which Infants are not as capable of as
grown men. For they are capable of receiving the Holy Ghost, of union with
Christ, of Adoption, of forgiveness of sins, of Regeneration, of everlasting
life, all which are signified and sealed by Baptism. For in receiving the
inward grace, of which Baptism is the sign and seal, we are mere passives,
whereof Infants are as fit subjects as grown men, or else none of them could
be saved.

Ob. Though they are capable of grace, and may be saved, yet we may not baptize
them, because by preaching they are to be made disciples, before they may be
baptized, Mat. 28.19.

Answ. This is not the first Institution of Baptism, but the enlargement of
their Commission: before they were sent only to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel: But now to all Nations, who were to be converted to Christ; but before
were out of the Covenant of grace, and therefore their children had no right to
Baptism: But when once themselves were instructed and baptized, then their
children were capable of it by virtue of the Covenant.

Ob. But its said, He that believes and is baptized shall be saved: therefore
Faith must precede Baptism?

Answ. First, if this Argument has any strength against the Baptism of
Infants,

Secondly, its no where said, unbelievers, or rather non-believers, may not be
baptized: Its said indeed, He that believes, and is baptized, shall be saved:
But its no where said, He that believes not may not be baptized: Christ
excludes Infants, neither from Baptism, nor from Salvation, for want of faith,
but positive unbelievers, such as refuse the Gospel, he excludes from both.

Ob. But supposing them to be capable of the inward grace of Baptism; yet this
is no warrant for our Baptizing of all Infants, because we know not upon whom
God does this work?

Answ. Our knowledge that God has effectually wrought the thing signified, is
not the condition upon which we are to apply the sign: God no where requires
that we should know that men are converted before we baptize them. The Apostles
themselves knew it not, as we see in Simon Magus, Alexander, Hymenaeus,
Ananias, and Saphira: but he requires that we should know that they have in
them that condition which must warrant us to administer the sign: Fallible
conjecture must not be our rule in administering the Sacraments either to
Infants, or grown men: but a known rule of the Word: the Apostles baptized
grown men, not because they judged them inwardly sanctified, but because they
made a profession of faith and holiness, and such Christ would have to be
received into the communion of the Church: though it may be they were never
received into communion with himself: And in this the rule to direct our
knowledge, which is but the judgment of charity, is as plain for Infants as
for grown men.

Object. But all that enter into Covenant, and receive the seal of it must
stipulate for their parts, as well as God does for his, which Infants cannot do?

Answ. First, the Infants of the Jews were as much tied to this as the Infants
of Christians are: Every one that was circumcised was bound to keep the Law,
Gal. 5.5.



Object. But if the sealing be but conditional on Gods part, that they own and
ratify it when they come to ripe age, were it not better to defer it till
then, to see whether they will then make it their voluntary act, yea, or no?

Answ. First, This objection lay as strongly against Gods wisdom in requiring
the Jews Infants to be circumcised, and therefore argues no great wisdom, and
modesty in those who thus reason with God against his administrations.

children are through their imperfection, being as much above them, as children
are below them.

Thirdly, yet the fruit and benefit of it at the present is very much both to
Parents,

1. To the parents whilst God does hereby honor them to have their children
counted to his Church, to his Kingdom, and family, and so under his wing, and
grace whilst all other Infants in the world have their visible standing in the
Kingdom of Satan: and so whilst others have no hope of their childrens
spiritual welfare, till they are called out of that condition, these need not
doubt of their childrens welfare if they die in their infancy, or if they live,
till they show signs to the contrary: God having reckoned them to his people,
and given them all the means of salvation, which their infant age is capable of*

2. To the children, when as (besides what inward secret work God is pleased to
work in them) they being members of the Church of Christ have their share in
the communion of Saints, are remembered at the throne of grace every day by all
that pray for the welfare of the Church: and particularly in those prayers
which are made for a blessing on his Ordinances: and lastly, it is no small
privilege to have that seal bestowed upon them in their infancy, which they
may afterward plead when they come to fulfill the condition.

Object. But if their being capable of a spiritual part, entitles them to the
outward sign, why are they not admitted to the Lords Supper, which is a seal
of the Covenant of Grace as well as this? For (say they) the Jews Infants did
eat the Passover: then if our Infants have as large privileges as theirs had,
then they must partake of the Lords Supper?

Answ. We are sure that Infants are capable of the grace of Baptism, but we
are not sure that they are capable of the grace signed, and sealed in the Lords
Supper: For though both are seals of the Covenant of grace, yet it is with some
difference: Baptism properly seals our entrance into it: the Lords Supper
properly our growth, nourishment, and augmentation in it: Baptism for our
birth, the Lords Supper for our food: Now Infants may be born again whilst
they are Infants, have their original sin pardoned, be united to Christ, have
his image stamped upon them; but concerning the exercises of these graces, and
the augmentation of them in Infants, the Scripture is silent. Neither is there
any mention in Scripture that the Jews Infants did eat the Passover: Indeed
when at the Passover their Children asked them the meaning of that service,
they were to instruct them therein: but there is neither precept, nor president
for their eating of it. See Mr. Marshalls Sermon about Infant Baptism.

Object. None are rightly Baptized, but those that are dipped?

Answ. Though dipping may be used where the Child is strong, and the weather,
and Climate are temperate, yet it is not necessary, or essential to Baptism,
as is proved by these Arguments.

That which Christ the Author of Baptism requires not, that cannot be
necessary to this Sacrament. But Christ requires not dipping: therefore:
Hesychius, Stevens, Scapula, and Budaeus prove by many instances that (...)
signifies washing, which may be done without dipping.

2. The words baptize, and Baptism are often used in Scripture: where the
persons or things said to be baptized were not dipped, as Mat. 3.11. shall
Baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: they were not dipped in that fire
which came down from heaven upon them, Acts 2.3. Mat. 20.23. yea shall be
baptized with the Baptism that I am baptized with; yet neither Christ, nor his
Disciples that we read of, were dipped in blood, Mark 7.48. Baptism of Cups,
Pots, Tables, or Beds: Cups, and pots may be washed, by pouring water in them
without dipping: and Tables and Beds were not dipped, 1 Cor. 10.2. Baptized in
the cloud, which only rained upon them, etc.

3. If the spiritual grace signified by Baptism is sufficiently expressed
without dipping, then dipping is not necessary: But it is: Therefore: The thing
signified is the cleansing of the soul from the guilt, and filth of sin,
which is sufficiently expressed by washing with water without dipping, 1 Pet.
3.21.

4. The outward act of Baptism signifying the inward cleansing of the soul is
expressed in Scripture by sprinkling; as Heb. 9.13. The blood of Bulls and
Goats sprinkling the unclean, etc. Heb. 10.22. Having our hearts sprinkled from
an evil conscience, 1 Pet. 1.2. through sanctification of the Spirit, and
sprinkling of the blood of Christ; Therefore dipping is not necessary.

5. It may sometimes be necessary to baptize sick, and weak persons; but such
cannot be dipped without apparent hazard to their lives: Therefore its not
necessary.

6. The Sacraments of the Church may, and ought to be administered without
giving any just scandal: But the meeting of many persons, men and women, and
going naked into a river together, cannot be done without scandal, therefore
its not necessary.

Object. But the word baptize is derived from (...), to dip, or die: therefore
washing, or sprinkling is not baptizing?

Answ. First, we are not so much to respect whence words are derived, as how
Luke 1.4. Acts 18.25. and 21.24. Romans 14.19. Gal. 6.6. so though Baptism comes
from (...), that signifies properly washing, or dipping: yet its taken more
largely, as was showed before in several Scriptures:) for any kind of washing
or cleansing where there is no dipping.



Object. But Christ, and John, and Philip, and the Eunuch are said to go down
into the water, therefore washing and sprinkling are not sufficient, without
dipping?

Answ. First, an example of Christ, and his Apostles without a precept bind
not in all things: For Christ washed his Disciples feet before his Supper, and
he administered it at night, and only to twelve men, etc. yet are not we bound
hereunto: Likewise the first Christians sold their possessions, etc. which we
are not obliged to imitate, Acts 2.44.



Act. 2. that were converted, and presently baptized upon the place: and the
Jailer and his family who were baptized at midnight in the place where they
were, were dipped, but rather washed, or sprinkled. See Dr. Featlies Dippers
Dipped.

Quest. How is Baptism necessary?

Answ. This was showed before in part, to which I now add that it is necessary.

1. As the lawful use thereof is a note whereby the true Church of God is
distinguished Jews wanted Circumcision for forty years in the Wilderness,
Jos. 5.6.

2. As it serves for necessary uses to men of years that are baptized:

1. To testify to the Church and themselves that they are received into the
body of Christ, which is the company of the faithful.

2. To testify their obedience to Gods command, and their subjection to his
Ordinance, which is appointed for their good.

3. To be a necessary prop to uphold their weakness, a seal to confirm their
faith in the Covenant of Grace, and an instrument to convey Christ to them with
all his benefits.

3. It Is necessary to Infants, as it serves to admit them into the visible
Church,

Quest. Are all then that die without it in the state of damnation?

Answ. No: For. First, Baptism is appointed by God to be no more then a

Secondly, the bare want of Baptism where it cannot be had, is pardonable.
Genesis 17.14. that soul shall be cut off.

Thirdly, the grace and mercy of God is free, and not tied to the outward Joh.
3.8. the wind blows where it lists, i. e. God gives grace when, where, and
to whom he pleases.

Fourthly, Infants borne of believing parents are holy before Baptism, and
Cor. 7.14. yea, to them belongs the Kingdom of heaven, Mark 10.14.

Object. They which are sanctified have faith, which Infants have not?

Answ. God says, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed: By virtue of
which promise the Parent lays hold of the Covenant for himself and his
children: and the children believes because the Father believes.

Object. Infants are borne in Original sin, and therefore cannot be holy?

Answ. Every believing Parent sustains a double person. 1. As descending from
Adam by corrupted seed, and thus both himself and his children are corrupted.
2. As he is a holy, and believing man ingraffed by faith into Christ, the
second Adam; and thus by his faith, his children comes to be within the
Covenant, and partaker of the benefits and privileges thereof* and by the same
faith, he being a believer, the guilt of original corruption in the Infant is
not imputed to him to condemnation.

Object. Others that would make it absolutely necessary object, John 3.5.
Except a man be born of water, and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven?

Answ. First, If this be meant of Baptism, then the word may carry one of these
two senses.

1. Christ directs his speech principally to Nicodemus, who was a timorous
professor, who remained ignorant, and had long neglected his Baptism. 2. That
the Kingdom of heaven is not here put for everlasting happiness, but to
signify the visible state of the Church under the New Testament, and then the
meaning is, that none can be admitted into the Church, and made a visible
member thereof but by Baptism: nor can any be made a lively member of Christ,
but by the Spirit.
Exodus 35.26. which speaks of clean water, and then the meaning is, thou
Nicodemus art a Pharisee, and usest many outward washings: but unless thou
be washed inwardly by clean water, i. e. regenerated by the Holy Ghost, thou
can not enter into heaven.



Quest. Whether are not witnesses, commonly called Godfathers, and Godmothers
necessary?

Answ. No. First, For in the Primitive times the Parents of children which were
Heathens and newly converted to the Christian Religion, were either ignorant
and could not, or careless and would not bring up their children according to
the Word of God, and true Religion which they newly professed: therefore
persons of good knowledge and life were called to witness Baptism, and
promised to take care of the childrens education: But now parents being better
taught and qualified, the other is not necessary.







Quest. Whether have children of excommunicated persons right to Baptism?

Answ. Before this question be answered some grounds must be laid down; As,

1. There are two texts principally about excommunication, Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor.
5.5. the scope of both which is to show that the excommunicated person is
debarred the Kingdom of heaven. For he is not to be held a true member of the
Church, but as an Heathen and Publican.

2. In excommunication there are three judgments to be considered. 1. Of God.
2. Of the Church. 3. Again of God. The first is when God holds any obstinate
sinner guilty of the offense, and consequently of condemnation except he
repent. The second is of the Church, which follows Gods judgment, pronouncing
the party guilty, and subject to condemnation: which judgment is not to be
given absolutely, but with condition of repentance, and so far forth as man
can judge by the fault committed, as also by the Word which directs how to
discern of the impenitency of the sinner. The third again is Gods judgment,
whereby he confirms that in heaven which the Church has done on earth. So then
the answer may be,

1. That the persons excommunicate are in some respect no members of Christ's
body, and in some other respects they are.

Quest. How are they not?

Answ. First, in that they are cut off from the company of Believers by the

Secondly, because by their sin they have (as much as in them lies)

Quest. How are they members?

Answ. First, some are members, not actually, and in present, but in the
eternal Gal. 1.15. Paul says, God had separated him from the womb, and called
him by his grace. So Romans 5.20. when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by Christ.

Secondly, some are members only in show, and appearance; as hypocrites.

Thirdly, some are lively members which are united to Christ by faith, etc.
8.14.

Fourthly, some are decayed members, who though they belong to Gods Election,
John 10.28. Yet they are not holden so to be in three respects.

1. In regard of men, because they are excluded from communion with the
faithful by the censure of the Church. 2. In regard of God, because what the
Church rightly binds on earth, he binds in heaven. 3. In regard of themselves,
because for a time they want the power and efficacy of the Spirit, till by true
repentance they recover life again. Now though in these respects they be not
esteemed members, yet in truth they are not wholly cut off from the society of
the faithful: For the seed of faith remains in them that knits them to Christ,
though the sense thereof be lost, until they repent: Hence the answer to the
question is,
That the children of such persons as are excommunicated, are to be baptized;
because they are indeed, and in the judgment of charity true members of the
body of Christ, though in some regards they are not for the present esteemed so
to be.

Quest. What reasons may be rendered for this?

Answ. Children of Parents that are professed members of the Church

Seconly, the personal sin of the Parent may not keep the blessing from the
child; and therefore it may not deprive him from partaking of the Ordinance

Thirdly, difference must be made between them which do not make

Fourthly, we must put a difference between those that have given up Turks, and
Infidels that are out of thr Covenant, and never belonged to the Church.



Quest. Whether have children, borne in fornication, right to Baptism?

Answ. They ought not to denied it. For the wickedness of the Parent ought not
prejudice the child in things that belong to his salvation.

Quest. Are there no cautions to be obs^rved?

Answ. Yea: First, that the Parent be one that holds the true faith, and
Reli^ion.





Master Perkins, Vol. 2. p. 74.

Quest. How many ways is Baptism taken in Scripture?

Answ. First, it signifies the superstitious washing of the Pharisees, who
bound themselves to the Baptismes, or washings of Cups, and Pots, Mark 7.4.

H^b. 9.10.

Mat. 28.19.

Luke 12.50.

Acts 1.5. and 11.16.

Apollos is said to teach the way of the Lord knowing only the Baptism (i. e.
the Doctrine) of John, Acts 18.15.

Quest. What is considerable about the matter of Baptism?

Answ. Three things: The sign; the thing signified; and the Apology of both?

Quest. What is the sign in Baptism?

Answ. Partly the element of water, Act. 8.16. and partly the right by divine
institution appertaining to the element, which is the Sacramental use of it in
washing of the body; and these two, water, and external washing of the body,
are the full, and complete sign of Baptism.

Quest. What is the thing signified, or the substance of Baptism?

Answ. Christ himself our Mediator, as he gave himself for our washing, and
cleansing, Ephesians. 5.6.

Quest. What is the Analogy and proportion of both?

Answ. Water resembles Christ crucified, with all his merits, 1 John 1.7. the
blood of Christ cleanses us, etc. i. e. the merit and efficacy of Christ
crucified frees us from our sins, and from the guilt, and punishment thereof.

Quest. What is it to baptize in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost?

Answ. First, these words signify to baptize by the commandment and authority
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Secondly, to baptize by, and with the invocation of the Name of the true Col.
3.17.

Thirdly, it signifies to wash with water, in token that the party baptized
has Cor. 1.13.

Quest. What then is done in Baptism?

Answ. The Covenant of Grace is solemnized between God and the party baptized.

Quest. What actions belong to God in this Covenant?

Answ. First, his making promise of reconciliation, i. e. of remission of sins,

Secondly, the obsignation, or sealing of this promise; and that is either
outward,

1. The outward seal is the washing by water: which washing serves not to seal
by nature, but by the institution of God in these words, Baptize them, etc.
Hence, Ephesians. 5.26.

2. The inward sealing is the earnest of Gods Spirit, Ephesians 1.13.

Quest. What is the action of the party baptized.

A^sw. A certain stipulation, or obligation whereby he binds himself to give
homage to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: which homage stands in faith,
whereby all Gods promises are believed, and in obedience to all Gods
Commandments. The sign of this obligation is, in that the party willingly
yields himself to be washed with water.

Quest. Why is it not said, In the Name of God, but in the Name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.

Answ. To teach us the right way to know and acknowledge the true God.

Quest. Wherein stands the knowledge of this true God?

Answ. First, that there is one God and no more. For though there be three
baptized in the Name of the Lord, Act. 10.48.

Secondly that this one true God is the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. A mystery

Thirdly, that these three are really distinct, so as the Father is first in
order,

Fourthly, that they are all one in operation, John 5.19. and especially in the

Fifthly, that they are all one in worship. For the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost,

Sixthly. that we are to know God, not as he is in himself, but as he has
revealed

Quest, May not Baptism be administered in Name of Christ alone, or in the Name
of God without mentioning the three persons?

Answ. No: For the true form of Baptism is prescribed by Christ himself; from
which we may not presume to vary.

Object. But, Acts 2.38. It Is said, repent and be baptized in the Name of
Christ?

Answ. Peter's intent there is, not to set down the form of Baptism, but the
end and scope thereof, which is, that we may attain to true fellowship with
Christ.

Quest. What are the ends of Baptism?

Answ. First, Baptism seems to be a pledge to us in respect of our weakness,
of all the graces and mercies of God, and especially of our union with Christ,
or remission of sins, and of mortification.

Interrogation of a good conscience, 1 Pet. 3.21.



Fourthly, its a means of unity. So its urged, Ephesians. 4.5. 1 Cor. 12.13.

Quest. Whether does the efficacy of Baptism extend it self to all sins, and
to the whole life of man?

Answ. ^he use of Baptism enlarges it self to the whole life of a man, and it
takes away all sins past, present, and to come; only with this caution, if the
party baptized stand to the order of Baptism, viz. to turn to God, and to
believe in Christ, and so to continue by a frequent renual of Faith and
Repentance, as occasion shall be offered.

Quest. How may this be proved?

Answ. First, because the Scripture speaks of them that had been long before
Baptized: and that in the time present Baptism saves, 1 Pet. 3.22. So Romans
6.4. and in the future tense, He that believes, and is baptized, shall be
saved: And Paul, Ephesians. 5.26. All which shows that Baptism has the same
efficacy after, which it had before the administration of it.

Isa. 54.10. Hos. 2.19. But the Covenant is the foundation or substance of
Baptism: therefore Baptism is not to be limited to any time, but must have
its efficacy so long as the Covenant is in force.



Quest. Whether does Baptism abolish Original sin?

Answ. The perfect and entire Baptism (in which the outward and inward are
joined together) abolisheth the punishment of sin, and the guilt, and the
fault; yet not simply, but in two respects.



Romans 7.20. Col. ^.5. Evil concupiscence! Ephesians. 4.22. therefore some portions of
the old man, and original sin remain after Baptism.

Quest. If persons baptized be sinners until death, what difference is there
between the godly and ungodly?

Answ. In them that are regenerate there is a sorrow for their inward
corruption, and for their sins past, with a detestation of them, and a purpose
to forsake sin, to which is joined an endeavor to please God in all his
Commandments. This is not in an ungodly man.

Quest. How does Baptism confer grace?

Answ. First, it confers grace, because its a means to give and exhibit to the
believer, Christ, with his benefits, and this it does by its signification; For
it serves as a peculiar, and infallible Certificate to assure the party
baptized of the forgiveness of his sins, and of eternal salvation: and whereas
the Minister in the Name of God applies the Promise of mercy to the baptized,
its as much as if God had made a peculiar Promise to him.

Secondly, it may be said to confer grace, because the outward washing of

Ob. A Sacrament is not only a signs and seal, but also an instrument to
convey the Grace of God to us?

Answ. Its not an instrument having the grace of God tied to it, or shut up in
it: but an instrument to which grace is present by assistance in the right use
thereof: because in, and with the right use of the Sacrament, God confers Grace,
so that its a moral, not a physical instrument.

Quest. Whither does Baptism imprint a mark or character upon the soul, which
is never blotted out.

Answ. In Scripture there is a twofold mark of distinction; one visible, the
other invisible.

Of the first kind was the blood of the Paschal Lamb in the first Passover:
For by it the first borne of the Israelites were marked, when the firstborn
of the Egyptians were stain: of this kind is Baptism; for by it Christians
are distinguished from Jews, Turks, etc.

The invisible mark is twofold:

First, the eternal election of God, 2 Timothy 2.19 by virtue of this Christ I
know my sheep, John 10.14. and by this the elect of all Nations are marked,
Rev. 7. and 9.

Secondly, the second is the gift of Regeneration, which is nothing else but
Ephesians. 1.13. 2 Cor. 1.22. and Baptism is a means to see this mark in us,
because its the Laver of Regeneration.

Ob. The male children amongst the Jews that were not circumcised were to be
cut off? Genesis 17.14. therefore it seems that Baptism is necessary to
salvation?

Answ. Its meant not of Infants, but of men, who being till then uncircumcised,
despised the Ordinance of God, and refused to be circumcised, as appears by the
words following: For h^ has made my Covenant void: Now Infants do not this,
but their Parents, or men of years.

Quest. Whether may such as are called Lay-persons, or private men, administer
Baptism?

Answ. Ministers of the Word only may do it. For to baptize is a part of the
public Ministry, Mat. 28.18. where preaching and baptizing are joined
together; and things that God has joined may no man separate. He that
performs any part of the public Ministry must have a lawful Call, Romans 10.14.
Heb. 3.5. but private persons have no Call to this business. Again, whatsoever
is not of faith is sin: Now for private persons to baptize, is not of faith;
for they have neither Precept nor Example for it in the Word of God, therefore
its sin.

Ob. But Zipporah circumcised her child? Exodus 4.28.

Answ. The example is many ways discommendable: For she did it in the presence
of her husband when there was no need. She did it in haste, that she might
prevent her husband. She did it in anger, for she cast the foreskin at his
feet; and it seems she was no believer but a mere Midianit^: for she contemned
Circumcision when she called her husband a man of blood, because of the
Circumcision of the child, v. 26. and in this respect it seems Moses either
sent her back, or she went away when he went down into Egypt. Some others think
that Moses was so stricken by the Angel, that he was unable to do it, yet her
fact was not justifiable.

Ob. A private person may teach; and therefore baptize?

Answ. Private and ministerial teaching are distinct in kind, as the authority
of a Magistrate, and Master of a family are distinct authorities. A private
person, as a Father, or Master, may instruct his children and servants: but he
does it by the right of a Father or Master, being so commanded by the Word of
God: but Ministers do it authoritatively by virtue of their Calling and Office,
as Ambassadors in the stead of Christ, 2 Cor. 5.21.

Quest. Wheth^r is Baptism administered by a wicked man, or an heretic, true
Baptism?

Answ. If the said Party be ordained, and stands in the room of a true Pastor,
and keeps the right form according to the institution of Christ, it is true
Baptism. Christ commands the Jews to hear the Scribes and Pharisees, because
they sat in Moses chair, Mat. 23.1. though Heretics and Apostates, because
they taught many points of Moses doctrine: but not only such.

Quest. Who are the persons that are to be baptized?

Answ. All such as be in the Covenant really, or in the judgment of charity,
and they are of two sorts.

Acts 2.38. and 10.38. and thus all such texts of Scripture, as require faith
and amendment of life in them that are baptized, are to be understood of
persons of years.



1. The Command of God, Mat. 28.18. Baptize all Nations, etc. wherein the
baptizing of Infants is prescribed. For the Apostles by virtue of this
Commission baptized whole families, Acts 16.15, 33. 1 Cor. 1.16.

2. Circumcizing of Infants was commanded by God, Genesis 17.14 but Baptism
succeeds in the room of Circumcision, Col. 2.11. therefore baptizing of Infants
is likewise commanded.

3. Infants of believing Parents are within the Covenant of grace: For this is
the tenor of the Covenant. I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed, Genesis
17.7. therefore they are to be baptized.

Ob. But this Promise was made to Abraham, as the father of the faithful.

Answ. It belongs to all believing Parents. For Exodus 20.6. God promises to
show mercy unto thousands of them that love him. And Acts 2.39. the Promise is
to you, and to your children, etc. And 1 Cor. 7.14. your children are holy, i.
e. in the judgment of charity they are to be esteemed as regenerate, and
sanctified: therefore they are to be baptized. For this is Peter's reason, Acts
2.38, 39. To whom the Promises belong, to them belongs Baptism: but to you and
your children the Promises belong, therefore you and your children are to be
baptized.

Ob. But we know not whether Infants are the children of God or no, and
therefore we may not baptize them?

Answ. First, the same may be said of men of years: for we know not whether
they be Gods children or no, how fairly soever they deport themselves; so that
by the like reason we may exclude them from the Sacraments.



Ob. Infants have not faith, and so their Baptism is unprofitable.

Answ. Some think that they have faith as they have regeneration, viz. in the
beginning, and seed thereof. But the faith of their Parents is their faith and
gives them right to Baptism, because the Parents receive the Promise, for
themselves and their children, and thus to be borne in the Church of believing
Parents, is instead of the Profession of faith.

Ob. Infants know not what is done when they are baptized?

Answ. Yet Baptism has its use in them. For its a seal of the Covenant, and a
means to admit them as visible members into the Church.

Quest. Whether are the children of Turks and Jews to be baptized?

Answ. No: because their Parents are out of the Covenant of grace.

Quest. Whether are children of professed Papists to be baptized?

Answ. Their Parents being baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost; and the Church of Rome, or Papacy, though it be not the Church of God:
yet is the Church of God hidden in the Papacy, and to be gathered out of it,
therefore I see not why the children of Papists may not be baptized: Only with
these two cautions.

1. That the aforesaid Parents desire this Baptism for their children.

2. That there be Sureties who will undertake for their training up in the true
faith.

Quest. Whether may children of p^ofane Christians that live scandalously be
baptizes?

Answ. They may. For all without exception that were borne of circumcised
Jews, (whereof many were profane) were circumcised: and we must not only
regard the next Parents, but the Ancestors, of whom its said, If the root be
holy, so are the branches, Romans 11.16. and there is no reason that the
wickedness of the Parent should prejudice the children in things pertaining to
life eternal.

Quest. How often is Baptism to be administered?

Answ. But once: for the efficacy of Baptism extends it self to the whole life
of man: and as we are but once borne, and once ingrafted into Christ: So we
must be but once baptized?

Quest. In what place is Baptism fittest to be administered?

Ans^. In the public Assembly, and Congregation of Gods people, and that for
the^e reasons.

First, Because Baptism is a part of the public Ministry, and a dependence
upon preaching the Word of God.

Secondly, the whole Congregation may be edified by opening the institution,
and doctrine of Baptism.

Thirdly, the whole Congregation is by prayer to present the Infant to God, and
to beg the regeneration and salvation of it, the prayers of many being the mo^e
effectual.

Fourthly, the whole Congregation is hereby made a witness of the Infant
visible membership.

Quest. What use are we to make of our Baptism?

Answ. First, our Baptism must put us in mind that we are admitted, and

Secondly, Our Baptism in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, i. e. to
acknowledge him to be our God and Father in Christ: To acknowledge his
Presence, and therefore always to walk as before him: To acknowledge his
Providence, and therefore to cast our care upon him: To acknowledge his
goodness and mercy, in the free pardon and forgiveness of our sins.

Thirdly, our Baptism must be to us as a storehouse of all comfort in the time
of our need: If thou be tempted by the devil, oppose against him thy
Baptism, in which God has promised and sealed unto thee the pardon of thy
sins, and life everlasting. If thou be troubled with doubtings* and
weakness of faith, consider that God has given thee an earnest, and pledge of
his loving kindness: Often look upon the Will of thy heavenly Father sealed,
and delivered unto thee in thy Baptism, and thou shall be comforted in all thy
doubts. If thou lie under any Cross or calamity, have recourse to thy
Baptism, in which God promised to be thy God, and of this Promise he will not
fail thee, etc.

Mr. Perk. Vol. 2. p. 256, etc.

CHAP. XVIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Blasphemy.
Quest. WHat is Blasphemy?

Answ. Blasphemy in the usual acceptance of the wo^d in Greek Authors
signifies any evil speech, or calumniation (as Beza notes) but by a phrase
peculiar to sacred Writers, the penmen of the Scriptures, it imports always an
ungodly speech, which though it be uttered against men, yet it reaches, and is
carried to the contumely of God himself. So, Matthew. 9.3. Romans 14.16. Tit. ^.2.
and its either against men, or God. For,

1. Every reproachful word tending to the hurt, or disgrace of any other man's
name, and credit is called blasphemy. So, Tit. 3.2. 1. Peter 4.4. Mark 3.2.

2. All such injurious, slanderous, or reproachful words as are uttered to the
disgrace of God, Religion, Gods Word, Ordinances, Creatures, Works, Ministers,
etc. are called Blasphemy: Against God, Rev. 13.6. His Name, Romans 2.24. His
Word, Tit. 2.5. Christ, Act. 26.11. Christians, Jam. 2.7. His Doctrine, 1 Timothy
6.1. Romans 3.8. Christian liberty, Romans 14.16. Teachers, 1 Cor. 4.13.
Christians, for abstaining from evil, 1 Pet. 4.4. the Holy Ghost, or his work,
Mat. 12.31.

Quest. What is blasphemy against (...) Holy Ghost?

Answ. It is a sin, not in deeds, and actions, but in reproachful words ( Mark
3.30.) uttered, not out of fear, nor (...) infirmity, as (...) did; and sick,
and frantic persons may do: but out of a malicious, and hateful heart, 1 Corinthians. 16.22. Heb. 10.16, 36. Not by one that is ignorant of Christ, as Paul
was when a blind Pharisee: but by one enlight^d through the Holy Ghost with
the knowledge of the Gospel, Heb. 6.4. Not of rashness, but of set purpose to
despite the known Doctrine and Works of Christ, Heb. 10.29. being accompanied
with a universal defection, or ^lling away from the whole truth of God, Heb.
6.6. as also with a general^ pollution, or filthiness of life, Mat. 12.45. 2
Pet, 2.20* and being irremissible, because such a^ commit it cannot repent,
Mat. 12.32. Heb. 6.6.

Quest. How many ways does blasphemy break out?

Answ. The Schoolmen say three ways.

1. Cum attribuitur Deo, quod ei non convenit. When we affirm that of God which
is umbeseeming his Majesty, and incompatible with his holy and Divine nature*
As to make him a creature, or a liar, or cruel, unjust, unmerciful, sinful, or
the cause of sin.

2. Cum a Deo removetur, quod ei convenit, when we deny that to God, which
indeed belongs to him, as 2 Chronicles. 32.17.

3. Cum attribuitur ereaturae, quod Deo appropriatur. When we put that upon a
creature which is proper to God: Thus when the Israelites had made a golden
calf, and said, This is thy God, O Israel, etc. Its called blasphemy, Neh.
9.18. they committed great blasphemies. See O. Sedgwicks Part. Sermon.

Quest. What means may we use to prevent, and cure tentations to Blasphemy?

Answ. First, we must get assurance of Gods love to us, and then we shall love
him, and love always thinks, and speaks well of the party beloved: But if we
once entertain thoughts that God hates us, and will curse us, then we will hate
him, and be ready to curse him: and this is incident to us when under some
great affliction, as we see in Jobs case: when God chastens us sore, and worse
then commonly he does others, and when we find some circumstances for which we
cannot find a president in the world, then we begin to apprehend some unkind
dealing from God, and concludes that he hates us, and then we will be ready to
hate him again, and begin to enter into some terms of blasphemy, to prevent
and cure which, we must know, that no afflictions, be they never so great,
unusual, or unhard of, are any certain signs of Gods anger, much less of his
hatred. Job was the first that was ever used as he was, and his foolish wife
would thence conclude that God hated her, and her husband. Jonah had a cross,
the like whereof was never in the world before, yet was it no fruit of Gods
hatred: Jacob had sore, and heavy afflictions, yet was it ever true, ( Jacob
have I loved) even when he afflicted him: and Esau had great outward
prosperity, and yet that was as true* Esau have I hated: Be then convinced that
God loves thee, and all the devils in hell, and all the lusts in Original sin
cannot make thee blaspheme God.

Rev. 16.11.



Satan indeed is a great blasphemer, and labors by all means to bring us to
it, but we must set the Word and Spirit of God against it, yea, and the Law of
nature too; and if at any time we be overtaken with it, yet we must remember
that its pardonable, 1 Timothy 1.13. I was (says Paul) a blasphemer, etc. yea,
which worse, he compelled many to blaspheme, yet (says he) I obtained mercy,
Mat. 12.31. Christ tells us that upon repentance it shall be forgiven. The
Devil would persuade us that all blasphemy is the sin against the Holy Ghost:
but we must deny it, and our reason must be, because we are sorry for it, and
were it to be done again, we would not do it for all the world: but he that
sins against the Holy Ghost is not sorry for it, is not grieved for his
offense: would have all others to commit the same sin: Is desirous to have
Hell as full as he can: wishes that wife, children, Parents, friends,
neighbors, all might commit the sin against the holy Ghost as he has done.
See Capell on Tentations.

Quest. How does the hainousness of this sin of Blasphemy appear?

Answ. First, Its one of the most horrid sins in the world: Some sins are more
Lev. 24.10, 11. Isa. 36, 6. Hab. 3.14.

Secondly, Its an high contempt of God, a desperate flying into his face, a
Job. 1. ult. It so provokes God that usually he cuts them off sooner then other
sinners, as those that are ripe for destruction.

Thirdly, It argues the highest ingratitude in the world: for a man like a mad
crucify Christ afresh, Heb. 6.6. Magis offendunt qui blasphemant Christum
regnantem in coelis, quam qui crucifixerunt ambulantem in terris. Aug. they are
worse then those that actually crucified him.

Fourthly, it exceedingly debaseth a man, and makes him viler then the

Fifthly, it is a most unprofitable sin: other sins have some seeming pleasure,

Sixthly, such are guilty of the most pestilent scandal that can be: they
grieve Mat. 18.6, 7.

Seventhly, it is a sin which makes men most like the damned in hell. As the
Rev. 16.9. how will they be filled with blasphemies, when they shall be filled
with the wrath of God for ever.

Eighthly, as its the greatest sin, so it makes men liable to the greatest
judgments nor madness, but out of malice, deliberation, and obstinacy, the
party should die without mercy, Lev. 24.13, 14, 15, 16. This was not a judicial
Law belonging to the Jews only, but it being of the Law of Nature, is a
universal Law for all Nations: Hence wicked ^ezabel, that she might stone
Naboth to death, proclaims him a blasphemer, 1 Kings 21.11, 14. So John 19.7.
and they stoned Stephen for this pretended cause, Act. 7.57. Nebuchad^ezzar by
the light of Nature made a decree, that whosoever blasphemed the God of Heaven,
etc. should be cut in pieces, and his house be made a dunghill, Dan. 3.29. How
much more should Christian Magistrates make severe Laws for the punishment of
such notorious offenders, which if they neglect to do, as their light is
greater, so their punishment shall be greater: They punish Thieves, and
Murderers with death: They punish Traitors that seek to destroy the lives of
Princes, or that speak against their honor and dignity with death, and shall
not he that speaks against the King of Kings die the death? And when men
neglect their duty in this kind, God takes the sword into his own hand: He cut
off blasphemous Senacharib, and his Army for it, 2 King. 19.35. The Syrians
blaspheming God, and calling him the God of the Mountains, but not of the
Valleys, many thousands of them lost their lives for it, 1 King. 20.29, 30.
blasphemous Arius voided his bowels, and died miserable. See many more Examples
of Gods judgments upon Blasphemers, and blasphemous Heretics in my Mirror in
those two Chapters.

Master Hall upon 2 Timothy 3.2.

Quest. How comes Satan to tempt Gods children to blasphemy?

Answ. When he cannot overcharge the conscience of the weak Christians, by
ripping up, and aggravating those sins which he has in truth committed, nor
cause him desperately to desist from going forward in the course of
sanctification, then he suggests into his mind horrible blasphemies against
Gods Majesty, and continually turmoils him with most impious thoughts, that
thereby he may distract his mind from holy meditations, and utterly discourage
him in all Christian exercises.

Quest. Of how many sorts are these his hellish suggestions?

A^sw. Of two sorts. 1. Such as seem to have some ground in corrupted reason,
for the sugge^ting whereof he oft-times uses our sinful flesh as his wicked
instrument: and these arise sometimes from our overgreat prosperity whereby we
are brought to forget, and neglect the Lord who has been so bountiful unto us:
sometimes from the grievousnesse of afflictions, whereby men are moved to
murmur against God, and to repine at his judgments; sometimes from some
offense unjustly taken from Gods Word, or works: As from the plainness of the
Scriptures, the unequal dispensation of Gods benefits, and punishments whence
arise these tentations: that there is no God, or if there be, yet no particular
providence: that he has not eyes to see all things, nor power to rule them:
That he is not just in his judgments, but an accepter of persons: That his
Word is not true, either in the promises or threatenings: That he makes little
account of virtue to reward it, or of sin to punish it: neither yet has
provided either a Heaven for the godly, or a Hell for the wicked: that let men
do what they can, yet in the end either all, or none shall be saved, etc.

Quest. How are we to resist these blasphemous suggestions?

Answ. First, we should* as soon as they are suggested, reject them as
abominable, saying to our selves, God forbid that I should entertain such a
blasphemous thought of the most Mighty, Wise, Just, and gracious God:
especially having no reason for it but the false suggestion of the Devil, who
is a liar from the beginning, and by his lies seeks my destruction.

earnest prayer desiring him to enlighten our minds by his Spirit, that we may
clearle discern his truth, and the falsehood of Satan, and that he will incline
our hearts to submit our judgments to his truth, and reject Satan's damnable
lies.

Thirdly, we must endeavor to enrich our minds with such a measure wise to
salvation.

Fourthly, we must open our state to some able friend, who may teach us

Quest. What is the other kind of blasphemous tentations?

Answ. Such as are without all show of reason, or appearance of truth,
sencelesly absurd, and no less admirable for their sottishness, then for
their hellish impiety; and these cannot without trembling be thought on:
neither does Satan use the help of the flesh herein as he does in other
tentations, it being no fit instrument for this employment, because these
blasphemies are so horribly wicked that they are above the conceit of corrupt
nature, but are the immediate product of hell, Satan casting them into the
mind like wildfire with great swiftness and violence. Or if the flesh be
used herein, yet its not with delight, but with fear and horror, seeing there
is neither pleasure nor profit in them, but a fearful expectation of speedy
vengeance if we swallow them with consent.

Quest. What is Satan's chiefest scope in these tentations?

Answ. First, he has no hope to prevail with a Christian to approve of

Secondly, he labors hereby to overthrow their faith, and to bring them to

Thirdly, when by manifold experiences he has learned that by these
suggestions

Quest. How may we comfort and strengthen our hearts against these wicked
Blasphemies?

Answ. First, consider that they are not our own thoughts, but Satan's
suggestions, and therefore they shall not be charged upon us as our sins, but
shall

Quest. How shall we know that they are Satan's suggestions, and not our own
thoughts?

Answ. Fir^, In that they are so outragiously wicked, that even nature, they
capable of them who have received some measure of grace, and in the
uprightness of their hearts desire to fear, love, and serve the Lord.

Secondly, they may be discerned to be from Satan by the manner of their
injection, which is not voluntary and upon choice; but sudden, as a flash of
lightning, with such unavoidable violence that they cannot be prevented, and
that continually, one following in the neck of another.

Thirdly, whereas a man's own thoughts being natural, work no extraordinary
perturbation in the mind: on the contrary, these blasphemous suggestions strike
the heart with such horror and fear, that thereby the understanding is
astonished, the heart quakes, the mind is distracted, the joints tremble, etc.





Quest. But how shall we know that we resist these blasphemies?

Answ. First, in our own outward man we resist them, when we do not actually
yield by words, or deeds, so as that our yielding is subject to our senses.

Secondly, inwardly we resist them, when we neither approve them in our
judgments, nor embrace them with our wills, nor incline to them in our
affections with liking and delight.



Object. Yet I fear that I have so much revolved these blasphemous tentations
in my mind, and have been so negligent, and slow in rejecting them, that I
doubt much I have yielded some liking to them?

Answ. First, there is nothing more common then for an afflicted conscience to
accuse when it is innocent, and to lay a heavy burden upon it self where the
Lord gives a discharge.



1. Because this sin being committed through infirmity is pardonable, and
therefore if thou repent and bewail it, hate and abhor it, strive and
endeavor to mortify it, God (according to his gracious promise) will freely
remit it.

2. It Is not committed by the Christian man, if we speak properly, but by the
flesh, and unregenerate part, and therefore it shall never be imputed to the
spiritual man, who resists it all he may: but to the flesh, which alone shall
b^ar the punishment, God using to that end not only the hammer of his Word, but
also temporary crosses and afflictions.

3. God measures not our sins according to the nature, and matter of the sins
themselves, but rather according to the affection of the sinner, which gives
the form and being thereunto: in regard whereof the greatest sin being
entertained by the concupiscence only, and there crushed and choked, is
esteemed by God a far less sin, then the least degree of wickedness which is
willingly committed, nourished, or defended.

Quest. By what means may we be freed from these hellish blasphemies?

Answ. First, we must have recourse to God by fervent prayer, entreating him to
rebuke Satan, and to restrain his malice, either that he may not cast his
hellish wildfire of blasphemous thoughts into our minds, or at least that he
will quench them at their first entrance that they may not inflame our
concupiscence with the least liking of them.

we are to appeal to the Lord the searcher of our hearts, as the supreme Judge,
and having the testimony of our consciences to bear witness with us, we are to
protest our innocence: and so to disavow these wicked suggestions, and to
protest such hatred of them, that we would rather die a thousand deaths then
yield the least assent to them.

Thirdly, we are not to make such account of these suggestions as that thereby
our

Object. This indeed were a good course for such as have quiet minds: but I am
so distracted in every holy duty, with these blasphemous suggestions, that I
cannot perform them with und^rstanding, so that they become unprofitable to me,
and (I fear) they are turned into sin?

Answ. Though thou can not perform these duties as thou would, yet do them
as well as thou can; yea the more thou art troubled in them, be the more
earnest in doing of them; for they are the best weapons to repel Satan,
whereof if Satan can disarme thee he will be sure to prevail. They are Gods
Ordinances, and therefore though thou find no present good by them, yet thou
must do them in obedience to Gods command: And so in the end thou shall find
that God accepts thy endeavors, and will pardon thy infirmities, and give such
a blessing to them by his Spirit, that they shall bring joy and comfort to thy
heart.

Fourthly, we must not revolve these blasphemous suggestions in our minds,

Fifthly, we must have a special care to avoid idleness, and solitariness,
and Eccles. 4.10. giving Satan a great advantage against us: which made the
Devil when he tempted Christ to make choice of the wilderness, having by
manifold experience found that such solitary places are fittest for his purpose.

Sixthly, if for all this we cannot be rid of them, we must not too earnestly

CHAP. XIX. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about our Bodies.
Quest. WHat is the condition and state of our bodies in this life?

Answ. They are vile and base, and that not only the bodies of the wicked, but
also of the dearest children of God, Phil. 3.21.

Quest. How may this be made out?

Answ. Our Original is base, we are dust, and to dust we must return. Besides,
our continuance is full of changes, we are subject to sickness, sores, pain,
hunger, etc. and base we are, because we are upheld by inferior creatures. We
enter into the world one way, and then go out a thousand: sometimes by violent,
sometimes by more natural deaths: Are subject to diverse diseases, loathsome to
the eyes and noses, especially when we are nearest our end: then our
countenances wax pale, our members tremble, and all our beauty is gone: when we
are dead, our carcass is so lothsom, that it must be had out of sight, yea,
though of Abraham, Genesis 23.4. For as man's body is of the finest temper of all
others, so the corruption of it is most vile.

Quest. Is there then no glory belonging to our bodies?

Answ. Yea* For, First, its Gods Workmanship, and therefore excellent: so
excellent, as the Heathen Galen being stricken into admiration at the admirable
frame thereof, brake out into an Hymn of praise to the Maker of it: and David
cries out, I am wonderfully made, Psalm. 139. God made this his last work as an
epitome of all the rest.

Secondly, the Scripture teaches us that we owe glory to our bodies, and
therefore it forbids us to wrong our bodies, and speaks infamously of
self-murtherers, as of Saul, Achitophel, Judas, etc. and God to show the
respect that we owe to our bodies has provided pleasing objects for every
sense, as ^ight for the eyes, flowers for the smell, and music for the ears,
etc.

Thirdly, these bodies of ours are members of Christ redeemed, and sanctified
Temples of the Holy Ghost, indeed as it keeps the soul from heaven, so its the
grave of the soul: but otherwise its the House, Temple, and instrument of the
soul.

Quest. But can those bodies be called base for which Christ shed his precious
blood?

Answ. Whilst Gods children live here, their bodies are in no better a
condition then the bodies of others: Hezekiah is sick: Lazarus has his sores;
David and Job are troubled with loathsome diseases: and its reason it should be
so. For,

1. It was so with Christ, he took our base ragged nature on him: He hungered,
thirsted, was pained, yea, death had a little power over him* and shall we
desire a better condition then our head, and Master had? Its (...) decree that
we must return to the dust as all (...) fellow Saints have done* (...) we must
partake with (...) mean estate* (...) we will partake (...) his glory.

2. Hereby God does exercise our faith, and hope, causing ^s to expect a
bettter resurrection; and by this means our desires are quickened after a
better life.

3. As yet there is sin in us, from the danger whereof, though we are
delivered, yet there is corruption which remains behind in us; and by this God
will teach us to see the contagion of sin, and how the devil has deceived
us, when he promised a better condition.

4. It shows Gods wisdom in vanquishing sin by death, which is the child of
sin: For be it we shall be purged from sin, and from corruption both of
body and mind, and thus is our base estate made a way to our excellent estate
hereafter.

Quest. Shall these vile bodies of ours be raised again at the last day?

Answ. Yea, its an article of our faith: it was typified by Aarons dry rod
budding, and by Jonas's deliverance out of the belly of the fish, where he had
been three days, and three nights: It was believed of all the Fathers, Heb.
11.13. Its a grounded truth that these bodies of ours that are sown in
corruption, shall be raised in incorruption, 1 Corinthians. 15.4^. And for our
further security, Enoch before, and Elias after the flood, were taken into
heaven in their bodies.

Again, its not contrary to reason, though above the reach of reason; For
Christ takes care that the dust whereof we are made, and to which we return be
preserved: and why cannot Christ as well raise a body out of the dust, as at
first he made it out of the dust, especially seeing the soul is preserved in
heaven to this end, to be joined again to it. Nay, it is not contrary to the
course of nature: We yearly see that Summer succeeds Winter, Day the Night,
Youth comes out of Infancy, Man's age out of Youth, and 1 Cor. 15.36. Thou fool,
the corn is not quickened except it die. Nay we see daily strange things
wrought by Art, and shall we think Gods Almighty power cannot work more strange
effects.

Quest. Who shall raise up our bodies at the last day?

Answ. Christ, John 6.39, 40. For he is our Head, and the body must be
conformable to the Head: Hence, Romans 8.11. If the Spirit does dwell in us
that dwells in Christ, the Spirit that raised him up, will raise us up also.



Adam: as we did bear the image of the first Adam in corruption, so we must
bear the image of the second Adam in glory.





Quest. What may the consideration hereof teach us?

Answ. First, it may strengthen our faith in consideration that we have such

Secondly, it may direct us how to honor our bodies, not making them
instruments

Thirdly, to labor to assure our selves of our parts in this change at our
resurrection,

1. If we find Christ's Spirit in us. For then the same Spirit that raised him
up, if he be in us, will raise us up also, Romans 8.11. For the first
resurrection is an argument of the second, and he that finds his understanding
enlightened, his will p^able, and his affections set upon right objects, will
easily believe the resurrection of his body.

2. If we hope for this change, and so hope, that we are stirred up thereby to
fit our selves for it.

3. If we grow in grace, 2 Pet. 1.11. it is a sign that we have an entrance into
Christ's Kingdom: For God does ever honor growth with assurance of a blessed
estate.

Fourthly, this may comfort us in time of death, considering that we lose
nothing depositum which God commits to the fire, air, earth, water, etc.
must be rendered up again pure, and changed by Christ.

Fifthly, it may comfort us also at the death, and departure of our friends,
These. 4.18.

Sixthly, to pray to God to teach us to number our days so that we may apply
Psalm. 90.12.

Quest. When shall the time of this blessed change be?

Answ. At the day of judgment, and not before, as will appear by these
Reasons.

1. Because all are then to be gathered together: even those that were buried
four thousand years ago must stay till the number be fulfilled: And it will
make for the honor of Christ that we should all meet together to attend on him
with multitudes of Angels, so that they cannot be perfected without, or before
us, and we shall not prevent those that are asleep.

2. This makes for the comfort of Christians that are weak, that the Martyrs,
and constant professors of Christ should be pledges of their rising, who
continually ^ry, How long Lord?

3. Gods will is that now things should be carried in a cloud, and that the
last day should be the day of revelation, which could not be, if this change
should be before.

Quest. But how shall our bodies be fashioned to Christ's glorious body?

Answ. First, as he is immortal never to die again, so shall we, we shall be

Secondly, we shall be incorruptible, we shall neither have corruption within
Cor. 15.53. we shall be embalmed with the Spirit that shall cause us for ever
to be incorruptible.

Thirdly, we shall be unchangable: always the same without sickness of body,

Fourthly, we shall be in perfect strength: Here we contract to our selves
weakness from every little thing, as alteration of air, labor, etc. but
there the body shall be enabled to every thing, whereas here we are weak,
unfit, and soon weary of every duty: Even Moses hands must be supported.



Object. But Christ retained wounds after his resurrection, much more shall we
be imperfect?

Answ. This was a voluntary dispensation for a time for the strengthening of
Thomas his faith, not of any necessity.

Cor. 15.44. A natural body is upheld by natural means, as meat, drink,
Physic, etc. but then there shall be no ^eed of such things. Christ shall be
all in all to us.



The ground of the glory of these our bodies shall be the beatifical vision,
and our union with Christ. If our beholding him here in his Ordinances be of
such a power as to translate us from glory to glory, 2 Cor. 3.18. what a change
shall be wrought in us, when we shall see him as he is? and if his first coming
had that power in it to make all things new, 2 Corinthians. 5.17. much more when he
comes the second time in glory shall he make all things new and glorious.

Quest. What lessons may the consideration hereof teach us?

Answ. First, in all cases of dismay and trouble, it may encourage us rather to
lose our bodies, then to offend God, knowing that if we give them for God, we
shall receive them again with advantage.





Job, though covered with ulcers, cheerfully to say, My Redeemer lives, etc.



Sibs on Phil. 3.21.

Quest. How may our bodies be made serviceable to our minds, and instrumental
to Gods glory?

Answ. They must be maintained with great care, but not with much tenderness:
For we should use them to be content with a little, and with things easy, and
ordinary, looking less for pleasure, then for health, which yet is the way to
get a lasting pleasure.

Quest. Why should we be so careful of the health of our bodies?

Answ. Because of all earthly things it is the most precious: without health of
the body the mind will have much ado to maintain its liberty, and stability:
the disorder of the humors of the body disturb the mind, and make i^ froward;
yea, sometimes reason is qui^e overturned by reason of some corporal
indisposition.

Quest. By what means then may the health of our bodies be preserved?

Answ. Especially by these (...) things.

1. Serenity of mind. 2. A sober di^. 3. Exercise.

Quest. How is serenity of mind a means to preserve bodily health.

Answ. Serenity of mind, and health of the body preserve one another: But the
mind is a more powerful agent upon the body, then the body upon the mind. A
cheerful spirit keeps the body healthful, whereas frequent excessive fits of
choler, and deep sadness, sour the whole mass of blood, and poison the
fountain of animal spirits* whereby the body loses its lively color, and good
plight, and droops into a lingering consumption, Prove. 12.25. Heaviness in the
heart makes it stoop, Prove. 15.13. By sorrow of heart the spirit is broken; and
on the contrary, Prove. 17.22. A merry heart does good lik^ a medicine; and to
get this mercy heart the Wise man advises us to keep our minds in a mild
temper. Prove. 11.17. The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he that is
cruel troubles his own flesh: And the body thus preserved in health by the
serenity of the mind, pays him readily for that good office: for the mind is
kept in tranquillity by the good constitution of the body.

Quest. How is a sober diet (...) means to preserve the health of the body?

Answ. As there is nothing that wears the body, and sets the mind out of frame
so much as intemperance in diet: and truly not only such as glut themselves
with meat and drink, but generally all that live plentifully, ea^ and drink too
much, and confound in their stomachs too many various ingredients, giving to
nature more then it needs, and more then it can dispense with; which
superfluity, that especially of the third concoction, turns into ill humors,
whence various diseases are bred, answerable to the variety of our dishes, as
in the Commonwealth idle persons* and useless soldiers are they that stir up
seditions, and trouble the State.

Then natural heat, which serves to the nutritive faculty, being put to an over
great labor, wears away before the time; and the spirits serving to make the
pot boil below, leave the intellectual part ill served in the upper room: and
that overplus of nourishment growing to pride of blood, breeds no better effect
in the soul then to swell the appetite, and to provoke it to rebellion against
the reason: whereas if we would bring our selves to a more simple, and sparing
diet, both our bodies and minds would enjoy a better health: The fewer vapors
the belly sends to the brains, besides what are necessary, the clearer is the
sky in that upper region: the best rule therefore for such as feast
plentifully, is to fast frequently: Most sicknesses in their beginnings, may be
cured by this abstinence.

Quest. But what should they do that use sparing diet?

Answ They should allow themselves some seasons for good cheer. Indeed it
oppresses such whose ordinary meals are so many feasts: but it renews the
vigor of those that use it seldom: wine is given by God to make glad the
heart of man, Psalm. 104.15. Prove. 31.6. It Is of singular virtue to charm cares:
A draught or two extraordinary, when the mind is dejected with crosses, will
put upon a man's businesses a smoother and calmer face.

Quest. How does exercise conduce to the health of the body?

Answ. Without exercise the body becomes a^ unweildy bag of corrupt humors:
Great eaters need the more exercise, but the most sober need some: the
naturallest, and pleasantest is walking, to which they that use a sedentary
life, must allow sometime: But if one be shut up, or has lost the use of his
legs, he must invent some other way instead of walking to exercise his body,
and prevent sickness, and if he cannot use exercise, he must eat and drink the
less.

It Is a wise course to harden the bodies of children, and young men especially,
against cold, which is the cause of most diseases in aged persons: But when one
has been tenderly brought up, it is imprudence to go about to inure his body to
hardness in his declining age, which is more then it can bear.

Quest. These are good rules to preserve bodily health, but how shall we mend
it when its impaired?

Answ. First, Physicians must be consulted withal, and remedies used; about
which two rules should be observed.

1. Let it be betimes, before sickness has taken root.

2. Let it be seldom: For two many remedies are worse then the disease.
Physic, and Physicians should be used for necessity, not for wantonness: the
chief use of that Art is to prevent diseases. But every man ought to have
enough of it to know his own body, and to keep off the indispositions to which
he is obnoxious, and not to wear out his body with drugs without great
necessity: There are certain simple, and easy helps which being used betimes
would prevent great inconveniences; and what wise man would not keep himself
from painful diseases, if the use of a little Sage, or Juniper berries would do
it, whatsoever remedies are used for the prevention of sicknesses, it is
certain that the abstinence from unwholesome things is better then the use of
wholesome.









He that ventures much money at play, ventures with it, not only the
tranquillity of his mind, but makes a certain loss of it, whatsoever becomes
of the money: this bold venturing proceeds not from a contempt of this worlds
goods (as such Gamesters pretend) but out of an insatiable greediness to gain
much in a short time: wherefore to them that have but a little money, and to
great lovers of it, great losses at play are very smarting: and yet the gain is
more hurtful then the loss: for it enflames Covetousness, and sets the heart
upon a wicked labor to grow rich by the ruin of others: Hereby also the
Fountain of Charity is dried up, and so the streams of charitable deeds:
squand^ing away of money in play, is not the way to make friends of that
un^ighteous Mammon, that receive a man into everlasting habitations, but an
enemy rather, that will turn him out of his temporal habitation. It is the way
to lose both Earth and Heaven.

When we have an undoubted right to our money, and the present possession of
it, what a mad part is it to call that into question whether it must be ours or
another, and decide that question with the cast of a Die? And what
ungratefulness is it to the great giver of all good gifts, to play those gifts
away, which he has afforded us of his bounteous liberality, and which have
been acquired for us by the sweat and hard labor of others: and though the
pa^ties at play be consenting to that strange way of acquisition, yet that
consent makes it not lawful, neither of them being owner of those goods which
he calls his, but only Stewards, who must give an account to their master. So
then, whether we win, or lose we commit robbery: For if we rob not our
adversary* we rob our selves, our families, and God: and herein are worse then
that ill servant that hid his talent in a napkin: for the Gamester if he be a
looser has made away his talent wherewith God had entrusted him: and though he
be a gainer, yet he makes himself incapable of giving a good account of his
talent to his Lord, seeing he has put it to an unrighteous bank.

Dr. Du Moulin upon Contentment.

Quest. Why is just honor due to our bodies?

Answ. As they are necessary instruments of the soul to work by: As they are
Temples of the holy Ghost, and as they are members of Christ's body.

Quest. How manifold is the care of our bodies?

Ans. The one Evil, and forbidden, which tends to the fulfilling of the lusts
of the flesh, Romans 13.14. the other good, and lawful which tends to the
preservation of our life, and health, that so we may be the better fitted and
enabled to the duties of our callings, general, and special.

CHAP. XX. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Borrowing, and Lending.
Quest. WHat rule is the Borrower to observe toward the Lender?

Answ. That he do nothing to the hurt, and hinderance of him in his outward
estate.

Quest. How may the Borrower hurt the Lender in his outward estate?

Atsw. First, when the borrower does not return, Kings 6.5. Psalm. 37.21. Romans
13.8.

Secondly, if he return or restore not the thing borrowed to the lender in
Jews, if the debtor deferred to pay his debt, he was to be sold, and his wife,
and children, etc. as appears, 2 Kings 4.1. Hence, Prove. 3.28.

Thirdly, when borrowing things that are spent in the use, as Bread, Bear,
Exodus 22.14. and 2 King. 4.7.

Quest. Upon what ground is the borrower to restore the thing borrowed as good
as it came to his hands? Or if it be hurt or spoiled through his negligence, or
want of care, or good usage, he is bound to make satisfaction for the damage?

Answ. Upon this ground of Equity: Because the borrower only receives benefit
by the thing lent, so long as he has the use of it, therefore he is bound to
make it good, if any hurt come to it through his want of care and good usage.

Quest. What if the borrower of money, or other things by the immediate hand of
God, and not by any negligence, or default of his own, is disenabled to restore
it, what must he do in such a case?

Answ. He is then to humble himself to the lender requesting his favor, and to
purpose restitution, and to promise payment whenever God shall enable him,
and if God does make him able, to perform it, Prove. 6.3. Matthew. 18.26.

Quest. What if the lender be dead, and none left to require the thing lent,
what must the borrower then do?

Answ. He is to restote it to the child of the lender if he have any; or if
none, then to his next of kin, or for want of such, or if none can be found,
then he must restore it to the Church, or to the poor, Numb. 5.7, 8. Dan. 4.24.
Luke 19.8.

Quest. How else may the borrower sin in borrowing?

Answ. When he borrows any thing of his neighbor, especially money for ill
ends and purposes: as to maintain his pride, riot, and excess: Or when he
borrows, that by the thing borrowed he may hurt another in his person, or
outward estate: Or when one having a sufficient stock of his own to manage his
trade, and live comfortably, yet he borrows to enable him to engrosse and
monopolize all, or most of a commodity into his own hands to the great hurt and
prejudice of others: This is an evil eye, Prove. 28.22. So, Isa. 5.8. Hab. 2.6,
9, 10.

Quest. How may the lender sin by lending?

Answ. First, when he lends to such persons as he knows borrow for ill ends,
and purposes, as to maintain pride, luxury, etc. or to wrong, hurt, vex, and
trouble others: whereas lending being an act of charity, properly should be
done to the poor, Psalm. 112.5. Exodus 22.15.

Exodus 22.25.

Deuteronomy. 24.10, 11.

Exodus 22.26, 27. Isa. 58.6. Mat. 18.29, 30.

Quest. What if the borrower dissembled when he borrowed, pretending that he
was able to pay when he knew he was not: or being able refuses to pay, as many
bankrupts do: may not rigor be used to such?

Answ. Yea, the lender may lawfully cast such an one into prison, and so make
him bear the burden of his pride, dissimulation, and injustice, Prove. 20.16.
and 22.27. No pity is to be showed to rash and foolish Sureties: nor to
dissembling borrowers. See Elton on the Commandments.

Quest. whether is it lawful to put money out to usury?

Answ. Before this can be answered, we must consider,

1. Who it is that borrows, whether a poor brother that is constrained to it by
need: or a rich tradesman that takes it up to enlarge his trade: or a rich man
that lays it out upon superfluous occasions. Now you may not receive profit
from him that borrows out of necessity. To the poorest of all you must give and
not lend: To the next rank of poor you must lend freely; but if a man will
borrow that money which you could improve your self for enriching of him, or
that will wantonly lay it out for his mere pleasure, the case is very
different: For God has not commanded me to love any man more then my self:
neither is there any reason that I should deny my own advantage to maintain
another man's excess.

2. Upon what terms do you lend? whether upon an absolute contract for a set
profit, whatever becomes of the principal, or upon a friendly trust to a
voluntary satisfaction according to the good improvement of the sum lent. The
former is not safe: for where there has been an honest endeavor to make an
advantage, which yet has been disappointed by an unavoidable casualty, or
force, there to require interest, cannot be without oppression. But the latter
is undoubtedly lawful, and such as are conscionable will think themselves as
strongly bound to it by the Law of gratitude, as by any bond whatsoever.

3. If you make an absolute contract? Is it upon a certainty, or upon an
adventure? For if you are willing to hazard the principal, there can be no
reason why you may not take part of the advantage.

4. Where the trade is ordinarily certain, there are yet further considerations
to be had: For the clearing whereof these grounds may be laid down.

1. That the value of moneys, or other commodities is arbitrable according to
the Sovereign authority, and use of several Kingdoms, and Countries.

2. That whatsoever commodity may be sold, is capable of profit in the loan of
it: therefore a horse, or an ox, etc. seeing it may be sold, it may be let out
for profit.

3. That money it self is not only the price of all commodities in all civil
Nations, but in some cases is a traffickable commodity, the price whereof rises
and falls in several countries upon diverse occasions, and yields either profit
or loss in the exchange of it.

There can be no doubt therefore but that money thus considered, being as it
were turned into Merchandise, may be bought, and sold, and thereby improved to
a just profit.

Quest. But whether may money merely considered as the price of all other
commodities be let forth to profit?

Answ. All usury, which is an absolute contract for mere loan of money, is
unlawful, both by Law natural, and positive: both divine and humane; and that
for these reasons.

1. Because nature teaches us that money is not capable of supersaetation, or
increase.

2. That no man ought to set a price on that which is not his own.

3. That the use of the stock once received, is not the lenders but the
borrowers: for the power of disposing of it, is for the time transferred by
contract into the borrowers hands: If the lender then by virtue of such a
contract takes interest, he does but in a legal way rob the borrower.

That the Scripture forbids this practice, appears, Exodus 22.25. Lev. 25.36,
37. Deuteronomy. 23.19, 20. Neh, 5.7. Psalm. 15.5. Prove. 28.8. Ezekiel. 18.8.

Many Heathen Nations have also condemned such contracts.

It has been condemned by the Council of Vienna, and other Ecclesiastical
Laws. Yet, though it be unlawful to covenant for a certain profit for the mere
loan of money, there are other circumstances about it, which allows the lender
lawful liberty to take use for his money, especially in these two cases.

1. If he sustains loss, and misses of gain by want of his money lent: for why
should I hurt my self to pleasure another, and enrich another by mine own loss?

2. If I shall incur a real loss, or forfeiture by the delayed payment of the
sum lent, I may justly look for satisfaction from the borrower: yea, if there
be an apparent danger of loss to me at the time of the contract, nothing
hinders but that I may secure such a sum as may be sufficient for my indemnity.
And if I see an opportunity of an apparent profit that I could make by
disbursing such a sum of money, and another that has a more gainful bargain in
chase, shall desire to borrow my money for his greater advantage, there is no
reason why I should have greater respect to his profit then mine own, and
therefore upon contract I may secure to my self such a moderate sum, as may be
somewhat answerable to the gain, which I willingly forgo for his greater
profit.

In brief, to guide us in borrowing, and lending, our only rule is charity: For
in all humane, and civil acts of commerce, its a sure rule: that whatsoever is
not a violation of charity is lawful. And what is not agreeable to charity is
sinful. And as charity must be our rule, so our selves must be the rule of our
charity. Look what you could wish to be done to you by others, do you the same
to them, and so you cannot be guilty of the breach of charity; that will tell
you that if you can find out a way whether by loan, or sale to advance your
stock, that is free from oppression, and beneficial to others as well as to
your selves, you need not fear to walk in it with all honest security.

B. Halls Cas. of Conscience.

CHAP. XXI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Brethren, and brotherly
love amongst Christians.
Quest. ARe all Gods children brethren?

Answ. Yes, as is proved, Col. 1.2. 1 Timothy 6.2. Mat. 23.8.

Quest. Why are they brethren?

Answ. First, because they are borne of the same womb, Pet. 1.23.

Secondly, they are adopted of the same Father, Ephesians. 4.5.

Thirdly, they are brought up in the same family, Ephesians. 3.17.

Fourthly, they are estated in the same inheritance, Romans 8.17.

Fifthly, they are written amongst the living in the same City, Isa.

Sixthly, they execute the same Office of Prophets and Priests to God, Rev.

Quest. What comfort may the consideration hereof afford them?

Answ. That though they are despised in the world, yet they are a people of a
great kindred: the meanest Christian has as good friends as the greatest
Potentate. Grace works, as it were, a consanguinity with all the Saints.

Quest. What duties may the consideration hereof teach them?

Answ. First, to live familiarly together, to visit them, and not to be
strangers Acts 15.36.

Secondly, to do all things faithfully each to other, 3 John 5.

Thirdly, to defend each other by words and deeds: Let not a brother be

Fourthly, to supply their wants with brotherly affection, James 1.15. Joh.
3.17.

Fifthly, to love them without dissimulation, Romans 12.9, 10. and 13.8. Col. 3.
Ephesians. 4.16. 1 John 3.11. and 4.21.

Quest. What evils must they avoid upon this consideration?

Answ. First, they must take heed of contention, Genesis 13.8. and that 1. By
public suits at Law, 1 Cor. 6.1, etc. 2. By private quarrels, or discords.


Object. But they do me wrong.

Answ. 1. Admonish them of it, Lev. 19.17. Mat. 18.18.

2. Be not rashly angry with them, Mat. 5.22.

3. If they repent, forgive them to seventy seven times, Mat. 18.21. and be
quickly reconciled, Mat. 5.23, 24.

Kingdom of God with us, Rev. 1.9.



Quest. How shall I know who are Gods children, and so my Brethren?

Answ. First, by their innocence: they bear their fathers image.



Joh. 4.5.



Quest. What good shall I get by them?

Answ. First, by associating thy self with them, thou may escape many
judgments. Sodom had been spared for ten righteous persons: and get much good.
Potiphars House is blessed for Joseph's sake, and Labans for Jacobs.





Quest. Why should we be so careful to love the brethren?

Answ. First, because it much commends us to God.

Joh. 3.14.

Joh. 3.19.

Joh. 4.7.

Joh. 4.11.

Mat. 11.41.

Joh. 4.17.

Quest. How may I know whether my love to them be unfeigned?

Answ. First, if thou be as willing to do them good as to proffer it, 1 John
3.18.

Phil. 2.3.

Ephesians. 1.15.













Quest. What are the impediments of brotherly love?

Answ. Either ignorance will blind thee, or envy will corrupt thee; or pride,
and inequality of gifts and place will swell thee; or infirmities will dull
thee; or forgetfulness will disappoint thee; or objections and excuses will
deceive thee; or trespasses will alienate thee; or the scorns of the world will
discourage thee.

Quest. How may the ferventnesse of our love to the brethren be known?

Answ. First, if thou accountest it thy greatest felicity on earth, next to the
Psalm 16.3.

Secondly, if thou have enflamed desires after their fellowship.

Thirdly, if thou can cover a multitude of faults in them, 1 Pet. 4.8.

Fourthly, if thou can be at pains for them: Love is laborious.

Fifthly, if thou art speedy in doing them good, Prove. 3.28.

Sixthly, if thou lamentest thy absence from them as a bitter cross.

Seventhly, if thou do daily and heartily pray for them, and give thanks

4.8.

Fourthly, converse much together, have fellowship in Gospel duties.

Fifthly, consider the promises made hereunto, Ephesians. 4.15, 16. 2 Pet. 1.9, 10,
11. Phil. 2.1.

Quest. With what kind of love must we love the brethren?

Answ. First, it must be a natural love, even such an one as arises out of our
Cor. 8.8.

Secondly, it must be a sincere love, without dissimulation, Romans 12.10. not in
Joh. 3.18.

Thirdly, it must be a fervent love: they must be loved above all other people,
Pet. 4 8. 2 Pet. 1.7.

Fourthly, it must be a pure love, that comes from a pure heart, 1 Timothy 1.5. A
Col. 1.8.

Fifthly, it must be a diligent love that will express it self upon all
occasions: These. 1.3. Heb. 6.10.

Sixthly, it must be a speedy love, Prove. 3.28.

Seventhly, it must be an humble love, a love that would ever serve the
brethren, Gal. 5.13. Ephesians. 1.15. and 4.2. Prove. 19.7.

Eighthly, it must be a constant love, Gal. 4.18.

Ninthly, it must be a growing love, Phil. 1.9. 1 These. 4.10.

Quest. What rules are we to observe that brotherly love may continue amongst
us?

Answ. First, some things are to be avoided: as

1. We must not fashion our selves according to this world, but avoid all
needless conversation with wicked men, Romans 12.1, 2.

2. We must take heed of, and avoid such as low discord, or cause divisions
amongst men: whether such as go about to seduce men into opinions, Romans 16.19.
Gal. 5.12. 2 Pet. 3.16. or such as make contention in practice.

3. Take heed of being ensnared with vainglorious desires after worldly
greatness, either in Church or Commonwealth, Mat. 23.8. Gal. 5. ult.

4. Take heed of conceitednesse, or willfulness in judgment: we must not be
wise in our own eyes, but rather in lowliness of mind esteem other men's
gifts, and judgments better then our own, Phil. 2.3. Romans 12.10, 16. Prove.
12.15.

5. Take heed of worldliness, and self-love, and minding of our own things,
and studying our own ends in conversing with others, 1 Cor. 13.5. Phil. 2.4.

6. Take heed of overmuch retiredness, and neglecting comfortable fellowship
with our brethren, Heb. 10.25. Phil. 1.6. Psalm. 133.1.

Secondly, some things are to be practiced: as,

1. We must provoke one another to love, both by words, and actions which must
be without flattery, and dissimulation, Heb. 10.24.

2. We must strive without complement to show the sound proof of our love in
all our actions: and by the fruits of it in all well-doing, strive to approve
our selves to God and before men in this thing, 2 Cor. 8.24.

3. In all that we do to, or for the brethren, we should do them in a loving
and respectful manner, 1 Cor. 16.14.

4. We must strive to be rightly ordered toward our brethren, in case of sin
against God, or trespass against us.

Quest. How may this be done?

Answ. First, if we know a fault in our brother, and find that it tempts us to
alienation from him, we must follow Gods counsel, Lev. 19.17. Reprove him
plainly.

CHAP. XXII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Buying, and selling.
Quest. WHat Rule is the Buyer to observe in Buying?

Answ. That therein he do nothing that may tend to the hurt, and prejudice of
his neighbor in his outward welfare and estate.

Quest. How may the Buyer sin in buying?

Answ. First, When the Buyer debaseth the Commodity which he would buy,
dispraising it above Prove. 20 4. Isa. 5.20. Matthew. 7.12.

Secondly, When he takes advantage of the Sellers simplicity, or present
necessity Genesis 23.9, 13. Abraham would give the full price, and Levit. 25.14,
15, 16.

Object. But Jacob took advantage of Esau's present need to buy his Birthright
of him for a mess of pottage?

Answ. This fact of Jacobs was extraordinary, and therefore is no rule for us
to walk by: besides he was informed by his Mother that Gods purpose was to deny
the blessing to him, and therefore he took this opportunity of buying the
Birthright, being (probably) moved thereto by the Spirit of God.

Thirdly, When the Buyer makes bad payment for the commodity he buys: as
Abraham, Genesis 23.16.

Quest. What rule must the Seller observe in selling?

Answ. He must not hurt, or prejudice his neighbor in his outward estate
thereby?

Quest. How is this done?

Answ. First* By praising and extolling the thing he sells above the known
Psalm. 15.2. His tongue speaking that which his heart and conscience tells him
is false.

Genesis ^.15. Lev. (...) Amos 8.5.



Amos 8.6.

Lev. 19.35, 36. Deuteronomy. 25.13, 14, 15. Ezekiel. 45.10. Mic. 6.10, 11. Prove. 11.1.
and 20.10.

Quest. How else does the seller sin by hurting his neighbor in his outward
estate?

Answ. By raising the just price of things, or wracking them to so unmeasurable
a rate, as that thereby he oppresses his neighbor. Forbidden, Lev. 25.14, 15,
16. 1 These. 4.6. (...), significat modum excedere in augendis rerum preciis.

Object. May I not make the best of mine own?

Answ. No, he may not make what he can of his own to the hu^, wrong, and
oppression of another, it being against Christ's rule, ( Mat. 7.12.) and that
Gal. 5.15.

Quest. How then are we to prize the commodities which we sell?

Answ. Not according to our own greedy mind, but according to the rule of
equity, i. e. according to the true value of the thing, and the benefit its
like to yield to the buyer, Lev. 25.14, etc.

etc. Or things that tend merely to maintain pride, and vanity: as painting,
complexion, patches, etc. or tending merely to maintain superstition, as
Beads, Crosses, Crucifixes, etc. Isa. 55.2. Acts 19.24. See Elton on the
Commandments.

Quest. Whether may a man sell his wares as dear as he can, and get what he can
of every buyer?

Answ. For answer hereunto I lay down these Propositions.

1. There is a due price to be set upon every saleable commodity, else commerce
amongst men would be destroyed: For if every man might set what rate he
pleases upon his land or goods, where should he find a buyer? surely nothing
would follow but confusion, and want: for then merely extremity must both make
the market, and regulate it.

2. The due price is that which cuts equally, and indifferently betwixt the
buyer, and seller, so that the seller may have a moderate gain, and the buyer
a just pennyworth.

3. In those countries where there is a price set, by public authority, upon
marketable commodities, the way of commerce is easy, and its fit that every
one should be kept close to that rule.

4. Where all things are left arbitrary there were no living, if some limits
were not set to the sellers demands.

5. These limits must be the ordinary price used in the several Countries
wherein they are sold; and the judgment of wise, experienced, and unconcerned
persons: and the well-stated conscience of the seller.

6. If men shall wilfully run beyond these bounds, and take advantage of the
rareness of the commodity, or the ^aucity, and necessity of the buyers, to
enhance the price, to an unreasonable height, they are guilty of the b^each of
charity, and by making a sinful bargain procure to themselves a cu^se.

7. Yet is not a man so strictly tied to any others valuation as that he may
not upon any occasion, ask or receive more then the common price: or that if
the market rise he is bound to sit still. For there may be a just reason upon a
general mortality of cattle to set his beasts unsold, at a higher rate, or upon
a dearth of corn, or other commodities to heighten the price: But in such cases
we must observe these rules.

1. We must grudge our selves our own gain. 2. We must not be of the first that
enhance the price: but must rather be the lowest in our valuation, and labor
what we may to bring down the market, always putting our selves in the buyers
room, and think how we should wish to be dealt with if we were in his case.
8. It Is lawful for the sel^er in his price to have regard not to his
disbursments only, but to his labor, cost, delay of benefit, to his loss in
managing, to his hazard, or difficulty in conveyance: but yet in all these with
such moderation, as that he may be a just gainer by the bargain: not reckoning
the buyer, nor hasting to be rich by the secret spoils of an oppressed
neighbor.

9. Those things whose only end is pleasure, or ornament, as a jewel, a hauk,
a hound, etc. can admit of no certain value: The owners affection must
estimate it, and the buyers desire must make up an unbounded bargain: yet in
these, and all other things not necessary, conscience will tell us that we must
so sell as we would be content to buy.

Quest. What follows from the consideration of all this?

Answ. First, that those common maxims amongst tradsmen: That things are so
much worth as they can be sold for. That men who are masters of their wares may
heighten their prizes at their pleasure, and get what they can of the buyers:
and that whatsoever they get by the simplicity, or nenecessity of the buyer, is
lawful price, are damnably uncharitable, and unjust.

Quest. Whether is the seller bound to make known to the buyer the faults of
that which he is about to sell?

Answ. For answer hereunto consideration must be had of diverse circumstances. As

1. What the nature, and quality of the fault is, whether it be small, or such
as makes the thing unuseful or dangerous to the buyer. Or whether the fault be
apparent or secret: Now concerning those, small faults may be concealed without
injustice: main, and important must be revealed. Again, if apparent faults be
not discerned by the buyer, he may thank himself: But secret faults known only
to the seller (if they be such as may be prejudicial to the buyer) ought not to
be concealed: or if the seller do conceal them, when as the buyer pays as if
they were sound and perfect, the seller is bound in conscience, either to void
the bargain, or give just satisfaction.

2. It must be considered whether the buyer before the bargain concluded, has
desired the seller to discover the faults, and out of a reliance upon his
fidelity, and warrant has made up the match? or whether in confidence of his
own skill he made up the bargain without moving any question? If the former, a
double bond lies upon the seller to deal faithfully, that so the buyer may
either cease: or if he shall see that notwithstanding that defect it may serve
his turn, he may proportion the price accordingly: But if the buyer do
peremptorily rely upon his own judgment, hoping to make a gain by his
bargain, because the seller out of conscience of the imperfection, sets it (as
he ought) at the lower rate, and thereupon makes up the match, and will stand
to all hazards, I see no reason why the seller may not receive his full price:
But if it be dangerous to the buyer (as if the horse be subject to perilous
starting, or stumbling: or if the land be liable to a litigious claim, etc.)
the seller is bound in conscience at least after the bargain) to reveal it,
that the buyer may provide to prevent the mischief as much as may be.

But if the seller shall use art to cover the defects of his commodity, or
shall mix faulty wares with sound that they may pass undiscovered, he is more
faulty then his wares, and makes an ill bargain for his soul.

Quest. What general rules are to be observed in buying and selling?

Answ. First, that it is not lawful for a Christian Chapman to thrive by fraud.











Quest. Whether may a man sell his Commodities the dearer for giving days of
payment?

Answ. For answer hereunto we must remember that there are (according to the
Casuists) three strages of prices. 1. The highest, which they call Rigorous. 2.
The mean. 3. The lowest. If these keep within due bounds, though the highest be
hard, yet it is not unjust, and if the lowest be favorable, yet it is not
always necessary. If rhen you proportion but a just price to the time, and
worth of your bargain, so that the present shall pass at the easiest price:
Some short time for the mean, and the longer delay for the highest, I see not
wherein you do offend.

Quest. What reason may be rendered to prove this lawful?

Answ. It is not mere time which is here set to s^le, which were odious in any
Christian to bargain for: but there are two other considerations which render
it lawful.

1. The hazard of money agreed upon, which often comes short in the payment,
whilst inferior Chapmen, into whose hands the commodity is scattered, prove^
bankrupts: so as much loss hereby comes many times to the confident seller,
whence is that proverb, A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

2. The cessation of that gain which the Merchant might have made of his money
in the mean time, which probably might have been greater then the proportion of
the raised price can amount to.

Quest. What if the seller be occasioned to call for his money, being driven to
it by some emergent necessity, or drawn by the opportunity of a more gainful
bargain, before the time wherein it is due?

Answ. He ought then to make an abatement proportionable to that time
prevented, and that by reason of the inconvenience, or loss which the buyer
sustaines, who may hereby be put upon straits, and inconveniences in getting in
the money before the time appointed. But what quantity is to be allowed on the
one part; or defalked on the other, is only to be moderated by Christian
Charity, and that universal rule of doing what we would be willing to suffer.

Quest. Whether, and how far does a fraudulent bargain bind men in conscience
to performance?

Answ. Is the fraud actively yours, done by you to another? or passively put by
another upon you: If the former? you must repent and make satisfaction, either
by annuling the match, or making amends for the injury. If the latter: wherein
did the fraud lie? If in the main substance of the thing sold? the bargain is
void, both by the Law of nature, and of conscience: As if a man has sold
copper for gold-lace: or alchymie for silver; the reason given by the Casuists,
is, because there is no bargain without consent. but here is no consent at all
whilst both parties pitch not upon the same subject: The buyer propounds to
himself gold, etc. the seller obtrudes copper, etc. the one therefore not
buying what the other pretended to sell, here is no bargain, but a mere act of
cousenage, liable to punishment both by the Laws of God and man. But if the
fraud were only in some circumstances, as in some faulty condition of the
thing sold not before discerned, or in the overprizing the commodity bought,
the old rule is, Cavearemptor. You must hold to your bargain: But if the fault
be so great that it mars the commodity, the seller (being conscious to the
fault) is bound to make satisfaction.

In the matters of contract we must distinguish betwixt a willing deceit, and
an unvoluntary wrong. If a man shall sell a horse which he knows to have a
secret and incurable disease, to another for a sound one: and that other,
believing the sellers protestation, shall upon the same price put him off to
me: I am injured, but whither shall I go for amends? Not to the immediate
seller, for he deceived me not: nor to the deceiver, for he dealt not with me:
In this case, though the Law will not help me, yet the first seller is bound in
conscience to give me, by his hands that sold me this injurious bargain, due
satisfaction.

There may be no less fraud in buying also: whether in unjust payment in false
coin: or in buying by weights, or measures above allowance: or by wrong
valuation of the substance and quality of the commodity, not known by the
seller: As for example: A simple country man finds a quantity of Ambergreece
cast upon the shore, and not knowing it, greaseth his shoes, etc. with it: A
crafty Merchant that knows the worth of it, buys it for a small matter, and
makes a great gain by it: The bargain is fraudulent, and requires a just
recompense to the ignorant seller, into whose hands providence had cast so rich
a booty.

Quest. Whether may a man lawfully buy those goods which he knows, or strongly
suspects to be stolen? Or if he has ignorantly bought such goods, whether may
he lawfully, after the knowledge of the owner, keep them?

Answ. To buy such goods as you know, or have just cause to suspect that they
are stolen, makes you accessory to the theft: For if there were no receivers,
there would be no thieves: But if, making use of Saint Paul's rule concerning
meats, you extend your liberty to whatsoever is sold in the market, and shall
in the exercise of that freedom upon a just, and valuable consideration
ignorantly buy those goods, which you afterward hear, and know to be another,
your contract is faultlesse, since your invincible want of knowledge acquits
you from any guilt of consent: yet withal, you are bound to acquaint the true
owner with the matter, and to proffer your selves ready to join with him in
the prosecution of the Law upon the offender, and upon an equal satisfaction to
tender him his own.

B. Halls Cas. of Conscience.

Quest. What are the general rules that Christians should observe in all their
dealings with others?

Answ. That we carry and behave our selves simply and uprightly, honestly, and
with a good conscience as in the sight of God, who sees not only our outward
actions, but the inwards thoughts of our hearts: and therefore they should do
as Paul, Heb. 13.18. We trust that we have a good conscience in all things,
willing to live honestly; and on the the contrary, in all our contracts we must
shun all guile, and deceit, and all double dealing tending to the undermining
and circumventing our neighbors, as Paul exhorts, 1 These. 4.6. Let no man go
beyond, or defraud his brother, etc. and David tells us, Psalm. 5.6. that God
abhors the deceitful man.

Quest. What particular rules are to be observed?

Answ. First, in all our dealings we must observe truth in all our words, and
not only speak it from our lips, but from our hearts, hating, and avoiding all
subtle equivocations, and mental reservations tending to deceive those with
whom we deal, Zac. 8.16.

Psalm. 15.2, 4.







Quest. What evils are to be avoided in our dealings with others?

Answ. First, lying, and equivocation which is as bad, Prove. 21.6. Getting
treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity, etc. Prou. 13.11. wealth gotten by
vanity shall be diminished, etc. yea, though a man could get the whole world by
it, what would it profit him seeing thereby he loses his soul, Rev. 22.15. and
21.8.

Prove. 10.2. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, etc.





Quest. What duties are required of us in buying and selling?

Answ. These were mentioned before, yet I shall run them over with some
additions.

1. The seller must be the truly, and lawful owner of the things which he
sells, or his deputy appointed by him, and that the buyer do not for his
private gain, buy any thing from any whom he thinks not to have any right to
sell it: therefore they offend which buy stolen goods if they know it, or who
sacrilegiously buy and sell Church Livings, and such things as have been freely
consecrated to the service of God, of which sort are they that have bought
Bishops, and Deanes, and Chapters lands, and Impropriations.

Secondly, the seller ought to sell, and the buyer to buy such things as are
Simon Magus, Acts 8.18. or holy things which belong to God, and those who sell,
and buy justice, or injustice by bribery given, or taken to fill their own
purse^, and to pervert right, Isa. 1.23. and 5.23. Amos 2.6. They also who sell
and buy truth and lies, as false witnesses, and such as hire them to give in
false testimony. But most of all, such as for corruptible things sell their
souls unto sin as Ahab did, 1 King. 21.20. and those, 2 King. 17.17.

Thirdly, we ought also to sell only such things as are fit for sale, or
knowing them

Fourthly, we must sell such things only as are some ways profitable to the

Fifthly, we ought in selling and buying to set our wares at an equal price,
the best Prove. 11.26. Neither may the buyer desire to have commodities under
the worth, especially when he has to deal with the poor, whose necessities
oft-times constrain them to take, not what their wares are worth, but what they
can get for them. Such Shop keepers therefore offend grievously who take
advantage of their poverty who work for them, sinfully to oppress them,
forcing them to sell their tears, sighs, and groans with their wares, because
wanting bread to put into their own, and their childrens mouths; they refuse to
buy their wares, not because they do not want them but that thereby they may
beat them down to the vilest prizes, and so pinch and almost starve them who
work hard for a poor living, whilst the buyer by his excessive gains, lives in

Sixthly, in regard of the manner of buying and selling, we ought to use honest
simplicity, avoiding all manner of fraud and deceit: They therefore offend who
use a thousand devices to circumvent, and defraud their neighbors, as

1. By blinding their minds with their false praises of their wares, and their
eyes with false, and deceitful lights.

2. By concealing the known faults of their wares, endeavoring to get the
highest prices, as though they were faultlesse.

3. By asking double the price of their commodity, and taking it also if they
can prevail with the buyer to give it.

4. By abusing their friends under color of love, selling dearer to them then
they would to a mere stranger.

5. By telling untruths either about the worth of their commodities, or the
price which they cost them, or the money that they have been offered, or that
which they will take, and not under, and often confirming their lives with
intermingled oaths; and many other cheats which I cannot name.

Quest. How may these sins in buying and selling be avoided.

Answ. If (as we profess) we would prefer justice, and charity, before deceit
and self-love. 1. If we would consider that God is present, and beholds all our
dealings, to whom ere long we must give an account, 1 These. 4.6. And lastly, if
we would remember that it will profit us nothing to win the whole world with
the loss of our souls, Mark 8.36.

Mr. Downams guide to godliness?

CHAP. XXIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about our Callings, and
Vocations.
Quest. OUght every man to have a Calling?

Answ. Yea, as may appear by these Scriptures, Eccles. 1.13. Ephesians. 4.18.
Christ himself had one, Mark 6.3. 1 These. 4.11.

Quest. Is it a sufficient calling for a man to attend upon another, as serving
men do?

Answ. To attend upon the persons of Magistrates and Nobles is a warrantable
calling, especially having some particular employment annexed to it, as to be
Cook, Butler, Clerk, Croome, etc. So had Cornelius servants, Acts 10.7.

Quest. How must we behave our selves in our particular callings?

Answ. We must be diligent, painful, and faithful therein, Genes. 3.19. Psalm.
128.2. Prove. 10.4. and 13.4. and 22.29. 2 These. 3.10. Genesis 31.40.

Quest. Suppose a man have enough to maintain him, and his without a calling?

Answ. Yet if he be able, he must employ himself in some particular calling,
either in Church or State, and be diligent therein: He must eat his bread
either in the sweat of his brain, or of his brow. Adam himself must work, Genesis
2.15. See Elton on the Commandments.

Quest. How else may we prove that all must have callings?

Answ. From the Examples of Gods Saints in all ages: as of Abel, etc. before
the flood: the Patriarchs after the flood, and many under the Gospel.

Quest. Why must we use faithfulness and diligence therein?

Answ. First, because he that is slothful, and negligent therein, or walks
Prove. 18.9.

Secondly, diligence in a calling, is the work of the Lord: and therefore he
Jer. 48.10.

Thirdly, God of his rich mercy has allowed us six days, not to loiter, but
Exodus 20.9.



Quest. How may this be proved?

Answ. By the woeful experience of such as have either used unlawful callings,
as Thieves, Cheaters, Gamesters, Parasites, Stage Players, etc. Or else that
have lived without a calling, who besides that they are commonly unprofitable
Caterpillars, yea burthensom, and chargeable to others, they either grow
profane in their lives, or fall away from the truth of religion into damnable
sects, and erroneous doctrines.

Quest. How may we prove that diligent walking in our callings is so acceptable
to God?

Answ. Because as he that has no lawful calling, or that walks negligently
in one that is lawful, transgresses all the Commandments of the second Table,
thereby highly displeasing God, and pulling a curse upon himself: So he that
walks diligently in a lawful calling, keeps Gods Commandments, and so has a
promise of a blessing annexed to it, Lev. 20.26. Deuteronomy. 28.8. Prove. 10.4, 22.

Quest. Do all that walk painfully in a lawful calling please God?

Answ. No, except withal they observe these rules.

1. That such be true believers, without which its impossible to please God,
Heb. 11.6. and such as are careful daily to amend their lives.

2. They must follow their earthly businesses with heavenly minds: and see
that their worldly affairs do not justle out the seasonable performance of
holy duties: that so they may also thrive in grace, and be good husbands for
their souls.

3. That they so shun unnecessary meddling with other men's matters, that
withal they be not so shut up in their bowels, as to neglect their brethrens
causes, when duty and conscience calls for their asistance.

Quest. How is conscionable walking in our callings a furtherance to a godly
life.

Answ. Because therein we follow God in doing that which he requires at our
hands, and imitate the example of the godly that went before us, who have found
the benefit and comfort of it.

Practice of Christianity.

Quest. Why else must we have, and attend upon our particular callings?

Answ. First, God has commanded us to labor the six days, and to do all our
work, Exodus 20.9, 10.

Bezaleel, Exodus 31.2. etc. So Isa. 28.24. etc. and 54.16.

Genesis 3.19. 1 These. 4.11. and such as will not work, must not eat, 2 These.
3.10. etc. Its a character of a good woman, Prove. 31.27. Idelness is disorder,
2 These. 3.8.

Fourthly, The promise of plenty, comfort, and blessing is made to the
diligent, Prove. 10.4. and 13.4. and 12.27. Hence Psalm. 128.1, 2. Isa. 3.10. Mr.
Reyners Precepts.

Fifthly, Man is born to travel, and labor, Job. 5.7.

Quest. What else may move us to diligence in our particular callings?

Answ. Remember that God who has set us in our callings, has promised Prove.
28.19. and 10.4. See also, Jos. 1.8.

Secondly, whereas all other creatures live to themselves, man was appointed to
live to others as well as to himself; the Church, his Country, family, the

Thirdly, an honest calling is a School of Christianity. For,

1. As we send little children to School to keep them out of harms way, and
unhappy turns: so diligence in our callings fenceth us against Satan's
tentations: and it is a bridle to restrain our own lewd desires, abating wicked
lusts, abandoning loose commpany, and fitting us for the Lords coming, when we
are in his service.

2. Whilst in this School we perform duties for the Lords sake, we have daily
practice and increase of graces, such, as faith, obedience, patience,
meekness, constancy, truth, invocation, thanksgiving, and by experience of
Gods goodness for the time pas^, we are the better enabled to depend upon him
for the time to come.

3. In this School also we learn to be teachers of others, and to be patterns
to others of the right use of the world, whilst our selves use it daily, as
not using it: whilst we so play the good husbands, as that we keep our selves
from being worldlings: not laying aside our heavenly minds, whilst we are
about our worldly businesses.

Fourthly, consider the danger of those that stand idle all the day long,
passing Paul says, that such as live in pleasure are dead while they live:
They are out of Gods protection, never out of Satan's snares: their heart, like
the field of the sluggard, its overgrown with the nettles of lusts, etc. As
rust frets iron unused, and moths garments unworne, so good things are shaken
out of the hearts of idle persons; their souls are but as salt to keep their
bodies from stinking: It shall one day be said to them, Take that unprofitable
servant, etc. Mat. 25.30. Tailor on Titus.

Quest. May not a man change his particular calling if he dislike it, and like
another better?

Answ. Every one ought to continue constantly, and conscionably in his
particular calling; wherein their calling to grace did find them if it be
warrantable, and lawful, as we see, 1 Cor. 7.10. No comfortable change of a
calling can be made but in these cases.

1. Of private necessity, when a man is disenabled to follow it, or cannot get
a subsistence by it.

2. Or for the common good, and that truly so, not hypocritically pretended,
and for by-respects. If any man then upon the giving of his name to religion,
shall grow into neglect, distaste, or dereliction of his honest particular
calling, we may ever strongly suspect him of hollownesse, and hypocrisy: Hence
Mr. Perkins says, Though a man be endued with excellent gifts, and be able to
speak well, to conceive prayer, and with some reverence hear the Word, and
receive the Sacraments, yet if he practice not the duties of Godliness within
his own calling, all is but hypocrisy. See Boltons first Vol.

Quest. How may we live by faith in the exercise of our particular callings?

Answ. When considering that its Gods Ordinance that men should labor in some
honest vocation for their private maintenance, and the common good, we believe
the promises that he has made of protection, and blessing us therein. The
Texts of Scripture are plain for both, Genesis 2.15. and 3.19. Ephesians. 4.28. 1 Corinthians. 7.10. 1 These. 4.11, 12. 2 These. 3.10, 11, 12. Prove. 10.4. and 12.17.
and 13.11. and 12.24. and 22.29. Psalm 91.11.

Quest. Why is it necessary that we should live by faith in them?

Answ. To prevent the evils which beset us in our ordinary callings, as
covetousness, injustice, impatience and distracting care. Naturally men are
apt to incumber themselves with superfluous businesses, and trouble themselves
about the event and success: they content not themselves with their lot and
condition, but desire to heap up riches above measure: they forecast many
things in their heads long before, and know no end of their cares. The trouble
which we meet with in the world, begets love of the world, and whether it be
crossed or prosper, the more they be exercised about the things of this life,
the more they follow after them with greediness, vexation, discontent,
plotting how to compass their designs, whether by right or wrong, by fraud or
oppression. Now the Sovereigne remedy against these, and such other mischiefs
is a lively faith, which lifts up the heart to better things, quietly
submitting to the good pleasure of God, commending the success of all their
honest employments to his Highness, and resting upon his grace for present
help and future supply in the use of such means as he has ordained, Heb. 11.6.

Quest. What are the acts of faith in this particular?

Answ. First, it informs us to make choice of an honest calling for which we
are fitted, and into which we may enter by direct, good, and lawful means,
Prove. 16.20.

Prove. 3.5, 6. For if we do, either it shall not effect what we do intend, or
if we bring it to pass, yet it shall not succeed, or avail to those honest
uses which we intended, Psalm 127.1, 2. Hag. 1.6, 9. Eccl. 9.11.



Psalm. 128.2. Ephesians. 6.5, 6. Faith awakens the sluggard, rowseth the lazy, makes
the idle lay his bones to work, Prove. 31.13, 15. and him that was a purloiner
to deal truly, justly, and honestly.

Isa. 7.4. Jos. 7.5. Prove. 31.17. 2 Timothy 1.7, 8, 9. Heb. 11.7. Mark 6.18. Heb.
11.9, 10.

ill report, and good report, honor and disgrace, Heb. 11.35, 36, 37. 1 Cor.
4.3. 1 These. 2.6, 9. Phil. 3.7, 8. It directs us to order the affairs of our
callings wisely, and to go about them in a good manner, i. e. in obedience to
God, to right ends, and with an heavenly mind, exercising the graces that God
has bestowed on us, Eccl. 2.26. 1 Samuel 18.14.

Eighthly, it teaches to moderate our cares, confine desires of earthly things,
Psalm. 55.22. Mat. 6.32. 1 Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 127.^. Prove. 16.3.

Ninthly, it supporteth with strength patiently to bear the miseries, and Adam
we are subject unto, and works the soul to contentation in every estate,
Phil. 4.11, 12.

Tenthly, it restrains distrustful cares about the success of our labors,
but Phil. 4.6.

Eleventhly, if we find wished success, it makes us vigilant, frugal, humble,
Cor. 7.31. Prove. 21.25, 26. Psalm. 112.9.

Twelfthly, Faith coupleth the labors of our callings with the practice of
Christianity.

Quest. But how may we live by faith touching the success of our labors,
which we find too much above our strength or means?

Answ. First, faith in such cases causes self-denial in respect of our
judgment, Prove. 3.5. and 16.2. and 21.2. Jer. 10.23. Lam. 3.37.

Secondly, it teaches submission to Gods direction, and depends upon his Jude
1.1. and 20.18, 23, 28. Isa. 8.20. It chooses what God approves, though to
humane wisdom it seems bootlesse, and improbable. It trusts God for ability
to the work, provision of the means, the disposition of them, and the good
success to come by them, Mat. 6.25. and 10.19. Psalm. 32.8. Ezra. 5.5.

Thirdly, it brings forth industry and endeavor to serve Gods providence: He

Fourthly, it cannot be silent in such a case, but sends us to God by prayer,
Chron. 20.12. Psalm. 5.2, 3.

Fifthly, it puts life and hardiness in us to play the men, Judge. 5.8.

Sixthly, it waits upon God for good success, and triumphs before the
victory, Prove. 16.3.

Seventhly, its ready and forward to praise God for good success, Psa. 103.1,
2. Judge. 5.9, 10, 11. See Ball on Faith.

Quest. How many sorts of men transgress about their callings?

Answ. First, such as run into callings before God sends them. Many such
intruders

Secondly, such as live by such ways as God calls them from: as by usury,

Thirdly, such as do the work of their calling at an unlawful time: as on the

Fourthly, such as abide not in their Callings.

Fifthly, such as meddle with many callings: being called but to one.



Byfield on Peter.

Quest. What must we propose to our selves in following the duties of our
particular callings?

Answ. We must not make gain our end therein, as Heathens and Turks do, and all
that do so are servants and drudges to Mammon, but Christians ought to follow
their work, because God has so appointed, aiming also at the good of the
Church and Commonwealth, and our own gain must come in on the by, as it shall
please God to send it. We must follow our callings as a means God has
appointed to keep us from idleness, and to humble us thereby, and that we may
be instruments of the common good. Rogers on Pet.

Quest. What other Rules are to be observed in our particular callings?

Answ. First, that our calling be lawful and agreeable to Gods Will, and Word:
such an one as our labor in it may tend to Gods glory, and to the good of the
Church and Commonwealth, and the furthering, not only of our temporal, but our
spiritual good, and the eternal salvation of our souls.



Cor. 7.20, 24.



1. For our persons we must be regenerate, and sanctified: for our persons must
be accepted, before our works can please God, Tit. 1.15. To the pure all things
are pure, etc. All that a wicked man does is abominable, Prove. 21.27.4. neither
can such expect a blessing upon their labors, Ps. 1.3. and 112.1, 2, etc. and
128.1. Gods promise belongs only to the righteous as appears in those Texts. 2.
The duties of our callings must be performed in faith: as was showed before,
Heb. 11.6. Joh. 15.5. Romans 14.23.

2. They must proceed out of unfeigned love to God and our neighbors, which is
the fountain of all true obedience, and not principally from self-love, and
love of the world: the love of God will move us to consecrate our lives, and
labors wholly unto him, and love unto our neighbors will make us to seek
their good as well as our own, 1 Cor. 13.5. Gal. 5.13.

3. They must be directed to right ends: As 1. Principally to Gods glory, which
we should advance in every thing, 1 Cor. 10.31. 2. The good of the Church and
Commonwealth, which we should prefer before our private good. 3. So to aim at
our own profit, as that we join there with the welfare, and benefit of our
neighbors, and not raise our gain out of their losses.


4. Our care must be to perform the duties of our callings after a right
manner: For which end we must, first follow our earthly businesses with
heavenly minds, and affections; as Citizens of Heaven, and pilgrims on earth,
longing after the joys of our own country, Phil. 3.20. Coll. 3.1, 2.
especially in the midst of our ordinary businesses, we should often lift up our
hearts to God, craving his blessing in, and giving him praise at the end of our
work, not forgetting Christ's Counsel, Mat. 6.33. Secondly, we must sanctify
them by the Word and prayer: The first is done when we labor to see our
warrant out of Scripture for all we do: doing all things both for substance and
manner as Gods Word requires and directs: The second is done when by prayer
we desire Gods blessing upon all our labors, and return him thanks when we
have obtained it, Col. 3.17. For its Gods blessing only that makes rich, Prove.
10.22. Deuteronomy. 8.13.18. He gives, and he takes away, Job 1.21. 1 Samuel 2.8. Psalm.
113.7. Abraham and Lot by Gods blessing waxed rich, Genesis 13.5, 6. and Isaac,
Genesis 26.3.12. and Jacob, Genesis 32.10. without which all our labor is in vain,
Psalm. 127.1, 2. God will blow upon it, Hag. 1.6, 9.

5. There are sundry virtues to be exercised in the right and religious
performance of the duties of our callings: As,

(1) Knowledge, and judgment, whereby we are enabled to discern between good,
and evil, right, and wrong, without which we walk in darkness, and shall be
apt to commit many errors.

(2) Affiance in God, whereby we cast our selves upon his promise, and
providence in the use of lawful means: as Psalm. 37.5. Commit thy way to the
Lord, trust in him, and he shall bring it to pass. For which end remember
that* God takes care of the fowls, clothes the lilies, Mat. 6.25, 28.

(3) Get and use a good conscience both toward God and man, as Paul, Act.
24.16. Heb. 13.18. this willl keep us from all secret sins, and crafty
conveyances, whereby we are naturally apt to wrong our neighbors for our
private advantage.

(4) We must get contentation, being in all things contented with Gods good
pleasure, judging that condition best wherein he has placed us, indifferently
welcoming poverty, or riches, prosperity or adversity, gain or loss, because
they are sent of God, Phil. 4.12. If we get this, we shall not be discontented
with the baseness of our callings, nor envy others their great preferments,
their less labor, and more gains, etc. It will also keep us from base
covetousness, knowing that godliness is the greatest gain, 1 Timothy 6.6. Hence,
Heb. 13.5.

(5) We must possess our souls with patience, which we have need to do,
considering that we are daily subject to many crosses, and miscarriages which
would otherwise discourage us from going on.

(6) We must have our hearts replenished with thankfulness to God being always
ready, when we observe his love in blessing our labors, to render him the
praise of all, Gen, 32.10. Not sacrificing to our own nets, as Hab. 1.16. But
seeing all comes from God, to return all praise to God, 1 Cor. 4.7.

(7) We must perform the duties of our calling with alacrity, and
cheerfulness, doing it heartily as to the Lord, Col. 3.23, 24. who will reward
our labors with an heavenly inheritance: and this will make all our labors
more easy, and to be more acceptable to God.

(8) We must observe justice in all the duties of our callings, doing nothing
in them but what may advance our neighbors good as well as our own, 1 These.
4.6. dealing with others as we would that they should deal with us.

Mr. Downams Guide to Godliness.

CHAP. XXIV. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about our holy Calling, or
Vocation.
Quest. OF how many sorts is the Calling of God?

Answ. First, the particular calling, which is to serve Heb. 5.4. Romans 1.11.

Secondly, the general calling which is to serve God

Quest. Of how many sorts is this general Calling?

A^sw. 1. External. 2. Internal. 3. Both external and internal.

Quest. What is the external Calling?

Answ. Its the work of Gods grace in his Word offering Christ, and calling upon
all sorts of men to reform their ways, and to receive Christ, and to yield
obedience to the Will of God, with promise of salvation if they obey.

Quest. What is the inward calling?

Answ. Its the action of God both by his Word and Spirit, calling out his Elect
by name particularly, and persuading them to separate from the world, and
receive the Covenant of Gods grace in Christ, and to devote themselves to
holiness of life.

Quest. Why is our conversion termed our calling?

Answ. First, because the means whereby God works upon us, ordinarily

Secondly, because through the mighty working of the Spirit of Christ, the

Thirdly, because God would hereby note unto us the easiness of the work, he

Quest. But how may our effectual calling be discerned, seeing wicked men may
be affected with the Word?

Answ. It may be discerned by the effects of it, whereof some appear
immediately, other some a longer time after.

Quest. What are those effects?

Answ. First, a true sight of, and willing confession of our sinne-guiltinesse,
joined with a detestation of all sin, and dislike of our ways which are not
good.





Romans 8.28.

Joel 2.32.



Quest. Wherein does Gods wonderful mercy appear in our calling?

Answ. By the consideration of the things whereunto we are called, which are,
1. To his mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2.9. 2. To the fellowship of his Son Jesus
Christ, 1 Cor. 1.9. 3. To a wonderful liberty from the servitude of sin, Satan,
the world, and the ceremonial Law, Gal. 5.13. 4. To the grace of Christ, Gal.
1.6. 5. To an estate of immunity, and free pardon, Romans 5.31. 6. To all safety,
Isa. 41.1, 2, 3. Romans 8.28. 7. To Christ's glorious Kingdom, 2 These. 2.14. 1
These. 2.12. 2 Pet. 1.3. 1 Pet. 5.10.


Quest. How may we walk worthy of our calling?

Answ. First, if we be humble, and not wise in our own conceits, Romans 11.25,
30, 31.



1. Because its no common favor, but a special grace bestowed upon us: For no
man comes to Christ, but whom the Father draws, Joh. 6.44.

2. God has done it without respect to our works, or desert on our part, 2 Timothy 1.9.

3. Because of the means, and manner of our calling: all the three persons of
the Trinity concur in it, and its an holy calling, 2 Timothy 1.9.

4. Because of the privileges to which we are called: as to be sons, and
heirs with Christ, 1 Cor. 1.7. to a Kingdom and glory, 1 These. 2.12. 2 These.
2.14.

5. Because Gods gifts and calling are without repentance, Romans 11.29. Isa. ^4.
7, etc. Jam. 1.17.

Tit. 3.8. Its the end of our calling, Luke 1.74, 75.

Isa. 29.23, 24.

Ephesians. 4.11, etc.

Quest. Why should we be so solicitous to know our calling?

Answ. First, because it instates us into all the promises of God.

Acts 15.9.

Ephesians. 6.16. Heb. 10.19, 20, 22. 1 John 5.4, 5.

Fourthly, it puts life into all our duties, both of Religion and
Righteousness, Gal. 5.6.

Fifthly, it opens a spring of grace in our hearts, John 7.38.

Mr. Byfield on Peter.

Quest. Does a Christian always know that he is called?

Answ. Sometimes a Christian staggers a little, either not being an experienced
Christian, or through sight of corruptions and tentations: but setting these
aside, a Christian knows his calling, and will live by his Rules: for its not
only a calling, but it works a disposition: and therefore if we find it not,
we must attend upon the means of the Gospel, which is called the Kingdom of
Heav^n, and it will bring us into a good estate, and show us our estate also,
which being once made known to us, we may assure our selves it will remain with
us for ever; which also may be gathered from this, in that its an high calling,
and nothing can break any one link of that chain made by God, Romans 8. 29,
30.

Dr. Sibbs on Phil.

Quest. How may it be proved that a Christian may certainly know his vocation
or calling?

Answ. First, because its the Office of the Spirit of God, which the faithful
have received to certify them of those things, which God has freely bestowed
Cor. 2.12 Romans 8.15.

Secondly, Gods children are commanded to make their calling and election sure,
2 Pet. 1.10. neither is this a legal, but an Evangelical Precept.

Thirdly, the grace which they have received of God, has the nature and force
of an earnest, in respect of the inheritance that is promised them, Ephesians.

Fourthly, the certain knowledge of the grace of God bestowed upon us, is Pet.
1.6, 8.

Fifthly, a conscience purified from dead works, does necessarily infer a
certain Heb. 10.20. Romans 8.26. and 9.2.

Sixthly, this is expressly affirmed of the faithful, and that from such reasons
Cor. 13.5. 1 John 3.14. and 4* 16. and 5.20.

Quest. By what signs may this certainty of our vocation be confirmed to us?

Answ. First, By the constant inclination of our wills to God as to our
chiefest Psalm 119.57. For no man can place his chiefest happiness in the
fruition of God, except he be called out of the world, and converted from the
Idols which he had formerly set up in his heart.

Secondly, by a purpose and readiness of mind to hearken to God in all things,
Sam. 3.10. Act. 9.6. Psa. 40.8, 9. For hereby we answer to the Call of God.
Psa. 26.7, 8.

Thirdly, By an earnest longing after the Word of God, 1 Pet. 2.2. for by this
Word Pet. 1.23.

Fourthly, By our sincere love to them who are begotten to God by the same Joh.
3.41.

Quest What means are we to use that we way be made partakers of this holy
calling?

Ans. Though God is many times found of those that sought him not, yet there
are several duties to be performed by us ordinarily, if we will be made
partakers of this heavenly calling: as.

1. We must prize Gods word above all earthly treasures, Psa. 119.14. For none
will seek the Kingdom of God till he under-valew all things in comparison of
it Mat. 10.37. Luke 14.26.

2. We must bestow our principal care, and labor in the attaining of it, Joh.
6.27. Pro. 2.4. and 8.17. the reason is because that esteem can never be solid,
and serious, which has not endeavors added to it.

3. We must with all diligence, and care apply our selves to the use of those
means which God has sanctified to communicate his grace to us by, Pro. 1.34.
we must wait, as the impotent did at the pool of Bethesda, Joh. 5.3, 4, 7. and
the reason is, because God who is the author of grace, has appointed, and
makes effectual those means, whereby he will convey his grace to us.

4. Yea, we must set such a rate upon them that we must be content to sell all
to purchase this pearl, Pro. 23.23. Mat. 13.43, 45. For though God requires
nothing of us, but freely bestows life upon us, Isa. 45.1.2. yet we ought to
forsake all unlawful things in act, and all natural good things in affection,
and disposition, that we may get the grace of God.

Quest. What Motives may stir us up to embrace the calling of God?

Answ. First, If we seriously consider who it is that calls us, Its the
omnipotent God, to whom we are bound to hearken in all things, though we Know
not what will follow Heb. 11.8.

Pet. 5.10. Ephesians. 1.13.

Act. 26.18. Luke 3.7.

Romans 8.10. 2. Cor. 5.20. and truly we are desperately hardened if such
goodness will not work upon us, as, 1 Samuel 24.17, 18, 19.

Cor. 1.26.

Mat. 22.7, 8. Luke 4.24.

Pro. 1.24. etc.

Ames. Cas. Consc.

Quest, How else may our vocation, or calling be described?

Answ. Its an effect of Gods election, whereby Christ, God and man, does by his
Kingly authority call, and invite us whilst we live here unto the participation
of the inestimable benefit of our Redemption, that thereby we may attain unto
life everlasting.

Quest. How manifold is this calling?

Answ. 1. Its twofold. 1. Common and general, whereby all indifferently, good
and bad, elect and reprobate, are outwardly invited by the Ministry of the Word
to embrace the benefit of Redemption wrought by Christ: This is ineffectual to
reprobates, because they refuse to come, when invited to the Kings Supper, Luke
14.24.

follows that near union whereby we being ingrafted into his body, mystically
do become his members, and he our head, Mat. 22.3, 8. Romans 8.30. Act. 13.48.
Joh. 6.45. Act. 16.14.

Quest. What are the parts of our effectual calling?

Answ. First. Our separation from the world, of which formerly we were true
Joh. 15.19. Ephesians. 2.19. and this he does, not for any merit of ours, but of his
free grace, Jsa. 65.1. Ephe. 2.1.3.12. 1 Cor. 6.11. 1 Pet. 4.3. Isa. 53.6. 2 Timothy 1.9.

Secondly, that reciprocal donation, whereby God the Father gives Christ, Isa.
9.6. John 3.16. Romans 8.32. John 17.6. and 10.29.

Thirdly, the union and communion which is betwixt Christ and Gods Elect, Ephesians.
4.15, 16. and 5.30. John 15.1. Ephesians. 2.20, 21, 22. 1 John 4.13. John 6.54.

Quest. What is the means of our effectual calling?

Answ. First, on Gods part, the preaching of the Word, which is made effectual

Secondly, the means on our part, is the saving hearing of the Word,

Quest. What necessity is there of our effectual calling?

Answ. First, before our effectual calling, we are no true members of the Ephesians.
5.23, 25. Acts 2.47.

Secondly, if we be not truly called, we are not truly justified, nor
sanctified, Romans 8.30.

Thirdly, if we be not thus called, we cannot come to Christ, nor communicate

Quest. But why should we be so careful in attending upon the Word.

Answ. First, because the Ministry of the Word is Gods Ordinance, instituted
Ephesians. 4.11, 12. neither does he ordinarily use any other means for our Calling
and Conversion. Hence Philip was sent to the Eunuch, Acts 8. Ananias to Paul,
Acts 9. Peter to Cornelius, Acts 10.5, 6.

Secondly, its God himself, who speaks by the mouths of his Ambassadors, Cor.
5.20. and 4.7. Jerem. 1.9. Luke 10.16.

Thirdly, the titles which are given to the Word, may strongly move us to
attend upon the same. Its called the Ministry of reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5.18.
the Gospel of Peace, Ephesians. 6.15. the Word of grace, Acts 14.3.18.32. the Word of
Life, Phil. 2.16. Acts 13.26. the Word of salvation: the Kingdom of God, Mat.
13.44. by which we are brought into the Kingdom of grace and glory. Heavenly
seed, 1 Cor. 4.15. whence Ministers are called spiritual Fathers, 1 Cor. 3.2.
Its milk for Babes, and strong meat for men, Heb. 5.12. Its a rule for our
lives, Deuteronomy. 5.32. Jos. 1.8. A Lamp to our feet, etc. Psalm. 119.105. the Sword
of the Spirit, Ephesians. 6.17.

Luke 1.79. Mat. 5.14. Acts 13.47.

Ephesians. 2.8. Heb. 11.6. John 1.12. and 3.16, 18. Romans 10.17. 1 Timothy 4.16.

Quest. But if once we be converted, what need we hear so often?

Ans. First, neglect of Gods Word is a manifest sign that we are not truly
converted, John 8.47. and 10.3, 4, 27. they which have grace cannot but be
ravished with the excellency of the Word.

Amos 8.11, 12.

to teach, to reprove, etc. that the man of God may be perfect, etc. 2 Timothy
3.16. 2 Cor. 14.3. therefore with David, we should desire to dwell in the house
of God, Psalm. 27.4.

Mr. Downhams Christian Warfare.

Quest. Whether is not our Vocation or Calling all one with our Sanctification?

Answ. No: For 1. Our Vocation is before Justification, Romans 8.30. but
Sanctification is not before Justification: therefore they are not the same.

These. 4.7. therefore its not all one with it.

Jer. 3.22. Now faith is no part of Sanctification strictly taken, because its
the means and instrument of our Justification and Sanctification, Acts 26.18.
Hence our hearts are said to be purified by faith, Acts 15.9. Gal. 2.20. John
5.24. we pass from death to life by faith, therefore its no part of our
spiritual life, as faith comes by hearing, and therefore hearing is no part of
Faith: so Justification comes by Faith, and therefore its no part of
Sanctification.

Quest. What is the nature of the Call of God?

Answ. Concerning this Call, I shall lay down these Propositions.



John 20.31. 1 Cor. 1.21. with 26. The Spirit indeed inwardly accompanies the
voice of the Gospel, but now none are called by the immediate voice of the
Spirit without the Gospel, or by the immediate testimony of the Spirit,
breathed out of free grace without the Word, Ephesians. 1.12, 13.

Thirdly, this voice of the Gospel, is the voice of God in Christ, or the Romans
1.6. John 5.29. 2 These. 2.12, 13. Its called Christ's Call, Heb. 3.1. because
Christ takes (as it were) the written Word in his own lips, and thereby pierces
through the ears to the heart, through all the noise of fears, sorrows,
objections against believing, and makes it to be heard as his voice.

Fourthly, the thing that Christ calls us unto, is, to come to him: Christ will
Mat. 11.27. Jer. 3.7, 22. and 4.1. He calls for us to come and possess his
fullness, Luke 14.17. 1 Cor. 1.9.

Fifthly, this Call to Come, is all one for substance with the offer of Christ,

1. A Command to receive Christ, as present and ready to be given, 1 John
4.23. 2. Persuasion and entreaty, to come and accept of this offer, 2 Corinthians.
5.19, 20. 3. A Promise of the thing offered if we will receive it.
Sixthly, this Call or Offer has three special qualifications.

1. Its inward as well as outward: For thousands are outwardly called, which
yet never come, because they want the inward Call, John 6.45. He that has
heard and learned of the Father comes to me, Hos. 2.14.

2. Its a particular Call, Mar. 16.15. there is a general Call, and offer of
grace to every one: but when the Spirit applies generals to particulars
particularly, this makes the Call particular, Isa. 43.1. John 12.5.

3. Its effectual as well as inward and particular, Luke 24.23. Compel them to
come in, John 10.16. Its a calling out of purpose, Romans 8.28. Mat. 9.12, 13. 2 Chronicles. 30.10, 11.

Quest. Wherein does the necessity of this Call appear?

Answ. First, no man should come unless first called. For what has any

Secondly, no man would come without the Lords Call, Mat. 20.6, 7. No man has
hired, or called us. There must be an effectual Call to bring men home, Isa.
55.5.

3. No man could come unless called, John 6.44. unless the Father draw by
this Call. For Romans 11.32. we are shut up under belief.

Quest. How is this Call a ground of faith?

Answ. First, its the ground by which, or wherefore it rests upon the Promise:

Secondly, the fullness and plenteous riches of mercy, and this gives great
encouragement Psalm. 130.7, 8.

Thirdly, the preciousnesse and sweetness of mercy, makes the soul exceedingly
Psalm. 36.6, 7. and to disesteem all things to enjoy it: But when to all this,
God sends a special command to come in, and to take mercy, and that for no
other reason, but because its commanded, this puts an end to all fears and
discouragements, and the soul answers, as Jer. 3.22. Behold, we come, etc.

Mr. Shepherds Sound Believer.

Quest. What are the parts of inward Calling?

Answ. First, the enlightening the mind to understand the principles of
Reprobate, yet its the foundation of the rest, without which there is no
effectual Calling.

Lydia's was,) when we believe every thing particularly to belong to us, and so
the Promise of salvation amongst the rest.



Quest. What are the fruits of this effectual Calling?

Answ. First, when a man goes about the works of the same, and labors to walk
worthy of it in an holy life.

Paul accounted all but dung in comparison of the knowledge of Christ
crucified: and the things which he highly esteemed before his Calling,
afterward he made no reckoning of them.



Quest. What are the marks of effectual Calling?

Answ. They are either Negative, or Affirmative. First, Negative. As 1. Not to
hear the Word, and that diligently. 2. Nor to hear joyfully. 3. Nor to reform
many things, as Herod. 4. Nor to do some choice duties: as Ananias and Saphira.
Secondly, Affirmative.


1. To seek above all to be at peace with God, and to have his Spirit to assure
us of everlasting salvation: not to serve the times, but above all to be
assured of Gods favor.

2. That we hate unfeignedly all evil: but especially the evils of the times,
and of our natures.

3. To affect heartily all good: but especially those good things which the
world and times disregard, and that our selves are most untoward unto.

Mr. Rogers on Pet.

Quest. What other signs are there of our effectual Calling?

Answ. First, if we be effectually called, it supposes that we are chosen, and
singled out from others in the world: and whom God calls he qualifies: when he
called Saul to be King, he gave him a Kingly heart: so if God call us to his
heavenly Kingdom, he will give us holy, Kingly, and heavenly hearts and minds.

Nehemiah, Shall such a man as I do thus? speak thus? think thus?

David, What is man that thou should be mindful of him?

Thou art my son, the heart answers, Thou art my God. Behold I come quickly,
(says Christ,) Even so come Lord Jesus, says thy heart.



Dr. Sibbs on Phil.

CHAP. XXV. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Cares of the World,
Quest. HOw many-fold are the Cares of the World?

Answ. Twofold. 1. Regular. 2. Irregular.

First, Care is then regular. 1. When it has a

Secondly, when the means of procuring that Romans 3.8. Contrary in Ahaziah, 2
Kings 1.2. Yea, Saint Austine is peremptory, that if it were possible by an
officious lie to compass the redemption of the whole world, yet so weighty and
universal a good must rather be let fall then brought about by the smallest
evil.

Thirdly, when the manner of doing it is good, and that is

1. When the care is moderate, Phil. 4.5, 6.

2. When it is with submission to the will and wisdom of God, when with David,
we can resolve not to torment our hearts with needless and endless projects,
but to roll our selves upon Gods protection, 2 Samuel 15.25, 26. So 1 Samuel 3.18.
Act. 21.12, 14. Contrary, 2 King. 6.33. and in this respect care is not a
vexation but a duty, 1 These. 5.8. Prove. 6.8. Care irregular is a cutting,
dividing, distracting care, against which we should strive for these reasons.

First, irregular cares are superfluous, and improper to the ends which we
direct (Happiness) which men, laboring to find in the creature where it is
not, do instead there of find nothing but trouble, and vexation: But even to
those lower ends which the creatures are proper and suitable to. For to us
properly belongs the industry, and to God the care: unto us the labor, and use
of the means, but to God the blessing and success of all, 1 Cor. 3.6. Luke
12.25. 1 Pet. 5.7. Psalm 55.22. Matthew. 6.32. we should therefore learn to
cast our selves upon God; and that

1. In faith depending upon the truth of his promises, Heb. 13.5. as Dan. 3.17.
2 Samuel 30.6. 2 Chronicles. 14.11, 12. and 16.9. the contrary grieves God, Numb.
14.11. Ps. 78.19, 20. and 106.24. and it proceeds from this, that we measure
God by our selves: that we conceive of his power only by those issues and
ways of escape, which we are by our own wisdoms able to forecast: and when we
are so straightened that we can see no way to turn, there we give over trusting
God, as if our sins were greater then could be forgiven, o^ our afflictions
then could be removed: the best way therefore to establish our hearts in all
estates, is to have the eye of Faith fixed upon Gods power, and to consider
what he says, Isa. 55.8, 12. So Hab. 3.3, 18. Zach. 4.6, 10. Hos. 11.9. 2 Chronicles. 20.6, 1^. Ezekiel. 37.3.

2. By prayer, which is a maine remedy against careful thoughts, Phil. 4.5, 6,
7. so we see in Hannah, 1 Samuel 1.7, 10, 18. So, 1 Chronicles. 29.9. Deuteronomy. 12.1^. and
28.47. Mal. 2.13. Isa. 38.14, 20. Hab. 3.2, 16, 18, 19.



1. In regard of their object, they are worldly cares, the cares of the men of
this world: therein we declare our selves to walk as the Gentiles, as if we had
no better a foundation of Contentment then the Heathen which know not God:
Hence, Ephesians. 4.17. Mat. 6.32. whereas we are taken out of the world, and
therefore must not be conformable to the world, nor bring forth the fruits of a
wordly spirit; but walk as a peculiar people that have heavenly promises, and
the grace of God to establish our hearts, Joh. 15.10. 1 Cor. 2.10. Romans 12.2.
Psalm. 4.3. Tit. 2.14. 1 Pet. 2.9. Illi terrena sapiant, qui promissa coelestia
non habent. Cyprian.

2. They are sinful in regard of their causes, which are principally two.

1. Inordinate lust, or coveting, the running of the heart after covetousness.
2. Distrust of Gods providence; for those desires which spring from lust, can
never have faith to secure the heart in the expectation of them, Jam. 4.3.
3. They are sinful (...) their effects. For, 1. They are murdering cares, 2
Cor. 7.10. they work sadness, suspicions, uncomfortablenesse, and at last
death. 2. They are choking cares, Mat. 13.22. they take off the heart from the
Word, and thereby make it unfruitful. 3. They are adulterous cares, Jam. 4.4.
they steal away the heart from God, and set us at enmity against him.


Quest. How may we arm our selves against them?

Answ. First make the creature no vexing creature: For which end

1. Pray for convenience: for that which is suitable to thy mind, not to thy
lusts, but to the abilities of thy mind. Labor ever to suit thy occasions to
thy parts, and thy supplies to thy occasions. A ship, out of greediness,
overladen with gold, will be in danger of sinking, though the capacity of the
sides be not a quarter filled: on the other side, fill it to the brim with
feathers, and it will still toss up and down for want of ballasting: so is it
in the lives of men, some have such greedy desires that they think they can run
through all sort^ of businesses, and so never leave loading themselves till
their hearts sink and be swallowed up of worldly sorrow and security in sin:
Others set their affections on such trivial things, that though they should
have the fill of their desires, their minds would still be as floating, and
unsettled as before: therefore if thou live in the calmest times, 1. Fill not
thy self only with light things, and such are all things in this world of
themselves: but get thy heart ballasted with faith in Gods promises, love, and
fear of his name, a foundation of good works, and then whatever becomes of thy
other loading, thy ship it self shall be safe at last: thou shall be sure in
the greatest tempest to have thy life for a prey. 2. Consider the burden of thy
vessel; as all ships are not of equal capacity, so all men have not the same
abilities: some have such a measure of grace as enables them with much wisdom,
and improvement to manage such an estate, as would puff up another with pride,
sensuality, superciliousnesse, and forgetfulness of God: Some again are fitted
to some kind of employments, not so to others, and in these varieties of state
every man should pray for that which is most suitable to his disposition and
abilities, which may expose him to fewest tentations, or at least make him most
serviceable in the body of Christ, and bring most glory to his Master. Hence,
Prove. 30.8, 9. Mat. 6.11. Give us our daily bread.


2. Labor to get Christ into thy ship: he will check every tempest, and calm
every vexation that grows upon thee. When thou considerest that his truth and
person, and honor is embarked in the same vessel with thee, thou may assure
thy self that either he will be thy Pilot in the ship, or thy plank in the sea
to carry thee safe to land. Say, if I suffer in his company, and as his member,
he suffers with me, and then I may triumph that I am any way made conformable
to Christ my head. If I am weak in body, Christ my head was wounded: If weak in
mind, Christ my Head was heavy unto death: if I suffer in my estate, Christ
my head was poor: If in my name, he was called Beelzebub, 2 Cor. 8.9. Mat.
12.24. Again, have I a great estate? this takes away all the vexation that I
have Christ with me: his promise to sanctify it, his wisdom to manage it, his
Glory by it to be advanced, his Word by it to be maintained: his Anointed ones
by it to be supplied: his Church to be by it repaired: in one word, his poverty
to be by it relieved.

3. Cast out thy Jonah, every sleeping, and secure sin that brings a tempest on
thy ship, and vexation to thy spirit. Examine thy self impartially, and when
thou have found it out, though thy choicest pleasure, or chiefest profit, yet
cast it out in an humble confession unto God, in an hearty and willing
restitution to men, in opening thy close and contracted bowels to those that
never yet enjoyed comfort from them, then shall quietness arise to thy soul,
etc.

4. To remove the vexation of the creature, keep it from thy spirit, suffer it
not to take up thy thoughts and inward man: These things are not thy business,
but thy accessories, and a man's heart should be on the first, not on the
latter, Psalm. 62.10. when the creature has raised a tempest of vexation in
your souls, pour out your corruptions by confession, abate your lusts, and the
provisions of them, live by faith, and say; It Is the Lord, let him do what
seems good to him: The Lord gives, the Lord takes, Blessed be his Name.

Thirdly, use the creatures as vexing things: For which end

1. Let not earthly things bear rule over thy affections, least they emasculate

2. Be armed when thou touchest or medlest with them. Armed against the lusts,
and against the tentations that arise from them. Get faith to place thy heart
upon better promises: enter not upon them without prayer to God, that since
thou art going amongst snares, he would carry thee through with wisdom and
faithfulness, and teach thee how to use them as his blessings, and as
instruments of his glory. Make a Covenant with thy heart, be jealous of it
least it be surprised, or bewitched with sinful affections.

3. Touch them gently: Do not hug them, love, and dote upon them, nor grasp
them with adulterous embraces: The love of money is the root of mischief, and
is enmity against God, 1 Timothy 6.10. Jam. 4.4. 1 John 2.15.

3. Use them for hedges and fences to relieve the Saints, to make friends of
unrighteous Mammon, and to defend the Church of Christ. By no means have them
in thy field, but only about it: mingle it not with thy corn, lest it choke all.

5. Use them as Gideon, for weapons of just revenge against the enemies of Gods
Church to vindicate his truth and glory; and then by being wise and faithful in
a little, thou shall be ruler over much, etc. See Dr. Reynolds.

Object: But I should not take so much care were it not for my children?

Answ. Paul says, 1 Cor. 7.29. Let those that are married, be as though they
were not: meaning in regard of this scraping of wealth together by unlawful
means, or in regard of readiness to do works of mercy. God has promised to be
a Father of the fatherless. Some go to Hell themselves to make their children
rich: but God requires no such thing at our hand: Therere is a moderate care
indeed, as 1 Timothy 4.8. He that cares not for his own, etc. but we must not make
this a pretense to excuse our sinful and immoderate cares: what ability the
creature has to help, is from God, and when the creature is taken away, God is
where he was. Dr. Sibs.

Quest. Why ought we not to be careful about worldy things?

Answ. First, because these things are good in a very mean degree; they cannot
breed Contentment, nor make a man happy.





Indeed we must have callings, and we must be painful in them: So Adam had
before and after his fall: As Solomon commends diligence, so he speaks against
idleness, Prove. 10.4. He sends the sluggard to the Ant for forecast, Prove.
6.6. Joseph in times of plenty laid up for times of want, Genesis 41.48. therefore
it is not the care, but the excess that is forbidden.

Mr. Rogers on Pet.

CHAP. XXVI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Charity.
Quest. WHat is Charity?

Answ. It Is that affection of love which moves us to hold our neighbors dear,
and to desire, and seek their good in every thing which is dear unto them, and
that for Christ's sake, according to the will of God, 1 Cor. 13.4, etc. where we
have the properties of charity largly described; and it must be showed by
beneficence.

Quest. What is beneficence?

Answ. It is with a bountiful heart, and hand to do good to all, who in any
kind whatsoever need our help, by our riches, labor, care, counsel,
providence, or howsoever: So that it extends it self to all good works, as
building of Schools, and Colleges, maintaining the Ministry, and Gods worship,
erecting of Hospitals, allowing yearly Pensions to Parishes, and corporations
for relief of the poor: Or if we want ability to do these, then by counselling
those that want it, by being eyes and feet to the blind and lame, Act. 9.39.
Job 31.16, etc.

Quest. Are these duties then required of all?

Answ. Yea, Heb. 13.16. they are numbered amongst the fruits of the Spirit, Gal.
5.22. and are joined with love and faith, 1 Timothy 6.17, 18.

Quest. Who are the object of beneficence?

Answ. First, all men, 1 These. 5.15. yea, it must extend to our enemies, Prove.
Mat. 5.44, 45. Luke 6.32, 33.

Secondly, yet chiefly to the household of faith; Gal. 6.10. Christ Matthew.
25.33. So David, Psalm. 16.3. Ephesians, c. 1.15.

Quest. What are the properties of benificence?

Answ. First, it must be liberal and bountiful: Da multum multis. we must do
good to many; as we sow our seed plentifully, 2 Cor. 9.6. Prove. 11.24, 25. Non
qui habet, and servat, sed qui impertit est dives, and impertio, non possessio
divites facit. Clem. Alex. Not he that has wealth, and keeps it, but he that
bestows it is rich, etc. otherwise he puts it into a broken bag, Hag. 1.6. Its
a duty required by God, Deuteronomy. 15.11. Job 31.16, 17.

Eccl. 9.10. Tit. 3.1. 2 Cor. 9.7. Romans 12.8. Prove. 11.25. 2 Cor. 8.12. Deuteronomy.
15.10.

Quest. How does this cheerfulness show it self?

Answ. First in countenance, which adds a grace to a good deed. Dat been, dat
multum, qui dat cum munere vultum. Where the eye of the giver tells the
receiver that its a token sent him from a loving heart, Prove. 22.9.

Secondly, In our words, when we speak comfortably to the party to whom we do
good. Quando adjicimus bona verba, bonis rebus, 2 Cor. 9.5.

Thirdly, in the action. (1) When a man does good speedily and readily.
Beneficentia est virtus quae moram non patitur. It dislikes all delays: Omnis
benignitas properat. Seneca. All goodness is quick of hand, and swift of foot.
Bis dat qui cito dat. Et qui moratur, neganti proximus est. He that delays a
benefit is next door to him that denies. Proprium est libenter facientis cito
facere. S^n. Its the property of him that gives willingly to give speedily,
Isa. 21.14. We must prevent men's suits with such a readiness, as God does,
Psalm. 21.2, 3. Nam illud beneficium jucundum, quod obviam venit. Sen. that
benefit is most delightful to the receiver, which stays not till he comes to
seek it, but meets him in the midst way, 2 Cor. 8.4.

(2) When at least we entertain the first motion; and if our benefit has not
found him out before he sued, yet at least let him find it when he sueth.
Atque etiam dum rogat, erogemus: Let us give him while he asks. Nam qui tarde
dedit, diu noluit. Sen. So Prove. 3.27. and 13.12. especially we must avoid
delays in giving, after we have granted the suit: For there is nothing more
distastful, then when we are forced to ask again, and find more difficulty in
the delivery then in the grant.

Benefacta benefactis pertegentes. Plaut. making one good deed an introduction
to another: Hence, 2 These. 3.13. 1 These. 5.15. 1 Cor. 15.58. Deuteronomy. 15.11. Gal.
6.9. hereby we imitate our heavenly Father; Yea, we must increase in doing good
that our last works may excel the first, as Rev. 2.19. for Mat. 26.11.

Ephesians, 4.28. Psalm. 112.5. Dat, non profundit. He gives but not wastes, that so
he may still give. Hence, 1 Cor. 16.1. Dabo egenti, sed ut ipse non egeam;
succurro perituro, sed ut ipse non peream. Sen.

non dat sed ditat: he relieves not his wants, but makes him rich: He that
gives less, non pa^perem sustentat, sed paupertatem. He cures not the disease,
but only gives some present ease.

Non est beneficium nisi quod ratione datur, quoniam ratio omnis honesti comes
est. Sen. It Is not a benefit which is not given with reason, because reason is
the guide, and companion of all virtuous actions, Eccl. 11.1, 2. cast thy bread
upon the waters, not water, 1 Timothy 6.18.

Quest. Who should be the object of our bounty?

Answ. The poor, Luke 14.12. they are the ground in which this seed is to be
sown if we expect an harvest of happiness; they are the Bankers to whom we
must deliver Gods talents if we will be faithful; they are Gods factors to whom
we must deliver our goods, and then God himself will acknowledge the debt, and
will surely pay with advantage.

Not canting companions, lazy lossels, sturdy rogues, profuse prodigals. For, 2
These. 3.10, 12. such should not eat; except in case of extremity: and then non
homini, sed humanitati, not to the person, but to the common nature of
mankind: But

To the honest labourer, and poor hous-keeper, who either, through the
greatness of their charge, or deadness of trade, crosses, losses sickness,
etc. are not able to get their bread, or the blind, and maimed, the aged, and
decrepid: Weak widows, or young orphans. Lev. 25.35. Pars sacrilegii est, res
pauperum dare non pauperibus. It Is a kind of sacrilege to give the poors
portion to those which are not poor. Tunpissimum g^nu^ perd^ndi est inconsulta
donatio. Unadvised giving is the worst kind of loosing: Yet we must not be
overscrupulous in making our choice: we must not be so busy in examining their
estate, and desert, that we can find no leisure to relieve their wants: Hence,
2 These. 3.13. Mat. 10.41. and 25.40.

Quest. What are the true causes from whence this charity arises?

Answ. First, Faith, which formalizes all the Christians actions, and mainly
Heb. 11.6. Romans 14.23.

Secondly, obedience to God because he has commanded it, therefore such Mat.
6.2.

Thirdly, Love unfeigned: Hence, 2 Cor. 8.4. Its called (...), because given
Cor. 13.3. such love not God, 1 John 3.17. and this must arise, 1. From our
love to God, 2 Cor. 8.5. 2. From our love to our brethren, 2 Cor. 9.5.

Fourthly, mercy, and compassion: when we relieve them as fellow members, Isa.
58.10. 1 John 3.17. Its required, Hos. 6.6. Heb. 13.3. Job 31.17, 18. such are
blessed, Prove. 14.21. 2 Cor. 8.9. else all our pity is unprofitable, Jam. 2.15,
etc. Hence, 1 John 3.18. Let us not love in word or tongue, but in deed and
truth.

Quest. How may we best perform these works of mercy?

Answ. If we not only take notice of the wants by report, but by often visiting
the poor, and so being eyewitnesses ^f their wants, and miseries, Jam. 1.27.
Mat. 25.36, 43. and that for these reasons.

1. By visiting the poor, we shall be the better enabled to make a good choice,
and to discover who are truly poor from those who are counterfeits: as also,
who are religious and industrious in their callings, from the profane and idle
drones.

2. Hereby we shall be the better enabled to fit our alms to their necessities,
both in respect of the proportion, and also the special kind of their wants,
whereby the benefit will be much increased, Psalm 112.5. and 41.1.

3. It would prevent their straggling abroad to beg necessaries, which is
forbidden, Deuteronomy. 15.4. and such as neither care for house or home, like idle
drones, would find little relief, unless they earn it with the sweat of their
brows.

4. It would provoke us to be the more compassionate, when we see their small
provision, hungry fare, thin clothes, and hard lodging: children crying for
hunger, and parents crying because they have not food for them, etc. their eye
would affect the heart.

5. Hereby we may do them double good, by distributing spiritual as well as
temporal alms to them, instructing the ignorant, blaming the faulty,
admonishing, counselling and comforting them as God has comforted us, 2 Cor.
1.4. and our words will find more easy entrance into their hearts, when as
our good works have prepared the way.

6. By seeing the wants of our brethren, we shall be provoked to be thankful to
God for his goodness and bounty to us, in not only supplying our wants, but
enabling us to be helpful to others.

7. Hereby we shall learn temperance, and sobriety in the use of Gods
blessings, and not to abuse them to superfluity and excess, seeing many as
good as our selves do want them? but to husband them frugally that we may be
the more able to relieve others.

8. Hereby we shall have occasion given us to prepare against the day of
affliction and want, which may befall us as it has done others.

9. When we visit the poor we visit Christ in them, and he accounts it as done
to himself, Mat. 25.40.

Quest. What are the right ends of giving alms?

Answ. First, the principal end is Gods glory, which should be the chiefest
motive to all Christian duties, Mat. 5.16. 2 Cor. 9.13.



Quest. What must we give?

Answ. We must give only that which is our own, by just and lawful means
derived to us; therefore to be liberal of that which is not our own, is to take
goods from the right owners and to give them to others at our own pleasure,
which is no better then plain theft in the sight of God: If the hire of an
harlot, and price of a dog might not be consecrated to God, Deuteronomy, 23.18. then
may we not offer that which we have gotten by stealth, deceit, oppression, etc.
Isa. 61.8. we must deal justly and love mercy, Mic. 6.8. Hence, Eccles. 11.1.
Prove. 3.9. Isa. 58.7. 1 Cor. 16.2. The Civilians say, Bonus usus non justificat
injuste quaesita; the good use justifies not the unjust getting of goods: such
should rather be restored to the true owners, Luke 19.8. Quale est illud munus
quod alter cum gaudio accipit, alter cum Lachrymis amittit? Aug. Hence will
follow.

1. That its not lawful for one partner to give alms out of the common stock
without the consent of the other, except he set it on his own particular
account.

2. Its not lawful for him that is indebted more then he is able to pay, to
give alms, seeing he gives not his own, but another.

3. It Is not lawful for a man to give that which he has borrowed of another,
or that which is left in pawn with him, except in such things where the
property is altered with the use, as meat, money, corn, etc. then we may give,
when we purpose to make satisfaction by restoring the like to the owner.

Yet all these cases are to be understood with this exception: if the poor ^e
but in ordinary want; not in extreme necessity, and danger to perish for want
of relief, in which case all becomes common through his irresistible necessity,
Mat. 12.1, 3, 4. Deuteronomy. 23.24, 25. Yet even then we must resolve to our utmost
to restore to the owner those goods which we have thus employed.

Quest. What should be the quantity and measure of our alms?

Answ. This is not particularly determined in Scripture, because there are so
many circumstances which may alter the case that no certain rule could be
given; but its left to Christian prudence to give as occasion is offered, more
or less as he thinks good: Hence, 2 Cor. 8.7, 8. and 9.7. Yet in general this
rule must be observed: we must give bountifully, not with a niggardly hand, 2
Cor. 9.6. Deuteronomy. 15.11. Prove. 31.20. 2 Cor. 9.5. yet herein respect is to be had
to our own ability, keeping our cisterns full that our selves may drink of
them, and setting the overplus to run abroad, as Prove. 5.15, 16. Act. 11.29.
every one according to his ability sent, etc. 2 Cor. 8.13, 14. Yet in cases of
extreme necessity we must go beyond our ability, 2 Cor. 8.3. So Christ
commands, Luke 12.33. and 3.11. Act. 2.45. and 4.34, 35. In other cases we may
have two coats, Joh. 19.23. 2 Timothy 4.13.

Quest. What rule must be observed in the quality of our alms?

Answ. We must give to the poor things wholesome, cleanly, convenient, and
comfortable for the sustentation of their lives, avoiding two extremes.

1. Of such as give them such base, and sluttish food, as a dog will scarce
eat. Remember therefore that thou relievest not contemptible creatures, but
those that are of the same nature, etc. yea, in them we lend to the Lord, who
scorns our refuse, Mal. 1.13. we relieve Christ, and will we give him swill,
and swines meat, who nourishes our souls with his precious body and blood.

2. Of such as give them superfluous dainties: but we must feed them, not
pamper them with superfluities: Christ when he fed the multitude provided not
dainties, but multiplied the barley loaves and fishes. Utantur divites
superfluis, den^ paup^ribus necessaria. Aug. Let the rich enjoy their
superfluities, and let them relieve the poor with necessaries.

Quest. What persons ought to give alms?

Answ. All of any estate, when they meet with poorer then themselves; but
principally its the duty of rich men, Luke 16.9. 1 Timothy 6.17, 18. 2 Cor. 8.14.
1 John 3.17. yet not only of them: For he that has but a bare competency is
to give to them that want necessaries: and such as have only sufficient for
nature are bound to give to them who are in present extremity, unless the like
necessity be iminent to themselves: For we must love our neighbor as not above
our selves: Charity begins at home. Now that such must give may be proved by
Scripture, Luke 3.11. and 11.41. Ephesians. 4.28. By example: The poor widow, Mark
12.43. Macedonians, 2 Cor. 8.2. Apostles, Act. 3.6. Luke 8.3. with Joh. 12.6,
8. Its the way to have our little increased, Prove. 11.24. Luke 6.38. Besides,
the alms of the poor (though they give little) are as acceptable to God, as of
the rich, Deuteronomy. 15.11. 2 Cor. 8.12. God measures the deed by the will.
Quantitatem oblationis virtute offerentium determinavit. Chrysostom. As the poor
widows gift.

Quest. What persons may lawfully give alms?

Answ. None but such as are owners of the things given: Hence,

1. Its unlawful for servants to give of their Masters goods, unless he has
given them leave, either in particular, or general. Or unless in case of
extreme necessity in the absence of their governors, having a purpose to make
it known to them, resolving to restore out of their own what they have given in
case their Governors mislike it.

2. Its unlawful for children, under the government of their parents, or tutors
to give alms without the consent of their parents, or governors, either
expressed by words, or allowed by the continual custom of the family, except it
be out of their own allowance.

3. Its unlawful fot such as are not of sufficient age, or discretion to give
alms, because they may waste their estates, or give to unworthy persons for
want of discretion.

Quest. Whether is it lawful for the wife to give alms without the consent of
her husband?

Answ. In diverse cases it is lawful for her to do it: As

1. If he be a fool, or a madd man, and not able himself to manage his estate.

2. When as he is far absent, and so his consent cannot be asked, especially if
she conceive that if her husband were present, he would like of her doings.

3. When he has committed the administration of his household expenses to his
wife, his heart trusting in her.

4. When having a certain allowance made her by her husband, she spares
somewhat out of it to relieve others.

5. When she or her friends for her, have before marriage, over, and above her
dowry reserved something to be at her disposal.

6. When she gets something by her own labor, she may dispose of part of it to
charitable uses, if the Laws of the Country be not against it.

7. If the alms which she gives be but of small value, as bread, bear, cast
apparel, and such like.

8. If her husband be so basely miserable, as having much, he will part with
nothing; or if he be so wicked, that though he spend much vainly, and wickedly,
yet he will give nothing to those that want; or if to any, yet not to them that
fear God.

9. When its a received custom of the Country that the wives should give alms
to the relief of the poor.

Object. But the propriety of the goods being wholly in the husband, its theft
in the wife to give any part of them away without the consent of her husband,
either expressed, or implied?

Answ. If the case be so between man and wife, it were good for the woman not
to marry: Indeed it is granted, that as God has made them yoke-fellows, so she
must endeavor to persuade her husband to draw with her in all Christian
duties: for which end, she must use toward him all duty, respect, reverence,
loving and sweet behavior, that she may move him to love all goodness, at
least for her sake: she must also show such care, faithfulness and good
huswifery that the heart of her husband may trust in her, Prove. 31.11. Yet if
after all this her husband be a Nabal, that will neither be charitable himself,
nor consent that she shall be so; she may do it her self, only herein these
cautions are to be observed.

1. She must observe the former rules, and give discreetly, not exceeding her
husbands ability, the which if it be unknown to her, she must give sparingly,
and things of smaller value. For, Prove. 31.12. She must do him good, etc.

2. She must perform this duty with all meekness and humility of spirit, with
all reverence and due respect to her husbands authority, with acknowledgement
of her subjection in all things lawful, that she may win him by her Christian
carriage, 1 Pet. 3.1.

3. In the manner, she must so do it as not to give her husband any just cause
of offense, she must not usurp authority over him, 1 Timothy 2.10. nor cause the
word of God to be blasphemed, Tit. 2.5.

4. She must not disgrace her husband by publishing his faults: reporting her
Prove. 12.4. But for the further clearing of this point three things are to be
considered.

1. Its acknowledged that the husband has authority over his wife to rule and
govern her as her head, 1 Corinthians. 11.3, 8, 9. 1 Timothy 2.14. Genesis 3.16.

2. Yet the husbands government, and wives subjection must be in the Lord, Col.
3.18. Ephesians. 5.22. 1 Cor. 11.7. He bears the image of God, and she is to yield
obedience to him as unto God in all honest, lawful, and indifferent things. But
if he command what is forbidden, or forbid what is comman^ed, she is not to
obey him therein: Now works of mercy are enjoined, and therefore he may not
forbid them, or if he do, she may not obey.

3. Consider the communion which is between man and wife by reason of the bond
of marriage which extends both to their persons and goods: For their persons,
they are no longer twain, but one flesh: Hence they have not an absolute power
to dispose of their own bodies, but either over other, 1 Cor. 7 4. so also
there is such a communion in goods that there is no absolute prop^iety in
either of them, but it rests in them both: So, Genesis 31.16. All that God has
taken from our father is ours: not that it was their dowry, but through Gods
blessing on their husbands labor, it was theirs through the communion of
marriage. Hence at marriage the husband used to endow his wife with all his
worldly goods.

Object. But this communion of goods extends to her use only: For the
propriety is in the husband, and for the common use which the wife has in her
husbands goods, it only extends to meat, drink, apparel, and such necessaries
for her maintenance?

Answ. A husband indeed may dispose of, or alienate his estate without his
wives consent, except it be her jointure: But this he must do for the good of
his wife and family, not for their hurt, else he is a thief to her and them.

Again, if the wife may dispose of her husbands goods for her bodily use, may
she not much more do it for the good of her soul? and thereby lay up treasure
in heaven: Good works being enjoined to the wife, as well as to the husband, 1 Timothy 2.10. and therefore its better to obey God then man, Act. 5.29.

Object. But under the Law, if a wife made a vow, though of consecrating any
things to Gods service, yet the husband had power to disannul it?

Answ. Vows were of two sorts. 1. Of things absolutely commanded, and

2. I prove it further; because alms-deeds, and works of mercy are no less
Prove. 31.20. and not without good cause is it made the note of a gracious
woman, because ordinarily alms deeds are done out of household store, and
provision, the disposing whereof does more properly belong to the woman then to
the man, as the whole current of the chapter shows. So Paul would have younger
women marry and guide the house, 1 Timothy 5.14. the which when the husband allows
her to do, he honors his wife as he ought, 2 Pet. 3.7. and disgraceth her,
when he turns her out of this office: which he ought not to do, unless she
has forfeited her privilege, by her unjust and indiscreet abusing of it.

Genesis 2.18. therefore if he neglect religious and charitable duties, she must
not only persuade him to them, but if he still neglect, must do them her self
for him, lest the sin and punishment lie not only upon him, but upon her, and
the whole family, Zipporah, by performing a duty which belonged not to her, but
to her husband, diverted Gods judgment from him, Exodus 4.25. and Abigail saved
her husband and family by the like.



Matthew. 25.34. therefore she, as well as he must feed Christ in his members,
etc.

Abigail, 1 Samuel 25.18. of those godly women that ministered to Christ, Luke
8.3. and of that good woman, Pro. 31.20.



Ob. Yet this Doctrine is dangerous, because indiscreet women will abuse it, it
may be to the undoing of their husbands, and ruin of their estates?

Answ. Its but a carnal reason to think that evil will come by the discovery of
a religious truth, or though they should, let truth be maintained though the
inconveniences be never so great. Tbough one abuse a sword, yet all must not be
disarmed for that. Though the Gospel be to some a savor of death, yet must not
Ministers therefore forbear to preach it. Because some women will abuse this
Doctrine, yet they which are discreat and virtuous, must not therefore be kept
in ignorance of their duty, and have their consciences ensnared, and burdened
with that which is not sinful, yea, with that which is honest and commendable.
Many wives undo their husbands with their daintiness in fare, curiosity in
furnishing their houses, and costlinesse in their apparel, but few in doing
works of charity.

Quest. To whom are alms to be given?

Answ. Almsdeeds are to be extended only to the poor and needy, Deuteronomy. 15.11.
1 John 3.17. Ephesians. 4.28. 2 Cor. 8.14. Luke 3.11. Now these poor are of diverse
kinds, Christ reckons up six, Mat. 25.35. Hungry, thirsty, harbourlesse,
naked, sick, and poor prisoners. To which add, the oppressed and exiled, Isa.
58.6, 7. especially if they suffer for the constant confession of the truth.
Add also such as are indebted above their means, the lame, blind, aged,
decrepid, the poor Widow and distressed Orphans, etc. Isa. 58.6, 7. Nehem.
5.11. Luke 14.12. Jam. 1.27.

Quest. What order are we to observe in giving alms?

Answ. First, they which are in extreme necessity, and near perishing, are
first to be relieved, be they acquaintance or strangers: friends or foes, Mat.
5.42. Romans 12.23. Luke 6.30. yet if we cannot relieve all such, we are to
prefer our kindred and friends, and the godly in the first place. We must also
have respect to those, who by Providence are first cast upon us, who thereby
seem by God himself to be preferred before others, Luke 10.33.

1. Again, the whole Church and Commonwealth is to be preferred even before
our selves, if there be such a necessity: for its better that one member
perish, then that the whole be destroyed: therefore the Primitive Christians
sold all they had to relieve the common necessitys.

2. We must take care to provide necessaries for ou^ selves: For charity begins
at home: then for our second selves, our wives: then for our Parents. Contrary
reproved, Mar. 7.11, 12. then for our children, and the rest of the family 1 Timothy 5.8. then our spiritual kindred, except our kindred in the flesh be godly
also, and then they are to be preferred, Gal. 6.10. 1 John 3.17. Romans 12.13.
Mat. 10.41. and 25.40. So David, Psalm. 16.3. Then our Benefacto^s, to whom we
formerly have been beholding, 2 Cor. 8.14. Prove. 18.24. Then to our kindred in
the flesh, Genesis 29.13, 14. Then common friends and neighbors: For Prove. 27.10.
Better is a neighbor that is near, then a brother afar off: Then out
Countrymen, and strangers, Lev. 25.35. Romans 12.13. H^b. 13.2. Genesis 18.3. and
19.2. Isa. 58.7. Mat. 25.35. Deuteronomy. 15.7, 11. Then it must extend to our very
enemies, Romans 12.20. 2 Kings 6.22.

Quest. In what manner may we most conveniently distribute our alms?

Answ. Alms are either more public and common, or more private and particular.

First, in the former, our best course is to follow the Laws and Customs of

Secondly, for our private alms, we may give them to such poor, as upon

Quest. What may be thought of giving alms at our doors?

Answ. It cannot be condemned, till the good Laws made, be put in execution,
for the reformation of this disorder; yet with these cautions.

First, the whole stream of our charity must not run that way.

Secondly, we must give to such as are in apparent misery, as to the aged,
decrepid,

1. Because they which are truly poor, will by this means be neglected whilst
idle drones devour that which belongs to them.

2. Hereby the bold and impudent will often speed better then the modest and
shamefast.

3. Our alms shall by this means be distributed unequally; some having all,
and others none, neither can they be fitted to the quantity or quality of their
wants.

4. Such giving increases the number of idle vagrants, encoura^ing them to
continue in their wicked courses, without any fear of God, or subjection unto
men.

5. It crosses Gods Ordinance, who would not have a beggar in Israel, Deuteronomy.
15.4. Proclaiming both the negligence of Magistrates in not reforming this
disorder, and the hard-heartednesse of private persons, who through the want of
mercy and compassion, thrust their neighbors into such sinful courses.

6. Hereby those excellent Laws, which are made to prevent such disorders are
transgressed, and so the Christian Magistrate is justly offended.

Quest. What are we to judge of such alms as are given by men at their death?

Answ. They are to be esteemed and censured according to the quality and
condition of the persons by whom they are performed. For

1. Either they are done by such as according to their abilities, have
exercised such charity in their whose lives after their Conversion, out of
love, and obedience to God, and mercy toward men. Or

Secondly, out of self-love, vainglory, or servile fear, by such as have
utterly neglected them in their lifetime, and now think to make satisfaction
for their former neglect.

For the former we are to judge, that they proceed from their love to God and
their neighbors, being not content with what they have done in their lifetime,
but also take care that they be continued even after their death. Neither are
we to take exceptions, though the quantity now given does exceed all that they
have done in their lives, seeing herein they deal no otherwise with the poor
then with their own children and friends, upon whom they bestow more by Will,
then ever before they gave them; and its just that men should keep the largest
part of their goods while they live for their own maintenance, giving to the
poor what they can conveniently spare, and they are very charitable, if they
design a great part of their estate to religious uses, when as themselves shall
have no further use of it.

But for those who wholly neglect works of mercy in their lives, and think it
sufficient to give something at death, they are not absolutely to be condemned,
-lest hereby they take occasion to neglect both: Besides, these may be
after-fruits of their late repentance: They are also good to the receivers, and
for the givers, they are better then such as neither do good in life, nor
death: neither can they be taxed for doing them now, but because they did them
no sooner.









1. We may be stripped of our goods before death, and so have nothing to
bequeath then. 2. Death may surprise us suddenly, and give us no time to
dispose of our goods. 3. Our sickness may be such as may deprive us of our
understanding and memory, whereby we shall be disinabled to do it. 4. If we
make our Will beforehand, it may be concealed or made void by some trick in
Law, or unjust testimony of false witnesses, or not be performed through the
dishonesty of Executors, therefore do as Solomon advises, Prove. 3.27. and Gal.
6.10.




there is great cause of suspicion, that they proceed not from those right and
religious causes which set Christians on work to do them, but from sinister
ends, and worldly respects* which before prevailed not with them, till now they
see that they can keep them no longer.

Quest. How may the alms of Christians be differenced from those which are
done by worldlings?

Answ. First, they differ in the causes or fountain from which they arise:

First, the alms of Christians are the fruits of a lively and justifying
faith, and are done out of unfeigned love, and obedience unto God, and
therefore he is merciful, because he is assured that God is merciful to him,
and he gives small things to men, because he receives great things from God.

Secondly, they spring from charity and mercy toward the poor, because they
are members of Christ, and of the household of faith, or at least creatures of
God, of the same flesh with himself: whereas worldlings alms arise from
self-love, whereby he aims at some temporary good, to be derived to himself
thereby: or out of pride and vainglory to get praise, Mat. 6.1. etc. or out of
an opinion of merit to get a greater reward from God: or out of a servile fear
to escape the wrath of God here or hereafter, and therefore they profit
nothing, 1 Cor. 13.3.

Secondly, a Christian shows mercy, being inclined thereto by the motion

Thirdly, they differ in their ends: the end of a Christian being principally

Fourthly, they differ in the matter, and that

In regard of Propriety, a Christian gives liberally, out of his own store,
which God has bestowed upon him by his honest labor: the worldling gives out
of that which is other men's, and having raked much together, by lying, fraud,
injustice, oppression, etc. he gives out of it some small alms to make
satisfaction for his sins, and to stop the Cry of Conscience, that he may go
more quietly to Hell.

Fifthly, they differ in the quantity: a Ch^istian gives liberally, not only
out

Sixthly, they differ in the quality: a Christian gives things profitable and

Seventhly, they differ in the object and extent. A Christians mercy extends
Gal. 6.10. imitating God therein, Mat. 5.45. and David, Psalm. 16.3. But the
worldlings mercy extends usually to such as have some way deserved it, or that
may deserve it: or to kindred, or friends, therefore its rejected by God^punc;
Mat. 5.46, 47.

Eighthly, they differ in the manner of giving, and in the minds of the

1. A Christian gives with a plain, and honest heart, as Romans 12.8. seeking
therein only to please God, as Matthew. 6.3. But the worldling hunts after his
own profit, or praise, Matthew. 23.5. neither is it an act of mercy, but of
self-love.

2. A Christian does works of mercy with great humility, remembering that
whatsoever he thus gives to God, he has first received it from God: and so
confess that he does far less then his duty, and that he is sufficiently
rewarded, if his failings are pardoned: But the worldling is puffed up with
pride, thinking that hereby he has satisfied for his sins, merited heaven, and
made God his debtor: and hence he is so supercilious toward his poor brother,
that he makes his gift unacceptable.

3. A Christian does all with cheerfulness, as knowing that God loves a
cheerful giver, 1 Timothy 6.8. they proceed from an inward habit, and therefore
flow freely from him: This he shows by his pleasant countenance, sweet words,
speedy giving, etc. But the worldling does it churlishly, Dum manu dat, vultu
negat: whilst his hand gives, his looks denies: He gives with reproaches,
taunts, harsh expostulations, etc. not so much comforting the poor with his
gifts as afflicting his soul with his words.

Ninthly, they differ in time: For a Christian gives all his life long: But the
worldling for the most part only when death is approaching, when he can keep
his goods no longer.

Quest. How many ways must our charity be expressed?

Answ. Principally three ways. 1. In giving. 2. In forgiving. 3. In lending.

Quest. When must we forgive debts?

Answ. When we see our neighbors decayed in their estates, whereby they are
disenabled to pay what they borrowed; we must show mercy to beasts when they
lie under their burden, much more to men. Hence, Exodus 22.26, 27. Neh. 5.11.
Luke 6.35. Isa. 58.6. Mat. 18.28, 34.

Quest. How must we relieve by free lending?

Answ. When their estates are decayed, and our lending may probably recover
them again. Hence, Deuteronomy. 15.8. Mat. 5.42. Luke 6.35. Psalm. 112.5.

Quest. Whether are alms-deeds arbitrary, or an act of righteousness?

Answ. By righteousness we understand not generally all righteousness which
consists in a total conformity to the whole Law, nor that part of legal
righteousness which consists in obedience to the second Table; but certain
special fruits of this righteousness in works of mercy which by the Hebrews
are called by the name of righteousness, as Dan. 4.27. which is a grace that
rests not only in an internal habit, or bare affection of the heart, but also
in the outward action of relieving the poor. Which also is called Justice,
which is a virtue that gives to every one those things which are due to him,
Mat. 6.1. when thou do thine alms, which the Syriack renders, when thou do
thy Justice. Called also righteousness, 2 Corinthians. 9.9. Prove. 11.18. Psalm.
113.3. Now that almsdeeds are not arbitrary, but absolutely necessary is
proved: For that,

1. They are not only works of mercy, but fruits of righteousness, which are
straightly enjoined in the Law, Deuter. 15.11. Esaias 58.7. Ezekiel. 18.7. Luke 3.11.
and 11.41. Matthew. 4.42. Ephesians. 4.28. Luke 12.33. Acts 4.34.

2. Our riches are not absolutely our own, but Gods talents committed to us,
not for the satisfying of our lusts, but for the honor of our Master, and good
of our fellow servants. Hence, Heb. 13.16.

3, Such as neglect works of mercy commit three heinous sins, Theft,
Sacrilege, Murder: For they that have received much, and communicate not to
the wants of others, shall be arraigned and condemned for thieves against God
and their brethren: Besides what we are commanded to give to the poor is
consecrated to Gods service, called therefore sacrifices. So that its
Sacrilege to rob them of it: and lastly, if we suffer the poor to perish in
their wants we are guilty of murder against the sixth Commandment. Si non
p^visti, occi^isti, Ambrose. Thou have killd the poor, if thou have not fed
them. Hoc est occidere hominem vitae suae ei subsidia denegare. Ambr. This is
to kill a man when we deny to him the means of preserving his life.

4. The Lord who is the chief owner of our goods, having appointed all that we
can spare to this use, its no longer our own but the poors portion, which they
have as good right to as we have to the rest, therefore its injustice to detain
it: Only here is the difference; God has given us our riches immediately
himself, but to the poor mediately by us. Est panis famelici quem tu tenes,
nudi tunica quam tu in conclavi conservas. Basil. Its the bread of the hungry
which moulds in thy cupbord: the coat of the naked which hangs useless in thy
chamber, etc. Hence, Jam. 5.1. Prove. 3.27. 2 Cor. 8.4. and 9.1. Heb. 6.10. 1
Pet. 4.10.

5. We are but Stewards, and a day of account will come, Luke 16.2. and
therefore if we would give it up with joy, we must show mercy, Mat. 25.1. and
24.45, 46.

6. Consider that communion that is between the poor, and us with our Head
Christ; and its reason that such as are united in communion of persons, should
also communicate in the use of their goods for their mutual comfort, Romans
15.28. 2 Cor. 8.4. and 9.13. We partake of the same nature, are redeemed by the
same blood; are partakers of the same heavenly calling, 1 Cor: 1, 9. 1 Pet. 2,
9. and 3.9. and 5.10. partakers of the same precious promises, Ephesians. 4.5. are of
one Church, have one religion, etc. Jam. 2.5. Christ takes that that is done to
them as done to himself, and will richly reward it, Matthew. 25.40.

7. What we give to the poor, we give to God himself, Prove. 19.17. Da mihi de
eo quod dedi tibi: De meo quaero, and mihi non donas? Da, and reddo. Habuisti
me largitorem, facito debitorem. Aug. God thus bespeaks thee: Give me something
of that which I have given unto thee: I ask but mine own and wilt not thou give
it? Give, and I will restore it: Thou have found me a free giver, and now make
me thy debtor.

Quest. What further arguments may provoke us to charity?

Answ. First, we resemble God in showing mercy, and that in such an attribute
as he delights in above all others, Exodus 34.6. Hence, Luke

Secondly, such works please God, and make us accepted with him, Hos.
Eleemosyna non tantum pro sacrificio, sed prae sacrificio, Mic. 6.6, 8. Heb.
13.16. Isa. 58.6, 7. Jam. 1.27. Phil 4.18. Luke 11.41.

Thirdly, hereby we make our calling and election sure, 2 Pet. 1.7, 8, 10. Col.
Jam. 3.17. unfeigned repentance, Luke 19.8. A lively faith, Jam. 2.18. True
love to God, 1 John 3.17. Love to our neighbors, 2 Cor. 8.8, 24. contrary,

Fourthly, hereby we are assured of our interest in Gods promises: As, Eccl.

when we have forgotten, Mat. 25.44. Luke 6.38. Prove. 19.17. Terrena omnia

keeping, and kept by bestowing, solas quas dederis semper habebis opes. Hence,

dispendium, sed ditescendi potius compendium, quaestusque omnium uberrimus.
Giving alms is not the way to waste our wealth, but the best art of thriving,
and the most compendious course to get riches. Hence its compared to lending
upon usury, Mat. 10.30. Prove. 19.17. Luke 6.35. If we love our money, it should
move us to part with it upon charitable uses. God is the best and the surest
play master, and alsufficient to perform; Nihil promittit, and non reddit:
fidelis ille factus est debtor, esto tu avarus exactor. Aug. God pays what he
promises: He is a true debtor, be thou a covetous exactor.

Master Downams Plea.

Object. But we are poor, and have not to give?

Answ. Many that pretend this can yet find enough to bestow on idle,
unprofitable and wicked courses: But supposing

Ephesians, 4.28.

Object. But the poor are so unthankful that our alms are lost?

Answ. Thou must do thy duty and expect thy reward from God, not from men,
Eccles. 11.4. we must give, not only to the ungrateful, but to our enemies,
Romans 12.20.

Object. But most poor are so wicked that it discourages us to give them?

Answ. This should make thee more diligent in seeking out such as are worthy to
be relieved, Eccles. 11.6. Mat. 5.42. yet in giving we should not be
over-scrupulous. For,

1. Hereby we may neglect our duty, and not do it at all, Eccles. 11.4.

2. God causes his Sun to shine on the evil and good, Matthew. 5.45. and we
should imitate him. So Romans 12.21.

3. Its far better to give to many unworthy, then that one who is worthy should
be neglected in his necessity.

4. Consider that mercy looks not after merit, but after misery, and chiefly
intends to relieve their poverty, not to look after their righteousness: Non
moribus damus, sed homini. Chrysostom. we look not after the manners, but after the
man: nor do we take compassion of him for his virtue, but for his misery.

5. If God should take the same course with us as we do with the poor, and
examine our deserts before he would bestow his gifts, we should never have our
requests granted, but hopelesly perish in our wants.

6. We should forbear these overstrict examinations of the poor, le^t hereby we
do not so much comfort them by our gifts, as torment them by our harsh manner
of giving.

7. Consider that though the poor be unworthy to whom thou give, yet God is
worthy for whose sake thou give, and if thou give in obedience to his
command, though it seem to be cast away in respect of the party, yet not in
respect of thee who give; for God will certainly reward thee.

Object. But I have a great charge, and many children, and therefore must
prefer them before strangers?

Answ. They that are miserable because they have wife, and children, would not
be liberal if they had none: Ne transferas culpam in insontes, says Basil, lay
not the blame upon those that are innocent. Besides, was not the Gospel written
for such as well as for those that have no children? and are not both by it
equally bound to works of mercy? Did they beg children of God for this end,
that they might plead by them a privilege from obeying Gods Commandment? may
they not justly fear that God for this cause will ease them of their burden by
taking away their children? we may provide for them a competency, and yet not
deny to God of our abundance, and superfluity. When thou beginnest to number
thy children, number them, and spare not, but forget not to reckon Christ as
one of the number: He has given thee whatsoever thou have, and will richly
recompense thee. Besides thou know not how thy children will prove; it may
be ungrateful, and will not thank thee for it: It may be wicked and prodigal,
who will mispend it profusly: Yea, it may be the wealth thou leavest them will
be the occasion of their everlasting ruin.

Secondly, we must love our children wisely, and take care so to provide for
Protector, so that none shall wrest their patrimony out of their hand, Psalm
37.26.



Object. But trading is bad, and our burdens many, and we have not wherewithal
to give alms.

Answ. First, Use your hands: such as are able must labor, and take pains to
relieve those that can do neither, Ephesians. 4.28.





Object. But we must not only maintain nature, but our honor and credit in the
world?

Answ. Its true: yet we must abate from our superfluities. Christ disrobed
himself for a time, for our sakes, of his glory: and we for his sake must lay
aside of our overplus: abate something from a dog, from a bird, from a beast,
etc.

Quest. But what may move such as are able to be willing also to works of mercy?

Answ. First, look to God, he is our friend, nay, our Father. If a friend say
to you, such a friend or kinsman of mine is in want, pray you do something for
my sake, you will do it: how much more should you do it when God says so to
you.







Corinth. 9.6. It Is your gift, but its Gods debt, and he will repay it, Prove.
19.17.

Object. But when shall I have it again?

Answ. Take Gods Word, he will pay fully, and certainly: He has pawned his
honor, and credit upon it that he will do it at first or last. Put your
childrens portions into Gods hand, make him your Executor: He never dies: he
never breaks: he ever lives to provide for them.

Object. A man may give indeed till he give all away, and what then shall
become of him and his?

Answ. Eccles. 11.1. Solomon answers there all objections and cavils; some may
say, what I give is cast away and lost: No, Cast thy bread upon the waters, and
thou shall find them again. But there are so many poor that there is no end of
giving? Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: to this man a little, and
to that a little: to every one something. But I know not what times may come,
what I may be put to? Therefore give whilst thou have something to give; thou
know not how little a while thou may en^oy, nor what thy self may come
to want: Thou may need mercy, therefore sow mercy, that thou may reap
the like. I pity them with all my soul, but I cannot relieve them.

Answ. Solomon answers, If the clouds be full of rain, they will drop down
water; that is certain, it will impart it to the hungry and thirsty ground: So
if we have mercy and charity in our hearts, there will be something in our hand
too.

Object. But if I were well seated and accommodated, then I could spare
something, but alas! I live in a corner, out of the way, I have but little
trading, and its not with me as with many others, I cannot give?

Answ. Solomon answers, whether the tree stands North, or whether it stands
South, in a more fruitful, or in a more barren place, yet its the Lords tree
still, cadit Domino, it falls to him, and it bears fruit to him, and so it will
be with us too, If we be good trees, let us live in the North, or in the South,
in a better, or in a worse habitation, we will yet yield some fruit.

Object. Yea, this is true if we knew how it would be accepted: Poor men are
captious, and they will not take a little, and rich men will take exceptions,
and say that I do it out of pride, and thereupon will tax me the higher, etc.

Ans. Solomon again answers, He that observes the wind and rain, shall neither
plow nor sow: If a man will still be objecting, he shall never go on with any
work or service whatsoever.

Object. Yea, but I know not the parties to whom I give, there are many
dissemblers that pretend to much want, when it is not so?

Answ. Solomon answers, neither do thou know how the child grows in the
womb, yet thou must not starve the child: we must do what is fit for us to do,
and use our best wisdom, and then leave the rest to God, whose providence
works for us (as it were) under the ground, as it does for the child.

Object. But I find by experience that I have been often cheated with fellows
heretofore, and that discourages me now?

Answ. Solomon answers, sow thy seed in the morning, and slack not thy hand in
the evening, for thou know not which shall prosper, this, or that, or
whether both shall be alike: therefore cast not perils, but venture it
sometimes, thou know not but it may succeed very well: However, what thou
do with an upright heart, and usest thy best discretion in, God will accept
and take it in good part: See Dr. Harris Spittle Sermon.

Quest. But does God take notice of our works of c^rity?

Answ. Yea: First, he takes notice of the person that does them, as of
Cornelius,

Secondly, of every act of mercy.

Thirdly, how much mercy every one shows. Dorcas made many

Fourthly, of the time when: Obadiah in a hard time, hid the Prophets and King.
18.5.

Fifthly, with what heart and enlargement of affection we do them: as of those
Macedonians, 2 Cor. 8.3.

Sixthly, yea, of the least degree of mercy: Of a little cake, 1 King. 17.30.
Of Mat. 10.42. Idem.

Quest. What may move us to be constant, and continue in our charity?

Answ. First, in regard of our brethrens need; they may long continue to be
Joh. 4.13. Others also may stand in need of our charity: For, Mat. 26.11. You
have the poor always with you: we must not tie our selves to relieve one man
once only, nor one alone.

Secondly, in regard of our selves, for the reward is promised to such as
continue Romans 2.7. Dr. Gouge on Heb.

Quest. What warrant had the widow of Sarepta to relieve the Prophet before she
made provision for her self and her Son?

Answ. Had she not known that it was the special will of God; she should not
have done it, to defraud her self and her son to relieve a stranger, contrary
to the accustomed rule of piety, 1 Timothy 5.8. therefore Paul would have widows
to be maintained by their own kindred.

Quest. Is a man to prefer a stranger eminent in piety before his brother which
is not so adorned with it?

Answ. Thou must rather nourish and relieve thy poor brother, then thy friend:
For this office is coupled with nature and blood, according to which thou art
more obliged, and nearer to thy brother then to thy friend: But if it be in thy
power to advance the one to public offices in Church or State, thou must
prefer thy virtuous friend before thy carnal brother.

Quest. If I see many strangers in want, and one good man also, whether should
I relieve those many strangers, or that one good man?

Answ. A good man is to be preferred before a a stranger, but many strangers
before one known person: For the more common good is the better. Balls power of
godlin^sse.

Quest. Why is giving to the poor a duty?

Answ. First, because its such a duty as every poor man does desire, and crave
of another; and hopes, and wishes that he may perform it to him, and blames him
for unmercifulness if he neglect it; and every rich man will acknowledge that
if he should loose all, he would desire that others should show mercy to him:
therefore its a manifest duty arising from that plain Maxim, Do as you would
be done to.

Joh. 12.8.

Cor. 9.12, 13. Its makes heaven resound with thanks, and praises: yea if the
poors tongues should be silent, yet their very loins do bless God for thee in
their kind: therefore its our duty to do that which makes so much for Gods
honor.

Isa. 58.7. Jam. 1. ult. Luke 18.18, 24. Mat. 25.41. Jam. 2.13. Prove. 21.13. 1 John 3.17, 18, 19. Jam. 2.14.



Quest. But what shall we be better for our bounty to the poor?

Answ. Its the best way to prevent poverty, Luke 12.33. 2 Cor. 9.6. Prove.
11.24, 25. and that for these reasons.

1. Because God is the great Lord and master of his family in heaven and earth,
and riches come not by chance, or men's industry, or the love of their friends,
etc. but by the appointment of God, who makes rich, and makes poor; wherefore
all men are but his servants and stewards, to whom he commits more or less as
best pleases him: hence it follows, that it must needs conduce much to the
continuation and increase of a man's wealth, that he be found a good Steward of
the things committed to him by his Master. Now to communicate of our substance
to the poor with a large heart and hand, is to do the office of a good Steward,
1 Pet. 4.9, 10. and such shall not be put out of their office, but as he has
been faithful in a little, he shall be made Ruler over much.

Secondly, Solomon tells us, Prove. 10.21. The blessing of the Lord makes and
gives a comfortable increase of our estates: without which men are but like
horses, that carry a great burden of gold and silver through the world, and are
not Masters but Slaves to their riches. Now such comfortable wealth does not
spring from man's wit or pains, but from the blessing of God, without which the
Watchman watches in vain, the Builder builds in vain, the Husbandman plowes
in vain, the Merchant trafficks in vain, etc. either no increase will come,
or none but a vexing, and cumbersome increase: but the Lord has expressly
promised his blessing to those that open their hands to their poor brethren,
Deuteronomy. 15.10. and certainly God will never be found a Promise-breaker.

Thirdly, its a lending to the Almighty, and therefore will surely procure
abundance, Prove. 19.17. there is the Bill of Gods hand, wherein he both
acknowledges the debt, and promises payment, q. d. Be it known unto all men by
this present Promise, that I the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, do owe and
acknowledge my self to be indebted to every merciful liberal man all those
sums of money which he has, or shall bestow in relieving the distressed, to
be paid back unto him, whenever he shall demand it, (for where no day is set,
the borrower is bound to payment upon demand) and to this payment well and
truly to be made, I bind my self firmly by this present Promise, sent, sealed
and delivered by Solomon my known Secretary; so that unless we will proclaim
the Lord an insufficient or dishonest debtor, we see that giving to the poor is
the best way to save and increase our wealth, his word being far surer then
Checquer.

4. It will cause many prayers to God for us, that must needs cause him to give
Cor. 9* 14. or if any should be so unthankful as not to pray for such, yet
surely the household of faith will, to whom we ought most to abound in bounty.

Quest. But what means may we use to enable us to works of mercy?

Answ. That a man may give, he must have money, and an heart, and a will, and a
gift too: for he that has nothing, cannot give, though he would, he that wants
a heart, cannot give because he will not: both therefore are requisite, and for
the getting of both we must use these means.

First, we must seriously consider of these many Precepts, Promises and
Threats, Hear the Word, say also, Give to the poor? and if conscience bind me
to the one, does it not bind me to the other also? If I should keep all the
other Commandments, and break one, shall I not be found a transgressor of all,
will it any thing avail me, that I seem to be religious, if I be not merciful.

Secondly, to this add Prayer, beseeching God to give you this so worthy a
selves to be his children, John 13.34. and 1 John 3.14. and hereby we know that
we love the brethren, if our hands and hearts are open to them, for love is
bountiful.



1. You must be diligent in your callings, for the diligent hand makes rich,
and so provide matter for bounty, Ephesians. 4.28. and this is one end that we must
propound to our selves in the works of our calling, not only that we may
supply our own wants, but may have wherewithal to relieve others.

2. We must use thrift, which is a due saving from sinful and needless
expenses; and indeed hereby we might be enabled to do much, if we would cut off
our superfluities.

Object. But from what must we save?

Answ. From riot, luxury, drunkenness, gaming, and sinful expenses by which
men serve the Devil, and the flesh: From needless journies, and contentious
suits in Law: From excess in works of kindness, in attire, feasting,
housholdstuff, etc. and truly we should be willing to deny our selves in that
which is much more then enough, to minister to them that have less then enough.

3. We must lay up in store for mercy, we must have a poors man's box in our
house; as David, when he intended to build a house for God, he provided all
things aforehand in abundance, so must we for works of mercy, 1 Cor. 16.1. when
thus it lies by us we will give it with a free heart.

Quest. How much must we lay aside?

Answ. Be sure to do it in convenient abundance, rather with the more then with
the less: and truly most men may spare their tenths of their comings in for
pious uses, so we shall be rich in good works. Try this a while, and if thou
find Gods blessing so liberal that thou can well spare it, give it still:
If not, give according as thou art prospered.

Object. I give as much as my neighbors which have as good an estate as I?

Answ. Not men's examples, but the Scripture must be our rule: God bids us to
give after our ability, not after our neighbors nigardlinesse: Again, how
know thou that thou give as much as another of thy estate? Do thou know
all that he gives? or what his estate is?

Ob^ect. But I do not know that my neighbor is so poor?

Answ. First, you cannot meek God with pretending ignorance, Prove. 24.12.



Object. But I have little enough for my self and family?

Answ. First, he that has two coats may think that he has little enough, and
yet he is commanded to part with one.



Obj. But I must provide for my family, and therefore cannot give?

Answ. If this were a good argument then none should give, but the same God
that bids thee to provide for thy family, bids thee give too, therefore thou
must do both, and not strive so to overdo for the one, as to neglect the other.
Provide moderately for thy own, and thou shall have sufficient for the poor too.

Object. But I have not wherewithal to be still giving, I cannot spare it?

Answ. Have thou for fine clothes, for fine fare, etc. and have thou not for
works of mercy; suppose thy hat should be lost, have thou not wherewith to buy
another? Yes, why then wherefore have thou not wherewith to relieve a poor man?

Object. But if I should lose again and again, I should have nothing at
length?

Answ. It may be so, but thou may give so moderately that thou may have
still something to give.

Object. I give enough according to my estate, why then do you press me to
give more?

Answ. If this were true, it were a good answer: but in most I prove it to be
false, For compare thy expenses for mercy with those for superfluities, in
entertainments, in clothes, etc. they are far inferior, those of mercy are
nothing in comparison of the other: whereas God bids, feast the poor, and not
the rich, i. e. rather then the rich, therefore its evident that thou do not
enough for mercy.

Object. Yea, ^ut my place requires?

Answ. And does not thy place require that thou should be rich in mercy as
well as in clothes, and other things? know therefore that till thou art as
abundant in works of mercy as in other things, God does not account that thou
have done enough.

Object. But the poor are unthankful it?

Answ. First, all are not so; therefore give to them that are thankful.

Secondly, one man's fault must not dispense with another man's duty:

Thirdly, take heed that thou do not causelessly accuse them for
unthankfulness,

Object. But they are idle, and bring poverty upon themselves by their
idleness, and wastfulness?

Answ. First, have thou before admonished them of it? If not, here is a fault

Secondly, if thou can not prove this, thou art a slanderer as well as a
niggard,

Object. But they are such as have wronged me?

Answ. Choose to give to such, for so thou shall show more charity, and have a
greater reward: we are commanded to feed our hungry enemy, and have a special
blessing promised for it: and this is to imitate God, who loved us when we were
enemies.

Nbject. But if I be still giving, I shall give all away?

Answ. Use thy discretion in giving as in other things, and thou need not do
it. A man may be very bountiful, and yet reserve enough for other good uses, 2
Cor. 9.8.

Object. If I give so much away, I shall never be rich?

Answ. This is an excuse worse then the fault; for it charge God with flat
falsehood: God says, give, and thou shall not want: Thou say I shall want if
I give; He says, he that gives shall be blessed: Thou say, he shall not:
God says, he that waters shall be made fat: Thou say, he shall be made
lean: He says, he will repay it: Thou say, He will not repay it. Does not
this impute falsehood to God?

Besides, this objection arises from an abominable principle: Thus, What I
cannot be rich if I do, that I will not do: as if Gods commands must not be
obeyed if they keep us from riches: God says, be not hasty to be rich: and he
i^ not worthy of me that will not lose all for my sake: what hurt is it if thou
be not rich? thou may be saved without riches, but if we do not our duty,
we cannot be saved. Again, if thou be not rich in this world, thou shall be
rich in good works, and that's the best riches.

Object. Why should I give that to another which I have got by my hard labor?

Answ. Not thy labor, but Gods blessing has given thee this abundance, and
because he that blesses thee bids thee give, therefore thou should give.

Quest. What may further move us to be charitable?

Answ. First, God gives us all things richly to enjoy, therefore we should
imitate our father, and be bountiful like him.





^obs case.

Whatlies poor man's advocate.

Cor. 8.9. yea, he became so poor, that whereas the foxes have holes, and the
birds of the air have nests, yet he had not whereon to lay his head, Mat.
8.20. and this he did, that through his poverty, and pouring out his hearts
blood, he might crown us with the inestimable riches of heavenly glory, and
that for ever and ever: and shall not we worms and wretches, most unworthy of
the least bit of bread we put into our mouths, part with our superfluities to
relieve the fainting soul of him for whom Christ died, and which he takes as
done to himself, Mat. 25.40. were it but a cup of cold water only, Mat. 9.41.

Seventhly, remember that the last, and everlasting doom at that great, and
Matthew. 25.34, etc.

Of Spiritual Alms.

Quest. What are spiritual alms?

Answ. Such as flow from the fountain of truest mercy, and compassion, and are
of greatest consequence, tending to relieve, repair, and refresh the poverty,
wants, and miseries of the soul, and it consists in these particulars.

1. In instructing the ignorant, Prove. 10.21. and 15.7. 2. In giving counsel to
them that need, and seek it, Exodus 18.19. Ruth 3.1, etc. 3. In reducing the
erroneous, Exodus 23.4. 4. In endeavoring the conversion of others, Psalm.
51.13. Luke 22.32. 5. In exhorting one another, Heb. 13.13. 6. In reproving
such as offend, Lev. 19.17. 7. In admonishing such as are out of order, 1 These.
5.14. 8. In considering one another to provoke unto love, and good works, Heb.
10.24. 9. In comforting the heavy and afflicted heart, 1 These. 5.14. 10. In
forgiving from the heart our brethren their trespasses, Mat. 8.35. 11. In
chastening delinquents, Prove. 22.15. 12. In raising such as are fallen through
infirmity, with the spirit of meekness, Gal. 6.1. 13. In mutual encouragements
against the cruelty, and confusion of the times, and in the way to heaven, Mal.
3.16. 14. In supporting, and mercifully making much of weak Christians, 1 These.
5.11. 15. In using patience toward all men, 1 These. 5.14. 16. In praying one
for another, Jam. 5.16.
Boltons general Directions, etc.

Quest. What is Christ's meaning when he says, Lend looking for nothing again,
Luke 6* 35.

Answ. For answer hereunto let us consider, First, what we may look for again.
Secondly, what we may not look for again. Thirdly, what is Christ's sense.

First, we may look for again. 1. What justly answers to the thing lent. Hence
Elisha, 2 Kings 4.7. charge the widow to pay her debts.

2. In case the borrower can pay, and will not, and there be no other remedy,
we may have recourse to the Law for our relief: For the Law is good being used
lawfully, and the sword of the Magistrate is to defend the oppressed, Romans 13.4.

3. The like courtesies in time of need: For its but equal that we should
support one another in love.

4. Love and thankfulness. This Paul paid cheerfully to Aquila, and Priscilla,
Romans 16.4. To whom I give thanks: These things we may look for, yet we must not
lend for these things sake, for then we are self-seekers.

Secondly, we may not look for again: the like good turn to be done to us Exodus
22.14, 15.

Thirdly, this appears to be Christ's sense in the word nothing; because herein
Pharisees, who used to lend only to those that were able and willing to benefit
them again, and from whom they looked for the like, Luke 6.32, 33, 35.

Quest. What are the reasons why we must so lend?

Answ. First, Because of the command of God for it.

Secondly, the promise of Christ, Your reward shall be great in heaven, Luke
6.34,

Thirdly, its a sign of our sonship: Ye shall be the children of the highest.

Fourthly, the example of God, He is kind to the unthankful.

Fifthly, it differences us from ungodly men: Sinners lend to sinners to
receive

Quest. What are the reasons why its a blesseder thing to give then to receive?

Answ. First, because he that gives feels not the poor receivers troubles, and
tentations: He need not say, What shall I eat, what shall I drink, etc. Mat.
6.31.



Actor, and Doer in the providence of God: whereas the receiver is a sufferer:
and the more active we are, the more God-like we are, who is a pure act.

Quest. What is it to be a giver?

Answ. A giver is such an one as freely makes that which is his to become
another man's. Quod meum est, tuum efficere nullo vire cogente.

Quest. What is it to be a receiver?

Answ. He is a receiver that accepts as his own that which is given him from a
right owner: either out of bounty, as when Solomon received gifts from the
Queen of Sheba; or out of misery, as when the poor receive from the rich.

CHAP. XXVII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Chastity.
Quest. HOw many sorts of persons may be said to be chaste?

Answ. First, such as are borne with some natural

Secondly, such as are gelded, or made chaste by

Thirdly, such as are fitted by God for the gift of Mat. 19.22.

Quest. What are the things that hurt and hinder chastity?

Answ. They are of two sorts, either inward or outward.

Quest. What are the inward things?

Answ. Filthy imaginations, unchaste thoughts, and inward lusts, and motions of
the heart to uncleanness, whereunto the heart gives consent: or purposes of
the heart to any act of uncleanness, Matthew. 5.28. Col. 3.6.

Quest. When are these inwards lusts most vile?

Answ. When they are so violent and strong that they continually boil, and
burn within us, giving us no rest, but continually provoking to some filthy act
of uncleanness, 1 Cor. 7.9. Col. 3.5. Hos. 7.4.

Quest. What are the outward things that hurt or hinder chastity?

Answ. They are either such things as precede the act of uncleanness: or the
act of uncleanness it self.

Quest. What are they that go before it?

Answ. Either such things as more remotely provoke lust, or things nearer to it.

Quest. What are the remoter provocations to it?

Answ. First, gluttony, or excess in eating and pampering the belly with
meats; Jer. 5.8. Ezekiel. 16.49. Romans 13.13. Hos. 7.6.

Secondly, drunkenness, and immoderate drinking, using wine, and strong Isa.
5.11. Romans 13.13. Ephesians. 5.18.

Deuteronomy. 23.10.

Sam. 11.1, 2. Ezekiel. 16.49. 1 Timothy 5.13.

Quest. What are the nearer provocations unto lust?

Answ. First, Light, vain, and immodest setting out of the body, o^ carriage of
it, as by gayrish, wanton, and new fangled attire* Curling, frizling, and
powdering the hair: painting, and spotting the face: laying out naked breasts:
mincing with the feet, Ezekiel. 16.49. Prove. 7.10. 1 Timothy 2.9. 1 Pet. 3.3. 1 Cor.
11.14. 2 King. 9.30. Jer. 4.30. Isa. 3.16, etc. Zeph. 1.8.

Quest. May not such as have some deformity in the body labor to cover it?

Answ. Yea: so as they set not a new form upon the body: for dissembling is as
unlawful in deed as in word.

Genesis 39.10. Psalm. 50.18. Prove. 5.8. and 7.7, 8, etc. Ephesians. 5.5, 7.

Ephesians. 4.29. and 5.3, 4. Col. 3.8.

Acts 19.19.

Genesis 6.2. and 39.7. and 34.1, 2.

Numb. 25.1.2, 3. Ezekiel. 23.14. Ephesians. 5.3, 4.

Exodus 32.6. Job 21.11, 12. Mark 6.21, 22.

Genesis 39.12. Prove. 7.13. Deuteronomy. 25.11, 12.

Genesis 39.7, 10. Prove. 7.13, etc. Elton on the Commandments.

Quest. What means are we to use for the preserving of our chastity?

Answ. First, a constant and conscionable performance of private religious
exercises, as reading, praying, meditating, etc. will so purify the heart, and
sweeten the soul with divine comforts, and mortify the flesh, and confirm the
Spirit of grace, and beat down tentations, by means whereof a Christian shall
be conqueror over them.

Otia si tollas, etc.

Sodomite, Ezekiel. 16.49. beat down thy body by abstinence, 1 Cor. 9.27.

Mat. 5.29. for Prove. 6.29. Dalliance will breed whoredom. Fly fornication, 1
Cor. 6.18. as Joseph did, Genesis 39.10, 12.

Cor. 7.2. Whatelies Brid-bush.

the inside first clean, and let thy soul become the Spouse of Christ to love
and cleave to him.

Seventhly, preserve in thy soul the fear of God, Eccl. 7.28. He that is good
Prove. 2.10, 16. If knowledge enter into thy soul thou shall avoid her snares:
Consider Gods presence who sees thee.

Eighthly, hearty love betwixt married persons is a great preserver of
chastity, Prove. 5.19, 20.

Ninthly, use all good means appointed by God for the preservation of thy

1. Resist lustful thoughts at first, busying thy mind in holy thoughts, Prove.
23.26, 27.

2. Consider thy calling to, and profession of Christianity, by both which thou
art called to holiness.

3. Remember that the pleasure of sin is short, but the gnawing of a guilty
conscience will continue to eternity.

4. Apply the Word, which is the sword of the Spirit, especially such places of
it as tend directly to the cutting down of this sin.

5. Fly to God by prayer, and if thou be strongly assaulted, complain to
him, as a woman tells her husband to be rid of a temp^e^.

6. If these prevail not, see whether thou have not been guilty of uncleanness
before marria^e, if so, thou must truly repent of it, for marriage without
repentance abates not the power of lust, and therefore thou must with many
prayers and tears beg pardon; thou must (as it were) wash thy self in the
tears of true repentance, 1 Cor. 6.9, 11.

7. Get sound knowledge in the Wo^d of God, which is an excellent preservative
against it, Prove. 2.1, 3, 4, 11, 12, 16, 17. Psalm. 119.9. 1 John 2.14.

8. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, Eccl. 12.1. Consider that
God did not make thee to wallow in the mire of these swinish pollutions.
Meditate also of thy own mortality, that the thoughts of thy death may be the
death of thy lusts, 1 P^t. 2.11.

9. Walk in love: when Paul charges the Ephesians to avoid fornication, he
seriously advises them to walk in love, Ephesians. 5.2, 3. as knowing that the
exercise of true Christian love, breeds such desires of holiness, as mightily
fence the heart against all base lusts whatsoever.

10. Avoid too great estimation of earthly things, which breeds lust, 1 Timothy
6.9.

11. Take heed of contemplative wickedness, cast not about how to fulfill the
lusts of the flesh, Romans 13.14. Mr. Byfield on Col.

12. Beg chastity of God by prayer, seeing its his gift alone, Matthew. 19.11. 1
Cor. 7.7.

13. Fly the society of filthy and effeminat persons; 1 Cor. 5.6, 9, 11. Ephesians.
5.7. Prove. 23.20. and keep company with such as are sober and chaste. Consider
also these Texts of Scripture, Ezekiel. 16.49. 2 Samuel 11.2. 1 Pet. 4.7. 1 These.
5.6. 1 Timothy 5.6. and 2.9, 10. Tit. 2.3.

Quest. What is chastity?

Answ. Chastity is a part of temperance, whereby we keep our bodies, and souls
pure, and undefiled Temples of the Holy Ghost, and members of Jesus Christ, and
this is to be observed through our whole life, whether we be in a single or
married estate. See more in Matrimonial Chastity.

CHAP. XXVIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Children.
Quest. WHat is the best course that parents can take to have comfort in their
children?

Answ. The best way to have gracious children is to begin at Religion, planting
it in them as their tender years will bear, training them up in the knowledge,
and information of the Lord, dropping into them by little and little the seeds
of holiness, providing, if it be possible, that they may suck in holiness
with their mothers milk.

Quest. What may move parents hereunto?

Answ. First, they should consider that they have been the cause of their

Secondly, this is a good ground of all other nurture: for though they bring
them up in learning, or to trades, if they bring them not up also in the fear
of Prove. 23.15. My son, if thy heart be wise I shall rejoice.

Thirdly, God takes notice how parents perform this duty, and accordingly
Abraham, Genes. 18.17, 18, 19. and the contrary in Eli, 1 Samuel 2.29.

Fourthly, its a means for continuing and propagating the Gospel, and true

Quest. Wherein especially does this duty consist, and how may we perform it?

Answ. First, in acquainting them with the grounds of religion by private
catechizing

Secondly, by bringing them to the public Assemblies so soon as they are able
to sit there reverently, or fruitfully; This is to teach them in the trade of
their way, Prove. 22.6.

Object. But alas, what should we trouble children with such things as these?

Answ. First, though it may seem fruitless for the present, yet they will
remember it when they are old, Prove. 22.6.



Hannah brought her son to Eli to be instructed so soon as he was weaned, 1 Samuel 1.24. Solomon was a tender child when his father taught him, Prove. 4.4.
Timothy was acquainted with the Scriptures of a child, 2 Timothy 1.5. and the
excellent fruits of this timely instruction appeared in them all. Tailor on
Titus.

Quest. How must children manifest their reverence to their parents?

Answ. First, by their words, and that diverse ways.



Object. But this title of Father is so proper to God that we are to call none
on earth father? Mat. 23.9.

Answ. This is not simply to be taken of the title it self, but of the mind of
him that gives or affects it. If it be given, or affected to obscu^ Gods
fathertherhood, or to make a man a father of himself, without dependence upon
God or reference to him, who is properly the father of all, its an impious and
sacrilegious title, but otherwise its lawful and warrantable, as appears by
these texts, 1 Samuel 24.12. 2 King. 5.13. Judge. 18.19. 2 King. 6.21. 1 Cor.
4.15. 1 Timothy 5.1. Genesis 22.7. and 27.18.

2. They must show their reverence to their parents by using few words in their
presence, and those not without just occasion, Genesis 22.7. and 27.12.

3. By meek and humble speeches, 1 Samuel 19.4. and 24.10.

4. By taking a fit opportunity to speak: as when their parents are not
seriously busy, or in company, or in passion, 1 Samuel 19.6. Contrary, 1 Samuel
20.30.

5. By giving a present, and pleasing answer when their parents speak to them,
as 1 Samuel 3.4, 6, 18. Mat. 21.30.

Quest. How else must they show their reverence to their parents?

Answ. Secondly, by their carriage toward their parents, which consists in
these particulars.

1. If the child know that his parent is coming, he should haste to meet him;
So, Genesis 46.29. 1 King. 2.19.

2. Do such childlike obeisance as becomes their age and sex: as uncovering the
head, bending the knee, bowing the body, standing up, etc. So, Genesis 41.12. 1
King. 2.19.

3. Their countenance and gesture must be sober, and modest in their parents
presence.

4. They must give the place, and upper hand to their parents.

Quest. But what if the child be more wealthy and honorable then the parent?

Answ. No honor is comparable to the dignity of fatherhood: Indeed a child by
reason of some honor, and office may in public be forced to take place of a
parent, but they must not do it in private.

5. According to the custom of the time, and place they must ask them blessing.
So, Genesis 27.19. and 48.1, etc.

Object. These had the spirit of prophecy, whereby they could foreshew what
should come to pass afterward, which made their children come to them?

Answ. First, their blessings were more then predictions: for they were also
assurances that God would perform those blessings to their children: For they

Secondly, though parents cannot with such an extraordinary spirit assure to
their children any distinct particular blessing, yet the faithful prayer of
parents is Genesis 17.7. Acts 2.39. Prove. 15.8.

Object. If parents be wicked their prayers are an abomination, what blessing
then can children look for from wicked parents?

Answ. Though God hear not wicked parents in love and goodness to themselves;
yet for the good of their children he does and will hear them, and that the
rather to maintain a reverend respect of parents in the hearts of their
children: For asking a blessing is an acknowledgement of superiority, and
authority, according to that of the Apostle, Heb. 7.7. the less is blessed of
the greater. And as for the gesture of kneeling its answerable to the gesture
used by Jos^ph, Genesis 48.12. who bowed himself with his face to the earth.

Object. But kneeling is a gesture proper to Gods worship.

Answ. It is not so proper, but it may be used in civil cases, else Christ
would have reproved the young man for kneeling before him, as well as for
calling him Good; for he conceived Christ to be but a mere man, and the worship
he did was but civil. Its not simply the gesture, but the occasion of it, the
mind of him that performs it, and the ends which he performs it for, that
makes it either Divine, or Civil. Cornelius fell down before Peter, and was
blamed, because his manner of worshipping was Divine: the Jailer fell down
before Paul and Silas, and was not blamed, because his manner of worshipping
was merely civil. Some disallow not childrens asking their parents blessing,
but think it meet only for children whilst young, not considering of what
years, and state Joseph was when he performed it. Others think it not unlawful,
but carelessly neglect it, little considering the benefit of a parents blessing:
Esau shall rise up in judgment against them, Genesis 27.34. Heb. 12.17.

Quest. What is another duty of children to their parents?

Answ. Obedience, which is the surest note of the honor a child gives to his
parent: Hence, Ephesians. 6.1. Col. 3.20. without which, external reverence is a mere
mockage; as, Mat. 11.21. Obedience is a duty so proper, that the Apostle
applies it to Christ as a proper attribut, 1 Pet. 1.14. As obedient children,
etc. See Christ's example, Luke 2.51. Solomon calls the neglect of it, a
despising of a parent, Prove. 23.22.

Quest. Wherein consists this obedience?

Answ. First, in forbearing to do things without their parents consent, which
is a duty they are most bound to whilst they are under their parents
government, Numb. 30.17. and that for these reasons.

1. Children are as the goods of their parents, wholly in their power to be
ordered, and disposed by them. Hence Satan having all that Job had put into his
hands, took liberty over his children as well as his goods and cattle, Job
1.12, 19.

2. Children, whilst under their government, even the eldest that are heirs,
differ nothing from servants, Gal. 4.1.

3. By Gods Law, parents had power to sell their children, Exodus 21.7.

4. Parents had power to disannul such things as children had done, Number. 30.4.

Now this subjection of theirs consists principally in five things.

Quest. What is the first?

Answ. First, they must have their parents consent in making choice of their
calling: Jacob was sent by his parents to Laban, Genesis 28.2. David was appointed
by his father to keep sheep, 1 Samuel 16.11, 19. when Saul would have David to
wait on him, he sent to J^sse, 1 Samuel 17.17. so Jerem. 35.7. Jonadabs sons were
rewarded for their obedience in this kind.



1. God himself has given us a pattern, by bringing the woman to the man, Genesis
22.2. showing that he who gave a being to the woman, had a right to dispose of
her in marriage, which right now parents have in Gods room.

2. We have Gods express rule for it, Deuteronomy. 7.3. 1 Cor. 7.36, 37. The parent
had also power in giving, or not giving her that was defloured, Exodus 22.17.

2. We have the examples of Gods Saints for it; as of Isaac, Genesis 24.67. Jacob,
Genesis 28.2. He also asked his daughter of Laban, Genesis 29.18, etc. Sampson,
Judges 14.2.

4. We have the judgment of the ancient fathers, who constantly taught this
Doctrine.

5. The very heathen acknowledged the equity hereof, Genesis 34.3, etc. and 21.21.
Yea, and all Laws confirm it.

Quest. Why must parents consent be had in marrying their children?

Answ. First, because by marriage they are put from their parents, G^n. 2.24.
therefore its but equal that it should be with their consent.





Q. But what if their parents urge their children to marry such as they cannot
love?

Answ. If they have no just exceptions against the party, they must labor to
the uttermost to bring their affections to the bent of their parents will: but
if notwithstanding all the means they can use, they cannot get affections, they
may in a reverend manner entreat their parents not to press them to it.

Quest. What if parents be negligent in due time to provide their children fit
matches, may not they provide for themselves?

Answ. In such a case a child, knowing where a fit match may be had, may make
it known to his parents, as Sampson did, Judge. 14.2. craving his consent and
help therein: and if his parent will not hear, he may use the meditation of
friends, and if the parent be still wilful, he may have recourse to the
Magistrate, who is in Gods stead, and the father of his country, and what the
Magistrate does, its as good a warrant as if the parent did it.

The like may be done, if the Parent be an Idolater, Atheist, or Heretic, and
will not yield that his child shall marry to any but such as are of his own
profession, or disposition.

Object. Though Jacob married one wife by his parents consent, yet not the
other?

Answ. Jacob had a general consent from his parents to take a wife of the
daughters of Laban, therefore if it had been lawful for him to have two wives,
he had not done it without their consent.

Object. Servants may marry without their Masters consent, why not children
without their parents?

A. 1. Its not lawful for servants so to do, while the date of their covenant
lasts.

Secondly, Parents have greater power over their children, then Masters over

Object. Children marry for themselves, not for their parents, why then should
their consent be so stood on?

Ans. First, though they marry not for their parents, yet from their parents,
being by marriage freed from their power.

Secondly, children are not their own, but are the inheritance of the Lord,
Psalm. 127.3 and God has given them to their parents as an inheritance,
therefore a child may no more alienate himself from his parents, then other of
his goods.

Thirdly, children may not alienate any of their Parents goods without their
Genesis 31.36. Gal. 4.1. and that

1. Because parents may hereby know what they have, and what they have not, and
acco^dingly order their expenses, which they could not do if children might
purloin, and take of their goods at their pleasure.

2. Its a means to restrain the lavish humor of children, that so their
parents may be the better enabled to lay up for them, 2 Cor. 12.14.

Fourthly, Children must be ordered by their parents for their apparel. Israel
Joseph a coat, Genesis 37.3.

Fifthly, children must forbear to bind themselves to do any thing against
their Numb. 30.4.

Quest. Wherein consists the active obedience of children to their parents?

Answ. In yielding themselves pliable to their parents will, and that
especially in four things.

First, In being ready to their uttermost ability to perform all their lawful
commands, Ephesians. 6.1. as for example.

1. They must come at their call, Genesis 49.1. 1 Samuel, 3.5, etc. and 16.12.

2. They must go on their errands, though far, and troublesome, Genesis 28.5. and
37.14. and 42.2, 3. 1 Samuel 17.17, 20.

3. They must attend upon their parents when commanded, Gen* 22.6.

4. They must faithfully perform what business is enjoined them, Genesis 50.5.
Jer. 35.8. 1 Samuel 17.20, 34.

Secondly, in obeying the wholesome instructions which their parents give them,
Prove. 1.8, 9. and 4.1, 3. Exodus 18.24. For,

1. Parents are commanded to instruct them.

2. Great wisdom may be attained hereby, Prove. 13.1. and 1.9. and 4.9.

3. Much joy is brought to parents by it, Prove. 10.1. and 27.11. contrary, Genesis
26.35. 1 Samuel 2.25. Genesis 19.14.

Thirdly, in submitting to their parents reproofs; and amending what is justly
Genesis 37.10. 1 Samuel 20.30, etc.

Quest. What if the parent mistake in the matter reproved, may not the child
make answer?

Answ. Yea, but he must do it mildly, reverently, and seasonably.

Object. Christ took up his mother roundly, for reproving him unjustly? Luke
2.49.

Answ. Christ, as God-man, was greater then his mother, and so with authority
blamed her for her unjust reproof: This she knew, and therefore was silent.

Fourthly in submitting to their Parents correction, and amending what they
Heb. 12.9. Prove. 29.17.

Quest. What is the extent of childrens obedience to their Parents?

Answ. In all things, Col. 3.20. to wit, in the Lord, Ephesians. 6.1. For which end,

1. They must labor to bring their judgment and will to the bent of their
parents, to think that meet for them to do, which their parents would have them
do, Genesis 22.6, 7.

2. Though in their judgments they cannot think it fittest, yet if pressed to
it, they must submit, Genesis 276. etc.

Quest. May not a child yielding better reason then his parent, refuse to do
what be judges unmeet, at l^st till he be better informed?

Answ. He may render his reason with reverence, and humility, and desire his
parents not to urge it upon him, Genesis 43.3, 11. yet in indifferent things, if
parents will not be satisfied, but will be obeyed, children must yield. For,

1. In such things the command of a Parent is a warrant for the child, so that
a parent may sin in commanding that, wherein a child may obey without sin.

2. Children hereby manifest their high esteem of their parents, how willing
they are to please them.

3. Its a great means to preserve peace, and love betwixt parents and children.

Quest. What is further required from children to their parents?

Answ. To repay, and recompense what they can, their parents care, cost, and
kindness towa^ds them, and that in the way of thankfulness, 1 Timothy 5.4.

Quest. What rule is to be observed herein?

Answ. Children must relieve their parents according to their necessity which
may be through, 1. Natural infirmities: Or, 2. Casual extremities: Concerning
the first, the rule is

1. Children must bear with their parents infirmities, not the less reverendly
esteeming their place, or person; nor performing the less duty to them by
reason of the same, remembering that themselves in their younger and weaker
years were subject to many infirmities: as, Genesis 27, 12. It was a great
infirmity in Isa^c to prefer profane Esau before godly Jacob, especially
against an express Word of God: yet Jacob reverenced him not the less, Genesis
28.5. So Genesis 37.10. 1 Samuel 31.2. Luke 2.51. contrary, Prove. 30.17.

2. Children must cover their parents infirmities, both by passing them by, and
concealing them from others as much as they can. For, 1 Pet. 4.8. Love covers a
multitude of sins. So, Genesis 9.23. Contrary, Genesis 9.22. 2 Samuel 15.3. Concerning
the second, the rules are

1. Children must bear with their parents, and not the less reverently esteem
them, nor perform the less duty, because of them, being crosses which by Gods
providence are laid upon man, whether upon his body, as blindness, lamenesse,
sickness, etc. or on his person, as captivity, banishment, imprisonment, etc.
or on his estate, as poverty, want, etc. So Genesis 27.1. Ruth 1.26, 21. Hence,
Lev. 19.14.

2. Children must afford relief and succor to their parents as they need the
same. So, Genesis 48.1. and 37.35. and 42.8. and 47.12. Ruth 2.18. 1 Samuel 22.3, 4.
John 19.27. 1 Timothy 5.4. Contrary, Mark 7.11, 13. whereunto are such as first
deny relief to their parents, 1 John 3.12. Secondly, that bring their parents
into extremity by their lavish spending, or drawing them to be their Sureties;
or bringing them into danger by their mischievous practices, Genesis 37.34.
Thirdly, that strike their parents, Exodus 21.15. Fourthly, that murder them, 1 Timothy 1.9.

3. Children must bear with the inward infirmities of their parents, as
weakness of judgment, slipperinesse of memory, violence of passion, etc.

4. With their outward infirmities which arise from instant tentation: Such
were those, Genesis 9.21. and 19.33. 2 Samuel 11.4. and 18.33. Genesis 12.13. and 26.7.
and 37.34, 35.

Quest. What duties do children owe to their parents after death?

Answ. First, to inter their bodies with such decency, and honor as may be
answerable to the place, and reputation wherein they lived, Genesis 25.9. and
35.29. and 50.7. For,

1. Its a testimony of their great love, and respect to them.

2. Its a blessing promised by God to his Saints, 1 Kings 14.13. 2 Kings 22.20.
the contrary is threatened as a curse, Jer. 22.19. 1 Kings 21.23, 24. Psalm
79.3.

3. Its a great deformity for a corpse to lie above ground, therefore children
who are most bound to cover their parents deformity, are in this respect bound
to bury them.

Secondly, children must have respect to the credit of their deceased parents,

1. In paying their just debts so far as they can, when their goods, or lands
come to their hands, Psalm. 37.21.

2. In suppressing evil reports of their parents as much as they can. For,
Matthew. 7.2.

3. In imitating their parents good example. So, 1 Kings 3.3. 2 King. 22.2. 1
Kings 15.11.

Quest. After what manner must children perform all these duties to their
Parents?

Answ. First, for conscience sake, Romans 13.5* (...). 3.20. 1 Pet. 2.13.

Secondly, in sincerity, Col. 3.23.

Thirdly, cheerfully, and with a ready mind, 2 Cor. 9.7.

Fourthly, Reverendly, as to them that bear the image of God.

Fifthly, so, as yet not to sin against God: It must be in the fear of God.

Sixthly, Constantly, or else they loose their reward.

Quest. Must equal respect be showed to both parents?

Answ. Yea, the Law mentions both father and mother. So, Genesis 28.7. and Solomon.

1. Because both parents under God are alike means of their childrens being.

2. The care, and pains of both is very great.

Object. The wife is subject to the husband: therefore ought a child to prefer
his father before his mother?

Answ. Though there be a difference betwixt them in relation of one to another,
yet in relation to their children, they are both as one, and have alike
authority over them.

Quest. What if one commands what the other forbids?

Answ. The thing commanded, or forbidden must be observed: If it be about a
thing simply good or evil, then the parent that would have what is good to be
done, and what is evil to be forborne, must be obeyed, though it be the mother;
but if it be a thing indifferent: then the father is to be obeyed; yet no
contempt must be showed to the mother therein.

Quest. Whether do children owe subjection to step-fathers, and mothers, and to
fathers and mothers in Law?

Answ. Yea, as to those that are in the place of natural parents: So did Moses,
Exodus 18.7. and Ruth, chap. 1.16, 17. and 2.22. and Christ, Luke 2.51. and that,

1. Because the marriage bond makes them one flesh with our natural parents.

2. The Law makes it incest for a man to lie with his stepmother, Lev. 18.8,
17. therefore they are in the room of natural parents, and so to be honored.

3. Its a great honor which a child does to his natural father, or mother to
respect such as they have made one flesh with themselves.

Object. Nature cannot so well brook a step-parent, as a natural parent?

Answ. First, if not so well, yet we must not depise them.

Secondly, conscience, and religion should alter corrupt nature.

Object. Step-parents seldom care for their husbands, or wives former children?

Answ. First, God teaches not only to be subject to the good, and gentle, but
Pet. 2.18. and not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good, Romans
12.21.

Secondly, the Scriptures reckons such as rise up against their parents in Law
amongst Mic. 7.6.

Quest. Must children be subject to Guardians and Tutors.

Answ. Yea, for the Apostle faith that they are under them, Gal. ^4.2. So
Esther, chapter 2.20. and Elisha, 2 King. 2.15, etc. and 6.1.

Quest. What arguments may move Children to obey their parents?

Answ. First, they are commanded to obey them in the Lord, i. e. because
parents are to the children in the Lords stead, Liberis suis pater est vice
Dei. Greg. Nazian. they bear Gods image, and children in obeying them, obey God.

Col. 6.1. which implies three things.

1. Its agreeable to all Laws of God, Nature, Nations. 2. The place of parents
requires so much: For right requires that every one should have his due. 3.
Parents deserve so much, so that its done by way of recompense.
Col. 3.20. and he will reward it, Genesis 31.7, etc. 42. contrary, 1 Samuel 2.34. 2 Samuel 18.9. 1 King. 2.25.

Honor thy father, and thy mother. Its a perpetual and general Law.

Quest. What if children be grown to years, and not under their parents
government?

Answ. This may cause some difference: yet so long as a child has a parent, he
owes honor to him: as we see in Joseph, though married, and a great man, Genesis
47.12. and 48.12. and 50.5. and in Solomon, 1 King. 2.19.

that thy days may be long in the land, etc.

Dr. Gouge. Household duties.

Quest. Whether are many children a blessing?

Answ. Yea, so says David, Psalm. 127.5. and 128.3, 6. Hence, Ruth 4.11.

Quest. Whether may parents make void a contract secretly made by their
children, without, or against their consent?

Answ. The Scriptures gives them authority, either to ratify such contracts,
or to make them void, Numb. 30.6. the father may make void a vow of his child
in matters pertaining to Gods worship, much more a matrimonial promise. If a
young man defloure a maid, in equity he is to be compelled to marry her, Deuteronomy.
22.28. yet by Gods Law it may not be without the fathers consent, Exodus 22.17.

Quest. Whether is a marriage made without, or against the parents consent
valid, or no?

Answ. It may be valid in the courts of men according to humane laws, and
therefore the issue of such is free from bastardy: yet its not a divine, or
spiritual conjunction, or marriage, being flatly against Gods precept, Deuteronomy.
7.3. Exodus 34.16. 1 Cor. 7.38.

Mr. Perk. upon Gal.

Quest. What rules are parents to observe in giving names to their children?

Answ. First, they should give them such names as may put them in mind of some
good duty. Paul could never hear, or remember his new name, but he was thereby
put in mind of his new office, and duty which he was to perform amongst the
Gentiles.

Hebrews gave fit names in Hebrew: The Greeks in Greek, as Timothy, etc. Act.
26.1. the Latins in Latin, as Tertius, Quartus, Romans 16.22, 23.



Quest. Who are too curious?

Answ. Such as give them names above the nature of men: Some drawing too near
the Deity it self; as Emanuel; and the Jesuits. Some of Angels, as Gabriel,
Michael, etc. Some of virtues, as Grace, Faith, Mercy, Patience, etc.

Quest. Who are too careless?

Answ. Such as name their children with Heathenish names: as Hector, Achilles,
Hanibal, Julius Caesar, etc. as if they would have them prove like them.
Sometimes they give them names of things far below the nature of men, as of
beasts, trees, flowers, etc.

Dr. Tailor on Tit.

Quest. Why must there be such care in naming our children?

Answ. Because such whose names were appointed by God, as Genesis 17.19. Mat.
1.21. Luke 1.13. and such as were given by holy men and women that were guided
by Gods Spirit, were holy, sober, and fit names. As

1. Names which had some good signification: as Samuel, heard of God: John, the
grace of God: Jonathan, the gift of God: Simeon, obedient, etc.

2. Names which have in times before us been given to persons of good note,
whose life is worthy our imitation: as Isaac, David, Peter, Mary, Elizabeth,
etc. that the names may move them to imitate those worthies.

3. Names of our own Ancestors, and Predecessors, to preserve a memory of the
family, which appears to have been an ancient practice amongst Gods people,
Luke 1.59, and^.

4. Usual Names of the country, which custom has made familiar: as Henry,
Edward, Robert, William, etc.

Quest. At what time is it fittest to give names to our children?

Answ. At the time of their baptism. Under the Law, children were named at
their circumcision, Luke 1.59. and 2.21. and so under the Gospel it has in all
ages been used: and that

1. That their names may be a testimony that they have been baptized.

2. That so often as they hear their names, they may be put in mind of their
baptism.

3. That they may know how that by name they are given to Christ to be his
soldiers, and therefore they ought not to start from him.

4. That they may also be assured that being baptized with water, and the
spirit, they are registered by name in heaven.

Dr. Gouge Housh. Duties.

Quest. Whether, and how far are children that are married, or called to
public offices in Church, or State, bound to obey their parents?

An. Childrens obedience to Parents ought to be perpetual, so long as they
live: Implied in that Precept: Honor thy father, and thy mother, that thy days
may be long, etc. But yet not always in the same manner and degree. For
whilst children live in their fathers house, and under his power, they ought
to obey, and asist in taking care of household affairs, and in other businesses
as they are commanded by them, Mat. 21.28, etc. But such as are married, or
called to public offices, though they must reverence, and be helpful to them,
yet are they not bound to desert their callings, Luke 9.62. or to return to
take care of their family business as they did before.

Dr. Davenant on Col.

Quest. What general rules are to be observed by children in obeying their
Parents?

Answ. First, they must obey, not in some things, and at some times, but
always, Ephesians. 6.2.

Secondly, they must perform this obedience.

1. With reverence internal, and external: internally they must have an high
esteem of them, a tender respect to, and show honor, and observance of them:
Externally they must show it by all reverend behavior, as by rising up before
them, giving them the honor to speak first, etc.

2. With readiness to hear and receive their instructions, Prove. 1.8.



Prove. 13.1. To their restraints about diet, apparel, recreations, etc. To
their corrections, Heb. 12.9.

Tim. 2.1.



1. By obeying without enquiring, murmuring or contending. 2. By bearing with
their infirmities, whether of body or mind: yea, though aged, diseased,
crabbed. 3. By obeying without respect of profit; the contrary is base, and
mercenary.
Tim. 5.4.

Mr. Byfield on Col.

CHAP. XXIX. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Christ.
Quest. WHat are we to conceive of the Incarnation of Christ?

Answ. That it is a notable wonder, and great, beyond all comparison: that the
Son of God should be made of a woman, Gal. 4.4. Even of that woman that was
made by himself, John 1.3. Col. 1.16. that her womb and the Heavens now should
contain him, Acts 3.11. whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain, 1 Kings
8.27. that he who had both father and mother, whose pedigree is recorded, even
up to Adam, who in the fullness of time was brought forth in Bethlehem, and
when he had finished his course, was cut off at Jerusalem, should yet be in
truth, that which his shadow Melchizedek was, only in the conceit of the men of
his time, without father, without mother without pedigree, having neither
beginning of days, nor end of life, Heb. 7.3. with Isa. 53.8. and Mich. 5.2.
that his Father should be greater then he: John 14.28. and yet he his Fathers
equal, John 5.18. Phil. 2.6. that he is before Abraham was, John 8.48. and yet
Abraham's birth preceded his near two thousand years, that he who was David's
son, should yet be David's Lord, Mat. 22.42. etc. this is a wonder of wonders.

Quest. How may this kno^ be untied?

Answ. The untying of it depends upon the right understanding of the wonderful
conjunction of the divine and humane nature in the unity of the person of our
Redeemer; For by reason of the strictness of this personal union, whatsoever
may be verified of either of those natures, the same may be truly spoken of the
whole person, from whithersoever of the Natures it be denominated: For the
clearing whereof, remember that in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily, Col. 2.9. i. e. by such a personal and real union, as does inseparately
and everlastingly conjoyne that infinite Godhead, with his finite manhood in
the unity of the self-same individual person.

Quest. How may we understand this?

Answ. Remember that he in whom that fullness dwells, is the person: and that
fullness that so dwells in him, is the Nature. Now there dwells in him not
only the fullness of the Godhead, but the fullness of the Manhood also: so that
there are two distinct Natures in him: and two so distinct, that they do not
make one compounded nature, but still remain uncompounded, and unconfounded
together: But he in whom the fullness of the manhood dwells, is not one: and he
in whom the fullness of the Godhead, another: but he in whom the fullness of
both those natures dwells, is one and the same Immanuel, and consequently he
is but one person.

Quest. What is further to be considered about this?

Answ. That the Divine nature did not assume an humane person, but the Divine
Person did assume an humane nature: and that of the three Divine Persons, it
was neither the first, nor the second, that did assume this humane nature; but
it was the middle Person, who was to be the middle one, that must undertake
this Mediation betwixt God and us: which was otherwise also most requisite, as
well for the better preservation of the integrity of the blessed Trinity in the
Godhead, as for the higher advancement of mankind by means of that relation
which the second Person, the Mediator, did bear unto his Father. For if the
fullness of the Godhead should thus have dwelt in any humane Person, there
should then a fourth Person have been necessarily added to the Godhead: and if
any of the three Persons, besides the second, had been borne of a woman, there
should have been two Sons in the Trinity, whereas now the Son of God, and the
Son of the blessed Virgin, being but one Person. is consequently but one Son,
and so there is no alteration at all made in the relations of the Persons of
the Trinity.

Again, in respect of us, God sent his own Son made of a woman, that we might
receive the Adoption of sons, Gal. 4.4, 5, 7. and if a son, then an heir of
God through Christ: intimating thereby, that what relation Christ has to God
by nature, we, being found in him, have the same by grace, John 1.14. and 3.16.
with John 1.12. For though he reserve to himself the preeminence which is due
to him in a peculiar manner of being the firstborn amongst many brethren,
Romans 8.29. yet in him, and for him, the rest likewise by the grace of Adoption,
are all of them accounted as firstborn, Exodus 4.22, 23. Heb. 12.23. Romans 8.17.

Quest. What is the Nature assumed by the Son of God?

Answ. The seed of Abraham, Heb. 2.16. the seed of David, Romans 1.3. the seed of
the woman, Genesis 3.15. the Word, the second Person of the Trinity being made
flesh, 1 John 5.7. Neither did he take the substance of our nature only, but
also all the properties and the qualities thereof: yea, he subjected himself in
the days of his flesh to the same weakness which we find in our frail
nature, and was compassed with the like infirmities, being in all things made
like unto his brethren, Acts 14.15. Heb. 5.7. 2 Cor. 13.4. Heb. 2.17, 18. and
4.15. yet as he took upon him not an humane person, but an humane nature; so it
was not requisite that he should take upon him any personal infirmities, as
madness, blindness, lamenesse, and particular diseases, which are incident to
some only; but those alone which do accompany the whole nature of mankind, as
hunger, thirst, weariness, grief, pain, and mortality.

Quest. What is further considerable about Christ?

Answ. That as he had no Mother in regard of one of his natures, so he was to
have no Father in regard of the other: but must be borne of a pure Virgin,
without the help of man, Jer. 31.22. and this was requisite, as for other
respects, so for the exemption of the assumed nature, from the imputation and
pollution of Adams sin: For sin having by that one man entered into the world,
every father becomes an Adam to his children, conveying the corruption of his
nature to all whom he begets, Romans 5.12. but he being made of man, but not by
man, and so becoming the immediate fruit of the womb, and not of the loins,
must necessarily be acknowledged that holy thing, Luke 1.35. the Virgin was but
the passive and material principle, of which that precious flesh was made, and
the Holy Ghost the Agent and Efficient: yet cannot the man Christ Jesus be
thereby made the son of his own Spirit, because fathers beget their children
out of their own substance, but the Holy Ghost did not so, but framed the flesh
of him from whom himself proceeded, out of the creature of them both, the
handmaid of the Lord, Luke 1.38, 48. whom from thence all generations shall
call blessed. That blessed womb of hers was the Bride-chamber, wherein the Holy
Ghost did knit that indissoluble knot betwixt our humane nature and his Deity,
the Son of God assuming into the unity of his Person, that which before he was
not, and yet without change, (for so must God still be) remaining that which he
was, whereby it came to pass, that this holy thing which was borne of her, was
in truth called the Son of God, Luke 1.35. which wonderful connection of two so
infinitely differing natures in the unity of one person, how it was there
effected is above our shallow capacities, yea, the Angels stoop, and desire to
look into it, 1 Pet. 1.12. This we may safely say, that as the distinction of
the persons in the Holy Trinity, hinders not the unity of the nature of the
Godhead, though every person holds entirely his own incommunicable property, so
neither does the distinction of the two Natures in Christ any ways cross the
unity of his person, although each nature remains entire in it self, and
retains the properties agreeing thereto, without any conversion, composition,
commixtion, or confusion.

Quest. What is further considerable about Christ?

Answ. That as there is one God, so there is one Mediator between God and man,
even the man Christ Jesus, etc. 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. and in discharge of this his
Office, he being the only fit Umpire to take up the controversy between God
and man, he was to lay his hand as well upon God, the party so highly offended,
as upon man, the party so basely offending. In things concerning God the
Priesthood of our Mediator is exercised, Heb. 5.1. and 2.17.

Quest. What are the parts of his Priestly Office?

Answ. Satisfaction, and Intercession: the former whereof gives contentment to
Gods Justice: the latter soliciteth his mercy, for the application of this
benefit to Gods children in particular; whereby it comes to pass that God, in
showing mercy upon whom he will show mercy, is yet for his Justice no loser,
Romans 3.26. By virtue of his Intercession he appears in the Presence of God for
us, and makes request for us, Heb. 9.24. and 7.25. Romans 8.34. Heb. 4.14, 15.
and he must be such a suitor as takes our case to heart. Hence, Heb. 2.17. he
must be made like his brethren, etc. In which respect, as it was needful he
should partake with our flesh and blood, that he might be tenderly affected to
his brethren: So likewise for the obtaining of so great a suit, it behoved that
he should be most dear to God his Father, and have so great an interest in him,
as he might always be sure to be heard in his request, John 11.42. and
therefore he must be his beloved son, Matthew. 3.17. so then it was fit our
intetcessor should be man like our selves, that we may come boldly to him, Heb.
4.16. It was fit also he should be God, that he might go boldly to the Father
without any way disparaging of him, as being his fellow and equal, Zach. 13.7.
Phil. 2.7.

Quest. Why must Christ be a propitiation for our sins?

Answ. Such was Gods love to Justice, and hatred to sin, that he would not have
his justice swallowed up with mercy, nor sin pardoned without making a fit
reparation: therefore our Mediator must not look to procure for us a simple
pardon without more ado, but must be a propitiation for our sins, and redeem
us by his fine, and ransom, and so not only be the master of our requests, to
entreat the Lord for us: but also take upon him the part of an advocate to
plead full satisfaction made by himself as our Surety, Romans 3.25. 1 John 2.2.
and 4.10. Mat. 20.28. 1 Timothy 2.6. Job 33.24. 1 John 2.1. Heb. 7.22. unto all
the debt wherewith we any way stood chargeable.

Quest. What satisfaction did Christ our Surety bind himself to perform in our
behalf?

Answ. It was of a double debt, the principal, and the accessory.

Quest. What was the principal d^bt?

Answ. Obedience to Gods most holy Law, which man was bound to pay as a
perpetual tribute to his Creator, though he had never sinned; but being now by
his own default become bankrupt, he is not able to discharge in the least
measure; his Surety therefore being to satisfy in his stead, none will be
found fit to undertake such a payment, but he who is both God and man.

Quest. Why must he be man?

Answ. First, because man was the party that by the Articles of the first
Covenant, was tied to this obedience, and it was requisite that as by the
disobedience of one man, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one
man, should many be made righteous, Romans 5.19.



Quest. Why must he be God?

Answ. Because, if he were a bare man, though he had been as perfect as Adam in
his integrity, or the Angels themselves: yet being left unto himself amidst all
the tentations of Satan, and this wicked world, he should have been subject to
fall as they were; or had he held out, as the elect Angels did, it must have
been ascribed to the grace, and favor of another, whereas the giving of strict
satisfaction to Gods justice was the thing required: but now being God as well
as man, he by his own eternal spirit preserved himself without spot, presenting
a far more satisfactory obedience unto God, then Adam could possibly have
performed in his integrity.

Quest. How may that appear?

Answ. Besides the infinite difference that was betwixt both their persons,
which makes the actions of the one beyond all comparison to exceed the worth
and value of the other, we know that Adam was not able to make himself holy,
but what holiness he had, he received it from him that created him after his
own image, so that whatsoever obedience Adam had performed, God should have
eaten but of the fruit of the vineyard which himself had planted, 1 Cor. 9.7.
and of his own would all that have been which could be given to him, 1 Chronicles.
29.14, 16. But Christ did himself sanctify that humane nature which he
assumed, John 17.19. and so out of his own peculiar store did he bring forth
those precious treasures of holy obedience, which for the satisfaction of our
debt, he was pleased to tender to his Father.

Adam had done all things that were commanded him, he must for all that have
said, I am an unprofitable servant, I have not done that which was my duty to
do, Luke 17.10. whereas in the voluntary obedience which Christ subjected
himself to, the case stood far otherwise. Indeed if we respect him in his
humane nature, his Father is greater then he, John 14.28. and he is his Fathers
servant, Isa. 53.11. Mark 12.18. yet in that he most truly said, that God was
his Father, John 5.18. the Jews did rightly infer from thence that thereby he
made himself equal with God, and the Lord has proclaimed him to be the man
that is his fellow, Zach. 13.7. Being therefore such a man, and so highly
borne, by the privilege of his birthright, he might have claimed an exemption
from the ordinary service which all other men are tied to; and by being the
Kings son, he might have freed himself from the payment of that tribute which
was to be exacted of strangers, Matthew. 17.25, 26. when the Father brought this
his first begotten into the world, he said, Let all the Angels of God worship
him, Heb. 1.6. and at that very instant wherein the Son advanced our nature
into the highest pitch of dignity, by admitting it into the unity of his sacred
person, that nature so assumed, was worthy to be crowned with all glory and
honor, and he in that nature might then have set himself down at the right
hand of the throne of God, Heb. 12.2. tied to no other subjection then now he
is, or hereafter shall be, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God
the Father: For then also in regard of his assumed Nature, he shall be subject
unto him that has put all things under him, 1 Cor. 15.27. But he looking on
the the things of others, Phil. 2.4, 5, 7, 8. he chose rather to come by a
tedious way, and wearisome journey to it, not challenging the privilege of a
Son, but taking upon him the form of a mean servant: not serving as an
honorable Commander in the Lords Host, but as a common Soldier, making
himself of no reputation, and emptying himself of his high dignity, he humbled
himself, and became obedient unto death, Phil. 2.7. being content all his life
long to be made under the Law, Gal. 4.4. Yea, so far that as he was sent in the
likensse of sinful flesh, Romans 8.3. so he disdained not to subject himself unto
that Law which properly did concern sinful flesh, and therefore though
Circumcision was by right applicable only to such as were dead in their sins,
and the uncircumcision of their flesh, Col. 2.11, 13. yet he in whom there was
no sin to be put off, notwithstanding submitted himself there unto: not only to
testify his communion with the Fathers of the Old Testament: but also hereby
to tender to his Father a bond signed with his own blood, whereby he made
himself in our behalf a debtor to the whole Law, Gal. 5.3. Baptism also
pertained properly to such as were defiled, and had need to have their sins
washed away, Act. 22.16. hence Matthew. 3.6. Mar. 1.5. when many came to John
Baptist, Christ also came amongst the rest: but the Baptist considering that he
had need to be baptized of Christ, and not Christ by him, as altogether
unfitting for that imaculate Lamb of God: Yet did he, as our Mediator, submit
himself to that Ordinance of God also: not only to testify his communion with
the Christians of the New Testament: but especially, because it became him thus
to fulfill all righteousness, Matt. 3.15. and so having fulfilled all
righteousness which the meanest man was tied to, in the days of his
pilgrimage (which he needed not to have done, if he had respected himself
only) the works which he performed were truly superogatory, which might be put
upon the account of them whose debt he undertook to discharge, and being
performed by the person of the Son of God, must in that respect, not only be
equivalent, but infinitely overvalue the obedience of Adam, and all his
posterity, though they had continued in their integrity, and remained instantly
serving God day and night till this hour: And thus for our main and principal
debt of our obedience, our Mediator has given satisfaction to the justice of
his Father with good measure, pressed down, etc. Luke 6.38.

Quest. What other debt were we liable to, which Christ must discharge?

Answ. Besides obedience, sin is also a debt, Matt. 6.12. and sinners debttors,
Luke 13.4. Matt. 13.16. in regard of the penalty due for the default: and as
the payment of the debt which comes nomine panae, discharges not the Tenant
from paying his yearly rent afterward, which of it self Would have been due,
though no fault had been committed: so the due payment of the yearly rent after
the fault had been committed, is no sufficient satisfaction for the penalty
already incurred: therefore our surety, who stands chargeable with all our
debts, as he makes payment of the one by his active, so he must make amends
for the other by his passive obedience. He must first suffer, and then enter
into his glory, Luke 24.^6. For Heb. 2.10. it became him, for whom are all
things, etc. in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their
salvation perfect, i. e. a perfect accomplisher of the work he had undertaken,
through sufferings.

Now the Godhead is of that infinite perfection, that its not subject to any
passion: and therefore if Christ had been only God, he could not have paid this
debt, which consisted of suffering and dying: Besides, Gods Justice must be
satisfied in that nature that had sinned, and the same nature must suffer
punishment, that had committed the offense, Heb. 2.14, 15. therefore Christ
became man that he might suffer, Phil. 2.8. Heb. 10.5, 7, 9, 10.

Quest. Why must our Savior be more then man?

Answ. Because if he had not been God too, he could never have gone through
with such a work. For if a man had been as righteous as Adam, and willing to
suffer for the offense of others, possibly his sufferings might have satisfied
for one: But here innumerable multitudes were to be redeemed to God, Rev. 5.9.
and 7.9. Neither could man, or Angel have held out, if a punishment equivalent
to the endless sufferings of all the sinners in the World had at once been
laid upon him. It shaked the powers of Christ himself, on whom the Spirit did
rest, Isa. 11.2. It amazed him, Mar. 1.33. made him send up strong cries, Heb.
5.7. and prayers, Mar. 14.35, 36.

The blood whereby the Church is purchased must be Gods blood, Acts 20.28. the
Lord of glory must be crucified, 1 Cor. 2.8. the Prince and Author of life
killed, Acts 3.15. the man who is Gods own fellow must be thus smitten, Zach.
13.7. with Matt. 26.31. Again, if the life of any singular man might have been
equivalent to the lives of all mankind: yet the laying down of that life would
not have been sufficient, unless that he that had power to lay it down, had
power also to take it up again, hence Paul concludes, 1 Cor. 15.17. If Christ
be not risen, our faith is in vain, you are yet in your sins. Hence also, Romans
4.25. Had Christ broken prison, and made an escape, the payment of the debt,
which as our surety he had taken upon him, being not satisfied, Heaven would
not have held him, more then Paradise did Adam after he had fallen into Gods
debt, and danger: But raising himself from the dead, presenting himself in
Heaven before him, to whom the debt was owing, and maintaining his standing
there, he thereby has given good proof that he is now a freeman, and has
fully discharged that debt of ours for which he stood committed: and this is
that evidence, which we have to show, of that righteousness whereby we stand
justified in Gods sight, according to that of the Apostle, Romans 8.33, 34. hence
Joh. 10.17, 11. and 2.19, 21. The Manhood indeed could suffer, but not overcome
death: the Godhead could overcome any thing, but not suffer; He therefore that
was to suffer, and overcome death for us, must be partaker of both natures,
that he might do both, 1 Pet. 3.18.

Quest. How is this Redemption purchased by Christ, conveyed to us?

Answ. It was indeed a dear purchase, when we were redeemed by the blood of
God: but what should the purchase of a stranger have been to us? or what should
we have been the better for it, if we could not derive our descent from the
purchaser? The manner in Israel was concerning redemption, that to him that was
next of kin belonged that right to be Goel, or the Redeemer, Ruth 3.12. and
4.1, 3, 4, 7. Hence Job calls Christ his Goel, Job 19.25, etc. For if he had
not thus assumed our flesh, how should we have been of his blood, or claimed
any kindred to him? and unless the Godhead had by a personal union been
unseparably conjoined to that flesh, how could he therein have been accounted
our next of kin? Hence 1 Cor. 15.47. Christ is reckoned the second man, though
there were many millions between Adam and him, and that because these two were
the only men, who could be accounted the prime fountains from whence the rest
of all mankind did derive their existence and being. For as all in the world
derive their descents from the first man: so in the respect of a more immediate
influence of efficiency, and operation, do they owe their being to the second
man, the Lord from heaven, as is employed, Jer. 1.5. Psalm. 119.73. and 139.13.
and 71.6. Job 10.8, 11. Act. 17.27* etc. this being a certain truth, that God
does more immediately concur to the generation, and all other motions of the
creature, then any natural agent does, or can do. Hence, Romans 5.17. This second
man is not only as universal a principle of all our beings, as was the first,
and so may sustain the common person of us all as well as he: but is a far
more immediate agent in the production thereof: not as the first, so many
generations removed from us: but more near to us then our next progenitors,
and so justly to be accounted our next of kin, even before them also.

Quest. Is this sufficient and all that is required?

Answ. No, there is another kind of generation required, for which we must be
beholding to this second man, before we can have interest in this purchased
Redemption: For as the guilt of the first man's transgression is derived to us
by means of carnal generation: So must the benefit of the second man's obedience
be conveyed to us by spiritual regeneration. Hence, John 3.3 and 1.13. Now as
Christ in respect of our Adoption of Sons, which he has procured for us, calls
us brethren, Heb. 2.11. so in respect of our new birth* whereby he begets us to
a spiritual and everlasting life, he owns us for children, Isa. 53.10. Psalm.
22.30. Heb. 2.13. and v. 14. The Apostle deduceth this conclusion. For as much
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he himself likewise took part
of the same. He himself, i. e. he who was God equal to the Father: For none
else could make this new creature, but the same God that is the Creator of all
things, 2 Cor. 5.17. Ephesians. 2.10. Gal. 6.15. James 1.18. 1 P^t. 1.3. 1 John 5.1.
Th^se new born babes being born of the Spirit, none could send the spirit to
beget them, but the Father, and the Son from whom he proceeds; the same
blessed Spirit that framed Christ's natural body in the womb, being to fashion
every member of this mystical body unto his similitude and likeness.

Quest. How may this mystery be further opened to us?

Answ. In every pe^fect generation the creature produced, receives two things
from him that begets it: Life, and Likeness. Now touching our spiritual death,
and life, consider these texts, 2 Corinthians. 5.14, 15. Ephesians. 2.4, 5. Col. 2.13.
Gal. 2.20. From which we may easily gather, that if by the obedience and
sufferings of a bare man, though never so perfect, the most sovereign medicine
that could have been thought upon, should have been prepared for the curing of
our wounds; yet all would be to no purpose, we being found dead when the
medicine came to be applied. Our Physician therefore must not only be able to
restore us to health, but to life also, which none but God the Father, Son, and
holy Ghost could do: Hence, Job. 5.26. and 6.57.51. Hence Christ is said to be
a quickening spirit, 1 Cor. 15.45. An Adam therefore, and perfect man he must
be, that his flesh given for us on the Cross, might be made the conduit to
convey life to the world: and a quickening spirit he could not have been, if he
were not God, able to make that flesh an effectual inst^ument of life by the
operation of his Spirit, as John 6.63.

As for the point of similitude and likeness, it is said that Adam after his
fall begat a son in his own likeness, Genesis 5.3. so says Christ, John 3.6.
That that is born of the flesh is flesh, etc. So, 1 Cor. 15.48, 49. Indeed ou^
likeness to Christ will be more perfected hereafter, Phil. 3. ult. yet in the
mean time, such a conformity is required in us to Christ, Phil. 3.20. Ephesians.
4.22, etc. Romans 8.29. God did not give the Spirit to Christ by measure, and
therefore though many millions of believers, do continually receive this supply
of the Spirit of Christ, yet that fountain is not in the least exhausted, nor
that wellspring of grace diminished. For, Col. ^.19. and John 1.16. As in the
natural generation, there is a correspondence in all parts between the begetter
and begotten, though it be found in the begotten in a far less proportion:
so in this spiritual: for every grace that is eminently in Christ, the like
grace will appear in Gods children, though in a far inferior degree.

Quest. What further is to be considered herein?

Answ. That Christ by enlivening and fashioning us according to his own image,
his purpose was not to raise a seed to himself dispersedly, and scatteringly,
but to gather together in one the children of God, etc. John 11.58. yea, and to
bring all to one head by himself, Ephesians. 1.10. So that the Church militant and
triumphant, though as far distant as earth and heaven, yet they make but one
in Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 2.21, 22.

Quest. What are the bonds of this mystical union between Christ, and us?

Answ. The quickening Spirit on his part, which being in him as the Head, is
thence diffused to the spiritual animation of all his members: and faith on our
part, which is the prime act of life wrought in those who are capable of
understanding by the same spirit: See both proved in these Texts, John 6.63. 1
Cor. 6.17. and 15.45. Phil. 2.1. Romans 8.9. 1 John 3.24. and 4.13. Gal. 2.20.
and 5.5. and 3.11. Ephesians. 3.17. Both of which are of so high a nature, that
none could possible by such ligatures knit up so admirable a body, but he that
was God Almighty. As for Faith, its the operation of God, Col. 2.12. wrought by
the same power that raised Christ from the dead, 2 These. 1.11. Hence Paul
prays, Ephesians. 1.19, etc. It was fit also that this Head should be of the same
nature of the body that is knit to it. Hence, Ephesians. 5.30. John 6.53, 56.
showing that by this mystical and supernatural union, we are as truly
conjoined with him, as the meat and drink we receive, when its converted into
our own substance. Secondly, that this conjunction is immediately made with
this humane nature. Thirdly, that Christ crucified has by his death made his
flesh broken, and blood poured out for us, to be fit food for the spiritual
nourishment of our souls, and the very wellspring from whence by the power of
his Godhead, all life, and grace is derived to us: Hence, Heb. 10.19, 20

Quest. What are we further to consider in Christ?

Answ. That as in things concerning God, the maine execution of our Saviors
Priesthood does consist: so in things concerning man, he exercises both his
Prophetical office, whereby he opens the Will of his Father to us, and his
Kingly, whereby he rules and protects us. It was indeed a part of the Priests
office to instruct the people in the Law of God, Deuteronomy. 33.10. Hag. 2.11. Mal.
2.7. yet were they distinguished from the Prophets, Isa. 28.7. Jer. 6.13. and
8.10. and 14.18. and 23.11, 33, 34. Lam. 2.20. As in the New Testament Prophets
and Apostles were a different degree from ordinary Pastors and Teachers, who
received not their doctrine by immediate inspiration from heaven, Ephesians. 4.11. 2
Pet. 1.21. Hence, Heb. 1.1. God has spoken to us by his Son, called
therefore the Apostle as well as the High Priest of our profession, Heb. 3.1,
2. and therefore in the execution of his prophetical office he is in a more
peculiar manner likned to Moses, Deuteronomy. 18.15, etc. Act, 3.22, 23. Our Prophet
must therefore be a man raised up from amongst his brethren the Isralites, Romans
9.5. who was to perform to us what the fathers requested of Moses, Exodus 20.19.
Deuteronomy. 5.25.27. and this he daily affects by the power and Ministry of the
Gospel, instituted by the authority, and seconded by the power of this our
great Prophet, whose transcendent excellency beyond Moses is set forth, Heb.
3.3, 4, 5, 6. which House of God is no other then the Church of God, 1 Timothy
3.15. whereof, as he is the only Lord, so he is also properly the only builder:
Christ therefore being both the Lord and builder of his Church must be God as
well as man, Mat. 16.18. whence it is that we find all the Mansions of this
great house to be called indifferently the Church of God, and the Churches of
Christ, 2 Timothy 2.20. 1 Cor. 11.16. Romans 16.16.

Indeed there are other Ministerial builders whom Christ imploys in that
service, which he bestowed upon his Church for that end, Ephesians. 4.11, 12. who
receive their power from him, Mat. 28.18. Such was Paul, 1 Cor. 15.10. and 3.9,
10. yet there he acknowledged that they were Gods building, as well as Gods
husbandry, so v. 5.7.

Two things therefore we find in our great Prophet that differences him from
all the other prophets. 1. That no man knows the Father save the Son, and he to
whom the Son will reveal him, Mat. 11.27. John 1.18. Being in his Fathers
bosom he knows his secrets, and thereby is able to reveal the whole will of
his Father to us, whereas all other, even Prophets, and Apostles have their
knowledge at the second hand according to the grace given them by the Spirit of
Christ, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11. John 16.13, etc. 2. All other Prophets and Apostles
can do no more then plant, and water; but God only gives the increase; they
could not save one soul unless Christ were with them by the powerful presence
of his Spirit, John 5.25. Ephesians. 5.14. Psalm 13.3. without whose assistance we
are altogether ignorant. For, 1 Cor. 2.14. wherefore Paul concludes concerning
himself, and all his fellow laborers, that all is of God, 2 Cor. 4.6, 7. Our
Mediator therefore must not want the excellency of power whereby he may make
us capable of this high knowledge of the things of God propounded to us by the
Ministry of his servants; and so must be God as well as man: that he may save
to the uttermost all that come to God by him, Heb. 7.25.

Quest. What are we to consider about Christ's Kingly Office?

Answ. That he has a Kingdom, Isa. 9.7. Dan. 7.13, 14. Luke 1.31, etc. He is
that new David our King, which God has raised up to his Israel, Jer. 30.9.
Hos. 3.5. Ezekiel. 34.23. and 37.24. who was in truth both the Son of man, and
the Son of the Highest: that in one respect we may say to him as they did to
David, 2 Samuel 5.1. we are thy bone, and flesh; and in the other, sing of him as
David did, Psalm 110.1. The Lord said to my Lord, etc. so that the promise
made to our first parents, Genesis 3.15. may well stand with Paul's saying, Romans
16.20. the God of peace shall bruise Satan under our feet. For he came for this
end, 1 John 3.8. 1 Timothy 3.16. and still that foundation of God remains
unshaken, Isaiah 43.11. Hos. 13.4. besides me there is no Savior.

Quest. What are the special branches of this Kingdom of our Lord and Savior.

Answ. First, the one of grace, whereby that part of the Church is governed

Secondly, the other of glory, belonging to that part which is triumphant in

Quest. How does he work upon this on earth?

Answ. As by his Prophetical office he works upon our mind and understanding:
so by his Kingly office, he rules our will and affections, casting down
imaginations, etc. 1 Cor. 10.5. working in us both to will, and to do, Phil.
2.13. That he sanctifies us wholly, 1 These. 5.23. we are taught likewise to
believe, that both he that sanctifies, and they that are sanctified are all of
one, i. e. of one and the same nature, Heb. 2.11. that as their nature was
tainted in the first Adam, so it might be restored again in the second Adam:
and that as from the one a corrupt, so from the other a pure and undefiled
nature might be transmitted to the heirs of salvation.

Quest. How does Christ exercise his Kingly Office toward the Church
triumphant?

Answ. In that the same God that gives grace, is he also that gives glory:
yet so, that the streams of them must run to us through the golden pipe of our
Saviors humanity. For, 1 Cor. 15.21. since by man came death, it was fit that
by man also should come the resurrection of the dead; even by that man who has
said that he will raise us up at the last day, John 6.54. who shall then come
to be glorified in his Saints, etc. 2 These. 1.10. and shall fashion our vile
bodies to his glorious body, Phil. 3. ult.

See Dr. Ushers Incarnation of the Son of God.

Quest. When does Christ first live in a Christians heart?

Answ. When the heart gives a firm assent to the gracious promises made in
Christ for the pardoning of sins, and acceptance to the favor of God, and
title and interest to life everlasting. For as Christ was conceived in the womb
of an humble and believing Virgin; so if we will conceive Christ in our hearts,
we must be humble to deny our selves in all things, and believing, to go out of
our selves to the promises of God in Christ.

Quest. Why must our Savior be Emanuel, God with man?

Answ. First, in regard of the greatness of the good which we are to have by
him: For,

1. He is to be God and man together to satisfy the wrath of God, to undergo
the punishment due to sin, as our Surety: He must give us title to heaven, and
bring us thither, which none can do but God.

2. He must know our hearts, wants, griefs, infirmities, and must be every
where to relieve us: and none can do this but God.

Secondly, in regard of the evils which we are to be freed from: He is to

He must be man: For man had sinned, and man must suffer for sin, and without
blood there is no remission: and then that he might be a merciful Savior,
there must be a sutablenesse in the nature that there may be a sympathy.

Quest. Why must this God and man be one person?

Answ. Because if each nature were a distinct person, then there would be two
Christ's, and so the actions of the one, could not be attributed to the other.

Quest. How does Christ make us friends with God?

Answ. First, by satisfaction, taking away the wrath of God.



Quest. How shall I know that this Emanuel is God with me?

Answ. If by the same spirit of his that sanctified his humane nature, he works
in me desires to be nearer, and nearer to him, to be liker to him. If I am on
his side: If I be near him in my affections, desires, and understanding. If I
find an inward desire to be more with him, and like to him: If outwardly in
the place where I live, I side with him, and take part with his cause, its a
sign I have an interest in him.

Quest. What benefits accrue to us by Gods taking our nature upon him?

Answ. First, he has hereby dignified, and raised our natures above the
Angels: Oh, what a mercy is this that the great God of heaven and earth, should
take dust into the unity of his person, and marry such a poor nature as ours is?



Thirdly, hereby we are made one with God; shall God then be God with etc.

Fourthly, as he has thus advanced our natures, so he has put all the riches
of

Fifthly, our nature being ingraffed into the Godhead, therefore what was done

1. Object. How could the death of one man satisfy for many millions?

Answ. Because it was the death of Christ, whose humane nature was graffed into
the second person in the Trinity, and being but one person, what the humane
nature did or suffered, God did it.

Quest. But how does friendship between God and us arise from hence?

Answ. First, because sin which caused the division, is hereby taken away:

Secondly, Christ is a fit person to knit God and us together, because our
nature

Thirdly, Christ being our head of influence, conveyeth the same spirit that is

Quest. How shall we know that we have any ground of comfort in this Emanuel?

Answ. We may know that we have benefit by the first coming of Emanuel, Come
Lord Jesus, Revel. 22.20.

Secondly, whereas he took our nature upon him, that he might take our persons
to make up mystical Christ, he married our nature to marry our persons,

1. As he sanctified his natural body by the Holy Ghost, so he will sanctify
us by the same Spirit, there being the same Spirit in the Head and members.

2. As he loves his natural body* so as never to lay it aside to eternity, so
he loves his mystical body in some sort more; for he gave his natural body to
death for his mystical body; therefore he will never lay aside his Church, nor
any member of it.

3. As he rose to glory in his natural body and ascended to heaven: so he will
raise his mystical body that it shall ascend as he ascended.

Doctor Sibs his Emanuel.

4. Christ being in heaven, and having all authority put into his hands, Psalm.
2.9, 10. he will not suffer any member of his body to suffer more then is fit.

Object. If all the power that Christ has be given him, as it is, John 17.2.
then he is Deus constitutus, Deus creatus, datus, not Deus natus: made, and
created God, how then can he be of the same nature with God, who has all he
has given him in time?

Answ. First, If Christ speaks there of his Divine Nature, then, though not as
God, yet as the second Person, he is of the Father, and so not in time, but
from all eternity he had all those divine properties communicated to him: for
he is therefore called the Son, because begotten of the Father.

aliquid dicitur fieri, quando incipit patefieri, a thing is said to be done,
when it manifests it self, as Act. 13.33. This day have I begotten thee,
speaking of Christ's resurrection, because he was then truly manifested to be
the Son of God.

Quest. Wherein consists the power of Christ?

Answ. First, In that its universal, in Heaven, Earth, and Hell, Phil. 2. 10,
11.

Joh. 15.26.

He is the way, the truth, and the life, Joh. 14.6.

Joh. 12.32. To save that which was lost, to dissolve the works of the Devil,
etc.



Matt. 11.27.

Quest. What are the remarkable particulars wherein Christ's dominion over all
flesh, especially the Church, does appear?

Answ. First, in appointing a Ministry for the conversion and saving men's
souls, Matt. 28.18, 19. Ephesians. 4.11.

Cor. 3.6, 7.



Joh. 1.16. In Christ there is plenitude fontis, the fullness of a Fountain. In
Angels, and Adam, only plenitude vasis, the fullness of a vessel. Now this
fullness of Christ is for communication, and our participation of it, Joh. 15.3.
hence 1 Timothy 6. 15. He is King of Kings, etc.

niward peace, and joy of heart here, or eternal happiness hereafter, both
which are in Christ's power, and munificence, Isa. 9.6. He is called the Prince
of peace, and our peace, Ephesians. 2.14. and Heb. 5, 9. the author of eternal
salvation.

Sixthly, In that he can forgive, and pardon sin, which is only in Gods power,
Mar. 2.7. For, nemo potest remittere de jure alieno.

Seventhly, In giving Laws, and prescribing duties to all according to which
they

Eighthly, In inabling, and strenthening his children in all their afflictions,
so Phil. 4.13. 2 Cor. 12.5.

Ninthly, In that he is appointed to judge the whole world: where two things

1. The immediate preparation to it: For Christ by his power shall raise up all
out of their graves, 1 Cor. 15.22. the godly shall rise, because they are
members, and he their Head, and the godly shall be raised by him as a Judge.

2. His solemn coming to judgment with Power and Majesty, 2 These. 1.7, 8.

Tenthly, By overruling, conquering, and subduing his enemies, Christ though
in heaven, yet has his enemies, even all that are enemies to his Church and
Acts 9.4. they oppose Christ, who oppose his Members. If you hurt the feet, the
head in heaven feels it: but Christ will reign in despite of all his enemies,
Psalm. 2.2. Hence Rev. 2.27. Christ rules the Nations with a rod of iron, etc.

Object. But why then is the power of the Turk and Pope still lifted up against
him?

Answ. The Apostle tells us, 1 Cor. 15. and Heb. 2. All things are not yet in
subjection to him: he has a Kingdom, and power; but as yet he is only Rex
pugnans, and vincens, then he will be Rex triumphans. He will put down all
power, and principalities, there will be nothing but Christ's power.

Quest. Why is Christ so frequently in Scripture called a head?

Answ. First, In regard of his eminency, and dignity: For he is exalted above
every name, i. e. any thing that has the greatest fame, and dignity either in
this world, or that to come, hence Col. 1.18. that he might have the
pre-eminence in all things.

Secondly, In regard of his spiritual influence, and powerful communication of
Col. 2.19. As the Head is the Fountain of all life, and motion, and from it
every member has its proper nourishment, so it is with the Church of God.

Thirdly, This relation of a head implies a near union and conjunction,

Fourthly, In respect of Government and direction; He is the King of Saints,

Quest. Is all mankind given by God the Father to Christ, to be redeemed by him?

Answ. Though Christ has a sufficiency, and fullness in him to obtain salvation
for all, yet some only are given to him intentionally by Gods decree to be
their actual Savior, and Mediator, Joh. 17.2. For if all were given to him,
then all must be saved, Joh. 10.28, 29. and 6.37, 39.

Object. But Joh. 17.12. its said, of those that thou gave me, there is none
lost but the son of perdition, therefore some may be lost?

Answ. The Apostles are said to be given to Christ in a two fold respect: 1. Of
Sanctification, and Glorification, and so Judas was not. 2. In respect of their
Office, and Calling, as Joh. 6.10. So then there is a two fold giving of some
to Christ, the one of justification to eternal life, the other of Office, and
service: and that this is meant here is plain, because he is called the son of
perdition.

Quest. Whether did Christ fully finish the work that the Father gave him to
do?

Answ. Yea he did fully, and perfectly finish it, Joh. 17.4. concerning which,
observe these particulars.

1. Christ might have come into the world as a glorious Lord and Lawgiver,
only to rule and give Laws: but coming as a Mediator, and surety, it behoved
him to be under a Law, and to discharge that work he undertook, and this
appears, because he was not necessitated to be incarnate, but it was wholly at
his own good pleasure, Phil. 2.7, 8.

2. There was an holy and admirable agreement between God the Father and the
Son, to be a Mediator for those which his Father had given him. For though the
Covenant of Grace be made with believers, yet there was a previous and an
Antecedent Covenant made between the Father and the Son to be a Mediator,
which argreement was, that if Christ would lay down his life for such, then the
Father would give them to him as his seed, and glorify them, and also reward
him with all honor, and glory, hence Isa. 53.11.

3. From this Covenant and agreement it is, that Christ's work is truly and
properly obedience, and such and obedience as has a reward annexed to it: and
Joh. 10.8. Christ calls it the commandment which he had received from his
Father, hence also, Romans 5.19.

4. That it was not merely obedience, but a meriting obedience: there was an
intrinsecal worth, and excellency in Christ's obedience answering to our
salvation: Hence, though we have justification, and salvation of mere grace,
yet in respect of Christ, it was of justice, and debt, so that in Christ the
Covenant of Works was fulfilled, though in us the Covenant of Grace.

5. This work Christ was to do, was in its self very heavy, and grievous,
though his readiness made it easy. For to obey the Law of God, and to suffer
all the wrath that was due for our sins, was a bitter cup to drink off, hence
Matthew. 26.39.

6. This work Christ finished and completed.

Quest. In what particulars did his finishing this work consist?

Answ. First, in that he did it wholly, and universally, there was not one
tittle of the Law which he did not fulfill.



Luke 1.35. Heb. 7.26. and 4.15.

Cursed is he that continues not therein, Gal. 3.10.

Fifthly, He so finished it, that he left nothing to be done, either by Angels,
or

Object. Then what needs diligence, and zeal in the ways of God: Sin, or not
sin, all is one, Christ has done all, etc?

Answ. Our duties are not required to that end which Christ's was, but yet they
are necessarily commanded for other ends, because God has commanded them as
the way to walk in, if we will be saved: as also to glorify God, and to
restifie our thankfulness and love to him, yea, there is an inseparable
connection btween a man interessed in Christ, and a holy life, as there is in
the fire with heat and light.

Quest. What are the properties of the work which Christ finished?

Answ. Fir^, it was a work of infinite value, because he was God as well as

Secondly, Mediatory, all that he did, and suffered tended to a propitiation,

Thirdly, It was not only his work, but our work: He did them not for his

Fourthly, It was of necessity, and that 1. From the Justice of God, which
being

Fifthly. Here is the glorious visibility of Christ's perfect working in his

Quest. What are we further bound to believe concerning Christ?

Answ. First, That whatsoever Christ had, or was, was not for himself, but for
us: His fullness for our emptiness: His atonement for our sins: as the full
Isa. 9.^. 1 Cor. 1.30.

Quest. In what particulars will this appear?

Answ. First, His Incarnation was for us, not for Angels, nor for any other
Paul said, Gal. 2.20. who gave himself for me. It was not the multitude of
Believers which made Christ to become man: for comparatively there are but a
small remnant, but it was because such are given to him as Mediator, and so he
would be faithful for one, as well as for many.

Secondly, All that Christ did was not for himself, but for us: All his
miracles, Joh. 11.15. His miracles tending to the confirmation of their faith.
So was his obedience to the Law, and fulfilling the righteousness thereof, for
our sakes.

Thirdly, His sufferings, and rendering himself an Atonement, and Sacrifice
Isa. 53.5. He died for us, gave himself for us, etc, Heb. 12.24. Abels blood
cried for vengeance, but Christ's for mercy.

Fourthly, The fruits and benefits of his mediation redound to us:
Justification,

Col. 1.14.



Quest. Why is it their duty to do so?

Answ. First, because otherwise Christ would be in vain, and not of that use
that God has appointed him for: the fountain runs in vain, if none will
drink of it.



Whither shall we go? thou have the words of eternal life.



Quest. Whether did not Christ die for all men?

Answ. Christ's Mediatory prayer, John 17. and Death, is not for all the world,
but only for some certain persons who are given by the Father to him.

Quest. How can this be made out, and proved?

Answ. First, Consider that there is a necessary connection between Christ's
prayer or intercession, and his death: they are of equal latitude; whom he
prayed for, he died for, and whom he died for, he prayed for: So, Romans 8.34.
and this must needs be so, because Christ's prayer is one part of his Priestly
office, and the oblation of himself a sacrifice for sin was the other.

Hos. 13.9. Death and hell are the wages of sin.

John 10.11.





all died in Adam, so all shall be made alive in Christ, 1 Cor. 15.22. He takes
away the sins of the world, 1 John 2.2. He is a propitiation, not for our
sins only, but of the whole world: Yet all these must be taken indefinitely,
not universally, that he died for all sorts of persons in all Nations, not for
each particular person, as will appear by these reasons.

1. The Scripture does expressly limit Gods love, and Christ's death to some
only, John 10.15. for his sheep, Romans 8.33, etc. So, John 17. Now these can
never be reconciled to the other Texts, but by this distinction.

2. The Scriptures which speak of this universality, speak of the actual
benefit and fruit of his death. Now its granted by all, that none do actually
partake of Christ's benefits but the godly. So then if the whole world, 1 John
2.2. should extend to all mankind, then all should be actually pardoned and
saved.

3. Experience shows that such phrases must necessarily be so limited: For if
Christ died for all men intentionally: How is it that under the Law, excepting
a few proselytes, the offer of grace was only to some few, and though it be
enlarged under the Gospel, yet there are many Nations, and persons to whom
Christ and his benefits have never been offered; and how then can we think that
Christ died for those to whom he never discovered so much as the mention of his
death.

Quest. Why then does the Scripture speak so universally about Christ death?

Answ. Not to lead us into an error contrary to other Scriptures, but for
these reasons.

1. To show that this great benefit purchased by Christ, was designed for man,
and not for the Apostate Angels, Heb. 2.17.

2. It might be in opposition to the Jews: For a long time the means of
salvation were only amongst them, as John 4.22. therefore Peter would not so
much as preach the Gospel to the Gentiles till he was admonished to call no
person unclean, Acts 10.15. Seeing therefore that formerly to the Jews only
were committed the Oracles of God: now that by Christ's coming the partition
wall was broken down, and the means of salvation is not enclosed in one Country
more then in another, it may very well be called the whole world that Christ
died for; for commonly the Scripture comprehends all the men of the world under
this division of Jew and Gentile: Hence is that precept, Mark 16.15. Preach the
Gospel to every creature: So Romans 11.15. The casting away of the Jews is the
reconciling of the world: where the world is opposed to the Nation of the Jews.

3. It was to abate and confound the pride of the Jews, who because the Messiah
was to come of them, were apt to be puffed up with this privilege, and to envy
and murmur that the Gentiles should be made partakers of this grace: which
Christ represents under the elder brothers murmuring at the entertainment of
the younger, Luke 15.30.

4. It might be, because when Christ came into the world, few of the Jews were
converted in comparison of the Gentiles, Romans 11.8, etc. and those branches
were broken off, that new ones might be grassed in: therefore it may we^l be
said, that Christ died for all, and that he was a propitiation for the sins
of the whole world, because that all Nations did now come in and worship
Christ, whereas few of the Jews received him.

5. It was, because now no Nations or particular persons were excluded: For
though there be an election of some only, and Christ in his death had a special
love to those only whom the Father had given him: yet because, who these
individual persons are, is not manifested by God, therefore the outward
propounding of it is universal, not excluding any: Thus all the invitations and
commands are universal, as Mat. 11.28.

6. It may be, because though the greater part of the world perishes, and many
are called, but few chosen, Matthew. 22.14. Yet if we judge of those for whom
Christ died, absolutely in themselves, they are a great number: So that as
there is a world of those that perish, so there is a world of those that shall
be saved.

7. It does use such expressions, as in this, so in other things also, when yet
all acknowledge that there is a necessity of restraining it: as speaking of
Christ, its said, All flesh shall see the salvation of God, Luke 3.6. and Act.
2.17. I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, etc. whereas some only had
those extraordinary gifts: So that famous promise, that all Nations of the
earth should be blessed in Abraham; whereas, Gal. 3.9. it is restrained to the
spiritual seed of Abraham.

Quest. Do reprobates receive any benefit by Christ's death?

Answ. In some respects it had been better for them if there had not been a
Christ, because when they wilfully refuse him, it aggravates their sin and
condemnation, John 3.19. and 15.22. yet several mercies do redound even to
reprobates by Christ's death. As,

1. There is no man that lives under the means of grace, but he may hereby be
encouraged to repent, and to believe for his salvation; whereas the Apostate
Angels are left without hope.

2. The Ministers of the Gospel may hereupon promiscuously preach the Gospel to
all, as within the sphere of Christ's death; So the Apostle writing to
Churches, wherein many were corrupt both for doctrine and manners, yet calls
them a Church, Saints, Believers, not excluding any from the benefit of Christ:
So therefore may Ministers do in their preaching; yet they must not propound
Christ as a Savior to them in the first place, but must do as Paul when he
preached to Foelix, Act. 24.25. laying open the wrath of God to him for his
sins, so that he trembled: So must they humble them by the Law, before they
preach the Gospel.

3. Reprobates have this advantage by Christ, that they enjoy all the mercies
they have: For all being forfeited by Adams sin, by Christ (who is the heir of
all things) they come lawfully to enjoy the mercies they have: For its Christ
that bears up the world: Indeed they have not a sanctified use of what they
enjoy; for to the impure all things are impure, Tit. 1.15. but otherwise they
have a lawful right before God and man to what they enjoy, Psalm. 115.8.

4. Its by Christ's death that many wicked men are partakers of the common gifts
of Gods Spirit: Its the Spirit of Christ that gives several gifts to men, 1
Cor. 14. Christ is the vine, and so not only grapes, but even leaves come from
his sap and juice.

5. Christ by his death is made Lord of the whole world, and has conquered all
the inhabitants that are therein: so that they are Christ's as a Lord, who has
bought them by his death, 2 Pet. 2.1. they denied the Lord that bought them.
Wicked men are bought by him to be his Vassals and servants, and he may dispose
of them as he pleases for his Churches good.

Quest. How may it be proved that Christ gave himself only a ransom for some?

Answ. First, because we are said to be elected in Christ our Head: For though
election be originally from the mere will of God, yet we are chosen in Christ
as the Mediator: If then election be only of some, as is proved, Romans 9. then
Christ died only for some: For Christ is but the medium, whereby election does
bring about all the effects thereof. Seeing therefore election is only of
some, and that is in Christ as the medium, Christ also must be only for those
that are elected.

Secondly, whom Christ as Mediator would not pray for, those he would John
17.9. shall he give his blood, and will he not voutsafe a prayer, his
intercession? and oblation go together.

Thirdly, for whom Christ died, he died not only for their salvation, but that
they Tit. 2.15. but the wicked have not faith and repentance given them.
Therefore

Fourthly, there cannot be a greater love then Christ to die for one, and if
how shall he not with him freely give us all things, Romans 8.32. therefore to
say that Christ died for all, and yet will not save all, is to grant the
greater, and deny the less.

Quest. How then shall we know who they are that have an interest in Christ's
death?

Answ. First, such as are dead to sin. Christ's death, and sins death go
together, Romans 6.10, 11. Gal. 5.24. If Christ be crucified for thee, the lusts
of sin are crucified in thee.

Secondly, such are not only dead to sin, but to the world also: So Paul,
6.14. Col, 3.2, 3. so then not only gross sins exclude from a propriety in
Christ's death, but also an inordinate frame of heart to these lawful things
below. Indeed if this inordinate affection be a burden, and grief to thee, they
hurt not: non sensus, sed consensus nocet.

Thirdly, such make the death of Christ a pattern of all patience, and humble
Peter 2.21, 24. for Christ's death is not only efficacious, and meritorious,
but exemplary. Christ learnd obedience by his sufferings, Heb. 5.6. when he was
reviled, he reviled not again, etc. so should it be with us.

Fourthly, such look upon the bitterness, and ugliness of sin, as being so

Fifthly, such are infinitely affected with the love of God, and Christ in this
Corinth. 5.14. considering from what a dying, damning state Christ's death freed
them, it works in them unspeakable affections, and enlargments toward God and
Christ.

Sixthly, Such will resign up to Christ all that they have, and now live no
Romans 6.10, 11. 1 Pet. 2.24. 1 Cor. 6.20. they look upon their bodies, estate,
health, parts, etc. not as their own, but resign up all to Christ.

Quest. What are the privileges which come by Christ's death to such (...) have
interest therein.

Answ. First, such as can plead Christ's death, can also plead his resurrection,
Romans 8.34.

Secondly, such have a propriety in all the benefits of his mediatourship, Romans
8.33, 34. Heb. 10.14.

Thirdly, such shall have no other good thing either in heaven or earth denied
Romans 8.32. He that has Christ, has enough, and if thou want any thing, its
not because God does not love thee, or because his merciful thoughts are not
toward thee; but because many good things are not absolutely good in
themselves, and so not wholly necessary for thee.

Fourthly, such may from this special love to them rather then to others, have
Romans 8.35.

Cor. 15.55, etc.

Quest. What are the benefits we have by Christ's ascension, and exaltation?

Answ. First, hereby his holy Spirit is given more plentifully, and abundantly:
implied, John 7.39. So John 16.17. If I depart I will send the comforter, etc.

Ephesians. 4.8. Christ when he ascended gave gifts to men: that we have a Ministry
and Ordinances with the spiritual effect thereof, its wholly from this? Yea,
John 14.12. all miraculous gifts descend from this: Yea, our Faith, Repentance,
love to God, and delight in holy things is because of this truth.

John 14.3. He is gone to heaven to see that Thrones of glory be provided for
his people.

John 2.1. H^b. 7.25. In his greatest glory he forgets not his children, as
Pharaohs Butler did Joseph: Yea, when we cannot mind our selves, Christ is
commending our estate to the Father, and pleading our cause when any accusation
is brought against us.

Joh. 14.3. which is the utmost happiness that a believer can desire.

Quest. Who is the great Lord Keeper of the Saints?

Answ. Jesus Christ, John 17.12.

Quest. What is implied herein?

Answ. First, It implies our insufficiency to keep our selves.

treasure, his Jewels, Mal. 3.17. A peculiar people, and his heart is upon them.

Job 7.20. Psalm. 36.6. but he has a gracious presence with his children, which
is not from his infiniteness, and necessity, but from his mere love, 2 Chronicles.
16.9. Isaiah 31.5.



1. Christ's power which is omnipotent, John 10.29.30. Their life is hid with
Christ in God, Collos. 3.2. and they have a Crown laid up in Heaven.

2. His fidelity and immutability: He is the Amen, the Alpha, and Omega; the
same yesterday, to day, and for ever, Heb. 13.8.

3. His love, and compassion, which quickens both power, and fidelity, and sets
all on work; when we were enemies he died for us, Romans 5.10. How much more,
being reconciled, will he care for us, which is far less then to die.

4. His Wisdom: All treasures of wisdom being hid in him, Isaiah 9.6. He is
called the Counselor: now all these must needs make the godly safe.

Heb. 10.14.

Quest. What does the phrase imply, where Christ is said to be sent into the
world, Joh. 17.18.

Ans. First, That though the three Persons in the Trinity are equal in nature,
and Joh. 17.2. Gal. 4.4.1 Joh. 4.9. The Son is said to be sent, to be the
person that shall procure our redemption, the holy Ghost is said to be sent by
the Father and the Son for the application of those benefits which Christ
purchased for us, Joh. 14.16. and 16.7.

Secondly, This sending of Christ does not relate to him as the second person

Thirdly, It signifies the authoritative mission, and calling him to that work,
Heb. 5.5. and 7.21.

Fourthly, That the Father did not only call him to this wonderful employment,
Psalm. 45.7. Joh. 6.27. Col. 1.19.

Fifthly, That the Fountain from which our salvation does arise, is the mere

Sixthly, That he is under an Office, and obligation of trust, and
faithfulness: therefore command he had from the Father, implying that if he
did not accomplish all for which he was sent, he should be guilty of
unfaithfulness, and disobedience.

Seventhly, Yet we are not to think that this is done against Christ's will, as
if Psalm. 40.8.

Eighthly, We may consider of a two fold Office that Christ was sent to, which

1. There is the Office of a Mediator, whereby he was sent to save his people
from their sins, which is the sending most spoken of in Scripture.

2. There is a sending as a Prophet to teach, and guide his Church: So Joh.
17.18. and he does not teach only externally, but internally by giving a seeing
eye and understanding heart.

Quest. What necessity was there of Christ to be thus sent?

Answ. First, Had not the Father thus sent Christ into the world, there had

Secondly, Herein the grace, mercy, and goodness of God appears, in that

Thirdly, Christ mission is the original, and root of all the Churches mission
Joh. 20.21. For Christ being sent, is thereby made the head of his Church, as
Church power is seated in him as the original, and therefore all the missions
of Church Officers now is reduced to this as the Fountain of all, therefore
they are called the Ministers of Christ, the Ambassadors of Christ, they
administer all in his name, and every thing is done by his authority, Matthew.
28.18, etc.

Fourthly, Take notice of the compleatness, and perfection of this mission,
Heb. 1.1. that since Christ's mission we are not now to expect any other
extraordinary missions, Christ came as the fullness of all.

Gal. 4.4. called the fullness of time, when the Church of the Jews was become
like a wilderness, when all the former Prophets were forgotten, when there was
an universal blackness upon the Church, then Christ came.

viz. in a humble, low, and contemptible way in the eyes of the world: so that
none took him to be the Messiah.

Quest. What are we to consider about Christ's Priestly Office?

Answ. First, That it did consist in offering up himself a Sacrifice: every



Joh. 17. 2. Now he is in heaven he intercedes for us: His prayers on earth
were attended with great cries, and groans, and debasing of himself: but this
in Heaven is nothing but the presentation of his will, that what he had prayed
for, and obtained for his people* should be applied to them.

Melchizedech, Psalm. 110.4. Heb. 7.17. which does imply.

1. The conjoyning of the Kingly power to the Priesthood, which was forbidden
by the Lord: King Uzziah was smitten for meddling with the Priests Office. Had
Christ only sanctified himself to be a Priest for us, without this Kingly
Office, we should still be under the power of our lusts, and should have wanted
a Spiritual Prince of glory, against that Prince of darkness.

2. It implies the spirituality of his Priesthood: For Melchizedek, though a
Priest, yet he brought only bread and wine to Abraham to refresh him so: Christ
after that bodily oblation of himself, has now appointed his children no other
but spiritual sacrifices.

3. There is employed the perpetuity of it: there is no abolition, or
translation of this Office to any other.

4. This Priestly Office was confirmed by an oath, Heb. 7.21, Every word of God
is as sure as his oath, but this was done to establish our faith: for its the
hardest thing in the world for a soul troubled with sin, to believe that Christ
has made such an atonement, and purchased reconciliation: therefore God did
not only promise, but swore it.

Quest. What are we further to consider about the Priesthood of Christ?

Answ. First, That Christ is not only the Priest, but the Sacrifice it self: He
offered up himself in the bloody and ignominious death of the Cross for our
sakes.

Priest he was in both his Natures as God and Man: Sacrifice he was in his
humane nature, because that only could suffer: and Altar he was in respect of
his Divine nature, because by that he was sanctified.

or anihilation of the thing to the honor and glory of God: so Christ suffered
both in soul and body, in those exquisite torments which were upon him; he was
wounded all over for our transgressions.

Fourthly, that Christ offered up his body as a sacrifice to God: For its
unlawful

Fifthly, this sacrifice was by way of expiation, and propitiation to atone,
and

Sixthly, the holy and ^ust nature of God against sin is such, that there was

Quest. What are the properties of Christ's sacrifice?

Answ. First, it had infinite worth in it: So that if God had so ordained, it
would have procured reconciliation for all the sins of all mankind, and Romans
8.33, 34.

2. Its of infinite worth in respect of the gracious readiness, and
willingness of him that did offer it.

3. It had infinite worth in respect of the thing offered, which was no less
then the precious body and blood of Christ himself.

Secondly, though Christ offered up himself a sacrifice, yet the appplication
of

Thirdly, that hence Christ's blood does not only wash away the guilt Tit.
2.14. So that none can plead the justifying efficacy of Ch^ists death, that
have not also the sanctifying efficacy of it.

Fourthly, though Christ offered up himself but once, yet the virtue, and power

Fifthly, that its continually useful and necessary, because we renew our

Sixthly, consider the certain success, and prevalency of it to reconcile

Seventhly, its that sacrifice which Christ presents to his Father.

Eighthly, the purity of this is not to be forgotten: Christ is a Lamb without
Pet. 1.19. For as we must have a Priest without sin, so a sacrifice without in
infinitum.

Ninthly, the virtue of this sacrifice is to make us like Christ himself: He

Quest. How is Christ the cause of our sanctification?

Ans. First, efficiently: For not only the Father, and Spirit, but Christ
himself The Life; because he gives all supernatural life to his: and the vine,
John 15.1. because as the branch separated from the vine can bring forth no
fruit, so neither we without Christ: as also the Author and finisher of faith,
Heb. 12.2. Of his fullness we all receive, etc. Joh. 1.16.

Romans 7.8.

i. e. Christ received and applied by faith, does in a most inward, and
intimate manner live in us, and thereby strengthens us: Hence, Gal. 2.20. I no
longer live, but Christ in me. For by faith we are united to him, and so he
becomes our Head from whom we have all spiritual influx.

Fourthly, Christ is the final cause of our sanctification, i. e. we are made
to know nothing but Christ crucified, 1 Cor. 2.1.

Quest. Did Christ do as much for one believer as for another?

Answ. Yea, as will appear if we consider these things.

1. Christ as mediator did receive all equally into his charge, and trust; the
Father gave such a number of persons, neither more, nor less to Christ, to
purchase their salvation, and every one of these he did exactly know: For to
him, as God, all things past and to come are present.

2. As thus Christ in a Mediatory way received every one to his charge, and
trust so in the discharge of it, he had an equal respect to all, not willing
the salvation of one believer more then another.

3. In respect of the effects and fruits of his Mediatory love, in some
particulars all are alike, as in justification; all believers stand alike
justified through the blood of Christ, all are accepted of, and beloved of
Christ alike. Though its true, one is more justified then another extensively,
but not intensively, i. e. one has more sin forgiven then another; yet
Christ's righteousness is the same in it self to all: As the light of the Sun
is the same to every star, though one star partaketh more of it then another.

4. In the application of Christ's benefits there is no regard to external
temporal differences, so that a poor weak Christian may enjoy more of God and
Christ then the richest, or learned in the world.

5. Christ's gracious promises, which are for the maine the substance of the
covenant of Grace, are equal to all his. Indeed there are peculiar promises,
which are made either to some high degrees of grace, or to some in their
peculiar promises, which are made either to some high degrees of grace, or to
some in their peculiar relations, or sufferings for Christ, which do not belong
to all; but the Covenant of Grace, which is the substance of all promises, i^
offered, and fulfilled in one Believer as well as in another: For, 2 Corinthians.
1.20.

Object. But such glorious promises do no not belong to me, I am so poor and
unworthy? though others may claim them, yet I may not?

Answ. Hereby thou chargest Christ sinfully and foolishly: Is not Christ's
promise universal to every one that is heavy laden, Matthew. 11.28. why do thou
except when Christ does not, says he, not clearly, Him that comes to me, I
will in no wise cast out, John 6.37. though nexer so miserable, wretched and
sinful.

Object. But we cannot go to him?

Answ. John 6.37. All that the Father gives me, shall come to me. Christ will
not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, Matthew. 12.22. Yea, the
promise of perseverance is to every godly man, as well as to any, 1 Pet. 1.5.

6. Christ's power, protection, care is to one as well as to another, though he
may suffer some to be more afflicted, Heb. 13.5.

Quest. But does not Christ love a strong Christian more then a weak one.

Answ. In some particulars the poor weak Christian has more love and
affection from Christ then a strong one.

1. Christ commonly shows more pity and compassion to such as are objects of
greater want and indigency. He gently leads those that are with young.

2. His protection, and preservation of such is more peculiar, and emphatical;
the weaker thou art, the greater is Gods power and grace manifested in thee, 2
Cor. 12.9. He is the Father of the Fatherless: when we are weak, then are we
strong.

3. He does commonly vouchsafe more inward comforts, and evidences of his love
to such, and gives them more cheerfulness and joy* yea, new converts have many
times more joy then they have all their life after.

4. God does in a singular manner keep them from those exercises and tentations
which many times he lets to fall upon those that are more eminent, John 21.18.

5. Though they are weak in some things, yet Christ makes them remarkably
strong in some other things; the Apostles for fear fled from Christ, when Mary
followed him to the cross.

6. To the weak, God has made glorious promises for the increase of their
grace, Isa. 40.31. Mat. 5 6. Zach. 12.8.

7. God sanctifies these infirmities and weaknesses to them, so that they get
more good by their weak graces, then others do by their strong. Its better to
be a babe in grace, fearing to fall, then presumptuous, as Peter was.

Quest. Is there then no difference between believers in respect of the fruits
of Christ's death?

Answ. Yes: For,

First, though justification be alike, yet their sanctification is not: one is
more holy then another: as one star differs from another in glory, so do
Christians aeque, but not aequaliter: the measure and degree is different.

Secondly, as sanctifying, so common gifts which are for service, God gives
Ephesians. 4.16. 1 Cor. 12.4. there be diversity of operations, yet but one spirit.

Thirdly, the means of grace are likewise differently administered: Some live

Fourthly, their tentations, either inward or outward, are very different: all
Paul had. Obadiah lived quietly in Ahabs Court, when Elijah was pursued to
death, Rev. 2.10. the Devil shall cast some, not all, into prison; yet in these
different administrations all believers may take the same essential comfort,
and look for the same substantial happiness.

Quest. What are we to consider about the glory of Christ?

Answ. That the glory which Christ has, he communicates it one way or other to
his children: If the head be crowned with glory, it redounds to all the body.
Yet to understand this aright, consider

1. That the glory which Christ has, as it is personally and subjectively his,
so its incommunicable. For if that should be made ours, we should be the only
begotten Sons of God, Mediators, and Saviors, etc.

2. We must consider a difference of those effects of glory which Christ
vouchsafes to his. One instance of glory was to work miracles; this was part
of the glory that was common to Christ and others: yet it was communicated only
to some of the Apostles and believers in the primitive times: yea to some to
whom he was not an head in a spiritual and saving manner; yet herein was there
a great difference between Christ and believes, he wrought them in his own
name, and power, they through the name of Christ.

2. There are some things which Christ did that are made legally ours: God
accounts it as if we had done them. So Christ's sufferings to take away the
curse of the Law, and his obedience to the rule of the Law is made ours; and
therefore by his obedience we are said to be made righteous.

3. There are glorious privileges which Christ has, and he gives them to us
also; we are sons as well as he, yea, coheirs with him in glory, Romans 8.17.
we shall reign with him, be raised up, sit on Thrones of glory with him, judge
the world with him; as he has a rod of iron to break the Nations with, so
shall the Saints have, Rev. 2.26, 27.

4. There is the sanctification of our natures by grace: and as Christ was
sanctified, so also does he sanctify us: he sanctified himself for this end,
and of his fullness we all receive, Joh. 1.16. So, 2 Cor. 3.18. and 4.6. For he
made himself a sacrifice, not only to remove the guilt of sin, but to subdue
it* to make us holy as well as happy.

Quest. How came Christ, being God, to pray to the Father? For by this the
Arians, and Socinians would prove him not to be God? For say they, why should
he pray that could do what he pleased?

Answ. Christ, though God, yet as man he did pray to the Father, and that for
these Reasons.

1. Because as man he was not omnipotent, and so his humane will was not able
to accomplish what he desired, in which respect it was that as man he prayed.

2. Christ as man was subject to the Law of God, and so was bound to give that
service, and religious worship to God which the Law required, and therefore his
praying was the fulfilling of a duty which he had voluntarily submitted to. So
was his baptism, Mat. 3.15.

3. Though all things were due to him, yet by the ordination of God, he could
not partake of them but by prayer. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen
for thy inheritance, etc. Psalm. 2.8. Prayer is appointed both to Christ and us
as the medium whereby Gods purpose is brought to pass.

4. Christ prayed upon the same ground as he gave thanks: He praised God as the
Father of such mercies as his soul was affected with, and so he prayed to God
for such things as he had not yet the full accomplishment of.

5. Christ prayed for our example, that we should imitate him.

Quest. What then is the difference between Christ's prayer, and ours?

Answ. First, if we speak absolutely of Christ as a person, so he needed not to
pray: For so being God as well as man, he could have done all things the humane
nature desired without any humble supplication to the Father: but its otherwise
with us.





Fourthly, all that he could pray for was in reference to his body, and the
further glorification of that, he having taken our infirmities upon him: Its
not so with us.

Quest. Isa. 53.3. Its said, that Christ had no form or comeliness: Is this so?

Answ. First, To God he was altogether desirable, the only beloved, and comely
in his sight, and without whose grace none is beauteous in Gods eye, Psalm. 11.7.

Secondly, He had form and comeliness to the admiration of the good Angels,
Holy, holy, holy, when they beheld the Majesty of his beauty.

Thirdly, The Devils spied a beauty in him, when they acknowledged him to be
the Son of the high God, Luke 8.28.

Fourthly, Believers, who are the most clear-sighted in the world, acknowledge
altogether the fair, and the chiefest of ten thousand, Cant. 5.10, 16. and 7.6.

Fifthly, The eyes of unbelievers will one day be opened to see his beauty,
P^ul, Nichodemus, etc. or in the day of judgment, 2 These. 1.10. when he shall
appear in glory.

Quest. Whether was Christ in his face, and outward feature beautiful, as Psalm.
45.2. thou art fairer then the children of men?

Answ. That Text speaks not of his outward beauty, but of his inward, and
spiritual beauty, by reason of his wisdom, holiness, righteousness, meekness,
etc. yet its very probable that in his body he had much comeliness: For these
reasons.

1. The Jews never twitted him with any corporal deformity, which they would
out of malice have done, if he had had any deformity.

2. He was not subject to any miscarriages in his conception, or birth, whence
weakness, and deformities ensue.

3. He was not subject to diseases which come by sin, and often deface the
beauty of the body, nor to any intemperance in life, which spoils the
comeliness, and color. Indeed Christ took some universal infirmities of man,
as hunger, thirst, mortality, etc. but he took no particular infirmities, of
blindness, lamenesse, etc, He that was perfect God, was made also perfect man.
Some think, and that very probably, that the first and second Adam were as
comely, and well featured in body as ever any in the world: being both formed
without sin, and without man, and being more immediately completed, and
perfected by God.

Quest. How, and why should God hide his face from his Son, seeing he loved him
always? and when he cried out that he was forsaken, did he cease to be God, or
to be in God?

Answ. God did not hide his face from him, as he was his Son, but as he was our
surety in the room of sinners: He hid not his face from Christ as man, but as a
Mediator.

Again, it was not the Godheads forsaking Christ according to Essence, but
according to sense. It was not a total, absolute, and final forsaking, but
only partial, and for a short time. Calverts mel Caeli.

Quest. What are the parts of Christ's Office?

Answ. That he is a Prophet, a Priest, and a King, Christ revealed, and
reveals to the Elect the whole counsel of God, as a Prophet. He procured, and
procures for them all the good therein revealed as a Priest: what he revealed
as a Prophet, and procured as a Priest, but as yet is unaplyed, he applied, and
applies as a King.

Quest. Why are the parts of his Office mentioned in this order?

Answ. First, in respect of man, whose ignorance is healed by him as a Prophet,
his alienation as a Priest, his impotencie to subjection, as a King.





Quest. How is Christ a Mediator?

Answ. He is a Mediator of our Salvation, but not of our Election.

Quest. Does it not imply inferiority to be a Mediator?

Answ. Christ, in respect of the Divine Nature is equal with God, Phil. 2.6.
but in respect of his Office, and the humane nature, both which the word Christ
precisely taken, holds out to us, he is inferior to the Father, Joh. 14.28.

Object. Christ being both God and Mediator, which is an Office implying
inferiority, it follows from hence, that Christ is inferior to himself?

Answ. Christ as Mediator is inferior to himself as God, inequality in
respect of Office, consists with equality in respect of Nature, and Persons.

Object. Christ being both God and Mediator, it follows that Christ is a
Mediator to himself.

Answ. A Mediator is so either properly, or Analogically. Properly who
reconcileth others unto others. Analogically who reconcileth others to himself:
As he that does justice unto another, exercises justice properly: but he that
does justice unto himself, exercises justice proportionably: Christ performs
the part of God accepting, and of a Mediator reconciling, in a diverse respect.

Object. But 1 Timothy 2.5. There is one God and one Mediator, the Man Christ.
Hence it seems that Christ is Mediator as man, not as God-man?

Answ. The word man here is not taken in an abstracted sense, for the humane
nature alone, but in a concrete sense, signifying the Person, and Nature, yea
both Natures together. So also, Acts 20.28.

Object. If Christ as God-man be Mediator, then the Divine nature subsisting
in the relation of the Son, received the Office of Mediator, and consequently
something may be added to God, but nothing can be added to God, because he is
perfection itself?

Answ. The Divine Nature received not the Office, as considered in it self, but
in respect of its voluntary dispensation, as accepting of subsistence with the
humane Nature, i. e. Christ received and sustained the Office of Mediator, not
as God alone, nor as man alone, but as God-man: the Divine Nature in respect of
its voluntary dispensation: the Humane Nature properly. To the Divine Nature
there is not any thing added, only a relation: but to the Humane Nature there
is added a real change.

Quest. What are the principal effects, and consequents of the personal union,
in respects of Christ Manhood?

Answ. First, the grace of eminency, whereby the Manhood in respect of this
personal union is exalted far above all Creatures, and now sits at the
right hand of God.

Secondly, Created habitual grace, which Christ received out of measure, Joh.
3.34. It was in him in his full latitude in four respects.

1. In respect of its subject, here it is to be found in its proper subject, as
light in the Sun.

2. In respect of its nature: there is in Christ all kind of grace.

3. In respect of the intensenesse of it: its in him in the highest degree,
both negatively, it could not be exceeded, and positively, none was equal to it.

4. In regard of the effects, that he might be fit to derive unto his members
all that measure, and fullness of Grace that becomes such an Head; Grace in the
Elect is the same in kind, with that created Grace that is in Christ.

Thirdly Created power, which also is out of measure, the power of working
miracles was in Christ as man constantly, and permanently after the manner of
an habit; not so in the Prophets, and Apostles. Yea the humanity of Christ,
besides its inherent power, which exceeds also other creatures, is also an
instrument of the Divinity, which is Omnipotent: Hence, Christ as man could,
and can do whatsoever he pleases either by his Inherent power, or as an
instrument of the Divinity: Hence he received that complete authority of
executing all power both in heaven and earth, Matthew. 28.18.

Fourthly, Created knowledge. Knowledge in Christ is either increated, which is
in him as God: whereby he knows all things, Joh. 2.25. or created, which is
in him as man, and is of three sorts. Beatificall, Infused, and Experimental:

1. Beatificall knowledge is called the knowledge of vision, whereby he does
not only see God face to face, as the rest of the Saints do, but sees also the
Manhood in personal union with the Godhead: the knowledge of the blessed, and
the torment of the cursed: of it, Joh. 1.18. its principle is the perfect
understanding of the manhood: Its medium, the light of glory.

2. Infused, whereby he knows all things that can be known by the concreated
abilities of Angels or men: Of it, Isa, 11.2. Its principle is an habit infused
by God: Its medium, the light of grace.

3. Experimental, whereby he knows all things that can be known by practice,
and rational observation of events: of it, Luke 2.25. Its principle, the
faculty of reason: Its medium, personal experience, Heb. 5.6. and observation
of reiterated events by the light of reason. Christ's beatifical knowledge
admits not of increase, in respect either of the habit, or act. His infused
knowledge admitted not of increase, in respect of habit, though it might in
respect of the act. His experimental knowledge seems to have admitted increase
both in respect of the habit, and act, He grew in wisdom as in stature, Luke
20.40, 52.

Fifthly, The right of Divine Adoration, Heb. 1.6. Rev. 5.8. Yet we are not to
worship with Divine worship the Manhood as considered in itself,

Sixthly, Communication of properties, which is a manner of speech, whence

Seventhly, Capablenesse of the Office of a Mediator.

Quest. What is the state wherein the Lord Jesus executed the Office of

Answ. Either the state of Humiliation, or Exaltation.

The estate of Humiliation, continued from the time of his Incarnation to his
resurrection.

The estate of Exaltation began at his Resurrection, and continues for ever.

Quest. What are the degrees of his Exaltation?

Answ. His resurrection opposite to his death: His ascension into heaven,
opposite to his descention into the grave: his sitting at the right hand of the
Majesty of God ( i. e. in a state of glory, next to the glory of God himself)
opposite to the continuing in the grave.

Quest. What is Christ thus in glory now doing?

Answ. Executing his Mediatory Office, not in a condition of humiliation, as
when here, but in a manner suitable to his state of glory.

Quest. How does he now execute the Prophetical part of his Office?

Answ. By sending forth the Ministry, giving gifts, and making the improvement
thereof effectual for the calling home, and building up his Elect, Matthew.
28.18, etc. Ephesians. 4.11, etc.

Quest. How does he execute the Priestly part of his Office?

Answ. First, By appearing in the presence of God for us, Heb. 9 24.

Romans 8.34. H^b. 7.25.

Joh. 2.1.

Fourthly, By declaring it to be his constant will, and desire that the benefit
Heb. 7.25. and 10.10.

Note. Some hold that Christ still in heaven as man, does pray to God the
Father, properly, and formally in respect of his Church, whence, say they, he
is called an Advocate with the Father, and is said, still to make intercession
for us: yet not that he prays in so servile and humble a manner as he did
whilst here, yet (say they) its more then a mere presenting of himself, or his
will that the Father fulfill what he has purchased: Its a true, and formal
praying, neither (say they) is this any more indecent or unbeseeming Christ as
man in Heaven, then praising of God, which yet as man he does.

Quest. How does he exercise the Kingly part of his Office?

Answ. By applying unto his Elect by his Spirit, what he reveals as a
Prophet, and purchased as a Priest, by ruling in his Elect by his Word, and
Spirit, together with defending them from his and their enemies. Mr. Nortons
Orthodox Evangelist.

Quest. How was Christ revealed under the Old Testament?

Answ. The first prophecy of Christ was by God himself given to Adam, Genesis
3.15. the seed of the woman shall break the Serpents head: and Christ was that
seed of the woman, being born of a woman only, a Virgin that had not known a
man: and therefore at the very time when he fulfilled this promise upon the
Cross, he said to his Mother, woman behold thy Son: woman, not Mother, to
intimate that he was the seed of the woman long before spoken of. Abraham also
expected this promised seed, Joh. 8.56. he saw my day, and rejoiced: this was
the soul of the Covenant of God made with him, the seal whereof was
circumcision, an image of his bloodshed. Isaac was a Type of his seed in many
respects.

1. Isaac was born of Sarah, a barren woman, and past childbearing: Jesus was
born of Mary, a Virgin, springing like a branch out of a dry stock: like a
stone hewn out of a Rock without hands, Dan. 2.45.

2. Isaac bare the wood that should have consumed him, Christ bare the Cross on
which he was crucified.

3. Isaac was bound, Jesus was bound.

4. Isaac should have been offered for a Sacrifice, Jesus was offered a
Sacrifice for the sins of the world.

5. Isaac on mount Moriah: Jesus on mount Moriah, as some think.

6. From Isaac arose that proverb, in the mount will the Lord be seen. In Jesus
its much more true: For no man has seen the Father at any time, but the Son,
and he to whom the Son has revealed him: in him we see all the love of God:
For behold what love the Father has given us, in that he has sent his only
begotten Son into the world, that whosoever believes in him might not
perish, etc.

Many such Types had those times, like Prospective Glasses to convey their
glimmering sight to the only object of happiness Christ Jesus. as Jacob, who
got the blessing in his eldest brothers garment. Joseph who was stripped of his
cote, sold by Judahs motion, stood before Pharaoh at thirty years old, whose
core dipped in blood, turned the wrath of his Father from his brethren: even as
Christ was stripped by the Soldiers, sold by Judas treason, stood before God
in his Office about thirty years old, and in whose blood we being dipped, are
delivered from the wrath of God the Father. Thus before the Law: under the Law
we shall find nothing but Christ. The Children of Israel in their journey to
Canaan were guided by a pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night, their day
was something overcast by a cloud, and yet their darkness was something
overcome by a light. Hence Peter compares the word of the Prophets to a light
shining in a dark place, 2 Pet. 1.19. Now all the light they had was borrowed
from Christ, as the Stars do theirs from the Sun, and all lead to Christ
again, as little Rivers to the Ocean. See this

1. In their Sacraments: their ordinary Sacraments were Circumcision, and the
Passover, which both had reference to the same inward grace: For what meant the
bloodshed in Circumcision, and sprinkled on their door-poosts in the
Passover, but the blood of Christ shed for the remission of ^ines, and
sprinkled on our hearts to cleanse us from sin: Christ was the true Paschall
Lamb, in whom therefore the Law of it is fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be
broken, where John calls him, the Lamb of God, etc. Joh. 1.29.

Again the pillar of cloud, and fire, and the Red Sea in which they were
Baptized, as 1 Cor. 10.2. called in the Gospel the Baptism of water, and fire,
signified the effusion of the blood of Christ, and the infusion of his graces:
the merit of his passion, and the efficacy of his Spirit in our hearts to make
it ours by application: The water that came out of the Rock, being smitten with
the Rod, when the people were ready to perish, signified the blood issuing out
of Christ's body in his bloody sweat, when the wrath of God, the Rod of God lay
heavy upon him, when the chastisement of our sins was upon him: so that which
streamed out of his side when pierced by the Soldier, which was spilt for our
sakes, who otherwise had perished.

The Manna wherewith they were sustained in the Wilderness, was Christ, that
Bread of life that descended from Heaven, Joh. 6.35. So 1 Cor. 10.3, 4.

The brazen Serpent figured Christ lift up upon the Cross, and as that saved
all that looked to it being stung with fiery Serpents: So Christ saves us from
the power of the old Serpent the Devil, etc.

2. All the laborious and tedious Paedagogy of their Ceremonies was only to
lead them to Christ, the blood of all their Sacrifices propitiatory, and
gratulatory, of Bullocks, Rams, Goats, Lambs, etc. were all but Types leading
to Christ, who was the true Sacrifice, in which all others were sanctified, and
by which Gods justice is satisfied: and they were so many, in such variety to
seal to them his alsufficiency.

So were all their curious Ablutions, and costly Oblations of Roast, Baked, Sod,
Fried, to teach our perfect washing by his blood, and perfect nourishment by
his body, which suffered the heat of Gods wrath, and so was dressed to our
appetite, and sauced with such diversity to take away our satiety.

The two Goats, one offered as a sacrifice for the sins of the people, the
other, having the sins of all the Congregation confessed over him, was let go
into the wilderness: both which express Christ in a double respect, either
because he was slain that we might escape: or because Christ was dead and is
alive, Rev. 2.8. he dying for our sins, and rising again for our
justification, Romans 4.25.

So in the purgation of the Leper, two birds were to be brought, the one to be
killed, the other to be let fly being first dipped in the blood of the former,
as Christ died for us, and we being dipped in his blood escape death eternal.

3. All their holy persons represented to them their Messiah: their Priests,
especially the High Priest, who sacrificed, and blessed the people in his Name,
in whom all the Nations of the earth were to be blessed. And as the High Priest
bare the names of the Tribes upon his shoulders when he appeared before the
Lord; So did Christ of all his faithful. The High Priest entered into the holy
of holies once a year, not without blood; So did Christ by his own blood open a
way for us in the highest heavens, etc.

4. The holy places also were Teachers of the same truth: As,

(1) The Tabernacle was a visible sign of Gods presence amongst his people,
therefore in it was placed the mercy-seat, even Jesus Christ in whom it pleased
God to have mercy on whom he will have mercy.

(2) So was the Temple, and therefore they were to offer their sacrifices at
the Temple: their prayers were to be in, and toward the Temple, because all
were sanctified and accepted in Christ who was the true Temple: but when Christ
the true light came into the world, all these shadows fled away. Dr. Stoughtons
Christ crucified the tree of life.

Quest. How may it be proved that Christ is true God?

Answ. First, he to whom the name of God does properly belong, he is truly God
or the most high: But the Name of God does properly belong to Christ, therefore
he is God; Christ is called God, so as no creature is, both subjectively, and
by way of attribution.

1. Subjectively. So 2 Samuel 23.3. The God of Israel said, etc. which is a
Prophecy of Christ, and can only be meant of him as our Mediator. So, 1 Timothy
3.16. God was manifested in the flesh.

2. By way of attribution the Name of God is spoken of him. So, Isa. 9.6. The
mighty God, Hos. 1.7. I will save them by the Lord their God: So, John 20.28.
My Lord and my God, Joh. 1.1. The Word was God, Tit. 2.13. The Great God, Romans
9.5. Christ is over all, God blessed for ever. He is called also Jehovah, which
is altogether incommunicable to the creatures: nothing his eternal essence: So,
Rev. 1.4. To him which is, which was, and which is to come. God himself also
makes himself known to his people by this name, Exodus 3.14. I am that I am. So,
Psalm. 83.19. that they may know that thou whose name is Jehovah, etc. which
name is never in Scripture attributed to false gods, or to creatures. Now that
this name Jehovah is ascribed to Christ, appears, Jer. 23.6. He that is our
righteousenesse is Jehovah, the Son of God, and not the Father, who by his
righteousness does move the Lord to justify us. Nor is Christ thus called
alone in that place, but in many others also; as, Isa. 40.3. Prepare ye the way
of Jehovah; which Mark expounds of Christ, Mark 1.2, 3. So, Zach. 11.13.
Jehovah said to me, etc. which Saint Matthew applies to Christ, Matthew. 27.7.
and in that Prophetical Psalm of the Kingdom of Christ, Psalm. 97. Christ is
six times called Jehovah.

Arg. If the Divine attributes do truly properly belong to the Son of God,
then is he truly and properly God: But the Divine attributes do truly, and
properly belong to the Son of God; therefore he is truly God: As eternity is
an attribute which is proper to God alone; and this belongs to the Son of
God, John 1.1. In the beginning was the Word: Now if Christ was before the
Creation, he must then needs be from all Eternity: For before the Creation
there was nothing but God. So Prove. 8.22, 23. The Lord possessed me (wisdom)
before his works of old, I was from everlasting. Now that Christ is called
Wisdom, appears, Luke 7.35. and 11.49. So, John 17.5. Glorify me with the
glory which I had with thee before the world, and Rev. 1.8. I am Alpha and
Omega, the first and the last, which was, and which is, and which is to come,
Rev. 22.13. I am the beginning and the end. Now these titles do belong to God,
Isa. 41.4. and 44.6. and 48.12. So, John 8.58. before Abraham was, I am:
compared with, Exodus 3.14. I am that I am.

Again, he is Omnipresent, Mat. 28.20. Lo I am with you always, etc. So Rev.
1.13. and 2.1. He is in the midst of the golden Candlesticks.

So also he is omniscient, which is peculiar to God. 1 King. 8.39. 2 Chronicles.
6.30. Prove. 15.11. Act. 1.24. Now that this properly belongs to Christ is
proved, John 21.17. Lord thou know all things, etc. So, Joh. 2.25. 1 John
3.20. Rev. 2.23.

He is also Omnipotent, which is peculiar to God: Hence, 1 Cor. 1.24. he is
called the Power of God, and Isa. 9.6. the Mighty God, Tit. 2.13. the great
God, Hos. 12.5. the Lord of Hosts. So, Zach. 2.8.

Again, absolute power to work so as he will is peculiar to God: but this title
belongs to the Son of God, Joh. 5.21. He raises and quickneth whom he
pleases, and John 10.28. I give to my sheep eternal life, John 17.24. Father I
will that those which thou have given me may be where I am, etc.

Also predestination of some to eternal life is peculiar to God, which also is
attributed to Christ, Joh. 13.18. I know whom I have chosen, John 15.19. I have
chosen you out of the world; and this election was before the foundation of the
world, Ephesians. 1.4.

3. Arg. Its proved by comparing parallel Texts of the Old and New Testament
Numb. 14.12. and 21.5. I will smite them with the pestilence, etc. which Saint
Paul expounds of Christ, 1 Cor. 10.9. The people tempted Christ, and were
destroyed of Serpents. So, Psalm. 102.26. O my God take me not away in the midst
of my days: Of old thou have laid the foundations of the earth, etc. which is
applied to Christ, Heb. 1.10. So, Isa. 6.5. etc. Mine eyes have seen the Lord
of Hosts: then follows, Make the heart of this people fat, etc. which was
accomplished in Christ, Joh. 12.37, 41.

Again, Isa. 25.6, 7, 9. Hos. 13.14. the Lord of Hosts will make a feast, etc.
he will swallow up death in victory; which is meant of the Lord Christ, 1 Cor.
15.54, 57. Rev. 21.19. Isa. 25.9.

So, Isa. 35 4. Your God will come and save you, and v. 5. then the eyes of the
blind shall be opened, etc. which shows that it must be meant of Christ, and
his miracles, as Luke 7.22. So, Joh. 1.34.

Again, Isa. 40.3. Prepare the way of the Lord, etc. meant of Christ, Matthew.
3.3, etc. Isa. 40.8. the Word of God abides for ever, i. e. the Gospel of
Christ, 1 Pet. 1.25. Mat. 24.35. So, Isa. 40.10, 11. -- his reward is with him:
applied to Christ, Rev. 22.12.

So, Isa. 44.6. Thus says the Lord and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, I am
the first and the last, and thus Christ described himself, Rev. 1.17.

So, Isa. 45.23. -- Every knee shall bow to me, etc. applied to Christ, Romans
14.10, 11. Phil. 2.10.

Again, Isa. 8.14. -- He shall be for a stone of stumbling, etc. applied to
Christ, Luke 2.34. Romans 9.30.31. 1 Pet. 2.8.

4. Arg. Is drawn from the relation betwixt his sacred person, and God the
Father: Christ is the Son of God, and that not as Angels, and men, by
Creation, or regeneration, but by eternal generation: and the Father, and the
Son have the same individual substance: The Father begets the Son without
change, or motion, after a most glorious and wonderful manner within himself,
and essentially one with himself: Yea, this relation is coaeval with the
essence, as he is always God, so he is always Son, Psalm. 27. This day have I
begotten thee, this day is the day of Eternity, Micah 5.2. the goings forth of
him -- have been of old from everlasting. For this reason he is said to be the
proper Son of God, Romans 8.32. and God his proper Father, John 5.18. He is
called the only begotten Son of God, John 1.18. and 3.16. 1 John 4.9. then he
is not created. Hence he is called the first born of every creature, Col. 1.15.
As man he was a creature, but as God he was before every creature. He is called
the image of his Fathers person, Heb. 1.5. For, as when we look our selves in a
glass, our image like our selves is naturally produced: So when God with the
eye of his understanding, beholds (if we may so speak) the glass of the divine
nature from everlasting to everlasting, there results the Son, an essential
image of himself: So then he is the natural Son of God; and by that divine way
of the Fathers communicating of his divine essence, by eternal generation; as
may be further proved by the titles that God the Father gives him by calling
him his Son, which is a title that advances Christ above all creatures; and
Christ calls himself the Son of God, John 5.18. For which the Jews charged him
with blasphemy, John 10.33, 34.

Arg. We are enjoined in Scripture to worship Christ with that religious
adoration which is properly and solely due to the everliving God, therefore he
is God, nor will the Lord give this his glory to any other, Isa. 42.8. and
48.11. Hence, John 5.23. He that honors not his Son which is sent, honors
not the Father which sent him.

There are diverse honors which are Gods peculiars, and they all belong to
Christ: as,

1. Religious worship in Spirit, which is the exhibiting of that reverence and
worship which is due to the great God, in all places, at all times, and in all
things: But this spiritual worship is to be exhibited to our Lord Christ, Psalm.
97.7. Worship him all ye gods, and Rev. 1.6. Saint John ascribes to him Glory,
and Dominion for ever and ever. So, Rev. 5.13. and 14.7. and Romans 9.5. He is
over all, God blessed for ever.

Again, the high God alone is the object of Religious invocation, Psalm. 50.15.
and they are idolaters which call on them that are not true gods, Gal. 4.8. Yea
religious invocation is Gods glory which he will give to none other, Isa. 42.8.
But it is to be given to Christ, Acts 7.59. and 9.14, 21. 1 Cor. 1.2. Rev.
22.20. Hence I argue, That person that knows the hearts of all, and hears the
prayers of all in the world, is the true God: But Christ does so, therefore he
is true God.

Again, its an honor peculiar to the true God, to be the object of religious
trust and confidence: but Jesus Christ is the object of religious trust and
confidence, therefore he is the true God.

Arg. To swear is a part of religious service when performed in truth, in
righteousness, and in judgment, which analogically is ascribed to Christ
himself. Hence the argument is,

That person that is the object of a religious Oath is God, Deuteronomy. 6.13. Thou
shall swear by his name, who is a most infallible witness, judge and avenger
of all perjured persons, and such as use his name either rashly or falsely: But
Christ is the object of a religious oath, and because he has no greater to
swear by, he swears by himself, Isa. 45.23. I have sworn by my self that to
me every knee shall bow. Here Christ swears by himself, and the words
immediately foregoing, v. 22. I am God, and besides me there is none other:
Saint Paul expounds those words of Christ, Romans 14.10. Before whose tribunal
every knee must bow, and by bowing of every knee, he proves that we must all
stand before the tribunal of Christ, therefore Christ is God.

7. Arg. Divine service is only due to God, Deuteronomy. 6.13. repeated by Christ,
Mat. 4.10. Inward, and outward service which is absolute, illimited, and
universal Dan. 7.14. Psalm. 2.10, 11, 12. and this was foretold, Psalm. 72.11.
All Kings shall fall down before him, and all Nations shall serve him. Hence
also, Luke 19.27. and John 12.29. Yea, the holy Angels are bound to serve him,
Dan. 7.10. Heb. 1.6. therefore he is God.

8. Arg. The maker of heaven, and earth, and all things in them is the true
Genesis 1.1. Isa. 48.12. Exodus 20.11. Jer. 10.11, 12. Now that Christ is the maker
of heaven and earth, is proved, Joh. 1.13. All things were made by him, and
ver. 10. there was nothing that was not made by him, Col. 1.16. All things were
made by Christ, things visible, and invisible, etc.

9. Arg. He that is the preserver of all things is God: But Christ is the
preserver Neh. 9.5. without him all things would fall back to nothing, Romans
11.36. Of him, and for him, and to him are all things. Now that this
conservation is the work of our Lord Christ, appears, Heb. 1.2, 3. and 6.5. and
2.5. Col. 1.17. with v. 15, 16. Joh. 5.17. My Father works hitherto, and I
work.

10. Arg. Infallible knowledge, and prediction of future events which are
merely Ps. 139.2. Act. 15.18. Now that this is peculiar to God only, appears,
Isa. 41.23. Hence he is called a God of Knowledge, 1 Samuel 2.3. and infinite in
understanding, Psalm. 147.5. But our Savior Christ foreknew, and foretold
things to come, Luke 22.8. Mar. 2.8. Joh. 24.25. therefore he is God.

11. Arg. He that works miracles by his own power, is God: But Christ wrought
miracles by his own power, therefore he is God: Now that miracles are Psalm.
78.17. the Lord above does wondrous works: This is implied, 2 Kin. 5.7. am I a
God to kill, and make alive? That Christ wrought miracles when, and where he
pleased, appears in very many instances; the Apostles could not do so, as
appears, Act. 8.28. 2 Timothy 4.20. they could not raise their friends from the
bed of sickness. Its Gods property alone to do what he pleases, Psalm. 115.3.
Yea, Christ wrought such miracles by his own power, as never man wrought, John.
9.32. Yea, he raised up his own dead body. Hence, Joh. 15.24. If I do not the
works which no man ever did, etc. Yea, Christ did the same works which his
Father did, and after the same manner, Joh. 5.17. Yea, he wrought his miracles
by his own power and virtue, Mark 4.39. Yea, he gave power to others to work
miracles in his name, Mark 16, 17, 18. Act. 2. and 3.12, 16. Yea, Christ by his
working of miracles was demonstrated to be the Son of God, and equal with the
Father, Joh. 5.18, 19. Mat. 9.5. See Act. 4.10.

12. Arg. It was requisite that Christ should not only be a true man, but very
Jesus, and he is so called from the end, which is most excellent, to save men
from their sins, and hell, and to confer righteousness and life upon all
believers: and the name Messiah, and Christ import his offices, which are the
divinely instituted means to attain that end, viz. the salvation of men's
souls. A mere creature Priest, a mere creature Prophet, and a mere creature
King could not perform those several actions which were necessarily to be done
by Christ, who was a Priest, a King and a Prophet, all three meeting happily in
him, and in him alone. Christ in regard of his Priestly office, which was after
the order of Melchizedeck) offered up his body as a propitiatory sacrifice by
his eternal spirit, to reconcile us to God his Father, to obtain remission of
sins, spiritual graces, and life eternal by an alsufficient price laid down
for us. Indeed God is said to love the world, and from thence to give his Son
to die for the Elect, Joh. 3.16. and freely to forgive all our sins: but this
is not opposite to the merits and satisfaction of Christ which belong to him as
a Priest, and Sacrifice: For we must consider a double reference of Gods love;
One toward the creature, the other toward his justice, and hatred of sin. God
would have his Son to satisfy them both with due recompense. He satisfied his
love to the sinful creature, when he gave his Son to be our Mediator: He
satisfied his love to justice, and hatred of sin, when he gave his Son to die
for us, and by his blood to expiate our sin: He satisfied his love to the
creature, because out of love he forgives sins freely in regard of the
creature, though he laid the punishment on his dear Son to satisfy his
justice: For notwithstanding his love to justice, and hatred of sin, he out of
his love to his Elect forgives their sins, and gives them eternal life, in
which respect it may be truly said, God satisfied himself, and appeased himself
in his beloved Son. Now the blood of a mere man could not satisfy Gods justice
for those innumerable and gross sins which man had committed against the
infinite Majesty of God: The Church is redeemed by the blood of God, Acts
20.28. Not was it sufficient that Christ should be a Savior in regard of
merit, but he must be so also in regard of efficacy; and he executes his
offices most powerfully and gloriously, being exalted (after he had overcome
death) above all principalities and powers, where he is our advocate, yea, such
an advocate as can plead the worthiness of his person, his perfect obedience,
and meritorious sufferings, and can do whatever he pleases to promote our
happiness: Hence,

1. Conversion, illumination, and all saving graces are his free gift, Joh.
5.26. and Paul often prays, Grace, and peace from God the Father, and from Jesus
Christ.

2. He governs them by his holy Laws, protects them by his grace, and power,
and singularly cares for them as his precious jewels, is tenderly affected to
them as a father to the child, etc. John 10.28. and b^ings them at last to his
eternal inheritance, 1 Pet. 1.5.

3. He sends his holy Spirit to dwell in them, and to be their comforter, and
this proves him also to be the true God, in that he can send the holy Ghost,
who is also the ever living God.

4. As he quickened his own body, so he will raise them up at the last day:
Hence he calls himself, the resurrection and the life, Joh. 6.40. So, 1 Cor.
15.21, 22.

5. He will send his Angels to gather them together, and shall pass sentence
on the Devils and the wicked, and force every knee to bow to him, Isa. 45.23.
Romans 14.10, 11. Tit. 2.13.

6. He will give unto his sheep eternal life, Joh. 10.28. and 17.24.

See all these Arguments enlarged, and vindicated from all the cavils, and
objections of the adversaries by Mr. Estwick in his answer to Bidle.

Quest. How far forth are the actions of Christ to be imitated by us?

Answ. For answer hereunto we must distinguish of Christ's actions: As,

1. Such as were done by his divine omnipotency, as all his miracles were:
These are admirandae, and adorandae, non imitandae: To be admired, and adored,
not to be imitated.

2. Such as were done by his prerogative. As his sending for the Ass without
his owners consent: These are amandae, non imitandae: To be loved, not to be
imitated.

3. The actions of his Mediatorship: as his dying for sin, rising from the
dead, ascending into heaven, etc. These are not to be imitated but only
analogically: Thus, as he died for sin, we must die to sin: As he rose again,
so we must rise to newness of life: As he ascended into heaven: so must we
daily in our Meditations, and affections: As he was a King, so must we be to
conquer our lusts; As he was a Priest, so must we be to offer up spiritual
sacrifices. 1. Of a contrite heart, Psalm. 51.17. 2. Of righteousness, Psalm.
51.19. 3. Of praise, Heb. 13.15. 4. Of alms, Heb. 13.16. 5. Of our selves, our
souls, and bodies, Romans 12.1. As he was a Prophet, so must we be to instruct
our families.

4. His ministerial actions, wherein especially two things are considerable.

1. His unction, or fitting with gifts. 2. His mission and sending by his
Father: and these are to teach Ministers not to run before they be gifted by
God, and sent by the mediate means of the Presbytery.
5. His natural actions, as eating, drinking, sleeping, etc. wherein, though we
do the same, yet we cannot be said to do them in imitation of him, because we
do them by a natural instinct.

6. His occasional, and accidental actions: As his instituting, and celebrating
of the Sacrament at night and after supper, and in an upper room, etc. His
being baptized in a River, etc. These we are not to imitate him in.

7. His moral actions of piety, and holiness, and these especially we are to
imitate him in, and to walk as he walked, 1 John 2.6.

Quest. How is the whole work of our salvation carried on by Christ?

Answ. As he is the closure of every link in that golden chain of our salvation
which reaches from eternity to eternity: As, 1. He is the foundation of our
election, Ephesians. 1.4. 2. The price of our redemption, 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. 3. The
efficient cause of our regeneration, Ephesians. 2.10. 4. The author of our
justification, Jer. 33.16. 5. The beginner and perfecter of our sanctification,
Heb. 12.2. Joh. 15.4, 5. 6. The matter of our consolation both temporal and
spiritual, Joh. 16.33. Romans 5.1. 7. The sweetner and sanctifier of all our
troubles, Romans 8.37, etc. 8. The assurance and pledge of our resurrection, 1
Cor. 15.20. 1 These. 4.13. 9. The procurer, and producer of our glorification,
Joh. 17.22. Rev. 21.23. and therefore he may well be called our all in all.
Absumus a te, Vivimus ex te, Fidimus in te, Tendimus ad te, Non nisi per te,
Optime Christ.



CHAP. XXX. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about the Church.
Quest. WHat is meant by the word Church?

Answ. The Hebrew word Translated in the Psalms, Congregation, signifies to
gather together, or a company of people assembled together. So, Numb. 20.10.

The Greek signifies to call, the compound to call out. Thence the word
translated a Church, Act. 13.43. in general, signifies an Assembly of people.
So Act. 19.32, 41. Hence when Assemblies were dissolved, every man is said to
return to his own house, 1 Kin. 12.24.

Mostly the Greek word in the New Testament is appropriated to an Assembly of
Saints that profess the ^ospel. Such Assemblies are our Churches, both because
they are called out of their houses to one Assembly, as also by reason of their
calling out of the world, and out of their natural condition: Hence they are
often styled The called, as Romans 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.2, 9. Matthew. 9.13.

In common use this word Church is Metonymically put for the place where such
Assemblies meet. So the word Synagogue, which signifies the same with Church*
is put for an Assembly, and so translated, Jam. 2.2. and for a Congregation,
Act. 13.43. as also the place of the Assembly. So Luke 7.5.

Quest. In what sense is a Church taken in Scripture?

Answ. First, For a company of men selected, gathered, and called out of the
Cor. 1.2. Rev. 2.3. This is the visible Church, which is not always eminent,
and glorious to the eyes of the flesh, as Papists avouch, the Church being like
the Moon, subject to mutations, Rev. 12.1.

Secondly, For the whole company of the Elect, which in all ages, and places
Col. 1.18.

Thirdly, For the faithful in some one Family, so it is to be understood, Cant.
4.12. Rev. 3.12. Heb. 11.10. Rev. 12.27. Cant. 5.2. and 6.8. 2 Cor. 6.16.
Matthew. 7.25. and 16.18. 1 Timothy 3.15. Romans 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.2. and 9.10.

Matthew. 18.17. This is the Church representative.

Cor: 14.34. and 11.18.

Its put also for all those that shall be saved, He^. 12.23. the professors of
Christ, Act. 8.1. the faithful of some one Province, 2 These. 1.1. Some notable
Assembly of the faithful partaking together in the Word and Sacraments, 1 Cor.
14.4. A multitude of any, whether good or bad, meeting together, Act. 19.32, 39.

Quest. Who is the builder of the Church?

Answ, Christ, for the Church is made an house of God, and the several members
of the Church, so ordered, and qualified as they make up that Church, and all
this by Christ. By Christ, they which by nature are dead in sin, are quickened,
and made lively stones: by him they are quickened, and gathered together, and
endued with all needful graces, whereby they become an holy house, and a fit
Temple for God to dwell in, John 5.21. Ephesians. 1.10. Joh. 1.16. Hence Ephesians.
1.22.

Quest. Why does Christ build up his Church?

Answ. First, Because the Members of the Church, before they were Members, were
dead, and scattered, and destitute of all grace, therefore there must be some
to quicken, gather, and furnish them with grace.



Thirdly, For working the great work of man's redemption, which is proper to
sees of the travel of his soul, and is satisfied, as Isa. 53.11. Phil. 2.8, 9,
10, 11.

Quest. Has Christ a special propri^ty in his Church?

Answ. Yea, and that for these reasons.

1. Because he purchased it with his own blood, Act. 20.28. 2. He built it:
Hence, 1 Pet. 2.4, 5. Ephesians. 2.22. 3. God has given the Church to his Son,
Psalm. 2 8.
Quest. How, and why is Christ said to be the Lord of his Church?

Answ. First, By Gods ordination, Psalm. 2.6. Ephesians. 1.22.

Exo. 20.2. therefore these two Titles of Lord and Redeemer are often joined
together, Isa. 43.14. and 44.24.

Israel: God avoucheth Israel to be his peculiar people, they avouch him to be
their God, Deuteronomy. 26.17, 18. This was often foretold by the Prophets, Jer. 31.33.
Hos. 2.23. Zach. 13.9. and is accomplished in the Christian Church, Heb. 8.10.
Christ in, and by the Gospel, and Sacraments offers himself to be our Lord, and
we take him so to be, by our subjecting of our selves to his Ordinances.

Fourthly, By the Laws, and Ordinances which Christ has given to his Church,
Psalm. 147.19, 20. Hence the Church is styled the Pillar, and ground of truth, 1 Timothy 3.15.

Fifthly, By a special care which he takes of his Church, 1 Timothy 4.10. Gouge on
Heb.

Quest. Whether may our Parochial Assemblies in England be called Churches of
Christ, wherein there are so many corrupt persons?

Answ. They may, and are true Churches. Look upon Jerusal^m, Matthew. 23.37. you
shall see that the eleven Tribes were Apostates: there were in it dumb dogs,
Isa. 56.10. there were Scribes, and Pharisees Hypocrites, they had corrupted
the Doctrine of the Law with their false glosses: the Temple was made a den of
thieves; yet the Evangelist calls it the holy City: and that

1. Because there was the service of the true God in the Temple, the Word
preached, Sacrifices offered, the meetings of the Church of God.

2. Because as yet they had not received a bill of divorcement: So have not we
the word of God preached, the Sacraments truly administered, etc. and when did
the Lord give us a bill of divorcement? and therefore to encourage us against
the cavills of the Separatists, let us remember, 1. That the word of truth is
truly preached amongst us, which appears by the conversion of thousands,
whereas never was any converted by a word of error, Jam. 1.18. 2. That our
Ministers are of God, because by them so many are begotten to God, Christ
thought it a good reason when he said, believe me that I came out from the
Father for the works sake: the blind man saw this, Joh. 9.30.


3. Our meetings are holy meetings: For 1. Our people are outwardly called by
an holy calling, and to an holy end. 2. They profess faith in Christ, which is
an holy profession, and therefore in charity they are to be judged Saints. 3.
Congregations are called holy in Scripture, from the better part, not from the
greater: as an heap of wheat mingled with chaff, is called an heap of wheat: so
1 Cor. 6.11. with chap. 2.12. 4. Mixed Congregations are holy in Gods
acceptance, who esteems them, not as they are in themselves, but as members of
Christ, Israel at the best, was a stiffnecked people, ye Balaam said, that God
saw no iniquity in them, Numb. 23.21.


Quest. How is the Church Gods peculiar?

Answ. First, Because Believers are the most precious of men, even the Cant.
6.7. they are the sons of God, brethren of Christ, heirs of heaven.

Secondly, In regard of God, they are a peculiar people, distinct from others,
an holy Nations? the Spouse of Christ, the dauhgter of God, the choice of God,
and Gods delight.

Thirdly, in regard of their whole manner, and condition of life: Hence they to
dwell alone, and not to be numbered amongst the Nations, Numb, 23.9. as for
instance,

1. Their Original are not some few families, coming out of some corner of the
Earth: but they sprung of Christ, of whom all the families of Heaven and Earth
are called.

2. Their Country is not of the Earth: here they are Pilgrims, and strangers:
but Heaven is their home, from which they look for their Savior, Ephe. 3.15.

3. Their King is neither born, nor created, but the everlasting King of glory,
who rules not some one Country, but from Sea to Sea, etc. and not for an age,
but for ever.

4. Their Laws are Spiritual, reaching the Conscience as well as the outward
man, most perfect, never changed, nor abrogated, as men's be.

5. Their war and weapons are not carnal, but Spiritual, as their chiefest
enemies be: their Captain was never foiled, nor can be, and therefore they are
sure of victory before they strike a blow: and as for their corporal enemies,
they overcome them, non feriendo, sed ferendo, not by striking but sufring.

6. Their Language is that of Canaan: their Speech shows them to be Citizens of
Heaven: therefore called a people of a pure language, etc. Zeph. 3.9.

7. Their garments are devised, and put on by God himself, even the garments of
innocence, long robes dyed in the blood of the Lamb, Rev. 7.14.

8. Their diet springs not out of the Earth, but descends from Heaven: Jesus
Christ, the bread of life, etc. of whom, whosoever feeds shall continue to
eternal life.

Quest. Why is the Church compared to a woman, Rev. 12.1?

Answ. First, as simply considered in her self: and that for three causes.

1. Because to the Woman was first made the promise of the blessed seed that
should break the Serpents head, and its still made good to the Church under the
same similitude: for to her all the promises of God do properly belong.

2. Because she is feeble, and weak as a woman without her Husband, Joh. 15.5.

3. Because she is a pure, and chaste virgin, not defiled with Idolatry, as the
Romish strumpet is, 2 Cor. 11.2.

Secondly, As she stands in relation to others, and that

1. To God, and in this relation she is the daughter of God, Cant. 7.1. Psalm.
45.10.

2. To Christ, in which relation she is the Spouse of Christ. 1. Contracted to
him in his Incarnation: So Cant 4.10. 2 Married to him as his Bride, and taken
home in his second comin^ to dwell with him for ever.

3. To Christians, and in this relation she is their Mother. For a woman
through the company of her husband, brings forth children: So the Church by her
conjunction with Christ, and the power of his word, brings forth, nurceth, and
brings up many children to God.

Quest. What duties does this relation of a Spouse to Christ teach her?

Answ. First, to cleave to her husband. For God seeing that it was not good for
Adam to be alone, he made the woman of his rib, being cast into a sleep, and
brought, and married her unto him, saying, for this cause shall a man leave
Father and Mother, and cleave to his wife, etc. Genesis 2.24. So God seeing, after
the fall, that it was much less good for man to be alone, he institutes a
second marriage with the second Adam, whom he casts asleep by death, and brings
his Spouse out of his side pierced, and marries the Church to him, that
renouncing all Loves and Lovers but him, she might cleave undevidedly to him,
and this she must do four ways.

1. In person: For as the wife delivers up her person to her husband alone: So
Believers must deliver up their souls, and bodies to Jesus Christ. For 1 Cor.
6.19, 20. we are no longer our own, etc.

2. A faithful Shouse is married but to one man, 2 Cor. 11.2. So the Church.

3. Christ our Husband communicates his whole person to us: he gives his life
for his sheep only: prays for no other.

4. Christ as a faithful Husband leaves Father in Heaven, and Mother on Earth,
and cleaves to his Wife.

2. To cleave to Christ in faithful affection, loving our Husband Christ as our
selves, nay better then our selves, not loving our selves to the death for his
sake, seeing his love to us was stronger then death, and more to us then to his
own life.

3. To cleave to him in affliction, as a Wife takes her Husband for better, and
worse. A Kingdom is promised to such, Luke 22.29, 30.

Secondly, The Church must depend upon Christ her Husband as upon he

1. For direction, subjecting her self, as owing obedience to all his commands,
Ephesians. 5.24. and this she must do, seeing he is the true light, the Sun of
Righteousness, the Pillar able to direct her.

2. For protection, Christ is the Savior of his body the Church, Ephesians. 5.23.
the only Phineas that turns away the wrath of God, kindled against his Israel,
the onley Moses that stands in the gap where Gods wrath had made a breach.

3. For provision: None else but Jesus Christ can supply the Church with such
things as she needs: he can bestow pardon of Sin, righteousness, life, and
salvation: He paies her debts, both of obedience to the whole Law, and
satisfaction for the breach of it.

Thirdly, She must rejoice to honor her Husband even with her own dishonor:

Fourthly, She must, as a good Spouse, do all things to please her Husband,
walk worthy the Lord, etc. Col. 1.10.

Quest. How must she please her Husband Christ?

Answ. First, She must not seek to please her self in any thing that is
displeasing Romans 15.1, 2, 3.

Secondly, she must not seek to please others, for then she cannot please
Christ, Gal. 1.10.

Thirdly, she must labor for a conformity to him in manners, and affections.

1. Of virtues, as humility, innocence, patience, etc. 2. In will, willing
holily what he wills, and nilling what he nilleth. 3. In practice, cheerfully
observing what he commands.

Fourthly, She must deck and trim her self with graces, Psalm. 45.13. She must
Tim. 2.9.

Fifthly, She must show her love to Christ by loving, and gladly intertaining
his

Sixthly, She must show her delight in him in his presence, and long after Isa.
26.8. Rev. 22.20. crying Even so come Lord Jesus.

Quest. What privileges has the Church as the Spouse of Christ?

Answ. First, Free election: he has made choice of her, and not she of him,
Joh. 15.16. He was not bound any way to choose her: neither did he find any
reason in her, as other young men do: no disposition, no work of preparation,
no freewill, no affections toward him, neither is he bound to render a reason,
if he had passed by us as he has many others.

Ephesians. 2.14, 15. He is our peace, Col. 2.14. Hereby we have daily entrance,
and access unto God, not as strangers, or ordinary friends: but as friends, yea
as children in prayers, praises, etc. Ephesians. 2.18, 19.

Thirdly, Gracious assimulation, and fitness between the Bridegrom, and Bride:

1. She was of base Parentage, a daughter of the Earth, her Father an Amorite,
etc. Ezekiel. 16.3. now she is made a chosen generation, the daughter of a Prince,
of near alliance to God.

2. She was poor and needy, had no worth, no dowry to prefer her: now by this
contract, she has an estate made her fit for a Prince: that as her Husband is
heir of all things, his love is so liberal that he has made her a coheir of
his own heavenly inheritance, Romans 8.17.

3. She was deformed, without beauty, or comeliness, she has now attained
perfect beauty in righteousness, and the beauty of her husband makes her beauty
perfect, Ezekiel. 16.14. without wrinkle or spot, Ephesians. 5.27.

4. She was naked, covered with nothing but shame, excepting a few rags, and
fig leaves: now her clothing is of wrought gold, Psalm. 45.13. garments of
salvation, Isa. 61.10.



1. What he Covenants, and promises, he also pledgeth with many graces, shining
as so many Jewels, thereby testifying his bounty toward her.

2. He bestows his person on her, and by becoming hers, she becomes his, and so
of twain, they become one flesh.

3. With his person he bestows his goods upon her, i. e. all his merits, and
obedience, all his sufferings, all his glory, all his prayers.

4. He invests her, not only into his goods, but into his inheritance, and in
due time consummates the marriage, bringing his Spouse home into his house of
glory, a mansion prepared for her: putting her into possession of all the
wealth of Heaven, where she enjoyes his immediate presence.

Ahashuerus made Esther, a poor captive maid, a sharer in all the honor of his
Kingdom by marrying her. Yea, the Churches honor exceeds that of the greatest
Queens: For

1. They are matched with, and laid in the bosoms of men, but she is admitted
into the bed with him that is God and Man, Cant. 1.15.

2. They are married to Kings, but such as are mortal, who often leave them
miserable Widows: But she to the King of glory, who only has immortality.

3. They are married to consort in some one kingdom, and part of the Earth: But
she to a King that rules from sea to sea, to whom all Kings are subject, and by
whom they rule. To a Kingdom unshaken, that fades not away, etc. 1 Pet. 1.4.

Sixthly, Strong and eternal consolation, in that by reason of this marriage a
firm

Quest. How may the true Church be known?

Answ. First, By her face: now the face of a true visible Church, is discerned,
by

1. By the sincere preaching, and professing of the Word of God.

2. The due and true administration of the Sacraments, according to that Word.

3. The exercise of Discipline appointed in, and by the Word: The first, is
absolutely requisite to the face, and being of a Church. The two latter serve
for the beauty, and stability of it. So Joh. 8.30. and 10.4. my sheep hear my
voice, etc. where Christ is, there is the Church, but where two or three
consent in his name, there Christ is, Matthew. 18.20. Act. 2.42.

Secondly, By her voice, she speaks the language of Canaan: She enjoins not,

Thirdly, By her virtues, or qualities: as

1. She is holy, in respect 1. of holiness of the Doctrine which she teaches:
what she receives from the Lord, she teaches. 2. Of the better part of the
visible Church she is holy, though not in respect of the greatest part. 3.
Whatsoever corruption of Doctrine or manners spring up, she reproves, and
censures, not tollerates it.

2. She is meek, loving, patient, merciful, etc. Jam. 3.17. full of good
fruits, her weapons are prayers, and tears, not fire and faggot.

Fourthly, By her marriage: a good way to know one by, is the head, and the
Cant. 2.16. and 5.10.

Fifthly, By her carriage and behavior:

1. To her husband, to whom in all her behavior she expresses four virtues.

1. She is chaste, and faithful to him: she forgets not the guide of her youth,
etc. 2. She is subject to him in all things: content to be tried, and ruled in
all cases by his will revealed in his Word. 3. She depends only on her husband
for the means of her welfare, and all needful supplies: will not seek to any
other Advocates, or Mediators, etc. 4. She honors her Husband only, and will
give his honor to no other.
2. To her children, whom 1. She nurceth at her own breasts, puts them not
forth to such strange milk of Traditions, Councils, Decretals, etc. 2. She
instructs, and teaches them. 3. Porvides for them: she upholds the means of
salvation to keep her children in good state.


Quest. Is the true Church of Christ always visible?

Answ. The true Church is not always conspicuous, visible and glorious to the
world, but may be oppressed and hid. So was the Church in Egypt, thrust out
into the wilderness: so in Elijahs time, when he complained that he was left
alone: so in the Babylonish captivity, therefore compared to dead and dry
bones, Ezekiel. 37.2. so Rev. 13.12.

Quest. What reasons may be rendered for this?

Answ. First, because the Church is a select company called out of the world,
little flock, Joh. 15.9. a garden enclosed, Cant. 4.12. the blind world neither
can, nor will see the Church.

Secondly, the Church is such a body, as is not always visible to man's eyes,
Elias, the foundation being in Gods election, and the union spiritual.

Hos. 2.3.

Dove in the rocks, Cant. 2.19.

Moon being s^metimes in the full, and sometimes hid.

Quest. What conclusions may be laid down concerning the visibility of the
Church?

Answ. First, By the Church which we hold invisible, we mean the Catholic
Church, even the multitude of all the Elect which have been, are, or shall be,
which Church is holy, and no wicked persons belong to it: Its a communion of
Saints only, to which belongs remission of sins, and life everlasting, and this
is invisible to the world, and that

1. Because the ground, and foundation of it (Gods Election) is invisible.

2. The greatest part of the Elect are not subject to sense: not the Saints in
Heaven, nor many on Earth, some being not born, others but new bo^n.

3. Visible things are not believed, but things invisible: Faith is of things
not s^en, and if we believe the holy Catholic Church, we cannot see it.



1. That God will always have a part of his Catholic Church here on Earth
that shall hold, and maintain the true Faith in the several Ages to the Worlds
end, and this cannot fail upon Earth.

2. This part of the Catholic Church consists of men that are visible, and
exercise visible Ordinances, as the Word, Sacraments, etc. and often in
peaceable times appears glorious in many particular, and visible Congregations.

3. That these visible, and particular Churches, are not always visible after
the same manner: neither is any part of the visible Church always so
necessarily visible, but that it may disappear, as the Church in the Old and
New Testaments have some time done.

4. This number of men in whom this part of the Church contsteth, may come to
be a few, and by Tyranny and Heresy, their profession may be so secret amongst
themselves, that the world cannot see them. Though like the Sun, she shines in
her self, yet she may be obscured from the sight of others.

5. Though the Church cannot fail upon Earth, yet the external government of it
may fail for a time: her Pastors may be interrupted, her sheep scattered, her
Discipline hindered, the external exercise of Religion may be suspended, and
the sincerity of Religion exceedingly corrupted: so that the members of the
Church are only visible amongst themselves.



1. Because if she cannot be safe in the City, she shall be safe in the
Wilderness, where God will provide her a place, as Rev. 12.14.

2. Gods purpose for the safety of his Church cannot be altered by any
enterprises of her Enemies. Though Pharaoh slay all the infants, yet Moses
shall be preserved by his own daughter in his own bosom to be a deliverer.
Though Herod slay the infants, he shall miss of him whom he seeks.

3. God makes high account of his Church, as the signet of his right hand, the
apple of his eye, therefore he will provide for her safety.

4. Gods wisdom makes it healthful for his Church sometimes to be hid, that she
may always be safe: otherwise the world would destroy her. Dr. Tailor on Rev.

Quest. Are not all Christians bound to pray for the peace of the Church?

Answ. Yea, 1. we must pray for the whole Church, where ever dispersed.

2. For the natural members, and noble members especially: the living stones,
those which are more instrumental, and organicall: such as are eminent in
power, and place, in worth, and in service.

3. More particularly for our own Church, to which we are related, and to the
principals of it, as Cities and Universities.

4. For the restoring of the people of God, even for the Jews, and for the
setting up of the new Jerusalem, as God has promised in his Wo^d.

5. By the same reason we must pray against such as are against the Church.

Quest. But what must we pray for in the behalf of the Church?

Answ. First in general, for all blessings; for all that is good, and useful,
and tends to the welfare of it: as for the protection of it: deliverance of
those that are

Secondly, In particular, we must pray for a three fold Peace of the

1. A peace with God, in causing the Churches to keep their peace with him, in
walking in purity and power of his Ordinance, without which, though they were
in peace with all the world, it will come to nothing: all other blessings will
be soon gone, except we have something to soder us with God, which can be
nothing but our exact walking with him in his Ordinances.

2. Peace amongst the Members of the Church: that they may be free from
dissentions, divisions: that they may think the same thing, go the same way,
and unanimously mind the glory of God.

3. A Foreign peace also from all opposition without, that there may be no
invasion by foreign Enemies upon the Church of God.

Quest. What is further included in our praying for the Church?

Answ. First, one thing is employed inwardly, that our hearts should work
toward the Church, our desires and wishes should be for the welfare of it.

Secondly, another outwardly, that we should endeavor to attain what we pray
for: our counsels should be for the welfare of the Church: Our examples should
be patterns to others to provoke them to good works: such as are in authority
should exercise it for the settling, and furthering the peace of the Church: yea
we should not only pray our selves, but should stir up others to do the like.

Quest. But how must all this be done?

Answ. First, Sincerely, not out of by-respects.

Secondly, Earnestly, and frequently, putting all our strength to it.

Thirdly, Constantly, not by fits only.

Quest. Who are bound to do all this?

Answ. Every Christian in what station soever he is: as 1. Magistrates in their
places, whom it p^incipally concerns to pray for, and promote it. 2. Ministers
in their places must be leading persons in these duties, and provoke others to
it. 3. Yea all, in every condition, learned, and unlearned, men, and women, etc.


Examples, and Scriptures for all these are: that of Moses, Exodus 32.32. So
Judge. 5.23. 1 Samuel 4.19. 2 Samuel 11.11. Psalm. 20.5. and 51.18. and 53.6. and
102.13. Isa. 62.1. Romans 9.3. 2 Cor. 11.28. Phil. 1.18. Col. 2.5.

Quest. But why must we thus pray for the peace of the Church?

Answ. First, consider what the Church is, and that

1. In relation to God, its his house, the Spouse of Christ, and there cannot
be a dearer relation to put a deeper engagement upon us then this.

2. In that relation that she has to us. She is the Mother of us all, and
therefore we should sympathize in her weal, and woe.



1. Peace nourishes all Arts, Sciences, Trades, etc.

2. Its a very careful, and useful nurce to cherish Religion, Acts 9.31. there
is no hearing of the Law of God, nor the Law of Justice, when men have their
swords in their hands. Arma silent L^ges.



1. Its a most efficacious Engine: the sum of all Policies for a Christan to
work by, for Peace: Its God that rules all the world: has all hearts in his
hands, can make a man's enemies, yea the very stones to be at peace with him:
and prayer rules God, he suffers himself to be overcome by it. Le^ me alone,
says God, Exodus 32.10.

2. Its of great necessity also: For God will not bestow blessings, till we
seek and sue to him for them, and the reason is, because otherwise he shall
have little honor by it: If it come without seeking to God for it, we should
ascribe it to other means, and things.



1. He is the Son of the Church, and it becomes him (at least) to pray hard for
his Mother, as Craesus his dumb son did for his Father.

2. He is a Son of Peace, a Son of the God of Peace, a Son of the Gospel of
peace: and the Spirit given him is a spirit of Peace.

3. He is a Son of prayer: It should be the element in which he draws his
breath, to run toward God, and toward Heaven in a way of peace: besides, he
is enabled to pray when others cannot, he is sensible of the condition of the
Church which others are not.

Quest. But how may we so pray for the peace of the Church, as to be sure to
prevail?

Answ. First, we must pray in Faith, believing Gods Word, and his promises made
to his Church.





Tertullian) which are ordinarily starved with formality.



Quest. What means may we use to help us in the serious performance of this
duty.

Answ. We must lay aside all our carnal security, and lay things to heart:
observe the state of the Church, and lay it to heart. Let not the world (as the
Ivy deals with the Oak) twist about thy heart, which will make Christianity
dye within thee: Be not too busy with worldly affairs, least they choke all
thoughts about bettr matters. Dr. Stoughton.

Quest. Why is the Church called a mother? Gal. 4.26.

Answ. Because the word of God is committed to the keeping of the Church, which
word is seed, 1 Pet. 1.23. Milk, 1 Cor. 3.2. strong meat, Heb. 5.14. and the
Church is a mother which by the Ministry of the word, brings forth children
unto God; and when they are born, feeds them with milk out of the two breasts
of the Old and New Testaments.

Quest. Where are we to seek for our mother the Church?

Answ. She is to be sought for, and found in the true visible Churches, the
certain marks whereof are three.

1. The preaching of the word out of the writings of the Prophets and Apostles,
with obedience, Joh. 10.28. Ephesians. 2.20.

2. True invocation of God the Father, in the only name of Christ, by the
assistance of the Spirit, Act. 9.14. 1 Cor. 1.2.

3. The right use of the Sacraments, Baptism, and the Lords Supper, Matthew.
28.18. and by these we shall find the true Church of God in England, etc.

Quest. Are all Christians bound to join themselves to some particular Church,
or Congregation?

Answ. Yea, they are in a special manner bound to it, and that for these
Reasons.

1. In regard of Gods institution, Mat. 18.17. wherein is contained a necessity
both in regard of the precept, and the means.

2. In regard of the presence of God and Christ there, Rev. 1.13. For if we
will come to God, we must come also to that assembly where God does in a
special manner manifest his presence, and is found of those that seek him there.

3. In regard of Gods glory, which is much advanced publicly by this means:
For as God under the Law placed his name in Jerusalem, so under the Gospel he
does it in these public assemblies.

4. In regard of the Covenant and promise of God: For they which are members of
the Church, they are, as it were, directly under the promises and blessings of
God to be poured out upon them, Psalm. 65.5. and 133.3.

5. In regard of our profession; because otherwise it cannot be that the
believers should be distinguished from infidels, 1 Cor. 5.12.

6. In regard of mutual edification, which follows from this combination of the
godly amongst themselves: Heb. 10.24, 25. 1 Cor. 11.17. and 12.25, 27. Romans
1.12.

Quest. What Church must we join our selves to?

Answ. First, only to the true Church which professes the true faith.

Secondly, if we be uningaged, we must as much, as we may, join our selves to

Thirdly, though we may join our selves to that Church, in which necessarily
Ephesians. 5.11. neither must we fix our selves to any Church with a mind to favor
her defects, by our silence: (but so far as it may be done with edification) we
must assist in taking them away.

Quest. Are we to associate our selves with such a Church as tollerates the
wicked, and opposes the godly?

Answ. First, to tolerate notorious wickedness is a great sin in a Church,
Revel. 2.20. and in Its nature tends to the corrupting of the Church, 1 Corinthians. 5.6.

Secondly, it defiles the communion to those wicked men that are tolerated,
Hag. 2.13.

Cor. 5.13.



John 9, 10, 11. and that for these reasons.

1. Because that error may be but the infirmity of the Church.

2. Because patience and forbearance must be exercised toward a particular
offending brother, Gal. 6.1. much more toward a society of brethren, or a
Church.

3. By the rash departure of the godly, a reformation of those evils is not
promoted, but hindered.

4. Because we cannot remove from such a Church to a purer, without grievous
inconveniences, which ought always to be avoided as much as may be without
sin.

Am^s. Cas. of Consc.

Quest. Is it lawful to gather Churches out of true Churches?

Answ. Its a most unwarrantable practice of them that do so: Its an uncharible,
and unscriptural practice: there is neither precept, nor precedent for it in all
the book of God: Indeed we read in Scripture of gathering Churches from amongst
the Heathen. Were England a land of Heathens, and no Church planted amongst us,
it might be proper enough to gather Churches here; but to put a planted,
constituted, and settled Church into the condition of Heathens, savours
strongly of pride, and censoriousnesse: Besides, gathering of Churches amongst
us, breeds woeful divisions in families, the husband going one way, the wife
another, the child a third, the servant a fourth, etc. and is a great
impediment to their mutual edification.

Again, they which gather Churches amongst us have their members oft-times
living many miles asunder: How then can such Pastors watch over their souls as
those that must give an account thereof? or how can such members partake of all
Ordinances, or perform such mutual duties each to other as they ought?
Moreover, its a kind of Sacrilege thus to rob godly Ministers of the cream
of their flocks, and the crown of their Ministry of whom they have traveled in
pain till Christ was formed in them: and its hard measure in those who thus
reap where they have not sown, and enter into another man's labors.

Mr. Hall on Tim.

Quest. Is it lawful to separate from a true Church, because of some errors or
defects in it?

Answ. By no means, and that for these Reasons.

1. Because the root of such separation is bad, and therefore the fruit cannot
be good. It springs from pride, and censoriousnesse; as in the Pharisees, who
were the great Seperatists, and had their name from thence.

2. Such are Schismatics, and (probably) will in a short time be Heretics:
Schism being the way to Heresy: they make a rent in the Church whose peace
should be very dear to us: For though peace be not the being of a Church; yet
it tends much to the well being of it: for as a Kingdom, so a Church, being
divided, cannot stand.

3. The pretenses of separation (as the Cross, Surplisse, etc. being removed)
though separation even then for those things was unlawful, its now far more
vile, and therefore God punishes the Separatists of our time more severely, by
giving them up to viler opinions then formerly.

4. Its a scandal and great wrong to a Church: Its ill to forsake the society
of one good man without a just cause, how much more to unchurch a whole Church
causelessly?

5. Such cannot escape the revenging hand of God: Though men may suffer them,
yet God will not: One of the saddest judgments we read of in Scripture befell
Schismatical Corah, and his company, Numb. 6.16. they made a rent in the
Congregation, and the earth rent in sunder, and devoured them: when Caine
separated from the Church, Genes. 4.16. he became a vagabond. Idem.

Quest. Who is the Head of the Church?

Answ. Christ only, Col. 1.18, 19.

Quest. In what nature is Christ the Head of the Church?

Answ. According to both his natures. For, Col. 1.18. he is called the Head of
the Church; whom v. 15. the Apostle had said to be the Image of the invisible
God; but that image was the eternal Son of God, the word incarnate: therefore
Christ, as God-man is the Head of the Church: for the Church ought to have such
an head, which had a conformity of nature with the rest of the members that
were to be incorporated into it: but this conformity agrees to Christ according
to his humane nature, where Christ and his Church are said to be one flesh,
Ephesians. 5.31. The Church also ought to have such an head which could communicate
spiritual life to it; but this is only in the power of God, whence God is
called both the husband and head of the Church, Psalm. 45.11. therefore Christ,
as God, was the head of the Church also.

Object. But Christ could not thus be the head of the old Church, because he
was not then incarnate: For it is the part of an head to communicate, and
impart its good to the body; but the humanity of Christ could not profit the
Church before his incarnation, and therefore he was not the head of the Church
of the Jews according to his humanity?

Answ. Though Christ had not then actually conjoined the humanity to himself;
yet according to the divine decree of his future incarnation, and passion,
according to the eternal efficacy of it, and according to the lively faith of
the Patriarchs, even Christ's humane nature, and those things which he was to do
and suffer in the same, did much benefit the ancient Church when as yet they
were not in act. From the beginning of the world, they were chosen in Christ,
and by Christ all the adopted sons of God, Ephesians. 1.4, 5. Christ was the Lamb
of God slain from the beginning of the world, and therefore from the beginning
of the world he was the lively head of his Church: For those things are present
to God and faith which are not yet come: Hence Aquinas says truly: Christum
fuisse secundum humanitatem caput ecclesiae ante incarnationem, per operationem
fidei, quae illum in carnandum apprehendebat, and sic beneficium
justificationis consequebatur.

Object. But Christ is not the Head of his Church according to his divine
nature, because that has no conformity of nature with the rest of the members:
neither according to his humane nature, because according to that he cannot
communicate spiritual life to his members, therefore he is no way the head of
the Church?

Answ. I answer in general: If there be found in Christ the perfect resemblance
and reason of an head, this is enough to make him truly called an Head, though
the conditions of an Head be not found in either of the natures apart. As for
that which is objected, that the humane nature of Christ does not communicate
life and spiritual motion to the members, I answer by distinguishing. The life
of grace is infused into the members, either by the principal agent, who
creates grace in the soul by the way of authority; and in this sense the influx
of grace is from God alone: or else from the instrument joined with the
principal agent, and so the humane nature of Christ instrumentally is said to
communicate grace, and spiritual life: As it nothing derogates from the natural
head that it communicates life, and motion to the other members, not
immediately from it self, but by the means of its latent virtue: So neither
does it derogate from the dignity of this mystical Head, that it communicates
life, and grace, not principally from its self, but by reason of the Divinity
dwelling in it, Christ therefore notwithstanding these objections, is the head
of his Church, according to both his natures.

Quest. What may we learn from the consideration hereof?

Answ. First, In that God is the head of the Church, we may thence conclude
that she shall be perpetual, and that the gates of Hell shall not prevail
against her: For if God be with us, what shall be against us? and truly, if the
head of the Church were less then God, she would never be safe, having all the
Devils of Hell, and all the wicked of the world against her.



Thirdly, If God be the head of the Church, then Christ's ascension into heaven,
Matthew. 28. ult. Lo I am with you always, even to the end of the world,
therefore the Pope is a superfluous head.

Fourthly, Is our head man also? then by virtue of his kindred to our nature,
Heb. 2.17, 18.

Fifthly, is our head man? this may comfort us, in that the Devil has no cause
Adam, who was the head and fountain of all mankind: but the second Adam, the
head of his Church, has overcome him: yea in Christ, we overcome him, being
his members equally as we were overcome in Adam: the conquest of our head, has
made us conquerors.

Quest. Wherein consists the similitude betwixt Christ and a head? and betwixt
the Church and a body?

Answ. The natural head must be considered in a double respect to its membes:
1. Of difference. 2. Of agreement: and so must this mystical head also.

Quest. Wherein consists the discrepancy betwixt the head and members?

Answ. First, in respect of its eminency and dignity: For the head does more
Joh. 3.34.

Secondly, in respect of its Government: For the head directs, and governs,
Epes. 5.22.23.

Joh. 15.5. Hence Phil. 4.13.

Quest. Wherein consists the agreement between the head and members?

Answ. First, In that the natural head has conformity of nature with the
members: For it would be a monstrous thing if a man's body should have a horses
head; So between the Church and her mystical head, there is an agreement of
nature, Heb. 2.16.

viz. the safety and preservation of the whole person: So Christ and his
members, which are one person, are ordained to attain one, and the same end,
viz. eternal glory, and happiness; and for the attaining of this end, both the
head and the members do daily cooperate. This is the care of the head to bring
his members to perfect blessedness, Joh. 17.12. where he is called the Savior
of his body, Ephesians. 5.23. and this also is the scope of all Ch^ists members, that
together with their head, they may participate of that blessedness. As Paul.
Phil. 3.14.

Thirdly, the head, and members have a continuity between themselves, and all
have Ephesians. 4 16.

Quest. What is that body whereof Christ is the head?

Answ. The Church, in Latin Ecclesia ab evocando, because its a company, or
multitude of called ones, who are called out of the world by the Ministry of
the Gospel, and other means appointed by God to draw men out of the state of
ignorance, and misery, and to bring them to a state of glory: In which sense we
call such a company of persons a Church, as profess the doctrine and Religion
of Christ under lawful Pastors: Such were the seven Churches of Asia: Such that
at Rome, Corinth, etc. These Congregations are called a Church, and such as
live in them, members of the Church, who also (in the judgment of Charity) are
to be reputed members of the holy Catholic Church, both because on Gods part
they have offered unto them such means, whereby men are brought to partake of
eternal life, and because that on their part in regard of the external action,
and profession, these means are received, and used to their salvation.

This body of the Church whereof Christ is the Head, consists not of
unbelieving, and wicked members, but only of holy, and sanctified ones, whom
God has pulled out of the power of darkness, and has translated them into the
Kingdom of his dear Son. So that it is not sufficient to salvation to be a
visible member of any particular visible Church, by the external profession of
Faith, except withal a man be a mystical member of the Catholic Church by
true faith, and the spirit dwelling in his heart. Hence Cyprian faith, Quid
faci^ in domo fidei, p^rfidum pectus.

Quest. What else may we learn from hence?

Answ. First, That Christians must not envy those which are endowed with
Austin, Toll invidiam, and tuum est quod habeo, toll invidiam, and meum est
quod habes: Take away envy, and that which I have is thine, Take away envy, and
that which thou have is mine.

Secondly, seeing Gods children are all members of the same body, therefore
they should be ready to serve one another in love, and to be affected each with
Cor. 12.26. Dr. Davenant on Col.

Quest. Whether may the Church fail?

Answ. Neither the Catholic Church, nor any part or member of it can fail, or
perish. Joh. 3.16. This Church Christ has undertaken for to defend to the end,
Matthew. 16.18. and 28.20. She is the first born, whose names are written in
Heaven, Heb. 12.22, 23. If it cannot be in one place, or Kingdom, it will in
another; The woman, when persecuted, had a place prepared in the wilderness to
fly into. But a particular Church may fail, and die, and come to nothing, as
we see in the seven famous Churches of Asia. This may also be proved out of
many places of Scripture, Mat. 21.43. where Christ foretells that the Church of
the Jews (which had as great privileges as any Church on earth ever had)
should cease. Paul tells the Corinthians, they may come to be no Church, 2 Cor.
11.3. and the Church of Rome, Romans 11.20, 21, 22. the Church of Israel, the ten
Tribes were dischurched, Hos. 1.9.

Quest. What are the infallible marks of a true Church?

Answ. First the sincere preaching of the Gospel: Hence a true Church is
described Romans 3.2. So Psalm. 147.19. Act. 14.23. and where the Gospel cease
in the sincere preaching of it, they are an undone people, Prove. 29.18.

Judah is called the Circumcision, Romans 3.1. and St. Paul defines the Church
under the Gospel by the Sacraments, Phil. 3.3.

Cor. 14.33. So Gal. 1.22. All particular Churches are Churches that are in
Christ, and Churches of visible Saints.

CHAP. XXXI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Circumspection, and
circumspect walking.
Quest. WHat is it to walk circumspectly?

Ans, The Greek word, Ephesians. 5.15. signifies exactly or precisely: so that to
walk circumspectly, implies an accurate study, and diligence throughout our
lives, that we offend none: but by the light of faith and good works edify
all. The course of Christianity is an exquisite course, and strict walking.

Quest. In what other phrases is this circumspect course commended?

Answ. Its implied in the phrases of walking before God, Genesis 17.1. Living
honestly, Heb. 13.18. walking worthy the Lord in all well-pleasing, Col. 1.10,
11.

Quest. What things are required in circumspect walking?

Answ. First, that it be exact, and considerate, according to the turning
aside, either to the right hand, or left, Deuteronomy. 2.27. and 5.32. Prove. 4.27. 2 Chronicles. 34.2. Isa. 30.21. Psalm. 119.9, 10.

Secondly, it must be full, in all fruits of holiness, and justice, going to
the utmost Deuteronomy. 5.32. Col. 1.10. Numb. 14.24. and 32.11, 12. Jos. 14.8, 9, 14.
Such an one looks to the thriving of all his graces: His moderation shall not
damp his zeal, nor his zeal outrun his knowledge: His providence shall not
lessen his faith, nor his faith destroy his providence, etc. All his graces run
in a circle, move, strengthen, and quicken each other.

Thirdly, it makes a man diligent to redeem, seek, observe, and take
opportunities Ephesians. 5.15, 16. there is no time, state, condition, or company,
but some way or other he will improve it for his good, and work profit out of
it for the advantage of his soul, Act. 18.25. 2 Pet. 1.5. Philip. 2.12. Heb.
12.15.

Fourthly, he looks to the manner as well as to the thing done, considering all
doing, together with the inward affection, and disposition of the soul, and is
careful that all may be right, Romans 12.2. Joh. 13.17. Phil. 1.9, 10.



Quest. What may further us in this exact walking?

Answ. First, sound knowledge of the right way, which is as the light, guiding
us to set every foot aright, Psalm. 119.105. Prove. 2.10, 11.



Prove. 4.26. and 14.15. Gal. 6.4. He that regards his courses cannot be
regardlesse of his heart which is the fountain of all actions, good and evil.
A bad affection may mar a good work, but a good affection cannot justify an
evil action. Hence Paul prays, Phil. 1.10.



Psalm 16.8. Psalm 119.168. Prove. 5.20, 21. and 15.11. Psalm 39.2, 3. and
18.6. Job 34.21, 22.

Psalm. 4.4. and 119.59. Prove. 4.25.

Quest. Why is this circumspect walking so necessary?

Answ. First, its Gods command that we should walk before him according to all
the Statutes and Ordinances that he has given in Covenant to be observed by
us: and we for our parts have undertaken to serve him in holiness and
righteousness all our days, and that without limitation, even to go to the
uttermost in every command, Psalm. 39.1.



Col. 4.5. Phil. 2.14, 15.



Psalm. 119.6. Lev. 26.2, 12. Romans 13.12. Its time to cast off the works of
darkness, and to put on the armor of light, Joh. 11.8, 9. 1 Chro. 22.13. 2 Chronicles. 24.20. 1 King. 8.23. 1 These. 5.4, 5.

more diligent in the work of them; for the end of every thing is of such force
that the nearer we come to it, we do with the more courage and diligence ply
the means which bring us to it.

Seventhly, in such walking there is much comfort, and joy: yea, the pleasures
Psalm. 138.^. Jer. 6.16. for the commandments lead unto rest, and he that walks
in them shall find peace to his soul.

Eighthly, sin is the disturber of conscience: the only makebate that

Ninthly, the relation wherein we stand to God, to Christ, to the Holy

Quest. How may we stir up our selves to this circumspection?

Answ. First, we must bewail our former ignorance, rashness, sloth, shame our

Secondly, We must quicken our selves to more diligence for the time to

Thirdly, we must fly to God by prayer, entreating him to work our hearts
Balls power of godliness.

Quest. What further considerations may provoke us to this circumspect walking?

Answ. First, in regard of sin which is exceeding deceitful, Heb. 3.13. sin
never presents its self in its own colors, but takes upon it the shape of some
Gen, 3.6. and 34.23. Mark 12.7. Prove. 7.18. Yea, like Satan, it translates it
self into an Angel of light, 2 Cor. 11.14. therefore we have need to watch. Sin
is of a bewitching nature: It insensibly soaks into a man, as it did into
David, 2 Samuel 11.2, etc. and when once it has possessed him, the heart cannot
be withdrawn from it, as in David's example, 2 Samuel 11.13, 14. and Sampsons,
Judge. 16.5, etc.

Secondly, in regard of Satan, he is a mortal enemy, implacable, sedulous,
restless, and very terrible, 1 Pet. 5.8. For,

1. His name devil declares him to be an accuser, and therein one that seeks
all advantages he can against us.

2. An adversary, (...), contralitigator, who will do us all the despite he
can as an adversary in Law.

3. He is a Lion, strong, ravenous, fierce, and cruel.

4. He is as a roaring lion, doing what he can to affright us, and make us
yield to him.

5. He walks up and down, wherein he shows himself to be sedulous, and
restless, Mat. 12.43.

6. He seeks whom he may devour. This declares him to be a deadly enemy, that
aims at our death, even the damnation of our souls; and is there not just
cause to watch against such an enemy?



Peter, Matthew. 26.33.70. Hence, 1 Corinthians. 10.12. Romans 11.20.

Quest. Why must every one be circumspect over himself?

Answ. First, because every one is nearest to himself; now our greatest care
must be of the nearest to us.

Act. 20.28. whereby they may save themselves, 1 Timothy 4.16.

Cor. 2.11. Hence we are exhorted, to examine our selves, etc. 2 Cor. 13.5.

Romans 14.12. 2 Cor. 5.10.

Quest. Why must every one be circumspect over others?

Answ. First, because of the near union of all Christians, they are brethren,
Mal. 2.10.



Matthew. 22.39. This is the sum both of the Law, and Gospel. If we do this we
shall do well, Jam. 2.8.

Gouge on Heb.

Quest. What benefit shall we have by this circumspect walking.

Answ. It will conduce much to the comfort of our lives. For our
understandings, and judgments are not given us only to plot for the world, and
to be circumspect for our temporal welfare: but to be wise for the maine end,
to glorify God, and save our souls, to get out of the corruption of nature,
and to maintain our communion with God; the end of our living in the world, is
to begin Heaven upon earth: and whatsoever is done in order to this end is
good, but without circumspection nothing can be done to this end.

Quest. What are the impediments that hinder us from this circumspect walking?

Answ. First, the rage of lusts that will not give a man leave to consider of
his ways: but are impetuous, commanding, and tyrannous, making men without
consideration to rush into sin as the horse into the battle.

Martha, and neglect Mary's part.

Thirdly, Christian circumspection is an hard, and difficult work: Its an

Quest. What is Christian circumspection, or watchfulness?

Answ. Its an heedful observation of our selves in all things, and a serious,
and diligent circumspection over all our ways, that we may please God by doing
his will, and neither commit any sin that he has forbidden, nor omit any duty
which he has commanded. This is required, Deuteronomy. 4.9, 23. Mar. 13.33, 34.
Ephesians. 5.14, 15, 16. and 6.18. Col. 4.2. 1 Cor. 15.34. and 16.13. 1 These. 5.5,
6, 7, 8. Acts 20.28, 31.

Quest. Wherein does this circumspection consist? and in what is it to be used?

Answ. First in general, it is to be used in all things, 2 Timothy 4.5. In all
places, Luke 8.18. for Satan lays his nets, and snares to catch us in all
these, therefore we had need to look to every step.

Secondly, neither must this watch be kept over some of our parts only, but
over Deuteronomy. 4.9. over our reason, and judgment, that it be not darkened with
ignorance, Matthew. 6.23. nor corrupted with Errors and Heresies: Over our
memories that they retain not vanity, and sinful impressions that should be
blotted out, nor forget those things with which God has betrusted them. Over
our wills, that they go, not before, but wait upon holy reason, choosing that
which it commends, and refusing that which it disalloweth: over our
consciences, that they be pure and clean: not slack in doing their duty, nor we
negligent in giving heed to their evidence: over our thoughts, which naturally
are only evil, and that continually, etc.

Thirdly, But above all our other internal parts, we must keep this watch over
our hearts, Prove. 4.23. Heb. 3.12. For the heart is the treasury, either

Fourthly, We must take heed of nourishing in our hearts such corruptions as

1. Watch against those sins to which through our natural corruption we are
most inclined: and that 1. Because of all others, we have most cause to abhor
them, seeing by them we have most dishonored, and displeased God. 2. They have
most often wounded our consciences, and given us the greatest foils. 3. They
have most disturbed our inward peace, and deprived us of spiritual joy, in the
assurance of Gods love. 4. We are still most prone to fall into them, our
corrupt natures being so much inclined to them, and our carnal love doting upon
them.


2. We must most heedfully watch against those sins which do most ordinarily
attend our special callings, because being daily conversant in them, they make
daily, and dangerous assaults against our souls: and by reason of our many
falls and foils, they become customable, and hearden our hearts in them. Hence
are these exhortations, Luke 3.12, 13, 14. and 12.15. Acts 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.2.

3. We must watch over our hearts, that they be not drawn away with the sins of
the times, and Countries wherein we live, because we are apt to follow a
multitude to do evil, and are easily led aside by bad example: and being fallen
into them, we are apt to continue in them without remorse, the multitude of
offenders taking away the sense of sin.



1. In restraining them of their liberty, and not suffering them to rove at
their pleasure, nor to satisfy themselves, even to satiety with sensual
delights, and full fruition of their several objects: but sometimes stopping
them in their course, we should call them to an account, whether the things
about which they are exercised are as profitable to our souls, as pleasant to
our senses.

2. When we allow our senses to take their pleasure, we must carefully take
heed that they delight themselves only in things lawful both for matter,
measure, and manner: so using these sensual pleasures as not abusing them: as
helps to make us to go on more cheerfully in our way, and not as impediments to
hinder us in our journey.

Quest. How must we watch over our eyes?

Answ. By not suffering them to rove about at pleasure, and to glut themselves
with delightful sights, and restraining them as much as we can, that they do
not behold that in this kind which is not lawful to covet: For of seeing comes
loving, and of loving, lusting, and desiring, Matthew. 5.28. we must keep them
from gazing upon any thing that may be to us a ground of tentation, whereby we
may be drawn into any sin, or which may be a distraction to us in Gods service.
Thus Job watched over his eyes, Job 31.1. and this is Solomon's meaning, when he
says, that the wise man's eyes are in his head, but the eyes of a fool are in
the ends of the earth, Eccles. 2.14. because a wise man leaves not his eyes to
their own liberty, but governs them by discretion, whereas fools suffer them to
rove every where. Into which folly David fell, when he suffered his eyes to
gaze upon the beauty of Bathshebah, and therefore afterward he kept a surer
watch over them, and entreated God to turn away his eyes from beholding vanity,
Psalm. 119.37.

Quest. How must we watch over our ears?

Answ. To keep them from hearing any thing that is vain, and sinful, tending to
the corrupting of our souls, or the hindering of them in their growth in grace:
All filthy speeches tend to Gods dishonor, and to our own, and our neighbors
hurt: So does all unsavory talk, bitter taunts, unchristan jests, whisperings,
backbitings, and slandering, and all such discourses as feed the flesh, and
starve the Spirit, wed us to the world, and wean us from God: we must therefore
stop our ears against these bewitching sorceries, and not for the pleasing our
carnal sense, hazard the destruction of our precious souls. The ears like
Conduit-pipes, convey into the soul, either the clear streams of the water of
life, or the filthy puddles of sin, and death.

Quest. How must we watch over our pallates;

Ans. That we do not, to please our pallat, use such excess in our diet, as
will disenable us to Christian duties: knowing that the end of our eating is to
refresh and strengthen our bodies, that they may be fit for Gods service, that
has fed them, and not the pampering of the flesh with sensual delight: To give
way to our appetite, is to bring innumerable evils upon our selves: As upon our
bodies sickness, and death: upon our souls and bodies both, sloth and
idleness, unfitness to any good action, drowsiness, or vain mirth, shortness of
memory, dullness of understanding, wanton dalliance, and inflammation of our
hearts with unlawful lusts.

Quest. How must we watch over our sense of touching?

Answ. That to please it, we do not enslave our selves to effeminate
daintiness, thinking our selves undone, if we cannot roll our selves upon our
beds of down, and go in soft raiment, and, Dives-like, be clothed in purple,
and fine linen every day: But we should so inure our selves, that we may not
think it strange and intolerable to lie hardly, and go hardly, if Christ who
suffered so much for us, call us to suffer a little for the testimony of his
truth: Much more must we restrain this sense from unlawful objects, as unchaste
kisses, lascivious embraces, and wanton daliances, which tend to the inflaming
of our hearts with unclean lusts, and defiling our bodies, which should be the
Temples of the Holy Ghost.

Quest. How must we watch over our tongues?

Answ. We must resolve with David, Psalm. 39.1. I will take heed to my ways,
that I sin not with my tongue. For the well ordering thereof is a matter of
great moment, for furthering, or hindering us in our Christian conversation.
Prove. 15.4. A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, etc. If we use it well, it
will be our glory, it being a notable instrument of glorifying God, by speaking
to his praise: and then if we honor God, he will honor us, 1 Samuel 2.30. but
if we abuse it to sin, it will become our shame, seeing thereby we dishonor
God, who has given it us, and all good things. Hereby we may edify our
brethren, Prove. 15.7, and 25.11. But if we vent froth, and filthiness, we shall
corrupt them, 1 Cor. 15.31. By the well using of it we shall have comfort,
Prove. 15.23. and 18.20. It evidenceth that we are upright in Gods sight, Psalm.
37.30. Perfect men, Jam. 3.2. but the contrary is a sign of a rotten, and
wicked heart, Matthew. 12.34, 35. Life and death are in the power of it, Prove.
18.21. Matthew. 12.37. By our words we shall be justified, or condemned,
therefore let us resolve with David, Psalm. 71.24. that our tongues shall speak
of righteousness all the day long, etc. Yet we must moderate our tongues by
seasonable silence, that they be not too full of talk. For Prove. 10.19. in many
words there is much sin. So Prove. 17.27, 28. and 21.23. Eccles. 10.14. Job
13.5. Iam. 1.19.

Quest. How should we watch over our works and actions?

Answ. That they may in all things be conformable to the word, and will of God,
whilst we do what he commands, and abstain from what he has forbidden. Thus
we are exhorted, Prove. 4.26. Ponder the path of thy feet, etc. and its made the
mark of a truly wise man, Prove. 14.15, 16. A prudent man looks well to his
going, etc. for we tread upon slippery places,, whilst we are managing our
worldly affairs. For this end

1. We must spend none of our precious time in sloth, and idleness, (for by
doing nothing, we shall quickly learn to do that which is ill) but that we be
always exercised in some good impolyment that respects Gods glory, our own, or
our neighbors good.

2. That with (...) care, and circumspection we keep our selves from all
sinful actions, and if sin begin to arise in our hearts, presently to stiflle
it, that it bring not forth fruit unto death.

3. We must watch over them, that we may not only shun evil, but do good,
whereby God may be glorified, and our light may shine before men, our
profession may be adorned, our neighbors edified, and our calling and election
secured to our own souls.

Quest. What are the principal ends that we must aim at in this circumspect
walking?

Answ. First, that we may please God in all things, for which end this watch is
very necessary. For naturally all our ways are corrupt, and without singular
care we can never please God.

Pro. 6.27. who can carry fire in his bosom and not be burnt? Hence, Prove. 5.8.
and 4.14, 15. Isa. 33.15. Psalm. 119.37.



Quest. What reasons may persuade us to this watchfulness and circumspection?

Answ. First, because its most necessary, Deuteronomy. 4.9. Take heed to thy self,
etc. Luke 12.36. Let your loins be girt about, etc. Jos. 22.5. and 23.11. Mar.
13.33, 37. Rev. 3.2. and its thus necessary,

1. Because through our corruption we are exceeding weak, whence it is that we
are so prone to sin, and easily overcome with tentations, if we neglect our
watch. Hence, Mat. 26.41. Watch and pray, lest ye fall into tentation, etc. 1
Cor. 10.12. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. So, Phil. 2
13. Prove. 28.14.

2. Because naturally we are drowsy, and sleepy, and even the wise Virgins
were prone to take a nap, and therefore God calls upon us to awake, Ephesians. 5.14.
Cant. 5.2.

3. Because of the wickedness and deceitfulness of our hearts, which are
ready to withdraw themselves from God, and to start aside like a deceitful
bow, Jer. 17.10. Psalm. 78.57. Hence it is that the Lord warns us hereof, Deuteronomy.
11.16. Take heed that your hearts be not deceived, and ye turn aside. So, Heb.
3.12.

4. Because without it we can have no assurance that we are spiritually
enlightened, and awakened out of the sleep of death. For this is the difference
between the faithful and unbelievers, 1 These. 5.5, 6, 7.



1. Because it helps us much to the leading of a godly life, in which we
thrive, or go backwards as we keep, or intermit our Christian watch. For when
we watch over our selves: God will likewise watch over us, and by the
assistance of his holy Spirit enable us to stand against all tentations, and to
go forward in our Christian course: but when, through our negligence, we
wilfully run into tentations, he leaves us to be foiled, that we may learn to
take better heed. If we be not wanting to our selves, the Lord will enlighten
our understandings to discern the right way wherein we should walk, Ephesians. 4.14.
and when we see our way we shall have our faith strengthened, and our courage
confirmed to proceed in it: Hence these are joined together, 1 Cor. 16.13.
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit your selves like men, be strong, Noah,
David, Lot, Peter, etc. whilst they carefully kept their watch, triumphed over
the enemies of their salvation, but laying it aside, they were dangerously
foiled. It conduces much also to a godly life, as it makes us fit and ready
for the well performing of all Christian duties. Hence, Psalm. 119.9.

2. It helps us much: as it enableth us to be constant in this course, and to
persevere in it even to the end. It strengthens us against all discouragements,
enables us to avoid, or leap over all impediments, or oppositions which might
encounter us in our Christian course.

3. Its a notable means of Christian security: so that keeping this course, we
may say with David, Psalm. 23.4. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, yet will I fear no evil: Such may lay them down safely, as he, Psalm.
4.8. and take their rest, etc. It procures inward peace: For if God be with us,
who can be against us, Romans 8.31. From which peace arises spiritual joy also, 1
Pet. 1.8.

4. By it we are fitted for all estates, so that prosperity shall not puff us
up whilst we keep our watch, nor adversity shall discourage us in our journey to
our heavenly Country. For, Act. 14.22. Heb. 12.6.

5. By this watch we are prepared against Christ's coming to judgment, and
prepared to enter into the joy of our Master: as we see in the parables of the
faithful Steward and wise Virgins.

6. By this watch we are assured of blessedness, Luke 12.37, 38, 43. Mat.
24.46, 47. Rev. 16.15.

Quest. What means may we use to enable us to this circumspect walking and
keeping our watch?

Answ. First, we must use sobriety and temperance, 1 Pet. 5.7, 8. 1 These. 5.5,
6.

Secondly, we must nourish in our hearts the true fear of God, not a servile
fear, Psalm. 130.4. This fear is promised, Jer. 32.42. This causes us to depart
from evil, Prove. 14.16. and 16.6. Hence David, Psalm. 4.4. Stand in awe and sin
not: the want of it is the cause of all evil, Genesis 20.11. Ps. 36.1. Romans 3.18,
19, 20.

Thirdly, we must often call to remembrance Gods fearful judgments executed on
sinners, especially on such as continue securely in sin, neglecting to keep
this Mat. 24.38. Isa. 47.8, 9. Rev. 3.3. Hence Paul minds us of them, 1 Cor.
10.5. to 12.

Fourthly, we must continually remember the day of our death, not as though it
were far off, but near approaching, even at our doors. Our lives are momentany,

Fifthly, we must often meditate upon that great and terrible day of the Lord;
Cor. 5.10. of which day, because its uncertain when it will come, we should
always keep our spiritual watch, that when Christ comes we may be found ready.
This Christ himself teaches us, Mar. 13.32, 33. so, 1 Pet. 4.7. Blessed are all
that do so, Mat. 24.45, 46.

CHAP. XXXII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about the comforts of Gods
people.
Quest. HAve Gods people always comfort in their souls?

Answ. God may hide his comforts from them for a time, but at length they shall
shine out upon them again, Psalm. 34.19.

Quest. Why does God sometimes hide comfort from them?

Answ. First, To show forth his wisdom, and Psalm. 112.4. To turn all things to
the best, Romans 8.28.

Secondly, Its the godly man's privilege above all others, to find God sweet
to their souls, either in afflictions, or by deliverance out of them: and

1. Because their persons are accepted with God, whereas others are rejected.

2. They are sealed with the earnest of Gods Spirit, and can go to God in
fervent prayer, which others cannot, Psalm. 18.41.

3. They have the grace of repentance which removes sin, that caused God to
hide his face.

4. They have patience which supports them till God returns with comfort.

Thirdly, Its one end of Gods much humbling, and afflicting his Children, not
to sink, or forsake them, but that at last his powerful work may be Deuteronomy.
8.16. Job 23.10. 1 Pet. 1.7.

Fourthly, God manifests hereby his care, and faithfulness in his promises,
whereby he has engaged himself not to leave them comfortless: Dr. Tailor on
Temp.

Quest. What is the only way to find comfort in the time of Spiritual
distress?

Answ. To fly unto God, and seek it of him, Psalm. 51.1, 2. and 120.1. and
73.25. etc. So did Paul, 2 Cor. 12.8.

Quest. Why must we do thus?

Answ. First, because there is a command for it, Psalm. 50.15^

Isa. 65.24.

Pro. 18.8. Ephesians. 3.20.

Mich. 7.18. He is near to all that call upon him, Psalm 145.18. So Psalm. 46.1.

Gal. 4.6. Romans 8.26. Hieron on Psalm. 51.

Quest. But has God comforts wherewith to support his children in any fears
and straits?

Answ. Yea, he has such consolations, as will make a man sleep without a bed,
live almost without a soul, they will make one bold in danger, quiet in
trouble, and to live in the jaws of death. Nehem. 8.10. Act. 16.24. Psalm. 3.5,
6. and 94.19.

Quest. But whence comes their strength?

Answ. First, Because they be Gods joys, the joys of the Spirit, derived
immediately from the Fountain, and things be purest, and strongest there.

Secondly, Because they are spiritual, and as spirits are more active then
bodies,

Thirdly, This comfort is most certain, and lasting; they (for the present)

Fourthly, It is independent, and in a sort all-sufficient, borrowing no help

Quest. But what be these comforts of God?

Answ. First, Precious promises, applied by God in due season, and brought home
to the heart, which revive the spirits more then any Balm.

Secondly, Strengthening graces, God powers the Spirit of Faith, patience,

Jacob, and to say with Paul, I know whom I have trusted: and with the Church,
Thou will guide us unto the death, and after, receive us unto glory.



Quest. When does God thus comfort his?

Answ. First, when they most need it, as then the Mother brings out her
Cordials when the child is sick, when they be most humbled, and empty of
themselves: After greatest humiliations, come greatest consolations.

Secondly, But especially in the day of trial and persecution: The more the
Jacob spent, were in the field: So with Peter in prison, Acts 12. and David had
those large affections to rise at midnight, and Gods word was so sweet to him,
when his troubles were bitter. Dr. Haris Peter's enlargement.

Quest. Whence comes it to pass that Gods children often want comfort?

Answ. They fault is in themselves, and it usually proceeds from some of these
causes.

1. The are unkind to Christ, and repel the motions of his Spirit. 2. They
improve not the precious means of Salvation which they enjoy. 3. They are
careless of their conversation, and company. 4. They linger after carnal
liberty, and ease. 5. They yield to carnal Policy, and shifts to keep them off
from the power of Religion that they may go on in a lukewarm course. 6. They
linger after earthly things and comforts, and wrap up themselves in fleshly
Policy for ease. 7. They tremble not at Gods judgments, and threatenings, and
at the signs of them. Dr. Sibs on Cant.
CHAP. XXXIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Comforting others.
Quest. WHat rules are we to observe about comforting others?

Answ. First, labor to know their case, what is the kind and cause of their
trouble, whether inward, or Paul sent Tychicus to Collosse to know their state,
and comfort their hearts, Col. 4.8.

Secondly, when we know that, we must pity and sympathize with them: For Job
19.21. God is first a Father of mercies, and then a God of all consolation, 2
Cor. 1.3, 4.

Thirdly, when this is done, then we must apply suitable comforts to their

(1.) If their trouble arise from want, then comfort them as Christ did his
Disciples, Mat. 6.25, etc.

1. From the consideration of Gods providence in feeding fowls, clothing
flowers, etc.

2. From Gods knowledge of their necessities, Mat. 6.32.

3. From Gods promises, v. 33. and Psalm. 34.9, 10.

(2.) If it arises from loss of friends, and near relations: See how Paul
comforts the Thessalonians, 1 These. 4.13, etc.

1. That Christ died and rose again, v. 14.

2. They that die in the Lord sleep in Jesus.

3. Christ at his coming will bring their souls with him, and raising their
bodies will reunite them for ever, ver. 15, 16.

4. They with their formerly deceased friends shall be caught up to meet the
Lord in the air, v. 17.

5. They shall ever be with the Lord, v. 18. and that it is a duty to comfort
others when their friends die, appears by the example of David, 2 Samuel 10.2. Of
the Jews, Joh. 11.19, 31. the neglect is threatened as a sad affliction, Jer.
16.6, 7.

(3.) If it arise from persecution: See how Christ comforts his Disciples, Mat.
5.10, 11, 12. As, 1. That they are therefore blessed. 2. Great shall be their
reward in heaven. 3. That the Prophets before them suffered the like. 4. That
at present they have cause to rejoice, and be exceeding glad. So, 1 Pet. 4.12,
etc. Peter uses sundry arguments in the like case; as


1. The end of persecution is to try their faith, and patience, sincerity and
constancy: as the fire the gold.

2. In suffering for Christ they are partakers of Christ's sufferings in way of
community, and conformity, who suffered the like things for his confession of
the truth: and they that have fellowship with Christ in his sufferings shall
have communion with him in glory, etc. v. 13.

3. They are happy: their sufferings being both a sign and means of their
happiness, v. 14.

4. They that are reproached for the name of Christ have the glorious Spirit of
God resting on them, which is glorified, not only by them, but in them, and
makes them glorious, v. 14.

5. Such sufferings are no strange thing, but what is common: no matter of
grief nor shame, but of joy, and honor to suffer as a Christian: and for which
they should praise God, v. 12, 13, 16.

6. Its Gods will that they should suffer, and bear the cross patiently, and
suffer according to his will, v. 19.

7. In such sufferings they may comfortably commit the keeping of their souls
to God in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator, and gracious Redeemer, and
fulfiller of his promises, v. 19.

(4.) If it arise from desertion, and terrors of conscience, see how Christ
provides for their comfort, Isa. 61.1, 2, 3. and 54.7, 8. and 50.10. and 57.15,
16, 17, 18.

(5.) If the affliction be any other kind of correction, propose Paul's grounds
of comfort, H^b. 12, 5, etc.

1. All chastisements are the rod of a Father, who will neither forget mercy,
nor measure, v. 5.

2. They proceed from Gods love, v. 6.

3. They are signs and pledges of Adoption, that we are sons, and not
bastards, ver. 6, 7, 8.

4. Submission to chastisements is the way to life and salvation, v. 9. Act.
14.22.

5. Gods end therein is our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness,
v. 10.

6. Though they be sad and troublesome at the present, yet in the issue they
will be comfortable. For we shall reap the peaceable fruits of righteousness
thereby, and be both bettered and comforted thereby.

Quest. But what are the best means whereby we may comfort others?

Answ. First, use kind and loving speeches which will revive, and refresh the
spirits of him that is disconsolate: So Joseph to his brethren, Genesis 50.20, 21.
Boaz to Ruth, chapter 2.13. so the Angel, Zach. 11.13.



Romans 15.4. David found it by experience, Ps. 119.50.82.93. Scripture comforts
are the chiefest, coming home to the heart, and are efficacious to revive
fainting souls, having the consolations of God in them, and his blessing upon
them, 1 These. 4.18.



1. Our own experience of Gods dealing with us in the like conditions, and of
the comforts wherewith God has comforted us for this end that we might comfort
others therewith, 1 Cor. 1.3, 4, 6. These made Christ himself a more
sympathizing and merciful High Priest, Heb. 4.15. So 2 Cor. 7.6, 7, 13. So
Peter is commanded, Luke 22.32.

2. We should comfort others by the experiences others have had of Gods mercies
to them.

Fifthly, the exercise, and evidence of our graces is a good means of
comforting

1. Of our faith and love, Romans 1.11, 12. 1 These. 3.6, 7. Phil. 2.1. Philem. 7.
2 Cor. 7.7.

2. Our constancy in the truth, and work of the Lord, 1 These. 3.8, 9. Col.
4.11. 2 John 4.3 John 4. Phil. 2.19.

Sixthly, prayer to God for them is another means: and that,

1. For comfort to be conveyed into their hearts. So did Paul, Col. 2.1, 2.

2. That God would give us the gift of comforting others, the tongue of the
learned, promised, Isa. 50.4.

Seventhly, consider the persons who are fit to be comforted; As,

1. In general, Gods people above all others; its their portion, and bread Isa.
48.22. with chapter 40.1, 2. So Christ, Mat. 9.22.

2. Weak and faint souls, 1 These. 5.14. comfort the feeble minded, etc. Isa.
35.3, 4. strong then the weak hands, etc. so does God himself, 2 Cor. 7.6.
contrary is reproved, ^zek. 34.4.

3. Mourners for sin, or for want of Gods presence, and for misery.

1. Mourners for sin, who are deeply humbled in the sight and sense thereof,
and in the apprehension of Gods displeasure: So did Peter, Act. 2.37, 38. and
Paul, Act. 16.29, 30, 31. and Christ, Luke 7.37, 48. He has pronounced such
blessed, Mat. 5.4. and Isa. 57.18. 2. Mourners for want of Gods presence, and
the light of his countenance; such have need of comfort, the Bridegroom being
taken from them, Mat. 9.15. 3. Mourners for misery ought to be comforted: as
the Jews, whilst captives in Babylon, Isa. 40.1, 2. implied, Job 29.25. with
Job 6.14. Its needful for such, as wine for those that be of heavy hearts,
Prove. 31.6, 7. 4. Seekers after Christ* as, Cant. 3.1, 3. should be comforted;
as the Angel did the women, Mat. 28.5, etc. and Christ, Mary Magdalen, Joh.
20.11. to 19.
Eighthly, write letters, send messengers, and take journeys on purpose to
comfort

1. Write consolatory letters to the afflicted, as Paul did his Epistles to
Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse, etc. and to particular persons, as to Timothy,
Titus, and Philemon: So did James, Peter, John, Jude, and Christ to the
Churches of Asia, Rev. 2.10, 11. and 3.10, 11.

2. Send messengers, as Paul a prisoner sent Tichicus, and On^simus to the
Colossians to know their state, and comfort their hearts, Col. 4.7, 8, 9. and
Tichicus to the Ephesians, chapter 6.21.22. and Timothy to the Thessalonians, 1
These. 3.1, 2, 5. whose returns with good tidings much comforted him, 2 Cor.
7.6, 7. 1 These. 3.6, 7.

3. Take journeys to comfort others. Paul prayed for it, Romans 1.10, 21, 11. and
longed for it, 1 These. 3.9, 10, 11.

Quest. But who should we be so solicitous to comfort others?

Answ. First, because of the necessity, and commodity of comfort in
afflictions,

1. Comfort is useful and needful for others in six respects.

1. To support, and bear them up from sinking under the pressures of troubles
inward or outward, Pr^. 18.14. the spirit of a man, (being shored up with
comfort) will bear his infirmities; but a wounded spirit, (that wants the
healing plaster of consolation) who can bear. 2. To quicken them, and keep
life in their spirits: and to preserve, or recover them from fainting, and
swounding. Comfort is the life of our spirits, yea the life of our lives,
without which our life would be no (...), but a lingering death; the damned in
hell are said to die eternally, because they are void of all joy and comfort.
3. To cheer, and refresh them* to raise them up from their sorrow, Psalm. 94.19.
In the multitude of my thoughts within me (says David) thy comforts (breathed
into me by thy Spirit, or handed unto me by thy servants) delight my soul.
Comforts pour the oil of gladness into hearts full of heaviness. Comfort is
honey in the mouth, melody in the ear, and a Jubilee in the heart. 4. Its
needful to quiet and compose the Spirits of others, when inwardly disquieted,
and perplexed; they cause a calm in a tempest. 5. To establish, confirm, and
settle others that are in a good frame of spirit, to hold their spirits fast
from being shaken. Paul wrote his consolatory Epistle to the Corinthians, that
they might stand fast in the faith, etc. 1 Cor. 16.13. To the Ephesians, that
they might not be carried about with every wind of doctrine, Ephesians. 4 14. To the
Colossians, that they might be rooted, and built up in Christ, and established
in the faith, Col. 2.6, 7. He sent Timothy to the Thessalonians, to establish,
and comfort them concerning their faith, 1 These. 3.2. 6. Its commodious to
edify others in their holiness, and obedience: Comfort as well as council
builds men up further into the body of Christ: For it corroborates the heart,
heightens their spirits (with Paul) to forget those things that are behind,
etc. Phil. 3.13. Paul exhorts the Thessalonians to comfort, and edify one
another, i. e. to edify by comforting, 1 These. 5.11. For, 1. Comfort is a
great encouragement to duties, as Hezekiahs comfortable words were to the
Levit^s that taught the good knowledge of the Lord, 2 Chronicles. 30.22. and to the
hearts of the people, to animate them against the fear of the King of Assiria,
2 Chronicles. 32.6, 7, 8. 2. Its a means to lead others forward on toward
perfection: Hence they are joined together, 2 Cor. 13.11. Be perfect, be of
good comfort.

2. Comfort may be needful also in respect of the bodies of others, or outward
man, which would perish in their afflictions, were not their souls strengthened
by comforts to stand under the pressures thereof.

We to him that is alone, Eccles. 4.10. It much aggravated David's troubles,
Psalm. 69.19, 20. and 143.3, 4. and Sions miseries, Lam. 1.2, 8, 16, 17, 21. So
Solomon judged it, Eccles. 4.1. It was the Jews sad case in their captivity,
Isa. 54.11. and Ninivehs in her ruin, Nah. 3.7.



1. Its the work of God to comfort poor souls, Isa. 57.15. 2 Cor. 7.6. He
glories in it, as in a title of excellency, 2 Cor. 1.3. Isa. 51.12. v. 3. Ps.
103.13. Isa. 66.13. and 49.15. To comfort is the act, as of the Deity, so of
the Trinity, and of every person in it.

1. Of God the Father, who is the Father of mercies, and the God of all
comfort, 2 Corinthians. 1.3. 2. Of God the Son; for he as God-man, and Mediator, is
the fountain of all consolation, Phil. 2.1. If there be any consolation in
Christ: He takes it for granted that there is. So, 2 Cor. 1.5. John 14.18. and
16.20, 22. 3. Of God the Holy Ghost. Its his proper work to apply comfort to
the hearts of Gods children from the Father, and the Son. Hence he is called,
the Comforter: He is prayed for by the Son to the Father, and promised to be
sent from both for this end, Joh. 14.16, 26. and 15.26. and 16.7.
Quest. How is God the Father the author of Comfort?

Answ. By destination, and appointment of it to us: For he has appointed us to
obtain, as salvation, so consolation by Jesus Christ. Hence its said to abound
by Christ, 2 Cor. 1.3, 4, 5.

Quest. How is God the Son the author of comfort?

Answ. First, by redemption, or purchase, as of us, so of joy, and comfort for
us,

Secondly, By reception of it: as Christ bought it, so he took it, and keeps it
for us: when he ascended on high, he received, as gifts, so comforts for men,
Psalm. 68.18. It pleased the Father that all comfort should be laid up in Christ
as in a treasury, and that he should send forth the same to his people, as the
fountain does water.

Thirdly, by dispensation, or office, as he is our Prophet, which he executes,
and so comforts us, by his Spirit which he has given us.

Quest. How is the Holy Ghost the author of consolation?

Answ. By applying it to us (which is his proper work) even all that comfort
which the Father has appointed to us, and the Son has obtained, and kept for
us.

Yea, to comfort others has been the practice of the godly, as of Job, chapter
4.3, 4. Of the Prophets, Isa. 40.1, 2. Of the Apostles, Philem. 21.

Fourthly, from the equity of the duty: we ought to do it for these reasons.

1. Because we would be comforted by others in our distress: and therefore

2. All true Christians have an interest in comfort: its their portion, and
therefore in comforting them we give them but their own.

3. Its the end why God gives us abilities, and experiences that we may use
them to comfort others, so that hereby we are debtors to others, 2 Cor. 1.4.

4. Its our office as we are members of the same body with them, Ephesians. 4.16.
hereby we edify our selves in our most holy faith, Judge. 20. Love knits
Christians together, and makes them communicative of good one to another.

CHAP. XXXIV. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Comforting afflicted
Consciences.
Quest. HOw may we comfort afflicted consciences that are wounded, and dejected
with the sense of sin, and of Gods wrath, and want of grace?

Answ. Set before them, and apply to them these eight grounds of consolation.

1. The boundlesness, and freeness of Gods pardoning, reconciling, accepting,
and healing Psalm. 103.11, 12, 17. therefore to doubt, or despair, is to
forsake our own mercies, and so to sin against mercy, which is one of the
highest, and most confounding aggravations of sin. Set also before them the
bowels of Gods compassions, which are most tender, and fail not, Lam. 3.22. The
riches of Gods free grace, which can neither be exhausted, nor diminished: and
the freeness, unchangableness, and everlastingness of his love to poor sinners
which deserved nothing but wrath, and judgment, Hos. 14.4. Jer. 31.3.

2. The infiniteness of Christ's merits, of his death, passion, and obedience
which is sufficient to satisfy Gods justice, to pacify his wrath, and fulfill
his Law Acts 20.28. Set before them also the plenteousness of redemption that
is in Christ, that he can and will deliver them from all their sins: the
prevalency of his intercession to make application of his redemption, and the
benefits thereof to sinners on earth, whereby he is able to save to the
uttermost all that come to God by him, Heb. 7.29.

3. The free, gracious, and general tender of Christ, and of pardon, peace,
grace, joy, and glory with him, to all, and every one that will receive him,
without Joh. 3.16. Mar. 16.15, 16. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. and Christ sends his
Ministers, as Ambassadors, to beseech men to be reconciled to him. For as
Moses lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness; so is Christ lifted up upon the
pole of the Gospel, that whosoever believes in him should not perish: therefore
we must take heed of rejecting these tenders of grace and mercy.

4. Set before them Christ's gracious invitation of all to come to him that
feel Matthew. 11.28. Isa. 65.1. Set also before them Christ's promise of
reception, and of not rejecting any that come to him, Joh. 6.37. and his
complaint that men will not come to him, Joh. 5.40.

Manasseh, 2 Chro. 33.2, 3, 11, 12, 13. with 2 Kin. 24.4. To Paul 1 Timothy 1.13,
14, 15. To Mary Magdalen, Mar. 16.9. To the woman who had been a notorious
sinner, Luke 7.37, 38, 48. To some of the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.

Job, chap. 13.24, 26. and 7.14, 15, 20. and 30.28. with chap. 42.4, 12. In
Heman Psalm. 88.3, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17. In David, Psalm. 143.4. and 42.11. and
119.25. and 38.2, 3, 4, 6, 8. In Christ himself, Math. 26.38. Luke 22.44. In
Mr. Peacock, Mr. Glover. Mis. Katherine Bretergh. See these in my book of
Examples.



1. Gods promises of healing wounded spirits, and broken hearts, Deuteronomy. 32.39.
Psalm. 1^7.^. Job 5.18. Luke 4.18. Isa. 57.19. 1 Pet. 2.24. with Hos. 6.1.

2. Gods promises of quickening made to dead souls buried in the grave of
desertion, to revive, and raise them up, Deuteronomy. 32.39. 1 Samuel 2.6, 7. Ezekiel
37.11, 12, 13, 14. Gods promises of giving his Spirit to be a Comforter, Joh.
6.36. For which end he dwells in broken hearts, Isa. 57.15. This was the
confidence of Gods people, Hos. 6.1.2. and of David, Psalm. 71.20.

3. Gods promises of inlightning made to such as walk in darkness, and that 1.
Of causing his face to shine upon them, after he had hid it from them, Isa.
54.8. 2. Of making Christ, the Sun of righteousness to arise with healing
under his wings, Mal. 4.2. Isa. 50.10. Mich. 7.8.


4. Gods promises of returns with peace, and joy, Isa. 54.7. 1 Samuel 12.22. Lam.
3.31, 32. Psalm. 94.19. God is an everlasting Father, Isa. 9.6. So David assures
himself, Psalm. 31.22. See more such promises, Mich. 7.19. Joh. 14.18. and
16.22. Isa. 57.16.19. Phil. 4.7. Job 34.29. Psalm. 85.8. and 38.5, 11, 12. and
97.11. and 126.5. Matthew. 5.4. Joh. 16.20, 22. Acts 2.28.



1. That grace may be hid for a time in the heart like sparks of fire in the
ashes: there is a difference between the being of a thing in it self, and the
discovery thereof to us: As many things seem to be which are not, so somethings
are, which seem not: and that

1. Because the seed of God remains in them, 1 John 3.9. Grace may be to seek
sometimes when we have occasion to use it, but it can never be lost.

2. The gifts, and calling of God are without repentance, Romans 11.29. God does
not give them, and take them away again from his servants.

3. The perpetuity of grace is founded upon the immutability of God, and his
free love, and good will, so that as he is ever the same in his affection to
them, so he will continue them to be ever in the same relation to him, Heb.
13.8. John 13.1.

4. Both they, and the grace of God in them are kept by the power of God to
salvation, 1 Pet. 1.5. none is able to pluck grace out of them, no more then to
pluck them out of Gods hand, Joh. 10.28, 29.

5. The golden chain of salvation cannot be broken, and all the links in it are
inseparable, Romans 8.30.

Persuade such poor souls that grace has its seasons of hiding it self, and of
appearing, as the Sun has his time of setting, and rising, and to conclude the
nonexistence of grace from the not appearing of it, is all one as to say, the
Sun will never rise because its set.

Persuade them to defer passing sentence upon themselves, till they be in a
calm estate, and capacity of making a right judgment of themselves.

Whilst their spirits are in a perplexed estate persuade them to hearken to
the counsel of Christian friends, who, at such a time, can better judge of them
then they of themselves.

2. That desire of grace is grace, and that,

1. Because true desires have the nature, and truth of grace in them, though in
a small measure: as there is true fire in a spark: true water in a drop; the
least of any thing partakes of the nature of the whole.

2. Desires are the seeds and beginnings of grace in the soul, out of which
grace grows to its full measure, and stature; as corn sown in the earth; So
desires are grace in the seed: Habits are grace in the blade: Acts are grace in
the ear; and perfect works are full corn in the ear.

3. Good desires are accepted and rewarded by God, as well as deeds: yea, for
deeds when power to actuate them is wanting, 2 Cor. 8.12. God estimates his
people rather according to their affections then actions; as 1 King. 8.18. with
2 Samuel 11.7. so in Abraham, Genesis 22.1^, 16. and the poor widow, Mar. 12.42,
etc. therefore Gods servants have pleaded their wills, and desires before God
rather then their deeds: as Nehemiah, chap. 1.11. David, Psalm. 38.9. and Paul,
Romans 7.16. to 21.

4. Good desires are the work of God in us as well as deeds, Phil. 2.1^. and he
will perfect them in us, Phil. 1.6. God does not his work by the halves, 1 Samuel
3.12. Psalm. 138.8. Christ is the author of our Faith in desires after it, Heb.
12.2. they are the smoke of the flax which Christ will not quench, Matthew. 12.20.

5. God has made many promises to desires. 1. Of acceptance, 2 Cor. 8.12. 2.
Of supply and satisfaction, Psalm. 145.19. God stirs up desires for this end,
that he may satisfy them. 3. Of blessedness, Mat. 5.6. 4. Of water of life,
and of the spirit* John 7.37, 39. 5. Of spiritual wine, and milk, Isa. 55.1, 2.
Luke 1.53.

Object. But how shall we know that our desires are true, and such to whom
these promises do belong.

Answ. First, by the root: For true desires of Christ and grace do spring,

1. From an heart humbled before God in the sight of its sin and misery, of
its own vileness and unworthiness. Hence, Psalm. 10.17.

2. From a soul sensible of its spiritual necessities, as of Christ, grace, the
things that accompany salvation, pardon of sin, power over it, etc.

3. From a mind enlightened to see, as the want, so the worth and necessity of
these things.

Secondly, by the fruits, or effects. True desires put forth serious, and
suitable Ps. 27.4. they will watch daily at wisdoms gates, Prove. 8.34.



1. They are sincere, and that 1. For ground, when they are carried out after
Christ, and spiritual things as well for their sakes as for our own. 2. For
ends, when desires have spiritual aims, as the mark they shoot at, viz. to make
us humble, obedient, serviceable, conformable to Christ, and acceptable to God
through Christ.


2. They are stirring, vigorous, and vehement for temper, and measure:
therefore called, hungring, and thirsting: So, Psalm. 42.1. and they must needs
be so, because they proceed from the bottom of the heart, and from the whole
soul, Isa. 26.18. such shall find God, Jer. 29, 13. now the strength of holy
desires appears, 1. In preferring spirituals before temporals, Christ, and
Grace before Riches, Honors, etc. in being willing to part with any thing to
get Christ. To sell all to buy him, Luke 18.18, 22, 23. 2. In exceeding all
other desires in us in heat, and height: and in swallowing up all desires after
earthly things.


3. True desires are seasonable for time, whilst the things desired may be
obtained: they will seek God early. Indeed true desires are never too late, yet
late desires are seldom true; as we see in Esau, and the five foolish Virgins,
Matthew. 25.1, etc*

4. They are constant for duration, not by fits and starts when stirred, upon
some special Emergencies, or occasions: they are restless till they are
satisfied, Psalm. 119.20. and 143.6.

In the next place.



1. That the do not dishonor God in the time of their desertions by unworthy
thoughts of him, or hard speeches against him: by murmuring at him, or
quarreling with his dispensations: This was the Psalmists fault, Psalm. 77.2, 7,
8. but he checks himself for it, ver. 10. the contrary was Jobs commendation,
Job 1.22. with 2.10.

2. That they do not destroy their own souls, either 1. By denying what God
has done for them in the beginnings of grace, saying that they are reprobates,
etc. whereby they bear false witness. 1. Against themselves, which is
unnatural. 2. Against the grace of God, and against the God of grace, which is
most ungrateful.
2. By refusing what God would give to them, viz. grace, mercy, peace, and joy:
wilful refusal whereof is wilful murder.


3. That they do not gratify Satan who is a liar, and the Father of lies: A
Murderer of souls from the beginning: An accuser of the brethren, Job 1.9. and
an accuser of God to us as if he were an hard Master, Genesis 3.4. Now men
gratify Satan.

1. By entertaining parley with him* as Eve did. He will certainly prove too
hard for us. 2. By hearkening to his suggestions, as these, or the like. 1. To
cast off Ordinances, to neglect duties public, or private, as if they were
needless, or to no purpose: Hereby he seeks to starve our souls. 2. To harbor
jealovsies, and evil surmises of God, or dishonorable thoughts of him: as if
he were not merciful, faithful, etc. 3. To cast away their confidence, and
lay hope aside, and to give over seeking, or waiting on God any longer, and to
throw themselves into the gulf of despair. 4. To make wrong judgment of
themselves and their condition, as if they were out of the state of grace, out
of Christ, etc. because for the present they cannot discern it: Or that they
are not the Lords, because they are so deeply distressed as none of his ever
were. 5. To follow Satan's prescripts for deliverance out of their
soul-troubles, which is to lay aside all thoughts, or cares about their souls:
to go to merry company, give themselves to pleasures, etc.

4. That they do not satisfy their disquieted hearts: and that, 1. By taking
offense at Gods dealing with them, or to be angry with God, or sullen. 2. By
giving way to sad perplexed thoughts, which gives Satan mighty advantage
against them. 3. By venting, or justifying the distempers of their hearts, as
Jonas, chap. 4.9. 4. By putting away comfort from them in a froward, peevish
humor when its tendered to them, lest God answer them accordingly, Psalm. 18.26.


Secondly, direct them to have special respect to three graces to nourish them:

1. Repentance for their sins, those especially which cause this trouble: for
which labor for a deep and unfeigned sorrow, till when they are not fit for
comfort.

2. Faith, which they must labor to strengthen by all means: as to trust in
God: His mercies and promises: In Christ, his merits and mediation: these are
strong refuges, Psalm. 42.5. Job 13.15. Psalm 56.3. Romans 1.17. 1 John 5.4.

3. Patience, which they must continually exercise in bearing Gods hand,
submitting to his will, waiting his leisure, etc.

Thirdly, take a right course for healing their distempers, and troubles of
soul,

1. By searching the sore to the bottom to find our the core, and cause
thereof, as Chirurgions do, by drawing the troubles of their heart to an head,
as their sorrow for sin in general, or for some one sin in special, etc.

2. By turning the stream of their passions into another channel, as Physicians
turn the course of blood in the nose by opening a vein: So turn their fear
of wrath, and hell into the channel of holy fear of God, and his goodness,
and their grief for penal evils, inward, or outward, into the channel of godly
sorrow for sin.

Fourthly, bear with their infirmities, as ignorance, frowardness, etc. Become
all things to them for their refreshment, and recovery, as Paul, 1 Cor. 9.20.

Mr. Reyners Rules for the government of the Tongue.

Quest. How may a man that is in distress of mind be comforted and relieved?

Answ. The most sure general remedy is to apply the promise of life everlasting
in and by the blood of Christ.

Quest. But what must be our (...) of proceeding in the application of this
promise?

Answ. Therein three rules are to be observed.

1. The party must disclose (if he know it) the cause of his particular
distress, that the remedy may the better be applied: and indeed the very
opening of the cause is a great ease to the mind.

2. If the cause can, and may be made known, then you must see whether the
party be fit to receive comfort: and that is, if he be humbled for his sins,
pray for pardon, and desires amendment: without this the word of comfort will
be misapplied to him.

Quest. But what if we do not find him humbled?

Answ. Your first and principal care must be to work in him some degree of
humiliation: for which end you must labor to convince him of sin, and then
show him the necessity of grief for it, at least, for some of his principal
sins; and herein two things must be remembered.

1. That their worldly sorrow must be turned into a godly sorrow: as when one
bleeds at nose, they open a vein to turn the course of it: so when men are
troubled with worldly sorrow, show them that they must grieve, not for worldly
respects, nor merely for fear of punishment, but principally for the dishonor
that redounds to God by their sins.

2. Take care that this sorrow be not a confused sorrow, because he is a sinner
as other men are; but a distinct sorrow for this, or that particular sin: and
then he that is grieved for one sin truly, and unfeignedly, will proportionably
be grieved for all the sins that he knows to be in himself.

3. Minister and apply comfort to him that thus confesses his sins, and is
truly humbled for them.

Quest. How must this comfort be administered?

Answ. It may be done by bringing the party within the compass of the promise
of life: and there be two ways of doing this: the one false, the other true.

Quest. What are the false ways?

Answ. First, some think that men may be brought within the Covenant, by the
doctrine of universal grace and redemption. But this way is both false and
unfit.

Quest. Why is it false?

Answ. Because all the promises of the Gospel are limited with the condition
of Faith, and Repentance, and are not universally made to all.

Object. But God would have all men to be saved, 1 Timothy 2.4.

Answ. The Apostle who is the best expounder of himself says, Acts* 17.30. The
time of ignorance God regarded not, but now he warns all men to repent. Now, i.
e. after the coming of Christ in the flesh: but it must not be enlarged to all
Adams posterity: So in that of Timothy, God would have all men to be saved, i.
e. Now in this last age of the world. So, 2 Cor. 6.2. Now is the acceptable
time, etc. Col. 1.16. Romans 16.26. Again, All men, i. e. not all particular men;
but some of all sorts, and kinds: So all is taken, 1 Timothy 2.1.

Object. But Paul says, 2 Cor. 5.18. God was in Christ reconciling the world
to himself; therefore the promise in Christ belongs to the whole world, and to
every particular person?

Answ. Paul answers it himself, Romans 11.15. the casting away of the Jews is
the reconciling of the world, i. e. of the Gentiles in the Last age of the
world: and so must that place to the Corinths be understood, viz. not of all,
and every man that lived in all ages, and times, but of them that were under
the Gospel, to be called out of all Nations, etc.

thee: To which the distressed party would answer: Christ died indeed for him
if he could receive him: but he by his sins has cut himself off from him,
and forsaken him, so that the benefit of his death will do him no good.

Quest. What then is the right way of administering comfort to such?

Answ. First, consider the grounds whereby a man that belongs to God may

Secondly, the right way whereby they must be used and applied.

Quest. What are those grounds?

Answ. First, recourse must not be had to all graces, and all degrees of grace;

1. The first ground of grace is this. A desire to repent, and believe in a
touched heart, is faith, and repentance it self; though not in its nature, yet
in Gods acceptance.

Quest. How may that be proved?

Answ. All grant that in them that have grace, God accepts of the will for the
deed, as, 2 Cor. 8.12.

2. God has annexed a promise of blessedness to the true and unfeigned desire
of grace, Matthew. 5.6. Rev. 21.6. so he promises, Psalm 10.17. and 145.19.

Object. But the desire of good things is natural, therefore God will not
regard it?

Answ. Desires are of two sorts.

1. Some be of such things as by the light of nature we know to be good, as of
wisdom, learning, honor, happiness, etc. and these indeed nature can desire:
But then 2. Others be above nature: as the desire of the pardon of sin,
reconciliation, and sanctification: and they which have a serious desire of
these, have a promise of blessedness.
Secondly, a godly sorrow, whereby a man is sorry for sin as sin, is the
Cor. 7.9. Paul rejoiced, because it was wrought in the Corinthians.

Quest. But how may this sorrow be known?

Answ. If the heart of him in whom it is, is so affected, that though there
were neither conscience, nor devil to accuse, nor Hell to punish, yet would he
be grieved, because God is offended by his sin.

Quest. But what if a man cannot reach to such a sorrow?

Answ. Art thou grieved for the hardness of thy heart, because thou can not
so grieve, thou may then conclude that thou have some measure of godly
sorrow; for nature cannot grieve for hardness of heart.

Thirdly, a settled purpose, and willingness to forsake all sin, is a good
beginning David, Psalm. 32.5. and the prodigal, Luke 15.17, 18.

Fourthly, To love a man because he is a child of God is a certain sign John
3.14. Mat. 10.41. Only remember that these desires must not be fleeting, but
constant, and increasing.

Quest. Having heard the grounds, what is then the way, whereby the party that
is in distress may be brought within the compass of the promise of salvation?

Answ. First, trial must be made whether the party has in him any of the before
named grounds of grace, or no. For which end, ask him whether he believe and
repent? If he say he cannot, then ask him whether he does not desire to do it?
and so of the other grounds.



Quest. That the promise thus applied may have good success, what rules are to
be observed?

Answ. First, that the comfort administered be allayed with some mixture of the
Law, lest the wound be too soon healed: For such usually become worst of all,
therefore bring them on by little and little to comfort, the sweetness whereof
will be greater, if it be qualified with some tartness of the Law.

Eve, when she was alone: Hence, Eccl. 4.10. Woe to him that is alone: then
Satan usually tempts him to despair, and self-murder.









Quest. What is the special distress arising from the Divine Tentation?

Answ. Its a combat with God himself immediately: when the conscience speaks
some fearful things of God; and withal the party distressed feels some evident
tokens of Gods wrath. As we see in the example of Job, chapter 6.4. and 13.26. and
16.9. so in David, Psalm. 6.1, etc. and 77.

Quest. What may be the occasion of this kind of tentation?

Answ. Usually it follows upon the committing of some notorious sin, which
wounds the conscience, as it did in Caine, Saul, and Judas. Sometimes it comes
when there is no such sin committed; as in Job, and then there can no reason
be rendered for it but the divine will and pleasure of God.

Quest. What are the effects of this tentation?

Answ. They are many, and strange: For sometimes it works a strange change in
the body: inflames the blood, drinks up the spirits, dries the bones, etc. So
Psalm. 32.4. Job 30.30. Psalm. 6.7. Job 16.8.

Quest. What remedies must be used for the comforting of such?

Answ. First, the party troubled must be brought to a personal exercise of
Faith, and Repentance in, and by himself: For which end he must narrowly
examine his heart, to find out his sin: and then he must humbly confess all
his known sins against himself, acknowledging that he has deserved death
and damnation: then he must cry earnestly to the Lord for pardon, Psalm 32.5.

Object. But what if the party be so distracted that he cannot perform any
good duty?

Answ. Let him sigh, and sob to God for mercy, and comfort: which is a work of
the Spirit, Romans 8.26.

Secondly, trial must be made whether the distressed party has any tokens in

Quest. What are they?

Answ. 1. Whether he be grieved because he cannot grieve for sin as he should.

2. Whether he has a serious desire to believe, and repent: a purpose to sin
no more, etc. then mind him of Gods promise, 2 Cor. 12.9. My grace is
sufficient for thee, etc. And teach him to submit to Gods will, as David, 2 Samuel 15.26.

Thirdly, apply to him the promises of God made to afflicted persons, as Psalm.
Mat. 15.24. Luke 4.18.

Fourthly, mind him of his life past, and of Gods merciful dealing with him,
Psalm. 77.10.

Fifthly, you must labor to remove such reasons, and doubts as the party
distressed

1. Being minded of Gods mercy, etc. they will say, that this is good indeed,
but it belongs not to them, for they neither do, nor can feel any thing but the
tokens of Gods wrath, etc,

To answer this, inform them of the manner of Gods dealing in all his works,
which is to work by contraries: By death he gives life, and sends men to heaven
by the gates of hell: He shows his greatest power in our greatest weakness.
So, 1 Samuel 2.6. Job 5.18.

2. They use to say, that if they could feel any comfort at all, they would
quiet their minds, and yield to good counsel and persuasions.

To this the answer is, that in such cases we must live by faith, not by
feeling, Hab. 2.4. when we have neither sight, nor sense, nor raste of Gods
mercy, and apprehend nothing but wrath, we must then labor to lay hold of the
promise of mercy. So did David, Psalm. 130.1. and Abraham, Romans 4.18. Job,
Though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee: and the thief on the Cross.

3. They plead that their case is desperate; and that never was any in their
case. But this is false. Job was in as bad a case, and David, Psalm 6. and 77.
and Christ himself on the Cross cried out, My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me.

Quest. How may trouble of mind arising from outward afflictions be remedied?

Answ. Two things are to be required of the party distressed. 1. Practice. 2.
Meditation.

First, practice is a diligent examination of his conscience to find out his
sin. Manasses, 2 Chronicles. 33.11, etc. and this is required, Lam. 3.40.

Secondly, meditation of the comfortable promises recorded in the Word of

1. That all afflictions, from the least to the greatest, come not by accident,
or chance, but by the special providence of God. For, 1. God has
fore-appointed them, Romans 8.29. we must be conformed to his Son in sufferings.
2. God does not only barely permit afflictions, but effects them, as they are
corrections, trials, and punishments, Isa. 45.7. Amos 3.6. 3. God orders and
disposes them, limitting and appointing the beginning, continuance, measure
and end of them: Yea, he orders them to his own glory, the good of his
servants, and benefit of his Church: Hence he is said to correct in judgment,
Jer. 30.11. So, Genesis 50.19, 20. 2 Samuel 16.10. Psalm. 39.9.


Obj. We could bear afflictions from God, but ours comes from men that hate us.

Answ. God uses them as his instruments to execute his will upon us: therefore
we should submit: So did Joseph, Genesis 45.5. and 50.20.

2. Tell them of Gods command touching the Cross, and the obedience we owe to
him therein, Luke 9.23. we must take up our cross daily, and follow Christ:
Hence, Micah 7.9. 1 Pet. 5.5, 6. and this being Gods command, we must be as
careful to obey him in it, as in any other moral Commandment.

3. God will be present with his servants in afflictions, Psalm. 19.15. and 23.4.

Quest. But how is God with us in afflictions?

Answ. 1. To work our deliverance from them, Psalm. 50.15. yet with this
limitation, so far forth as its good for us. 2. To temper, and moderate our
afflictions, so as we may be able to bear them, 1 Cor. 10.13. Hab. 3.2. 3. Or
if he do continue them, yet he will comfort us in them, Phil. 1.29. 4. To do us
good by them, Rev. 8.28.
Quest. What are the fruits and benefits of afflictions?

Ans. 1. They make us see and consider our sins, Genesis 42.21. So in Manasses. 2.
They serve to humble us before God. So, Luke 15.17, etc. Psalm. 30.6, 7, 8. 3.
They serve to work amendment of life, H^b. 12.11. 1 Corinthians. 11.31. Psalm.
119.67, 71. 4. They cause us to deny our selves, and to rest wholly on the
mercy of God, 2 Corinthians. 1.9. 5. They make us cry heartily, and fervently unto
God, Psalm. 78.34. Hos. 5.15. 6. They bring forth patience, etc. Romans 5.3. 7.
They work us to obedience. So in Christ, Heb. 5.8.
Quest. How are afflictions good in regard of their quality?

Answ. As they are pledges and tokens of our adoption, when we make a good use
of them, Heb. 12.7.
4. The last ground of comfort is, that whatever our distress be, we have
partners with us in the Cross. For we have Christ our partner: this was Paul's
comfort, Phil. 3.10. So 1 Pet. 4.13. Yea, Christ accounts them as his own, Acts
9.4. 1 Pet. 4.12. And our brethren suffer the like, 1 Pet. 5.9.

Quest. But how may a distressed soul be supported when God deferres
deliverance?

Answ. First, Consider that God in his wisdom has set down a time for every
thing, Eccl. 3.1. So God appointed a time for drowning the world, Genesis 6.3. and
for the Babylonish captivity, Jer. 25.11. and for Isreal's being in Egypt, Genesis
15.13. This teaches Gods children sundry lessons.

1. To wait Gods leisure with patience: though deliverance comes not in their
time, when they would have it, yet it shall come in Gods time when he has
appointed it, Psalm. 30.5. Hab. 2.3.

2. Not only to believe the promises in general, and Gods faithfulness to
fulfill them: but we must believe them in particular, i. e. with application to
their proper and several circumstances, as the particular time, means, and
places wherein* and whereby God will make them good to us. This made Daniel so
to pray, when he knew the seventy years were expired, Dan. 9.1, etc.

Secondly, when God defers deliverances, he does it upon weighty causes, best

1. The more deeply to humble us, and bring us to self denial, and teach us
patience.

2. To teach us to acknowledge whence our deliverance comes: and accordingly to
value and prize it. For benefits easily gotten are lightly regarded, and soon
forgotten.

3. To weane us from the world, and to draw us to meditations of the life to
come, where all tears shall be wiped from our eyes, Rev. 21.4.

4. To prevent greater evils which we would run into, if we had our hearts
desire. So Exodus 23.29. Deuteronomy. 7.22.

Thirdly, remember that God exercises his best servants with long continued
Abraham long childlesse; and Zachary, and Elizabeth, and David without the
Kingdom; and so David complains, Psalm. 119.82, 123.

Quest. But what if we find no end of our afflictions but that they continue
unto death?

Answ. First, we must then even until death continue to live by faith.

Secondly, in the mean time relieve thy soul with these meditations.

1. Its Gods pleasure that we should through manifold afflictions enter into
heaven, Act. 14.22. therefore murmur not at thy Fathers dispensations, Prove.
3.11.

2. Though thy afflictions be long, and tedious, yet God will at length give a
joyful issue. For so he has promised, Matthew. 5.4. Psalm. 34.19. and 37.37.

3. Our longest afflictions are not comparable to the eternal joys which God
has prepared for them that love him, 2 Cor. 4.17. Romans 8.18. Hence, 1 Pet.
1.6. For, Heb. 10.37.

4. Though God grant not deliverance sooner, yet his love is unchangeable, and
the Cross cannot separate us from it, Romans 8.35.

Quest. But how shall we be able to endure, with comfort, the pangs of Death?

Answ. Hereunto two things are required. 1. A preparation to Death. 2. Helps in
the time of death.

Quest. How shall we prepare our selves for death?

Answ. First, pray often with David, Psalm. 39.4. Lord make me know mine end, etc.
and with Moses, Psalm 90.12. Lord, teach me to number my days, etc.

Secondly, endeavor daily to disarme and weaken death; as the Philistines
dealt with Sampsom: and this we must do by weakening sin, which is the sting
of death, 1 Cor. 15.56.

Thirdly, endeavor to have some true taste of the joys of Heaven aforehand.

Quest. But how may we attain hereunto?

Answ. First by a serious consideration of the evils that hinder our
happiness,

1. The misery of our lives by reason of sin, and the consequences thereof.
For none is free from sin, Prove. 20.9. Romans 7.14.23, etc. 2. The vanity of all
things that are in the world, which therefore can never give full content,
Eccles. 1.1. 3. The mutable condition of our lives in this world: being but
strangers here, 1 Pet. 2.11. Heb. 13.14. 4. Whilst we are here, we are
separated from our head which is in Heaven, and from the happy fellowship we
shall enjoy with him there, 2 Cor. 5.6. Hence, Phil. 1.23.
Joh. 3.2. Rev. 22.4. Matthew. 25.34.

Cor. 7.31. Phil. 3.20. and 1.23.

Quest. How may we discern whether this joy of the Spirit be truly in us or no?

Answ. There are sundry properties wherein it differs from carnal joy: as

1. This joy succeeds sorrow for sin, Joh. 16.20. Matthew. 5.4. whereas carnal
joy springs from carnal delights and objects, Prove. 14.13. It ends in mourning,
Luke 6.25.

2. Its a fruit of righteousness: It issues from Christ known, and believed to
be made unto us of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption:
whence flows peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, Romans 14.17. But
carnal joy arises from the sudden feeling of some wordly delight.

3. Its founded in the holy use of the Word Sacraments, and Prayer; and in the
practice of love, mercy, justice, etc. the other is from no such thing, Job
21.13, 14, 15.

4. Its so fixed, and rooted in the hearts that it cannot be removed from
thence, Joh. 16.22. whence its able to swallow up all grief, and heaviness:
whereas the others is mingled with bitterness, Prove. 14.13.

5. Its eternal, not only continuing in this life, but in that to come, whereas
the joy of the wicked is short, etc. Job 20.5. So in these examples, Luke
12.20. and 16.22.

Quest. What are the helps that are to be used in the time of death?

Answ. They may be reduced to two heads; Meditations, and Practices.

Quest. What meditations are we to use?

Answ. First, Consider death in a double respect: 1. As it is in its self, and
so its a curse, and the forerunner of condemnaton. 2. As its qualified by the
death of Christ, and so its a blessing, and the end of all our miseries, a
short passage to joy, etc. and the grave a perfumed bed, etc.

Joh. 17.3. The second in death, which frees us from all sin, and misery;
preparing the body for eternal happiness with the soul which is already in
heaven. The third is, when both soul and body being reunited, go into
everlasting glory.



Quest. What are the helps in practice?

Answ. First, if thou will comfortably bea^ the pangs of death, thou must
labor to dye in the Faith: which is done by laying hold of the promise of God,
touching forgiveness of sin, and life everlasting by Christ, Heb. 11.13. Genesis
49.18. Joh. 3.14, 15. 2 Cor. 1.9.

i. e. willingly, and readily without murmuring, submit to the will of God, in
bearing the pains of death. So did Christ, Not my will, but thy will be done.
So we are taught to pray. Thy will be done, etc. For which end we must learn to
submit patiently to all lesser afflictions.

Quest. How shall we be enabled to bear with comfort satanical molestations
either when we are possessed by the Devil, or fear to be so, or have our houses
molested by the Devil?

Answer First, Herein consider, that possession is known by two

1. When the Devil is evidently present, either in the whole body, or in some
part of it.

2. When he has rule in the said body, either in whole or in part, so that the
party himself has not that use of his body which he would. So was it with
them which were possessed in Christ's time.

Secondly, it falls out often that strange diseases fall upon men arising from
corrupt

1. Remember that though Satan's malice, and power be very great, yet he cannot
exercise it upon Gods children, when, where, and how he pleases, for God has
limited his power, and sets his bounds that he cannot pass. The reasons whereof
are 1. Because he is a creature, and therefore finite; and can neither know nor
do any thing beyond the reach, or capacity of his nature, or above the power
and skill of a creature, 1 Cor. 2.11. Neither can he work a miracle, which is
peculiar only unto God, Psalm. 77.14. 2. Because he is subject to the will of
God: He could not go out to deceive Ahabs Prophets, till God gave him leave, 1
King. 22.22. So Job 1.12. Hence we may have comfort in that God will not give
him leave to do any thing against his children to their destruction: but so far
as shall make for their salvation.


2. Such persons must have recourse to God by prayer, and to his word wherein
he promises his presence and protection to his children in their greatest
dangers, Psalm. 91.10, 11. Zach. 2.5. Isa. 66.12. Numb. 23.22. Yet this freedom,
being but a temporal blessing, God is not so tied by his promise, but that it
may sometimes come to pass that they shall be so molested: yet this is our
comfort, that if it be so, yet it shall turn to our good.

3. Remember that the best servants of God have been molested by the Devil:
yea, Christ himself, Matthew. 4.5. So Jobs children were slain by him; and so
Mat. 15.21, 22. Luke 13.16.

4. We must in such cases seek unto God by prayer for deliverance if it stand
with his good will and pleasure, or else for patience, that we may quietly
bear that particular affliction.

Quest. What must we do in case our houses are molested with evil spirits?

Answ. First, we must not abide there where it is certainly known that God has
given the Devil power, least we tempt the Lord, Christ did not of his own
private Matthew. 4.1. Paul went not of his own head to Jerusalem, but upon the
motion of the Spirit, Acts 20.22. whence it follows that we may not cast our
selves into places of apparent danger, much less into those places which God
has given up into the power of Satan.

Secondly, That which we are to do in the use of meats, and drinks, must be
done in the houses and places where we dwell: we must sanctify them to our use

Quest. What must we do when we ar^ troubled with blasphemous thoughts against
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: as that God is not just* (...) merciful:
or that he regards men's persons: or knows not what is done here below, or at
least, does not regard them: that he cannot do this, or that, etc?

Answ. Consider whence these thoughts come: As sometimes from Satan, who casts
them into our heads* Sometimes from an evil custom, when men wi^lingly hearken
to lewd, and cursed speeches which immediately tend to the dishonor of God, or
to the wilful abuse of his Word, Judgments, or Mercies, and upon hearing,
approve of them, or at least, seek not to hinder them so much as in them lies.
Sometimes they creep into men's hearts by degrees, when they wax cold in Gods
service and make little conscience of those duties which immediately concern
Gods glory, or that accustom themselves too often, to causeless swearing,
forswearing, cursing. etc.

Now the danger of it is very great, what cause soever it proceeds from,
especially in those that look toward Heaven, and apply their hearts to serve
God, and fear his name. For it often brings forth desperation, and manifold
horrors, and troubles of mind; so that often they are tempted to make away
themselves, judging themselves to be firebrands of Hell.

Quest. What course is to be taken for the curing of this grievous malady?

Answ. First, Enquiry must be made into the next causes of this Tentation: As



Quest. How shall we know from whether of these two they arise?

Answ. First, by the entrance of them into the mind: For those which come from
the Devil, come speedily, like lightning, and after a sort are forced in, so
that we cannot avoid them, and they come so often, that they weaken the memory,
dull the senses, and weary, and confound the brain.



Thirdly, At the first conceiving such thoughts, the party is smitten with





Quest. After such enquiries made, to find out the cause, what remedies must
be applied?

Answ. First, such must be informed that these thoughts coming from the Devil
are not thy sins, but thy crosses: For they are the Devils sins, who shall
answer for them, but not ours, except we approve, and give consent to them.
Satan cast such thoughts into Christ himself, when he tempted him to
infidelity, covetousness, and idolatry: yet was Christ free from sin, because
his holy heart consented not to, but abhorred, and repelled them. Again, we
must let such thoughts go as they come, diverting our minds another way: for
the more we strive against them, the more we shall be entangled with them.

through Gods mercy, they are pardonable, if we unfeignedly repent of them.

Thirdly, Such persons must not be alone: For this Tentation is begun,
confirmed, Eve was tempted when she was alone, therefore such persons should
converse with good company: and exercise their minds with reading Gods Word,
heavenly meditations, singing of Psalms, etc.

Fourthly, Such must as heartily repent of these evil thoughts, as of evil
words, Prove. 4.23.

Quest. How may distress of mind arising from our own sins be cured?

Answ. First, That particular sin must be known, which is the cause of this
distress,

Secondly, their Sin being known, see what signs thou can find in them of
true

Thirdly, If this be found, then administer comfort, yet mixed with some
terrors

1. Inform the party that his sins are pardonable, though in themselves great,
and heinous, yet by the mercy of God in Christ, they may be remitted, and this
he may be convinced of.

1. Because Gods mercy is infinite, and over all his works, Psalm. 145.9.
Christ's death is of an infinite value. God delights in mercy, Isa. 55.7. Psalm.
103.7. as we see in Manasses, Mary Magdalen, Paul, etc. 2. Because men living
in the Church, and knowing the Doctrine of salvation shall not be condemned
simply for their sins, but for their impenitency: therefore men should be
grieved, not so much for their committing of sin, as for continuing therein
without repentance. 3. Because it pleases God many times to leave men to
themselves to commit some sin that greatly wounds conscience: yet even these
do not utterly take away grace, but afterward makes it show it self, and shine
more. For Romans 5.20. where sin abounded, grace abounds much more. 4. The
promises of God, touching pardon of sin, and life eternal, in respect of
believers are general, and in regard of all, and every man, indefinite, so that
they exclude not any: only they admit one exception, of final impenitency.
2. Show him that his sins are pardoned, if he be heartily grieved that by his
sins he has offended so loving, and merciful a God. And if he desire with all
his heart to be reconciled to God in Christ, and resolve against sin for the
time to come, Luke 15.11, etc. Show him these Texts, Matthew. 9.12, 13. and
11.28. Luke 4.18.

Quest. But what say you to the case of Recidivation, if a man after repentance
for some grievous sin, fall into it again?

Answ. His case is dangerous (as relapses into mortal diseases) yet not
altogether desperate; For

1. We that have but a drop of mercy, must forgive our brethren, again and
again, much more will God, who has an Ocean of mercy, Isa. 1.18. Apostates are
called to repentance with promise of pardon, Luke 15.20. the prodigal (by whom
is meant a child of God, who fell after repentance, and obedience) upon his
purpose to return, was pardoned. So 2 Cor. 5.20. Paul prays the lapsed
Corinthians to be reconciled to God.

2. Assure such that upon their repentance, they shall be pardoned.

Quest. But I am troubled for want of grace in my heart, and obedience in my
life, what must I do?

Answ. This is common to all Gods Children, more, or less, at one time or
other: So was Paul troubled, Romans 7.23. Now there are many grounds of comfort
whereby the heart may be stayed in this sorrow, that it be not immoderate:
which are



1. Because God gives grace according to the measure and manner of our
receiving of it, which in this life is imperfect Indeed remission of sins, and
justification by Christ's obedience are ours by imputation, and so are perfect;
but sanctification, regeneration, the love of God and man are put into us. Yet
before we have them, we must receive them, and the means whereby we receive
them is faith, which because it is weak, and imperfect in this life, therefore
the gifts which we receive thereby are imperfect also.

2. If any were absolutely perfect in this life, then he should fulfill the
Moral Law, and so be a Savior unto himself, and by the tenor of the Law have
life, and so Christ should not be a Savior properly, but only as an instrument
to dispose us to the keeping of the Law, whereby we might save our selves: But
Christ is the only Allsufficient Savior, and the accomplishment of our
salvation is from him alone.

3. Its Gods will that his children should be brought to nothing in themselves,
that they might be all in all out of themselves in Christ: But if our
sanctification were perfect here, we should rest contented in our own goodness:
that Paul might not do so, he was buffeted, 2 Cor. 12.7.

Secondly, Consider what makes thee accepted with God, and how much thy self
must do for this end: which is

1. Thou must heartily bewail thy sins both of heart and life, and if thou
renewest thy sins, thou must by renewing thy repentance recover thy former
estate.

2. In regard of thy former sins, thou must rest on Gods mercy alone, flying to
the throne of grace to obtain pardon of them.

3. Thou must endeavor for the future to perform obedience to God in all his
commandments, that thereby we may show our gratitude to him for his mercy, and
profit in our obedience.

Object. I endeavor to do these things: But alas! in sorrow for sin I am
troubled with hardness of heart: my faith is mixed with doubtings, and my
obedience with many slips, and falls: what shall I therefore do?

Answ. Remember these rules.

1. If thou have a mind and purpose not to sin, and a desire to please God,
and endeavourest to perform both; God in mercy accepts this for obedience it
self: Accipit suum, and remittit tuum. He accepts that which is his,, and
forgives that which is thine. His is the grace which puts us upon these
desires, and endeavors: Ours are the wants and weakness in performance: the
first he accepts, the latter he forgives.

Quest. But can God accept our works which are imperfect?

Answ. As our obedience is in truth, so far its his work, and therefore he
accepts it; as its ours so he pardons it, because we are in Christ.

Secondly, can thou say with Paul, Romans 7.19. The good which I would do, I
do not, and the evil which I would not, that do I? Do thou desire, and
endeavor to do good, and to eschew evil? then thou art regenerate.

Thirdly, Remember that this is thy privilege, that the corruption of thy
nature Romans 7.17. Its no more I (says Paul) but sin that dwells in me.

Quest. How does the body cause trouble of mind?

Answ. Two ways, either by melancholy, or by some strange altera^ion in the
parts of the body.

Quest. What is melancholy?

Answ. Its a kind of earthy and black blood, especially in the spleen
corrupted, and distempered, which, the speen being obstructed, conveies it self
to the heart, and brain, and there partly by its corrupt substance, and
contagious quality, and partly by corrupt spirits, annoies both heart and
brain, being the seats, and instruments of reason, and affections.

Quest. What are the effects of melancholy?

Answ. They are strange and often fearful: Its called the Devils bait, because
the Devil being well acquainted with our complexions, by Gods just permission,
conveies himself into this humor, and works strange conceits: and the
effects of it are

1. In the brain: For this humor being corrupted sends up noisome fumes which
corrupt the imagination, and make the instrument of reason unfit for
understanding, and sense. Hence follow strange imaginations, and conceits in
the mind.

2. Upon the heart; For there is a concord between the heart and the brain, the
thoughts, and affections; Now therefore when the mind has conceived fearful
thoughts, the affection is answerably moved, whence come exceeding horrors,
fear, and despair, and yet the conscience is not troubled at all.

Quest. What difference is there between Melancholy, and trouble of Conscience?

Answ. They are thus distinguished.

1. In trouble of Conscience, the affliction is in the Conscience, and so in
the whole man: But in Melancholy, the imagination is that that is disturbed.

2. Aff^iction of Conscience has a true, and certain cause which occasioneth
it, viz. the sight of sin, and sense of Gods wrath: But in Melancholy, the
imagination conceives a thing to be so which is not, making a man fear, and
despair upon supposed, and feigned causes.

3. A man afflicted in conscience has courage in other things: but a
melancholy man fears every thing, even where no cause of fear is.

4. Melancholy may be cured by Physic: but affliction of conscience cannot be
cured by any thing but the blood of Christ, and assurance of Gods favor.

Quest. How is a man that is troubled by Melancholy, to be cured of his
distress?

Answ. First, He must be persuaded to be advised, and ruled by the judgment

Secondly, You must search whether he has any beginnings of grace: If not,

Thirdly, When some measure of Faith, and Repentance are wrought in him, then
promises of mercy are to be applied to him, which he must be persuaded to Psalm.
34.9. and 91.10. Jam. 4.8.

Fourthly, Use Physic which may correct, and abate the humor, it being a

Quest. How do strange alterations in the parts of the body cause distress of
mind?

Answ. Diverse ways; sometimes by Frenzy in the brain: others sometimes by
trembling of the heart, or swelling of the Spleen, or a rising of the
intrailes, all which cause strange imaginations, fears, etc.

Quest. What remedies are to be used in these cases?

Answ. First, In this case also, consideration is to be had whether the party

CHAP. XXXV. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Self-Commendation.
Quest. IS it lawful for a man to commend himself?

Answ. It is lawful in some cases for a child of God to commend himself: to
declare what God has done for him or by him to speak of the graces God has
bestowed on him, of his labors, of works which God has wrought by him, yea,
and of his sufferings for God; as will appear by these examples: Of Nehemiah,
chap. 13.1. to 14, etc. Of Job, chap. 29. and 31. of Paul, Act. 20. Phil. 3. 1
These. 2. 2 Cor. 11. and 12.

Quest. In what cases is this self-commendation allowed?

Answ. First, of afflictions from God; wherein they have professed their faith
Job. chapter 13.14, 15. and 23.10, 11, 12. and the Church, Psalm. 44.17, etc. and
Jeremy, chapter 17.16, 17.

Secondly, of injuries from men in word or deed.

1. In word, by scoffs, and reproaches, as David, 2 Samuel 6.20, 21. By slanders
of their good conversations: So did Paul, Act. 22.1, etc. and 23.1. and 24.5,
6. and 26.2, etc. So Jacob, Genesis 31.36, to 42. yea, Christ himself, Joh. 8.46,
48, 49.

2. In deed: then we may protest our innocence to prove we suffer wrongfully;
as Daniel did, Dan. 6.22, Christ, Joh. 10.31, 32. and 8.40.

Thirdly, when thereby we may show forth the infinite riches of Gods free Paul,
1 Cor. 15.9, 10. 1 Timothy 1.13, 15, 16.

Fourthly, to give others occasion, and to provoke them.

1. To pray for us. So Paul, Heb. 13.18.

2. To praise God for us, and glorify him in our behalf. So Paul, 2 Cor. 1.11,
12. Gal. 1.24. Ephesians. 1.15, 16.

3. To glory on our behalf before others, especially those that seek to
traduce, and slander us. So Paul, 2 Cor. 5.11, 12. 2 These. 1.4.

Fifthly, when others require an account of our faith, holiness, obedience, or
Pet. 3.15.

Sixthly, when we would propound our selves as examples to others of faith,
etc. to draw others to follow our steps: so David, Psalm. 66.1^. Paul, Phil.
3.17. Christ, Mat. 11.29.

Paul, 2 Cor. 12.11.

Paul, 2 Cor. 5.11. that we may make it appear that we seek not theirs but
them, 1 These. 2.4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 10.33. Thus we may commend our selves.

1. To uphold the credit of our calling, as Paul did of his Ministry.

2. To further the success of our labors: So Paul also.

3. To promote the efficacy of the counsel, or charge we give to others, and
make it more prevalent. So Paul, 2 Timothy 1.8.

4. To manifest our love to others by opening our hearts to them, to let them
look in and see the treasures of grace, comforts, and experiences which God
has laid up in them: Also to gain their love to us, to insinuate into their
bosoms, and so be a means of doing them the more good: So did Paul, 2 Cor.
7.2. We may also commend our selves in some things, to approve our sincerity in
other things: So David, Psalm. 18.23. and 119.98, 100. and Nehemiah, chapter 5.15.

Paul even to magnify his office, etc. Romans 11.13.

Samuel, 1 Samuel 12.2, 3, 4. So Paul, Act. 20.25.



1. Either against God by declaring to them that they see no such evil in us,
but the contrary graces and practices; that we dare not say, or do, as they do
for a world, thereby to draw them to repentance.

2. Or against our selves, when they reject or abuse us, by appealing to their
consciences what iniquity they have found in us to deserve the same at their
hands.

Object. But is not this condemned? Prove. 27.2. 2 Cor. 10.18. was it not Simon
Magus his sin? Act. 8.9. and that Pharisee's, Luke 18.11. So Prove. 20.6.

Answ. Self-commendation which proceeds from pride, and hypocrisy, or from
distrust of providence, as if God would not take care of our good names, etc.
is vain, and sinful. Laus proprio sordescit in ore: and hereby such do others a
treble wrong.

1. They take other men's office out of their hands; or take that to our selves
which is another right to give us.

2. They give to others a bad example, who will learn to imitate them.

3. Its tedious to an ingenuous spirit to hear others to boast of themselves:
Yet

The abuse of a thing takes not away the lawfulness and use of it.

Quest. How then shall we know when self-commendation is lawful?

Answ. First, by the matter, when the thing for which we commend our selves is,

1. Good in it self, and praise worthy: For if it be evil, we glory in our
shame: Again, it must not be for our temporals, as Riches, honors, etc. But
for spirituals, as the righteousness of Christ, the grace, love, and favor of
God: the work or service of God, or for doing, or suffering for God: So, Jer.
9.23. so in Paul, Phil. 3.4, 5, 6. 2 Cor. 11.21, 22, 23. Romans 15.17. Phil. 4.8.
1 Cor. 4.9. to 14. 2 Cor. 6.4, 5, 8, 9, 10.

2. When for the matter we speak only of such things as are really ours, or
that we have in truth, and do in deed, so that for the truth of our words we
can appeal to the testimony of Gods Spirit, and our own consciences: as Paul,
Romans 9.1, 2, 3. 1 These. 2.10, 11. 2 Cor. 12.6.

Secondly, By the measure, when it is our care, and fear not to overreach
herein, Cor. 10.13, etc. Romans 15.18.

Thirdly, by the manner, and that in a threefold respect.

1. Of our selves, when we commend our selves forcedly, humbly, and modestly.

1. Forcedly, not forwardly: when we are necessitated, or strongly moved
thereto; as Paul, 2 Cor. 12.11. and v. 1. 2. Humbly, out of the sense of our
own infirmities and unworthiness, notwithstanding all the good we have or do;
and out of fear lest others should think better of us then we are, or deserve:
So with Paul, 2 Cor. 12.6. For Gods humble servants take notice of the evil as
well as of the good that is in them; as Isa. 59.2. Job 40.4. and 42.5, 6. 1
Cor. 15.8, 9. Ephesians. 3.8. 1 Timothy 1.13, 14, 15. 3. Modestly, when we speak of
our graces, and performances soberly, not in a boasting way, as Nebuchadnezzar
did, Dan. 4.30. How modest was Paul in speaking of matters that concerned his
own praise? 2 Cor. 11.5, 24, to 29. Heb. 13.18.
2. Of God, when we speak of the good we have, or do thankfully, and that 1.
With a free acknowledgement of God as the sole author of all, from whom we
have received all we have, 1 Cor. 4.7. Phil. 4.13. Isa. 26.12. 2. Out of a
sense of Gods goodness to us therein, with high and honorable thoughts of
God, and fear of his name, and with an heart inflamed with love to God and joy
in him.


3. Of others, when we commend our selves charitably, and tenderly, not to
despise, disgrace, or discourage others who are weak: as the proud Pharisee
insulted over the Publican, whom God justified, when he condemned the other.

Fourthly, by the end: Self-commendation is lawful when the end is good,

1. In respect of our selves to do our selves right, and to preserve our good
Luke 17.10. When you have done all that you can, say we are unprofitable
servants, etc. Hence Paul ascribes all to Gods grace, 1 Cor. 15.10. and see
what Christ says, John 5.44. Hence Paul, 1 These. 2.6.

2. In respect of God; when, whatever we speak of our selves that is good, we
do it that God may be glorified in us, and by us, and for us, and we give God
the praise of all our praises: Yea, if God may be glorified, and his name
exalted, we can be content to be abased, and to have our honors laid in the
dust. So John the Bap. Joh. 3.29, 30. So, 1 Cor. 1.31.

Mr. Reyners Rules for the Government of the tongue.

To these foregoing, add one rule more.

That when a man is urged to a necessary self-commendation, and is forced by
the importunity of others to vindicate himself; yet to qualify his speech as
much as may be, its good to use a word of the plural number; as Paul does, 2
Cor. 5.20. We the Ambassadors, etc. where he distributes the honor to many,
that he may not seem to attribute too much to himself, and so that plural
number is a phrase of singular humility. Dr. Stoughton.

CHAP. XXXVI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about our communion with God.
Quest. What is it to be in communion with God?

Answ. When we are made one with him, or united to him, as a child to his
Father, 1 John 1.3. So that our communion with God, is 1. To see him in his
works. 2. To hear him in his Word. 3. To speak to him by prayer, and praise. 4.
To walk with him in meditation of his presence.


Quest. What are the evidences, or signs of our communion with God, and with
Jesus Christ?

Answ. First, The holy spirit of God, and of Jesus Christ given to us, 1 John
Hereby we know that he abides in us, by his Spirit which he has given us. So
1 John 4.13.

Quest. How do we know this our communion with God, by his Spirit given us?

Answ. First, As the inward, immediate, efficient cause of this divine
communion Ephesians. 2.22. 2. Christ supplies his absence from his Church by his
Spirit, Joh. 14.15, 17, 25, 26. and 16.17, 18.

Secondly, As an Anointing, teaching us all things, 1 John 2.27. Revealing to
us the things that are given us of God, 1 Cor. 2.12. and illuminating us with
Joh. 14.21, 22, 23.

Thirdly, As a witness with our spirits, Romans 8.15, 16.

Fourthly, As a seal upon our hearts, Ephesians. 1.13.

Fifthly, As the earnest, and first fruits of our adoption, and endless
communion with God in glory, Ephesians. 1.14. Romans 8.23.

Sixthly, As the original cause, and root of all these spiritual fruits, which
are only found in them that have communion with God, Gal. 5.22, 23.

Quest. But by what signs may we know that the Spirit of God is given us?

Answ. If the Spirit of God be given us, then

1. We are, or have been effectually convinced by the spirit of our own
natural misery, and of Christ's supernatural alsufficiency to remove it, Joh.
16.7. to 12.

2. We are washed, and sanctified by the Spirit, 1 Cor. 6.11. mortifying the
old man, and quickening the new man in us, Romans 8.13, 11.

3. We are acted, guided, and led by the Spirit of God, Romans 8.14.

4. We mind the things of the Spirit, Romans 8.5. our thoughts, projects,
contrivements, etc. do habitually fix here.

5. We bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, which spirit cannot bring forth
bad fruit, not be barren, Ephesians. 5.9. Gal. 5.22, 23.

6. We combat by the Spirit against the flesh, Gal. 5.17.

7. We are strengthened to every good word and work, with might in the inward
man by the Spirit, Ephesians. 3.16. Col. 1.10, 11. and particularly by the spirit
we are notably enabled unto prayer against all our infirmities, Romans 8.15, 26,
27.

Secondly, The true abiding of the ancient, Primitive truth, and Doctrine of
Ioh. 2.22, 23, 24. All novelties in Doctrine are to be censured by Primitive
truths, and brought to the ancient standard for their regulation.

Quest. How shall we know that we sincerely abide in the truth?

Answ. First, if we have a cordial love to the truth, 2 These. 2.10. Contrary in
those, 2 Timothy 4.3, 4.

Secondly, A conscientious care to do nothing against the truth, but any Cor.
13.8. 2 Ioh. 10.11.

Thirdly, an earnest contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints,
Jude

Fourthly, A bearing witness to the truth, both verbally, and really in the
worst Paul, Phil. 1.17. and so Rev. 2.13. yea, Christ himself bore witness to
the truth even unto death, Ioh. 18.37.

Ioh. 4.15.

Object. But how can this be? did not the Devil confess Christ to be the Son of
God? Mar. 1.24. Luke 4.34, 41. and Hypocrites? Mat. 7.22.23.

Answ. There is a double confessing that Jesus is the son of God.

1. Dogmaticall, arising merely from the assenting act of Faith that believes
the truth of Gods word, touching Jesus Christ. So Devils, and Hypocrites may
confess Christ, Tit. 1.16. and in opinion they know him, Luke 4.41. this may be
without any communion with God and Christ.

2. Fiduciall, arising not only from the assenting, but also from the applying
act of Faith, when we confess Christ with confidence, and trust in him for
salvation: This is here meant.

Quest. How shall we know when we fiducially confess Jesus Christ?

Answ. 1. If we assent to the truth of Gods record touching Christ, 1 Ioh.
5.10, 11. 2. If we appy Christ to our selves, resting and living upon him
according to that record, Ioh. 1.11, 12. Gal. 2.20. 3. If we confess Christ
thus applied, not only in words, but in deeds also, Tit. 1.16. Mat. 7.21. 4. If
we confess Christ even to sufferings, and to death, Acts 20.23, 24. and 21.13.
Rev. 2.13.
Fourthly, Not doing, or practicing of sin, is a sign of our communion with
God, 2 Ioh. 3.6, 8.

Fifthly, Unfeigned love to God, and dwelling therein, is a sign of our true
Ioh. 4.16. For

1. Our true love to God denotes a reciprocation of mutual affections betwixt
God and us, 1 Ioh. 4.19.

2. It implies a reciprocation of the genuine fruits, and effects of love
mutually. God loving us, adops, redeems, calls, sanctifies, justifies, and
glorifies us: we loving God, trust in him, fear, obey him, etc. both these
import spiritual communion with God.

Quest. How may we know that we truly dwell in Gods love?

Answ. 1. When we love God with an intensive love, Luke 10.27. that is, with
all within us. 2. When we love God with a predominant love, that overcomes our
love to all other objects besides God, Psalm. 97.10. Mat. 10.37. with Luke 14
26. Rev. 21.11. 3. When we love God obedientially, so as willingly to obey all
his commands, Ioh. 14.15. 1 Ioh. 5.3. 2 Cor. 5.14. 4. When we love him
invincibly, so that our love cannot be quenched, or conquered, but we are ready
to endure any thing for his sake, Cant. 8.6, 7. Acts 20.23, 24. and 21.13. 5.
When we love him continually, Ephesians. 6.24.
Sixthly, walking in light, and not in darkness, evidenceth our communion with
God, 1 Ioh. 1.5, 6, 7.

Quest. How shall we know that we walk thus?

Answ. 1. When we are effectually translated from darkness to light, Acts
26.18. Col. 1.13. Ephesians. 5.8. 2. When we cast off the works of darkness, and
put on the armor of light, Romans 13.12. etc. when we bring forth the fruits of
light, Ephesians. 5.9. 3. when we shun all fellowship with works of darkness in
others. Ephesians. 5.11. 4. When we love the light, and come to it, that our deeds
may be manifested to be of God, Ioh. 3.20, 21.
Seventhly, Walking as Christ, or chief Captain, Heb. 2.10. walked, is another
sign of our communion with God, 1 Ioh. 2.6.

Quest. How did Christ walk, that we may know whether we walk as he walked?

Answ. 1. Christ walked holily, purely, and inoffensively toward God and man,
Heb 4.15 and 7.26. Isa. 59.9. So should we, 1 Cor. 10.32, 33. Act. 23.1. and
24.16. 1 These. 2.10, 11, 12. 2. Christ walked most humbly and meekly, Mat.
11.28. Phil. 2.5, 6, 7. 3. Most self-denyingly; though rich, he became poor for
our sakes, 2 Cor. 8.9. So Mar. 14.36. 4. Most zealously, Ioh. 2.15, 16, 17. 5.
Most obedientially to his heavenly Father, Romans 5.19. Ioh. 4.34. Heb. 5 8, 9.
Phil. 2.8. 6. Most profitably, he went about doing good, Act. 10.38. 7. Most
lovingly, tenderly, and compassionately to poor sinners to win, and save them,
Luke 4.18, 19, 20, 21. Mat. 12.19, 20. and 11.28, 29, 30. Luke 7.37. to the
end. 8. Most spiritually and Heavenly, he lived on earth, as if he had been in
heaven, extracting heavenly contemplations, and spiritual lessons from all
sorts of earthly objects, and occasions presented before him, as Ioh. 4.10,
etc. and ver. 31.32. and 6.26, 27, etc. and 15.1. etc.
Eighthly, Keeping his word, and commandments, discovers our communion with
him, 1 John 2.5. and 3.23, 24.

Quest. How shall we know whether we keep his commandments as we ought?

Answ. If we practice righteousness, 1 John 2.29. and 3.10. and that.



Luke 12.33, 34. 2 Kin. 10.30, 31. which is 1. From a pure heart: 1. Purified
by the blood of Christ for our justification, Zach. 13. 1. Psalm. 51.7. Act.
15.9. 2. By the spirit of Christ for our sanctification, 1 Cor. 6.11. Psalm.
66.18. 2. From a good conscience, purged by Christ from dead works, to serve
the living God, Heb. 9.14. and when its habitually exercised to an
inoffensiveness toward God and man, Acts 24.16. with 23.1. and when it
endeavors to be completely, and universally good, Acts 23.1. Yea, when it
approves it self good in Gods sight, 1 Pet. 3.21. and when from all this the
heart gives in a comfortable testimony of its simplicity and godly sincerity,
able to support under greatest distress, 2 Co. 1.8. etc. 3. From faith
unfeigned without which there is no pleasing of God, Heb. 11.6. Faith washes
all out duties, and acts of obedience, in the blood of Christ, and so renders
them acceptable to God, 1 Pet. 2.5.


1. Spiritually, and heartily, Prove. 23.26: Joh. 4.24. 1 Cor. 6.20. 2.
Sincerely, and uprightly, Genesis 17.1. as David, Psalm. 18.22. and 66.18. Paul, 2
Cor. 2. ult. Peter, Joh. 21.15, 16, 17. 3. Obedientially, because God commands
it, as in Noah, Heb. 11.7. Abraham, Heb. 11.8, 17, etc. David, Psalm. 40.8. and
119.143. Paul, Romans 7.22. 4. Universally, without reservations, and exceptions,
Psalm. 119.6. Numb. 14.22. Luke 1.6. 5. Constantly, Psalm. 1.2, 3. and 92.13, 14.
and 119.20.


Cor. 10.31. and our own, and others spiritual and eternal good, Mat. 5.16. 1
Pet. 4.2, 3, 4. Romans 2.7.

Joh. 4.12. and 5.1. Mr. Roberts Believers Evidences.

CHAP. XXXVII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about communicating in other
men's sins.
Quest. HOw many ways may we communicate in other men's sins?

Answ. First, by Counsel, and advise, when Sam. 16.21. Absalom committed
incest, but Achitophel counseled it, Mark 6.25. The Damsel desired John
Baptists head, but her mother advised her, v. 24.

Secondly, by command, whether by word or writing, 1 Samuel 22.18. Doeg murdered
the Priests, but Saul commanded him, Act. 23.3. the servant struck Paul, but
the High Priest commanded it: The Judges condemned Naboth, but Jesabel
commanded them by her Letters: So David by Letters killed Uriah. So, 2 Samuel
1^.28. 1 King. 12.30. and 13.34. Jer. 28.16.

Thirdly, by permission: Thus all Governors are guilty* when their inferiors,
Eli, 1 Samuel 3.13. Qui non prohibet malum cum potest, facit. He that forbids not
sin when its in his power, commits it: Pilate was guilty, because he
restrained not the Jews from putting Christ to death: So, Nehem. 13.17. Numb.
35.31.

Fourthly, by provocation. Gal. 5.26. Ahab was most wicked whom Jesabel King.
21.25.

Fifthly, by consent, and countenancing wicked actions: as Saul, Act. 8.1. by
Stevens death. So Number. 16.19.

Quest. How many ways is sin countenanced?

Answ. First, by participation in the action: as the Receiver to the Thief, the

Secondly, by silence and concealment: when a man has a calling public, Ezekiel.
3.17, 18. or when we conceal sin from such as should reform it.

Eli dear, 1 Samuel 2.29.

1. When we undertake to justify and defend it; Or, 2. To extenuate it.


Fifthly, by praising and flattering men in sin, Prove. 29.5.

Why are Superiors guilty of such sins as they permit?

Answ. First, because every man is commanded to reprove his brother, Lev.

Secondly, every man is bound to prevent sin so much as lies in him, especially



Quest. How then may such keep our selves free from other men's sins?

Answ. First, they must pry, and enquire into the lives of those that are
committed to them, that they may see what is amiss; this a private man is not
bound to, but public are, Prove. 27.23.

Abraham, Genesis 18.19. Joshuah, chap. 24.13. so its commanded. Exodus 20.10.
Masters must come with their train to the House of God, Psalm. 42.4.

Quest. What motives may provoke us to avoid communicating in other men's sins?

Answ. First, we must be responsible to God for all our own sins, and

Jacobs resolution: Into their secret let not my soul come, Genesis 49.6. so we
are exhorted, Prove. 1.10. If sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Nicodemus
stands up for Christ when all were against him, Joh. 4.51.

Psalm. 50.18. the Actors and consenters are in the same case; and its all one
whether we be defiled with our own, or others filthiness.



Fifthly, the harder this duty is, by reason of the deluge of sin, and the
scorns that Noah, Lot, etc.

Sixthly, the want of conscience in this duty sets, and continues all things
out

Dr. Tho. Tailor.

Quest. How else may we communicate in other men's sins?

Answ. According to Mr. Baines on Ephesians. it may be done eight ways.

1. By provoking to sin; as such as stir up lust, anger, pride, etc. in
others. These are worse sinners then they which commit it; as the devil
tempting our first parents, was deeper in the sin and judgment then they.
Ringleaders in sin shall be ringleaders in judgment.

2. By commanding sin: For he that commands it, is the chief offender. Thus
David murdered Uriah.

3. By counselling: As Jonadab to Ammon, 2 Samuel 13.5.

4. By consenting; as Ahab in the murder of Naboth, 1 King. 21.19. So Hosea
5.11.

5. By carelesseness to prevent sin: We must not say as Cain: Who made me my
brothers Keeper? but we must watch over, exhort, reprove, etc. For when Achan
sinned, all Israel is said to sin, Jos. 7.1. and the whole body of them was
punished.

6. By not suppressing sin: Thus Eli sinned, 1 Samuel 3.13.

7. By applauding sin: so, Romans 1.32. This strengthens the arms of the
wicked.

8. By not testifying against it, Lev. 5.1.

Quest. Are not all men guilty some way or other of the sins of the times?

Answ. Yea truly, we all receive some taint, and soil from the times we live
in, either our zeal is weakened, or we do not grieve so much for the sins of
the times as we should, This made the Corinthians guilty of the sin of the
incestuous person, 1 Cor. 5.2.

Quest. Whether is it lawful for a man to rejoice at another man's sin?

Answ, We may never rejoice at sin as it is sin: but as God turns it to an
occasion of good, so we may rejoice: as when a proud man by falling into some
shameful sin, is thereby brought to repentance, and humbled; or when by the
occasion of some soul impiety, a good Law is made against it, which otherwise
would not have been made, Phil. 1.15, 16, 17, 18.

Ames. Cas. Consci.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about the choice and use of
Company.
Quest. WHat rule are we to observe in the choice of our company?

Answ. Never cast thy self into wicked company, nor press amongst the profane,
especially upon choice, voluntarily, and delightfully: And abide no longer with
them at any time, upon any occasion, then thou have a sound warrant, and
calling thereto. Fo its uncomly, and incompatible with a good conscience: Its
not for the honor, or comfort of Gods children. to keep company, or familiarly
to converse with graceless men.

Object. But may we not make use of such company?

Answ. That we may the better understand it, we must distinguish of our
companying with them: For

1. There is a common, cold, and more general society, in trading, buying,
selling, saluting, eating, and drinking together, and in other passages of
humanity, and entercouse of civil society, to which charity, nature,
necessity, or the exigents of our callings, general, or particular, do
warrantably lead us. This may, nay must be, 1 Cor. 5.10.

2. Special, dear, intimate society, in consultations, and counsels about
matters of special secrecy, greatest weight, and highest consequence: In
spiritual refreshments, Religious conferences, prayer, marriage, etc. In a free
communication of their souls, their spiritual estate, etc. Now Gods children
are bound by the Law of God, and prudence, from conversing with delight, and
from the exchange, and exercise of those special passages of dearest
acquaintance with profane men, and enemies of God.

Quest. What reasons may be rendered for this?

Answ. First, by such society he incurs a double hazard.

1. Of being infected with sin: Can a man touch pitch, and not be defiled? or
go upon coals and not be burnt? Pro. 6.27, 28. Indeed there is a strange
attractive, 1. By familiar correspondence with such, there steals upon a man a
secret and insensible dislike of his former sober courses, as having thereby
too much abridged himself of his liberty. 2. There slily insinuates into his
heart a pleasing approbation of, and assent to the sensual courses of his lewd
companions. 3. There follows a resolved, and habitual change of his affections,
and conversation into the manners of those which he so familiarly converses
with. 4. He grows out of conceit with good men, and good exercises, because he
daily hears them railed on, jested at, and slandered: and so by degrees is
himself transformed into a scoffing Ishmael, and a breathing Devil.


Quest. But I hope we may keep company with such as are civil?

Answ. Christians which have any fear of God in their hearts, will shun the
society of such grossly profane persons, knowing that their souls are a thousand
times more capable of the contagion of sin, then their bodies of an infectious
disease, and therefore their danger is greater by conversing with merely civil
men, whose society they unadvisedly entertain for kindred, old acquaintance,
advantage, or such carnal respects, and thereby cool in their zeal, loose
their comfort, feelings of Gods favor, joyful springings of heart, boldness in
the ways of God, cheerfulness in the exercises of Religion, and that
comfortable fruition of other Christian prerogatives, which many other of their
brethren do, and themselves, by the benefit of Religious companions, and
delightful conversing with the Saints, might plentifully enjoy.

2. A Christian is every hour which he is in their company without a
warrantable calling, and just dispensation out of the Word of God, in great
danger of being involved within the flames of the just confusions, and inwrapt
within the compass of those outward curses, and plagues which Gods indignation
inflicts upon wicked men. All profane men, being unreconciled to God, are every
moment liable to all those miseries, and fearful judgments, which either man,
or Devil, any of Gods creatures, or his own immediate hand can bring upon
them, they are only respired by Gods mercy, and deferred to those
opportunities, and seasons which seem fittest to his holy wisdom. Now when at
any time they light upon them, if any of Gods Children be unwarrantably in
their company, and with delight, its righteous with God, that he receive his
portion amongst them at that time, 2 Chronicles. 20.37. Be ye not therefore
companions with them, Ephesians. 5.7.



a good name is better then great riches, Prove. 22.1. Eccle. 7.1. It makes the
bones fat, Prove. 15.30. therefore we should much prize it.



1. Because of that irreconcilable enmity, and antipathy between the seed of
the woman, and the seed of the Serpent: between light and darkness, Christ and
Belial.

2. Because every unregenerate man, though furnished with the best perfections
attainable in that state, thinks that his lukewarmnesse, and formality is
censured and condemned by that zeal, and forwardness of the true Christian,
and that if that holy strictness be necessarily required, they plainly
proclaim the damnablenesse of his state, upon which he securely reposes
himself, as sufficient to salvation. Hence they so hated David, Psalm. 69.4.
what heart then can a Christian have to converse intimately with such as hate
him for his goodnesse-sake.

Fifthly, Its absurb that a member of Christ should exercise familiarity with a

Sixthly, Conversing with such, does cross, and overthrow this common, and

Because he throws himself upon tentation, and hazards being infected either
with profaneness, or lukewarmnesse. He hurts others also, and that

1. He hardens his companions in their unregenerate courses, because they think
he would not so familiarly converse with them, except he were well conceited of
their spiritual state.

2. He is a stumbling block to the weak Christian, who by looking upon his
example may be led awry from the strait path of his profession, and by taking
thereby liberty of imitation, whereby his young beginnings of grace may be
choked, etc.

3. Hereby he grieves strong Christians, when they see him so far forg^tfull of
himself, and disgraceful to his profession as to converse with the enemies of
God.

Seventhly, when an unregenerate man sees that a Christian presses into his
company, and desires to spend time with him, he presently concludes, that sure

Eighthly, Above all for this purpose peruse often, and ponder well,

1. The prohibitions hereof in Gods book, 1 Cor. 5.11. Ephesians. 5.11. Prove. 14.7.
2 These. 3.6. Prove. 4.14.

2. The protestations, and practices of the Saints, Psalm. 26.4, 5. Jer. 15.17.
2 King 3.14.

3. The punishment inflicted for the familiarity with the ungodly, as 2 Chro.
19.2. and 20.37.

Quest. May we not converse with our unconverted kindred, friends, neighbors,
etc.

Answ. Yes, But then you must observe these rules*

First, labor for more power of grace, knowledge, sanctification, Christian

Secondly, See that thy heart be sincere, and that in the singleness thereof



Quest. What must we do when we come into Christian and good company.

Answ. Prize it as thy only Paradise, and heaven upon earth: the very flower,
and festival of all thy refreshing time in this vale of tears, and therefore
ever bring with thee.

1. A cheerful, and delightsome heart, and though thou wast formerly sad, and
overcast with clouds of heaviness, yet let the presence, and faces of those,
whom hereafter thou shall meet in heaven, and therewith incomparable joy behold
for ever, disperse, and dispell them all, and infuse comfortable beams of
heavenly, and spiritual joy.



Thirdly, An humble heart, ready, and rejoicing to exchange, and enjoy mutual
Romans 1.12. and 15.24. Mr. Boltons directions for a comfortable walking with God.

Quest. What must we do when we come into the company of the wicked?

Answ. First, thou must vindicate the power, and truth of Religion from the
mistakings of those which are ignorant, and undervaluers of it; as for example:
Thou art in company where thou hear a mea^ civil man, or formal Professor
commended for his religion, which commendation if he carry away without
contradiction, the rest of the company may be drawn to resolve not to go
beyond his pitch, seeing his estate is approved by wise and understanding men
as hopeful, and comfortable. Now in this case thou must, with as much wisdom,
and charity as thou can possibly, disrobe such a fellow of his undeserved
applause, and reputation of holiness which he never had, left the bystanders
be hardened, and the power of Christianity be disparaged.

Belial, and the sinful evaporations of wicked wits, and therefore unmeet for
the children of God.

Thirdly, pray for, and practice an holy dexterity to divert them from their
wicked, or too much worldly tal^ to more savoury conference, and heavenly

1. Observe wisely all opportunities, and occurrencies, which may minister
matter of digression into divine talk, and acquaint thy self with the Art of
abstracting holy instructions from the book of the creatures, and businesses in
kind. As was Christ practice, Matthew. 16.6, etc. John 6.26, etc. and 4.7, etc.

2. Have ever in readiness some common heads of stirring, and quickening
motives to mind heavenly things: as the cursed condition of our natural state,
the incomparable sweetness of Christian ways, the vanity and vexation of all
earthly things, the miseries of this short life, the everlastingnesse of our
state in another world, the terrors of death, the dreadfulnesse of the last
and great day, etc. which (through Gods blessing) may sometimes soften the
hardest hearts, and work in them some remorse and heavenly impressions.

3. Above all, get into thine own heart an habit of heavenly mindedness, by
much exercise, intercourse, and acquaintance with God in pouring out thy soul
ever and anon before him, and in holy meditations, and if thou be thus
blessedly busy at home with thine own heart, thou shall find thy self much
more pregnant, and plentiful in holy talk when thou come abroad. Idem.

Quest. What is meant by this that we must not familiarly converse with the
wicked?

Answ. First, Negatively: the meaning is not,

1. That we may not be in the same place with them, for then we must go out of
the world, 1 Cor. 5.10.

2. Nor that we may not do them common courtesies, as to lend to them, salute
them, Matthew. 5.47. where Christ implies that we should salute others besides
our brethren.

3. Not that we may not sometimes, upon some occasions, come into more familiar
meetings with them: as to Feasts, etc. 1 Cor. 10.27.

Secondly, Affirmatively, the meaning is,

1. That we may not upon choice, without just occasions, frequent their
company; which for their sins we should hate, Psalm. 139.21, 22.

2. That we may not delight in their society, which cannot but be a grief to a
godly heart, Psalm. 120.5. and 119.136.

3. That we may not choose them for our familiar friends.

Quest. Who are such wicked men as we may not make our companions?

Answ. First, Negatively. 1. Not such an one as is unfound at heart, but not
discovered: For one whom we may lawfully choose for our friend, may afterward

2. Nor such an one who has many weaknesses, whom we must rather restore with
the spirit of meekness, Gal. 6.1.

Secondly, Affirmatively. 1. Such as are out of the Church, as Jews, Turks,
Pagans,

2. Such as are justly excommunicated out of the Church for blasphemy, heresy,
or profannesse, 1 Cor. 5.5, 6, 7.

3. Such as, though they continue in the Church, yet by their works they show
that they are mere carnal.

Quest. But what if our near relations, ^s husband, wife, etc. are wicked?

Answ. We must distinguish of wicked persons: who are,

1. Such as are not bound to us by any special bond, and these we may not make
our companions.

2. Such to whom we are bound by consanguinity, affinity, or our civil
callings: For these we must afford them our outward presence familiarly, 1 Corinthians. 7.12, 13. Though we cannot be of one heart, and mind with them; as,
Act. 4.32.

Quest. How may it be further proved that we may not make the former our
companions?

Answ. First, because its expressly forbidden by God, Ephesians. 5.7. Prove. 1.15. and
Act. 2.40. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 These. 3.14. As under the Law the Leprous must be
separated from the clean, Lev. 13.44. with 14.8.

precious must be separated from the vile, Jer. 15.19.

Joseph in Pharaohs Court learned to swear by the life of Pharaoh. So, Prove.
13.20. and 22.24, 25. Hence is that precept, Isa. 52.11. 2 Cor. 6.17. Prove.
6.27, 28.

Luke 13.26.

2. It makes us unable effectually to rebuke them, when we are in such a league
of familiarity with them.



Quest. May we then have no dealing with him?

Answ. Yea, we may, 1. Lawfully enter into League with them not to do them
hurt, as Isaac with Abimelech: Jacob with Laban: For the rule is, Romans 12.18.

2. To trade, and maintain commerce with them, as David, and Solomon with
Hiram, and his men.

3. We may be sometimes in familiar meetings with them to seek to gain them to
God: For the sick have need of a Physician: upon this account Christ conversed
with Publicans and sinners.

Quest. Why must we be so careful to watch over our selves in company?

Answ. First, because we often take much hurt in company, and are in far worse
case by means thereof for want of good direction, and heedfulnesse, then we
were before we came into it.



Quest. Why so?

Answ. Because in company many occasions are offered, as of glorifying, so of
dishonouring God, and of troubling and grieving our selves and others. Besides,
the tongue is an unruly member, etc. Jam. 3.1, 2, etc. and as for the heart
which sets the tongue on work, it is uncharitable, suspicious, profane,
worldly, etc. Yea, a very fountain of evil thoughts, oaths, adulteries,
slanders, etc. Mat. 15.19. Hence comes so many idle and profane speeches
whereof we must give an account in the day of judgment, Mat. 12.36. and at
best, endless talking of matters that concern wordly profit, or pleasure:
This made Job so careful to sanctify his children after their love feasts,
Job 1.5.

Quest. What particular rules are to be observed concerning our carriage in
company?

Answ. First, seeing there is such danger in it, we are not to rush unadvisedly
into it, but with fear, and trembling, and upon good occasion.

good as we are able, and to help them forward to eternal life: purposing also
to get some spiritual good to our selves, as occasion shall be offered.

Thirdly, we must resolve, if we can do no other good, at least to be
harmless, Prove. 10.20. and 20.5. Col. 3.12. 1 These. 5.23. James 5.20. Jude 20.
1 Samuel 23.16.

Quest. How may we attain unto this?

Answ. First, we must pray for grace before we go into company, as Jacob Esau,
Genesis 32.11. so we must pray that we be not infected by them.

Secondly, we should think of some profitable matter beforehand, and entreat

Thirdly, we must wisely and carefully wait for, and lay hold on the fittest
occasions

Fourthly, we must resolve not to thwart or cross others, but in the spirit of
Gal. 6.1, 2. Col. 3.12. and for that end to put on love, which envies not,
boasts not, rejoices not in iniquity, provokes not, nor is easily provoked
unto anger: but suffers long, hops all things, etc. 1 Cor. 13.4, etc. Prove.
10.12. 1 Pet. 4.8.

Quest. How shall we be furnished with matter to edify one another?

Answ. If no present occasion be offered, as was to Christ, Luke 11.27, 28. we
must have consideration, both of the things and of the persons. The things we
are to think of are either some part of Gods word which we have lately heard
preached of, or that we have read, or meditated upon, or some work of God
lately fallen out, wherein yet we must avoid the common abuse, which is either
to turn it over as table-talk, or matter of news without making any further
use thereof.

Quest. What if we cannot thus furnish our selves?

Answ. Then let us read, or cause to be read, some portion of Scripture, out of
which we may be the better furnished: And as for persons, we must consider
whether they be superiors, inferiors, or equals, whether good or bad, whether
they need instruction, reproof, quickening, or comfort, etc. that so we may
accordingly apply our speeches to their, and our own edification: as Christ
did, Luke 14.7, 8. and 11.27, 28.

Quest. Why must we be so careful thus to furnish and exercise our selves?

Answ. Because we are commanded to provoke one another to love, and good works,
Heb. 10.24. To exhort one another daily, Heb. 3.12. To redeem the time, Ephesians.
5.16.

Now a wo^ spoken in due season is like apples of Gold, etc. Prove. 25.11. Our
speec^ must be gracious always, etc. Col. 4.6. No corrupt communication must
pr^^^ed out of our mouths, etc. Ephesians. 4.29, 30. we must edify one another, 1
These. 5.11. So did Paul, Act. 26.27, 28, 29.

Quest. What if for all this we cannot bring our hearts to it?

Answ. Its better for such to keep home, to look to our families, and attend
our callings, then to go into company where we neither do, nor receive good.

Quest. What if we meet with such brutish and scornful persons as will not
endure good communication?

Answ. Then follow Christ's rule: Give not that which is holy unto dogs, etc.
Mat. 7.6. and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, Ephesians.
5.11. Yet withal, we must wisely bear, and seek to win them: but if we cannot
prevail, we must follow Solomon's rule, Prove. 14.7. Depart from the company of
a foolish man, when thou see not in him the words of wisdom.

Practice of Christianity.

Quest. What other reason may be rendered why we should so carefully shun evil
company?

Answ. Because the Scripture teaches us to shun all sinful occasions, as well
as actions: therefore we must keep out of the way.

Quest. Seeing there is so much danger by bad company, what must we do that
live in bad times and places?

Answ. First, look to thy grace that it be true, and then thou may be sure
Joseph did in the Court of wicked Pharaoh: Nehemiah in the Court of Artaxerxes:
Obadiah in Ahabs Court: Daniel in Nebuchadnezzars: Abijah in wicked, and
idolatrous Jeroboams house: and the Saints in Nero's household.

Isaiah, chapter 6.5. and David, Psalm. 120.5. and Lot, 2 Pet. 2.7, 8.

Phil. 2.15. As stars shine brightest in a dark night, and fire burns hottest
in a frosty day: so should our profession shine brightest in the darkest
places; and our zeal burn hottest when the love of many waxes cold?

Abraham did his lie by his being in Gerar, Genesis 20.11. Its the badnesse of thy
heart, not of the place that makes thee bad. As no place, though never so good,
can exempt a man from sin: the Angels sinned in heaven, Adam in Paradise,
Judas in Christ's family: so no place, though never so bad, can excuse a man
from sin.



Noscitur ex socio qui non cognoscitur ex se, Deuteronomy. 22.10.

Master Love of Grace.

Quest. Whether is company better then solitariness?

Answ. Though there be a fit time for solitariness, and every thing is
beautiful in its season: yet civil conversation is to be preferred before
solitariness, as tending more to the glory of God, the advancement and
enlarging of the Kingdom of Christ, the good both of Church and Commonwealth
with all the members of them, and our own present comfort, and future joy,
which is much augmented, when by our Christian conversation, and virtuous
actions, our holy profession, and good example, our admonitions, exhortations,
counsel, consolation; our works of justice, and charity, and by all other good
Offices mutually performed, we build up those that are about us in their most
holy faith, and draw many to accompany us to the Kingdom of Heaven: Hence,
Genesis 2.18. Its not good for man to be alone, Eccles. 4.9, 10. Two are better
then one, etc. and Saint Paul lays it as a charge upon all. Heb. 10.24, 25. To
provoke one another to love and good works, etc.

Quest. How may this be further proved?

Answ. First, God commends it to us by his works of creation: For he has made
us in our natures political, and sociable creatures, who take comfort in
conversing together.

Secondly, in his wise providence he has so disposed of us that we should not

Thirdly, God has linked all men together into society, as it were particular

Fourthly, in our renovation, we are, as it were, anew created into one body,
Corinth. 12.1, 15, 25, 26.

Quest. What are the benefits which redound to the whole body, and to all
particular members hereby?

Answ. First, hereby they are linked together by the same Spirit, and in the
bond of love to perform all mutual Offices of Christian charity which may
advance

Secondly, they communicate in the same blessings, and rejoice in one another

Thirdly, they stir up Gods graces in one another, both by word, and good
example, helping to remove impediments that lie in the way, and exhorting

Quest. How must we prepare our selves before we go into company?

Answ. First, when we are free, and left to our choice, we must choose such
company as in all likelihood may either do us good, or at least receive some

Secondly, we must also pray to God to give us his grace, and holy Spirit,

Thirdly, seeing the enemy of our salvation lays nets and snares to entrap us
in

Fourthly, we must not propound this as our end, to pass away the time, and to

Fifthly, we must put off, and cast from us turbulent passions, and disordered
affections, love; See the benefits of it, 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6, 7. and with it we
must put on the spirit of meekness, and patience to put up injuries, and pass
by offenses, and to bear with infirmities: The spirit of humility, etc.

Quest. Being thus prepared, what must our carriage be in company?

Answ. First, we must sincerely seek Gods glory, and our own salvation;
shunning

Matthew. 5.16. so we are exhorted, 1 Pet. 2.12. so did Paul behave himself, 1
These. 2.10.

Phil. 4.8, 9. This the Gospel teaches us, Tit, 2.12.

Romans 13.8, 10. Col. 3.14.

Pet. 3.8. Romans 12.15. Phil. 3.16. and to walk by the same rule, so far as
will stand with truth and justice.

Romans 12.16. but condescending to men of low degree in the truth, and in things
indifferent, and of small moment: or if we dissent, to do it in a meek and
peaceable manner.

Romans 12.17, 21. For which end we must follow Saint Paul counsel, Col. 3.12, 13.

Quest. But what if through accident, or our necessary occasions, we fall into
ill company?

Answ. Then we must not hide our profession, lest Christ be ashamed of us, Mat.
10.33. nor applaud them in their wicked courses, endure their reproaches and
ta^nts at Religion, countenance their swearing, or profane jests with our
smiles, much less run with them into the same excess of riot, 1 Pet. 4.4.
but rather labor to reclaim them, and gain them to Christ. For which end we
must.

1. See that in all our carriage we be unblamable, Phil. 2.15. that they may
have nothing to say against us, Tit. 2.7, 8. Thus we are exhorted, 1 Pet. 3.15,
16.

2. We must walk worthy our high calling, Ephesians. 4.1. adorning our profession by
our holiness, and righteousness, that if possible we may win them to Christ,
Matthew. 5.16. 1 Pet. 2.11, 12.

3. If by all this they will not be reclaimed, yet we must not mingle spleen,
and choler with our zeal, but behave our selves meekly, with patience and
forbearance. For, Jam. 1.20. the wrath of man does not accomplish the
righteousness of God. Hence we are so much pressed to peaceablenesse, Romans
12.18. yet may we not for peace-sake betray the truth, or forgo our own piety.
We must follow peace with holiness, Heb. 12.14. and not neglect the things
whereby we may edify one another, Romans 14.19. We must not bear with those
that are evil, Rev. 2.2.

4. We must not by such wicked company be discouraged from any good, not be
moved to neglect any Christian duty which present occasion makes necessary.

Mr. Downams Guide to godliness.

Quest. Why must we at other times carefully shun the society of the wicked?

Answ. First, Because its frequently forbidden in the Scripture: As Prove. 4.14,
15^ Ephesians. 5.11. 2 These. 3.6. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Cor. 6.14. See the danger of it in
David's matching with scoffing Mechol, 1 Samuel 18.21.

Jehorams marrying with Ahabs daughter, 2 Samuel 6.16, 10.

Secondly, we have the examples of the godly studiously declining such company:
Of Elisha, 2 King. 3.14. of David, Psalm. 26.45. and 101.4, 7. and 6.8. and

Thirdly, There are many reasons to enduce us to it: For

1. We are in great danger in a short time to grow, like unto them: For sin is
of a contagious nature, and we are most apt to receive infection, and they will
endeavor to entice us, Prove. 1.10, 11, 12. This David know, and therefore
resolves against such company, Psalm. 119.115. and prays to God for assistance,
Psalm. 141.4. See the danger of keeping such company in these examples, Act.
13.8. Pro. 22.24, 25. Gen 42.15, 16. the reason is rendered by Paul, 1 Cor. 5.6.

2. Such society argues strongly that we are not truly religious, and upright
in heart, but that we still halt between God and the World, For Prove. 29.27. An
unjust (...) is an abomination to the just, and be that is upright in his way
is an abomination to the wicked. See also, Joh. 14.9. Joh. 1.15.

Quest. Whom then must we consort ourselves with all?

Answ. First, With those that are godly, and virtuous, as being a singular
furtherance to all christian duties, Prove. 13.20. Hereby we may edify one
another, Heb. 10.24. For the more we converse with such, the greater increase
we shall find of one piety, faith, love, zeal, etc. as coals laid together do
kindle one another. So we see in the example of David, who rejoiced in the
society of such Psa. 16.3. Psa. 119.63, 79. Hence Psalm. 222.1. when the Church
flourished most, and did thrive in grace, and godliness they thus conversed
together,, Acts 2.46. and 9.31.

Quest. What other arguments may provoke us to make choice of such company?

Answ. it takes away the tediousness of our journey, when we have such Mat.
18.20. where two or three are gathered together in his name, Christ is in the
midst to make himself known to them.

Secondly, Good company preserves us from falling into many sins, and inciteth
Prove. 27.17. For as iron sharpens Iron, so does the face of a man his friend:
Saul himself prophesied by keeping company with the Prophets, much more are
Gods children inflamed, and provoked to good by such company.

Thirdly, Hereby we are the better fitted, and enabled to perform all Christian

1. Of watching one over another, that we may take all occasions of doing good,
by restraining such as are ready to fall, and provoking each other to all
virtuous actions, Heb. 10.24. we must strengthen our brethren, Luke 22.32. So
Phil. 2.4.

2. Of instruction, whereby with all readiness we inform the ignorant, and
enlighten them in the knowledge of God, and his truth, Act. 26.18. Reclaim the
erroneous: exhorted to, Jam. 5.20. Turn many to righteousness, and therefore
shall shine in the kingdom of God, Dan. 12.3.

3. Of admonition, whereby we put our brethren in mind of their duty, Romans
15.14. 1 Th^s. 5.14. either when through forgetfulness they fall into sin, or
omit the duties of Gods service.

4. Of reproof, whereby we rebuke them that wilfully fall into sin, and
continue in it without amendment, required, Epes. 5.11. otherwise we make our
selves accessory to their sins. So Mat. 18.15. Yea otherwise we hate them, Lev.
19.17.

5. Of Exhortation, whereby we incite, and provoke them to all duties of
godliness, quickening those which are dull: dissuading from sin those which are
ready to fall, and encouraging those that run well in their Christian course:
as Heb. 3.13. Exhort one another daily, etc.

6. Of Consolation, whereby we strengthen the weak hands, and feeble knees,
Heb. 12.12. and refresh with seasonable comforts such as are ready to faint
under the burden of their afflictions: as 1 These. 5.11, 14. Romans 12.14. For its
an ease to those that are in misery, to have companions in their sufferings.

7. Of Counsel, whereby we advise those, who of themselves know not what to
do: and this sometimes the weaker may perform to the stronger, as Abigail did
to David: because lookers on being free from prejudice, and passion, can see
more clearly then those that are interested in the business.

8. Of good example, by which, shining before them in the light of an holy
conversation, we do not only show them the way to Heaven, but (as it were) take
them by the hand, and lead them in it. So Mat. 5.16. 1 Pet. 2.12. and 3.1.

CHAP. XXXIX. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about Confession.
Quest. IS confession a duty that God requires of Christians?

Answ. Yea, its a Gospel-duty that we should confess with our mouths as well
as believe with our hearts, Romans 10.10.

Quest. What is this confession required?

Answ. Its an open profession of Christ, and his Gospel, his truths and ways,
and a pleading for the same.

Quest. What must we confess concerning Christ?

Answ. First, his Natures; as his Divinity and Humanity: So did the woman
Canaan, Matthew. 15.22. John the Baptist, Joh. 1.20, 27, 34. the Eunuch, Act. 8.
37. Peter, Joh. 6.69.

Secondly, his Offices: so did Nathaniel, Mat. 16.16. the woman of Samaria,
John the Baptist, John 1.29.

Thirdly, his beauty, excellency, and dignity: So did the Church, Cant. 5. John
the Baptist, Joh. 1.20, 27. and 3.28. to 33. so the Saints, Rev. 5.11, 12, 13.

Fourthly, especially such things concerning Christ as others deny, or doubt
of: Act. 4.2. Romans 10.9. Act. 24.15. and 23.6.

Quest. What else must we confess in reference to Christ?

Answ. First, our faith in him, and his Gospel: So, Mark 9.24. Joh. 9.38. Act.
24.15. Isa. 45.23, 24. Our interest in God and Christ. So, Job 19.25, etc. Joh.
20.28. Cant. 2.16.

Secondly, our grace received from Christ, and of the work, and workings of it:
Cor. 15.10. 1 Timothy 1.13, 14. 1 King. 18.12. John 21.16. Psalm. 43.4. Gal. 6.14.
2 Cor. 12.10.

Thirdly, our worshipping of God after a Gospel manner, purely, and spiritually
Acts 24.13, 14.

Fourthly, our practice, or manner of life: what is the constant bent of our
resolutions, Psalm. 66.16. 1 John 1.1, 3. Thus relations of experiences are
confessions of Christ before men: So also to bear witness aagainst sin,
though with our own danger: So did John the Baptist, Mark 6.18, 27.

Quest. When must we thus make confession?

Answ. When we are called thereunto either publicly, or privately.

Quest. How may we be called publicly to it?

Answ. Either by the Church, or by the Magistrate.

Quest. When are we called to it by a Church?

Answ. Either at the constitution of it; or at our admission into it.

Quest. How are we called to confession at the constitution of a Church?

Answ. As Christ makes the confession of Faith to be the foundation upon which
his visible Church is built, Mat. 16.16. to 19. whence two things may be
collected.

1. That a good confession of faith in Christ should be made, and laid as a
foundation at the gathering, or constituting of a Church, which may be
effectual to keep the Members sound in the faith, and to engage them to hold
fast their principles.

2. That those are the fittest stones for the building of a Church, that can
give the best account of their faith in Christ.

Quest. How are we called to confession at our admittance into a Church?

Answ. At our admission into a Church, to which we desire to join our selves,
being required to give an account of our faith and holiness, we should be free
and ready to do it.

Quest. How may that be proved?

Answ. First, because, as to believe with the heart, makes a man a member of
the invisible Church, so to confess with the mouth, qualifies him to be a
member of the visible Church of Christ.

Jerusalem was of Paul, Act. 9.26, 27.

Act. 2.41.

Pet. 2.5.

Quest. How are we called to this public confession by a Magistrate?

Answ. When we are brought before Rulers, and Governors for Christ's sake, and
examined about our religion, then we ought to bear witness to Christ, and his
truth, as Christ, and his Apostles did, John 18.37. 1 Timothy 6.1. Luke 22.70.
Mark 14.61, 62. So Act. 4.5, to 16. and 5.27, to 33. Act. 6.12.15. and 24.14.
to 22. and 26.2, etc. and 24.25, etc.

Quest. When are we called to it privately?

Answ. First, when we are asked by a single person, who desires information,
and lays not a snare for us, 1 Pet. 3.15. so did Christ, Joh. 4.15, 26. and
10.24, etc. and 7.35, etc.

Jude 3. we are set for the defense of the Gospel, Phil. 1.17. Act. 19.29. and
17.18, 24, etc. and 15.2. and 6.9, 10, etc. Hence, Phil. 1.27.

etc. and to speak as much for them as others do against them, yea, to outspeak
them, and put them to silence.

Quest. Why ought we to make confession with the mouth?

Answ. First, in regard of God: and that,

1. Because its an homage, and service that God requires of us, Isa. 45.23.
with Romans 14.11.

2. God the Father did confess, and give testimony by a voice from heaven to
his Son Christ Jesus, Matthew. ^.17. and 17.5. So Christ says, John 5.32, 37.
and 8.18. and herein we should be followers of God, as dear children, Ephesians.
5.1.

3. Hereby we give glory to God, Phil. 2.11. Joh. 7.19. Romans 15.6.

Secondly, in respect of Christ, and that

1. Because its Christ's privilege to be confessed, or an honorary that was
conferred on him by God for his deep humiliation, Phil. 2.9, 10. and not to
confess him, is to rob him of that glory which is peculiar to him.

2. It was Christ's practice, both in life and death. He confessed his Father,
John 1.18. and 8.38. that God is a spirit, John 4.24. How he will be
worshipped: John 15.15. and 3.32. He did bear witness to the truth, Joh.
18.37. Hence Rev. 1.5. and 3.14.

Thirdly, in regard of our selves: and that,

1. Because we are Gods witnesses, Isa. 43.10. To this end God gives us more
Mat. 13.16. Its our honor to be witnesses of Christ, Joh. 1.7. and 21.24. 2
Cor 11.5. Act. 26.16. and 9.15.

2. If we confess God, and Christ, and his truth, we shall be confessed by
both.

1. By the Father, who will own and avouch us to be his people, portion,
jewels, friends, etc. and that, 1. Before men: If we testify for God, he will
give testimony of us, as he did of Abraham, Abel, Moses, Daniel, Enoch, etc.
Heb. 11.4, 5. Hence Gods servants have appealed to God to be their witness,
Job 16.19. Psalm. 139.23, 24. and 7.8. and 26.1, 2. If we plead for God, he will
plead for us; as, Numb. 12.8. Job. 42.7. Lam. 3.58. Psalm. 37.6. 2. Before
Devils. So, Job 1.8. and 2.4.


2. By the Son: If we confess Christ, he will confess us, Mat. 10.32. Luke
12.8.

3. If we confess God and Christ we shall be encouraged, defended, and
honored even here.

1. We shall be encouraged and strengthened by Christ too, and in our testimony,
Act. 18.9. and 23.10, 11. 2 Timothy 4.^6, ^7. 2. We shall be defended, and
delivered from the assaults, and designs of our enemies, Acts 18.9, 10. and
26.16, 17. and 23.10, 11, 20, 21. 2 Timothy 4.17. 3. If we honor God by
confession, he will honor us, and that 1. With favor, affection, and respect
from men, 1 Pet. 4.14. Act. 4.33. Rev. 3.8, 9. 2. With victory over Satan, Rev.
12.10, 11. 3. Yea, God will honor us with mutual inhabitation, which implies
intimate communion, 1 John 4.15.

4. If we confess Christ aright, we shallbe saved. Confession tends to
salvation.

1. As a way appointed us to God, to walk in toward heaven. 2. As a character,
property, and practice of such as shall be saved. 3. As a furtherance of our
salvation, because its a means, or help to our perseverance in the faith, even
to the end: and then, Mat. 24.13. Heb. 10.23.


Quest. How must this confession be made?

Answ. First, freely, without compulsion* as water flows out of the Fountain.

Joh. 1.19, 20. Hence our confession of Christ should flow from faith as the
fountain, and that

1. From our Faith in Christ. Confession with the mouth should proceed from
Faith in the heart, 2 Cor. 4.13. Psalm. 116.10.

Object. But, Romans 14.22. Have thou Faith, have it to thy self, before God,
therefore we need not confess it before men?

Answ. Paul there speaks not of a justifying Faith, but of a Faith, or
persuasion of Christian liberty in things indifferent: This Faith a man may
keep to himself, or so show or use it, as thereby not to offend his brother.

2. From out experience in some measure of Christ, and his grace, or of what we
confess: This will provoke us to a confession before men, as Act. 4.18, etc. So
1 John 1.1. Christ gave his Apostles experience, and Paul, Act. 26.16.

Acts 23.6. with 24.21. and 20.23, 24. and 21.13. Phil. 1.20. Its our honor so
to do, Act. 5.41. and 4.8, etc. Psalm. 119.46, 2 Samuel 6.20, etc.

Rev. 11.7. and Paul, 2 Timothy 4.7. Act. 23.25. Hence, Rev. 3.3. This Christ
takes kindly, Rev. 2.13. and 3.8, 10.

Act. 24.20 and 23.9. For which end we must do it.

1. With meekness, from an humble spirit, without any show of pride,
ostentation, passion, or bitterness.

2. With fear of God, of offending him whilst we are confessing him, or doing,
or saying any thing which may cause the way of truth to be evil spoken of: And
with reverence of men, by giving all due respect to them before whom we speak.



1. Out of love to Christ, and his truth: For what we love we will own openly
Cant. 5.9. Love is strong as death, etc.

2. Out of zeal for God, his glory, the credit of his cause, the honor of his
truth, the propagation of his Gospel, the encouragement and comfort of his
friends, and the conviction of his enemies.

Mat. 10.37, etc. Joh. 9.22. Rev. 1.9. and 11.3, 7.10. and 12.17. and 20.4.

Mr. Reyners Government of the tongue.

Quest. Whether is it lawful for a man being urged to go to Idol-service, and
to hear Mass, so he keep his heart unto God?

Answ. It is not, as may be proved by these reasons.

Paul, 1 Cor. 8. and the 10. Chap. disputes this question, whether they might
go into the Idol temples, and there eat of meat offered to them, so they did
not partake with Idolaters in the worship of their Idols? This he concludes
utterly unlawful; for they could not partake of the Lords cup, and the cup of
devils: so is it unlawful for a Protestant to go to the Popish Mass.

Romans 12.1. we must give up our bodies a living sacrifice unto God.

Object. Against this some object the example of Naaman, 2 Kin. 5.18, 19* where
they infer, that the Prophet gave Naaman leave to worship in an Idol-Temple?

Answ. First, Some answer that Naaman speaks only of civil, and Politic
worship: For his Office was to kneel down that the King might lean on his
shoulder: and Naaman makes open protestation, ver. 7. that he will Worship no
God but the God of Israel.

Secondly, Others answer better, that Naaman acknowledges it a sin to go the
Rimmon, and therefore craves pardon for it twice, verse 18. and withal, vows
that thenceforth he would offer sacrifice to no God, save only to the Lord.

Thirdly, Naaman entreats the Prophet to pray for him, that he might be
constant in the service of the true God: and that in case, through humane
frailty, he

Object. But if I do not go to mass, I shall give offense to the Papists?

Answ. We are to do our duty, though men be never so much offended, Mat.
15.14. Again* we ought not to do evil, that good may come of it.

Quest. Whether may a man, especially a Minister, with a good conscience fly in
persecution?

Answ. Sometimes it is lawful, though not always: For

First, Christ commands it, Matthew. 10.15. neither was this command ever
repealed.

Secondly, We have many examples for it in Scripture, of Jacob, Genesis 27. and
Moses, Exodus 2.15. Heb. 11.27. of the Prophets hidden by Obadiah, 1 Kin. 18.13.
of Elijah, 1 Kin, 19.3. of Christ himself, Joh. 10.39. of Paul, Act. 9.25.29,
30.

Object. Persecution is good, and therefore it may not be eschewed?

Answ. First, Some things are simply good of themselves, as virtues, and all

Object. Persecution is sent of God for the trial, and good of his Church?

Answ. First, Evil things sent of God, may be avoided, if he show us a way, or
means to escape them.

Secondly, There is a two fold will of God, his revealed will, and his secret

Object. To fly in persecution is a kind of denial of Christ, and against
confession?

Answ. Christian confession is twofold: first, Open. Secondly, implicit.

1. Open confession is when a man boldly confesses his faith before the
adversary even unto death: as the Martyrs did.

2. Implicit, which though it be inferior to the former, yet its a true
confession, and acceptable unto God: and this is when a man to keep his
religion, is content to forsake his Country, friends, and goods.

Object. But Christ bids us not to fear them that can but kill the body,
therefore we may not fly? Mat. 10.28.

Answ. First, This forbids not all fear, but such a fear as tends to
Appostacy, causing men to renounce faith, and a good conscience.





Quest. When may a man, Minister, or other fly?

Answ. First, When there is no hope of doing good by his abode in that place,
where the persecution is: but not when there is hope: at such a time God forbad
it Paul, Act. 18.10.



Quest. But what if the people will not suffer him to fly?

Answ. They should be so far from hindering him, that they should rather further
him: So Acts 19.30. But if the persecution be public, then he is not to fly:
For then the strong should support and confirm the weak.



Mat. 10.23.









Quest. When may not a Pastor, or other man fly?

Answ. First, when God puts into their heart the spirit of courage, and Paul,
Act. 20.22. and 21.13. One in Queen Mary's days having this motion to stand
out, and yet flying, for the very act, felt such a sting in his conscience,
that he could never have peace till he died.



Quest. Whether then may a man imprisoned, break prison if he can.

Answ. No man being in durance may use any unlawful, or violent means to
escape: for we may not resist the Magistrate in our sufferings. Servants must
submit to the unjust corrections of their Masters, 1 Pet. 2.19. the Apostles
would not so escape when they might; till the Angel brought them forth, Act.
5.19.

may glorify God, and do good to his Church: For the discharge of the duties
of our callings must be preferred before our very lives.

Fourthly, When God by his Providence cuts off all lawful means,

CHAP. XL. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about confession of sin.
Quest. IS confession of sin a necessary duty?

Answ. Yea, or else God would never have promised so great a reward to it, as 1 John 1.9* Job comforted himself with it, Job 31.33. So Psalm. 2.5. Ut somnium
narrare vigilantis; Sic peccata confiteri viri paenitentis est. Aug. To tell a
man's dream is the sign of a waking man, so to confess his sins, of a true
penitent.

Quest. May not a wicked man confess his sins?

Answ. Yea, as we see Pharaoh, Saul, Judas, etc. did.

Quest. How then shall we distinguish between the confession of a regenerate,
and unregenerate man?

Answ. By these signs.

First, True confession comes from a troubled soul, as we see in the Publican:
David's: From a melting heart, as did Josiahs. But the other knows it not: the
racking pain only wrings it from him, not the mercy of that God whom he has
offended.

Secondly, The first proceeds from a bleeding heart, laying hold upon mercy: as
Dan. 9.9. Ezra 10.2. the other wants this, therefore Christ says, Repent and
believe,

Thirdly, It comes from an honest heart in the first, purposing not to sin: He
confesses, and forsakes, Prove. 28.1^. Hence Ezra 10.2, 3. The other though he
Deuteronomy. 1.40, 41. Dike on the Heart.

Quest. Why must we remember, and confess our sins?

Answ. First, Because promise of forgiveness is made to it, Prove. 28.13. 1 John

Secondly, God has made good this promise upon the right performance of it,
Sam. 12.13. Psalm. 32.5.

3. Threats are denounced against those that confess not their sins, Prove.
28.13. Joh. 1.8, 10. Dr. Gouge on Heb.

Quest. In confessing our sins, must we descend into particulars?

Answ. Yea, so did David, 2 Samuel 24.10. So Ezra 9.6, 11. Nehem. 9.1. etc. Dan.
9.5, 6, 11, 13. Mat. 3.6. 1 Timothy 1.13. Act. 19.18, 19.

Quest. Why must we do this?

Answ. First, This is the next way to bring us to that measure of humiliation
which is necessary: Hence Acts 2.36. and 3.14, etc.

Cor. 11.31. If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged, etc. Hieron
^n Psalm. 51.

Quest. Is it a (...) to confess our sins to men also?

Answ. Yea, so Jam. 5.16. confess your faults one to another: not only to the
Elders of the Church, but to your brethren also: therefore its no ground for
Popish auricular confession, wherein they require that every one, at least once
a year, should in the ear of a Priest confess all his sins, together with the
circumstances of them: a politic invention to know the secrets of others, to
keep them in awe, and to enslave their consciences.

Quest. In what cases then is confession to be made to others?

Answ. First, In case of scandal given by persons before, or after their
reception into the Church and fellowship of the Gospel.

1. Before their admission: such as desire admittance, having formerly
committed gross sins, should solemnly acknowledge their sinful courses, and
godly sorrow for them, and their resolution against them for the future, to
give satisfaction to the Church, that God has wrought a change in them. So
Matthew. 3.6. Act. 15.18, 20.

2. After their admission, such as give offense by walking disorderly, either
to the whole Church, or to some particular members of it, they (...) to confess
their faults to the whole society, or to the persons to whom the ^ame is known,
to testify their repentance, that such as know their sin, may know their
sorrow also: And 1. If the offense be public: by their open confession to
preserve the credit of the society, and roll away the infamy from it, that it
may not be accounted an ulcerous body: and also thereby to warn others to fear,
least they offend. 2. If the offending brother be cast out, or the brethren
withdraw from him they may receive satisfaction by the free, and hearty
confession of his offense, and receive him to fellowship again, and renew their
love toward him, as 2 Cor. 2.6, 7.8. yea, to forgive, and comfort him, lest he
be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow.


Matthew. 5.23, 24. Luke 17.34.





1. Of a common judgment, when a man by his sin has had a special hand in
pulling down the same: as Achan, Josh. 7. then he must confess it both to God,
and before men, So Jon. 1.10.

2. Of a particular affliction: as sickness, etc. then also its good not only
to confess our sin to God, but to men also: as Jam. 5.14, 15.16.

Fifthly, In case of reproof from others, when they tell us of our faults, Sam.
12.7, 8.13.

Sixthly, In case of co-partnership with othe^s in sin: when any one of their
consciences are awakened, he should confess his sin to his fellow-drunkard,
thief, etc. to awaken them, and so to help them out of the snares of the Devil.
So Genesis 42.21, 22. Luke 23.39, 40.

Seventhly, To magnify the riches of Gods free grace to us, though we have
Paul, 1 Timothy 1 13. Acts 22.4, 5. and 26.9.10.11.

Eighthly, To prevent sin in others: when by confessing the sins, and the evil
we have found in them, we may make them to beware thereof. So its useful for
Malefactors at their execution to confess their sins that others may be warned.

Quest. Are we bound to confess every sin to others?

Answ. First, We are bound absolutely to confess every known sin to God, but

Secondly, We are bound to confess such sins to others, as are open, or known
to them, not our secret sins: as 1. Our bosom-sins, we need not to confess but
to God alone, Psalm. 19.12. 2. Secret sins, unknown to men, we may conceal
them. 1. Whilst Providence covers them. 2. Whilst Conscience is quiet: But when
God in his Providence brings them to light, or our consciences, being awaked,
terrify and affright us, so that we can have no ease till we have acknowledged
them, then we are to confess our sins, though we suffer for it.
3. Yet sometimes we may confess our secret sins to others, to obtain ease,
comfort, counsel, prayers, etc.


Quest. Who are the persons, to whom we must confess our faults?

Answ. First, to such persons, or societies, whom we have injured, and
scandalized, or consociated in sin with them.

Secondly, Our secret sins we should confess to ministers, as to our Spiritual
Physicians, or to such others as we judge wise, godly, and faithful.

Quest. But hereby we may loose our credit, and lie under a blot?

Answ. If thou choosest such to confess to, it will not prejudice thy credit:

1. Such will consider themselves, that they also may be tempted, and may be
forced to do the like, and therefore what they would that others should do to
them, they will do to thee, Mat. 7.12.

2. It will rather tend to our credit: For it will represent to them the
tenderness of our consciences, humility, hatred of sin, and fear of offending.

Quest. From what principles, or in what manner should we confess our sins to
others?

Answ. First, Out of zeal for God, to give him glory before men, and that 1.
Of his Omnisciency, in knowing our most secret sins. 2. Of his Providence in
detesting them. 3. Of his justice in punishing, or righteousness, and
faithfulness in afflicting us for them. 4. Free grace in pardoning them, and in
accepting, employing, and saving us from them. 5. Patience in sparing us, and
mercy in doing us good, notwithstanding our sins against him.


Secondly, Out of hatred against sin, we must confess with grief, hatred, and



Paul, 2 Cor. 12.6.

Quest. Why are men so backward to confess sin?

Answ. First, because it brings shame, and grief along with it, which sin
cannot endure. For sin has so perverted the soul, as to misplace shame in the
acknowledging offenses, which should be placed in offending.



Joh. 3.20. Sin loves to wear a veil of secrecy, or a vizard of counterfeit
piety, or a garment of excuses: to wrap it self (like the Devil in Samuels
Mantle, that the filthy shame of its nakedness may not appear.

Quest. Why should we confess sin, seeing its so filthy, and shameful a thing
that it becomes not Saints once to name it?

Answ. First, though sin be filthy it it self, yet the confession of it is
clean, and commendable.

1. With delight, and boasting of it, and indulgence to it: This is prohibited
to Saints. 2. With detestation of it, indignation at it, and grief for it: this
is commanded.

CHAP. XLI. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about carnal Confidence.
Quest. WHat carnal confidence is particularly forbidden in Scripture?

Answ. First, trusting in riches, Job. 31.24. 1 Timothy

Secondly, in men, Psalm. 118.8. Though Princes, v. 9.

Thirdly, In strength of a City, Prove. 21.22.

Fourthly, in our relations, Mich. 7.5.

Fifthly, in Gods enemies, Jer. 2.37. Hos. 14.3.

Sixthly, in places of idolatrous worship, Jer. 48.13.

Seventhly, in the flesh, Phil. 3.3.

Quest. What reasons does the Scripture give against it?

Answ. First, all such confidence shall be rooted out, Job 18.14.

Secondly, its punishable, Job. 31.28.

Thirdly, it argues great folly, Prove. 14.16.

Fourthly, its deceitful, Prove. 25.19.

Fifthly, its rejected by God, Jer. 2.37.

Quest. Why have men naturally confidence in outward things?

Answ. Their hearts being not filled with grace, they relish not Christ, but
fly to these outward things for refuge. Thus the Jews boasted in the name of
Holy people, their Law, Temple, Holy Land, etc. and many amongst us, of hearing
the word, receiving the Sacrament, uncovering the head, bowing the knee, etc.
Yet all these could not save them from captivity, nor us from destruction.

Quest. Why are men taken up with carnal confidence in these things?

Answ. First, because outward things are easy, and men cannot endure to apply

Secondly, they are glorious, and men desire to be taken notice of.

Thirdly, men have a foolish conceit that God is pleased with the outward act,

Fourthly, men want knowledge of themselves, an inward change, a sense of their

Quest. How shall we know whether our confidence is carnal, or no?

Answ. First, Where this carnal confidence is, there is bitterness of spirit
against sincerity: None persecuted Christ more then the Scribes and Pharisees
which sat in Moses chair, etc.



Dr. Sibs on Phil. 3.3.

Isa. 30.1, 2, 3, etc. and 31.1, etc.

Fourthly, when we rest our souls upon meaner things, never seeking to Divine

Fifthly, when men love to sleep in a whole skin, and therefore will take the

1. The creature yields not that we expect it should: there is falsehood in
these things; they promise much, and perform little, and so deceive them that
trust in them.

2. They are mutable, and subject to change: All things come to an end save God
who is unchangeable.

3. They are snares and baits to draw us away from God by reason of the vanity
of our hearts, which are vainer then the things themselves, Psalm. 62.9. Eccl.
1.1.

Quest. How may we prevent or cure this carnal confidence?

Answ. A right apprehension of God will do it. For the more, or less that we
conceive of God as we should do, so the more, or less we disclaim confidence
in the creature, They who in their affections of love, joy, affiance, and
delight, are taken up too much with the creature (say what they will) they
profess to all the world by their practice that they know not God: But the who
know and apprehend him in his greatness and goodness, in that proportion they
withdraw their hearts from the creature, and all things else. As in a pair of
balances, so where God weighs down in the soul, all other things are light; and
where other things prevail, there God is set light by. Dr. Sibs on Hosea.

Quest. What is confidence?

Answ. Its a certainty that we conceive of a future desired good, or of the
love, and fidelity of a person, whereby the heart is filled with joy and love.

Quest. What is the only subject proper for man's entire confidence?

Answ. God, All-good, Almighty, and All-wise, without him all things that men
use to repose their confidence upon are waves and quicksands. Men are mutable,
and though they could give good security for the constancy of their wills, they
can give none for the continuance of their life. The goods of the earth fail
our expectation, or come short of our satisfaction, or slip from our
possession: they will leave us, or we them: No wonder then if they that repose
their full and whole confidence in them are seen so often to fall into
despair. Here then the true counsel for tranquillity is to trust wholly upon
none but God, on other things according to their nature and capacity: they
shall never deceive us if we require nothing of them above their nature.

Confidence is good according to the goodness of the subject that it reposeth
upon: wherefore confidence in God the only sovereign good, perfect, solid,
immutable, is the best of all, and the only thing that can give assurance, and
content to the soul. He that is blessed with that confidence is half in Paradise
already: He is firm, safe, meek, serene, and too strong for all his enemies,
Psalm. 84.12. God is to him a Sun to give him light, heat, life, and plenty of
all goods: and a Shield to guard him, and shelter him from all evils: He gives
him grace in this life, and glory in the next. O Lord of Hosts, blessed is the
man that trusts in thee.

CHAP. XLII. Questions, and Cases of Conscience about the Conflict, or combat
between the flesh, and Spirit.
Quest. HOw will it appear that there is such a conflict in every regenerate
person?

Answ. By plain Testimonies of Scripture, as Gal. 5.17. The flesh lusts
against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, etc. Romans 7.19, 22.23.

Quest. What is the Spiritual conflict?

Answ. Its nothing else but a continual combat between the unregenerate part,
the flesh, with the lusts thereof, and the part regenerate, the Spirit, with
all the holy qualities, graces, and motions thereof, by reason of their
contrariety in nature, and conjunction in place, whereby they mutually lust,
and strive one against the other, the flesh willing, and embracing that evil,
which the Spirir nilleth and hates: and nilling, and shunning that good, which
the Spirit wills, and affects, and contrariwise. For in this conflict they
mutually assault each other with irreconcilable hatred, so that as the one
gets, the other loses, as one gath^rs strength, the other is weakened: as
in a pair of Scales, when own rises the other falls: they are like light, and
darkness, etc.

Quest. What are the causes of this Conflict?

Answ. The principal cause is Gods will for the manifestation of his own
glory: For which purpose he does not perfect our sanctification in this life;
but in part regenerating, and leaving us in part unregenerated.

Quest. But why did not the Lord (who could easily have done it) perfect
sanctification in us at first, as he did by his only word at first create, and
make us perfect?

Answ. Were there no other reason but that good pleasure of his most wise will,
it were sufficient to satisfy us. For he best knows what to give, and when to
give: But yet diverse reasons may be assigned for it: as

First, This course is most profitable, both for the setting forth of Gods
glory,

Quest. How does it more manifest, and magnify Gods glory?

Answ. that the weaker we are in our regenerate part, and the stronger the
flesh is, and all other the enemies of our salvation, the more clearly Gods
wisdom shines forth in strengthening this weak part, and enabling it to stand
in the day of battle: Yea, in causing it to obtain a full and final victory,
putting all its mighty enemies to flight. This moved the Lord to suffer the
prick in the flesh to molest Paul, 2 Cor. 12.9. that his grace might be
perfected in the Apostles weakness.

2. God is more glorified when as we, seeing the strength of our natural
corruptions, and our frailty, and the many infirmities of our spiritual part,
are moved hereby to attribute all the glory, and praise of our salvation to the
alone mercy of God, both in the respect of the beginning, and perfecting
thereof, and utterly denying our own selves, and all our righteousness, do
wholly rely upon the perfect righteousness of Christ: whereas if there were in
us perfect sanctification, we should hardly acknowledge the Lord to be all in
all in our salvation.

3. The wisdom and power of God is more manifested, and glorified, when as he
does his great works by contrary means, and causes, which in their own nature
would rather hinder them: therefore he will have us blind, that we may see; and
foolish, that we may be wise, etc. He will give blessedness to us, who have
so many wants, and corruptions, yea make our imperfections to serve as means
for the increasing of our happiness, this does exceedingly magnify his power,
and wisdom.

4. We are hereby made more thankful to the Lord, and more cheerful in seting
forth his praise, when notwithstanding our wants and imperfections, we are
supported, and saved, then if he should at first endue us with all perfection:
For the more we have found the want of Gods benefits, the more we prize them,
and so are the more thankful for them. So it was with St. Paul, when through
the violence of the flesh, he had been led captive to sin, Romans 7.24, 25. how
does he break forth into thankfulness. I thank God through Jesus Christ my
Lord.

5. Hereby we more glorify God when we are assured by our growth in grace, by
which we are enabled to resist the flesh, and the lusts thereof, that they are
the free gifts of God, and that he begins, increases, and continues them
in us, whereas otherwise we would think them to be some natural faculties, and
abilities, and not given us of God.

Quest. How is this conflict profitable for our good?

Answ. 1. Because its a notable means to train us up in humility, which is a
grace most acceptable unto God: and this is done when we see, and consider what
a miserable spoil sin has made of all those graces, and excellent endowments
which we had by Creation: how it has poisoned, and corrupted all the powers,
and parts of soul and body: how it has made us unfit for any good, and prone
to all evil; which corruption does in a great measure remain in us after
regeneration, darkning our understandings, defiling our consciences; perverting
out wills, hardening our hearts, etc. so that if we were not continually
assisted by the special grace of God, we should easily be foiled in the
conflict, and made a prey to our malicious enemies, 1 Cor. 4.7.

2. Its most effectual to work in us self-denial, without which we cannot be
Christ's Disciples. For when we plainly discern that there is nothing in our
selves to rest upon for the satisfying of Gods justice, this will make us fly
to Christ, to hunger and thirst after his perfect Righteousness, and so it will
make us wholly to rely upon him for justification, and salvation.

3. We are hereby moved to abhor sin which God so hates, and that with the
greater detestation, when as by our own experience, we find and feel the
poison of it working in our selves, and to bewail, and forsake it with more
earnest endeavors, when we see what miserable effects it produces, and what
cursed fruits it brings forth in us.

4. We are hereby occasioned to fly oftener unto God by fervent prayer,
acknowledging, and bewailing these relicts of corruption before the throne of
grace, earnestly craving the pardon of them, and strength against them, whereby
we may be enabled to mortify our corruptions, and to fly from all sin for the
time to come.

5. Through the remainders of these corruptions we have the benefit of
spiritual exercise to prevent sloth, whilst we make war against them, withstand
their assaults, prepare our selves for the conflict, watch over our hearts that
they be not surprised exercise our spiritual graces, and buckle to all holy
duties required by God for obtaining the victory, Phil. 2.12. 1 Cor. 16.13.
Ephesians. 6.10.

6. It makes us to go on in our Pilgrimage with contentment, and patiently to
bear all afflictions, not only because we deserve them by reason of our sins,
Lam. 3.39. But also because we know, and have experience that these corrections
are necessary to mortify our lusts, and to draw out the core of our
corruptions: and as salt to season us that we be not tainted, and perish in our
fleshly putrefaction.

7. By this conflict our hearts are weaned from the world, and it provokes us
to long after our heavenly happiness, when finding our selves tired with this
fight, not only with foreign foes, but these intestine traitors, we cannot but
earnestly desire that perfection which is only attainable in a better life,
Phil. 1.21. with Romans 7.23.

8. It causes us to long after the crown of victory, and when we have obtained
it, it will hereby become much more glorious. For the Lord will have us first
to fight, and overcome, and then he will reward us with the crown of victory:
He will first have our g^aces exercised, and manifested, and then he will give
us a proportion of glory, according to the proportion of our graces 2 Timothy 4.8.

Secondly, As its profitable that these relicts of sin should remain in us, so
its suitable, and seasonable to the time, and place wherein we live. For God
has

Quest. What are the formal, and essential causes of this conflict?

Answ. Because contraries do best illustrate contraries, let us remember that
there was a time when this conflict was not to be found in this little world of
man, the which was twofold.

First. That truly golden age, in which man was created after Gods image, and
lived in the state of innocence: at which time there was a blessed peace, and
heavenly Worldliness, and profaneness subdued, and held reason in subjection:
perverseness, and rebellion surprise the will: But in the heart there are such
multitudes of hellish enemies as can neither be named, or numbered, as legions
of unlawful lusts, infidelity, wicked hopes, hellish despair, hatred of God,
love of the world, pride, disobedience, deceit, cruelty, ambition,
covetousness, voluptuousness, etc.

Secondly, In the state of corruption there was no conflict, because the strong

Quest. How then come we to be freed out of this miserable condition?

Ans. Our gracious God of his infinite mercy, of his mere free grace, and good
will, sent his only Son into the world to redeem us by his precious death, to
vanquish, and subdue all the enemies of our salvation, and to set us at
liberty, who were in bondage, yea in love with our thraldom, not so much as
desiring to be freed from it, who not only paid the price of our redemption,
and provided a sovereign salve for all our sores, but applies the power, and
efficacy of his merits unto us, whilst by his word, made effectual by his
Spirit, he discovers unto us this work of our redemption, and the promises of
grace, and salvation made to all repentant and believing sinners, by which he
begets this faith in us, wherewith, as with a hand, we lay hold on, and apply
unto our selves his righteousness, death, and obedience for our justification,
and redemption, whence it is that we are freed from our sins, Christ having
satisfied for them, as also from our thraldom, to Satan, death, and
condemnation, so that they shall never be able to hurt us, or to lay any thing
to our charge. And not resting here, our powerful Savior sends his Spirit,
and graces into our hearts to pull us out of the dominion of sin, and Satan, to
regenerate, and purify us from the filth of our sins, by the power of the same
death, which delivered us from the guilt, and punishment due to it, and enabled
us to serve God in newness of life, by applying also unto us the virtue of his
resurrection.

Quest. What then is the formal cause of this Spiritual conflict?

Answ. Sanctification only begun, and not perfected in this life: not for want
of sufficient virtue in Christ's death, and resurrection, but through the
weakness of our faith, we being in part spiritual, and in part carnal: and
though Satan being thrust from his throne, cannot rule in us as a Tyrant, yet
is he not so wholly expelled, but he molesteth us as an enemy. So that there
may be two main and effectual causes given of this conflict between the spirit
accompanied with Gods graces, and the flesh attended with many sinful lusts:

1. The one is the antipathy, and contrariety which is between, which is as
unreconcilable as light, and darkness, heat, and cold, etc. so that the
prospering of the one, is the ruin of the other, and the victory of the one is
the others overthrow.

2. The second is their cohabitation in the same place, and subject, which
ministers to them occasion, and imposes a necessity of their continual
opposition, as when fire and water meet together, etc. Neither do these
opposite enemies dwell in diverse parts, but in the same parts, and faculties,
in the same understanding, will, body, and affections, so that the whole soul,
in respect of its diverse faculties, is partly flesh, and partly spirit.

Quest. But how can such utter enemies dwell together without the utter
destruction of the one party?

Answ. Though these contraries cannot dwell together in their prime vigor and
full strength, yet they may, when their degrees are abated, and their vigor
deadned.

Quest. What is this combat, and the manner how its fought in us?

Answ. Being by the Ministry of the Word brought to a sight and sense of our
wretched and damnable condition, our sleeping consciences are awakened, our
hard hearts are thoroughly humbled, and softened, so as our former carnal
security being shaken off, we mourn in the sight of our sin and misery: Then
being thus humbled, the Lord, by the preaching of the Gospel, makes known to us
his love in Christ, the infiniteness of his mercy, together with that singular
pledge thereof, the giving of his dear Son to death for our redemption: the
promises of the Gospel assuring us of the pardon of our sins, deliverance out
of the hands of our spiritual enemies, whom Christ has vanquished by his
death, and of the eternal salvation, both of our souls and bodies, if we lay
hold upon Christ, and his righteousness by a lively faith, and bring forth the
fruits thereof by forsaking our sins, and turning to God by unfeigned
repentance; all which being made known unto us, we begin to conceive that there
is some possibility of our getting out of the bondage to sin and Satan, and
attaining to salvation, which inflames our hearts with an earnest desire to get
out of this bondage, and to be made partakers of Christ, and his
righteousness, who alone can help us, and hereupon we resolve to deny our
selves and all other means as vain, and unprofitable, and to cast our selves
wholly upon Christ for justification, and salvation: From whence arises a
constant endeavor, in the use of all good means, for the attaining hereunto,
etc. which desires are no sooner wrought in us by the ministry of the Word, but
the Lord who is rich in mercy, by the same means does satisfy us, sending his
Spirit, and all his graces to take possession of us for his use, to rule in us,
to thrust down Satan from his Sovereignty, to subdue and mortify our sinful
lusts, so that they shall not hereafter reign in us; which army of graces,
under the conduct of Gods spirit, do no sooner enter, and encounter their
enemies, but presently they put them to the worst, giving them such deadly
wounds in the first conflict that they never recover of them, but languish more
and more, till at last they be wholly abolished.

Quest. What manner of conflict or combat is this?

Answ. Its not corporal, but spiritual, 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5. For as the enemies
are spiritual, so is the fight, by inward lusting and concupiscence, whereby
motions, and inclinations, either good, or evil are stirred up in heart and
soul; and so there is a contrary lusting between these enemies: the flesh
lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, Gal. 5.17.

Quest. What are the ends that the flesh aims at in lusting against the
Spirit?

Answ. First, to stir up and incline us to such lusts, desires, and motions
as James 1.14, 15. its compared to a filthy harlot which entices men to commit
wickedness with her, upon which follows the conception, and birth of sin and
death. Hence also Christ makes it the fountain of all wickedness, Mat. 15.18,
19. But on the contrary the Spirit endeavors to stir up, and cherish good
motions in us, as good meditations in the mind, good resolutions in the will,
and good affections in the heart. So 1 John 2.20. We have received an unction
from God whereby we know all things; and Saint Paul exhorts, 1 These. 5.19.
Quench not the Spirit. Hence David also, Psalm. 16.7. -- My reins also instruct
me in the night season, i. e. those sweet meditations and motions which the
Spirit secretly puts into my mind. So, Isa. 30.21. Thine ears shall hear a
voice behind thee, etc. So, Joh. 16.8, 13.

Gal. 5.17. So that we cannot do the good that we would, and Romans 7.22, 23.
Hence it is that our righteousness is become as a menstruous cloth: and that
our best prayers have need to be perfumed with the sweet odours of Christ's
intercession: but on the contrary the Spirit labors to expel and subdue those
evil motions, and moves us to take the first and best opportunity to serve God:
It also purifies our hearts by faith, and makes us strive against our
infirmities that we may with fervency and cheerfulness perform all holy
services to God: and wherein we come short, it moves us to bewail our
imperfections, and to labor in the use of all good means to attain to greater
perfection: as Paul, 1 Cor. 9.27. and lamentably to complain of it; as Romans
7.23, 24. and to press after the mark, Phil. 3.12. and thus the Spirit at last
masters the flesh; as 1 John 3.9.

Quest. What is the manner of this spiritual conflict in our several faculties
and parts? and that both in our superior and inferior faculties?

Answ. First, our mind being but in part renewed, the relicts of our sinful
corruptions

1. The understanding being in part regenerated, and in part corrupted; partly
enlightened, and partly dark through ignorance, yea, and much depraved also:
Hence there is a conflict maintained betwixt sanctified knowledge, and
spiritual wisdom on the one side, and carnal curiosity, palpable ignorance,
and that wisdom of the flesh that is worldly and devilish on the other part;
curiosity looks after idle speculations and curious questions: But saving
knowledge leaves secret things to God, Deuteronomy. 29.29. Yea, labors to mortify
that idle curiosity; as Romans 12.3. yet rests not in any measure attained, but
labors after spiritual growth till it come to perfection in Christ. Then it
continually conflicteth with palpable ignorance: For we know but in part, etc.
1 Cor. 13.12. yet stands it not at a stay, but endeavors to know as we are
known. Again, spiritual wisdom fights with that wisdom of the world that is
earthly, sensual, and devilish, Jam. 3.15. the one is taken up in spiritual
and heavenly things, counting all things else but dross, and dung, yea loss,
in comparison of them: the other is wholly devoted to earthly and transitory
trifles, and is only delighted in beholding those things whose beauty is
subject to the senses, and to natural reason. Hence, Jer. 4.22. Romans 8.5. 1 Corinthians. 2.14. Matthew. 16.23.

2. The judgment, in which arises another conflict: For so far as the mind
is enlightened with spiritual wisdom and knowledge, the judgment discernes
between truth and falsehood, right, and wrong, etc. allowing and approving the
one, and rejecting and disallowing the other: but so far forth as it still
remains blind, and misled through ignorance, the judgment mistakes error
for truth, and evil for good. Hence, Matthew. 22.29. Eccles. 9.2. Psalm. 73.15.
Act. 10.14, 34, 35. In this conflict they wound one another, and
interchangeably either of them prevail: as for example: Truth, in that part of
the judgment which is regenerate, strikes at error in the unregenerate part,
and gives it a deadly wound? yet oft-times, through the help of subtle
sophistry, and nice distinctions, it recovers strength, and truth gets a foil:
but being again renewed, and confirmed by the light of Gods Word it gives
error a shameful overthrow. From hence it is that the godly learned do so
often differ in judgment in points of religion, viz. because their minds and
judgments are but in part regenerated, so that the relicts of ignorance, and
error do still remain in them, which works in them only a doubtful opinion,
and not any well settled judgment, and this makes them to take that way which
seems most probable. And this difference befalls them not only in the knowledge
of those points of religion which are of less consequence, but also exceeding
weighty, and fundamental, as we see in the example of the Corinthians, and
Galatians, even after the truth of the Gospel had been preached unto them, the
one erring in the doctrine touching the resurrection of the dead, the other in
the maine point of justification by faith in Christ without the works of the
Law.

Obj. But has not the Church a special promise of being enlightened by the
Spirit, and guided into all truth? Joh. 16.13. 1 John 2.^0, 27.

Answ. The like promises are made also to every particular member of the
Church, who notwithstanding may, and sometimes do err in some particulars:
therefore the promise is to be limited.

1. Unto all truth necessary to our salvation. 2. That they shall by the Spirit
receive this privilege, that whereas the wicked continue, and perish in
fundamental errors, the faithful, though they may fall into them, yet they
shall not live and die in them, but shall in Gods good time be reclaimed,
according to that promise, Isa. 30.21.
3. The next conflict which is to be considered in the mind, is between the
actions and operations of it, which like the mind it self, being partly
spiritual, and partly carnal, do continually strive and fight one against
another: and these are our thoughts, meditations, and imaginations, which
labor mutually to expel one another. For when the spirit lifts up our mind in
divine contemplations, causing us to think or meditate on heavenly things, the
service of God, the duties of Christianity, or of our lawful callings, as the
means whereby we may attain unto them: then the flesh pulls them down,
suggesting worldly, or wicked thoughts, or such as are impertinent, and
unseasonable: But the spiritual part finding it self thus defeated, shakes off
those thoughts, and baths it self in the blood of Christ by a lively faith,
whereby it is cleansed from the defilement of them, and up again it mounteth in
spiritual and heavenly meditations, Phil. 3.20. Col. 3.1, 2.

4. There is also a combat between the flesh and spirit in our memories: For
the memory so far as it is regenerate labors to blot out, and deface all
worldly, wicked and sinful impressions, and to have imprinted in it those
spiritual and heavenly instructions which have been committed to its custody by
the sanctified understanding: On the other part the flesh stands in direct
opposition to the Spirit by reprinting and repeating those lessons of impiety
which we had learned in the School of the Devil, and the world, especially
before our conversion, and by working in us a forgetfulness of all good things
whereby th^se heavenly jewels are presently cast out of doors, and cannot abide
with us no more then water in a five.

5. There is the like conflict between the flesh and Spirit in the conscience.
For as it is regenerate, it is so enlightened by the spirit of grace, that like
a true witness, it gives an infallible testimony between God and us, excusing
when we do well to encourage us, and accusing when we do ill that we may
forsake it, and recover our selves by unfeigned repentance. Yea, before our
doing of either of them, it gives in its approbation to that which is good that
we may embrace it, and discovers that which is sinful that we may avoid it. It
plays also the part of a Judge, and according to this true evidence, it either
justifies, or condemns us: From the former whereof arises peace, comfort, and
joy in the holy Ghost for our encouragement in well-doing; and from the other,
either fear, whereby we are restrained from sin, or sorrow not to be repented
of, 2 Cor. 7.10. after we are fallen. But on the contrary, the conscience as
unregenerate, is blinded with ignorance, or corrupted with malice, and
therefore always ready to play the part of a false witness, either coloring
over our sins with deceitful colors, that we may commit it, or excusing it,
when its committed as venial, or none at all that we may continue in it: Or on
the other side, it accuses when we do well in Gods service, or in the use of
our Christian liberty about things indifferent to raise in our minds
superstitious fears, or causeless doubts, that being affrighted we may be
hindered in our Christian duties, or discouraged when we have done them. It
plays also the false Judge, condemning where God and a good conscience
justifies, and justifying where they condemn: which false sentence is the
cause of carnal security, when we continue in sin, and of needless fears, when
we are careful to perform our duty: Yet if at any time that sentence be
reversed by the good conscience enlightened by the word and spirit, and the
ugliness of sin be discovered, then the corrupt part of conscience, which
before seemed senseless, being thus awakened, fills the mind with loud cries,
and grievous accusations, and hideous fears, and now as eagerly moved to
despair, as it did before to security, and presumption, telling us that our
sins are unpardonable, and that its too late to repent; But then again the good
conscience silenceth it, and quiets the fury of it, by witnessing to us that
our hearts are upright, though we have been overtaken, and have fallen through
infirmity: or at least, by bathing it self from the filth of sin in the
precious blood of Christ, which is sufficient to purge us even from
presumptuous sins, it thereby quiets our hearts again.

worldly, sensual and devilish, neglects and refuses the present comforts of
grace, which it relisheth not, and the future hopes of heavenly happiness,
which it knows not, and chooses this present world with the vain honors,
and uncertain riches, and sinful pleasures of it, because they are subject to
the senses, and may be had in present possession: and in this conflict,
sometimes the one, and sometimes the other prevails, and causes the adverse
party to give ground. So, Romans 7.15* etc.

Thirdly, having seen the conflict between the flesh and the spirit in the
understanding and will severally, come we now to that conflict which is in
them, being jointly considered: as between faith, and infidelity on the one
hand, and vain presumption on the other: and this is referred to both these
faculties, because as the least degrees of faith are chiefly in the will, so
the highest degrees of it are in the understanding. For after the Law has
brought a man to the sight and sense of his sins, of the punishment due to
them, and of his utter inability to get out of this forlorn condition: and that
the Gospel has discovered to him that Christ was sent into the world by his
blood to purge us from the guilt and punishment of our sins, and by his
righteousness and obedience to justify sinners; then the Spirit of God
assisting the Ministry of the Word, works thereby in his heart some earnest
desires to be made partaker of Christ, and these benefits which we call
hungring, and thirsting after his righteousness, and this is the first degree
of justifying Faith, and not only a preparation to it: For they are pronounced
blessed, who thus hunger and thirst after righteousness, Matthew. 5.6. but there
is no blessedness to those who are in the state of infidelity. Then there is
wrought in his will a firm resolution to choose Christ alone for his Savior,
and to rely upon him only for his salvation, which is the second degree of
true faith, unto which when a Christian has attained by the lively and
experimental feeling of Gods love in his Ordinances, of the virtue and power of
Christ's death and resurrection for the mortifying of his sins, and the renewing
and quickening him in all saving graces; and lastly, by his daily walking with
God in the works of holiness and righteousness, and that sweet communion he
has with him in spiritual exercises, he gro^s from one degree of Faith to
another, till at last he attains to a full persuasion of Gods love, the
remission of his sins, and of his own salvation: But yet the f^esh, and relicts
of corruption, even when we have attained to the greatest perfection, as in the
part regenerate there is full, and certain persuasion, so in the unregenerate
part there dwells doubting, infidelity, and vain presumption, which continually
assault one another, sometimes the one, and sometimes the other prevailing, and
getting the victory, although in the conclusion Faith always overcomes: So we
see in the example of Abraham, and Sarah, Heb. 11.11. Romans 4.19. of Peter* Mat.
14.30. The Father of the possessed child, Lord, I believe, help my unbeleif,
Job, Chapter 31.3. and 6.4. and 7.20. and 13.15. and 19.25. So in David, Psalm.
42.6. and 73.13. and 77.10. and 23.4. and 31.23. and 46.2.

Having seen the conflict between the flesh and Spirit in the superior
faculties of the soul, come we now to it in the inferour, seated in the heart
of man.

Quest. What is the conflict between them in the affections, and sensual
appetite?

Answ. Though these be no more corrupt then the other, yet the corruption in
them is more sensible, and though the conflict be no more dangerous, yet (...)
much more turbulent, and violent. For as outward objects move, and affect the
senses, and there the heart, and affections, so they being thus moved, do move
the will, and the will draws also the judgment, and understanding* But though
these sensual faculties are more grossly poisoned, and therefore seem more
desperately incurable; Yet the spirit of God working also upon these parts,
does purge them from their contagious humors, and comforts the heart with such
spiritual cordials, and strengthens it with such heavenly antidotes, that
spiritual health is in some measure recovered: yet is there a continual
combat in the heart and affections, as they are renewed, and sanctified, and
as they remain corrupt, and unregenerate: For the heart of stone striveth with
the fleshly heart, rebellion with obedience, corruption with grace, and whilst
the spirit draws the heart to God, and heavenly, and spiritual things, the
flesh pulls it back, and labors to keep it still fixed on the earth, and
worldly vanities. Hence springs a continual conflict between the affections,
and passions, wherein sometimes the same affections being divided between
grace, and corruption do strive against themselves, and sometimes being cross
matched, do mutually oppose other affections, and passions which are opposite
to them: Thus the love of God, of spiritual, and heavenly things, is assaulted
with self-love, and love of the world, and hatred of those divine excellencies:
Affiance in God, his promises and providence, with confidence in the Creature,
and diffidence in Almighty God: Zeal of Gods glory, with carnal, and blind
zeal: The fear of God, with the fear of men: Hope in God, with earthly hopes,
and also with presumption, and despair: Sorrow for sin, with worldly sorrow,
and carnal security: Joy in the Holy Ghost, and spiritual rejoicing in God,
with carnal joy in the pleasures of sin, and moderate grief for worldly
losses, etc.

Quest. What are the effects which this conflict between the flesh, and spirit
produces in us?

Answ. The effects are either such as it produces in the will, and desires, or
in the works and actions.

Quest. What are the effects which it produces in the will, and desires?

Answ. From this conflict between the flesh and Spirit, arising from the
imperfection of our regeneration, this effect is wrought in the man regenerate,
that he cannot with full consent of will, either choose, and embrace, or
refuse, and reject either good or evil, because being partly regenerate, and
partly unregenerate, his will is divided, and accordingly does at the same time
both choose, and refuse both the good, and the evil. For when the regenerate
will would do that which is good, or avoid rhat which is evil, the
unregenerate part strugleth, and hinders, and when this would embrace the
evil, and refuse the good, the regenerate part resists and opposes. And
this is that which the Apostle Paul complains of, Romans 7.21, 23. And hence
arises a notable difference between the sins of the godly, and the wicked: for
though they be all one in respect of the act, and deed done, yet they are not
so in respect of the agent, and manner of doing. For the regenerate man cannot
commit any known sin with full consent of will, but there is a reluluctancy
against it, not only in his conscience, but in his heart, will, and affections,
and consequently it resists the motions of the flesh, nilling that which it
wills; and if through frailty it be overcome, yet it hates, and detesteth
that sin with which it is taken captive, and makes a Christian much displeased
with himself, because he has committed it. So we see in David, who though by
the flesh he was drawn, not only to will, but to commit some grievous sins, yet
he truly says of himself, that his heart hated every false way, etc. Psalm.
119.104. But the unregenerate man, though sometimes he has some pangs of
conscience checking him for his sins, that he cannot securely sleep in them,
yet he likes, and loves them with all his heart. etc.

Quest. What are the effects that this conflict produces in the actions, and
works?

Answ. The effects which it works in the actions of a regenerate man are
diverse: as

First, He cannot do the evil at all times which the flesh chooses: Thus
Joseph refused the wicked suit of his whorish Mistress, Genesis 39.9.

Secondly, He cannot commit sin as the wicked do, with full consent of John
3.9. He that is borne of God sins not, etc.

Thirdly, He cannot walk in the way of sinners, but propounds to himself

And on the contrary, by reason of this conflict, the regenerate man cannot do
the good he would, and desires, Gal. 5.17. Romans 7.15, 18. For when he would
run his Christian race, sin encompasseth, and presses him down, Heb. 12.1. and
makes him either sit still, or move slowly. Hence it is that our best obedience
is so imperfect, that were it not covered with Christ's perfect obedience, and
our pollutions washed in his blood, we could never be accepted with God. The
consideration whereof should move us to work out our salvation with fear, and
trembling, 1 Cor. 10.12. Phil. 2.12. To keep a narrow watch over our hearts,
Prove. 4.23. Heb. 3.13. It should make us to complain with Paul, Romans 7.23. and
to pray fervently for Gods assistance, Prove. 4.23. Heb. 12.13.

Quest. But seeing that in the carnal man there is a fight, or skirmish, which
has some appearance of the spiritual conflict, how shall we be able to
distinguish b^twixt them?

Answ. They differ in many things: as

First, In their ground, and cause from whence they arise: For the spiritual
conflicts arises from the grace of regeneration, and sanctification, whereby
Gods Romans 2.15. The will likewise retains a kind of freedom, not only about
things materially evil, but such also as are natural, civil, and merely
moral, though herein also it be very weak, and corrupt, and defective: and
these relicts common to all, are in some, raised much higher by the common
gifts of the spirit, and civil graces which are conferred more largely upon
some then upon others; But there being mingled in all these faculties,
abundance of corruptions also, and many of them in the special kinds, one
contrary to another, hence arises this war between them: Like thieves, who all
agree together, to rob a true man, but fall out among themselves, when they
come to divide the spoil. Thus the understanding enlightened by nature, or
common grace, discerns in particular actions what is good, and to be chosen,
and what is evil, and to be shunned, informs the conscience accordingly, and
leaves it to its censure, and determination either to approve for doing good,
or to condemn for doing evil, upon which censures sometimes the will is incited
to embrace that which the conscience allows, and refuse that which it
condemns, but other sometimes being transported with its own sinful
corruption, and overswayed with the violence of the inferior will, carnal
appetite, and unruly passions it hearkens unto them, and stops the ears to
reason, and Conscience: So we see in Laban, though reason and conscience told
him that he ought to use Jacob well, and to reward him richly for his service,
because for his sake the Lord had blessed all that he had, yet his will being
corrupted, and his affections wholly carried away with the love of the world,
he changed his wages ten times. So Pharaoh in his dealing with Israel, Exodus
9.27, 34. Thus Saul with David, 1 Samuel 24.17. and Pilate with Christ.





Fourthly, They differ in their contrary effects. For by the conflict between
of Gods wrath, and those dreadful punishments which sin has deserved.

2. From the combat of the flesh and Spirit, unfeigned repentance is begun,

3. The war between the Spirit and the flesh causes the most secure peace,
even peace with God, when as becoming his Soldiers we fight undet his Standard

4. The conflict between the Spirit and the flesh makes the regenerate man with
more care, and diligence to observe his own heart, to watch over all his Cor.
9.27. But the conflict of Conscience is commonly joined with wretchless
security, whereby the unregenerate man carelessly neglects the causes, and
occasions of this bitter conflict till he be overtaken with them, and only
avoids the punishment but not the sin, or the sin only when he is sensible of
the punishment. It works in him no care to mortify his sins, unless only in
outward act, and that also out of a slavish fear, and not in love and obedience
unto God. It makes him not careful to use means for the subduing of the flesh,
yea rather it brings him into a sluggish despair, as if all means were
useless, or if he use any means, its only in hypocrisy, to stop the cry of
his Conscience, not with a desire to profit by them.

Fifthly, They differ in the subject matter, or occasion about which this
conflict Romans 7.18, 21. And on the contrary the Spirt opposes the Flesh in all
known evil, either by restraining from falling into evil, or being fallen, to
rise again by repentance.



Quest. Whether is this conflict between the flesh and Spirit, in all the
regenerate?

Answ. It is in all the regenerate that have received Spiritual illumination,
and have the use of reason, and understanding, being possessed of Gods
sanctifying graces, not only in the habits thereof, but in their acts, and
operations.

Quest. What are we to think of infants, and idiots?

Answ. Such of them as belong to Gods Election, he works in them for their
justification, and sanctification after an extraordinary, secret, and
wonderful manner, applying Christ to them, his righteousness, obedience, and
virtue of his death, and resurrection by his holy Spirit, who all-sufficiently
supplies unto them the defect of all inferior instruments, and means, and
hereby purges them from the guilt, punishment, and corruption of their sins.
Now in these there cannot actually be this conflict, because they have not the
acts and operations of spiritual graces, but only the seeds of them: yet even
in them, through spiritual regeneration, there may be some kind of conflict
between the Spirit and the flesh, the seed of grace, and of corruption striving
one against another. But this is meant of Elect Infants dying in their infancy.

Quest. Whether is this conflict in all the regenerate in like manner, and
measure?

Answ. It is not, but diversely as it pleases the Lord to glorify himself in
the manifestation of his wisdom, goodness, and omnipotency, either by giving
his servants a greater measure of strength, and grace, whereby they obtain an
easy victory, or a scanter proportion of it, by which notwithstanding they
shall as certainly, though not so speedily overcome, showing his greater power
in their greatest weakness, 2 Cor. 12.9.

Quest. Is not this conflict sometimes weak in strong Christians?

Answ. Yes, for sometimes through pride, and self-love, they are apt to forget
themselves, and being swollen up in their own conceits, to rob God of his glory,
by arrogating some part of the praise of their spiritual strength, and
victories to themselves, whereupon the Lord leaves them by spiritual
desertions unto their own abilities, and lets loose their enemies to assault
them; In which case they are utterly unable to stand in the least conflict, but
are shamefully foiled, and led captive of sin, as we see in the example of
Noah, Lot, Job, David, Peter, etc. and then being discouraged, they complain
with Job, Chap. 6.4. That God opposes them as a mighty enemy, etc. and with
David, Psalm. 22.1. and 77.7, 8. and with the Church, Isa. 63.17. and 64.9. and
then the flesh proudly swells, and triumphs over the Spirit, saying, Is this
the man that took God for his hope; But though God has withdrawn himself a
little, that the spiritual man might the more earnestly seek him, yet does he
not utterly forsake his servants, and his graces in them, which though they
seem extinct, yet are they but in a swoon, and therefore when the Lord blows
upon them again by his Spirit, then they recover their former strength, and the
Christian Champian being grieved, and ashamed for his former foil, with more
then wonted valor assaults his enemies, and puts them to flight, obtaining the
victory, and ever after hold them under more base subjection.

Quest. What is the success of this conflict between the Flesh and the Spirit?

Answ. The success is twofold, the first whereof is the repulses, and foils
which the Spirit suffers through the malice, and fury of the flesh: the second
is of the victory, and triumph of the spirit over it. The first is temporary,
and lasts only for a time: The second is permanent and everlasting.

Quest. What is considerable about the first?

Answ. That the Spirit is often foiled in this combat, when as by the
subtilty, or violence of the flesh, its hindered in its course of godliness, and
allured, or forcibly drawn to the committing of sin: of which St. Paul
complains, Romans 7.21, 22. and this happens either through the weakness of the
spirit, or want of watchfulness, and Spiritual care to get the whole Armor of
God close buckled to us: of which foils there follow three notable effects.

1. Unfeigned and bitter sorrow for our slips and falls. So Isai. 63.17.

2. An earnest desire to rise again, to be delivered from the bondage of the
flesh, and having gotten the victory, to keep it under for the time to come. So
Romans 7.24.

3. Having obtained the victory, an use of all good means to be preserved from
all such foiles for the time to come; For which end he 1. Keeps a narrow watch
over all his ways, especially over his heart, wherein the flesh hides his
chiefest ambushments, not readily satisfying every desire of profit, and
delight, but first examining them by the rule of Gods Word, whether they be to
be embraced, or rejected. 2. He will be most careful to comfort, and
strengthen the spiritual part, to keep the Armor of God close buckled to him,
and to be well provided of weapons before the conflict. 3. He will show the
like care in weakening his enemy the flesh, by withdrawing from it the chiefest
weapons, whereby it has formerly prevailed.


4. The regenerate man after his falls will more zealously hate his sin then
ever formerly, avoiding and flying from it: yea, the oftener he has fallen into
it, the more he hates it.

5. After his foils, and falls, he will carefully perform all holy duties which
are contrary to his former sins: Redeeming his lost time by his future
diligence.

Quest. How far may the flesh prevail against the Spirit?

Answ. For resolving of this doubt, we must first distinguish between the gifts
of the Spirit, and the persons in whom they are, the gifts may be considered
both in their kind, and in their quality.

First, Concerning the former, the gifts and graces of the Spirit are either
common to the regenerate, and unregenerate, or proper and peculiar to the elect
alone. The common graces are especially those morrall virtues of Wisdom,
Justice, Fortitude, Temperance, Patience, etc. which may not only be lost, and
quite extinguished in civil men, but also in the faithful, because they are
not essential to a Christian, but rather ornaments, then part of the
spiritual man: So in David when he feigned himself mad, and in the matter of
Bathsheba, and in his unjust sentence against Mephibosheth. Thus Noah lost his
temperance: Lot his chastity: Jeremy, and Jonah, their patience, etc. But as
for those sanctifying graces, proper, and peculiar to them, and essential to a
Christian, being once had, they can never be lost, notwithstanding all the
power and malice of the Devil, and the flesh. For Romans 11.19. the gifts, and
calling of God are without repentance* So also Joh. 10.28.

Matthew. 35.29. From him that has not shall be taken away even that which he
has, with Luke. 8.18.

Quest. But may not true sanctifying, and saving graces in the regenerate be
utterly killed, or at least for a time quenched?

Answ. First, As some seeming graces in the unregenerate may be quite lost,
Matthew. 25.29. To him that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance. So
Joh. 15.2. Every branch in me that bears fruit, shall be purged, etc. Yet may
they seemingly loose those graces which they keep in truth: as for example,
they may seemingly loose their saving knowledge, when through the relicts of
ignorance, they fall into some gross Errors, Heresies, or Schisms. They may
seemingly loose their faith, when being violently assaulted by temptations, it
receives some grievous foils, and lies covered under incredulity, as fire under
ashes, or the Sun under a cloud: They may seem to loose repentance, when they
are overtaken afresh by their old sins: especially when after they are
cleansed, they relapse into gross sins, not only through ignorance, but
wittingly against knowledge, and Conscience, etc. yet these saving graces are
not lost, but only hid, and covered for a time.

Secondly, Other graces which spring from those which are fundamental, and
Job, who thought God his Enemy. So David complains, Psalm. 22.1. and 51.8, 10,
11, 12. and 88. Yet in these intermissions the true Christian has restless
longings after the sense, and feeling of renewed graces, and shows as much
fervency of affection, and intireness of love toward them by his bitter
mourning for their absence, as he formerly did in his joy, and rejoicing in
their presence.

Job, David, Peter, the Galatians, and the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, Rev.
2.4. and of Sardis, Rev. 3.2. yea these graces may not only be shrewdly shaken,
but cast into a dead swoune, in which they will appear, neither to others, nor
to them that have them: But yet all this is to be understood of their
functions, and operations, which may decay in their degrees: but as for the
habits of these graces, they never decay in Gods Children, not so much as in
their degrees, but grow continually till they come to their full stature:
whence they are said to be Trees of righteousness of Gods own planting, Psalm.
1.3. Isa. 61.3. and Gods building, Psalm. 92.14. and Gods Children who grow till
they come to perfect age, Ephesians. 4.13, 14, 15. and their graces are Fountains
of living water which flow continually, Isa. 58.11. Hence the path of the just
is compared to the morning light, etc. Prove. 4.18.

Object. But did not David loose degrees of his grace, when he committed
adultery, and murder? and Peter when he denied his Master?

Answ. There was a decay, yea an utter surceasing of them for the time, till
they were renewed by repentance, yet not in the habits, and essence of their
graces, but only in their operations: as the Sun ever shines in his full
brightness, though its often hid from our sight. Yet we must not ascribe this
permanency of their graces, to any property, or excellency which Gods Children
have in themselves, as if by their own strength they could withstand all
tentations, but it is to be ascribed to the power, and promises of God, to our
union with Christ, from whom we receive Spiritual nourishment, and to the
continual gracious assistance of our good God, who supports us against all the
powers of Hell.

Object. But by this Doctrine many will take occasion to become presumptuous,
and secure?

Ans. So is the Doctrine of Justification through Gods free grace by faith
obeyed, yea Gods mercy, redemption by Christ, and all the promises of the
Gospel: For where the Apostle taught, Romans 3.7, 8. and 6.1. where sin abounds,
grace abounds much more; Some were ready to say, Let us then sin that grace may
abound: But its not possible that any sound Christian who has these graces
should abuse what has been said to presumption, and security: For though they
cannot loose their graces, yet they may loose peace, comfort, joy, etc. which
is the very life of their lives, in which state they are full of horror, and
before they can purchase their former peace, they must pass through the
purgatory of repentance, send out deep sighs, and bitter groans, etc. which
will make them more wary ever after, even as long as they live, Phil. 2.13.

Quest. What is the second thing considerable in the success of this conflict?

Answ. That the Spirit always obtains an assured victory over the flesh: For
though it be often weakened, yet it cannot be wholly vanquished, but still
recovers strength whereby it prevails, and puts the flesh to flight, though it
recieves many wounds* and falls in the fight* the reason is, because Christ
holds us by the right hand, and bids us fight without fear, Isa. 40.10, 11, 12.
and 42.6. yea he has inseparatly united us to himself by his holy Spirit, Joh.
10.28. and made us lively members of his body, and therefore being able to
defend us, he will never suffer us to perish* for then his own body should
receive a maime.

Oject. But we see many Christians, who both in their own judgment, and in the
judgment of others are members of Christ, yet quite fall away, and become
members of Satan?

Answ. The Members of Christ, generally so called, are of two sorts:

1. Such lively Members as are inseparably united to him by his holy Spirit,
and a lively faith, which neither the Devil, nor the Flesh, nor any other power
can pluck away from him.

2. Such as are improperly called Christ's members, being dead, and fruitless,
and only so in outward profession, and these may fail, and be quite severed
from Christ, but this does not prove that the true members of Christ may
perish, for they can never be parted from Christ in respect of their spiritual
union, because Gods Spirit which is the chief band of it, can never fail,
Hosa. 2.19. Jer. 31.34.

Quest. By what degrees does the Spirit obtain the victory?

Answ. First, in this life, in which this conquest over the flesh is but
inchoate, not only in our first conversion, when we are but babes in Christ,
but even through the whole course of our lives: yet still for the most part the
issue of it is the victory of the Spirit, though it meets with many foils in
the fight, Romans 8.1. where it appears that whatsoever his slips, and Errors may
be, yet for the most part he holds on in his Christian course unto the end.

Tim. 4.8. Rev. 3.21.

Quest. What arguments may encourage us to this conflict against the flesh?

Answ. To the obtaining of this victory there are two things required.



Secondly, A wise and valorous behavior in the fight itself.

Quest. What is required in the preparation to the fight.

Answ. First, A serious consideration of those Arguments which may put courage
into us, and make us resolute in assaulting this Enemy.

Secondly, A right use of certain means which may enable us to overcome.

Quest. What are the reasons which may encourage us to set upon this enemy the
flesh.

Answ. First, Because its the will of our great Captain, the Lord of Hosts,
that we should encounter it, to which he often, and earnestly presses us to
yield obedience by his command, that we should fight against the world, and the
Devil: as first, that we should depose it from its regency, Romans 6.12. that we
should not satisfy it, Gal. 5.16. that we should utterly renounce it, Tit.
2.11, 12. that we should put it off, Ephesians. 4.22. yea mortify it, Col. 3.5.
crucify it, or put it to a shameful death, Gal. 5.24. there is a gracious
promise to such, Romans 8.13.

Secondly, Let the necessity of this fight encourage us to it, seeing we have
no Prodigal feed with filthy Swine, then to become slaves to these sensual,
and more filthy lusts. Now how unworthy is this our being, and breeding, who by
our creation were sons, and children of God, to yield our selves slaves to such
cruel Masters, who will make us employ our bodies, and minds which were created
for Gods service, in the miserable bondage of sin, and Satan? But besides the
hatefulness of the flesh for its cruel tyranny, its more odious for its
pollution, and filthiness: for there is no filthy sink, or stinking carrion to
be compared to it.

Thirdly, The consideration of the manifold evils which are done unto us by
greatest outrages that were ever committed in the world may challenge the flesh
as their chief cause and author, and shall we have any peace, or truce with
such a vile, and malicious enemy? It was it that pierced Christ's hand and feet,
that thrust the spear into his side; that put him into that agony in the
Garden, and upon the cross, etc. which moves men daily to crucify him afresh,
and to trample his precious blood under their filthy feet: and can we find in
our heart to have peace with such an Enemy to our Savior? Its also the cause
of all our punishments, and miseries in this life, whether inward, or outward,
and lastly of death it self, and everlasting damnation.

Lastly, consider that if we maintain the fight against it, we shall be sure

Quest. What are the means whereby we may be enabled to overcome the flesh?

Answ. They are principally two.

First, We must take unto us, and put upon us the whole Armor of God. The
Ephesians. 6.13, etc. And herein we must be sure not to put it on by piecemeal
(for death may enter by one place unarmed) but we must be Armed Cap a pe: at
all points, that all being covered, none may be endangered.

2. We must be persuaded not to trust in our own strength, but in the power of
Gods might; nor in the weapons themselves, which in themselves are too weak to
bear the mighty blows of our Spiritual Enemies, but in the promises of God,
which assure us of the victory, and in his gracious assistance, which we are
daily to beg by prayer, and by which alone we shall be enabled to get the
victory.

Secondly, We must carefully observe, and put in practice diverse Rules fit for

Quest. What are those Rules?

Answ. They are of two sorts: For they either tend to the weakening, and
subduing of the flesh, or to the strengthening of the Spirit.

Quest. Which are those that tend to the weakening of the flesh?

Answ. They also are of two kinds; As first, that we withdraw, and withhold
from the Flesh all means whereby it may gather strength.

2. That we use the contrary means whereby it may be weakened.

Quest. What is observable concerning the form^r?

Answ. Its the care of all that are to fight against potent Enemies, to deal
with them as the Philistines did with Sampson: curiously to search wherein
their chief strength lies, and then to use all means to disable, and deprive
them of it, which course must also be held by us in this conflict with the
flesh: For which end

First, We must not nourish and strengthen this our Enemy: we must not feed our
flesh with sinful pleasures, and carnal delights, nor give it ease, and
contentment

Secondly, When the flesh would take its liberty whether we will or no, we
part, and make it live in miserable bondage. Hence Cyril says, Si carnem
nutriatis, and ipsam frequenti molitie, ac jugi deliciarum fluxu foveatis,
insolescet necessario adversus spiritum, and fortior illo efficitur. It fares
with the flesh, and Spirit, as with two mortal enemies in the field: For he
that by any means aids, and strengthens the one, does thereby make way for the
vanquishing of the other. There are (says one) two committed by God to thy
custody, a Nobleman and a Slave, on this condition, that thou should feed
the Slave like a Captive with bread and water, and entertain the Nobleman with
all provision befitting his dignity.

Object. But what passages must we stop to keep back provision from the flesh?

Answ. The provision which we are to withold from it, are all the means
whereby it may be nourished, and enabled to resist the Spirit, and seeing the
flesh is resident in all the parts, and powers of our bodies, and souls, we
must therefore use our best endeavor to keep from our corrupt minds all
sinful cogitations, and from our phansies all vain imaginations: we must not
entertain ungodly counsels, pernicious errors, and false Doctrines, but cut
them off when they are approaching, and cast them out when they are entered: And
on the contrary, we must furnish our minds in the regenerate part with holy
thoughts, and divine meditations, with Religious counsels, wholesome
instructions, and pure Doctrine out of Gods Word, Col. 3.3. So must we keep our
Consciences free from sin, and purge them daily from dead works, that they may
serve the living God, Heb. 9.14. endeavoring to keep them pure, peaceable, and
tender: we must keep, or blot out of our memories the remembrance of sinful
pleasures, unless it be to repent of them, ribald speeches, profane jests,
injuries received, with a purpose of revenge, with all other lessons of impiety
imprinted in them either by Satan, the World, or our own corruptions, and
engrave in them all holy lessons which have been taught us out of the Word. We
must preserve our hearts from all unlawful lusts, wicked desires, unruly
passions, and ungodly affections: especially from covetousness, ambition, and
carnal pleasures, and labor to have them fixed on spiritual and heavenly
things, and to have them wholly taken up, and constantly possessed with
sanctified affections, and holy desires; we must keep out from our appetite
intemperance, and all desires of excess, and nourish in it temperance,
sobriety, modesty, and chastity. We must keep our tongues from all corrupt
communication, 1 Pet. 5.8, 9. our ears from ungodly discourses, our eyes from
wanton objects, and lastly our bodies from sloth, and idleness, effeminate
delicacy, excessive sleep, and all manner of sinful pleasures, and on the
contrary entertain watchfulness, sobriety, etc. and when being two full fed, it
begins to be wanton, we must keep it under with fasting, and painful labor.

Quest. What principal sins be there which most strengthen the flesh, which
must especially be watched against?

Answ. First, Ignorance of God and his will, whereby the eyes of our
understanding

Secondly, Infidelity, which nourishes the flesh in all impiety, whilst
neither

Thirdly, Security, impenitency, and hardness of heart, which mightily

Fourthly, Especially take heed of the love of the world, and setting our
affections Jam. 5.5. 1 John 2.15. For this weakens the Spirit, and quenches
all good motions, which would cross us in the fruition of this momentary
vanities of honor, riches, and pleasures, and roots out of our heart the love
of God, from whence spings all true obedience: and thrusts us headlong into
noisome tentations, and all manner of sins which promise to us the satisfying
of our earthly desires. Hence, 2 Timothy 2.4. we must not entangle our selves in
the affairs of this life, etc. If we will have Heaven for our home, we must
have our conversation there, whilst our commoration is in the world, Phil.
3.20. So, Col. 3.1, 2. we must therefore fly covetousness, 1 Timothy, 6.9, 10. Its
the root of all evil, etc. So al^o we must avoid voluptuousness, surfeiting
and drunkenness, chambering and wantonness, sloth and idleness: for the more we
pamper the body, the more we pine the soul: as we see in Noah, Lot, David, etc.
Hence Gregory says, Sicut carne qu^escente spiritus deficit, ita ea laborante
convalescit: as the flesh enjoying rest, the Spirit faints, so the flesh
being sick, the Spirit enjoyes health.

Quest. Is it enough to restrain the flesh from things unlawful?

Answ. No, but we must also moderate it in the use of such things as are
lawful: yea there must not only be a sober, and moderate use of meats, and
drinks, and carnal delights, but sometimes also a total abstinence from them
for the bette^ taming of the flesh: Solus in illicitis non cadit, qui se
aliquando and a licitis caute resting it, says Gregory, He only falls not in
things unlawful, who sometimes warily restrains himself from those which are
lawful. And St. Austin tells us, Qui a nullis refrenat licitis, vicinus est and
illicitis: He that refrains from no lawful delights, is in the next
neighborhood to those which are unlawful.

Quest. Is there not also another extreme to be avoided?

Answ. Yea, we must not destroy the body whilst we endeavor to tame the
flesh: nor hurt, or kill our friend, whilst we make war against our enemy; as
when by watchings, fastings, etc. we so weaken our bodies, that thereby we make
them unfit for any good duties: Hence Gregory, Saepe dum in illo hostem
in^equimur, etiam civem quem, diligimus, trucidamus Often times whilst in these
thing we pursue an ha^ed enemy, we do unawares kill a beloved friend.

Quest. What other Rule are we to observe for the subdoing of the Flesh?

Answ. We must spoil this our Enemy of its Armor, and Weapons wherewith it
fights against us, as the Philistines did the Isra^lites.

Quest. What are these weapons?

Answ. Those fiery Lusts, and darts of tentations wherewith the flesh
encounters us, and draws us to commit sin either in thought, word, or actions,
of which we are to deprive the flesh by taking away the matter whereof they are
made, and all occasions, and means of them: Or if we cannot do this, we are to
endeavor to wring these Weapons out of our Enemies hands, and to turn the
point of them against himself by taking occasion from these tentations to
perform some holy duty contrary thereto. As when it encounters us with wicked
thoughts, take occasion thereby to fix upon heavenly meditations: when it
provokes to corrupt speeches, take occasion to utter some wholesome speech:
when it tempts to evil actions, be more forward to all religious duties, and
more zealous of good works: Or if we cannot wring these weapons out of the
fleshes hands, we must look the better to get on the whole Christian Armor,
especially the shield of Faith, and sword of the Spirit, that by the one we may
bea^ off these fiery darts, and by the other we may beat back our enemies: and
have an eye on which side thine enemy strikes at thee: whether on the right
side with tentations of prosperity, or on the left with tentations of
adversity, whether it assaults thy head with errors, and heresies, or thy
heart with unlawful lusts: Thine eyes with wanton objects, or thine ears with
corrupt speeches, and against all these oppose the shield of Faith for thy
security, 1 Pet. 5.8, 9.

Quest. What other means must we use to secure us against this Enemy?

Answ. First, We must keep a narrow watch over our selves, and over our

Tim, 4.5. watch thou in all things: and this watch must be kept not only in
things in their own nature evil, but even in indifferent things, that we abuse
not our Christian liberty to sin: yea, in those actions which are in their own
nature good, that we may do them in a good manner, and for a right end: So
Christ exhorts in hearing, Luke 8.18. So in prayer we must watch against roving
thoughts: and in giving alms against hypocrisy, Matthew. 6.4.

Thirdly, We must keep this watch over all the parts and faculties of out
bodies Job 31.1. and because our own providence is not sufficient to secure us,
we must pray with David, Psalm. 119.37. Turn away mine eyes from beholding
vanity. We must also watch over our ears, and take heed of what we hear: and
how we hear: for evil words will corrupt good manners, 1 Cor. 15.33. So over
our tongues, our taste, our appetite, as Solomon advises, Prove. 23.2. Put a
knife to thy throat, Otherwise we shall be like a City whose walls are broken
down, and therefore becoms an easy prey to an enemy, Prove. 25.28.

Fourthly, Especially we must keep a strict watch over our tongues which the
David promises, Psalm. 39.1. and this we must do the rather,

1. Because God requires it, Psalm. 34.13. Keep thy tongue from evil, etc.

2. Because of that power and potency which is in the tongue to draw us to
good, or evil, life, or death, as Prove. 18.21. and 13.3. and 21.23.

3. The natural maliciousness in this little member should make us watch over
it the more heedfully: For Psalm. 52.4. Its a sharp razor, etc. Romans 3.13. Jam.
3.5, 6, 7, 8. It an unruly evil, Jam. 3.2. and Christian perfection consists
in well ordering of the tongue, Jam. 1.26. Now in this our watch we are to keep
our tongues from impious words against the Majesty of God, as blaspheming his
name, profaning his Word and Ordinances, scorning his works: as also from
dishonest, and unjust speeches, which tend to the prejudice of our neighbors,
Ephesians. 4.25. Levit. 19.16. and Saint James gives a reason for it, Jam. 4.11.
such speak evil of the Law, and judge the Law: viz by doing that which the
Law condemns*

2. We must refrain from idle speeches, and consequently from much speaking,
wherein there is much vanity, Prove. 10.19. Considering that we must be
accountable for every idle word, Matthew. 12.36.

Fifthly, But above all other parts, we must guard our hearts, as Solomon
advises, Prove. 4.23. and that

1. Because of all other parts its most crafty, and deceitful, Jer. 17.9.

2. Because it is the Chief Commander in this little world of man, ruling all
other parts: Its their guide and Captain that directs all their courses: Its the
Spring and Fountain of all our thoughts, words, and actio^, Luke 8.45. Mat.
15.18, 19. and 19.18. therefore it much concerns us at all times, in all
places, and companies, and imploiments, whether about the service of God, or
conversing with men, or alone, to keep our hearts pure, holy, sober, and
righteous, least they being corrupted, mislead all our other powers, and parts,
and seeing we cannot do this of our selves, we are continually to pray to the
Lord who has our hearts in his hands, that he will rule and guide them, that
so with themselves, all our other faculties may be brought into subjection to
him: that he will cause them to love what he loves, and to hate what he hates,
as Psalm. 119.36. and 141.3. and 51.10. and 86.11.

Sixthly, We must keep this watch in our spiritual Armor, especially we must
use the shield of Faith, and the sword of the Spirit to assault the flesh, and
Sword of the Spirit against each particular lust* As when the flesh would
withdraw us from the service of God, and engage us to the service of Satan, and
the world, we must resist it with that Text, Exodus 20.3. wherein we are bound
to worship, and serve God, and that we are redeemed for that end, Deuteronomy. 6.13.
Matthew. 4.10. Luke 1.74. when it moves us to neglect good works, remember,
Ephesians. 2.10. that we are created for this end. when it persuades to defer
repentance, remember, Eccles. 12.1. Psalm. 95.7, 8. when it would provoke us to
love of the world, remember, Jam. 4.4. 1 John 2.15. 1 Pet. 5.5. when it tempts
us to pride, remember, Prove. 29.23. and 18.12. God resists the proud, etc.
when it tempts to covetousness, remember, 1 Timothy 6.6, 10. Heb. 13.5.

Quest. What other Rules must be observed by those that would subdue the flesh?

Answ. First, We must resist it in all the occasions that it takes, and means
which it uses to prevail against us, and see that with equal care we avoid and
shun Paul, Ephesians. 5.4. having forbidden Fornication, etc. forbids the naming of
them, together with filthy, and foolish talking, and scurrilous jesting, which
are means to provoke to those sins, as we see in David, Achan, Ahab, etc.
Hence, Prove. 13.20. A companion of fools shall be destroyed, and Psalm. 119.115.
Away from me (says David) ye wicked, I will keep the Commandments of my God:
Hence also, Ephesians. 5.11.

2. We must withstand the first beginnings of sin, and labor to quench our
fiery lusts when they are first kindled in us, 1 These. 5.22. Abstain from all
appearance of evil: and St. Jude advised, that we should be so far from
entertaining sin, that we should hate the garment spotted by the flesh, Jud.
21.23.

Pharaoh) drown them in the tears of true repentance as soon as they are born:
we must destroy sin in its first conception, and not suffer it to receive
birth, and breath in our words, and actions, least it grow to our destruction,
Jam. 1.15. Sin when it is finished brings forth death. Hence St. Austin, Caput
Serpentis obs^rva: quod est caput Serpentis? prima peccati suggestio. Observe
well the Serpents head, that thou may give give it a mortal wound: and what
is this Serpents head, but the first suggestion of sin: and St. Cyprian says,
Diaboli primis titillationibus obviandum est, nec col^ber soveri debit donec in
Serpentem formetur. Withstand the Devils first allurin^ motions, neither let us
cherish the Snake till it grow to a Serpent. Sin is an unlimited evil which
admits of no bounds, if we let it have full liberty to enlarge it self, like
Elias his cloud, etc. and if we do not this, we are not so wise for our souls,
as we are about Earthly things: If fire be cast into our bosoms, we will
presently cast it out: and quench it when it first takes hold of our houses: we
mend our garments when the rent is small: we presently stop the gap when the
water has made a breach in the bank, etc. why then should we not deal so with
sin, which is a greater evil, and more dangerous, Vel exigua scintilla flammam
ingentem accendit, and hominem saepenumero viperae semen perdidit: says
Nazianzen, the least spark in time grows to a great flame, and often times the
seed of the Viper has destroyed a man: Let us therefore shun the least fault,
seeing, though it be small, it will quickly be great if we let it go on. A
small Error in the beginning of the way, may become great in the end of the
journey. Sin is a Gangrene which if let alone will devour all: and therefore
here, if ever the Physicians Rule is good, Cito, long, tarde: Fly from it
speedily: go far enough, and it will be too soon if ever we return to it again.
To give way to the first motions of sin is very dangerous, as appears by the
examples of Cain, Solomon, Jonas, Sampson, Herod, Judas, etc.

Fourthly, We must not think any sin so small, as willingly to commit it, and
to continue in it without repentance: But contrariwise we should the rather
fly from the least sin, because naturally we are apt to slight and neglect
such. Non est minimum in vi^a hominum negligere minima, says Eusebius: Its not
the least thing in a man's life to neglect such things as seem to be least, and
I know not of what faults we may be secure, seeing we must be judged for sins
of ignorance, and give an account of our idle words and thoughts. For which end
let us consider.

1. That even by the least sins Gods Law is transgressed, his Justice violated,
and his wrath provoked. Hence St. Hierom says: Nec consideres quod parva
peccata, sed quod magnus ^it Deus, c^i displicent. Do not consider the
smallness of thy sins, but the greatness of thy God who is displeased with
them: and St. Austin adds, Nullum enim peccatum adeo parvum, quod non crescat
neglectum. Non enim considerandum quid fecerit, sed quem offenderit, there is
no sin so little which being neglected does not increase, and we must not
consider what we have done, but how great he is whom we have offended.

2. Consider that the eternal Son of God suffered the bitter death on the
Cross, as well for the least, as for the greatest sins, and is any sins small
which could not be purged by a less price?

3. Consider what great evils come of the least sins: For first our smallest
sins defile our persons, and makes us abominable in Gods sight, especially when
we willingly entertain, or live in them. It ill becomes the Temples of the Holy
Ghost to have such sluttish corners: It ill beseems us who are espoused to
Christ, to come into his presence with such blemishes, and loathsome
defilements.

2. The least sins do wound, and being often committed, do ^ear the Conscience:
as much use makes the hand brawny, and little drops, do hollow the hardest
stones: and small blows cut down the strongest Oaks, they also harden the
forehead, and make the face impudent.

3. If we would know how much even those sins which they would count small, do
provoke the Lords wrath, we may see by those severe judgments which he has
executed on Offenders in this kind, as on Nadab, and Abihu, Lev. 10.1, 2. on
Vzzah, 2. Sam. 6.6. on Achan, Josh. 7. on the man that gathered sticks on the
Sabbath, Numb. 15.32. on Ananias, and Saphira, Acts 5. But above all, most
dreadful was Gods judgment on our first Parents for eating of the forbidden
fruit, whence St. Austin says, Haec peccata etsi parva sint per misericordiam,
fiunt magna peccatoribus negligentia. Although our sins, when they are repented
of, become small, yet they are made great unto sinners through their
negligence, and impenitency. So Matthew. 5.22. and 12.36.

4. That we may not give way to the least sins, let us consider, that if we
willingly entertain them, they will prove no less dangerous then the greatest,
because they are the continual Errors of our lives, which are more frequently
committed then heinous offenses, and therefore what they want in weight, they
^ave in number: the tallest Ship may be sunk by the smallest sands: Hence St.
Austin says, Ne contemn peccata parva: etsi parvi facias dum ea ponderas,
time saltem quando annumeras. Despise not small sins, for though thou do but
lightly esteem them whilst thou do weigh them, yet at least fear when thou
beginnest to number them. Great Rivers are filled with small drops: Gather the
least things together, and they will make a great heap, etc. Great sins indeed
more wast the Conscience, and are like to savage beasts, devours us at one bit,
or Jonas's Whale that swallowed him up at once: But small sins also are like
those little vermin, that with their multitude plagued Pharaoh and his people.
But what need I speak of multitudes of sins, when the least unrepented of is
sufficient to damn us.

5. If we be careful to fly from the least sins, it will be a notable means
to preserve us from falling into greater: he that gives no place to the first
motions of covetousness, is safe from usury, bribery, extortion, theft, etc. He
that keeps his tongue from speaking irreverently of God, is safe from cursing,
and blasphemy: He that makes Conscience of vain swearing, is safe from perjury,
etc. therefore St. Hierom says, Satis prodesse ad cautionem discimus etiam
minima pro maximis cavere. Its a good caution in avoiding sin, to take heed of
the least, as though they were the greatest, whereas if we ordinarily swallow
smaller sins, it widens our throats to let down greater.

6. Consider that sin is that deadly poison which Satan the great red Dragon
casts out of his mouth, and who would drink that which he has disgorged? who
would be allured to swallow these poisons which are so mortal to the soul,
because they delight our carnal appetite? Sin is Satan's livery, which who so
willingly wea^s, acknowledges the Devils sovereignty, and his own servitude, 1 John 3.8, 9.

7. Consider that those enemies are most dangerous, which are most despised:
For hereby we are brought to neglect our watch, to lay aside our Armor, and
Weapons, and to fall i^ to the deadly slumber of carnal security, and what
Enemy is so weak, that cannot cut the throat of the strongest when he is a
sleep, and disarmed? Nullum peccatum tam parvum est, quod contemptu non fiat
magnum, says St. Augustine, there is no sin so small, which contempt will not
make ^reat.

8. Consider that if we do not hate all sin, small as well as great, we hate
not any with a Christian hatred: For they that hate sin truly, and spiritually,
do it upon these grounds.

1. Because it has the Devils stamp, and Superscription on it, who is Cods,
and our greatest Enemy, and this his Image is upon the smallest, as well as the
greatest sins.

2. Such hate sin because they love, and fear God, and would not do any thing
which might displease him; and they hate it because its so odious to God, so
opposite to his Law, and contrary to his nature, upon which grounds they hate
every sin, small and great: and though they do not equally hate all, yet they
are not in love with any.

Fifthly, The next Rule for the subduing of the flesh is, that we must neglect
work out our salvation with fear and trembling, Phil. 2.12. and when we think
we stand, to take heed of falling, 1 Cor. 10.12.

Sixthly, The last Rule is, that we set no stint to our mortification, but that
Joash with the Aramites, 2 King. 13.18. contenting our selves with two or three
victories over them: much less as the Israelites with those cursed Nations,
suffering them quietly to dwell with us, on condition that they will contribute
something to our pleasure, profit, etc. but we must war with them till we have
utterly rooted them out: or at least to deal with them, as Joshuah with the
Gibeonites, to make them our slaves. Let us not deal with them as Saul and Ahab
with Agag, and Benhadad, get the victory, and so suffer them to live, least
through Gods judgment they kill us because we killed not them: neither with
Saul, let us destroy the meanest of our lusts, and keep the fattest alive which
bring most pleasure, or profit to us: Let us not be like Herod, that refrained
from many sins, but would not part with his Herodias: But our mortification
must be without stint, or restraint, extending to all lusts in respect of the
object, and in respect of the time, continually even to the end of our lives:
and thus continuing faithful to the death, we shall receive the Crown of life,
Rev. 2.10. And lastly in respect of the degrees, we must not content our selves
that we have mortified our lusts in some measure, but we must strive after
perfection, not suffering sin to live in any of our members, but must cleanse
our selves from all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, etc. 2 Co. 7.1. Laboring
to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect, Mat. 5.48. For which end we
must pray God to sanctify us throughout, 1 These. 5.23. and Christ our Savior
to sanctify and cleanse us by the washing of water by the Word, etc. Ephesians.
5.25. and to our prayers, we must add our endeavors to increase in the measure
of mortification, getting daily new victories over all our sinful lusts. True
grace is growing grace, etc.

Quest. What means may we use to strengthen the Spirit to the obtaining of the
victory?

Answ. First* We must avoid the means whereby its weakened. For in this
spiritual warfare both these concur in the same actions: for the famishing of
the Flesh, is the nourishing of the Spirit, and the weakening of the one, is the
strengthening of the other. Quantum carni detrahes, tantum facies animum
spirituals bona habitudine relucere, says Basil. Look how much thou detractest
from the flesh, so much thou make thy spiritual part to prosper and flourish
in good health, and liking. Now the chief means whereby the Spirit is weakened,
are our sins, whereby we grieve the good Spirit of God, and make him weary of
lodging in our hearts but above others, such sins weakens the Spirit as are
committed against knowledge, and conscience, wilfully, and presumptuously: with
which kind of obstinate rebellion the spirit is tired, that he will no longet
contend with us, but leave us to our lusts, and a reprobate mind to go on to
our perdition, Genesis 6.3. So it was with the old world. Of this God complains,
Amos 2.13. that he was pressed under their sins as a cart under the sheaves:
For this God gave the Gentiles up to vile affections, etc. Romans 1.26. we must
not therefore quench the Spirit, 1 These. 5.19. nor grieve him, Ephesians. 4.30.

Quest. But what are those special sins which most wound and w^aken the Spirit?

Answ. First, Ignorance, and blindness of mind, which pulls out of the hand

Secondly, Infidelity, which disables the Spirit whilst it deprives it of the
chief viz. Gods sweet promises of grace in this life, and of glory in the next,
to all those who walk in the Spirit, and mortify the flesh. Yea it weakens the
spiritual bond of our union with Christ, which is our Faith, by which alone he
is applied, and so hinders the influences of his graces, by which we are
strengthened against the flesh, and enabled to withstand the assaults of all
our spiritual enemies.

Thirdly, Impenitency, which is most pernicious to the health, and vigor of
the Spirit: for besides, that it hinders all the operations of Faith, the
application

Fourthly, Carnal security, and hardness of heart greatly weakens the spirit,
whereby we bless our selves when our state is dangerous, and have no sense, and

Fifthly, The love of the world, which like birdlime, so besmears the wings of
of our soul, that thereby it is fastened to the earth, and worldly vanities:
more especially Tim 6.9, 10. and so the love of earthly pleasures hinder the
pursuit of those eternal pleasures, and fullness of joy which is as Gods right
hand for ever more. For when the flesh is pamperd with these carnal delights,
the spirit is pined: when its made fat with gluttony, the spirit grows lean,
fullness of wine, and the Spirit will not stand together, as we see, Ephesians. 5.18.



2. We must not provide for this spiritual warfare, carnal weapons. For 2
Cor. 10.4. the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, etc. As for example, we
must not fight against the flesh with fleshly anger, and carnal revenge. For
Jam. 1.20. the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God: we must not
seek to subdue the flesh with popish fasting, called the Doctrine of Devils, 1 Timothy 4.1, 3. But with our fasting when we have just occasion, we must join
Prayer, the one being the end, the other the means enabling us thereunto.

Thirdly, We must not remit any thing of our zeal in holy duties, and give way
to coldness, and formality therein. For we may the more easily preserve the
strength of the Spirit, whilst its in the best plight, then recover it when its
diminished again, the more resolutely we stand in the strength of grace
received, the more willing the Lord is to assist us in fighting his battles:
the more careful we are to increase his spiritual Talents, the more willing
he is to redouble them,

4. Lastly, we must avoid fleshly sloth, and negligence: and must use Gods
gifts, and graces in the exercise of Christian duties to the glory of him that
gave them. Our knowledge must be exercised in the practice of what we know: Our
Faith in good works: our love to God, and our neighbors in performing all holy
duties we owe them. For if we could abound in all graces, yet if we did not use
them for our own defense, and the discomforting our enemies, we should be never
the nearer in obtaining the victory.

Quest. How may we cheer up, and comfort the Spirit to this Conflict?

Answ. First, We must earnestly desire to have the Spirit more strengthened,
and the gifts, and graces of it more enlarged, and multiplied in us. God has
promised that if we want the Spirit, and ask it of him, he will give it us,
Luke 11.13. So if we have it, and desire, and beg an increase of the gifts of
it, he will satisfy our desires, and carry it on to perfection, Psalm. 145.19.
Phil. 1.6. For therefore does the Lord give us these longings that we may
satisfy them, we must not therefore rest content with any measure of grace
received, but go on from grace to grace, till we come to perfection: and this
is an infallible sign of the regenerate, who are therefore said to be trees of
righteousness of Gods own planting, Psalm. 92.14. which are most fruitful in
their old age: they are like the morning light, which shines more, and more to
the perfect day, Prove. 4.18. they are Gods bildings, which is still setting up
till it be fully finished, Ephesians. 2.20. they are Gods Children who grow from
strength to strength, till they come to a perfect stature: therefore we must
desire to grow in grace, Ephesians. 4.12, 13. Joh. 15.2. 2 Pet. 3.18.

Secondly, We must use all good means for the strengthening of the spirit; for
which end,

1. We must be diligent in hearing, reading, and meditating on the word of God,
which is the ministry of grace, and salvation; not only the seed whereby we are
begotten again, but the food also whereby we are nourished till we come to a
full age in Christ, 1 Pet. 2.2. and because a time of scarcity may come, we
must (with Joseph) lay up aforehand that we may have provision in such times as
those. For if food be withdrawn from the spirit, it will languish, and not be
able to stand against the assaults of the flesh in the day of battle.

2. To the Ministry of the Word, we must join the frequent use of the Lords
Supper, which is a spiritual feast, purposely ordained by our Savior Christ,
for the strengthening our communion with him by the Spirit, and for the
replenishing of us with all those sanctifying graces, whereby we may be enabled
to resist the flesh.

3. We must use the help of holy conference, instructing, exhorting,
admonishing, counselling, and comforting one another, that we may be further
edified in our holy Faith, Jude 20.

Thirdly, If we will strengthen the Spirit, we must nourish the good motions

Fourthly, We must be careful of maintaining our peace with God, and our Psalm.
42.1, 2. and 84.1. etc. when we labor daily in the mortification of our sins,
which separate between God and us, and exercise our selves in all holy duties
of his service, thereby glorifying his Name, and edifying our neighbors by our
good example.

Fifthly, We must carefully preserve our bodies, and souls, which are his

Sixthly, If we would strengthen the Spirit, and increase in us the gifts and
are necessary for preserving the life of our bodies: So fruitful working, and
holy walking in all Christian duties is for preserving, and cherishing the life
of the Spirit, Gal. 5.25. If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit,
Let the fire of the Spirit have fit vent to send out its flames in holy, and
righteous actions, it will live and blaze, but if we stop its vent, it will
presently die. Let Faith exercise it self in apprehending the promises, in
waiting for performances, fighting against doubting, and in bea^ing the fruits
of good works, it will from a grain of mustard seed, grow to be a great tree,
from smoking flax, to a burning flame, and from a feeble assent to a full
persuasion. Let love be exercised in doing, and suffering for Gods sake, in
performing all holy services, and Christian duties to God and our neighbors,
it will grow from a spark to a great fire. Let the shoulders of patience be
inured to bear the Cross of Christ, and suffer afflictions: to put up wrongs,
and overcome evil with good, though they be weak at first, they will become
hardy, and strong. Exercise increases graces, but ease and sloth weakens them,
we should therefore resolve with David, Psalm. 119.32, 33, 34.

teaches our hands to war, and our fingers to fight, Psalm. 144.1. and that
gives us at the last a full, and final victory, and then adds the Crown of
victory, even everlasting glory. Mr. Downhams Christian warfare.

Quest. But the flesh and Spirit being but qualities, how can they be said to
fight together?

Answ. Because the flesh and Spirit are mixed together in the whole regenerate
man, and in all the powers of his soul: as light and darkness are mixed in the
air in the dawning of the day: and as heat and cold are mixed together in
lukewarm water: we cannot say that one part of the water is hot, and another
cold, but heat and cold are mixed in every part: so the man regenerate, is not
in one part flesh, and another spirit, but the whole mind is partly flesh, and
partly spirit, and so are the will and affections, etc. Now upon this mixture
it is that the powers of the soul are carried, and disposed diverse ways, and
hereupon follows the combat.

Quest. How does the lust of the flesh show it self?

Answ. First, it defiles, and suppresses the good motions of the Spirit: Hence
Paul says, Romans 7.21, 23. when I would do good, evil is present: and the Law
of the flesh rebels against the Law of the mind, Hereupon the flesh is fitly
compared to the disease called Ephialtes, or the mare, in which men in their
slumber, think they feel a thing as heavy as lead to lie upon their breasts,
which they can no way remove.

Secondly, It brings forth, and fills the mind with wicked cogitations, and
rebellious Jam. 1.14.

Quest. What are the contary actions of the spirit?

Answ. First, To curb, and restrain the flesh: Hence St. John says, the
regenerate cannot sin, 1 John 3.9,

Secondly, To beget good motions, inclinations, and thoughts agreeable to the
David, Psalm. 16.7. My reins instruct me in the night season: and Isa. 30.21.
thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee, etc. and thus by the concurrence of
these contrary actions in the same man is the combat made.

Quest. Why is there such a contrariety between the flesh and spirit?

Answ. Because the Spirit is the gift of righteousness, and the flesh stands in
a double opposition to it.

1. In the want of righteousness. 2. In a proness to all unrighteousness.

Object. But natural men also have a combat in them. For they can say, video
meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor. I see and approve of what is good, but do
that which is naught?

Answ. This combat is between the natural conscience, and rebellious
affections, and its incident to all men that have in them any conscience, or
light of reason.

Quest. Have all believers this combat in them?

Answ. No: For 1. Only such as be of years have it: for Infants, though they
have the seed of grace in them, yet do they want the act, or exercise of it,
and

Secondly, This combat is in the godly in the time of this life only. For in
death the flesh is abolished, and consequently this combat cease.

Quest. What are the effects of this combat in the godly?

Answ. It hinders them that they cannot do the things that they would, Gal.
5.17. and that three ways.

1. It makes them that they cannot live in the practice of any one sin, 1 John
3.9.

2. If at any time they fall, it stays and keeps them that they sin not with
full consent of will, but they can say, the evil which I hate, that do I, Romans
7.19.

3. Though in the ordinary course of their lives they do that which is good,
yet by reason of this conflict they fail in the doing of it, Romans 7.18. Hence
it follows that all the works of regenerate men are mixed with sin, and in the
rigor of justice deserve damnation.

Object. Sin is the transgression of the Law: but good works are no
transgression of the Law, and therefore they are no sins?

Answ. I answer to the Minor: The transgression of the Law is twofold. One
which is directly against the Law, both for matter and manner: 2. When that is
done which the Law requires, but not in that manner it should be done: and thus
good works become sinful.

Object. Good works are from the Spirit of God: but nothing proceeding from the
Spirit of God is sin?

Answ. Things proceeding from the Spirit of God alone, or from the Spirit
immediately, are no sins: but good works proceed not only from the Spirit, but
also from the mind, and will of man, as instruments of the Spirit: and when an
effect proceeds from sundry causes that are subordinate, it takes unto it the
nature of the second cause: hereupon our works are partly spiritual, and
partly carnal, as the mind and will of the doer is.

Object. But good works please God, and what pleases God is no sin?

Answ. They please God, because the doer of them is in Christ. Again, they
please not God before, or withour pardon. For they are accepted, because God
approves his own work in us, and pardons the defect thereof.

Object. No sins are to be done, therefore if good works be sin, they are not
to be done?

Answ. They are not simply sins but only by accident. For as God commands them,
they are good, and as godly men do them they are good in part. Now the reason
holds only thus, that which is sin, so far forth as it is a sin, or if it be
simply a sin, is not to be done.

Mr. Perkins, Vol. 2. p. 326.

CHAP. XLIII. Questions, and Cases about Conscience Good and Bad.
Quest. WHat is Conscience?

Answ. It is a faculty of the soul, taking knowledge, and bearing witness of a
man's thoughts, words, and works, excusing them when they be good, and accusing
them when they be evil, Romans 2.15. If the Conscience be not deceived, but
bears a true witness, then its no erroneous Conscience; Yet it may be an evil
Conscience if it be not sanctified as well as enlightened. Or,

Conscience is a particular knowledge which we have within us of our own deeds,
good, or evil, arising out of the general knowledge of the mind, which shows
us what is good, or evil, and Conscience tells us when we have done the one or
the other.

Conscience is a word of great latitude, and infinite dispute. Its taken
sometimes properly, sometimes generally. Its both a faculty, and a distinct
faculty of the soul: the Schools reject that, others this: but besides reason,
the word bends most that way, 1 Timothy 1.19. its distinguished from the evil,
Tit. 1.15. from the mind. And if we mark it, Conscience is so far from being
one of both, or both in one, as that there is between them: 1. A jealousy,
then an open faction: the other powers of the soul taking Conscience to be but
a spy, do what they can, first to hide themselves from it, next to deceive it,
afterward to oppose it, and lastly, to depose it. Conscience on the other
side, labors to hold its own, and (till it be blinded or bribed) proceeds in
its office in spite of all opposition: It cites all the powers of nature, sits
upon them, examineth, witnesses, judges, executes, hence come those (...)
self-conferences, or reasonings spoken of, Romans 2.15. Thence those Apologies,
and exceptions amongst themselves when Conscience sits.

Quest. What is the common subject of conscience?

Answ. The reasonable soul: Indeed there is some shadow of it in a beast, a^
th^e ^s of reason: but it is but a shadow: the proper sea^ of it, is the
highest part of the soul: its usually referred to the practical understanding,
because its busied about actions, and drives all its works to issue by
discourse: but as that ground is too weak (for neither is every discourse
Conscience, nor every act of conscience a discourse) so is that room too
straight: Conscience is therefore rather to be placed somewhat higher, under
God, but over all in man, distinct from other faculties, ye^ still sheathed in
the body.

Quest. What is its end, or office?

Answ. It is set in man to make known to man, in what terms he stands with God,
thence its name, and therefore is fitly termed, the souls glass, and the
understandings light.

Conscience therefore is a prime faculty of the reasonable soul, there set to
give notice of its spiritual estate in what terms it stands with God. The soul
is ranked into three parts, and those into as many Courts, and Offices. The
sensitive part has its Court of Common Pleas: the intellectual, of the Kings
Bench: the spiritual, a Chancery: in this Court all causes are handled, but
still with special reference to God: Here sits Conscience as Lord Chancellor,
the Synteresis as Master of the Rolls: To this Court all the powers of man owe,
and pay service till the Judge be either willingly feed, or unwillingly
resisted. And this of Conscience strictly taken.

2. Its taken sometimes more generally: Sometimes for the whole Court, and
proceeding of Conscience, by the Fathers: Sometimes for the whole soul of man,
either stooping to Conscience, or reflecting upon it self; So the Hebrews ever
take it: You never find that term (Conscience) with them, but Heart, Spirit.
So St. John (who abounds with Hebraisms) If our heart condemn, or condemn us
not, 1 John 3.19, etc.

Dr. Harris, St. Paul's Exercise.

Quest. What is the Scripture word for Conscience?

Ans. (...), which is a compound word: 1. of the verb (...), which signifies to
see, Mat. 2.2. and to know, Joh. 13.18. 2. of a Preposition, (...), which
signifies with: So as Conscience implies, knowledge with: viz. with some other
thing.

Conscience then implies a double knowledge: One of the mind, which is a bare
understanding of a thing: Another of the heart: So as the heart witnessing a
thing together with the mind, is Conscience, 1 Cor. 2.11. -- save the Spirit,
(i. e. the Conscience) of a man which is in him. Or

The double knowledge that is comprised under conscience, may be of God, or a
man's self. God knows all things, even the most secret thoughts, Psalm. 139.2.
and every man knows the most secret things of himself, 1 Cor. 2.11. the
testimony therefore of a man's heart, with his mind, or rather with God, is
Conscience. Hence its said to bear witness, Romans 9.1. and Paul rejoiced in the
testimony of his Conscience, 2 Cor. 1.12.

Quest. Where is the seat of Conscience;

Answ. Within a man: For its applied to the heart, Heb. 10.22. yea, its styled
the heart, Prove. 15.15. 1 Samuel 24.5. and the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.11.

Quest. Why is it seated in a man?

Answ. That it may the better perform the function which belongs to it: It
being within, may see all within, and without. As a man within a house full of
windows, 1 Kin. 2.44.

But Conscience cannot be discerned by others without, as is employed, Jer.
17.9. 1 Cor. 2.11.

Quest. What is the Office of Conscience?

Answ. To witness, Romans 2.15. For this end it has ability to know the things
of a man. The witness of Conscience is the surest witness that can be. Its a
faithful witness that will not lie, Prove. 14.5. A man by his tongue may belie
himself, but Conscience cannot do so.

Quest. How manifold is the witnes^ of Conscience?

Answ. Twofold: Either to accuse, or to excuse, Romans 2.15. To accuse for evil,
to excuse by freeing from evil unjustly laid to ones charge: the Jews
Conscience accused, Joh. 8.9. St. Pauls's excused, Act. 23.1. Hence follows
trouble, or peace to a man's soul, as Matthew. 27.4. Romans 5.1.

Quest. What is a good Conscience?

Answ. That Conscience is said to be good, when it obeys such light, and
direction, as it does think, and take to be true and sound light, and
direction, Act. 23.1.

Quest. How many things concur to make up a good Conscience?

Answ. First, the matter whereupon it works, which is a conformity in the
whole man to the whole will of God: Gods will made known to man, is man's

Secondly, The proper act of it, where this matter is to be found, the
Conscience will bear witness, and give a true testimony thereunto.

Thirdly, The Consequence following thereupon, which is peace, and quietness to
the soul.

Such a good Conscience was perfect in man's innocence: but by his fall it was
clean lost, and became an evil conscience. For Genesis 6.5.

Quest. How does an evil Conscience fail in the proper works thereof?

Answ. Sometimes in defect: Sometimes in an excess.

1. In the defect when it suffers a man to run into all evil, and does neither
check, nor trouble him for the same. Called a seared conscience, 1 Timothy 4.2.

2. In the excess, when it does so out of measure trouble him, as it takes away
all hope of pardon, and hinders sound and true repentance: yea, and makes his
life a burden to himself: So Judas's, Matthew. 27.3, 4, 5. Hence, Isai. 57.20, 21.

Quest. What must concur to the renovation of Conscience, and making it good?

Answ. First, Faith in Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the Conscience is purged,
Heb. 9.14. Hence we are exhorted, Heb. 10.22. to draw near with a pure heart,
etc.

Secondly, A sanctified work of the Spirit, whereby the heart is alienated from
sin, and made watchful against it: and withal it is put on to conform Romans
9.1. 2 Cor. 1.12. This is styled a pure Conscience, 1 Timothy 3.9. 2 Timothy 1.3. and
a Conscience void of offense, Act. 24.16.

Quest. What then since man's fall is counted a good Conscience?

Answ. First, That which gives a true testimony of a man's Faith in Christ, for
the pardon of his sins, and reconciliation with God, Heb.

Secondly, Which bears witness to his conformity in the whole man to the holy
will of God in all manner of duties to God and man, Act. 24.16. particularly,
Matt. 25.21.

Thirdly, That which works peace, and quiet in the soul, Romans 5.1. 2 Cor.
1.12.

Dr. Gouge on Heb.

Quest. What other definitions may be given of Conscience?

Answ. Conscience is the judgment of a man concerning himself, and his own
ways, in reference, and subordination to the judgment of God: Dr. Ames. Or

Its the souls recoiling on its self. Ward, Dike. Or

Its the souls acting, and reflecting on it self, and on all a man's own actions.

Quest. How many sorts of good consciences are there?

Answ. A good troubled conscience: Bona turbata.

Secondly, A good quiet Conscience: Bona pacata.

Quest. What goodness must concur to a right good Conscience?

Answ. First, a goodness of sincerity.

Secondly, a goodness of security: It must be honest bona, and pacate bona.

Quest. What then is a truly good Conscience?

Answ. A good Conscience is that which is rightly purified, and rightly
pacified by the Word, Blood, and Spirit of Christ, regularly performing all the
Offices unto which it is designed.

Quest. What must it be purified from?

Answ. First, Ignorance: A Conscience void of knowledge, is void of Tit. 1.15.

Secondly, From error, the Erroneous Conscience is ever a desperate, and Herod
under an Opinion of piety, to destroy John to save his wicked Oath, Mat. 14.9.
Others make void Gods commands to make good their own vows, Jer. 44.16. It made
Paul to persecute the Church, Act. 26.9. others to compass Sea, and Land to
make Proselites, Matthew. 23.15.

Heb. 9.14. A dead Conscience is not for a living God.

Quest. How must conscience be purified?

Answ. First, The word of Christ is the great heart-searcher, and
Conscience-purifier, Heb. 4.12. Joh. 15.3. and 17.17. This removes ignorance,
Psalm. 119.105, 130. It rectifies Error, being a voice behind us, Isa. ^0.21.
ends all controversies, Isa. 8.26. Resolves all doubts, Luke 10.26. Removes
deadness and hardness, Jer. 23.29. Its an Hammer to soften: Its immortal seed,
etc. 1 Pet. 1.23. Hence Psalm. 119.25, 50, 93.

Heb. 9.14. and 10.22. 1 John 1.7.

Thirdly, The Spirit of Christ, together with the Word, and blood of Christ
Joh. 6.63. Heb. 9.14. the Spirit heals those diseases before mentioned. 1.
Ignorance, being the Spirit of illumination, Ephesians. 1.17. 2. Error, being the
Spirit of truth, Joh. 14.17. 3. Deadness, being the Spirit of life, Romans 8.2.
Its Refiners fire, etc. Mal. 3.2. Hence, Isa. 4.4.

Quest. What must Conscience be pacified from?

Answ. First, It must be at peace from the dominion of sin: there is a peace
when sin, and Satan are strongly armed, and keep the house, Luke 11.^1. But
this is the peace of a sleepy, not of an awakened Conscience: woe to them, Luke
6.25. Amos. 6.1, 3. Conscientia pacate optima, may be, vitiose pessima. In tali
pace amaritudo mea amarissima: Ber. there is no peace to the wicked, Isa. 57.
ult. 2 Pet. 2.3.

Matthew. 16.18. the sum of that promise, Romans 16.20. the God of Peace shall
bruise Satan under your feet shortly.

Thirdly, From the displeasure of God, when we can say, Romans 5.1. being
justified by Faith, we have peace with God: This is the best part of our peace:
John 14.27. So, Phil. 4.7. This guards the soul from all fears, and assaults
of the Law, Sin, Guilt, Death, Hell, and Satan.

Quest. What must Conscience be pacified by?

Answ. First, By the Word of Christ its pacified, and restored to peace: hence
Word of Peace, etc. Acts 10.36. Romans 10.15. 2 Cor. 5.18. Isa. 57.19. and 52.7.

Secondly, By the blood of Christ. This is the procuring cause of all our Col.
1.20. Romans 3.23, etc. This blood gives the soul all boldness to enter into
the holiest, etc. Heb. 10.19. and gives us assurance before God.

Thirdly, By the Spirit of Christ, which is the procreating cause of peace in
us: Advocate, 1 John 2.1. So is the Holy Ghost, Joh. 14.16. Only here is the
difference: Christ is our Advocate to God, prevailing with him to grant us
peace: the Holy ^host is Gods Advocate to us, to prevail with us, to entertain
peace. He applies the Word, and promises which proclaim our peace: He applies
the blood of Christ which procures our peace: He has the last hand in
consummating our peace; whence its called, Joy in holy Ghost, Romans 14.17. So
Gal. 5.22.

Quest. What are the Offices of Conscience?

Answ. First, Prophetical, or Ministerial, i. e. To do the Office of a
Minister, mouth of the Lord, the Candle of the Lord, Prove. 20.27.

Secondly, Regal, or Magistraticall. It has a commanding, and Legislative
Romans 2.14. they were a Law to themselves, therefore what Conscience commands,
or forbids is more to a godly man, then what Kings command, or forbid. Hence,
Dan. 3.16. But though it has a Kingly power, yet it has not an Arbitrary
power: It self is subject to God.

Thirdly, Testimonial, or to bear witness, Romans 2.14, 15. 2 Cor. 1.12. This is
a testimony which Gods Spirit does attest to, and consent with, Romans 9.1. and
Joh. 3.19, 20, 21. Conscientia mill testes.

Turpe quid acturus, te sine test time. Fourthly, Juridicall, and Judg-like:
It passes sentence on thee, and reads thy doom: Hence we are said to be
convicted of our own Consciences, Joh. 8.9. Tit. 3.11. Romans 14.22. 1 John 3.20,
21. Consciences sentence is the forerunner of the last judgment, Job 31.35,
36. Isa. 50.8. 1 Samuel 2.25.

Fifthly, Registeriall: For its the great Register, and Recorder of the World.
Its to every man his private Notary, keeping Records of all his Acts, and
deeds. It has the pen of a ready Writer, and takes from thy mouth all thou
speak: yea from thy heart all thou contrivest, and though its writing may
for the present, like the writing with the juice of a Lemon, be illegible: yet
when thou come into the fire of distress, it will then appear: or at
farthest, the fire in the great day of judgment will discover it.

Its the poor man's Historiographer, who has no Chronicler to rite his story,
Jer. 17.1. So that Conscience is then good when it does officiate well, and
does the part of a Minister, of a Magistrate, of a Witness, and of a Judge.

Quest. How many sorts of good Consciences are there?

Answ. First, The good Conscience of Faith: without which its impossible Heb.
11.6. Therefore St. Paul joines Faith, and a good Conscience together, 1 Timothy
1.5, 19. and 3.9. There is no good faith, where there is not a good conscience:
nor yet a good conscience where true faith is wanting, therefore look to thy
Faith, if thou would find a good Conscience, Heb. 10.22. 1 Timothy 3.9.

Secondly, A pure Conscience, the clean, pure, and undefiled Conscience is Tim.
1.5. and 3.9. 2 Timothy 1.3. As faith makes the Conscience good before God, so
purity makes it good before men. Such are blessed, Mat. 5.8. 1 John 3.3. Great
are the comforts, benefits, and privileges of a pure Conscience, and high are
the promises made to it, Psalm. 18.26. and 24.3, 4, 5. In pure water thy face
may be seen, not so in muddy: So in a pure Conscience Gods face may be seen,
and no where else in the Earth.

Noah, and Job are called perfect, because sincere, Genesis 6.9. Job 1.1. of this
Conscience, Paul speaks, 2 Cor. 1.12. The Greek word for sincerity, (...) used,
1 Cor. 5.8. 2 Cor. 1.12. signifies such things as are tried by the light. Or,
as a Chap-man opens his wares to see if there be any deceit in them.

Quest. But how may this sincerity of Conscience be known?

Answ..1 It makes a man abhor all guile, and fraud, and to renounce the hidden
things of dishonesty: like Jacob, a plain downright man: or Nathaniel, an
Israelite, in whom was no guile: Such was Paul, 2 Cor. 2.17. and 4.2. and
Michaiah, 1 Kin. 22.14. and Caleb, Joh. 14.7, 8.

2. Sincerity brings all to the light, Joh. 3.20. He that does the truth,
comes to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought
in God, and therefore, as of sincerity, and as of God, and as in the sight of
God, are put together, 2 Cor. 2.17. Such an one owns nothing but what will
endure the Sun. Hence, Psalm. 26.2. Joh. 21.16, 17. Job 6.24. 2 Cor. 4.2. 1
These. 2.10.

3. The sincere man is still one, and the same, whether alone, or in company:
yea, he is rather better then he shows: as the Kings daughter, all glorious
within, Psalm. 45.13. He is just, and faithful, being a Law to himself.

4. The sincere man may have his failings, and is subject to tentations, yet he
never allows himself in any known evil: therefore he is called perfect in
respect of his intention, and aim, 2 King. 20.3. He resists every known will,
and rejects every known Error: He purifies himself as God is pure, 1 John 33.
So Romans 7.16, 17.

5. A sincere man holds on his course, and he that has clean hands shall be
stronger and stronger, Job 17.9. as the vessel of gold wears brighter, and
brighter by use, therefore sincerity is the best seen in times and places when,
and where Satan is let loose, Rev. 2.13. where there are few encouragements to
persist in a godly way: So Nichodemus in sticking to a condemned Christ, Joh.
7.51. Joseph of Arimathea to a crucified, forsaken, and naked Christ, Joh.
19.38.

6. Universality is a certain note of sincerity, when we walk in all the
commandments of God, as Luke 1.6. Heb. 13.18. Dan. 6.22. To be partial is to
corrupt the Law, Mal. 2.9. To make Conscience of one duty, and not of another,
is to make no Conscience of the one, or of the other. So Mat. 23.5, 23. Romans
2.22.

7. A sincere man carries himself ever as before God, 2 Cor. 2.17. Psalm. 16.8.
and 44.21. He carries an awful apprehension of God with him whithersoever he
goes: Hence, Col. 3.23.

8. A sincere man consults with his duty more then with his commodity, and
resolves against sin, more then against any danger: He undervalues all losses
to the loss of Gods favor, and his own peace, Psalm. 25.21.

9. Such an one cannot skill of fleshly wisdom, or worldly Policy: He is no
time-server, 2 Cor. 1.12. Simplicity is the sincerity, and sincerity all the
policy of a conscientious man. He desires no more wisdom then will make him
honest, and sincere, Romans 16.19.

10. Sincerity is known, 1. By the original, and principle it moves from:
Pharisees pray for ostentation, not from devotion, Mat. 6.1, 2, 5. So, Phil.
1.16. A sincere person does all out of a principle of piety to God, and charity
to man. 2. By the rule it constantly walks by, viz. Gods Word. So Josiah, 2
Kin. 22.2. Come commodity, or discommodity, he keeps on his way: but unsound
persons cast their eye on their own interest. So 2 Chronicles. 27.2. and 26.4. and
25.2. 2 Kin. 10.31. 3. By the end it aims at, God is the sincere man's end, and
his glory his aim: the Hypocrite makes himself his own end, and so himself his
own god, Zach. 7.5, 6. Hos. 10.1.


Fourthly, An inoffensive Conscience, which Paul highly esteemed, Act. 24.16.

1. Avoid giving offense, either to God or man. 1. He strives to prevent
offenses to God, and takes up purposes against them, Psalm. 17.3. and if he has
displeased God, he is displeased with himself for it. So Jer. 31.19. Job 42.6.
Ezekiel. 6.9. and 36.31. and he is careful to break off his sins by repentance,
Job 34.31, 32. and 40.4, 5. He is resolved rather to offend all thee world,
then to offend God, Gal. 1.10. Dan. 3.16. Act. 4.19.

2. Avoid giving offense to man: especially such an offense as may cause him to
sin, and then such an offense as may cause him to take offense: in the first we
tempt him, in the second we try him: in both we offend him, and do the Devils
work in both. By the former he is stumbled, by the Second he is made weak, and
by both offended, Romans 14.21. we must therefore take heed that we do nothing
that should cause others to offend by sinning, as Elies sons did, 1* Sam. 2.24.
and Jer^boam, 1 Kin. 14.16. and Ahab, 1 Kin. 21.25. woe to such, Luke 17.1. we
must give no offense to the godly, be they stronger, or weaker, Matthew. 18.6,
10. nor to the wicked. Hence, Col. 4.5. 1 Timothy 6.1, 2. 1 Pet. 2.18. and 3.1. we
must not offend our selves, but must regard what Conscience calls for to
satisfy our duty, and to keep in with our selves, rather then to gratify any
others requests.

2. An inoffensive Conscience will not be apt to take offense, either 1. From
God, who can never give any: yet to some, Christ is a rock of offense, Romans
9.33. yea he was so to his Disciples, Math. 26.31. 2. From Gods way: as when we
receive the Word with joy, but meeting with persecution we are offended, and
turn back, Math. 13.21. 3. From Gods Children, and their weakness, so far as
either to condemn their persons, or dislike their profession, Matthew. 18.5. True
godliness makes a man apt to take all in good part, 1 Cor. 13.5. 4. From the
evil World, because all men speak evil of the ways of God, and forsake them,
we must not therefore be offended, Isa. 8.12, 13.


Pharisees were full of eyes without, and none within: full of eyes before* but
had none behind: they could censure others actions, not see their own: Hence
called fools, and blind, Mat. 23.17, 19, 24.

Sixthly, A well-spoken Conscience, which can make the soul a good answer,
Quaries, 1 Pet. 3.21.

1. It makes a good and ready answer to God, as Psalm 27.8. and 40.8.

2. It makes a good answer for God, as is commanded, 1 Pet. 3.15, 16. Its ready
to give an account of its Spiritual estate when it is required

3. It makes a good answer for ones self, when under the greatest clouds of
censures, suspicions, or reproaches, Romans 9.1. 2 Cor. 6.8, 9.

4. When any business of Conscience is under consideration, Conscience puts the
best answer into thy mouth, and will readily resolve what is to be done.

Paul glories, Heb. 13.18. Act. 23.1. 1 Pet. 3.16. Peter exhorts to it, a good
conversation without, proclaims a good Conscience within, Phil. 4.8. Notes of
an honest Conscience are,

1. He has engraven on his heart this maxim, I must be a Law to my self:
Hence its said, 1 Timothy 1.9. The Law is not witten for the righteous: And if
others were as honest as he, fewer Laws, and Magistrates would serve turn.

2. He makes Christ's rule his Oracle, Matthew. 7.12. what ever you would others
should do to you, etc. which is the Epitome of the Law, and Prophets: the voice
both of Scripture, and nature.

3. You may be bold to take his word, and trust him: He dares not deceive,
though he may be deceived: His word is as good as his bond: his bond as his
oath: and his oath as his soul.

4. You need not fear to take his wares, his weight, or his measure, all are
current, and warrantable: He is faithful, and punctual in his reckonings,
disbursments, and receipts, as they, 2 Kin. 12.15. etc.

5. He respects not a person so much as the cause: the cause of the poor,
fatherless, and widows is more to him, then the face of the rich, or the letter
of the mighty: Like Levi, Deuteronomy. 33.9.

6. He will sooner suffer any prejudice himself, then prejudice his neighbor,
Psalm. 15.4. He swears to his own hurt, and damage, and changes not.

heart of flesh promised, Ezekiel. 36.25. the c^ntrite spirit in which God
delights, Isa. 66.1, 2. commended in Josiah, 2 King. 22.19, 20. and David, 1 Samuel 24.5. 2 Samuel 24.10. and in Ephraim, Jer. 31.19. and in the Publican, Luke
18.13.

Quest. But is there not a faulty tenderness of conscience?

Answ. Yes, as, 1. When one is so tender that he cannot endure to be touched
with a reproof; Prophecy to us smooth things, say they, Isa. 30.10. Give us of
your softest pillows, Ezekiel. 13.18. Such was Amaziah, Amos 7.10. and they, Jer.
38.4. and they, Act. 5.33. and 7.54. whereas the right tenderness is to be very
sensible of the evil of sin, and the danger thereof: and thereupon impatient of
the sin, but very patient of reproof, Psalm. 141.5. Act. 2.37.

2. When he is scrupulous. As when one has got gravel in his shoe, he cannot
set his foot on the ground without complaint. The Apostles rule will help such,
Romans 14.5. Let every one be fully persuaded in his own mind, i. e. rid himself
of unnecessary, and unprofitable scruples: unnecessary scruples are when a man
makes a stir about things wherein Gods word is silent, and makes sin where
the Scripture makes none: as the Priests did about going into the judgment
Hall, Joh. 18.28. lest they should be defiled ceremonially, but made no scruple
to defile themselves morally, by bringing upon them the guilt of innocent
blood. Again, they made a great scruple of putting the money into their holy
Corban, because it was the price of blood, but questioned not the giving money
for the same, and taking the blood it self upon themselves and children, Mat.
27.25. such are condemned by Christ, Matthew. 23.23. Mark 7.11.

Unnecessary and vain scruples the Apostle would have us lay aside, 1 Corinthians.
10.25. asking no question (in such cases) for conscience sake.

3. When he is of too facile, and flexible a spirit, so as to yield to every
one that counsels and entises him to sin: For this Ephraim was broken in
judgment, Hos. 5.11. Thus tenderhearted was Rehoboam, 2 Chronicles. 13.7. and
Zedekiah, Jer. 38.5.

4. When the conscience is weak and sickly, as Paul calls it, 1 Cor. 8.12. and
is easily cast down and discouraged. This was the disease of the stony ground,
it was so tender as to be offended at the Cross, Matthew. 13.21. Outwardly
tender, and inwardly hard: whereas the good ground was inwardly soft to give
rooting to the seed, but outwardly hardy to endure all weathers. This picks a
quarrel at the Gospel for some circumstances, Mark 7.2. Such was the conscience
of the mixed multitude, Numb. 11.4. and of the spies, Numb. 13.31. that started
at the ^ight of the Anakims, and would not have the people endanger themselves:
The properties of it are.

1. Its apt to scruple things lawful. It eats nothing but herbs, Romans 14.2.
2. It puzzles and perplexes it self about things of no great moment: as Days,
m^ats, etc. Col. 2.21. 3. Its apt to judge him, that upon better grounds is not
of his mind and practice, Romans 14.3. 4. He is apt to stumble, Romans 14.21. 5.
Or to be grieved, and distasted, Romans 14.21.
5. When the conscience is so awakened that it cannot take any more rest, Psalm.
77.^*3, 4. So Psalm* 51.3. my sin is ever before me, and Psalm. 38.17. This is
a sad and painful, if not sometimes also, a sinful tenderness, when the soul
sees nothing but sin, guilt, and misery in it self, nothing but anger, wrath
and frow^ in God, and no hopes of redemption by Christ, or of recovery by the
spirit of grace. But the right tenderness is that due proportion of sense in an
awakened conscience which labors to keep the soul guarded, and unmolested.
Taking up Jobs resolution, Job 27.6. This tenderness shows it self.

1. In respect of God: In every thing to which God is entitled, and has
interest in; Moses stands for an hoof, Exodus 10.26. Christ is tender for the
least tittle of the Law, Matthew. 5.18. He is all on a flame with the zeal of
Gods house, and would not endure to have it profaned in the least, Joh. 2.17.
Yea, 1. Principally he is tender of those things wherein Gods glory is
concerned, Joh. 17.18. and 8.49, 50. This makes a man regardless of self, in
respect of name, credit, family, estate, yea, and of life, Act. 20.24. so the
Martyrs: and Nehemiah, chapter 13.15, 18, 19. 2. He is tender in respect of Gods
truth, which must be bought, not sold. So was Paul, Gal. 2.11. So Rev. 2.2. He
shows his tenderness in retaining, and contending for old truths, and in taking
heed how he vents any new doctrines: So 2 Cor. 13.8. and 2.17. 2 Pet. 1.16. 3.
He is tender of whatsoever does proceed from God, as to submit to every command
of God, for he trembles at his Word, Isa. 66.2. So Christ, Luke 2.49. John
6.39. 4. He yields, melts, and breaks under any threat of Gods Word, or sense
of Gods displeasure: So Josiah, 2 King. 22.19. contrary in Jehoiakim, Jer.
36.24. 5. He much more yields and humbles himself under the afflicting hand of
God: He comes forth of the furnace, like gold, all melted, and refined, Job
23.10. and 42.6. whereas others walk contrary to God, Lev. 26.41. 6. He kindly
thaws, and melts under the sense of the free favor, and abundant love of God,
as the ice before the warm Sun. So, Ezra 9.14. This was the gracious temper of
that poor woman, Luke 7.38. so we are required, Hos. 3.5.


2. In respect of men, this tenderness must show it self to all in general, and
to each in particular: To the godly, to the wicked; to strong, to weak.

1. To the godly: and that, 1. By not grieving them, and forbearing to offend
them: He is ever tender of the peace, and studious of the satisfaction of every
honest man. If his meat, apparel, hair, company, etc. make his brother to
offend, he will eat no such meat, wear no such apparel, or hair, keep no such
company whilst the world stands, rather then to make his brother offend, 1
Cor. 8.13. 2. He is tender of their reputation, not to expose them, or rather
Religion in them, to reproach. So Joseph would not bring a reproach upon Mary,
Mat. 1.19. 3. He is tender of disagreeing with, or dividing from any that is
godly, upon unnecessary and frivilous grounds. Enters not upon doubtful
disputations; falls not out about questions that nourish jangling, but destroy
edification: the common sin of our times: contrary to the Apostles precept,
Ephesians. 4.13, 32. 4. He is especially tender of weak Christians, no ways to
discourage them, despise them; or impose any burdens, much less to lay
stumbling blocks before them: but to bear their infirmities, Romans 15.1. To
condescend to their terms, Romans 12.16. This makes us like Christ, who is tender
of all his little ones, Mat. 8.17. Isa. 40.11. Mat. 12.18, 19. Luke 22.27.
2. To the wicked, who must see that we are tender of his good, more then he is
of his own. So, 2 Timothy 2.26. 1 Pet. 2.15. and we are to endeavor to take away
occasion from them that seek it to speak reproachfully of us, 1 Timothy 5.14. 3.
We must be tender of the good of those that are nearest to us: that we, and our
houses may serve the Lord, Jos. 24.15. So, Job 1.5. and Paul of the
Corinthians, whom he had espoused to Christ, 2 Cor. 11.2. and 6.11.
3. In respect of self: and that,

1. In respect of sin already committed: for which his heart smites him, 1 Samuel
24.5. 2 Samuel 24.10. and gives him no rest till he has made his peace with God
by repentance, and with man by restitution, or other satisfaction: as, Zacheus,
Luke 19.8.

2. In respect of sin not yet committed: He fears and departs from evil, and
shuns all occasions and provocations tending to it. So Joseph, Genesis 39.9.

3. He shuns small as well as great sins: He will not be found, no not in an
officious lie: as Gehazi's was, 2 Kings 5.25. Flies lesser oaths, Eccles. 9.2.
idle words, Matthew. 12.36. wanton looks, vain thoughts, etc.

4. He flies secret sins as well as open, and is most known by his closet,
and solitary carriage: He says with David, Psalm 44.21. Shall not God search
this out?

5. He shuns as well sinful omissions, as sinful commissions, as knowing that
in the day of judgment these will be charged upon him, Mat. 25.42. Omissions
are sins that bring a curse, Mat. 2.10. the slothful servant is called an evil
servant, Mat. 35.26, 30. negative holiness will not commend us to God, though
it may to man.

6. He flies and avoids the common sins and prevailing errors of the times: So
did Nehemiah reform the profanation of the Sabbath, and usury, Neh. 10.31. and
13.15. to 23. and 5.9, etc.

7. He flies as well all sinful occasions as actions: He keeps out of the way,
and and company of wicked men, Psalm. 1.1. Eccl. 7.26. For, Prove. 6.27, 28.
Judas took no hurt amongst the Disciples, but going to the High Priests, he was
for ever lost. Peter took no hurt in the garden, but in the High Priests Hall
was ensnared. Din^h walking out to see the daughters of the Hivites, and
Sampson to see the daughters of the Philistines, neither of them returned so
well as they went out. Many now adays by leaving Ministers, Ordinances,
Assemblies, etc. have made themselves a prey to seducers, and have been
corrupted: Hence, 1 John 2.19.

8. He flies not only what is simply evil, but whatsoever has an appearance of
evil: as he is commanded, 1 These. 5.22. Romans 12.2. Phil. 4.8. Ephesians. 5.3, 4, 11.

9. As he flies whatsoever has an appearance of evil, so he dares not always
trust whatsoever has an appearance of good. He therefore tries all things, and
holds fast only what is good, 1 These. 5.21. knowing what Christ says, Luke
16.15. That which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight
of God. He suspects that action, person, and state of life of which all men
speak well: He still knows that Satan deceives more easily, and destroys more
dangerously when he assumes the shape of an Angel of light. Hence we are
commanded to mistrust many things, 2 These. 2.2. Revel. 2.2. Gal. 1.6. 2 Peter
2.1. Matthew. 24.24. 1 John 4.1.

10. He takes heed even of what he knows to be lawful: He dares not do all that
he may do, knowing that he that will do all he may, often does more then he
ought, 1 Cor. 6.12. and 10.23. In use of things lawful he observes three rules.

1. It may be lawful, but is it expedient? when? how much? how far? and how
often is it expedient? 2. It is lawful, but will it edify, or offend? 3. Its
lawful, but I must not suffer my self to be brought under the power of any
thing though lawful: He knows its a true saying, Licitis perimus omnes: all the
world is undone by lawful things abused, and mistimed. It was the undoing of
the old world, and Sodom, Mat. 29.38. Luke 17.27, 28.
11. He dares not do always what is in his power. Joseph did not what he might
have done to his unkind brethren, Genesis 42.18.

12. Nor dare he do what others have familiarly done before him in his place:
So, Nehemiah, chapter 5.14, etc.

13. He does not only avoid sinful actions, but takes sad notice of, and
bewails his sinful affections, and the depraved disposition of his nature. He
mourns under the sin that dwells in him, Romans 7.20, 23, 24. He would neither
have his sin reign, nor remain in him: He hates his sin in every degree with a
perfect, and impartial hatred.

14. He ever rather consults with honesty, justice, and duty, then with honor,
commodity, and safety: If he once engages, he changes not, though it be to
his prejudice, Psalm. 15.4.

15. He alone, in the cause of Christ and Religion, dares stand it out against
the whole world. Unus Athanasius contra totum mundum; and so did Luther,
regarding neither the favor, nor the frowns of his adversaries. He considers
not so much the danger that lies before him, as the duty and necessity that
lies upon him, to appear in such a time and cause. So Elijah, 1 King. 19.10.

Dan. 3.16. We are not careful to answer thee, O King, in this matter. This is
commended by Peter, 1 Pet. 2.19, 20. and truly without this all other things
are nothing: not the conscience of faith, purity, sincerity, etc. This
commended the Christians of old times: they were content to be bound, that
truth might be at liberty, and to die, that religion might not die.

Quest. But can all that suffer say that they suffer for Conscience, and for
God?

Answ. No, there are four kinds of sufferings, which a good conscience can have
no comfort in.

1. When we put our selves upon voluntary, and arbitrary sufferings, and then
place religion and conscience in it: as the Baalites of old, who cut and lanced
themselves, 1 King. 18.28. and the Circumcelions of later time. But who
required these things at their hands? they cannot say with Saint Paul, They
bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in their bodies, Gal. 6.17. but rather the
marks of their own folly, and rashness.

2. When we pull upon our selves unnecessary and unwarrantable sufferings, by a
preposterous, and precipitate meddling in businesses out of our way and calling:
This is to suffer as busy bodies in other men's matters. Not as a Christian, 1
Pet. 4.15, 16.

3. When we pull upon our selves deserved sufferings from the hand of Justice
for our evil doings. These may say with the Thief, Luke 23.41. we suffer
justly, etc. These (like Zimri) are burnt with fire which their own hands have
kindled.

4. When we bring our selves into worse sufferings then any of the former, viz.
sufferings in conscience and from conscience, by shunning any other sufferings
for God and conscience: as Judas, Spira, etc. These are run from the fear, and
are fallen into the pit, Isa. 24.18. The first of these sufferings are foolish,
the second sinful; the third shameful; and the last dreadful.

Quest. What rules then are to be observed in the sufferings of a good
conscience?

Answ. First, see that thy sufferings be ever, and only for well-doing. As thou
must not shun sufferings by choosing evil, so thou must not seek, and procure
Pet. 2.15. A good conscience must not go out of Gods way to meet with
sufferings, nor out of sufferings way to meet with sin. Its not Poena but
Causa: the cause, not the punishment which makes a Martyr.

2. If thou suffer for ill-doing, yet be sure that it be wrongfully, 1 Pet.
Mat. 5.11. that thy conscience may say, we are as deceivers, yet true, as
unknown, yet well konwn to God, 2 Cor. 6.9, 10.

Thirdly, if thou desire chiefly, and especially to suffer in the cause, and
for Daniel was careful to carry himself unreprovably, but in the matters of God
he cared not what he suffered, Dan. 6.14, 5. Life as it is too little worth to
be laid out for Christ, so its too precious to be laid out in any other cause.
Its an honor if we can call our sufferings, the sufferings of Christ, Col.
2.24. and our scarrs, the marks of the Lord Jesus, Gal. 6.17. and can subscribe
our selves, the prisoners of Christ, Ephesians. 3.1.

Fourthly, if thou love to see the ground thou go upon: that thy cause be
clear, the grounds manifest, that thou be not thrust forward by a turbulent
I suffer according to the will of God, 1 Pet. 4.19.

Fifthly, if thou be careful not only that the matter be good, but that the
Pet. 2.19, etc. If thou suffer wrongfullly, yet thou must suffer patiently.
This is to suffer as Christ suffered, 1 Pet. 2.21, 22, 23.

Sixthly, if thou committest thy self in thy sufferings to God in well-doing,
Pet. 4.19. suffering times must not be sinning times: He is no good Martyr that
is not a good Saint. A good cause, a good conscience, a good life, a good
death, a good matter to suffer for, a good manner to suffer in, make an
honorable Martyr.

Tenthly, a conscience of charity. This the Apostle speaks of as the end, and
perfection of the Law, and Gospel too* 1 Timothy 1.5. where there is the truth of

1. External, or civil, which respects

1. The poor to whom is to be showed the charity of beneficence. 2. To the
neighbor and friend, a love of benevolence. And, 3. To the enemy a love of
forgiveness.

1. To the poor a love of beneficence, and well-doing: this kind of charity is
the worlds grand benefactor: the poors great Almoner: the widows Treasurer: the
Orphans Guardian: and the oppressed man's Patron: This lends eyes to the blind,
feet to the lame, deals out bread to the hungry, clothes the naked, and brings
upon the Donor the blessing of him that was ready to perish. This Zacheus
showed, Luke 19.8. and Job Chap. 30.12, etc. and Obadiah, 1 King. 18.13. and
Nehemiah, Chap. 5.15. Hence Psalm. 112.5. Prove. 31.20, 26. So Cornelius, Acts
10.2, 4. Isa. 32.8.

2. To our neighbors must be showed the charity of benevolence: we must love
them as our selves, Matthew. 22.39. Romans 13.8. For Prove. 18.24. He that has a
friend, must show himself friendly. Its a pleasant thing to see friends and
neighbors living in this mutual love, and benevolence, Psalm. 133.1. etc.

3. To our enemies a love of forgiveness. This is the hardest, and therefore
the highest pitch of love: a lesson only to be learned in the School of Christ.
The Pharisees taught otherwise, which Christ labored to reform, Matthew. 5.46.
Luke 6.32.33. This makes us like our Father in Heaven, who is kind to the
thankful, and unkind, Luke, 6.35. and like his Son on Earth, who prayed for
his enemies. This we are exhorted to, Col. 3.12, 13.

2. Spiritual, or Ecclesiastical, which is to be showed in the love we bear
to the Church and truth of Christ, and to the souls of our brethren. This
Charity is to be preferred before all the former: the former may be amongst
Heathens, and civilized Christians, but this is the peculiar badg of the people
of God: A love of Symphonie in judgment, and opinion: of Sympathy in heart, and
affection, and of Symmetrie, or Harmony in an offensive conversation: This is
often, and earnestly pressed, Phil. 2.1, etc. 1 Pet. 3.8. Its the end of the
Law, the adorning of the Gospel: the lively Image of God, and of Christ: the
first fruit of the Spirit: the daughter of Faith: the Mother of hope: the
sister of peace: the kinswoman of truth: the life and joy of Angels: the bane
of Devils: Its the death of Dissentions: the grave of Schisms, wherein all
Church rupture, and offenses are buried, 1 John 4.8, 16. Joh. 13.34. Gal.
5.22.6. Yea, its the very bond of perfection, Col. 3.14. and that which covers
all sins, 1 Pet. 4.8.

Quest. What is the excellency, and benefit of a good Conscience?

Answ. First, The excellency of it appears in the honorable titles given to

1. It has this proper denomination given it ordinarily of a good Conscience,
Act. 23.19. 1 Timothy 1.15. 1 Pet. 3.16, 21. whereas other graces, though
excellent in their place, and kind are seldom so called. Where do we read of
good Faith, good Love, Holiness, etc. whereas Conscience is good of it self,
and makes the good Faith, the good Love, the good repentance, etc. which all
cease to be good when severed from the good conscience. Again, compare it with
all other good things, and it has the better of them, what good is there in a
chest full of goods, when the Conscience is empty of goodness? Quid prodest
plena bonis Area, si inanis sit Conscientia? said St. Austin, What if he has
good wares in his shop, a good stock in his ground, good clothes to his back,
etc. if he has not a good Conscience in his heart? This man is like Naaman, a
rich and honorable man, but a Leper. What are all great parts, and abilities,
without a good Conscience? but as sweet flowers upon a stinking carcass. Its
above all Faith alone, therefore they often go together in Scripture, 1 Timothy 1.5,
19. and 3.9. If this be put away Faith is shipwract. Nothing profits alone
without this; not Baptism, 1 Pet. 3.21. not Charity, 1 Timothy 1.5. not coming to
the Lords Supper, Heb. 10.22. not any serving of God, 2 Timothy 1.3. not obedience
to Magistrates,, Romans 13.5. not all our sufferings, 1 Pet. 2.19, 20. Let all
duties be performed, and Conscience nor regarded, and the man is but an
Hypocrite. Let all gifts remain, and profession stay, and the man is but an
Apostate. Hence Bernard, Vtilius est currere ad conscientiam, quam ad
sapientiam, nisi eadem sit sapientia quae conscientia. Its better running to
Conscience then to all your wisdom, unless you mean by your wisdom nothing but
Conscience. The unlearned man with a good conscience (says Saint Austin) will
go to Heaven, when thou with all thy Learning shall be cast into Hell. Surgunt
indocti and rapiunt regnum Coelorum, etc.

2. Its absolutely necessary to the very being of a Christian, whereas many
other things serve only to his better being. To suppose a Christian without
Conscience, were to suppose the Sun without light, and fire without heat. Its
of the very same consequence to spiritual life, as the sense of feeling is to
natural life, which has the pre-eminence of all other senses: For 1. Feeling
is the first sense in being: So is Conscience in the new Creature. 2. Feeling
is of absolute necessity. If a man want that, he is a dead man: So is
Conscience absolutely necessary to the very being of a Christian: A man may be
short in parts, weak in duties, defective in knowledge, and yet be a good
Christian: but if he has lost his Conscience, he is altogether dead. 3. Many
creatures excel man in other senses: but in feeling man excells most other: So
the best Christian excells in the tenderest, and quickest touch of Conscience.
4. Other senses have a particular Organ of their own, and lie in a narrow room:
as hearing in the ear, seeing in the eye, etc. but feeling is extended all the
body over, both within, and without. So is Conscience of a vast, and universal
extent over all our actions, intents, words, and motions from first to last.
Faith looks to promises: Fear to Threats: Hope to futures: Obedience to duties:
Repentance to sins, etc. but Conscience looks to all.


3. It most fortifies the soul with strength against, and gives victory over
all Adversaries. Its like the Ark with a window in the top to let in light from
Heaven. Like Elias Mantle, it divides the waters, and carries the godly soul^
through a flood of miseries as on dry Land. It encourages in the midst of
fire, and fagots, accompanies into Dens, and Caves, and made the Martyrs sing
in Dungeons, and flames. Its like the Anvile that breaks whatsoever is beaten
on it, but is it self by all strokes made more firm. It makes a man like a
brazen wall, Jer. 1.18. Its devoid of fear, as Job 5.22. It will encourage a
man to hold up his head before any judgment seat, Act. 23.1. yea, before Gods
Tribunal. 1 John 3.21. A cheerful Conscience makes a cheerful countenance,
Prove. 15 13. Tranquilla conscientia, tranquilla omnia.

4. It annoints the head with oil, and makes the cup run over with joy, and
consolation. Good Conscience's peace, is the peace that passes all
understanding. It makes a Heaven upon Earth: Its a continual feast, Prove.
15.15. the stranger intermeddles not with his joy. His feast is above
Ahasuerus's, Est. 1, 4. Its the greatest good a man can have, and the procurer,
and maintainer of all the good that a man is capable of here. Its the only
Paradise that God loves to walk in: the only Throne which Christ sits in: the
only Temple which the holy Ghost dwells in: the golden pot which the hidden
Manna is kept in: the white stone which the new name is written in, etc.

5. Its not only a real good it self, but makes all other things better where
it has to do, whence it deserves the title of a good Conscience. Riches,
Honor, Learning, etc. are not good really, but only in opinion, nor do you
alone make any man the better: But a good Conscience makes all good, and good
better where it comes. It finds some sinful, and leaves them holy: proud and
leaves them humble: covetous, and leaves them content, etc. It mends
Magistrates, Ministers, poor, rich, yea all. Its the treasury of good, and
therefore brings out nothing but what is good. Good communication, good
conversation: yea it makes actions indifferent in their own nature to become
good, and actions good to become better.

Quest. What is the danger, and mischief of an evil Conscience?

Answ. First, Here commonly is the first decay of a Christian. Hymeneus,
Alexander first put away a good Conscience, and then sunk in their Faith, 1 Timothy 1.20. when the Conscience is once corrupt, then presently so is the
judgment, then the affections, then the life, and then all. Corruption in the
Conscience is like poison in the Spring head. No man aims at the height of
impiety at once; and this is commonly the first step, when Conscience likes not
to retain the knowledge of God, he gives up to vile affections, then to a
reprobate mind, and at last to be filled with all manner of unrighteousness,
Romans 1.26, 28, 29. A hopeful professor by this means soon becomes a
dangerous Apostate, and at last a downright Atheist, Tit. 1.15, 16. The Sun
beginning to set in Conscience, night hastens on in the affections: Then
farewell grace: and when the Sun goes back in the heaven of Conscience, the
shadow goes back many degrees in the Dial of Comfort, then farewell peace.

Secondly, As the first decay usually begins here, so it proves the worst, and
Paul tells of some that had given themselves over to lasciviousness, etc.
Ephesians. 4.19. but they came to this height of impiety by blinding their minds,
and deadning their Consciences. In the last days many depart from the Faith,
and give heed to seducing spirits, etc. 1 Timothy 4.1. but they first feared their
Consciences, ver. 2. Its the ready, yea the only way to the sin against the
holy Ghost.

Job 9.4. If Conscience be disregarded in his two first Offices, he will be
known in his two last. If his ministerial reproofs, and Magistraticall rods be
slighted: He will as a witness, and a Judge, chasten thee with Scorpions.

Zach. 11.9. Rev. 22.11. 2 These. 2.10, 11, 12.

Quest. Is it so hard then to get, and keep a good conscience, and to escape a
bad?

Answ. Yes truly, as will appear in these three respects.

First, in respect of Satan, all whose spite is at a good Conscience, and all
his Pharaoh his Kingdom: nor Achithophel his policy: nor Absolon his beauty:
nor Haman his honor, and Offices, nor Dives his wealth, etc. he could make use
of all: yea he will offer his help to men to get these things, so they will
quit a good Conscience. But if a man be plundered of all his estate, and
stormed out of all his outworks of his riches, friends, children, power,
places: yea, out of his nearer comforts, out of his Faith, and hope: out of his
prayers, and promises, if he retreat to a good Conscience, and make good this
last refuge, Satan will be repelled with shame, and loss. Job when he had lost
all else, manfully defending this piece, he recovered all again at last, and
his last state was double to his first, Job 42.12, 13.

Secondly, In respect of thy self, or the work it self, thou shall find it a
hard Acts 24.16. Herein exercise I my self always, etc. i. e. I use all my
skill, diligence, and constancy together, (...).

Thirdly, In respect of others its still more difficult: many miscarry in it:
Tim. 1.19.

Quest. May a man's Conscience be quiet, yet not good?

Answ. Yea, there are four sorts of quiet Consciences, and never a one of them
good:

First, An ignorant Conscience: For as a blind man eats many a hair, and
drinks many a fly: so these know not that they do evil, and therefore are not
disquieted, but commit all uncleanness with greediness, Ephesians. 4.18, 19.
Abimelech boasts much of his integrity, Genesis 20.4, 5. when it was but morality,
or ignorance, therefore glory not of such a blind, deaf, and silent
Conscience: the dumb and deaf Devil was hardest to be cast out, Mar. 9.25,
26, 29.

Secondly, A Conscience that was never yet well awakened: But sin lies Jer.
51.39, 40. Or else it will awake, and cry out like a traveling woman, it will
destroy, and devour at once, Isa. 42.14. the Consciences of Joseph's brethren
were long asleep, but awaked at last, and made them tremble: So with Jonas, chapter
2.2.

Thirdly, A deluded Conscience, by Satan, or his instruments, which dreams Luke
11.21. when the strong man armed keeps possession, all is at peace, Lam. 2.14.
Ahab deluded speaks of nothing but peace, 1 Kin. 22.27. So Zach. 1.11. many
live and dye in this condition: the world says, they dye like Lambs, Psalm.
73.4. when its tather like Solomon's Ox, Prove. 7.22. So Jer. 51.38, 39. But its
better to dye the most dreadful death of the righteous, then the most
hopeful, and peaceful death of the wicked. These dye so securely, not because
the sting of death is taken out, which were their happiness, but because the
Conscience is taken out, which is their misery.

Fourthly, A hardened Conscience; This treasures up wrath against the day Romans
2.4, 5. Job 36.13. there is no greater plague on earth then this, no judgment
in Hell beyond it.

Quest. How manifold is this hardness of heart?

Answ. Its sixfold, as appears by the several expressions in Pharaohs
hard-heartedness: as

1. A natural hardness, and insensibleness of Conscience, which is part of
the sin, and punishment of Original sin, which is alike in all: called the
heart of stone, Ezekiel. 36.25.

2. An attracted, and acquired hardness, through frequent reiterations of sin,
and the secret curse of God upon it. Hence, Heb. 3.13. Ephesians. 4.17, 18, 19.
where are eleven steps by which the poor soul goes to hell: as 1. Vanity of
mind, wherein men think there is little hurt, but its the first step to Hell.
2. Darkness of understanding, which follows the former. 3. Alienation from the
life of God, Alienation actively on their part, they loathing God, a sinful
alienation: and passively on Gods part, his soul loathing them, a judicial
alienation. 4. Blindness of ignorance, one sin begetting another in
infinitum. 5. This blindness leads to further hardness, viz. judicial,
because of the hardness of their heart. 6. Then they are insensible, and past
feeling. 7. Then desperate, giving themselves over to sin, as Ahab, 1 Kin.
21.25. then they are quite lost. 8. Then they are brutish, turned into beasts,
they give themselves over to lasciviousness. So, 2 Pet. 2.14. Jer. 5.8. Romans
13.13. Philip. 3.19. 9. Then they work uncleanness: they draw sin with
Cartropes, etc. Isa. 5.18. 10. Then they are insatiable in sinning. So, Romans
1.23, 25. 11. Then the delight in it, committing all uncleanness with
greediness. Thus a man is trasnformed into a beast at first, and into a Devil
at last.


3. A judicial hardness, as

Then the Conscience, or heart is further hardened by Impostors, or Seducers.
So, Exodus 7.22. God gives them over to strong delusions to believe a lie, 2
These. 2.11. Hence God is said to lay a stumbling block before Apostates, Ezekiel.
3.20. to deceive false Prophets, Ezekiel. 14.9. and to put a lying spirit into
their mouths* 1 King. 22.23.

4. A Ministerial hardening. God lets them enjoy the Gospel, and means of
grace, but they having added to natural, voluntary hardness of heart, and to
contempt of the truth, a love of Error, God sends leanness of soul, under
fatness of Orninances: Hence Isai. 6.9, 10. then preaching proves the savor
of death, 2 Cor. 2.16. So Pharaoh grew worse and worse under Moses Ministry.

5. A Divine hardening: a penal hardening by Divine vengeance: called Gods
sending all his plagues upon the heart, Exodus 9.14. A heart hardened by the
curse of God is an Epitome of all plagues in the world, yea of all the plagues
of Hell. Yet here in God does not infundere malitiam, pour in malice, but non
infundere mollitiem, not put in softness. Hence, Romans 1.28.

6. A Satanicall hardening: Indeed Satan has his first, or second hand in
every sinful act, and an hand from the first hardening to the last. He
persuades, and prevails, 1 King. 22.22.

Quest. What are the marks of an ill troubled Conscience?

Answ. First, Troubles are then evil, when the root whence they spring is
evil. Thus Ahab was troubled till he was sick, not because his lust of
covetousness was unmortified, but because it was unsatisfied. So was Ammon. So,
Prove. 4.16. Some cannot sleep if they have done no mischief all day. This is
indeed the Devils trouble, and Hell is full of such troubled spirits.

Ahab, 1 Kin. 21.2.7. So Caine, Judas, Simon Magus, Act. 8.24. This is to be
troubled for Hell, not for sin.

Thirdly, When the carriage under troubles is evil, then its an evil

1. When men rage, and swell under Gods stroke, but their uncircumcised hearts
accept not of the punishment of their iniquity: So Caine stormed at his
punishment. So, Isa. 8.21, 22.

2. When notwithstanding their troubles they still go on in sin. Felix
trembled, but it wrought no good upon him, Act. 24.27. Jeroboam, 1 King. 12.33.
he was ill, but Ahaz was worse after judgments upon them, 2 Chro. 28.22. So,
Rev. 16.11. and 9.20.

3. Then troubles are evil, whose cure is evil, or when an evil course is
taken for their removal: as 1. When men fly to outward means to remove inward
grief, but go not to to God, as Caine, to traveling, and building of Cities.
Saul to David's Music. An ill diversion does but prorogue, not cure the
disease. 2. Wen they rest in the outward use, and observation of religious
means, without an inward change of heart, and through reformation of life: Ahab
humbled himself, fasts, mourns, etc, yet Ahab is Ahab still. Judas was full of
inward horror, confesses, and makes restitution, but goes not penitentially
to God, and fiducially to Jesus Christ. Jeremy therefore calls this a gadding:
its not a penitential returning, Jer. 2.36. 3. When men have recourse to
Diabolical, and sinful means: as Saul to the Witch: 1 Samuel 28.7, 8. Ahaziah
to Baal-zebub, 2 Kin. 1.2. Belshazzar to his Magitians, Dan. 5.7. So, 47.12,
13. 4. When men dispairingly give over all our hopes, and use of means, saying,
there is no hope, Jer. 2.25. and 18.12. This putting away all mercy is worse
then all the former. This was Cains case: I am sentenced, I must be damned: God
has not mercy for me, I will ask him none. This is a wilful casting away of
a man's self: This evil is of the Lord, 2 Kin. 6.33. why should I wait, or
pray, or repent, etc. This is to forsake our own mercies, Jonah, 2.8.


Quest. How may we know a good troubled conscience?

Answ. First, When our trouble is rather for our sins, then our sufferings:
when we cry out of our sins: as Lam. 5.16. So Jer. 31.19. Ephraim

Secondly, When in this condition we confess, bewail, and lament our sins, as
David, Psalm. 51.3. So, Job 7.20. and 3, 4.

Thirdly, When after this we forsake it, Prove. 28.13. such shall have mercy.

Fourthly, When we do not only forsake it as to the outward act, but the hides
pride from man, Job 33.17. when we can say, sin is more bitter then death,
Eccless. 7.26.

Fifthly, When upon this the heart is carried out to seek after Christ for
rest, Matthew. 11.29. when we go to this Fountain to wash away sin, Zach. 13.1.
Joh. 3.14, 15.

Sixthly, When after this the Conscience is made more watchful, and tender,
Job 34.31, 32.

Quest. What are the marks of an erroneous Conscience?

Answ. First, When it leaves the Word, which is the standing Rule to rectify
Conscience by, and prefers Traditions, or some humane invention before an
express Precept. So, Matthew. 15.13.

Secondly, When we leave the waters of Siloah, the holy Scriptures, which Deuteronomy.
13.3. Dan. 11.35. Erroneous Conscience imputes his success to his cause, and
his cause prospering, he styles Gods cause: This was Rabshakeh's Divinity, Isa.
36.10. and of the Chaldeans, Hab. 1.11. Such say, as Jer. 50 7. we offend not,
because they have sinned, and we have prevailed. Solomon tells us, we can
conclude nothing certainly from hence, Eccles. 9.1.2, 11. and 7.15. and 8.14,
ult.

King. 13.18. Now all divine revelations coming from the Spirit of Truth, are
ever consonant to the word of truth, which is the rule to try all revelations
by, 2 Pet. 1.19.

Fourthly, It prefers a strong impulse from his own thoughts, before Gods own
Jer. 7.31. God said, that it never came into his mind to approve of what they
did, yet they would do it, because it was their Conscience, and came into
their mind. But these impulses, though coming from a gracious Spirit, can be no
rule: as we see in David's impulse to build God an house, 2 Samuel 7.2, 3. so to
be revenged on Nabal, 1 Samuel 25.22. Prove. 28.26. He that trusts his own
heart is a fool. Hence, Job 15.31. Its trusting to vanity.

The time is not come (say they) to build Gods house, therefore its not our
duty, Hag. 1.2. but this is a sluggards Conscience, when he pretends a Lion in
the way, Prove. 26.13.

Job 13.7. Our Rule is, not to do the least evil to gain the greatest
beneficial good, or to avoid the greatest penal evil, Romans 3.8.

Seventhly, Its so confident that it dares appeal to God to patronise his
exorbitancies, Joh. 16.2. they thought they did God the best service, when they
did the Church the greatest disservice. So. Phil. 3.6. Paul out of zeal
persecuted the Church. So, Act. 23.12.

Quest. What motives may quicken us to get, and retain a good Conscience?

Answ. First, Remember that God weighs, and tries the Conscience, Prove.
16.2. So much of Conscience as is in a man, or duty, or action, or suffering,
so much of thanks, and esteem with God: So much Conscience as thou have toward
God, So much comfort is coming to thee from God.

Secondly, If Conscience be wanting, thou will suffer loss of all thou have, of
when you fasted was it not to your selves, etc? Ananias lost his cost when he
had been at so great charges: Alexander his reward when he had suffered so
much: Judas lost all after he had followed Christ so long, and preached to
others so often.

Thirdly, A good Conscience leads a man to perfect, and complete happiness

1. In this world its the only way to a good, and blessed life: and that 1. In
prosperity it will be as an hedge about all thou have, as the Candle of the
Lord in thy Tabernacle. 2. In adversity, it will be as the good houswifes
candle, that goes not out by night. Or like Isreal's Pillar of fire, it will not
leave thee in a wilderness. As Ruth to Naomi: or Ittai to David, 2 Samuel 15.21.
It will in all make thee more then a conqueror, Romans 8.37. its a man's dearest,
and closest friend that will visit him in prison, etc. 3. In death: it gives
rejoicing when under the stroke, and sentence of death. Its like Saul and
Jonathan, lovely in life, and in death not divided.


2. In the world to come: It will stand a man instead when he appears before
the great Tribunal of God, where courage dares not show its face: nor
eloquence open its mouth: nor Majesty has any respect: nor greatness any
favor: where money bears no mastery: as that Martyr said, Rev. 6.15, 16. Hence,
1 John 3.20, 21. Yea, its the step to the highest glory, and its the stare of
highest Beatitude. To be feasted with the fruits of a good Conscience, is
Angels food, and some of the sweet meats of Heaven: as a tormenting Conscience
is one of the greatest miseries of Hell.

Fourthly, Consider the miseries of an evil Conscience in life, in death, and

1. In this life: In the midst of prosperity he can have no security, Job 20.
especially, verse 16, 17, 22, 23, 24. and 15.21. there is no torment like that
of an evil Conscience: It marred Belshazzars feast, etc.

2. But much more in adversity: then Conscience that had been long silent, and
quiet, cries out, and flies in the sinners face: as in Joseph's brethren. This
woe, though dreadful, yet is the least, because shortest, and ends in a few
days, or years: but

2. At death: which is a great woe, and double to the former: All the
sufferings in this life to the wicked, whether in body, or in spirit, are
nothing if compared with that which follows: yet this also has an end, at the
day of judgment: But then follows another.

3. At the day of judgment, when all the Cataracts of wrath are set open, all
the vials emptied out: then shall that sealed book of Conscience be unclasped,
and out of their own mouth, and heart, and book shall they be judged: then
shall a Hell in Conscience be cast into a Hell of despair, and an Hell of
guilt into a Hell of pain: and this judgment is called Eternal judgment, Heb.
6.2. and the destruction of the wicked, an Everlasting destruction, 2 These.
1.9. and this Eternity is a vast Ocean, that has neither bank nor botton: A
Center that has no Circumference: no measures of times, nor number of ages can
fathom, or reckon the length of it. In which Eternity thy evil Conscience
shall accompany thee, and fill thy heart with new tortures of grief, and fear,
and wrath, and bitterness, and despair.

Quest. What then are the means whereby a good Conscience may be gotten, and
preserved?

Answ. First, They are either principal, or subservient. First, principal,

1. To get the blood of Christ sprinkled upon the Conscience, by the hand of
Faith, Heb. 9.14. All duties, gifts, observances, etc. are nothing to this.
Other things may make the outside clean before men, but the blood of Christ is
that alone which makes the Conscience clean before God, that there is now no
more Conscience of sin, as to the guilt, and spot of it. So Heb. 10.29. the
blood of the Covenant is that whereby the believer is sanctified, Christ's
wounds are our City of Refuge: Christ's blood is the well of Bethlehem, which we
should long for, and break through an Host of difficulties to come unto. Except
we drink this blood we have no life in us, etc. Joh. 6.53, 54.

2. To seek, and get the Spirit of Christ, which is the next principal
ingredient in, or efficient of a good Conscience: Its Gods Spirit with our
spirits that makes the good Conscience, Romans 9.1. The single Testimony of
natural Conscien^ (...) not much to be regarded: but when Conscience is
cleared by the Spirit, and (...) with the Spirit, the Testimony of these two is
great, and weig^^^^ Gods Spirit thus witnessing to our Spirit is the clearest
testimony of our Adoption, and Salvation, Romans 8.16. Hence, 1 Cor. 2.10, 11,
12. So then where the Spirit of God is, there is a good Conscience.



1. Thou must get Faith to make thee a good Conscience, therefore Faith, and a
good Conscience are often joined together, Acts 15.9. Christ gives faith for
this end, to purify the Conscience: where faith is pure, the Conscience is
pure: this makes the good, and mends the bad Conscience. Now this Faith that
makes, and keeps a good Conscience, is three fold: 1. Justifying Faith: for
there must be apprehending, and applying the blood of Christ, Act. 15.9. For
(...) qua creditur, is Fides qua vivitur. Faith whereby we believe, is the
faith whereby we live. 2. Doctrinal Faith, 1 Timothy 1.19. For corrupt opinions,
breed corrupt consciences: and corruption in morals, usually follows corruption
in intellectuals: Here begins commonly the first step backward to all Apostasy,
and the first step forward to all impiety. 3. A particular warranting Faith to
legitimate our actions, which also may in some sense be called a justifying
Faith, not to justify our persons from all guilt, but our actions from sin:
Every action that is good in it self is hereby sanctified to the use of
Conscience by the word of God. So Romans 14.5, 23.


2. Repentance, and the daily renewall thereof is a second means: This ever
goes along with true Faith, Mar. 1.15. Hence this was the total sum of what
Paul taught: To repent and believe, Act. 20.21. So, Job 11.14, 15. Conscience
must shut all known sin out a doors, or sin will soon thrust Conscience out a
doors.

3. If thou would have a good Conscience, observe what hints thou have at
any time from Christ, and the Spirit. Good Conscience must observe the eye,
voice, beck, finger, and every motion of Christ. As its a fearful judgment to
fear where no fear is. So its a foul sin not to fear where fear should be,
Jer. 5.3. Thou have smitten them, and they have refused to receive correction,
etc. Hence, Prove. 29.1. they shall suddenly be destroyed. Peter by observing
these hints from Christ, recovered after he had denied him.

4. Listen attentively to the mutterings, and whisperings of thy own
Conscience: Take notice what news Conscience brings thee home every day:
Commune often with thy own heart, Psalm. 4.4. So did David, Psalm. 77.6. These
Soliloquies are our best disputes, and the most useful conferences. Observe
every day what were thy actions, what were thy passions: See what words fell
from thee, what purposes, and thoughts were in thee. Non venitur ad bonam
Conscientiam, nisi per Cordis custodiam. Bern.

5. Yet so we must hearken to, and confer with Conscience, as also to confer
Conscience with the Scripture: that's the Book of life, and according to that,
our Conscience must be copied, or corrected. Unicuique suus liber est
Conscientia, Bern. Search the Scriptures, and trust not thine own judgment too
far. This rule well observed, would resolve what is to be done in many cases:
most men, whatsoever their opinion, and practice is, plead Conscience,
Conscience: Its my Conscience say they, my Conscience bids me do thus: I, but
what does God bid Conscience do? Had Adam never fallen, we should have needed
none other rule, but our own Consciences? But now we have a Law written, and
proclaimed, we must not make conscience the supreme Law, but the subordinate.
^deed Conscience is to have a negative voice, so that nothing is to be done
without his assent, and good liking: but it must not Challenge an arbitrary,
and illimited power to act, or determine any thing without the advice of this
great Council, the Law, and the Prophets.

6. Prayer is a great friend to good Conscience: the good Conscience makes many
a good Prayer: there is the particular demand of a good Conscience, 1 Pet. ^
21. which B^za understands of Prayer. Good Conscience has ever one eye upon
God to observe his precepts, and the other up to God to beg his direction:
usually such as are most frequent in prayer have the best Consciences: Acts
10.2. Cornelius. Hypocrites do not so, Job 27.10. and 21.14, 15.

7. Beware of committing the smallest sins, yea of many things which go for
lawful: the least spark may consume the greatest house, the least leak, the
greatest ship. Call not Faith, and troth small Oaths, they are more then yea,
and nay. Refrain idle words, rash anger, vain mirth foolish jesting, etc. The
greatest spoil made in Conscience, had at first but small beginnings. Qui
otiosum verbum non reprimit, ad noxia cito transit: and vanus sermo est vanae
Conscientiae index.

8. Take heed of adventring, though but upon one greater sinful act: lest it
for ever shut Conscience out of doors: One deliberate act of sin, threw the
Angels out of Heaven: that one sin deliberately committed by our first Parents
against an express precept cast them out of Paradise. So in Judas, Ananias, and
Saphira, etc.

9. Take heed of living under, and contenting thy self with a cold,
man-pleasing Ministry, which sows pillows under thine Armholes, crying Peace,
peace. The voice of a faithful Preacher is the voice of a Crier, Isa. 40.3. His
found, the sound of a Trumpet, Isa. 58.1. His words like sharp nails, etc.
Eccl. 12.11. So, Mal. 3.2. Isa. 11.4, 10. Take great heed whom thou choosest
for thy bosom friend: Ill acquaintance has undon many. One sinner destroys
much good: One corrupt man, corrupts another, 2 Samuel 13.3.

10. In things doubtful, be well advised, or forbear, and take the surer, and
safer way. Some defend Usury, Cards, Dice, long hair, naked necks, etc. But
most condemn them. Judge what is safest, and let these be thy rules to judge
by, Ephesians. 5.11. Phil. 4.8.

11. Take heed of worldly mindedness: there is no greater enemy to Conscience:
These Thorns choke the best seeds of grace: and this Canker eats out the very
life of Conscience: For, for a piece of bread such an one will transgress: Such
will break their word, betray their trust, deceive their brother, falsify
their wares, weights, measures, lie for advantage: Riches and a good Conscience
seldom dwell under the same roof.

12. Take heed of an Erroneous Conscience: This is as wildfire in dry Corn: as
the wild Bore, or ravening Bear: as the wild Ass, Jer. 2.24. Many hopeful
Professors being once leavened with Error, do first in their hearts
undervalue, and contemn, and then with their mouths vilify, and disgrace those
faithful Ministers, whom they formerly magnified, and highly prized.

Mr. Sheffield in his accute, and accurate Treatise of Conscience.

Quest. What are the signs of a good Conscience, whereby it may be known?

Answ. First, It may be known by the causes of it: Its not the work of

Secondly, By the manner whereby it is wrought in us: For its not wrought by
worldly persuasions, taken from our credit, pleasure, profit, etc. but by the
Ministry of the word begetting faith in us whereby the heart is purified, and
this it does. 1. By terrifying with the sight and sense of our sin., and the
punishments due for the same, whereby we are humbled: and then, Secondly, by
pacifying, and comforting it; by offering to us in Christ the free pardon of
our sins, reconciliation with God, and the eternal salvation of our souls.

Psalm. 26.2. After which Audit, it will justify us in regard of our integrity,
as Ps. 17.3. Not in respect of the perfection of our performance, which is full
of wants and weaknesses; but of our desire and resolution, Psalm. 130.3. and
143.2.



1. As its peaceable, so also its pure, not only from the guilt of sin, but
also from the corruption. For the blood of Christ, as (like a sovereigne salve)
it pacifies the rage of conscience caused by the sores of sin: so it draws
out the corrupt matter that caused it, cleansing these wounds, Heb. 9.14.

2. With all care and circumspection it keeps it self clear both before God and
man, Act. 24.16. Before God from the faultiness of sin, and before men from
offensiveness, and all appearance of evil, 2 Cor. 4.2.

3. Its not doubtful, and wavering whether it be so or no, but being so, it
knows assuredly that it is so, and sees it self by its own light, Heb. 13.18.
Prove. 28.1. 1 John 3.19, 20, 21.

4. It makes them that have it, merry, cheerful, and full of joy: It Is a
continual Feast, It makes the hardest lodging a bed of down: A prison a
Palace, etc. Romans 5.3. Act. 16.25. Paul and Silas sang in the dungeon. So, 2
Cor. 1.12. It triumphs over death it self: Yea it chears the heart in the day
of judgment, as was said before.

Psalm. 119.6. Heb. 13.18. Its the same in all places and companies.

Mr. Downams Guide to Godliness,

Quest. How has original sin polluted every man's conscience?

Answ. First, by bringing a veil of ignorance upon it, whereby it horribly
mis-judgeth, calling good evil, and evil good, etc. Thus the consciences of
Heathens miserably enthralled them to the service of idols, as if they could
damn or save them. Thus some Heretics have thought that they served God by
doing most abominable and unnatural things. The Gnostics taught, that
fornication and uncleanness were often to be committed, so as to avoid all
conception, and if a child do follow they did follow, they draw it from the
womb, beat it in a mortar, seasoned it with honey and pepper, and so did eat
it, saying that in this manner they did celebrate the great Passover. The
Carp^cr^cians affirmed, that every one was bound to commit sin: and that the
souls were put into the bodies till they should fulfill the measure of their
iniquities, applying that in the Parable to this purpose: Thou shall not go out
till thou have paid the last farthing. The Montanists made a sacrifice of the
blood of an Infant of a year old, whom with needles in a most cruel manner they
pricked to death. They said also, that it was as great sin to pull a leaf from a
tree as to kill a man. The Donatists would throw themselves from mountains, and
drown themselves in rivers to make themselves Martyrs. Here was also a
voluntary contracted blindness upon their consciences, and a judicial,
inflicted on them by God: yet had there not been a natural blindness in their
consciences, they could never have been improved to such an height of impiety.

Secondly, its polluted, not only by the blindness, but by the stupidity, and

Quest. How is this blindness and stupidity of conscience discovered?

Answ. By the actings of it, in not performing those offices for which God has
put it into the soul^ as

1. One maine work of conscience is to apply in particular what we read in the
Scriptures, as generally spoken: when it reads the threats, and curses of the
Law denounced against such sins as thou art guilty of, then says conscience,
This belongs to me: Hence God gives the commands by particular application:
Thou shall not commit adultery, Thou shall not steal, etc. that conscience may
say, this command belongs to me: But if we read over the Scriptures a thousand
times, and hear so many Sermons, if conscience does not apply all becomes
ineffectual.

Object. How then can men commit those sins which they know to be sins, which
conscience tells them to be sins, seeing we cannot will evil as it is evil?

Answ. First, it arises from the defect of conscience, it not making
particularly pro hic, and nuns, as it should do: There is a general, and
habitual knowledge of such things to be sins; yea, it may be a particular
apprehension that they are now sinning and offending God; but its only a
speculative apprehension, its not a practical one produced by conscience in
them.

Secondly, herein the corruption of conscience is seen in that, though it does
Romans 1.18. such detain the truth in unrighteousness; they keep conscience a
prisoner that would gladly do its duty.

Thirdly, or if it do apply, yet its seldom, not daily and constantly: The Cock
Peter remembered himself: Conscience may apply sometimes, yet may the noise of
lusts drown the voice of it. Thus the consciences, even of natural men in some
fits, when they are in expectation of some great and eminent judgments, may
work strongly for the present, as of Pharaoh, Ahab, and Foelix: But this is a
flash only.

Fourthly, as conscience naturally does not its duty in applying, so neither in
a thousand witnesses: yea, and its a thousand tormentors too: But alas, its so
defiled, that in many things, if not in all, it fails, and gives at least no
true witness at all, as appears in that, if men can conceal their sins from
others, they matter not at all what witness conscience, and God can bear
against them.

Fifthly, the pollution of conscience will further appear by the actings of it
in Romans 2.15. As for its duty of accusing, its almost wholly silen^: and men
run into all excess of riot, embrace all wickedness their consciences scarce
smiting at all for it. Divines say, that its an exceeding great mercy of God
that he has left a conscience in man: for if that had not some actings, there
would be no humane societies: Conscience being a cu^b to them: but when its so
corrupted that it cannot do its office, what hope then remains for such? as we
see in the example of Joseph's brethren, Genesis 37.25. And as for the other act of
excusing, conscience is turned into a Camelion, to be like every object it
stands by: It excuses and flatters men in all they do: and makes them say, God
I thank thee, I am not like other men, etc. Luke 18.11. whereas, if conscience
were well enlightened by Gods Word, it would instead of excusing, accuse and
condemn.

Sixthly, conscience is further polluted in the actings of it: for when
application, Act. 2.37. they are said (...): to be pricked in their hearts, as
if a dagger had been stabbed in them: So it was with Foelix, Cain, Judas, etc.
Now conscience naturally is greatly polluted herein. For either it does not at
all give any blows, or if it do, its with slavish and tormenting thoughts,
which makes the sinner run from Christ, and indisposeth him for mercy and
comfort.

Seventhly, there should a tribunal be erected in every man's heart, wherein
Psalm. 4.4. we are commanded to commune with our own hearts: To search and try
our ways: To judge our selves that we be not judged, 1 Cor. 11.31. This the
very Heathen commended: Nosce teipsum, and tecum habita: and complain of the
neglect of it, In se nemo tentat descendere; and its frequently commanded in
Scripture as an introduction to conversion, and as a constant duty of the
converted to prevent Apostasy: But who is there that keeps this Court daily in
himself? who examines himself to say, what have I done? who calls his thoughts,
words, and actions to this Bar, and gives judgment against them? Now this
judgment of conscience is seen about a twofold object.

1. Our actions which are to be judged whether they are agreeable to the Word
of God, or no? For whatsoever we undertake, and are not persuaded of in
conscience as lawful, is a sin, Romans 14.23.

2. Our persons* and the frame and constitution of our souls: and herein
conscience is more unable to do its work then in the former: For actions (at
lest many of them) are condemned by the light of nature: but when we come to
search and judge our heart, much heavenly skill and prudence is required. If
hypocrites did thus judge themselves, they would not bless themselves in their
good condition as they do. God has placed it in man as an Umpire to judge
matters impartially between God and thy own soul: But conscience being
naturally polluted, is not able to discharge this office. Hence it is that this
Court cease, conscience does not keep any Assize at all.

Eighthly, its defiled in that its afraid of light, and is not willing to come
to the Jon. 3.19, 20. Hence, John 16.7. Its the work of Gods Spirit to convince
the world of sin: But the natural conscience cannot abide this, and therefore
it hates a searching Ministry, as Ahab did Michaiah.

Samuels mantle.

Quest. How may a counterfeit conscience be discovered?

Answ. First, when it is not conscience, but a sinful lust that puts thee upon
many things: This is a sad delusion, thus to have conscience, and so God
himself abused: Thus Saul when he had sacrificed pretended conscience, and that
all was to serve God: Absolon when he hatched rebellion pretended a vow, and so
he must out of conscience perform it. Judas when he repined at the ointment
pretended charity and conscience, when it was lust and covetousness.

Secondly, when its fancy and imagination which persuades thee, and not
conscience:

Thirdly, custom, education, and prepossessed principles sometimes work upon
Shechem would be circumcised, it was not out of conscience: but for Dina's
sake. When Jeroboam erected an Altar, it was not for conscience, but out of
carnal policy.

Fourthly, if it be conscience that puts us upon duties, and those commanded,
Romans 13.5. Paul presses obedience, not only for fear, but for conscience: If
it were from fear only, it were sinful. Hence Peter speaks of a conscience of
God, 1 Pet. 2.19. A conscience toward God, 1 Pet. 3.21. which is not to be
understood subjectively, as if God had a conscience but objectively: for a
conscience that respects the will, and authority of God: Many frequent
Ordinances, not out of conscience to God, but in regard of the Laws of men, or
some such other respect. Whereas, Colos. 3.17, 18. all should be done heartily
as to God, etc.

Fifthly, natural conscience is greatly polluted by original sin in regard of
the Pharisees, Luke 11.42.

Sixthly, its polluted in that its very severe in censuring other men's sins,
but blind about its own. In this its like the eye which can see all other
things but Mat. 7.3, This Christ charge upon the Pharisees, bidding them
first to pull out the beam out of their own eye, etc. So Romans 2.1. Judah was
very severe against Thamar, till he saw the staff and the bracelets. Such have
the eyes of the Lamiae, that they take up when they go abroad, and lay aside
when they come home.

Seventhly, its defiled because of the ease, and security it has, whereas, if
it

Eighthly, its grossly defiled, both because it has lost its subordination to
God Antinomians do, who say, that a man is perfect when he can sin, and his
conscience never smite him f^r it. And as for the affections, and will,
conscience cannot now rule, and command them.

Quest. How is conscience defiled when troubled and awakened?

Answ. First, when though it trouble, and accuse, yet it does it
preposterously, sin is committed to prevent it: but it seldom does it till the
sin be committed, when God is dishonored, and when guilt is contracted, and
then also it acts, not so much under God to bring about true peace, by
repentance, and faith, as the Devils instrument, to bring to despair, and so
from one sin to fall into a greater; as we see in Judas.

Adam when he had sinned, was afraid of God, and ran to hide himself: Now this
reproaches the goodness and mercy of God, that we should have such hard
thoughts of him: they oppose his grace and mercy which he intends to exalt in
the pardon of sin.

Cain and Judas.

Fourthly, its polluted by that ignorance, and incapacity in knowing what is in
infinitum, which makes a man very unserviceable, and his life very
uncomfortable.

Again, from the blindness of a troubled conscience comes also the sad, and
great doubtings upon the heart, whereby the soul is distracted, and divided:
pulled this way, and haled that way, Romans 14.14, etc. Paul speaking at large
about a doubting conscience, shows that its a damnable thing to do any thing
doubtingly whether it be a sin or not. A doubting conscience is more then
scrupulous; for a man may go against a scrupulous conscience, because the
conscience is resolved for the main, that a man may do such a thing lawfully,
only he has some fears, and jealousies moving him to the contrary: But a
doubting conscience is when arguments are not clear, but a man stands as it
were at the end of two ways, and knows not what to do. Now if the conscience
were well informed by Gods Word, it would not be subject to such distracting
doubts, but through natural blindness its often at a stand.

Lastly, it becomes from a scrupulous doubting conscience, a perplexed
conscience so ensnared that what way so ever it takes, he cannot but sin. As
Paul thought himself bound to persecute the Christians, if he did it, it was
plain that he sinned, if he did it not, he thought he sinned. Indeed the
Casuists say, non datur casus perplexus: there cannot be any case wherein there
is a necessity of sinning, because a man is bound to remove the error upon his
conscience, yet the ignorance and blindness of man brings him often into that
perplexed estate.



way appointed by God for to give true peace, and tranquillity to such a
conscience.

Quest. Is it not then a blessed thing to come well out of the pains of a
troubled conscience?

Answ. Yea, it is a most blessed, and happy thing to come out of a troubled
conscience in a good, safe, and soul-establishing way: For when conscience is
in travel its apt to miscarry: yea, sometimes its so far from having any joy,
or true fruit of holiness produced, that a monster is borne instead of a
man-child. Both Scripture and experience confirm this, that many come out of
these troubles with more obstinacy, and wilfulness to sin again: and so those
hopeful workings end in a senseless stupidity. Pharaoh for a while, and
Belshazzar, and Felix trembled: Conscience gave some sharp stings, but it came
to no good. Thus in many, frequent troubles of conscience end in a plain
dedolency, and stupidity of conscience never to be troubled more. Oh therefore
pray, and get thy friends pray, that thy troubles may be sanctified, and
blessed to make a thorough change upon thee.

Quest. What is the difference between a troubled and regenerate conscience?

Ans. Conscience may be exceedingly troubled about sin, and yet be in a state
of original pollution, and destitute of the Spirit of Christ: As we see in
Cain, and Judas, who had earthquakes in their consciences, and more trouble
then they could bear, and yet had not regenerate consciences: Indeed these
troubles are sometimes introductory, and preparatory to conversion.

But if we stay in these, and think them enough, we grossie deceive our souls.
When the Jews by Peter's Sermon were pricked to the heart, Act. 2.37, 38. they
cry out saying, What shall we do? Peter directs them to a further duty which is
to repent; therefore those fears and troubles were not enough for their
conversion. Its true, a gracious, regenerate conscience may have great
initiatory troubles of conscience; yet these troubles do not infer
regeneration: but are therefore brought upon thee, that thou may be provoked
to enquire after this new creature.

Quest. What may be the causes of the trouble of conscience, which yet are
short of true saving Motives?

Answ. First, the Commission of some great and heinous sin against conscience:
Act. 2.15. the consciences of the Heathen accused them. Thus Nero after he had
killed his mother, was filled with terrors, and our Richard the third, when he
had murdered his Nephews.

Secondly, it may arise from some heavy and grievous judgment that befalls
Joseph's brethren, Genesis 42.21. So in Belshazzer, etc.

Thirdly, God as a just Judge can send these hornets to sting their
consciences. Cain being stung, fell to building to quiet it. This was
threatened, Deuteronomy. 29.65, 67. This is the beginning even of hell it self in this
life, Heb. 10.27, 31.

Fourthly, it often comes by the Spirit of God convincing, and reproving by
Joh. 16.8. the Spirit convinces the world of sin: Now conviction belongs to
the conscience principally; and indeed its the ordinary way of conversion: when
Gods Spirit by the Law convinces, and awakens the conscience making it
restless; the man finds nothing but sin: no righteousness to be justified by:
the Law condemns, Justice arraigns, and he is overwhelmed: Hence, Romans 8.15.
the same spirit is the Spirit of bondage and of adoption, called so from its
different operations.

Fifthly, they may arise by Gods permission from the Devil: when God left

Quest. What are the false ways that a wounded conscience is prone to take?

Answ. First, some when troubled for sin, call it melancholy, and
pusillanimity, and therefore they will go to their merry company, they will
drink it away, rant it away; or go to their merry pastimes. As Herod sought to
kill Jesus as soon as he was borne: so these seek to stifle troubles of
conscience in the first beginnings of them.

Secondly, when this will not prevail, but that still they think they must go
Popery, to go on Pilgrimage: to enter into a Monastery, etc. thinking thereby
to get peace of conscience; but Luther found by experience the insufficiency
of all these courses.
