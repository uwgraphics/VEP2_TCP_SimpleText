HIS MAJESTY'S DECLARATION TO His City of LONDON, Upon occasion of the late
Calamity by the lamentable FIRE.
CHARLES R.

AS no particular Man has sustained any loss or damage by the late terrible
and deplorable Fire in his Fortune or Estate, in any degree to be compared with
the loss and damage We Our Self have sustained, so it is not possible for any
Man to take the same more to heart, and to be more concerned and sollicitous
for the rebuilding this Famous City, with as much expedition as is possible:
And since it has pleased God to lay this heavy Judgment upon Us all in this
time, as an evidence of his displeasure for Our sins, We do comfort Our Self
with some hope, that he will upon Our due humiliation before Him, as a new
instance of his signal blessing upon Us, give Us life, not only to see the
foundations laid, but the buildings finished, of a much more beautiful City
then is at this time consumed; and that as the seat and situation of it is the
most convenient and noble, for the advancement of Trade, of any City in Europe;
so that such care will be taken for the re-edification of it, both for use and
beauty, and such provision made for the future, against the ordinary and casual
accidents by Fire, as may as far as humane wisdom can provide, upon the sad
experience We have had, reasonably secure the same, and make it rather appear
to the world as purged with the Fire (in how lamentable a manner soever) to a
wonderful beauty and comeliness, then consumed by it; and We receive no small
encouragement in this Our hope by the alacrity and cheerfulness We observe in
those who have undergone the greatest loss, and seem the most undone, who with
undaunted Courage appear to desire the same* We do, and resolved to contribute
their utmost assistance thereunto. We have therefore thought fit, most
necessary and agreeable to the great and constant affection We have always
had, and always shall retain for this Our Native City, to use this expedition
in publishing Our Thoughts, Resolutions, and Intentions upon this great affair
that though such present Rules and Directions cannot be formed, as must upon
more mature deliberation be established for the re-edification. Yet such
inconveniences may and shall be prevented, which may arise by the hasty and
unskilful buildings many may propose to erect for their present conveniences,
before they can know how the same will suit and consist with the design that
shall be made; And if this candor of Ours, which resolves with the blessing of
God so to provide for the just right and interest of all, that no man shall have
cause to complain of wrong and oppression; And if this Our seasonable
animadversion shall not meet with that prudent submission we expect, but that
some obstinate and refractory persons will presume to erect such Buildings as
they shall think fit, upon pretense that the Ground is their own, and that they
may do with it what they please, such their obstinacy shall not prevail to the
public prejudice; but We do hereby require the Lord Mayor and the other
Magistrates of the City of London in their several limits, to be very watchful
in such cases, and speedily to pull down whatsoever such men shall presume to set
up, so much to the disturbance of Public Order and decency, and that they
forthwith give notice to Us or Our Privy Council of such their Proceedings, and
return the names of such refractory persons who presume to contemn this Our
Injunction, and We shall give order for their exemplary punishment without the
violation of the Public Justice.

And because no men shall complain or apprehend that by this caution or
restraint of Ours, they shall or may for a long time be kept from providing
Habitations for themselves, and for the carrying on their Trades, though We
make no question, but in a short time, with the assistance and advice of the
Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen (who have besought us for some time to put
this restraint) to finish the whole design, even before any men can make
provision of materials for any valuable Edifices: We do declare, that if any
considerable number of men (for it is impossible to comply with the humor of
every particular man) shall address themselves to the Court of Aldermen, and
manifest to them in what places their Ground lies, upon which they design to
build, they shall in a short time receive such order and direction, for their
proceeding therein, that they shall have no cause to complain; and so We proceed
to the setting down such general to which all particular designs must conform
themselves.

In the first place the woeful experience in this late heavy visitation has
sufficiently convinced all men of the pernicious consequences which have
attended the building with Timber, and even with Stone it self, and the notable
benefit of Brick, which in so many places: has resisted and even extinguished
the Fire; And we do therefore hereby declare Our express Will and Pleasure, That
no man whatsoever shall presume to erect any House or Building, great or small,
but of Brick, or Stone, and if any man shall do the contrary, the next
Magistrate shall forthwith cause it to be pulled down, and such further course
shall be taken for his punishment as he deserves; And We suppose that the
notable benefit many men have received from those Cellars which have been well
and strongly arched, will persuade most men who build good Houses, to practice
that good husbandry, by Arching all convenient places.

We do declare, That Fleetstreet, Cheapside, Cornhill, and all other eminent
and notorious Streets, shall be of such a breadth, as may with Gods blessing
prevent the mischief that one side may suffer if the other be on fire, which
was the case lately in Cheapside, the precise breadth of which several Streets,
shall be upon advice with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen shortly published, with
many other particular Orders and Rules, which cannot yet be adjusted; in the
mean time We resolve though all Streets cannot be of equal breadth, yet none
shall be so narrow as to make the passage uneasy or inconvenient, especially
toward the Waterside; nor will we suffer any Lanes or Allies to be erected,
but where upon mature deliberation the same shall be found absolutely necessary,
except such places shall be set aside which shall be designed only for buildings
of that kind, and from whence no public mischief may probably arise.

The irrepairable damage and loss by the late Fire, being next to the hand of
God in the terrible Wind, to be imputed to the place in which it first brake
out, amongst small Timber houses standing so close together, that as no remedy
could be applied from the River for the quenching thereof, to the
contiguousness of the Buildings hindering and keeping all possible relief from
the Land side, We do resolve and declare, That there shall be a fair Key or
Wharf on all the River side, that no house shall be erected within so many foot
of the River, as shall be within few days declared in the Rules formerly
mentioned; nor shall there be in those Buildings which shall be erected next the
River, which We desire may be fair Structures, for the ornament of the City,
any houses to be inhabited by Brewers, or Diers, or Sugar Bakers, which Trades
by their continu^^ Smoaks contributed very much to the unhealthiness of the
adjacent places, but We require the Lord Major and Aldermen of London upon a
full consideration, and weighing all conveniences and inconveniences that can be
foreseen, to propose such a place as may be fit for all those Trades which are
carried on by smoke to inhabit together, or at least several places for the
several barters of the Town for those occupations, and in which they shall find
their account in convenience and profit, as well as other places shall receive
the benefit in the distance of the neighborhood, it being Our purpose that
they who exercise those necessary professions, shall be in all respects as well
provided for and encouraged as ever they have been, and undergo as little
prejudice as may be by being less inconvenient to their Neighbors.

These grounds and foundations being laid, from the substance whereof we shall
not depart, and which being published are sufficient advertisements to prevent
any man's running into or bringing an inconvenience upon himself by a
precipitate engagement in any Act which may cross these foundations, We have in
order to the reducing this great and glorious design into practice, directed,
and We do hereby direct, that the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen do with all
possible expe^^^tion (...) and exact Survey to be made and taken of the (...)
rui^s. (...) by the late lamentable Fires, to the end that it may appear to
whom all the Houses and Ground did in truth belong, what Term the several
occupiers were possessed of, and at what Rents, and to whom, either
Corporations, Companies, or single persons, the Reversion and Inheritance
appertained, that (...) provision may be made that though every man must not be
suffered to erect what Buildings and where he pleases, he shall not in any
degree be debarred from receiving the reasonable benefit of what ought to
accrue to him from such Houses or Lands, there being nothing less in Our
thoughts, then that any particular persons right and interest should be
sacrificed to the public benefit or convenience, without such recompense as in
justice he ought to receive for the same: And when all things of this kind
shall be prepared and adjusted by such Commissioners, and otherwise, which shall
be found expedient, We make no doubt but such an Act of Parliament will pass, as
shall secure all men in what they shall and ought to possess.

By the time that this Survey shall be taken, We shall cause a Plot or Model to
be made for the whole building through those ruined places, which being well
examined by all those persons who have most concernment as well as experience,
We make no question but all men will be well pleased with it, and very willingly
conform to those Orders and Rules which shall be agreed for the pursuing thereof.

In the mean time we do heartily recommend it to the charity and magnanimity of
all well disposed persons, and We do heartily pray unto Almighty God that he will
infuse it into the hearts of Men speedily to endeavor by degrees to re-edifie
some of those many Churches which in this lamentable Fire have been burned down
and defaced, that so men may have those public places of Gods Worship to
resort to, to humble themselves together before Him upon this His heavy
displeasure, and join in their devotion for His future Mercy and Blessing upon
Us, and as soon as We shall be informed of any readiness to begin such a good
Work, We shall not only give Our assistance and direction for the model of it,
and freeing it from buildings at too near a distance, but shall encourage it by
Our Own bounty and all other ways We shall be desired.

Lastly, that We may encourage men by Our Own example, We will use all the
expedition We can to re-build Our Custom House in the place where it formerly
stood, and enlarge it with the most conveniences for the Merchants that can be
devised, and upon all the other Lands which belong unto Us, We shall depart with
any thing of Our own right and benefit for the advancement of the public
service and beauty of the City, and shall further remit to all those who shall
erect any buildings according to this Declaration all duties arising to Us upon
the Hearth money for the space of seven years.

Given at Our Court at White-Hal the thirteenth day of September, One thousand
six hundred sixty and six, in the Eighteenth year of Our Reign.

FINIS.
