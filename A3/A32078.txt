BY THE KING.
A Proclamation requiring all His Majesty's Tenants within the Counties of
Oxford and Berks to pay their several Rents, and other yearly payments, at
the City of Oxford.
WHereas there are several Rents, Tenths, and Arreirages of Rents, now due and
payable to the King and Queens Majesty's, by diverse and sundry Tenants,
Collectors, and others, within Our foresaid Counties, which should have been
paid by the said Tenants, Collectors, and others at the Audit held at
Maydenhead for the said Counties in October last, but by Our Command, and for
Our service were deferred. And We now considering that, by reason of the
present distractions of this Kingdom, the said Rents, Tenths, and arreirages of
Rents, cannot be more conveniently paid for Our use then at our City of
Oxford, where We now are; Our Royal will and pleasure therefore is, and We do
hereby charge and command, That all such Tenths, Rents, and Arrerages, of
Rents, which are now due unto Us, and ought to be paid to Our Receiver of Our
foresaid Counties of Oxford and Berks, for Our use, be duly paid unto Michaell
Hollman Esquire Our Receiver-Generall for the said Counties, or to his Deputy, at
Mr Richard Pulleys chamber in Saint John's College in Oxford, within ten
days next after the date of this Our Proclamation: And they are to bring with
them their last Acquittances for their Rents, and Tenths formerly paid by them.
Willing and commanding the due performance of this Our Proclamation by all
Person or Persons whom it may concern, as they will answer the contrary at
their Perils.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the Eleventh day of January, in the Eighteenth
year of Our Reign.
