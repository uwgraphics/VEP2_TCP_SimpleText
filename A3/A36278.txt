The Doleful Lamentation Of Thomas Dangerfield, who was lately apprehended and
Imprisoned in Newgate, for High Misdemeaner, etc.
To the Tune of It Is for mine own offense I must Dye.
I.
Mark well my words you Country Men,
And Loyal Subjects all,
And take Example now by me,
To shun a dreadful fall.
My Name's unhappy Dangerfield,
In Prison I am fast,
And all my great Designs are turned
To sorrow now at last.
II.
In England I was born and bred,
And Educate at School:
But all the Labor was but lost,
Since I grew up a Fool:
Although GOD does Govern all things,
According to his Will,
He never yet did bring to pass
An Action that was ill.
III.
When men resist the Motions, and
Convictions of the Truth,
And follow all the fond Delights
That Is incident to Youth,
The GOD of TRUTH departs from them,
And leaves them to their sin;
And then the subtle Serpent does
Ensnare them in his Jen.
IV.
I by degrees of sin did climb
The steps of Wickedness;
Which now (alas) has brought poor me
To wooful great distress:
I was unfaithful to my GOD,
And Traiterous to my KING,
And I was ready (on a call)
To every Evil Thing.
V.
My Vices they were manifold,
My Company was evil;
I used a Thousand wild conceits,
To run me to the Devil.
I turned a Coiner by my Trade,
And Mountibank of State,
For which I Am grieved at the Heart,
Though now it be too late.
VI.
Now I Am enclosed in Prison close,
Secured in Walls of Stone;
I languish without Remedy,
Relief I can have none.
My Senses are my sorrows sluice,
The Floodgates of my shame,
And all my cruel Comforters
Add Fuel to my Flame.
VII.
O were I at my Liberty
(As I have been before)
I never would prove Treacherous,
Nor run on such a score.
But now my Lamentation's late,
My Sighs they are in vain;
Nor can I entertain a thought
To be set free again.
VIII.
You Spirits brave that live at ease,
Yet never are content,
But still will be a meddling
With State and Parliament:
Leave off your high and great Designs,
And change your minds with speed,
It is the greatest fall that is from
Promotions Piramid.
