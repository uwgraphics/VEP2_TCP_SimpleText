At the Court at York. 28. Martii. 1642.
His Majesty has given me express Command to give you this His Answer to
your Petition.
THat this Petition (as some others of this nature) is grounded upon
misinformation, and (being grieved and highly offended to see how His good
People have been, and are abused by false Rumors and Intelligences, which have
procured causlesse Fears and Apprehensions) refers the Petitioners to the two
Answers He has given to His Parliament, viz. To the Declaration presented to
Him at New Market, and to the Petition presented to Him the six and twentieth
of this month at York: wherein you will clearly perceive, That His Majesty is
not gone, but driven away from His Parliament, and therefore His Majesty has
reason to think, that now (understanding the love He bears to, and Confidence
He has of His Peoples Fidelity; As likewise His constant Resolution for the
maintaining of, and governing by the Laws of the Land) you may find reason to
petition the Parliament to comply with His Majesty's just Desires, and gracious
Offers, this being the only Way, safely and speedily to cure the present
Distractions of this Kingdom, and (with Gods blessing) to put a happy end to
the Irish Rebellion for the effecting whereof (as His Majesty has often said)
He will neither spare pains, nor decline any hazard of His Person or Fortune.

Signed by Master Secretary NICHOLAS.

Imprinted at York by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
