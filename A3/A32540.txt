A PROCLAMATION For the Discovery and Apprehending all Popish Priests and
Jesuits.
CHARLES R.

WHereas it is most Notorious and Evident, That a great number of Popish
Priests and Jesuits are at this time secretly disguised, and lurking within
this Realm, where they do not only endeavor to Pervert His Majesty's Subjects
from the true Protestant Religion, to Romish Superstition, but do also contrive
and set on foot diverse Traitorous Plots and Designs against His Majesty, His
Government, and the Protestant Religion by Law Established: The Kings most
Excellent Majesty (upon the Humble Petition of the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses now in Parliament Assembled) for the better Discovery and
Apprehending of such Popish Priests and Jesuits, Does by this His Royal
Proclamation strictly Charge and Command all His Judges, Justices of the Peace,
Magistrates, Officers, and other His Loyal Subjects within this His Realm of
England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, That they do use
their utmost Care and Endeavor to Discover, Apprehend, and Commit, or cause to
be Committed to safe Custody, in order to their Trial, all Popish Priests, and
Jesuits (Except John Huddleston, Who was signally instrumental in His Majesty's
Escape after the Fight at Worcester, and such Foreign Popish Priests or Jesuits
as by Contract of Marriage are to attend the Person of His Royal Consort the
Queen (the Names of whom shall be signified under Her Great Seal, and such
Signification Enrolled in His Majesty's Court of Kings Bench) and except such
Foreign Popish Priests and Jesuits who are by the Law of Nations to attend
Foreign Ambassadors.) And for the greater Encouragement to such of His
Majesty's Loyal Subjects as shall Discover and Apprehend any Popish Priest or
Jesuit (Except before excepted) His Majesty is hereby Graciously pleased to
promise to him or them who shall Discover and Apprehend, or cause to be
Apprehended, any such Popish Priest or Jesuit, the Reward of Twenty pounds,
which shall be immediately paid upon such Discovery and Apprehension, and due
Proof thereof.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Twentieth day of November, 1678. In the
Thirtieth year of Our Reign.
