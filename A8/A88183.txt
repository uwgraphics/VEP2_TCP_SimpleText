ENGLANDS weeping spectacle: OR, The sad condition of Lieutenant Colonel John
Lilburne: Crying to all who have any conscience or compassion, for assistance
and deliverance from his unjust, long and cruel sufferings.

Wherein (as in a glass) all Englishmen may see the slavish condition, unto
which (after so much blood, time and treasure spent) they are yet by perfidious
men (who vowed and promised to deliver them from all tyranny and oppression)
still most woefully subjected.

Prove. 11.26. Matthew. 26.44, 45, 46. The righteousness of the upright shall
deliver them, but transgressors shall be taken in their own wickedness.

Then shall they also answer him, saying, when saw we thee an hungry, or
athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not minister
unto thee?

Then shall he answer them, and say, verily I say unto you, in as much as ye
did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

And these shall go into everlasting pain, and the righteous unto life
etenrall.

Printed in the Year 1648.

Englands weeping Spectacle, or the sad condition of Lievtenant-Colonell JOHN
LILBURNE; Crying to all who have any conscience or compassion, for assistance
and deliverance from his unjust, long and cruel sufferings.
CErtainly in it self, and to a sound and virtuous mind, nothing is so sad, so
irksome and grievous, as the unjust sufferings of an honest and faithful man,
who for his hatred to oppression, and love to the just Liberty of his Country,
is made a prey to Tyrants, and the subject of their scorn, pride, and malice.

And if this be so, as it must needs be, Paul testifying, that for a good man
some would even dare to die, thereby signifying his excessive grief, (when
virtue and goodness suffers) and in this respect, who can forbear to weep,
that considers the long and cruel sufferings of M. Lilburn, which were not for
any unjust action, nor for obtaining some particular good to himself, but in
the constant pursuance of the general good of this long-betrayed and inslaved
Nation.

When first he began to understand himself, had he been like unto most young
men of his age and time, who either wast their abilities on vain fantastic
pleasures, or hunt after the sordid rewards of ambition and covetousness,
minding little else but the pride, vanity, and luxury of a sinful life, mixed
at best, only with a form of Godliness, without the power or life thereof, no
doubt but he might soon have come to have been a man of this world, to have
been some body in the City and place where he was bred; and have enjoyed those
contents, which most men seek either in honor or profit.

But it seems his conscience was soon awakened upon his Masters call, God to
whose service he had dedicated himself, made him to know betimes, that he had
other work for him to do, and being called, he neither suffered the motions of
God in his conscience to be choked with the cares of this world, nor the
deceitfulness of riches, nor consult with flesh and blood, but (as Moses) he
chused rather to suffer affliction in pursuance of a just cause, then to enjoy
the pleasures of sin for a season.

Hereupon, he finding all Authority corrupted and perverted from the true end,
(the preservation and freedom of the people) to its contrary, the ruin,
vexation, and bondage of the people: his conscience presently sets him awork,
waving all selfe-respects to the discovery thereof, by printing and publishing
of books whereby to open the understandings of men, and stirring them up to a
timely prevention of that intolerable bondage, which he perceived to be coming
fast upon them.

Whilst he was thus employed, the Lordly Bishops and corrupt Statesmen (whose
wickedness was laid open through his endeavors) did by the craft of their
officious instruments and treachery of fained friends, lay hold of him, and
proceed against him in Star Chamber, where after most corrupt proceedings, he
is put to that vile Oath Ex Officio, enjoining him to answer to all such
questions as they should demand, even to Articles against himself, which being
contrary to nature, reason, Law and Religion, he absolutely refuses to answer,
insists upon his right, and declares the illegality and abominable wickedness
of such proceedings.

For refusing whereof, they sentence him to be whipped at a Cart, from the
Fleet-prison, to Westminster Hall, and there to be set on the Pillory for many
hours, to be a wonder to all men, and with what malice this cruelty was
executed, how bloodily he was whipped, how cruelly gagged, and after that, how
barbarously he was used in his imprisonment in the Fleet, would be no less
sad, then tedious to rehearse, yea and is of it self sufficient, had his
sufferings ended there, even to make every true-hearted Englishman, with the
Prophet Jeremy, to wish that his head were a well of water, and his eyes
fountains of tears, that he might weep day and night, that any government
pretending Christianity should be so inhumane, or any people professing the
knowledge of God, or common equity, should be so sottish as to stand by,
observe and suffer such inhumane cruelty, whereof the particulars have been so
fully and frequently related, that it is needless here to repeat them; these
are times wherein Christians are not Children in knowledge, but rather in
conscience and practice, or else this weeping Spectacle would make their heats
to bleed, and burn within them, till they had found out some way of
deliverance for him.

But did his sorrows end here? No; but as the injustice and cruelty of his
adversaries abated not his courage, (as they supposed and expected) but rather
increased and heightened his resolution, according to the nature of true
Christian fortitude, so has the same ever since, moved him with undaunted
courage, to stand in opposition to the oppression and injustice of the times,
and by that means begotten him more and greater affliction, even principally
from the Parliament it self, who pretended not only to deliver him, but all
England out of all kind of bondage, and oppression.

It Is confessed, they began well, like true Christians indeed, in delivering the
captive, and setting the oppressed free, whereof he was one, and it was well
for them he was so, for he was no unthankful one, but immediately (occasion so
requiring) ventured his life for their preservation, against Lunsford and his
crew of Ruffians at Westminster, where the Parliament of England that had
preserved him, was by his special means (under God) preserved; the greatest
number that were there, even Sir Richard Wiseman, himself, being there by his
incitement, who notwithstanding is since too much forgotten, and where this our
weeping Spectacle was then a bleeding Spectacle to all beholders, and for which
and much more both before and since, all true lovers of Englands Liberties, are
beholding to him: and had not things then as well as since, been done by halves
and deceitfully, our troubles had then ended, or at least not half so long
endured.

And how sensible did the Parliament then seem to be of his sufferings and
service? What could be desired, that was not then voted in his behalf, whether
in condemnation of his tyrannous adversaries, or in justification and
reparation of his sufferings and losses, even as far, and as fair, as the wits
of men could devise, which is evident by their Votes then manifested? And this
at that time gained them abundance of friends, for he was exceedingly beloved
and pitied throughout the Land: Oh that all their proceedings since had been
agreeable to this, he is not a changer with the times, though they in their
actions be much changed: For it had not then appeared, that this they did to
him, was not for justice sake, but rather to advance a party whereby to
compass their own ends, and not the public good.

But so really thankful is this good man, for their seeming good to him, and
to the public in him, (for he and the public are but one, as time will prove
effectually) that no sooner did their necessities declare for War, but he
ingages himself, and all the friends he had, one way or other to engage for
them, and for their sakes, (supposing then they minded really the Commons
Liberties, and the redress of all grievances) forsakes his calling wherein he
lived comfortably, and leaves his wife, dearer to him then himself, as she
well deserved, honoring and comforting him before she was so, even when he was
more like Job upon the dunghill by his sufferings, then a man at that time for
her society: And at Kentonfield ventured his life freely for them, and his
Country, so that he gained very much respect from all who observed his
faithfulness and valor.

Nor does he desist here, though by what he had seen both at Worcester and at
this fight, he had cause to doubt, that there was no intention of a speedy end
to the war, or of liberty to the people, but occasion at Branford again
requiring his service, he there for many hours with an inconsiderable party of
men that can never be too much honored, holds all the Enemies Forces at a bay,
and inforces them to a stand till London was provided, which otherwise in
probability had been surprised on a sudden, and where he lost himself to redeem
his Country, being in a worse condition then those many worthy men there
slain; for he was led in a most despicable manner from thence to Oxford, where
he underwent a long and loathsome imprisonment, with most barbarous usage from
Smith the cruel Jailer, and a most dangerous trial for his life before Judge
Heath: and though he daily expected certain death, yet stood he firm against
all kinds of temptations and promises, whether of honor, or profit, or
deliverance from his present misery, firm as built upon a Rock, even the Rock
Christ Jesus, and a cause (as his conscience had digested it) just as justice
it self.

And for defense whereof, he had certainly and suddenly died the most shameful
death, if the faithfulness of his wife had not even in the very instant
prevented the judgment and execution, for she knowing his danger, ceased not
to solicit the House of Commons daily and hourly to interpose their power for
his preservation, and when by ordinary solicitation she could not prevail,
necessity so much enforcing, she took the boldness to present her self at the
Commons Bar, there begging and importuning their care of her husbands life,
and was (by divine providence) so happy as to obtain their Order and Letter to
Judge Heath, requiring a forbearance of his execution, and withal, threatening
the death of two of their friends (being then prisoners here) in case they took
his life.

With which letter (big with child as she was) she undergoes a task through all
the strong Courts of Guard, which none else (as things then stood) durst
undertake; in performance whereof, she met with so many sad and difficult
accidents, to a woman in her condition, as would force tears from the hardest
heart, to hear them related, but they are too large for this place, though
those that know them, cannot but remember them to her perpetual commendation,
who by wisdom, patience and diligence overcame them all, and for her reward
both saved her husbands life, and after a season obtained his liberty.

Neither was he wearied by these his sufferings, nor unthankful for the
respects showed unto him by the Parliament, as witness his speedy engagement
under the Earl of Manchester, in which service it is well known, he was so
faithful, resolute, and successful, that he became the darling and
bosome-friend to the now Lievtenant-Generall Cromwell, through whose unhappy
intimacy he had so great an inspection into the actions of the Earl himself,
and likewise of Col. King, that when Cromwell impeached the said Earl upon
many dangerous articles, he had not so material a witness (or that durst so
effectually appear) as his trusty friend Lievetenant-Colonell Lilburne, who
(not knowing what belonged to fear or distrust) boldly discovers upon
examination, all that he knew or could testify, and which made up so much as
the house of Commons, upon report of the Committee, voted the charge to be
fully proved.

But here ends the charge, (to Mr. Lilburne and all true hearted English men's
great grief, which otherwise if it had been prosecuted, might then have made
an end of all these wars, troubles and oppressions) and here began Mr.
Lilburne and all other honest men's overthrow, by means of those deceitful
instruments unto this day:

For instantly upon this cessation and alteration, diverse unworthy officious
men were set awork both upon him and all that loved him and his cause, even by
printed, railing and lying pamphlets, to abuse, vex and provoke him, unto which
he answering and replying in way of justifying himself and his friends, is
hastily complained on to the Parliament, his person summoned by Warrants from
the Committee of Examinations, where (as before in Starchamber) he is demanded
questions against himself, which he refusing to answer, they make no longer
debate, but immediately send him to Newgate, purposely to disparage and provoke
him more and more, wherein Mr. Miles Corbet and Mr. Whitaker were very forward.

And though they had no Commission so to do, yet the house of Commons, both
justifies the Committee, and directs the Recorder of London, to prepare for his
trial at Sessions for his life, as if there had been some capital crime or
dangerous matter against him, and in this base prison he lies almost three
months, and of what slanders were reported and Plots divised against him, all
this time not only his and his friends sad experience at present, but the
accusing conscience of his enemies will in due time bear witness: And then
upon his own motion to Newgate Sessions, and upon their hearing him in open
Court by a public speech (defying all his accusers and all their accusations)
was by proclamation set free, without any legal crime laid to his charge,
either by Parliament or any other; whereby he gained the more credit and
honor, and all his enemies the more shame and contempt ever since.

Well, all this he puts up (there being no way of remedy yet found our, for any
injustice of the House of Commons, nor of their Committees) and imployes his
industry to get his due arreares, and the damages Voted him formerly for his
cruel sufferings in the Star Chamber, and having with continual pains
early and late, at length prevailed so far, as that the House of Lords
assigned him two thousand pounds, upon due trial and proof of the business,
and he being in good hopes of a speedy issue, Col. King is put upon him to
bring him to further troubles, and frustrat all his endeavors, and for a
beginning arrests him upon an action for Slanderous words, which he pretended
to be spoken against him, whereas the words indeed were in way of proving King
an offender, upon Articles exhibited against him in Parliament, and King aid
this purposely to take away his Testimony.

Here you are to mind, that Mr. Lilburne had left the service of the Wars,
upon a just dislike of the corrupt managing thereof, and being here about
London, had discovered the perverse proceeding of the Parliament, and now
hateful all sorts of conscientious people (whatever they formerly pretended)
were unto them; and thereupon invited others, and joined with them by Petitions
to induce them to a better temper. And this his forwardness for public good,
occasioned all men who had any public greevances to discover, to come to him
and to ask his advice, which brought some trouble, and more fear upon diverse
that yet bear their heads full high, and wrought him more enmity, then that
either of the Earl of Manchester, or of Colonel King, for all that had any
guilt upon them new or old were greatly afraid of him; so that King gained
abundance of friends, as Prynne and Bastwicke had done before, by thus abusing
Mr. Lilburne.

But being arrested by King in the Court of Common Pleas, and put to his
defense, having in all this time received no part of his damages, nor but a
hundred Pounds of all his arreares, (which was spent (in these his sufferings)
before he had it) and finding the preceedings in law, full of intricacy and
perplexity both irrational and destructive to himself and the people, he
thence takes occasion to Petition the House of Commons, that the Charge and
Articles against King might be tried by a Counsel of War, before King should
be permitted to proceed against him; this Petition he could never get to be
delivered, or read in the House; then after long and tedious attendance, to
save himself, and for the good of the people, (who are ever one) he writes a
discourse to Judge Reeves, and Prints it, and calls it, The just man's
justification wherein he lays open the great corruption and unreasonablenesse
of the Laws and proceedings therein, which are now yet in force
(notwithstanding this long lasting Parliament) and entreats him to lay those
things to heart, and in due sense thereof, that he would endeavor to free,
not only him, but all the people from so great and grievous a bondage which
was brought into this Nation, at the will and pleasure of the Norman
conqueror, by force and violence of the Sword, or to this effect was the
scope, tenor, and end of his Letter.

The unjust Judge finding that this book tended maynly to discover the juggling
of Judges and Lawyers, to spoil their Trade and Mystery of in^quity, whereby
they both heap up riches, and in effect sway the whole Nation instead of doing
what a good Conscience would have bound him to, he (like himself) by way of
complaint, presents the book to the House of Lords, where not only Monchester
his deadlyest enemy is Speaker, but some of those wicked m^n also, who
sentenced Mr. Lilburn in the Star Chamber, are now again his Judges, with the
rest, against whose legislative power and jurisdiction over Commoners, he is
generally known to be a just and professed opposite.

And is he not here now in a sad condition, summoned he is before these Lords,
and boldly appears; is he not where all the Judges, Lawyers Oppressors,
Projectors, and Committeemen could wish him? Is it not now come to pass as
King would have it? For the Lords very well know whom they have before them,
and how to handle him, they first (trading the ordinary path of Tyrants) put
him to answer to questions against himself concerning the book, he in short,
disclaimes their jurisdiction over him, and presents to them his appeal to the
Commons as a Commoners for which they judge him to be worthy of no better place
then Newgate, where he continued ten days, and was sent for again, and then
for refusing to kpeele before them, they return him again to Newgate, to be
kept close Prisoner without Pen, Ink, and Paper, and none to have access to
him, but only his Keeper, during their pleasure.

But all those things are better known then considered, and how he after this
refused (till he was forced) to come any more before them, and being forced,
what his behavior was, how he refused again to kneel, and how he stopped his
ears against their Articles, as utterly renouncing their Authority over him,
and how for this, he was sentenced Two thousand pound to the King, and seven
years imprisonment in the Tower, where he continued without hope of
deliverance, until the Army pretended to insist for the general Liberty and
Freedom of the Nation, as well from the new contracted, as from the old
inveterate bondage thereof.

In all which time, it is not unknown how diligent he was, to make the House of
Commons sensible of the unjustice done unto him, and to all the people of
England in him, but all in vain, their long continuance having changed their
interest from that of the peoples, to this of the Lords; so that in effect they
joined (hand in hand) with them in oppressing him; which unjust dealing also,
as he had done other men's before, he spares neither pains nor charges to
publish to the world; whereby at length not only the people did gain so much
understanding, but the honest soldiers of the Army began to be sensible, that
tyranny and oppression was come to a height, as well in the Parliament, as in
the King, and therefore could see no reason, but the same ought to be resisted
in them, as it was in him.

Whereupon, as for other things, so in particular for deliverance of him, or to
procure him a legal trial, the whole Army begin to insist, and whilst they
were in motion from Newmarket toward London, how many and great respects were
manifested by them to him, is not unknown to thousands, nor was it ever
imagined that he should have remained prisoner in the Tower, when once the Army
were Masters of it.

But it clearly appears, the greatest number that really thought so were much
mistaken; for the great ones of the Army, what ever they pretended, are of
nearer relation, and more strongly contracted to the Lords and great ones of
the Nation, then to the Commons or such faithful patriots as Mr. Lilburn;
which being discerned by him sooner then by other men, and that their practices
tended not to a common good, he spares neither pains, cost nor hazard,
forthwith to discover their delusion (as well as he had done other men's
formerly) to the world, and finding his old friend Cromwell, to have been a
chief instrument in destroying the ends of their engagement, he neither
flatters nor spares him nor any other, but lays all their actions naked to the
view of the world, fore-shewing that which since is come to pass, and which
now every man sees and many feels, though then few or none would believe. Yet
through the policy of those arch-deceivers, Cromwell, Ireton, and their
apostate instruments, in stead of amending their faults, turn this his honest,
plain and impartial dealing, to his ruin; for they possessed all his lovers
and friends in City, Country and Army, that the man was frantic, little better
then one at Bedlam, that he really drives on the Kings design, and to others,
upon whom such speeches could not work, they give out, that he was a rash
inconsiderate man, and that nothing would satisfy him, but only to bring all
this Nation to Anarchy and confusion.

By all which their subtle workings, they blinded the eyes of those that had
them in admiration for their specious shows of devotion and Religion, under
which veil they deceived most men, and securely went through with destroying
the ends of the Armies engagements, declarations, remonstrances, yea vows and
protestations to God and man, and whereby they have made the most honest and
well meaning Army that ever was in the world, and the most valiant, best
beloved and most hopeful of all the people, to be accounted the greatest
deceiver and oppressor, and so the greatest object of all scorn, contempt, and
hatred.

And this the Army and all good people got, by believing those great men's false
reports and unjust censures of Mr. Lilburn, and exchanging his faithful and
timely advices for their delusions, and as this brought extreme evil upon all
honest men, so especially upon him, for those men having thus by their Arts and
sophistry overcome his reputation, they by slanders and reproaches in all
places, so alienated the hearts of those who formerly had comforted him in his
sufferings, and supported his necessities, that himself his wife and children,
have been many times since in such eatremities as is incredible to all, except
those only who know how vile their slanderous reproaches had made him in the
eyes of most men.

And when (notwithstanding all their malice) by his invincible diligence, he
had lately procured so much liberty, as to follow his own business, and
sometimes to go out of his prison, how soon did they pick occasion, in stead of
being prisoner to the Lords (from which he might justly and rationally expect
to be delivered speedily by the Commons) to make him the prisoner of the
Commons; and for what cause, even for promoting a petition for the universal
good of the whole nation as any honest man will easily discern at the first
reading thereof; yea such a petition, as unto which whosoever is an enemy, is
not, nor cannot be Englands friend.

Being thus a prisoner again, and hereby losing more friends (as who that
suffers, and has necessities are not subject unto) does he now faint and sink
under this addition of weight and sorrow to his former affliction? No, he
ceases not day and night, to make this injustice and cruelty known to the
deceived world, still writes, prints, and publishes both his own just cause,
and their malicious and cruel dealings, so plainly, so powerfully, and
courageously, that some who formerly had been his enemies, now are so far
convinced of his integrity, that they both love and honor him, to the shame of
his backsliding friends, and are by his faithful council preserved from a
snare, unjustly laid for their destruction.

Certainly, if any man in the world, has the unvaluable comfort of an
impartial, publict, active, sincere, persevering Conscience, this man has,
and yet of all men in this Nation, whether under the former or present
Government, is not this he that is designed to live perpetually in prison? For
what way possible is there for his enlargement? when the King, Bishops, Privy
Council, Starr-chamber, and High Commission ruled all, then who more then he
was judged worthy of whips, torture, imprisonment, and death?

Those Lords that first pretended to stand for the liberties of the people,
judge him most worthy of bonds, and the House of Commons who pretended more
good to the people, then ever their predicessors did, yea, and both of them
were preserved by his means (under God) in their greatest danger, and had
fewest to take their parts, yet it plainly here appears, that never any one
man has received more hurt from them, more palpable wrong then he has.

The present Clergyman that thrust out the former, even for their cruel
persecuting of him, and such as he is, do not afford him so much as one good
word; nay, they rail on him, and persecute no man more; those Lawyers that
formerly suffered in opposition to some kinds of oppression, having forsaken
their first love, and with Demas embraced the honors and profits of these
times, make sport at his sufferings, and use their utmost power to continue,
heighten, and increase them.

Those Judges that sit in place of such as were removed for Injustice, and who
are bound by Oath, Law, and Conscience, either to see him delivered, or brought
to a legal Trial, by 12. sworn men of his Neighbors, by whomsoever he is
imprisoned, yet seem to think it neither perjurie in themselves, injustice to
him, nor robbery to the people, to deny him this, which was never denied to the
veriest Villain, Rogue, Malefactor, Thief, or Traitor, in Newgate, and which
since this Parliament began, was granted to Maquier, and Machmahoone the Irish
Rebels, which he has set forth at large, (in his book called the Law-Funerall)
to the eternal infamy of those Parliamentary Judges.

And this has been his portion, for no other thing, but for being the most
constant, vigorous, unwearied friend to Englands liberty, and the deadliest
enemy to its bondage and slavery of any man whatsoever? Nor will any person,
Authority, or State ever prove a true friend to this Nation, that continues an
Enemy to him, or otherwise then Tyrants and Oppressors, that still domineere
and tyrannize over him, as their Predecessors in oppression, the Bishops, and
Starr-Chamber-men did before them.

He is thy true touchstone, O England, thou need no other to try either thy
Gold or dross, though any man appear or glister never so fair, if such a one
but speak against him, or insist only on some harsh (and yet true)
expressions in his Books, or any natural infirmities, as is the manner of
those hypocrites that do him most mischief, thou may certainly resolve upon
it, that that man (whosoever he be) does thereby show himself but a
counterfeit, and is not to be trusted in the day of thy necessity: Instance but
one (if thou can, O thou officious flatterer, who has stood firm for
Englands true freedom, that has despised him: thy Patron Cromwell himself
stumbling at this stone, he is fallen like Lucifer, yea, and all that steer
his unsteedy course, do they not stagger and reele up and down like so many
drunken men, and find no certain path wherein to walk, or set their feet,
since they forsook the straight way of this just and impartial man, Mr.
Lilburne.

O England, (or rather thou true part of England, that know best what just
freedom is) when thou would know whether thou art bond or free, whether
those thou trustest with thy freedom, power, and authority, deal well or ill
with thee, or whether they be just, or unjust, thou need not run to the
King nor Parliament, neither to the House of the Kings Lords, nor to House of
the Peoples Commons, neither enquire of thy Lawyers, nor of thy Priests or
Judges, but look only on him, consider his just cause, peruse his Writings,
and defer not to give judgment, that they are altogether become abominable,
and reprobate to every good work, that there is none of them that does good, no
not one, their throat is an open Sepulcher, not only in swallowing up thy good
men greedily like a Whale, and devouring thy goods insatiably like Bell, or
rather like hell: but with their tongues they speak nothing but lies of him,
and the cause for which he suffers, and yet promoteth for thy peace and
freedom.

Look, look upon him, all ye that pass by, yea, stand still, (I say) and look
steadfastly on him, his wife and children; Is it not a weeping spectacle, and
are there no tears yet in thine eyes, Whilst thou beholdest it? Look steedily
on his bloody stripes, terrible gagging, cruel imprisonment, and barbarous
usage, and likewise upon his actions and sufferings since; Were these
unparalleled sufferings not at all, because most of them were some years,
months, or weeks ago?

Surely, O friends, ye seem (by your practice) to think so; if it were
otherwise, whence comes so great an alteration in you, though there be both a
constant and courageous progress in him.

For no sooner entered he into any one of his afflictions formerly, but ye
flockt about him like so many Bees at a hive, like friends and true comforters
indeed, so that every one thought well or ill of themselves, as they comforted
or neglected him.

And seeing ye have found them all as step-mothers that have weaned you from
him, O then return, return, revive in love, there being no oppression, nor
burden, nor affliction so great, as the neglect of friends to one oppressed,
burdened, and afflicted for a just cause, in prison; Be not you therefore after
all the greatest, but lend him your societies, your comforts, your counsels,
and assistance, as at the first, whenevery one was ready to run, ride,
petition, or do any just thing for his encouragement, or enlargment.

And never look that England shall be free, or that any good is really intended
to this Nation, till this worthy man be set at liberty, with full reparations
for his foul injurious and unjust sufferings; and be sure ye neither neglect,
nor delay your endeavors to effect it, whatever it cost you, as he accounts
nothing too dear or precious for you; for if any one suffer, all ought to
suffer with him, nor think your selves religious either in your Fasts or
Feasts, or any thing else, as in using all lawful means, which possibly may
deliver the Captive, and set the oppressed free. Isai. 586.

This indeed may cost you something, for ye are like to go through many
difficulties to obtain it, but for these and the like ends, have ye your
abilities; and without aiming at such, think not your religious exercises
enough which costs you little or nothing: O! therefore, never cease, till ye
procure him either free enlargement with reparations, or a Legal trial, that
England may cease to mourn any more over this weeping spectacle.

FINIS.
