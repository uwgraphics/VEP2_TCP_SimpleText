Die Veneris, 27o Iunij, 1645.
IT is this day Ordered by the Commons assembled in PARLIAMENT, That in regard
many hundreds of the Common Soldiers lately taken Prisoners by Sir Thomas
Fairfax, have very cheerfully listed themselves for the Service of the
PARLIAMENT, against those bloody and barbarous Rebels of Ireland, and are ready
to be transported into that Kingdom with all convenient speed; That all the
Ministers of the several Churches and Chapels within the Cities of London and
Westminster, Lines of Communication and the Weekly Bills of Mortality, be
especially desired, both in the fore-noon and afternoon of the next Lords day,
to move effectually their respective Congregations, to contribute their Charity
toward the relief and transportation of those Soldiers which are willing to
adventure their Lives in so pious and honorable employment. And all such
Moneys as shall be collected by the respective Officers and Churchwardens for
this Service, shall be paid over on Monday next, to Alderman Bunce, Alderman
Kenrick, and the rest of the Treasurers appointed to receive the Fourscore
thousand Pounds upon the late Ordinance for Ireland. And the Committee of
Adventurers for Ireland sitting at Grocers-Hall, are desired to give their best
assistance for the advancing of this charitable Contribution, which shall be
issued out for the relief of the said Soldiers, in such manner as by warrant
from the Committee of Prisoners shall be from time to time directed.
