AN EXHORTATION To all People in general.

Together with a WARNING TO THE Drunkards OF ENGLAND, Who were my Companions in
the Kingdom of Darkness, whom my Soul pities.

Being a Testimony to the Way and Truth of God, by one whom the Lord has
visited, and in some measure gathered out of the World, and Wickedness thereof;
Known by the Name of Robert Maynforth.

AN EXHORTATION To all PEOPLE In general, etc.
To the Reader, or Readers.
THE several Particulars following this Epistle, are some things written and
declared, which I met with and passed through, as I traveled from Egypt and
Sodom, where out Lord Jesus was crucified, in the way as I walked toward the
Lord's holy Mountain, which the Lord is Establishing in the top of the
Mountains, and shall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations shall flow to
it, that the Lord may teach them of his Ways, that they may walk in his Paths,
which leads to the Land of Rest and Peace for ever.

For I knowing that a few Words in due Season, may be serviceable to the Weak,
and to those who have any desires after God, or such as be seeking the way to
Sion, with their Faces thither wards, that they may not look out at any dangers
or difficulties that the Enemy of their Souls shall present, but to go on in
the Name and Power of the Lord God, who will give them strength to go through
all the hardships that ever may befall them, if they be faithful to him:
Therefore, I advise all that are honest-hearted, look not forth to the Mountain
of Samaria, nor to the Temple for worship, nor to the Masters of Art (as they
are called) to be taught, who are strangers and aliens to the Life of God,
which is the Light of men, and therefore must be miserable Comforters, as I can
truly say by Experience, they were to me: Most men in this part of the Country,
who have known my Education from my Youth, know that I was brought up all my
days amongst them; so as to them it is little need of declaring or writing what
my Conversation has been, seeing they cannot but know it; yet for Truth's
sake, and for the good will I bear to all People, who have any desire^
thereafter, whose Faces I have not seen, nor they me known, I am not ashamed to
confess and declare my manner of Life, in the days of my former Conversation,
in the time of ignorance, which the Lord was pleased to wink at, that he alone
may have the Honor of his own Work, who has put it into my heart for to do
it, that he only may have the praise of the same, who is God over all blessed
for ever.

I was seventen Years of Age before I drank any strong Drink; and before I was
Twenty Years old, I was clearly let see the evil and abuse of it, and through
the occasion and acquaintance I had amongst men, I saw the Temptation, whereof
I had desire to shun, and so continued in a pretty moderation until I was
Thirty years old, and then began the Enemy of my Soul to draw me out into
Liberty and Looseness, and to keep company with proud men who delighted in
Drunkenness; and all along in this filthy Abomination, even National Priests
and Teachers were one with me in the same Excess of Riot, which blinded me the
more: and so I can truly say, the Leaders of the People caused me to err,
thinking I might do as they did; yet all that time of Darkness and Ignorance
the Lord had not left himself without a Witness within me, which testified
daily against that course of Life I then lived in, which often broke my Peace,
and troubled me many times, so that sometimes I could not sleep nor rest; and
so I continued in that condition, until I was Forty years of Age: And I having
a precious Woman to my Wife, who began to see the emptiness of the Priests
Teachings, and to leave hearing of them, finding them to be fruitless Trees,
which cumber the Ground, and burden the Creation, and bring no Fruit to God;
and she waiting in simplicity of heart, found something check and reprove her
inwardly, after which she was drawn to those People who are in scorn called
Quakers, amongst whom it was clearly manifested to her, that the Light of the
Spirit of Christ Jesus, was a sufficient Teacher and Leader into all Truth; and
then began the Priests to cast their Envy and Malice not only against my poor
Wife, but against me, for suffering her to go to the Quakers Meetings, (as they
called them) and so endeavored to stir me up against my dear Wife, and put it
upon me to tell her, If she would not cease Meeting with them, and desert them,
I might leave and forsake her; and that I ought to tell her, They met together
to commit Whoredom and Filthiness in lying one with another; and this they
pressed daily upon me; But truly they could not persuade me to believe any such
thing, because I knew her Conversation to be Chaste, and always coupled with
fear, and witnessing daily against my ungodly Practices, which I was condemned
for in my self; and being upon a time under Condemnation, for the Deeds I had
done, which she perceived, and knew at such times I was willing to please her,
that she might not condemn me also, asked me, If I would permit and allow that
some of her Friends might have a Meeting at my House; which to please her
withal (rather then out of love to the Truth) I was made willing to it: She
asked me to hear them, which I was much unwilling to: She said, If I would hear
them, if I could say any thing against what they declared, I might speak and
object: And if they could not make good what they had spoken, she would ask me
for no more Meetings: At which Meeting I was convinced, though not converted; for
by that of God in my Conscience I was satisfied that what was declared, was
Truth; so within a short time after, I was made willing to come out from the
Priests, and their Mass-Houses also, and went among the People of God, together
with my dear Wife, though with much shame and trouble, to bear the Scoffs and
Reproaches of wicked People, which caused me to reason in my self, and conclude
such Revilings and Scorn I could not bear, therefore I thought to conform a
little to my Companions and Acquaintance, and own those People too, and so I
continued at least a Year; and then I was let see, I could not be Heir of two
Kingdoms; and if I did not walk faithfully before the Lord, in what he had
manifested to me, and in me, to be my duty, who knew my heart, and the thoughts
thereof, it had been better for me not to have known the way of God, and his
Righteousness, then after to have known it, to turn therefrom: Upon which
consideration, I began to be more faithful to the Lord in what he required, and
so more strength was given me, and through the Power of his Might, I became
bolder to bear Testimony for the Lord against Priests, Tithes and Offerings,
which were only to continue during the first Covenant, and through the Lord's
power was carried over them, through Prisons and spoiling of Goods, for the
Lord's sake and his Truth, and had Joy thereby in the presence of mine Enemies.
So Friends, I can truly say, by experience, that it is faithfulness to the
Light of Christ Jesus, that the Lord requires, for to obey is better than
Sacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of Rams; therefore it is nothing of that
which is Natural of our selves, neither Carnal Wisdom, nor Humane Learning,
that can give true Knowledge of God, and his Will to the Creature; but it is
the Lord's Work in the Creature, through mercy, to reveal himself by the Light
of his Son, which has not only lightened me and some few more; but every man
that comes into the World, that through him, who is Light, and in him is no
Darkness at all, People might be saved from darkness, and the deeds thereof,
which are Carnal, Sensual and Devilish.

So all dear Hearts, to the true Light which you are all enlightened with, I
commit you, desiring you in God's fear it may lead you and guide you in all
things, at all times, and be your Counselor when you lie down, and when you
rise up; and as you come to have unity with the Light of Christ Jesus, you will
come to witness Fellow ship and Unity with God; and you will feel the strength
of his Love to constrain you to love him, honor and obey him with all your
Hearts and Souls; and so you will witness a growth, and increase in the
Knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, and so become the Disciples and Followers of
Christ, and know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you free, and by the good
Leadings thereof, receive the end of your Faith, even the Salvation of your
Souls, which is many thousand fold better than all earthly Pleasures, and all
earthly Enjoyments; therefore why should we not sell all for that Kingdom,
which fades not away, which stands not in Meats and Drinks, but in
Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost, which is prepared from all
Eternity for them that believe in the Lord Jesus, and for the Testimony of his
Name, are made willing to forsake all the World, and the Glory thereof, and
love not their Lives unto Death, so they may finish their Course with Joy, in
obeying or suffering what the Lord requires, that for a Recompense of Reward
they may receive Eternal Life, with the little Lamb^ of my Father's fold, who
cries after the Lord in the Power of his Might, to bring into his Rest the
Prodigals in England, that they may look upon him whom they have pierced, as I
have done, who was one with them in the same excess of Riot; but now through
the largeness of the Love of God I am become alive, who was dead, and for the
Seed's sake I cannot but declare those things which I have seen and heard.

R. M.

To the Drunkards of England, who were my Companions in the Kingdom of
Darkness, whom my Soul pities.
FRIENDS,
THE desire of my Heart is, that all Men might come to the Knowledge of the
Truth, and be saved, that thereby they might obtain Freedom, and come forth of
Egypt, where Darkness remains, to the Supper of the great King, where Bread
shall be given them, and their Waters shall be sure; therefore why should any
perish with Hunger, and the Way of Life and Fullness so near to every one, even
within them, Truth in the inward parts, which is sufficient to lead out of all
Error, and to guide their steps in the Paths of Peace: therefore the Way is not
so hard, as the Souls Enemy would have People believe it is, though it be said
to be Narrow, it is but to that part which cannot inherit God's Kingdom; and
those that come to Christ, who is the Way to his Father, who is the Light of
Men, to lead and guide them to his Father, and to make his Yoke easy, and his
Burden light are his Witnesses, who is that true Prophet Moses writ of, Whom
the Lord would raise like unto me, (says he) him shall you hear; and every one
that will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed. So all you who have not
obeyed nor regarded that Prophet, though you have been often check and reproved
by him in your Hearts and Consciences, though you obeyed him not, loving your
own Wills and Carnal Pleasures better then the God of your Life; and if he
should leave striving with you, you are left without Excuse, for he has
appeared to you, who appeared outwardly in the days of his Flesh, and has now
in these last days appeared inwardly by the Light of his Spirit, according to
the Scriptures, which says, Christ within the hope of glory; And blessed be
the Lord, thousands be living Witnesses of this Eternal Truth, which is herein
declared of, not out of any Self-Exaltation, but for the Praise of God whom I
honor; and the desire of my Soul, and the end of my Writing is, (according to
the good Will of God) that all may come from under Death's bonds, into the
Light of the Lord Jesus, which will let them see the Evil within them, and the
Deceivers without them, who abide not in Christ's Doctrine, but teach for
Doctrine the Commandments of Men, who are of the World, whose Ways and Worships
are vain, who are Men-pleasers, and respect men's Persons, and receive Honor
one of another, contrary to Christ and his Royal Law, who though he were a
King, he said he received not Honor from Men; but those men are set up by man,
and are not true Followers of Christ, nor keep his Sayings, therefore I am bold
to call them Seducers, who follow the Lust of the Flesh, Covetousness,
Drunkenness and Pride, whose Lives are Profane, and Works are abomination to
the Lord, and I know they are seen by many, who will confess they are such men
as serve not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Bellies, and yet will not be
diswaded from them, but love to follow their pernicious ways, rather then the
Light of Christ Jesus, which manifests them, and though they be Convinced that
they be not Godly Teachers, nor sent of him, yet they will not be Converted
from them, to the Light of Christ Jesus, which would turn them from the Power
of Satan, to the Power of God, wherein is Salvation to every one that believes,
to the Jew, and also to the Gentile; therefore is it not a sad thing to see how
the Devil betwitcheth People, and blinds their minds, lest they should be
turned to the Truth, in this Day of the Lord's Power, wherein he is more
plentiously pouring forth of his Spirit upon the Seed of Jacob, and his
Blessings upon his Offspring, which makes them cry to the Inhabitants of the
Earth, who have any sense, and be not past feeling, to come out from amongst
them, and touch not the unclean thing, and the Lord will receive them. Have you
not read in the Scripture^ of Truth, of a certain Rich Man, that Christ spoke
of who was clothed with Purple and fine Linen and fared Sumptuously every day,
who dyed, and was buried, and being in great Torments, desired to have one sent
to his Father's house, for he had five Brethren, that he might warn then lest
they should come to that place of Torment; but it was denied him. Though it be
this day testified to you through one who was dead, and is by the Power and
Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ raised from Death to Life, to warn
People, who are yet in Darkness, and under the shadow of Death, and under the
power of a strange King (to wit, the Soul's Adversary) to come forth of the
Darkness, and show themselves in the Light of the Lord Jesus, which lights
every man that comes into the World, and will show them their evil deeds, and
lead out of them, and brings Salvation to all that are faithful, and obey him,
which was the very end of his coming, to save lost Men and lost Women from
their Sins, and to destroy the Works of the Devil, (which is Sin) under which
burden of Sin and Corruption the Spirit of the Lord has suffered, and the Lamb
as one slain, whose Bowels of Love and Merey now flows forth to his Creation,
Men and Women, and would have them come to him, that they might have Life; but
the God of the world has blinded the Eye of their understanding, whereby they
are settled in a Life below the Son, the end thereof will be more bitter than
Death, for their Rest is (out of the Truth, out of the holy Mountain) in Egypt,
where the Innocent suffered, and suffers, and the Darkness remains upon such to
this day, and they will not give up to set forwards toward the Land of Peace
and Rest, for the way is tedious to that Nature they are in, and the Enemies
numerous, therefore it is high time to feel after the good Old Way, to the Land
of Promise.

So in the fear of the Lord cast away the works of Darkness, (Sin and Evil) and
come to the Light of Christ Jesus, that you may be armed with it, whereby you
may be drawn out of your Lusts, out of your Pleasures, out of your Pride, out
of your Covetousness, out of vain Worships, out of your idle talking and
foolish Jesting, out of your Drunkenness, Wantonness and Uncleanness, yea, and
from all manner of Sin, into that which is Pure, into that which is Holy, which
is of God's begetting, and is of more value then all Created Objects; is not
that of God which testifies against Sin, and Ungodliness? yea, I can truly say
that was it, which judged me, and condemned me when I was young, before I was
made sensible what it was.

So all dear People, fear the Lord, and take heed of loving your Lusts, better
then the God of Life that manifests them, with the brightness of his coming,
and with his breath, would destroy them; so then if you perish in your Evil
ways, your Destruction is of your selves, in neglecti^^ so great Salvation, and
not prizing your Sou^^ Redemption, which is freely tendered in the Covenant of
Light and Life, which is Mercy (...) speakable; and that you shall one day
confes^ you are left without Excuse to your eternal W^ and Misery for evermore,
if you go on in yo^^ Rebellion against the Lord, and you shall remember you
were warned by one, who was (...) Companion with you in your unfruitful Works
(...) Darkness, called,

The true Teacher found, which manifests men's Teachings unprofitable, who
deny the true Teacher within.
WHere is the Word, the Life and Law,
Which keeps the Children in the Awe?
Where is the Truth, the Grace, and Peace,
Which makes all Jars and Wars to cease?
Where is the Light that shines so bright
Throughout the Nations in the Night?
Where is the true and safe possession,
The righteous Law, above Profession?
Why do the Nations against it rise?
Is It not because it testifies
Against their deeds, that they be evil,
Acted in service of the Devil?
Why does the Woman Jezabel preach,
Who is forbidden for to teach,
And to seduce poor Souls with Lies,
With painted shows and feigned cries.
Though she be decked as a Queen,
All her Adulterous skirts are seen,
By those that cannot to her bend,
Nor ear unto her Witchcrafts lend,
Her Priests against delusion cries,
Although themselves be in that guise,
Being strangers to the Living way,
Amongst the dead they have their prey,
Though they the Scriptures often read,
Crying peace, peace unto the dead,
Yet they cannot the mystery see,
Whose minds are dark in the Enmity,
Though humane Learning they have store,
That makes them but adore the Whore,
Being enriched by her gain,
Causes them labor with their brain,
To keep in Darkness all they may,
Lest they should turn from them away
Unto the Truth, (which was before
False Prophet or the Scarlet Whore)
Which is the Way, Christ, the Churches Head,
Who gives his Children living Bread,
That they may never hunger more,
Being fed by his Eternal store,
Which flows forth to his Children dear,
Who are kept low in dread and fear,
Therefore all Souls that feed below
The Bread of Life; your Food we know
To be no more than fed with death,
Feeding of that which is beneath
The Son of Righteousness his Seed,
Who is Salvation sure indeed,
To all that in his Light believes,
But Sorrow to them his Spirit grieves:
Oh come to him! who cries within,
And he will redeem you from all Sin;
For he has often for you waited,
To have you turn from that he hated,
Who was not far from you, (unknown)
Checking for Sin to press it down;
He calls to all that would be free
From Sin and all Iniquity,
To cease from man, whose breath's soon spent,
And hear but him who breath him lent,
Who is to his a perfect Teacher,
And is the only Spirit reacher,
Who came men's Lives not to destroy,
But Souls to save from all anoy,
Who walks in virtue of his Life,
Knows that which kills both Lust and Strife,
Of which a measure you have within,
That never gave consent to Sin,
But stood always a Witness pure,
Against him that would you allure:
So if Redeemed you would be
Into the Christians Liberty,
Slight not your day of Visitation,
By looking at Predestination,
Not owning Christ that he should reign
In The hearts of men, Sin to restrain;
Therefore come search and try, and hear,
Without Money in God's pure fear,
And willing be on him to wait,
Till he appear, though it seem late,
Within your Breast you may him find,
If him to hear you be inclined.
So while it may be said to day,
Come, come, and see where the Lord lay;
But all that will not hear his Call,
Eternal plagues shall on them fall,
Which shall for evermore endure,
And be to them their portion sure.
The dangerous state of all People, who are out of the Covenant of Life.
A Few words to all sober-minded,
Who with darkness have not combined,
To serve that Prince for term of days,
Which he persuades, without delays,
Servants to be to Sin and Evil,
It is the covenant of the Devil:
For no less time he will agree,
Then during Life, his Slaves to be.
So all that would your freedom know,
From Sin and Satan here below,
While you are in this House of Clay,
Regard not outward Bonds I say,
For there the Enemy may prevail,
And cause your Faith thereby to fail,
Looking at things that here we see,
Which seems unpossible to be,
Being not seen with Eye of Faith,
Cannot please God, as Scripture says,
But come down to God's witness near,
Which stands in the Conscience always clear
To show unto you Words, and Deeds,
Whether savoury, or stinking Weeds:
And whether you hear, or forbear
That which reproves Sin, will be clear,
Which is most pure and light also,
And shows man Sin wherever he go
Which is God's Love to all mankind
To give them light that were full blin^
Blessed are they that faithful be
To what the Lord does let them see
To be their duty, day and night,
Acting as in their Masters sight;
Then nothing can be done in haste,
But light their Counselor, will taste
And judge that down, which does (...)
If it be not in the holy fear.
And here is the Exercise indeed
Of Christians, as they are freed:
Yet such as will not Truth retain,
But in their Lusts still will remain,
Assure themselves this is a warning
From that which gives a true discernin^
As he can say who lived in the Lust,
Before he came to know the Just,
And was as bad as they can be,
Until the Lord did let him see
By his pure Light, what he had done
Against the Record of his Son;
And then it was a time of trouble,
To see himself worse than a bubble,
And he not only in that state,
But all that did the Light so hate;
And then he wept with Sorrows grief,
Until the Lord sent him Relief,
Which was his presence to refresh
His fainting Soul near to perish.
So all wait low in Christ who is pure,
Till him you know your Souls to cure,
Who is the good Samaritan,
To cure and heal the wounded man,
And those that will not own his cure,
Eternal Plagues shall all endure;
And such from Sorrow can never cease,
Nor have therefrom any Release.
Concerning Perfection.
ALL you that scoff at Purity,
Perfection looking not to see,
While you are here on this side Grave,
Nor any thing that shall you save
From Sin, and sinning, while you are her^
Yet hopes at Death you shall be clear;
And then to pass to Rest and Peace,
And have with Death a full release;
So that no judgment can you grieve,
Because you do on Christ believe.
Is this your Hope and Faith indeed,
Who lives in the Lust, and have no need
To be redeemed from that condition?
But still runs on without suspicion,
Without the sense of deadly danger,
Being to Truth a very stranger,
And him who is the good Physician,
Who would cure with much contrition
And none but Christ can do that Cure
Of your Disease which brings most sure
Eternal death to all that love it,
And none but he can remove it.
Take heed therefore no time delay,
Lest you should miss of Cure I say
Of that so dangerous Disease,
Which without Cure brings Plagues, not case;
Therefore it is good to weigh the cause
Before you dye, to have a pause
How that your Souls may be delivered,
When that from Bodies they be severed;
For this will be both sure and true,
That every one receive their due,
And likewise be rewarded so
According to'th' Deeds they did do
In the Bodies where they had place.
Before they had run out their race;
And look how Death does stop their Wind,
So Judgment shall them surely find,
And then the Judgment shall proceed,
According as has been decreed;
And all that have not walked with God,
Assuredly shall feel his Rod,
And likewise many grievous Woes
Shall then be added to the Foes
Of the great God of Power and Might,
Who to all men has given a Light
To lead them safe from the dark Power
And from the Sorceries of the Whore:
But to his Enemies will be torment,
Because they thought not to repent,
Nor would believe that they should dye,
When they transgressed continually;
Therefore they are left without excuse
Who did his Witness then abuse,
When they preferred their pleasures here
Before the Lord, who bought them dear,
And if the Lord should striving cease,
And sorrow send, and no more peace
Unto those Souls that have not prized
The day of God, by them despised,
How great will be their cry, and sorrow
When day is past that has no morrow
Therefore all you that loves delight
In that which is darker then night,
Awakened be, and stand upright
To Christ Jesus in his pure Light,
Which shines in the Hearts, to let men see
What is not good nor pure to be;
And if obeyed in its leadings,
Will not admit such proceedings,
As brought them on with such an hand
As scarcely one to make a stand,
For to consider of their end,
That do their time so vainly spend,
Their end therefore will sadness bring,
Who counted Truth a lying thing,
And the pure Light a foolish guide,
To keep their steps, they should not slide;
By which Lord keep us in thy power,
On thee to wait for evermore.
And thy pure Truth preserve and spread,
That they may live which now are dead.
To the Backsliders in Heart.
YOu that have seen the holy Land,
Wherein ripe Grapes so fully stand,
And some of you did taste the Fruit,
That grew therein, tho now turned brute
And chooses rather with Beasts to feed,
Then to be followers of that Seed
Which would have led you to the same,
And given you an eternal Name,
If you had stood within your Tent,
And not for fear of men relent,
But to the Lord had faithful been,
Then you like Willows had been green,
And likewise fed under your Vine,
Also refreshed as with new Wine:
But now you have gotten other Lovers,
And hopes beside to have some covers,
Because of Truth you got some Words,
Which will prove to your sides like Swords;
How will you answer the just Judge,
Who do against his Witness grudge,
Which would have led you out of death,
And all things else that are beneath,
If you had been but honest-hearted,
And from the Truth never departed,
The Lord to you had been a portion,
Preserving you from all abortion,
To testify against the dark
Which have no covenant with the Ark:
But now you are in a sad condition,
By refusing your commission,
And gone to serve under the Beast,
Who promises your Souls to feast;
But you that is by the Serpent led,
And likewise by the Hireling fed,
Poor food it is unto your Souls,
You feed on Earth amongst the Moles,
The dust you know is Serpent's meat,
And Plagues is to them that do eat
Of any Bread, but that is living,
Which is not of the Father's giving,
Which he keeps for his Children dear,
Even those that do him always fear,
Then those that have their birthright sold,
For their Belly must pine with Cold,
And hunger must them pinch beside,
Because the Lord they have denied,
Who would have fed them to the full,
And clothed them better then with wool:
But seeing the Lord you have denied,
Before you came for to be tried,
What you could suffer for his Name,
Rather then to deny the same,
The greater Plagues will be your due
Then if you had not been in the view,
Of such things as are not fading,
Freely given without upbraiding
Unto all those that faithful be,
Who lives and walks in purity.
But you that have preferred your Lives,
Children, Houses, or your Wives,
Before the Lord, that bought you dear
That you his Name might always fear,
Better you had not professed his Name,
Nor have made mention of the same,
Seeing you proved so deceitful,
And to the Truth turned hateful,
What may you now of him expect,
Who does his Grace and Love reject;
For those that know their Master's will,
And accordingly do not fulfill,
More stripes are due unto their Back,
Then them that do such knowledge lack
Repent, repent I say, with speed,
That from your Sin you may be freed,
For God is near to pardon all,
That in his Life do cry and call,
Or with the Wicked receive your hire
Eternally in flames of Fire.
To the suffering Seed and Birth Immortal.
TO the Seed which yet in bondage lies,
And under great oppression cries
To be delivered from such thrall
That it is pressed down withal,
By the sad weight of earthly power,
Through the Enchantments of the Whore,
Which is gone forth over the Lands,
And's not excluded with great Bands;
For all Nations under the Globe
Polluted are with the Whore's Robe,
And none can stand against her Horns,
But in that Might that bore the Thorns,
And that is the force that will subdue
Her filthy and rebellious crew,
By which he will likewise make way
For his own Seed, without delay
To pass as through a Sea of Water,
And all his Enemies soon will scatter,
Even Pharaoh like, withal his Host,
And leave them not a man to boast
Of what they have gotten by their Might,
In all their Fightings in the Night:
Therefore all come and lay to heart
The honest thing, and set apart
That which is evil in the ground,
And keep within the modest bound,
And you will see an Army great,
That in your hearts have got a seat,
Which will be work enough to quell,
For by your strength you will not repel,
Nor any force beneath the Sun
Can that remove they have begun;
Unarmed therefore you cannot stand,
Before the power of such a band.
Nor are you likely to prevail,
But must before them surely fail,
If not well armed with the Sword
Of the Spirit, which is the Word
O'th God of Life, of Power and Might,
Able to drive all out of sight
That shall oppose his holy Will,
And likewise can their Blood soon spill;
So then its not the strength of Arm
Of Flesh that can preserve from harm,
Nor any force of humane Nature,
That can preserve men in that stature,
But that they must even soon decay,
If not refreshed day by day
With the pleasant and living streams,
Which shines so bright with Crystal beams,
Which springs, and flows in these our days,
And fills our Hearts and Mouths with praise,
That we cannot now silent be,
But to declare what we do see,
And if the Enemy should prevail
To cast our Bodies in some Goal,
As he has done, some heretofore,
Which faithful Testimony bore
Against the Rulers in those times,
Who Spirit-worship counted crimes
In this his day that God has raised
A Seed, for which his Name be praised;
And if our Mouths be stopped, from speaking
In this good day of Light out-breaking,
We know the Lord can raise the dead,
To come with praises on their head,
Though they were dead as any Stones,
And had no moisture in their Bones,
Yet that would not be Consolation
To those poor Souls in Reprobation,
But as we abide in the Spirit,
We see the wicked cannot inherit
The promises made to the Seed,
According as has been decreed;
Therefore they hate us every way,
Yet for them we can freely pray
The Lord to open their blind Eyes,
That they may see whom they despise,
And this we can desire at large,
The Lord lay not unto their charge,
What they against us here have wrought
When they our Lives and Livings sought:
So Lord, if it stand with thy Will,
Bring many Saints to Sion's Hill,
To hear thy Voice, and pleasant Song,
Which thou have sent the Babes among,
To be their comfort, in this time
Where Innocence is counted crime,
Which is a time of great trial,
To prove if we will make denial
Of our true Faith, and our Profession,
As those have done who want possession
Of that sweet Life that shall endure,
And be to thine a comfort sure,
In which, O Lord, us always keep
That we be safe, when others sleep
In their carnal security,
Blind in the darkness they cannot see,
From which, O Lord, keep us always,
In thy pure Life, thy Name to praise.
To the Hireling Shepherds.
ALL you that Preachers, made by man,
See who required that, of you than
To teach and preach for Lucres sake,
Under pretense Christians to make,
But your chief aim is for your gain,
Which makes you run with might and main,
To get your Merchandises sold
At a dear rate, both new and old,
For to maintain your greedy paunch,
Which is your God, him for to stanch,
A Law you have for to compel
People to come, to buy and sell,
Without approving of your Wares,
They must accept them as their shares,
Although they be not worth the buying,
Yet pay they must without denying:
Are not these sad and unjust things
To pay for them no profit brings?
And this you sell without control,
Which adds no comfort to the Soul,
Nor all the feigned words you steal
Cannot a wounded Conscience heal,
But daubing with untempered dirt,
Instead of Cure, you do them hurt;
For still you seem to be in nature
Ravenous Wolves in humane stature,
Which does both raven and devour
Rich men's Estates, as also poor,
Though you be clothed with Sheep-skin,
The Wolf's alive in you within,
Which makes you rob and spoil the flocks,
And utterly destroy men's stocks,
You Are Truth-resisters, by your signs,
Being the men of corrupt minds,
And such as now cumber the Ground,
For no good Fruit in you are found;
So you are proved the fruitless Trees,
And like the drones which spoil the Bees,
Although you read the Scripture true,
Without the Spirit, what does ensue
But only for your carnal Wills,
You keep poor Souls in that which kills,
To which purpose you make a trade
Even to delude Man, Wife, and Maid,
Keeping their Souls in bondage still,
If you can but the same fulfill,
To make them run for what you read,
And give you Money for that is no Bread;
For shame therefore let it suffice
That you be drunk with Avarice,
And cease teaching and silent be,
And wait on Christ he will let you see
What is your duty, and your place,
Obedient be think it no disgrace.
That you may not be of that sort,
Which of the holy Rest come short,
But that you may rewarded be
With them that lives in purity,
Which will be sweeter to your spirit,
Then all without you do inherit,
And blessed you will be also,
In every thing you do undergo,
And as you come to obey the Light,
Surely your peace will be in sight.
Lord God it grant, if that thou please,
That all that seek thee may find ease,
Through Faith in Christ as he is revealed
Who has the wounded always healed.
The Conclusion.
NOw to conclude, leaving what has been said
To all that reads it, with impartial Eye,
Which to believe they need not be afraid,
Being true Words, in which there is no Lie,
Though Godly men were always scoft and scorned
For the Name of Christ, which was their chiefest good,
Yet they rejoiced to see his Truth adorned,
Though for so doing it cost some their Blood,
Which was but that they then had left to spend,
That they thereby might gain a better prize,
Which would be sweeter to their Souls in the end
By therein dwelling where true virtue lies,
Wherein is sweetness, much better than Life
To Souls Immortal in the quiet place,
The Godly Ones who are made free from strife,
Who are engaged to run the holy race,
And come away to witness for the Lord,
And his pure Truth reproached in these our days,
Though for so doing they have been abhorred,
Which is no other but what has been always
For Truth, is Truth, and all that do err from it,
Must once confess how they have done despite,
To the Grace of God, and his holy Spirit,
By making Sin their pastime and delight;
Yet they shall know to their eternal sorrow,
That they were warned of what was then to come
Of a dark Night, which could bring forth no morrow,
Which is the portion and the Wicked's doom,
Who have not prized the day of Visitation,
In which all men are left without excuse,
By showing them wherein is Condemnation
To all the World, that does the Light abuse,
In which true sense, Lord, keep thy tender Flock,
Alive in thee for their safety and Rock.
A Godly Request.
LOrd God of Life and Power, thy Truth more spread,
That they which truly seeks within may read,
For Truth in the inward parts that thou requires,
To which, O Lord, strengthen all weak desires,
That Grace and Peace may grow in these our days
By quickening of the dead, thy Name to praise,
That so thy glorious Name may be exalted,
And that kept down which has from thee revolted
Which Work, O Lord! thou have with us begun,
Through shining of the Light of thy dear Son:
Therefore, O Lord! if that it so please thee,
Shine forth on more thy Glory for to see,
That so thy Praises may with men increase,
And thou may know, who art the God of Peace,
That they with us, and we with them may sing
Hallelujahs, and Praises unto thee our King.
THE END.
