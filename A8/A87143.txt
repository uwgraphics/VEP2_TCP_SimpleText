PEACE and not WAR: OR THE MODERATOR. Truly, but yet Plainly, STATING the
CASE OF THE COMMONWEALTH, As to several of the Considerable COUNCILS and
TRANSACTIONS from the Year 1636. to 1659.

By JOHN HARRIS, Gent. An affectionate Lover of his Countries Peace.

LONDON, Printed for Nath: Brook, at the Angel in Cornhill. 1659.

The EPISTLE to the READER.
EXpect not that I should apologize or beg thy favor, either in Buying,
Reading or Approving the Contents of the ensuing Treatise.

If in the Publishing thereof I had had profit in my eye, then it would have
been a necessary Duty incumbent upon me, in order to my ends, to have fawned,
flattered and baited my Hook with, Courteous, Ingenuous Reader, and the like;
but the bent of my Spirit and Intention carrying me another way, I have rather
chose to play at hap hazard; and although I may content none else, I am
satisfied that I have pleased my self.

I shall not give you an Abstract thereof, or like one that would allure your
liking, tell you more in the Title and Epistle than you will find in the Book,
there it is, let it speak for it self: Possibly some may judge me peremptory,
others phantastique, but for that I am armed, as neither seeking or valuing
Applause, or fearing or esteeming the Contempt or Malice of men.

Let it suffice, it is the product of several years experience, briefly, but
truly according to the succession of Councils and Affairs related, and may
serve as a Clue to guide your memories (yea and judgments too) unto a right
understanding of those things which probably hitherto you have had but some
confused Notions of; and they too so disordered, that thereby you have not been
able to weigh things aright, so as to own or adhere to those principles of
Freedom and Justice, in the attainment whereof your Peace and Prosperity
principally consists.

If I have been or shall be judged too severe or bitter in any expressions, in
relation to Persons or Councils, I am sure it is so much against my principle,
that if the Nature of the thing could have been expressed in any other terms,
and have retained the similitude, I should have forborne; but although all
Truths ought not to be spoken, yet necessary ones must, and in many Cases it is
better not to speak at all, than not to the purpose.

I have reason to believe that some will be angry, because probably they will
judge themselves concerned: it is no news for the galled Horse to kick,
especially when he feels the smart, his sore being cauterized: But I have this
advantage, Wise men will not show it, and for such as are otherwise, their
Malice cannot prejudice.

I will not Tantalize you longer, but leave you to your Likeing, having no
other end herein, than to manifest my self thine in the service of my Country,

J. H.

The Moderator: Truly Stating the CASE OF THE COMMONWEALTH, etc.
I Shall not look back so far as to the Original of the Government of Kings,
whether before the Conquest or since, nor dispute the equity or convenience of
the principles, upon which they were established; although much has and may be
spoken for and against that form, both from principles of Divinity and Reason;
on the one hand the Divine institution being pleaded, and not to be denied;
although on the other side, as to the manner of conveyance of, and investiture
in the exercise of the office of Kingship, it is alleged, that there can be
no power vested in one man over many, but it must be either immediate or
mediate: An immediate power given by God (say they) none can claim; if they
can, let it appear and we will obey gladly; but if not, then their power must
be mediate: and if so, then it must have its birth either from force, because
stronger, or consent and election: if by force, how long soever continued,
freedom may be regained by the people under that force, when ever opportunity
serves: if by consent, then there is a mutual obligation, the one to govern
by a Law, the other to obey by a Law, and this (say they) is the most sure
basis of Government, whether it be exercised by one or many. The reason they
give for this opinion ought also to be considered to prevent popular
confusions. They say where the Government of one or many is established by
compact, there the people do not convey a power to any to be exercised over
them, according to the lust or will of the Magistrate, neither do they bind
themselves unto any servile or slavish obedience, unto his or their commands,
and therefore they establish on their behalf Trustees, not only to make and
form the Law and compact, by which they will be governed, but also to see that
the same be duly performed on the part of the Magistrate, without which, say
they, it were a mockery, and not a Government, each party obliged having upon
principles of reason the same latitude of liberty to break the bond, whether of
command or subjection.

But my design driving me another way, I shall only take a short view of the
State of the affairs and Councils of this Nation, under the Government of the
late King in the years 1636. 39, 40. And so proceed till after many
revolutions, we come to find England as it were clothed with fears and buried
in trouble and confusion as at this day, from the consideration of the causes
whereof, the natural consequences will by all unbiassed persons be readily
deduced and applied.

It may be remembered into what parties the Ecclesiastical and civil Councels,
under that unfortunate Prince were divided, viz. Arminian and Puritan, among
the Bishops and Clergy, French and Spanish, among the temporal Lords, each
party seeming to be most active in advancement of the Kings interest, while
underhand they not only introduced, but also nourished and made their own
designs to flourish.

I need not mention the consequences of the Councels of those times, because
the long intermission of Parliaments, the excess of monopolies, even to pins
and all things of necessary use, the many illegal and unwarrantable Taxes of
money upon the Subject, as in the Case of ship money, which though but small in
it self, yet in respect of the principle upon which it was demanded, (viz. a
pretended necessity of which the King was sole judge) by which the very
propriety of every man's Estate was and would have been destroyed. It being by
the same rule as lawful for the supreme Magistrate to demand twenty shillings
or twenty pounds, if he see cause, out of every man's Estate, as one penny or
any other sum, because by the Grand Charter of England, and several other
Laws then in force, nothing ought to be leavied upon the subject, but by and
with the consent of the people in Parliament: I say these things are so fresh
in memory, that I shall not need to stir those embers any further that have
kindled such a fatal fire in the bowels of these divided and distracted
Nations.

Only give me leave to mention the method that was observed by the Catholic
Caball, then governing in Council, to introduce those troubles, that have
since been the necessary consequences of their then designments.

As to the King, an unlimited Prerogative was made the sugared bait to allure
him to a countenance of, and compliance with them; it being natural for all
men (especially Princes) not only to admire, but to reach at and covet the
increase of power and dominion, especially when the attainement thereof seems
to be facile, and the end advantageous.

Having brought him to their bent in that particular, then they began to spring
that mine which had for several years lain hid, viz. the introduction of
Popery, though not in its own name, nor with its own face, for as yet neitheir
their Councils nor forces were ripe for so great a work, and therefore the two
factions Spanish and French, being joined to the Arminian part of the Clergy,
who at that time greatly overpowered those that were called Puritans, set on
foot the orders for conformity and uniformity in public worship, and imposed
the public Liturgy or Common Prayer, setting the same above preaching, etc*
and this not out of any zeal to the Glory of God, but in design to heat and
perplex all such in the two Nations of England and Scotland, as were
conscientious, to the intent that by that opposition which must consequently be
made by them, whose principles could not submit to those unwartantable
innovations, an occasion might be given them to incite the King to make use of
his power by force to impose, what otherwise his Proclamations and commands
could not effect. And this from reason and experience, I allege to be the
parent of the Scotch War, begun under the command of that great Spanish Factor
Arrundell, General, who indeed was the fittest to execute what had been so
long hammering between him, his brother Cottington, and other the Cabalists of
that faction.

And by the way it is worth remembering, that while the King with all the power
of the nation was engaged in the borders of Scotland, by force to subject them,
to the designs both of his own and their enemies; the Spaniard arrives in the
Downs with a powerful Fleet and Army, the coming whereof was never so much
as known by England, or at least taken notice of until seen, although foreign
preparations do and ought, generally occasion (nay necessitate) domestic
provisions for security: But the Dutch dissipating them, diverted the storm,
and left England destitute of that proof of their design; which if it had
taken, we have cause to believe that pretended peace patcht up with the Scots,
had not been so soon made: but being put upon new Counsels, and that foreign
assistance failing, they feared to rely upon the strength of their Army; (which
though as to men gallant and numerous,) yet being somewhat divided, and all
England behind them in fears, the appearance of the Spaniard as aforesaid
having put men upon consideration; lest the design should appear both to the
King and his people, I say a peace is patcht up, the Army disbanded, and a
Parliament called, by the expectation whereof the people began a little to be
quieted, in hopes that by those Physicians the nation might be cured of all its
distempers.

But such was the composition thereof, by reason of the prevalency of the Court
in point of Elections of the Commons, and mixture of interests of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, that as little could be rationally expected from
them, as was effected by them at their meeting; for as the intention of
calling, was only to justify the Scottish War by a Law, and to get money by a
loan or subsidy to carry it on, to which the Commons would by no means
assent, so all expectations became frustrate by their speedy dissolution, and
the setting on foot new Counsels and designs to increase the flame, and
encite the King to make new leavies against the Scots, imprison several
Members of the Parliament, and Scotch Commissioners sent and attending to
ratify the Treaty, seize several of the Ships and Goods of the Scotch, and by
all means endeavor to suppress and destroy the Puritan party as they call
them, who they judged the only great enemies to the King; whereas they took
the exactest course in the world to make them such, all their designs and
actings being clothed by his power, and strengthened by his warrant and
Commission.

And to the end the want of money might not retard or hinder the vigorous
prosecution of the War, the Bishops open their bags and rain showers of Gold
thereby justly giving occasion for it to be called, Bellum Episcopale; but
notwithstanding their haste, the Scots who suspected foul play, had formed an
Army, and were upon their march into England, before they could raise and
rendezvous, and maugre their speed, after their routing of a party nigh
Newborn, engaged by the Earl of Strafford, (as is really believed) upon
design to make the War certain, the Scots enter Newcastle, and possess Durham
and parts adjacent, while the King retires to York, neither Army proceeding any
further to acts of hostility.

But by the way it is observable, the Earl of Northumberland, who a little
before could not be suffered upon any terms to pass Trent, being popular in
the North, and a moderate Protestant, must be made General, the better to
color the business; and since the Spanish assistance failed, a new foreign
force must be made use of, and the Catholic Irish, His Majesty's then
pretended most loyal Subjects must be armed, and engaged in this religious
War, contrary to reason, common rules of prudence or safety, and the
consequences whereof did soon after visibly appear in that horrid rebellion,
which ended in the sorrow and ruin of the designers.

The Scots being in England, and necessities increasing, many of the Nobility
and Gentry were summoned to attend upon the King at York, where after mature
consideration of the State of affairs, a Paliament is agreed to be summoned,
and Writs issue out accordingly.

The Parliament being met, and an account being taken of the necessities and
demands of the King, after many debates, the Parliament resolve and declare,
That unless they might be secured to sit until the grievances of the people
were considered and redressed, they would grant no supplies, nor intermedle
with the Scotch War, but leave it as they found it, or to that purpose. This
resolution was a bitter pill to the Court, and hard of digestion, but yet
necessity has no Law, down it must, and therefore an antidote must be prepared
and lie in readiness as a cure for this poison: For the case stands thus, if
the Parliament be not satisfied, then no supply; there is an enemy in the Land,
and an Army full of discontents for want of pay, the bishops bags either being
emptied or shut up: now if the Parliament pass an act for so many subsidies,
upon the confidence of their security; then though the King continue them to
sit by a Law, yet may the Army or a considerable part thereof be by money hired
to break them up, upon pretense of necessity, first created and then pleaded:
upon which resolution the King is won to pass that act so much pleaded, as
matter of his justification and concessions to the Parliament. But whether he
did really know, or were privy to the after game that was to be played upon
them, after they had granted their supplies, I shall forbear to censure; only
leave it to the judgment of the Reader upon the consideration of subsequent
transactions.

But this is evident to the knowledge and experience of the Author, that
accordingly both by Letters and Commissions under the hand and Seal of the
King, many endeavors were used to engage the Army to break up the Parliament,
the forementioned Act for their continuance notwithstanding; and upon discovery
whereof, the Parliament were constrained ( though by contracting great debts
upon the public) to undertake to satisfy the Scots, and to pay and disband
that Army to prevent the designs, that were hatched and carried on under their
covert. And this I may call the first visible cause of the Parliaments
jealousy, that the King although he did seemingly comply with them, yet
underhand did depend upon, and was guided by other Counsels.

It is not my business to give an account of the weekly proceeds of the
Parliament, only by general hints of things to lead you by a succession of
some generals, unto the remembrance of such affairs as may be conducible unto
the end proposed.

The business of Delinquents, especially the Earl of Strafford, and
disposition of the Militia, were the most considerable visible causes of
difference between the King and Parliament; other things might and did
intervene, as additionall fuel to increase that flame, which since has
scorched (if not burnt) all on both sides that had a hand in the kindling of
it: but probably busy instruments in each party, having designs retrograde to
the grand end, which should have been peace and unity, viz. Soldiers of
fortune; that desired to fish in troubled waters, and hoped to rise by others
ruins, animating the Court to extremes; the greatest whereof was the illegal
demand of the five Members; and others as busy to take that advantage, to abet
the people in Petitioning with seeming violence for such things as could not
but in that juncture of affairs create jealousies and fears in the King; I
say things being brought thus into a sudden hurry, and the people which not
many days before, upon his return from Scotland, had entertained him with
acclamations of joy; now declaiming against him upon pretense of the denial of
Justice: And being seduced by the forementioned Counselors, he first sends
the Queen for Holland, and afterward leaves the Parliament; and retires himself
from place to place, till he arrived at York; to whom the Parliament sent an
humble Petition praying his return, and several Members are Commissioned to
give his Majesty satisfaction touching his demands: But the design for War was
laid, although peace was pretended; and a seeming necessity for his departure
pleaded, upon pretense of tumults; the Parliament was a burden, and must be
removed: and it is submitted to judgment whether the design of the Queens
going to the Spaw, publish^ long before any of these pretended tumults; (which
never appeared, until the erection of the Guard of Cavalry against Whitehall,
to hinder the peoples recourse to Westminster; though with peaceable Petitions,
according to their just liberty: And his denial of justice upon Strafford,) I
say it is left to judgment, whether the bottom of the business of that voyage,
was not to buy Arms and engage Orange and the Dutch, to grant their assistance
toward the carrying on of the intended War, otherwise it is not probable that
the Jewels of the Crown by her pawned, and the money employed for that purpose,
would have been hazarded in such a voyage: But to proceed.

To initiate the War, instead of returning to the Parliament, although often
Petitioned to that purpose; a guard must be raised for the security of his
Majesty's person, and accordingly is; in the mean time several Members of
Parliament, (whether through fear of the event, or hopes or promises of
advantage; or by what other allurements I shall not determine) Betrayed their
trusts, left the Parliament, and went to the King at York; thereby not only
giving countenance to those proceedings, but also much lessening the power of
Parliament. In the mean time Commissions were issued underhand, for leavies of
men, in order to form an Army against the Parliament; and Provisions in hand
for the erection of his Standard at Nottingham, which was soon after put in
execution: These preparations put the Parliament upon new thoughts, and seeing
neither Messages nor Petitions could prevail, and that there was a necessity
laid upon them, either to betray the Liberties of the people, that had trusted
them, and the Laws of the Nation, into the power of those evil Counselors,
who had as aforesaid abused and betrayed the King and Kingdom into so many
troubles; or otherwise to cast themselves upon the affection of their Trustees,
and the justice of their cause; and in defense thereof to raise an Army, which
they accordingly did, and put the same under the Command of the Earl of Essex;
with Commission only to defend their Authority, and protect the people as much
as might be from the force of the enemy.

I shall not enumerate the various successes of the Armies, being unwilling to
renew the tears of the Parents, Widows and Orphans; made Husbandlesse,
Fatherless and Childlesse in that unhappy War; only in respect of some
subsequent transactions, I must give a hint or two of some remarkable passages,
upon the basis whereof a great part of the succeeding narrative depends.

The War being prosecuted with violence in all parts of the Nation, an
association of Essex and other Counties was made, and a distinct Army, raised
under the Command of the Earl of Manchester; others were on foot in other
parts, according to their respective necessities under Sir William Waller, etc.
But Manchesters Army being molded for the most part of sober serious
Christians, though of different judgments; God was pleased signally to own
them in their actings and successes, more then any other force employed at that
time on the behalf of the Parliament; and particularly in that engagement at
Marston-Moore, and the siege of York: The defeat then given being the first
considerable weakening that ever the Kings party received. I confess there were
joined in the said engagement the Scots, who had been called in to the
Parliaments assistance: But as to their merit in that engagement, except some
few of the Gentry, I think it will become me to be silent, the whole brunt of
the day lying upon the Forces of Fairfax and Manchester; and indeed it may well
be reputed a sharp engagement, seeing all the Generals on both sides left the
Field, not knowing the success: In which days Exercise, Col: Cromwell, then
Manchesters Lieutenant General, did eminently merit the praise of a prudent
and valiant Leader: Not to derogate from those many others, in whose places
respectively, they valiantly and faithfully discharged their duties.

But by the way, give me leave to mention a passage that happened soon after that
engagement; during the second siege of York as I may call it: The success of
that battle and daily expectation of the surrender of York, then despairing
of relief; put the Army upon great expectation of a sudain alteration of
affairs, either by a total conquest or speedy and effectual treaty;
whereupon the Earl of Manchester and L: G: Cromwell discoursing concerning the
regulating the exorbitancy of the Nobility; L: General Cromwell hastily
replied, that it would never be well with England, so long as the Title of a
Lord remained; by which it might have been judged, that such a principle of
ambition as afterward manifested it self, had not lodged in his breast: But we
see all is not Gold that glisters, opportunity makes thieves; and therefore it
is not safe to trust the most specious pretenses, if it may be avoided, for
fear of the like danger.

But as the Parliament gained in the North, they lost in the West; the
different Commands creating different interests, so that the work was not like
to prosper, unless there was a new model; upon which the Gentleman last
mentioned being a Member of the house, and having gained to himself a
considerable party, upon the repute he had of honesty and gallantry: He then
seeming, (and I really believe) at that time was a great lover of, and
encourager of godliness; I say having gradually increased his interest, and
yet being unwilling it should appear too considerable; his design being not
probably ripe for execution, a selfdenying ordinance was introduced, (I will
not say by whom;) although the consequences thereof may and do speak handsomely
to that purpopse: For that being passed, both Essex, Manchester* Waller, and
all the Members of Parliament, whether Lords or Commons, were out of Command,
and himself too. So that as to the face of things, no man could judge of any
design in him, more then the public good: But things remaining in this
posture, a General must be thought on, and accordingly Sir Thomas Fairfax, a
Gentleman of unquestionable integrity, and full fraught with gallantry; (but a
person of a passive Spirit as to Counsels,) was made General; and the Forces
put under his Conduct: who no sooner was upon a march, and drawing nigh to a
possibility of engagement; but he directs a letter to the Parliament, therein
desiring that Lieutenant General Cromwell might be sent to his assistance,
upon which the house by a resolve empower him thereto; for I never yet heard of
any other Commission: upon this he repaires to the Army; and in the quality of
Lieutenant General manages the affairs, and steeres the Counsels thereof,
upon whom he had a mighty influence, as having been the instrument of many of
their advancements; so that in effect, what ever success attended that Army,
the Major part of the honor returned to the Lieutenant General; besides the
advantage by increase of interest and disposing of Commands; he countenancing
and discountenancing whom he pleased, according as they were instruments fit to
be employed in his then growing designs.

I shall wave the various occurrences of the War, and look forward till we find
the War ended; and the King delivered by the Scots for a sum, (much exceeding
the salary of Judas;) where remaining under an honorable restraint at Holmby,
Commissioners were sent to treat with him, upon an accommodation fit for the
King to grant and the Parliament to require; but as heretofore, that treaty was
rendered also successeless; the reason thereof is not very obvious: yet if the
probable conjectures of some that in other things have not been mistaken, may
be believed, the Kings obstinacy in that treaty, had its rise from some
encouragement given him of the division of the Army, then set on foot by a
party that called themselves Presbyterian, at least seemed such, on pretense of
the relief of Ireland; whereas in truth there was nothing less in design, then
to divide the Army, and to draw off pretensively for Ireland; such a party as
they knew would join with them in their design against them, they called
Independents, and to disband the rest, and to bring in the King merely upon the
settlement of a Presbyterian interest; which though I cannot but judge some of
them godly men, yet so far as they are rigidly acted, upon that principle of
coercive power over men's Consciences; I think it would be madness to empower
them by a Law, who have a zeal but not according to knowledge; and are led by a
hot-braine party, some whereof are Ministers; who could not endure the exercise
of that power in the Episcopal Clergy over themselves, but cried it down as
Antichristian, and yet are ready to contest unto fire and faggot for the
exercise of it over their brethren, every way as learned, pious, laborious and
faithful as themselves; though probably not so covetous, as to have two or
three Livings and Lectures: But this by the way. The treaty was dissolved, and
the Army refused to disband or be divided, until they had their Arreares
secured, and saw the ends proposed by the Parliament, as the fruit of all that
blood, and treasure that had been exhausted in the War, in some measure
answered to the people, of which they were a part as Englishmen, as well as
Soldiers: The flame being thus kindled by the hot-spurres of the house, Holis,
Prinne and the rest; Major General Skippon and others more moderate must be
employed to quench the fire; and in the mean time a new design is set on foot
to remove the King from Holmby to some place of security, and then in his name
to declare against the Army and their abettors in the house; and by that means
to bring all the fury of the wearied people of the Nation upon the Soldiery,
that had been in the hand of God, instruments of that peace they then enjoyed;
and had it not been wisely foreseen and prevented, the consequence thereof had
been much worse, to several thousands of the godly people of this Nation, then
either the Bishops persecution, or former War; I confess I must call the work
good, though not the manner of it, nor event, to remove the King out of the
hands of a party, that intended to monopolize his power, to the ruin of their
brethren; I think was not only fit, but of absolute necessity: But to deny the
giving the Command, and to call God publicly to witness a lie, as did the L.
G. in Parliament, as I have been informed; I look upon it if true as the first
rivolet that began to let in a deluge of miseries upon himself and family. But
the King was removed, and the camp metamorphosed into a Court, some of the then
principal Commanders learning to flatter sooner then they could to fight.

How the King was courted as to the giving of honors, thereby endeavoring to
render the advancement of four or five General Officers, the price of the blood
and treasure spent in the War; several papers printed and published by some
that were nicknamed Levellers, and confirmed with the loss of their bloods as
sure testimonies, may sufficiently evidence; and for my part, I do really
believe when the King lay at Causham, and was afterward upon his public and
solemn engagement, not to do any thing that might tend to the disturbance of
the Peace; (besides his private promises to Whalley and others) that the
Commanding part of the Army, did really intend his re-establishment; otherwise
it would not have been pressed with such Candor and Zeal, by their addresses to
the Parliament; neither would they (having Petitioned the Parliament, not to
Command them to bring the King nearer London,) notwithstanding bring him to
Hampton Court; and permit the Scots Commissioners to have free access; whereby
the King became liable to the breach of his engagement, by giving Commission to
Hamilton to invade, and also thereby gave birth to all those following
insurrections of Surrey, Kent, etc. set on foot by the royal Presbyterian
sticklers, on purpose to give time by busying the Army, for Hamilton to fall
into the Association; which if effected, the consequences thereof may be easily
judged.

I need not mention the dispute between the parties, about the Militia of
London, nor the issue thereof; since it produced no good on their part that
contrived it: But the flight of some and imprisonment of others; and the
positive owning of that party of Parliament that were opposers of that
interest. Only it will be worthy consideration what method was then observed
by O. C. who then managed all the affairs of the Army in effect, and had as
hazardous a game to play between the Insurrecters and Levellers as ever came to
hand* For the case thus stood, the King (by whose restoration he expected the
old honor challenged by the Cromwells, as was then suggested; and upon whose
account he had exasperated his truest friends) had left him in the midst of a
divided Army, fired with discontents, all ready to fall on him; (a considerable
part of the Parliament then sitting, being disobliged and angry; as having some
jealousies that he designed his own greatness) to oppose the fury of a potent
Nation; backed with the power of a rich and prevalent party in the Kingdom;
besides the relics of Royalty, that the Sunbeams of his complacency and
countenance, had also warmed and enlivened to give him new trouble.

Seeing himself thus ensnared, if by the most real discovery of his sorrow and
shame for his aberation and wandering he could unite a considerable part of the
Army to stand fixed, and disband or Casheere the wilful, yet they must divide
into the several parts of the Nation; where the appearance of enemies required
their service: Leave the King to the charge and care of the Parliament, he dare
not; and to carry him with him in his Marches both troublesome and dangerous,
therefore first the discontents of those called Levellers, must be heightened,
on purpose to give occasion of telling an officious, but false lie to the King
to incite fear, viz. that the Levellers intended his death by some sudden
attempt, by which bait and the treachery of some of his own confidents, he was
dril'd unto the Isle of Wight; whither Colonel Hammond was sent to receive
him; yet all this while the Parliament were kept in Ignorance, and must be, it
being not ripe for discovery till the issue of Ware-Rendezvouz was seen, and
then just in the nick, as if the product of providence, news of the Kings
being taken is promulged with much joy; when he was never loose, but trapan'd
as they call a snare faster then ever.

Having thus secured the King, the next work is to quiet the Rebels, before
the Scots could be ready to invade; but the work proving of greater difficulty
and length then was imagined, had not the goodness of God, assisting Major
General Lambert in his Conduct, beyond expectation retarded their march: It
had been impossible for the Forces out of Wales, to have joined, or been in a
condition to Fight them; much less give them such a total overthrow, as the
success of that day did manifest.

After the rout of Hamilton, and reducing of Colchester; we are at leisure to
consult future safety, and in order to that, both parties are at work; the
Royal pretended Presbyter, whose interest depends principally upon the King:
They press on a treaty, and the other (as they had reason) find no ground to
trust him, that had broke such a solemn engagement, and put the Nation to so
much hazard: besides the expense of Blood and Treasure, which at that juncture
of time was a great aggravation; so that now the scale is turned, and that
party that formerly thought nothing the King offered satisfactory, are now
willing to receive any thing: And the other party that formerly were willing to
depend upon the Kings personal engagement, will not now trust his oath, though
ratifyed by a Law, as knowing that Princes acted by policy, judge no obligation
of force that thwart's their designed power or advantage.

In the pursuance of these ends both parties act, the Royal Presbyters are at
the old trade of Petitions and engagements abroad, thereby to give countenance
to their proceedings in Parliament; and being prevalent in the house, Vote not
only a treaty in the Isle of Wight, but also without much ado, as if the
matter were concluded by instruction, Vote the Kings concessions satisfactory;
when if what was offered at Uxbridge, upon those Propositions, and at Holmby by
the King personally were considered, it will appear that there was more reason
for the acceptance of peace then, then now; the case being much altered: but it
is evident it was not their affection, but the necessity of their interest,
that drew them to this change of opinion.

The other party had no reason if they could avoid it, to suffer these
proceeds; the ratification whereof must needs concenter in their ruins. The
consideration whereof made then, not only to consider the carriage of affairs
by the King, who had left no means unattempted to destrey the Parliament, and
inslave the people, and that in opposition to that design, the people (being
acted by them as their Trustees) had hazarded their Lives, and spent their
Bloods and Estates; that therefore unless they would bring all the Blood that
had been shed upon their own heads, they ought in judgment and Conscience, at
least by a public trial of the King, to assert the public justice of the
Nation; in opposition to that principle of being unaccountable save only to
God: In pursuance whereof the treaty was dissolved, the King removed; and soon
after the Heads of the said faction, that had so often attempted upon the
Parliament, as to breach of Privilege; endeavor to divide the Army,
underhand contrivances as to occasion the late insurrections; of which
several of them might have been convict, if the more weighty affairs of the
Nation then on foot, had not constrained the Parliament to wave their
prosecution, and remain satisfied, in that the Clogs, that made their Chariot
wheels go heavy, were removed.

As to the results touching throwing down Kingship, as dangerous and
chargeable, Peereship as useless, and for the trial of the King; the Records
of Parliament being extant, I shall omit to treat any further thereon, only I
shall add this and submit it: Whether seeing on all hands it is granted that
the King, before he could do any regal act, did solemnly swear to rule
according to the established Law, and to grant such Laws as the people should
choose; whether I say the Parliament, that were the most proper judges on that
behalf, had not power by Law to call him to account for the breach of the said
oath; especially seeing the breach of the said oath is without all manner of
question.

And whereas it is alleged by those who cannot deny the former, that although
the King may be accountable to a Parliament, as the proper judges of Law, and
the breaches of it; yet it ought to be legal and free. As touching these
objections, they shall be in due time answered, to the satisfaction of all
those that are not wilfully blind: But I must proceed with my narrative.

The King being tried and Executed, whether by direction of Parliament, or to
gratify a particular design, concerns not me to dispute: however the waters
that had been troubled, grew smooth and calm, and the Parliament began to cure
those sores that our many years troubles had occasioned.

In particular, many public debts were satisfied, contracted upon the public
faith, in the beginning of the War; and increased by new securities in the
progress thereof. In short, affairs were so managed by the prudent conduct of
Counsels, that not only Ireland (whither O. C. was sent General) was in a
competent measure reduced; but also the foreign Trade enlivened, and the most
probable grounds of a sure peace laid, that outward appearances could
warrantize; and from impartial judgments it must be allowed that England
could never have been so unhappy, as to have run these risgoes of change and
hazard, had not the aforesaid parties, Counsels and actings, been the
principal designers and instruments therein; but as their malice is
implacable, so their endeavors are diligent and without intermission; as the
product whereof, the Scotch were encouraged to a treaty at Breda, with the
Eldest Son of the late King, (since Crowned King of Scots,) it being from old
experience known, that they never durst attempt any thing of late times against
this Nation, without encouragement by, yea and silver contributions too from
Engl. they being a people principald to gain, who ever lose; and to make their
design faster* they made sure of the Lord Fairfax, who (as was said before) was
a Gentleman exceeding passive in Counsels, though otherwise valiant and active;
it becomes not me to dispute the reasons of his dissatisfaction in some cases,
what ever is not of faith is sin, let it now suffice, he refused to engage
against the Scots, and thereby put the Parliament to the necessity; and sending
for O. C. then General in Ireland, who had much ado to order his affairs
there, so as to come timely to receive the power of General, notwithstanding
many letters sent him on that behalf: But Providence ordered that the
Parliaments Idol should be their Scourge, otherwise probably as able, as
honest, I am sure as faithful and less dangerous, might have had the Conduct
of that affair, and left him to the enjoyment of one, that by that means would
not be contented with three: But he loved to be Courted, that when time offered
he might twit the Parliament with their necessity and his service.

Into Scotland he marches, and to give him his due, he under-went many
hard-ships; besides a dangerous fit of sickness, from which if God had been
pleased in mercy to deliver him by death, I believe he had not been guilty of
that perjury, blood and apostasy that afterward he contracted.

Being recovered, and the after-game (though not at Irish) to be played in
England, he having a man to enter, followed hard after and entered in season;
hit the blot at Wor^ester, and came off Victor, returned to Westminster;
entered the quarters of the Court, viz. the Cockpit, where he played the game
so cunningly, that wanting enemies abroad, he Conquered his Masters at home;
and brought such an unparalled force upon the Parliament, as never any King
of England, (though invested with a legal and Regal authority) durst attempt,
and for the doing thereof in point of justification pleaded necessity;
alleging that they designed to perpetuate their power, whereas if I be not
informed amiss, when dissolved, they were passing the act for successive
Representatives, and had dissolved themselves and given a period to that Law
for their continuance, within very few days afterward.

But such a dissolution could not suit with his Aims: had they dissolved
orderly, the power in the intervall would have been legally in the Council of
State, and a necessity could not have been set on foot to call a Convention of,
(I believe honest men;) but of interests and opinions as various as the colors
in Joseph's Coat, and as unlikely to cement in order to security, service or
settlement, as tissue and broad* cloth, which constantly fret and wear out
one another.

But the success of that convention was suitable to the design of their
calling; for though during their sitting, they did nothing of any considerable
moment; yet at their rise, a party of them gave the power into the hands of the
General, who under color thereof took upon himself the Title of Lord
Protector, but exercised the power of a Tyrant: all his Ordinances imposed on
the people, being the mere products of his will, and formed upon the great plea
of necessity by him created.

Should I ennumerate the manifold advantages that England did receive by his
Government, I fear this incredulous generation would not believe it, or at
least would be distasted thereat; I shall therefore only mention some few for
public satisfaction.

First, that honorable and advantageous peace made with Holland.

Secondly, that glorious War made with Spain, (Enlands fast friend in all the
late Troubles,) by which the Trade of England is more detrimented, then by all
the Wars we have had since 1638.

Thirdly, that gallant Expedition to Santa Domingo, whither was sent a
considerable Army upon two accounts, as is believed, the one to rid himself of
some discontented Officers, which he feared would obstruct his second design of
Kingship; the other if the design took to render himself able by the expected
Treasure, to maintain a Mercenary Army, to subject the people to his arbitrary
Commands, which he judged the more facile, in respect of the pretended ease he
gave them in abatement of Taxes; which he did not so much out of affection to
the people, but to contract debts, and impose the payment thereof upon his
pretended Parliaments, thereby giving the people not only an occasion of
Complaint; but also by degrees eating out their affections to Parliaments, and
rendering the only means of their restoration to freedom, burdensome, if not
irksome and insupportable.

But because his great expectation in the Indies, proved but a golden dream,
to save his credit the Spanish War must be prosecuted in Flanders, and in order
thereto a peace is made with the French, an Army is formed and transported
under the Conduct of Sir John Reynolds, a new Knight made by the Protector,
some say as a reward for his Apostasy from, and treachery to the Levellers at
Burford; of which if he were guil^y, the hand of Providence, if not Justice met
with him and his Comrade in their return from Flanders, where they were buried
in the Sea without triumph, or tears, other then their own, their loss being
concealed as long as possible; till the trumpet of Fame proclaimed the
certainty thereof, maugre all opopsition.

I shall not take upon me to give any reason, why the success of this Army
should be different from the former, although if their principles be compared,
it may give some little light thereto; let it suffice that their uninterrupted
success gained him much credit, and rendered him very considerable abroad,
though not much loved at home; his whole life being accompanied with plots and
conspiracies, some whereof were real, although others it is feared of his own
contriving: But to proceed.

Fourthly, his frequent Imprisonment of the Gentry and others, many whereof he
had no other cause of exception against, then that they were faithful to their
principles, and so could not comply with his ends, and therefore as to be
feared, so to be secured, and that not only for months but years, to the
ruin of themselves and Families.

Fifthly, his frequent mockeries of the people in calling and dissolving
Parliaments, allowing them a face of freedom in point of election; but
afterward winnowing the Wheat from the Chaff, leaving few or none to sit, but
such whose interest or principles engaged them to employ their wits in the
advancement of his Aims; they being but the journey-men to do the work, that
was cut out by his Cabinet Junto, and as long as they acted in order to that
end, they had good words and were feasted, but if they ran Counter, then old
Harry with his dagger, I mean Oliver would clap his hand upon his Sword or
breast, and not only threaten but dissolve them; of the truth whereof we had
several examples.

I need not mention that great juggle of the Act for Kingship, and his cunning
denial of the Title, (which was the only thing he gaped for,) because he saw
some eminent persons in his Army, which though nearly related, did abominate
his Apostasy; although by secret threats, and ingratiating promises, he did
endeavor to allure them to a compliance with the actings of Parliament, with
whom it is believed he was really angry, because they accepted his answer,
whereas he expected that they should have both passed and imposed that Title
upon him, and enabled him to plead necessity, as he did in assuming the
Protectorship.

But I fear if I should mention any more of his good acts, I should either tire
or offend the Reader, and therefore I shall leave him to the obloquy that is
due to a Tyrant and Usurper, and proceed to the short Reign of his successor,
who was a Gentleman that had very few other faults, but that he was his Son,
and so unhappily became heir to the fruits of his Fathers Rapines and
Oppression.

Under whose Government, the difference may easily be discerned betwixt the
Father and the Son, the first Governing the Council, the second being governed
by the Council.

One Parliament was by him called, and not without necessity, for not only his
Right in point of his Fathers nomination to the Protectorship was litigious and
doubtful, but also the engagements under which he groned, left upon him by his
Father, by reason of the Arreares of the Army and Navy, and other public debts
amounting to some millions, engaged him to that course, notwithstanding which,
such was the good husbandry, that as it is said many thousands of pounds were
spent in a payment-like funeral, and in mourning bestowed on them that were
able enough to buy it them selves, and had reason to do it, as having gotten by
his Life, and were like to be losers by his Death.

How the interests in that Convention (for I call them Parliaments, for
form-sake, not because I judge them legal) their proceeds being but as of
yesterday, and so fresh in memory, I shall forbear to examine, only by the
consequences, you may discern the composition, for by the conjunction of the
Cavalier, royal Presbyter, and new Courtier, the Commonwealths party
(notwithstanding they had almost all the wit and reason of the house on their
sides,) yet when it came to the Vote right or wrong it was carried against
them, and such Counsels set on foot in order to the heightning the pretended,
but not intended Court; and oppressing the good people under the notion of
Anabaptists, and Sectaries, Quakers and the like, all men that were opposers of
that interest, being charged with some capital Character of distinction,
thereby to render them marks of obloquy or subjects, of terror and
discouragement. And in this, being strengthened with an assurance of the
Concessions of the Protector, they were heightened to that confidence, that
contrary to all reason or former president, they took upon them to impose upon
the Army, by denying them the liberty of meeting together to consult their
affairs either as Englishmen, or Soldiers, although but to Petition; the
peoples right whereto has been so publicly asserted, and contested for by
former Parliaments.

To mention these things, amongst others then in design, the effect whereof we
have now seen, although then under Covert, gave the Army just cause, not only
to consider the Consequences of those Counsels, with the dangers accrewing;
but also to look back to their former actings, Counsels and engagements, and
in order to the prevention of impending troubles, which if the Parliament then
sitting were continued, would not only be nourished, but receive Countenance
to the introduction of Monarchy, and ruin of all such as had been the opposers
thereof: and not only so, but a gap must have been opened to a bloody
persecution of many thousands of the good people of Engl. under the notion of
Anabaptists, Seekers, Quakers and the like, many whereof though differing in
judgment, are faithful to God and serviceable to the nation. I say these
considerations amongst others induced them to press the Protector to consent to
their orderly dissolution, which at length he granted, and caused to be done by
Proclamation; thereby putting at that present a check to the design which now
has manifested it self, and without all manner of question, had been on foot
sooner by some months, had that power been continued.

Being freed from that fear, they cast about for future security; and in order
thereto by a Declaration invite the Parliament, called by the King, chosen by
the people, and continued by a Law, made in full and free Parliament; who in
the day of Englands greatest straits stood in the Gap, and on whose Counsels
and actions so perfect an Impresse of the power, and owning of God was engraven
in indelible Characters; I say calling to mind what foundations of justice,
freedom and security to all persons, either fearing God or living peaceably,
was by them laid in the settlement of a Free State without a King or house of
Peers, they not only invite them to the exercise of the power from which they
were illegally forced by their late General, but also engage themselves to
stand by them and defend them against their and the Nations Enemies.

Upon their meeting or immediately after, the Protectorship ceases, and all
things are reduced as nigh as may be to the order they were in, when the force
was put upon them. I shall not trouble the Reader with a journall of their
proceedings, since the Press abounds with subjects of that nature; only in
respect I find much dissatisfaction upon the Spirits of some persons that are
otherwise well-affected, who scruple their right to the exercise of the
Supreme Authority, and some such other frothy exceptions, I shall in a sober
manner offer to consideration, the following particulars.

1. That this Parliament was called by the Kings Writ, and freely chosen and
sent up by the Country, as their Representatives and as such owned by the King.

2. Whereas it is objected that the death of the King did dissolve them, it is
answered; That it is true in all Parliaments but this: and had not they been
continued by an act, the death of the King had dissolved them also: but if the
death of the King, could not repeal that Statute which is undeniable, then is
their power of sitting warranted by Law, and in this case there is no
Interregnum, otherwise by the same rule upon the death of the King, all the
Laws of the Land must lose their force, and the Government divolve into its
first Choas, which were madness for any man to imagine.

3. Whereas it is further alleged, that although they were continued by an
act, yet they were then a full and free Parliament, consisting of three
Estates, according to the Ancient Constitution of England, it is answered; That
the peoples Representatives, the Commons Assembled in Parliament, were the
Original Authors and Founders of that Constitution pleaded for; and as former
Parliaments had the liberty of establishing that form of Government, which in
that Age might to them seem good and convenient, or at least being under a
force (notwithstanding many struglings to obtain their Freedoms,) were
necessitated to take what the Tyrants would afford them; (the truth whereof the
contentions between the Kings and people in all Ages, about the great Charter
of Liberties, does plainly demonstrate;) I say be it upon which side soever,
the peoples now Representative, have as good a power to alter the form then
established, and to introduce a new one if by them deemed most suitable and
advantageous, to the people that entrusted them, as the former Parliaments had
to establish that; otherwise the power of repeal of Laws, though never so
destructive to the people is taken from them; and they that upon the clearest
principle of reason and Law, are the most proper judges, are rendered but
Ciphers altogether useless and unnecessary.

But as to the main part of the objection, the Parliament consisted of three
Estates, viz. Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal and Commons; for in the
Constitution of our Parliaments, I do wholly exclude the King, who is in the
judgment of Law deemed Major singulis, sed minor universis, and so cannot be
brought into balance with the Parliament, who according to the practice of
former Ages before the Conquest, (to which Governments the Conquerers
submitted) Parliaments were the great and only Conciliators, by whose
Counsels the Kings were wholly directed; they having only a power of advising
with, but not of imposing upon the Parliament, as to the election or repeal of
Laws, as by Ancient Records if examined will evidently appear, the late
practice now pleaded as a principle, having by degrees been introduced and
imposed on the people; and that which was a violation of their Charter of
Liberties, only warranted by Custom, against Law. But now there are no Lords,
and not half the number of Commons, that by the Law is allowed to constitute an
House. It is answered, That when the Parliament was thus constituted and
continued with one consent, they agreed in a public Remonstrance, wherein they
unanimously declared, not only what were the Grievances of the Nation, by
reason of the misgovernment of the King and his evil Council, but do also
engage themselves to act as one man for the reformation of the abuses both in
Church and State; and this I call the Good old Cause, at first owned and
asserted by the Parliament.

In their endeavors to accomplish these ends, undertaken so solemnly and upon
such serious grounds, they meet with many obstructions; and the King
endeavoring to protect Delinquents, by forsaking the Parliament and leavying
of war, many of the Lords and Commons that had espoused the said good cause,
and in their judgments declared it to be so, basesly apostatized, and joined
with the King against the Parliament, of whom they were Members, and with whom
they had engaged for the obtaining a Reformation; and I hope if they were
called by Writ to sit at Westminster, without an adjournment of the whole, they
could not upon any legal account set up a Juncto at York or Oxford; and in
doing thereof, I hope it will not be denied, but that they justly forfeited
their privilege as Members, and brought themselves under the judgment of the
Parliament for such their treasonable desertion. And thus one part of your
Lords and Commons, so much pleaded for, are rightfully divested of that
Authority.

As to your Lords Spiritual, They were those that had introduced those
Innovations in Church-worship; and in order to the supporting themselves
therein, had set on foot the Scotch war; and therefore when they saw the
Parliament endeavoring to strike at the root, and that they, as principal
instruments in mis-leading the King, were like to feel the lash of the Law;
they being backed by a part of the Lords Temporal and Commons engaged in the
same compact, make a protest against the Proceedings of Parliament, and for
that unparalleled and treasonable breach of Privilege are committed to the
Tower; and as Obstructers and Hinderers of that good work of Reformation, by a
resolve of both Houses are disabled to sit in Parliament: neither did I ever
hear or read that that Exclusion was deemed illegal.

The two Houses being by this time much lessened in number, though not in
power, they transacted together in the management of the War against the King
and his evil Council, and still in all their Declarations, Propositions and
Treaties insist upon the same Cause, viz. The Reformation of abuses both in
Church and State, and offer several suitable expedients for redress thereof.

The war being ended, they that in the wilderness were united, being in Canaan
in peace, began to divide, as to the manner of doing what both parties agreed
convenient to be done. These divisions made the Chariot-wheels go heavily, and
what Reason could not prevail in, Faction must; a corrupt party, as aforesaid,
in both Houses endeavoring, for by-ends, to prevaricate, and after all the
blood and treasure spent to obtain the forementioned ends, they endeavor to
bring in the King merely to gratify their own particular interests, wholly
waving the public cause so much before contended for: and in order to the
accomplishme^t of the said end, because they could not obtain it by Vote, they
bring a force upon the Parliament, and necessitate the Speaker and other the
Members of the House, that opposed their proceedings, to fly to the Army for
protection; and not only so, but in all their future actings and debates in
the House, endeavor to divide the Army, and introduce the King by a
clandestine Treaty, set on foot in the Isle of Wight* after Hamiltons invasion
by the Kings Commission, whereby he had not only rendered himself an implacable
enemy, but also a person not to be trusted, having made and broke such solemn
engagements, to the hazard of the Nations peace, and great expense of blood and
treasure, thereby justly engaging both Parliament and Army to a resolution of
proceeding against him according to Justice; which being for the reasons
aforesaid opposed by the said corrupt royal party, and all their actings being
diametrically opposite to the peace of the Nation and privilege of Parliament,
they were kept out by a party of the Army appointed for that purpose, and that
Exclusion confirmed by the Parliament, who certainly are the judges of their
own Members, and may exclude as many or whom they please, if any just cause
appear to them for so doing.

And as to the five or six Lords remaining in the Upper House, who, its from
good reason believed, had never staid with the Parliament so long, if they had
judged their interest as considerable on the Kings party. If either the
principles upon which they were established, viz. The will of the King, or
their frequent actings, not only to balance but overtop the interest of the
people in their Representatives, by denial to pass many other good Laws
proposed by Parliament, as well as the Act against Kingship, but also their
challenging and exercising an arbitrary jurisdiction over the lives and
liberties of Commoners, over whom by Law they had no power or cognizance, even
to the subversion of that Government, by the which they pretended to stand as
Peers: I say, if these things be considered, it cannot be denied to be as legal
an Act as ever the Parliament did, when they voted them useless and
unnecessary, and reduced the Power to its first principle, viz. To the supreme
Authority the people, in their Representatives the Parliament; neither can it
by Reason or Law be alleged, that all or any these Mutations, Changes and
Interruptions should take away or destroy their legal power, if there remained
but Two and forty, although it be evident that there remains a far greater
number, and such too, as in all the Nations Troubles have been most eminent for
Piety, Integrity and Stability, in principles tending to Freedom and Security.

I might hereto add the signal blessing of God upon all their Councils and
Actings, in so much, that not one weapon formed, or design set on foot against
them, has prospered; but they have had cause of rejoicing, while their Enemies
have been ashamed.

But I find another Objection, and that is newly sprung up, viz. That they were
not only dissolved by their General, but submitted to the power of the
Protector, owned and acted under the Government as Members in his Parliaments,
as they call them, and as Justices of the peace, and the like, and therefore
their power of sitting as a Parliament must needs cease. To which I answer,
That their Servant might and did by force interrupt them, but could not
dissolve them, because he had not power to repeal that law made for their
Continuance; and it is worth observance, how he and his Accomplices were
infatuated, in that in all his Conventions (in some of which he had power
enough) he never attempted the repeal of that Statute, which, although such a
repeal could not have been legal, yet it would have given some color to this
Objection* but the Law being continued, they could not be legally dissolved.
And as to the other part of the Objection, it is fit to distinguish between
Generals and Individuals. I do believe that some particular Members might and
did act under his power, as John or Thomas, etc. but not as a Parliament; the
actions of one, or some few, not being to be applied to the whole. I confess,
had the Parliament, as now constituted of such and so many Members, acted in
order to the support of his Tyranny, or submitted to his Authority, by
transacting with him, the case had been clear; but their actings as
Individuals, while under a force, and that being upon principles of necessity,
submitted to, only to gain an opportunity to struggle for recovery of their
freedom; I would fain know upon what principles of Law or Reason this can be
judged a Dissolution; but its no news for discontented persons to create
cavils, and then disperse them as material principles of Reason; whereas if
they were but duly considered, they would appear to be but vain Chymira's,
vented on purpose to occasion disputes, and foment troubles and divisions.

But the former is backed by another considerable plea against this Power, and
that is the increase of Taxes; and this seems to make an exceeding great noise,
catches every ear, and furnishes discourse for every busy tongue, that
otherwise would be at a loss for news to tell in a Tavern or Alehouse.

As to the increase of Taxes you may thank your selves and not the Parliament:
for pray remember in what condition you were, when they had that force put upon
them, as to peace, trade at home, and credit abroad, nothing lying upon you but
an ordinary Tax and moderate Excise; and yet then as certain a charge lay upon
the State, in respect of the Dutch war, (powerful Navies being exceeding
chargeable) as ever the late Powers could pretend to; and yet still some
public debts were paid, as well as the Armies and Navies; so that in a short
time England had probable hopes of great ease, as to an abatement of their
Taxes, especially if an as honorable and advantageous peace had been made with
the Dutch, as this Power proposed and insisted on, and for denial whereof they
undertook that war. But if you remember further, there has been a Spanish war,
set on foot without the consent of Parliament, and therein not only many men's
lives lost, but much Treasure has been expended; and not only so, but vast
debts at home, and arrears abroad, contracted and owing both to the Armies and
Navies, besides the charge of a Court (for the inferior part of it) more
luxurious than the Kings: By all which means great debts now lie upon the
Parliament, although you know what an exceeding great increase of Excise was
granted by one of his Conventions, to the discouragement (if not ruin) of
Trade: now, I say, this was Englands, nay, give me leave to speak it to the
shame of many, it was even the fault of those, who had most reason to assert
the parliamentary interest, had not we repined, and like ignorant children
eagerly desired a change, in expectation of better things, we had not in this
manner met with worse: neither had the General, though his Army had been united
to him, (which we know for the generality were surprised) dared to have
attempted their dissolution, or his own usurpation; but we, like a company of
weather-cocks, are now so Frenchified, that every new Finglefangle takes us,
and we are more ready to run with our flattering addresses to them that forge
strong chains for our heels, (I might say, hearts) than those that endeavor to
recover and secure our freedoms. I need not mention the present occasion, the
charge is visible in your eyes. Now pray how shall these debts be paid? The
decay of Trade, which you all experience and complain of, renders the Revenue
of the Customs and Excise very inconsiderable, and what other Incomes may
happen is uncertain; you see there be enemies at home, and you have reason to
suspect foes from abroad; besides the visible necessity of a considerable
strength, to balance the discontents of honest men, who, as the case stands,
are hardly to be trusted with the keeping of their own peace: now, I say, upon
all these considerations, how can you charge the Parliament? You would have a
Protector, and still strive for a King; nothing but a single person will please
you: and yet although you lay all these foundations to contract debts, you are
loath to have any hand in the payment: but soft and fair, self do, self have; if
you will have Princes you must maintain them, and if your discontents endanger
the peace, it is a necessary duty, incumbent upon the Parliament, to keep an
Army to prevent you. Englishmen are almost turned Bedlamites, and, were not the
Lash threatened, Harmony would be turned to Discord, Cain would slay poor Abel,
and all Parties, like Sampson and the Philistines, would dye together, though
probably their expectations may be otherwise.

I know, to serious men I have said enough, as to this Subject, and for
self-willed persons all that can be said is too little, because they are wedded
to their own fancies. Discontented persons desire no satisfaction, and
Malignant ones deserve none. I shall therefore proceed to offer some few
Quaeries to the consideration of all Parties, that take themselves to be
concerned in the peace and prosperity of England, and submit all to the
consideration of the unprejudiced Reader.

1. Whether it be by any rational man supposed, That the Kings of England, as
single persons, had their power and magistracy by the immediate designation of
God?

2. Whether (if not by Gods immediate appointment) it was not attained by force
or fraud, or conferred upon them by mutual compact and agreement for society
and safety sake?

3. Whether (if so conferred) the people conferring was not the supreme
Authority?

4. Whether it can, upon any principles of Reason, be imagined, That the
people, thus sensible of the benefit of Society, and in order thereto making
choice of such a form of command and subjection, did not also by some equal
rules balance the power, to prevent Tyranny in their King, and Slavery to them
and their posterities?

5. Whether (if the power were attained by force or fraud, although for a time
the people for necessity sake do submit) may they not throw off that Yoke, and
recover their freedoms if by any means they can?

6. Whether, in case of compact, the King taking upon him the Government, upon
Condition of performance, and that upon oath solemnly taken in the presence of
the people, he shall notwithstanding act according to Will and not Law, thereby
rendering that which was intended for the common good, a common mischief; I say,
whether in this case the people are tied up to a slavish, servile Obedience,
and left without all manner of remedy, either of divesting him of that
Authority, or of calling him to an account, or judging him by the said compact
and agreement; and if so, upon what principles of Reason or Prudence could they
submit to such a slavery?

7. Whether, if the people may call their King or supreme Magistrate to an
account, they may not elect another, or choose and establish any other form of
Government, to them appearing most conducible to their safety?

8. Whether any Government be more likely to answer the great ends of the
people, than when their Laws are made by their Representatives equally elected
and limited, as to the exercise of that power, so that he that commands this
year shall taste of subjection the next, and therefore will be careful how he
entails slavery upon himself and posterity; the Law binding all alike, and not
saying, Thou shall not kill but I may, but whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by
man shall his blood be shed; and so in all other cases?

9. Whether the present Parliament be not the most likely persons to establish
a Government upon the most equal principles of Freedom, that have so frequently
declared for it, so zealously contested against Tyranny, even unto the blood of
the Tyrant, and remain so solemnly engaged to God and man, both by their own
Declarations, Promises and Principles, according to the best of their judgments
to accomplish it, and that as a testimony of their thankfulness for the eminent
deliverances that God has given them in their endeavors to obtein it?

10. Whether the discontents of the people, and endeavoring to bring in a
Family, that, it is to be feared, God has set his face against for evil, may
not only provoke God to deal with England as with Israel of old, and give them
a King in his wrath, but also bring a judgment of war upon this Nation, with
the miseries accrewing; and then, when it is too late, men will wish for that
peace, which now is so irksome and troublesome?

11. Whether, if the present Parliament had a desire (as is pretended) to
perpetuate their power, the hair-braind actions of the generality of the
present Generation, does not treat a real occasion, it not being safe to trust
unskilful riders with such wild Asses?

12. Whether, (if notwithstanding) the present Parliament, through the blessing
of God, shall attain the desired end of peace and freedom by the settlement of
successive Representatives, and make due provision for the equal distribution
of Justice, and having established this Nation upon a sure basis or form of
Government, as a Commonwealth, shall in some convenient time dissolve
themselves; whether, I say, most persons in England will not have just cause to
take shame to themselves for the Slanders, Reproaches, Interruptions and hard
Thoughts they have harbored against their faithful Patriots, who, maugre all
difficulties, have been supported in their spirits to prosecute their work,
resting upon the righteous judgment of God, and not valuing the threats or
tumultuary disturbances of contrary-minded men?

My Friends pardon my plainness, I do not speak from a principle purchased by
Reward: that which swayes with me to assert the forementioned Premises, is, a
real knowledge of many of the Gentlemen, and of their aim in the general; and
if the unbelief of England make not their Chariot wheels heavy, I am confident
that God will make them as great Instruments of good to this Nation, as they
have been examples of wonder and astonishment to their Enemies abroad and at
home. But if by Jealousies, Murmurings and Repinings, Plots, Insurrections and
Rebellions, men will not only interrupt them in their work, but also
necessitate them to act upon principles of safety and severity, I refer it to
all rational persons, whether it be likely that they should ever be able to
answer those ends* which you so much desire, and yet by all crooked endeavors
hinder? How can you expect peace when you design war? How can you expect ease
from your burdens, while you create a necessity, rather of increase of an Army
than of lessening it. Certainly, if men would but consider former Experiences,
and eye what different methods God has observed in bringing about his great
and unparalleled dispensations in these Nations, contrary to all the designs
or expectations of men; I say, certainly were these things soberly considered,
it would teach men patiently to wait in hope for the good they expect in Gods
own way, and not take upon them to prescribe how, and in what manner, or by
what Instruments it is conveyed. His Arm is not shortened, why then should any
man despair of attaining his desires? Is it not because he will confine God to
such and such means; and without it be done in such a way, it is presently
concluded it cannot be done? Whereas both Experience and late Examples
manifest, that God has transformed the hearts and judgments, and turned the
designs of the Great men of the World topsy-turvy, beyond all expectation, as
in the very case of the present Parliament; and without doubt, when ever they
shall cease from designing his glory and the public good, or render themselves
unfit Instruments for the work which he is doing in the World, then, and not
till then, shall their Counsels fail, and they shall be shattered and cast away
as useless and unprofitable servants; others, better fitted, shall be raised
in their stead, (for God has a succession of Providence, and all his Councils
are ordered and sure) therefore wait patiently, and you shall see the
salvations of the Lord.

LAMBETH, August 30. 1659. This is the assured hope and expectation of him that
desires to manifest himself (Friendly Reader) thine in the advancement of his
Countries peace, J. H.

A POSTSCRIPT to the Parliament and Council.
Right Honorable,
HAving in the foregoing Narrative taken the boldness to treat of you, give me
leave now in plainness of heart to speak a few words to you. I confess you may
justly demand, How dares such a poor, despicable, obscure Creature, as I am,
presume to paraphrase of, or dictate to you, that are the Princes of our little
world. I know by sad experience it many times falls out, that Integrity is
accounted Arrogance and Singularity; Flattery better pleases the ears of great
men than plain dealing, but I hope better from the greatest part of you;
however I have not learnt to flatter, nor know how to fear, therefore my Reward
is with that God that knows the bent of my spirit, and will in the latter end
bear testimony, that what I have done herein proceeds from a principle of
affection, not only to your persons, but to the public Interest concentred in
you.

Those Travelers that fear dangers or desire safety in their journeys, use
diligence in their enquiries, and receive direction with thankfulness; but if
an unknown or unthoughtof danger be discovered unasked, that doubles the
obligation, and it is not an unusual thing in long and dangerous travels
(especially where Enemies are on all hands) for such occasions to offer
themselves.

It is an old but true Proverb, Standers by see more sometimes than they that
play; and the reason is obvious, high conceit does usually occasion oversight,
and we are apter to discern other men's mistakes then our own: Self-opinion and
Self-love are two of the most dangerous Steers* men that can possibly be
employed at the Helm; and if Captain Humility look not carefully to the
Compass* it is ten to one but the Ship will either be split upon the Rock of
Ambition, or swallowed up in the Quicksand of Oppression.

That you have a difficult (I may say dangerous) Journey to go, as being
encompassed with enemies abroad, (I wish I could not say at home too) besides
the clogs and remora's occasioned by domestic divisions, flowing from the
difference of Interest and Principles, I think will not be disputed or denied;
I might to the difficulty and danger add the distance, for if ever you arrive
at your journeys end, as you have set out from the Wilderness of Tyranny and
Slavery, so you must never cease till you have attained the desired Canaan of
justice and freedom. You know it is said, that none obtain the prize but they
that run to the end of the Race, and truly I may say to you in the same sense,
that it will not be sufficient for you to bring England to the borders, or
within the sight of the enjoyment of those promised ends, you have so
frequently declard for, and they have so earnestly desired; unless God shall
deal with you as with Moses of old, and for your transgressions suffer you
only to see the Land a far off, but you must with Joshua, conduct the people
into the possession of your Promises and their Hopes, maugre all opposition.
And though there be many Corah's that create fears and disparage the work, both
as to the matter and manner of it, yet be not discouraged, but proceed; and
consider, that if the work was good when you first declared for and undertook
it, although the way to the attainment be strowed with briars and thorn, yet
certainly the end will be crowned with peace, glory and joy unspeakable.

But what do I speak of the Wilderness when you have already entered into
Canaan? The yoke of Pharaoh is broken, and we are under a solemn tie and
engagement never more to return to Egypt, then in your March beware of the
Gibeonites. There be many, that because they cannot conquer, will flatter, and
cry peace, peace: many will (and do) walk your ways with other intentions, I
beg of them therefore to beware of such Covenant-mongers, for fear (instead of
freedom) you entail slavery, or, at least, thrust an incurable thorn into the
sides of your and our Posterities.

I shall not take upon me to point out the persons, that merit this
appellation; but I say, you may know them by their fruits, unless Thistles do
(in this strange age, of strange productions) bear Figs. I shall therefore
proceed to present a few things to your view, and humbly submit my self and
them, to your serious consideration.

1. That great engagements do not only occasion great expectations, but also
create answerable obligations, both toward God and man.

Now give me leave to appeal to you, and beg of you to consider, whether ever
a Generation of men in Power as you now are, lay under, or stood obliged to
such, and so many solid, serious, reiterated, religious and civil engagements,
as you are and remain at this day; and if so, what need have you to take heed
to your standing! and as that noble Heathen, who had his Remembrancer every
night to put him in mind that he must dye, so you, to recount your Declarations
and Engagements, to the end not one of them be broken, so far as they are
consistent with the glory of God, and good of this people, with the Government
of whom you are entrusted.

2. Consider, that great mercies require suitable returns; that you have been
partakers of infinite mercies inward and outward, I hope the greatest part of
you experience, now pray what is a more suitable fruit of mercy received, then
to manifest mercy to others? I am sure, forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive others that trespass against us, is the best argument that our Savior
has left us to make use of, when we beg forgiveness of God; and if so, I
cannot but judge it to be the best rule of our proceedings, and much better
then an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth. I speak not this to indulge or
indemnifie Traitors or disturbers; but I offer it as an expedient in order to
moderation, Summum jus est Summa injuria, there is a vast difference between
justum and justa; as too much security may endanger safety, so too much
severity may by degrees introduce slavery, the consequence whereof is an
equal, (if not a greater and more incurable) mischief.

3. That afflictions like the Sun either harden or soften, make better or
worse. God has for your own and Englands sins, for several years past,
judged you in the presence of the people; and for my part I do not doubt, but
under the sense thereof you have secretly and solemnly humbled your selves
before the Lord, acknowledged your wanderings and waywardness; and not only
so, but have made your vows and taken up resolutions, that if ever you were
restored, you would do what ever your hands found to do with all your might,
without dallying, denial or delay: And I really believe your late (I may say)
miraculous (I am sure unexpected) restoration has been the fruit, if not of
yours, of many of the good people of this nations prayers, who mourned over,
and longed for you, as instruments by whom they expected deliverance from their
threatened Spiritual, and then inflicted temporal enthralments; now upon this
consideration, judge seriously both your work and your way.

Your work is to relieve the oppressed, and to let the bound go free.

I might here enlarge, but in short, all oppressive Laws, whether relating to
the Consciences, Persons or Estates of men; all oppressive rules used in Courts
of Judicature, all oppressive exactions of Bailiffs, Goalers and
Prison-keepers, as to matters of debt and the like, ought with speed to be
prevented and removed, as being Ulcers that will suddenly occasion the whole
body to Gangreen; and give me leave by the way to hint one thing that in a more
special and immediate manner concerns your inspection: it is suggested very
frequently, that there are exceeding great exactions used by some of your
inferior Officers, entrusted with the Custody of your Prisoners of war; which
if true, renders your very mercy as mere cruelty as may be, I do not charge it;
and I know if any such thing be, it is both against your principles and former
practice, and I am sure it is contrary to equity or the present interest; many
are prisoners that probably deserve more, and I believe others that merit not
so much; however though all are and ought to be subject to the Law so far as
guilty, yet none ought to be slaves to the will of their keepers, further then
in order to their sure keeping: and whatever authority may be pleaded, the
great exaction of fees, and the monopolizing of their bellies and purses, by
denying the supply of provisions from any but themselves, and that sold too at
a dear rate; I say, (if it be true,) it is a great dishonor to the State, a
punishable crime in the keepers, and a positive oppression to the prisoners;
and would be worthy your speedy inquisition, to the end your honor, and the
public justice may be vindicated.

Having heard great complaints to that purpose, I have thought it my duty in
this way to inform your Honors, and if it be possible to shame them out of
such by paths; all that is so gotten being but like a moth, that will devour
and eat up the honest profit that might be got by their employments; but
probably the thought of the gain will vanquish the shame, and if so, a just
punishment seasonably inflicted, may work that repentance which friendly
admonition could not accomplish.

As to those declared foundations of Freedom, upon which a sure Basis of
Government is to be settled, I shall not take upon me to intermeddle, not
doubting but the wisdom and Interest of Parliament is such, that as they will
on the one hand take care to curb and restrain licentious profaneness and
oppression, so on the other hand, those that are pious and peaceable, though of
what Opinion soever, not contradicting the written revealed Word, nor opposing
the fundamental Principles of Religion, may and shall receive protection and
encouragement, and not be left to the fury of Phanaticks; and in so doing you
will bring much glory to God, good to his people in these Nations, and lasting
honor to your selves and Posterities; which is the daily Prayer of,

Right Honorable; Your faithful Servant, John Harris.

FINIS.
