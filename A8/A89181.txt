Mr. Millington Reports from the Committee of Plundered Ministers, the matter of
Fact touching the Book entitled, The Doctrine of the Fourth Commandment
deformed by Popery, reformed and restored to its Primitive Purity, etc. And the
examination of Augustine Nicholas, Servant to Gartrude Dawson, Printer of the
said Book for James Oakeford; and the examination of John Hide.

Resolved by the Parliament,

That this Book (entitled, The Doctrine of the Fourth Commandment deformed by
Popery, reformed and restored to its Primitive Purity, etc.) ascerting the
observation of the Jewish Sabbath, and condemning the observation of the Lords
day as the Christian Sabbath, is Erroneous, Scandalous and Profane, contrary
to the practice of the Apostles, and of all the Christian Churches.

Resolved by the Parliament,

That all the Printed Copies of the said Books be burnt; And that the Marshal
be required to do the same at the Exchange and in Cheap Side.

Resolved by the Parliament,

That all Printed Copies of the said Book, wheresoever they shall be found in
England or Wales, shall be brought to the Chief Magistrate of the place where
the same shall be found, who is hereby required and enjoined to cause the same
to be burnt accordingly.
