The DIGGERS MIRTH, OR, Certain Verses composed and fitted to Tunes, for the
delight and recreation of all those who Dig, or own that Work, in the
Commonwealth of England.

Wherein is showed how the Kingly power does still Reign in several sorts of
MEN.

With a hint of that Freedom which shall come,
When the Father shall reign alone in his Son.
Set forth by those who were the original of that so righteous a Work, and
continue still successful therein at Cobham in SURREY.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1650.

The Diggers Christmass-Caroll.
This for a Christmasse-Caroll was invented,
Which here unto your view is now presented;
'Twas writ at that time which you Christmasse call
And had come forth then; but this is all
The reason why it came not forth before,
Because we thought for to have added more.
Accept of this therefore with all thy heart,
Thou may hereafter see a Second part.
To the Tune of the Spanish Gypsy.
1.
YOu people which be wise,
Will Freedom highly prise;
For experience you have
What it is to be a slave:
This have you been all your life long,
But chiefly since the Wars begun.
2.
When great Men disagree
About Supremacy,
Then do they warn poor men
To aid and assist them
In setting up their self-will power,
And thus they do the poor devour.
(3)
Yet they cunningly pretend
They have no other end
But to set the poor Free
From all their slavery:
And thus they do the poor deceive,
In making them such things believe.
(4)
Their blind Guides will not spare,
These things for to declare;
Ye they aloud will cry,
Stand for your liberty;
The Gospel that lies at the stake;
Rise therefore it is time to awake.
(5)
The Priests very sensible be,
If the poor their Liberty see;
Their Tythe-plundring trade will fall,
And then farewell Tithes all.
Then would they not be finely fed,
But they must work for their own bread.
6.
The King an Army did gain,
His power for to maintain;
That Army did pretend
For to be England's friend,
In saving of their Liberty
Which lay at stake and like to die.
7.
Another Army then
Was raised by mighty Men,
That Army to oppose,
Looking on them as Foes:
Likewise these powers did agree
To make the English Nation free.
8.
A Covenant they did take,
And promises they did make
All burdens to remove,
And to unite in love;
Yet we cannot see that good hour,
The taking down of Kingly power.
9.
The Nation willingly
Did maintain this Army,
Their Freedom for to gain;
But as yet all in vain:
For still a Kingly power does stand
In many persons of this Land.
10.
A Kingly power I say
Does in most men bare sway,
But chiefly in Lords of Manors,
And in the Priests and Lawyers:
This Kingly power is their Self-will,
Which in this manner they do fulfill.
11.
The Priests they tyrannize,
By taking of the Tithes;
The poor they much oppress
By their pride and idleness:
No Scripture warrant they can show,
Why any of these things they do.
12.
Therefore I pray consider,
And lay your heads together;
For you will never thrive,
Whilst Priests do gain the Tithe.
But let them work as well as you,
For Reason bids them so to do.
13.
They neither plow nor sow,
Nor do they reap or mow,
Nor any seed do find,
But Priests the people grind:
The tenth of all things they do crave;
And thus each man is made a slave.
14.
The Lawyers they are next,
By whom the poor are vexed;
Their practice is most base,
For they will plead men's Case,
According to the length of the Purse,
And so the Lawyers prove a Curse.
15.
Another trick they have,
The Nation to inslave;
Men's quarrels they will maintain,
Their Moneys for to gain:
Therefore if Lawyers you uphold,
They Will cheat you of your silver and gold.
16.
Therefore my brethren dear,
The Lawyers quite Cashiere;
Go not to them for Law,
For they your sides will claw;
They Will tell you that your case is good,
When they do mean to suck your blood.
17.
Therefore be ruled by me,
And do not Lawyers Fee,
But end your suits at home,
Lest you be overthrown;
For if Lawyers gain your estate,
You may repent when it is too late.
18.
Besides the Priests and Lawyers,
There be the Lords of Manors,
Who lay claim to waste Land,
Which by bloodshed was gained;
For Duke William the Norman King,
By much bloodshed this land did win.
19.
When he this Land had gained,
He presently Ordained,
That his chief Soldiers should
This Land by parcels hold,
Owning him to be the Supreme,
In paying tribute unto him.
20.
From hence came Lords of Manors,
With Fines, quit-Rents and Heriots,
And all such cursed things,
Which are paid to these Kings:
And thus the people be broughtdown
By Lords of Manors who wear the Crown.
21.
The Lords of Manors, I say,
Do bear a mighty sway;
The Common Lands they hold,
Herein they are too bold:
They will not suffer men to till
The common Lands, by their good will.
22.
But Lords of Manors must know,
Their title to Commons is low;
For why their title came in
By WILLIAM the Norman King.
But now the Norman successor is dead,
Their Royalty to the Commons is fled.
23.
Therefore let me advise
All those which Freedom prise,
To Till each Heath and Plain,
For this will Freedom gain:
Heriots and Fines this will expel,
A bondage great men know full well.
24.
For we do plainly see,
The Sword will not set's free,
But bondage is increased,
Because our wealth is wasted
By paying Taxes and Free Quarter,
Expecting Freedom would com after.
25.
But Freedom is not wonn,
Neither by Sword nor Gunn:
Though we have eight years stayed,
And have our Moneys paid:
Then Clubs and Diamonds cast away,
For Hearts and Spades must win the day.
A hint of that FREEDOM which shall come,
When the Father shall Reign alone in his Son.
THe Father he is God alone,
nothing besides him is;
All things are folded in that one,
by him all things subsist.
He is our light, our life, our peace,
whereby we our being have;
From him all things have their increase,
the tyrant and the slave.
And when the Father sees it good,
and his set time is come;
He takes away the tyrants food,
and gives it to the Son.
Then Esau's potage shall be eat,
for which he sold his right;
The blessing Jacob shall obtain,
which Esau once did slight.
And Jacob he shall then arise
although he be but small
Which Esau once did much despise
And Esau down must fall.
For there must rise a root of Jess.
a righteous branch indeed;
Who sets free him that is oprest
and Esau down must tread.
And Esau shall the blessing seek,
and with tears shall it crave;
Which he did set unto the meek,
which once he made a slave.
But sing, O Jacob, for thy time
of freedom now is come;
And thou thy self judge Esau,
the which has done the wrong.
For to the Son the Father has
all Judgment given now;
And Esau shall be justly judged,
which Jacob's seed has plowed.
And thou that as a Lord have Reigned
over Gods Heritage;
Thy part thou have already played,
therefore come off the Stage.
For when thou think thy self most safe
and riches thou have got;
Then in the midst of thy peace,
torment shall be thy lot.
And of this long time thou have been told,
but much thou did it slight;
Therefore Esau we must be bold
now for to claim our right.
For now the Father's pointed time,
which he did fore-intend
To set up Freedom, and pull down
the Man which did offend:
The time, I say, it is now come,
in which the Lord will make
All Tyrants servants to the Son,
and he the power will take.
This worldly strength wherewith thou did
all times thy self repose;
Shall prove but as a broken reed,
for thou the field shall lose.
For there shall rise a mighty Stone,
which without hands is cut;
Which shall the Kingly powers break,
he shall be free from shot.
The first that which this Stone shall smite,
shall be the head of Gold;
A mortal wound he shall them give
now mind thou have been told.
FINIS.
