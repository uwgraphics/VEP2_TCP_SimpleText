Something further in answer to John Jacksons book called Strength in Weakness.
John Jackson, in the printing of my Papers (so far as thou have printed my
words) in that I rejoice, and shall rejoice the more it is preached, though
some preach Christ of envy, but thy deceits ought not to be hid least I
partake with thee therein.

In thy title page thou says, (published at the request of some, etc.) and in
thy letter to me thou said (thy Spirit was free, to publish it) and that it
were thus with thee, and this was before some of my answers was written: did
some body request thee to publish the answer to my Papers, respectively (as
thou says) before they was written? this is but a poor shift, but it must
serve where no better can be got, and when the Leopard changes his spots, then
will that Spirit deal plainly: but did none of those (some) request thee to
answer my Queries, which thou have printed unanswered; And that letter I sent
to Samuel Tull and thee, and the rest. If they had not been partial in their
requests; they might have spoken one word for me, that I might have received
once an answer from thee, having so often answered thy Queries both by words
diverse times and also by writing, but it seems both thou and the requesters
are got above that law (to do as you would be done unto) or to deal equal, to
others as your selves; that feed is wanting, where the world reigns, yet shall
not that keep me, from laying open the truth I have received.

Thou says, Judge not according to appearance, etc. I say what else can they
judge with, who denies the light within? but will not this destroy your former
doctrine? may one now judge and not see the face. The thing for which thou have
to much opposed me, did thou not before deny any way of intelligence but
outward appearance? and said thou durst not believe it: it seems thy faith is
changed since then, or else thy tongue: but here its seen how Christ's words
suits your doctrine and practice; Thou may be ashamed if thou deny the light
of Christ within any more: either must men judge according to the light within,
or by outward appearance.

Something thou have added in the conclusion as an excuse, wherein thou desires
the Reader to compare with what went before, and try if there be any such thing
said as may circumscribe, or limit the most high in his message to personal
knowledge, or information of men: to which I say, thou said; If I had another
way of intelligence besides sight and hearing, or outward appearance, without
words, etc. Thou durst not believe it, besides thy reproaching it with the name
of bitter assaults of the enemy and the like; And she said to whom I wrote, she
does more wonder how I durst adventure, upon one I know not, whose face I never
saw, (as touching the message, I was moved to write to her) If this be not as
much to circumscribe and limit the message of God; to personal knowledge and
information of men, as in your lies, all may plainly judge, seeing neither her
daring nor thy reproach, could stop it for doing its work, yet have you both
as much with-stood it as the creature can, the mind of the creature, sent in
message, and this you will find in the end.

And whereas you call it a heavy charge, I say your seeking to cast it off,
will but make heavier; could you break the Yoke of Wood, for you must be
prepared Iron, thus shall it be to all who kick at his message; And whereas
you tell of her being unknown or seen, I say known and seen she is and thou
also: with that which changes not, before I writ to either of you, though thy
name thou did conceal, but this the blind knows not, who hates the light
yet that which thou calls J. N. thou may see so the ground of your opposition,
must be want of outward knowledge, else your ground is false judged with that
which reveals that in man which man knows not.

There is one thing thou have put in the Margent as though I had not answered
(to wit) the redemption of the body, which must have relation to her letters
who says she is still kept groaning for adoption (to wit, redemption of the
body) and has her own deceivings in her, untryed, and yoakes of sinful
covenant in her unbroken, and yet she knows her self to be in the Kingdom.

To which I answered before that no selfe-deceiving not sinful Covenant comes
in the Kingdom of God, unless thou and she mean the Kingdom of this world; and
call that the Kingdom of Grace, a new coined word to cover your pride and
worldly glory, for that's the grace the world loves and its Kingdom; And such a
Son and Sonship the world looks for; and there the Son finds you, now he is
come; And for groaning for adoption; I told thee, the Kingdom of God consisted
not in groaning for adoption but in righteousness peace and joy; and none are
there but Sons, and as they are newborn, and this is a plain answer to all
that know Sonship; but who denies the light of the Sun must needs stumble,
though at noone day, and all thou alleges against it to any purpose is that in
the 8 to Rom, where the Apostle tells of the creatures groaning, and traveling
waiting for adoption (to wit) the redemption of the body: where its plain the
condition there spoken of, was such who had received the first fruits, but the
Sons of God was not yet revealed, as in the 19 verse yet having the first fruits
of the Spirit, they was in hope of the fullness, and so was traveling
painfully, toward the Kingdom and rest of God; where noe travel, pains nor
groaning is, where the Sons of God rejoice together without rebuke; but this
the Sons of the stranger who rejoice in the things of this world, knows not,
nor can their imaginations get into it, though it be told over again but still
are groaping and Questioning about that which God has hid and sealed from that
wisdom and prudence, and he is cursed that opens it to that seed, any further
then the Scriptures has, which is all a parable, and the Serpent never the
wier, for its not like he that is in the world should know, who is in the
Kingdom; nor can he see himselse to be without, who denies the light of Christ
to be sufficient, who inlightens every man that comes into the world, and
though the Apostles ministering to the several measures of them to whom they
spoke, did come down to their measures, and so said (we) as in James 3.9. and
diverse other places, yet their conditions it was not then, they was come
through those things, and as touching their own measures, they had to say,
which then they was not able to bear to whom they spoke, nor was that they
knew (in respect of their own measure) lawful to utter to the weak: their
wisdom was not to speak all they knew, though the Serpent speaks all he
imagines, and more then he knows. 1 Cor. 3.2. 2 Cor. 12.4
And still would be climbing to know; but its death for him to obey what he
knows, and in this nature art thou seen to be, who art glorying in words
without life, and practice, and has gathered with wisdom, many words from
others, which are not thine own nor fulfilled in thee, these thou have put
forth that thou may seem to be some body, and so art glorying in appearance in
that which is not wrought in thee; for this I say, had the Saints of God, whose
words thou have got, taken up no other Cross then thou do nor lived no other
life, nor been acted by another Spirit, in other ways then thy practice, thou
had had no Scripture to have taken those words out of, and so now thou have
got them, the Saints words do but little suite thy practice; They were holy men
of God and their work was to wait upon God, in life, and not in words alone:
but thou art a man of the world, and a servant thereto in its ways words and
pleasures, according thereto art thou fashioned, which they was not; Thou
cannot own their life, nor will their words cover thee, by talking them over,
thou cannot behold them but thou may see thy condemnation, and the life will
find thee out

Its the Saints life that judges and tryes the Spirits and ways that are in
the world; Its that you cannot pervert nor wrest, hypocrites, worldlings, and
carnal minds, who live in pride, oppression and deceit, gets their words
once a week to talk on; And with your disobedient wisdom, you twine them to
your own lusts, and in your wills which are not obedient to the Cross of Christ
you handle the letter which the life gave forth, but the life you deny, and the
light you hate and oppose; both in your selves and others, and yet you would be
called Christians, when Christ you have not, in his life, power, will, nor
obedience, only you have him in your mouths to talk on, but the God of this
world having possession of your hearts has so blinded the eye, and alienated
you from the life of God, that you can neither hear, nor see, nor know him
where he is come, but like the blind Jews, are thinking of his coming in
observations without you, but cannot receive his light and appearance within,
nor own his life where it is brought forth in others without, so its plain
you are seeking another Christ or in another manner, then ever he appeared in
flesh, and another glory, then he was ever clothed with, in this world in his
despised ones: so his words are your condemnation who cannot own his ways but
if thou will have an interest in the Saints words and not therewith to be
condemned, come to the Saints life and read the Scriptures, there, a little of
them; there will serve thy turn in that nature thou lives in; if thou there
come and make proof of thy self in that thou can not wrest, thou likes to
be covered with their words; but lay by thy stateliness, and come to be covered
with their glory, which Christ and all his used to be clad withal, in this
world, that which the world strives not for, read Christ in his wants and
wanderings, hunger, and nakedness mocking, buffeting, stocking, stoning,
prisonings, Luk, 2.3.4 1 Cor. 4.10.11.12.13.
in his temptings, fasting, whippings, banishings out of towns, and Cities,
and Countries, as a sign to be spoken against every where, a stumbling stone
and rock of offense to all sorts of professions especially to the wisest, as
the off scouring, scum, and filth of the world, and a gazing-stock where ever
he comes in flesh; so he is to this day, who suffer the opposition of all the
wicked, this is his glory, and this is his joy in this world; wherein we
rejoice to be counted worthy to suffer with him, and if thou will read him in
these lines, in life without thy subtle meanings, then shall thou know a joy
the world meddels not with, nor will thy worldly Spirit delight to be clothed
with this glory, though thou can glory much in their words, who were thus
glorified; but were you to meddle no more with their words then you live in
their practice, and so cease boasting of other men's lines made ready without
you, we should have many eloquent teachers now, as dumb as those was, as
Isaiah speaks of in his time, to whom he preached the Covenant of light which
they opposed. Woe unto you! a sad day is coming upon you all, who have covered
and not with the Spirit, your literal coverings must be ripped off, and your
nakedness must appear; that is the cause why you so oppose the light, and
Spirit within, who have covered the outside but cannot abide the search within:
he is come who made the heart and the war is begun against the Dragon, so the
devourer stands up one every side, and let that of God in thy conscience judge
betwixt God and thee, on what part thou will be found, and how thou loves his
glory, and what of the world thou denies for it, and if thou own him with the
loss of all things, I say let that of God judge thee in secret, and thy
practice openly, how thou ownes a Saints life and glory and way out of the
world until Christ appear, whose light thou opposest to reward thereafter thy
works, who art not in the work of Christ nor the way of his ministers, their
sufferings, and callings: nay if thou mind that in thy conscience which does
not change thou may see thy self in the world before their call out, and
forsaken by them when they came to be disciples, and if ever thou own their
call thou must own their Cross: though now the blind eye be up, and would enter
another way then Christ and his disciples has gone, and so all you that deny
the light and life, death in you gets the fame from without and therewith
opposes your selves, O you dead, deaf, and blind, who are now banded together
against the light of Christ and his appearance, how has the God of this world
besotted you, and filled your hearts with gross darkness above all you read of?
did ever generation practice contrary to what they professed like you? you have
gotten more words but less po^er then ever any of your Fathers, the persecuters
and opposers ever had. does not your great profession and little practice give
an ill savor even amongst the heathen, so that the name of Christians is
become odious, and they are become your Judges in the life of Christianity: do
not they who have not the letter without, who bring forth the effects of that
law which God has written in their hearts, become the Children of obedience
before you, who have long said, I go sir? has not the greatest deceit,
pride, covetousness, and oppression, self-love, that ever was in the world
since Cains time, now got a cover of prefession, and Church-name a among you?
how are you got above all reproof herein, for pride and stateliness, so that
the very language and gestures of the Saints, is abomination to you, and the
sufferings of such as follow them, is not so much valued as you would do your
dogs: how have you made these the times of advantage to exalt your selves,
which God has appointed to pull down what was exalted? how have you eaten up
the sins of them that went before you, and have added their curse to your own,
so that double blindness and hardness is come upon you; And now you are more
void of feeling, and fear, then you was before ever you professed any thing
of God; The Lord and his light be Judge amongst you who now can swallow down,
and live in that which once you could not have done for all the world; so let
the Lord be witness and no deceiptfull lips, if I speak not the truth, as to
many of you: how has the enemy lead out your minds from the Spirit that while
you are preaching the Saints words, you are not able to look within at your own
contrary practice, and stop the mouth of the gainsayer, that so the true
witness of God might arise in you, and let you see the cast away: surely you
are they that are to be bemoaned above all other, who have had a measure of
tenderness, but now wholly lost; and not only so but now oppose it, in others
who retain it, nor would seek after it: and now this being all, that this
shaking and reformation has brought forth in you, the righteous God has cast
you off and chosen things that are not, and things weak and foolish, and
contemptible to confound the wise, and mighty and learned; And the Children of
the Kingdom is casting out, and from far they come to inherit, therefore the
heads of the Serpent, and the beast and the prophet that tells lies, meet
together to strengthen one another, and this is seen amongst you, of several
heads, and horns, and collers, so to you all I write, and not to thee alone,
who art but one joined in amongst many, that if there be any amongst you that
will own the despised light and search your hearts therewith, and try your
ways, and return to the Lord, that you may be healed, and with the light in
thy conscience; thou may take thine own, and so the rest of you, for his
witness is faithful and swift against you and according thereto he will
proceed except ye repent.

JAMES NAYLER.

A Few Words in answer to a printed paper subscribed F. B. who has printed a
piece of the Bible over again, and added a few of his own words to it, for to
pervert it, showing himself to be one of those spoken of, 2 Pet. 3.16.
Unlearned, unstable, who wrests, these and all other Scriptures out of their
place, and so to his own destruction.
FRiend, thou have gathered up many Scriptures, which thou say do witness
against thy judgment and practice of the Quakers, with a charge as thou
call against them, but have not proved one particular true; but if thine eye
had been single, thou might have found thy self lying guilty under the
condemnation there of in thy practice: so take them back again and consider of
them, and let that of God in thy Conscience be judge; for so it shall at that
day when he shall clear the innocent.

The Scriptures we own, and that Light and Spirit that gave them forth, whereby
we know thou art not he that spoke those words to Job, but one that uses thy
tongue, boasting in other men's lines, made ready without thee, to oppose that
life wherein they lived, in his despised ones of this Generaion, whom not one
of these Scriptures does reprove, neither can thou make it appear in any one
particular.

Thou say, thus says the Lord who has washed away our sins in his own
blood, I say, see it be so, least thou be found in sin, and so proved a false
witness; for such are they who set up false Christ's, who profess a Christ
without power, and cry, lo here, lo there in outward forms without, but who
has the true Christ goes nor forth: So consider the beam in thine own eye,
and the nakedness thou tells of, appears in thy paper, and he that has an
eye does see it. For the lusts of the flesh thou tells on: search and see if
thou be not he that is found in the much wantonness thou speak of, which we
deny, a Servant to corrupt things, and would have others so also: if thou say
we preach another Gospel, thou should have showed wherein; but it is a small
thing that we should be judged of man: thou say, judge nothing before the
time, until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden works of
darkness, and will make manifest the Counsels of thy heart: So it seems thou
confessest a time of judgment where the Lord is come, which time we witness,
and by the brightness of his coming the Man of sin revealed, and the Councels
of thy heart made manifest, who to thy Master art fallen, and for him
thoustandeth. Thou say, doubtless thou countest all things but loss and dung
that thou may win Christ. I fay, take heed it be so; least when search is made,
thou be found a liar: thou say, let nothing be done in vain glory, but in
lowliness of mind let each esteem others better then themselves: I say,
remember this, and let it stop thy mouth when thou shall plead for respect of
persons, which the redeemed ones John speaks of, are redeemed from, even out of
Kingdoms, Tongues, People and Nations, and all their vain Customs and Worships,
to worship God only; thou say thou shall rise up before the hoary head, and
honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God. I say, see thou does so; but
how is this fulfilled among you, who will bind gray hairs to bow down and
worship you, where pride is got up in young ones: thus God never commanded, nor
the Scriptures, as thou might have found, had thou had an eye to these
Scriptures following, James 2.10. Joh 32.21, 22. Hest. 3. Prove. 28.21. Acts
10.18. Romans 2.11, Ephesians. 6.9, Jude 16. with diverse others which makes little
for prides purpose, yet will they stand a witness against it for ever.

Now to thy slanders which thou have added upon those thou call deceived
ones, thou say by our Doctrines and practice, we make little of Christ, which
is at the right hand of God in the Heavens, That we make less of his word, the
rule of righteousness and judgment, both of Doctrines, Men and Spirits, That
we make nothing of his Ordinances, in which his Saints are to wait until his
second coming, That we revile his Ministers, that we condemn his justified
ones, who would deceive them of all that faith, hope, peace and joy in the holy
Ghost, wherein the Church of the first born has ever lived. To all which I
say, thou have proved thy self the man thou speak on, who have given thy
mouth to evil, and thy tongue frames deceit and slanders; and this must rest
upon thee, till thou prove us guilty of these things thou have falsely accused
us, seeing thou layest the charge against all those thou call Quakers, And
for the Army of Martyrs, and their life thou tellest of, If thou mind that in
thy Conscience, by which the Ministers was guided, thou will find it a witness
against thee, who have armed thy self with their words against their life,
which is now made manifest in his despised ones, which thou amongst the rest
have lifted up thy Horn against; and thus thou shall see when the book is
opened, and that eye which the God of this world has blinded: then shall thou
see, though that in thy Book is of little force against us, yet it rises from
the same root of envy, from whence has sprung greater things; and that which
has stirred thee up to this, is but making the way for thee to follow them
that imprisoned and shed the blood of the Martyrs: so take heed least thou
proceed to faor, and be given up to have an hand in the same practice; for envy
is as blind now as it was then, and there is nothing stops it but the measure
of God and his light, which if thou forget and act against it when thou art
found in the same work that has been before mentioned, thou may remember
thou have been warned.

For thy confused exhortation which rises from the blind eye, it is judged
with the light of Christ, who sees thy confusion, Thou say repent and become
sinners, that we may be righteous in Gods righteousness: repent and become meek
in spirit, and pure in heart, and so shall we see God: so thou may compare
thy exhortation, and see how it will hold in the balance of truth; but such
repentance suits well with the love of the world, where you may live in your
sins, and talk of Gods righteousness; but where the heart is purified, and God
seen, your repentance is judged, and your vain talk of righteousness without
life, and you are known to be of those which shall not be able to stand in the
sight of God. So take thy exhortation back again, and repent of thy false
accnsations, and speaking evil of that thou knows not, and publishing a
general charge that thou can not prove, and make a search through thy paper;
and what thou have written more then the words of the Scripture, is but to add
slanders and false accusations, and for the Scriptures thou have printed, it is
but that thon might turn them out of their place, to set them against that
spirit that gave them forth, and they little suit for thy purpose. So when thy
blind zeal is alittle abated, thou may see thy work and be ashamed: and learn
when thou writest again to charge no more then thou can prove, least whilst
thou go onto cast thy dirt upon others, whose lives thou can not judge,
thou receive thy own inside, and cover thy self with thy own shame: thou may
receive this if thou can from a lover of thy soul, who contendeth not for
mastery, but to clear the truth, called

JAMES NAILER.

THE END.
