THE True Protestants PRAYER, OR The godly man's supplication unto Almihgty God,
for the afflicted Church in IRELAND. Composed by that learned and religious
Divine, Francis Cook Bachelor in Divinity, and Preacher at Yoxall in
STAFFORDSHIRE. Humbly desiring all godly Christians, for the Lord Christ's
sake, to join with him in Prayer for their afflicted Brethren.
O Almighty Lord, and in Jesus Christ our most merciful Father, although by
reason of our grievous backslidings and Rebellions against thee, we be
altogether unworthy to put up any petitions unto thy Majesty for our selves;
yet encouraged by the manifold experience of thy mercies in hearing of sinners,
we presume to supplicate thine Almighty goodness in the behalf of our
distressed brethren in the Kingdom of Ireland: We confess thou art just (O
most mighty Lord) and therefore for their wickedness, have thou hid thy face
from that Nation; yea, thou have filled it with dead bodies, whom thou have
slain in thine anger; yet behold them we pray thee in mercy, bring health
unto them and cure them, and reveal unto them the abundance of peace and
truth: Lord return their captivity, and build them up as at the first, cleanse
them from all their iniquities, and pardon all their sins, whereby they have
stirred up thy wrath against them, and make their name to thee a name of joy,
and before all the Nations of the Earth a praise and an honor, for the good
thou do unto them, and to themselves an everlasting comfort; because of all
the goodness, and for the prosperity which thou will procure them; and let
there be heard again among these our Kingdoms the voice of joy and gladness,
of the Bridegroom and of the Bride, and in all mouth's, the voice of praise
and thanksgiving unto the Lord of Hosts, because his Mercy endures for ever.
