An Ordinance of Parliament for a day of public Thanksgiving for the Peace
concluded between ENGLAND and SCOTLAND.
WHereas it has pleased Almighty God to give a happy close to the Treaty of
Peace between the two Nations of ENGLAND and SCOTLAND, by his wise providence,
defeating the evil hopes of the subtle Adversaries of both Kingdoms; For
which great Mercy it was by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, the Lords and
Commons in this present Parliament Enacted, That there should be a public
Thanksgiving in all the Parish Churches of his Majesty's Dominions;

It is now ordained and declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That
the time for the Celebration of that public Thanks to Almighty God for so
great and public a Blessing shall be on Tuesday the seventh of September next,
by Prayers, Reading, and Preaching of the Word in all Churches and Chapels of
this Realm, whereof We require a careful and due observance: That we may join
in giving Thanks, as we partake of the Blessing, with our Brethren in SCOTLAND,
who have designed the same day for that duty.

Die Veneris 27. die Augusti 1641.
