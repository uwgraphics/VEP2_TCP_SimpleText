To the Worshipful, his much honored and approved Friend, Mr Luke Constable of
Shaffham in Norfolk; together with his virtuous and religious Consort Mris Anne
Constable: G. D. wishes the fat of Earth, and the dew of Heaven.
SIR,
THe rare bl^ssing (mentioned by that royal Prophet) is by the Father of
lights, and giver of all good things; plentifully poured upon you,
Childrensaith he, and the fruit of the Womb are an inheritance from the Lord,
Psalm. 127. 3, 4. Wherewith your quiver is well filled: And happy are you that
you are so blessed; you shall not be ashamed when you sit in the gates among
your Enemies.

God make your Sons his servants, the Patterns of Virtue, the haters of Vice:
That your Sons may like pleasant Plants stand about your Table: And your
Daughters like the polished corner of a Palace.

This small Catechism divulged by me. I consecrate to them and you, I have no
better gift to bestow on you for your superabundant benefits which makes me
presume to present this paper present. For though your Gentle courtesies I
rehearse,
at present I must pay y^u with a verse.


God bless your Virtuous Consort to you, and you to her, your children to you
both, so having no present opportunity whereby I could more eminently testify
by obligations, I pray accept of this. For I call both God and the World to
witness that this way I honor you, resting always.

Yours really devoted, and ready ^o be c^mmanded. G. DOCHANT
From my Study in Swasham, Jan: 1. 1653.
To the Reader.
I Am not ignorant (Christian Reader) that many Catechismes more pithy and
profound then this, yea far transcending it both for Method and Matter have
already been published, and this needs no more then to help the great sun with
a little light; or to put a superfluous patch upon a complete Suit. Yet
notwithstanding all the books which have been or shall be edited in this kind,
I may thus much say, none of them that ever I see, but in some particular have
what another wanted, and some one abridged, when some other dilated: all of
them being christian competitors, striving who should conduce most to show the
readiest way to the Kingdom of Heaven.

So then, if this poor piece may be any thing, but even Gotes hair toward the
sanctuary of the Lord, nay may it but add one little grain to Gods great
granarie, I shall be glad and give God the glory of it. Beseeching our Lord
Jesus Christ that great Shepherd of his sheep to make this and all the labors
of his beloved servants fruitful Pastors for the comfort of his little flock.
And the perpetual praise of his Holy Name, Amen.

Thine in the Lord, GEO. DOCHANT.

Q. The bread then is not Christ's body?

A. No, for the Heavens hold his body until the day of the resurrection of all
things, but the bread represents his body, as the wine does his blood, seeing
that by one oblation he has consecrated for ever those that are sanctified.

Q. Then Masses are blasphemous, and Massmongers, and such as seek Salvation by
works, are likewise blasphemous?

A. They are so, for they rest not only on this sacrifice.

Q. Must not then works be done?

A. Yes, but not the works of our will, but such as God has commanded; and
then to have no trust in them, for when we have done all that we can we are
unprofitable servants.

Q. How must we come to this Supper?

A. In examination of our selves, whether we have a godly sorrow for our sins
past, and purpose of a new life. Secondly, Whether we have faith to take hold
of Christ and his righteousness. Thirdly, Whether we have love, declaring us
one Body. Fourthly, Whether we be thankful to God for his benefits.

Q. Whence comes it if we come so prepared?

A. Of the grace of God.

Q. How is that obtained?

A. By prayer made in Christ his name, that we eat not, nor drink not
unworthily, it is good that we come together in prayer, joining together with
the Minister in the Congregation, that we may worthily take it. God grant us so
to do.

Amen.
