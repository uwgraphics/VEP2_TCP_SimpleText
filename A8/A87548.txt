TO The most Honorable THE Council of State, The humble Petition of Captain
William Jackett, and his Partners.
Shows,
THat whereas the humble Petitioners were in the year 1648 (since this Sat was
reduced into a Commonwealth) most unjustly and inhumanely dealt withal by the
King of Spain, and his Officers; and especially, by the most disloyal
proceedings of Don Francisco Baracall de Campo, who, contrary to the Laws of
Nations, deprived them of the value of threescore thousand pound sterling, as
it is more at large expressed in the annexed Relation.

Moreover, whereas the truth of their Case is evidently apparent by authentic
proofs, under the Signatures of Spanish Notaries, the which your humble
Petitioners have to produce; and that they cannot obtain any justice at all:
for that their Ships and Specialties have been disposed of to the said King's
use, whereby their Case is rendered most desperate: Besides, the barbarous
imprisonments which they suffered, and where they might have perished, had they
not by providence made an escape.

So it is, that your humble Petitioner having found a way whereby this
Commonwealth may right them, by such means as are most consonant to this
Commonwealth's equity and power; on such just presidents as were made use of
in Queen Elisabeth's time, and the same which are to this day practiced by the
Spaniards themselves, the French, Danes, and Hollanders, viz. by this
Commonwealth's allotting unto your humble Petitioner a satisfaction out of such
effects as are in this Commonwealths possession, and the which do belong unto
the Spaniards.

Now, whereas this State is at present possessed of such moneys and effects, as
appertain unto diverse Spanish Inhabitants of those parts of the Indies, where
your humble Petitioners sustained their said losses: The which moneys and
effects were brought up hither by one Captain Stafford, Commander of the Ship
Sancta Clara from St Domingo;

Your humble Petitioners therefore crave, That the moneys at present claimed by
the Spanish Ambassador, and other his Master's subjects, may by your Honor's
order be applied to the Petitioner's re-imbursment; And that the King of Spain
may be left to give satisfaction unto his Subjects with your Petitioner's
moneys and effects, so unjustly taken and detained from them, on a pretended
occasion, without any example.

And they shall ever pray, etc.

The State of Captain William Jackett's, and his Partner's Case.
ANno 1647. Will. Jackett Commander of the May-flower, a Ship of 400 Tuns and
30 pieces of Ordnance, together with the Peter of 100 Tuns and ten pieces of
Ordnance (being laden with several merchandise) set sail from London the 16th
of June, and arrived in Guiny in the Month of September following, where the
said Captain Jackett bought 460 Negro's or Blacks, intending to sell them where
he best might: But touching at the Barbado's, he there met with one Don Lewis
de Chaves, a Subject of the King of Spain, unto whom the said King of Spain had
granted a free License for to freight any Ship of what Nation soever, that was
in peace with the Crown of Spain, for to transport Negro's into the Indies;
whereupon Captain Jackett made an agreement with the said Don Lewis de Chaves
to go with him into the Indies; and by the said agreement, the said Don Lewis
de Chaves was bound to enter the said Captain Jackett's Negro's in the said
License with his own, which accordingly was don: And on the 25 of March, they
arrived in the West Indies, where being com to an anchor, were permitted to
com on shore, where they met the Governor and the rest of the King of Spain's
Officers of that place, unto whom Don Lewis presented his License, the which
when as the said Governor Francisco Baracall de Campo Captain General of the
Province of Catilonia, and Governor of Barsilonia in the Indies had perused,
he accepted thereof as a thing legal and valid, demanding of Cap. Jackett what
Countriman, and whence he was; who made answer, That he was an Englishman,
Inhabitant of London, and that he came thither freighted by Don Lewis de
Chaves, to Trade there by virtue of that License the King of Spain had granted
unto Don Lewis de Chaves; on the which, if so be he could be received and
admitted, to Trade with them he would: but if the contrary, he would
presently be gone his ways.

Unto which declaration of Capt. Jackett's the Governor replied, That Don Lewis
his License should be considered of the next day in their Council, and if as
then they found it legal or valid (as he supposed the same to be) they would
give him their positive answer whether or no he might be received, and
permitted to Trade.

According whereunto the chief Officers of the said Council, together with the
Mayor of the said Town, did the next day (by the Governor's order) com and
visit or search the said Cap. Jackett's Ships, telling him that he might on
the abovesaid License (which they had found to be very good and true) freely
Trade amongst them; whereupon they took a Register of what Negro's and goods
the said Cap. Jackett had aboard his two Ships, to the end, that such Custom,
as belonged to the King of Spain in those parts, might be paid; the which the
said Capt. Jackett immediately paid.

Moreover, the said assurance thus given in the King's name to Trade freely
there, and the Custom paid, the said Cap. Jackett proceeded to cut Brasielleto
wood, and to buy Hides and Tobacco, and such other Commodities as the Country
afforded, and were requisite to lade his Ships withal, continuing thus in his
said trafficking for the space of near nine months; at the exspiration whereof,
the aforesaid Governor conceiving that the said Captain Jackett might be ready
to set sail, he as then corrupted his Surgeon, and about forty more of his
men; with whom he made a Covenant to betray into his hands the said Captain
Jackett's person, and chief Officers, together with his ships, and lading, for
such a sum of money as he had contracted for, and obliged himself to give
them, the which they received; and accordingly delivered up the said Captain
Jackett, his ship, and goods, amounting to the value of threescore thousand
pound sterling, into the said Governor's hand, notwithstanding their former and
formal declaration, and free admittance of Trade in those parts, by virtue of
the aforementioned Don Lewis his License, contrary to the which, he had not
acted any thing.

Finally, by this unjust proceeding in the said Governor, both the said Captain
Jackett, and his said Partners were undon, after the said Captain Jackett had
in his own person suffered many extremities, during his detention in prison,
where he had perished, had he not by Providence been assisted to make an
escape.

All which appears by the Spaniards own papers, autorized by their own
public Notaries.

An Abbreviate of such Arguments as the STATE may be pleased to make use of,
in the behalf of the aforesaid Captain William Jackett, and his Partner's Plea.
IN the first place, That the wrongs which the Spaniards have don unto Captain
William Jackett were during this Parlament's Assembling; and that the said Don
Francisco de Baracall de Campo did corrupt the said Captain Jackett his men,
for to deliver up unto him the said Captain's ships, and goods, out of a spleen
to the Parliament, declaring to the Governor, that the said Captain was sent as
a spy, to see their Country, that he might the better com with a Fleet by
the Parlament's order to take their Country from them: on which report the
Captain was ordered to be hanged in the market place, but on better
consideration, after they had heard him speak, was only sent prisoner to Spain.

In regard whereof the said Captain his ships and goods were converted to the
King of Spain's use:

Whereby the said Captain Jackett his Case differ's from all others, who before
that time were wronged by the Spaniards.

Secondly, that all other Captains, or Seafaring men, who past the Line, went
thither on their own perils, which was not so with Captain Jackett, for that
he was freighted by Don Lewis de Chaves, a subject to the King of Spain, whose
License was also acknowledged by the said King's Governors in the Indies:
Whereupon the said Captain paid him in the Customs as then due.

Thirdly, that the King of Spain has on several occasions, seized on strangers
goods, on unjust pretenses, even in his own Ports, as also the French, the
Danes, and others have don:

In so much that the said Captain Jackett his Case differing from all other,
does the more argue (for that it is impossible for him and his Partners to
obtein satisfaction from the King of Spain, far less from the said Francisco
Baracall de Campo, who is a Governor in the Indies) that therefore this State
cannot resolv upon a piece of Justice more consonant to their own honor, and
the merit of the Case, then to right the said Captain Jackett, and his
Partners, by allotting them right and satisfaction out of the moneys which are
at present claimed by the Spanish Ambassadors, in the behalf of his Masters,
and his Subjects.

FINIS.
