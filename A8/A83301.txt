Die Jovis, 16 September. 1647.
WHereas it appears by information from the Commissioners for compounding with
Delinquents sitting at Goldsmiths Hall, That thexe is due in Arreares upon Bond
from several persons who have been fined for their Delinquencies, and whose
Reports have long since passed both Houses, and their several Fines allowed by
them, the sum of forty thousand pounds, or thereabouts; yet notwithstanding
nothing has been done by any of the said Persons, Delinquents, for discharging
of their several sums due upon Bond, although their Reports have been passed
as aforesaid; but that they do still continue obstinate and peremptory in their
resolutions, and do not pay the same; It is therefore Ordered and Ordained by
the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, That the Committees and
Sequestrators in the several and respective Counties wherein any part of the
estate of such Delinquent or Delinquents shall lie, who have failed and do
refuse to pay in the remainder of their Fines, according to their ^onds, shall
forthwith sequester the Estates of all such persons whose names shall be
returned unto them from the said Commissioners sitting at Goldsmiths Hall, and
proceed thereupon as formerly before any such Composition made, until they
shall fully satisfy the remainder of their Fines, and shall make the same
appear by certificate from the said Commissioners.

Die Jovis 16 September. 1647.
ORdered by the Lords in Parliament Assembled, That this Ordinance concerning
Delinquents Composition be forthwith printed and published.
